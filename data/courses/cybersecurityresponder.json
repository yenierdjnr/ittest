--> 00:00:11.831\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:13.666\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.450\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.570\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are kicking off\n\n7\n00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.820\nour series for The Logical operations\ncyber security first responders.\n\n8\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.670\nYes, that is a mouthful.\n\n9\n00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.380\nAnd of course,\njoining us to make that happen,\n\n10\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.400\nSecurity Master himself our resident\nsecurity Guru, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.830\nMike welcome to the show, so glad to\nhave you today Thanks, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.910\n&gt;&gt; It's going great thanks for\nhaving me here, I am excited as well.\n\n13\n00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.960\nGot this great course\nfrom Logical Operations.\n\n14\n00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.430\nGood old cyber security first responder.\n\n15\n00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.750\nAnd so\nwe're gonna start off today's episode.\n\n16\n00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.310\nWe're gonna start laying some framework or\nsome baseline knowledge, right?\n\n17\n00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.840\nWe've got to start, we're gonna\nstart by looking at comparing and\n\n18\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.730\ncontrasting different threats\nthat we might face, and\n\n19\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.210\nclassifying what we call threat profiles,\nall right.\n\n20\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.570\nWhen we look at attacks and\nthreats that our organizations and\n\n21\n00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.640\nour information faces.\n\n22\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.170\nIt can sometimes be beneficial\nif we can create a profile.\n\n23\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.160\nBecause there's different types of\nattacks, there's different types of\n\n24\n00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.580\nattackers, different methodologies,\ndifferent reasons for doing the attack.\n\n25\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.280\nThe end result that the attacker\nwants to accomplish is different.\n\n26\n00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.820\nAnd you might think, what does it matter?\n\n27\n00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.960\nWhy don't we just deal with the aftermath,\nthe results of the attack.\n\n28\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.100\nWhat does it matter why we're\ntrying to model the actual threats.\n\n29\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.430\nAnd it's because we can start\nto recognize patterns and\n\n30\n00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.410\nwe can start to understand our opposition.\n\n31\n00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.400\nDepending on the type of data that we're\nprotecting or what our organization is,\n\n32\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.360\nwhere it sits in the grand\nscheme of things,\n\n33\n00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.920\ncan change who is more likely\nto be our foe, be the attacker.\n\n34\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.730\nWhat they're trying to do and\nit will help us focus our security,\n\n35\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.000\nor mitigation, or how we go about\ndefending our information, right.\n\n36\n00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.570\nBase on the types of\nattack that we might face,\n\n37\n00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.470\nbase on the types of attackers\nthat we might have to face.\n\n38\n00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.550\nLike different organizations are gonna\nhave different threats if they have to\n\n39\n00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.770\nface and we need to understand what\nthose are, so we can effectively apply.\n\n40\n00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.230\nBecause we can protect against everything,\nall right.\n\n41\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.190\nI mean we'll just be It's an uphill\nbattle and you're never gonna win it.\n\n42\n00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.170\nBut you can figure out what\nthe most likely things are and\n\n43\n00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.080\nI can put my money there.\n\n44\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.190\nAnd I can put my efforts there and\nhopefully keep our information, and\n\n45\n00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.330\nour company, and our organization, safe.\n\n46\n00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.460\nSo being able to create\nthese threat profiles,\n\n47\n00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.920\nbeing able to understand what types\nof threats that we're gonna face\n\n48\n00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.170\nmore often than not is a big help\nin focusing our security efforts,\n\n49\n00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.070\nand our investments that we're\nputting into security, right?\n\n50\n00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.760\nUnderstanding that for\n\n51\n00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.760\na very simple example, if I don't\nhave wireless networks then why would\n\n52\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.520\nI focus on securing wireless information\nor, threats, wireless type of attacks.\n\n53\n00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.160\nWhere people are outside my building,\nbut they're able to get\n\n54\n00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.640\naccess because my wireless coverage,\nmaybe extends outside my building.\n\n55\n00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.490\nSo I've got people out there that\nare trying to connect to my network that\n\n56\n00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.010\nI don't know about.\n\n57\n00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.840\nIf I don't have wireless networks,\n\n58\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.900\nI don't have to do wireless surveys and\nthings like that.\n\n59\n00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.550\nSo those are the kind of things that\nwe can gain by taking a minute,\n\n60\n00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.480\ntaking some time to really analyze\nwhat it is we've gotta face.\n\n61\n00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.480\n&gt;&gt; It's a really good point.\n\n62\n00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.290\nAnd Mike,\nI thought it was interesting you said that\n\n63\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.640\nnot only are there types of attacks,\nbut there is also types of attackers.\n\n64\n00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.070\nAnd that broadens the scope a whole lot.\n\n65\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.510\nBecause you might not think in that way,\ncan we start there?\n\n66\n00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.310\nThe type of attackers that we might\nencounter as a security first responder.\n\n67\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.560\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nthat's a great place to kick it off.\n\n68\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.210\nSp when we talk about different books\nwe're going to use different terminology.\n\n69\n00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.550\nYou know we've always called them hackers,\nbut technically,\n\n70\n00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.100\nyou know if people want to get\ntechnical a hacker is a good thing.\n\n71\n00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.830\nWell, it used to be, right?\n\n72\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.950\nBack before all of this\nkinda got rolled into\n\n73\n00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.910\na hacker was somebody that you\nwanted to have in your organization.\n\n74\n00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.030\nBack when computer networks and\nsoftware were relatively new,\n\n75\n00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.840\na hacker was somebody that\ncould reverse engineer product.\n\n76\n00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.440\nWe might buy some software or\nget some software, or\n\n77\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.150\nsome kind of have application in it.\n\n78\n00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.480\nIt doesn't do quite what we want it to do.\n\n79\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.110\nA hacker, one of the guys or\ngals on my network,\n\n80\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.370\non my administration that was good with\ncode, could maybe reverse engineer that.\n\n81\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.950\nFigure out how it worked, and\n\n82\n00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.190\nmaybe add some functionality or\nfix some functionality.\n\n83\n00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.260\nThat was the definition of a hacker.\n\n84\n00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.290\nA cracker was the bad guy, right?\n\n85\n00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.085\nNot a guy from Florida.\n\n86\n00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:47.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n87\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.660\nsomebody that did with bad intent or\nmalicious intent.\n\n88\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.620\nBut then with the movies and the news and\n\n89\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.620\nall of this,\nhacker became synonymous with a bad guy.\n\n90\n00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the media really seemed to have\ndriven or drove that terminology to be\n\n91\n00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.090\nubiquitous across anyone that does\ncyber security for malicious purposes\n\n92\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.060\nwhen it never really came from that and it\nwas the crackers were the bad guys, right.\n\n93\n00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.200\nThey were the malicious ones,\ntrying to do things that were malicious,\n\n94\n00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.600\njust evil intentions,\nwhere hackers were good guys.\n\n95\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.079\nAnd now everybody just says hacker and\nI remember watching.\n\n96\n00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.570\nCuz I used to call myself a hacker.\n\n97\n00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.420\nAnd then everybody thinks you're\na bad guy when you do that.\n\n98\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.080\nAnd you're well no.\n\n99\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.380\nAnd you get sick of trying\nto correct everyone.\n\n100\n00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.660\nSo you just start going with\nwhatever the terminology is.\n\n101\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.330\nAnd now, just hackers are bad guys.\n\n102\n00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, and we can try to fix it.\n\n103\n00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.590\nI know a lot of security vendors\nare trying to change the perception, but\n\n104\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.140\nI don't know.\n\n105\n00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.280\n&gt;&gt; That train has done left the station.\n\n106\n00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n107\n00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.940\nYou aren't going to convince those\npeople that are hackers to do a thing.\n\n108\n00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.260\nBut anyway.\n\n109\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.480\nSo terminology wise, hacker,\ncracker, attacker, threat,\n\n110\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.880\nthreat actor, bad actor, if those\n\n111\n00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.800\nare the kinds of terms we typically\ntalk about and logical operations.\n\n112\n00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.710\nReally we're talking about threat\nactors in their terminology.\n\n113\n00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.280\nSo when I say a threat actor,\nwe're talking about the bad guy.\n\n114\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.960\nThe one that's going to be implementing or\n\n115\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.120\ntaking part in the cyber attack,\nall right?\n\n116\n00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.930\nSo threat actors.\n\n117\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.990\nAnd we can classify these.\n\n118\n00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.240\nAs Daniel was saying,\nwe can classify threat actors.\n\n119\n00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.470\nThey're not all the same.\n\n120\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.010\nThey don't have the same skill set,\nthey don't have the same intentions,\n\n121\n00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.210\nthe same end goals,\nthe same techniques, all right?\n\n122\n00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.000\nSo we can start classifying them.\n\n123\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.500\nAnd we start classifying them,\nit helps us,\n\n124\n00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.900\nagain, to implement better security and\nto be ready, right?\n\n125\n00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.360\nDepending on what type\nof threat we're facing\n\n126\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.730\ncould change what we're going to be\nimplementing as far as security goes.\n\n127\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.150\nSo when we talk about threat actors,\nand if we want to classify these guys,\n\n128\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.510\njust keep in mind that these\nare not black and white.\n\n129\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.350\nThere's no set of rules that\nsays this is what this is and\n\n130\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.210\nthis is what this is and will always\nbe and that's just the way it is.\n\n131\n00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:09.750\nThese are really kind of grey definitions\nor they're flexible definitions.\n\n132\n00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.190\nAnd not everything is gonna fit nice and\nneat into one of these categories.\n\n133\n00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:19.460\nYou might have some that kind of overlap\nin a couple of those different areas.\n\n134\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.642\nIt just makes it easier for\nsecurity professionals like you and\n\n135\n00:07:23.642 --> 00:07:26.570\nI to talk about it, to communicate\nwith other security professionals, or\n\n136\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.480\nto communicate with the higher\nups that we need to go to in\n\n137\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.020\norder to get the money we need to\nimplement our security system, right?\n\n138\n00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.630\nWe have to have some way to\nintelligently talk about it, and\n\n139\n00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:42.350\nby creating these categories, we can\nkind of all get on the same page, and\n\n140\n00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.300\nmake it a little bit\neasier to communicate.\n\n141\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.677\nSo let's talk about what different\ncategories we have when we talk about\n\n142\n00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.101\nthreat actors of the bad guys.\n\n143\n00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:53.768\nThese are the ones that\nare implementing the attack, right, and\n\n144\n00:07:53.768 --> 00:07:56.843\nthe first one we'll talk\nabout are gonna be insiders.\n\n145\n00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:59.683\nAnd an insider is a anyone or person or\n\n146\n00:07:59.683 --> 00:08:05.590\ngroup of people that have a close\nbusiness relationship with the target.\n\n147\n00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.540\nThat's how we're gonna define that one.\n\n148\n00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.570\nBut an insider might be\na current employee, right?\n\n149\n00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.800\nOr it could be a disgruntled employee.\n\n150\n00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.870\nOr it even could be an ex-employee\n\n151\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.390\ncould still be considered an insider\nbecause of the knowledge they have.\n\n152\n00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:28.580\nThat's really what differentiates this\ncategory from all the other categories\n\n153\n00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.390\nis the information they have\nabout the network already.\n\n154\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.480\nAs an employee of your organization,\nyou're gonna be privy to information\n\n155\n00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.180\nthat the rest of the world might not know\nor is gonna have to somehow discover.\n\n156\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.898\nYou already know what\nthe usernames are gonna be,\n\n157\n00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:45.660\nright, because you have an account there.\n\n158\n00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.740\nAnd for me, for example,\nI know that my account is Mrodrick.\n\n159\n00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.830\nSo, if I wanna mess with Daniel,\nor I know that Daniel has access\n\n160\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.970\nto information that I want access to,\nI wanna compromise his account.\n\n161\n00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.370\nI'm pretty sure that his account's\ngonna be Dlowry, because my account was\n\n162\n00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.030\nMrodrick first initial,\nlast name most likely his as well right?\n\n163\n00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.210\nBecause there's some\nkind of standardization.\n\n164\n00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.180\nSo as an insider I have that information.\n\n165\n00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.320\nI know how often our\npasswords need to be changed.\n\n166\n00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.840\nI know what the complexity\nrequirements are of the passwords.\n\n167\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.223\nI know the shares that include\nthe documents that I can't get access to.\n\n168\n00:09:21.223 --> 00:09:25.356\nThis is the kind of information that\nan insider would have that a person on\n\n169\n00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:27.850\nthe outside wouldn't have.\n\n170\n00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.060\nAnd it doesn't mean that that\ninformation is not obtainable\n\n171\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.320\nby another class of hackers.\n\n172\n00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.780\nBut it's one less step you've gotta\ngo through and that's the key and\n\n173\n00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.690\nthat's where the real\ndanger is from insiders.\n\n174\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.010\nInsiders are one of the more\ndangerous categories.\n\n175\n00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.890\nIt's not what people think, right?\n\n176\n00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.320\nWhen we romanticize about hackers and\nattacking, if you can.\n\n177\n00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.519\nI don't know if you can.\n\n178\n00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:52.140\nBut as security professionals,\nwe can, right?\n\n179\n00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.100\nWe can see the good and\nthe bad even though it's typically bad.\n\n180\n00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.690\nThese are the ones that we have to worry\nabout the most, I think in my opinion, and\n\n181\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.480\na lot of folks will agree with me,\n\n182\n00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.400\nbecause of the fact that they've\nalready got that inside information.\n\n183\n00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.030\nThey don't have to worry about\ngetting into the network,\n\n184\n00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.340\nthey can walk into work and\nplug into the wall.\n\n185\n00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.330\nOr they can connect to\nthe wireless network.\n\n186\n00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.260\nThey already have an account\nthat's valid on that network.\n\n187\n00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.650\nSo really,\nthey've already made that first step,\n\n188\n00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.370\nnow all they have to do is\nescalate their credentials.\n\n189\n00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.777\nTry to get them to where they can get to\naccess information maybe they shouldn't\n\n190\n00:10:25.777 --> 00:10:27.176\nhave access to, right.\n\n191\n00:10:27.176 --> 00:10:30.727\nSo current employees, disgruntled\nemployees, people that have been,\n\n192\n00:10:30.727 --> 00:10:32.150\nyou know they get angry.\n\n193\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.470\nSomebody parked in my parking spot\nthis morning that I always park in\n\n194\n00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.120\nand now I'm angry.\n\n195\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.600\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and never forget that\nthere, a corporation is large enough,\n\n196\n00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.810\nthere's such a thing as\ncorporate espionage, right.\n\n197\n00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.580\nPeople are trying to get insiders to\nwork for them as a quote, unquote,\n\n198\n00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.880\ndouble agent.\n\n199\n00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.610\nMaybe they have a gambling problem.\n\n200\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.780\nMaybe they have financial problems and\nthey're a little disgruntled at their job.\n\n201\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.320\nNow all a competitor has to\ndo is find that person and\n\n202\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.670\ngo, hey, I'll make it worth your while\neven if you get caught or fired.\n\n203\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.810\nAnd just get me that information and\nyou got to worry about this.\n\n204\n00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.960\nThis is a real thing that could happen.\n\n205\n00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.170\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you see it in\nthe movies but it's very true.\n\n206\n00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.630\nIf I need to get into that organization\nI can't get in myself maybe or\n\n207\n00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.070\nI'm having difficulty from the outside.\n\n208\n00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.320\nI can find an employee that,\nlike you said,\n\n209\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.740\nthis is just right out of the movies, has\na gambling problem or has a ton of debt or\n\n210\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.050\nhas two children that he's trying to get\ninto school and needs money very badly.\n\n211\n00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.500\nThat's the guy I might approach and say,\n\n212\n00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.090\nhey, look, I can make it worth your while\nif you can slip out some information.\n\n213\n00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.040\nHere's a thumb drive,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n214\n00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.710\nOr what's your password?\n\n215\n00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:39.772\nSo absolutely.\n\n216\n00:11:39.772 --> 00:11:43.660\nInsiders play are a big threat\nthat organizations face and\n\n217\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.850\nunfortunately it's something that\na lot of organizations don't consider.\n\n218\n00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.630\nThat's not their first thought.\n\n219\n00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.690\nWe always think about the outside guys,\nthe people from some other country.\n\n220\n00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.860\nWe won't mention any specific ones but\nthat are constantly attacking.\n\n221\n00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.850\nThat's what I'm worried about.\n\n222\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.650\nI'm gonna have perimeters,\nfirewalls, all of this stuff.\n\n223\n00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.690\nGuess what?\n\n224\n00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.790\nThe insider is already passed all of that.\n\n225\n00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.411\nSo none of that is doing you any good.\n\n226\n00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:11.941\n&gt;&gt; He can still walk past the security\ngate every morning and the guard go, hey,\n\n227\n00:12:11.941 --> 00:12:13.477\nwelcome, Joe or welcome, Sue.\n\n228\n00:12:13.477 --> 00:12:14.028\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n229\n00:12:14.028 --> 00:12:15.590\n&gt;&gt; Hey Fred, how's it going this morning?\n\n230\n00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; How's the kids? [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n231\n00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.650\nSo we really, really have to\npay attention to the insiders.\n\n232\n00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.760\nAnd it's something that we'll talk\nabout as we go through these episodes.\n\n233\n00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.150\nBut, because it does take a little\nbit of a different approach.\n\n234\n00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.980\nBecause again, we're always thinking\nabout hardening our services,\n\n235\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.600\nour network, against that outside attack.\n\n236\n00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.010\nAnd a lot of times we forget\nabout the inside attack.\n\n237\n00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.620\nAll right, so insiders,\none more thing to it.\n\n238\n00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.230\nThere used to be a site,\nit's changed a little bit.\n\n239\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.850\nYou go onto cybercrime.gov for\nhere in the US.\n\n240\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.030\nIt's where Homeland Security\nlisted different attacks\n\n241\n00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.920\nthat have been prosecuted or\nare being prosecuted.\n\n242\n00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.670\nThey've modified their site recently,\nbut it used to be\n\n243\n00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.520\nwhere they had a list of different\nattacks that were in court cases, and\n\n244\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.620\nin the next column they had the attacker.\n\n245\n00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.950\nAnd it'd be like a China nationalist or\nsomething like that.\n\n246\n00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:08.280\nAnd then disgruntled employee,\nex employee, employee, employee,\n\n247\n00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.430\ndisgruntled employee.\n\n248\n00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:14.020\nI mean a good majority of the attacks and\nthe crimes that they were prosecuting\n\n249\n00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.910\nwere against employees or\ndisgruntled employees or ex employees.\n\n250\n00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.840\nAnd so insider threats, very, very real.\n\n251\n00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.180\nAll right, another classification\nwould be script kiddies.\n\n252\n00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:24.920\n&gt;&gt; Our favorite.\n\n253\n00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt's a fun one to say.\n\n254\n00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.102\n&gt;&gt; And they're fun, right?\n\n255\n00:13:27.102 --> 00:13:31.777\nThey're cute, they're kids, they might\nnot actually be kids, [LAUGH] but\n\n256\n00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:34.420\nthat's the terminology we use nowadays.\n\n257\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.273\n&gt;&gt; It is and\nit really is meant as a derogatory term.\n\n258\n00:13:38.273 --> 00:13:43.650\nA script kiddie is anybody that's\nreally inexperienced, unskilled.\n\n259\n00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.740\nTypically a script kiddie uses tools and\n\n260\n00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.760\nscripts created by other individuals,\nright.\n\n261\n00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.070\nWe all know about the internet.\n\n262\n00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.286\nWe've been out there,\nyou can find all kinds of stuff,\n\n263\n00:13:56.286 --> 00:13:58.619\nobviously, out there on the internet.\n\n264\n00:13:58.619 --> 00:14:03.661\nWell, a hacker or a wanna be hacker or a\nscript kiddie that doesn't know how to do\n\n265\n00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:08.632\nthese attacks might be able to find tools\nthat will help them launch attacks and\n\n266\n00:14:08.632 --> 00:14:12.304\nscripts that will help\nthem automate attacks.\n\n267\n00:14:12.304 --> 00:14:15.120\nWhere all they have to do is\ndownload a tool from the Internet,\n\n268\n00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.670\nplug in the IP address of their target and\nclick a button.\n\n269\n00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.110\nAnd see if the attack works and if it\ndoesn't hey they move on, plug in another\n\n270\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.710\ntarget and try that, or download a new\ntool and see what the heck that does.\n\n271\n00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.360\nBut they really don't know the key\nhere is they don't understand\n\n272\n00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.460\nhow the tool is working,\nwhat it's actually doing.\n\n273\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.440\nAll they know is they can plug in an IP\naddress or a URL, they can click a button\n\n274\n00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.490\nand they get a command prompt\ninterface to this target machine.\n\n275\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:42.830\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n276\n00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.580\nSo it really is meant\nas a derogatory term.\n\n277\n00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.360\nSo an insider, now again this is\nwhere the gray kinda comes in.\n\n278\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.900\nYou could have an insider\nthat's also a script kiddie.\n\n279\n00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.970\nThat one employee that's mad because\nthey didn't get the promotion but\n\n280\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:58.850\nthey're not a hacker.\n\n281\n00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.590\nSo they start downloading tools and\n\n282\n00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.250\ntrying to play with those\non their corporate network.\n\n283\n00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.140\nAnd so that's where I'm saying you\nreally can see kind of the gray or\n\n284\n00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.070\nthe overlap between certain areas.\n\n285\n00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.560\nSo script kiddies, are they dangerous?\n\n286\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.780\nYes, they can be, but usually not as\nmuch as some of the other categories.\n\n287\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:20.720\nBecause if the tool doesn't work, they\ndon't know how to change it, modify it,\n\n288\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.048\ntweak it to make it work.\n\n289\n00:15:22.048 --> 00:15:26.300\nThey're left stuck and they typically\nhave to find another target.\n\n290\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.312\n&gt;&gt; So as long as your systems aren't\nvulnerable to whatever it is tool they're\n\n291\n00:15:30.312 --> 00:15:32.390\nthrowing at it, you're pretty safe.\n\n292\n00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.368\nThey're gonna move on to\nthe lower hanging fruit.\n\n293\n00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:37.843\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and so\nthey're not experienced in that way.\n\n294\n00:15:37.843 --> 00:15:39.308\nThey can't just pick a target,\n\n295\n00:15:39.308 --> 00:15:43.510\nthey'd have to find one that fits their\ntool that they happened to have found.\n\n296\n00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:47.150\nThe other thing you'll find about script\nkiddies is they typically leave traces of\n\n297\n00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.667\nthemselves everywhere, right.\n\n298\n00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:52.158\nIf they are successful,\nif they do find a tool that works,\n\n299\n00:15:52.158 --> 00:15:56.508\nthey don't know enough about hacking\nto cover their tracks to go back and\n\n300\n00:15:56.508 --> 00:15:58.811\nclear log files and things like that.\n\n301\n00:15:58.811 --> 00:16:04.498\nAnd so they end up leaving traces of the\nattack everywhere or the attempted attack.\n\n302\n00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:06.890\nIf they weren't successful,\nthey still leave traces.\n\n303\n00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.470\nSo typically easy to, relatively easy.\n\n304\n00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.870\nAnything I say, when I say easy I\ndon't mean that it's like click easy.\n\n305\n00:16:14.355 --> 00:16:17.855\nBut it would be easier to try\nto trace that attack back,\n\n306\n00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:21.545\nfigure out where it came from,\npotentially even who launched the attack.\n\n307\n00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:22.795\nBecause they don't understand.\n\n308\n00:16:22.795 --> 00:16:26.946\nBecause they don't realize that\nwhen they do click that button, and\n\n309\n00:16:26.946 --> 00:16:31.742\nthey hit that web server, maybe or\nmaybe they didn't compromise the machine,\n\n310\n00:16:31.742 --> 00:16:35.844\nbut there's most likely log entries\nthat they didn't know about.\n\n311\n00:16:35.844 --> 00:16:41.881\nSo script kiddies typically\na derogatory term.\n\n312\n00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:46.050\nAll right,\nthen we have recreational hackers and\n\n313\n00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:50.140\nrecreational hackers are interesting.\n\n314\n00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.670\n&gt;&gt; Python is a gateway drug.\n\n315\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.442\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH], right.\n\n316\n00:16:52.442 --> 00:16:57.030\nWe're gonna start off with a little Java,\na little Python, work our way up to C++ or\n\n317\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.190\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n318\n00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.790\nRecreational hackers are people who\ndo this more as a hobby, right?\n\n319\n00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.110\nYou might think it's fun, or interesting.\n\n320\n00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:11.800\nAnd I would probably classify\nmyself as a recreational hacker.\n\n321\n00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.170\nI'm not a professional,\nwe haven't gotten into that one yet.\n\n322\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.930\nI'm not getting paid for anything.\n\n323\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.770\nBut I enjoy it, I think it's fun,\nand it's interesting learning about.\n\n324\n00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.460\n&gt;&gt; Because it's like a puzzle.\n\n325\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:25.985\nA lot of people like Mike and I we enjoy\nthe thrill of the chase as it were, right.\n\n326\n00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:28.220\nOkay, can I get through,\nwhat's stopping here?\n\n327\n00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.490\nMan, I think if I did this,\nI'd be able to exploit that and\n\n328\n00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:36.535\nwe know a little bit about security so\nthat helps out and it is a lot of fun.\n\n329\n00:17:36.535 --> 00:17:40.955\nI think a lot of people that are quote,\nunquote, hackers are this very thing,\n\n330\n00:17:40.955 --> 00:17:42.215\nat least in my experience.\n\n331\n00:17:42.215 --> 00:17:45.115\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, the people that are in\nour circles are typically this way.\n\n332\n00:17:45.115 --> 00:17:46.445\nCuz we wanna learn about it.\n\n333\n00:17:46.445 --> 00:17:51.375\nWe read about a threat,\nwe read about a vulnerability in whatever.\n\n334\n00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:53.325\nAnd we wanna see if we can do it.\n\n335\n00:17:53.325 --> 00:17:54.415\nIt's a challenge to me.\n\n336\n00:17:54.415 --> 00:17:57.575\nI need to see if I can actually\ntake advantage of that threat.\n\n337\n00:17:57.575 --> 00:18:01.080\nCan I write a script that takes advantage\nof this vulnerability that was just\n\n338\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.320\npublished, right?\n\n339\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.130\nBut we typically do it in\nnice safe environments, and\n\n340\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.630\nwe're not trying to hurt anybody.\n\n341\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.610\nIn fact, the majority I would say,\n\n342\n00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.380\nof recreational hackers\nare not malicious in intent.\n\n343\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.040\nThat doesn't mean that they can't be.\n\n344\n00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.500\nThere definitely are some\nthat are malicious.\n\n345\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.480\nIt also doesn't mean that it can't\naccidentally do something malicious.\n\n346\n00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.800\nI'm not trying to hurt anybody,\nI'm just testing this tool out.\n\n347\n00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.820\nI put in those URL,\nI click this button and\n\n348\n00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.420\nall of a sudden I DDOS this web server,\nall right.\n\n349\n00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.770\nAnd now I'm panicking,\ngosh they're gonna come and get me,\n\n350\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.310\nthe FBI is gonna be knocking on my door.\n\n351\n00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.550\nThere's gonna be a helicopter\nhovering over the house, right?\n\n352\n00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:36.160\nA black van.\n\n353\n00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.170\nSo we can end up being\naccidentally malicious.\n\n354\n00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.190\nBut recreational hackers can definitely\nbe malicious as well and it is,\n\n355\n00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.250\nsomething that we do have to worry about.\n\n356\n00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.680\nA lot of times recreational hackers or\n\n357\n00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.150\nattackers are going to be\nrepeat offenders, right?\n\n358\n00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.010\nBecause it's a hobby,\nit's something I like to do.\n\n359\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.710\nSo I might start off with little\nthings and as I grow in confidence and\n\n360\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:10.050\nas I grow in skill, I begin to employ more\ncomplex and more creative techniques.\n\n361\n00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.370\nI'm doing this over and\nover, and over again.\n\n362\n00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.260\nSo I become a repeat offender.\n\n363\n00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:20.260\nSome of them sometimes they might be,\nyou see lots of attacks coming from,\n\n364\n00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.150\nor every day there's scans\ncoming from this IP range.\n\n365\n00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:27.150\nNow we're starting to see a little more\nadvanced attack coming from that same IP\n\n366\n00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:27.990\nrange.\n\n367\n00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.940\nThen we finally get\na compromise from that range.\n\n368\n00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.450\nYou see this, this repeat,\nthis escalation, if you will.\n\n369\n00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:41.240\nAnd they typically take more and\nmore risks because as recreational hacker\n\n370\n00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.700\nI'm doing this cuz it's fine and\nI'm gonna start it off,\n\n371\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.613\ncan I ping sweep this network,\ncan I do some fire walking on this router.\n\n372\n00:19:47.613 --> 00:19:50.540\n&gt;&gt; Keeping pushing that line\njust a little bit further,\n\n373\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.040\nnobody cares if I sweep this range and\nscan it.\n\n374\n00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:54.740\nWho cares?\n\n375\n00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.630\nEverybody does it.\n\n376\n00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:56.270\nEverybody does it.\n\n377\n00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.146\nWho hasn't?\n&gt;&gt; Everyone does it.\n\n378\n00:19:57.146 --> 00:19:57.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm just defining it.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n379\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.650\nyour confidence starts building\nbecause I haven't got caught.\n\n380\n00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:02.420\nI haven't got caught.\n\n381\n00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.030\nI haven't caused any problems,\nso I'm gonna do it over and\n\n382\n00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.980\nI'm gonna start taking that next step.\n\n383\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.700\nAnd it's, that's where we end\nup starting to get in trouble.\n\n384\n00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.270\nAnd you see a lot of them.\n\n385\n00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.130\nI think it was recreational hackers.\n\n386\n00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.380\nThey finally go just a little too far.\n\n387\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.250\nThey overstep their skill set.\n\n388\n00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.140\nThey leave a trace and all of a sudden\nthere is that knock on the door.\n\n389\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.844\n&gt;&gt;

They would be a professional hacker.\n\n545\n00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.998\nThat's a very good point and\nsomething we should mention, right?\n\n546\n00:28:29.998 --> 00:28:34.006\nAs a penetration tester for an\norganization, you might work in-house for\n\n547\n00:28:34.006 --> 00:28:38.570\nan organization or you might have your\nown business where this is what you do.\n\n548\n00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:42.170\nYou're getting paid so,\nyou are a professional hacker but\n\n549\n00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:42.850\nyou're not malicious.\n\n550\n00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.540\nRemember we say, professional hackers,\nnot all of them are malicious and\n\n551\n00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.970\nmost of these categories can have, where\nwhat we call white hats and black hats.\n\n552\n00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.350\nAnd we'll come back to some\nof that terminology but\n\n553\n00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.770\na real quick analogy think of cowboys,\nright?\n\n554\n00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:00.947\nWhite hats, good guys, black hats, bad\nguys, same thing within these categories.\n\n555\n00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:03.432\nThere's gonna be good and\nbad probably of each.\n\n556\n00:29:03.432 --> 00:29:07.984\nAll right, we got a few more to go Daniel,\nbut we are getting short on time,\n\n557\n00:29:07.984 --> 00:29:09.158\naren't we there?\n\n558\n00:29:09.158 --> 00:29:11.225\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a little bit but, you know what,\n\n559\n00:29:11.225 --> 00:29:13.731\nthat's the great thing\nabout here at ITProTV,\n\n560\n00:29:13.731 --> 00:29:18.100\nwe just make a part two when we need to\ngo more into more detail and more depth.\n\n561\n00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.590\nSo that's what we'll do Mike,\nif that's okay with you that is?\n\n562\n00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:21.540\n&gt;&gt; That works for me.\n\n563\n00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, looks like we've\ncome to the end of this episode,\n\n564\n00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.880\nwe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n565\n00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.790\nDefinitely, check out the parts that\nwe've got coming up learning more about\n\n566\n00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.790\nthe different Threat Profiles by threat\nactors and attacks that might happen.\n\n567\n00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.530\nLooking forward to see you guys there.\n\n568\n00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.652\nUntil then, we're signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n569\n00:29:37.652 --> 00:29:38.494\n&gt;&gt;

Mike Roderick.\n\n18\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.667\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, no, no.\n\n20\n00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:54.164\n&gt;&gt; Okay, hold on, wait.\n\n21\n00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:55.206\nI admit to nothing.\n\n22\n00:00:55.206 --> 00:00:56.242\n&gt;&gt; No, Homeland Security,\n\n23\n00:00:56.242 --> 00:00:57.290\nI swear it's not me.\n\n24\n00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.620\nBut somebody that's getting paid, but\n\n25\n00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.050\ntypically not getting paid by a third\nparty, but stealing the money.\n\n26\n00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.850\nSo I'm gonna get paid, but only because I\nwas able to compromise your account and\n\n27\n00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.280\ntransfer that money into my account.\n\n28\n00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.043\nSo, we're dealing with things like\nmonetary theft, identity theft,\n\n29\n00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:18.005\nfraud, could be blackmail.\n\n30\n00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.810\nThat would be another way to get paid for\nmy activities.\n\n31\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.810\nI could break in,\ncompromise Daniel's information,\n\n32\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.730\nfind something juicy and then turn\naround and use that to make money.\n\n33\n00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.320\nSay, look I'm gonna release this\ninformation if you don't pay me.\n\n34\n00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.690\nSo, getting paid but\nnot in the same way, not just somebody\n\n35\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.665\nhanding you a check well, probably\ndon't pay hackers with checks a lot.\n\n36\n00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:41.854\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna leave a little bit of\n\n37\n00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:42.452\na paper trail but.\n\n38\n00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:44.193\n&gt;&gt; Will you take a third party\nout of state payroll check?\n\n39\n00:01:44.193 --> 00:01:47.027\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, I don't.\n\n40\n00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:48.240\nI got my Square.\n\n41\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.489\nI can hook it up to my iPhone.\n\n42\n00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:52.071\nHere, just swipe your card through there.\n\n43\n00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:54.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, so cyber criminals,\n\n44\n00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.580\nsomebody gets paid, but\nusually by stealing.\n\n45\n00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.440\nThat's how they're making their money.\n\n46\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.080\nAlso, the other thing\nabout cyber criminals,\n\n47\n00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.760\na lot of times there's a what\nthey call cyber crime rings,\n\n48\n00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.770\nas the terminology that cyber security or\nlogical operators uses.\n\n49\n00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.730\nBut there are online cyber crime rings.\n\n50\n00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.630\nJust like in the physical world,\nthere's crime rings.\n\n51\n00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.770\nThe bad guys hang out with bad guys.\n\n52\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.110\nThey talk to each other.\n\n53\n00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.340\nThey share techniques and\nthings like that.\n\n54\n00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.150\nSame thing for cyber criminals.\n\n55\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.120\nThere are places in the dark web or\nout there in the internet,\n\n56\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.060\nthat you might not venture to.\n\n57\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.658\n&gt;&gt; And don't want to.\n\n58\n00:02:31.658 --> 00:02:32.183\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n59\n00:02:32.183 --> 00:02:35.770\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; If you like your computer and\nyour data you probably don't want to.\n\n60\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.784\n&gt;&gt; And a clean mind.\n\n61\n00:02:36.784 --> 00:02:39.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's rough out there, you all.\n\n62\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.044\n&gt;&gt; Cause you can't unsee it.\n\n63\n00:02:40.044 --> 00:02:40.959\n&gt;&gt; No you can't.\n\n64\n00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.710\n&gt;&gt; Once you've seen it,\nyou can't unsee it.\n\n65\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.780\nYeah, so\nthere are actually rings of people or\n\n66\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.010\ncommunities of bad guys and\nwhere they can share techniques,\n\n67\n00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.460\nshare tools, share information about\npotential targets and things like that.\n\n68\n00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.890\nSo these cyber-criminals\ncan become parts of those.\n\n69\n00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.670\nAnd that just helps them\naccomplish their end goal.\n\n70\n00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.180\nAnd another classification.\n\n71\n00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.610\nSo we've got cyber criminals.\n\n72\n00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.030\nAnother classification\nwould be a hacktivist.\n\n73\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.299\nI remember when this term first came out.\n\n74\n00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.057\nAnd I was like,\n[SOUND] that's a funny term.\n\n75\n00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:14.820\nIt just kind of sounds fun to say.\n\n76\n00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.110\nYou're a hacktivist.\n\n77\n00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.350\nAnd most of us can probably figure out.\n\n78\n00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.017\nI forget the term for\nputting two words together.\n\n79\n00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:22.331\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n80\n00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.745\n&gt;&gt; Daniel is actually my English guy.\n\n81\n00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:25.245\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I usually would have something.\n\n82\n00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:26.158\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n83\n00:03:26.158 --> 00:03:26.873\n&gt;&gt; But I do.\n\n84\n00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:27.833\n&gt;&gt; I can't think of this one off the top\n\n85\n00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:29.156\nof my head.\n&gt;&gt; But it is.\n\n86\n00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:32.297\nIt's a combination of two words of\n\n87\n00:03:32.297 --> 00:03:38.480\nactivist and a hacker, a hacktivist,\nif I can say that correctly.\n\n88\n00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.140\nAnd from the term, it's one of\nthose that kind of defines itself.\n\n89\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.100\nA hacktivist, you can probably\nalready know what I'm going to say,\n\n90\n00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.440\nmotivated by social issues,\nthis is somebody that\n\n91\n00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.740\nis hacking for\nwhat they believe is a good reason.\n\n92\n00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.580\n&gt;&gt; So form of protest,\nthings of that nature.\n\n93\n00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n94\n00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.620\nThese are gonna be people that are\nconvinced that their behavior is actually\n\n95\n00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.520\nethical and not malicious.\n\n96\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.030\nI'm doing this for a very good reason.\n\n97\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.703\nI'm saving animals from\nbeing tested it against or-\n\n98\n00:04:12.703 --> 00:04:13.920\n&gt;&gt; I think of anonymous,\n\n99\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.251\nthey sent modems and things to country,\nI think it was Egypt,\n\n100\n00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:19.700\nduring that time when\nthey were blacked out.\n\n101\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.320\nThey couldn't get internet access and they\nwere showing them how to build VPNs and\n\n102\n00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.130\nuse the old phone systems to get\naccess to the rest of the world.\n\n103\n00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.590\nInstructions, the whole nine yards air\ndropping that stuff over there, so\n\n104\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.240\nthe people could basically because\ntheir government had shut them down.\n\n105\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.384\n&gt;&gt; So hacktivism, yeah.\n\n106\n00:04:34.384 --> 00:04:36.280\n&gt;&gt; So trying to bypass some of\nthat censorship, but exactly.\n\n107\n00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.910\nAnd they don't see themselves\nas doing anything wrong.\n\n108\n00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.175\nThey're helping these people.\n\n109\n00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:44.465\nBut now if you're the Egyptian government-\n&gt;&gt; You're a criminal in my case.\n\n110\n00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:47.755\n&gt;&gt; That's a whole completely different\nviews, it's about your perspective.\n\n111\n00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:50.545\nAnd that's the thing about hacktivists,\n\n112\n00:04:50.545 --> 00:04:53.755\nthey honestly believe that\nthey are doing right.\n\n113\n00:04:53.755 --> 00:04:56.077\nThey are righting some wrong,\n\n114\n00:04:56.077 --> 00:05:00.913\nthey're like that knight in shining armor,\nor whatever it is.\n\n115\n00:05:00.913 --> 00:05:03.483\nThey're gonna come in and\nmake the world right again.\n\n116\n00:05:03.483 --> 00:05:07.251\nBut it's their opinion and\ntheir views, so.\n\n117\n00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:11.070\nUsually they're very personally committed.\n\n118\n00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.300\nYou take those people that are against\na particular governmental practice or,\n\n119\n00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.640\nlike anonymous with the routers.\n\n120\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.160\nThey firmly believe that those\npeople in Egypt should have a right\n\n121\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.520\nto see the Internet and\n\n122\n00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.550\nget to the Internet, that's not\nbeing censored by their government.\n\n123\n00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.150\nSo in their minds,\nthey're doing nothing wrong and\n\n124\n00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.980\nthey're benefitting the people of Egypt.\n\n125\n00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.280\nAnd that's the idea behind a hacktivist,\nand because of that, they're typically\n\n126\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.575\nvery committed, they believe in what\nthey're doing and they'll quit their job.\n\n127\n00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:48.066\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They'll forego the rest of\n\n128\n00:05:48.066 --> 00:05:48.922\ntheir families.\n\n129\n00:05:48.922 --> 00:05:49.792\n&gt;&gt; True believers.\n\n130\n00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:52.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is what they do.\n\n131\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.530\nAnd so because they're so committed,\nthey can be very dangerous.\n\n132\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.140\nNow, hacktivist doesn't really\ninfer any type of skillset.\n\n133\n00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.290\nYou could have a script kitty,\nthat's a hacktivist.\n\n134\n00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.794\nYou could have a professional hacker,\nthat's a hacktivist.\n\n135\n00:06:07.794 --> 00:06:12.706\nSo it doesn't imply any type of skillset,\nit's more about\n\n136\n00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:17.830\nyour motivation, but\nit is a classification of an attacker.\n\n137\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.230\nAgain, convinced their behavior\nis ethical and not malicious, and\n\n138\n00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.970\nthese are the people that I mean,\nit almost drives you crazy.\n\n139\n00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.150\nYou're talking to them or\nyou're seeing them in a court case and\n\n140\n00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.140\nthey're still standing by their belief,\neven though they're getting ready to get\n\n141\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.383\nsentence for years in jail cuz everybody\nelse see what they were doing was wrong.\n\n142\n00:06:38.383 --> 00:06:40.838\nThey're still out there saying,\n\n143\n00:06:40.838 --> 00:06:44.290\nin their minds they don't see that\nthey have done anything wrong.\n\n144\n00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.350\nThey're completely fine\nwith what they've done.\n\n145\n00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.579\nCould be solo,\ncould be individual that just has this\n\n146\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.730\nbattle that they wanna fight and\nthey feel strongly for.\n\n147\n00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.400\nIt could be a group of people, like\nanonymous, like you said, is a perfect\n\n148\n00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.530\nexample of a group of hacktivist,\nthat have come together for common goals.\n\n149\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.030\nAnd when you get in a group like that\none of the things that's the benefit,\n\n150\n00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.500\nlike if I'm a hacktivist and I want to\n\n151\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.950\nattack people that use animals in\nthe wrong ways, or whatever it is.\n\n152\n00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.020\n&gt;&gt; Some vivisection company or\nsomething like that.\n\n153\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.710\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n154\n00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.450\nIf I do that on my own,\nI might not be successful, but\n\n155\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.450\nI also face all the risk on my own.\n\n156\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:31.514\nBy getting into a group, I kind of\nget a little anonymity from that.\n\n157\n00:07:31.514 --> 00:07:35.330\nI'm not the face of the attack.\n\n158\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.970\nI'm just one of the guys that happened to\nwrite one of the scripts that might be\n\n159\n00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.970\nused or help.\n\n160\n00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.060\nSo, you see a lot of people getting\ninto groups because of that.\n\n161\n00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.746\nThey firmly believe in their cause, but\n\n162\n00:07:43.746 --> 00:07:46.680\nthey're also not quite willing to\ngo out on that ledge by themselves.\n\n163\n00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.524\n&gt;&gt; Well, and that protects them, as well\nbecause if Mike and I are a group and\n\n164\n00:07:50.524 --> 00:07:53.200\nMike writes a script,\nbut I actually use it.\n\n165\n00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.250\nMike doesn't go to jail for\nwriting scripts.\n\n166\n00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.672\nI go to jail for\nusing scripts in a malicious way.\n\n167\n00:07:57.672 --> 00:08:00.291\nAnd hopefully you kept your mouth shut and\ndidn't tell them my name.\n\n168\n00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:03.550\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] So that is one of the\nadvantages that the hackers get when they\n\n179\n00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:29.822\njoin groups like that is a little\nbit of anonymity for them.\n\n180\n00:08:29.822 --> 00:08:31.413\nThat's the idea anyway.\n\n181\n00:08:31.413 --> 00:08:32.866\nAll right, so we've got our hacktivist.\n\n182\n00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:36.124\nSomebody that's attacking typically for\npolitical or\n\n183\n00:08:36.124 --> 00:08:39.807\nsocial motivations,\nfirmly believe in what they're doing.\n\n184\n00:08:39.807 --> 00:08:42.845\nThen you've got state sponsored hackers.\n\n185\n00:08:42.845 --> 00:08:47.509\nA state sponsored hacker,\nemployed by an individual nation or\n\n186\n00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:53.405\npotentially a group of nations coming\ntogether to hire or provide this person or\n\n187\n00:08:53.405 --> 00:08:57.816\ngroup of people the ability to\nperform some type of attack.\n\n188\n00:08:57.816 --> 00:09:01.095\n&gt;&gt; I think stucksnet is just the first\nthing that jumps out of my mind.\n\n189\n00:09:01.095 --> 00:09:04.997\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, with the whole nuclear plants and\nthings like that, which I think we might,\n\n190\n00:09:04.997 --> 00:09:07.926\nthe US [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] The facts\n\n191\n00:09:07.926 --> 00:09:10.643\nare the facts, everyone knows.\n\n192\n00:09:10.643 --> 00:09:12.796\n[LAUGH] Not here to point fingers.\n\n193\n00:09:12.796 --> 00:09:14.051\n&gt;&gt; No, just saying.\n\n194\n00:09:14.051 --> 00:09:20.458\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, that would be a great example\nof state sponsored hackers, right.\n\n195\n00:09:20.458 --> 00:09:24.638\nBecause as a country or\na nation, I have an agenda and\n\n196\n00:09:24.638 --> 00:09:28.818\nI've got people that live\nin my nation that will do,\n\n197\n00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:32.255\nthey've got, what's a good word for it?\n\n198\n00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:32.984\n&gt;&gt; A way of life?\n\n199\n00:09:32.984 --> 00:09:35.053\nYeah, they're what's\nthe term I'm looking for?\n\n200\n00:09:35.053 --> 00:09:41.022\nThey're proud to support their country,\nright?\n\n201\n00:09:41.022 --> 00:09:41.587\n&gt;&gt; So patriots.\n&gt;&gt; Patriot,\n\n202\n00:09:41.587 --> 00:09:43.056\nthere that's the word I'm looking for.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n203\n00:09:43.056 --> 00:09:45.311\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that patriotism.\n\n204\n00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:48.907\nIt would be an honor if my government came\nto me and said, hey we wanna put your\n\n205\n00:09:48.907 --> 00:09:52.865\nhacking skills to use to attack this other\ncountry to benefit our country, right?\n\n206\n00:09:52.865 --> 00:09:55.385\nWhether that's right or wrong,\n\n207\n00:09:55.385 --> 00:10:00.789\nthere's again that belief that what\nI'm doing is for the better good.\n\n208\n00:10:00.789 --> 00:10:05.020\n&gt;&gt; Right, and when it comes to\ngovernments, it typically does come down\n\n209\n00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.178\nto the fact that they all kind of seem\nto fall on this side of the fence,\n\n210\n00:10:09.178 --> 00:10:12.422\nwhich is all's fair in love and\nwar, specifically.\n\n211\n00:10:12.422 --> 00:10:16.093\nIf you are a enemy of my nation's state,\nthen anything I try to do, well,\n\n212\n00:10:16.093 --> 00:10:17.529\nyou've got to expect that.\n\n213\n00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:19.945\n&gt;&gt;

For sure, for sure but there is one\nmore category I want to mention and\n\n256\n00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:46.437\nthat was cyber terrorists\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n257\n00:12:46.437 --> 00:12:48.250\n&gt;&gt; And\nthis is one that I think most of us,\n\n258\n00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.621\nagain it's one of those terms where\nI think we get it right off the bat.\n\n259\n00:12:51.621 --> 00:12:54.729\nBecause of the news,\nbecause of things we've seen, and\n\n260\n00:12:54.729 --> 00:12:57.200\nwe've heard that word before, terrorist.\n\n261\n00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.529\nAnd now we're just throwing\ncyber in front of it.\n\n262\n00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.941\nWhich we've been doing with a lot\nof words lately it seems like.\n\n263\n00:13:02.941 --> 00:13:04.373\nThere's cyber breakfast I think.\n\n264\n00:13:04.373 --> 00:13:04.910\n&gt;&gt; Cyber landscaping.\n\n265\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.501\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cyber landscaping.\n\n266\n00:13:07.501 --> 00:13:09.152\nMan your house looks good online.\n\n267\n00:13:09.152 --> 00:13:13.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Photoshop.\n\n268\n00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:17.762\n&gt;&gt; But cyber terrorist,\nit is a controversial term because\n\n269\n00:13:17.762 --> 00:13:22.298\nwhat's considered terrorism\nby one group of people or\n\n270\n00:13:22.298 --> 00:13:25.462\nentity may not be from the other side.\n\n271\n00:13:25.462 --> 00:13:28.990\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that George Washington\nwas considered a terrorist by somebody.\n\n272\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:34.391\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, the British, to them,\nhe was a terrorist, right?\n\n273\n00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:38.509\nBut to the people befre the U.S.\nthere you know to us.\n\n274\n00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:39.261\n&gt;&gt; He was a patriot.\n\n275\n00:13:39.261 --> 00:13:40.341\n&gt;&gt; He was a patriot, right.\n\n276\n00:13:40.341 --> 00:13:44.213\nHe was that hacktivist in this\ncase that was standing up for\n\n277\n00:13:44.213 --> 00:13:46.353\ngood and justice of the people.\n\n278\n00:13:46.353 --> 00:13:48.967\nSo it is a controversial term,\nkeep that in mind.\n\n279\n00:13:48.967 --> 00:13:52.249\nCyberterrorism really depends\non your point of view.\n\n280\n00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:55.029\n&gt;&gt; Seems very similar to hacktivism.\n\n281\n00:13:55.029 --> 00:13:59.562\nExactly, and it's really about\nattacking systems for damage and fear.\n\n282\n00:13:59.562 --> 00:14:01.945\nJust like we talk about\nthe word terrorism.\n\n283\n00:14:01.945 --> 00:14:08.168\nIt is designed to have big consequences,\nfar reaching damage,\n\n284\n00:14:08.168 --> 00:14:13.469\nand instill fear in whoever\nthe victim of the crime is,\n\n285\n00:14:13.469 --> 00:14:17.516\noften motivated by political purposes.\n\n286\n00:14:17.516 --> 00:14:18.793\nSo that would be,\n\n287\n00:14:18.793 --> 00:14:24.085\nagain we go back to the whole now late\nin the news right now is here in the US.\n\n288\n00:14:24.085 --> 00:14:28.839\nThere's question whether or not an outside\norganization might have influenced one of\n\n289\n00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:31.977\nour elections here by hacking,\nexposing information.\n\n290\n00:14:31.977 --> 00:14:35.941\nThat could be considered cyber terrorism.\n\n291\n00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:40.339\nAll right, so\nthose are going to be the different types\n\n292\n00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:43.406\nof threat actors that we have to face.\n\n293\n00:14:43.406 --> 00:14:47.629\nAnd by understanding that,\nby understanding the different types of\n\n294\n00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:51.267\nthreat actors that we face,\nwe can curtail our security and\n\n295\n00:14:51.267 --> 00:14:55.783\nour security implementation to,\nhopefully control that efficiently,\n\n296\n00:14:55.783 --> 00:14:58.722\nI guess would be a good way to say it,\nall right.\n\n297\n00:14:58.722 --> 00:15:01.965\nIf we, what's an example here.\n\n298\n00:15:01.965 --> 00:15:07.589\nLet's say I was a hair salon,\nall right and I've got a website.\n\n299\n00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:08.292\n&gt;&gt; Interesting choice.\n\n300\n00:15:08.292 --> 00:15:10.084\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n[LAUGH] I don't know where that\n\n301\n00:15:10.084 --> 00:15:10.745\ncame in mind.\n\n302\n00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:16.214\nBut let's say I'm a hair salon, and\nI've got a web front for my hair salon.\n\n303\n00:15:16.214 --> 00:15:19.797\nWhat kind of threat\nactors am I gonna face?\n\n304\n00:15:19.797 --> 00:15:23.047\nWell, more than likely it's going to be\nanother hair salon that wants to take\n\n305\n00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:26.298\nme down because it's a very competitive\nworld out there in the world of online\n\n306\n00:15:26.298 --> 00:15:26.916\nhair salons.\n\n307\n00:15:26.916 --> 00:15:28.252\n&gt;&gt; They raw.\n\n308\n00:15:28.252 --> 00:15:28.813\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n\n309\n00:15:28.813 --> 00:15:30.340\n&gt;&gt; Rough people [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They don't play.\n\n310\n00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They have scissors and they run.\n\n311\n00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.315\nSo am I worried about\nstate-sponsored hacking?\n\n312\n00:15:37.315 --> 00:15:39.354\nAs a hair salon, probably not.\n\n313\n00:15:39.354 --> 00:15:42.824\nNo cyber terrorism to protect against.\n\n314\n00:15:42.824 --> 00:15:46.931\nBut I do have some personally identifiable\ninformation, so cyber criminals might\n\n315\n00:15:46.931 --> 00:15:50.935\nbe trying to get access to my database of\ncustomer information and credit cards.\n\n316\n00:15:50.935 --> 00:15:54.889\nOther organizations, other hair salons,\nwant to steal my clientele, they might.\n\n317\n00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:58.627\nSo by looking at our information and\nunderstanding who\n\n318\n00:15:58.627 --> 00:16:03.177\nare the threat actors that we\nare going to face more often than not,\n\n319\n00:16:03.177 --> 00:16:07.172\nhelps me design a secure system and\nprotect against that.\n\n320\n00:16:07.172 --> 00:16:11.101\nAll right, so now to what Daniel\nwas leading into is threat motives.\n\n321\n00:16:11.101 --> 00:16:16.556\nAnother area that we can kind\nof create classifications so\n\n322\n00:16:16.556 --> 00:16:24.032\nthat we can help refine and improve our\nsecurity and our response to the crimes.\n\n323\n00:16:24.032 --> 00:16:29.041\nUnderstanding what the motivation is for\nthe threat actors.\n\n324\n00:16:29.041 --> 00:16:31.353\nWhy are they doing what they're doing?\n\n325\n00:16:31.353 --> 00:16:34.308\nAnd really when we talk\nabout threat motives,\n\n326\n00:16:34.308 --> 00:16:39.025\nwe're talking about the overarching\nreason for the attack, all right?\n\n327\n00:16:39.025 --> 00:16:41.172\nFor example,\nit could be a desire for money.\n\n328\n00:16:41.172 --> 00:16:47.956\nAnd honestly, this is probably the most\ncommon means or motive for attack.\n\n329\n00:16:47.956 --> 00:16:49.887\nIt is the desire for money.\n\n330\n00:16:49.887 --> 00:16:53.986\nThis is where your cyber\ncriminals are gonna come in.\n\n331\n00:16:53.986 --> 00:16:58.288\nIt might be that it's a direct\nattack that's gonna result in money,\n\n332\n00:16:58.288 --> 00:17:03.185\nlike me going to a financial institution,\nbreaking in, getting accounts and\n\n333\n00:17:03.185 --> 00:17:06.598\nbeing able to transfer money\nto an offshore account and\n\n334\n00:17:06.598 --> 00:17:10.115\ntry to steal that money, so\nit could be a direct attack.\n\n335\n00:17:10.115 --> 00:17:13.498\n&gt;&gt; Cyber crime does not pay in\nanything other than Bitcoin.\n\n336\n00:17:13.498 --> 00:17:16.483\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n337\n00:17:16.483 --> 00:17:19.903\nIt also could be an indirect attack.\n\n338\n00:17:19.903 --> 00:17:24.967\nRather than stealing money directly,\nlike going to a financial institution and\n\n339\n00:17:24.967 --> 00:17:29.446\nmoving funds, I might be stealing\ninformation from an organization.\n\n340\n00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:32.585\nAnd then selling that information\nto a rival organization or\n\n341\n00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:35.488\nto somebody that could benefit\nfrom that information.\n\n342\n00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:40.936\nSo indirectly, my desire is money,\nbut I'm not stealing money.\n\n343\n00:17:40.936 --> 00:17:44.692\nI'm stealing something that I know\nis of value to somebody else, and\n\n344\n00:17:44.692 --> 00:17:47.102\nI can turn around and\nsell it and make money.\n\n345\n00:17:47.102 --> 00:17:52.494\nSo probably, like I said, almost,\nmost attacks come back to the desire for\n\n346\n00:17:52.494 --> 00:17:55.629\nmoney, whether it's direct or indirect.\n\n347\n00:17:55.629 --> 00:18:00.189\nWe can also have the desire for\npower, everybody wants power.\n\n348\n00:18:00.189 --> 00:18:03.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a powerful,\n\n349\n00:18:03.951 --> 00:18:08.994\npardon the pun, a powerful motivation for\na lot of attackers.\n\n350\n00:18:08.994 --> 00:18:15.558\nThat cyber terrorist wants to be able\ninstill that fear, cause that damage.\n\n351\n00:18:15.558 --> 00:18:20.438\nThey get a sense of power knowing that\nthey brought down an entire organization,\n\n352\n00:18:20.438 --> 00:18:24.097\nor they brought a financial\ninstitution to their knees, and\n\n353\n00:18:24.097 --> 00:18:27.560\nthey had to pay them money to\ndecrypt their information.\n\n354\n00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.694\nThat's a sense of power\nthat I have over them.\n\n355\n00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:35.571\nThey're this big organization,\nyet they're bowing to my demands.\n\n356\n00:18:35.571 --> 00:18:38.584\n[COUGH] Insiders,\n\n357\n00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:43.475\nagain, a sense of power, you treat\nme like a little peon and yet I just\n\n358\n00:18:43.475 --> 00:18:46.615\nsold all your customer information to-\n&gt;&gt; Now who's the peon?\n\n359\n00:18:46.615 --> 00:18:47.205\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n360\n00:18:47.205 --> 00:18:48.955\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna get back at you.\n\n361\n00:18:48.955 --> 00:18:53.004\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's that sense\nof power that we might get.\n\n362\n00:18:53.004 --> 00:18:56.680\nPeople that are after\npower are often reckless.\n\n363\n00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.360\nAnd because they're not thinking clearly,\nor\n\n364\n00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:07.970\ntheir motivation is power so they-\n&gt;&gt; Ego has clouded their judgment, per se.\n\n365\n00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.731\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, their better judgement\nmight be compromised and so\n\n366\n00:19:10.731 --> 00:19:14.730\nthey're willing to take risks that maybe\nthey shouldn't that's going to lead to,\n\n367\n00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.179\nhopefully, their capture,\nor their discovery.\n\n368\n00:19:17.179 --> 00:19:20.896\nSo one of the nice things about people\nthat are motivated by power is they can\n\n369\n00:19:20.896 --> 00:19:21.670\nget reckless.\n\n370\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:27.300\nThey can set off alarms,\nmaybe,hopefully, we can detect them.\n\n371\n00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:32.350\nReputation and recognition,\nthis is another big motivator for\n\n372\n00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.640\nthe threat actors.\n\n373\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.740\nI want to be recognized\nas a skilled hacker.\n\n374\n00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.520\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, absolutely.\n\n535\n00:28:46.271 --> 00:28:49.600\nWe both make the same thing,\nwe got same pricing point.\n\n536\n00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.728\nYet their profit margins\nare much higher than mine.\n\n537\n00:28:51.728 --> 00:28:52.733\nWhat are we doing wrong?\n\n538\n00:28:52.733 --> 00:28:54.970\nLet me find that secret\nthat they're using.\n\n539\n00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.811\nSo that'd be an example of\nindustrial type espionage.\n\n540\n00:28:58.811 --> 00:29:05.709\nAnd that's another intent is to steal\nthis other industry's information.\n\n541\n00:29:05.709 --> 00:29:09.541\nRevenge is another big, big intent, right?\n\n542\n00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:13.710\nIn the end,\nI want to right a perceived wrong.\n\n543\n00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.638\nNow revenge is typically something\nthat will probably fit in many of\n\n544\n00:29:18.638 --> 00:29:20.890\nthese different categories.\n\n545\n00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:25.200\nIt's almost like a,\nI don't wanna say a side intent.\n\n546\n00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.220\nBut it's a bonus intent.\n\n547\n00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:33.210\nOr revenge was my initial intent but\nthen, espionage becomes the intent.\n\n548\n00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:38.350\nAnd out of it, I get revenge on the\norganization because I was hired away or\n\n549\n00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:41.730\nI'll say this industry fired me,\nthis organization fired me.\n\n550\n00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.630\nI went to another organization\nin the same industry and\n\n551\n00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.190\nI'm gonna help them perform espionage,\nright?\n\n552\n00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:52.620\nSo the intent might be espionage from\nthis new organization standpoint, but\n\n553\n00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.010\nfrom my standpoint is revenge, right?\n\n554\n00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.819\nThat's what I'm getting out of it, is I'm\ngonna help this new organization take\n\n555\n00:29:57.819 --> 00:29:59.702\ndown, or steal secrets,\nfrom the old organization.\n\n556\n00:29:59.702 --> 00:30:05.310\n&gt;&gt; And what's funny is it's probably one\nof the more strong motivations, right?\n\n557\n00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:09.749\nEven though there's not a whole lot to it,\nyou did me wrong, it can really\n\n558\n00:30:09.749 --> 00:30:14.950\nmotivate someone to perform an action\nagainst another individual or company.\n\n559\n00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.600\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and sometimes it's\nif you've got a group of hackers,\n\n560\n00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.820\nlike let's say state sponsored, and\n\n561\n00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:26.370\nthey've gathered up a team that they wanna\nuse for this attack that they're planning.\n\n562\n00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.950\nTheir intent might be, as a government,\n\n563\n00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:34.464\ntheir intent might be\nagainst another government.\n\n564\n00:30:34.464 --> 00:30:38.271\nBut the individuals within that group,\nthey might be leveraging the fact that\n\n565\n00:30:38.271 --> 00:30:41.386\nthat person really has a problem\nwith this other organization,\n\n566\n00:30:41.386 --> 00:30:42.666\nwith this other company.\n\n567\n00:30:42.666 --> 00:30:45.709\nSo I'm gonna take Daniel's revenge and\n\n568\n00:30:45.709 --> 00:30:50.430\nuse that help him to motivate\nmy intent as a nation, right?\n\n569\n00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.967\nSo, again,\nyou see some crossover there where it\n\n570\n00:30:53.967 --> 00:30:57.937\nmight be different intents\nwithin the attack, right?\n\n571\n00:30:57.937 --> 00:31:01.739\nI'm not willing to do it for your reasons,\nbut because I hate that country and\n\n572\n00:31:01.739 --> 00:31:02.801\nwhat they've done.\n\n573\n00:31:02.801 --> 00:31:04.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n574\n00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.901\n&gt;&gt; Well, okay, I'm gonna go ahead and\njoin forces with you and\n\n575\n00:31:07.901 --> 00:31:10.835\nthrow my skill set in to get my revenge,\nokay?\n\n576\n00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:12.323\nDefamation of character is another one.\n\n577\n00:31:12.323 --> 00:31:13.387\n&gt;&gt; That's a fun one.\n[LAUGH]\n\n578\n00:31:13.387 --> 00:31:16.663\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is one that's, again,\n\n579\n00:31:16.663 --> 00:31:19.510\nkind of falls back to revenge.\n\n580\n00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.408\nI want to make Daniel look like a fool.\n\n581\n00:31:22.408 --> 00:31:25.816\nI want to make him look\nbad in the public eye.\n\n582\n00:31:25.816 --> 00:31:31.998\nI'm doing it for revenge, but my intent\nis to deform his or deface his character.\n\n583\n00:31:31.998 --> 00:31:34.240\n&gt;&gt; So again, going back to our cogs.\n\n584\n00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.700\nWe're both in the same business.\n\n585\n00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.023\nIf I've stolen Mike's secrets,\nI've done espionage, awesome.\n\n586\n00:31:39.023 --> 00:31:41.038\nWell, Mike can come right back and\ngo, well,\n\n587\n00:31:41.038 --> 00:31:42.957\nDaniel clubs baby fur\nseals on the weekend.\n\n588\n00:31:42.957 --> 00:31:46.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I don't do that.\n\n589\n00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.080\nProbably I don't.\n\n590\n00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.340\nHence the defamation of character.\n\n591\n00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.741\nHe's just putting it out there that I\ndo things that most people will find\n\n592\n00:31:53.741 --> 00:31:56.263\nreprehensible, so\nthat you just won't buy from me.\n\n593\n00:31:56.263 --> 00:31:58.048\nAnd increase Mike's profit margins.\n\n594\n00:31:58.048 --> 00:31:59.768\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n595\n00:31:59.768 --> 00:32:03.008\nAnd it's a great point too\nabout whether it's true,\n\n596\n00:32:03.008 --> 00:32:08.052\nbecause when it comes to defamation of\ncharacter Doesn't really matter, right?\n\n597\n00:32:08.052 --> 00:32:10.944\nBecause now I'm putting the owners\non them to try to prove it wrong,\n\n598\n00:32:10.944 --> 00:32:11.770\nif it's not true.\n\n599\n00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:17.860\nDid I compromise Daniel's emails and\nsee him purchase that ticket to get on\n\n600\n00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.420\nthat cruise ship to go up there\nwhere those baby seals there and\n\n601\n00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.380\nstart clubbing them and\npush that information out?\n\n602\n00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.510\nOr did I just make it\nup out of the thin air?\n\n603\n00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.850\nDoes it matter?\n\n604\n00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.410\nAll right?\nYou know in the political arena we see\n\n605\n00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:34.330\nthis all the time, especially here in\nthe states I'm sure everywhere else.\n\n606\n00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.910\nYou know this political\nperson is doing a campaign,\n\n607\n00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:41.840\na commercial or what have you and\nthey're saying how this other person\n\n608\n00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.250\nvoted against this nine time out of ten,\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n609\n00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:47.040\nIs it true, is it not.\n\n610\n00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.160\nDoes it matter?\n\n611\n00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.180\nBecause a lot of people\nwon't go any further and\n\n612\n00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.860\ndo their own research to\nverify what you just said.\n\n613\n00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:56.640\n&gt;&gt; They planted the seed and now it's\ngonna bloom and blossom all itself.\n\n614\n00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.150\n&gt;&gt; With today's social media, you see\nwe've talked about this very thing.\n\n615\n00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:01.730\n&gt;&gt; Many times.\n\n616\n00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:06.700\n&gt;&gt; Several times, how people will take\ninformation that they found, somewhere,\n\n617\n00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:11.330\nand just re-post it as fact and\nno checking, no nothing, like my gosh,\n\n618\n00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.620\ncan you believe what this person is doing.\n\n619\n00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.910\nWhere did you get that information?\n\n620\n00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:15.720\nOver here.\n\n621\n00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.600\nWell, they took one word here,\none word here, and\n\n622\n00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.510\none word here, from somebody's\nlong statement, and made it look.\n\n623\n00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:25.200\nSo, it's when it comes to defamation\nof character, whether it's true or\n\n624\n00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.240\nnot, it can still pretty\na far reaching effect.\n\n625\n00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.130\nSo spreading information can also\nbe a form of sabotage, right.\n\n626\n00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:42.565\nIf I can Daniel, does the word,\nI don't wanna deform you.\n\n627\n00:33:42.565 --> 00:33:44.110\n&gt;&gt;

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.344\nWelcome to ITPRO.TV.\n\n2\n00:00:01.344 --> 00:00:06.596\nI'm your host [CROSSTALK].\n\n3\n00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:08.341\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:12.030\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.560\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n6\n00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.610\ngreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.670\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nwe are back with another\n\n8\n00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.690\nin our series on the logical operations\nof cybersecurity first responders.\n\n9\n00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.030\nAnd of course joining us back,\n\n10\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.300\nwe're coming at you with part\nthree on threat intents.\n\n11\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.250\nThat is our good friend Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.180\nMike, welcome back.\n\n13\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.240\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.500\nAnd yeah, we've got more to go,\nright, with intent.\n\n15\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.150\nThere's so many different intents.\n\n16\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.140\nAnd in the end, remember,\nwe're talking about threat profiles.\n\n17\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.550\nWhich we're gonna kinda tie\nin at the very end here.\n\n18\n00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.390\nSo let's continue on.\n\n19\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.040\nWe were talking about different intents.\n\n20\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.320\nWhat is their ultimate goal.\n\n21\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.780\nWe've talked about the actors,\nwho they are,\n\n22\n00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.980\ntrying to classify them script kiddie,\nprofessional, cyber terrorist.\n\n23\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.120\nWe talked about their motivation,\nwhat is their motivating factor.\n\n24\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.860\nIs it money, is it fame, and\nfortune and that kind of thing.\n\n25\n00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.500\nAnd their intent is that ultimate goal\nof what they would like the outcome,\n\n26\n00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.760\nthe end result to be.\n\n27\n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.180\nAnd I showed you how intent and\n\n28\n00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.690\nmotive are very similar,\nsometimes hard to distinguish between.\n\n29\n00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.690\nBut the intent is that the ultimate goal\n\n30\n00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.520\nwhere my motivation might be revenge.\n\n31\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.380\nBut the goal of the attack is defacing\nyour company in the public view, so\n\n32\n00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.850\nthat we can differentiate like that.\n\n33\n00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.720\nSo we left off talking about\ndeformation of character,\n\n34\n00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.360\nthe next thing I want\ntalk about is blackmail.\n\n35\n00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.806\nAnother one of our major\nintents is the blackmail.\n\n36\n00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:51.290\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a subcategory of profit or\nmoney motivation.\n\n37\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes, or a subcategory of revenge even.\n\n38\n00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.170\nSo they all start, again,\nblurring together there.\n\n39\n00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.830\nBut understanding generally\nthat blackmail is typically,\n\n40\n00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.650\nyou're gonna get information that\nsomebody does not want exposed or\n\n41\n00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.360\nthat an organization that that\ninformation is proprietary.\n\n42\n00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.090\nAnd I don't want it exposed.\n\n43\n00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.600\nI get a hold of that information.\n\n44\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.820\nI'm now gonna hold it over your head and\ntry to use that as leverage to get\n\n45\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.810\nmoney or whatever the case\nmay be from an organization.\n\n46\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.020\nSo it can be for revenge.\n\n47\n00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.610\nIt could be for monetary gain.\n\n48\n00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.692\nAgain, I get that email of Daniel's\nconfirmation of ticket for the seabess.\n\n49\n00:02:34.692 --> 00:02:35.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n50\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.040\n&gt;&gt; I can't even say it.\n\n51\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.322\n&gt;&gt; Couldn't get it out,\n\n52\n00:02:37.322 --> 00:02:37.865\ncan you.\n\n53\n00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:38.645\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:39.870\n&gt;&gt; Can't even say it.\n\n55\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.200\nBut trying to get information about,\n\n56\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.610\nmaybe I catch Daniel\nin a compromising act.\n\n57\n00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.370\nI've got a photographic evidence.\n\n58\n00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.550\nThis is now something that\nI could hold over him.\n\n59\n00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.860\nSay, I will release this if you\ndon't give me that promotion or\n\n60\n00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.890\nshut down your website and\nstop doing this practice or give me money.\n\n61\n00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.370\nSo you see I'm pulling in multiple\nmotives but that same intent.\n\n62\n00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.000\nSo kind of draw a little\nbit of gray there.\n\n63\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.365\nBut typically comes from\na breach in communication media,\n\n64\n00:03:15.365 --> 00:03:20.650\nwhether that's email,\nphone calls, paper mail.\n\n65\n00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.850\nI get that information.\n\n66\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.200\nIt's information that shouldn't\nhave been disclosed to me.\n\n67\n00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.919\nBut through my efforts I've been able to\ncompromise Daniel's web mail account.\n\n68\n00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.431\nI can now get his emails.\n\n69\n00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:35.270\nI can get, he should have put\nthat in an email he knew better.\n\n70\n00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.360\nBut now I've got that email and\nI can use it to blackmail him.\n\n71\n00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.470\nHey pay me this.\n\n72\n00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.630\nStep down from the organization,\notherwise I will release this information.\n\n73\n00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.900\nIt might be better for you to go ahead and\nstep down rather than deal with\n\n74\n00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.050\nthe repercussions of the information\nthat I'm getting ready to release.\n\n75\n00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.150\nSo can use blackmail for several purposes.\n\n76\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.340\nAnother one would be, when we're\ntalking about intent, activism, or\n\n77\n00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.730\npolitical, again this can be the end\ngoal as well as the motivator.\n\n78\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.110\nWe saw this in both categories.\n\n79\n00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.280\nWe saw activism as a threat\nactor classification.\n\n80\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.100\nSee how this term kind of goes\nacross the borders there.\n\n81\n00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.090\nRaise awareness of the cause\nthat they are fighting for.\n\n82\n00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.060\nNow that maybe my intent,\nis I'm doing this\n\n83\n00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.140\nbecause my motive was the fact that\nI don't like cruelty to animals.\n\n84\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.690\nSo my motive is to protect those\nlittle rabbits that you're testing on.\n\n85\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.190\nMy overall intent might be to stop them\nfrom performing those types of actions.\n\n86\n00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.180\nSo it could be for\na reason, for hacktivism.\n\n87\n00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.590\nIt could be political.\n\n88\n00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.750\nI want revenge against this country,\nthis nation.\n\n89\n00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.260\nBut my overall intent\nis to get the word out,\n\n90\n00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.330\nthat this country is\nperforming these actions.\n\n91\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.000\nNow, the rest of the world knows about it\nand maybe I can get more done against it.\n\n92\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.810\nOr to prevent it or to stop it,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n93\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.860\nSo raise awareness of\nthe cause you're fighting for.\n\n94\n00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.330\nA lot of time the idea is to\ncause a denial of service.\n\n95\n00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.430\nWhere I can prevent people from accessing\nyour site and ordering your product.\n\n96\n00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.460\nOr accessing your site and you being able\nto disseminate this bad information.\n\n97\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.870\nYou know I can stop you from that.\n\n98\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.380\nDoxing is a term that kind of falls\nwithin this as a subcategory.\n\n99\n00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.951\nWould be practice of publishing\npersonally identifiable.\n\n100\n00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:32.324\nIf I can say this.\n\n101\n00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:33.087\nSlow down.\n\n102\n00:05:33.087 --> 00:05:38.350\nPersonally identifiable information\nabout individuals online.\n\n103\n00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.160\nSo, maybe I have\ncompromised some personally\n\n104\n00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.600\nidentifiable information, my goal where my\n\n105\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.810\nmotive was to access this personal\ninformation that I know this company has.\n\n106\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.020\nMy overall intent was then to take the\ninformation that I got and publish it and\n\n107\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.770\nmake it available.\n\n108\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.170\nThat would be doxing,\n\n109\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.480\npublishing personally identifiable\ninformation about individuals online.\n\n110\n00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.400\nSo lots of different intents.\n\n111\n00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.790\nWe've talked about actors,\nmotives, and intents.\n\n112\n00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.780\nLet's talk about attack vectors next.\n\n113\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.800\nAnd really an attack vector is simply\nthe method that the attack takes.\n\n114\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.360\nWhat was the means of comprising.\n\n115\n00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.960\nHow did you get into the system to access\nthat personally identifiable information\n\n116\n00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.140\nor to access that secret formula\nthat you're going to steal.\n\n117\n00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.740\nHow did you get in.\n\n118\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.290\nWhat was the avenue of attack.\n\n119\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.100\nAnd that's really what an attack\nvector is, is the avenue of attack.\n\n120\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.980\nMethod that an attack takes is\nthe actual definition they wanna use.\n\n121\n00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.760\nTypically, an attack\nvector is a vulnerability.\n\n122\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.060\nIt's a hole within the system,\nor within your network,\n\n123\n00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.710\nthat somebody is gonna try to leverage,\nor take advantage of.\n\n124\n00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.890\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, there would necessarily have\nto be some sort of vulnerability for\n\n125\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.435\nan attack to even tech list, correct.\n\n126\n00:07:04.435 --> 00:07:05.185\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n127\n00:07:05.185 --> 00:07:07.805\nAnd this is what worries\na security professional,\n\n128\n00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:11.655\nwhat we're always trying to minimize,\nis what we call our attack surface.\n\n129\n00:07:11.655 --> 00:07:16.465\nWe're trying to reduce the number of\nattack vectors that we are exposed to or\n\n130\n00:07:16.465 --> 00:07:20.365\nwe have exposed,\nthereby minimizing or reducing\n\n131\n00:07:20.365 --> 00:07:24.990\nthe likelihood of somebody attacking or\nbeing successful in their attack.\n\n132\n00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.100\nSo, attack vector, again,\nmethod that an attack takes.\n\n133\n00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.055\nWe're talking about vulnerabilities, as I\nsaid, holes within your system or network.\n\n134\n00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:36.310\nVulnerability can be caused\nby different things.\n\n135\n00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.840\nIt could be a vulnerability in, let's say,\nsoftware that you've implemented.\n\n136\n00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.342\nUnbeknownst to you,\nthis software has a vulnerability.\n\n137\n00:07:45.342 --> 00:07:49.737\nAnd if somebody does a certain set\nof steps or combination of steps,\n\n138\n00:07:49.737 --> 00:07:51.904\nthey can take advantage of that.\n\n139\n00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.736\nCould be within a system.\n\n140\n00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:57.340\nYou know, a misconfiguration\ncan lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n141\n00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.412\nLeaving a blank or\na weak password on an administrator or\n\n142\n00:08:02.412 --> 00:08:05.738\na default password on\nan administrative account for\n\n143\n00:08:05.738 --> 00:08:09.382\na device or for a system,\nthat would be a vulnerability.\n\n144\n00:08:09.382 --> 00:08:15.140\nMisconfiguration of my firewall rules\ncould leave us with a vulnerability there.\n\n145\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.988\nNow, we're vulnerable to attacks,\nso against a system or a network.\n\n146\n00:08:19.988 --> 00:08:28.250\nNow, exploits are what we use to take\nadvantage of those vulnerabilities right?\n\n147\n00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.211\nOnce a bad guy has\ndiscovered a vulnerability,\n\n148\n00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:35.882\nthey say look this guy's running AIS\nversion seven on their web server.\n\n149\n00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.627\nSo there's the vulnerability.\n\n150\n00:08:37.627 --> 00:08:40.891\nI know that that is, for\nexample and this is not true, but\n\n151\n00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:45.600\nlet's just say that IIS seven was\nvulnerable to a buffer overflow.\n\n152\n00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.477\nSo, the vulnerability is the fact\nthat you're running IIS 7, and\n\n153\n00:08:49.477 --> 00:08:54.443\nit has this known weakness that if you put\ncertain characters in it's susceptible to,\n\n154\n00:08:54.443 --> 00:08:56.226\nlet's say a buffer overflow.\n\n155\n00:08:56.226 --> 00:09:02.320\nAnd exploit then is a maybe a tool\nthat I can take advantage of that.\n\n156\n00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.547\nI've got a tool where I can punch in the\nIP address of your web server and I click\n\n157\n00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:11.168\na button and it's gonna generate a payload\nor information that it submits that takes\n\n158\n00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:15.490\nadvantage of the vulnerability and\nreturns me a system command prompt right?\n\n159\n00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.427\nOr a command prompt with system access.\n\n160\n00:09:17.427 --> 00:09:22.364\nSo an exploit takes advantage\nof vulnerabilities.\n\n161\n00:09:22.364 --> 00:09:27.194\nOftentimes the exploit carries\na payload that is going\n\n162\n00:09:27.194 --> 00:09:31.814\nto be delivered like an exploit\nmight take advantage\n\n163\n00:09:31.814 --> 00:09:36.460\nof that buffer overflow and\ngive me that prompt.\n\n164\n00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:41.452\nAnd from that prompt, I can now copy\nover this Trojan that's going to give me\n\n165\n00:09:41.452 --> 00:09:44.424\na backdoor back into\nthe system later right?\n\n166\n00:09:44.424 --> 00:09:50.420\nSo, vulnerabilities, weaknesses,\nholes within a system or network.\n\n167\n00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.022\nExploits are what we use to take\nadvantage of those vulnerabilities.\n\n168\n00:09:55.022 --> 00:09:57.424\nAnd again, they often carry payloads.\n\n169\n00:09:57.424 --> 00:10:01.071\nWe also have different\ntechniques that we can use.\n\n170\n00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:05.234\nYou know, a lot of times a particular\nvulnerability might have several different\n\n171\n00:10:05.234 --> 00:10:07.115\nexploits that we can use against it.\n\n172\n00:10:07.115 --> 00:10:11.653\nOr there might be different\nattack vectors that I can take to\n\n173\n00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:14.298\nthe same vulnerability, right?\n\n174\n00:10:14.298 --> 00:10:19.034\nOne might be really easy to do that\nare also makes a lot of noise and\n\n175\n00:10:19.034 --> 00:10:20.900\nit's detectable.\n\n176\n00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.143\nWhereas another method might be\nmuch more difficult to accomplish.\n\n177\n00:10:24.143 --> 00:10:28.926\nBut it's much more stealthy and less\nlikely that I'm gonna be discovered when\n\n178\n00:10:28.926 --> 00:10:32.170\nI'm performing this particular technique.\n\n179\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.563\nSo, definitely different techniques\nthat we can use to launch an attack.\n\n180\n00:10:35.563 --> 00:10:38.091\nSome of it has to do\nwith skill sets as well.\n\n181\n00:10:38.091 --> 00:10:42.004\nAs a script kitty, I can go get that tool,\nput that IP address in that and\n\n182\n00:10:42.004 --> 00:10:45.410\nclick that button and\nmay be launch an attack.\n\n183\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:50.350\nAs a professional hacker, I'm gonna\nwrite my own script that's not gonna be\n\n184\n00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:55.749\nsusceptible to any signature definitions\nbecause, it's never been seen before.\n\n185\n00:10:55.749 --> 00:11:00.552\nSame vulnerability, different\ntypes of techniques being used to\n\n186\n00:11:00.552 --> 00:11:04.600\ntake advantage of that vulnerability,\nright.\n\n187\n00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.322\nSo we've got as far as the attack vectors\ngo, and we've got the vulnerabilities,\n\n188\n00:11:09.322 --> 00:11:12.899\nthe exploits to take advantage\nof those vulnerabilities, and\n\n189\n00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:17.285\nthen the techniques that are being used\nto leverage those vulnerabilities or\n\n190\n00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:18.923\nimplement those exploits.\n\n191\n00:11:18.923 --> 00:11:23.339\nAgain, a lot of it comes down to skill\nset, as far as what techniques I use.\n\n192\n00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:28.177\nThe skill set of the attacker,\nthe efficiency of the attack,\n\n193\n00:11:28.177 --> 00:11:33.200\nas well as trying to escape detection and\nnot leaving traces that\n\n194\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:39.460\ncan be traced back to me, or that I was\neven there in the first place, all right.\n\n195\n00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.773\nAll right Daniel, so\nwe've gone through the techniques.\n\n196\n00:11:42.773 --> 00:11:44.743\nWe're talking about technique criteria.\n\n197\n00:11:44.743 --> 00:11:48.886\nAgain this is kinda just continuing on\nwith what we're just talking about.\n\n198\n00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:52.021\nChosen based on factors like ease,\neffectiveness, and\n\n199\n00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:55.170\nconcealment, and\nthat's really what it comes down to.\n\n200\n00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.550\nHow easy is this technique?\n\n201\n00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.496\nAs I said, I can get Enmap and\nI can punch in an IP range.\n\n202\n00:12:02.496 --> 00:12:06.126\nAnd I can do a network scan very easily,\nright.\n\n203\n00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:10.404\nBut if I wanna write my own Python\nscript to accomplish that same thing,\n\n204\n00:12:10.404 --> 00:12:14.635\ngonna be more difficult but\nit also might be a little more stealthy.\n\n205\n00:12:14.635 --> 00:12:18.470\nBecause I can do things that\nmaybe Enmap doesn't do or\n\n206\n00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:23.074\ninclude certain things that\nare specific to this environment so\n\n207\n00:12:23.074 --> 00:12:26.241\nit could be based on ease, effectiveness.\n\n208\n00:12:26.241 --> 00:12:28.890\nSome techniques are gonna be\nmore effective than others.\n\n209\n00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:34.320\nI can do a ping sweep, or\nlet's say I'm doing a port scan right.\n\n210\n00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.510\nI can do a simple port scan and\nI can discover the open ports.\n\n211\n00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:43.006\nEffective, or easy to do, but\nwhat if they are doing some\n\n212\n00:12:43.006 --> 00:12:49.340\nsystem reviews in port docking\nto open up those ports, right?\n\n213\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.360\nNow my simple ping sweep of those\nports is not gonna display or show me\n\n214\n00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.810\nthat that port is open cuz I'm not using\nthe right technique to open that port.\n\n215\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.789\nSo my technique might be different\nbecause I need a little more effective\n\n216\n00:13:02.789 --> 00:13:06.971\nagainst their particular method\nof protecting their network.\n\n217\n00:13:06.971 --> 00:13:08.512\nAnd concealment, right.\n\n218\n00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:11.495\nAgain, I'll go back to a simple one.\n\n219\n00:13:11.495 --> 00:13:15.671\nNmap, I can do a port scan\nwith a timing of five, insane.\n\n220\n00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:18.493\nSo it just says [SOUND] as fast as it can.\n\n221\n00:13:18.493 --> 00:13:22.800\nIt's gonna sweep through all\n65,535 ports on that system.\n\n222\n00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.620\nDoesn't care how much noise it makes.\n\n223\n00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.255\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't, right?\nWe're not worried about being stealthy at\n\n224\n00:13:27.255 --> 00:13:28.016\nthis point.\n\n225\n00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:30.747\nI just need results fast.\n\n226\n00:13:30.747 --> 00:13:34.800\nMaybe I'm doing a penetration test and\nit's a gray box or a white box.\n\n227\n00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.642\nWe're not trying to be stealthy,\nI need results.\n\n228\n00:13:36.642 --> 00:13:41.367\nSo I bump that timing up to a five and\nI rifle through all the ports on there.\n\n229\n00:13:41.367 --> 00:13:45.894\nI can start moving on with my penetration\ntest cuz now I know what ports,\n\n230\n00:13:45.894 --> 00:13:48.750\nwhat services etc, etc, all right?\n\n231\n00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.991\nOr maybe this isn't a penetration test.\n\n232\n00:13:50.991 --> 00:13:53.977\nOr it's a black box test and\nI need to be a little more stealthy.\n\n233\n00:13:53.977 --> 00:13:58.028\nOr it could be a white box and I need to\nbe stealthy, it really doesn't matter.\n\n234\n00:13:58.028 --> 00:14:01.927\nSo I'm going to slow my technique down.\n\n235\n00:14:01.927 --> 00:14:06.701\nI'm gonna do a timing of one, which is\ngonna take much longer to go through\n\n236\n00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:11.322\nall 65,535 ports, but\nit's also gonna be less likely to trigger\n\n237\n00:14:11.322 --> 00:14:16.120\nan intrusion detection system that\nthey might be running, right?\n\n238\n00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.200\nAgain, concealment might\nchange what technique I use.\n\n239\n00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.839\nEffectiveness might change\nwhat technique I'm gonna use.\n\n240\n00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:27.777\nEase of use might change what\ntechnique I'm going to use.\n\n241\n00:14:27.777 --> 00:14:31.332\nOther technique criteria\nthat we need to be aware of,\n\n242\n00:14:31.332 --> 00:14:34.230\ntargeted and non-targeted, right?\n\n243\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.586\nWe talk about a non-targeted attack.\n\n244\n00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:41.024\nWe're talking about basically doing\na cast net, right, which I love watching.\n\n245\n00:14:41.024 --> 00:14:45.160\nLately, I'm watching these guys that do,\nif you know what a cast net is,\n\n246\n00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.940\nit's basically a circular net typically\nthat has weights on the perimeter.\n\n247\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.562\nAnd so they have to hold it, and they\nfling it out like a pizza or a frisbee.\n\n248\n00:14:53.562 --> 00:14:57.653\nAnd the idea is to get this net to turn,\nbasically using the perimeter weights,\n\n249\n00:14:57.653 --> 00:15:00.980\nto go back into the form of\na circle as it hits the water.\n\n250\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.059\nSinks down around all their target\nfish and they can pull it back in.\n\n251\n00:15:05.059 --> 00:15:09.785\nWell as a bad guy,\nI might do a non-targeted attack.\n\n252\n00:15:09.785 --> 00:15:11.736\nI might send a phishing scam.\n\n253\n00:15:11.736 --> 00:15:18.050\nAnd I email everybody in the company,\nhoping that I can get some replies.\n\n254\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:22.059\nSomebody out of that organization's 150\nemployees, I bet you at least ten of them\n\n255\n00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:25.359\nare going to click on this link, and\nnow I've got somebody to attack.\n\n256\n00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:27.427\nOr I've compromised somebody\nwithin the organization.\n\n257\n00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.330\nSo, I'm just basically doing a cast net.\n\n258\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.230\nI'm throwing it out there hoping\nI get some type of response,\n\n259\n00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.008\nthat'd be a non-targeted type of attack.\n\n260\n00:15:36.008 --> 00:15:40.266\nWhereas a targeted attack is\nfocused on a single target.\n\n261\n00:15:40.266 --> 00:15:44.884\nI need to get that person in\nthe organization to click on this link,\n\n262\n00:15:44.884 --> 00:15:47.770\nso I'm not spamming the entire company,\n\n263\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:52.235\nI'm sending an email directly\nto the board of directors Right?\n\n264\n00:15:52.235 --> 00:15:53.399\nThose are the targets.\n\n265\n00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:54.497\nThere are names for\n\n266\n00:15:54.497 --> 00:15:59.238\nsome of these attacks, like phishing is\nkind of a general cast net type of attack.\n\n267\n00:15:59.238 --> 00:16:00.322\n&gt;&gt; P-H phishing.\n\n268\n00:16:00.322 --> 00:16:01.352\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n&gt;&gt; P-H phishing.\n\n269\n00:16:01.352 --> 00:16:02.982\n&gt;&gt; P-H phishing.\n&gt;&gt; Not fishing, fishing.\n\n270\n00:16:02.982 --> 00:16:05.641\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, phishing with a P-H.\n\n271\n00:16:05.641 --> 00:16:07.850\nYeah, I guess with my cast net,\nyou might think fishing.\n\n272\n00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.060\nBut phishing with a p,\nyou're sending out a cast.\n\n273\n00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:16.164\nNow you're just hoping to get\nsome responses whereas wailing,\n\n274\n00:16:16.164 --> 00:16:20.712\nfor example,\nI'm going after the big targets, right?\n\n275\n00:16:20.712 --> 00:16:25.260\nThe CEOs of the organization, the board of\ndirectors, the ones with the deep pockets.\n\n276\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.030\nOr, I might do a very targeted attack, or\n\n277\n00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.260\nI do spear phishing against\nthe head of IT security.\n\n278\n00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.330\nThat's the guy I wanna compromise, because\nI know he has the keys to the kingdom.\n\n279\n00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:41.377\nSo, I'm doing more of a spear phishing,\na single fish that I'm trying to attack.\n\n280\n00:16:41.377 --> 00:16:42.177\nLove all these terms that come up.\n\n281\n00:16:42.177 --> 00:16:42.967\n&gt;&gt; It is fun.\n\n282\n00:16:42.967 --> 00:16:44.613\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n283\n00:16:44.613 --> 00:16:46.484\n&gt;&gt; Very clever people in security, right?\n\n284\n00:16:46.484 --> 00:16:49.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They are.\n\n285\n00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.600\nSo, targeted versus non-targeted.\n\n286\n00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.575\nWe also have direct versus indirect.\n\n287\n00:16:56.575 --> 00:16:58.405\nWhere we're talking about a direct,\n\n288\n00:16:58.405 --> 00:17:02.900\nwe're typically exploiting a particular\nflaw in a system that we've discovered.\n\n289\n00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.510\nLike, I see that you're running\nPHP on that web server.\n\n290\n00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.130\nOr you're running an older version\nof a patch on that web server.\n\n291\n00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.020\nSo, I am going to take advantage of that,\n\n292\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.371\nbecause I have an exploit that I already\nknow works against that version.\n\n293\n00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:18.645\nI can just tweak it a little bit or\nmaybe not even tweak it at all, and\n\n294\n00:17:18.645 --> 00:17:19.652\nI can get it to work.\n\n295\n00:17:19.652 --> 00:17:22.816\nSo, this would be a direct attack\nagainst the web server and\n\n296\n00:17:22.816 --> 00:17:27.072\nit's that web server that has the\ninformation that I'm trying to get, right?\n\n297\n00:17:27.072 --> 00:17:30.346\nSo a very direct attack.\n\n298\n00:17:30.346 --> 00:17:35.330\nAn indirect attack is when I\ncan't attack the target directly.\n\n299\n00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:39.780\nMaybe your databases is pretty hardened,\nit's pretty patched.\n\n300\n00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.729\nI'm not able to attack that data base and\n\n301\n00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:46.999\nget that customer information,\nso am I dead in the water?\n\n302\n00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:49.560\nNo, I'm now just gonna\ngo an indirect route.\n\n303\n00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.820\nBecause somebody has access\nto that database, right?\n\n304\n00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:58.800\nAnd those somebodies, the humans in the\norganization, make for a nice soft target.\n\n305\n00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.110\nI can start doing social engineering\nagainst somebody that has access to that\n\n306\n00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.860\ndatabase.\n\n307\n00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.970\nIf I can get them to reveal passwords or\ninformation, compromise them and\n\n308\n00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.690\nin a roundabout way,\ngo in and hit that database.\n\n309\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.480\nStill attacking the database,\nstill getting the same information, but\n\n310\n00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.460\nI'm doing it indirect means, because I\ndon't have a direct avenue of attack.\n\n311\n00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.870\nCuz you've done a good job\nof protecting that database,\n\n312\n00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.170\nkeeping it behind firewalls, etc, etc.\n\n313\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.980\nSo, I'm gonna find some other avenue of\napproach, which is most likely finding\n\n314\n00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.870\nsomebody else that does have\nthe level of access that I want and\n\n315\n00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.320\nthen trying to compromise them.\n\n316\n00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.540\nSo, that would be an indirect approach and\nsocial engineering huge.\n\n317\n00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.620\nWe'll talk much more about that later.\n\n318\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.529\nBut that's a big, big one when it comes to\nindirect attacks of social engineering.\n\n319\n00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.110\nThen we've got for our last one here for\ntechnique criteria,\n\n320\n00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.650\nwe've got stealth versus non-stealth,\nall right?\n\n321\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.950\nWhich is kind of a repeat,\n\n322\n00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.510\na little bit of a repeat from\nwhat we've already talked about.\n\n323\n00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.390\nBut stealthy,\ntrying to remain undetected, right?\n\n324\n00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.310\nI do not want to get caught.\n\n325\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:09.970\nI want to get in, get the information and\nnot set off any alarms.\n\n326\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.520\nMinimize the trace of my attack and\nof me ever being there.\n\n327\n00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.550\n&gt;&gt; And I'm sure that's the de\nfacto standpoint for most.\n\n328\n00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.020\nBut that's not always\nthe way you want to go.\n\n329\n00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:23.870\nSometimes doing non-stealthy can be\na means in and of itself for our purpose.\n\n330\n00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.860\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I might be trying\nto cause panic in a system or\n\n331\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.060\na network where stealth is not\nthe technique I wanna use.\n\n332\n00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.350\nI wanna make this noisy.\n\n333\n00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.210\nI want to send an email out and\n\n334\n00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:41.250\nhave dozens of your employees\ncall on the help desk, my gosh!\n\n335\n00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.060\nI just got this email.\n\n336\n00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:42.870\nIt's flashing things.\n\n337\n00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.110\nIt tells me everything's locked and\nall of our data's compromised and\n\n338\n00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.510\nthe server cloud is gonna blow up, right?\n\n339\n00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.870\nWell, you're gonna have a lot\nof panicked people calling,\n\n340\n00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.930\nrunning out of the building.\n\n341\n00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.690\nI'm being a little facetious with that or\n\n342\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.710\na little overexaggerated but\nthat's the idea.\n\n343\n00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.530\nI can cause panic.\n\n344\n00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.703\nI can cause.\n\n345\n00:20:05.389 --> 00:20:06.684\nConfusion.\n\n346\n00:20:06.684 --> 00:20:07.366\n&gt;&gt; Disruption.\n\n347\n00:20:07.366 --> 00:20:08.510\n&gt;&gt; Disruption.\n\n348\n00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.220\nAnd, another thing, with stealth,\nwe're trying to remain undetected.\n\n349\n00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.690\nAnother thing with stealth I want to\ntry to get a back door in, all right?\n\n350\n00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.190\nI've found an avenue of attack.\n\n351\n00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:18.700\nAn attack vector.\n\n352\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.560\nI've found a vulnerability.\n\n353\n00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.240\nI've got an exploit that will take\nadvantage of that vulnerability.\n\n354\n00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.030\nI've launched my attack.\n\n355\n00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:30.820\nI have exploited that vulnerability,\nnow I'm in, right?\n\n356\n00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.510\nBut, what I want to do\nis set up a backdoor.\n\n357\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.433\nAnd then,\nback out of my current attack vector.\n\n358\n00:20:37.433 --> 00:20:42.130\nAnd possibly even, this is the crazy\nthing, as a bad guy, I kid you not,\n\n359\n00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.680\nI might find an attack vector, right?\n\n360\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.280\nI might find a vulnerability.\n\n361\n00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.540\nI might find an exploit that takes\nadvantage of that vulnerability.\n\n362\n00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.180\nI might leverage that exploit and\ngain access.\n\n363\n00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.928\nUsing that exploit against\nthat vulnerability.\n\n364\n00:20:56.928 --> 00:21:00.860\nNow I plant my back door, so\nI've got another way to come in, right?\n\n365\n00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.180\nI create an account that\nyou don't know about.\n\n366\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.250\nSo I know the username and the password\nand add it to the admins group,\n\n367\n00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.900\nwhatever, right?\n\n368\n00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.400\nCreate some kind of back door.\n\n369\n00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.940\nI open up a port, maybe you're not\nmonitoring your ports closely enough.\n\n370\n00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.790\nAnd I've opened one up and\nset up a listener over there so\n\n371\n00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.700\nthat I can connect any time I want.\n\n372\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.700\nWhen I'm gonna back out of\nmy original attack vector.\n\n373\n00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.180\nMight even patch your system for you.\n\n374\n00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.110\nWait what?\n\n375\n00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:29.180\nI don't want some other script kiddie\nfinding that same vulnerability that\n\n376\n00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.530\nyou've left open and\nlaunching an attack and\n\n377\n00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.980\nsetting off all the alarms cuz they're\nnot so good at covering their tracks.\n\n378\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.650\nAnd then all of a sudden you do a deeper\nlook and you find my earlier attack,\n\n379\n00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.270\nyou find my back door, and\nyou shut it all down, right?\n\n380\n00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.000\nAll because I left that\nvulnerability there, or you as\n\n381\n00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.160\na network admin left that vulnerability\nthere, I've already taken advantage of it.\n\n382\n00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.560\nNow somebody else has found it.\n\n383\n00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.320\nSo you might see the bad guy actually\npatching your systems for you.\n\n384\n00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.690\nIt's not a good thing, all right?\n\n385\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.700\nI mean, it is nice of them, but\nthey're not doing it to help you.\n\n386\n00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.738\nSo stealthy, try to remain on\ndetected back door non-stealthy,\n\n387\n00:22:04.738 --> 00:22:06.280\nas Daniel said, noisy.\n\n388\n00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.040\nWe're not worried about\nremaining undetected.\n\n389\n00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.030\nWe're okay with that,\nbecause the end result, or\n\n390\n00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.670\nthe intent of the attack\nwas not to remain stealthy.\n\n391\n00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.710\nIt was to make sure you knew I was there.\n\n392\n00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.590\nTo prove to you that you got\na weakness in your system, right?\n\n393\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.220\nAgain, that comes back\nto me wanting power.\n\n394\n00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.170\nTo assert my dominance or\n\n395\n00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:32.270\nmy skill set is better than your\nskill set type Of attitude, right?\n\n396\n00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.640\nSo, I want you to hear it, I want you to\nknow that I made it into your system.\n\n397\n00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.350\nI'm gonna deface your web page, I'm going\nto leave you a note on your desktop\n\n398\n00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.300\nwith a copy of the information\nthat I just took with me.\n\n399\n00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:51.180\nAlso another reason for\nnon stealth is misdirection all right?\n\n400\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.091\nWhat about that?\n\n401\n00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:56.091\nWe've seen this in the movies, hey I need\nyou to create a distraction, I want you to\n\n402\n00:22:56.091 --> 00:22:59.423\ngo over there and start screaming\nlike you just got your head cut off.\n\n403\n00:22:59.423 --> 00:23:01.885\nAnd while you're doing that and\neveryone's looking at you,\n\n404\n00:23:01.885 --> 00:23:05.390\nI'm gonna reach back here and\ngrab the money out of the register.\n\n405\n00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.680\nSame thing with electronic attack.\n\n406\n00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.250\nI might put a whole bunch of\neffort into making this noisy,\n\n407\n00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:15.340\nnoisy attack on this one server and\neverybody's looking that way.\n\n408\n00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.670\nAnd in the mean time I've\ngone in Active Directory and\n\n409\n00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.890\nchanged one of the passwords on\nyour administrative account.\n\n410\n00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:21.630\nVery low key,\n\n411\n00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.410\ndidn't set off a lot of alarms, you guys\nare all busy watching watching this and\n\n412\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.980\nthe log files on this and this and\nyou didn't notice this one right?\n\n413\n00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.288\nSo, there were two attacks going on.\n\n414\n00:23:29.288 --> 00:23:33.210\nOne very non-stealthy, one very noisy and\n\n415\n00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.010\nanother stealthy one coming in beside it,\nright?\n\n416\n00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.780\nSo the noisy one was not for\nany end result,\n\n417\n00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.730\nit was just to hide the other attack.\n\n418\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.390\nSo non-stealth attacks,\n\n419\n00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.140\ninstantaneously you wouldn't think,\nyou think everybody wants to be stealthy.\n\n420\n00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.641\nWho wants to get caught?\n\n421\n00:23:47.641 --> 00:23:51.039\nThere are times when non-stealthy\nattacks are done intentionally,\n\n422\n00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:52.716\nand we've gotta be aware of that.\n\n423\n00:23:52.716 --> 00:23:57.618\nAll right, let's see,\nwe've got the last couple of things here,\n\n424\n00:23:57.618 --> 00:23:59.796\nwe can probably wrap this up.\n\n425\n00:23:59.796 --> 00:24:03.300\nClient-side versus server-side attacks,\nand a lot of this,\n\n426\n00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.530\nwe're gonna go into more detail\nas we go through our episodes,\n\n427\n00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.260\nwe're kind of getting\nour framework laid here.\n\n428\n00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.535\nBut when it comes to our attacks, they can\nbe client-side, they can be server-side.\n\n429\n00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:15.690\nServer-side attacks, obviously,\nare attacking the servers themselves,\n\n430\n00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:20.030\nwhere I compromise the systems that\nare serving up the data to your customers.\n\n431\n00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:25.600\nSo your web server, your database server,\nyour email servers, things like that.\n\n432\n00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.940\nI'm gonna compromise those\n\n433\n00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.950\nin hopes that I will end up\ncompromising other people, right?\n\n434\n00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.870\nI compromise that web server, so that\nwhen a legitimate customer goes to your\n\n435\n00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:42.010\nwebsite, and they request the page,\nit downloads some script.\n\n436\n00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:43.480\nAnd it runs on their machine and\n\n437\n00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.450\nwipes their machine or\ncompromises their machine somehow.\n\n438\n00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:54.235\nSo we're gonna use the server\nas a way to compromise others.\n\n439\n00:24:54.235 --> 00:24:57.376\nYour legitimate customers, or\nuse, when I say customers,\n\n440\n00:24:57.376 --> 00:25:00.870\nyour salespeople are customers\nof your CRM software, right?\n\n441\n00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:03.808\nBecause they use it everyday.\n\n442\n00:25:03.808 --> 00:25:06.215\nCould be that I just want to do a DDOS or\n\n443\n00:25:06.215 --> 00:25:10.190\na DOS type of attack,\na denial of service on your web server.\n\n444\n00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:14.750\nSo if there is a server-side attack, I'm\ngonna prevent the server from being able\n\n445\n00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:19.710\nto respond to a legitimate requests and\nprevent you from being\n\n446\n00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:23.328\nable to sell product cuz nobody can\nget to your website, for example.\n\n447\n00:25:23.328 --> 00:25:27.770\nWhereas the client-side attack,\nthe one thing about servers,\n\n448\n00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.770\nmost organizations spend a lot of\ntime trying to protect their servers.\n\n449\n00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:35.015\nThey know that those are the targets,\nright?\n\n450\n00:25:35.015 --> 00:25:38.660\nThose are the ones that people wanna get\nto, it's where the secret information is.\n\n451\n00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.944\nThe credit card database, the information\nabout our products, the up and\n\n452\n00:25:42.944 --> 00:25:47.435\ncoming software that we're developing,\nit's all posted on these servers.\n\n453\n00:25:47.435 --> 00:25:54.940\nSo that's where most organizations will\nspend their time trying to protect.\n\n454\n00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.660\nThey know that they should\nhard their servers,\n\n455\n00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:03.330\nat least put passwords on there,\nput a firewall on there, things like that.\n\n456\n00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.930\nWhat about the clients though?\n\n457\n00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.680\nWhat about the other side of that?\n\n458\n00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.280\nIn a client server model, you've got\na server that's serving up a resource.\n\n459\n00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.050\nAnd you've got a client that's\nconsuming those resources.\n\n460\n00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:17.460\nNow if those clients are in house, your\nemployees, you might have group policy or\n\n461\n00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.020\nwhatever else that you're using\nto try to harden those nodes.\n\n462\n00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.870\nBut what about Joe customer, right?\n\n463\n00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.470\nThey're coming in,\nyou can't control their machine.\n\n464\n00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.190\nYou have no idea what's on their machine,\n\n465\n00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.440\nyet, you've gotta let\nthem access your website.\n\n466\n00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.410\nSo they can buy a product, but they could\nbe chock full of viruses and spyware and\n\n467\n00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.840\ntrojans and who knows what else.\n\n468\n00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:43.150\nSo sometimes, a client-side attack\nis when I attack the client,\n\n469\n00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:49.520\nrather than the server, usually, and the\nend result is trying to get to the server.\n\n470\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.490\nBut I'm taking the easier avenue, right?\n\n471\n00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.680\nThat indirect-\n&gt;&gt; Indirect.\n\n472\n00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n473\n00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.750\nWe're taking that easier\navenue of approach.\n\n474\n00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.550\nI know they've hard that server, but\n\n475\n00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:01.810\nthey've still got the XP machine on the\nnetwork that has lots of vulnerabilities.\n\n476\n00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:06.280\nI can get to that, and then from there,\nit already has a VPN connection to\n\n477\n00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.222\nthe server, so now I can compromise\nthat way, right, that indirect route.\n\n478\n00:27:10.222 --> 00:27:15.920\nSo client-side, cuz the clients\nusually aren't as secure and\n\n479\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.550\nthen can become that entry\npoint into the network.\n\n480\n00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:25.786\nSo in the end, when we took all of this\ntogether that we've been talking about,\n\n481\n00:27:25.786 --> 00:27:29.148\ntalking about understand\nthe qualitative risk and\n\n482\n00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:34.248\nimpact of what we've been talking about\nis creating these threat profiles.\n\n483\n00:27:34.248 --> 00:27:37.620\nWe'll talk a lot more about risk and\nevaluating risk and\n\n484\n00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.980\ndifferent types of risk analysis, but\nwe're trying to build a threat profile.\n\n485\n00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.210\nA threat profile is gonna include all the\ninformation that we've been discussing.\n\n486\n00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.490\nWho that threat actor, what that\nthreat actor is, what type they are,\n\n487\n00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:55.895\nactivist, script kiddie,\nprofessional, what are their motives?\n\n488\n00:27:55.895 --> 00:27:56.918\nWhy are they doing what they're doing?\n\n489\n00:27:56.918 --> 00:28:00.135\nRevenge, espionage.\n\n490\n00:28:00.135 --> 00:28:05.035\nWhat are their intentions to do a denial\nof service on our website or to\n\n491\n00:28:06.265 --> 00:28:11.945\ndeface our website or\nto spread bad things about our CEO?\n\n492\n00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.190\nAll right, what were the intentions?\n\n493\n00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.390\nWhat are the vectors that they used?\n\n494\n00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.080\nDo they come in through our web servers?\n\n495\n00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.300\nAre they coming through the outside,\nor are they coming from the inside?\n\n496\n00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.860\nIs it client-side versus server-side\nas far as the techniques go?\n\n497\n00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.550\nSo we build these different\nthreat profiles, and\n\n498\n00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.740\nthen we can assign values to that.\n\n499\n00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.330\nJust like when we do risk management,\nand we're looking at risks and we assign\n\n500\n00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:39.610\nvalues like impact, how often it's gonna\nincur, likelihood that it's gonna occur.\n\n501\n00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.200\nWith threat profiles,\nwe do the same thing.\n\n502\n00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.290\nWe say, okay, what kind of actor's\ngonna take advantage of this?\n\n503\n00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:46.480\nWhat would their motivations be?\n\n504\n00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.561\nWhat are their intentions?\n\n505\n00:28:47.561 --> 00:28:48.425\nWhat are their techniques?\n\n506\n00:28:48.425 --> 00:28:49.980\nWhat are the vectors?\n\n507\n00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.770\nWe can assign some type of metric to that.\n\n508\n00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.692\nAnd then, by looking at the different\nthreats that an organization faces,\n\n509\n00:28:56.692 --> 00:28:58.961\nI can start categorizing those, and I say,\n\n510\n00:28:58.961 --> 00:29:02.990\nthis is where we wanna focus the majority\nof our money and our efforts on.\n\n511\n00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.200\nThis one, not so much.\n\n512\n00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.050\nYes, a script kiddie could\ntake advantage of it, but\n\n513\n00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:10.700\nthe odds are less that\nthey'll be successful.\n\n514\n00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.890\nAnd even if they are,\nthe technique is gonna,\n\n515\n00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.780\nwe will be on the script kiddie,\nsomething like that, right?\n\n516\n00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.180\nSo by getting this information\ntogether makes it easier for\n\n517\n00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:27.280\nus to decide how we wanna go\nabout implementing security,\n\n518\n00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.960\nhow we wanna protect our information\nfrom all of these different vectors and\n\n519\n00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.170\nactors and motivations and all of that.\n\n520\n00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well Mike, you did a great job\nof giving us a good, what shall I say,\n\n521\n00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:45.900\na common language in which we've defined\na lot of things that we're going to use\n\n522\n00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.220\nin our upcoming conversations on security,\nright?\n\n523\n00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.580\nThat's where we want you to be.\n\n524\n00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.020\nWe wanna give you a good base, and\nhopefully, that has been done.\n\n525\n00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.960\nMike, I thought you did a fantastic job of\nexplaining some of the very common things\n\n526\n00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:01.940\nthat we need to know and have under\nour belts as a basic understanding for\n\n527\n00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.620\nus before we start to progress even\nfurther and getting more advanced.\n\n528\n00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.270\nThat being said, it looks like we've come\nto the end of another great episode,\n\n529\n00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.450\nhopefully, you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n530\n00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.380\nWe take great pains to make\nthese things awesome for you, so\n\n531\n00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.420\nthat you can learn, pass exams, and\n\n532\n00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.980\njust have a great body of knowledge\ninside your little brain out there.\n\n533\n00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.360\nThat being said,\nit is time for us to sign off.\n\n534\n00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.260\nSo doing that, signing off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n535\n00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.000\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n536\n00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.463\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n537\n00:30:28.463 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.144\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:16.302\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:20.512\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on with\n\n9\n00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:23.808\nour CyberSec First Responder\nseries from Logical Operations,\n\n10\n00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:27.740\njoining us in the studio again today\nis our good friend, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.699\nMike, welcome back sir and\nwe are so glad to have you.\n\n12\n00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.162\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back,\n\n13\n00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:34.923\nexcited as we continue on exactly\nwith our CyberSec First Responder.\n\n14\n00:00:34.923 --> 00:00:38.335\nAll right, so in this episode,\nwe're gonna start talking about\n\n15\n00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:43.290\nsome different attack tools and techniques\nand really more that we'll lead into that.\n\n16\n00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.062\nBut I wanna kinda start off laying\nsome more that found work, found work.\n\n17\n00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:50.191\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Foundational knowledge,\n\n18\n00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:53.000\ntrying to combine a couple\nof phrases in my mind there.\n\n19\n00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.999\nThe foundational knowledge, the framework\nthat we need, that's what I was combining,\n\n20\n00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.733\nto make sure that we're all on\na same page and we understand and\n\n21\n00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:03.416\nwe can communicate with other security\nprofessionals, with the higher-ups if we\n\n22\n00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:06.340\nhave to do reporting it's\nlike when we're pen testing.\n\n23\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.337\nGotta make sure we're using proper terms,\nmakes it a lot easier to communicate.\n\n24\n00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:15.062\nAnd in here, we're gonna, like I said,\nstart looking at some of the tools and\n\n25\n00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:18.393\ntechniques that the bad guys are using\nwhen they're attacking us, or\n\n26\n00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:21.400\nthey were using when we're\ndoing penetration testing.\n\n27\n00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.980\nCuz there's a methodology to a hack,\nbelieve it or not, right?\n\n28\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.644\nThere's steps that we go through\nin a hacking exercise whether\n\n29\n00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:33.695\nthat's from the good guy side or\nfrom the bad guy side.\n\n30\n00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:37.770\nAnd we're gonna start with\nthe very first phase which is,\n\n31\n00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.179\ndepending on what book you read and\nwho you're learning from,\n\n32\n00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.440\nreconnaissance or\nfootprinting is really where it starts.\n\n33\n00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.807\nReconnaissance is kinda the first,\ntwo or three steps whereas,\n\n34\n00:01:49.807 --> 00:01:51.960\nfootprinting is gonna be our first step.\n\n35\n00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.430\nWe're gonna talk about footprinting,\nscanning, and enumeration.\n\n36\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.030\nAnd all of those kinda\nfall under reconnaissance.\n\n37\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.956\nAnd really it's all about gathering\ninformation, preparing for an attack,\n\n38\n00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:09.579\ngetting everything ready, getting all\nyour ducks in a row, if you will,\n\n39\n00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.923\ncrossing all your T's,\ndotting all your I's, that kind of thing.\n\n40\n00:02:13.923 --> 00:02:18.820\nWhen we talk about a hack, you don't\njust start off with an exploit and\n\n41\n00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.559\nyou fire to some vulnerable machine and\n\n42\n00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:26.220\nget access to resources that\nyou should not have access to.\n\n43\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.760\nThere's a lot of planning involved.\n\n44\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.813\nThere's a lot of pre-staging involved, and\nthat's where the reconnaissance comes in.\n\n45\n00:02:31.813 --> 00:02:36.616\nAll right, and it's the same with any,\nif we think about physical attacks, right,\n\n46\n00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:40.700\nyou watch the movies, you see the bad\nguys scoping out the bank, right?\n\n47\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.678\nThey're sitting outside,\nthey're watching the guards and\n\n48\n00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:47.810\nseeing when they take their breaks, what\ntime they make the rotations, the timing.\n\n49\n00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.320\nHow long it takes them to make\nit around the floor plan and\n\n50\n00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.110\nback to the beginning so that they can,\nmaybe successfully carry out an attack.\n\n51\n00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.390\nAnd it's the same thing that\ncyber criminals, anybody\n\n52\n00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.510\nthat's doing this attack is gonna do,\nno one's gonna blindly start the attack.\n\n53\n00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.551\nIf they're gonna be successful\nthey have to do some\n\n54\n00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:11.973\nreconnaissance and-\n&gt;&gt; If they wanna successfully do it again\n\n55\n00:03:11.973 --> 00:03:13.856\n[LAUGH] without being behind bars.\n\n56\n00:03:13.856 --> 00:03:14.999\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n57\n00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:15.910\n&gt;&gt; Probably a good idea.\n\n58\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.850\n&gt;&gt; And as security professionals, that's\nthe phase that we would love to catch them\n\n59\n00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.060\nin, before they actually\nlaunch the attacks, right?\n\n60\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.590\nWhile they're doing that\nreconnaissance and/or controlling\n\n61\n00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.950\nwhat information is available,\n\n62\n00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.420\nthat they're able to discover through\nfootprinting, scanning, enumeration.\n\n63\n00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.722\nBecause if they can't, if they can't get\nthe information they need to successfully\n\n64\n00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:41.679\nlaunch an attack, odds are they're\ngonna move onto the next target, right?\n\n65\n00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:45.462\nAnd so, if we understand what they're\ndoing, techniques they're using,\n\n66\n00:03:45.462 --> 00:03:48.606\nwhat information they're getting,\nwhere it's coming from,\n\n67\n00:03:48.606 --> 00:03:52.940\nhow I can better secure that information,\nI can protect my network, that's the idea.\n\n68\n00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.820\nAll right, so,\nlet's start off with footprinting, right?\n\n69\n00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.610\nFootprinting is really gathering\n\n70\n00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.220\ninformation about your target,\nor about the target.\n\n71\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.190\nSo, we're talking about, you can\nkinda draw the line here, we can have\n\n72\n00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.600\nwhat's called open source footprinting and\nclosed source footprinting.\n\n73\n00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.850\nOpen source, information gathering,\n\n74\n00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.260\nif you will,\nis information that's publicly available,\n\n75\n00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.310\nwhereas closed source would be information\nthat's not publicly available, all right?\n\n76\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.494\nAnd you'd be surprised, this is something\nthat every organization should go through.\n\n77\n00:04:26.494 --> 00:04:29.352\nThey should perform these kinds of\nexercises where they do their own\n\n78\n00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.060\nfootprinting.\n\n79\n00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.620\nThey do their own reconnaissance on what\ninformation is publicly available about\n\n80\n00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.130\norganization because a lot of companies\ndon't realize what's out there, right?\n\n81\n00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.232\nIt is better now,\n\n82\n00:04:42.232 --> 00:04:46.937\nwe're much more security conscious than\nwe were ten years ago for example.\n\n83\n00:04:46.937 --> 00:04:52.030\nSo, it's gotten much better,\nit's not quite the Wild West that it was.\n\n84\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.840\nBut still, I think a lot of organizations\nwould be surprised how much\n\n85\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.470\ninformation is available to anybody that\nchooses to go out and look for it, right?\n\n86\n00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.949\nSo, when we're talking about footprinting\nand publicly available information,\n\n87\n00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.590\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n88\n00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.850\nWell, IP addresses, right,\n\n89\n00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.530\nDNS server addresses, IP ranges,\nthese are things that I can go to.\n\n90\n00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.970\nWe could do a Whois Lookup\nat a WHOIS database.\n\n91\n00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.890\nThis is a database maintained by the\nregistrars when we register domain names.\n\n92\n00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.284\nI wanna start a company, xyz.com, right?\n\n93\n00:05:23.284 --> 00:05:24.770\nWe're gonna have a web presence.\n\n94\n00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.000\nI'm gonna need some public IP addresses.\n\n95\n00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.410\nI'm gonna go to a registrar and\nI'm going to register that name,\n\n96\n00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.800\nmake sure nobody else\nhas that name in use.\n\n97\n00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.160\nAnd I'm going to have to tell them\nwhose gonna be hosting my DNS.\n\n98\n00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.340\nSo, they can update the public DNS\nservers with that information so,\n\n99\n00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.980\npeople can get to my web page.\n\n100\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.210\nThey're gonna assign me\na block of addresses and\n\n101\n00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.180\nwhen you go through that registration you\nhave to provide information, who you are,\n\n102\n00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.470\nthe company's name, addresses,\npoint of contacts, things like this.\n\n103\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.706\nWell, all that information is available\npublicly if we're not careful, and\n\n104\n00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:00.259\nsome of it has to be, right?\n\n105\n00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.547\nI mean, they have to be able to find my\nDNS servers in order to get to my website\n\n106\n00:06:04.547 --> 00:06:07.250\nto buy my product so\nI can stay in business.\n\n107\n00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.375\nSo that's not something I can try to hide.\n\n108\n00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:10.111\n&gt;&gt;

Absolutely, and\nDaniel hit it right on the head there.\n\n404\n00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.890\nIn the code, you'd hard code credentials\nto connect to a data source or\n\n405\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.580\na database or something like that.\n\n406\n00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.430\nYou'd have paths,\n\n407\n00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:37.030\nabsolute paths in there that are telling\nyou where the scripts are located, right?\n\n408\n00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:41.050\nCuz it has to reach out, grab the script,\nand run it to display the web page.\n\n409\n00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.710\nThis is the kind of thing that\nI can get from that code.\n\n410\n00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:49.870\nComments, and I don't mean to say,\nI'm not blaming this on coders themselves.\n\n411\n00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.650\nI love the software developers and\nall of that.\n\n412\n00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:57.180\nIt was just a general mindset, I think\nat the time, that caused a lot of this.\n\n413\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.660\nBut yeah, hard-coding paths.\n\n414\n00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.960\nThe comments, we want our coders\nto comment up their code.\n\n415\n00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.000\nIt makes it easier for\nthem to work with, go back and\n\n416\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.330\ntroubleshoot, hand off to the next guy.\n\n417\n00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.110\nBut a lot of times those comments\ncan reveal a lot of information.\n\n418\n00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:14.740\nSo you got this comment over here that\nsays in case this method doesn't work,\n\n419\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.750\ncode will flip to this method.\n\n420\n00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.540\nAnd now I know if I can somehow bypass\nthat first method, I can get it to flip\n\n421\n00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.130\nover to this weaker authentication\nmethod that maybe I can compromise.\n\n422\n00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.860\nThings like that,\nthat we can get out of that code.\n\n423\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.338\nAnd it's easy to do.\n\n424\n00:21:29.338 --> 00:21:31.220\nIn fact, here, this was an unplanned demo.\n\n425\n00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.150\nLet's pull up my screen for just a second.\n\n426\n00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:40.500\nTo go to Daniel's point,\nmaybe it wasn't easy before, or as easy.\n\n427\n00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.460\nSo I go to ITProTV, any old website here.\n\n428\n00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.090\nAnd I'm in Chrome on this guy.\n\n429\n00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:49.358\nSo I'm just gonna go to More Tools,\nDeveloper Tools.\n\n430\n00:21:49.358 --> 00:21:53.190\nAnd ta-da, there's my code, all right?\n\n431\n00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.020\nLet's see if I can get this\nto stretch out that way.\n\n432\n00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.990\nThat's not how that works.\n\n433\n00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:02.450\nYeah, I can see sources, timelines,\nprofiles and I hopefully\n\n434\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.550\nthere's no information on our web pages\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n435\n00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.060\n&gt;&gt; That I'm giving away on screen here cuz\n\n436\n00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.180\nI know we have great software developers.\n\n437\n00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.740\nBut it's that easy to go and\nsee, and you can kill that.\n\n438\n00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.610\nThat's how easy it is to get\nto the code for that webpage.\n\n439\n00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:18.110\nRight?\n\n440\n00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.930\nBuilt into my browser is a way to view it.\n\n441\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:25.430\nAnd it makes sense, because that's what's\ngetting delivered to my machine and\n\n442\n00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.180\nthen it's being rendered by my browser.\n\n443\n00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.900\nSo that information has to come across.\n\n444\n00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.480\nBut there's better ways and\n\n445\n00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.790\nworse ways to do that as far as\nwhat are we putting in that code?\n\n446\n00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.470\nIs it all built back in?\n\n447\n00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.400\nAnd then the finished page\nis sent out to the client or\n\n448\n00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.905\nis a lot of the stuff being queried from\nthe client and built on the client side?\n\n449\n00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:48.130\nThat determines how much information\nwe're exposing out there.\n\n450\n00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.800\nSo publicly available information.\n\n451\n00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.350\nWe got dumpster diving, we got HTML code.\n\n452\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.990\nWe talked about social media.\n\n453\n00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:58.220\nAgain, employees,\nthey just don't understand.\n\n454\n00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:02.850\nWith a lack of education, without teaching\nthem the importance of what needs to be\n\n455\n00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:09.070\nkept secret, social media is a huge\nproblem right now, because people use it.\n\n456\n00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.830\nThey put all kinds of information in there\nthat shouldn't be available publicly,\n\n457\n00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.150\nand they're not thinking about it.\n\n458\n00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:18.450\nThey're not trying to be malicious and\nthey're not to trying to expose secrets.\n\n459\n00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.270\nThey think they're just\ntalking to their friends.\n\n460\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.200\nThey're just not realizing that, hey, your\nprivacy settings are not set up properly\n\n461\n00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.750\non your Facebook page and\nanybody can search and open up that page.\n\n462\n00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.860\nI can do a Google search, I find this\nresult that goes back to Facebook,\n\n463\n00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.760\nI click on it and, boom, there is your\nrant about our company's password policy.\n\n464\n00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.680\nTalking about, it's crazy that we have\nto change our password every 14 days and\n\n465\n00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.790\nit has to be 10 characters long.\n\n466\n00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.790\nI now know your password policy for\nyour organization.\n\n467\n00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.334\nI know you didn't mean to do that,\nbut there it is.\n\n468\n00:23:46.334 --> 00:23:50.929\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that all comes from\nthe fact that we live in a society,\n\n469\n00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:56.490\nthe younger people in our workforce\nThey come from a social media culture.\n\n470\n00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.287\nThat's all they know.\n\n471\n00:23:57.287 --> 00:24:01.039\nThey know they put their entire lives onto\nsocial media, and then they jump into\n\n472\n00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:04.180\na corporate environment where\nthere's sensitive information.\n\n473\n00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:07.740\nThey don't realize that their\njob could be sensitive.\n\n474\n00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:13.160\nThe mundane thing that they do on\na daily basis Could be the lynchpin\n\n475\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.700\nthat lets somebody understand what they\nneed to do to get into our systems.\n\n476\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.600\nSo you have to reprogram them.\n\n477\n00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.260\nOkay, I understand that you have\na personal life that everything and\n\n478\n00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.170\nits brother goes on your Facebook page and\nyour Twitter account and your Instagram.\n\n479\n00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.100\nThat's cool.\n\n480\n00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.000\nWhen it comes to our job,\ndon't put anything on there.\n\n481\n00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.780\nAnd you have to start revising\nnondisclosure agreements and\n\n482\n00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.410\nthings of that nature.\n\n483\n00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:39.910\nTo say, you will not put anything about\nour work on your social media accounts,\n\n484\n00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.215\npublic, private, whatever the case may be.\n\n485\n00:24:42.215 --> 00:24:43.500\nBecause now it's out on the Internet and\n\n486\n00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.870\nit's in an unsecured fashion,\nwe don't have control over that.\n\n487\n00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.990\nAs a company, an organization, you need\nto be able to control all information\n\n488\n00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.770\nbecause you never know\nwhat might be sensitive.\n\n489\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.540\nI mean, there are some things\nyou know are sensitive.\n\n490\n00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.520\nBut there some things that you might\nnot realize could be very sensitive.\n\n491\n00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.460\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So all this is popping up on his social\n\n507\n00:25:55.826 --> 00:25:56.950\nmedia as well.\n\n508\n00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.915\nBut and that's kinda-\n&gt;&gt; Gotta love the hashtag.\n\n509\n00:25:58.915 --> 00:26:02.405\n[LAUGH] #jobless.\n\n510\n00:26:02.405 --> 00:26:04.977\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So humorous, but it's again,\n\n511\n00:26:04.977 --> 00:26:09.117\njust an example of how people don't think\nabout what they're putting in social\n\n512\n00:26:09.117 --> 00:26:11.796\nmedia and it turns around and\nit ends up biting you.\n\n513\n00:26:11.796 --> 00:26:13.140\nSo you've gotta be careful with that.\n\n514\n00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.170\nSearch engines,\nanother great source of information.\n\n515\n00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.040\nReally, it's one of the bigger sources,\n\n516\n00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.710\nprobably, because that's all they do,\nright?\n\n517\n00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.980\n&gt;&gt; You'd be amazed what you could\ndo with a Google search bar.\n\n518\n00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.420\nIt's insane.\n\n519\n00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:30.260\n&gt;&gt; And we can go so far beyond just\nputting in words into that search bar.\n\n520\n00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:34.110\nWhen you talk about Google hacking,\nright, we're not hacking Google.\n\n521\n00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.510\nThat's not the goal here.\n\n522\n00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:41.040\nWe're using Google as a method\nto facilitate my hacking, right?\n\n523\n00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.180\nThat's what Google hacking means.\n\n524\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.945\nIt doesn't mean we're\nhacking Google servers.\n\n525\n00:26:44.945 --> 00:26:50.530\nUsing the fact that they've spidered and\nindexed the majority of the web out there.\n\n526\n00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:55.110\nAnd people don't realize, they think,\nall right I've got this website, but\n\n527\n00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.270\nif I don't put a link.\n\n528\n00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.710\nI can put a webpage, an HTML document\non my web server and as long as I don't\n\n529\n00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:05.350\nlink to it directly, you'd have to know\nthe name to type it in to get to it.\n\n530\n00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.940\nSo it's gonna be secure,\nnobody's gonna be able to find it\n\n531\n00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:11.320\ncuz I'm the only one that knows\nit's there, there's no links to it.\n\n532\n00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.736\nWell sounds good in theory, right?\n\n533\n00:27:12.736 --> 00:27:15.795\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nobody can click a link and\n\n534\n00:27:15.795 --> 00:27:16.870\nget to that page.\n\n535\n00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.060\nBut guess what?\n\n536\n00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.060\nThose Google spiders have.\n\n537\n00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.575\n&gt;&gt; That's right, the all-seeing\neye known as Google has found you.\n\n538\n00:27:21.575 --> 00:27:23.339\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] that's indexed,\n\n539\n00:27:23.339 --> 00:27:24.400\nit's out there.\n\n540\n00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.400\nI mean, you can Google search for\npassword files, and\n\n541\n00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.855\nyou'd be shocked at how\nmany you would find.\n\n542\n00:27:29.855 --> 00:27:33.060\nBecause people think, I'll put it on\nmy web server, nobody can get to it.\n\n543\n00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.270\nThat way I can get to it\nfrom anywhere I'm at.\n\n544\n00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.920\nAnd they think it's safe,\nand it's definitely not.\n\n545\n00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.790\nNow I understand that there's a lot of\ntechniques that are getting developed and\n\n546\n00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.860\nhave been developed for hiding some\nof that stuff from these spiders or\n\n547\n00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.350\nthese crawlers that these\nsearch engines use.\n\n548\n00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:52.950\nBut did you start out that way or\nhas it already been indexed somewhere?\n\n549\n00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.150\nIt's one of those things,\nit's really tough.\n\n550\n00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.460\nSo that's Google hacking.\n\n551\n00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.520\nBut just search engines in general are\ngonna to be able to pull back information,\n\n552\n00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.980\nand a good idea to use more than one.\n\n553\n00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.710\nIn fact there are some search\nengines that do just that,\n\n554\n00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:09.270\nlike I think Dogpile was\none of my dad's oldies\n\n555\n00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.530\nthat he used to use cuz it combined\nthe results of several search engines.\n\n556\n00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:17.735\nIt wasn't really a search engine itself,\nit was a way to combine multiple searches.\n\n557\n00:28:17.735 --> 00:28:21.450\nThere's different engines, have different\npages crawled, you get different results,\n\n558\n00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.380\nso usually people will try more than one.\n\n559\n00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.960\nThe other one that people don't\nthink about is metadata, right?\n\n560\n00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.790\nMetadata is data about data.\n\n561\n00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.960\nInformation about information.\n\n562\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.280\nAnd office documents, for\nexample, have metadata.\n\n563\n00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.810\nThe author, when it was created,\n\n564\n00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:41.850\nlast modified,\nwhat version of the application was used.\n\n565\n00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:46.030\nPhotos have geotagging\ninformation in there.\n\n566\n00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:50.755\nAnd people are posting these up\nto websites and social media.\n\n567\n00:28:50.755 --> 00:28:54.478\nAnd people with the right tools\ncan pull that metadata down.\n\n568\n00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:59.970\nYou've got files available,\ndocuments available on your website.\n\n569\n00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:04.740\nMaybe help documents or reference manuals\nfor product resale or what have you.\n\n570\n00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.140\nAnd you think, well that's great.\n\n571\n00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.540\nI put all these products out there so\npeople can find the owners manual for\n\n572\n00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.690\nthat lawnmower they bought ten years ago.\n\n573\n00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:16.240\nThat's great, but it's also a source of\ninformation that we might not think about.\n\n574\n00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.420\nWho was the author?\n\n575\n00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:22.170\nWhere it was created, possibly information\nabout the computer that was used, right?\n\n576\n00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.760\nThe name of the computer,\nthe operating system, the patch level.\n\n577\n00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.470\nDepends on what metadata is\nstored in those documents.\n\n578\n00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.520\nSo this can be scrubbed out of documents\nbefore they're posted up there.\n\n579\n00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:37.827\nBut it is something that we do have to\nthink about as far as a way that the bad\n\n580\n00:29:37.827 --> 00:29:43.420\nguys can gather information on our\nnetworks and on our organization.\n\n581\n00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.990\nSo in the end, footprinting is\njust gathering information.\n\n582\n00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.430\nIt's the first phase in an attack.\n\n583\n00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:54.150\nIt's really where a good\nmajority of the attack's spent.\n\n584\n00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.900\nReconnaissance, in general,\nas we go through these next two steps,\n\n585\n00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.540\nis where the majority of\nthe time is spent on an attack.\n\n586\n00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.000\nCuz the more information that\nthe bad guys can gather,\n\n587\n00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.780\nthe more successful their\nattacks will most likely be.\n\n588\n00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:09.965\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike, you definitely scared\nthe bejesus out of just about everybody.\n\n589\n00:30:09.965 --> 00:30:11.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At this point in time because\n\n590\n00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:15.980\nwe're starting to realize man, I put this\non my Twitter, I put that on my Facebook.\n\n591\n00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.560\nI might wanna go clean some stuff up,\nright?\n\n592\n00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.125\nSo if you are doing that,\nthis is a good wake up call for\n\n593\n00:30:20.125 --> 00:30:23.317\nyou to understand that when you\nput something out on social media,\n\n594\n00:30:23.317 --> 00:30:26.566\nyou're basically taking out a full\npage ad in the local newspaper or\n\n595\n00:30:26.566 --> 00:30:30.113\nthe world newspaper, that is, and\nsaying, here's some information.\n\n596\n00:30:30.113 --> 00:30:31.642\nSo be very, very careful.\n\n597\n00:30:31.642 --> 00:30:34.430\nWe wanna make sure that anything\nthat has to do with your business.\n\n598\n00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.440\nHey, personal sites are personal sites.\n\n599\n00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.180\nPut anything you feel like on there, but\n\n600\n00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.960\nbe aware that if you put anything about a\nbusiness, an organization, if you work for\n\n601\n00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.270\na government, things of that nature you\nmight be really giving up the ghost.\n\n602\n00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.864\nSo be very very careful on that.\n\n603\n00:30:46.864 --> 00:30:51.213\nAnd there's a lot of cool ways in\nwhich we can gather information and\n\n604\n00:30:51.213 --> 00:30:54.380\ndo that footprinting phase of our process.\n\n605\n00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.580\nMike, I know you got a ton\nmore information to go.\n\n606\n00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.950\nWe're just scratching\nthe surface on this section.\n\n607\n00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.760\nSo looks like we're gonna\nhave to do a part two.\n\n608\n00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.970\nI hope you're down with that.\n\n609\n00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:03.970\n&gt;&gt;

in today's episode we're continuing\non with our First Responder series from\n\n10\n00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:22.144\nCyberSec.\n\n11\n00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:24.240\nOr the Logical Operations, should I say.\n\n12\n00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.400\nLogical Operations,\nCyberSec, First Responder.\n\n13\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.630\nThat put it in the correct order for you.\n\n14\n00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.020\nAnd of course, to put us all in correct\norder with information we need to know for\n\n15\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.060\nthat very series, is our good friend,\nMr Mike Roger joining us today.\n\n16\n00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.740\nWelcome back, Mike.\n\n17\n00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.380\nHow's it going?\n\n18\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.370\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel.\n\n19\n00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.932\nThanks for having me back.\n\n20\n00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:45.990\nAll right, so we left off in that\nprevious episode talking about\n\n21\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.780\ndifferent attack tools and techniques.\n\n22\n00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.180\nAnd we kind of went through that\nfirst phase of our reconnaissance.\n\n23\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.330\nThe footprinting phase,\nwhere we're really gathering information.\n\n24\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.110\nIt's all about finding information,\nopen source, as well as closed sourced.\n\n25\n00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.040\nStuff that has to be or\nis publicly available, close sourced,\n\n26\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.640\nstuff that is not meant\nto be publicly available.\n\n27\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.530\nMaybe we figure out how\nto get that information.\n\n28\n00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.000\nWe social engineer it out of people.\n\n29\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240\nWe do get that information.\n\n30\n00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.020\nAll right,\nnext I wanna talk about scanning.\n\n31\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.610\nOnce we've gone through\nour footprinting phase,\n\n32\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.140\nour next phase is going to\nbe scanning our targets.\n\n33\n00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.120\nAnd we're trying to, again,\n\n34\n00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.370\ngather information about the targets\nthat are being attacked.\n\n35\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.110\nI should say, this is what the bad\nactors are going to be doing.\n\n36\n00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.450\nWe're here to learn how to stop that,\nnot become them.\n\n37\n00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.030\nBut remember, we want to be able\nto put your mind in their place.\n\n38\n00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.900\nIf you can think like they can,\nif you can understand the tools and\n\n39\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.070\ntechniques that they're using, you're\nbetter off in defending against them.\n\n40\n00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.460\nAll right, so scanning, it's really just a\nmore active way of gathering information.\n\n41\n00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.270\nFootprinting is a very passive thing.\n\n42\n00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.740\nI'm really not,\nI'm not breaking any systems,\n\n43\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.730\nI'm typically not breaking any laws.\n\n44\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.960\nWe're usually not crossing any lines,\n\n45\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.480\nwe're just gathering publicly\navailable information.\n\n46\n00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.560\nAgain sometimes not publicly but\ndumpster diving.\n\n47\n00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.280\nI guess dumpster diving, technically,\ncould be illegal in some areas.\n\n48\n00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.850\n&gt;&gt; Depends on where the dumpster is.\n\n49\n00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.360\nI think in the United States,\n\n50\n00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.580\nanyway, garbage that hits a curb\nis considered public domain.\n\n51\n00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.810\nAnd you can have access to it.\n\n52\n00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.420\nSo if there's a dumpster outside of the\nbuilding that's not within their confines,\n\n53\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.730\nthen it's free rein.\n\n54\n00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.320\nWhich is typically where they are now\nputting dumpsters behind gates,\n\n55\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.600\nlocked doors within their property.\n\n56\n00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.370\nSo that you have to actually\ntrespass to get to it.\n\n57\n00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so\nyou end up breaking the law.\n\n58\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.470\nAnd hopefully that slows people down.\n\n59\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.790\nBut when we get to scanning, a little bit\nmore effective, or I'm sorry, more active.\n\n60\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.980\nWe're really starting to\ntouch the systems now.\n\n61\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.650\nNow with the footprinting, we typically\ndon't touch the systems at all.\n\n62\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.710\nWe got the IP range from Whois database\nlookups, not from touching their systems.\n\n63\n00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.430\nWe've got employee contact\ninformation from social media,\n\n64\n00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.180\nnot from touching their systems.\n\n65\n00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.240\nWith scanning, we do start\ntouching the systems themselves.\n\n66\n00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.420\nWe can do port scanning, where we're\nscanning target machines looking for\n\n67\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.420\nports.\n\n68\n00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.170\nRemember a port,\nwhen we're talking about a socket, right,\n\n69\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.095\nthat two computers make when they're\ncommunicating with each other.\n\n70\n00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:20.170\nThere's three bits of information\nthat going to creating that socket.\n\n71\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.129\nYou've got your protocol that's\nbeing used, your IP address, and\n\n72\n00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:25.709\nyour port number, right?\n\n73\n00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.658\nSo TCP 12.1.2.3:80 for example.\n\n74\n00:03:30.658 --> 00:03:33.621\nThat means I'm gonna be\nusing TCP is my protocol,\n\n75\n00:03:33.621 --> 00:03:37.510\nthe IP address of that web server,\nand I wanna hit it on port 80.\n\n76\n00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.696\nCuz that's the port that it's configured\nto listen on to serve up web pages,\n\n77\n00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:44.290\nif they're using HTTP.\n\n78\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.925\nSo a computer system has, basically,\n\n79\n00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:52.159\n65,536 ports on it.\n\n80\n00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.846\nAnd you can really think of each one of\nthose ports as being a doorway into that\n\n81\n00:03:56.846 --> 00:03:58.940\ndevice or into that machine.\n\n82\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.960\nBecause it can establish\na socket to the same IP address.\n\n83\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.770\nBut each one of those ports individually\nis how our computers multi task,\n\n84\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.470\nkeep web traffic separate,\nwhat application is receiving this data.\n\n85\n00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.060\nThat port number lets it know what service\nit was going to, things like that.\n\n86\n00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.630\nBut by scanning a port or scanning ports,\nI should say, when a bad guy or\n\n87\n00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.770\na threat actor starts scanning your\nsystems, they're looking for open ports.\n\n88\n00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.640\nBecause a port can be either open or\nclosed.\n\n89\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.280\nIf it's closed, that means the, let's say,\n\n90\n00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.280\nthat server is not gonna respond to\nrequests that come across that port.\n\n91\n00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.860\nIt's just gonna ignore them.\n\n92\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.970\nIf the port is open,\nthat means it's listening on that port and\n\n93\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.600\nis allowed to establish\nconnections on that port.\n\n94\n00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.310\nAnd so the threat actors are scanning\nyour systems, looking for\n\n95\n00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.770\nthose ports that are open.\n\n96\n00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.040\nBut the ports that the servers\nare listening in, and I say server,\n\n97\n00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.770\ncould be a client machine or\nany type of device.\n\n98\n00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.050\nThat those ports are open, and I'm gonna\nbe able to potentially make a connection\n\n99\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.200\nthere, and\ntry to work my way into the system.\n\n100\n00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.230\nSo that's port scanning.\n\n101\n00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.170\nScanning those ports, and I'll show\nyou some tools we can use for that.\n\n102\n00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.775\nThings like Nmap, for example.\n\n103\n00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:12.300\nNmap is probably the most common one.\n\n104\n00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.740\nIt's available for\nboth Windows as well as Linux.\n\n105\n00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.770\nIt actually is a Linux tool that's\nbeen ported over to Windows.\n\n106\n00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:20.958\nBut it's a very easy one to use.\n\n107\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.150\nIt's a very powerful one,\nit has a lot of capabilities.\n\n108\n00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.790\nBut it'll do basic port scanning.\n\n109\n00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.970\nAnd there's dozens of tools\nthat will do port scanning.\n\n110\n00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.930\nSo we can scan certain targets\nto see what ports are open.\n\n111\n00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.370\nAnd what information does that give me,\n\n112\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.990\nother than that's a possible\nattack vector, right?\n\n113\n00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.320\nIf that port is open,\nthat's an attack vector.\n\n114\n00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.920\nI can now try to make\na connection on that port.\n\n115\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.679\nThis is why we close ports if they're not\nnecessary, or they're not being used.\n\n116\n00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:51.430\nThis is why we run firewalls at both\nthe network level and the host level.\n\n117\n00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.730\nOther information that I can\nget from just port scanning is,\n\n118\n00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.270\nI see what ports are open.\n\n119\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.440\nWell, Daniel, if I tell you that\na server is running port 80,\n\n120\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.190\nwhat does that tell you about that server?\n\n121\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.050\n&gt;&gt; It immediately let's me know that\nit's most likely a web server that we're\n\n122\n00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.800\ndealing with.\n\n123\n00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n124\n00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.390\nIt's probably running\nsome type of web service.\n\n125\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.200\nApache, IIS, something like that.\n\n126\n00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.650\nSo not only am I seeing\nwhat ports are open,\n\n127\n00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.710\nI'm starting to see what services\nare running on those servers, right?\n\n128\n00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.880\nAnd through those open ports,\nwe can do more detailed scanning.\n\n129\n00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.910\nWe can start to do banner grabbing.\n\n130\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.020\nWe can make Telnet connections.\n\n131\n00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.840\nAnd we can get more information\nabout the service that's\n\n132\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.580\nopening that port in the first place.\n\n133\n00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.840\nAnd then some of those services\nthemselves can be enumerated.\n\n134\n00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.110\nWhich we're gonna talk about\nhere in just a minute.\n\n135\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.360\nSo port scanning, very common method for\n\n136\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.370\nthe bad guys to start their\nmapping of your network.\n\n137\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.710\nJust networking scanning in general\nreally is typically the first step,\n\n138\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.100\nbecause I don't know what hosts\nyou have on that network.\n\n139\n00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.614\nMaybe I've determined that you\nleased a Class C address from IANA.\n\n140\n00:06:57.614 --> 00:07:01.050\nSo I know what your address\nrange most likely is.\n\n141\n00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.200\nBut do you have all 254\nhosts on that network?\n\n142\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.690\nOr which IP addresses are in use,\nwhich ones are dead, are not being used.\n\n143\n00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.630\nSo I can do a network scan looking for\nlive hosts,\n\n144\n00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.150\ntrying to see what IP\naddresses are responding.\n\n145\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.403\nWe can also discover other devices that\nmight be out there on that network.\n\n146\n00:07:19.403 --> 00:07:25.960\nLooking for routers, firewalls,\nand computers, right.\n\n147\n00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.430\nVulnerability scanning is another one.\n\n148\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.300\nThis is something that,\nas IT professionals,\n\n149\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.780\nwe should be doing on our own systems.\n\n150\n00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.320\nThe bad guys are definitely doing it\non your systems, if they can get in.\n\n151\n00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.650\nBecause a vulnerability scanner,\njust think about that for a second.\n\n152\n00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.930\nVulnerability scanner.\n\n153\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.040\nSomething that's scanning for\nvulnerabilities.\n\n154\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.240\nWhat's a vulnerability?\n\n155\n00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.930\nA weakness in a system.\n\n156\n00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.534\nWhat do I do with a vulnerability?\n\n157\n00:07:50.534 --> 00:07:53.558\nI find an exploit that can\nleverage that vulnerability,\n\n158\n00:07:53.558 --> 00:07:55.387\nand give me access to your system.\n\n159\n00:07:55.387 --> 00:08:00.651\nSo by doing a vulnerability scan,\nas a bad guy, That's telling me how,\n\n160\n00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:04.780\nit's helping me find ways\nto get into your system.\n\n161\n00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.940\nI can see that you're vulnerable\nto directory traversal.\n\n162\n00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.430\nSo now I know what exploit I wanna\nget to attack that vulnerability.\n\n163\n00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.980\nAnd again, there are scanners that just\n\n164\n00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.406\ndo that like Microsoft Baseline\nSecurity Analyzer for one example.\n\n165\n00:08:20.406 --> 00:08:22.901\nThere's several.\n\n166\n00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:26.210\nThey make lots of different vulnerability\nscanners and these are, again,\n\n167\n00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.040\nthings that I should run as a network\nadmin to see what I'm vulnerable against\n\n168\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.020\nso that I can do risk assessments, so\nthat I can try to patch or prevent or\n\n169\n00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.140\nmitigate or reduce some of that risk.\n\n170\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.270\nBut it's also what the bad guys are doing\nwhen they're trying to attack your\n\n171\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.690\nsystems.\n\n172\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.230\nWe also have web app scanning.\n\n173\n00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.310\nWeb applications,\n\n174\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:48.080\nextremely popular, everything is\na web app nowadays it seems like.\n\n175\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.540\nOur time clock here.\n\n176\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.570\nHey there's an app for that.\n\n177\n00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.630\nSo vulnerabilities in those apps.\n\n178\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.030\nCuz a lot of these apps that\nyou're running, you didn't write.\n\n179\n00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.630\nYou didn't create,\nyou bought from somebody.\n\n180\n00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.580\nSo you're trusting that\ntheir code is secure and\n\n181\n00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:08.300\nthat there's no vulnerabilities in that\nweb apps a lot of times are written by,\n\n182\n00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.140\nyou know, I go to my dev team,\nI say hey I need this web app.\n\n183\n00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.650\nWe need this to do this.\n\n184\n00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:19.320\nAnd we put pressures on the developers\nto get it done yesterday, right?\n\n185\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.260\nNevermind security.\n\n186\n00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:20.950\nJust get it done.\n\n187\n00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:21.809\nI've got to get it out there.\n\n188\n00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.730\nNow we've been hacked.\n\n189\n00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.220\nWhy didn't put security in this?\n\n190\n00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.040\nWhy didn't you think about security?\n\n191\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.810\nWho in the heck would\ndo this in plain text?\n\n192\n00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.830\nWell, you said to get it out yesterday.\n\n193\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.535\nI did what I had to do.\n\n194\n00:09:32.535 --> 00:09:35.128\n&gt;&gt; I can get it done quick or I can get\nit done right but you can't have both.\n\n195\n00:09:35.128 --> 00:09:36.486\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n196\n00:09:36.486 --> 00:09:40.345\nSo web app scanners,\nthey're scanning for web applications,\n\n197\n00:09:40.345 --> 00:09:45.140\napplications that are maybe not directly\nexposed, but support your web page.\n\n198\n00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.710\nAuthentication modules and\n\n199\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:52.020\nthings like that that they then\nmight be running scripting engines.\n\n200\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.670\nLook, I can see in their source code,\nit's calling PHP scripts.\n\n201\n00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.820\nIt tells me a lot about your environment,\nwhat you're using.\n\n202\n00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.290\nSo scanning for those web applications.\n\n203\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.610\nSo a lot of different scanning techniques.\n\n204\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.160\nWe'll go over a couple of\nthem here in just a minute.\n\n205\n00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:12.120\nAnd then our third one that's kinda\npart of this is going to be enumeration.\n\n206\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.380\nEnumeration is a big fancy word for\nlisting out, right?\n\n207\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:21.700\nOr creating a list and we can list\neverything and list are always good.\n\n208\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.140\nUser enumeration, right?\n\n209\n00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.010\nTrying to enumerate what user\naccounts are on that network.\n\n210\n00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.760\nThere's two things I need to\nauthenticate with somebody else.\n\n211\n00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.290\nA username and a password, right?\n\n212\n00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.970\nIf I can list out all the usernames,\nthat's half the puzzle right there.\n\n213\n00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.070\nGranted, they're typically\nnot that hard to figure out,\n\n214\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.960\nbut if the information's available,\nthat's one less thing.\n\n215\n00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.395\n&gt;&gt; I'll take 50% of the job being done for\nme any day of the week.\n\n216\n00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:46.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n217\n00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.180\none less thing that I've\ngot to struggle with.\n\n218\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.830\nSo user enumeration,\n\n219\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.230\ntry to enumerate what applications\nare being run on your systems.\n\n220\n00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:58.370\nIf I can go into a network and I can see\nthat people are running Open Office or\n\n221\n00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.710\nrunning Photoshop or\n\n222\n00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:05.850\nthey're running, gosh forbid,\nCold Fusion or something like that.\n\n223\n00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.360\nI see these applications\nrunning on these desktops,\n\n224\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.930\nI know that they've got vulnerabilities.\n\n225\n00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.860\nAnd if those applications aren't\npatched then I might be able\n\n226\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.310\nto leverage that to\ntake over that machine.\n\n227\n00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.990\nA lot of times we're bad\nabout patching our systems,\n\n228\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.060\nespecially our end user systems.\n\n229\n00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.670\nHeck, a lot of places we don't control\nwhat applications the end users\n\n230\n00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.170\nare putting on their systems.\n\n231\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:31.940\nI remember working with one organization,\nand this guy had found an application that\n\n232\n00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:37.240\ncrawled, that was basically a search\nthing a desktop search application.\n\n233\n00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.650\nNow, never mind that windows already has a\ndesktop search application built into it,\n\n234\n00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.300\nhe wanted to use this one that he'd found.\n\n235\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.540\nDidn't bother asking.\n\n236\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.040\nWent ahead and starts running it.\n\n237\n00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.750\nAnd the system there was no checks\nto make sure he was an admin,\n\n238\n00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.210\nhe was able to install it.\n\n239\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.380\nAnd not only was it indexing\nall of his files, but\n\n240\n00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.760\nall of the shares that he\nwas connected to, right?\n\n241\n00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.540\nSo the shares on the corporate servers and\nthings like that, and\n\n242\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.370\nthere's a known vulnerability found\nin this particular application.\n\n243\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.440\nAnd he opened up the entire\norganization to some serious threats.\n\n244\n00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.890\nNow nothing ever came of it and\nit was good.\n\n245\n00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.850\nWe caught it and we got rid of it, but\nthat's the kind of thing that can happen.\n\n246\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.210\nAnd that's why they're doing\napplication enumeration.\n\n247\n00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.080\nBecause they can find that\nthat one person downloaded and\n\n248\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.590\ninstalled this freeware that has\nback doors in it, all right.\n\n249\n00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.250\nSo doing an application enumeration,\nemail enumeration and\n\n250\n00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.720\njust getting email addresses.\n\n251\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.240\nThere are tons of tools, like in\nKali Linux, the Harvester, you just\n\n252\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.270\nopen a prompt, you type the harverster,\nmicrosoft.com and then the source.\n\n253\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.400\nAnd it'll go out and it'll scour looking\nfor email addresses and subdomains,\n\n254\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.850\nin this particular case, that particular\ntool, but scouring for email addresses.\n\n255\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:55.440\nYou find all these names@microsoft.com or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n256\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.080\nWhat good is that going to do me?\n\n257\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.060\nWell, now I've got something I can\ntarget with my phishing scams.\n\n258\n00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:05.570\nOr I can use it to forge an email\nthat looks like it's from\n\n259\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.890\na guy in IT at Microsoft, and\nI can send it to coworkers.\n\n260\n00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.940\nVery easy to forge email headers.\n\n261\n00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.150\nSo being able to discover\nthose emails whether it's to\n\n262\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.340\nhelp support an attack or\ncould just be selling them, right?\n\n263\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.740\nThis could be an attack\nwhere I know that I have\n\n264\n00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.950\npeople that I can sell email lists to,\nbecause they're spammers, and\n\n265\n00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.100\nthey will pay good money for\nvalid email addresses.\n\n266\n00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.860\nSo harvesting emails,\n\n267\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.780\ndoing email enumeration could\nbe to propagate an attack.\n\n268\n00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.230\nCould just be to sell that\ninformation to somebody else, or\n\n269\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:46.290\nmaybe somebody's hired me to find all\nthe email addresses of an organization.\n\n270\n00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.678\nAnd an oldie but goodie,\n\n271\n00:13:47.678 --> 00:13:51.570\nI get it all throw it in here I think for\nhumor's sake more than anything.\n\n272\n00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.250\nI guess it's still\na valid one War dialing?\n\n273\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.940\n&gt;&gt; War dialing.\n&gt;&gt; You remember those.\n\n274\n00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.760\n&gt;&gt; I've done it.\n\n275\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.540\nYou've ever done it?\n\n276\n00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n277\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.710\n&gt;&gt; My fun anecdote about\nmy first time war dialing.\n\n278\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:03.290\nI fired up.\n\n279\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:07.360\nWe live in the day and age,\nthis was back when Star 69 and\n\n280\n00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.930\nthings of that nature were very prevalent,\nI fire off the word dialer.\n\n281\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:15.100\nNot even thinking I get two,\nthree phone calls into this thing and\n\n282\n00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.420\nmy phone rings\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.050\n&gt;&gt; Going, did you just call me?\n\n284\n00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:19.060\nI am like, no.\n\n285\n00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.181\nYeah, you did and they're yelling at me.\n\n286\n00:14:21.181 --> 00:14:22.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n287\n00:14:22.067 --> 00:14:24.208\nI am like, okay, I am shutting this off.\n\n288\n00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:25.817\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I am like I guess,\n\n289\n00:14:25.817 --> 00:14:26.795\nwar dialing is over.\n\n290\n00:14:26.795 --> 00:14:28.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n291\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.050\nthey can tell where that call came from.\n\n292\n00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.790\nOf course, there's ways to fake it and\n\n293\n00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.930\nblock that stuff but yeah, war dialing,\nfor those of you that don't know,\n\n294\n00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:39.990\nthat maybe don't go back this far and\nhave somehow never seen War Games.\n\n295\n00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.530\nBecause if you haven't, stop watching\nthis video right now, go to Netflix.\n\n296\n00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.020\nNo I'm kidding, continue to watch this.\n\n297\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.430\nWhen you're done watching this.\n\n298\n00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.590\nGo check out War Games,\nyeah, it's a classic.\n\n299\n00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.570\nIt's a little old, so\nmake sure you're patient with it.\n\n300\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.760\nBut war dialing is basically\njust going through numbers.\n\n301\n00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.530\nAt the time, they were looking for\nmodems, right.\n\n302\n00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.980\nAnd so you get an exchange.\n\n303\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.940\nAnd in the US, our phone numbers are area\ncode dash three digits dash four digits.\n\n304\n00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.960\nSo I might take an area code and the first\nthree digits like Area code 352, 213.\n\n305\n00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.320\nAnd then the last four,\nI just start 0000, 0001, 0002.\n\n306\n00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:21.200\nAnd start going through this entire list.\n\n307\n00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.780\nAnd what I'd be doing was looking for\nModems, right?\n\n308\n00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.220\nIf a person answers,\nthe call gets disconnected.\n\n309\n00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.710\nIf you hear that old,\ncan you mimic the modems?\n\n310\n00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.748\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, that's never gonna happen.\n\n311\n00:15:33.748 --> 00:15:35.115\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] That kind of thing.\n\n312\n00:15:35.115 --> 00:15:37.366\n&gt;&gt; Sure was fun watching you try.\n\n313\n00:15:37.366 --> 00:15:39.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] I was hoping he would do that.\n\n314\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.160\nHe made me do it.\n\n315\n00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.321\nBut we all remember that [SOUND] noise\nthat it would make when you would,\n\n316\n00:15:44.321 --> 00:15:47.978\nsometimes you would dial the number and\nthey would have given you the fax number.\n\n317\n00:15:47.978 --> 00:15:50.437\nIf any of you remember what faxes are.\n\n318\n00:15:50.437 --> 00:15:53.953\nSo you'd dial the number and you'd\nget the fax machine on the other end.\n\n319\n00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:54.540\nGosh.\n\n320\n00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.768\nWrong number.\n\n321\n00:15:55.768 --> 00:15:59.336\nBut if I was a bad guy, and I was doing\nwardialing, that's what I'm looking for,\n\n322\n00:15:59.336 --> 00:16:00.340\nis answers like that.\n\n323\n00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.970\nCuz now I know there's a computer system\non the other end that's answering\n\n324\n00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:03.850\nthat call.\n\n325\n00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.110\nAnd this could be a new attack vector,\na vector I that I can use.\n\n326\n00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.930\nAgain, watch WarGames, and\nyou'll see what can become of that.\n\n327\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.860\nIt's not so prevalent now,\nbecause we don't have modems much anymore.\n\n328\n00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.383\nWell, not telephone modems like we had and\nfax machines.\n\n329\n00:16:18.383 --> 00:16:23.242\nAlthough, I will say that many\norganizations still run faxes, or\n\n330\n00:16:23.242 --> 00:16:25.163\nstill run phone systems.\n\n331\n00:16:25.163 --> 00:16:29.026\nPBXs, they have-\n&gt;&gt; Access servers.\n\n332\n00:16:29.026 --> 00:16:30.358\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that have modems in there.\n\n333\n00:16:30.358 --> 00:16:33.070\nAnd that's the big one that\nwe're trying to find is,\n\n334\n00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:37.060\nthat remote access server that maybe\nis answering a dial up session.\n\n335\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.370\nYou might think, why the heck?\n\n336\n00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.655\nWho in this day and\n\n337\n00:16:40.655 --> 00:16:45.545\nage is gonna be running a VPN server\nwith a telephone modem in there?\n\n338\n00:16:45.545 --> 00:16:49.745\nAnd I know you come from an organization,\nand another gentleman here, Don Pezet,\n\n339\n00:16:49.745 --> 00:16:52.692\nworked at the same organization,\ntold me great stories.\n\n340\n00:16:52.692 --> 00:16:54.540\nThere was an insurance company, right?\n\n341\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.270\nAnd here in Florida, we have hurricanes.\n\n342\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.950\nAnd so, after a hurricane comes through,\neverything gets wiped out.\n\n343\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.475\nThese insurance agents are out therein the\nfield at these places that have been wiped\n\n344\n00:17:04.475 --> 00:17:06.650\ndoing the reporting, or what have you.\n\n345\n00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.798\nAnd as the county and the state and\nthe local people come through and start\n\n346\n00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:15.439\nputting things back, after an emergency\nlike this, they have priority lists.\n\n347\n00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:19.258\nAnd I can tell you that cable\ntelevision is not on that list, or\n\n348\n00:17:19.258 --> 00:17:22.410\nit's very high up on that list, right?\n\n349\n00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:26.500\nSo, I'm not gonna be making\na connection across to high speed\n\n350\n00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.500\nback to the insurance office to\nfile this claim as an agent.\n\n351\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.100\nBut what does get put back first?\n\n352\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.440\nPower, water, phones, right?\n\n353\n00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.170\nWait, did you say phones?\n\n354\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.260\nYes, so the insurance company maintains\nservers, remote access servers that had\n\n355\n00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.980\nphones in them, modems in them so\nthat their agents could use a dialer, and\n\n356\n00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.750\nconnect back and file reports and\nclaims and get the process started.\n\n357\n00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:55.310\nSo, that's just one example of where, yes,\nthat older technology is still in play.\n\n358\n00:17:55.310 --> 00:18:00.780\nAnd it's, I'm trying to think there's\nreally two different sides to this.\n\n359\n00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.380\nIt's great for\nthe insurance company, obviously,\n\n360\n00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.990\nthey can get these claims filed.\n\n361\n00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.006\nBut it also means they're running an older\nbit technology that maybe isn't kept as up\n\n362\n00:18:08.006 --> 00:18:11.870\nto date, so it might have vulnerabilities\nthat haven't been patched.\n\n363\n00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.360\nIt could also be,\non the positive side of things,\n\n364\n00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.689\nsome of you out there have never\nheard of dial up modems, right?\n\n365\n00:18:17.689 --> 00:18:18.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so,\n\n366\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.920\nhow the heck are you gonna hack it?\n\n367\n00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.850\nYou don't even know it's there.\n\n368\n00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.100\n&gt;&gt; Talk about security through obscurity,\nright?\n\n369\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n370\n00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.186\nYeah, I remember one guy,\nI think this was a CSI, so\n\n371\n00:18:28.186 --> 00:18:34.095\nit was a television show, was not reality,\nbut he had an old laptop.\n\n372\n00:18:34.095 --> 00:18:37.450\nOne of those things was about yea thick,\nhad a five and\n\n373\n00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.910\na quarter slot on the side of it,\nand it was in this guys office.\n\n374\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.692\nAnd the CSI team had taken it back,\nand what am I going to do?\n\n375\n00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:46.538\nThis is just a piece of junk.\n\n376\n00:18:46.538 --> 00:18:49.570\nIt was probably just a keepsake or\na treasure.\n\n377\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.490\nWell, it turned out that they gutted it,\nand\n\n378\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.130\nthey put some high performance\nequipment inside there.\n\n379\n00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.950\nBut so, at first glance,\n\n380\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:02.120\nthough, yeah, it's an old laptop\nthat's just a decoration.\n\n381\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.706\nIn reality, it was-\n&gt;&gt; Camouflaged.\n\n382\n00:19:03.706 --> 00:19:04.873\n&gt;&gt; It was a cover, yeah.\n\n383\n00:19:04.873 --> 00:19:07.978\nSo again, security through obscurity.\n\n384\n00:19:07.978 --> 00:19:11.949\nYou're not gonna think it, but\nI think the funny part was they noticed it\n\n385\n00:19:11.949 --> 00:19:14.437\nbecause there was a USB\nport on the side of it.\n\n386\n00:19:14.437 --> 00:19:18.534\nAnd they're, wait a second,\nthis thing shouldn't have an USB port,\n\n387\n00:19:18.534 --> 00:19:20.804\nwhich caused further investigation.\n\n388\n00:19:20.804 --> 00:19:22.611\nSo I don't know how I got off\non that tangent, I apologize.\n\n389\n00:19:22.611 --> 00:19:24.189\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; War dialing, I think,\n\n390\n00:19:24.189 --> 00:19:24.835\nis where I was at.\n\n391\n00:19:24.835 --> 00:19:25.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n392\n00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.588\n&gt;&gt; The act of just going through.\n\n393\n00:19:26.588 --> 00:19:27.385\n&gt;&gt; You were reminiscing.\n\n394\n00:19:27.385 --> 00:19:30.106\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and how it brings back memories,\n\n395\n00:19:30.106 --> 00:19:33.720\ngoing through numbers and\nlooking for modems on the other end.\n\n396\n00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.930\nThere's lots of different terms,\nyou might hear, war walking.\n\n397\n00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:42.940\nWar dialing, war talking,\nwar driving, war flying I've heard.\n\n398\n00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.660\nThey've changed a little bit,\nmore dialing again was dialing looking for\n\n399\n00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.890\nmore phone numbers.\n\n400\n00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.360\nWar walking, talking, driving,\nflying typically looking for\n\n401\n00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.656\nopen hotspots to make connects to.\n\n402\n00:19:53.656 --> 00:19:58.210\nAll right, so\nlet's see where we want to go with that.\n\n403\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.500\nIt comes to those three phases there,\nfoot printing,\n\n404\n00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.930\nscanning, and enumeration, gathering\ninformation as the first phase in that\n\n405\n00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.660\nfoot printing phase about the target.\n\n406\n00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.270\nAs a security professional,\nwe wanted to make sure\n\n407\n00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.190\nwe understand what information is out\nthere, what can these bad guys see?\n\n408\n00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.120\nAnd is there any way,\ndoes it have to be available?\n\n409\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.310\nAnd if not, how do I pull it back?\n\n410\n00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.940\nHow do I get rid of it, make it so\nthat they can't find it or\n\n411\n00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.700\nat least make it more difficult?\n\n412\n00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.110\nWe get into the scanning phase.\n\n413\n00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.560\nWe're talking about scanning networks,\nlooking for hosts and\n\n414\n00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.460\ndevices, seeing what's out there,\nkind of getting the lay of the land.\n\n415\n00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:41.040\nScanning devices, now that I know what's\nout there, I'm gonna scan each one of\n\n416\n00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.990\nthose devices looking at ports, trying to\ndetermine what's open, what avenues or\n\n417\n00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.780\nvectors I have to get in,\nwhat services they're running,\n\n418\n00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.610\nwhat versions of those services\nare running, I can start doing operating\n\n419\n00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.720\nsystem foot printing, where I can detect\nwhat operating system they're running.\n\n420\n00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.436\nAgain, another great bit of information,\nbecause that determines\n\n421\n00:20:59.436 --> 00:21:03.870\nwhat services they're running, what\nvulnerabilities that system might have.\n\n422\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:08.360\nWhat attacks are going to work against it,\nand a numeration, listing everything out.\n\n423\n00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.350\nTaking those results, and\nstarting to generate maps of the network.\n\n424\n00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.520\nLists of users, lists of services,\n\n425\n00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.910\nlists of web applications,\nlists of vulnerabilities,\n\n426\n00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:24.390\ndoing vulnerability scanning, all of\nthat is about Information gathering.\n\n427\n00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.270\nAll right, now,\nlet's put some of this into action.\n\n428\n00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.240\nLet's take a look at some of\nthe tools we have available,\n\n429\n00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.490\nI'm just gonna demo a couple for you.\n\n430\n00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:38.220\nWe're gonna start with,\nlet's do End Map first.\n\n431\n00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.346\nSo, I've got my Kali Linux box up here,\nand\n\n432\n00:21:41.346 --> 00:21:44.821\nI'm gonna log in with my\nsuper secret password.\n\n433\n00:21:46.732 --> 00:21:51.297\nKali is just a distribution of Linux, it's\na great one in my opinion, because it has\n\n434\n00:21:51.297 --> 00:21:55.420\na lot of the tools, especially\nthe security related tools, preloaded.\n\n435\n00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.300\nI don't have to go out and\n\n436\n00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.150\nfind them, it's got an extensive\nselection software on here.\n\n437\n00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.150\nBut any Linux box that you get,\nany Windows box, for\n\n438\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:08.090\nthat matter, you can always download\nNmap and install if it doesn't have it.\n\n439\n00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.760\nGo to nmap.org, and\nyou can download this program.\n\n440\n00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:16.390\nIt's been around for ages,\nit is one of the most common scanners.\n\n441\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.700\nIt's lightweight, it's quick,\nit's easy to work with.\n\n442\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.763\nSo, all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open\nup a terminal here on my Kali box,\n\n443\n00:22:23.763 --> 00:22:27.996\nand let's see, we might wanna\nbump that up just a wee bit, so\n\n444\n00:22:27.996 --> 00:22:31.908\nlet me edit by a profile,\nI think is where I can do that.\n\n445\n00:22:31.908 --> 00:22:38.441\nLet's change that font a little bit,\n\n446\n00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:43.136\nlet's do custom font, and\n\n447\n00:22:43.136 --> 00:22:47.228\nlet's change that to.\n\n448\n00:22:56.075 --> 00:22:59.410\nThere we go, hopefully that's a little\nbit easier for you to see out there.\n\n449\n00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:03.790\nSo Nmap, N-M-A-P, all right,\nI'm just gonna type Nmap and hit Enter.\n\n450\n00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.500\nWhat it's gonna do,\nis it's gonna show me basically some\n\n451\n00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:16.700\ninstructions on how to use Nmap,\nall right?\n\n452\n00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.090\nGet the right page out here.\n\n453\n00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.210\nSo, if we take a look here,\n\n454\n00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:23.150\nthere's target specification,\nhow do I specify the target?\n\n455\n00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:26.440\nI can use a list, I can do random targets.\n\n456\n00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.330\nWe can exclude certain hosts.\n\n457\n00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.845\nWe can have a file, and\n\n458\n00:23:29.845 --> 00:23:32.585\nI'm not gonna go through all of\nthese options, but you should.\n\n459\n00:23:32.585 --> 00:23:35.215\nRight, you should go through here and\ntake a look at the different switches.\n\n460\n00:23:35.215 --> 00:23:41.815\nYou can also go to nmap.org and\nyou can get your help there,\n\n461\n00:23:41.815 --> 00:23:47.227\nHost Discovery if I want\nto do a Ping scan, -sn.\n\n462\n00:23:47.227 --> 00:23:50.797\nKeep in mind that switches for\nNmap are gonna be case sensitive.\n\n463\n00:23:50.797 --> 00:23:55.659\nSo, there's a difference between a little\ns and a big S, a little o and a big O.\n\n464\n00:23:55.659 --> 00:23:57.687\nMake sure you pay attention to that.\n\n465\n00:23:57.687 --> 00:24:01.888\nPing scan, this is typically what I\ndo when I'm first scanning a network,\n\n466\n00:24:01.888 --> 00:24:05.010\nbecause this is how I'm going\nto find the live hosts.\n\n467\n00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:10.578\nI might start with the entire\nnetwork range, when I do 168.1.0/24.\n\n468\n00:24:10.578 --> 00:24:14.269\nAnd run a ping sweep, is what I\nlike to call them, but a ping scan.\n\n469\n00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:17.650\nAnd you're just pinging each one of those\nhosts or each one of those IP addresses,\n\n470\n00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.020\nand seeing which ones are up and\nresponding.\n\n471\n00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.520\nIt's no guarantee that you've\nfound all the live hosts.\n\n472\n00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.000\nThere could be one that's rebooting,\nor not responding, or\n\n473\n00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.320\npowered off, but\nat least you're not doing all 255, right?\n\n474\n00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.940\nThis allows me to start narrowing\nthat list down of possible targets\n\n475\n00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.170\nby looking for live hosts.\n\n476\n00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:42.472\nAnother one that you should\nbe familiar with is going\n\n477\n00:24:42.472 --> 00:24:48.497\nto be some of the different scan\ntechniques that we can use,\n\n478\n00:24:48.497 --> 00:24:53.678\nlike whether I wanna do a stealth scan,\na TCP scan,\n\n479\n00:24:53.678 --> 00:25:00.570\na UDP scan, XMAS scans where we light\nup all the flags in the packet.\n\n480\n00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.156\nPlus a great way to start\nlearning your networking,\n\n481\n00:25:03.156 --> 00:25:05.940\ncuz you've really gotta\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n482\n00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.680\nPort specified ranges.\n\n483\n00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:13.745\nSo when we start doing port scanning,\ndo I wanna scan all 65,535 ports?\n\n484\n00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:16.030\nDo I wanna do just the well-known ports?\n\n485\n00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.570\nDo I wanna do just the top ports?\n\n486\n00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:22.290\nFew different switches we can use there,\nbut -p and\n\n487\n00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:26.170\nthen you can do, like,\n1-1024 to scan the first 1,024 ports.\n\n488\n00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.670\nTop ports is actually a great one to use.\n\n489\n00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.230\nGoogle that, go out and take a look\nat nmap.org or Google top ports.\n\n490\n00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.197\nAnd you'll find that through their\nresearch, extensive research.\n\n491\n00:25:38.197 --> 00:25:40.340\nThis thing, this has been around forever.\n\n492\n00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:46.436\nThey have found that, scanning for\n65,000 ports can take some time.\n\n493\n00:25:46.436 --> 00:25:49.044\nIt can also generate a lot\nof noise on the network and\n\n494\n00:25:49.044 --> 00:25:51.980\nstart setting off intrusion\ndetection systems.\n\n495\n00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.638\nAnd what they've found is\nthat if you do top ten,\n\n496\n00:25:54.638 --> 00:25:57.740\nit'll scan the top ten most common ports.\n\n497\n00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.750\nNot ports one through ten, but\nthe top ten most commonly used ports.\n\n498\n00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.864\nAnd if you do a top ports 100.\n\n499\n00:26:04.864 --> 00:26:07.950\nI think the, I forget the exact numbers so\ndon't quote me on this.\n\n500\n00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:13.922\nBut it says you'll get like 98% of\nthe open ports, if you do like a top 100.\n\n501\n00:26:13.922 --> 00:26:15.937\nJust because there's ports\nthat are commonly used and\n\n502\n00:26:15.937 --> 00:26:18.170\nthere's ports that are rarely ever used,\nright?\n\n503\n00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.850\nSo it's a great way to\ntrim your scan time down.\n\n504\n00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.010\nSV for version information.\n\n505\n00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.130\nI'm going to do a little\nOS detection in a minute.\n\n506\n00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:33.830\nAnd we'll see how we can throw some Vs\nin there to do some version information.\n\n507\n00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.220\nA little v is for verbose.\n\n508\n00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.920\nA lot of these, you can add a little v\nto and you can get more information.\n\n509\n00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.960\nYou can do a double v,\nlike a -vv, for very verbose and\n\n510\n00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.445\nget even more detailed information back.\n\n511\n00:26:48.445 --> 00:26:52.380\nNmap has a ton of scripts built into it.\n\n512\n00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.792\nThey've got their own scripting language,\nwhat is it, Lua?\n\n513\n00:26:54.792 --> 00:26:55.327\n&gt;&gt; Lua, yeah.\n\n514\n00:26:55.327 --> 00:26:58.283\n&gt;&gt; Lua, and\nit uses the Nmap scripting engine.\n\n515\n00:26:58.283 --> 00:27:02.411\nAnd there are scripts built in\nto Nmap that you can use, or\n\n516\n00:27:02.411 --> 00:27:05.090\nyou can write your own scripts.\n\n517\n00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:09.280\nAnd these are scripts that can\nautomate like SNB enumeration or\n\n518\n00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.030\nSMPT enumeration or\nvulnerability scans on SNB ports.\n\n519\n00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.370\nThere are scripts built in\nto do that with Nmap so\n\n520\n00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.690\nit's more than just a port scanner.\n\n521\n00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.550\nOS detection is another one they\nspecifically call out in the exam\n\n522\n00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:22.390\nobjectives.\n\n523\n00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.260\nThere's a capital O, is OS detection.\n\n524\n00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:30.340\nNow what it's doing is it's looking\nat the results of the scan.\n\n525\n00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:35.117\nDifferent operating systems respond\nto closed ports versus open ports\n\n526\n00:27:35.117 --> 00:27:38.600\ndifferently, so\nit can use that information.\n\n527\n00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.890\nWhat ports are open,\nwhat services are running.\n\n528\n00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:44.910\nThey can use that information to\ntry to guess the operating system.\n\n529\n00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:45.752\nAnd that's what it's doing.\n\n530\n00:27:45.752 --> 00:27:49.310\nIt's doing an educated guess, all right?\n\n531\n00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:52.860\nWe can get in a firewall\nof an IDS invasion.\n\n532\n00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.550\n&gt;&gt; Invasion.\n\n533\n00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That -d is fantastic because it allows\n\n534\n00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.430\nyou to say, here's some decoys.\n\n535\n00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:59.950\nBecause you're gonna\ngenerate some traffic.\n\n536\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.812\nEspecially when you're doing things like\na TCP connect scan, you're actually going.\n\n537\n00:28:03.812 --> 00:28:06.770\nThere's gonna be logs that you\nactually made contact with this thing.\n\n538\n00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.675\nBut scanning's a very common thing.\n\n539\n00:28:08.675 --> 00:28:12.910\nSo if I just add, find some live\nhosts out on the Internet and\n\n540\n00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:18.270\nadd them as decoys, well they'll all\nscan the machine at the same time and\n\n541\n00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.430\nthe network administrator don't know\nwhich one is the actual offender.\n\n542\n00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:22.786\nSo it's a nice way to get around it.\n\n543\n00:28:22.786 --> 00:28:24.215\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n544\n00:28:24.215 --> 00:28:26.630\nYou can spoof your source IP address.\n\n545\n00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.063\nYeah, those packets came from Daniel,\nnot me.\n\n546\n00:28:29.063 --> 00:28:31.480\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n547\n00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.040\nOutput is another one that\nwe need to be familiar with.\n\n548\n00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.170\nNormally, when you do Nmap from\nthe command prompt here, it's gonna, or\n\n549\n00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.630\nthe terminal in this case, it's gonna\ndump it right out to screen, my results.\n\n550\n00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.532\nA lot of times I wanna\nsave that information.\n\n551\n00:28:44.532 --> 00:28:50.060\nI wanna put it in a database for\nevaluation purposes later.\n\n552\n00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:55.060\nI can use this, you can output it\nin normal, XML, grepable format.\n\n553\n00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.810\nWhich for you Linux people, you'll know\nwhat I'm talking about there with grep.\n\n554\n00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:03.389\nIt's great because I, typically what I do\nwhen I start an attack on a network, or\n\n555\n00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:06.161\na penetration test,\nlet's say, not an attack.\n\n556\n00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:07.180\nBecause I have permission.\n\n557\n00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.310\nI'm ethical.\n\n558\n00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.950\nYou scan the entire network looking for\nlive hosts.\n\n559\n00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.230\nAnd so you get these results and\nit has your live host, but\n\n560\n00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.130\nthere's a lot of other\ninformation on those lines.\n\n561\n00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:21.580\nYou do it as a grepable output and\nyou can grep for up or\n\n562\n00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:26.310\nwhatever the word may be in that line,\nhost colon or what have you.\n\n563\n00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:31.310\nAnd then you can do a cut, and I know on\nNmap it's typically the second field,\n\n564\n00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:35.010\nso a -d, or what is it?\n\n565\n00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:42.435\nDash, God if I can remember, -d, no, cut\n-d quote space quote, and I'll show you.\n\n566\n00:29:42.435 --> 00:29:45.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And -f2, to get the second field.\n\n567\n00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.463\nAnyway the point is,\nI can take the results, and\n\n568\n00:29:48.463 --> 00:29:52.613\nend up with just a list of IP addresses\nby using grep and my cut command.\n\n569\n00:29:52.613 --> 00:29:58.850\nAnd now, I've got a file that has one\nIP address on each line of live hosts.\n\n570\n00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:03.450\nI can then take that, and\nuse it as my input for my next scan.\n\n571\n00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.430\nWhere I'm gonna say,\nokay now I wanna do a deeper scan.\n\n572\n00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.580\nI did a port scan to find my live hosts.\n\n573\n00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.530\nNow, the ones that are up and live,\nI want to do a quick port scan on it and\n\n574\n00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.120\nscan the top 50 ports, right?\n\n575\n00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.470\nWell, I've got a list of IP addresses.\n\n576\n00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.740\nSo I don't have to do every\nsingle IP address again,\n\n577\n00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.690\nknowing that half of them are down.\n\n578\n00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.490\nSo really cool stuff that\nyou can do with Nmap.\n\n579\n00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.041\nI know I wanna show you some of this, but\n\n580\n00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:25.830\nit looks like we're out of time for\nthis one.\n\n581\n00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:26.767\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n582\n00:30:26.767 --> 00:30:30.610\nyou're gonna have to come back\nto see me actually use Nmap.\n\n583\n00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:32.990\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and it'll make a great\npart three for all of us, right?\n\n584\n00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.740\nThis is really a good stopping spot.\n\n585\n00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.536\nWe understand what's gonna happen on it,\nwhat with the scan.\n\n586\n00:30:37.536 --> 00:30:41.110\nNow Mike can just jump right\ninto demonstrating those.\n\n587\n00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.510\nSo I look forward to that and\nhopefully you do as well.\n\n588\n00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:46.440\nAnd you'll join us back for\nthat part three but Mike's right,\n\n589\n00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.350\nwe're totally out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n590\n00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.580\nSo it looks like it's time for\nus to sign off.\n\n591\n00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.210\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n592\n00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:54.000\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n593\n00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.143\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n594\n00:30:56.145 --> 00:31:02.108\n[MUSIC]\n\n595\n00:31:02.108 --> 00:31:05.319\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.632\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.632 --> 00:00:11.894\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:13.575\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.544\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:21.205\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are back with more of\n\n8\n00:00:21.205 --> 00:00:24.756\nour logical operations\nCyberSec First Responder series and\n\n9\n00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:27.137\none of our lovely parts going into this.\n\n10\n00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:29.846\nWe are into a part three,\nbut very cool stuff today.\n\n11\n00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:32.216\nWe are talking about scanning and\nenumeration,\n\n12\n00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:34.010\nall sorts of very cool things.\n\n13\n00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.320\nMike is joining us today.\n\n14\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.824\nMike, we're so glad to have you back man.\n\n15\n00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:37.644\nHow's it going today?\n\n16\n00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:40.585\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, and I'm excited\ncuz now we're going to actually demo\n\n17\n00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:43.585\nsome of the stuff that we have been\ntalking about, so some cool stuff here.\n\n18\n00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:48.692\nWe are gonna be doing a little bit of\nwork with Nmap as well as Wireshark.\n\n19\n00:00:48.692 --> 00:00:52.212\nSo on our previous episode,\nwe were talking about scanning,\n\n20\n00:00:52.212 --> 00:00:55.271\nwe were talking about foot printing and\nnumeration.\n\n21\n00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:59.114\nWe said scanning is where we start\ntouching the systems where were gonna\n\n22\n00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:02.397\nstart gathering information\nabout what systems they have?\n\n23\n00:01:02.397 --> 00:01:04.174\nWhere the live hosts are?\n\n24\n00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:07.686\nCuz hopefully in the foot printing phase,\nwe've got a IP address ranges,\n\n25\n00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:09.538\nwe've got an idea of where things are.\n\n26\n00:01:09.538 --> 00:01:13.366\nNow, we just need to find out what's\nactually there, cuz we know you\n\n27\n00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:17.466\nget a class c or a class b address from\nIANA, you're not using all of them.\n\n28\n00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.630\nSo I need to figure out\nwhere those live hosts are.\n\n29\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.963\nNmap is one of those\npremiere tools doing that.\n\n30\n00:01:22.963 --> 00:01:26.788\nIt's quick, light weight,\neasy to get installed,\n\n31\n00:01:26.788 --> 00:01:30.192\nif it's not already and\nwe can use that to scan.\n\n32\n00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:32.891\nSo let's do that,\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n33\n00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:38.710\nAgain, I've got my Kali Linux box fired\nup, and I've got my terminal open.\n\n34\n00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.394\nAnd if we just type in nmap,\nwe get all of our instructions.\n\n35\n00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:46.720\nWell a brief review of\nthe possible switches.\n\n36\n00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.241\n&gt;&gt; Man, Nmap for more information.\n\n37\n00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:48.993\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n38\n00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:50.192\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just right on time.\n\n39\n00:01:50.192 --> 00:01:54.786\nWe could do man, short for manual, nmap,\n\n40\n00:01:54.786 --> 00:01:59.519\nand we'll get a large file of information.\n\n41\n00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:05.069\nYes, some very detailed Information\non uses, options, switches,\n\n42\n00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.145\nall of that good stuff, and\nwe press Q to get out of that man page,\n\n43\n00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:13.170\nor you can always go out to nmap.org.\n\n44\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.822\nThey got great documentation out there.\n\n45\n00:02:15.822 --> 00:02:19.244\nThere's lots of websites you can find\nwith little cheat sheets and people,\n\n46\n00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:20.859\nyou can combine switches, right?\n\n47\n00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.730\nAll these different commands.\n\n48\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.170\nWe can start combining them together\nlike OS detection, versioning,\n\n49\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.135\nwhat ports we're hitting,\nthings like that.\n\n50\n00:02:30.135 --> 00:02:30.875\n&gt;&gt; Timing options.\n\n51\n00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:35.112\n&gt;&gt; Timing options, and so you could\nstring a bunch of these options together.\n\n52\n00:02:35.112 --> 00:02:37.010\nAnd there's a lot of sites out there,\n\n53\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.730\nI see people that have\ndone that quite some time.\n\n54\n00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.362\nThis is the set of scan options that I\nuse, that gives me the best results.\n\n55\n00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:46.780\nSo you'll develop your own, but\nyou can try other people's as well.\n\n56\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.076\nSo let's take a look,\nI keep talking and keep talking.\n\n57\n00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:51.491\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's actually do something here.\n\n58\n00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:54.982\nSo if I wanna do like just\na simple ping scan, all right?\n\n59\n00:02:54.982 --> 00:03:02.208\nThat's Nmap, and we know it's a -s and\nthen n, little s, little n.\n\n60\n00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:06.560\nSo little s, scan type, little n for\nbasically no port scans.\n\n61\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.338\nSo we're just gonna limit this to ping,\nignore port scans and\n\n62\n00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:12.940\nI'm gonna type in my address range.\n\n63\n00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.101\nWe'll do, that is not right.\n\n64\n00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:17.196\nLet's try that again with a num\nlock key on, 10.0.100.0/24.\n\n65\n00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:21.667\nAll right, I'm gonna\n\n66\n00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:26.612\nlimit this a little bit.\n\n67\n00:03:26.612 --> 00:03:29.293\nI don't need to scan the entire\nITPro.TV network, and\n\n68\n00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:31.412\nwe don't want the results\nto take too long.\n\n69\n00:03:31.412 --> 00:03:34.656\nAnd so there we go, here's my results.\n\n70\n00:03:34.656 --> 00:03:37.461\nAnd I can see it looks like\nI got three live hosts here.\n\n71\n00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:41.239\nI've got 10.0.100.101,\n\n72\n00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.134\n100.200, and then 100.99, right?\n\n73\n00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:52.018\nAnd it did that,\n265 IP addresses in 3.51 seconds, right?\n\n74\n00:03:52.018 --> 00:03:55.110\nAnd I determined that I\nonly have three live hosts.\n\n75\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.241\nAnd that's what I'm saying,\n\n76\n00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:58.341\nthe first think you wanna do\nis discover your live hosts.\n\n77\n00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:00.950\nBecause if I'm gonna turn around and\nstart doing deeper scans.\n\n78\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.454\nI don't wanna hit the other 253\naddresses that there's no hosts on.\n\n79\n00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:06.970\nThat's just a waste of time.\n\n80\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.050\nIt's gonna generate noise and\nincrease the possibility or the likelihood\n\n81\n00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.530\nthat I'm going to be detected or I'm gonna\nset off intrusion detection systems.\n\n82\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.160\nSo that gives us our live host, so\nlittle s, little, n is a good one to know.\n\n83\n00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.898\nAnother one that they call out\nspecifically is a TCP connect scan.\n\n84\n00:04:26.898 --> 00:04:29.940\nAnd we'll just kind of cheat here and\nchange my options.\n\n85\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.797\nThat's gonna be little s, capital T.\n\n86\n00:04:33.797 --> 00:04:39.923\nLittle s, capital T for\na TCP connect scan, all right.\n\n87\n00:04:39.923 --> 00:04:45.568\nAnd actually, I should have used my,\nthat might take just a little while.\n\n88\n00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:48.516\nLet's not do that,\nI'm gonna do Ctrl+C to end that.\n\n89\n00:04:48.516 --> 00:04:52.943\nAnd let's just do that against one machine\nrather than the entire network range.\n\n90\n00:04:52.943 --> 00:04:59.222\nNow that I know my live hosts,\nwe'll try 101 first, all right?\n\n91\n00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:02.492\nNow TCP and there's my results, and\nwe'll talk about these in a second.\n\n92\n00:05:02.492 --> 00:05:04.801\nLet me explain to you what's\ngoing on here, right.\n\n93\n00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:07.470\nWe're gonna talk about a TCP connection,\n\n94\n00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.406\nwhen two nodes connect using\ntransmission control protocol.\n\n95\n00:05:11.406 --> 00:05:16.222\nIt is a connection oriented service, that\nmeans there is a connection established\n\n96\n00:05:16.222 --> 00:05:19.475\nand there is guaranteed\ndelivery meaning I can verify.\n\n97\n00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:23.510\nThe other ends gonna verify for\nme that they received the packet and\n\n98\n00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.540\nthe packet was intact.\n\n99\n00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.250\nKind of like doing certified mail,\nwhere the other end has to sign for\n\n100\n00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.500\nit saying that they got it, so\nthey can't say that they didn't get it.\n\n101\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.810\nWith TCP, to establish that connection,\n\n102\n00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.110\nwe go through what's called\na three way handshake.\n\n103\n00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.764\nThere's the TCP three way handshake,\nand the originator of the conversation,\n\n104\n00:05:43.764 --> 00:05:46.924\nlet's say, I'm a node and\nDaniel's a node, right?\n\n105\n00:05:46.924 --> 00:05:48.968\nIf I want to connect to Daniel,\n\n106\n00:05:48.968 --> 00:05:53.309\nwhat I'm gonna do is send an initial\npacket known as a SIN packet.\n\n107\n00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:57.139\nThat means I'm gonna send a TCP IPP\npacket over to Daniel's address.\n\n108\n00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.277\nAnd in that packet there are flags\nthat we can raise, basically,\n\n109\n00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.243\nbits that we can turn on or off.\n\n110\n00:06:03.243 --> 00:06:08.400\nAnd I'm gonna turn on the syn flag,\nsyn is short for synchronization.\n\n111\n00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.180\nSo what I'm doing is I'm saying,\nhey, Daniel, I wanna talk to you.\n\n112\n00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.570\nLet's synchronize so\nthat we're on the same page.\n\n113\n00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.667\nTalking about timing is what\nwe're really synchronizing.\n\n114\n00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:21.500\nAnd sequence numbers is what\nwe're gonna start synchronizing.\n\n115\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.430\nSo Daniel,\n\n116\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.600\nif he's the node that I'm trying to talk\nto, is gonna receive that sent request.\n\n117\n00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.630\nHe'll say, look Mike wants to talk to me,\nhe's requesting synchronization.\n\n118\n00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.980\nSo Daniel is gonna send a packet back,\nthat is gonna have two flags raised.\n\n119\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.693\nIt's gonna have the acknowledgement flag\nraised to acknowledge my synchronization\n\n120\n00:06:39.693 --> 00:06:43.237\nrequest, and it's gonna\nsynchronization request of his own.\n\n121\n00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:46.821\nWe call it the SYN-ACK packet, because\nhe's sending back a packet that has\n\n122\n00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:50.000\nthe SYN flag raised, and\nthe acknowledgement flag raised.\n\n123\n00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.420\nSo he's acknowledging\nthe initial SYN request, and\n\n124\n00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.680\nhe's requesting\na synchronization of his own.\n\n125\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.850\nAnd when I get that SYN-ACK packet,\nI say, look Daniel, does want to talk.\n\n126\n00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.050\nHe acknowledged my synchronization request\nand he sent me a synchronization request.\n\n127\n00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.683\nAnd now I'm gonna send back a final\npacket, an acknowledgement.\n\n128\n00:07:07.683 --> 00:07:11.450\nThat's going to acknowledge\nhis synchronization request.\n\n129\n00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.860\nOnce that third packet goes back,\nnow we have established a connection and\n\n130\n00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.430\nwe can start sending data back and forth.\n\n131\n00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.855\nThat's the TCP three way handshake.\n\n132\n00:07:19.855 --> 00:07:24.002\nSYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, right?\n\n133\n00:07:24.002 --> 00:07:25.857\nSYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK.\n\n134\n00:07:25.857 --> 00:07:29.021\nAnd when we use this scan,\nthe reason I go off on that.\n\n135\n00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:34.056\nWhen we do a -s big T, capital T,\nthat's what we're doing, is a TCP connect.\n\n136\n00:07:34.056 --> 00:07:37.452\nAnd what it's trying to do,\nbecause I didn't limit port numbers.\n\n137\n00:07:37.452 --> 00:07:39.425\nIt's actually going through each port and\n\n138\n00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:42.013\nit's trying to establish\na connection on those ports.\n\n139\n00:07:42.013 --> 00:07:45.352\nAnd if it gets back a SYN-ACK and\nthen I do an ACK,\n\n140\n00:07:45.352 --> 00:07:50.254\nI've got that handshake set up then\nthat port shows up as open, right?\n\n141\n00:07:50.254 --> 00:07:53.984\nSo that's my TCP connect scan.\n\n142\n00:07:53.984 --> 00:07:56.648\nIt's a good scan to do\nwhen you're looking for\n\n143\n00:07:56.648 --> 00:07:59.392\nopen ports although it is a noisy scan,\nright?\n\n144\n00:07:59.392 --> 00:08:02.264\nIt's got a lot of packets going back and\nforth, it's establishing that,\n\n145\n00:08:02.264 --> 00:08:03.047\nthere's a record.\n\n146\n00:08:03.047 --> 00:08:07.176\nMost likely on the other end of who sent\nme the initial SYN packet, all right?\n\n147\n00:08:07.176 --> 00:08:09.770\nSo it's not a very stealthy scan.\n\n148\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:15.250\nThis is not something you're gonna do\nwhen you're trying to avoid detection.\n\n149\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.010\nBut let's take a look at my results here.\n\n150\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.663\n&gt;&gt; It looks like you found yourself\na Windows machine there, Mike.\n\n151\n00:08:20.663 --> 00:08:22.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really does, doesn't it?\n\n152\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.230\nAnd evidently,\nmy zoom is not working too well on.\n\n153\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.260\nBut anyway, we can see,\nit says that the host is up, right?\n\n154\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.410\nSo it'll send an initial ping,\nand then my ports,\n\n155\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.310\nI can see these are the ports\nthat this system has open, right?\n\n156\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:42.070\nI can see port 135, MSRPC,\nRemote procedure call.\n\n157\n00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.120\nI got to my NetBios port 139.\n\n158\n00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.510\nAnd I got 445, Microsoft DS.\n\n159\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.994\nAnd I've got 3389.\n\n160\n00:08:50.994 --> 00:08:52.340\nMswbt dash server.\n\n161\n00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.560\nWe know that's probably remote\ndesktop on this machine.\n\n162\n00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:02.030\nAnd yeah, a good indication that this very\nwell could be a Windows machine, right?\n\n163\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:07.940\nThe MAC address is showing as Microsoft,\nand that's because of the identifier\n\n164\n00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.820\nout here that's been assigned to different\nvendors to create their network adapters.\n\n165\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.730\nIn my case,\nit's actually running on a HyperV server.\n\n166\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.260\nSo those MAC addresses are generated, and\n\n167\n00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.500\nthe pool of addresses has\nbeen assigned to Microsoft.\n\n168\n00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.841\nSo anything running on my\nHyper-V Server or what have you,\n\n169\n00:09:23.841 --> 00:09:27.197\nis actually gonna show up his Windows\nas far as the MAC address goes.\n\n170\n00:09:27.197 --> 00:09:31.420\nIt's really all it's telling you is that\nthat MAC address is assigned to Microsoft.\n\n171\n00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.940\nOr that's the vendor.\n\n172\n00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.100\nI forget the OUID or OID that's out there.\n\n173\n00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.504\nThat's the first six digits in\nthe MAC address, all right?\n\n174\n00:09:39.504 --> 00:09:41.708\nBut the important thing\nhere is the scan itself.\n\n175\n00:09:41.708 --> 00:09:46.542\n-sT gives you your TCP scan, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:50.520\nWhat if I want to run,\nI want to do some OS detection.\n\n177\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.330\nNow that I've scanned that machine,\n\n178\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.920\nI see the ports that are open,\nI wanna do a little OS detection.\n\n179\n00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.214\nFor that, we're gonna do nmap -O,\nall right,\n\n180\n00:10:01.214 --> 00:10:06.140\nand my address 10.0.100.101.\n\n181\n00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.470\nAnd we'll let it run.\n\n182\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.040\nSo capital O for\noperating system detection.\n\n183\n00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.010\nAnd there's my results.\n\n184\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.300\nAgain, I see the port scans.\n\n185\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.240\nIt does another port scan on there.\n\n186\n00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.930\nAnd then, right below that, look at that.\n\n187\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.310\nMicrosoft Windows 10.\n\n188\n00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.590\nAll right.\n\n189\n00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.180\nIt even tells me some\nbuild information there.\n\n190\n00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.920\nDistance one hop away.\n\n191\n00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.480\nSo that's what that capital O.\n\n192\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.380\nLet's try the other one.\n\n193\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.156\nLet's try 200.\n\n194\n00:10:35.523 --> 00:10:37.107\nWith that same capital O and\nsee what happens.\n\n195\n00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:42.350\nAll right, again,\nwhy do we wanna know the operating system?\n\n196\n00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.200\nBecause that tells me what\nvulnerabilities they might have.\n\n197\n00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.330\nAll right?\n\n198\n00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.090\nI know that Windows 10 is bullet-proof and\nhas no vulnerabilities.\n\n199\n00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.160\nSo now I know I'm done.\n\n200\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, plus you're gonna\nkind of waste your time trying to\n\n201\n00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.360\ndo some attack that works\nonly on Windows machines.\n\n202\n00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.530\nIf they're running a Linux machine and\nthen vice versa, right?\n\n203\n00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.440\nIt doesn't make sense to, that's\nscript kiddie level stuff, right guys?\n\n204\n00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.842\nThat, I have a script that does something,\nthere's a live machine,\n\n205\n00:11:07.842 --> 00:11:11.488\nchuck it and the kitchen sink at it,\nand so, hopefully I come a [INAUDIBLE].\n\n206\n00:11:11.488 --> 00:11:13.038\nIf not, well, I'll go to the next thing.\n\n207\n00:11:13.038 --> 00:11:14.937\nI'm just looking for whatever can happen,\n\n208\n00:11:14.937 --> 00:11:17.020\nwhere here I wanna start\nbeing more targeted.\n\n209\n00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.410\nI wanna be that professional level.\n\n210\n00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.870\nI wanna say, okay, this is a Microsoft\noperating system of some ilk.\n\n211\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.260\nIt's Windows 10, great.\n\n212\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.800\nI've got my Windows 10\nexploits right here,\n\n213\n00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.580\nmaybe one of those will work on this.\n\n214\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.890\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n215\n00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.050\nAll right now, take a look at the results\nof the second one I did, 100.200.\n\n216\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.780\nAnd I could see a lot more ports are open.\n\n217\n00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.140\nA lot more ports are open.\n\n218\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.430\nA lot of different services\nthat it's listing there.\n\n219\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.816\nAnd as I scroll down,\nI did the same switch -O, right?\n\n220\n00:11:44.816 --> 00:11:49.619\nActually warning, OS scan results may\nbe unreliable because we couldn't find\n\n221\n00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:52.880\nat least one open and one closed port.\n\n222\n00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.787\nActually it did find open ports and closed\nports but sometimes the script kinda,\n\n223\n00:11:57.787 --> 00:12:02.477\ndepending on how the ports are responding,\nit basically, if you look at nmap\n\n224\n00:12:02.477 --> 00:12:07.702\ndocumentation, it'll say that it's less\nthan ideal conditions for OS detection.\n\n225\n00:12:07.702 --> 00:12:11.340\nSo I can see just guessing,\nI love the way they do that.\n\n226\n00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.650\nThis is a stab in the dark,\nbut here's what we got,\n\n227\n00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.380\nand it's better than nothing right?\n\n228\n00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.430\nAnd it's actually, usually,\nrelatively accurate.\n\n229\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.330\nIt also tells you hey, if you know\nthat this is wrong, let us know,\n\n230\n00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.180\nbecause they can take this information and\nupdate.\n\n231\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.750\nThis is why nmap is so great.\n\n232\n00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:31.350\nThey'll update their information and say\nokay, well, we can start to see a pattern,\n\n233\n00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.390\nand if enough information\ngets sent to them, they can\n\n234\n00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:39.179\nrefine their guessing procedures and maybe\nget it a little more accurate, all right?\n\n235\n00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.060\nSo it says it's guessing that it's 2012,\nWindows Server 2012, 2012 R2.\n\n236\n00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:50.050\nAggressive guessing, it's saying\nit's 85% chance that it's 2012 R2.\n\n237\n00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.020\nWhat else, no exact OS matches for\nthe host, all right.\n\n238\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.190\nSo we think it's a server.\n\n239\n00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.550\nWe got a couple indications there.\n\n240\n00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.920\nA lot more ports are open.\n\n241\n00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.230\nThat's a really good\nindicator that it's a server,\n\n242\n00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.850\nthat it's providing some kind\nof services to the network.\n\n243\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:09.020\nSo you see more ports are open,\nplus the OS guest that I tried there.\n\n244\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.350\nLet's try throwing in a v with that.\n\n245\n00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.645\nLet's do a -vO and see what happens.\n\n246\n00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:20.100\nIt didn't like that with the,\n\n247\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.770\nlet's do a -v-O.\n\n248\n00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.470\nSometimes you can start combining\nswitches, sometimes you can't.\n\n249\n00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:33.240\nJust play around with it, like that\ndidn't like a -vo in the same block.\n\n250\n00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.200\nBut look how much more\ninformation is coming up.\n\n251\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.040\nIn the end, a lot of the same information,\nbut a little more detailed information,\n\n252\n00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.160\nthat's what that -v gave me.\n\n253\n00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.360\nDidn't change anything on my OS results.\n\n254\n00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.980\nDidn't really change anything\non my results at all.\n\n255\n00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.700\nBut I can see the steps that it was going\nthrough, right, as it started that.\n\n256\n00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.021\nYou'll notice it's just doing\nwhat's called a sin self-scan,\n\n257\n00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:01.886\nthat's the dash s s, little s, capital S.\n\n258\n00:14:01.886 --> 00:14:05.240\nKeep in mind,\nthose are definitely not stealthy.\n\n259\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.740\nI know they're called stealthy but\nthat was back in the day, they're not so\n\n260\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.550\nstealthy any more.\n\n261\n00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.870\nDo watch that.\n\n262\n00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.150\n&gt;&gt; They're stealthier than\na full connection scan,\n\n263\n00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.500\nwhich is what they mean by that.\n\n264\n00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz basically you're doing\nthe first part of the TCP handshake here.\n\n265\n00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.920\nDuring the SYN,\nthey're sending back the SYN/ACK, but\n\n266\n00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.230\nyou're never responding with an ACK,\nand you're moving on the next one.\n\n267\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.290\nSo it's a little bit stealthier,\none less packet per port.\n\n268\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.720\nBut it's still detectable.\n\n269\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.205\nAnd a lot of people that are new\nto this think, ooh, stealth scan.\n\n270\n00:14:36.205 --> 00:14:37.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can fire that off and\n\n271\n00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.796\nnobody will even know I'm here.\n\n272\n00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Of course [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n273\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:42.880\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n274\n00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.630\nAll right.\nWhat else do they want us to do here?\n\n275\n00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.210\nWe got the dash V.\n\n276\n00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.880\nI've showed you the manual.\n\n277\n00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.110\nI do want to show you one more Nmap-A,\n10.0.100.200.\n\n278\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.980\nLet's do that one.\n\n279\n00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.770\nThis is one.\n\n280\n00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.010\nA capital A actually ends up\ncombining a couple of things.\n\n281\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.490\nIt does OS detection.\n\n282\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:05.070\nIt also does trace route,\nand it runs a script.\n\n283\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.780\nAnd let's just see for\nthe OS detection and versioning.\n\n284\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.470\nIt gives me version information as well.\n\n285\n00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.150\nVersion is another good one.\n\n286\n00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.180\nThe capital V on your scans.\n\n287\n00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.750\nThe little v is verbose.\n\n288\n00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.820\nCapital V is version information.\n\n289\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.282\nSo not only it will tell you, hey,\nthis is port 80, and it's Apache.\n\n290\n00:15:22.282 --> 00:15:26.958\nIt will say port 80,\nApache, version 4.7, right.\n\n291\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.300\nAnd that's information as a bad\nguy that's very very useful.\n\n292\n00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.415\n&gt;&gt; That's news I can use.\n\n293\n00:15:32.415 --> 00:15:33.165\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n294\n00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:35.345\nI know that in version five,\n\n295\n00:15:35.345 --> 00:15:39.620\nthey patched against this vulnerability.\nBut 4.7 is still vulnerable to it, and\n\n296\n00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.130\nnow I know I can launch that against you,\nright?\n\n297\n00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.112\nSo getting that detailed\nversion of information.\n\n298\n00:15:44.112 --> 00:15:47.111\nThis scan obviously takes\na little longer as you can see,\n\n299\n00:15:47.111 --> 00:15:50.110\nbecause it's doing a little\ndeeper inspection.\n\n300\n00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.480\nI also didn't limit what ports it was\ndoing which I probably should have.\n\n301\n00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.090\n&gt;&gt; Well it it it defaults\nto the top one thousand\n\n302\n00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n303\n00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.440\n&gt;&gt; It's a couple.\n\n304\n00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:57.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n305\n00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.000\nSo we'll let that run.\n\n306\n00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.346\nAgain, know some of those switches,\nsome of those basic switches.\n\n307\n00:16:03.346 --> 00:16:05.642\nGet out there and play with it.\n\n308\n00:16:05.642 --> 00:16:07.083\nWanna throw in a disclaimer here though.\n\n309\n00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:09.112\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's do a little disclaimer while\n\n310\n00:16:09.112 --> 00:16:10.188\nwe're waiting for his.\n\n311\n00:16:10.188 --> 00:16:11.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's do our legal mumbo jumbo.\n\n312\n00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.\n\n313\n00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.440\nWe are not responsible for\nany damages that occur, liabilities.\n\n314\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.580\n[NOISE] You'll have to slow that down,\n\n315\n00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.690\nand you'll see that I read\nthree paragraphs of disclaimer.\n\n316\n00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:25.482\nNow, and all kidding aside, I wanna make\nsure we understand that these tools,\n\n317\n00:16:25.482 --> 00:16:30.058\nyou can end up violating your acceptable\nuse policies with tools like this,\n\n318\n00:16:30.058 --> 00:16:32.348\nespecially on your company network,\n\n319\n00:16:32.348 --> 00:16:37.159\npotentially even on your home network if\nyou go beyond the borders of your home.\n\n320\n00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:41.268\nSo, I wanna make sure you understand\nthat using tools like this, like Nmap,\n\n321\n00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:44.367\nlike Wireshark which we're\ngoing to use here in a minute,\n\n322\n00:16:44.367 --> 00:16:48.502\nyou want to make that you have permission,\nand that you're allowed to do it.\n\n323\n00:16:48.502 --> 00:16:51.942\nBecause this is pulling back,\nnot secret, but\n\n324\n00:16:51.942 --> 00:16:56.290\npotentially secret information\nabout these servers.\n\n325\n00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.760\nAnd I probably don't have the right\nto do that on my network.\n\n326\n00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.720\nI definitely can't just go out and\nstart scanning.\n\n327\n00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.891\nCox Communication is whom my ISP\nhere is in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n328\n00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:11.110\nAnd if I start running scanners against\npublic IPs, they're gonna see that traffic\n\n329\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:15.700\noriginating from me, and they're gonna\nend up sending me a cease and desist, or\n\n330\n00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.540\na little nastygram that says, look,\nwe don't allow that on our network.\n\n331\n00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.550\nIt's not technically illegal to\nscan a public facing system.\n\n332\n00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.190\nIt's grey, it really depends on\nwhere you live, what's your station,\n\n333\n00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:35.150\njurisdiction, what the courts\nare feeling like that day.\n\n334\n00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.840\nAll this is new.\n\n335\n00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.470\nIt's all being fleshed\nout in the court systems.\n\n336\n00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:43.360\nI used to liken it to going along a strip\nmall, or an apartment complex, and\n\n337\n00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.720\ntugging on everybody's front door.\n\n338\n00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.070\nPolice officer comes up and\nsays, hey, what are you doing?\n\n339\n00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.060\nI'm just making sure everybody\nlocked their doors, right?\n\n340\n00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:53.620\nThere's nothing illegal about that,\nI didn't enter anything.\n\n341\n00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.950\nAnd so,\nthey can't really prosecute me for that.\n\n342\n00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.820\nThat's not illegal,\njust like port scanning is not illegal.\n\n343\n00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.640\nYou're just looking at the ports,\nseeing which ones are open, and\n\n344\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.840\nseeing which ones are closed.\n\n345\n00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.590\nBut let's say that I did find that\none of those apartments was open.\n\n346\n00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.150\nWhat would I have done?\n\n347\n00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.260\nI probably would gone in, the reason I was\npulling it on was not for their safety.\n\n348\n00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.170\nIt was for me to go in and steal stuff.\n\n349\n00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.930\nThe police officers aren't silly, but\nthey can't prosecute on intent, all right?\n\n350\n00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.420\nIt's the same thing with port scanning.\n\n351\n00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.423\nIt's not really illegal to do that port\nscanning, but it's usually the precursor\n\n352\n00:18:25.423 --> 00:18:28.451\nto an attack, but it's usually\nthe precursor to an attack, so\n\n353\n00:18:28.451 --> 00:18:31.210\nI can't really prosecute you for that yet.\n\n354\n00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.810\nBut I sure as heck can say that there's a\ngood chance you were going to do something\n\n355\n00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.320\nwith those open ports that you found.\n\n356\n00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.520\n&gt;&gt; Right, they would have to\nprove the intention was evil,\n\n357\n00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.520\nwhich I've heard of happening,\nbecause if you have a port scan,\n\n358\n00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.810\nyou can say, yeah, I was just port\nscanning looking at open ports.\n\n359\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.930\nBut you've also done,\n\n360\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.800\nthrown exploit attack code at\nsome of their other servers.\n\n361\n00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.200\nWell now, yeah.\n\n362\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.565\nWe only caught you port scanning, and we\nsee this attack vector coming from your IP\n\n363\n00:18:58.565 --> 00:19:02.434\nrange, well, two and two make four\nwhere I went to school, little boy.\n\n364\n00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:03.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n365\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.360\nnow we have your incent of your trying\nto do something which is illegal.\n\n366\n00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.650\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n367\n00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.420\nPeople don't like their, just like you\nwouldn't like it if someone came up to\n\n368\n00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.790\nyour door and tried to jimmy on it,\nand see if they could open on it.\n\n369\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.740\nMost people don't like their\nservers being jimmied on\n\n370\n00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.180\nto see if people can get into it,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n371\n00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.950\nOnly work on computers that you have\nexpressed written permission to do so.\n\n372\n00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:24.770\nEither you own them,\n\n373\n00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:29.230\nor you've been given permission by the\nperson that does to actually scan them.\n\n374\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.370\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly right.\n\n375\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.550\nYou can't be too careful, right?\n\n376\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.202\nYou have to be ethical.\n\n377\n00:19:33.202 --> 00:19:36.060\nAll right, now, let's take a look at\nthe results that we have got back.\n\n378\n00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.210\nAnd I'll scroll back up and\nfind my command.\n\n379\n00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.070\nHere's where I did the dash capital A.\n\n380\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.700\nAnd at first, the results look similar,\nbut look here,\n\n381\n00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.690\nlook at the version information\nthat's dumped out here.\n\n382\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.240\nBefore I had this 422 ssh,\n\n383\n00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.710\nnow I know it's running open ssh\nversion 7.1 using protocol 2.\n\n384\n00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:01.760\nRight, I can see things,\nhere you go, Server 2012.\n\n385\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.621\nOur two standard evaluation for\nthat port 445.\n\n386\n00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:07.963\nI can see active directory here, so\n\n387\n00:20:07.963 --> 00:20:12.413\nyou see a lot more information coming\nback using that capital A, and\n\n388\n00:20:12.413 --> 00:20:16.910\nif we get down to the OS guessing,\nit's still kinda the same.\n\n389\n00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.930\nI will tell you that I have done capital\nOs against servers, and it comes back and\n\n390\n00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:24.890\nsays look, this could be Windows Server\n2012, It could be 2012 R2,\n\n391\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.668\nit could be Windows 10,\nit could be Windows 8.1.\n\n392\n00:20:27.668 --> 00:20:28.799\n&gt;&gt; Could be the Sit Phone.\n\n393\n00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:32.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It could be Darth Vader, I don't know.\n\n394\n00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.868\nBut this is our guess.\n\n395\n00:20:33.868 --> 00:20:38.580\nRun an a, capital A against the same\nmachine, and because of the fact that it's\n\n396\n00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:43.570\ndoing some banner grabbing on the ports,\nand it reads the SMB port information and\n\n397\n00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.410\nsays wait a second,\nthis is Windows Server 2016.\n\n398\n00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.142\nRelease number 14942 build,\nblah blah blah.\n\n399\n00:20:51.142 --> 00:20:54.760\nIt actually gets extremely specific and\nvery accurate.\n\n400\n00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.270\nSo, you want to try out these switches and\njust understand what are you trying to do?\n\n401\n00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.940\nI might do an O, because it's\nactually an O, because it's quick.\n\n402\n00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.000\nSo once I get a list of live hosts,\nI throw a -O and\n\n403\n00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.850\nrun a scan against those live hosts and\nget OSs back.\n\n404\n00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.180\nOnce I do that,\nif there's one that looks interesting,\n\n405\n00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:16.590\nthere's a lot of cool ports open, maybe I\ndo a -A again, just that one IP address.\n\n406\n00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:20.140\nBecause it does take so much longer,\nnow I've narrowed it down even more.\n\n407\n00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.560\nAnd I gave more detailed\nspecific the information.\n\n408\n00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.960\nAll right, and let's see.\n\n409\n00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.890\nIf I go down,\nhere's the script that it's doing.\n\n410\n00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:34.410\nSMBUS discovery,\nthere you can see evaluation 9600.\n\n411\n00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.900\nLot of great information, system time.\n\n412\n00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.920\nNow look, there's my FQDN.\n\n413\n00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.460\nSupport system version two,\nthere's my trace route to it.\n\n414\n00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.030\nThat's a lot of good info.\n\n415\n00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.490\nAll right, and\nI have killed our clock again.\n\n416\n00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:51.636\nWe haven't even got to Wireshark yet.\n\n417\n00:21:51.636 --> 00:21:55.206\nMight as well go ahead and\nget some Wireshark installed, and\n\n418\n00:21:55.206 --> 00:21:58.228\nthen we'll come back and\nmaybe look at wire shark.\n\n419\n00:21:58.228 --> 00:22:02.990\nSo let me get out of here, and\nlet me jump over to my windows box.\n\n420\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.630\nAll right, now, on Windows,\nyou can install Nmap as well.\n\n421\n00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.050\nIn fact, I will tell you guys,\nthis is my physical machine here,\n\n422\n00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.250\nthis one with the ITPro.TV background.\n\n423\n00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.170\nAnd you might notice a couple things.\n\n424\n00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.400\nOne, that little blue fin right there,\nthat's Wireshark, right?\n\n425\n00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:26.750\nIf I open up a command prompt,\ntype Nmap, there's all my instructions.\n\n426\n00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.390\nThese are tools that I have\ninstalled on my every day machine,\n\n427\n00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.300\nnot just the virtual machines for\nthis lab.\n\n428\n00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.870\nThese are tools that you will use\na lot as a security professional.\n\n429\n00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.450\nAll right, so anyway,\nback over to my Windows 10 box.\n\n430\n00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.820\nLet's get Wireshark installed.\n\n431\n00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:48.840\nWireshark is a packet analyzer,\nprotocol analyzer, different names for it.\n\n432\n00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.090\nIt does a lot, but basically,\nit's a packet capture utility, or\n\n433\n00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.610\na packet sniffer, yes.\n\n434\n00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:59.780\nPacket capture, sniffer, network sniffer,\nall kind of different names.\n\n435\n00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.180\nIt gives you the ability\nto capture raw packet\n\n436\n00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.716\ndata that's traveling across the network,\nand then analyze that information.\n\n437\n00:23:07.716 --> 00:23:11.160\nLook at the packets, look at the\nprotocols, look at the pay loads of those\n\n438\n00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:16.650\npackets if it's not encrypted you can\nread it right out of Wiresharks results.\n\n439\n00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.360\nAnd this is not the only one,\nit's not the only game in town.\n\n440\n00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.910\nLet me get it started, and\nthen we'll talk about it.\n\n441\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.189\nDownload it from Wireshark,\ngo ahead and Google Wireshark.\n\n442\n00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:31.120\nUsed to be called ethereal, so\nif you're familiar with ethereal,\n\n443\n00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.970\nsorry, I can't talk and\nclick at the same time.\n\n444\n00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.330\nLet me remember where I put that,\nthere we go.\n\n445\n00:23:41.886 --> 00:23:48.640\nSomewhere in here,\nI have Wireshark, there we go.\n\n446\n00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.960\nAnd we'll go ahead and get this guy fired\nup, and then I'll go back to talking.\n\n447\n00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.431\nI'll click Next on the wizard,\nand I agree to the EULA.\n\n448\n00:23:57.431 --> 00:24:00.717\nI'll leave everything checked there,\n\n449\n00:24:00.717 --> 00:24:05.268\nnothing to change here,\nwe're just keep on trucking.\n\n450\n00:24:05.268 --> 00:24:05.954\nAnd we'll click next.\n\n451\n00:24:05.954 --> 00:24:08.480\nThis I wanna show you, all right?\n\n452\n00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:14.190\nAs you're installing Wireshark,\nit prompts me to install WinPcap.\n\n453\n00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:19.440\nWinPcap is a library that allows\nWindows to work with raw packet data.\n\n454\n00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.285\nMicrosoft left that out intentionally.\n\n455\n00:24:21.285 --> 00:24:24.796\nThey didn't think end users really need,\nor have a desire to work with,\n\n456\n00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:26.190\nend packets, raw packets.\n\n457\n00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.300\nThis is going to give us that\ncapability back in Windows, so\n\n458\n00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.730\ndefinitely install it if you\ndon't have it installed already.\n\n459\n00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:37.650\nLet it install WinPcap,\nwhatever the latest version is.\n\n460\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.950\nIt's also got a beta now for USBPcap.\n\n461\n00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:44.250\nMore and more stuff going across\nUSB ports, especially with USBC or\n\n462\n00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:44.794\nThunderbolt.\n\n463\n00:24:44.794 --> 00:24:49.320\nI'm gonna need to start\nmonitoring that for data, for\n\n464\n00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.260\ninfiltration and things like that\nas Wireshark is ahead of the game.\n\n465\n00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:58.950\nAnyway, there's other packet\ncapture utilities you can use.\n\n466\n00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:03.881\nTcpdump is one I can use from\nthe command line, a very popular one.\n\n467\n00:25:03.881 --> 00:25:06.160\nWhat's another one?\nNetwork Monitor, which is now what,\n\n468\n00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.370\nMessage Analyzer, I think from Microsoft?\n\n469\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.833\nThey changed the name up on that one.\n\n470\n00:25:11.833 --> 00:25:14.101\nIt's not included, I don't think,\nwith the operating system, but\n\n471\n00:25:14.101 --> 00:25:15.312\nyou can download it from Microsoft.\n\n472\n00:25:15.312 --> 00:25:18.906\nLet me go ahead and\nlet it install WinPcap.\n\n473\n00:25:18.906 --> 00:25:24.324\nAnd notice that I let WinPcap\nlaunch automatically at start-up?\n\n474\n00:25:24.324 --> 00:25:27.677\nThat way when I fire up Wireshark, I don't\nhave to worry about whether WinPcap is\n\n475\n00:25:27.677 --> 00:25:30.770\navailable or not, and\nthis will continue the installation.\n\n476\n00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:34.078\nSo what it allows me to do is\ncapture packets off of the network.\n\n477\n00:25:34.078 --> 00:25:37.970\nSomething we gotta keep in mind,\nagain, the disclaimer.\n\n478\n00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.660\nDo not run this in your Enterprise\nenvironment unless you have permissions\n\n479\n00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.550\nto do so,\nbecause this does capture raw packets and\n\n480\n00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.370\nyou will see data in those packets.\n\n481\n00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.830\nIf it's not encrypted,\nyou can read emails,\n\n482\n00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.240\nyou can read documents that\nare being transferred.\n\n483\n00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.570\nYou can see passwords if\nthey're not encrypted.\n\n484\n00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.990\nSo in other words, you can access\ninformation that you shouldn't have access\n\n485\n00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.210\nto, that your pay grade\ndoesn't give you access too.\n\n486\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.360\nJust because the CEO is emailing a\nmanager, you're sitting in the middle and\n\n487\n00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.420\nyou capture the information, and\nyou can see that payroll sheet, all right?\n\n488\n00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.130\nAnd you can get in a lot of trouble for\nthat.\n\n489\n00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:13.479\nSo do not install this at work\nunless you have permission to do so,\n\n490\n00:26:13.479 --> 00:26:15.308\ndo it on your home network.\n\n491\n00:26:15.308 --> 00:26:18.520\nAnother thing to keep in mind with\npacket capture utilities like this,\n\n492\n00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.210\nthe majority of networks\nnowadays are switched ethernet.\n\n493\n00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:25.774\nSo what that means is you have\na point-to-point connection between your\n\n494\n00:26:25.774 --> 00:26:27.109\nnode and the switch.\n\n495\n00:26:27.109 --> 00:26:30.538\nThe only traffic that's coming out\nthat wire and down to your node,\n\n496\n00:26:30.538 --> 00:26:34.280\nis traffic that's destined for\nyour node or broadcast traffic, right?\n\n497\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.528\nSo that's all you're gonna see.\n\n498\n00:26:35.528 --> 00:26:36.750\nYou run packet capture,\n\n499\n00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.340\nyou're not gonna see anything else\nunless you happen to be behind a hub.\n\n500\n00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.477\nOr you've got a,\n\n501\n00:26:42.477 --> 00:26:47.117\na lot of times what we do is we do what's\ncalled port mirroring on the switch,\n\n502\n00:26:47.117 --> 00:26:51.779\nwhere all traffic gets put out the\nappropriate port, plus the port mirror.\n\n503\n00:26:51.779 --> 00:26:54.819\nAnd that's where I can monitor\nall the traffic from and\n\n504\n00:26:54.819 --> 00:26:57.671\nsee what the other people\non the network are doing.\n\n505\n00:26:57.671 --> 00:27:02.510\nAll right, I'll click Next on my wizard\nhere, and I'll go ahead and click Finish.\n\n506\n00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:07.181\nAnd we now have Wireshark installed,\nbut we are out of time.\n\n507\n00:27:07.181 --> 00:27:09.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I got another cliffhanger for you.\n\n508\n00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.191\nWe'll just leave it right\nthere ,and we'll come back and\n\n509\n00:27:12.191 --> 00:27:14.750\nwe'll take a look at how to run\nWireshark and how we can use it.\n\n510\n00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.470\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\nyou are the king of the cliffhanger, man.\n\n511\n00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.413\nReally leave us wanting, salivating over,\nI wanna see Wireshark run.\n\n512\n00:27:20.413 --> 00:27:24.075\nI wanna see data get captured from\nacross the network, maybe a password,\n\n513\n00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:24.969\nsomething cool.\n\n514\n00:27:24.969 --> 00:27:27.926\nBut yeah, if you want to see that,\nyou'll definitely have to come back for,\n\n515\n00:27:27.926 --> 00:27:29.300\nwhat are we on, part four now?\n\n516\n00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:29.900\n&gt;&gt; I believe so.\n\n517\n00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.020\n&gt;&gt; The mini-series continues.\n\n518\n00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully we will see you there.\n\n519\n00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.980\nAs for this episode,\nit does look like we are out of time.\n\n520\n00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.260\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\n\n521\n00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.350\nITProTV, I've been your\nhost Daniel Lowrie.\n\n522\n00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.190\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n523\n00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.782\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n524\n00:27:41.782 -->

00:00:12.183\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:14.073\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.073 --> 00:00:16.385\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:19.822\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on with\n\n7\n00:00:19.822 --> 00:00:23.362\nmore in our CyberSec First Responders\nseries, and joining us again, of course,\n\n8\n00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:24.336\nour good friend, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:27.244\nMike Rodrick, Michael, welcome back,\nhow are you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:27.244 --> 00:00:30.721\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, thanks for\nhaving me back once again.\n\n11\n00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:35.354\nAnd yeah, in this episode, we're going to\ncontinue on with tools and techniques, and\n\n12\n00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:38.355\nwhat I wanna do here is take\na look at a protocol analyzer,\n\n13\n00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:41.761\nor a packet capture utility,\nI mean, they go by several names.\n\n14\n00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:46.641\nThere really are different functions when\nyou talk about a protocol analyzer versus\n\n15\n00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:50.774\na packet capture utility, or\na network sniffer, a network capturer.\n\n16\n00:00:50.774 --> 00:00:55.031\nBut Wireshark, the one I'm gonna demo for\nyou, does a lot of that,\n\n17\n00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:59.813\nit allows me to work with the raw packets,\nit is a packet capture utility, or\n\n18\n00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:04.852\na network monitor utility, or a network\nsniffer, whatever you wanna call it.\n\n19\n00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:08.903\nYou can also do some protocol analysis\nwith it, because it's gonna show me\n\n20\n00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:12.843\nthe raw packets and I can see what\nprotocols are being used on my network.\n\n21\n00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:16.538\nMaybe I spot something that maybe\nshouldn't be there, or like,\n\n22\n00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:20.163\nI know here for example,\nwhen I was running this the other day and\n\n23\n00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:24.259\nI found a stranger protocol,\none I hadn't seen a lot of, PTPV2, which\n\n24\n00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.053\nis precision time protocol, turns out to\nbe version two, and it was just flooding.\n\n25\n00:01:29.053 --> 00:01:31.983\nThere was all kinds of traffic\non my network, come to find out,\n\n26\n00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:35.799\nit's our phones, or our Cisco phones,\nI forget who makes our phones, Polycom,\n\n27\n00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.875\nI think, is who makes them.\n\n28\n00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:41.841\nThey were using that to synchronize their\ntimes and things like that, so, yeah,\n\n29\n00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:45.289\nit's interesting what you can see\nwhen you start capturing packets and\n\n30\n00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.278\nlooking out there on the network and\nseeing what's going on,\n\n31\n00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:51.464\nit's a very important part of our\nskill set as first responders.\n\n32\n00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:54.795\nBeing in and understanding security,\nwe have to monitor our network,\n\n33\n00:01:54.795 --> 00:01:57.404\nwe need to know what should and\nshouldn't be there, and\n\n34\n00:01:57.404 --> 00:02:00.955\nthe only way to do that is to monitor it,\nto look and see what's going on, and\n\n35\n00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:04.253\nthat way when something is out of place,\nyou're gonna recognize it.\n\n36\n00:02:04.253 --> 00:02:08.945\nAnd getting familiar with the tools before\nyou need them is always a good thing, so\n\n37\n00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:10.856\nlet's take a look at Wireshark.\n\n38\n00:02:10.856 --> 00:02:15.662\nIf we take a look at my screen here, I've\ngot my Windows 10 device opened up, and\n\n39\n00:02:15.662 --> 00:02:20.193\nI'm gonna go ahead and fire up Wireshark\nand the first thing I want to do is open\n\n40\n00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:24.680\nup a saved capture, as soon as Wireshark\ndecides to play along with me here.\n\n41\n00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.383\nAnd what that means is,\nwhen you do a packet capture,\n\n42\n00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:31.649\nyou're gonna see the information real time\non your screen with a utility like this,\n\n43\n00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.218\nbut I can save that information,\nand I should save that information.\n\n44\n00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:38.325\nThat way, we can go back at\nour leisure and analyze and\n\n45\n00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:43.091\ngo through the packets as we see fit, or\nsomebody calls me up, I could say, yeah,\n\n46\n00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:47.954\nI've got a packet capture from that day,\nlet's go take a look at what was going on.\n\n47\n00:02:47.954 --> 00:02:52.205\nSo I'm gonna open it up,\nsimply File, Open, and\n\n48\n00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:56.865\nI'll browse, and\nthere is my reconisance.pcap, or\n\n49\n00:02:56.865 --> 00:03:02.056\nit's a .pcapng is the file,\nand that's pretty standard.\n\n50\n00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:06.186\nOne of the cool things about Wireshark,\nand most of our packet captures,\n\n51\n00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.114\nis I can use like TCPDump to create\nthe capture, because it's quick,\n\n52\n00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:14.107\nit's command line, I can script it,\nI can have a little batch file that\n\n53\n00:03:14.107 --> 00:03:18.900\nI run to fire this thing off and capture\n1,000 packets and then stop the capture so\n\n54\n00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.928\nI can start automating that and\nrun it periodically.\n\n55\n00:03:21.928 --> 00:03:27.197\nBut analyzing with TCPDump is not fun\nbecause it's in that command prompt.\n\n56\n00:03:27.197 --> 00:03:31.498\nI can open that file up with Wireshark and\nnow I can do my filters with a graphical\n\n57\n00:03:31.498 --> 00:03:35.931\nuser interface, so much powerful when it\ncomes to being able to filter traffic,\n\n58\n00:03:35.931 --> 00:03:40.328\nlook at conversations, for example,\nfollow streams, those kind of things.\n\n59\n00:03:40.328 --> 00:03:41.091\nSo lets-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n60\n00:03:41.091 --> 00:03:44.763\nit's definitely more easily looked at\nquickly, and say, I see what that is,\n\n61\n00:03:44.763 --> 00:03:47.857\nI see what that is, looking at TCPDump\noutput can just look like a bunch\n\n62\n00:03:47.857 --> 00:03:50.493\nof white text on a black background,\nto be honest with you.\n\n63\n00:03:50.493 --> 00:03:52.867\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It really does all start to\n\n64\n00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:57.399\nblur together, here, I've got color\ncoding, and highlighting, and it,\n\n65\n00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:02.138\nI almost want to say deciphers, but it\nconverts my hex for me, things like that,\n\n66\n00:04:02.138 --> 00:04:04.189\nmakes it a lot easier to work with.\n\n67\n00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.139\nSo I'll go ahead and open this guy up and\nI'll click open, and it should open\n\n68\n00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.588\nup that capture, and so here's an example\ncapture that logic operations created for\n\n69\n00:04:12.588 --> 00:04:15.613\nus, and I can see open there's\nthree panes in Wireshark,\n\n70\n00:04:15.613 --> 00:04:19.174\nthere's a lot of pain in Wireshark now,\nkidding, that was a joke.\n\n71\n00:04:19.174 --> 00:04:22.364\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's three different panes,\n\n72\n00:04:22.364 --> 00:04:25.143\nI've got my top pane,\nwhich is where I see the actual packets.\n\n73\n00:04:25.143 --> 00:04:29.363\nSo, up here, each one of these is\na packet that my sniffer has captured and\n\n74\n00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:32.154\nyou can see I can highlight them,\nclick on them,\n\n75\n00:04:32.154 --> 00:04:36.240\nand if you are watching these panes below,\nthis middle pane is an actual\n\n76\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.087\nbreakdown of the packet,\nwhere I can go in and say, you know what?\n\n77\n00:04:40.087 --> 00:04:44.172\nI want to look at this packet, and\nI can see that it's a TCP packet.\n\n78\n00:04:44.172 --> 00:04:48.993\nLet's see what information is in\nthat TCP header, and there it is.\n\n79\n00:04:48.993 --> 00:04:52.821\nI can see source port, destination port,\nnow look at that destination port,\n\n80\n00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:54.220\nwhat were they doing there?\n\n81\n00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.767\n443, what's that for, do we remember?\n\n82\n00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:56.791\n&gt;&gt; That's SSL.\n\n83\n00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:59.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nsomebody was making a secure connection or\n\n84\n00:04:59.915 --> 00:05:04.183\nthey were attempting to make a secure\nconnection to the other end here.\n\n85\n00:05:04.183 --> 00:05:06.668\nWhat else?\nSo, I could look at the flags in here.\n\n86\n00:05:06.668 --> 00:05:11.041\nWe talked about the TCP3 way\nhandshake where there's a SIN and\n\n87\n00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:14.273\nthen a SIN ac sent back\nas a response to the SIN.\n\n88\n00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:17.301\nAnd then, a final acknowledgement, so\n\n89\n00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:22.028\nSIN, SIN ac, ac, the three way,\nor the TCP3 way handshake.\n\n90\n00:05:22.028 --> 00:05:25.969\nSo, here, I can see that the flag,\nthe syn flag, is actually raised, so\n\n91\n00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.396\nit's turned on,\nyou can see that one there.\n\n92\n00:05:28.396 --> 00:05:31.052\nThere's all the other flags.\n\n93\n00:05:31.052 --> 00:05:34.348\n&gt;&gt; Urge, push, and all the other good\nones, there's a lot of good stuff.\n\n94\n00:05:34.348 --> 00:05:35.267\nIf you mess around,\n\n95\n00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:38.359\nthis really comes in handy when\nyou're messing with nmap, right?\n\n96\n00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:42.964\nAnd if you're playing around with nmap,\nand you're looking at the output through\n\n97\n00:05:42.964 --> 00:05:46.448\nWireshark as the attack or scan,\nshould I say, is happening,\n\n98\n00:05:46.448 --> 00:05:50.812\nyou'll get a lot of cool information in\nthat Xmas tree scan that is available.\n\n99\n00:05:50.812 --> 00:05:53.655\nOr using maybe a custom flag scan,\nyou can look in here and\n\n100\n00:05:53.655 --> 00:05:56.617\nmake sure that that scan is\nactually is what is happening and\n\n101\n00:05:56.617 --> 00:06:00.129\nlook at the results from the machine\nthat you're actually scanning.\n\n102\n00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:04.289\nIt's very cool stuff to get in here and\nsee it at that base level.\n\n103\n00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.119\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, Daniel, I can't stress\nenough, if you want to get into security,\n\n104\n00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:14.089\nreally just even networking in general,\nbut especially security, you need to work\n\n105\n00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:18.305\nwith a packet capture utility,\nfigure out which one you like the best.\n\n106\n00:06:18.305 --> 00:06:21.901\nWireshark is my preferred,\nit's free, easily available,\n\n107\n00:06:21.901 --> 00:06:26.599\nwherever I'm at I can always download it\nagain, because you want to get familiar\n\n108\n00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:30.886\nwith your particular programs,\ninterface, filtering capabilities,\n\n109\n00:06:30.886 --> 00:06:35.265\nwhere everything is, but yes,\nget out there and capture some trade data.\n\n110\n00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:40.000\nAgain, do this on your home network where\nyou're not going to get in trouble or\n\n111\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.018\nhave permission from your enterprise,\nor have a test lab set up and\n\n112\n00:06:44.018 --> 00:06:48.971\nsome virtual machines that you can use to\ncapture data because all those things you\n\n113\n00:06:48.971 --> 00:06:51.521\ntalk about in theory, you get to see now.\n\n114\n00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:55.853\nMost of you have been through server\nclasses or even network plus, where we\n\n115\n00:06:55.853 --> 00:07:01.036\ntalk about DHCP and the DORA process,\nDiscover, Offer, Request, Acknowledgement.\n\n116\n00:07:01.036 --> 00:07:04.847\nIf you run one of these and then do\na release renew on a client on you network\n\n117\n00:07:04.847 --> 00:07:09.225\nor whatever, you're gonna actually capture\nthose packets, and you will see DHCP\n\n118\n00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:13.757\noffer, here's the IP address that it's\noffering the client, here's my request.\n\n119\n00:07:13.757 --> 00:07:17.940\n&gt;&gt; Mike, this was one of the most\nasked questions back when I was\n\n120\n00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.207\ndoing instructural ed training,\nis okay I see what it does but\n\n121\n00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:24.439\nwhen or why would I ever do this?\n\n122\n00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:27.585\nWell it comes down to the fact,\nis something not working?\n\n123\n00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:30.476\nAnd okay, DHCP is a prime example, right?\n\n124\n00:07:30.476 --> 00:07:35.345\nIt's doing that DORA process, if I'm not\ngetting DHCP addresses to my network,\n\n125\n00:07:35.345 --> 00:07:36.769\nwhy is that happening?\n\n126\n00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:40.218\nMy server's up, I can ping it,\nmy computers are up, I can't ping them\n\n127\n00:07:40.218 --> 00:07:44.204\nbecause they don't have addresses yet,\nbut they're alive, what's going on?\n\n128\n00:07:44.204 --> 00:07:47.754\nWell, fire up that packet capture software\nand look at that DORA process and\n\n129\n00:07:47.754 --> 00:07:50.476\nsee if it's breaking down anywhere and\nyou'll find out.\n\n130\n00:07:50.476 --> 00:07:51.383\n&gt;&gt; If something's going on.\n\n131\n00:07:51.383 --> 00:07:51.959\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n132\n00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:53.228\n&gt;&gt; And no offers coming back.\n\n133\n00:07:53.228 --> 00:07:54.444\n&gt;&gt; Right, now I know-\n&gt;&gt; For example.\n\n134\n00:07:54.444 --> 00:07:57.864\n&gt;&gt; That there's a chink in the, maybe\nI need to reboot that DHCP server and\n\n135\n00:07:57.864 --> 00:07:59.235\nnow those offers will come.\n\n136\n00:07:59.235 --> 00:08:00.196\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n137\n00:08:00.196 --> 00:08:01.295\n&gt;&gt; This is how the stuff works.\n\n138\n00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:05.548\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah DNS queries, you can see\nyour client talking to the DNS server and\n\n139\n00:08:05.548 --> 00:08:07.130\nthe answer that comes back.\n\n140\n00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.283\nI mean this is where you actually see all\nthat stuff that you've been learning about\n\n141\n00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:12.890\nin dealing with networks.\n\n142\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.590\nAnd from the security side of things,\n\n143\n00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.310\nI have to be able to get in here and\nanalyze this.\n\n144\n00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.820\nWe have to look at these packets,\nlook at this traffic, and\n\n145\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.860\nlook at the data within the packets,\nright.\n\n146\n00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.790\nNow below,\nI didn't finish talking about these panes.\n\n147\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.400\nLet me bump this up just a wee bit more.\n\n148\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.500\nI'm gonna change the font and pull that\nup, so they can see how I did this,\n\n149\n00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.210\nif I can remember.\n\n150\n00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.010\nWe go to preferences under my edit menu,\nand\n\n151\n00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.620\nthen font, and\nlet's bump that up just a little bit.\n\n152\n00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.034\nLet's try 14.\n\n153\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.190\nMake that a little bit bigger, so it's\neasier to see out there on that screen.\n\n154\n00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.150\nSo we said the top pane is where\nthe packets are that you're capturing.\n\n155\n00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.240\nThe middle pane changes as you\nclick on the different packets to\n\n156\n00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.050\nshow you the fields within there.\n\n157\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.390\nAnd the bottom pane is\nthe raw packet itself.\n\n158\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.910\nThis hexadecimal information.\n\n159\n00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.460\nThis what's actually being sent.\n\n160\n00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.130\nThe rest of it's being translated for\n\n161\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.060\nus by wireshark to make it\na lot easier to work with.\n\n162\n00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.360\nYou got the hex content, and\nthen over here you have the deciphering.\n\n163\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.190\nIn fact, if we go back up to here, and\n\n164\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.860\nyou'll see that as you highlight\ndifferent things, right.\n\n165\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.250\nLike 54, there's a source port is 54.180.\n\n166\n00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.778\nBut notice that it highlighted\nthis D3 A4 down on the bottom.\n\n167\n00:09:24.778 --> 00:09:30.292\nWell if we took a minute to convert\nthat from hex to binary to decimal,\n\n168\n00:09:30.292 --> 00:09:32.490\nguess what it's gonna be?\n\n169\n00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.100\n54180, right?\nI mean that's the information,\n\n170\n00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.890\nthat's the raw data down\nthere at the bottom.\n\n171\n00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.438\nSo definitely, we've taken time in\nother classes, I know to talk about\n\n172\n00:09:41.438 --> 00:09:44.650\nto converting from hex to binary\nto decimal and things like that.\n\n173\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.760\nEverybody's like,\nhow I ever gonna use that.\n\n174\n00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.580\nOkay, now you know, right?\n\n175\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.420\nIf you don't have a utilities\ngonna do it for you or\n\n176\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.990\nif you need to verify information,\nthis is where you gonna go.\n\n177\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.240\nYou look at the source and\ndestination addresses.\n\n178\n00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.140\nThere they are but they're in hex down\nhere, so you have to convert those.\n\n179\n00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.462\nBut let's say we capture, and we'll do\nthis in a second, I'll try to do this.\n\n180\n00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:07.990\nWell capture a file that's being\ntransferred across the network.\n\n181\n00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.750\nIf there's plain text information in\nthere you'll see the hex over here.\n\n182\n00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.090\nBut then you'll see the actual\nplain text showing up right here.\n\n183\n00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.230\nIt'll convert the hex for you.\n\n184\n00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.840\nAnd you can read the email right\nout of the packet capture utility.\n\n185\n00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.700\nIf the password's in plain text,\nit will show up right here, bold and\n\n186\n00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.210\nready for everybody to see.\n\n187\n00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.750\nSo it's pretty fun playing\nwith utilities like this.\n\n188\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.310\nAll right, so let's keep going.\n\n189\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.870\nA couple things they want us to point out.\n\n190\n00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.530\nWe’ve found the source and destination\naddress, I’ll click on that first packet\n\n191\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.660\nand we know the IP protocol is what\ndoes the network address, right.\n\n192\n00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.790\nThat’s layer three, so\nif we expand out that IP frame header,\n\n193\n00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:51.560\nI can see there is my source and\nmy destination address for that pocket.\n\n194\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.010\nWe already looked at\nthe TCP portion of that and\n\n195\n00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.720\nwe can see the flag that was raised.\n\n196\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:02.190\nThis was a cin pocket or the cin flag\nwas raised in this particular pocket.\n\n197\n00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.960\nThe destination port,\nwe've talked about with 443 which\n\n198\n00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.070\nmeans it was trying most likely create\nsome kind of secure connection.\n\n199\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.160\nAll right,\nnow other things we can do with this,\n\n200\n00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.930\nlet's take a look at some statistics.\n\n201\n00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.250\nIn wire shock I can go to\nmy statistics menu and\n\n202\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.380\nI can take a look at conversations.\n\n203\n00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.850\nThis is a really cool part about working\nwith a program like this versus ATCP Dump,\n\n204\n00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.200\nbecause it could look at source and\ndestination,\n\n205\n00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.530\nand say, these belong to a conversation.\n\n206\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.130\nThink about it, I send data to the server,\nthe servers responded, I've sent data\n\n207\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.550\nback it's responded back, but there's\nother things going on in my network.\n\n208\n00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.060\nI'm not the only one here.\n\n209\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.250\nSo when you look at your\npacket capture here,\n\n210\n00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.140\nthese aren't necessarily\nin the appropriate order.\n\n211\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.050\nThe packets that are related to each\nother are not next to each other.\n\n212\n00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.960\nBecause while I'm conversing\nwith this server,\n\n213\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.910\nDaniel's over here conversing\nwith a different server or\n\n214\n00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.420\nsomebody else is pinging something,\nor connecting to the internet.\n\n215\n00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.570\nSo all that traffic's gonna show up.\n\n216\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.880\nAnd to be able to follow\nthat conversation,\n\n217\n00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.980\nwe can simply choose conversations.\n\n218\n00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.530\nAnd now from this, you can get a really\ninteresting perspective, as well.\n\n219\n00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:15.040\nI don't know if I can change\nthe font on this part, so\n\n220\n00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.830\nI apologize for that,\nit is really, really small.\n\n221\n00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.480\nI don't know if you're gonna\nbe able to see that app there.\n\n222\n00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.500\nBut what I'm seeing is the address A,\nfirst column is the address A,\n\n223\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.310\nport A, address B, port B,\nsource and destination basically.\n\n224\n00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.450\nNumber of packets in that conversation,\n\n225\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:36.660\nbytes, and some other information that\nwe're not gonna worry about for right now.\n\n226\n00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.700\nSo each one of these is\nactually a conversation.\n\n227\n00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.990\nBut if we look closely which I know\nwe can't do because it's too small,\n\n228\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.590\nso I will look closely for you.\n\n229\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.980\nThe column I'm really paying\nattention to is this packets column.\n\n230\n00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.850\nAnd you notice that these are really\nshort conversations, two packets,\n\n231\n00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.560\nsome of them three, some of them one.\n\n232\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.690\nThat in and\nof itself is interesting, all right.\n\n233\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.410\nCuz normally there's gonna be more data.\n\n234\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.200\nIf I'm downloading a file or\nconnecting to a file server\n\n235\n00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.510\nthere's gonna be a lot more packets going\nback and forth in that conversation.\n\n236\n00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.710\nJust three, just to create\nthe TCP handshake for using TCP.\n\n237\n00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.400\nSo let's take a closer look at this.\n\n238\n00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:19.240\nAgain, I got that TCP tab\nselected up at the top and\n\n239\n00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.710\nwhat we're gonna do is I want to,\nI'm gonna actually sort this by port.\n\n240\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:28.590\nIf I look at the source address,\nthey're almost all the same here,\n\n241\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.780\nwell at least these first ones.\n\n242\n00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.110\nI'm gonna sort this by port,\ndestination port.\n\n243\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.483\nAnd now something starts\nto show itself here.\n\n244\n00:13:40.483 --> 00:13:46.193\nIf we look at the details,\nwhat we're seeing is that 10.39.5.6\n\n245\n00:13:46.193 --> 00:13:50.898\nis sending data to 10.39.5.2 and\nthey hit port 1.\n\n246\n00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:51.954\nHmm, okay.\n\n247\n00:13:51.954 --> 00:13:52.686\nBut it was only one packet.\n\n248\n00:13:52.686 --> 00:13:54.044\nThen they hit port 3.\n\n249\n00:13:54.044 --> 00:13:59.060\nThey tried one twice.\n\n250\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.750\nThen they hit 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 17.\n\n251\n00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.240\nHmm, interesting.\n\n252\n00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.440\nSeems to be a nice.\n\n253\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.060\n&gt;&gt; Sequential.\n\n254\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.290\n&gt;&gt; Sequential, yeah, set.\n\n255\n00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.720\nSo Daniel, if you had to guess.\n\n256\n00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.520\nWhat do you think might be going on here?\n\n257\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.190\n&gt;&gt; I would probably assume\nthis some sort of port scam.\n\n258\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:15.820\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n259\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.515\nNow I have evidence that somebody\nat 10.39.5.6 is doing a port\n\n260\n00:14:20.515 --> 00:14:22.560\nscan on 10.39.5.2.\n\n261\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:28.520\nI can see single packets and sometimes\ntwo if it's closed sometimes Wireshark or\n\n262\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.810\nthose other programs will try again just\nto make sure to validate the results.\n\n263\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:36.060\nBut yeah, all these single packets,\nit's just a port scan.\n\n264\n00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.980\nAnd you can see them as\nit goes all the way down,\n\n265\n00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:44.040\nlooks like they scanned all the way up to,\nwow they did a big scan.\n\n266\n00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.720\nSo they went well past 10 24.\n\n267\n00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.619\n&gt;&gt; Or they did the top thousand\npoorest of [CROSSTALK].\n\n268\n00:14:47.619 --> 00:14:49.315\n&gt;&gt; They might have done the top thousand.\n\n269\n00:14:49.315 --> 00:14:50.390\nLet's see where it stops.\n\n270\n00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.580\nWe'll just keep on trucking.\n\n271\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.850\nThey went past that.\n\n272\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.580\nThey did a full scan, pretty much.\n\n273\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.167\nWell.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n274\n00:14:55.167 --> 00:14:56.566\nit's the top thousand\nbecause it's not every.\n\n275\n00:14:56.566 --> 00:14:57.360\n&gt;&gt; Top thousand.\n\n276\n00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.187\nYeah, yeah,yeah.\n\n277\n00:14:59.187 --> 00:15:00.962\n&gt;&gt; It is probably about 1,000 peccas.\n\n278\n00:15:00.962 --> 00:15:03.890\nAll right, so that's something\nthat I wouldn't have seen.\n\n279\n00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.530\nOr might not have noticed if I was\njust looking at the packets in that\n\n280\n00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.490\nfirst window.\n\n281\n00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.790\nSo by following the conversations,\n\n282\n00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:14.140\nlooking at the conversations I can\nsee patterns like this, right.\n\n283\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.180\nYou start noticing single,\ndouble two packet conversations.\n\n284\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.790\nSomething might be funny going on.\n\n285\n00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.150\nOr it might be meant to be.\n\n286\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.730\nMaybe somebody in your network\nwas supposed to be doing a scan.\n\n287\n00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.380\nAll right, I'm gonna close that and\nI'm gonna come back out here to wireshark.\n\n288\n00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.280\nI'm gonna right click on\nthat first packet again, and\n\n289\n00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.140\nI'm gonna choose follow TCP stream.\n\n290\n00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:40.120\nNow what this is gonna do is look\nat that particular conversation and\n\n291\n00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.150\nnormally it would show me\nall the data right here.\n\n292\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.230\nIf there was any data in those packets and\npay load it would show up right here.\n\n293\n00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.070\nSo this blank screen\nactually tells me something.\n\n294\n00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.860\nIt tells me that there's\nnot data in there.\n\n295\n00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.410\nThere was no pay load.\n\n296\n00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.800\nWhich is again kinda odd unless we already\nknow that it was a port scan, right?\n\n297\n00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.930\nAnd they're not sending\nany payload with those.\n\n298\n00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.105\nAnd so we'll close that.\n\n299\n00:16:02.105 --> 00:16:04.499\nAnd again if there was text in there,\nplain text,\n\n300\n00:16:04.499 --> 00:16:06.564\nyou would read it right\nout of that window.\n\n301\n00:16:06.564 --> 00:16:10.970\nI could see your email that you sent\nyour coworker talking about me, and\n\n302\n00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.740\nnow I'm gonna come get you.\n\n303\n00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.250\n&gt;&gt; Your FTP password.\n\n304\n00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, your FTP password, exactly.\n\n305\n00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.688\nAll right, let's see what else we can do.\n\n306\n00:16:17.688 --> 00:16:21.001\nNow, notice once I followed that stream,\nI closed it,\n\n307\n00:16:21.001 --> 00:16:23.860\nnow I've only got three packets left,\nright?\n\n308\n00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.940\nThey're all still there.\n\n309\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.950\nIt's just being filtered.\n\n310\n00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.830\nIf you look up here at the top, and\nagain I know that's extremely small.\n\n311\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.029\nBut when I chose follow stream,\n\n312\n00:16:32.029 --> 00:16:36.760\nWireshark then applied a filter to\nshow just that one conversation.\n\n313\n00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.350\nAnd there's the three packets.\n\n314\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.080\nAnd take a look over here.\n\n315\n00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.240\nInteresting, right?\n\n316\n00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.010\nThere's my SYN packet.\n\n317\n00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.080\nThat's the synchronization request.\n\n318\n00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.130\nThe server responded with a SYN-ACK.\n\n319\n00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.700\nThat's him acknowledging\nmy SYN request and\n\n320\n00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.810\nrequesting a synchronization of its own.\n\n321\n00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.960\nBut then the host sent back a reset.\n\n322\n00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.079\nSo it said, hey, I got your\nacknowledgment, but you know what?\n\n323\n00:16:59.079 --> 00:17:00.910\nI don't want to talk to you anymore,\nbasically.\n\n324\n00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.470\nAnd that's that port scan going on, right?\n\n325\n00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:03.602\nAll it wants to know is,\n\n326\n00:17:03.602 --> 00:17:06.843\nis there a response from that port\nthat tells me if it's open or not?\n\n327\n00:17:06.843 --> 00:17:10.320\nBut then I'm gonna reset it because\nI don't wanna finish the connection.\n\n328\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.773\nWe probably weren't doing\na TCP connect scan.\n\n329\n00:17:12.773 --> 00:17:14.750\nI don't know what they were using\nwhen they created this capture.\n\n330\n00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:19.020\nBut it wasn't a TCP connect scan because\nI'd see all three phases of that.\n\n331\n00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.197\nSo this is probably a-\n&gt;&gt; It's a Stealth scan.\n\n332\n00:17:20.197 --> 00:17:23.390\n&gt;&gt; The Stealth scan that they do,\nthe little s, capital S.\n\n333\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.700\nWhere it just resets the connection\ninstead of actually establishing\n\n334\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.220\nthe connection.\n\n335\n00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.310\nAll right, let's go ahead and\nclear my filter.\n\n336\n00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.850\nTo clear the filter, up here at this\ngreen bar I'm gonna click the X.\n\n337\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.780\nAnd that'll clear my filter and\nI'm back to all of my normal packets.\n\n338\n00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.570\nKeep in mind display filters\ndoesn't remove packets.\n\n339\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.940\nDisplay filter just filters\nwhat you're seeing.\n\n340\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.330\nSo you can always apply a filter and\nthen remove the filter and\n\n341\n00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.770\nall the packets are still there.\n\n342\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.730\nYou can do a Capture Filter,\n\n343\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.710\nwhich means you can set the filter\nbefore you start the capture.\n\n344\n00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:58.173\nAnd that way, you can limit what\npackage you capture in the first place.\n\n345\n00:17:58.173 --> 00:18:02.680\nYou might want to make a smaller capture\nfile, exactly what you're looking for.\n\n346\n00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.230\nNormally, though,\nif we're just doing baselines or\n\n347\n00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.930\ngetting an idea of what's going on,\nwe don't do a capture filter.\n\n348\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.740\nCuz I wanna capture everything and\n\n349\n00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.190\nthen I can use display filters\nto make it easier to look at.\n\n350\n00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.300\nAlso keep in mind, and I think we\nmentioned this the other day, Daniel,\n\n351\n00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:21.150\nwe talk about switched ethernet,\nwhich is what most networks are nowadays.\n\n352\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.010\nSo when you run packet captures, you're\nonly gonna see, if you're connected to\n\n353\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.770\na switch, you're only gonna see stuff\nthat that switch allows out that port,\n\n354\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:33.780\nwhich is only things that are destined for\nyou or broadcast traffic, all right?\n\n355\n00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.000\nSo if you wanna see the rest\nof the traffic on the network,\n\n356\n00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.300\nif I wanna sniff Daniel's traffic and\nsee what he's doing on the Internet,\n\n357\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.570\nwhat websites he's visiting, for\nexample, I'd have to get between him and\n\n358\n00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.950\nthe switch or I have to maybe get\non the other side of the switch.\n\n359\n00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.380\nGood place to do monitoring is a proxy,\nright,\n\n360\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.660\nif you want to monitor\npeople's web traffic.\n\n361\n00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.890\nBecause everybody has to go through\nthe proxy to get out of my organization\n\n362\n00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.180\nto the Internet, right?\n\n363\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.910\nSo if I do my monitoring there,\nthat server, even though it's\n\n364\n00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.240\nswitched ethernet, that server sees, all\nthat traffic is going through that server.\n\n365\n00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.117\nSo I can capture all that information.\n\n366\n00:19:05.117 --> 00:19:07.030\n&gt;&gt; But this doesn't mean\nyou're completely safe, right?\n\n367\n00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:12.296\nYou could perform a man-in-the-middle\nattack and be gathering all that traffic,\n\n368\n00:19:12.296 --> 00:19:15.966\nmaking all the computers think\nthat you are the place to go.\n\n369\n00:19:15.966 --> 00:19:16.807\nAnd that traffic-\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n370\n00:19:16.807 --> 00:19:19.030\n&gt;&gt; And then redirecting it back\nout to where it's supposed to be.\n\n371\n00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.400\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, or\nwe could flood the switch.\n\n372\n00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.260\nOlder switches\nare susceptible to flooding,\n\n373\n00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.540\nwhere their content adjustable memory,\n\n374\n00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.820\ntheir CAM table, that they keep\nthe who's at what port information.\n\n375\n00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.260\nIf I can send so many registrations to\nthat, I can maybe make it give up and\n\n376\n00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.050\nact more like a hub and\njust spit everything out every port.\n\n377\n00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.043\nMost switches will actually fail closed\nnowadays and just say nope, I'm not doing\n\n378\n00:19:44.043 --> 00:19:47.935\nanything out that port, rather than I give\nup and push everything out that port.\n\n379\n00:19:47.935 --> 00:19:48.933\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I give up.\n\n380\n00:19:48.933 --> 00:19:50.333\nI'm just a hub now, forget it.\n\n381\n00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:52.578\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n382\n00:19:52.578 --> 00:19:56.488\nlet's see what else we\nwant to do with this.\n\n383\n00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:59.081\nThey mentioned packet 42\nmight be exciting, so\n\n384\n00:19:59.081 --> 00:20:00.818\nlet's go take a look at that one.\n\n385\n00:20:00.818 --> 00:20:03.772\nI'll right-click, follow stream.\n\n386\n00:20:03.772 --> 00:20:07.070\nAnd we'll see that it has no data in it,\nso no payload.\n\n387\n00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.740\nBut there's the two packets in this one.\n\n388\n00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.092\nAnd I can see source was 5.6,\ndestination 5.2.\n\n389\n00:20:13.092 --> 00:20:16.980\nThere was a SYN flag sent, or\na packet with a SYN flag raised, and\n\n390\n00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.060\nthen it looks like it came back\nwith a reset acknowledgement.\n\n391\n00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.211\nBut look at the port.\n\n392\n00:20:23.211 --> 00:20:27.949\nI can see from 54436 to port 23.\n\n393\n00:20:27.949 --> 00:20:29.760\nWho knows what port 23 is?\n\n394\n00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:31.960\n&gt;&gt; I know!\n&gt;&gt; Daniel, sir.\n\n395\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is, well, good old Telnet.\n\n396\n00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.370\n&gt;&gt; Telnet it is.\n\n397\n00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.120\nSo there's an example.\n\n398\n00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.142\nSomebody was trying to create a Telnet\nconnection to 5.2, but 5.2 reset it.\n\n399\n00:20:41.142 --> 00:20:44.100\nAnd so\nit didn't accept the Telnet connection.\n\n400\n00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.920\nThis is the kind of thing you can learn by\ncapturing those packets on your network.\n\n401\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.321\nAll right, now let's actually\ncapture some live data, right?\n\n402\n00:20:51.321 --> 00:20:53.272\nLet's close this file.\n\n403\n00:20:56.032 --> 00:20:57.657\nAnd to create a new capture,\n\n404\n00:20:57.657 --> 00:21:01.128\ndown here at the bottom I can\nsee where the capture filter is.\n\n405\n00:21:01.128 --> 00:21:03.617\nAnd it looks like it says not port 3389.\n\n406\n00:21:03.617 --> 00:21:06.110\nThat's because of\nWireshark's pretty smart.\n\n407\n00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.678\nAnd it actually realizes that\nI'm remoting in to this machine.\n\n408\n00:21:09.678 --> 00:21:13.536\nAnd it says most likely you don't\nwanna see all of that traffic, right?\n\n409\n00:21:13.536 --> 00:21:18.183\nI don't need to see the packet capture of\nthe Wireshark display being displayed on\n\n410\n00:21:18.183 --> 00:21:19.407\nmy computer, yeah.\n\n411\n00:21:19.407 --> 00:21:20.470\nSo we can ignore that.\n\n412\n00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.504\nSo it's saying, hey, let's not do 3389.\n\n413\n00:21:22.504 --> 00:21:26.540\nAnd then below that I've got\na list of my network adapters.\n\n414\n00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.338\nAnd I would pick the one that\nI wanted to monitor, and\n\n415\n00:21:29.338 --> 00:21:32.596\nthen we're just gonna go ahead and\nclick Start, all right?\n\n416\n00:21:32.596 --> 00:21:34.070\nSo that's gonna to start the process.\n\n417\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.780\nAnd you'll see, I'm gonna remove\nthis display filter there,\n\n418\n00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.260\nyou'll see packets start\nflying through here.\n\n419\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.677\nNow, while that's going, let me pull\nup a command prompt real quick.\n\n420\n00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:47.497\nAnd I'm gonna ping, let's see,\nI'm on the client, so\n\n421\n00:21:47.497 --> 00:21:50.453\nlet's ping the domain controller 200.\n\n422\n00:21:50.453 --> 00:21:54.216\nAlthough, oops, that's not the right\naddress, a little typo there.\n\n423\n00:21:54.216 --> 00:21:57.588\nLet's get rid of that extra 1.\n\n424\n00:21:57.588 --> 00:22:01.102\nAll right, so\nwe'll throw some ping packets at it.\n\n425\n00:22:01.102 --> 00:22:07.854\nWhy don't we do a little\ntracert to Microsoft dot, oops.\n\n426\n00:22:09.831 --> 00:22:13.492\nMicrosoft.com, we'll let that go.\n\n427\n00:22:13.492 --> 00:22:18.327\nHeck, and while we're doing that, let's\nopen up everybody's favorite browser.\n\n428\n00:22:18.327 --> 00:22:19.423\n&gt;&gt; You go to everybody's\nfavorite search engine.\n\n429\n00:22:19.423 --> 00:22:21.283\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\ngo to everybody's favorite search engine.\n\n430\n00:22:21.283 --> 00:22:27.746\nWe'll go to windows.microsoft.com.\n\n431\n00:22:29.389 --> 00:22:31.320\nI would just pull up a web page,\njust a random web page.\n\n432\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.430\nYou guys can use whatever page you\nwant as you're doing these labs.\n\n433\n00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:37.233\nAnd I'll go ahead and close my browser.\n\n434\n00:22:37.233 --> 00:22:39.886\nAnd it looks like my\ntracert is still running.\n\n435\n00:22:41.942 --> 00:22:45.024\nWe'll give that just a minute to\nfinish up, and then we'll take\n\n436\n00:22:45.024 --> 00:22:48.519\na look at our results and we'll see\nwhat data we have actually captured.\n\n437\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.079\nTake a look at doing some filters as well.\n\n438\n00:22:53.079 --> 00:22:56.163\nAlthough this is taking,\nwhat do we got, one more?\n\n439\n00:22:56.163 --> 00:22:57.258\nYeah, we'll go ahead and kill that.\n\n440\n00:22:57.258 --> 00:23:00.266\nWe've probably seen enough of that.\n\n441\n00:23:00.266 --> 00:23:02.227\nSo we'll kill that little tracert.\n\n442\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:05.030\nI say I will.\n\n443\n00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.000\nThere we go.\n\n444\n00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.120\nAnd we'll close that down, and now I'm\ngonna go ahead and stop this capture.\n\n445\n00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.455\nNow, the first thing you'll notice\nis look at all that PTPv2 traffic.\n\n446\n00:23:13.455 --> 00:23:15.070\nThis is what I was talking about earlier.\n\n447\n00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.610\nThat's actually our phones on\nour network syncing their time,\n\n448\n00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.620\nmaking sure they're synced.\n\n449\n00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.066\nI don't know, either they have\n\n450\n00:23:22.066 --> 00:23:23.916\na really poor clock in the phone-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n451\n00:23:23.916 --> 00:23:25.172\n&gt;&gt; I mean, get a better crystal.\n\n452\n00:23:25.172 --> 00:23:29.310\nIf you've gotta synchronize every second,\nsomething's wrong.\n\n453\n00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.235\nIf you're shifted in time that fast,\nsomething's not right.\n\n454\n00:23:32.235 --> 00:23:35.460\nNo, I'm just teasing with you guys,\nPolycom.\n\n455\n00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.460\nSo let's do a display filter and\nget rid of that.\n\n456\n00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.850\nSo I'm gonna say not PTP.\n\n457\n00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.570\nNow, you'll see that bar up there\nturns red as I start typing.\n\n458\n00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.350\nThat's telling me my\nfilter is not correct.\n\n459\n00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.800\nIt doesn't understand\nthe filter that I'm creating.\n\n460\n00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.550\nAs soon as I finish my filter though,\nit says, and it turns green.\n\n461\n00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.330\nThat means I can go ahead and apply it.\n\n462\n00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.790\nI'm gonna hit Enter.\n\n463\n00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:01.217\nAnd now you'll notice all the PTP\npackets are going to be gone.\n\n464\n00:24:01.217 --> 00:24:04.279\nI can also create, you can get complex.\n\n465\n00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:07.628\nI could do ands and ors.\n\n466\n00:24:07.628 --> 00:24:08.364\nIf I gotta remember.\n\n467\n00:24:08.364 --> 00:24:12.237\nI think the pipe is the or,\n\n468\n00:24:12.237 --> 00:24:17.050\nI should do an and, and not.\n\n469\n00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:17.790\nI'll say ARP.\n\n470\n00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.440\nSo now, I'm saying not PTP and not ARP.\n\n471\n00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.900\nSo, I'm just listing the protocols and\nI'm limiting, I'm just filtering it down\n\n472\n00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.600\nbecause, you're looking at hundreds or\nthousands of packets potentially and\n\n473\n00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.290\nyou wanna be really be focusing\non what you need to see.\n\n474\n00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.710\nI know you guys can't see that filter very\nwell up there, play around with that,\n\n475\n00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:39.680\nyou can use.\n\n476\n00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.750\nIf I just type a simple protocol, if I\nwipe all this out and just type in TCP,\n\n477\n00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.510\nthat's gonna say I'm only gonna show you,\nbasically, TCP packets.\n\n478\n00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:56.440\nIf you add the word nottcp,\nright now it's not gonna show TCP packets.\n\n479\n00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.310\nSo, that's what I was doing up there, all\nprotocols are just listed as lowercase.\n\n480\n00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.690\nBut play around with\nthose filters up there.\n\n481\n00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.977\nSo, I'm gonna put that back notptp,\n\n482\n00:25:05.977 --> 00:25:10.823\nampersand ampersand is the and,\npipe, pipe is the or.\n\n483\n00:25:10.823 --> 00:25:17.975\nSo, if I wanted to see TCP and UDP and\nnothing else I could do TCP || UDP.\n\n484\n00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:21.620\nCuz that's gonna say, TCP or\nUDP packets would be displayed.\n\n485\n00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.320\nI'm doing not, so I'm negating and I'm\ngonna do, what was the other one I did?\n\n486\n00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.280\nARP, I'll throw that in there.\n\n487\n00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.280\n&gt;&gt; What's funny is that double pipe is\nwhat's known as a logical operation.\n\n488\n00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.155\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, logical operators.\n\n489\n00:25:34.155 --> 00:25:36.580\n[INAUDIBLE] come up with that,\nbut it is appropriate.\n\n490\n00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.661\nVery good, I like that.\n\n491\n00:25:38.661 --> 00:25:40.000\nLet's see what else we can do with this.\n\n492\n00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.719\nLet's take a look,\nwhy don't we filter it down to ICMP.\n\n493\n00:25:43.719 --> 00:25:45.410\nSo, I'm gonna get rid\nof my display filter,\n\n494\n00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.890\nI'm just gonna put ICMP and hit Enter.\n\n495\n00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.700\nAnd there's my echo request.\n\n496\n00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:56.114\nI sent from 100.101 to 100.200,\nthere's the second one.\n\n497\n00:25:56.114 --> 00:25:57.710\nThere's the reply coming back.\n\n498\n00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.897\nIn fact,\nlet's follow that stream real quick.\n\n499\n00:26:00.897 --> 00:26:04.148\nIt's not going to let me\nbecause it's not TCP.\n\n500\n00:26:04.148 --> 00:26:05.110\nBut we can see it here.\n\n501\n00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.810\nI can see source and\ndestination echo request.\n\n502\n00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:08.850\nEcho request.\n\n503\n00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:09.786\nThere's a reply.\n\n504\n00:26:09.786 --> 00:26:10.900\nThere's another request.\n\n505\n00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.604\nThere's my replies.\n\n506\n00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:16.141\nSo, we can see that traffic go on back and\nforth.\n\n507\n00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:19.302\nWhat else did we do?\n\n508\n00:26:19.302 --> 00:26:21.894\nLet's take a look at the webpage we went.\n\n509\n00:26:21.894 --> 00:26:25.420\nLet's do http filter for that.\n\n510\n00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.429\nI'm not the only one on this network so\n\n511\n00:26:29.429 --> 00:26:35.840\nI need to find my source,\nwhich is gonna be 100.101.\n\n512\n00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.870\nSo, let's do another filter,\nI'm gonna say http\n\n513\n00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:47.780\nand IP and once I type IP I get this list.\n\n514\n00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.778\nThese are things that I can used\nto filter and I want IPv4 or\n\n515\n00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:56.871\nactually it's just\nip.address in this case.\n\n516\n00:26:56.871 --> 00:27:04.347\nIt should be in here,\n.adr, there we go, ip.adr.\n\n517\n00:27:04.347 --> 00:27:12.180\nIt didn't like that.\n\n518\n00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:12.689\n= = 10, 0, 100 to 101.\n\n519\n00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:19.675\nAnd now I'm seeing that conversation\nof where I went to that webpage, and\n\n520\n00:27:19.675 --> 00:27:24.208\nif we find it, like there's an HTTP get\npacket, so that's me connecting and\n\n521\n00:27:24.208 --> 00:27:25.982\nrequesting those webpages.\n\n522\n00:27:25.982 --> 00:27:28.105\nTheres some more gets as\nI get the banner ads and\n\n523\n00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:30.900\nall the other things that\nare coming back with that website.\n\n524\n00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.128\nAnd let's just see if we can find\nanything interesting with it.\n\n525\n00:27:35.128 --> 00:27:37.070\nI'm just gonna kinda cycle through these.\n\n526\n00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.147\nI'm just using my down arrow.\n\n527\n00:27:40.147 --> 00:27:42.855\nAnd what I'm doing is I'm looking\nat the bottom pane to see\n\n528\n00:27:42.855 --> 00:27:46.255\nif I can find anything that's\nexciting that I wanna show you guys.\n\n529\n00:27:46.255 --> 00:27:47.083\nYou can see it.\n\n530\n00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:50.325\nUnfortunately, it's creating, everything\nnowadays is a secure connection.\n\n531\n00:27:50.325 --> 00:27:52.185\nI was doing an episode the other day and\n\n532\n00:27:52.185 --> 00:27:56.125\nI was trying to find something that I\ncould connect to that didn't default\n\n533\n00:27:56.125 --> 00:28:00.657\nto HTTPS so I could show you guys some\nplain text traffic I think just connecting\n\n534\n00:28:00.657 --> 00:28:01.964\nto Google is now secure and-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n535\n00:28:01.964 --> 00:28:02.816\n&gt;&gt; All encrypted.\n\n536\n00:28:02.816 --> 00:28:06.374\n&gt;&gt; Yes, everything is secure and\nencrypted, which is a good thing unless\n\n537\n00:28:06.374 --> 00:28:08.612\nyou're trying to demonstrate-\n&gt;&gt; Show that.\n\n538\n00:28:08.612 --> 00:28:10.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some other stuff, and\n\n539\n00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.817\nit does become a challenge.\n\n540\n00:28:12.817 --> 00:28:15.222\nSo yeah, all of that's actually encrypted.\n\n541\n00:28:15.222 --> 00:28:18.001\nYou'll see that there's really\nnot a lot you can see down here,\n\n542\n00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:19.560\nbecause everything is encrypted.\n\n543\n00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.230\nIt's just a bunch of gargly goop but\nthat is the actual payload.\n\n544\n00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.750\nI know we're running short on time, let me\nsee what else I want to show everybody.\n\n545\n00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:31.274\nWe talked about the display filters,\nlooked at how to set those up.\n\n546\n00:28:31.274 --> 00:28:32.950\nAgain, play around with\nthose display filters.\n\n547\n00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:36.330\nA lot of prebuilt ones in wire shark.\n\n548\n00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.909\nYou can also click this\nexpression builder over here, and\n\n549\n00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:45.590\nyou can see all these different\nfields that I can filter by.\n\n550\n00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.993\nAnd as you can see by the scroll bar size,\nit's a pretty extensive list, yes.\n\n551\n00:28:49.993 --> 00:28:52.540\nSo, you can get really, really complex.\n\n552\n00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:57.614\nYou can start grabbing these filters and\nadding them and building.\n\n553\n00:28:57.614 --> 00:29:01.838\nAnd then you can use greater than or\ncontains, matches, is present to build\n\n554\n00:29:01.838 --> 00:29:06.415\nreally complex filters to narrow down\nto exactly what you're looking for.\n\n555\n00:29:06.415 --> 00:29:10.285\nThat is probably one of the best\nthings you can do with Wire Shark.\n\n556\n00:29:10.285 --> 00:29:12.704\nIf you're gonna get there and\nstudy and play with Wire Shark,\n\n557\n00:29:12.704 --> 00:29:13.784\nis work with your filters.\n\n558\n00:29:13.784 --> 00:29:17.586\nGet good at filtering data because\nfinding what you're looking for\n\n559\n00:29:17.586 --> 00:29:20.205\nin a pack of capture is the big challenge.\n\n560\n00:29:20.205 --> 00:29:24.465\nBeing able to interpret these results,\nbeing to look at the conversation,\n\n561\n00:29:24.465 --> 00:29:28.075\nfind the destination address,\npacket out of all of these packets.\n\n562\n00:29:28.075 --> 00:29:29.703\nWhat packets were bound for my server?\n\n563\n00:29:29.703 --> 00:29:31.791\nCuz that's where the attack took place, so\n\n564\n00:29:31.791 --> 00:29:34.564\nI need to see what packets were\ncoming inbound to that guy.\n\n565\n00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:37.127\nSo, being able to work with those filters,\n\n566\n00:29:37.127 --> 00:29:41.930\nextremely important in any packet\ncapture utility that you're gonna use.\n\n567\n00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.100\nThe last thing I'll do\nis let's do one more.\n\n568\n00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.259\nI know Daniel's like, we're out of time.\n\n569\n00:29:48.259 --> 00:29:51.924\nI'm gonna ignore him for a second because\nwe're gonna do something kinda cool here.\n\n570\n00:29:51.924 --> 00:29:54.745\n&gt;&gt; That's hazardous to your health, Mike.\n\n571\n00:29:54.745 --> 00:29:57.982\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna open up file explorer here on\n\n572\n00:29:57.982 --> 00:30:00.550\nthis server, eventually.\n\n573\n00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.800\nIt knows I'm in a hurry and so\nnow it's gonna go really, really slow, and\n\n574\n00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:08.490\nI'm just gonna make a new\nfile on my C drive out here.\n\n575\n00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:12.690\nWe'll say new text documents and\n\n576\n00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:16.180\nin there I'm gonna put some\ninformation look it's a secret.\n\n577\n00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:20.727\nAccount number 123456789 and\n\n578\n00:30:20.727 --> 00:30:23.940\nI go ahead and save that guy.\n\n579\n00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.593\nThen I'm gonna go back\nover to my client and\n\n580\n00:30:27.593 --> 00:30:32.570\nwe're going to go ahead and\nconnect first to that server.\n\n581\n00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.243\nI should be able to get there, let's see.\n\n582\n00:30:35.243 --> 00:30:40.045\n10.0.100, 200, see $1.\n\n583\n00:30:40.045 --> 00:30:42.760\nI got me some admin\ncredentials over there.\n\n584\n00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.490\nAnd, where did it go?\n\n585\n00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.050\nThere's my new text document.\n\n586\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:46.330\nSo, I'm kind of getting things set up, and\n\n587\n00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:50.520\nthen what I'm gonna do is we're\ngoing to start a new capture.\n\n588\n00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.430\nSo, if I click on the little blue fin,\n\n589\n00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.450\nnormally I would save the other\ncapture if I needed to.\n\n590\n00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.091\nI'm gonna say continue without saving.\n\n591\n00:30:57.091 --> 00:30:58.380\nIt starts a new capture.\n\n592\n00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:03.130\nI'm going to drag this file to my\ndesktop and say, yes, I trust it.\n\n593\n00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:06.218\nAnd then I'm gonna stop my capture.\n\n594\n00:31:06.218 --> 00:31:12.145\nNow we're gonna filter this down to, let's\nsay, SMB, should be what we are looking.\n\n595\n00:31:12.145 --> 00:31:15.730\nI just served 20 to 12 so\nlet's do SNB two.\n\n596\n00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:16.528\nHere we go.\n\n597\n00:31:16.528 --> 00:31:21.260\nHere is my conversation from\n10.0.100.101 to the server.\n\n598\n00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.720\nIf I right click and\n\n599\n00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:28.000\nfollow stream, here are the packets\nthat are going back and forth.\n\n600\n00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.680\nGreat information.\n\n601\n00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.748\nLooks good.\n\n602\n00:31:31.748 --> 00:31:32.736\nAren't you excited?\n\n603\n00:31:32.736 --> 00:31:33.253\nBut look right here.\n\n604\n00:31:33.253 --> 00:31:35.715\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n605\n00:31:35.715 --> 00:31:39.293\n&gt;&gt; Account number 123456789.\n\n606\n00:31:39.293 --> 00:31:42.340\nSo, we were able to see that data,\nin fact, let's do one more.\n\n607\n00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.520\nNot another capture but\nI'm gonna close that.\n\n608\n00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.460\nWhere else you can see that,\nif I find that particular packet,\n\n609\n00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.870\nwhich is right here, then on the bottom\npane where I said it decodes it for\n\n610\n00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.980\nyou That was definitely not the packet.\n\n611\n00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.611\nSo, let's just flip through,\nthere it is, right there.\n\n612\n00:31:55.611 --> 00:31:57.950\nMy read response, account 123456789.\n\n613\n00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.040\nSo, that's what I'm saying,\nwith tools like this,\n\n614\n00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.500\none you can get yourself in trouble.\n\n615\n00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.090\nBut this is really what allows you to take\na deep look at the traffic that's going on\n\n616\n00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:06.990\nin your network.\n\n617\n00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.596\nSo, you can analyze attacks or potential\nattacks, find out what's going on.\n\n618\n00:32:10.596 --> 00:32:15.260\nSo play around with Wire Shark or whatever\npacket capture utility of your choice.\n\n619\n00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.130\nGet familiar with it, it's something\nthat you really need in your toolbox.\n\n620\n00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.470\n&gt;&gt; And very cool stuff Mike.\n\n621\n00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:23.769\nWe really appreciate you stopping by and\nexplaining packet capturing,\n\n622\n00:32:23.769 --> 00:32:28.498\npacket sniffing software to us because it\nis a very handy thing to know how to do.\n\n623\n00:32:28.498 --> 00:32:31.540\nIt's nice to be able to use it for\ntrouble shooting purposes.\n\n624\n00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.190\nIt's nice to be able to trust but verify\n\n625\n00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:39.440\nthat the machines on your system are only\npassing traffic that they should be.\n\n626\n00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.670\nMaybe you've got malware on one and\nyour suspicious of it.\n\n627\n00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.360\nThrow up the packet capture.\n\n628\n00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.550\nPut your filter in place to see what\nconversations are happening between\n\n629\n00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.770\nthat machine specifically and\nwhere ever else that you like and\n\n630\n00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:52.800\nthen check that out and\nsee what's going on in there.\n\n631\n00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.820\nMaybe find someone internally\nis sniffing your network.\n\n632\n00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.340\nWe talked about this, inside threats.\n\n633\n00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.670\nDon't forget about that,\nyou want to see that happening.\n\n634\n00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:01.930\nHey, where's that scan coming from?\n\n635\n00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.525\nIt's coming from Bob's\ncomputer on the third floor.\n\n636\n00:33:04.525 --> 00:33:06.790\nHe shouldn't be doing that,\nhe's in accounting.\n\n637\n00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:07.960\nWhy is he scanning the network?\n\n638\n00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:12.075\nSo, very interesting stuff, and then of\ncourse being able to save that stuff for\n\n639\n00:33:12.075 --> 00:33:15.053\nlater for further exploration\nis also very handy as well.\n\n640\n00:33:15.053 --> 00:33:17.420\nSo, hopefully you got\na lot out of this episode.\n\n641\n00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.060\nVery good information.\n\n642\n00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.600\nThat being said, though,\nwe are out of time for this one so\n\n643\n00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.010\nwe're gonna have to close it down.\n\n644\n00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:24.141\nThanks for joining us everyone.\n\n645\n00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:27.070\nSigning off for ITPro TV I've\nbeen your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n646\n00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n647\n00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.257\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n648\n00:33:31.032 -->

00:00:12.520\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.999\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:18.761\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n7\n00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:22.650\nand in today's episode we are kicking\noff more on our CFR series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.630\nThat's right,\nthe old CyberSec First Responder.\n\n9\n00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.610\nAnd joining me back in the studio is one\nof the craziest people I've ever met in\n\n10\n00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.630\nmy entire life.\n\n11\n00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.360\nOur good friend, Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.130\nMike, welcome back.\n\n13\n00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.240\nHow's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.285\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I'm crazy.\n\n15\n00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:36.208\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's loco.\n\n16\n00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:38.364\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back.\n\n17\n00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:39.048\nGlad to be here.\n\n18\n00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:44.330\nAnd yeah, continuing on with our\ngood old CFR-210 Logical Operations.\n\n19\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.050\nSo today we're gonna take a look at,\nkind of the next phase,\n\n20\n00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.750\nif you've been following these\nepisodes along in order.\n\n21\n00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.830\nGoing through the, basically,\nan attack methodology, if you will.\n\n22\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.990\nBecause as a first responder,\n\n23\n00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.500\nor anybody in security, we need to\nunderstand exactly what they're doing.\n\n24\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.740\nHow they're going about\nattacking our systems.\n\n25\n00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.330\nSo we can better defend against it, right?\n\n26\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.240\nSo we've talked about kind of the\nreconnaissance, doing that footprinting.\n\n27\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.980\nGathering all the information\nwe can about our target.\n\n28\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.550\nWe've looked at doing some scanning.\n\n29\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.000\nTrying to see what's out there,\nwhat hosts are up,\n\n30\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.520\nwhat ports they have open,\nwhat services they're offering.\n\n31\n00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.400\nSo we can get an idea of what it is, or\nhow they're going to attack the system.\n\n32\n00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.210\nOr how the bad guys would be attacking\nour system if we're looking at it from\n\n33\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.660\na security standpoint.\n\n34\n00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.430\nAnd then we took at doing\nvulnerability scans, right.\n\n35\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.379\nWhich is really once we found our live\nhost, we see what services are running.\n\n36\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.700\nWe can use that information and\n\n37\n00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.070\nsearch through some vulnerability\ndatabases, like Offensive Security.\n\n38\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.500\nOr I'm trying to think of\nwhat some of the other\n\n39\n00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.790\nvulnerability databases are out there.\n\n40\n00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.260\nBut there's the Common Vulnerabilities and\nExploit database,\n\n41\n00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.860\nthe CVE, that we can search through.\n\n42\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.093\nOnce I know you're running,\nsay Apache version x, right.\n\n43\n00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:03.607\nI can now go through and see what\nvulnerabilities that particular version\n\n44\n00:02:03.607 --> 00:02:07.280\nmight be susceptible to,\nif it's not patched.\n\n45\n00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.180\nReally the next phase\nthat we wanna get into,\n\n46\n00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.060\nas we start into our gaining access phase,\nright?\n\n47\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.520\nOnce we've done our reconnaissance,\nwe've done our scanning.\n\n48\n00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.890\nThen they start the gaining access phase.\n\n49\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.820\nAnd for that, typically,\nwe need a password, right?\n\n50\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.520\nI mean it really depends on\nthe vulnerability that you're gonna use.\n\n51\n00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.860\nIt's just another method of attack.\n\n52\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.520\nSome vulnerabilities you exploit,\nyou might not need.\n\n53\n00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.830\nAnd that's one of the reasons we use them,\nbecause we're gonna kind of bypass\n\n54\n00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.978\nthe authentication by doing maybe a buffer\noverflow, or some other form of attack.\n\n55\n00:02:36.978 --> 00:02:40.580\nBut having usernames and passwords\nis a big part of the attack process.\n\n56\n00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.890\nSo the question is how\ndo they obtain that?\n\n57\n00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.510\nHow do the bad guys get our usernames and\nour passwords to our systems?\n\n58\n00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.530\nAnd different methods that we can use,\nright.\n\n59\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.460\nUsernames are pretty easy,\ntypically, to come up with.\n\n60\n00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.130\nEspecially if you're an insider\nbecause you already know the format.\n\n61\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.480\nLike first initial, last name or\nfirst name, middle initial,\n\n62\n00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.310\nlast initial, whatever the case may be.\n\n63\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.000\nTypically not too hard to figure\nout some of the usernames.\n\n64\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.610\nThere's always the built in accounts,\nthat are administrator,\n\n65\n00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.193\nthat's one that I really\nlove to get access to.\n\n66\n00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.870\nSo the username part of\nit we've got to discover.\n\n67\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.700\nAnd we can do that through\nsome of our scanning.\n\n68\n00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.670\nWe can do our enumeration where\nwe start listing out users.\n\n69\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.010\nEmail addresses, remember we've looked\nat that like using the harvester.\n\n70\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.030\nTheir email address is mike@itprotv\nmost likely their user name is Mike.\n\n71\n00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.380\nSo we can get information that way.\n\n72\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.270\nThen when it comes to getting\nthe passwords, how do we get those?\n\n73\n00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.595\nHow are the bad guys\ngetting our passwords?\n\n74\n00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:45.350\nAnd one method that they would use\nwould be password sniffing, right?\n\n75\n00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.378\nWe've already seen sniffers,\n\n76\n00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:52.040\nwe've talked about packa caps\nutilities like Wireshark, for example.\n\n77\n00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.448\nWell if you're sending your\npassword across the network,\n\n78\n00:03:54.448 --> 00:03:57.010\nit's just like any other packet\nthat's traveling out there.\n\n79\n00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.100\nIf there's a password in there,\n\n80\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.760\nI capture that packet, I can then attempt\nto get the password out of there.\n\n81\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.910\nIf it's a plain text protocol it's\ngoing to show up right in Wireshark.\n\n82\n00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.920\nI'm just going to be able to\nread it right out of there.\n\n83\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.252\nWhich is why we try to avoid\nusing any type of authentication\n\n84\n00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:16.468\nthat transmits credentials in plain text.\n\n85\n00:04:16.468 --> 00:04:18.143\nIt's just not a good idea.\n\n86\n00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:20.580\nLike Dan, you got any examples there?\n\n87\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.120\nWhat's something you've,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, plain text, passwords,\n\n88\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.960\nthey get passed through FTP, right.\n\n89\n00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.050\nSo if you're logging into an FTP account.\n\n90\n00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.500\nTelnet is another great one.\n\n91\n00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.740\nThese are typically the ones that you\nwill see as plain text passwords.\n\n92\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.720\nBut if there's any kind of web\nauthentication that doesn't encrypt\n\n93\n00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.290\nthe traffic that's going through it\ncould be inside those packets as well.\n\n94\n00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.320\nYou always wanna use,\n\n95\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.740\nany time authentication is being passed,\nyou typically always want to.\n\n96\n00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.270\nI'll go out on a climb and\nsay, not typically,\n\n97\n00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.160\nyou definitely always want to\nuse some form of encryption.\n\n98\n00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.610\nSome form of encoding so\n\n99\n00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.530\nthat It can't just be looked at\nthrough something like Wireshark.\n\n100\n00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean you're just making it\nway too easy for the bad guys, right.\n\n101\n00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.040\nSo we're going to avoid that.\n\n102\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.360\nAnd as Daniel said, great examples there.\n\n103\n00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.375\nFTP, if you're not doing secure FTP\nthat's going to send it in plain text.\n\n104\n00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:10.300\nTelnet, that's why we try\nto avoid that nowadays.\n\n105\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.360\nCuz it's plain text.\n\n106\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.980\nAnd if I'm a user on the network and\nDaniel's an administrator and\n\n107\n00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.970\nhe's Telnetting into some\nserver to remotely manage it.\n\n108\n00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.360\nIf I'm running Wireshark,\nI can capture those credentials and\n\n109\n00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.520\nnow I can authenticate as Daniel.\n\n110\n00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.040\nSo never a good idea to use plain text.\n\n111\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.510\nWe wanna make sure that\nwe're using something.\n\n112\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.631\nWhat about your developers?\n\n113\n00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:32.280\nYou develop a web app for\ninternal use or external use.\n\n114\n00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.800\nThey might simply put an HTML form out\nthere and let you type in username and\n\n115\n00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.490\npassword and submit it back to\nthe server for authentication.\n\n116\n00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.970\nAnd a little database and to use any\ntype of encryption in that transmission.\n\n117\n00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.610\nSo sniffing definitely a big part\nof it and any of your sniffers.\n\n118\n00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.094\nIt doesn't have to be anything in\nparticular because we're just grabbing\n\n119\n00:05:52.094 --> 00:05:53.042\nthose raw packets.\n\n120\n00:05:53.042 --> 00:05:57.979\nSo Wireshark, there are some that look\nspecifically for authentication packets,\n\n121\n00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.480\nwhich can be handy.\n\n122\n00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.220\nYou know, you can fire up,\nI'm trying to think of a good example.\n\n123\n00:06:07.275 --> 00:06:08.415\nNow, of course, I'm drawing a blank.\n\n124\n00:06:08.415 --> 00:06:12.165\nBut there are some sniffers\nwhere you can configure them so\n\n125\n00:06:12.165 --> 00:06:14.375\nthat they're just looking for\nauthentication packets.\n\n126\n00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:17.655\nThey'll ignore HTTP packets and\nthose kinds of things.\n\n127\n00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:19.195\nWe don't care about those at this point.\n\n128\n00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:20.745\nI'm just looking for authentication.\n\n129\n00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:23.465\nMakes it easier, that way you don't\nhave to filter your results and find it.\n\n130\n00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:26.840\nIt just says I'm only gonna\nlook at authentication.\n\n131\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.040\nSo sniffing is one.\n\n132\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.460\nKeep in mind, if I'm gonna sniff,\nI've got to be in the network somehow.\n\n133\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.980\nSo maybe I already\ncompromised a machine and\n\n134\n00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.720\nnow I'm trying to escalate my credentials.\n\n135\n00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.970\nBecause I was able to social engineer\na password out of a user and\n\n136\n00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.510\nI can authenticate as them but\nthey're just a standard user.\n\n137\n00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.440\nThey don't have any administrative access.\n\n138\n00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.850\nBut now I can get into the network.\n\n139\n00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.110\nI can authenticate as them and\npotentially,\n\n140\n00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.830\nif I'm compromised the machine in there,\nrun a sniffer from the inside and\n\n141\n00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.820\ntry to capture that traffic.\n\n142\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.450\nThat's the big thing about sniffing.\n\n143\n00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.020\nKeep that in mind.\n\n144\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.090\nWe've talked about it.\n\n145\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.860\nWe talked about packet capture.\n\n146\n00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.661\nYou gotta be able to see\nthat traffic to capture it.\n\n147\n00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:03.338\nAnd if you're on a switched\nethernet that can be a challenge or\n\n148\n00:07:03.338 --> 00:07:05.870\nsomething that we've got to deal with.\n\n149\n00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.520\nAll right, but what else?\n\n150\n00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.367\nIf they can't capture the traffic, because\nthat's typically an internal thing.\n\n151\n00:07:11.367 --> 00:07:14.260\nAnd unless we're doing some\nkind of web front end.\n\n152\n00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.810\nWhere we've got no\nauthentication on the traffic\n\n153\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.690\nfrom the outside that's authenticating,\nthen they could do that.\n\n154\n00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.630\nBut as far as inside goes sniffing is one.\n\n155\n00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.635\nThe other one would just be\npassword cracking, right?\n\n156\n00:07:26.635 --> 00:07:28.955\nI'm trying to break the password.\n\n157\n00:07:28.955 --> 00:07:33.332\nTrying to, well, yeah,\nthere are no other way to say it.\n\n158\n00:07:33.332 --> 00:07:34.406\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I have to break the password, right.\n\n159\n00:07:34.406 --> 00:07:35.430\n&gt;&gt; Kinda comes down.\n\n160\n00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.988\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so how do we do that?\n\n161\n00:07:36.988 --> 00:07:38.465\nWhat can we do?\n\n162\n00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:39.895\nHow can I break their password?\n\n163\n00:07:39.895 --> 00:07:41.985\nWell, the easiest one.\n\n164\n00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:45.295\nWhen I say easy,\nI don't mean easy as in easy to succeed,\n\n165\n00:07:45.295 --> 00:07:48.670\nbut easy to perform is password guessing.\n\n166\n00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.358\nEasy enough.\n\n167\n00:07:49.358 --> 00:07:52.175\nI just go to the authentication\ndialogue box, and\n\n168\n00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:55.135\nI know his user name is dlowrie so\nI put that in there.\n\n169\n00:07:55.135 --> 00:07:57.400\nAnd then I start typing in passwords and\nhit Enter.\n\n170\n00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.158\nAnd if it works, great,\nif it doesn't Guess something else,\n\n171\n00:08:00.158 --> 00:08:02.199\nthat's what password\nguessing is all about.\n\n172\n00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:07.196\nNow as the bad guys, they can definitely\nmake their odds better by doing,\n\n173\n00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:10.520\nmaybe some social engineering on Daniel.\n\n174\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.210\nI talk to Daniel, I find out what his\nhobbies are, when he was married,\n\n175\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.580\nwhat his dog's name is.\n\n176\n00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.200\nI can get this information out of\nhim just by having conversation.\n\n177\n00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.410\nThat's social engineering.\n\n178\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.780\nGetting him to give up information\nthat maybe he shouldn't be giving up.\n\n179\n00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.780\nAnd then I can use that.\n\n180\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.480\nBecause many people use their\nbirthdays as their password or\n\n181\n00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.690\ntheir first child's name or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n182\n00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.880\nSo I can start doing\nsome educated guesses.\n\n183\n00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.500\nI go into my boss's office, and\nhe's got Tim Tebow posters and\n\n184\n00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.090\nTim Tebow signed footballs.\n\n185\n00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.190\nAnd his dog is named Tebow.\n\n186\n00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.010\nWell, guess what I'm going to guess for\nhis first password?\n\n187\n00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.540\n&gt;&gt; Something to do with Tim Tebow.\n\n188\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.691\n&gt;&gt; Yes right?\nExactly.\n\n189\n00:08:51.691 --> 00:08:53.026\nThat's the idea is,\n\n190\n00:08:53.026 --> 00:08:58.072\nuse information that you can gain that you\nmight have already gained from through\n\n191\n00:08:58.072 --> 00:09:03.060\nyour reconnaissance to try to up your\nodds if you're doing password guessing.\n\n192\n00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.130\nIn the end password guessing is\nnot real efficient, right and\n\n193\n00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.260\ndepending on what information I have,\nthere's a lot of guesses I can do.\n\n194\n00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.430\nFortunately, many people\nuse common passwords,\n\n195\n00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.380\nwords that are found in dictionaries and\n\n196\n00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.560\nwe'll come back to the concept of\nthe dictionary there in just a second.\n\n197\n00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.100\nSo password guessing is a viable option.\n\n198\n00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.760\nAnd if I can get somebody's password\nfrom one place a lot of times they use\n\n199\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.888\nthe same password for multiple places so\nI can try that in the locations.\n\n200\n00:09:30.888 --> 00:09:35.646\nSo password guess, the other thing\nabout password guessing is depending on\n\n201\n00:09:35.646 --> 00:09:40.924\nthe environment, it might not be a great\noption because in most corporations we're\n\n202\n00:09:40.924 --> 00:09:46.007\ngonna have some type of password policy\nin place that includes a lockout policy.\n\n203\n00:09:46.007 --> 00:09:50.900\nAll right, how many failed attempts can\noccur before that account gets locked?\n\n204\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.248\nIn Windows, for example,\nwe can go into our group policy.\n\n205\n00:09:54.248 --> 00:09:59.210\nWe can set our lockout policy and look\nfive attempts, it will lock the account.\n\n206\n00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.520\nAnd then maybe it stays locked for\n30 minutes, or\n\n207\n00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.120\nmaybe it stays locked indefinitely until\nan admin goes back in and unlocks that.\n\n208\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.470\nSo we can control or we can limit and\n\n209\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.930\nreduce our risk to password guessing\nby implementing good policies that\n\n210\n00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.410\nwill not allow repeated guesses over and\nover and over.\n\n211\n00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.930\nDo be careful with those settings though\nif you're working with a password\n\n212\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.420\nlockout policy, you can end up\nmaking more work for yourself.\n\n213\n00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.310\nYou might think, two bad guesses and\nwe're going to lock that account.\n\n214\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.710\nWell, your help desk is\ngonna love you after that,\n\n215\n00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.910\nbecause everybody mistypes\na password now and again, right?\n\n216\n00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:38.820\n&gt;&gt; Even a few times.\n\n217\n00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.130\nI mean, you really have to think\nof something that's reasonable for\n\n218\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.470\nyour users, for your help desk people\nthat are going to be resetting\n\n219\n00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.670\nthe users when they mess that up account.\n\n220\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:54.450\nThis is definitely a point of\ncontention in a lot of organizations.\n\n221\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.830\nThe users never think that\nyou give them enough, and\n\n222\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.310\nthe help desk people are sick of okay,\nyes you have to have.\n\n223\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.280\nAn upper case and a lower case,\nthis and special characters.\n\n224\n00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.650\nIt's got to be this long.\n\n225\n00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.210\nThen, of course,\nthey're going to fat finger that.\n\n226\n00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.040\nIt's a really difficult thing.\n\n227\n00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.010\nDefinitely, it's got to be more than two,\nprobably less than 10.\n\n228\n00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.406\nAnd say, somewhere in the sweet spot,\nI've noticed that around six,\n\n229\n00:11:17.406 --> 00:11:19.281\nseven is usually a pretty good amount.\n\n230\n00:11:19.281 --> 00:11:21.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it will vary,\ndepending on your environment, and\n\n231\n00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:23.969\na lot of our military bases\nhere in the US use three.\n\n232\n00:11:23.969 --> 00:11:28.041\nI would think, and in most corporate\nenvironments, if it's not high security,\n\n233\n00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:31.699\nas Daniel was saying, that might be\na little low, because picture this,\n\n234\n00:11:31.699 --> 00:11:33.672\nif you will, Sicily in 1990, no.\n\n235\n00:11:33.672 --> 00:11:34.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Imagine,\n\n236\n00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.660\nlet's say it's Friday afternoon,\nyou get a little pop up on your\n\n237\n00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.220\ncomputer screen that says,\nhey You need to change your password.\n\n238\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.510\nIt's that time again.\n\n239\n00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.310\nSo it's Friday afternoon.\n\n240\n00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.615\nYou look around your desk, you're like\nall right, I'll use that as my password.\n\n241\n00:11:46.615 --> 00:11:47.947\n[NOISE] You change it.\n\n242\n00:11:47.947 --> 00:11:48.750\nYou go home.\n\n243\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.320\nYou come back in Monday morning.\n\n244\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:50.890\nWhat do you do?\n\n245\n00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.859\nThe first thing you do in type in\nyour old password and it fails.\n\n246\n00:11:53.859 --> 00:11:55.170\nThat's right I changed it on Friday.\n\n247\n00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.900\nWhat did I change it to?\n\n248\n00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.874\nI think it was this.\n\n249\n00:11:57.874 --> 00:11:59.398\n[NOISE] Nope that wasn't it.\n\n250\n00:11:59.398 --> 00:12:01.700\nThat's already two fails.\n\n251\n00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.320\nThe idea is not to keep our\n\n252\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.480\nactual users from working,\nthat's not the end goal of this.\n\n253\n00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.330\nI want my users to be able to log on,\nmake money for my company.\n\n254\n00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.580\nWhat I'm trying to do is\nprevent password guessing.\n\n255\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.440\nSo, setting it too low, all you're gonna\ndo is have people locking at their\n\n256\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.910\naccounts, calling up help desk,\nwe're gonna lose productivity.\n\n257\n00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.660\nSo you gotta find that sweet spot, as\nDaniel was saying, of what works for you.\n\n258\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.774\nWe want our legitimate users to log in.\n\n259\n00:12:29.774 --> 00:12:34.092\nIf you're doing password guessing,\nunless you're some kind of psychic,\n\n260\n00:12:34.092 --> 00:12:37.760\nwhat are the odds of you\ngetting the password right?\n\n261\n00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.780\nOut of the first three tries,\nthe first ten tries, I mean, really.\n\n262\n00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.420\n&gt;&gt; It's probably highly unlikely.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, highly unlikely, right?\n\n263\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.790\nSo, and even if you're doing\nsome automated tool, still,\n\n264\n00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.780\nnot gonna get it within\nthe first five tries.\n\n265\n00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.930\nSo, that lets your users have a few\nstrikes before they get locked out, and\n\n266\n00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.510\nit still keeps the bad\nguys from being able\n\n267\n00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:00.650\nto rifle off thousands of guesses per\nsecond, and try to attack that password.\n\n268\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.830\nSo use your policies, set that number\naccordingly to your environment, so\n\n269\n00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.670\nthat would be password guessing.\n\n270\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:12.060\nOther methods that they can use to\nbreak passwords would be brute forcing.\n\n271\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.700\nA brute force password attack means\nI'm going to try every possible\n\n272\n00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.180\ncombination of letter, number, and special\ncharacter until I find your password.\n\n273\n00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.400\nSo what that means is,\nif you really think about it,\n\n274\n00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.940\nit means that all passwords are crackable.\n\n275\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.950\nNow I probably get all kinds of flame,\nand messages on that,\n\n276\n00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.930\nbut in the end if you think but\nnothing else in consideration.\n\n277\n00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:43.040\nAll passwords are crackable\nbecause a password is nothing more\n\n278\n00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.060\nthan a string of characters.\n\n279\n00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.380\nAnd if I can figure out that\nstring I can put it in there.\n\n280\n00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.700\nAnd given enough time and\nresources I can figure it out\n\n281\n00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:55.710\nbecause brute force says I'm gonna try\nevery possible combination, aaaaaaa.\n\n282\n00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.560\nAaaaaab.\n\n283\n00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.210\nAll the way through every\npossible combination.\n\n284\n00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.060\nNow that might be\nmillions of combinations.\n\n285\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.690\nBut if I'm using a system that can fire\noff thousands of guesses per second,\n\n286\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.000\nit starts to shorten that time down.\n\n287\n00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.270\nAnd the idea is our passwords need to\nbe strong enough to last through our\n\n288\n00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.520\npassword policy.\n\n289\n00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.550\nThey don't have to be uncrackable,\nbecause you can't, right?\n\n290\n00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.560\nBut they do need to be strong enough\nto where if a bad guy is trying to do\n\n291\n00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.460\nbrute forcing, if he's going to go\nthrough every possible combination,\n\n292\n00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.890\nit's going to take him 10,000 years,\nright?\n\n293\n00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.140\nSo the odds are likely that\nhe's not gonna succeed in that.\n\n294\n00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.690\nEven then though, keep in mind that\nthere's no guarantee that if they don't\n\n295\n00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.960\nget it on the first guess, right?\n\n296\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.760\nOr the tenth guess, or\n\n297\n00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.380\nthe hundredth guess, if your not saying\nit's gonna be on the millionth guess.\n\n298\n00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.065\n&gt;&gt; I made my password Aaaaaaaa.\n\n299\n00:14:45.065 --> 00:14:47.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was sufficient length,\n\n300\n00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.230\none was uppercase.\n\n301\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.680\nAnd what's the problem here?\n\n302\n00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n303\n00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.800\nSo as the bad guys what they're trying\nto do is figure out what your password\n\n304\n00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.780\npolicy is.\n\n305\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.590\nDo you have complexity enabled?\n\n306\n00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.050\nDo you require uppercase and lowercase and\nnumbers and special characters?\n\n307\n00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.350\nCuz if a bad guy can limit that, if I know\nthat that user is only using uppercase and\n\n308\n00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.870\nlowercase letters in their password,\nI can eliminate a lot of the guesses.\n\n309\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.400\nAnd now my brute forcing is\ngonna take a lot less time.\n\n310\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.080\nSo that's information\nthe bad guy's trying to glean\n\n311\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.050\nduring that reconnaissance phase\nis what your password policy is.\n\n312\n00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.590\nWe'll talk about\nstrengthening passwords and\n\n313\n00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.640\ngood strong passwords here in a second.\n\n314\n00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.226\nSo brute forcing, again,\nevery single possible combination.\n\n315\n00:15:28.226 --> 00:15:31.640\nWe're just gonna rifle through them\none at a time until we find one\n\n316\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.630\nthat actually works.\n\n317\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.932\nLots of tools we can use to do this,\nCain and Abel, John and the Ripper,\n\n318\n00:15:38.932 --> 00:15:44.450\nLoftcrack, Offcrack, I mean,\nthere are Medusa, there's\n\n319\n00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:48.260\nlots of different password cracking\nutilities that you can go out and get.\n\n320\n00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:53.473\nSome of them free, some of them pay but\nthey all do basically the same thing.\n\n321\n00:15:53.473 --> 00:15:58.755\nYou input as much information as you can,\nlike if you know how long the password is,\n\n322\n00:15:58.755 --> 00:16:03.810\ncuz if it's only five characters I can\nlimit my brute forcing to a five character\n\n323\n00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:08.740\npassword, that reduces the number\nof possibilities exponentially.\n\n324\n00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.470\nSo it's gonna speed up\nmy cracking process.\n\n325\n00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.740\nIf I know what character sets\nare used in those passwords,\n\n326\n00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.590\nI can again, input that information.\n\n327\n00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.760\nSo when we're talking about brute forcing,\nagain,\n\n328\n00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.850\njust gonna try every possible combination.\n\n329\n00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:25.100\nYou can also do kind of\na hybrid of the two.\n\n330\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.860\nThen you got password guessing and\nbrute forcing, where we start doing, or\n\n331\n00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.910\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n332\n00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.070\nLet me come back to the hiybrid,\ncuz it's not guessing,\n\n333\n00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.680\nit's the next one I want to include.\n\n334\n00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.110\nAnd the next one is dictionary attacks.\n\n335\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:43.800\nA dictionary attack is when\nI take a file that has\n\n336\n00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.520\none word on each line, and I'm gonna use\nthose words as your possible passwords.\n\n337\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.770\nRight?\n\n338\n00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:53.190\nSo I get a file, and\nI put one word on each line, and\n\n339\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.350\nI can feed that as input into\nthe password cracking utility.\n\n340\n00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.380\nAnd it's gonna try each one\nof those words one at a time.\n\n341\n00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.756\nYou think, well, how is that gonna work?\n\n342\n00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:07.830\nWell, fortunately for bad guys,\nunfortunately for the security people,\n\n343\n00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:12.170\npeople use words that are found in\ndictionaries that are common words.\n\n344\n00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.990\nAnd so as a bad actor you start\nbuilding up these dictionary files.\n\n345\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.660\nAnd you can go out.\n\n346\n00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.040\nAnd you can use your\nfavorite search engine and\n\n347\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.830\nmost likely find a little\ndictionary file if you want.\n\n348\n00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:23.980\nI have several of them.\n\n349\n00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.380\nI've got the entire Webster's Dictionary.\n\n350\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.710\nIn a text file, right?\n\n351\n00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.940\nSo every word in the Webster's Dictionary,\none on each line.\n\n352\n00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:36.470\nI've got a text file of common names,\nin different languages even.\n\n353\n00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:41.130\nSo you start collecting these up over\ntime and you create your dictionary and\n\n354\n00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.210\nyou might think well how long's\nit gonna take to go through that?\n\n355\n00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.410\nWell if you're doing thousands\nof guesses a second.\n\n356\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.680\nNot that long, right.\n\n357\n00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.020\nAnd if your password's in there,\nyour password is broken now,\n\n358\n00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.010\nbecause it's gonna\neventually get to that one.\n\n359\n00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.310\nAnd I'm gonna show you an example\nof that here in just a minute.\n\n360\n00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.100\nSo dictionary attacks is when\nyou take a dictionary file,\n\n361\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.065\nwhich is just one word on each line,\nand you're using those\n\n362\n00:18:01.065 --> 00:18:05.439\nto as input to your password cracking\nutility to try to guess as passwords.\n\n363\n00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.790\nNow a hybrid, as I alluded to you earlier,\n\n364\n00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:13.980\nis when we kind of combine brute\nforcing and dictionary attacks.\n\n365\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.360\nBecause what a lot of people like to\ndo is append numbers to their name,\n\n366\n00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.600\nright, or to their password I should say.\n\n367\n00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.500\nSo hey, my password was blue,\nI gotta change it.\n\n368\n00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.350\nNow my password's gonna be blue one.\n\n369\n00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.790\nAll right?\nOr something like that.\n\n370\n00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.430\nSo we can do a hybrid,\nwe can do a dictionary attack but\n\n371\n00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.030\nthrow some brute forcing in there.\n\n372\n00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.390\nIt'll go through the entire dictionary\nfile, whatever it is you have, and then\n\n373\n00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.270\nit'll go back through the file appending a\none at the end of each one of those words.\n\n374\n00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.170\nAnd then go back through the file again\nand append a two, or three digits,\n\n375\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.930\nor What's another good example,\ndoing a lead speak, right?\n\n376\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.750\nTake that same dictionary file and\nnow replace all A's with at's and\n\n377\n00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:52.930\ntry it again.\n\n378\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.140\nSo if you think your password's safe\njust because you're swapping a couple\n\n379\n00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.660\ncharacters there, an E for a three or\nwhat have you No, it's not.\n\n380\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.530\nIt's still good you should do it, but\nit's not gonna keep you 100% safe.\n\n381\n00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:10.510\n&gt;&gt; So interesting thing, and I was looking\nover what strong passwords are recently.\n\n382\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.240\nThe funny thing is,\nwhen it comes to brute forcing\n\n383\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.790\nas long as you have a sufficiently\nlong password, It becomes uncrackable.\n\n384\n00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.800\nYou don't have to add extra special\ncharacters and numbers and all this.\n\n385\n00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.940\nAs it can be all lower case,\nas long as it's long enough,\n\n386\n00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.960\nit will take forever and a day.\n\n387\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.740\nAnd it's unlikely anyone\nwill ever crack that.\n\n388\n00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.750\nBut that doesn't protect\nagainst dictionary attacks.\n\n389\n00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.930\nDictionary attacks,\nit can be 100 characters long,\n\n390\n00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:38.230\nif it's in that dictionary, it's gonna\nhit it, and you're gonna get taken down.\n\n391\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:43.770\nSo you have to think of both things in\nyour mind of creating a strong password.\n\n392\n00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:47.960\nIt needs to be sufficiently long and it\ndoes also need to have special characters,\n\n393\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.650\nnumbers, things of that\nnature to change things up so\n\n394\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.290\nthat you can protect against\nboth of those type of attacks.\n\n395\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.450\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, length,\nas Daniel pointed out very well,\n\n396\n00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.090\nlength is a big part of\nthe strength of your password.\n\n397\n00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.020\nHere's a quick example.\n\n398\n00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.100\nLet's say that our passwords are binary so\n\n399\n00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.380\nthere's only two possibilities per digit,\nright?\n\n400\n00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:06.950\nA 0 or a 1.\n\n401\n00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.670\nWell, if I have a three\ncharacter password and\n\n402\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.060\nit's in binary, how many possible\npasswords can I come up with?\n\n403\n00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.690\nTwo to the third, 2 times 2 is 4.\n\n404\n00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:19.735\nTimes 2 is 8, so there's eight possible\npasswords I could come up with.\n\n405\n00:20:19.735 --> 00:20:20.605\nZero, zero, zero.\n\n406\n00:20:20.605 --> 00:20:22.385\nZero, zero, one.\n\n407\n00:20:22.385 --> 00:20:23.965\nZero, one, zero, one, zero.\n\n408\n00:20:23.965 --> 00:20:25.555\nI could go through all of them,\nyou guys get the idea.\n\n409\n00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:29.655\nSo there's eight possible passwords\nwith a three character binary password.\n\n410\n00:20:29.655 --> 00:20:33.855\nAdd one character, let's say we'll\ndo a four character binary password.\n\n411\n00:20:33.855 --> 00:20:36.830\nSo does the number of possibilities\ngo from eight to nine?\n\n412\n00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:41.140\nNow, two to the fourth, 2 times 2 is 4,\ntimes 2 is 8, times 2 is 16.\n\n413\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.250\nSo by adding one character I double\nthe number of possibilities for\n\n414\n00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.980\nthat password, right?\n\n415\n00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.050\nAnd that's what we're trying to do,\n\n416\n00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.820\nis increase the overall\nnumber of possibilities.\n\n417\n00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.350\nWhen we look at our passwords we're\nusing letters and numbers and\n\n418\n00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.610\nspecial characters.\n\n419\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:01.050\nIf I'm only using letters is 26 lower\ncase less than English language.\n\n420\n00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.946\nSo if they had a three password,\n\n421\n00:21:03.946 --> 00:21:08.679\nthree character password,\nit would be a what 26?\n\n422\n00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:12.310\nNo, it would be 26 to the third,\nall right.\n\n423\n00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.380\nIf you, I dont\n\n424\n00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.760\nknow what that number is by heart\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n425\n00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.410\n&gt;&gt; But if you, yes, it's big.\n\n426\n00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.870\nBut if you add one character\nnow it is 26 to the fourth.\n\n427\n00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:23.980\nSo you've multiplied the results\nof the last one by 26 basically.\n\n428\n00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.340\nSo you are increasing it\nexponentially each character you add.\n\n429\n00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.785\nSo going from a seven character\npassword to an eight character\n\n430\n00:21:30.785 --> 00:21:34.510\npassword increases the number\nof possibilities exponentially.\n\n431\n00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.870\nThen if you add complexity into it\n\n432\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:42.420\nyou're increasing the number of\npossibilities per character.\n\n433\n00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.550\nThat's really what we're doing.\n\n434\n00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.840\nThe length is the number\nof possibilities overall.\n\n435\n00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.260\nThe character sets the number\nof possibilities per character.\n\n436\n00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.550\nI was saying if it's just lowercase,\n26 to the third.\n\n437\n00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.930\nBut if you're using uppercase and\nlowercase, now we're up to 52.\n\n438\n00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.670\nYou add in numbers and special characters,\nthere's 10 numbers, zero through nine.\n\n439\n00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.710\nAnd there's 32 special characters, so\nnow we're up to somewhere around 96.\n\n440\n00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:09.820\nSo now it's 96 to the third\ninstead of 26 to the third.\n\n441\n00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.450\nRight?\n\n442\n00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.590\nBig, big difference in\nthe number of possibilities.\n\n443\n00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:17.140\nSo yes, long, long is good but\nyou've gotta make it complex also\n\n444\n00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.070\nto increase the number of\npossibilities per character.\n\n445\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.060\n&gt;&gt; But Mike, I have such a hard time\ncoming up with a long password.\n\n446\n00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.700\nWhat ever will I do?\n\n447\n00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.580\n&gt;&gt; There's lots of methods you can use\nto come up with good, strong passwords.\n\n448\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.210\nPass phrases are really good\nbecause they're gonna be long,\n\n449\n00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.460\njust because it's a phrase and\nnot a single word.\n\n450\n00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:40.700\nI have heard methods of like,\ntake your favorite lyric from a song and\n\n451\n00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.620\ndo the first and\nlast character of every word.\n\n452\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.300\nOr the first letter of every word,\nor something like that.\n\n453\n00:22:47.505 --> 00:22:49.615\nBut many different methods\nyou could use to generate.\n\n454\n00:22:49.615 --> 00:22:51.745\nAnd you can use password generators too,\n\n455\n00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:55.565\nwhich come up with random strings\nof letters if you let them.\n\n456\n00:22:55.565 --> 00:22:58.045\nAnyway, this is not a class about\nmaking strong passwords, so\n\n457\n00:22:58.045 --> 00:22:59.065\nwe'll get back to the point.\n\n458\n00:22:59.065 --> 00:23:00.585\nHow do we crack these passwords?\n\n459\n00:23:01.625 --> 00:23:05.275\nWe talked about password guessing,\nwe talked about brute forcing,\n\n460\n00:23:05.275 --> 00:23:07.215\nwe talked about dictionary attacks.\n\n461\n00:23:07.215 --> 00:23:11.320\nThe last one I wanna talk about\nis going to be rainbow tables.\n\n462\n00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.380\nAll right.\n\n463\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.230\nWhen we store passwords most of\nthe password databases they're gonna\n\n464\n00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.410\nstore them in an encrypted format\nthey're not juts talking your password,\n\n465\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.980\nand storing it in that database.\n\n466\n00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.490\nThey're running it through what's\ncalled a hashing algorithm.\n\n467\n00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:29.950\nGenerating a hash value, which is\nan encrypted version of your password.\n\n468\n00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:33.150\nAnd the cool thing about hash values or\nhashing algorithms.\n\n469\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:37.410\nThe output there, that hash value,\nis unreversible, right?\n\n470\n00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.540\nHashes, hashing algorithms,\nare one-way encryption.\n\n471\n00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.820\nIn other words, once I've encrypted\nthat password using the hash value,\n\n472\n00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.785\nif somebody steals that hash value.\n\n473\n00:23:45.785 --> 00:23:48.975\nThey're not gonna be able to\nreverse engineer the encryption and\n\n474\n00:23:48.975 --> 00:23:50.779\nget the original password back out.\n\n475\n00:23:50.779 --> 00:23:57.357\nThat's just the way hashes work because\nthey have a fixed length output.\n\n476\n00:23:57.357 --> 00:24:02.947\nIt's not gonna be reversible I shouldn't\nsay it's not possible, but it's very,\n\n477\n00:24:02.947 --> 00:24:08.871\nvery, very unlikely that you could reverse\nthat, and that's what makes Azure so good.\n\n478\n00:24:08.871 --> 00:24:14.026\nBut, what I can do, because of the fact\nthat it's a fixed length output, right,\n\n479\n00:24:14.026 --> 00:24:18.807\nin other words, I can take, if I've\ngot hashing algorithm, and I take four\n\n480\n00:24:18.807 --> 00:24:23.963\ncharacters, let's say the word blue, and\nI put it into this hashing algorithm,\n\n481\n00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:28.671\nthat hashing algorithm, it might\noutput a 256 bit string, but if I take\n\n482\n00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:33.505\na whole sentence and put it through there,\nthe output is still 256 bits.\n\n483\n00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:36.527\nThat's the algorithm itself defines that,\n\n484\n00:24:36.527 --> 00:24:41.618\nwhich means there's not a one-on-one\nrelationship between the input and\n\n485\n00:24:41.618 --> 00:24:46.251\nthe output, in other words,\nthere's going to be some collisions.\n\n486\n00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:50.751\nThat means more than one input could end\nup generating the same output in this\n\n487\n00:24:50.751 --> 00:24:54.549\nhashing algorithm, and\nthat's where rainbow tables come in,\n\n488\n00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:59.541\nbecause what I need to authenticate it's\nyou is not your password, I need something\n\n489\n00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:04.534\nthat's gonna generate the same hash value\nas your password did when it was encrypted\n\n490\n00:25:04.534 --> 00:25:08.863\nbecause in the account database,\nit's the hash value that's stored.\n\n491\n00:25:08.863 --> 00:25:11.824\nSo, if whatever I put in\nthe authentication box,\n\n492\n00:25:11.824 --> 00:25:16.408\ngets run through the hashing algorithm and\ngenerates a matching hash value,\n\n493\n00:25:16.408 --> 00:25:20.428\nit's gonna assume that I must have\ninputed the right information,\n\n494\n00:25:20.428 --> 00:25:24.966\nbecause the right output came out,\nand so it's gonna let me authenticate.\n\n495\n00:25:24.966 --> 00:25:26.987\nI don't need to know your password,\n\n496\n00:25:26.987 --> 00:25:30.322\nI need to know something that\ngenerates the same hash value.\n\n497\n00:25:30.322 --> 00:25:33.715\nSo what rainbow tables are,\nis where somebody has sat and\n\n498\n00:25:33.715 --> 00:25:36.827\njust started running\neverything they can think of,\n\n499\n00:25:36.827 --> 00:25:40.518\nthrough the hashing algorithm,\nand generating the output.\n\n500\n00:25:40.518 --> 00:25:44.796\nSo now what I can do, is I can,\nhere's Daniel's hash for his password,\n\n501\n00:25:44.796 --> 00:25:49.638\nmaybe I captured it as it was traveling\nacross the network, they were doing good,\n\n502\n00:25:49.638 --> 00:25:53.737\nthey encrypted it, it's not plain text,\nbut I got that hash value.\n\n503\n00:25:53.737 --> 00:25:57.433\nNow I can go to the rainbow table,\nand I can look that hash value up,\n\n504\n00:25:57.433 --> 00:26:01.459\nI can find a match for that hash value,\nand then, for the rainbow table,\n\n505\n00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:05.096\nit's going to tell me what they\nused to generate that hash value.\n\n506\n00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:08.725\nNow I can turn around and use that\nto authenticate as you, all right?\n\n507\n00:26:08.725 --> 00:26:15.329\nThat's the way rainbow tables work,\nthey are losing their effectiveness as\n\n508\n00:26:15.329 --> 00:26:21.422\nwe go with more Better hashing algorithms,\nright?\n\n509\n00:26:21.422 --> 00:26:25.335\nBecause as we get into,\nI don't know, SHA-512, or\n\n510\n00:26:25.335 --> 00:26:28.567\na higher hashing algorithms-\n&gt;&gt; There's a new one called Tiger.\n\n511\n00:26:28.567 --> 00:26:29.386\n&gt;&gt; Tiger?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n512\n00:26:29.386 --> 00:26:31.104\n&gt;&gt; What's the output on that?\n\n513\n00:26:31.104 --> 00:26:33.496\n&gt;&gt; I don't know the output,\nI just read about it the other day and\n\n514\n00:26:33.496 --> 00:26:35.488\nthey said there are no\nknown vulnerabilities yet.\n\n515\n00:26:35.488 --> 00:26:36.460\n&gt;&gt; Yet.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n516\n00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.244\n&gt;&gt; Because what happens is,\n\n517\n00:26:38.244 --> 00:26:43.272\nif the output string is long enough,\nsufficiently long enough, right,\n\n518\n00:26:43.272 --> 00:26:48.219\nthen I cannot generate a table big\nenough to create all the possibilities\n\n519\n00:26:48.219 --> 00:26:52.618\nto get all the possible hash values,\nthat becomes the problem.\n\n520\n00:26:52.618 --> 00:26:57.371\nSo with some of our older hashing\nalgorithms, like MD5, it was a small\n\n521\n00:26:57.371 --> 00:27:02.600\nenough, I don't wanna say key space, but\nit was small enough to where we could\n\n522\n00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:08.171\ngenerate enough hash values to be able to\nuse that to effectively crack a password.\n\n523\n00:27:08.171 --> 00:27:11.880\nSo as those get better,\nrainbow tables will be less efficient, but\n\n524\n00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.371\nthen what happens is computers become\nmore powerful, we can make bigger tables,\n\n525\n00:27:16.371 --> 00:27:19.364\nwe can store more,\nwe can search through it faster, so\n\n526\n00:27:19.364 --> 00:27:23.360\nthen maybe it does become a little\nmore useful at some point, all right?\n\n527\n00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.815\nSo a lot of different techniques\nthey can use to crack the password,\n\n528\n00:27:26.815 --> 00:27:30.993\nI'm gonna show you an example, when we\ncome back, of using a brute force tool, or\n\n529\n00:27:30.993 --> 00:27:35.019\nactually we'll do a dictionary attack,\nI think, to try to crack a password.\n\n530\n00:27:35.019 --> 00:27:40.030\nBut we've got sniffing the password,\nwe've got brute forcing the password,\n\n531\n00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:44.443\nwe've got rainbow tables and\nwe've got our dictionary attacks, and\n\n532\n00:27:44.443 --> 00:27:47.830\nall different methods we can\nuse to break a password.\n\n533\n00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.162\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, that sounds awesome,\nI do look forward to the part twos that we\n\n534\n00:27:51.162 --> 00:27:53.866\ndo around here, cuz they're\nusually full of fun and adventure.\n\n535\n00:27:53.866 --> 00:27:57.526\nHopefully, you'll look forward to that as\nwell, but it does look like we are well\n\n536\n00:27:57.526 --> 00:28:00.091\nout of time for this episode,\nso we'll have to sign off.\n\n537\n00:28:00.091 --> 00:28:02.698\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n538\n00:28:02.698 -->

00:00:12.560\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.000\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.280\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.030\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.070\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with more on our CFR series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.090\nAnd joining us back in the studio,\nthe man, the myth, the legend.\n\n9\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.660\nYou know him as Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.710\nMike, welcome back man.\n\n11\n00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.270\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.580\n&gt;&gt; It's going fantastic.\n\n13\n00:00:29.580 -->

responder.\n\n16\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.190\nAnd we've been moving, kinda progressing\nalong again through that attacking,\n\n17\n00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.190\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n18\n00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.690\n&gt;&gt; Methodology.\n\n19\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my methodology,\nthank you, very much.\n\n20\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.540\nThat hacker methodology cuz, we talked\nabout being, as a security professional,\n\n21\n00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.650\nwe have to understand how they think,\nhow they act, so\n\n22\n00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.890\nwe can examine our own networks and\nmake sure we're defended against it.\n\n23\n00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.030\nAnd maybe we wanna do penetration testing,\nwhat have you.\n\n24\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.030\nOr working for an organization,\nand we are the security people.\n\n25\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.700\nSo, we've looked at foot printing,\nwe've looked at scanning, we've looked at,\n\n26\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.340\nthe previous episode,\nwe looked at cracking a password, right?\n\n27\n00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.530\nAnd so at this point, we're ready to\nstart gaining access to the system.\n\n28\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.010\nWe've got our map of the network.\n\n29\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.380\nWe know the targets we wanna get to.\n\n30\n00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.040\nWe know what services they're running\nthrough the scanning and the numeration.\n\n31\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.340\nWe've got user accounts, then we're\nusing our password cracking tools.\n\n32\n00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.160\nWe're able to crack a password.\n\n33\n00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160\nNow, we can try to gain\naccess to the system.\n\n34\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.250\nAnd what we're gonna use in this one is,\n\n35\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.800\nwe're gonna take a look at what's called\nexploit or exploitation frameworks, right?\n\n36\n00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.080\nThese are, a framework,\nan exploit framework is a basically,\n\n37\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.630\njust an environment that we can go into\nand create and execute code, right?\n\n38\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.076\nExploit code to be specific.\n\n39\n00:01:56.076 --> 00:01:58.610\nAs a, how should I say?\n\n40\n00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.580\nThe vulnerabilities that we're looking at,\nthat we're finding, these are known.\n\n41\n00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.420\nThere's known ways to compromise those.\n\n42\n00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.420\nPeople have written the framework for\n\n43\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.806\nthe exploit to take advantage\nof those vulnerabilities.\n\n44\n00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:15.910\nSo we can undo is use these\nframeworks to find an exploit\n\n45\n00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.470\nthat we're gonna be able to use against\nthe vulnerability that we've found.\n\n46\n00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.620\nUsually, you have to tweak\nthat exploit a little bit.\n\n47\n00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.990\nIt's not like you can just go grab it,\nrun it, and be done with it in most cases.\n\n48\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.090\nSometimes you can, though.\n\n49\n00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.930\nYou'll have to maybe modify the code,\nor change just some values\n\n50\n00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.520\nin there before it'll work, and then of\ncourse, generate your payload that you're\n\n51\n00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.970\ngoing to actually deliver when\nyou exploit that vulnerability.\n\n52\n00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.180\nSo, as far as exploitation frameworks go,\nmetasploit is probably one of the biggest,\n\n53\n00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.580\nI won't say the biggest,\nit's one that a lot of people know about.\n\n54\n00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.550\nSo it's a very common one to use.\n\n55\n00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.730\nThe great thing about\nMetasploit is it's open source,\n\n56\n00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.290\nwhich means I don't have to pay to use it.\n\n57\n00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.970\nYou get a Linux distribution like\n\n58\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.950\nKali Linux that already has\nMetasploit framework loaded up.\n\n59\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.180\nYou can load it up onto anything else.\n\n60\n00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.400\nBut it's easy enough just to go\nfind a distro that already has it,\n\n61\n00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.000\nfire it up and you start using it.\n\n62\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.510\nSo it's open source.\n\n63\n00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.320\nAnother cool thing about\nthings like Metasploit\n\n64\n00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.560\nis that it will tie in with other tools.\n\n65\n00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.040\nNow we can use it along with Endmap for\nexample to kinda do our scan and\n\n66\n00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.900\nthen if it finds something, maybe\nlaunch an attack, or Nessus or Nexpose.\n\n67\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.100\nSome of our vulnerability scanners\nthat we can kinda tie in with this.\n\n68\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.660\nSo it is neat that we can almost\nlike using plugins for it, but\n\n69\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.820\nbecause it's open source,\npeople can do that.\n\n70\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.945\nWe can write code that'll allow us to\nstart combining some of these tools.\n\n71\n00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:44.103\nThere are others though,\n\n72\n00:03:44.103 --> 00:03:46.845\nthere are some proprietary ones\nlike core impact is a big one.\n\n73\n00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:51.087\nIt's, I forget,\ncore security is the group that\n\n74\n00:03:51.087 --> 00:03:55.135\ndeveloped core impact but\nit's proprietary.\n\n75\n00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:58.145\nIt means you have to pay for\nit, it's very, very robust.\n\n76\n00:03:58.145 --> 00:04:01.635\nNot only is it in exploit framework,\nbut it 'll do recognizance,\n\n77\n00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:05.560\nit'll do scanning and\nvery robust reporting capabilities.\n\n78\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.370\nWhich is a penetration tester,\nor as a security personnel for\n\n79\n00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.680\nyour company might be\nvery important to you.\n\n80\n00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.160\nSo that I can turn around and\n\n81\n00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.550\ngo to that meeting with the C level\nexecutives and show what I've found,\n\n82\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.870\nand where we need to spend our money, or\nwhat we need to do to secure our systems.\n\n83\n00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.350\nSo having that deliverable\ncan be very important to us.\n\n84\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.560\n&gt;&gt; Mike, when would you say would be the\nturning point of when I would say okay,\n\n85\n00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.970\nwe're using Metasploits for\neach great It works very well.\n\n86\n00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.030\nBut now, I'm thinking we might wanna\nspend some money on a proprietary thing\n\n87\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.840\nlike core Impact.\n\n88\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've got to reach in here.\n\n89\n00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.880\nAnd you've got to see\nhow deep that wall is.\n\n90\n00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.263\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When it comes down to that.\n\n91\n00:04:39.263 --> 00:04:40.419\nThere's a little bit more than that,\nright?\n\n92\n00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.644\nWith a paid product like that,\nyou're gonna get a very refined product.\n\n93\n00:04:44.644 --> 00:04:49.122\nMostly likely relatively easy to use.\n\n94\n00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.590\nProbably, menu driven, easy to work with.\n\n95\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.260\nSupport is another big thing.\n\n96\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.790\nYou'll get support from them\ncuz you've purchased it so\n\n97\n00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.810\nthey will help you,\nusually most companies will do that.\n\n98\n00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.240\nSo, that would be the thing, if your\nbudget will allow it, first of all.\n\n99\n00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.230\nAnd then, do you need that level?\n\n100\n00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.080\nDo you need all those\nreporting capabilities?\n\n101\n00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.220\nDo you need all those\nscanning capabilities?\n\n102\n00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.918\nDo you need that support\nthat goes with it?\n\n103\n00:05:13.918 --> 00:05:19.620\nCuz Metasploit is open source and there's\nlots of documentation out there online but\n\n104\n00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.440\nyou can't call a number and\nsay hey, this isn't working for me.\n\n105\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.050\nWhat should I do?\n\n106\n00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.250\nYou can get into forums, and\nyou can talk to people, and\n\n107\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.090\ntry to work out your problem that way.\n\n108\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.229\nBut you're not gonna have like\nan easy phone number to call.\n\n109\n00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.241\n&gt;&gt; Plus I've noticed that in the security\ncommunity, when you starting going,\n\n110\n00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:38.767\nI'm trying to use Metasploit to\nbreak into this Linux server running\n\n111\n00:05:38.767 --> 00:05:41.707\na patchy version 4.4 with\nPHP this that and the other.\n\n112\n00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:44.700\nThey're go, why are you doing that?\n\n113\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.330\nWhat's the purpose?\n\n114\n00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.710\nWell, if you have a paid for product,\nI would assume that if you call support\n\n115\n00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.180\nyou've got the support number and they\nrealize you're a legit business and you're\n\n116\n00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.460\nprobably doing some sort of security\nvulnerability, penetration testing.\n\n117\n00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.950\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n118\n00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.670\nNot just some wingnut that,\nsaying hey look,\n\n119\n00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.920\nI swear that this is my system that I'm\ntrying to recover the password for.\n\n120\n00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.790\nCan you help me please?\n\n121\n00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.240\nSo yeah.\nBut core impact,\n\n122\n00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.541\nthat's gonna cost you tens of thousands\nof dollars for the licensing for that.\n\n123\n00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:14.118\nSo you've gotta, you and\nyour organization, have to make that\n\n124\n00:06:14.118 --> 00:06:18.624\ndetermination looking at risk and you're\ndoing a risk analysis, and looking at\n\n125\n00:06:18.624 --> 00:06:22.689\nthe cost benefit or the cost analysis\nof purchasing a product like that.\n\n126\n00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:23.397\nWhat are we gonna get out of it?\n\n127\n00:06:23.397 --> 00:06:27.730\nWhat's it gonna save us in the long run,\nis it worth that money?\n\n128\n00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.740\nAnd for\nmany organizations the answer is yes.\n\n129\n00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.292\n&gt;&gt; Like if you're\na penetration testing service.\n\n130\n00:06:31.292 --> 00:06:32.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that would\n\n131\n00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.260\nbe very nice, right?\n\n132\n00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.920\n&gt;&gt; Probably wanna buy that.\n\n133\n00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.170\n&gt;&gt; There's others, there's Canvas\nis another one made by Immunity.\n\n134\n00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.430\nIt's another proprietary framework, so\nit is something that you have to license.\n\n135\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.380\nThis one's in the thousands of dollars\nrather than the tens of thousands of\n\n136\n00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.310\ndollars, but it's also not as robust\nas something like Core Impact.\n\n137\n00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.667\nAnd it doesn't have the same level of\nreconnaissance and scanning capabilities.\n\n138\n00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:57.774\nIt doesn't do the reporting\nnearly as well as a Core Impact.\n\n139\n00:06:57.774 --> 00:07:00.694\nGreat product, and\nif that's all your budget allows,\n\n140\n00:07:00.694 --> 00:07:03.040\nthen it'll probably be perfect for you.\n\n141\n00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.840\nYou definitely don't wanna think\nI'm saying it's a bad product,\n\n142\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.920\nit's just not as feature rich as\nmaybe something like Core Impact.\n\n143\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.870\nBut again, that's your\norganization making that decision.\n\n144\n00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.320\nWe can't spends tens of thousands\nof dollars on a project but\n\n145\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.020\nwe need something and\nCanvas is really good.\n\n146\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.070\nWe just don't get that reporting maybe,\nbut we're okay with that.\n\n147\n00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.030\nAs long as it does what it's supposed\nto do very well, and Canvas does.\n\n148\n00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.150\nIt's a great exploit framework.\n\n149\n00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.420\n&gt;&gt; I like how you put that, Mike.\n\n150\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.040\nIt's necessarily that one is necessarily\nbetter than the other per say.\n\n151\n00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.590\nIt's just one might be\na little easier to use,\n\n152\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.410\none might have a little more features.\n\n153\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.570\nIf you're willing to spend the time and\n\n154\n00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.720\neffort into jumping into Metasploit,\nMetasploit can do a lot for you.\n\n155\n00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.867\nMetasploit can find a lot\nof vulnerabilities and\n\n156\n00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:47.131\nhelp you penetration test.\n\n157\n00:07:47.131 --> 00:07:51.426\nIt's used by penetration testers,\nto but they spent the time.\n\n158\n00:07:51.426 --> 00:07:53.853\nThey know exactly how the product works,\nthe ins and\n\n159\n00:07:53.853 --> 00:07:56.114\nouts, all the cool little features and\nbells and\n\n160\n00:07:56.114 --> 00:07:59.449\nwhistles that might be a little more\ndifficult from just first glance.\n\n161\n00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:03.481\nThey've had to really dig into it So\ndon't think just because it's free or\n\n162\n00:08:03.481 --> 00:08:07.082\nit's not as much money that\nit's not as good of a product.\n\n163\n00:08:07.082 --> 00:08:08.870\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, now I can go out and\n\n164\n00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.072\nget that Lamborghini Aventador or\nI can get that smart car.\n\n165\n00:08:13.072 --> 00:08:14.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry,\n\n166\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.160\nanyone that has a smart car I apologize.\n\n167\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.910\nThat didn't mean to come out-\n&gt;&gt; As you laugh in their face.\n\n168\n00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.640\n&gt;&gt; But I just can't say\nsmart car without laughing.\n\n169\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.190\nI usually point at them as they go by.\n\n170\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:22.860\nNo [LAUGH].\n\n171\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.590\n&gt;&gt; There's the death trap.\n\n172\n00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n173\n00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.960\nBoth will get you from A to B just fine,\nand protect you from the elements and\n\n174\n00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.410\nall of that, right?\n\n175\n00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.930\nOne does it with a little more class and\nspeed than the other, but\n\n176\n00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.870\nyou also paid a lot more.\n\n177\n00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.380\nYou could've bought 100 of those\nsmart cars probably what you paid for\n\n178\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.780\nthat Aventador.\n\n179\n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.010\nAll right, so you get the idea there.\n\n180\n00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.070\nAnd those aren't all of them and\n\n181\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.610\nI haven't come close to listing\nall the different frameworks.\n\n182\n00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.994\nBeef is another one that\nI just like the name.\n\n183\n00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:49.757\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The browser exploit framework,\n\n184\n00:08:49.757 --> 00:08:53.784\nthere's another one that you can get into,\nthat one is actually, if I'm not mistaken,\n\n185\n00:08:53.784 --> 00:08:55.820\nthat one's open source as well.\n\n186\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.812\nYou can usually get that\nin distros like Kali Linux.\n\n187\n00:08:58.812 --> 00:09:03.463\nAll right so, frameworks,\nexploit frameworks are going to\n\n188\n00:09:03.463 --> 00:09:08.270\ngive me the ability to create and\nexecute exploit code.\n\n189\n00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.770\nAnd it's basically,\nI could find the vulnerability myself.\n\n190\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:17.490\nWe can go out there like running our\nvulnerability scan the other day.\n\n191\n00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.890\nWe got a list of vulnerabilities\non that server, right?\n\n192\n00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.520\nI could have taken one fo those, and\nI could have followed links to it, and\n\n193\n00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.760\ngone out and found the information\nabout that particular vulnerability.\n\n194\n00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.620\nWhat it is, what causes it,\nhow you can take advantage of it, right?\n\n195\n00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.340\nBasically the white papers,\nthe research that's been done on it,\n\n196\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.820\nthe proof that there\nis this vulnerability.\n\n197\n00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.460\nI could take that information and\nI could sit down and\n\n198\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.340\njust start hammering out my own code and\nfigure out a way to\n\n199\n00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.700\nwrite some code that'll take\nadvantage of that vulnerability.\n\n200\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.170\nExploit frameworks had that\ncode already written, right?\n\n201\n00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.810\nI can go in there and I can grab that and\nI might have to tweak it for\n\n202\n00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:59.370\nthis particular version or\nOS or how I'm delivering it but\n\n203\n00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.370\na lot of the groundwork\nis already done for me.\n\n204\n00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.700\nWhy reinvent the wheel\nwhen I can take known,\n\n205\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:11.160\ngood exploit code, tweak it to my needs,\nput my payload in it and use that.\n\n206\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.200\nThat's the idea behind this,\n\n207\n00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.060\nis that reusability of this code, because\nwhen you're a penetration tester, for\n\n208\n00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.430\nexample, you don't wanna have to\nrewrite that stuff every time.\n\n209\n00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.360\nAll right, so\nwhat else do we want to talk about?\n\n210\n00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.290\nThat's probably good for that.\n\n211\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.690\nSo let's actually take a look\nat doing some exploitation.\n\n212\n00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.850\nWe'll take advantage of some of\nthe vulnerabilities that we found on that\n\n213\n00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.880\nserver box.\n\n214\n00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.280\nWe, in a previous episode,\nwe compromised a password.\n\n215\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.670\nSo we already have an admin username and\npassword that we can take advantage of.\n\n216\n00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.960\nSo now we'll take a look at Metasploit.\n\n217\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.540\nWe'll do the open source.\n\n218\n00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.550\nDaniel wouldn't pony up\nthe $10,000 to get Core Impact so\n\n219\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.040\nwe're stuck doing the open source stuff.\n\n220\n00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.255\n&gt;&gt; I'm waiting for the fire sale.\n\n221\n00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:54.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're\n\n222\n00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.545\ngonna drop those prices eventually.\n\n223\n00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:56.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n224\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.160\nhere on my Kali box I'm\ngonna open up my terminal.\n\n225\n00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.350\nAnd I'm gonna start by\nstarting up a service.\n\n226\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.570\nIf I can spell service,\nwe'll do service, post herely.\n\n227\n00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.281\nWas it that SQL?\n\n228\n00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:13.380\nI'll get that one.\n\n229\n00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.730\nDid I not start that?\n\n230\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.003\nI might get helps if you\nactually use the word.\n\n231\n00:11:16.003 --> 00:11:16.938\n&gt;&gt; Use start.\n\n232\n00:11:16.938 --> 00:11:17.468\n&gt;&gt; Start.\n\n233\n00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:20.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Tell it what you want to do with that.\n\n234\n00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.080\nBut Linux is great.\n\n235\n00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.635\nYou type it wrong and it tells you,\n\n236\n00:11:23.635 --> 00:11:27.404\nhere's the things you could have typed if\nyou really wanted this to actually work.\n\n237\n00:11:27.404 --> 00:11:28.740\nSo we're gonna start that up.\n\n238\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.830\nBasically Metsploit keeps a lot\nof information in a database\n\n239\n00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.210\nas you're building your exploit and\nyou're putting in values.\n\n240\n00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.770\nSo this is gonna start a little database\nengine in the background for us.\n\n241\n00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:43.141\nAnd then we're gonna type in msfdb,\n\n242\n00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:47.670\nall right msfdb init for initialize.\n\n243\n00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.290\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's gonna\nreach out and create that database,\n\n244\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.850\nthe Metasploit framework database,\nmsfdb is what it's gonna call it.\n\n245\n00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.510\nSo it's doing all that\nlittle scripts that run.\n\n246\n00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.780\nThis is all part of Metasploit, right?\n\n247\n00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.038\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike,\nis all this absolutely necessary?\n\n248\n00:12:03.038 --> 00:12:07.280\nI've run Metasploit a few times, I've\nnever had to do the post agree SQL or the,\n\n249\n00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.830\nI've worked with the DB but\nonly for updating purposes.\n\n250\n00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.639\n&gt;&gt; It's not absolutely necessary.\n\n251\n00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:15.481\nI, well-\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n252\n00:12:15.481 --> 00:12:18.168\nthis is how I've seen\nmost people start it off.\n\n253\n00:12:18.168 --> 00:12:19.847\n&gt;&gt; If it's your first run-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:12:19.847 --> 00:12:22.530\n&gt;&gt; Most likely you're in a situation\nwhere maybe it had already been run.\n\n255\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.648\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n256\n00:12:23.648 --> 00:12:25.740\n&gt;&gt; And\nthey had already done this initialization.\n\n257\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.430\nOr your distro had already loaded\nit up whereas Kali hasn't.\n\n258\n00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.770\nSo it's basically.\n\n259\n00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.946\nIt's there but you got to get it\nall ready and get it initialized.\n\n260\n00:12:32.946 --> 00:12:34.970\nAnd this is only something\nI have to do once.\n\n261\n00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.240\nI really should go in a take\na look at those services.\n\n262\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.090\nMake sure they're set to start\nautomatically when I boot up if I want to\n\n263\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.390\nuse this every time I log in.\n\n264\n00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:48.300\nAll right, so we got that running and\nnow we're gonna launch that by typing\n\n265\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:53.100\nmsfconsole and\nit should fire up Metasploit,\n\n266\n00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.450\nand we'll give it just a second,\nit takes a minute to kinda load up.\n\n267\n00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:57.920\nThere we can see it's\ngoing through the process.\n\n268\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.230\n&gt;&gt; Cool little graphic that they give you.\n\n269\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.480\nEvery time it's something different.\n\n270\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.556\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n271\n00:13:01.556 --> 00:13:02.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like watching just as\n\n272\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.767\nthe capital letter kinda does the wave-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n273\n00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:06.343\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Through starting\n\n274\n00:13:06.343 --> 00:13:08.611\nthe Metasploit Framework console.\n\n275\n00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:13.160\nThat's always fun and as Daniel says,\nwe'll get a surprise ASCII art.\n\n276\n00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.069\nAnd there we, I love Shell.\n\n277\n00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:15.907\n&gt;&gt; I love Shell.\n\n278\n00:13:15.907 --> 00:13:17.541\n&gt;&gt; Nice, all right.\n\n279\n00:13:17.541 --> 00:13:18.720\n&gt;&gt; Don't we all?\n\n280\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.230\n&gt;&gt; And every time you launch it up,\n\n281\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.570\nit's usually something\ndifferent which is pretty cool.\n\n282\n00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.220\nAll right, so\n\n283\n00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.360\nnow that we've got our framework\nlaunched up and we're ready to go.\n\n284\n00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.090\nThe next thing we really need to\ndo is work on our exploits, right?\n\n285\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.230\nWe gotta figure out what exploit\nit is that we want to use.\n\n286\n00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:41.230\nNow you can search through\nthe database of exploits.\n\n287\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.880\nAnd if I can find my backspace\nkey I will fix the word search.\n\n288\n00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:48.071\n&gt;&gt; All right, so for example I can do\nsearch, and let's just do a -h for help.\n\n289\n00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.140\nAnd it gives me some information\nabout what I can search and\n\n290\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.470\nhow I can use the search.\n\n291\n00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:01.472\nLet's do one for, let's say search and\nlet's say sun java\n\n292\n00:14:01.472 --> 00:14:06.700\nplatform: windows.\n\n293\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.580\nSo we're saying I'm looking for\nany exploits to do with Java by\n\n294\n00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:17.140\nSun Microsystems, and particularly ones\nagainst Windows based operating systems.\n\n295\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.440\nSo I'll hit enter, and it's telling me\nthat it hasn't built up the cache yet.\n\n296\n00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.500\nSo it hasn't indexed the database fully,\n\n297\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.270\nit's gonna take a little\nbit of time to find those.\n\n298\n00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.350\nIt shouldn't take very long.\n\n299\n00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.210\nSo we'll give it a minute and\nwe'll let it search.\n\n300\n00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.840\nAnd again, this is not the, there's\nother ways I can search through here.\n\n301\n00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.750\nYou can go out to Metasploit Online and\nsearch.\n\n302\n00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:43.150\nI know for, I was doing that when\nI was running through some other\n\n303\n00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.580\nexercises I would have\nthe actually online and\n\n304\n00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.090\nthought of as a little bit easier actually\nto search in their online database.\n\n305\n00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.040\nWhat else was I gonna say about that?\n\n306\n00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.490\nThere's other ones too.\n\n307\n00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:01.266\nLike I said, there's the common\nexploit vulnerabilities database.\n\n308\n00:15:01.266 --> 00:15:02.354\nWhat's another one?\n&gt;&gt; Exploit DB.\n\n309\n00:15:02.354 --> 00:15:05.300\n&gt;&gt; Exploit DB by Offensive Security,\nyeah, good call there,\n\n310\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.980\nis another database that you can go and\nsearch through.\n\n311\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.570\nAll right, so we get these results.\n\n312\n00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.800\nLet me maximize this window so\nwe can kind of see what it came back with.\n\n313\n00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.530\nSo it's overlapping a little bit so\nyou'd have to kind of start over here.\n\n314\n00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:25.780\nMozilla Firefox 16M channel,\nuse after free vulnerability,\n\n315\n00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.360\nor yeah, most of these are.\n\n316\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.350\nUse after free.\n\n317\n00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.650\nHere's one nice,\npayload/java/sp_shell_bind_tcp.\n\n318\n00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.990\nSo this is probably one that might\ngive me a reverse shell, right?\n\n319\n00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.550\nOr a bind shell there.\n\n320\n00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:46.290\nAgain, this is what you have to,\nas a penetration tester.\n\n321\n00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.469\nAs a security professional.\n\n322\n00:15:48.469 --> 00:15:50.585\nYou're going to look through here,\n\n323\n00:15:50.585 --> 00:15:54.283\nand find the one that you want to\ntry to see if you can make it work.\n\n324\n00:15:54.283 --> 00:15:56.186\n&gt;&gt; I like how they give you the.\n\n325\n00:15:56.186 --> 00:15:58.613\nThe kind of rating whether or\nnot this is going to work.\n\n326\n00:15:58.613 --> 00:16:01.810\nSo if there's this normal,\naverage, excellent, great.\n\n327\n00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.220\nExcellent.\nI like seeing that excellent.\n\n328\n00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n329\n00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.570\nOr great.\n\n330\n00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.760\nSo yeah, I'm gonna look for\nstuff with that on there.\n\n331\n00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.513\n&gt;&gt; That's the one we're gonna start with.\n\n332\n00:16:08.513 --> 00:16:09.404\nRight?\nCuz that's excellent.\n\n333\n00:16:09.404 --> 00:16:13.539\nSo that means somebody, most people,\nhave gotten really good success or\n\n334\n00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:16.660\nhad good luck with that particular export.\n\n335\n00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.220\nExploit, let me say that correctly.\n\n336\n00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.543\nAll right, so let's do this,\nlet's clear this up.\n\n337\n00:16:25.871 --> 00:16:29.478\nAll right, let's bring that back down.\n\n338\n00:16:29.478 --> 00:16:32.030\nMy resolutions just off by a hair here.\n\n339\n00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.340\nSo I'm gonna have to bring that\nback down to work with it.\n\n340\n00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.408\nAll right, there we go.\n\n341\n00:16:40.408 --> 00:16:41.313\nOkay, now so let's do another search.\n\n342\n00:16:41.313 --> 00:16:46.698\nI want to do a search for\n\n343\n00:16:46.698 --> 00:16:53.790\nCVE- 2013-2465.\n\n344\n00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.946\nHeck yeah.\nIt's gonna search through there, and\n\n345\n00:16:56.946 --> 00:16:58.260\nit's gonna find the exploit.\n\n346\n00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.622\nMaybe you had found out about an exploit\nsomewhere else, and you wanna see if that\n\n347\n00:17:02.622 --> 00:17:06.989\nexploit or if Metasploit has anything that\ncan take advantage of that particular\n\n348\n00:17:06.989 --> 00:17:10.416\nvulnerability or that exploit\nthat you want to capitalize on.\n\n349\n00:17:10.416 --> 00:17:13.470\nAll right, so let that finish.\n\n350\n00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.280\nGive it just a second.\n\n351\n00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.690\nAnd we'll get those results.\n\n352\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.169\nThen what we're gonna do, is we\nare going to pick one of these exploits,\n\n353\n00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:20.441\nwe're gonna start working with it.\n\n354\n00:17:20.441 --> 00:17:24.007\nI'm gonna show you how to set\nthe options and configuration for\n\n355\n00:17:24.007 --> 00:17:27.750\nthe exploit, and\nwe'll attempt to launch that exploit.\n\n356\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.420\nAnd we'll tie in,\n\n357\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:33.120\nwe'll do a little Nmap, we'll bring\nthat into the picture here as well.\n\n358\n00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.133\nSo we'll let this search\n\n359\n00:17:38.383 --> 00:17:43.184\nAnd,\n&gt;&gt; And it's-\n\n360\n00:17:43.184 --> 00:17:43.739\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't you know it,\n\n361\n00:17:43.739 --> 00:17:44.891\nforget the timeout,\nlet's just keep on going.\n\n362\n00:17:44.891 --> 00:17:45.585\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n363\n00:17:45.585 --> 00:17:48.735\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I was getting\nready to do a little magic of TV,\n\n364\n00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:53.270\nput the raw turkey in, and pull the cooked\nturkey out, but it finished just in time.\n\n365\n00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.860\nSo there it found one, then we could\nturn around and attempt to use that.\n\n366\n00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.133\nSo great search capabilities\nbuilt into Metasploit.\n\n367\n00:18:00.888 --> 00:18:04.440\nAll right, now what we're gonna do\nis I'm gonna type in the word hosts.\n\n368\n00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.967\nAnd this is reaching out to\nthat database that we created\n\n369\n00:18:06.967 --> 00:18:08.538\nearlier when we did the msdv init.\n\n370\n00:18:08.538 --> 00:18:12.950\nAnd I can see that there's\nno hosts in there currently.\n\n371\n00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.374\nSo let's run a command db_nmap- a,\n\n372\n00:18:16.374 --> 00:18:22.370\nhopefully you guys remember,\nthink back to that episode, oops.\n\n373\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.230\nIt's gonna help if I spell that right.\n\n374\n00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.953\n- A, remember capital A does\nOS fingerprinting as well as\n\n375\n00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:36.220\nTRACERT, as well as versioning, right?\n\n376\n00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.290\nSo it kinda does a few of\nthe different scans all in one.\n\n377\n00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.390\n&gt;&gt; And it runs some Nmap NSE\nscripts as well, right?\n\n378\n00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nit does some enumeration like on SMB, yep.\n\n379\n00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.540\nAnd it uses that as part of,\n\n380\n00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.620\nit's a little deeper of a operating\nsystem fingerprinting guess.\n\n381\n00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:55.994\nAll right, and so\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\n\n382\n00:18:55.994 --> 00:19:00.724\ngo ahead and scan 0.100.0/24.\n\n383\n00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:07.020\nSo we've seen this before,\nthis is just Nmap going up.\n\n384\n00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.423\nBut I'm doing it from within\nthe Metasploit console, all right?\n\n385\n00:19:11.423 --> 00:19:13.230\nSo db_nmap, and\n\n386\n00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.090\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna do\na normal scan just like Nmap would.\n\n387\n00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.548\nIt's leveraging Nmap,\nNmap has to be installed on this system.\n\n388\n00:19:19.548 --> 00:19:22.790\nIt's running Nmap, but\nit's gonna take those results and\n\n389\n00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.350\ndump them into our database.\n\n390\n00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:28.050\nThat way I can then turn around and use\nthose without having to type out strings\n\n391\n00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:32.349\nof IP addresses or get text files for\ninput on my exploits.\n\n392\n00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.190\nSo let this run for\njust a second, it will finish up.\n\n393\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:37.440\nIt might take a couple minutes.\n\n394\n00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.310\nSo let's let this run cuz\nit is doing a deep scan.\n\n395\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.640\nRemember, it's doing that OS\nfingerprinting and that verging and\n\n396\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.510\nthat TRACERT.\n\n397\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.850\nWe'll let it run, as soon as it finishes,\nwe'll jump back in.\n\n398\n00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.080\nAll right, Nmaps,\nI should say Nmap has finished it's scan.\n\n399\n00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.970\nIt is part of Metasploit in this case,\nbut let's take a look at my screen and\n\n400\n00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.180\nsee what happened.\n\n401\n00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.630\nSo we ran that Nmap from within\nthe Metasploit framework,\n\n402\n00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.610\nit's given me the results and\nwe've actually seen these results before.\n\n403\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.632\nWe can see things like,\nlet me scroll back up here.\n\n404\n00:20:08.632 --> 00:20:12.980\nIt scanned the entire subnet,\nbut here's 100.200.\n\n405\n00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.440\nI can see the open ports.\n\n406\n00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.285\nI can see because it's\ndoing that versioning.\n\n407\n00:20:19.285 --> 00:20:22.085\nYou can see version information\nabout the different services that\n\n408\n00:20:22.085 --> 00:20:24.125\nare running on those open ports.\n\n409\n00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:28.185\nI've got my OS guess down here where I\ntry to fingerprint my operating system.\n\n410\n00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:34.495\nI've got my trace route results showing\nme where that system is on our network.\n\n411\n00:20:34.495 --> 00:20:36.015\nAll right, so\nnow that we've got that done.\n\n412\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.606\nIf I type in hosts again, notice I've\ngot some IP addresses in here, or\n\n413\n00:20:41.606 --> 00:20:43.915\nI've got some information in here.\n\n414\n00:20:43.915 --> 00:20:47.186\nAnd that's because that scan\nfound these systems and\n\n415\n00:20:47.186 --> 00:20:51.800\nthen deposited the information In\nto that database for Metasploit.\n\n416\n00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.640\nSo, I can now use that\ninformation as I go through and\n\n417\n00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.280\ncreate my exploit and metasploit.\n\n418\n00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.432\nAll right, so what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna use one.\n\n419\n00:21:01.432 --> 00:21:05.040\nLet me type in my path, I have trouble\ntyping in and talking at the same time.\n\n420\n00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.864\nExploits windows\n\n421\n00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:14.055\n/smb/psexec.\n\n422\n00:21:14.055 --> 00:21:14.629\nAll right?\n\n423\n00:21:14.629 --> 00:21:18.760\nAnd what you'll see is\nthat my prompt changes.\n\n424\n00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.020\nYou can see, now it says exploit(psexec).\n\n425\n00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.180\nThat means I've chosen the exploit\nthat I want to work with, and\n\n426\n00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.400\nI'm now at that prompt.\n\n427\n00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.707\nAnd so I can start feeding\ninformation into that exploit so\n\n428\n00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:34.650\nI can package it up and\nget it ready to go.\n\n429\n00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:40.080\nSo the information I need, if I type\nin info from this particular prompt,\n\n430\n00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.900\nit's gonna give me information\nabout this exploit.\n\n431\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.040\nLet's make this a little bit bigger again.\n\n432\n00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.859\nSo here's where I typed in info and\n\n433\n00:21:47.859 --> 00:21:51.770\nI can see this is Microsoft Windows\nAuthentication User Code Execution.\n\n434\n00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.770\nWhat other good stuff,\nwhen it was disclosed, who wrote it, and\n\n435\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.420\nthe most important stuff for\nus is my options down here.\n\n436\n00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.400\nAnd in particular, this column, required.\n\n437\n00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.960\nWhether or not that information is\nrequired to successfully run this exploit.\n\n438\n00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.940\nAnd you can see I need an R host,\nbecause I need to give it a destination,\n\n439\n00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.440\nwho is the target that is required?\n\n440\n00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.520\nI need a port number.\n\n441\n00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.790\nOur port is the option for\nthat, it's already set, 445.\n\n442\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.652\nI need a share to connect to, I also can,\n\n443\n00:22:26.652 --> 00:22:32.005\nnotice not required,\nput in a password and a user name.\n\n444\n00:22:32.005 --> 00:22:33.571\nAnd in our case I'm gonna need to,\n\n445\n00:22:33.571 --> 00:22:35.680\notherwise this is not\ngoing to be successful.\n\n446\n00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.510\nAll right, it tells you down here at\nthe description use a valid administrator,\n\n447\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.070\nusername and password, or\nhash to execute an arbitrary payload.\n\n448\n00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.300\nSimilar to PS exec utility\nthat sys internals made.\n\n449\n00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.790\nRemember PS exec is a valid tool.\n\n450\n00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.900\nI forget, is it Mark Versonovich if\nI've pronounced his name correctly\n\n451\n00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.490\nwith Systernals with Microsoft,\n\n452\n00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:00.680\nI guess cuz they bought Systenals,\ncreated these tools years ago.\n\n453\n00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:05.200\nAnd they were for remotely executing code,\nfor remotely managing servers.\n\n454\n00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.760\nYou can also see down\ntowards the bottom here,\n\n455\n00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.410\nreferences to the actual vulnerabilities.\n\n456\n00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:16.230\nSo if I want more information about this,\nI can go out and\n\n457\n00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:20.243\nlook at tech net or\nSource Forge, or that CSV.\n\n458\n00:23:20.243 --> 00:23:24.030\nCSV, old habits, CVE database, right?\n\n459\n00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.367\nAnd take a look and get more\ninformation about what it's gonna do,\n\n460\n00:23:26.367 --> 00:23:29.070\nwhat it's taken advantage of,\nthings like that.\n\n461\n00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:32.425\nAll right, so let's set some information,\n\n462\n00:23:32.425 --> 00:23:37.989\nwe're gonna use the set command, and\nwe're gonna say set R host equal to,\n\n463\n00:23:37.989 --> 00:23:43.133\nand then my target address,\n100.200, and I'll hit Enter.\n\n464\n00:23:43.133 --> 00:23:46.837\nAll right and you can see R host equals,\nand it sets that value.\n\n465\n00:23:46.837 --> 00:23:53.923\nI also wanna set the,\nlet's do a set smb pass for the password.\n\n466\n00:23:53.923 --> 00:23:58.170\nAnd I'll put the password that we gained\nwhen we were doing our password cracking\n\n467\n00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:58.740\nearlier.\n\n468\n00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.120\nGo and hit Enter.\n\n469\n00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:09.320\nAnd then set SMB user is gonna be\nadministrator, and I'll hit Enter.\n\n470\n00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.000\nSo we're just plugging in values\ninto a table in that database.\n\n471\n00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.810\nThese are the options that I wanna\nconfigure with this exploit.\n\n472\n00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:22.500\nIf I do info again,\nwe can see that those values are now set.\n\n473\n00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.680\nThere's my R host and it's set.\n\n474\n00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.350\nSo I wanna do that until I make sure\nat least all the ones that are required\n\n475\n00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.060\nare filled in.\n\n476\n00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:34.120\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, we had trouble with N Crack,\ndoing the password cracking in a previous\n\n477\n00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:39.110\nepisode because we didn't check the case\nsensitivity on the Word administrator.\n\n478\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.600\nIs that gonna cause us\nan issue here maybe as well?\n\n479\n00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.520\n&gt;&gt; It very well could.\n\n480\n00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.160\nSo you know what we should do?\n\n481\n00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:45.890\nWe should fix it.\n\n482\n00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:46.735\n&gt;&gt; We should fix it.\n&gt;&gt; Let's fix it.\n\n483\n00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:49.270\n[LAUGH] So let's do a set.\n\n484\n00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:54.819\nSMB user to administrator.\n\n485\n00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:56.930\nAll right.\n\n486\n00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:03.210\nAnd then if we do info again, we see\nthat administrator's now lower case.\n\n487\n00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.340\nSo Daniel brings up a very good point and\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n488\n00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.090\nfix that just to avoid\nthe chance of any issues.\n\n489\n00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:09.870\n&gt;&gt; Case sensitivity.\n\n490\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now once it'll want\na capital a for this round.\n\n491\n00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:14.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt, right?\n\n492\n00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.040\n[LAUGH] Now real quick,\nwe did have a question in the chat room.\n\n493\n00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Was asking about the mobile versions\n\n494\n00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.530\nof things like Metasploit.\n\n495\n00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.000\nAnd they're saying that they were getting,\n\n496\n00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.710\nthey couldn't update it because the update\nwas apparently about 36 megs in size.\n\n497\n00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.050\nAnd it was saying updates\nare only available through WiFi.\n\n498\n00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.020\nI know this is a little\noff the beaten path, but\n\n499\n00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.670\nI thought maybe tertiarily correlated\nhere to what we're talking about.\n\n500\n00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.260\nWhat would you say that\nthat was caused from?\n\n501\n00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.150\nWas it because they're trying to save\nyou on your data cap maybe if you have\n\n502\n00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:41.040\na data plan?\n\n503\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:41.820\n&gt;&gt; Most likely.\n\n504\n00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.370\nI'm looking at that question now there.\n\n505\n00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.560\nSo, when download update size for\nthe necessary patch still say 36,\n\n506\n00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.320\nwhy is it always only update over Wi-Fi?\n\n507\n00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.435\nIt very well could be your\ndevice that's doing that.\n\n508\n00:25:53.435 --> 00:25:55.060\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I know like an iPhone\n\n509\n00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.230\nwon't let you get an update unless\nyou're connected to WiFi and or\n\n510\n00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.600\nplugged in because it wants to make\nsure you don't run out of battery power.\n\n511\n00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.040\nAnd it wants to make sure that\nit doesn't take forever and\n\n512\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.070\na day to get that update down.\n\n513\n00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.100\nSo it could be something like that.\n\n514\n00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.270\nIt could be the device itself.\n\n515\n00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.270\nI don't know that the other end,\nor it could be the application,\n\n516\n00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.220\nthat might be the other thing is,\nthe application you're running,\n\n517\n00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:22.220\nthat portable version of this, is\nprobably what's saying, I'm not on wi-fi,\n\n518\n00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.270\nI'm not even gonna\nattempt to download this.\n\n519\n00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.850\nWait until you connect to Wi-Fi\ncos it's just gonna take too long\n\n520\n00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.350\nto download that over say,\na 3G connection or something like that.\n\n521\n00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:35.440\nThat would be my guess, but again that's\njust a relatively educated guess.\n\n522\n00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.322\nI won't even say educated.\n\n523\n00:26:36.322 --> 00:26:38.260\n&gt;&gt; Relatively.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But yeah,\n\n524\n00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.840\nthat would be my guess is that it's\nthe application itself is configured\n\n525\n00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.520\nto only do updates when it's on Wi-Fi.\n\n526\n00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.370\nAnd it could be because it's gonna\ntake too long or as Daniel said,\n\n527\n00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.410\nit could be that it's too big.\n\n528\n00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:56.230\nBut then if you can do it over Wi-Fi and\nnot 3G, the size, who knows.\n\n529\n00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.790\nI don't even know.\n\n530\n00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.870\nBut that would be my guess.\n\n531\n00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:03.060\nI would say just plug in or\nconnect to a Wi-Fi network and do that.\n\n532\n00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.840\nOr your device could be saying,\nlook I'm out of room.\n\n533\n00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.110\nI can't hold anymore.\n\n534\n00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.810\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n535\n00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:14.370\nnow that we've got everything loaded up,\nlet's go ahead and execute this guy.\n\n536\n00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.250\nOnce it's loaded, and\n\n537\n00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.970\nwe're at this prompt, it does save\nthat information in the database.\n\n538\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:23.380\nSo I could back out, and then come back\nin, and I would see that information set.\n\n539\n00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.780\nI've got everything I need.\n\n540\n00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.110\nIt's all configured, so\nI'm just gonna type in exploit.\n\n541\n00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.810\nAnd that will launch the exploit.\n\n542\n00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:32.915\nSo then you do the drumroll.\n\n543\n00:27:32.915 --> 00:27:35.289\n[SOUND] Right?\n\n544\n00:27:35.289 --> 00:27:37.560\nYou keep your fingers crossed.\n\n545\n00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.905\nAnd we'll see what happens.\n\n546\n00:27:38.905 --> 00:27:39.870\nUh-oh.\n\n547\n00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:40.750\n&gt;&gt; Something's happening.\n\n548\n00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.490\n&gt;&gt; Something's happening, what's it doing?\n\n549\n00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:50.740\nAll right, we can see there,\nstarted reverse TCP handler on port 4444.\n\n550\n00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.190\nAuthenticating using administrator,\nselecting PowerShell target.\n\n551\n00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:57.490\nSending stage, and there we go.\n\n552\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.280\nWe are in.\n\n553\n00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.650\nWe are at our meterpreter prompt.\n\n554\n00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:09.680\nMeterpreter is just a part of\nthe MetaDisplay framework.\n\n555\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.030\nIt allows me to then now\nwork with that remote system\n\n556\n00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.900\nnow that I've got a compromise.\n\n557\n00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.870\nI typed in help.\n\n558\n00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:21.780\nAnd I can see some of the commands\nthat I can use, like for example, ARP.\n\n559\n00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.830\nWell, okay, what's that do?\n\n560\n00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:27.540\nWe'll type in ARP and\nlook at there, that's the ARP cache\n\n561\n00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.610\noff of that remove machine,\nthe one that I've just compromised.\n\n562\n00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.480\nWhat's another one that we could do?\n\n563\n00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.960\nLet's do a DER.\n\n564\n00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.029\nAll right, see where we're at\nhere on that remote system.\n\n565\n00:28:44.401 --> 00:28:47.540\nWow, didn't think it'd take that\nlong to fire off my directory.\n\n566\n00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.058\nCommand, it's thinking about it.\n\n567\n00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.780\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n568\n00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.700\n&gt;&gt; Coming back with a lot of information.\n\n569\n00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.960\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n570\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.830\nI'm probably in the.\n\n571\n00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:02.350\n&gt;&gt; The System32 folder.\nSo lots of stuff going on in there.\n\n572\n00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:05.450\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nthere's a ton of crap in there.\n\n573\n00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.010\nLet's do cd backslash.\n\n574\n00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.420\nAnd now do another dir and\nsee what we get.\n\n575\n00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.260\nThat's the little letter.\n\n576\n00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:12.520\n&gt;&gt; That was a little bit faster.\n\n577\n00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.710\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, where are we?\n\n578\n00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.661\nYeah, so now I can basically\nsee that I'm at the root of C:,\n\n579\n00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:21.610\ncos there's my Recycle Bin,\nthere's Documents and\n\n580\n00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.580\nSettings, Program Files,\nthere's the Windows directory.\n\n581\n00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.600\nI mean, so at this point I\ncould do whatever I wanted.\n\n582\n00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.750\nI want to start deleting files,\n\n583\n00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.165\ncreating files,\nleaving them notes on their desktop.\n\n584\n00:29:31.165 --> 00:29:32.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You know, you've been pawned,\n\n585\n00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.950\nisn't that what everybody\nlikes to put now a days.\n\n586\n00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.260\n&gt;&gt; Maybe diving into their web root\ndirectory and defacing their website and\n\n587\n00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:39.990\nthat kind of thing.\n\n588\n00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.850\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n589\n00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.160\nJust pretty much anything you\nwant to do at this point.\n\n590\n00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.290\nLet's do a who am I, not that one,\nlet's try that again, who am I.\n\n591\n00:29:52.162 --> 00:29:55.200\nBecause it's not going to allow me to\ndo that through this prompt, okay.\n\n592\n00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.550\nThat's fine, usually I like to do\nthat to prove who I'm logged on as.\n\n593\n00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:01.870\nBut interpreter doesn't have that\nin its list of available commands.\n\n594\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.900\nAll right, and so there we go,\nwe've compromised that machine,\n\n595\n00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.710\nwe have made it into the system and\nwe now own that system.\n\n596\n00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:14.510\nSo let me type in exit to get out\nof metapreter, get back here.\n\n597\n00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.420\nI'm gonna type in back to\nback out of my exploit,\n\n598\n00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:21.630\nget back to that MSF framework,\nand then I'll exit out of that.\n\n599\n00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:23.950\nPretty cool stuff, right?\n\n600\n00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very neat stuff.\n\n601\n00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.760\n&gt;&gt; One more thing, I know we're getting\nshort on time here, one more thing I do\n\n602\n00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:34.200\nwant to show you is that exploit\nhas a graphical option as well.\n\n603\n00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.550\nSo I can get my Windows to play along,\nwe'll get rid of that.\n\n604\n00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.710\nWe'll scroll back over.\n\n605\n00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:46.950\nAnd let me fire up another terminal and\n\n606\n00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:50.659\nI'm going to type in armitage.\n\n607\n00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:54.600\nArmitage is basically my front end.\n\n608\n00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.380\nOr it's a GUI front end for\nMetasploit framework, right.\n\n609\n00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.830\nSo we give this a second.\n\n610\n00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.535\nAnd I'm just gonna accept all my defaults.\n\n611\n00:31:01.535 --> 00:31:04.490\nIt's connecting to the local machine,\ndefault port number for\n\n612\n00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:05.780\nmy Metasploit framework.\n\n613\n00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:10.280\nIf you had changed any of that, you'd\nwanna obviously make those changes here.\n\n614\n00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.730\nI'm gonna go ahead and click Connect and\nit tells me that it's not running,\n\n615\n00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.000\nthe RPC Server Service.\n\n616\n00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.120\nDo I wanna start it?\n\n617\n00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:16.960\nYes, yes I do.\n\n618\n00:31:20.065 --> 00:31:22.600\nAnd eventually, it will connect.\n\n619\n00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.950\nWe'll keep our fingers crossed.\n\n620\n00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:30.010\nIt says refused but, give it a second,\nand it should kick in.\n\n621\n00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:30.700\n&gt;&gt; Just goes to show you,\n\n622\n00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.190\nyou can't trust a computer as\nfar as you can throw the thing.\n\n623\n00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.200\nIt always tells you, that didn't work.\n\n624\n00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.180\nAnd it did work, actually.\n\n625\n00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:37.980\nOr, that worked.\n\n626\n00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.916\nAnd it didn't work at all.\n\n627\n00:31:39.916 --> 00:31:41.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right?\n\n628\n00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:43.200\nAnd again there it goes,\nit fired up just fine, so\n\n629\n00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.750\nI don't know what the error is for.\n\n630\n00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.513\nThe terminal window stays\nopen in the background and\n\n631\n00:31:47.513 --> 00:31:49.279\nthen this GUI front end opens up.\n\n632\n00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:53.251\nSo if you're newer to Metasploit,\nthis maybe is a better way to start.\n\n633\n00:31:53.251 --> 00:31:59.290\nStill lets you explore through\nthe different exploits you can setup,\n\n634\n00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:03.290\nBut look at this,\nnice little GUI interface.\n\n635\n00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:04.700\nWhere did these guys come from?\n\n636\n00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:06.970\nRemember host?\n\n637\n00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.290\nRight, when we were in that Nmap scan?\n\n638\n00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:11.480\nThere they are, so\nit's hitting the database and\n\n639\n00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.100\nit's pulling that information up.\n\n640\n00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:17.540\nAnd I can click on this guy, and\nI can then right click on it and\n\n641\n00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.920\nyou can see I've got different options.\n\n642\n00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.010\nI can attempt to log in, we can scan,\nlet's go ahead and fire a scan off.\n\n643\n00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:24.990\nAll right and\n\n644\n00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:29.964\nit'll actually go through and do it looks\nlike it's doing a top 1,000 ports there.\n\n645\n00:32:29.964 --> 00:32:36.050\nWe'll give it just a second to complete,\nso it's gonna run a scan.\n\n646\n00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:43.113\nAnd then let's do this,\nI'm gonna right-click,\n\n647\n00:32:43.113 --> 00:32:48.577\nlogin, and choose PS exec, all right.\n\n648\n00:32:48.577 --> 00:32:51.683\nAnd here,\nnotice because I've run this all ready,\n\n649\n00:32:51.683 --> 00:32:54.470\nit has the information already in there.\n\n650\n00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.400\nIf it didn't I would just\nfill the information in.\n\n651\n00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:02.670\nJust like doing set our host and set our\nport, here I'm just typing in fields and\n\n652\n00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.930\nit's gonna store those values\nin the appropriate location.\n\n653\n00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:10.910\nSo I'm gonna use these, and\nI'm gonna use a reverse connection, and\n\n654\n00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.230\nI'm gonna click launch.\n\n655\n00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.170\nAnd then we'll see what happens.\n\n656\n00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.760\nYou can see down here look at the command,\nlooks familiar, right.\n\n657\n00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.610\nActually, that's very, very small,\nI know you guys can barely see that.\n\n658\n00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.570\nBut that first line is use exploit,\nif I can scroll back up there,\n\n659\n00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:29.440\nuse exploit/windows/smb/psexec.\n\n660\n00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.300\nIt's the exact same thing we just typed\nin a minute ago doing it manually.\n\n661\n00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:38.880\nSo you can see this GUI is just taking\nyour input, turning it into something that\n\n662\n00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.390\nMetasploit understands, and using that\nMetasploit framework in the background.\n\n663\n00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:43.640\n&gt;&gt; And the graphics are entertaining.\n\n664\n00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.955\nI see that as it's doing something to that\nmachine, the machine graphic has changed\n\n665\n00:33:47.955 --> 00:33:49.950\nlike red with lightning bolts around it,\nlike it's on something.\n\n666\n00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:50.740\n&gt;&gt; Can you guys see that?\n\n667\n00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.430\nHopefully yeah,\nhopefully you guys can see that out there.\n\n668\n00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.650\nThe frame of that computer's red and\nthere's actually lightning or\n\n669\n00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.300\nelectricity or something coming,\nwrapped around there.\n\n670\n00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:03.280\nSee, now here I can actually see,\nI am logged on as nt authority system.\n\n671\n00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.000\nAll right, that means again,\nI have full control over this machine.\n\n672\n00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:13.450\nIf I can get this scrolled down,\njust a wee bit there we go.\n\n673\n00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:15.210\n&gt;&gt; Mike's now selling his\nBitCoin money in the system.\n\n674\n00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:21.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just doing a little,\noops, do a little DIR, all right.\n\n675\n00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.802\nAnd there I'm able to run my directory\ncommands, I could delete files,\n\n676\n00:34:24.802 --> 00:34:27.780\ncreate files,\ndo whatever I wanted from right here.\n\n677\n00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.520\nSo basically,\nit's a graphical front end for Metasploit.\n\n678\n00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.400\nAnd then once I launch my exploit and\n\n679\n00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:38.080\nI'm connected, I can use my terminal down\nthere just like I would if I had done this\n\n680\n00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.940\nthe old fashioned manual way\nfrom the terminal initially.\n\n681\n00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Mike,\nif anybody out there is watching this and\n\n682\n00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.740\nthey're uninitiated,\n\n683\n00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:49.425\nthey haven't seen much of what can be done\nthrough one of these exploit frameworks.\n\n684\n00:34:49.425 --> 00:34:53.660\nThey're probably going, my goodness,\nthat was way too easy for\n\n685\n00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.820\nMike to be able to take\nfull control of a system,\n\n686\n00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.510\nand that's really what the whole\npurpose of these are for.\n\n687\n00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:01.730\nSo that we don't have to spend\nour time banging out code, and\n\n688\n00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.640\nnot that we couldn't do that.\n\n689\n00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.560\nWe have better things to do than to\nreinvent the wheel if this is already been\n\n690\n00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:11.440\ndone I just wanna jump into something like\nMetasploit or Core Impact or whatever.\n\n691\n00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.886\nAnd just start looking through my system\nseeing if I'm able to compromise and\n\n692\n00:35:14.886 --> 00:35:16.008\nfind vulnerabilities.\n\n693\n00:35:16.008 --> 00:35:16.675\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n694\n00:35:16.675 --> 00:35:19.128\none more thing I wanna show you\nbefore Daniel kicks us out of here.\n\n695\n00:35:19.128 --> 00:35:22.814\nNow that I'm connected, right,\nand this machine is exploited\n\n696\n00:35:22.814 --> 00:35:26.800\nlet's right click on it again And\nI have a new menu, mterpreter1.\n\n697\n00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.040\nAnd as I go over here these\nare the things I can now try to launch,\n\n698\n00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:37.090\nescalate privilege, dump hashes, interact,\nif I wanna launch a command shell,\n\n699\n00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:41.740\ndo a little remote desktop, VNC, explore.\n\n700\n00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:46.480\nIt says log keystrokes, so\nI just clicked on log keystrokes.\n\n701\n00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.552\nI'm gonna say, let's see if there's any\nadvanced options I wanna configure.\n\n702\n00:35:49.552 --> 00:35:53.110\nEh, I'll just go ahead and\nsay launch, all right.\n\n703\n00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:57.340\nAnd now, let's see if we can\nget some results to pop up.\n\n704\n00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:02.540\nSo I just launched a keystroke\nlogger on that compromised machine.\n\n705\n00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:07.700\nSo if I make my way back over\nto the compromised machine,\n\n706\n00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:12.400\nand I'll type in,\nI don't know Hello world.\n\n707\n00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:20.660\nMaybe the administrator\nopens up a Notepad and\n\n708\n00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:24.868\nstarts typing in secret text.\n\n709\n00:36:27.237 --> 00:36:30.310\nAll right, we'll close that and\nwe'll save it.\n\n710\n00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.290\nActually, we won't save it.\n\n711\n00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:34.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, even if you don't,\nit's still captured, right?\n\n712\n00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:39.474\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so let me minimize that,\njump back over to Kali.\n\n713\n00:36:41.993 --> 00:36:44.590\nOops, that's not what I want,\nlet's go fullscreen with that guy.\n\n714\n00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:51.845\nAnd it says it's recording keystrokes,\nkeystrokes captured, no t.\n\n715\n00:36:51.845 --> 00:36:56.500\n[LAUGH] Not exactly sure what no t means,\nbut\n\n716\n00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:00.310\nthere we can see keystrokes\ncaptured account.\n\n717\n00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:03.490\nAnd then I was using my number keypad,\nso number one, number two,\n\n718\n00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:06.100\nnumber three, number four, number five.\n\n719\n00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:10.400\nThat was what I typed, Notepad, so\nit missed a couple characters there.\n\n720\n00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.640\nN-O-T-E, it's missing the P,\nit got the A and it's missing the D.\n\n721\n00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.100\n&gt;&gt; Wonder if it's using like a UDP\nprotocol to send this information.\n\n722\n00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:24.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's not connection oriented,\nso it might have dropped a couple there.\n\n723\n00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.500\nThat's what that was,\nthat was hello world.\n\n724\n00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.860\nWhen I was typing that there's\nmy Windows key L win so\n\n725\n00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.800\nyou can see it is capturing key\nstrokes off of that remote machine.\n\n726\n00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.982\n&gt;&gt; Looks like Medea typed t in, heller.\n\n727\n00:37:37.982 --> 00:37:41.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\nit just shows you these frameworks make it\n\n728\n00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.710\nvery simple to take advantage\nof known vulnerabilities.\n\n729\n00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.410\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff,\nvery powerful software.\n\n730\n00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.550\nIf you have never played\nwith any of these things,\n\n731\n00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:53.240\nlike we've said before, Metasploit\nis free, you can just download it.\n\n732\n00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.110\nGrab Armitage to go on top of that so you\nhave a nice graphical front end especially\n\n733\n00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:01.000\nif this is your first foray into it, but\ndefinitely learn how to use these things.\n\n734\n00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.150\nAs a security professional, you want to be\nable to use them towards your advantage so\n\n735\n00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.740\nthat you can find the problems\nbefore the bad guys do.\n\n736\n00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.500\nThat's the whole purpose of being\nable to do an exercise like this.\n\n737\n00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.400\nThat being said, we have well exhausted\nour time for this episode but Mike,\n\n738\n00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.890\nfantastic job with the explanations and\nthe demonstrations.\n\n739\n00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:21.090\nTotally appreciate that, we appreciate\nyou guys joining us for today,\n\n740\n00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.380\nbut it is that time for us to sign off.\n\n741\n00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.500\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n742\n00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.290\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n743\n00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:27.447\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you

00:00:12.470\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.980\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.240\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.380\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with more RCFR Series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.650\nThat's right the Cybersec First Responder.\n\n9\n00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.520\nAnd joining us back in the studio again\nis our good friend, Mister Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.380\nMike, welcome back.\n\n11\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.110\nGlad to have you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.770\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.862\nThanks for having me back,\nglad to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:35.560\nWe are going to be talking\nabout web based attacks or\n\n15\n00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.780\nweb attacks in this particular episode.\n\n16\n00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.870\nWhat did we look at in the previous one?\n\n17\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.750\nWe looked at exploitation frameworks.\n\n18\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.660\nNow we're gonna move on into web attacks.\n\n19\n00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.800\nReally, the first thing I wanna do with\nweb attacks is make some classifications,\n\n20\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.790\nsome definitions.\n\n21\n00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.230\nObviously, web attacks are very popular\nnowadays because everything seems to be\n\n22\n00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.430\nweb driven.\n\n23\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.670\nIf you're a business, I don't know,\nit would be a complete guess.\n\n24\n00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.230\nI've never seen any statistics but I bet\nyou 90% of businesses have a web front.\n\n25\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.250\nWhether it's just informational or\nmost likely so you can order product or\n\n26\n00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.710\nservices online.\n\n27\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.440\nSo web attacks are obviously going to be\nat the top of the list of types of attacks\n\n28\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.680\nthat the bad actors\nare going to be executing.\n\n29\n00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.235\nBecause it's part of our\nattack surface area.\n\n30\n00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:29.100\nWe've talked a little about\nthat as an organization.\n\n31\n00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.240\nYou want to limit the avenues\nof attack that the bad actors\n\n32\n00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.570\nhave to get into my system, but there are\nsome things we can't avoid all together.\n\n33\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.920\nWe can do things to help secure it But\nlike my website, I need a web presence so\n\n34\n00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770\npeople can come buy my product.\n\n35\n00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.630\nI have to have the ability for\nthem to place an order and\n\n36\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.670\nthat means collecting data from the user,\nthe visitor to my website,\n\n37\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.210\nand processing that on the back end.\n\n38\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.850\nAnd creating that order.\n\n39\n00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.320\nSo that's a big avenue of attack or\nattack vector for\n\n40\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.630\nthe bad actors to get in because\nThat's already in place, right?\n\n41\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.140\nNow if they can manipulate that system,\nthey can possibly take advantage of it and\n\n42\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.160\ndo harm.\n\n43\n00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.300\nWhen we look at attacks, we can classify\nthem as either client side or server side.\n\n44\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.680\nNow client side attacks are when they\nare attacking the client ends of things.\n\n45\n00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.360\nThat might be social engineering to get\na password out of a user that they use to\n\n46\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.820\nconnect to a website.\n\n47\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.710\nIt could be, what's another good example?\n\n48\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.700\n&gt;&gt; The browser itself?\n\n49\n00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.900\n&gt;&gt; The browser itself could be attacked.\n\n50\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.840\nI could maybe get them to click on a link,\nbut\n\n51\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.200\nit's again down at\nthe client side of things.\n\n52\n00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.990\nOr server side where I introduce\nthe malware on the server end and\n\n53\n00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.680\nhopefully visitors to the website then\nwould receive that malware, right, when\n\n54\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.270\nthey click on a link or they Browse to\na particular page or something like that.\n\n55\n00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.280\nSo client side versus server side\nis not a black and white line.\n\n56\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.500\nA lot of the server side attacks for\nexample, end up affecting the client.\n\n57\n00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.100\nIt's the client that gets infected and\nhas the data stall and or what have you,\n\n58\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.730\nbut it's still considered as server\nside attack because the malicious code\n\n59\n00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.400\nWas placed on the server\nthat attacked the client.\n\n60\n00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.960\nAll right?\nSo just some definitions there,\n\n61\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.590\nsome more definitions, terminology we need\nto be familiar with, cross site scripting,\n\n62\n00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.500\ncross site request forgery.\n\n63\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.410\nWe're looking at cross site scripting, we\ntake advantage of scripting languages and\n\n64\n00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.120\ninput validation Vulnerabilities that we\nmight find in these web applications.\n\n65\n00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.220\nAnd they can be done as a stored attack,\n\n66\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.680\na reflected attack or what we call a dom\nattack or a direct object model attack.\n\n67\n00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.780\nIn a stored attack,\n\n68\n00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.920\nthe bad actor is going to attempt to\nplace the malware on the server and\n\n69\n00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.470\nthen visitors to that page, to that web\nserver, when they Open up that website.\n\n70\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.820\nThat malware then gets delivered from the\nserver to the end user, to that victim and\n\n71\n00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.010\nthey get compromised.\n\n72\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.530\nSo that'd be a stored attack, because I'm\nstoring the malware, the attack on the web\n\n73\n00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.970\nserver and then visitors are the ones\nthat get the bad end of the thing there.\n\n74\n00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.590\nOr it could be a reflected attack.\n\n75\n00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.400\nIn which case maybe what I'm gonna try and\ndo is generate some type of form or\n\n76\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.100\nrequest and then send that to my victim.\n\n77\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.090\nThey click on it and\nit connects to the web site\n\n78\n00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.660\nwhich then rendered in the link that\nI send them is the malware, right?\n\n79\n00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.060\nSo what happens is when they click on it,\nThey're submitting a request to the web\n\n80\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.660\nserver, the web server's\nreading that request and\n\n81\n00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.240\nin the request is malware that the web\nserver then sends back to the victim.\n\n82\n00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.780\nSo I'm reflecting the attack\noff of the web server.\n\n83\n00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.210\nI never attacked the web server,\n\n84\n00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.260\nI'm just using the process that goes\non when a user visits the web site.\n\n85\n00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.140\nTaking advantage of that process, right?\n\n86\n00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.550\nSo that'd be a reflected attack and\nthen a DOM or\n\n87\n00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.190\na Direct Object Model based attack is\nwhen we don't talk to the server at all.\n\n88\n00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.300\nWe just hit the client directly,\nlike Java Script is a big one.\n\n89\n00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.335\nWhere we have the web app on the victim\n\n90\n00:05:07.335 --> 00:05:11.240\nexecutes the Java code and\nthen false print.\n\n91\n00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.910\nSo that will be a DOM.\n\n92\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.870\nAnd then you've got a cross site scripting\nforgery which is an interesting one.\n\n93\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.260\nIn this case with the cross site\nscripting forgery we take advantage of.\n\n94\n00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.930\nThe trust that gets established between\nthe, we'll call them the victim and\n\n95\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.910\nthe web server, right?\n\n96\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.160\nThe mechanism that we're taking\nadvantage of here is my,\n\n97\n00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.670\none of my pet peeves but\nmost sites have this option and many,\n\n98\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.711\nmany people take advantage of it and\nthat's the good old Remember Me.\n\n99\n00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:44.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n100\n00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Because they don't want to be bothered\nwith having to type in a user name and\n\n101\n00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.010\na password to authenticate to this site,\nfor example.\n\n102\n00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.580\nSo most sites give them the option.\n\n103\n00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.490\nHey, if you put a little check mark here,\nremember me.\n\n104\n00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.070\nBecause as a website vendor I\nwant you to come in to my site.\n\n105\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.220\nI want to make it easy.\n\n106\n00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.750\nI want you to come buy product.\n\n107\n00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.360\nSo I'm okay with you saying remember me.\n\n108\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.515\nYou know what,\nthe bad guys want you to make it easy too.\n\n109\n00:06:06.515 --> 00:06:08.253\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they do.\n\n110\n00:06:08.253 --> 00:06:10.370\nSo, what happens when\nyou choose that option,\n\n111\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.870\nthat remember me option, the web\nserver's gonna place a cookie on your\n\n112\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.160\nmachine that it can store information\nin about your authentication, and\n\n113\n00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.580\nthen when you go to that website again, it\nalready has that information in there, and\n\n114\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.840\nit can authenticate, and\nyou just go right to the site.\n\n115\n00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.330\nYou don't have to stop and\ndo The authentication.\n\n116\n00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.620\nBad guys are gonna take\nadvantage of this process by\n\n117\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.450\ntaking advantage of that trust, right?\n\n118\n00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.200\nThat your browser and\nthat web app on that web server have.\n\n119\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.150\nWhat the bad guy's gonna end\nup doing is sending you a link\n\n120\n00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.490\nthat they want you to click on.\n\n121\n00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.210\nAnd in that link they'll use one of\nthe methods that's available on that web\n\n122\n00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.870\napplication to do some process.\n\n123\n00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.390\nYou don't know that that's in there,\nright.\n\n124\n00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.180\nYou see a link,\n\n125\n00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.380\nmaybe it's a, hey we need you to come back\nand update your customer information.\n\n126\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.370\nSo you click on it, but when you click on\nit it's not just going to the website.\n\n127\n00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.960\nIt's actually doing a post process, or\nit's submitting data along with it.\n\n128\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.710\nAnd then Because the web\napp trusts your browser,\n\n129\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.630\nyou've got that cookie,\nyou're already authenticated.\n\n130\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.950\nIt just goes ahead and\nexecutes the request, all right?\n\n131\n00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:23.090\nThat'd be an example of\na cross-site request forgery.\n\n132\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.970\nI know that's kind of hard to grasp, so\nI typed this one up real quick for us.\n\n133\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.850\nLet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n134\n00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.310\nThis might be what I'm sending,\nso you've already,\n\n135\n00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.300\nlet's pretend you're the victim And you've\nalready gone to your bank, logged in and\n\n136\n00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.610\nyou choose the whole remember me option,\nand now you've logged out of your bank.\n\n137\n00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.690\nI end up sending you a link in an email,\nsome type of phishing scam,\n\n138\n00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.960\nsome type of social engineering scam,\nand this is the link.\n\n139\n00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.000\nAnd of course, I'm gonna make it so\nthis is all you see, right?\n\n140\n00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.314\nWhen you click on that link.\n\n141\n00:07:52.314 --> 00:07:54.611\nBut what's really happening is in there,\nis a transfer method.\n\n142\n00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:58.610\nYou know that web app has\nsome method called transfer.\n\n143\n00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.349\nTake advantage of that.\n\n144\n00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:04.225\nFrom account victim to account attacker,\namount 1,000.\n\n145\n00:08:04.225 --> 00:08:07.755\nBecause of the trust that's already\nestablished, you've said remember me,\n\n146\n00:08:07.755 --> 00:08:11.021\nwhen you click on that link and your\nbrowser opens up and goes to that page,\n\n147\n00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:12.860\nyou're already authenticated.\n\n148\n00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.910\nTherefore, the web app is gonna trust\nthat the request that you're making\n\n149\n00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.575\nis from you, and it's gonna execute it.\n\n150\n00:08:19.575 --> 00:08:20.670\nRight?\nIt's that simple.\n\n151\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.990\nIt's scary.\n\n152\n00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.590\nIt's not quite as easy as we\nmake it sound to pull off, but\n\n153\n00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.670\nthat's what they can try to do to you.\n\n154\n00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.970\nAnd there again,\ntaking advantage of that trust.\n\n155\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.790\nThat whole remember me thing.\n\n156\n00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.298\nAnd one of the big issues with\nthis trust site request forgery,\n\n157\n00:08:36.298 --> 00:08:39.699\nit's very hard to track\nbecause to the web app,\n\n158\n00:08:39.699 --> 00:08:44.141\nit looks like a legitimate\nrequest from a valid user, right?\n\n159\n00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:45.990\nYou're somebody that has an account there.\n\n160\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.218\nYou've chosen remember me.\n\n161\n00:08:47.218 --> 00:08:50.330\nWhen you opened it up, the browser\nauthenticated you as far as the web app\n\n162\n00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.962\nknows, it's you, it's authenticated and\nthis is what you want to do.\n\n163\n00:08:53.962 --> 00:08:58.390\nSo all it's doing is carrying out\nyour commands, your commands, right?\n\n164\n00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.790\nBut not exactly what you intended.\n\n165\n00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:05.790\nSo from their perspective, it looks like\nnormal activity from a validated user.\n\n166\n00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.300\nSo you call them up and\n\n167\n00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.220\nsay, hey look, $1,000 got transferred\nout of my account to somewhere.\n\n168\n00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.650\nThey look and\nthey see you making that request, right?\n\n169\n00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:20.280\nSo it becomes very difficult to do the,\nword I'm looking for?\n\n170\n00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.797\n&gt;&gt; To prove that it was not you.\n\n171\n00:09:21.797 --> 00:09:23.287\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Basically.\n\n172\n00:09:23.287 --> 00:09:24.359\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n173\n00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:27.341\n&gt;&gt; To start doing your investigation on\n\n174\n00:09:27.341 --> 00:09:33.220\nthe alleged illegal transfer,\nyeah, or whatever the case may be.\n\n175\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.760\nSo that is our cross site request forgery.\n\n176\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.320\nOther types of web attacks, one of\nthe most common ones out there right now.\n\n177\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.323\nIf you go to OWASP top web attack, top 10,\n\n178\n00:09:44.323 --> 00:09:47.940\nthis is a company that keeps\ntrack of the most common attacks.\n\n179\n00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.240\nThey make a great list, OWASP Top 10.\n\n180\n00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.340\nThe SQL injection, or command injection,\nis really what it's called but\n\n181\n00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.430\nit's almost always SQL injection but\nthat doesn't have to be.\n\n182\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:05.050\nMost web front ends, right,\nwebsites, have a database back end.\n\n183\n00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:09.613\nAnd the website, when you go and\nyou click on a product link,\n\n184\n00:10:09.613 --> 00:10:14.220\nright, it goes and hits that database and\nit pulls up an image or images.\n\n185\n00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.620\nAnd so a description and a price and all\nof that good stuff and displays it in your\n\n186\n00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.390\nbrowser, so that back end, that\ndatabase storing all this information.\n\n187\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.110\nWhen you went to log in, the web front end\nsent that information of the back end,\n\n188\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.360\nit was processed,\nvalidated that you are a valid user and\n\n189\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.340\nthat you typed in the right password,\nand allows you to authenticate.\n\n190\n00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.980\nSo we've got these database back ends,\nand we'll call it a SQL.\n\n191\n00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.970\nAnd keep in mind, I'm not saying\nSQL as in Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n192\n00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.160\nI know a lot of us Windows guys,\n\n193\n00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.420\nthat's the first thing we\nthink of when we hear that.\n\n194\n00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.247\nSQL is Structured Query Language or,\ntechnically,\n\n195\n00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:52.780\nTransact-SQL, transactional\nStructured Query Language.\n\n196\n00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.780\nThat's not a Microsoft product.\n\n197\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.137\nThey just happened to have\na product that's called SQL.\n\n198\n00:10:57.137 --> 00:10:59.250\nSo keep that in mind as I say SQL.\n\n199\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:05.327\nI'm not talking about the Microsoft server\nproduct like, what some other MySQL.\n\n200\n00:11:05.327 --> 00:11:09.101\nThere's a bunch of different\nopen sourced SQL databases,\n\n201\n00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:13.210\nall use the same language,\nright, it's that Transact-SQL.\n\n202\n00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.090\nMicrosoft, of course,\nmodifies theirs just a little bit,\n\n203\n00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.810\nthey don't like to follow\nstandards all the time.\n\n204\n00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:20.540\nWhere was I going with that?\n\n205\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.870\nSo SQL injection.\n\n206\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.869\nThe idea here is that I am\ngoing to take advantage of\n\n207\n00:11:25.869 --> 00:11:29.688\na web application that\nhas a database back end.\n\n208\n00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:33.740\nAnd I'm gonna try and\nexecute a command against that back end.\n\n209\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.430\nAnd if your web app, if your developers or\n\n210\n00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:41.760\nwhoever you bought this from haven't\ndone their job and properly scrubbed,\n\n211\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.380\nsanitized, or at least looked that\nthe input that you're allowing,\n\n212\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.660\nthat information could be sent back and\nprocessed, right, by that back end.\n\n213\n00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:56.170\nNow we, what's a good way to say this,\nwe have to accept input\n\n214\n00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.310\nfrom the user because we need them to type\nin their username and their password.\n\n215\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.410\nSo we can't avoid that.\n\n216\n00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.470\nBut what I can avoid is whether or\n\n217\n00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.660\nnot they're allowed to type out\nfull SQL commands in there, right?\n\n218\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.800\nIf there's a username field, should I\nbe able to put equal signs in there or\n\n219\n00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.970\nampersands or dashes?\n\n220\n00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:15.800\nNot really, right?\n\n221\n00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.710\nI should eliminate that.\n\n222\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.670\nSo I should control what's allowed to even\nbe put in those fields in the first place,\n\n223\n00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:27.060\nand that's really the sad part about it,\nthink command injection in general,\n\n224\n00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:33.260\nis it's really easy to prevent if\nyou just take a little bit of time.\n\n225\n00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.880\nI say that and then the problem is,\nif you're buying an app from somebody,\n\n226\n00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.810\nyou don't have access to the source code,\nbecause they're not gonna give that\n\n227\n00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.210\nto you, because they're making\nmoney off selling their product.\n\n228\n00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.835\nSo you might not be able to\nexamine all that but testing it,\n\n229\n00:12:45.835 --> 00:12:48.941\nmaking sure that it does what it's\nsupposed to do, talking to them,\n\n230\n00:12:48.941 --> 00:12:51.371\ntalking to the other people\nthat bought the product.\n\n231\n00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:54.434\nDefinitely wanna do\nyour research in there,\n\n232\n00:12:54.434 --> 00:12:59.916\nbecause this can be devastating to an\norganization, if you're victim to a SQL or\n\n233\n00:12:59.916 --> 00:13:05.520\na command injection, they can do\na lot of damage to your organization.\n\n234\n00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.130\nBecause again,\nwhat we're gonna talk about,\n\n235\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.070\nI'll show you an example of\nthis here in just a little bit,\n\n236\n00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.970\nis instead of typing in a username,\nI type in a SQL command.\n\n237\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:18.320\nMaybe that SQL command is to drop\na table called customers, right?\n\n238\n00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.530\nOr, retrieve all the records out\nof your credit card database and\n\n239\n00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.640\ncreate an HTML file out of it.\n\n240\n00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.990\nAnd put it there instead\nof your home page.\n\n241\n00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.110\nSo now when users go to your home page,\n\n242\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.640\nthey're seeing a list of all your\ncustomers and their credit cards.\n\n243\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.404\nHopefully not for very long.\n\n244\n00:13:31.404 --> 00:13:33.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you get that down.\n\n245\n00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.310\nBut that's the kind of thing\nthat they can do with this.\n\n246\n00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.320\nJust destroy data,\nexpose data, steal data.\n\n247\n00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.820\nAny number of things can\nbe done with SQL injection.\n\n248\n00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.522\nLet's take a look again at my screen here.\n\n249\n00:13:45.522 --> 00:13:48.793\nCuz I know it's a tricky one\nI think to grasp at first,\n\n250\n00:13:48.793 --> 00:13:53.330\nespecially if you're not familiar\nwith Transact-SQL, the language.\n\n251\n00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.470\nHere is a normal query that\nwould be submitted say out of\n\n252\n00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:02.470\nan authentication form on a web server or\non a website.\n\n253\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.066\nSo SELECT all FROM.\n\n254\n00:14:04.066 --> 00:14:07.510\nAsterisk is all, SELECT all FROM tbl_user.\n\n255\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.780\nThat'd be the name of the table\nthat's storing the data.\n\n256\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.620\nWHERE username equals John AND\npassword equals password.\n\n257\n00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.570\nSo as a user, I type in John in my\nusername box, I type in my password in my\n\n258\n00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:24.360\npassword box, and then what the web form\nis doing is generating this query and\n\n259\n00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.870\nsubmitting it to the back end.\n\n260\n00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:31.120\nSo you can see the users oops, didn't\nmean to do that, let's control z there.\n\n261\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.030\nSo what it's doing is taking whatever\nyou typed in that username box and\n\n262\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:39.740\nputting it in here, whatever you typed\nin password putting it in there, and\n\n263\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.720\nthen submitting that back to the server\nfor authentication or for processing.\n\n264\n00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.371\nSo what we're gonna do, what the bad\nactors would do or as a penetration test\n\n265\n00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:53.095\nor what you do to see if the system is\nvulnerable to command injection is we'll\n\n266\n00:14:53.095 --> 00:14:58.502\ndo something like this, we'll put a single\napostrophe in the username field, right?\n\n267\n00:14:58.502 --> 00:15:02.770\nAnd we'll see if we get\nan error back from the website.\n\n268\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.518\nSo what that would look like.\n\n269\n00:15:04.518 --> 00:15:07.940\nNow instead of typing John,\nI just put a single apostrophe in there.\n\n270\n00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.430\nSo you can see the single\napostrophe put between those\n\n271\n00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.415\napostrophes that's getting\nsubmitted back there.\n\n272\n00:15:13.415 --> 00:15:18.310\nAnd what happens here is now I've\ngot an odd number of quotes, right,\n\n273\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.440\nof apostrophes.\n\n274\n00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.845\nSo it sees the username in these first\ntwo apostrophes, are basically these,\n\n275\n00:15:23.845 --> 00:15:27.332\nand there's nothing in there so\nit's like a blank username.\n\n276\n00:15:27.332 --> 00:15:31.182\nAnd then there's an apostrophe here,\nthere's no AND, and then there's another\n\n277\n00:15:31.182 --> 00:15:35.252\napostrophe so it's trying to interpret\nthis, it's like wait, this isn't working,\n\n278\n00:15:35.252 --> 00:15:39.160\nthis is not right, this is not what\nI'm expecting and it throws an error.\n\n279\n00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.000\nRight?\n\n280\n00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.720\nAnd if you get an error, you would think\nif you get an error, something's wrong.\n\n281\n00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.140\nBut as a bad actor, if I get an error,\nI'm jumping up and down.\n\n282\n00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.407\nI'm like, woo hoo!\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n283\n00:15:48.407 --> 00:15:51.399\n&gt;&gt; Because what that means is they\n\n284\n00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:54.052\ndid not validate my input.\n\n285\n00:15:54.052 --> 00:15:57.848\nAnd it was submitted,\njust like I typed it, to the back end.\n\n286\n00:15:57.848 --> 00:16:00.645\nAnd the back end said [SOUND],\nchoked on it,\n\n287\n00:16:00.645 --> 00:16:04.394\ndidn't' know what to do with it,\nand threw up an error.\n\n288\n00:16:04.394 --> 00:16:06.923\nIf there was no error,\nif it comes back and says,\n\n289\n00:16:06.923 --> 00:16:11.640\nhey please input a valid username that\nmeans they're doing some input validation.\n\n290\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.530\nAnd they're saying,\nhey apostrophes aren't allowed.\n\n291\n00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:15.740\nFill that in again, right.\n\n292\n00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.700\nIt should have never left\nthe web form in the first place.\n\n293\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.730\nThey should be doing\nchecks on the front-end.\n\n294\n00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.540\nThere should be more checks\non the back-end too,\n\n295\n00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.320\nbefore the data is actually processed.\n\n296\n00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.860\nBut what's happening is\nit's not being done.\n\n297\n00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.800\nSo we see that error, and\nwe're like whew, now we're good.\n\n298\n00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.130\nCuz now I know whatever I type in those\nfields is gonna be submitted back.\n\n299\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:42.390\nSo then what I do, is in the username\ninput I put a single apostrophe, or 1=1--.\n\n300\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:47.975\nIn transact SQL, a -- is a comment.\n\n301\n00:16:47.975 --> 00:16:51.495\nSo it means anything after a --,\nSQL will not try to process this,\n\n302\n00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:54.305\nas this is a comment for when we're\nwriting code and we're trying to\n\n303\n00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:58.665\nexplain to ourselves what the heck we did\nhere, that's where we put our comments.\n\n304\n00:16:58.665 --> 00:17:02.195\nSo it'll ignore everything\nafter those --'s.\n\n305\n00:17:02.195 --> 00:17:05.115\nSo then if we read the statement\nthat would then get submitted,\n\n306\n00:17:05.115 --> 00:17:07.680\ncuz it's gonna take this,\nwhat we just typed and\n\n307\n00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.010\nit's gonna dump it in here\nwhere it normally does.\n\n308\n00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:17.640\nAnd you end up with SELECT*FROM\ntbl_user WHERE username*=_or 1=1 and\n\n309\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:23.550\nthen ignore everything else because\nthat's all just commented out.\n\n310\n00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.840\nOr windows 1=1 Daniel?\n\n311\n00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.655\n&gt;&gt; The last time I check with do my Math.\n\n312\n00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:29.090\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n&gt;&gt; Like I'm sure\n\n313\n00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.110\n&gt;&gt; Last time I said one equals one\n\n314\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.651\nall the time.\n\n315\n00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:33.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, exactly right.\n\n316\n00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.026\nSo for\nnow continue on with this new math stuff.\n\n317\n00:17:37.026 --> 00:17:37.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n318\n00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.040\nyou never know what it's gonna equal next\nyear but for now one does equal one.\n\n319\n00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.830\nSo that statement rings as true and\nit will basically process it and\n\n320\n00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.980\nend up in this case it\nwould just dump everything.\n\n321\n00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.890\nCuz what it's normally doing is\nlooking for a match for John right?\n\n322\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.970\nIt's saying all right,\nthe user name is John,\n\n323\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.060\nI'm gonna find that in this users table.\n\n324\n00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.260\nThis is the password that's stored,\nthis is the password they inputted.\n\n325\n00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.630\nIt matches, everything's true,\nwe'll authenticate him.\n\n326\n00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.240\nWell here in this case\nit's just gonna say,\n\n327\n00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.490\nwell everything's true if\nthe username is blank or 1 = 1.\n\n328\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.670\nSo as it's processing the table,\nit goes to that first row.\n\n329\n00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.350\nAnd it says,\nis this the username they typed in?\n\n330\n00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.210\nNo, it's not blank.\n\n331\n00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.340\nDoes 1 = 1?\n\n332\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.782\nYes.\nThen that's a valid return, right?\n\n333\n00:18:20.782 --> 00:18:22.764\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It can go to the next one and say,\n\n334\n00:18:22.764 --> 00:18:24.370\nis this the username they typed in?\n\n335\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.826\nBlank.\nNope, that doesn't match.\n\n336\n00:18:25.826 --> 00:18:26.590\nDoes 1 = 1?\n\n337\n00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.650\nYes it does.\n\n338\n00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.550\nI'll send that one back too right.\n\n339\n00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.340\nAnd that's the idea behind SQL injection.\n\n340\n00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.270\nThat's a there's a little more to it,\n\n341\n00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.510\nit can get a lot more complex\nwith creating the command.\n\n342\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.350\nSometimes it's not the apostrophe\nthat I have to use.\n\n343\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.790\nI might have to do double quotes.\n\n344\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.150\nI might have to do two single quotes.\n\n345\n00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:48.760\nThere's different ways I can try to\nget this to work but, in the end,\n\n346\n00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:54.120\nall we're doing is trying to make a valid\nSQL statement that we can send back.\n\n347\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.350\nAll right?\n\n348\n00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.690\nAnd that is the idea behind SQL injection.\n\n349\n00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.570\nI'll do a little demo coming up here and\n\n350\n00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.350\nI'll show you an example of\ndoing some SQL injection.\n\n351\n00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.270\nOr command injection depending\non what you want to call it.\n\n352\n00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.380\nAnother one that we need to talk\nabout is direct reach reversal\n\n353\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.430\nwhen it comes to web based attacks.\n\n354\n00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:15.750\nDirect reach reversals are one that\nrelatively easy to defend against but\n\n355\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.730\nsometimes are not done.\n\n356\n00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.980\nA lot of our browsers actually\nprotect against this.\n\n357\n00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.950\nFor us, or some of the browsers,\nI should say.\n\n358\n00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:28.950\nBut my developers should be onto this one,\nit's been around for a long time.\n\n359\n00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:33.530\nDirectory traversal means I'm gonna try\nto navigate through your file system\n\n360\n00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.200\nto get to where I want.\n\n361\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.080\nWe know by default like\nlets us IIS as an example,\n\n362\n00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.470\nInternet Information Services\nby Microsoft their web server.\n\n363\n00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:48.460\nThe default location for\nwebsites is c:inetpubwwwroot.\n\n364\n00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:53.170\nSo in your mind picture\nthe hierarchy c:www, or\n\n365\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:58.460\nI'm sorry, c:inetpub and\nthen a subfolder, wwwroot.\n\n366\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:03.019\nSo the web page that I'm viewing is\nin that www, did I say enough w's?\n\n367\n00:20:03.019 --> 00:20:04.595\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n368\n00:20:04.595 --> 00:20:07.530\n&gt;&gt; Wwroot, that's where the web\npage that I'm currently viewing is.\n\n369\n00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:13.470\nIf I can move up one directory,\nnow I'm in that inetpub.\n\n370\n00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:17.420\nIf I can move up one more directory,\nnow I'm at C: and\n\n371\n00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.350\nI know the file structure\nof Windows inside and out.\n\n372\n00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:24.280\nSo I know that if I'm at C:,\nI should be able to get down into Windows.\n\n373\n00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.680\nThat's a subfolder of C:.\n\n374\n00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.810\nAnd then from Windows I\ncan get into System 32.\n\n375\n00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:33.455\nAnd guess what resides in System 32 that\nthe bad actors love to play around with.\n\n376\n00:20:33.455 --> 00:20:36.340\nCmd.exe right?\n\n377\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.410\nAmongst other things that are in there.\n\n378\n00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.770\nSo let me show you an example.\n\n379\n00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.690\nHere on my screen,\nI just had this typed out so\n\n380\n00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.010\nyou can kind of visualize what I'm saying.\n\n381\n00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:49.660\nIn most operating systems, ..\\ is going\nto be the way to move up one, right?\n\n382\n00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.120\nIf you're at a command prompt, and\n\n383\n00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.820\nyou're looking at your path that you're\ncurrently at and you dot dot backslash.\n\n384\n00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.970\nAnd it jumps you up one level.\n\n385\n00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.650\nWindows will also accept the forward\nslash because it's Windows.\n\n386\n00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.700\nSo I can do dot dot forward\nslash to jump up one as well.\n\n387\n00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:10.520\nSo imagine if I can get this on the end\nof a get request to a web server.\n\n388\n00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.820\nDot dot backslash, dot dot backslash.\n\n389\n00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.183\nThat gets me up to\nC:Windows/system32/cmd.exe.\n\n390\n00:21:17.183 --> 00:21:22.420\nAnd bada bing, a command prompt\nwindow opens up on my end with\n\n391\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.210\nsystem access, right, or\nsystem level access, NT authority access.\n\n392\n00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.230\nNow I said there's\nprotections against this.\n\n393\n00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:34.040\nWe want to look for traversal characters.\n\n394\n00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.930\nThose dot dot backslashes or\ndot dot forward slashes.\n\n395\n00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:37.720\nWe can just say, look.\n\n396\n00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.090\nDon't accept those as valid input.\n\n397\n00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:45.220\nThose shouldn't be coming in across\na URL or an HTTP Git request.\n\n398\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.070\nShouldn't be there.\n\n399\n00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.190\nSo we can make our applications,\nour web server.\n\n400\n00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.370\nOr our web front ends.\n\n401\n00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.840\nIgnore or not accept those.\n\n402\n00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.210\nSo then, what the bad actors\nare going to do is say, all right.\n\n403\n00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.420\nLet's encode that.\n\n404\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.740\nLet's do this.\n\n405\n00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.530\nA percent two e is a dot.\n\n406\n00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.910\nA percent two f is a forward slash.\n\n407\n00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.380\nSo I could do percent two e percent two\ne percent two f percent two e percent\n\n408\n00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.920\ntwo e percent two f,\nwhich is the same thing.\n\n409\n00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.140\nThat's just the encoded version of this.\n\n410\n00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.640\nSo you might have your app looking for\nthis and blocking that.\n\n411\n00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.930\nBut is it looking for this?\n\n412\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.480\nAll right, gets me the same results but\nit might not be blocked by you.\n\n413\n00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.130\nSo that's the idea behind\ndirectory traversal.\n\n414\n00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:29.570\nThere's other reasons to use this,\nlike if a website has scripts.\n\n415\n00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:33.360\nUsually when we're creating the website\nwe'll have a specific folder\n\n416\n00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.680\nin that web route that\nallows execution of scripts.\n\n417\n00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.770\nSo I can navigate up\nfrom www.root up one and\n\n418\n00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:46.450\nthen back down into your scripts\nfolder if I can find that path.\n\n419\n00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.620\nAnd now I'm in an executable folder if\nI can get anything uploaded in there,\n\n420\n00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.570\nI can have it executed.\n\n421\n00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.660\nAnd ways of discovering those paths,\ndifferent ways.\n\n422\n00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.940\nA lot of times it's out of error messages\nand that we get generated by the web\n\n423\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:05.200\nserver cuz the web dev team or\nwhoever's responsible for that web server.\n\n424\n00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.810\nHasn't done a good job of white washing\nif you will the error messages.\n\n425\n00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:14.300\nYou guys have all seen error messages if\nyou've been to a web page and it spits up\n\n426\n00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.520\na bunch of garbly gook looks like nasty\nstuff to a bad actor that's great stuff.\n\n427\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.140\nBecause I can start to see things like,\nwhat you're running.\n\n428\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.200\nIt'll say mySQL failed\nat blah blah line two.\n\n429\n00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.830\nWell we know you're running mysql,\nI can start to see pads in there,\n\n430\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.960\nwhere the file was located,\nit didn't execute properly.\n\n431\n00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.710\nWell, that's probably a directory\nthat allows execution so\n\n432\n00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.640\nwe can get a lot of\ninformation from the errors.\n\n433\n00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.590\nYou go to a website,\nit throws up an error, and\n\n434\n00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.730\nyou get the friendly little sorry,\nsomething went wrong, right?\n\n435\n00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.970\nYou might think, well, that's stupid.\n\n436\n00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:46.540\nThat's a great error.\n\n437\n00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.025\nThat's what you want you want\nyour website to spit that up,\n\n438\n00:23:49.025 --> 00:23:51.374\nbecause it's not releasing\nany information, right?\n\n439\n00:23:51.374 --> 00:23:55.778\nIt's not showing you the actual\nerror from the computer system.\n\n440\n00:23:55.778 --> 00:24:01.690\nAll right, another one we should talk\nabout is going to be LFI and RFI.\n\n441\n00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.570\nThis is local file include and\nremote file include.\n\n442\n00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.459\nI see Daniel over here-\n&gt;&gt; They're my favorites.\n\n443\n00:24:07.459 --> 00:24:08.502\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love these, and\n\n444\n00:24:08.502 --> 00:24:11.423\nif every web server had this,\nI would own the world.\n\n445\n00:24:11.423 --> 00:24:16.166\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can do a lot of damage with these\n\n446\n00:24:16.166 --> 00:24:17.260\nas well.\n\n447\n00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.160\nTake a look at my screen here.\n\n448\n00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.800\nI've got an example.\n\n449\n00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.730\nRemote file include means I'm\ntrying to get that web server to\n\n450\n00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:28.670\nprocess a page that is remote,\nthat's not on that web server.\n\n451\n00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.240\nLocal file means I'm gonna\ntry to get it to process\n\n452\n00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.450\na file that's already on the server.\n\n453\n00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:38.800\nSo for remote, here you can see\nthey've taken the end of the URL.\n\n454\n00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.140\nThey've got this like,\nPHP has a font parameter.\n\n455\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.740\nSo PHP is going to process that.\n\n456\n00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:49.330\nIt knows when you submit this\nrequest you can have a font equals,\n\n457\n00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.870\nand I forget the five fonts that Eric,\nthat PHP supports.\n\n458\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:56.900\nThere's like five of them that\nare valid classes you can send back.\n\n459\n00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.730\nBut I'm not sending back a font.\n\n460\n00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.600\nI'm sending back a URL.\n\n461\n00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.110\nAlright, and PHP will try an process this,\nopen that link up and go and\n\n462\n00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:10.570\nfind the malware that I have loaded\nup on my web server at my end.\n\n463\n00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:15.395\nFor local file include you\ncan see it's very similar,\n\n464\n00:25:15.395 --> 00:25:18.380\nFONT=../../Windows/system32/cmd.exe.\n\n465\n00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:23.910\nSo we're using directory traversal in\nthis local file include type attack.\n\n466\n00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:28.810\nAs percent 00 we use sometimes\nbecause PHP likes to try to tack on\n\n467\n00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:33.870\nit's expecting request for\nsomething that ends in .php.\n\n468\n00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:39.250\nAnd the system will sometimes add\nthe .php for us This %00's a space,\n\n469\n00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.760\nand it prevents it, or hopefully it stops\nit from adding the .php to the end of it.\n\n470\n00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.880\nCuz it wouldn't find cmd.exe.php, right?\n\n471\n00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.580\nBut if we can keep it from tacking\nthat on, it should find that,\n\n472\n00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.780\nit should launch it.\n\n473\n00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:51.940\nSo very very dangerous stuff.\n\n474\n00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes it is\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n475\n00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.700\nAnd that's a good look at\na lot of the different types\n\n476\n00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.220\nof web-based attacks that we're going to\nneed to be familiar with for this exam.\n\n477\n00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.410\nI know Daniel's shaking his head at me.\n\n478\n00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.160\nLooks like we're out of time for this one.\n\n479\n00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.290\nSo we'll have to save\nour sequel injection for\n\n480\n00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.950\nwhen we come back with another episode.\n\n481\n00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:10.420\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\nWell, I look forward to seeing that.\n\n482\n00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.149\nIt's going to be really cool to\nsee how these things are done.\n\n483\n00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.260\nWhen you see it,\nit's actually gonna blow your mind,\n\n484\n00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.790\nbecause it's not really that difficult.\n\n485\n00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.450\nYou just have to know a little\nbit about a little bit.\n\n486\n00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:23.390\nAnd then you should be able to throw\nthese commands at these web servers and\n\n487\n00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.951\nthey will return interesting results.\n\n488\n00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:26.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n489\n00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.670\nI'm really looking forward\nto that part two, Mike.\n\n490\n00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.880\nHopefully you are as well.\n\n491\n00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.290\nBut like Mike was saying,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n492\n00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.670\nSo we are going to have to call it a day,\nthanks for watching.\n\n493\n00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.820\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lawrie.\n\n494\n00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:39.502\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n495\n00:26:39.502 --> 00:26:41.012\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n496\n00:26:41.012 --> 00:26:47.700\n[MUSIC]\n\n497\n00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.513\nThank you for watching

It's going great, pressure's on and\nit's gonna be a great topic gosh darn.\n\n12\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.861\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like to set the bar high.\n\n13\n00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:36.478\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, thanks for having me back\nand we're continuing on, as you said,\n\n14\n00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:37.799\nwith Logical Operation CFR-210.\n\n15\n00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:40.913\nIn this one we're gonna be\ntaking a look at malware, right?\n\n16\n00:00:40.913 --> 00:00:42.792\n&gt;&gt; Dum, dum, dum!\n\n17\n00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n18\n00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.050\nEerie music going in the background.\n\n19\n00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.420\nMalware is kind of a general term,\nif you will, for something we don't want.\n\n20\n00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.100\nWhen we talk about malware,\n\n21\n00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.380\nmalicious software is really\nwhere this word came from.\n\n22\n00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.130\nI forget the term when you\ncombine two words like that, but\n\n23\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.860\nmalicious software shortened to malware.\n\n24\n00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.630\nIt's kind of an all-encompassing umbrella\nterm for a lot of different categories.\n\n25\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.930\nThings that we should be familiar with.\n\n26\n00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.140\nSo we're gonna go through a few\nof those different categories,\n\n27\n00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.930\nmake sure we understand what they are,\nwhat the differences are because\n\n28\n00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.020\nwe have to be able to one,\ntalk about it intelligently.\n\n29\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.360\nDaniel I'm sure you've had this\nseveral times, I know I have.\n\n30\n00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.333\nPeople come to you and\n\n31\n00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.260\nsay, my gosh I've got a virus\ncan you help me fix my computer?\n\n32\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.580\nThey don't have a virus.\n\n33\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.758\nWhat they've got is adware, right?\n\n34\n00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:36.070\nThat may be slowing their system down or\nthere's an update pending and\n\n35\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.283\nthey just need to reboot the system.\n\n36\n00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:39.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or something like that.\n\n37\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.761\n&gt;&gt; That's nine times\nout of ten right there.\n\n38\n00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:43.738\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but everybody calls\neverything a virus because for\n\n39\n00:01:43.738 --> 00:01:46.480\nthe untrained person that works,\nit's fine.\n\n40\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.440\nBut for us, if we're gonna talk\nintelligently, if we're gonna do research,\n\n41\n00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.854\nif we're going to protect and\nunderstand this,\n\n42\n00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:54.360\nwe need to understand\nthe different categories.\n\n43\n00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420\nAnd not everything is nice and tidy,\n\n44\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.980\nthere are some things that'll overlap\na little bit, but let's go through them.\n\n45\n00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.390\nWe talk about a virus, first of all.\n\n46\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.690\nA virus is malware or code that is\ngoing to attach itself to a file.\n\n47\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.983\nAnd when you receive an infected file,\n\n48\n00:02:11.983 --> 00:02:16.460\na file that has a virus attached to it,\nyou open that file up.\n\n49\n00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.320\nWell that file is opened up, and\nwe know the way that computers work.\n\n50\n00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.940\nThat means that it's loaded up into RAM,\nRandom Access Memory, so\n\n51\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.540\nthat the application can work with it and\npresent it.\n\n52\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.570\nWell, guess what?\n\n53\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.060\nThe virus that was attached to the file\n\n54\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.340\nis also now a resident in\nyour Random Access Memory.\n\n55\n00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.577\nAnd what it's going to do is look for\n\n56\n00:02:34.577 --> 00:02:38.914\nanything else that you have open\ncurrently and try to attach to that.\n\n57\n00:02:38.914 --> 00:02:42.452\nAnd then, If it can or can't that's great,\nbut if you save that file and\n\n58\n00:02:42.452 --> 00:02:46.003\nyou send it to somebody else, they\nopen it up it loads into their memory.\n\n59\n00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:50.304\nAnything they have open can then become\ninfected, they save and close their files,\n\n60\n00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:54.220\nthey send an attachment to somebody,\nand so on and so forth, right?\n\n61\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.630\nSo viruses,\nthe key to the definition there on viruses\n\n62\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.800\nis that it really needs\nour help to spread.\n\n63\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.235\nIt can replicate from one file to\nthe other if we open it up and\n\n64\n00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:05.692\nlet it reside in memory.\n\n65\n00:03:05.692 --> 00:03:09.610\nAnd we open other things up that aren't\ninfected, they can become infected.\n\n66\n00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.620\nSo it can replicate itself within\nour system, the infected system.\n\n67\n00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.000\nBut to get from one system to another,\n\n68\n00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.980\nthat is going to require\nhuman interaction.\n\n69\n00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.460\nI'm gonna have to send\nan infected file to somebody.\n\n70\n00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.705\nThey're gonna open it up,\ninfect their system, all their files,\n\n71\n00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.360\nthen they could send it.\n\n72\n00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.521\nIt's the old, and she told two friends and\nso on and so on, right?\n\n73\n00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:30.240\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n74\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.333\n&gt;&gt; It starts growing or\nspreading exponentially.\n\n75\n00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:35.859\nBut again, the key there is that viruses\nneed our help to spread because the two\n\n76\n00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:36.928\nthat people, I think,\n\n77\n00:03:36.928 --> 00:03:40.330\nhave the most trouble with\ndifferentiating are viruses and worms.\n\n78\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.140\nAnd let's jump to worm then.\n\n79\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.660\nA worm is like a virus.\n\n80\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.860\nIt's code, malformed code or\n\n81\n00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.990\nmalicious code, but\nit doesn't require our help, all right?\n\n82\n00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.010\nA worm can replicate itself and\nspread itself.\n\n83\n00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.340\nDoesn't attach to files or to programs.\n\n84\n00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.840\nIt's basically stand alone,\nalmost like a file.\n\n85\n00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.160\nJust like any other document\nyou might have on your system.\n\n86\n00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.720\n&gt;&gt; So\nit's much more intelligent than a virus.\n\n87\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.340\nWhere a virus requires us to basically\npropagate it for it, the worm says,\n\n88\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.690\nI don't need your help,\nI can just do this all on my own.\n\n89\n00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n90\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.000\nViruses typically do harm, right?\n\n91\n00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.340\nMost of them are designed\nto do something malicious,\n\n92\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.010\nwhether that is simply to\ninfect other files and spread.\n\n93\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.580\nBut usually it's going to cause\nslowdowns on your system,\n\n94\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.910\nit could attempt to remove\nfiles from your system.\n\n95\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.430\nCould harm your system in some way.\n\n96\n00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.330\nPrevent the operating system from booting,\ndepending on what it is.\n\n97\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.260\nWhereas worms a lot of times don't\nreally have any malicious payload\n\n98\n00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.910\nother than the fact that they can\nreplicate like bunny rabbits, all right?\n\n99\n00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.770\nWhat happens with worms because they're\nself-replicating, they start replicating.\n\n100\n00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.230\nYou get one system infected on your\nnetwork and it starts replicating,\n\n101\n00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.400\nlooking for other systems that\nare susceptible that it can infect.\n\n102\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.340\nAnd it will get on to those guys, and\nthen begin the process again from there.\n\n103\n00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.530\nNow you got three machines, four machines,\npretty soon your network is\n\n104\n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.690\ncompletely saturated with\nreplication traffic from this worm.\n\n105\n00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.050\nIt's generating so\nmuch as it gets more and more systems.\n\n106\n00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.326\nYou can do an Internet search for SQL\nSlammer and you'll find if you look for\n\n107\n00:05:19.326 --> 00:05:23.872\none of the moving heat maps you'll\nsee that it starts out small.\n\n108\n00:05:23.872 --> 00:05:28.329\nAnd then starts growing faster and faster\nand all of the sudden just goes bloop, and\n\n109\n00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:29.550\nmost of the map is red.\n\n110\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.138\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Once it goes,\n\n111\n00:05:31.138 --> 00:05:33.990\nagain it's an exponential growth.\n\n112\n00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.600\nAnd I know we got SQL Slammer at one\nof the facilities I used to work at.\n\n113\n00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.440\nHad a gentlemen that was doing some\ninstructing, had a SQL machine.\n\n114\n00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.350\nThis was way back when, and it was SQL\n2000 running, but it was unpatched and\n\n115\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.970\ngave it access to the Internet\nnot thinking about it.\n\n116\n00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.700\nDid not take long,\ngot SQL Slammer on there.\n\n117\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.305\nAnd within a few minutes,\nI mean, it was not long.\n\n118\n00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:57.315\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Our network was toast.\n\n119\n00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n120\n00:05:58.148 --> 00:06:00.528\n&gt;&gt; And just trying to remove it is near,\nI mean,\n\n121\n00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:04.910\nyou gotta start shutting everything down,\nall right, to quiet the network.\n\n122\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.060\nCuz I can't remote into a system and\ntry to fix it, I mean,\n\n123\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.018\nthe network is just dead in the water.\n\n124\n00:06:09.018 --> 00:06:11.410\nIt was amazing.\n&gt;&gt; There's been a few of those guys that\n\n125\n00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.760\nhave just really taken\nthe Internet by storm.\n\n126\n00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.180\nI remember Code Red and\nNimda, things of that nature.\n\n127\n00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.440\nThey just spread like wildfire.\n\n128\n00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.040\nAnd it's funny, if you go out and\n\n129\n00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.880\nyou do a Google search for how much\ndamages do those things actually cost?\n\n130\n00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.790\nThey are massive amounts of money,\nit is crazy.\n\n131\n00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.650\nJust through network disruption.\n\n132\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n133\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.760\nI mean no real malicious\npayload to speak of.\n\n134\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.340\nNot to say that they can't,\nand they definitely can.\n\n135\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.110\nBut a lot of times,\nthat's really not the purpose of the worm.\n\n136\n00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.810\nIt's just to bring down the network,\n\n137\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.990\ncause a denial of service on\nas many people as they can.\n\n138\n00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.300\nSo viruses again, need our help to spread,\nworms replicate on their own.\n\n139\n00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.310\nViruses are typically harder to get rid\nof, because they're attached to files.\n\n140\n00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.960\nAnd we oftentimes have difficulty\nfiguring out which files are infected.\n\n141\n00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.690\nWe can remove some files but\nif we don't get all of them, and\n\n142\n00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.590\nthat one file gets opened up again,\nthe system's infected again.\n\n143\n00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.280\nSo they can be very tricky to eradicate.\n\n144\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.350\nWhereas a worm, because it's\na standalone file, we can usually\n\n145\n00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.670\nfind it a little bit easier and get rid of\nit, if we can get across the network or\n\n146\n00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:20.691\nphysically get to that machine to do\nsuch an investigation, all right?\n\n147\n00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:23.360\nAdware, software that\nautomatically displays or\n\n148\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.690\ndownloads unsolicited advertisements.\n\n149\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:31.000\nThis is another one that probably most\nof us out there have maybe seen once or\n\n150\n00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.435\ntwice, maybe on your own machine, right?\n\n151\n00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:37.295\nYou get little ads that pop up,\nlittle pop-ups.\n\n152\n00:07:37.295 --> 00:07:40.405\nMost of our browsers are really\ngood at blocking those.\n\n153\n00:07:40.405 --> 00:07:44.315\nAlthough now they do the pop-unders,\nit's not quite the same.\n\n154\n00:07:44.315 --> 00:07:49.625\nA lot of times adware is not malicious\nother than the fact that it distracts you.\n\n155\n00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:50.235\n&gt;&gt; It's annoying.\n\n156\n00:07:50.235 --> 00:07:50.955\n&gt;&gt; And it's annoying.\n\n157\n00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.991\nYeah, it's annoying as heck.\n\n158\n00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:56.143\nI mean, I have seen cases\nwhere the adware was very bad,\n\n159\n00:07:56.143 --> 00:08:00.369\nand even without opening up a browser,\njust reboot the machine and log on,\n\n160\n00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:03.680\nAds start popping up and\nbasically covering the desktop.\n\n161\n00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.343\nThat was an extreme case, but a lots of\ntime again adware is just more annoying\n\n162\n00:08:08.343 --> 00:08:11.520\nthan it is harmful, but\nit can slow the system down.\n\n163\n00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.060\nIt can take up resources,\nwhich is not a good thing.\n\n164\n00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.950\nAnd they're unsolicited, they can be\noffensive depending on what the product is\n\n165\n00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.330\nand if happens to be a product\nthat you find offensive.\n\n166\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.080\nSo, it's still not good.\n\n167\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.960\nSpyware is another category\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n168\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.100\nSpyware, the name pretty much tells you\neverything you need to know about that.\n\n169\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.760\nSoftware that's designed to track and\nthen report back.\n\n170\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.720\nThat could be keystroke loggers.\n\n171\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.560\nIt could track your web pages\nthat you're visiting and\n\n172\n00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.540\nsend that information off to somebody.\n\n173\n00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.720\nIt could b, taking screenshots\nperiodically of what you're doing.\n\n174\n00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.000\nEvery time you click your mouse, this\nthing takes a screenshot in the background\n\n175\n00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.970\nand starts FTPing it to a bad guy.\n\n176\n00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.530\nSo spyware can definitely be bad.\n\n177\n00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.280\nA lot of times it's not\nharmful to the machine.\n\n178\n00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.550\nBut it can be harmful to you or your\nenterprise because you type in a password\n\n179\n00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:10.750\nand now somebody has your password.\n\n180\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.320\nYou type in a bank account number and\ninformation to log in and\n\n181\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.680\nsomebody can capture that information.\n\n182\n00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.630\nSo it can be very harmful, not so\nmuch to the operating system or\n\n183\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.880\nthe computer, but to our data.\n\n184\n00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.870\nAnd it's really up to\nwhoever creates the spyware\n\n185\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.969\nwhat it is they're trying to collect.\n\n186\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.670\nThey might just want all\nyour personal pictures,\n\n187\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.760\nyou know, it just depends on\nwhat they're trying to do.\n\n188\n00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.270\nThey can turn your camera on.\n\n189\n00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.140\nYou gotta be careful with these things.\n\n190\n00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.550\nTrojan horses.\n\n191\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:42.040\nA Trojan horse, most of us are probably\n\n192\n00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.720\nfamiliar with the story of the Greeks and\nthe Trojans and how that works.\n\n193\n00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.360\nAnd it's a very similar concept and\nwhy they called it a Trojan horse.\n\n194\n00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.280\nAnd the idea is, I need to get\na malicious payload onto a system.\n\n195\n00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.900\nBut I know they're not going to click\na link if it says, hey, malicious payload.\n\n196\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.280\nClick here, right?\n\n197\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.390\nPlease infect your machine.\n\n198\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.520\nYou want all your files to be.\n\n199\n00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.235\n&gt;&gt; You'd be surprised, Mike.\n\n200\n00:10:02.235 --> 00:10:03.126\n[LAUGH] You'd be surprised.\n\n201\n00:10:03.126 --> 00:10:05.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Would you like to\ndelete all your files at once?\n\n202\n00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.700\nClick here.\n\n203\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.620\nSo usually it's a little more difficult.\n\n204\n00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.410\nSo what we do is we wrap it up.\n\n205\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.090\nRight?\n\n206\n00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.920\nA Trojan horse is software that\npretends to be something you want.\n\n207\n00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:20.102\nWhen in fact it has a malicious payload of\nsomething that you absolutely do not want.\n\n208\n00:10:20.102 --> 00:10:20.836\nAlright.\n\n209\n00:10:20.836 --> 00:10:25.650\nWe used to use a lot of those\ne-greeting cards as wrappers.\n\n210\n00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.170\nA wrapper is basically\nthe outside of the horse, itself.\n\n211\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:34.150\nAnd e-greeting cards typically\na lot of visuals, motion.\n\n212\n00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.370\nSo you might be paying attention\nthat not notice a little\n\n213\n00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.490\nflash of an icon in the system tray or\nsomething like that.\n\n214\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.070\nWhere it executing the payload and\nit's installing the back door, and\n\n215\n00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.650\nit's calling home, and\nI'm getting remote access to your system.\n\n216\n00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.460\nSo trojans appear to be benign.\n\n217\n00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.570\nYou usually have a malicious payload.\n\n218\n00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.410\nThey don't replicate,\nthey don't attach to files.\n\n219\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.460\nThey typically need to send\nit directly to you and\n\n220\n00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.745\nhopefully get you to click on something,\nalright?\n\n221\n00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:03.740\nRootkits.\n\n222\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.655\nNasty, nasty variety here.\n\n223\n00:11:06.655 --> 00:11:13.040\nRootkits infect the system\nat a very low level.\n\n224\n00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.160\nTypically down in between the kernel and\n\n225\n00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.520\nthe user mode, which means they're really,\nreally hard to detect.\n\n226\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.950\nAnd they're really,\nreally hard to eradicate or remove.\n\n227\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.760\nBut they have access to everything.\n\n228\n00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.910\nRight, if a rootkit's on your system,\n\n229\n00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.090\nbecause their in between us and\nthe kernel, they intercept calls,\n\n230\n00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.760\nwhen I'm trying to open up task manager,\nfor example.\n\n231\n00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.970\nSomething's wrong,\nmy computer's going a little bit slow or\n\n232\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.260\nI notice unusual disk or network activity,\nI wanna see what's running.\n\n233\n00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.030\nSo I open up Task Manager on a Windows\nsystem, or I run top on Linux box.\n\n234\n00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.510\nAnd I don't see anything unusual\n\n235\n00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:58.280\nbecause the rootkit is seeing\nthe call from me to Task Manager, and\n\n236\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.970\nit's intercepting that and only returning\nthe results that it wants me to see.\n\n237\n00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.100\n&gt;&gt; Nasty little buggers, aren't they?\n\n238\n00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.000\n&gt;&gt; Nasty.\n\n239\n00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.660\nI mean honestly,\n\n240\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.730\nonce you get a rootkit really the only\nway to cleanse it is to start over.\n\n241\n00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.740\nThere are a lot of cleaning\nkits out there for\n\n242\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.790\nknown rootkits that have been discovered\nand we figured out how to remove them.\n\n243\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.670\nHonestly though, if you're In any\nkind of high security environment, or\n\n244\n00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.540\nif you work with sensitive data the only\nway to really be sure it's gone\n\n245\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.000\nis to wipe the system and start over.\n\n246\n00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.248\nBecause it's underneath everything else,\nit can hide itself extremely well.\n\n247\n00:12:31.248 --> 00:12:35.260\nAlright, let's see what else we've got.\n\n248\n00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:35.900\nLogic bombs.\n\n249\n00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.605\nThese are kind of a cool one,\nif any of this malware can be cool.\n\n250\n00:12:40.605 --> 00:12:41.740\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Exactly right.\n\n254\n00:12:47.712 --> 00:12:53.172\nA logic bomb is basically, could be\na virus, but the reason it's called\n\n255\n00:12:53.172 --> 00:13:00.120\na logic bomb is because it doesn't execute\nuntil a certain set of conditions are met.\n\n256\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.582\nLike I might, create a logic bomb that's\nnot gonna fire off until July 4th,\n\n257\n00:13:04.582 --> 00:13:05.781\n2018 right.\n\n258\n00:13:08.315 --> 00:13:10.245\nWhat that does, why would I do that?\n\n259\n00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:15.555\nWhy would a create a virus that doesn't do\nanything until 2018 on a specific date?\n\n260\n00:13:16.885 --> 00:13:21.350\nIt could be because I, remember we talked\nabout the different types of bad actors.\n\n261\n00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:22.640\nCould be hacktivism,\n\n262\n00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.110\ncould be cyberterrorism and\nthat particular day has meaning.\n\n263\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.730\nOr it could be that I just want\nto give it a chance to spread and\n\n264\n00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.880\ninfect as many machines as I can.\n\n265\n00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.510\nBecause if I write my own virus,\nwhich is what a lot of these\n\n266\n00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.680\nbad actors are doing because\nof the way antivirus works.\n\n267\n00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.270\nAnd because a lot of antivirus\nis based on signatures.\n\n268\n00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.890\nYou write your own,\nit doesn't match any signatures.\n\n269\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.790\nIf I write something like that, and\nI send it to my friend Daniel here.\n\n270\n00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.533\nAnd he clicks on it his\nmachine Machines infected.\n\n271\n00:13:52.533 --> 00:13:55.670\nIf he submits to let's\nsay he's working for\n\n272\n00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.240\na company XYZ,\nthey get this infected machine.\n\n273\n00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.640\nThey take if off the network.\n\n274\n00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.935\nThey sent if off to Symantec.\n\n275\n00:14:00.935 --> 00:14:05.950\nSymantec analyzes it or any other\nanti-virus manufacturer or vendor.\n\n276\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.570\nThey analyze it.\n\n277\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.440\nThey find it.\n\n278\n00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.810\nThey write a signature for\nit, a definition for it.\n\n279\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.550\nIt now goes out and I'm done, right?\n\n280\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.820\nI infected a whopping one\nmachine with hours and\n\n281\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.140\nhours and hours of code I spent on it.\n\n282\n00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.672\n&gt;&gt; Good for you.

and\nstart this thing spreading.\n\n285\n00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.270\nWe're gonna put a date on here or\nsome kind of condition.\n\n286\n00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.690\nThat'll give it time to spread

00:14:37.350\nhundreds of thousands of\nmachines rather than one machine.\n\n290\n00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.390\nThat's the idea behind a logic bomb.\n\n291\n00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.160\nAnd it could be done like\nthe one I have planted here.\n\n292\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.175\nDid I just say that on camera?\n\n293\n00:14:46.175 --> 00:14:48.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well all it does is it scans\n\n294\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:53.870\nthe payroll database and if my name, every\nweek it checks, and if my name is missing,\n\n295\n00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.280\nthen it kicks in and it starts wiping\nout the systems here on the network.\n\n296\n00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.360\n&gt;&gt; It's a good way to\nkeep your job though.\n\n297\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.140\n&gt;&gt; That's an example though of\nwhat a logic bomb could do.\n\n298\n00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.870\nLooking for some kind of condition and\n\n299\n00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.200\nthen only executing if that\ncondition becomes true.\n\n300\n00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.130\nAll right what else,\nransomware this is something that is\n\n301\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.770\nbecoming much more prevalent.\n\n302\n00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.680\nAs you're watching this,\nas we're recording this, anyway,\n\n303\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:26.100\nthe number of ransomware events\nis increasing dramatically.\n\n304\n00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.610\nAnd unfortunately, they're getting\nbetter and better at doing it.\n\n305\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:34.290\nBut the idea behind ransomware is\nit's going to infect your machine and\n\n306\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.900\nit'll restrict access to files\non your machine, some files,\n\n307\n00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.080\nall your files, encrypts them basically.\n\n308\n00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:47.350\nAnd then you get the email that says, hey,\nlook, or something pops up on your screen\n\n309\n00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:52.540\nand it says, hey, look,\nyour data has been [LAUGH] put on hold.\n\n310\n00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.499\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or is inaccessible unless you send us\n\n311\n00:15:55.499 --> 00:15:59.225\n$1000 or 2 bitcoins or\nsomething like that.\n\n312\n00:15:59.225 --> 00:16:02.965\nThey're holding your data ransom and\neither you pay them And\n\n313\n00:16:02.965 --> 00:16:08.145\nthen they should give you the decryption\nkey to get access to your data again.\n\n314\n00:16:08.145 --> 00:16:10.620\nOr you don't pay them, and\nyou hope you've got a backup and\n\n315\n00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.830\nyou have that backup is relatively recent,\nso that you haven't lost too much data.\n\n316\n00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.890\nBut that's the idea.\n\n317\n00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.540\nThey want you to pay via PayPal or\nBitCoin or\n\n318\n00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.440\nsome other way that makes it\nreally hard to trace back to them.\n\n319\n00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.750\nAnd it's, ike I said it's becoming,\nit's one of the growing threats\n\n320\n00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:35.420\nin our networks today because\nit just takes one user\n\n321\n00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.270\nto click on a link in an email to\nstart it up, to get infected, and\n\n322\n00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:44.300\nthen it gets on our system and\nhit on my mail server or my file server.\n\n323\n00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.340\nAnd it starts encrypting everything,\n\n324\n00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.550\nand depending again on when\nmy last backups were made.\n\n325\n00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.590\nCan I just roll back and\n\n326\n00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:00.040\nlose the last 12 hours of data or\nam I gonna have to pay these guys.\n\n327\n00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.910\nYou can have them analyze sometimes\nthe ones that aren't as good\n\n328\n00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.560\nthrough analyzing the malware itself.\n\n329\n00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.600\nThey might find the key needed to decrypt.\n\n330\n00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.610\nYou could get the government involved, the\nFBI, like you're in the states, involved.\n\n331\n00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:15.810\nHave them analyze it,\nsee if they can find the key.\n\n332\n00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:20.860\nBut if you're a small business,\nI'm a two person business, or\n\n333\n00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:27.000\nI'm a little lawyer's shop, or\nI'm a school and I get infected with that,\n\n334\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.520\nI don't have the resources probably to\ncall in the FBI, I don't have the time.\n\n335\n00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.270\nI might end up just paying it and\nunfortunately,\n\n336\n00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:40.470\nthat's what a lot of organizations do\nwhich makes it even more profitable for\n\n337\n00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.160\nthe bad guys,\nwhich means they're gonna do it more.\n\n338\n00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.130\nHey this works, we're gonna do it more.\n\n339\n00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.590\nLet's do it to another company and\nmake it better.\n\n340\n00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.900\nAnd that's what we're seeing now is\nunfortunately people are just paying\n\n341\n00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.010\ncuz they don't wanna deal with it.\n\n342\n00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:56.660\nThey don't wanna deal with the getting\nlaw involved, bring them in.\n\n343\n00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.180\nAnd investigation because it's\nembarrassing to them, because they let\n\n344\n00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.140\nthis happen as far as the IT staff goes,\nthey can feel a sense of responsibility.\n\n345\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.140\nIt's embarrassing to the organization.\n\n346\n00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.090\nAnd if this gets out to the news,\nI might lose business, right.\n\n347\n00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.190\nPeople are not going to be willing to come\nto my site and put their credit card in\n\n348\n00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:17.980\nif I was just plastered across the news\nas being affected with malware.\n\n349\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.430\nOther businesses that I have partners with\n\n350\n00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.830\nmight be a little less likely to do\nbusiness with me because they're afraid\n\n351\n00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.140\ntheir networks are gonna get infected\nbecause of what's happened to me.\n\n352\n00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.740\nSo things like that can cause problems.\n\n353\n00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.690\nSmall organizations a lot of times\njust end up paying the ransom ware.\n\n354\n00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.740\nYeah, unfortunately.\n\n355\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.560\nAnd then a new one that\nLogical Operations threw one on me.\n\n356\n00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.950\nThis is a malvertisement.\n\n357\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.010\n&gt;&gt; Hm, that's new to me as well.\n\n358\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.230\n&gt;&gt; Malvertisement, yes.\n\n359\n00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.680\nThat's the one that we've plugged\nin a couple of words, malware and\n\n360\n00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.710\nadvertisement.\n\n361\n00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:52.710\nSimply means I'm gonna deliver\nthe malware via advertisement, all right?\n\n362\n00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.243\n&gt;&gt; I thought the advertisement\nwas the malware.\n\n363\n00:18:55.243 --> 00:18:57.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it can be if it's spyware.\n\n364\n00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.345\n&gt;&gt; I just hate advertisements.\n\n365\n00:18:59.345 --> 00:19:00.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But like, especially nowadays,\n\n366\n00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.900\nwhere ads follow you around.\n\n367\n00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.280\nSo you go to a webpage and\nthey've got banners down the side.\n\n368\n00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.030\nAnd I was just looking for\nbookcases the other day, and\n\n369\n00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.210\nsure enough there's an advertisement for\nbookcases.\n\n370\n00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.190\nAnd these are dynamically\ndriven advertisements\n\n371\n00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.970\nbased on your surfing habits.\n\n372\n00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:16.910\nEverybody's tracking you.\n\n373\n00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.250\nYou gotta keep remember that.\n\n374\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.440\nAnd those are what they can infect.\n\n375\n00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.060\nSo very similar to spyware,\nnot quite the same.\n\n376\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.530\nAll right,\nlet's see what else we want to do.\n\n377\n00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.135\nHow are we on time?\n\n378\n00:19:28.135 --> 00:19:28.810\nBut anyway, looking all right?\n\n379\n00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:29.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're doing all right.\n\n380\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.340\nI think we got a good ten.\n\n381\n00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.620\n&gt;&gt; All right, some more terms then I\nwanna talk about before we jump in to our\n\n382\n00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.120\nlittle demonstration.\n\n383\n00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.460\nSupply chain attack.\n\n384\n00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.670\nThis is where when we look at\na supply chain, we're talking about\n\n385\n00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:48.040\nend to end process, manufacturing,\ndistribution, vendor, consumer, right?\n\n386\n00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.150\nYou got your suppliers\nof your raw materials.\n\n387\n00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.530\nPeople that put it together,\npeople that distribute.\n\n388\n00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.430\nPeople that sell it and\nthen people that buy it.\n\n389\n00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.510\nThat's kind of a supply chain.\n\n390\n00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:02.540\nAnd the idea behind a supply chain attack\nis the target might be the vendor,\n\n391\n00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.010\nor even the consumer, at the very end.\n\n392\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.980\nBut where I'm gonna launch my attack\nis actually back at the manufacturer.\n\n393\n00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:13.160\nBecause I can't attack that\nconsumer directly, or not as easy.\n\n394\n00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.840\nMaybe I find that I can attack\nthe manufacturer, and I can\n\n395\n00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.920\ndo some type of attack on him that's going\nto be passed down the supply chain, right?\n\n396\n00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.680\nImagine what would be a good example?\n\n397\n00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:33.210\nMaybe I manufacture, I don't know, laptops\nor I was trying to give a better example.\n\n398\n00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.040\nCameras.\n\n399\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.170\nMaybe I manufacture cameras for\nputting on your computer.\n\n400\n00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.660\nIf I can get to the people,\n\n401\n00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.840\nI can in fact the company that's\nmanufacturing the cameras.\n\n402\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.870\nBut what if I can go to the supplier\nof the chips for those cameras and\n\n403\n00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:53.060\nsomehow get access to their systems and\nembed some code in there somehow?\n\n404\n00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.330\nThey sell those chips to\nthe camera manufacturers.\n\n405\n00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.620\nThe camera manufacturers puts them\ntogether, sells them to the vendors or\n\n406\n00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.740\ndistributes it out to the vendor.\n\n407\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.430\nThe vendor then sells it to the consumer.\n\n408\n00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.890\nDaniel buys that camera, takes it home,\nplugs it into his desktop at home so\n\n409\n00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.020\nhe can do video calls with Grandma and\nshow off to kids.\n\n410\n00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:15.000\nUnbeknownst to him, there's a back door in\nthat camera that I can now get into and\n\n411\n00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.160\nturn his camera on any time I want.\n\n412\n00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.790\n&gt;&gt; And that seems pretty high profile too,\nto be able to do something like that.\n\n413\n00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.910\nSo I'm assuming that's not\na very common form of attack but\n\n414\n00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.360\nit is something that we\nneed to be aware of.\n\n415\n00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.490\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I haven't seen a lot of\nit although depending on who you talk\n\n416\n00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.350\nto there's different ways of\nlooking at a supply chain attack.\n\n417\n00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:37.430\nLike Target recently,\n2013 here in the US it's a what\n\n418\n00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:40.980\ndo you call them a retail\nstore big box retail.\n\n419\n00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.900\nThey got compromised and\n\n420\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:48.010\nlost hundreds of thousands of customer\ninformation, credit card information.\n\n421\n00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.680\nAnd by doing analysis on post\nattack analysis and looking at it,\n\n422\n00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.320\nthey found that it was originally,\nit was actually compromised, their POS,\n\n423\n00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.840\ntheir point of sale system was\ncompromised through an HVAC vendor.\n\n424\n00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.444\nAnd the HVAC vendor for\n\n425\n00:22:02.444 --> 00:22:07.778\nTarget had access to Target's system's\nto control their HVAC remotely.\n\n426\n00:22:07.778 --> 00:22:12.840\nSomeone was able to get a password\nto one of the accounts at the HVAC.\n\n427\n00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.120\nSo they weren't attacking Target directly.\n\n428\n00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.660\nThey went into this HVAC vendor for\n\n429\n00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.100\nTarget, through them\nwere able to compromise.\n\n430\n00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:26.510\nNot quite how I described a supply\nchain attack but same idea, right?\n\n431\n00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.530\nI can't get to the target but, that target\nhas relationships with other targets.\n\n432\n00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.800\nThese other targets are not nearly secure.\n\n433\n00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.560\nTarget went with a vendor, I have access\nto that vendor, I can attack them.\n\n434\n00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.030\nA lot of companies, I'm not saying\nTarget did this, off that topic.\n\n435\n00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:45.390\nA lot of times, companies will look for\nthe less expensive route right.\n\n436\n00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.720\nThey're willing to cut\ncorners in certain places,\n\n437\n00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.810\nhey we can get these people to do this.\n\n438\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.060\nThey're really good,\nthey've got a great reputation.\n\n439\n00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.122\n&gt;&gt; And they're the lowest bidder.\n\n440\n00:22:53.122 --> 00:22:54.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or we can get these people\n\n441\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.350\nthat are the lowest bidder.\n\n442\n00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.530\nMaybe not quite as, their reputation's\nnot known, not as vetted.\n\n443\n00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.550\nWe're gonna go with\nthe lowest bottom line.\n\n444\n00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.710\nUnfortunately, they're running theirs\nout of the back of their house and\n\n445\n00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.190\nthey've got two XP machines, right?\n\n446\n00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.660\nBecause you didn't go and\nexplore and examine those.\n\n447\n00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.450\nYou don't know what they've got.\n\n448\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.750\nThat could be the weak link\nnow to get into your system.\n\n449\n00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.640\nSo that's the idea behind\na supply chain attack.\n\n450\n00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:24.600\nAnother term that they throw\nout here is watering hole.\n\n451\n00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.900\nAnd a watering hole is really,\nwhat's a good way to describe it, if I\n\n452\n00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.990\nwanna attack a company, but I can't attack\nthat company directly for some reason.\n\n453\n00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.300\nI can't find a way in, can't find\na vulnerability to take advantage of,\n\n454\n00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:42.010\ndon't have the skill set,\nwhat I can do is find out where say,\n\n455\n00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.640\nthe employees like to hang out.\n\n456\n00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.740\nI notice that every day after work,\n\n457\n00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.320\na group of employees goes over here and\nhangs out.\n\n458\n00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.660\nOr a lot of the employees for\n\n459\n00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.812\nthis organization visit this particular\nwebsite cuz it's related to what they do.\n\n460\n00:23:55.812 --> 00:23:57.405\nSo what I can try to do\nis infect that website.\n\n461\n00:23:57.405 --> 00:24:03.071\nAnd therefore infect those employees,\nand therefore get my foot in the door.\n\n462\n00:24:03.071 --> 00:24:03.805\nOn that organization.\n\n463\n00:24:03.805 --> 00:24:05.140\nSo that's a watering hole.\n\n464\n00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:09.023\nYou think of the Serengeti and\nthe alligator sits on the watering hole,\n\n465\n00:24:09.023 --> 00:24:12.520\nright, the little pool of water\nthere that he knows every animal\n\n466\n00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.610\nout there has to come to at some point.\n\n467\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:15.850\n&gt;&gt; It's a crocodile.\n\n468\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:16.653\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n469\n00:24:16.653 --> 00:24:17.709\n&gt;&gt; It would be a crocodile in\n\n470\n00:24:17.709 --> 00:24:18.460\nthe Serengeti, yes.\n\n471\n00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.300\nSo that's the idea behind a watering\nhole though is rather than me go and\n\n472\n00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.490\ntry to attack them wait until they\ncome to me and attack them there.\n\n473\n00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.710\nRight?\nFind out where they like to go,\n\n474\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.030\nwhere they like to hang out.\n\n475\n00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.655\nAlright, so I'll tell you what,\nlet's do a little exercise here.\n\n476\n00:24:33.655 --> 00:24:38.635\nKeep in mind, if you guys want to try\nthis on your own, logical operations in\n\n477\n00:24:38.635 --> 00:24:43.085\nITPro TV, has a little webpage you can\ngo too where you can get access to\n\n478\n00:24:43.085 --> 00:24:49.225\nthe courseware, to the lab set ups.\n\n479\n00:24:49.225 --> 00:24:50.095\nSo take a look at that.\n\n480\n00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.620\nI am gonna fire up my,\nif I can find it, my XP box.\n\n481\n00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.470\nAnd we're gonna do a little\ndemonstration on malware.\n\n482\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.690\nAll right, so let's do this.\n\n483\n00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:03.860\nI've got my XP box here, and\n\n484\n00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:08.950\nwhat I'm gonna do is I am going\nto turn off Windows Defender.\n\n485\n00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.450\nCuz Windows Defenders pretty good.\n\n486\n00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.120\nIt's an anti-virus software,\nanti-malware software.\n\n487\n00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.600\nIt does a good job and\nit has real time protection and\n\n488\n00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.500\nit's gonna be really difficult to\ndemonstrate an infection if we have it on.\n\n489\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.890\nSo I'm going to go into my settings,\nclick on Update and Security,\n\n490\n00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:28.400\ngo over to Windows Defender, and\nI'm gonna turn off real time protection.\n\n491\n00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.960\nSo then I think that's the only\none I really need to turn off.\n\n492\n00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.530\nReal time protection means as I open\nfiles it's going to look at them and\n\n493\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.260\ntry to keep me safe.\n\n494\n00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.410\nTurn that off.\n\n495\n00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.520\nI can still do scheduled scans,\nif I have those scheduled.\n\n496\n00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.200\nI can do on demand scans.\n\n497\n00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.180\nIt's not gonna access or\ntry to scan anything as I open it.\n\n498\n00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:49.870\nSo I'll turn that off.\n\n499\n00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:57.658\nThen I'm gonna go out to this website, and\nI don't know if you can see that there?\n\n500\n00:25:57.658 --> 00:26:02.291\nIt's eicar.org and what they've got\nis some files that are going to mimic\n\n501\n00:26:02.291 --> 00:26:05.460\nan infection, they're not actual viruses.\n\n502\n00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.639\nBut they will trick our system hopefully.\n\n503\n00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.071\nSo I'm gonna open that and\ndownload this file.\n\n504\n00:26:14.293 --> 00:26:15.830\nIt's thinking about it, there we go.\n\n505\n00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.710\nAnd I'll go ahead and save that.\n\n506\n00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:23.010\nAnd I'm gonna open it up,\nopen up just the folder, right?\n\n507\n00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:26.140\nAnd now what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna right-click on that and\n\n508\n00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.066\nchoose Scan with Windows Defender.\n\n509\n00:26:28.066 --> 00:26:32.700\nAnd uh-oh, not good.\n\n510\n00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.280\nWhat's new in Windows Defender?\n\n511\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.862\nYeah, it's saying hey, you should\nreally turn me on, you big dummy.\n\n512\n00:26:36.862 --> 00:26:39.474\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because you just opened up a virus,\n\n513\n00:26:39.474 --> 00:26:40.320\nso let me try to help you out.\n\n514\n00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.930\nI'm gonna close that, I'm gonna\nignore it like most users would do.\n\n515\n00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:47.294\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is a real life\nscenario here we're talking about.\n\n516\n00:26:47.294 --> 00:26:47.962\n&gt;&gt; It is [LAUGH].\n\n517\n00:26:47.962 --> 00:26:51.900\nI don't know what that's saying, you love\nall the IT jokes, and they're jokes,\n\n518\n00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.090\nthey're funny, but\nIt's cuz they're based in truth.\n\n519\n00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.994\nAnd someone calls you up and says, hey,\n\n520\n00:26:55.994 --> 00:27:00.440\nlook, I've got some kind of pop-up on\nhere; it's telling me something's wrong.\n\n521\n00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.930\nWell, what does it say exactly?\n\n522\n00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:04.768\nI don't know, I clicked okay.\n\n523\n00:27:04.768 --> 00:27:05.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n524\n00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.640\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n525\n00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.920\nAlright, so\nhere we see scan completed on three items.\n\n526\n00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:13.530\nThe app detected a potential threat,\nso let's take a look at what it found.\n\n527\n00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.530\nWe're going to show details and\n\n528\n00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.810\nhere I can see it found something\nthat it sees as a virus and\n\n529\n00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:26.300\nmost antivirus, anti malware software is\nsimilar it'll give you a severity level.\n\n530\n00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:30.630\nThis is all based on definitions,\nif this particular stuff\n\n531\n00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:35.080\nwhich means the anti-virus\nsoftware manufacturers,\n\n532\n00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.370\nvendors, they find these viruses,\nthey write definitions.\n\n533\n00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.280\nHey, this is what the virus looks like.\n\n534\n00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:45.540\nThis is the code, and so if you see\na file that has this code in it flag it.\n\n535\n00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.530\nSo when your system opens it up your\nanti-virus softwares are analyzing that.\n\n536\n00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.199\nIf it matches one of its definitions,\nit's saying wait that's a virus.\n\n537\n00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:59.320\nAnd then those definitions have severity\nlevels typically associated with them.\n\n538\n00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.410\nSo they've already, at the antivirus\nsoftware company they've already said,\n\n539\n00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:04.730\nhere's your definition.\n\n540\n00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:09.530\nAnd in the definition it says whether\nthis is low, medium, high or severe,\n\n541\n00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:10.710\nnot severe, what have you.\n\n542\n00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.660\nSo you see this one is flagged as severe.\n\n543\n00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.180\nStatus is showing as active and\nthen my recommended action is remove.\n\n544\n00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:17.840\nRight?\n\n545\n00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.730\nNow lets click show details here and\nyou can see this program is dangerous and\n\n546\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.470\nreplicates by infecting other files.\n\n547\n00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:26.520\nIt says I really should\nremove it immediately.\n\n548\n00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.150\nIt tells me where it is on my system,\nright?\n\n549\n00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:34.830\nBut I actually don't have to go find it,\nbecause like most antivirus software,\n\n550\n00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:35.740\nI can apply actions.\n\n551\n00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.550\nSo whatever I've chosen up here,\nMove, Quarantine, or Allow.\n\n552\n00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:43.440\nRemove is actually gonna go in and\nhopefully remove the infected file,\n\n553\n00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:48.850\nprevent any type of infection on\nmy system, quarantine isolates it.\n\n554\n00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:50.670\nSo all right, I'm going to set it aside.\n\n555\n00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:54.760\nIt maybe the file that comes up\nhere is a very important file.\n\n556\n00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.440\nAnd I'd like to try to clean the file,\nremove the virus from the file.\n\n557\n00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.750\nSo maybe I just want to quarantine it or\nmaybe I want to allow it.\n\n558\n00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.340\nYou might think, what,\nwhy would you ever allow something?\n\n559\n00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.990\nWell, in the security world a lot\nof the tools that we work with\n\n560\n00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.870\nare gonna be flag as viruses.\n\n561\n00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.410\nSo, it might catch something and\nyou say no, no, no that's okay.\n\n562\n00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.250\nI know what it is and I allow it.\n\n563\n00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:25.180\nPassword crackers, a lot of your web\nattack tools and stuff like that.\n\n564\n00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.390\nWill show up as a virus.\n\n565\n00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.560\nBecause they can be used for\nmalicious intent,\n\n566\n00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:33.380\nthey match definitions that are in that\nantivirus database and they're flagged.\n\n567\n00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.550\nMost software like this will let you have.\n\n568\n00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.870\nAn exclusion folder.\n\n569\n00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.140\nDaniel, you probably have one,\n\n570\n00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.120\nI know I have a folder on my drive\nthat I put a lot of these tools in.\n\n571\n00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.750\nAnd I've told my antivirus software hey,\n\n572\n00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.850\nignore that folder,\nI don't even want you looking in there.\n\n573\n00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:52.690\nBecause I have gone through this,\nI have had a nice collection of tools,\n\n574\n00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:56.600\nsome password crackers\nthat I had collected, and\n\n575\n00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.890\nthen I think I reinstalled our\nupgraded operating system,\n\n576\n00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.950\nnew anti-virus software on there and\nit did a scan.\n\n577\n00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.490\nI wasn't even thinking about it.\n\n578\n00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.300\nIt does a scan eventually and\nwiped that whole floor out.\n\n579\n00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.330\nJust cleaned it.\n\n580\n00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.005\n&gt;&gt; It said, what is this,\nthis is horrible.\n\n581\n00:30:11.005 --> 00:30:12.475\nI'll get rid of that for you, don't worry.\n\n582\n00:30:12.475 --> 00:30:13.265\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, gone.\n\n583\n00:30:13.265 --> 00:30:16.425\nAnd now you gotta go find all\nthat stuff again, if you can.\n\n584\n00:30:16.425 --> 00:30:17.825\nOr hopefully you've got a back up of that.\n\n585\n00:30:17.825 --> 00:30:20.615\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nsay, yep, I agree.\n\n586\n00:30:20.615 --> 00:30:23.095\nThat is a bad thing, I don't want it.\n\n587\n00:30:23.095 --> 00:30:25.845\nIt's named virus, can't be good.\n\n588\n00:30:25.845 --> 00:30:27.396\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick Apply Action.\n\n589\n00:30:29.447 --> 00:30:31.730\nAnd hopefully, we get green lighted.\n\n590\n00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:36.350\nWe'll see if it's able to\nsuccessfully remove that virus.\n\n591\n00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:39.340\nAnd this is, again, this is the way\nmost antivirus software is gonna work,\n\n592\n00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.560\nor anti-malware.\n\n593\n00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.360\nKeep in mind,\na couple things I want to throw out there,\n\n594\n00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.090\nespecially if you're newer\nto the security world.\n\n595\n00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:51.550\nWhen you talk about anti-spyware software,\nIt's focused on spyware.\n\n596\n00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.740\nIt's not gonna help you with viruses.\n\n597\n00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.950\nI've seen people, end users,\nthat we have to educate.\n\n598\n00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.610\nThat think, well I'm running this\nanti-spyware, so I should be safe.\n\n599\n00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:06.500\nNo, you got to make sure you're\ngetting antivirus protection.\n\n600\n00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.130\nAnd really anti-malware is kind of,\nagain, that all encompassing term.\n\n601\n00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.200\n&gt;&gt; And plus new viruses and\ntypes of malware come out\n\n602\n00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.930\non a daily basis, so\n&gt;&gt; Just because you have\n\n603\n00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.220\nan antivirus system,\nanti-malware system in place.\n\n604\n00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.070\nDoesn't mean that it's got that latest and\ngreatest.\n\n605\n00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:23.400\nYou have to make sure to make\nit update on a regular basis,\n\n606\n00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.140\nso that you're always as\nup-to-date as possible.\n\n607\n00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.160\n&gt;&gt; Extremely important,\n\n608\n00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.430\nbecause they discover new\nviruses as you said, every day.\n\n609\n00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.120\nThey're writing new definitions every day.\n\n610\n00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.450\nSo yes.\nLet your anti virus software update\n\n611\n00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:35.620\nevery day.\n\n612\n00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.690\nWhy be at risk of catching a virus when\nthere was a definition put out last week.\n\n613\n00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:44.690\nYou don't want to go out to the boss and\nsay, look, we lost half our data.\n\n614\n00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:45.570\nWhat happened?\n\n615\n00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.970\nWell, we got this virus.\n\n616\n00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.350\nWhat happened to our anti virus software?\n\n617\n00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.500\nYes, they've already got a definition for\nit.\n\n618\n00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.530\nI just didn't update the software.\n\n619\n00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that is not gonna be\na good- Not a good answer, no.\n\n620\n00:31:54.546 --> 00:31:57.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, there we see I'm green.\n\n621\n00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.070\nI'm good to go.\n\n622\n00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.640\nI'll close that.\n\n623\n00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.140\nI could run another scan,\nbut I'm not going to.\n\n624\n00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.040\nWe can see that it is greenlighted now.\n\n625\n00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.410\nSo, yeah, keys there make sure\nyou're keeping your antimalware,\n\n626\n00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.490\nantivirus software up to date.\n\n627\n00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:16.410\nAlso, some of the newer types of antivirus\ndo a little more than just definitions\n\n628\n00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:21.080\nbased they'll look at behavior, they can\nlook at traffic that's being generated and\n\n629\n00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.880\ngo something's not right there.\n\n630\n00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:28.110\nTalking about heuristic detection, that's\nactually looking at the behavior not just\n\n631\n00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:31.850\na straight up signature and even then the\nheuristics would help with this but like\n\n632\n00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:35.760\nsignature based you can keep it up to date\nas you want it's no guarantee you're safe.\n\n633\n00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.020\nAlways remember what we call a zero day\nattack you might be the fortunate one that\n\n634\n00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.510\nis the first one to get infected with this\nor amongst the first ones to get infected,\n\n635\n00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:47.770\nand the antivirus vendors haven't\nhad a chance to analyze it and\n\n636\n00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.110\nwrite a definition for it.\n\n637\n00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.100\nUnfortunately, there's nothing\nyou can do about that.\n\n638\n00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.496\n&gt;&gt; You can buy a lottery ticket that day,\ncuz you lucky.\n\n639\n00:32:53.496 --> 00:32:54.172\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n640\n00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:54.680\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike,\n\n641\n00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.310\nyou've done a great job of\nexplaining what malware is,\n\n642\n00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:01.950\nthe different types of malware that is out\nthere that we have to be aware of, and\n\n643\n00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.200\nthen of course,\n&gt;&gt; The steps for remediation.\n\n644\n00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.910\nWhat can we do to prevent from\ngetting malware on our systems.\n\n645\n00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:10.160\nAll very important tasks as\nsecurity professionals, or\n\n646\n00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.450\neven just a computer user,\nto be honest with you.\n\n647\n00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.870\nAnybody that has a computer, turns it on,\nand attaches it to the internet.\n\n648\n00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:19.550\nThese are concepts and\npractices you need to be aware of.\n\n649\n00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.710\nMike, anything else we need to\ncover before we call the show off?\n\n650\n00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.170\nNo, stay safe out there.\n\n651\n00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.420\nPractice safe surfing habits.\n\n652\n00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.125\nDon't click on links that you\ndon't know where they came from.\n\n653\n00:33:29.125 --> 00:33:30.615\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No drunk browsing everybody.\n\n654\n00:33:30.615 --> 00:33:34.020\n[LAUGH] That being said, it looks like\nit's that time for us to sign off.\n\n655\n00:33:34.020

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:13.983\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:16.900\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.180\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, well that's right.\n\n7\n00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.670\nIt's more on our cfr series the good\nold cyber sec first responders that is.\n\n8\n00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.810\nAnd of course joining me in the studio\nto lend his vast knowledge,\n\n9\n00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.190\nto that very topic is our good friend Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.120\nMike welcome back sir.\n\n11\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.245\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much,\nthanks for having me back and\n\n12\n00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:36.025\nyeah we're gonna as you say continue on.\n\n13\n00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:41.169\nIn this one we're gonna be looking at\nwhat we call man-in-the-middle attack,\n\n14\n00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:42.950\nor MitM, for short.\n\n15\n00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.010\nYou might see that abbreviation now and\nagain.\n\n16\n00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.560\nCapital M, little i, little t, capital M.\n\n17\n00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.823\nAnd go,\nwhat the heck are they talking about?\n\n18\n00:00:48.823 --> 00:00:50.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Did they mistype M&amp;Ms?\n\n19\n00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.700\nThat is one of my favorite candies.\n\n20\n00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.088\nNo, no,\nit's a type of doctors abbreviation for.\n\n21\n00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.291\nSo, man in the middle.\n\n22\n00:00:56.291 --> 00:01:02.120\nAnd the name kind of really tells\nyou a little bit about the attack.\n\n23\n00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.900\nRight, man in the middle.\n\n24\n00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.960\nThat's maybe not politically correct,\n\n25\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.480\nwe should say person in the middle,\ncuz it can definitely be a woman as well.\n\n26\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.290\nBut, the idea is that bad actor is\ngonna get in-between a conversation.\n\n27\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.430\nSit in the middle, right.\n\n28\n00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.980\nImagine an end user, and they are\nconnecting to their financial institution,\n\n29\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.470\nto check on their bank accounts, or\npay bills, or whatever the case may be.\n\n30\n00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.610\nAnd me as the bad actor,\nwhat I would like to do,\n\n31\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.130\nis try to get in-between them and\nhave that conversation go through me.\n\n32\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.090\nAll right, so they can still talk to the\nbank, the bank can still talk to them, but\n\n33\n00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.080\nI'm gonna sit in between\ntheir conversation.\n\n34\n00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.050\nAnd what that means that I can do\nas a bad actor, I can just view,\n\n35\n00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.360\nI can do what we call passive\nman in the middle attacks,\n\n36\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.450\nwhere I'm just viewing\nthe data as it goes by.\n\n37\n00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.520\n&gt;&gt; Seems like a form of\nwire tapping almost,\n\n38\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.690\nwhere you're just kind of tapping in and\nlistening to the conversation.\n\n39\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.360\nSo it should get\nthe information that you want.\n\n40\n00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.040\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely right.\n\n41\n00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.470\nThat's really exactly what you're doing.\n\n42\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.950\nYou get to see it all go by.\n\n43\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.320\nThat would be passive.\n\n44\n00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.100\nIf you want to do an active man in\nthe middle, we can even modify that data.\n\n45\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.680\nThere are applications we can get,\nthat will allow me to kind of\n\n46\n00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.220\npause the conversation or pre-made some\npackets, and try to slip them in there.\n\n47\n00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.562\nOr modify packets again as they go by.\n\n48\n00:02:20.562 --> 00:02:25.710\nIn between my manager and the boss, I get\nthat email that says, hey we need to fire\n\n49\n00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.734\nMike, and I modify it a little bit, and\nI say, hey we need to give Mike a raise.\n\n50\n00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.374\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And pass it on, right.\n\n51\n00:02:33.374 --> 00:02:36.760\n&gt;&gt; Why is Mike still here,\n[LAUGH] What's he doing?\n\n52\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.295\n&gt;&gt; Came back for my red stapler.\n\n53\n00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:39.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n54\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.630\nSo that's the idea behind\nman in the middle.\n\n55\n00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.750\nAnd man in the middle attacks\ncan be tricky to pull off.\n\n56\n00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.270\nBut, there are a lot of tools out there,\nthat take the heavy lifting,\n\n57\n00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.490\nas Daniel likes to say\nout of the equation.\n\n58\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.380\nAnd then it becomes really simple.\n\n59\n00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.320\nMost of those cost a little bit of money.\n\n60\n00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.300\nBut, there's other ways to go about doing,\na man in the middle.\n\n61\n00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.560\nAnd so,\nsome terms we need to be familiar with.\n\n62\n00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.110\nAnd we'll talk a little bit about\na couple of the methods here.\n\n63\n00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.880\nAnd then we'll do a little\ndemonstration on one way,\n\n64\n00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.960\nthat we might be able to perform\na man in the middle attack.\n\n65\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.390\nSpoofing, impersonation,\nand hijacking, all right.\n\n66\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.550\nTerms we need to be familiar with.\n\n67\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.730\nWe need to understand\nthe difference between those terms.\n\n68\n00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.370\nBecause, sometimes spoofing and\nimpersonation, people will come and\n\n69\n00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.550\ntry to use them interchangeably.\n\n70\n00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.640\nWe're talking about\nsecurity computer systems.\n\n71\n00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.618\nThey definitely have different meanings.\n\n72\n00:03:29.618 --> 00:03:34.420\nSpoofing is gonna be typically\na software based attack,\n\n73\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.700\nwhere I try to take over the identity.\n\n74\n00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.250\nOf a user, of a service,\nof a computer, of something like that.\n\n75\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.240\nI'm gonna pretend,\n\n76\n00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.470\nI want the network to think I'm the DNS\nserver that everybody's supposed to use.\n\n77\n00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.930\nI'm not, I'm the bad guy.\n\n78\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.480\nBut I'm gonna spoof, I'm gonna pretend\nto the network and say, hey, I'm Mr.\n\n79\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.820\nDNS server, come talk to me, right.\n\n80\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.420\nThat'd be the idea behind spoofing.\n\n81\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.490\nOr you can forge IP address to spoof, and\n\n82\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.840\nmake it look like you are a node\nthat belongs on the network.\n\n83\n00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.110\nEven though you're coming from the outside\ninterface on that router, you've got\n\n84\n00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.560\nan address that looks like all the other\nmachines on the local area network.\n\n85\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.330\nMaybe the router doesn't pay attention,\n\n86\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.678\nthe rules aren't set up correctly,\nallows it to come through.\n\n87\n00:04:13.678 --> 00:04:20.470\nImpersonation is human-based attack,\nI guess you could say.\n\n88\n00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.640\nThat's when I'm gonna pretend\nto be somebody I'm not.\n\n89\n00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.690\nThis is me putting on the jumpsuit,\nthe work suit, the overalls.\n\n90\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.590\nAnd coming in and\n\n91\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.070\nsaying, hey I'm here to work on your\nair conditioning in the server closet.\n\n92\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.010\nRight, can you show me the way,\nopen the door?\n\n93\n00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.790\nThat would be impersonation.\n\n94\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.190\nA lot of times, impersonation is\ndone remotely, like phone calls.\n\n95\n00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.310\nYou call up,\nyou say you're from the help desk, and\n\n96\n00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.130\nyou try to get somebody\nto give you information.\n\n97\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.600\nYou're impersonating\na help desk personnel.\n\n98\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.920\nSo, it's a social engineering type attack,\nbut\n\n99\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.530\nyou're using impersonation\nto try to accomplish that.\n\n100\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.665\nAnd in large companies where\nyou don't know everybody,\n\n101\n00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:03.251\nit's relatively easy to do, especially if\nyou can drop a couple of names in there.\n\n102\n00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:08.223\nPeople are, when they can't\nverify your identity easily,\n\n103\n00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:12.807\nthey're usually more likely\nto give you information.\n\n104\n00:05:12.807 --> 00:05:16.900\nRight, I know it sounds weird but\nI don't know.\n\n105\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.600\nIt sounds like the guy from the help desk.\n\n106\n00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.300\nI think Joe is one of\nthe guys on the help desk.\n\n107\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.740\nI don't want to embarrass myself,\nand say who are you?\n\n108\n00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.980\nYeah, yeah here's my user name.\n\n109\n00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.080\nHere's my password, kind of thing.\n\n110\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.371\n&gt;&gt; Prey on our insecurities, right?\n\n111\n00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:31.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n112\n00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.450\nAnd then people's desire to be liked,\nto be helpful, to get praise.\n\n113\n00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.750\nIt's a really cool psychological\njourney going into the world of social\n\n114\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.528\nengineering, if you're\ninto that kinda thing.\n\n115\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.440\nAll right, so that's impersonation.\n\n116\n00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.650\nAnd then session hijacking, is when I\ntry to take over an existing session.\n\n117\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.980\nA lot of times man-in-the-middle attacks,\n\n118\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.680\nare precursors to session\nhijacking attacks.\n\n119\n00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.950\nWhere I can maybe get in\nbetween the conversation, and\n\n120\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.880\nthen knock the other end off and\ncontinue to talk to server,\n\n121\n00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.550\nit thinking that I was the person\nthat I knocked offline, right?\n\n122\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.570\nSo, taking over a session, sometimes\nthat's the easier route to go for\n\n123\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.690\nthe bad guys.\n\n124\n00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.260\nAnd rather than try to break into your\naccount, get your information so that I\n\n125\n00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.010\ncan authenticate as you, how about I just\nwait until you authenticate, push you out\n\n126\n00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.650\nof the way, step in your place, and you've\nalready done the authentication, right.\n\n127\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.140\nSo, now I can kinda take over\nthat conversation, all right.\n\n128\n00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.610\nSo, those are the terms we need\nto be familiar with, spoofing,\n\n129\n00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.100\nimpersonation, session hijacking.\n\n130\n00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.723\nNow, let's talk about some of\nthese different spoofing methods.\n\n131\n00:06:33.723 --> 00:06:36.531\nThere's different protocols\nthat we can do this with, or\n\n132\n00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:38.920\ndifferent ways we can go about spoofing.\n\n133\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.790\nA common one that we see is ARP spoofing.\n\n134\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.980\nARP, if you remember back to your Network+\ndays, your Address Resolution Protocol.\n\n135\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.350\nAnd if we think about\nthe way networks work,\n\n136\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:55.220\nthe way data is transmitted using\nTCP/IP on an ethernet based network,\n\n137\n00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.150\nwe know that the packets get routed\nvia the network address, right.\n\n138\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.140\nSo, it's looking at the network address,\nand\n\n139\n00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.660\nit's looking at the routers figuring\nout what the best route to go is.\n\n140\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.880\nThey finally get into\nthe local area network.\n\n141\n00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.470\nThat network, whatever that network\nID is it gets to the network.\n\n142\n00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.970\nOnce the router gets it to that network,\n\n143\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:21.070\nthe last leg of the journey is\nactually done using the MAC address.\n\n144\n00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.580\nSo IP, the IP portion of TCPIP,\n\n145\n00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.930\nthe IP protocol, internet protocol\nis gonna call upon ARP and say,\n\n146\n00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:33.470\nhey look what is the MAC address for\n10.1.2.3?\n\n147\n00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:39.380\nAnd ARP is a broadcast-based,\nthe node that has that, which should\n\n148\n00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.630\nbe able to hear it, because remember\nbroadcast, limited to that subnet, but\n\n149\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.380\nwe've already made it to the destination\nnetwork, so that node should hear this.\n\n150\n00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.010\nAnd that node should respond and\nsay hey, that's me.\n\n151\n00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.122\nMy MAC address, that's me, 10.1.2.3.\n\n152\n00:07:51.122 --> 00:07:57.327\nHere's my MAC address, and then the packet\ncan make the final leg of the journey.\n\n153\n00:07:57.327 --> 00:08:01.910\nThe ARP information is cached by\nthe nodes, they keep a little ARP table.\n\n154\n00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.800\nAnd the ARP is not a real secure protocol.\n\n155\n00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.760\nIt wasn't designed to be secure.\n\n156\n00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.370\nAnd unfortunately what nodes do\nis they hear these ARP requests,\n\n157\n00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.320\nbecause they're broadcasts,\nthey hear the replies, and\n\n158\n00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.000\nthey all start caching this information,\nor they can.\n\n159\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.490\nBut they'll cache,\nwhen they get a response, they cache that.\n\n160\n00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.810\nAnd if they get another response,\nthey'll cache that and\n\n161\n00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.190\nthey'll overwrite the original cache.\n\n162\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.840\nLike if, well in our case,\nwe're gonna try to do some spoofing.\n\n163\n00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.450\nWe might change that IP address to the\nsame MAC address and when that node hears\n\n164\n00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.060\nit, and goes to cache it, he's like wait,\nI already have that MAC address.\n\n165\n00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.800\nI'll just override it you know.\n\n166\n00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.280\nIf it was the same IP address and\nMAC address.\n\n167\n00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.990\nOr well, I'll show you.\n\n168\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.300\nWe'll take a look at it and\nI'll give you a better view.\n\n169\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.730\nIt's hard to kind of describe that,\nbut that's what ARP spoofing is about,\n\n170\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:53.610\ntrying to convince the network that my MAC\naddress is what goes with that IP address.\n\n171\n00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:58.080\nThe packet might have been destined for\nthe IP address of the server, right.\n\n172\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.690\nBut what I'm gonna do is\nlet the network know that,\n\n173\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.150\nhey, that Mac address goes to\nmy IP address, not the servers.\n\n174\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.640\nThen the packet will get delivered to me.\n\n175\n00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.470\nBecause, I'm going to respond and\nsay, that's my IP address.\n\n176\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.520\nHere's my Mac address,\nand let it come over.\n\n177\n00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.850\nAll right.\n\n178\n00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.610\nSo, ARP spoofing.\n\n179\n00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.310\nThen, as far as what we can do\nwith ARP Spoofing or protecting or\n\n180\n00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.620\nlitigating their risks?\n\n181\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.840\nIt's not a lot that we can do.\n\n182\n00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.130\nYou can make the ARP table static.\n\n183\n00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.660\nYou can tell it to where it's not\nallowed to overwrite and cache that.\n\n184\n00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.830\n&gt;&gt; Give it that whole dynamic ARP\nupdating thing that they have built in.\n\n185\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which eliminates that thread.\n\n186\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.610\nBut it also is a bare to\nmanage because as you add new\n\n187\n00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.940\nnodes you got to make sure those\nare entered into that arc table.\n\n188\n00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.370\nAnd if anything changes,\nthat's got to be updated.\n\n189\n00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.620\nSo it's It's really difficult\nto do that a lot of times.\n\n190\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.210\nIf they are going to do this, they'll do\nit on just specific nodes that people\n\n191\n00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.560\nmight be trying to attack by file servers,\nby DNS servers.\n\n192\n00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.110\nI'll just do it on those,\nnot on every one on the network.\n\n193\n00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.700\nEven then, it can be a little\nbit of a bear to manage.\n\n194\n00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.700\nYou can create subnets because\nARP is a broadcast protocol then\n\n195\n00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.430\nthey won't go beyond the subnet.\n\n196\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.660\nSo I can't spoof anything\non a different subnet.\n\n197\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.170\nIt's only gonna work on the subnet I'm on.\n\n198\n00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.990\nIt doesn't help the subnet I'm on but\nit does help the rest of my network.\n\n199\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.970\nInstead of one big network we\ncreate several subnets and\n\n200\n00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.550\nit mitigates that risk a little bit.\n\n201\n00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.350\n&gt;&gt; You just did a little clever\nadministration there with your\n\n202\n00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.470\nnetwork and you can.\n\n203\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.420\nLike you said,\nmitigate that down to not being such\n\n204\n00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.260\nan atom bomb inside of your network.\n\n205\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.130\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, because I really need\nto do spoofing on both ends.\n\n206\n00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.260\nI need to convince the client\nthat I'm the server.\n\n207\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.510\nI need to convince the server\nthat I'm the client.\n\n208\n00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.850\nIf those guys are on different subnets,\n\n209\n00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.120\nhow can I spoof both of\nthem at the same time?\n\n210\n00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.060\nThat's going to be challenging there.\n\n211\n00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.820\nYou can also set up your IDS,\nyour intrusion detection systems,\n\n212\n00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:59.870\nto maybe start monitoring for\nmultiple ARP change requests,\n\n213\n00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.480\nupdates to caches to look for\nabnormal activity there.\n\n214\n00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.970\nAll right another one we need to worry\nabout is good old DNS poisoning.\n\n215\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.280\nAnd with DNS poisoning.\n\n216\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.370\nThere's DNS poisoning and DNS hijacking,\n\n217\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.080\nI wanna make sure we understand\nthe difference between the two.\n\n218\n00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.590\nWith DNS poisoning,\nwe're actually attacking the DNS server.\n\n219\n00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:24.370\nOr we're using the DNS server\nto facilitate our attack,\n\n220\n00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.100\nis probably a better way to say it.\n\n221\n00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.910\nWhat I'm gonna do, and\nif you're not familiar with the way\n\n222\n00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.210\nDNS works you should probably\ngo do a little research on that.\n\n223\n00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.550\nBut the short version is,\nwhen you send a query,\n\n224\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.210\na question to your local DNS server.\n\n225\n00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.970\nAnd if it's not authoritative for that\nnamespace, it's not your organization,\n\n226\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.090\nyou're trying to connect to Google,\nor Microsoft,\n\n227\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.820\nor Ebay, or something like that.\n\n228\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.680\nYour DNS server who is not authoritative\nhas to go find the IP address for\n\n229\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.310\nthe destination you're looking for.\n\n230\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.060\nAnd he does that by talking\nto a series of hosts or\n\n231\n00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.070\nDNS servers out there on the internet.\n\n232\n00:11:55.070 --> 00:12:00.530\nAnd what we can try to do is send\n\n233\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:06.160\na query to our DNS server for some fake\ndomain, all right, just some made up name.\n\n234\n00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.750\nWell, it's not gonna be authoritative for\nit.\n\n235\n00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.750\nAnd it's gonna have to go and\ntalk to the root servers and\n\n236\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.430\nthe other top level DNS servers\nout there on the internet.\n\n237\n00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:17.480\nAnd what we're gonna try to do is before\nit gets the answer back from those guys\n\n238\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.020\nout there on the internet,\nwe're gonna provide the answer.\n\n239\n00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.070\nAnd we're gonna give it the answer to\nthe fake domain that we made up, but\n\n240\n00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.560\nin the answer, we're gonna include\nother answers for real domains,\n\n241\n00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.700\nall right, but wrong IP addresses.\n\n242\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.340\nIPs that point back to my malicious\nservers and the DNS server that gets\n\n243\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.450\nthe answer is like, thanks for\nthe answer for fake domain.com.\n\n244\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.410\nAnd I see there's other answers in here,\nI might as well go ahead and cache those,\n\n245\n00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.710\ntoo, and he dumps them into his cache.\n\n246\n00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.560\nAnd then when your user\ntries to go to that domain,\n\n247\n00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.100\nthat real domain,\nit's got the wrong information and\n\n248\n00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.380\nit ends up redirecting the client\nto a malicious server.\n\n249\n00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.530\nSo that's DNS poisoning,\npoisoning the records up there on DNS so\n\n250\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.910\nthat we're giving out bad\ninformation to the intended victim.\n\n251\n00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.740\nThen I might have malware loaded up\non the site I redirect them to and\n\n252\n00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.560\ninfect them, and we're good to go.\n\n253\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.270\nDNS hijacking, we're not actually\nattacking the DNS server.\n\n254\n00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.260\nWe're gonna hit the victim,\n\n255\n00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.080\nthe client, we're gonna try to\nchange their TCP/IP settings.\n\n256\n00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.480\nWhich I can use software to do that, I can\nattack that machine and try to do that.\n\n257\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.930\nAnd if I can change the DNS\nserver that a client is using.\n\n258\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.740\nWell, now I can control all\nthe answers that he gets, right?\n\n259\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.350\nBecause he's going to quoting\nmy server for DNS information.\n\n260\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.980\nI can tell him whatever I want, and\nhe's just going to get with it.\n\n261\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.640\nHe's going to trust that its\ninformation is accurate, and\n\n262\n00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.450\nnow it can lead him to a site that\nlooks just like Bank of America.\n\n263\n00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.270\nHe can try to put in his username and\npassword.\n\n264\n00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.210\nI can just capture that information.\n\n265\n00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.380\nDangerous thing if I can control\nwhat someone's using for DNS, so\n\n266\n00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.420\nthat's DNS hijacking.\n\n267\n00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.500\nWe also have ICMP redirect.\n\n268\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:02.090\nThis is ICMP, internet control message\nprotocol, it's a protocol we use.\n\n269\n00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.050\nYou guys have used ping before, right?\n\n270\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.870\nThat's a type aid, an echo request,\nbut there's several different.\n\n271\n00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:12.220\nThere's actually 40 different\ntypes of ICMP messages and\n\n272\n00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.730\nthe use from all kinds of things, internet\ncontrols, message protocol, each used for\n\n273\n00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.230\ntroubleshooting, and more than that.\n\n274\n00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.320\nType five is actually\nyour redirect message.\n\n275\n00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.049\nAnd so, when you're communicating\nwith the gateway aboard the router\n\n276\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.270\nIt's directing your packets\nto the destination.\n\n277\n00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.200\nThey're trying to find the best hop,\nthey're using their\n\n278\n00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.890\nalgorithms to figure out the best path,\nthe best next hop in the path.\n\n279\n00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.640\nIf they find that they're\nno longer the best path,\n\n280\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.520\nthey will send an ICMP type five redirect.\n\n281\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.780\nSay hey look, I'm gonna go ahead and\nforward these packets on, but\n\n282\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.650\nthe rest of them,\nyou should just send this way.\n\n283\n00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.620\nIt's gonna be much faster\nthan going through me.\n\n284\n00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.740\nRouters use these messages to remap\ntraffic trying to find their best and\n\n285\n00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.730\nfastest route.\n\n286\n00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:02.410\nIf I can modify that routing table again,\nI can route you through\n\n287\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:06.240\nsomething that I have control of and\nnow I can start monitoring that traffic,\n\n288\n00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.750\npossibly even modifying, monitoring,\nand or modifying that traffic.\n\n289\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.380\nOr it can send you in a dead end,\nand do a denial of service on you.\n\n290\n00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.570\nWhere your packet just don't\nmake it to the destination.\n\n291\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.670\nSo that's a ICMP redirect\ntype of ICMP message.\n\n292\n00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.280\nThen there's good old DNS spoofing.\n\n293\n00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.960\nAnd DNS, I'm sorry DNS.\n\n294\n00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.180\nWe already talked about DNS poising,\nDNS hijacking.\n\n295\n00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.110\nDHCP spoofing.\n\n296\n00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.940\nDHCP, I'll get that out eventually.\n\n297\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.430\nDynamic host configuration protocol.\n\n298\n00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.730\nAnd we know, we should know at this point,\n\n299\n00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:44.800\nthat DHCP is used to automate\nthe assignment of TCP/IP information.\n\n300\n00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.761\nIP address, subnet mask,\ndefault gateway, DNS, and\n\n301\n00:15:47.761 --> 00:15:50.225\nseveral other options\nthat we can configure.\n\n302\n00:15:50.225 --> 00:15:54.504\nWe could automate that process,\nthe client calls up the DHCP server,\n\n303\n00:15:54.504 --> 00:15:56.692\nhe supplies all that information.\n\n304\n00:15:56.692 --> 00:16:04.730\nWell Again, same kind of thing, If I can\nset up what we call a rogue DHCP server.\n\n305\n00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.100\nI might be able to provide that\nconfiguration information to the client,\n\n306\n00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.120\ninstead of the actual DHCP server.\n\n307\n00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:17.116\nAnd it's a real issue at DHCP, because\nDHCP works it's an unsecured protocol,\n\n308\n00:16:17.116 --> 00:16:20.200\nand it really can't be secured too much,\n\n309\n00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.567\nbecause of the way it works and\nwhen it works.\n\n310\n00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:27.445\nAll right, DHCP, a client starts up and\nit's talking to a DHCP server,\n\n311\n00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.650\nit's using broadcast to do that.\n\n312\n00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.470\nBecause it doesn't have\nconfiguration information yet.\n\n313\n00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.550\nSo, it cannot do any unicast traffic.\n\n314\n00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.700\nSo, it just hollers out on the network,\nhey, I'm looking for an IP address.\n\n315\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.344\nAre there any DHCP servers out there?\n\n316\n00:16:40.344 --> 00:16:43.880\nAny DHCP server that hears that,\nwe'll then respond with an offer.\n\n317\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.300\nHey, here's an IPA\ninformation you can use.\n\n318\n00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.550\nHere's another GHP server,\nhere's some information you can use.\n\n319\n00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.270\nWell, the client doesn't\nlook at the offers and\n\n320\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.500\nsay, I like even numbers better.\n\n321\n00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.940\nI think I'll take this one.\n\n322\n00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.640\nIt's the first one that gets to him.\n\n323\n00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.850\nWhichever one comes in first, that's\nthe over it's going to attempt to take.\n\n324\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:07.963\nSo, if I can situate myself in\nthe network, to where there's a shorter\n\n325\n00:17:07.963 --> 00:17:13.007\npath between the node and me, and\nthe node and the actual DHCP server.\n\n326\n00:17:13.007 --> 00:17:17.170\nMy response will get there first,\nand therefore it'll accept my offer.\n\n327\n00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.880\nAnd that means I can give it the IP\naddress that I want it to use,\n\n328\n00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.500\nthe DNS server I want it to use,\nthe gateway I want it to use, all of that.\n\n329\n00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.740\nSo, we can simply do denial of service,\nor you can just say hey,\n\n330\n00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.170\nI'm gonna give you an IP address\nthat's not valid on the network.\n\n331\n00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:32.387\nWe can do any number of things or\nwe can give it a bad gateway, so\n\n332\n00:17:32.387 --> 00:17:36.787\nit can't get off the network,\ngive it a bad DNS server address.\n\n333\n00:17:36.787 --> 00:17:39.630\nSo, that we can do our DNS hijacking,\nall right?\n\n334\n00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:43.825\nSo, you can see how some of these\nattacks kinda blur together, right.\n\n335\n00:17:43.825 --> 00:17:46.547\nWhat do we do about DHCP smoofing?\n\n336\n00:17:46.547 --> 00:17:49.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThis is a new term we're gonna define\n\n337\n00:17:49.085 --> 00:17:53.055\nright here on ITProTV,\na new addition to the English language.\n\n338\n00:17:53.055 --> 00:17:56.905\nA smoofing is not correct,\nspoofing would be correct.\n\n339\n00:17:56.905 --> 00:17:57.920\nWhat do we do about it?\n\n340\n00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.245\nWel,l a lot of routers these days,\n\n341\n00:18:01.245 --> 00:18:06.450\nwe can configure them to where DHCP\noffers are not allowed to go through.\n\n342\n00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.630\nRequests can come out of that port, but\n\n343\n00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:09.990\noffers are not gonna\ncome out of that port.\n\n344\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.670\nBecause if I've got a switch, and\nit's going out through the enterprise, and\n\n345\n00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.650\ndown to the wall plates, and\nI've got nodes plugged in there,\n\n346\n00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.890\nthere shouldn't be any DHCP\nservers on any of those ports.\n\n347\n00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.350\nSo, I can tell those ports hey,\n\n348\n00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:27.980\nlook, don't allow DHCP\noffers to come through here.\n\n349\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.470\nIt's called DHCP snooping,\n\n350\n00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:35.082\nis typically what we're enabling on\nthose switch ports or those routers.\n\n351\n00:18:35.082 --> 00:18:40.010\nAll right, I shouldn't say\nrouters it's DHCP switches or.\n\n352\n00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:45.520\nNot DHCP but switch ports were\ndoing the DHCP snooping on.\n\n353\n00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.560\nI'm trying to go a little too fast.\n\n354\n00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.840\nI need to slow down.\n\n355\n00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.910\nAnd this is a real problem.\n\n356\n00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.480\nEven just the denial of service\naspect of this type of attack.\n\n357\n00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.020\nI've had it happen on\na network that I worked at\n\n358\n00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.775\nwhere I don't believe it was intentional.\n\n359\n00:18:57.775 --> 00:19:01.355\nBut somebody in a classroom of computers,\n\n360\n00:19:01.355 --> 00:19:06.715\nsomebody had installed VMWare, or\nit might have been VirtualBox.\n\n361\n00:19:06.715 --> 00:19:12.600\nAnd the program allows you to provide DHCP\nto your virtual machines that you create.\n\n362\n00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.550\nBut if configured,\nyou can go into the configuration and\n\n363\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.750\nyou can actually have it listen\non the physical network adapter,\n\n364\n00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:22.300\nwhich is the adapter of the machine\nthat Virtual Box was running on.\n\n365\n00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.820\nSo, what was happening was, they had\nchosen that option, either accidentally or\n\n366\n00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.400\nmaliciously.\n\n367\n00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.760\nAnd if you think about it, here's\ntwo computers in a classroom, right?\n\n368\n00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.360\nThis computer wants an IP address, so\nit sends out this discover packet.\n\n369\n00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.340\nIt goes to the switch, it's a broadcast.\n\n370\n00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.060\nNow from the switch, that broadcast has\nto make it over to the other subnet,\n\n371\n00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.510\nwhere the actual DHCP server is.\n\n372\n00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.680\nIt's gotta go out to the DHCP server,\nand then back.\n\n373\n00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.330\nBut in the meantime,\nwhile that's going out,\n\n374\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:53.230\nthe initial broadcast hits the switch,\nthe broadcast goes out all ports.\n\n375\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.290\nIt means it came right back out the other\nport to the other node in the classroom,\n\n376\n00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:57.400\nand he heard the broadcast too.\n\n377\n00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.270\nAnd it's running DHCP,\nand it made an offer.\n\n378\n00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.590\nAnd so, it turned around and\noffered it, and\n\n379\n00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.820\nthat offer made it back, before it\nmade it to the original DHTP server.\n\n380\n00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.835\n&gt;&gt; What's fun is when they're\nboth in the same IP range.\n\n381\n00:20:07.835 --> 00:20:11.335\n[LAUGH] I've got a good IP,\nI don't know what the problem is.\n\n382\n00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It'll drive you crazy trying\n\n383\n00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.598\nto find that rogue DHTP server and\nshutting it down, I mean,\n\n384\n00:20:16.598 --> 00:20:19.422\nyou basically have to start\ndoing Packet captures and\n\n385\n00:20:19.422 --> 00:20:23.204\nsee where the offers are coming from,\ntry to discover the IP address.\n\n386\n00:20:23.204 --> 00:20:28.570\ncuz we, I know when we first saw it,\nwe were getting nodes on our\n\n387\n00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.050\nnetwork were getting IP addresses, that\nwere in some range that we weren't using.\n\n388\n00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.860\nAnd of course,\nthey then couldn't get out of the network,\n\n389\n00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.990\ncuz they had invalid IP configuration.\n\n390\n00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:40.540\nAnd so the first thing we do, is just shut\neverything down, turn everything back on,\n\n391\n00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.530\nhopefully killing any process that might\nhave been running that was doing this.\n\n392\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.290\nOf course, they had their VMware\nset up to run as a service, so\n\n393\n00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.430\nit boots up automatically\nwhen we reboot the machine,\n\n394\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.750\ndidn't even have to be logged in and\nit was responding.\n\n395\n00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.710\nAnyway, long story just to\nsay it's a real concern.\n\n396\n00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.820\nIt's something that we\nlook at all the time.\n\n397\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.800\nLooking for DHTP cuz rogue DHCP servers\ncan be nasty on a network, and there's so\n\n398\n00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.510\nmany of them.\n\n399\n00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.230\nAnd people don't think about it,\nthat's the thing is\n\n400\n00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:10.850\nthat user brings in a wireless access\npoint and plugs it in behind their desk,\n\n401\n00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:16.230\nnot realizing that little WRT54G\n&gt;&gt; Is providing DHCP, right?\n\n402\n00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.310\nSo, it's really easy to get one on your\nnetwork, and even unintentionally.\n\n403\n00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.225\nAnother one is a NetBIOS\nname service spoofing.\n\n404\n00:21:25.225 --> 00:21:28.980\nNowm this is one that's not\nas common anymore because,\n\n405\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.000\nwell NetBIOS isn't as common anymore,\nright?\n\n406\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.460\nWe try to avoid that with\neverything we've got.\n\n407\n00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.850\nNetBIOS was an older naming\nresolution protocol,\n\n408\n00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:41.520\nthat did a lot of broadcast in its\nresolution, its communications.\n\n409\n00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.030\nSo we, once DNS came out,\nslowly phased NetBIOS out.\n\n410\n00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.999\nBut it's still there, It's still\nout there, It's still being used.\n\n411\n00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.460\nIf a user ends up putting\nin an unqualified name.\n\n412\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.488\nRemember, with DNS,\nthe query had that's formulated,\n\n413\n00:21:57.488 --> 00:21:59.960\nhas to be in the form of\nfully qualified domain name.\n\n414\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.300\nIn other words, you can't just\nsend the query to DNS and say,\n\n415\n00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.990\nwhat's the IP address of Google?\n\n416\n00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.140\nIt has to be,\nwhat's the IP address of Google.com?\n\n417\n00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.500\nYou can't say what the IP\naddress of file one?\n\n418\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.299\nIt has to be, what's the IP address of\nfile one dot lab dot IT product TV?\n\n419\n00:22:13.299 --> 00:22:15.560\nHave to use the full name of the computer.\n\n420\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.970\nWhat we call the full\nqualified domain name.\n\n421\n00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.950\nIf it's not, DNS says,\nI can't do anything with it.\n\n422\n00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.820\nI don't know what the top level domain is.\n\n423\n00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.325\nWe're gonna stop right there.\n\n424\n00:22:24.325 --> 00:22:26.570\nNetBIOS deals with unqualified names.\n\n425\n00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.990\nBecause, it's a flat\nname resolution protocol.\n\n426\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.150\nThe idea is, with NetBIOS name spoofing.\n\n427\n00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.720\nWe can, if somebody types in Google.\n\n428\n00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.080\nWell, the crest goes to DNS, DNS says,\nthat's not a properly formed query,\n\n429\n00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.355\nI'm gonna ignore it.\n\n430\n00:22:42.355 --> 00:22:45.250\nTherefore, if you're running a NetBIOS\nname server on your network,\n\n431\n00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:47.995\nit will will pick up that query,\nand it will respond.\n\n432\n00:22:47.995 --> 00:22:51.605\nBut what the bad guy is gonna do is\nrespond first, hopefully before,\n\n433\n00:22:51.605 --> 00:22:56.865\nin the bad's mind, hopefully before\nthe actual NetBIOS name server responds.\n\n434\n00:22:56.865 --> 00:22:58.505\nHe'll just say, hey I'm Google.\n\n435\n00:22:58.505 --> 00:23:00.085\nHere's the IP address.\n\n436\n00:23:00.085 --> 00:23:04.923\nAnd he gives him an IP address, that\npoints the victim to a malicious server.\n\n437\n00:23:04.923 --> 00:23:08.448\nAnd then the malicious server downloads,\nor supplies all the malware,\n\n438\n00:23:08.448 --> 00:23:10.660\nthat the client would ever want.\n\n439\n00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.545\nSo, that's the idea.\n\n440\n00:23:12.545 --> 00:23:16.880\nThen attack to me, is something actually\nI haven't dealt with personally.\n\n441\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.790\nAnd it seems, I don't know.\n\n442\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.439\nI'm sure.\n\n443\n00:23:20.439 --> 00:23:21.620\n&gt;&gt; Low on the probability list.\n\n444\n00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.481\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n445\n00:23:22.481 --> 00:23:24.780\nCuz what are the odds that somebody.\n\n446\n00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.490\nCuz I've got to be thinking,\nwhat are people gonna type in.\n\n447\n00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.580\nAs an unqualified name.\n\n448\n00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.960\nAnd then somebody actually\nhas to type that name in.\n\n449\n00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.920\nI can maybe be sniffing and\nlooking for things like that, and\n\n450\n00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.340\nthen be really quick.\n\n451\n00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.470\nHave packets ready to go to respond.\n\n452\n00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:43.860\nBut, I would think that would\nbe difficult to take out.\n\n453\n00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.730\nBut evidently it is a problem.\n\n454\n00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.380\n&gt;&gt; Be aware of it.\n\n455\n00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.359\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we should be aware of it,\nall right?\n\n456\n00:23:49.359 --> 00:23:55.308\nSession hijacking, as I said before,\nis really just taking over a session.\n\n457\n00:23:55.308 --> 00:23:57.515\nThere's different ways to do this.\n\n458\n00:23:57.515 --> 00:24:02.127\nWhen you look at a TCP/IP conversation\nthere's sequence numbers in\n\n459\n00:24:02.127 --> 00:24:05.190\nthose packets and then those requests.\n\n460\n00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.400\nAnd they should be in order.\n\n461\n00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.350\nWe've got synchronization,\nacknowledgement requests.\n\n462\n00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.500\nWe've got our sequence number for\nthe packets.\n\n463\n00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.220\nAnd there's an order they go.\n\n464\n00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:20.310\nNow way back in the day, those\nsequence numbers were one, two, three.\n\n465\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.430\nWhat comes after three?\n\n466\n00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.500\nFour, five-\n&gt;&gt; 17.\n\n467\n00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.430\n&gt;&gt; Yes, 17, [LAUGH] all right.\n\n468\n00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.650\nSo it was easy to predict, so\n\n469\n00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.120\nwhat I could do is I could try\nto step in the conversation.\n\n470\n00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.950\nAnd I can knock this guy offline,\nand step in his place and\n\n471\n00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.370\ntake over that conversation.\n\n472\n00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.080\nBut I better have my\nsequence number right.\n\n473\n00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.880\nOtherwise, when my packet gets to\nthe other end of the conversation,\n\n474\n00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.140\nit's gonna say, wait a second,\nwe were on one, two, three, four.\n\n475\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.660\nI was expecting five and you sent 20,\nsomething's not right here, all right?\n\n476\n00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.466\nSo, we need to be able to predict that\nsequence number and way back when,\n\n477\n00:24:49.466 --> 00:24:52.053\nit was a lot easier because we\nused incremental sequence numbers.\n\n478\n00:24:52.053 --> 00:24:56.880\nIt might have been ten, 20, 30, 5,\n10, 15, 1, 2, 3, what have you.\n\n479\n00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.960\nNowadays we're much smarter than that.\n\n480\n00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.180\nAnd there's actual algorithms that'll\ngenerate those sequence numbers.\n\n481\n00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.240\nThey're not just one, two, three anymore.\n\n482\n00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.100\nBut that doesn't mean\nthere can't be a pattern.\n\n483\n00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.620\nYou look at a famous\nattack by Kevin Mitnick,\n\n484\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.590\nthe one that he got in all the trouble for\nand went to jail for.\n\n485\n00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:19.140\nOne of the first hackers to really be\nprosecuted, make a big deal of it.\n\n486\n00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.260\nThe attack that he did\ncompromised a machine.\n\n487\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:27.910\nI'm going to forget the guy's name now,\nShimomura, I can't remember the name.\n\n488\n00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the guy that caught him.\n\n489\n00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the one that actually got-\n&gt;&gt; The Japanese fellow, yes.\n\n490\n00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.210\nI know, it's, I can see his face.\n\n491\n00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.960\nHe used to wear glasses, got a big long\npony tail, I can't think of his name.\n\n492\n00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.560\n&gt;&gt; I can't think of his\nname to save my life.\n\n493\n00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:44.730\nBut anyway, the attack was actually\naccomplished by doing that,\n\n494\n00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.670\nby being able to predict\nthe sequence numbers.\n\n495\n00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:54.558\nAt that time it was 128,000 and\nthe next it would be what 240, 256, 2000.\n\n496\n00:25:54.558 --> 00:26:00.430\n256,000, they were still incremental,\nthere was a pattern to them.\n\n497\n00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:04.010\nAnd he was able to deduce that pattern and\nthen forge packets and\n\n498\n00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.288\njump into a conversation.\n\n499\n00:26:05.288 --> 00:26:12.140\nSo session hijacking, again,\ntaking over an existing conversation.\n\n500\n00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.730\nWe could use cross-site scripting, right?\n\n501\n00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:17.840\nSteal somebody's cookie and\ntry to bump them out.\n\n502\n00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.690\nIt's Tsutomu Shimomura.\n\n503\n00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:21.880\nShimomura.\n\n504\n00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.610\nShimomura, there you go.\n\n505\n00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:24.370\n&gt;&gt; That's the guy.\n\n506\n00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:29.060\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully we said that correctly or\npronounced that close.\n\n507\n00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.500\nDifferent tools that we can use for\nhijacking and\n\n508\n00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.650\nspoofing, Hping and\nNmap believe it or not.\n\n509\n00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:36.280\nNmap, Caine and Abel.\n\n510\n00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.900\nEttercap, which is one we're gonna\nuse in our demo here in a minute.\n\n511\n00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:45.660\nThose are for spoofing, Hping,\nI can create packets with it.\n\n512\n00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.610\nNmap, a lot of those programs will\nallow you to spoof your IP address.\n\n513\n00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:52.090\nYou can run a scan, but there's\na switch I can use with it to say hey,\n\n514\n00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:56.300\nwhen you send this port scan packets out,\ndon't put my address as the source.\n\n515\n00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.900\nPut this address as the source so\nwe can hide ourselves.\n\n516\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.172\n&gt;&gt; Don't implicate,\nimplicate the guy next to me.\n\n517\n00:27:03.172 --> 00:27:04.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And all the sudden\n\n518\n00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.810\nyou're in your cubicle and the guy next to\nyou, SWAT team comes in, takes him down.\n\n519\n00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.920\nAnd you're like,\nhe must have done something bad.\n\n520\n00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.592\n[LAUGH] Session hijacking, cookie catcher,\n\n521\n00:27:14.592 --> 00:27:18.460\nDroidSheep [LAUGH], Cookie Monsters,\nI love the names they have to come up.\n\n522\n00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:18.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very clever.\n\n523\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.870\n&gt;&gt; There's so many tools they have\nto get creative with them, and\n\n524\n00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.790\nthey do, they really do.\n\n525\n00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.600\nAll right Daniel, I do wanna do\na demonstration, but I'm looking at\n\n526\n00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.660\nthe clock and I think you're getting\nready to tell me but we are out of time.\n\n527\n00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, you know, it's funny,\nis that I was looking at the clock,\n\n528\n00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.510\nwe actually are out of time.\n\n529\n00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.750\nSo, welcome to reality,\nit's a fun fun thing.\n\n530\n00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:41.050\nThat being said, we will have to\nclose the show, but like Mike said,\n\n531\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.440\nhe's definitely got a demonstration.\n\n532\n00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.530\nWe don't want to just talk about what this\nman in the middle stuff looks like, right,\n\n533\n00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.600\nwe want to show you what it looks like.\n\n534\n00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.630\nSo you take this theory we've\ndone here in part one and\n\n535\n00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.940\nwe're gonna apply it in part two,\nsee it practically work itself out.\n\n536\n00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.720\nSo definitely join us for that one.\n\n537\n00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.030\nBut Mike you are correct,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n538\n00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:02.020\nSo looks like it's time for\nus to sign off from ITProTV.\n\n539\n00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.870\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n540\n00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:04.720\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n541\n00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.633\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n542\n00:28:05.633 --> 00:28:13.016\n[MUSIC]\n\n543\n00:28:13.016 -->

00:00:08.367\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:10.594\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:13.320\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome back to ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.295\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan, and\nin today's episode we're coming back at\n\n7\n00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:21.435\nyou with more of the logical\noperation CyberSec First Responder.\n\n8\n00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:24.175\nAnd joining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n9\n00:00:24.175 --> 00:00:25.215\nMike how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:26.455\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:28.970\nExcited to be continuing on\nwith our logical operations,\n\n12\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.080\nCyberSec First Responder, and\n\n13\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.860\nin this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at Wireless and DoS attacks.\n\n14\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.970\nWhat kind of things we face\nwith our wireless networks.\n\n15\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.570\nWe'll talk a little bit about\nDenial of Service, as well.\n\n16\n00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.480\nBoth wired and wireless really.\n\n17\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.060\nSo let's start with wireless.\n\n18\n00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.270\nWhen it comes to wireless attacks.\n\n19\n00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.730\nOne of the things we're gonna call on\nin the objectives is wireless cracking,\n\n20\n00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.820\nwhich is where we're really\ntrying to break the password for\n\n21\n00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.210\nconnecting to those wireless networks.\n\n22\n00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.540\nBeing able to then connect to those\nwireless networks and gain access\n\n23\n00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.390\nto the corporate network or whatever\nthat wireless network is attached to.\n\n24\n00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.230\nLots of different tools you can use for\nthis.\n\n25\n00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.390\nWe Same techniques that we use for\nworking with, say, password dumps,\n\n26\n00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.870\nwhere you've got dictionary-based attacks,\nyou have brute force attacks.\n\n27\n00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.860\nYou can do the same thing\nwith the wireless networks,\n\n28\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.360\nlots of different tools out there,\n\n29\n00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.580\nfree and commercial, that will facilitate\ncracking these wireless networks.\n\n30\n00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.380\nLike, Aircrack is probably one of\nthe most popular ones out there.\n\n31\n00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.195\nIt'll help you crack those WEP and\nWPAs, as a matter of fact.\n\n32\n00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.660\nAirSnort was one that's been around for\na while.\n\n33\n00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.360\nI believe they pulled support for\nthat, but\n\n34\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.040\nI think you can still get it out there.\n\n35\n00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.170\nCain and\nAbel was another big password cracker.\n\n36\n00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.280\nI can't remember if it was in this show or\nthe other shows, but Cain and\n\n37\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.290\nAbel has been around for\na long time, Password Cracker,\n\n38\n00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.770\nworks with wireless packet or\npasswords as well.\n\n39\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.820\nWhat was another one I wanted to mention?\n\n40\n00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.020\nWEP Attack, and older one that you can\nuse, Cloud Cracker, there's a lot of\n\n41\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.790\ndifferent tools out there that will help\nme try break into those wireless networks.\n\n42\n00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.720\nSo, WPA2 is a protocol\nthat is relatively secure.\n\n43\n00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.400\nWe've got good encryption algorithms\nin there and the problem with that is\n\n44\n00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.090\npeople will go ahead and turn on WPA,\nwhich is the Wi-Fi protected setup.\n\n45\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.770\nAnd the WPA has like an eight\npin password associated with it.\n\n46\n00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.700\nWhich is not too terribly hard to break.\n\n47\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.680\nThere's not that many\npossibilities associated with that.\n\n48\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.360\nSo, you can take something that's\nvery strong, implement WPA and\n\n49\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.270\nreally kill all of your\nsecurity associated with it.\n\n50\n00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.500\nSo when we talk about wireless attacks,\npassword cracking is the big thing.\n\n51\n00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.580\nTrying to get the keys to\nbreak the encryption so\n\n52\n00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.770\nthat we can read encrypted traffic\non those wireless networks.\n\n53\n00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.975\nIt becomes more difficult to secure\nwireless networks because it's unbound\n\n54\n00:02:57.975 --> 00:03:01.088\nmedia, because it's just\nfloating out there in space.\n\n55\n00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:04.609\nIt's not contained within a wire where\nI can control where that wire goes and\n\n56\n00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.129\nthe only place you can patch into it is\nwhere I've got a port unless you want to\n\n57\n00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.990\ncrawl up into the attic and\ncut a cable and splice it.\n\n58\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.270\nNow with wireless,\nyou just have to be in range.\n\n59\n00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.610\nAnd we can get some really good antennas,\nand I don't have to be nearly as\n\n60\n00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.850\nclose as you think I do,\nto get access to your wireless network.\n\n61\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.430\nOther types of attacks you might see\nin wireless that are pretty common\n\n62\n00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.540\nare man-in-the-middle attacks or\nsession hijacking type attacks.\n\n63\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.460\nAgain, it's a little bit easier\nto get in between the client and\n\n64\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.840\nthe access point for a wireless network,\ncompared to say a wired network.\n\n65\n00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.770\nInfrastructure attacks as well,\n\n66\n00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.820\nyou know just doing a Denial of\nService on the access point.\n\n67\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.350\nFlooding it with requests,\n\n68\n00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.770\nmaking it so busy that legitimate users\ncan't connect to that access point.\n\n69\n00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.480\nSetting up an evil twin, a Rogue Access\nPoint that people will try to connect to.\n\n70\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.760\nIt looks like your access point.\n\n71\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.870\nIt's got the same name.\n\n72\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.240\nIt just doesn't go anywhere.\n\n73\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.480\nOr it goes to some servers that\nlook like your servers and\n\n74\n00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.940\nI'm just collecting information, right.\n\n75\n00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.640\nSo you got rogue access points,\nlike I said, Denial of Service.\n\n76\n00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.590\nRemember, I'll go ahead and\ndefine Denial of Service, but\n\n77\n00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.960\nwe'll come back to it in a minute but\nDenial of Service is making something so\n\n78\n00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.280\nbusy that it can't perform its normal job.\n\n79\n00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.360\nSo if its a wireless access point,\nwell its job is\n\n80\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.540\nto accept wireless traffic bound for\nit and put it on the wired network.\n\n81\n00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.840\nIt can flood, it can only handle so\nmuch traffic at a time.\n\n82\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.500\nMost of us have dealt with that ourselves.\n\n83\n00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.620\nYou get too many people on your access\npoint, and everything slows down,\n\n84\n00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.410\nwell I can just whip up a bunch of fake\nclients, generate a lot of fake traffic,\n\n85\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.440\nand I can make that access point so busy,\nthat it can't do what it's supposed to do.\n\n86\n00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.910\n&gt;&gt; Mike how about pulling\nthe power on the access point?\n\n87\n00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.320\nWould that be another form\nof Denial of Service attack?\n\n88\n00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, you have physical\nsecurity trumps everything else.\n\n89\n00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.600\nAnd if I can get to your\nwireless access point\n\n90\n00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.270\nI can just simply pull the plug on it.\n\n91\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.490\nYou see these access points put in\nplaces that are reachable, right?\n\n92\n00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.790\nI can just reach up there and touch it.\n\n93\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.550\nI mean Wes,\nyou can go a little higher than I can but\n\n94\n00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.540\nthat's not gonna be a good idea if I\ncan just yank the cable out of it.\n\n95\n00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt has to be tied back\nto your network somehow.\n\n96\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.860\nPull the plug on it definitely\ngonna deny the service there.\n\n97\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.700\nAlso we have to worry about signal bleed.\n\n98\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.390\nAnd then we have to do surveys,\ndetermine where our signal is going.\n\n99\n00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.730\nWe always try to make sure\nthat we've got good coverage,\n\n100\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.070\nwe don't want any dead spots in our\nbuilding so we can make sure that people\n\n101\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.860\ncan walk and seamlessly travel\nfrom one access point to the next.\n\n102\n00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.500\nBut a lot of times we'll get a little too\ncarried away with that, and we don't pay\n\n103\n00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.350\nattention to how close that access point\nhas gotten to the edge of the building.\n\n104\n00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.280\nAnd so, not only we're getting good\ncoverage in that quarter office,\n\n105\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.350\nwe got good coverage in\nthe parking lot outside there.\n\n106\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.910\nAnd that's where nobody is monitoring,\nnobody is paying attention.\n\n107\n00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.050\nSo somebody could potentially be sitting\nout all day long working on your wireless\n\n108\n00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.520\nnetwork, trying to break into it, or\ncapturing traffic or stealing information.\n\n109\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.350\nAnd it's a little bit more,\nyou just don't notice it right?\n\n110\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.080\nBecause you're not thinking about\nyour wireless signal reaching out to\n\n111\n00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.230\nthe parking garage or\ninto that business next to you right?\n\n112\n00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.240\nOr that empty space next to you that\nsomebody could potentially sit up in and\n\n113\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.040\ntry to get access to your network.\n\n114\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.510\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you mentioned Denial of Service\nwhen it comes to a wireless attack.\n\n115\n00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.270\nCan you tell us a little bit more about\nDenial of Service like maybe some of\n\n116\n00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.590\nthe attributes what we\ncould expect to maybe see.\n\n117\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.279\nAnd even if we don't see it some of the\nmethodology behind performing one of these\n\n118\n00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:25.210\nDenial of Service.\n\n119\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely and\nI wanna make sure we understand too,\n\n120\n00:06:27.118 --> 00:06:28.540\nI'm not talking about just wireless here.\n\n121\n00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.050\nWhen I'm talking about Denial of Service,\nit's regardless of whether it's wired or\n\n122\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.260\nwireless, right.\n\n123\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.470\nThere's Denial of Service attacks I\ncan do against wireless networks,\n\n124\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.480\nthere's Denial of Service attacks\nI can do against wired networks.\n\n125\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.960\nBut the basic premise of a Denial\nof Service, think about it, right?\n\n126\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.360\nWe've got machines on our network\nthey're providing services.\n\n127\n00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.650\nWhether that's an access point,\nproviding wireless connectivity or\n\n128\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.790\nthat it's a DNS server\nproviding name resolution.\n\n129\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.070\nWhether that's a DHEP server\nproviding TCPIP configuration.\n\n130\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.860\nWe've got machines that are delivering or\nproviding services.\n\n131\n00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.440\nDenial of service means I'm gonna make\nit where it can't do that anymore.\n\n132\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.250\nRight?\nYour DNS server is so\n\n133\n00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.430\nbusy with incoming requests\nthat people are waiting.\n\n134\n00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.320\nMy browser's just spinning and\nspinning and spinning cuz it's waiting for\n\n135\n00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.300\nthe DNS server to respond.\n\n136\n00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.600\nHey, what is the IP address of this name,\nthis user's trying to connect to?\n\n137\n00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.840\nAnd us not getting an answer\nbecause it's too busy, or\n\n138\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.180\nagain, that access point is just too busy,\nso it slows everything down to a crawl or\n\n139\n00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.650\njust stops taking\nconnections all together.\n\n140\n00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.320\nWe can exploit flaws in applications\nthat cause the application to crash,\n\n141\n00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.810\ncan no longer provide its service,\nlike a mail program for example.\n\n142\n00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.613\nJust doing multiple service\nrequests to consume.\n\n143\n00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:49.377\nIf you look at a lot of the Denial\nof Service attacks on websites and\n\n144\n00:07:49.377 --> 00:07:53.553\nall they're doing is they're crafting\npackets, HTTP GET Requests and\n\n145\n00:07:53.553 --> 00:07:58.289\nthey're just sending them one after the\nother after the other to this web server.\n\n146\n00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:02.462\nAnd it causes such a flood in\ntraffic that the web server just\n\n147\n00:08:02.462 --> 00:08:07.400\ncannot keep up with it and people\nstart to fail to connect to your site.\n\n148\n00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.010\nWhat else?\nFlooding email messages,\n\n149\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.740\nwhere the email server can't accept it.\n\n150\n00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.440\nThere's just too much coming in.\n\n151\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.960\nPeople starting getting emails bounced\nback to them, unable to deliver.\n\n152\n00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.420\nSo, here that's the basic idea\nbehind a denial of service.\n\n153\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.370\nOne of the things we need to be\nfamiliar with is something called\n\n154\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.070\na distributed service as well.\n\n155\n00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.380\nWhen we talk about\na denial of service again.\n\n156\n00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.080\nI think we've got the concept right?\n\n157\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.040\nTry to make that service so busy that\nit can't do what it is supposed to do.\n\n158\n00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.960\nWell that's well and\ngood until we start trying to,\n\n159\n00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.730\ndepending on what we're trying to attack.\n\n160\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.550\nRight?\nIf the bad guys are trying to take down\n\n161\n00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:50.850\nyour web server, but you have, I don't\nknow, ten web servers front end, I mean\n\n162\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.020\nthat's a lot of traffic they're gonna\nhave to generate to bring all that down.\n\n163\n00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.300\nThey might slow one of them down,\nbut not all of them.\n\n164\n00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.740\nSo how are they gonna\ndo a denial of service?\n\n165\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.640\nWell they need to\nmultiply their attack and\n\n166\n00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.010\nthat's where a distributed denial\nof service comes into play.\n\n167\n00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.810\nWhen we say a distributed denial\nof service we're going to take\n\n168\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.650\nthe attack that was being\nlaunched from one machine, or\n\n169\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.540\none node and we're going to multiply that.\n\n170\n00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.730\nWe're gonna get a whole bunch of nodes\nthat are gonna launch the attack at\n\n171\n00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:16.670\nthe same time.\n\n172\n00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:20.060\nSo, now I'm increasing my attack\npower hopefully increasing it\n\n173\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.060\nmore than the server has available and\nnow,\n\n174\n00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.390\nI can effectively do it in our service\non that server or that service.\n\n175\n00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.760\nThat is a distributed to of service,\nwe distribute the attack and\n\n176\n00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.710\nthis is were you get the term Zombie.\n\n177\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.170\nRight, this is a machine that's typically,\n\n178\n00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.710\nunwittingly taking part in\nsome type of DDOS attack.\n\n179\n00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.010\nAnd that could be your machine\nthat you sit at at work every day.\n\n180\n00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.860\nIt might have malware on there\nthat you don't notice because it's\n\n181\n00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.280\nnot doing anything\nharmful to your machine.\n\n182\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.400\nThat's not their goal,\nthey don't want you to notice and\n\n183\n00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.300\nto call an incident response,\nand have the machine scrubbed.\n\n184\n00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.710\nThey got their malware on there,\njust sitting there listening.\n\n185\n00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.280\nAnd they're infecting, how many computers\nin your office aren't being used in\n\n186\n00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.750\nthe middle of the night, right?\n\n187\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.470\nAnd then you go to other businesses, and\nhome PCs that nobody pays much attention\n\n188\n00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:12.370\nto, and you recruit all of\nthese zombies into your botnet.\n\n189\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.920\nAnd they're all tuned\nto say an IRC channel,\n\n190\n00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.360\nand when it's time to launch\nthe attack the commander,\n\n191\n00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.750\nthe one that's launching the attack is\ngonna go to his IRC channel and have\n\n192\n00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.680\nthe IRC channel send the launch sequence\nif you will to all of the zombies.\n\n193\n00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.350\nAnd then they all attack at the same time\nand now they have a much larger attack\n\n194\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.980\nforce and can maybe bring down someone\nthat they weren't able to bring down\n\n195\n00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.690\nusing a single machine, so that is\na distributed denial of service attack.\n\n196\n00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:48.020\nAnd there's lots of tools\nthat will help you do this.\n\n197\n00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.490\nSad, good, I don't know.\n\n198\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.180\nReally, a lot of these tools\nare designed for us, for\n\n199\n00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.280\nthe system admins,\nto test our own resources.\n\n200\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.820\nIs my server capable of dealing\nwith a denial of service attack?\n\n201\n00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.760\nHow is it gonna handle it?\n\n202\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.610\nWhat can I do to make it better?\n\n203\n00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.300\nI kind of need to test it and\nsee what it's able to handle and\n\n204\n00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.420\nwhat I need to do, where it fails and\nwhat I can bump up.\n\n205\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.070\nWow.\nA little more memory and\n\n206\n00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.510\nit can handle a lot more, or another\nnetwork adaptor in there, double up on its\n\n207\n00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.910\nband width and it could survive a small,\nor a denial of service attack.\n\n208\n00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:23.120\nSo there's tools like\nthe low orbit ion cannon.\n\n209\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.600\nI love the names for\nall these tools, right.\n\n210\n00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.830\nThe low orbit ion cannon,\nion cannon's popular Sci-Fi type weapon.\n\n211\n00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.150\nIn fact I think this is a, a what was it?\n\n212\n00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.190\nCommand and Conquer?\n\n213\n00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.270\nI think was maybe the game\nthat this came from, or\n\n214\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:43.020\none game in particular that they\nthink this term got originated from.\n\n215\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.510\nThe, the low orbit ion cannon.\n\n216\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.670\nBut anyway, that's what it is.\n\n217\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:51.610\nYou put in an IP address or a URL and you\nclick a button and it launches an attack.\n\n218\n00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.950\nI mean it is a very simplified interface.\n\n219\n00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.560\nAnybody without any technical skills\n\n220\n00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.780\ncould technically launch a denial of\nservice attack with a tool like this.\n\n221\n00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.660\nAll right.\n\n222\n00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.850\nThe down, the one big problem.\n\n223\n00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.420\nI guess if you want to call it a problem.\n\n224\n00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.900\nA problem for the bad guys With a low\norbit ion cannon was that it did\n\n225\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.460\nnot do anything to hide the IP address\nof where the attack was coming from.\n\n226\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.370\nSo it left a big fat record\nof who launched the attack\n\n227\n00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.420\nIn the log files of the attack systems.\n\n228\n00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.530\nAnd you couldn't go through proxies.\n\n229\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.440\nCuz of the way it worked, you'd end\nup doing a denial of service against\n\n230\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.090\nthe proxy and not your actual target.\n\n231\n00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.330\nYou couldn't use the Tor networks.\n\n232\n00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.340\nThey're bandwidth wasn't big enough.\n\n233\n00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.930\nIt would end up causing problems\nwith the DOS on the Tor networks.\n\n234\n00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.600\nSo it was an issue.\n\n235\n00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.570\nAlthough I think this was one of the tools\nthat Anonymous used way back in,\n\n236\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.540\nI think they were using this for\na little while.\n\n237\n00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.250\nThat's why I, you know there were\nsome arrests a few years back at\n\n238\n00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:53.800\nAnonymous where like 12, 13 guys got\npopped because of this tool actually.\n\n239\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.780\nWhat else, it also has a hive mine mode.\n\n240\n00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.390\nSo it can do denial of service.\n\n241\n00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:04.820\nSingle URL that you put in there, one\nattack, but there's a hive mine mode and\n\n242\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:09.220\nwhat it can do is it can now\ncoordinate with other people that have\n\n243\n00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.550\nthe LOIC installed, and\nlaunch attacks from multiple platforms.\n\n244\n00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.650\nThen it got replaced.\n\n245\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.070\nIt was improved in the new and\nimproved version was the high orbit.\n\n246\n00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:25.050\nIon cannon and would do http post or http\ngit request, it would just flood them.\n\n247\n00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:31.979\nIt did a little better at being\nable to mask the source IP address.\n\n248\n00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:37.500\nBut again really not here to learn about\nactually doing a denial of service.\n\n249\n00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.660\nWe wanna know what it is and\nbeing able to protect from it.\n\n250\n00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.110\nBut again I just love\nthe names of these things.\n\n251\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.490\nThere's hulk,\nthe HTTP unbearable load king.\n\n252\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.380\nSo the way they make these names\nis they start with their acronym,\n\n253\n00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.150\nand then they try to find terms\nthey can use to fit that acronym.\n\n254\n00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.570\nThat has to be it.\n\n255\n00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:03.850\nThe Hulk was again, just another\nweb based, denial of services tool.\n\n256\n00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.760\nTor's Hammer is a good one.\n\n257\n00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.540\nT O R Tor, cuz it was designed\nto run on these networks.\n\n258\n00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.320\nIt could bring a website down in seconds.\n\n259\n00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.460\nScary thing.\n\n260\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.970\nOWasp DOShttp post.\n\n261\n00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:22.150\nYou think, wait I know Owasp they\ndeal a lot with web servers and\n\n262\n00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.600\nvulnerabilities they got that Owasp top\nten list that love, always talk about.\n\n263\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.110\nWhat do you mean they have an attack tool?\n\n264\n00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.420\nAgain these tools are really not designed\nas attack tools except for maybe hulk.\n\n265\n00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.670\nThose might be but they started out or\n\n266\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.820\ngo their rise from tools that we\nused to test our own networks.\n\n267\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.340\nStress testers right?\n\n268\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.630\nHey its my server beefy\nenough to handle a workload?\n\n269\n00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:48.080\nWhat if we get a surge in sales or\nwe get linked on Reddit and\n\n270\n00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.190\neveryone's coming to my site.\n\n271\n00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:50.170\nAre we going to be able to handle it?\n\n272\n00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.740\nBut, is our elasticity gonna be\nable to work quick enough to\n\n273\n00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.170\nhandle the extra work load.\n\n274\n00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.720\nSo we make these stress\ntools that can simulate\n\n275\n00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.470\nthousands of people coming\nto our site at the time.\n\n276\n00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.552\nWell the bad guys get a hold of this\ntool and they can use it for mischievous\n\n277\n00:15:05.552 --> 00:15:11.160\npurposes, so you know a lot of hacker\ntools are just administration tools.\n\n278\n00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.190\nMispurposed.\n\n279\n00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.810\n&gt;&gt; I tell you, I'm sitting here thinking\nabout those names, and you guys can't see,\n\n280\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.350\nI'm sitting here smiling thinking about\n\n281\n00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.120\nthen you throw in Hulk and\nyou throw in Thor and\n\n282\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.310\nall I think is we've got the next Avengers\nmovie here kicking here in this episode.\n\n283\n00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.940\nNow you also talked about\nthe fact that in networks\n\n284\n00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.300\nwe rely on thing like resources, right.\n\n285\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.930\nThe resources are a necessity, right?\n\n286\n00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.120\nThat's what a network's about, right?\n\n287\n00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.870\nCommunication and sharing resources.\n\n288\n00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.400\nBut that can also be an Achilles heel,\ntoo, can't it,\n\n289\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.700\nwhen it comes to resources as well?\n\n290\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n291\n00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.980\nThe bad guys can find that\nyou got an application and\n\n292\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.620\nthat application doesn't\nrestrict access to resources.\n\n293\n00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.249\nLike it should.\n\n294\n00:15:48.249 --> 00:15:52.376\nI know of a few a couple of database\napplications that man if you don't\n\n295\n00:15:52.376 --> 00:15:55.589\nthrottle them they will take\nevery bit of available.\n\n296\n00:15:55.589 --> 00:15:57.163\nResource they can't under that system.\n\n297\n00:15:57.163 --> 00:16:01.990\nThey don't care who else is trying to talk\nto the CPU, they will suck it up right.\n\n298\n00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:07.110\nI have to make sure that my applications\nare not allowed to do that.\n\n299\n00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.390\nWhere if somebody tries to\nforce this application to\n\n300\n00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.970\nconsume resources that there's\nsome kind of throttling there.\n\n301\n00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:20.800\nThey can consume bandwidth as I get,\nwe talked about denial of service.\n\n302\n00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.750\nSucking up all the bandwidth\nthat's available,\n\n303\n00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.470\nall the CPU cycles that are available.\n\n304\n00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:30.620\nSo, resource exhaustion is a key component\nwhen it comes to denial of service.\n\n305\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.250\nForce system outage is another one, and\n\n306\n00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.940\nthis is where we really talk about\nattacking the hardware itself.\n\n307\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.070\nThere are utilities or tools,\nsome of these stress testers,\n\n308\n00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:49.070\ncan end up making say a hard drive,\nI forget the term for you.\n\n309\n00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.880\nBut, basically you get your old mechanical\ndrives every right has bang and back and\n\n310\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:58.620\nfort so hard, you can actually damage\nthe hard drive itself doing some of these\n\n311\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.350\nstress tests so you have to be careful\nif you're doing them intentionally,\n\n312\n00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:06.660\nthe bad guys can use these to\ncause a denial of service.\n\n313\n00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.800\nAgain, if I can cause\nyour hard drive to fail,\n\n314\n00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.130\nyour web server can't respond anymore or\nyour database can do queries anymore.\n\n315\n00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:15.650\nCuz the hard drive has failed.\n\n316\n00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.460\nAnd now you've got to replace it,\ndo you have a hard drive in stock or\n\n317\n00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.970\nare you calling up your vendor and\nhoping they can overnight one to you?\n\n318\n00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.460\nThen you've gotta get your backups and\ndo a restoration on this.\n\n319\n00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.410\nHow long is that process gonna take?\n\n320\n00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.270\nIn the mean time can anybody\nget to your website?\n\n321\n00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.788\nAnd do you have a fail back plan to go to?\n\n322\n00:17:33.788 --> 00:17:37.031\nDo you have a recovery plan in place to.\n\n323\n00:17:40.297 --> 00:17:42.255\nCan't even think right now,\nbut to compensate,\n\n324\n00:17:42.255 --> 00:17:44.620\nthat's the word I was looking for,\ncompensate.\n\n325\n00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.780\nThey call it flashing,\nthat's the hacker term for again,\n\n326\n00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:54.970\nwhen we try to damage hardware, cuz I mean\nthey originated that term cuz you could\n\n327\n00:17:54.970 --> 00:18:00.500\ntry to flash, if you had access, you could\nmaybe try to flash a machine's bios or\n\n328\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.790\na routers bios with a corrupt\nversion cause problems with that.\n\n329\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:08.490\n&gt;&gt; Mike, when you were talking about in\nthe wireless portion of this you started\n\n330\n00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:12.390\nmentioning how if I can grab a packet\noff of this wireless network and\n\n331\n00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.070\nI can mangle it a little bit.\n\n332\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.450\nI can send it back at the AP and\nthat can start my attack.\n\n333\n00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.760\nTell me about that,\nthe manipulation of the packets.\n\n334\n00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.820\nWhat are we looking at when we\nthink about a term like that?\n\n335\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.720\n&gt;&gt; Really,\nyou're looking at packet generators.\n\n336\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.060\nThey're packet crafters, trying to think\nof some other terms they call them but\n\n337\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.940\nthose kind of tools allow me\nto custom make my own packets.\n\n338\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.460\nTypically we don't see this, right?\n\n339\n00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.420\nWe're using an application,\nthat has its rules of communication,\n\n340\n00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.820\nbut it's all behind the scenes.\n\n341\n00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:47.150\nThat data goes down the OSI model,\ngets packaged up, sent across,\n\n342\n00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.390\nand comes back up the other side.\n\n343\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.990\nWell, what we do with these\npack of crafting utilities, or\n\n344\n00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:56.670\nthese packet generators,\nis create our own packets.\n\n345\n00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.330\nWe can decide what information goes\nin there, and send it along, and\n\n346\n00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.880\nwe can do that for\na few different reasons.\n\n347\n00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.720\nTrying to spoof.\n\n348\n00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.910\nI wanna pretend hey,\nI see your MAC address filters,\n\n349\n00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.050\nI know somebody that's allowed,\nI've seen a client make a connection.\n\n350\n00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.520\nI know about a MAC address\nthat's allowed to connect.\n\n351\n00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.260\nI need to make some packets that have that\nMAC address in there, or my IP address.\n\n352\n00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.590\nLooks like it's coming from\nan internal address, and\n\n353\n00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.670\nyour firewall just lets it go through.\n\n354\n00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:27.940\nOr you know,\nI wanna dump payload into a ping packet.\n\n355\n00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.560\nThere's 53 bytes of\nspace in a ping packet,\n\n356\n00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.610\nthat we can load up and\npeople don't think about that.\n\n357\n00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.110\nAnd that's where these\npacket generators come in.\n\n358\n00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.900\nThings like a bit twist.\n\n359\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.490\nBit twist is an interesting one,\nit's really pretty cool.\n\n360\n00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.770\nIt's designed to work along with TCP Dump,\n\n361\n00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:45.050\nwhich is a command line\npacket capture utility.\n\n362\n00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.020\nIt's like Wireshark for command line.\n\n363\n00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:54.120\nAnd bit twist allows me, when you do\na packet capture with Wireshark or\n\n364\n00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.250\nTCP Dump or Network Monitor,\nwe create what's called trace files.\n\n365\n00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.280\nThese are the files that have all\nthe packets and all the details.\n\n366\n00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.400\nWell bit twist will let you take\na trace file, and replay it.\n\n367\n00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.830\nIt's like you can take it and click play,\nand it'll resend all that traffic that it\n\n368\n00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:14.650\ncaptured which is really pretty cool in\nand of itself because you can go out and\n\n369\n00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.010\nyou can get traces of attacks,\n\n370\n00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.240\nyou could just make systems really busy\nby replaying large traces over and over.\n\n371\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.820\nBut this'll also let you tweak the packets\nand replay them across the network.\n\n372\n00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.290\nSo it's kind of a cool tool.\n\n373\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:34.090\nPacket sender is another one TCP, UDP,\nand SSL are its big strengths there.\n\n374\n00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:39.620\nLet's me create those packets and\ntry to forge them Pacagen,\n\n375\n00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.217\nScapy, I think both of those\nare Linux based tools.\n\n376\n00:20:43.217 --> 00:20:48.680\nBit twist if I remember right is\npretty much anything, Windows, Linux,\n\n377\n00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.200\nMac and I believe that one is free to,\nit's an open source.\n\n378\n00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.800\nIt's a fun one to play with.\n\n379\n00:20:53.800 --> 00:21:00.310\nI say it is a fun one to play with if you\nwant to learn about packets and you wanna\n\n380\n00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:05.030\nreally get in and learn TCPIP and whatever\nother protocols you want to deal with.\n\n381\n00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.400\nUtilities like this are great work\nbecause we can analyze that traffic.\n\n382\n00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.960\nBut again, it could be twisted around and\nused for malicious purposes.\n\n383\n00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:19.700\nThis is how I can cause denial services\ntext because I can use a tool like\n\n384\n00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:25.070\na packet generator tool, and\nI can generate false HTTP get requests.\n\n385\n00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.280\nI can just, no return address or\nan invalid return address or\n\n386\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.240\nI never respond to the synac\nthat comes back and\n\n387\n00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.420\nI just create open connections, do all\nkinds of bad things with these packet\n\n388\n00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.140\ncrafting utilities that'll lead\nto a denial of service attack.\n\n389\n00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.330\n&gt;&gt; Man, I could see some of these\nutilities here causing a bad\n\n390\n00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.100\nday at the office.\n\n391\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.310\nBetween things like your packet crafters,\na little social engineering.\n\n392\n00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.910\nI find out maybe you're doing things like\nMAC filtering on your wireless network.\n\n393\n00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.870\nWell, all I gotta do is set the network\nadapter in promiscuous mode, and\n\n394\n00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.640\nI can find the MAC addresses of the\ndevices that are already associated with\n\n395\n00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.820\nthe wireless network, get the packet\ncrafter here that Mike's talking about,\n\n396\n00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.880\nand spoof the MAC address.\n\n397\n00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.120\nAnd now all of a sudden, I make it sound\neasy, it's not as easy as it sounds.\n\n398\n00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.140\nI'm on the network so\na lot of scary stuff,\n\n399\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.390\ndefinitely stuff that you have to protect\nagainst and definitely for the exam.\n\n400\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.980\nNow Mike it does look like we're\ncoming to the end of another episode.\n\n401\n00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.680\nBut when it comes to\nthings like wireless and\n\n402\n00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.080\ndenial of service attacks, any additional\nwords that you might like to let\n\n403\n00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.890\nthe viewers know when\nit comes to the exam?\n\n404\n00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.070\n&gt;&gt; You know, as far as this exam,\nI don't think so.\n\n405\n00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.360\nThe main thing is understanding that when\nwe're talking about wireless attacks,\n\n406\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.070\na lot of the same attacks that we\ndeal with on a wired network is just,\n\n407\n00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.330\nsometimes, a little bit easier for\nthe bad guys.\n\n408\n00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:33.975\nBecause it's unbound media.\n\n409\n00:22:33.975 --> 00:22:37.005\nWe got to make sure we're paying\nattention to where we're allowing that\n\n410\n00:22:37.005 --> 00:22:38.855\nsignal to travel to.\n\n411\n00:22:38.855 --> 00:22:40.625\nAre we covering the parking lot?\n\n412\n00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:43.553\nAre we covering the office\nnext door to us?\n\n413\n00:22:43.553 --> 00:22:47.585\nUnderstanding what a denial of service\nattack is, in it's many different forms.\n\n414\n00:22:47.585 --> 00:22:50.505\nI think like you mentioned it doesn't\nhave to be an electronic attack.\n\n415\n00:22:50.505 --> 00:22:53.955\nIf I can just unplug your router\nthat would be a denial of service.\n\n416\n00:22:55.290 --> 00:23:01.570\nAnd then a distributed service when\nwe recruit zombies, create a botnet,\n\n417\n00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:06.570\nand we use more than one attacker to try\nto do a denial of service on a target.\n\n418\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n419\n00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:12.250\nMike, as always, we do appreciate\nthe thorough explanations.\n\n420\n00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.040\nI do think that it's time for us to wrap\nup, but before we do, I'm gonna go ahead\n\n421\n00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.900\nand put my tin hat on, go home and\nturn my wireless access point off.\n\n422\n00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:20.900\nJust kidding guys.\n\n423\n00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:21.830\nThanks for watching here.\n\n424\n00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.620\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Ryan.\n\n425\n00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n426\n00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.130\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n427\n00:23:27.130 -->

00:00:11.011\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.120\nHello, thanks for\njoining us here in the ITProTV studios.\n\n5\n00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.500\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through our\n\n6\n00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.470\nseries in logical operations,\nCyberSec First Responder.\n\n7\n00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.060\nAnd joining us in the studios for\nthis endeavor is none other than Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.680\nMike Roderick.\n\n9\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.030\nMike, how are you doing sir?\n\n10\n00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.760\n&gt;&gt; Doing great Wes,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.030\nExcited to be here as always.\n\n12\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.850\nSo, yeah in this episode\nwe are continuing on.\n\n13\n00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.970\nThe objective we want to go over today\nis going to be, explain the purpose and\n\n14\n00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.760\ncharacteristics of various data sources.\n\n15\n00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.230\nRight?\nSo when we talk about collecting all this\n\n16\n00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.080\ninformation, bringing it all together, you\nneed to understand what information we're\n\n17\n00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.408\ngetting from these different sources and\nwhere to go to look for this information.\n\n18\n00:00:52.408 --> 00:00:55.100\nSo, we're gonna start off with\na couple of definitions, and\n\n19\n00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.260\nwe'll kind of walk through some of\nthe different locations that we end\n\n20\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.890\nup looking for or pulling this data from.\n\n21\n00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.818\nAnd the first term, they use the term\nsecurity intelligence, right?\n\n22\n00:01:04.818 --> 00:01:09.650\nAnd security intelligence\nhas been around for a while,\n\n23\n00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.840\nbefore we ever had\nthe term cyber security.\n\n24\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.970\nAnd I'm gonna read you a logical\noperations definition so\n\n25\n00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.630\nwe understand what they\nconsider security intelligence,\n\n26\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630\nbecause it can vary\nfrom different sources.\n\n27\n00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.230\nThe process through which data generated\nin the ongoing use of information systems\n\n28\n00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.982\nis collected, processed, integrated,\nevaluated, analyzed and interpreted.\n\n29\n00:01:31.982 --> 00:01:33.750\nWhew, right?\n\n30\n00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.040\nThere's a lot to it.\n\n31\n00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.440\nSo, when we're talking about\nsecurity intelligence,\n\n32\n00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.110\nwe're not talking about one little thing.\n\n33\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.980\nIt's really it's an overall process.\n\n34\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.030\nWe're talking about taking the information\nthat we're getting from all\n\n35\n00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.230\nvarious systems on our network, devices,\nendpoints, interconnectivity devices,\n\n36\n00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.820\nservices, wherever we're collecting\nthat data from collecting it up,\n\n37\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.730\nfiguring out how we can process\nthat information, evaluating it,\n\n38\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.830\nanalyzing it, and\nthen making sense out of those results and\n\n39\n00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.940\ninterpreting the results\nof that information.\n\n40\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.540\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike when it comes to certain\nsecurity intelligence, what are some of\n\n41\n00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.170\nthe benefits we can expect to see\nwhen we're using something like that?\n\n42\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you're going to and\npulling all of those information and\n\n43\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.460\ndoing you're analysis on it,\nfaster detection and\n\n44\n00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.750\nremediation of threats, right because I'm\nseeing I'm actually paying attention on\n\n45\n00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.830\nwhat's going on the network\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully somewhere\n\n46\n00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.435\nwe're going to see an alert.\n\n47\n00:02:28.435 --> 00:02:31.010\nThink about it this way\nyou've got your network, and\n\n48\n00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.650\nwhen you think about the scenarios,\nsomebody comes out and\n\n49\n00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.900\nsays, system's been compromised, data has\nbeen exfiltrated, we've had a breach.\n\n50\n00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.700\nAll right well, that's after the fact.\n\n51\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.490\nBut if we were continuously monitoring all\nof our different sources of information\n\n52\n00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.070\nwe might have seen the initial attack,\nthe breach of the firewall or\n\n53\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.740\nthe way they initially got into\nthe network before they ever made it to\n\n54\n00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.840\nthe system that had the important\ninformation that was compromised.\n\n55\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.000\nSo by doing security intelligence,\n\n56\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.790\nwe can hopefully get faster\ndetection remediation of threats.\n\n57\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.030\nAnd also helps us comply with\nour regulatory bodies right,\n\n58\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.060\nbecause we can audit, we can show what\nwe're doing, we can prove that we're\n\n59\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.210\nperforming these particular regulations,\nwhatever might be specified.\n\n60\n00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.480\nSo, we reduce data leakage,\n\n61\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.190\nwe reduce fraud again because\nof early detection, right?\n\n62\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.710\nWe're monitoring everything.\n\n63\n00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.850\nWe're bringing all that data in and\nwe're making sense out of it.\n\n64\n00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.970\nWhat else.\n\n65\n00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.240\nAbility to detect potential weaknesses\nbefore the exploit occurs, that's again,\n\n66\n00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.300\nwhat I was saying, is we might be able to\npick that up, pick the signs of the attack\n\n67\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.279\nup well before it actually turns\ninto a full on data breach.\n\n68\n00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:48.110\nAll right.\n\n69\n00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.670\nNow the problem with this it sounds easy.\n\n70\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.860\nFrank, we'll just pull all of\nthe information in, and analyze it,\n\n71\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.380\nand we'll be safe from attacks.\n\n72\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.330\nRight?\n\n73\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.940\n&gt;&gt; One of the things\nthat I think about Mike,\n\n74\n00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.910\nis that is seems like your information's\ncoming from multiple sources here, and\n\n75\n00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.210\nit looks like that could be\na little bit of a daunting task.\n\n76\n00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.539\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and you've got to decide\nwhat information is actually relevant?\n\n77\n00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.960\n&gt;&gt; What do I need to pay attention to,\n\n78\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.900\nbecause we're gonna have tons\nof information coming in, and\n\n79\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.920\nI've got to decide what kind\nof information is relevant.\n\n80\n00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.110\nHow do I pull out the important pieces?\n\n81\n00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.920\nMaking that information useful.\n\n82\n00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.070\nA lot of these log files come in\na format that's barely human readable?\n\n83\n00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.410\nIt's just very difficult to sit there and\n\n84\n00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.480\njust read the log file\nin its normal output so\n\n85\n00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.280\nmaking that information to the point where\nI can actually do something with it.\n\n86\n00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.580\nI need to be able to query and\nshow all of events that occurred\n\n87\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.168\nin a certain date range or all certain\nevent type, or of a certain user,\n\n88\n00:04:43.168 --> 00:04:47.871\nright, being able to make that\ninformation mean something to me.\n\n89\n00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:52.700\nAnd it takes a lot of time, right, to set\nup all this up, to configure software,\n\n90\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.470\nto be able to pull the data\nfrom different sources,\n\n91\n00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.450\nto get the right tools to be able\nto analyze that information.\n\n92\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.920\nAnd then, training people to be\nable to work that software and\n\n93\n00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.900\nto analyze that information and\nkeeping that information safe.\n\n94\n00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.000\nThat's something that\nsometimes we forget about.\n\n95\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.680\nWe're putting all this stuff in a place to\nkeep our network and our data safe, right?\n\n96\n00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.410\nSo we've got all those logs coming in,\nwe've got maybe seam systems,\n\n97\n00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.425\nor CSM systems,\ncyber security management systems\n\n98\n00:05:22.425 --> 00:05:26.175\nthat are pulling all this information\nin from all these different sources.\n\n99\n00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:30.185\nThat information is confidential,\nright, it needs to be protected.\n\n100\n00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:34.367\nSo we've gotta secure the security data,\nif that makes sense, and\n\n101\n00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.269\nwe've gotta think about that as well.\n\n102\n00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:38.967\nAll right?\n\n103\n00:05:38.967 --> 00:05:42.437\nSo when we talk about security\nintelligence collection or\n\n104\n00:05:42.437 --> 00:05:46.668\npulling this information together,\nit kinda has a life cycle to it, right?\n\n105\n00:05:46.668 --> 00:05:49.168\nWe've got our planning and our direction\n\n106\n00:05:49.168 --> 00:05:54.338\nphase when we're deciding what information\nwe need to gather, from what sources.\n\n107\n00:05:54.338 --> 00:05:57.188\nThen we're gonna go through\na collection phase where we do\n\n108\n00:05:57.188 --> 00:05:58.778\npull that information in.\n\n109\n00:05:58.778 --> 00:06:00.348\nThat information's gotta be processed.\n\n110\n00:06:00.348 --> 00:06:04.348\nIt's gotta be made to where\nwe can actually use it,\n\n111\n00:06:04.348 --> 00:06:08.360\nwhether that's putting it in a database so\nthat I can query it, or some other systems\n\n112\n00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.750\nor processing all of that raw data and\nthen doing your analysis, right?\n\n113\n00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.370\nGoing through and making sense of it,\npulling out the important information,\n\n114\n00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.960\nlooking for signs of attack or data\nexfiltration or whatever we're looking\n\n115\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.020\nfor, and then dissemination of that\ninformation out to the appropriate people.\n\n116\n00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.280\nThat's another big part of this process,\nright?\n\n117\n00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.390\nIf If I'm that security person that's\npulling all this information in and\n\n118\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.880\nanalyzing these files,\nI need to make sure that when I\n\n119\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.690\nfind information that's pertinent to other\ndepartment heads or whomever it may be,\n\n120\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.850\nthat this information gets put back\nout to them in a meaningful manner.\n\n121\n00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.274\nSo dissemination and\n\n122\n00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:52.820\nintegration of the information back\ninto the system that we can use.\n\n123\n00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.420\nAnd it starts all over,\nit doesn't just stop there, right?\n\n124\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.100\nIt's cyclical in nature.\n\n125\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.840\nWe're gonna be constantly going\nthrough this collection, process,\n\n126\n00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.610\nanalysis, dissemination, collection,\nprocess, analysis, dissemination.\n\n127\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:12.720\nWe just go around and around and\nit's a never ending cycle, right?\n\n128\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.360\nNow another term that we wanted\nto define here is actually,\n\n129\n00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.500\nbefore we do that,\nwe talk about our collection plan again.\n\n130\n00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.758\nWe wanna think about what information we\nneed really, that's going to be one of\n\n131\n00:07:26.758 --> 00:07:31.349\nthe challenges that we face is trying to\ndetermine what information is appropriate.\n\n132\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.010\nWhere can I get the information, right?\n\n133\n00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.660\nDo my routers have good\nlogging capabilities?\n\n134\n00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.610\nCan I get information from them?\n\n135\n00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.220\nWhat about my switches?\n\n136\n00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.205\nDo they provide any type of logging or\ninformation?\n\n137\n00:07:44.205 --> 00:07:48.433\nNodes on my network,\nmy Windows systems, my Linux systems,\n\n138\n00:07:48.433 --> 00:07:52.271\nmy services, DNS logs,\nDHCP logs, things like that.\n\n139\n00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:54.466\nWhere am I gonna get\nthis information from?\n\n140\n00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:57.253\nAnd really, we wanna make\nsure that we bring everybody.\n\n141\n00:07:57.253 --> 00:07:59.910\nIn, when we're deciding where\nthe information come from,\n\n142\n00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.838\nwe should get al the departments involved,\n\n143\n00:08:01.838 --> 00:08:05.640\nbecause they might have a source of\ninformation that I didn't think of, right?\n\n144\n00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.190\nThat hey, did you know these logs,\nthis information here?\n\n145\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.380\nNo, that would be a great information\nto throw in with the rest of them.\n\n146\n00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.250\nThe more information I can get,\nthe better in the end.\n\n147\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.720\nI mean it does make it a challenge to get\nit down, all the important information.\n\n148\n00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.080\nBut, I'd rather have a little too much and\n\n149\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.160\nhave to filter it down, than not have\nthat information in the first place.\n\n150\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.400\nI'm getting everybody involved,\n\n151\n00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:31.380\nmaking sure that we find all the different\ndata sources that we have available.\n\n152\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.210\nNow a term that actually that\nI wasnt familiar with- 'CSM'.\n\n153\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.100\nThis has some other meanings to it.\n\n154\n00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.190\nBut its relatively new\nin the security front.\n\n155\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.000\nCyber security management.\n\n156\n00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.130\nAnd you go out there and look, and\nyou're not gonna find a whole lot on this.\n\n157\n00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:51.030\nBut cyber security management is really\nkind of what we're talking about here.\n\n158\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.040\nGetting all of this information\nthat's vital, organizing it,\n\n159\n00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.290\nmaking it into something that I can\nuse Is really what CSM is all about.\n\n160\n00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.010\nWhat I think what we're\n\n161\n00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.710\nseeing is there is going to be software\nthat is going to be doing this soon.\n\n162\n00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.300\nIf I take a look, let me pull something\nup real quick and I'll show you guys.\n\n163\n00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.630\nIf we take a look at my screen right now,\n\n164\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:18.940\nhere's a document from Sans Talking about\nthe Cyber Security Management System.\n\n165\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.930\nSystem a conceptual if I can say that.\n\n166\n00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.050\nA conceptual of Mapping.\n\n167\n00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.030\nAnd I pull this up not so much for\nthe read but it is a great read.\n\n168\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.410\nIt has everything else\neverything else from SANS.\n\n169\n00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.590\nBut I wanted to show\nyou this picture here.\n\n170\n00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:35.580\nBecause this is there picture of\na cyber security management system.\n\n171\n00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.040\nAnd if you look at that\nit's pretty complex right?\n\n172\n00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.790\nThere's a lot of things going on over\nhere on this side I've got things like\n\n173\n00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.000\nevaluation, anti-virus passwords,\nall leads into policies.\n\n174\n00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.060\nIn the middle here I've got\ncyber security management.\n\n175\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.700\nAnd you can see how that\nbranches out to policies,\n\n176\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.870\ntechnology, planning, Corporate assets.\n\n177\n00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.350\nIf we go down to corporate\nassets I've got my systems,\n\n178\n00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.010\nmy network, my data, my applications.\n\n179\n00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.080\nWhich kinda leads over to configuration\nmanagement which also comes from\n\n180\n00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.880\ntools which comes from people which\ncomes from planning which came from\n\n181\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.060\nCyber Security Management right.\n\n182\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.590\nSo you see how it all ties back.\n\n183\n00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.890\nBut I show you this again\njust to show you that when\n\n184\n00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.690\nwe talk about cybersecurity\nmanagement systems,\n\n185\n00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.930\nwe're really talking about something that\ncan tie all of this together, right?\n\n186\n00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.230\nThat's the idea behind\na cybersecurity management system.\n\n187\n00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.330\nAnd we're really starting to see where,\n\n188\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.190\nwe've talked a little\nbit about seam systems.\n\n189\n00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.680\nWe've talked about IDSs and IPSs.\n\n190\n00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.590\nAnd I, this is just me kind of pondering,\nbut I kind of see all of that\n\n191\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.970\ngetting pulled together and\nbecoming cyber security management.\n\n192\n00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.240\nWhere we're taking all that information\nfrom all the different sources,\n\n193\n00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.115\nbringing it into one thing.\n\n194\n00:10:44.115 --> 00:10:47.675\nMike, you definitely explained\nthe importance of the logs and\n\n195\n00:10:47.675 --> 00:10:50.185\nbeing able to gain access\nto that information.\n\n196\n00:10:50.185 --> 00:10:53.415\nBut are there any other examples of\nthings that we might need to monitor?\n\n197\n00:10:53.415 --> 00:10:54.095\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely,\n\n198\n00:10:54.095 --> 00:10:57.355\nit's really important that we\nunderstand what we want to monitor.\n\n199\n00:10:57.355 --> 00:10:59.575\nBecause as I said earlier,\nwe've got a ton of information,\n\n200\n00:10:59.575 --> 00:11:01.480\nthere's no shortage of information.\n\n201\n00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.670\nJust about everything on our\nnetwork is going to log.\n\n202\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.130\nWe can pull that information in.\n\n203\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.140\nBut there's definitely certain\nthings that we wanna focus on like\n\n204\n00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.050\nvulnerabilities, right?\n\n205\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.120\nDoing vulnerability scans,\n\n206\n00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.970\nmaking sure we have baselines on our\nsystems, configuration information\n\n207\n00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.490\nabout the different assets\nthat we have on our network.\n\n208\n00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.350\nWe have to have baselines.\n\n209\n00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.960\nWithout baselines, later on when we start\nmonitoring and looking it's very hard\n\n210\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.280\nto determine it that's good or not without\nsomething to compare it to, right?\n\n211\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.730\nI don't know if this router configuration\nhas been modified because I\n\n212\n00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.310\ndon't know what it was originally.\n\n213\n00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.580\nSo, bringing in that information and\nthen monitoring it, right?\n\n214\n00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.090\nI need to monitor that router config.\n\n215\n00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.100\nA lot of people set and forget it, right?\n\n216\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.990\nIt's my router config I've\ngot my router set up,\n\n217\n00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.180\neverything is working, we're good to go.\n\n218\n00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.940\nHow do you know if somebody hasn't\nadded some initial rules in there?\n\n219\n00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.440\nRight?\n\n220\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.860\nOr changed some of your rules, or\nwhether it's malicious or unintentional.\n\n221\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.960\nAdded a rule, but put it in the wrong\nspot and now all the rest of my rules\n\n222\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.380\nare being negated because this rule\ngot put too high up on the list, and\n\n223\n00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.990\nnow it's causing problems.\n\n224\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.220\nSo, monitoring that information system and\nnetwork logs.\n\n225\n00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.040\nLooking at al the operating systems\nnowadays, logs, some of it you might have\n\n226\n00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.270\nto turn on, depending on what\nit is you're trying to do.\n\n227\n00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.900\nWindows for\nexample does a lot of logging already, but\n\n228\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.840\nit doesn't log firewall stuff, if I don't\ngo in and turn that information on.\n\n229\n00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.830\nOr it does very remedial logging,\nvery little logging,\n\n230\n00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.390\nuntil I go in and And turn it on.\n\n231\n00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:37.080\nSo understanding our systems and\nwhat logs are available, configuring\n\n232\n00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.230\ntriggers to log certain events,\nif there's things we know we wanna log.\n\n233\n00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.100\nI need to make sure that we can\npull that data together, aggregate,\n\n234\n00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.749\ncorrelate that information,\nsecurity device logs, my IDSs.\n\n235\n00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:59.680\nAgain, logical operations says that CSMs,\nor IDSs are early forms of CSMs, right?\n\n236\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.860\nThose cybersecurity management systems.\n\n237\n00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.840\nCSMs are just going to\npull more information.\n\n238\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.110\nThreat intelligence.\n\n239\n00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.280\nAnother big part of information gathering.\n\n240\n00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.880\nIs staying on top of current threats.\n\n241\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.530\nGoing out and\n\n242\n00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:19.600\nsubscribing to different vendors,\nRSS feeds they can dump information.\n\n243\n00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.000\nIf you, bug tracks and\nNIST and security focus.\n\n244\n00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000\nDifferent places that I can go and\nsubscribe with these RSS feeds.\n\n245\n00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.840\nSomehow, I've got to stay on top of it.\n\n246\n00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.000\nAnd they're new vulnerabilities\nbeing discovered every day.\n\n247\n00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.090\nAnd the only real way to stay on top\nof that is to have these sources that\n\n248\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.730\nshould be part of your daily routine.\n\n249\n00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:40.880\nAs you come in, in the morning and\n\n250\n00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.400\nyou say, let's see what What's new on\nmy news reader and see what pops up.\n\n251\n00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.910\n&gt;&gt; Now that you get an example of what to\nmonitor Mike, for our viewers out there,\n\n252\n00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.630\nmaybe you can give us some examples of,\n\n253\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.160\ndo we have anything available\nto help us assist this.\n\n254\n00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.050\nIs this the eye in the sky?\n\n255\n00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.040\nAm I walking from system to system?\n\n256\n00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.080\nOr do we have some things that can help\nus when it comes to the monitoring side?\n\n257\n00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.790\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nwe mentioned a couple of them.\n\n258\n00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.630\nLet's talk about them again.\n\n259\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.260\nSecurity information and\nEvent Management systems or SIEM systems.\n\n260\n00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.120\nThese are things like Alien Vault for\nexample or OSSIM and there's many,\n\n261\n00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.570\nmany others out there.\n\n262\n00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.290\nRemember, this test is platform neutral,\nso\n\n263\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.360\nwe're not really focusing\non any particular one.\n\n264\n00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.580\nBut there seems there is\nsecurity information and\n\n265\n00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.050\narrangement that user systems\nthat are designed to software\n\n266\n00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:28.590\nthis is designed prolonged from many\ndifferent sources nd giving you\n\n267\n00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:33.490\none place to go like in quality get\ninformation analyze that information.\n\n268\n00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.900\nQuery that information.\n\n269\n00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.770\nSCAP Security content automation protocol.\n\n270\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.310\nThis is something that,\nit's a protocol that's been developed,\n\n271\n00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.500\nstill being developed as we work,\nbut it's a language or\n\n272\n00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:51.360\na protocol designed to help\nus share cyber security or\n\n273\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.580\ncyber events or\nsecurity event type information.\n\n274\n00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.170\nWe really need a common\nlanguage when we share this.\n\n275\n00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:03.220\nIf I'm going to share information about\na breach that occurred on my network,\n\n276\n00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.930\nwith other people, so they can look at it,\nhelp my analyze it, or\n\n277\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.780\nwe can share information about breaches\nand try to figure out what we can do to\n\n278\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.180\ntry to figure out what we can do\nto prevent that in the future.\n\n279\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.280\nWe've all got to be\nspeaking the same language.\n\n280\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.980\nAnd because this kind of thing\nis relatively new, right,\n\n281\n00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.960\nespecially with the sharing\nof the information.\n\n282\n00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.180\nIt's been very we're\ngonna keep it in house,\n\n283\n00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:28.440\nwe don't want this information getting\nout, because it gives me a bad publicity,\n\n284\n00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.020\nI lose business, I'm embarrassed,\nthings like that.\n\n285\n00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.150\nFinally vendors organizations\nare really starting to be\n\n286\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.310\na little more willing to share the\ninformation, understanding that everybody\n\n287\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.220\nis susceptible to these breaches,\nwe do what we can to prevent them.\n\n288\n00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:46.022\nMinimize their impact but\nthe only way we can do that is to share.\n\n289\n00:15:46.022 --> 00:15:50.743\nI was at an RSA conference\nthis last year and\n\n290\n00:15:50.743 --> 00:15:53.766\nVerizon had a great event.\n\n291\n00:15:53.766 --> 00:15:56.690\nAnd one of the gentleman that was\nspeaking was from the Four Seasons Hotel.\n\n292\n00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.120\nHe was their Chief Security Officer.\n\n293\n00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.458\nAnd one of the things I found that was\nreally interesting was that he said\n\n294\n00:16:03.458 --> 00:16:07.215\nonce a month, him and the CSOs and\nCIOs from, I think he said,\n\n295\n00:16:07.215 --> 00:16:10.270\nnine other hotel chains get together and\ntalk.\n\n296\n00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:14.980\nThey have a roundtable discussion and\nthey talk about events they've seen.\n\n297\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.520\nThings they're doing to try to prevent.\n\n298\n00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.300\nThings that are working.\n\n299\n00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.540\nThings that aren't working.\n\n300\n00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.601\nAttacks that they've seen or\nattempted attacks that they've seen.\n\n301\n00:16:21.601 --> 00:16:23.740\nAnd these are people that\nare normally competitors.\n\n302\n00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.570\nThey don't wanna help\nthe other organization.\n\n303\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.430\nThey're in the same vertical.\n\n304\n00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.630\nThey all compete with each other.\n\n305\n00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.230\nBut when it comes to security,\n\n306\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.470\nthey've come to realize that\nwhat hurts you, also hurts me.\n\n307\n00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.210\nBecause we're seeing that the bad\nguys are starting to get very smart.\n\n308\n00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.400\nAnd they're starting to be very specific.\n\n309\n00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.410\nIf I'm a bad guy that targets hotel\nchains, hotel type industries,\n\n310\n00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.770\nhospitality type industries,\nbecause they have the same practices,\n\n311\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:56.580\nthe same business models, they\nprobably do a lot things the same way.\n\n312\n00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.500\nThe attacks that I do,\nif it works on one, it'll work on another.\n\n313\n00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.300\nSo that same thought process.\n\n314\n00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.170\nIf we share information amongst\nthese verticals within my industry,\n\n315\n00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.720\nI might be able to help you or you might\nbe able to help me prevent an attack.\n\n316\n00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:16.519\nSo SCAP is a protocol that's designed\nto help us share this information.\n\n317\n00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:20.126\nBut yet still maintain\ncompliance with regulations and\n\n318\n00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:24.660\nnot giving out say PII, things that\nmight cause me liability issues.\n\n319\n00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:30.952\nAnother general tool, Network\nBehavior Anomaly Detection, or NBAD,\n\n320\n00:17:30.952 --> 00:17:33.511\nanother acronym that we need to know.\n\n321\n00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:36.210\nNetwork Behavior Anomaly Detection.\n\n322\n00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:41.230\nWhich has really kind of evolved\ninto network behavior analysis.\n\n323\n00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.770\nSo if you hear that according\nto logical operations is gonna\n\n324\n00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.080\ncall it network behavior\nanomaly detection.\n\n325\n00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.740\nIf you're doing your studying, you might\nfind that it's network behavior analysis.\n\n326\n00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.930\nPretty much the same thing, but\n\n327\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:56.430\nwhen we look at network behavior anomaly\ndetection, the name kind of says it all.\n\n328\n00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:01.311\nIf we break that up into little pieces,\nmy network, how its behavior is,\n\n329\n00:18:01.311 --> 00:18:05.111\ntraffic that's going on,\nanomaly detection, right?\n\n330\n00:18:05.111 --> 00:18:09.662\nDetecting anomalies in my\nbehavior on my network.\n\n331\n00:18:09.662 --> 00:18:12.026\nWe just read it backward,\nwe can kinda figure out what it is.\n\n332\n00:18:12.026 --> 00:18:15.920\nBut again, this is one of those\nthings that relies on baselines.\n\n333\n00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.910\nIf I don't know what normal\nbehavior my network is,\n\n334\n00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.660\nI'm gonna have trouble\ndetecting anomalous behaviour.\n\n335\n00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:28.380\nBut three big components when it comes\nto network behavior anomaly detection\n\n336\n00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:34.360\nare gonna be traffic flow,\npattern and data.\n\n337\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.820\nYou might say normally there's such and\n\n338\n00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.740\nsuch percentage of DNS\ntraffic on my network.\n\n339\n00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.620\nSuch and such percentage of FTP\ntraffic on my network, all right?\n\n340\n00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:48.308\nAnd if I see anomalies, if I see, all of\na sudden, when we normally have about\n\n341\n00:18:48.308 --> 00:18:53.230\n20% of the network traffic is FTP,\nall of a sudden 80% of my traffic is FTP.\n\n342\n00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:57.565\nThat's an anomaly, there's something\ngoing on that's not normal.\n\n343\n00:18:57.565 --> 00:18:58.844\nIt might not be a bad thing.\n\n344\n00:18:58.844 --> 00:19:03.505\nIt might be that my dev team is using\nFTP to upload some big crazy files or\n\n345\n00:19:03.505 --> 00:19:07.933\nimages or something and\nit's just causing a spike in FTP traffic.\n\n346\n00:19:07.933 --> 00:19:09.472\nSo it's no big deal.\n\n347\n00:19:09.472 --> 00:19:14.522\nOr it could be that somebody's got\na Trojan that there's a little FTP\n\n348\n00:19:14.522 --> 00:19:19.802\ndaemon spitting out information,\nexfiltrating data out of our network.\n\n349\n00:19:19.802 --> 00:19:21.802\nBut if I'm not monitoring,\n\n350\n00:19:21.802 --> 00:19:25.310\nif I don't know what's supposed to be\nthere, I wouldn't notice that anomaly.\n\n351\n00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.150\nAnd it would go undetected.\n\n352\n00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.950\nNetwork performance data,\npassive traffic analysis,\n\n353\n00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.910\nall of this would be considered\nlooking for behavior anomalies.\n\n354\n00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.900\n&gt;&gt; You know, Mike, I know that we've\ntalked over many different courses, and\n\n355\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.980\nsome in this course,\njust how dynamic networks are.\n\n356\n00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.444\nAnd this does seem like a way to combat or\nto ride the rail, if you will,\n\n357\n00:19:43.444 --> 00:19:45.045\nof that dynamic nature.\n\n358\n00:19:45.045 --> 00:19:49.192\nSomething like the network\nbehavior anomaly detection.\n\n359\n00:19:49.192 --> 00:19:50.425\nI'll try to say that as well.\n\n360\n00:19:50.425 --> 00:19:51.765\nLooks like it's a dynamic approach.\n\n361\n00:19:51.765 --> 00:19:56.365\nIt's not a set in stone static type\nof tool, but it's more dynamic\n\n362\n00:19:56.365 --> 00:19:59.215\nadjusting itself to what you're\nseeing on your network in real time.\n\n363\n00:19:59.215 --> 00:20:00.095\nWell, it can be.\n\n364\n00:20:00.095 --> 00:20:01.978\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nthat's what makes it such a challenge.\n\n365\n00:20:01.978 --> 00:20:06.650\nThere is an ongoing workload\ninvolved with this.\n\n366\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.270\nData collection, right,\nI mentioned this earlier.\n\n367\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.044\nThe more data, you collect the more,\nlike what they say,\n\n368\n00:20:14.044 --> 00:20:16.217\nthe more it will be what you need.\n\n369\n00:20:16.217 --> 00:20:17.379\nWait, what?\n\n370\n00:20:17.379 --> 00:20:21.439\nYeah, you're gonna find that as\nyou collect these information,\n\n371\n00:20:21.439 --> 00:20:26.820\nyou start looking through the information,\nwow, I'm glad I had that, right?\n\n372\n00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.240\nSo collect a lot of data.\n\n373\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.725\nStart off collecting more than you need\nand you can always whittle it down.\n\n374\n00:20:32.725 --> 00:20:34.540\nSome data might not be helpful.\n\n375\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.690\nIt might not be necessarily\nanything that I can use.\n\n376\n00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.750\nDon't just monitor everything 100%.\n\n377\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.970\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\nlet me see if this example falls in line.\n\n378\n00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.100\nI've had to do this before in something\nas simple as Windows Event Viewer where\n\n379\n00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.080\nmy habit is to always filter to\nthe three that we worry about, right?\n\n380\n00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.670\nCritical, warning, and error.\n\n381\n00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.630\nBut what I didn't notice is that\nsome of the information events told\n\n382\n00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.540\nme the service that was\ncausing the errors.\n\n383\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.990\nSo would that be an example of a little\nbit more not less because who knows if\n\n384\n00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.110\nyou're actually discarding information\nby trimming it down too much.\n\n385\n00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.093\n&gt;&gt; That's a great example.\n\n386\n00:21:04.093 --> 00:21:07.107\nIf you were not even logging\nthose informational events,\n\n387\n00:21:07.107 --> 00:21:11.810\nif you had chosen to just do warnings,\nyou're gonna miss a lot of information.\n\n388\n00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.971\nI always use the example of somebody,\nlet's say,\n\n389\n00:21:13.971 --> 00:21:16.190\ndoing password guessing in\nthe middle of the night.\n\n390\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.046\nBecause there's a lot of\npeople I've talked to who,\n\n391\n00:21:18.046 --> 00:21:19.540\nthey'll set up authentication logging.\n\n392\n00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.312\nBut they're only gonna\nlog failed attempts.\n\n393\n00:21:22.312 --> 00:21:26.031\nAnd so what they see in their log file the\nnext day is at 1 o'clock in the morning,\n\n394\n00:21:26.031 --> 00:21:29.319\nfailed attempt, failed attempt,\nfailed attempt, failed attempt,\n\n395\n00:21:29.319 --> 00:21:32.704\nfailed attempt, failed attempt,\nfailed attempt, and then nothing.\n\n396\n00:21:32.704 --> 00:21:36.790\nAnd they go, okay, well,\nthey gave up or did they?\n\n397\n00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:40.780\nIf I'm not monitoring successful logins,\nthe very next login might've been success.\n\n398\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.662\nThat's why the failed stopped was because\nthe person guessed the right password, and\n\n399\n00:21:44.662 --> 00:21:46.965\ngot into the resource they\nwere trying to get into.\n\n400\n00:21:46.965 --> 00:21:49.834\nIf I wasn't monitoring,\nif I wasn't logging that information,\n\n401\n00:21:49.834 --> 00:21:51.895\nI wouldn't have any record of that.\n\n402\n00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:56.288\nSo what you might think is, I don't wanna\nmonitor successful logins because I\n\n403\n00:21:56.288 --> 00:22:00.015\nhave hundreds of employees and\nthey successfully log in all the time.\n\n404\n00:22:00.015 --> 00:22:03.280\nThe problem is,\nyou might need that information.\n\n405\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.851\nSo, it's a tough job to\ntry to filter this, or\n\n406\n00:22:06.851 --> 00:22:11.530\nto try to determine what it is\nthat I need to capture and save.\n\n407\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:16.433\nAnd that's why I say these systems that\nhelp accumulate these information and\n\n408\n00:22:16.433 --> 00:22:19.340\nallow me to filter it\ndown are very important.\n\n409\n00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.520\nBecause we find that we need to\nmonitor quite a bit of stuff.\n\n410\n00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.220\nWe need to log almost all of it.\n\n411\n00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.900\nAnd then, we just have to filter\nit down into something useful.\n\n412\n00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.790\nSo striking that balance between too\nmuch data and not enough useful data.\n\n413\n00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.889\nWe also need to make sure that we\ndon't violate any laws or regulations,\n\n414\n00:22:35.889 --> 00:22:39.868\nthat we are logging everything that\nthe regulations say I have to log.\n\n415\n00:22:39.868 --> 00:22:44.528\nWe look at HIPAA and Sarbanes-Oxley,\nand regulations like this.\n\n416\n00:22:44.528 --> 00:22:49.176\nAnd they're gonna have specific\nguidelines that say, there needs to be\n\n417\n00:22:49.176 --> 00:22:54.330\na record of anybody that accesses\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n418\n00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.260\nAny changes that are made to that\ninformation needs to be logged.\n\n419\n00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.596\nLast modified, last viewed,\nthings like that.\n\n420\n00:22:59.596 --> 00:23:02.291\nThere's gonna be regulations\nthat say what you've got to do.\n\n421\n00:23:02.291 --> 00:23:03.315\nAnd if you're not,\n\n422\n00:23:03.315 --> 00:23:07.180\nyou're gonna open yourself up to\ntremendous amounts of liability.\n\n423\n00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:12.290\nSo understanding what the laws and the\nregulations say that I've got to log and\n\n424\n00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:16.770\nthat I've got to maintain, or retain,\nI guess is a better word for that.\n\n425\n00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.890\nSo when it comes to data collection,\nthere's definitely a planning phase\n\n426\n00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.790\nin this, trying to decide what it is that\nI need capture, what it is I need to log.\n\n427\n00:23:26.815 --> 00:23:30.340\nCuz it is such a tough balance there,\ntrying to get enough information to make\n\n428\n00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:35.070\nit useful, yet not too much information\nwhere it's just overwhelming and\n\n429\n00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.680\nI can't find what I'm looking for.\n\n430\n00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.567\n&gt;&gt; You know, Mike,\n\n431\n00:23:37.567 --> 00:23:41.353\nyou were talking to us about going to\na conference where there were CIOs, and\n\n432\n00:23:41.353 --> 00:23:44.798\nCSOs were sharing information in\nthe security intelligence world.\n\n433\n00:23:44.798 --> 00:23:47.710\nAs far as our information that we get to,\n\n434\n00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:52.687\nare there other sources as well or\nhave we pretty much covered those?\n\n435\n00:23:52.687 --> 00:23:55.065\n&gt;&gt; No, we could list a few out there and\n\n436\n00:23:55.065 --> 00:23:59.440\nthere might be some things that\nyou might not have thought about.\n\n437\n00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.062\nWe talk about OS administration logs.\n\n438\n00:24:02.062 --> 00:24:02.942\nAll right?\n\n439\n00:24:02.942 --> 00:24:07.891\nProbably thought of those perimeter logs,\nVPN logs, network audits, file and\n\n440\n00:24:07.891 --> 00:24:12.332\ndirectory audits, malware detection,\nsys logs, application logs,\n\n441\n00:24:12.332 --> 00:24:14.310\nphysical security logs.\n\n442\n00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.330\nRight?\nThere's one that you might forget about.\n\n443\n00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:21.850\nBecause we're so focused on our networks,\nthat we forget about the front desk and\n\n444\n00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.346\nthe fact that that\nsecurity guard out there,\n\n445\n00:24:23.346 --> 00:24:28.570\nhas a sign-in sheet of tracking\nwhen these visitors came in.\n\n446\n00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:32.480\nI might have a record of somebody logging\nin but I don't know who this person is,\n\n447\n00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.716\nand in that visitor log I would\nhave seen something maybe.\n\n448\n00:24:36.716 --> 00:24:39.640\nI know we might probably don't make them\naccounts but again, just trying to throw\n\n449\n00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.860\nout some examples there of things\nthat you might not think about.\n\n450\n00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.930\nWeb scans, thread intelligence.\n\n451\n00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.070\nWhen we're doing our vulnerability scans.\n\n452\n00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.650\nChange management records.\n\n453\n00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.055\nThese are important to keep around.\n\n454\n00:24:51.055 --> 00:24:55.250\nUnderstanding change management, when\nyou're making a change to a configuration.\n\n455\n00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.640\nThat's my record of what\nthe value used to be.\n\n456\n00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.820\nWe might find that we tested it.\n\n457\n00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.610\nWe thought we were good.\n\n458\n00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:00.880\nWe made the change.\n\n459\n00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.865\nAnd that broke something\nelse that we didn't notice.\n\n460\n00:25:02.865 --> 00:25:05.870\nNow we need to try to roll back,\nhaving that information,\n\n461\n00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.300\nthose change management records,\nI know what the old value used to be.\n\n462\n00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.910\nSo a lot of sources for\nsecurity intelligence.\n\n463\n00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:17.790\nAs far as guidelines on\nwhat we need to collect.\n\n464\n00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:21.760\nAgain, it's gonna differ\nbetween organizations,\n\n465\n00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.595\nwhat information we have available even,\nto collect.\n\n466\n00:25:24.595 --> 00:25:28.900\nBut looking at identifying and\nprioritizing our risks,\n\n467\n00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:33.585\nidentifying potential data sources and\nthen trying to narrow that focus.\n\n468\n00:25:34.705 --> 00:25:38.595\nNow we also need to think about\nwhat fields we need to log.\n\n469\n00:25:38.595 --> 00:25:43.415\nA lot of these systems,\nwhen I look at routers or switches or\n\n470\n00:25:43.415 --> 00:25:46.125\nwhatever the case maybe,\nwe can enable logging.\n\n471\n00:25:46.125 --> 00:25:49.185\nAnd then we can enable\nsome level of verbosity,\n\n472\n00:25:49.185 --> 00:25:53.862\nwe might be able to customize or pick and\nchoose what fields we wanna log.\n\n473\n00:25:53.862 --> 00:25:54.917\nRight?\n\n474\n00:25:54.917 --> 00:25:58.540\nAnd there are definitely some things\nthat we wanna make sure that we get.\n\n475\n00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.940\nLike for an event I need to know when\nthat event started and when it ended.\n\n476\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.625\nRight?\nThis is gonna be critical to correlating\n\n477\n00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:06.600\nlogs from other systems.\n\n478\n00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.200\nBecause if I know when that event started\nand ended, now I can go collect the logs\n\n479\n00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.030\nfrom my firewall, from my routers,\nfrom my switches,\n\n480\n00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.260\nfrom the hosts that were affected,\nand I can pull that same time frame.\n\n481\n00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.300\nAnd I can start analyzing\nthat information, and\n\n482\n00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.030\nlook for signs of that attack\nall through my network.\n\n483\n00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:27.150\nI need to know who was\ninvolved in the event.\n\n484\n00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:33.640\nWhat work station, or what server, if any\nemployees were involved, what happened?\n\n485\n00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.490\nInformation specific to the details\nof that event need to be logged.\n\n486\n00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.270\nWhere it happened?\n\n487\n00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:39.980\nWhat system?\n\n488\n00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:44.320\nAgain, what system got compromised or\nwhat system was used to perform the scan?\n\n489\n00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.340\nAnd it looks like they bounced\na scan off of one of my servers,\n\n490\n00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.840\nto scan the rest of my internal network.\n\n491\n00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.730\nAnd where it originated.\n\n492\n00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:53.890\nDid it originate in house?\n\n493\n00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:54.730\nWas it external?\n\n494\n00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.550\nDid it come through our firewall?\n\n495\n00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:00.610\nAll gonna be important information\nthat we wanna make sure we capture.\n\n496\n00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:05.550\n&gt;&gt; Mike it seems like the unsung hero, you\nsaid in the beginning of the episode about\n\n497\n00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.870\nthings like detection and remediation\nLooks like we need to move those apart,\n\n498\n00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.710\nand put identification right\nin the middle as well.\n\n499\n00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.820\nSeems like identification is\na big part of this, likewise.\n\n500\n00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.920\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n501\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.810\nAnd things that we wanna think about for,\nwhen we say we're logging again,\n\n502\n00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.450\nwe're trying to make sure we're getting\nall the pertinent information but\n\n503\n00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.590\nnot too much information.\n\n504\n00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:28.130\nSo we can keep that information useful.\n\n505\n00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:31.570\nAnd really, what we wanna do is,\nwe wanna look at our systems.\n\n506\n00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:32.980\nNot every system's the same.\n\n507\n00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.900\nWe don't need to do the same\nlogging on Wes's laptop,\n\n508\n00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.230\nas I do on my DNS server, or\nmy domain controller, right?\n\n509\n00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.050\nOr my firewall.\n\n510\n00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.690\nThey're all gonna have\ndifferent levels of logging.\n\n511\n00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:48.080\nAnd so what we do is,\nwe look at the impacts of the systems.\n\n512\n00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.770\nWhat would happen if that\nsystem was compromised?\n\n513\n00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.260\nWhat kind of information is\nbeing stored on that system?\n\n514\n00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.700\nHow sensitive is that?\n\n515\n00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.200\nAgain, this goes back to doing\nour risk analysis, right?\n\n516\n00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.252\nAnd understanding the impact,\nmaking our little matrix.\n\n517\n00:28:01.252 --> 00:28:05.420\nAnd so once we got that impact matrix or\nthe risk matrix,\n\n518\n00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:11.780\nwhere I know the likelihood of occurrence\nand the impact of an occurrence,\n\n519\n00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:16.230\nI can divide my systems up into low,\nmoderate and high impact systems.\n\n520\n00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:20.560\nAnd on low impact systems, we might be\nkeeping the logs for a week or two.\n\n521\n00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.160\nAll right.\nAnd then I'm just recycling them.\n\n522\n00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.840\nI don't need to waste\nthat space storing them.\n\n523\n00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.940\nMaybe we don't need log,\n\n524\n00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:31.250\nwe transfer the logs every 24\nhours over to our seam system.\n\n525\n00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.960\nMaybe we look at them once a week or\nsomething like that.\n\n526\n00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.630\nAgain, this is not set in stone,\ndon't write these numbers down and go,\n\n527\n00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.330\nthis is exactly what\nMike said we need to do.\n\n528\n00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.370\n&gt;&gt; But it does seem like, you were\nmentioning with risk assessment there,\n\n529\n00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.520\nthat we would have to do some kind of node\ncriticality and be able to classify those.\n\n530\n00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:53.540\nBecause quantity of logs might be greatly\ndifferent between my YouTube searching and\n\n531\n00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.730\na send-off server that's\nmaybe running Apache.\n\n532\n00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:56.358\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n533\n00:28:56.358 --> 00:29:04.840\nI might transfer logs from my low\nimpact system every 24 hours.\n\n534\n00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.930\nMy high impact systems, it might be every\nfive minutes that I transfer those logs.\n\n535\n00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:10.480\nRemember it's a high impact system.\n\n536\n00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.592\nThat means we've determined that\nthe risk impact is high on those.\n\n537\n00:29:16.592 --> 00:29:19.535\nSo I better make sure\nI've got those records,\n\n538\n00:29:19.535 --> 00:29:23.292\nwhat if there is a breach,\nwhat's the bad guy gonna try to do?\n\n539\n00:29:23.292 --> 00:29:25.400\nAre they gonna try to\nwipe those log files.\n\n540\n00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.080\nAnd so\nevery five minutes I'm shipping it off.\n\n541\n00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.110\nThat way if there is a breach,\n\n542\n00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:32.430\nI'm losing five minutes of\nlog files at the most, right.\n\n543\n00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.850\nHow often do I analyze those logs?\n\n544\n00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.018\nOn those low-impact systems,\nmaybe it's once a week.\n\n545\n00:29:37.018 --> 00:29:41.370\nOn those high-impact systems, it might\nbe every hour that I go through and\n\n546\n00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:42.240\nanalyze those logs.\n\n547\n00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.740\nAnd when I say analyze the logs,\nit could be human, right?\n\n548\n00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.776\nIt could be me or\nsomebody analyzing them with human eyes.\n\n549\n00:29:49.776 --> 00:29:54.120\nOr it could be an automated system\nthat's looking for keywords or\n\n550\n00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.758\ncertain IP ranges, or\ncertain patterns in the log files.\n\n551\n00:29:57.758 --> 00:30:01.170\nAnd so it doesn't necessarily\nhave to be me every hour,\n\n552\n00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.365\nthumbing through the log files.\n\n553\n00:30:02.365 --> 00:30:05.410\nThis is why we have Seam\nsystems,this is why we have those\n\n554\n00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:10.176\ncyber security management systems,\nto help us with this amount of data right.\n\n555\n00:30:10.176 --> 00:30:14.250\nThis is where big data analytics\nis coming in to cyber security.\n\n556\n00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.622\nBecause we're realizing\nthe information is there,\n\n557\n00:30:16.622 --> 00:30:19.120\nwe've gotta make sure that\nwe're paying attention.\n\n558\n00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.920\nWe know where to get it, what\ninformation we need, how to analyze it,\n\n559\n00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.610\nhow to make sense out of all of it.\n\n560\n00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.840\n&gt;&gt; Mike, a lot of great\ninformation on data sources.\n\n561\n00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.990\nIt's so much information,\n\n562\n00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.870\nit doesn't look like we can fit\nit all into 30 minutes though.\n\n563\n00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.680\nLooking at this list that it does\nlook like we're gonna have to go into\n\n564\n00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.040\na part two.\n\n565\n00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.420\nCuz judging by that clock,\nwe don't have anymore time.\n\n566\n00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.575\nMike, before we wrap this one up, do you\nhave any additional information you might\n\n567\n00:30:40.575 --> 00:30:42.740\nwanna throw to our viewers\nabout things like logging?\n\n568\n00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.720\n&gt;&gt; I have a ton, but I think we'll\njust save it for the next episode.\n\n569\n00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.390\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell that's a great place to stop.\n\n570\n00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.270\nMike as always, thank you for\nbeing here at the ITProTV studios.\n\n571\n00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.150\nAnd thank you to you, the viewer watching.\n\n572\n00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.710\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n573\n00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:55.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n574\n00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:04.170\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n[MUSIC]\n\n575\n00:31:04.170 -->

00:00:06.183\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:06.183 --> 00:00:11.694\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.694 --> 00:00:14.545\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\nwelcome to the ITProTV studios.\n\n6\n00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:17.465\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode, we're continuing through\n\n7\n00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:21.535\nour series in logical operations,\ncyber site first responder.\n\n8\n00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:25.192\nAnd joining us back for a part two in\ndata sources, is none other than Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:25.845\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:27.870\nMike, how you doing sir?\n&gt;&gt; Doing great Wes, thanks for\n\n11\n00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.955\nhaving me back, excited to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:32.215\nSo yeah, we left off kind of in\nthe middle of a thought there,\n\n13\n00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:34.415\nran out of time in that previous episode.\n\n14\n00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:37.830\nWe've been talking about data sources,\npulling information in.\n\n15\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.132\nSo we're just gonna,\nkind of jump right back into it.\n\n16\n00:00:40.132 --> 00:00:42.290\nAt the end of the last episode,\n\n17\n00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.300\nwe were talking about configuring logging\non systems based on their impact, right?\n\n18\n00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.530\nOur low impact systems,\nwe might not monitor as often.\n\n19\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.468\nWe ship the logs over once a week and\nwe analyze those logs once a week.\n\n20\n00:00:56.468 --> 00:01:00.780\nBut we ship them over, maybe 24 hours and\nwe monitor them once a week.\n\n21\n00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.310\nWith my high-impact systems, I might be\nshipping those over every five minutes and\n\n22\n00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.940\nanalyzing those logs every six hours,\nright?\n\n23\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.840\nDepending on the impact of the system.\n\n24\n00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.150\nAlso things we need to\nthink about are going to be\n\n25\n00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.840\nwhich events should actually prompt for\nan alert, all right?\n\n26\n00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.980\nBecause our systems scan, our intrusion\ndetection, our intrusion prevention\n\n27\n00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.340\nsystems, these can be set to\nsend an alert, notify somebody.\n\n28\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.640\nWhich is a good thing, but\nthen again, it's kinda like,\n\n29\n00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.570\nwhat information am I gathering.\n\n30\n00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.630\nWhat events should trigger alerts?\n\n31\n00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.860\nNot everything should trigger an alert,\nbecause I'll end up with too many alerts,\n\n32\n00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.790\nand I won't pay attention to them.\n\n33\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.100\nBecause they're happening every five\nminutes anyway, I just ignore them.\n\n34\n00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.910\nSo I've got to make sure I'm careful and\n\n35\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.140\nwe're not doing the boy who cried wolf,\nright?\n\n36\n00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.840\nI wanna make sure our\nalerts are meaningful.\n\n37\n00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.500\nSo events that should trigger an alert,\nfaults affecting system operations, but\n\n38\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.510\nnot general status messages.\n\n39\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.373\nI need to know if DNS failed to start, but\n\n40\n00:02:00.373 --> 00:02:04.092\nI don't need to know the DNS\nstarted successfully.\n\n41\n00:02:04.092 --> 00:02:07.010\nYou're gonna see those\nevents in the log files.\n\n42\n00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.660\nSo, and I want to capture both of them,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n43\n00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.214\nBut when DNS successfully\nstarts I don't need an alert.\n\n44\n00:02:12.214 --> 00:02:15.810\nI don't need an email coming to me or\na pop-up message or anything like that.\n\n45\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.060\nBut if DNS fails to start,\nmaybe I need an alert on that one.\n\n46\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.440\nIf changes result in security or\n\n47\n00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.480\navailability problems,\nI'd like an alert on that.\n\n48\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.750\nGeneral system changes,\nprobably don't need an alert.\n\n49\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.060\nAttacks that are successful,\nI want an alert.\n\n50\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.725\nAttacks aren't successful,\nI don't want an alert.\n\n51\n00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:40.212\nNow it sounds really great,\nWes, when you talk about this.\n\n52\n00:02:40.212 --> 00:02:45.077\nBut the trick is, how do I make my system\ntell me if the alert is successful but\n\n53\n00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:47.860\nnot if it's not successful, right?\n\n54\n00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.638\nThis is understanding the information\nby analyzing logs and\n\n55\n00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:57.180\nlooking at the information,\npast attack attempts.\n\n56\n00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.910\nUnderstanding what it is that will\n\n57\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.570\ndifferentiate a successful\nattack from a failed attack.\n\n58\n00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.860\nYou might see attempted\nconnections to a share, but\n\n59\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.050\nthey don't ever actually connect.\n\n60\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.060\nSo that would be a failed attempt.\n\n61\n00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.170\nI probably want to see that in my logs,\nbut I don't need an alert.\n\n62\n00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.608\nBut if there is a successful connection to\nthat share and data is actually moved out\n\n63\n00:03:20.608 --> 00:03:23.780\nfrom an IP address range other\nthan what I've specified.\n\n64\n00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.360\nNow, not only do I wanna log that,\nbut I want an alert as well, right?\n\n65\n00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.260\nSo these are things that we can setup.\n\n66\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.035\nFailed logins are something that\nI probably want an alert on,\n\n67\n00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:36.878\nbecause those shouldn't happen very often.\n\n68\n00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:40.514\nWe're gonna have the occasional user,\nforget their password, especially if they\n\n69\n00:03:40.514 --> 00:03:43.548\nchange it on Friday and then they\ncome in on Monday, things like that.\n\n70\n00:03:43.548 --> 00:03:47.560\nThey're gonna forget their passwords,\nbut it's not gonna happen all the time.\n\n71\n00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.110\nSo I need to get alerts on that, that's\nsomething that Is indicative of an attack.\n\n72\n00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.900\nIt might be just a user forgot their\npassword, but it very well could be\n\n73\n00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.660\nsomebody doing password guessing or\nbrute-forcing on a password.\n\n74\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.910\nSo let's get an alert on failed logons.\n\n75\n00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.030\nSuccessful logons,\nI'm okay with just logging that.\n\n76\n00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.600\nI want to have a record of the fact\nthat Wes logged in at 11:30 at night,\n\n77\n00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.370\nwhen he probably shouldn't\nbe on the network.\n\n78\n00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.740\nBut I don't enter an alert,\n\n79\n00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.480\nI'll see that when I'm analyzing my logs,\nit'll stick out.\n\n80\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.660\nWow, what's he doing here so late,\nhe's such a dedicated employee, all right?\n\n81\n00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.530\nWhen it comes to processing\nall of this information, and\n\n82\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.280\nI think I mentioned it in a previous\nepisode, we want to use human eyes.\n\n83\n00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.640\nWe want to use automated tools that\ncan do pattern recognition and\n\n84\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.130\nthey can look for signs of attacks.\n\n85\n00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.640\nWe've got definitions that\nthey can base it on, but\n\n86\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.860\nwe also wanna make sure we don't just\nusing a tool, that's not enough.\n\n87\n00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.500\nWe need to get the human eyes in there,\nlooking at it,\n\n88\n00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.650\nbecause there's gonna be things\nthat the tools are learning, right?\n\n89\n00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.430\nBut sometimes it's the,\nsometimes the tools don't put one and\n\n90\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.770\none together to get two.\n\n91\n00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.755\nAnd it's the human\naspect that can do that.\n\n92\n00:04:58.755 --> 00:05:04.170\nThey can see an event on this log and this\nlog and make that jump or that correlation\n\n93\n00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.470\nin our brain, that my automated\nsystem might or might not have made.\n\n94\n00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.099\nSo it's important that we have\nhuman eyes on these logs.\n\n95\n00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.670\nOne of the big challenges we\nend up with is the variety and\n\n96\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.240\nformats that these log files will come in.\n\n97\n00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.110\nIt's not a standard, right?\n\n98\n00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.220\nYou look at a Windows event log,\nversus an event log from a Cisco router,\n\n99\n00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.180\nversus the event log from a Syslog\nsystem and a UNIX based system.\n\n100\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.392\nCould be completely different.\n\n101\n00:05:32.392 --> 00:05:37.269\nThey all get the same information most of\nthe time, but the format is not the same.\n\n102\n00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:41.715\n&gt;&gt; I look at those SNMB or SNMP OIDs.\n\n103\n00:05:41.715 --> 00:05:44.530\nI can't remember them, and\nthey're just a string of long numbers,\n\n104\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.330\nthere's no way in heck.\n\n105\n00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.430\nI need some kind of MIB, that'll help\nme to interpret that information.\n\n106\n00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.475\nBecause a string of characters,\nI can't even spell my name half the time.\n\n107\n00:05:51.475 --> 00:05:54.018\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nwhat one call's a process id,\n\n108\n00:05:54.018 --> 00:05:56.754\nthe other one calls something\nslightly different.\n\n109\n00:05:56.754 --> 00:06:00.990\nTime stamp versus event\ntime versus something else.\n\n110\n00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.020\nSometimes pulling\nthe information together and\n\n111\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.040\nunderstanding the different\nformats is a challenge.\n\n112\n00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.900\nWe just have to make sure that we\ndo our due diligence, I guess.\n\n113\n00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.910\nWe have to make sure that we spend\ntime looking at those router logs.\n\n114\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.320\nWe understand what fields are available,\n\n115\n00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.140\nunderstanding what those\nWindows event logs.\n\n116\n00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.730\nAnd being able to correlate\na Linux log and a Windows log.\n\n117\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.720\nAnd get the same information, even though\nthey're in different formats, right?\n\n118\n00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.540\nWe have tools that can normalize.\n\n119\n00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.556\nThat's what they call, when we say pulling\nall these logs in from different systems,\n\n120\n00:06:33.556 --> 00:06:35.052\nand then normalizing the data.\n\n121\n00:06:35.052 --> 00:06:39.137\nIt is trying to get it to where I\ncan look at all the information,\n\n122\n00:06:39.137 --> 00:06:43.839\nindependent of the fact that this came\nfrom a Cisco router versus this one\n\n123\n00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:46.340\ncame from a Windows log, right?\n\n124\n00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.520\nNormalizing it,\ngetting it all in one place so\n\n125\n00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.900\nthat I can look at it all together.\n\n126\n00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:56.711\nWe can typically aggregate that into\na single database or some kind of form.\n\n127\n00:06:56.711 --> 00:07:01.171\nSo again, these automated tools can\nreally help with that information.\n\n128\n00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:03.970\nWe also have to keep in\nmind external data sources.\n\n129\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:10.895\nThis can be especially helpful for\nanticipating and preventing threats.\n\n130\n00:07:10.895 --> 00:07:15.623\nIf I see on my reader that let's\nyou use flash, for example,\n\n131\n00:07:15.623 --> 00:07:18.981\ncuz it seems to be the butt\nof a lot of jokes.\n\n132\n00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:22.821\nThat there's a new vulnerability for,\nlet's just say software XYZ,\n\n133\n00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:25.500\nthat we're running in our organization.\n\n134\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.370\nAnd on my reader, that morning I come in,\nand I see there's this new vulnerability\n\n135\n00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.740\nfor the version of this software\nthat we run on our network, right?\n\n136\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.420\nWell, we haven't been attacked yet,\nthere's been no breaches.\n\n137\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.750\nBut because I've spotted this,\nusing this external data source,\n\n138\n00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.350\nI've been made aware of this new\nvulnerability in this software.\n\n139\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.470\nI can now do my research, and there's\na good chance there's a patch out for it.\n\n140\n00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.138\nAnd I can go get that patch, or\nI can at least be looking for\n\n141\n00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:54.210\nthat patch, cuz you know the software\nvendors are working on it.\n\n142\n00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.423\nThe bug has been released.\n\n143\n00:07:55.423 --> 00:07:58.880\nThey're hopefully already made, or they're\nin the process of making a patch, and\n\n144\n00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.962\nnow I can stay on top of it.\n\n145\n00:07:59.962 --> 00:08:03.758\nIt can be something that I check every\nhour to To see when they finally release\n\n146\n00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:07.180\nthat and get it on my systems\nbefore I'm ever compromised.\n\n147\n00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.010\nSo there was no,\nnow we've been compromised.\n\n148\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.420\nThere's this vulnerability.\n\n149\n00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.420\nI should've known about that.\n\n150\n00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.312\nOr I could've been patched against it.\n\n151\n00:08:14.312 --> 00:08:17.572\nSo using external data sources,\nother than just your logs and\n\n152\n00:08:17.572 --> 00:08:21.250\neverything coming from the system,\nis also very important.\n\n153\n00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.480\nTalking to the vendors.\n\n154\n00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.300\nTalking to anti-malware vendors.\n\n155\n00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.540\nTalking to your, or\nmonitoring your hardwares and\n\n156\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.756\nsoftware vendors websites for\nsecurity related information.\n\n157\n00:08:31.756 --> 00:08:37.150\nIt could be, also when we talk\nabout external data sources,\n\n158\n00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.790\nit could be external to log files.\n\n159\n00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:42.530\nWe've talked a lot about logs from\ndifferent systems, which is routers,\n\n160\n00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:48.520\nfirewalls, nodes, all of that good stuff,\nbut what about business operating hours?\n\n161\n00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.480\nOr employee working travel schedules?\n\n162\n00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.810\nMike, who cares?\n\n163\n00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.300\nWhat's that information got to do\nwith CyberSec First Responder?\n\n164\n00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.580\nWhat was that have to do with?\n\n165\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:04.440\nWell, if I know that our hours\nare from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM, and\n\n166\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:10.560\nI see logon activity at 1AM, that's\ngonna be something that I wanna look at.\n\n167\n00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.790\nOr if I see that Wes was logged\non this morning at 9 AM which is\n\n168\n00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.390\nperfectly normal except for\nthe fact that Wes is in Tahiti right now.\n\n169\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.210\nHe's not even at work.\n\n170\n00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.480\nI wouldn't know except that I've got my\nemployee schedules, my holiday schedules,\n\n171\n00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.070\nthings like that, so.\n\n172\n00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.010\nYou've got to kinda of go and think wow.\n\n173\n00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.390\nNot just my log files, there's data\ninformation I can pull from all different\n\n174\n00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:40.030\nlocations that are gonna help me analyze\nand interpret these results, all right?\n\n175\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.280\nPublicly available information I was\ntalking about that, free registries,\n\n176\n00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.340\nyou can go out to security blogs,\nsocial media, mailing lists,\n\n177\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.080\nnews groups, news feeds,\nannouncements by product vendors.\n\n178\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.840\nThere's a ton of information, and\n\n179\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.000\nyou have to make sure that you\nare staying on top of that.\n\n180\n00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.860\nSo subscribing to some of these\nnews feeds, making sure that you're\n\n181\n00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.450\nmaking time in your day to look through\nthem is gonna be very important.\n\n182\n00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.200\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you've been mentioning\nthings like SCADA systems,\n\n183\n00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.910\nSEAMS systems, big data out there.\n\n184\n00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.180\nSeems like it could be\na very daunting task in and\n\n185\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.410\nof itself, collecting the information and\nthen analyzing that information.\n\n186\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.280\nAre there things that we\nhave to assist us and\n\n187\n00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.490\nhelp us do some of the heavy lifting\nwhen it comes to the amount and\n\n188\n00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.790\nthe quantity of data that we could\npotentially be talking about here?\n\n189\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.710\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n190\n00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.210\nAnd we've mentioned it a couple times,\nand we'll say it again,\n\n191\n00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.300\nthe SIEM systems, right.\n\n192\n00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.540\nThat's really what they're about,\nand SIEM,\n\n193\n00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:38.050\nif I haven't defined that acronym in the\nlast few episodes, let's do that again.\n\n194\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.490\nSystem Information and Event Management.\n\n195\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:46.860\nThis is all about collecting up system\ninformation from multiple devices\n\n196\n00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.440\nacross our network, event logs, and then\nbeing able to analyze that information.\n\n197\n00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.620\nBecause again, big data is\nreally what we're talking about.\n\n198\n00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.590\nBig data analytics and that's where\nmy SIEM system is coming up late.\n\n199\n00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.575\nBecause its not just looking\nat system logs anymore,\n\n200\n00:11:01.575 --> 00:11:04.275\nit's not just doing\nsome network forensics.\n\n201\n00:11:04.275 --> 00:11:06.990\nIt's pulling all of this\ninformation together.\n\n202\n00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.900\nAnd that's where,\nas Wes was alluding to do that the SIEM\n\n203\n00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.350\nsystems can come into play because they\ncan help me automate this process.\n\n204\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.160\nI can develop a system\nof what information.\n\n205\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.710\nYou pull all these raw log files in and\nthen we take that information from that\n\n206\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:27.130\nrouter log and we take certain fields and\nwe dump it into our database.\n\n207\n00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.870\nAnd the same thing from\nthe logs from a server.\n\n208\n00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.130\nWe pull out the important information and\nwe put in this database.\n\n209\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.450\nAnd now I can generate reports on it.\n\n210\n00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.750\nI can look it depending\non the application,\n\n211\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.230\nthese SIEM systems are gonna have\ngreat reporting capabilities.\n\n212\n00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:47.020\nI can, very customizable, so I can get\nthe information back out that I need.\n\n213\n00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.370\nAnd that's what makes these systems so\n\n214\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.810\ngreat is they're gonna pull\nall the information in.\n\n215\n00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.010\nAnd I'm gonna have it there in\nthis huge repository, big data.\n\n216\n00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.570\nAnd I can use the SIEM systems for\n\n217\n00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:01.390\nmy analytics to be able to work with\nthat data makes sense out of that data.\n\n218\n00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.595\nBecause it's so much information and\nthat's what we're finding.\n\n219\n00:12:04.595 --> 00:12:09.560\nThere's so much information becomes a very\ndaunting task to try to do this solely\n\n220\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.030\nas a human.\n\n221\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.040\nWe really need the help of these tools.\n\n222\n00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.800\nMike, earlier, you mentioned in\ninformation processing that we got to be\n\n223\n00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.940\ncareful with the difference in the\ncomputer elements or artificial element,\n\n224\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.630\nI guess I should say,\nand the human element.\n\n225\n00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.720\nIs that something that's gonna\nfall into place here too as\n\n226\n00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.960\nit's not overlooking the fact that we\ncan't just automate everything, right?\n\n227\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.200\nWe're going to have to have some\nphysical bodies present, right?\n\n228\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, SIEM systems don't\nreplace the human analyst.\n\n229\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.750\nYou've gotta make sure that we\nhave eyes on those systems.\n\n230\n00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.910\nIt's nice to think you could just\noffload everything to the system and\n\n231\n00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:43.990\nbe done with it.\n\n232\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.890\nAnd I know some of the C level people\nwill probably like that too cuz they\n\n233\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.570\ncould reduce their salaries.\n\n234\n00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.220\nWhy am I paying you?\n\n235\n00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.600\nI've got the SIEM system\nthat does all this.\n\n236\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.470\nBut you really still\nneed the human analyst.\n\n237\n00:12:54.470 --> 00:13:00.820\nI mean until Watson or some of these\nother, til we get the true AI.\n\n238\n00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.080\nThere's still certain things\nthat the human brain can do,\n\n239\n00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.810\nputting things together.\n\n240\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.300\nI was trying to think of an example.\n\n241\n00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.530\nLike when we talk about\nvulnerability scanners, right?\n\n242\n00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.180\nVulnerability scanners are great.\n\n243\n00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.548\nThey can really help me\nautomate the process.\n\n244\n00:13:20.548 --> 00:13:24.720\nThere are tens of thousands of\nvulnerabilities that I need to check my\n\n245\n00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.810\nsystem for.\n\n246\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.510\nI'm not gonna do that one at a time.\n\n247\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:32.620\nI've got a tool that allows me to scan and\nhas a database of definitions.\n\n248\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.670\nAnd it scans my servers and\nit looks for these vulnerabilities and\n\n249\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.150\nit gives me a great report in the end.\n\n250\n00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:43.130\nBut that being said, some of the things\n\n251\n00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.640\nthat don't show up in vulnerabilities,\nbecause it's just looking at definitions.\n\n252\n00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.630\nThe human can say, yeah, that might be\nlow impact, and that might be low impact.\n\n253\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.410\nBut put those two together and\nwe've got a serious problem.\n\n254\n00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.910\nYour vulnerability scanner is not\ngonna do that for you, right?\n\n255\n00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:00.390\nThis is where that human analyst\ncomes into play and says, we've got\n\n256\n00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.110\nthis weakness on the router and by that\nitself that's not that big of a deal but\n\n257\n00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:08.590\nwe also get this weakness over here and\nthat could lead to big problems, right?\n\n258\n00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.280\nAnd so that's where that human element\ncomes into play and this is what\n\n259\n00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.410\ndifferentiates a vulnerability scan\nfrom a penetration test, right?\n\n260\n00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.214\nOther people will try to use\nthose terms interchangeably and\n\n261\n00:14:17.214 --> 00:14:18.177\nthey're most definitely not.\n\n262\n00:14:18.177 --> 00:14:23.440\nThe penetration test, one phase of\nthat is a vulnerability scan, right.\n\n263\n00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.190\nBut it's the penetration tester,\nthe person that's doing this work,\n\n264\n00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:30.250\nthat's taking that information and\ncombining it with other information.\n\n265\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:34.777\nAnd picking up on completely new vectors\nof attack that the vulnerability scanner\n\n266\n00:14:34.777 --> 00:14:39.430\ndoesn't have a definition for us,\nso it's never gonna pop up, right?\n\n267\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.570\nSo important to make sure we understand\nthat you can buy the best SIEM\n\n268\n00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.900\nsystem in the world, it's still not\na replacement for the human analyst.\n\n269\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.515\nSo our jobs are safe in other words.\n\n270\n00:14:48.515 --> 00:14:50.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I was gonna say,\n\n271\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.820\nearlier in this episode, or actually\nI believe it was in the first part,\n\n272\n00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.690\nyou mentioned a little bit\nabout things like policies.\n\n273\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.611\nYou mentioned things like HIPAA and\n\n274\n00:14:57.611 --> 00:15:00.260\n[INAUDIBLE] I think I\nmight say that right.\n\n275\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.480\nI've never say that one right.\n\n276\n00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.050\nAnd I think of things like FISA and stuff.\n\n277\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.730\nAnd we have to worry about that, right?\n\n278\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.750\nCuz this information that we're analyzing\ncould potentially hold information that\n\n279\n00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.860\nunder a regulatory reason, not anybody\nshould just be having access to, right?\n\n280\n00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.950\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, understand the term\ndata regulation, or I'm sorry,\n\n281\n00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:21.450\ndata retention and make sure that when\nwe think about this, what we're trying\n\n282\n00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.000\nto do is decide what data do I need to\nretain and what do I not need to retain.\n\n283\n00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.594\nWe've got a lot of information.\n\n284\n00:15:26.594 --> 00:15:30.940\nAnd some of that I'm gonna need to keep,\nsome of it I might not.\n\n285\n00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.860\nHow long do I keep it for and\nwhat is it that I have to keep?\n\n286\n00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.400\nSome of this is gonna be determined\nby your own organization.\n\n287\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.320\nBut we also have to keep\nin mind as Wes said,\n\n288\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.220\nthere's gonna be regulations that\ncould apply to our industry.\n\n289\n00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.920\nThat we will have to take\ninto account as well,\n\n290\n00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.610\non top of what we already want to do.\n\n291\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.903\nWe say, hey you know what,\n\n292\n00:15:49.903 --> 00:15:52.786\nit'll be a good idea to keep\nthis information for two years.\n\n293\n00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:57.216\nUntil we learn that this regulation says\nwe've gotta keep it for seven years.\n\n294\n00:15:57.216 --> 00:15:58.661\nSo we need to follow that,\n\n295\n00:15:58.661 --> 00:16:03.080\neven though it's not exactly what we\nwanted Now there's a regulation in play.\n\n296\n00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.948\nAnd always wanna you've\ngotta do your due diligence.\n\n297\n00:16:05.948 --> 00:16:10.192\nYou should have people on staff that are\nprobably knowledgable in the regulations\n\n298\n00:16:10.192 --> 00:16:12.480\nand the requirements of said regulations.\n\n299\n00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.430\nYou wanna if not bring somebody in.\n\n300\n00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:20.370\nI mean this is opening yourselves\nup to liability if you don't.\n\n301\n00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.300\nIf they come in and do, let's say, HIPAA\ncomes in and does an audit, for example,\n\n302\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.370\nand they find that you're not protecting\nthe customer information properly.\n\n303\n00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:35.360\nIt can be upwards of $5,000\nper incident on these\n\n304\n00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.960\nfines that you're gonna get levied, this\nliability that you're gonna have to face.\n\n305\n00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:44.170\nAnd so, we've gotta make sure we\nunderstand what the regulations tell us,\n\n306\n00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.120\nhow long we have to keep the information,\nwhen and\n\n307\n00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.960\nhow to dispose of that information.\n\n308\n00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.650\nOnce the retention period's over,\ndo I just take that banker's box and\n\n309\n00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.620\nthrow it in the garbage?\n\n310\n00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.300\nOr does it have to go in the shredder?\n\n311\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.900\nDo those hard drives have to get DoD\nwiped or can I just delete the file?\n\n312\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.170\nAnd everything is good.\n\n313\n00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.220\nThe data retention in itself\ncan vary by industry.\n\n314\n00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.970\nDoesn't mean keep an electronic copy, or\n\n315\n00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.460\ndoes it mean actual physical\ndocument somewhere?\n\n316\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.460\nLike I said,\nin banker's boxes that you have to keep.\n\n317\n00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.690\nTalk to your lawyers, you know?\n\n318\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.700\nMake sure there's an organization.\n\n319\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.770\nThis is where you need\nto bring in the experts.\n\n320\n00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.650\nOne of the big things I always\nlike to tell people and\n\n321\n00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:31.420\nmake sure everybody understands is, it's\nokay to not be an expert in everything.\n\n322\n00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.590\nIf you're that IT person,\nyou're the security guy,\n\n323\n00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.210\nthat doesn't mean you're\nan expert in right?\n\n324\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.630\nBut there are people that are.\n\n325\n00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.110\nSo if you are, great.\n\n326\n00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:44.320\nBut if you're not, don't be afraid\nto say you know what organization,\n\n327\n00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.550\nI don't have the best\nunderstanding of this.\n\n328\n00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.710\nLet's make sure we bring in\nsomebody to consult with this and\n\n329\n00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.485\nhelp us with this to make sure\nwe're doing this correctly.\n\n330\n00:17:54.485 --> 00:17:59.470\nOunce of prevention is worth a pound of\ncure or some old saying like that, right?\n\n331\n00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:04.087\nTaking care of this ahead of time is\njust gonna cover you in the future\n\n332\n00:18:04.087 --> 00:18:06.924\nwhen it comes to liability and lawsuits.\n\n333\n00:18:06.924 --> 00:18:09.903\nAnd protecting your network cuz that's\nreally what it's about, it's protecting my\n\n334\n00:18:09.903 --> 00:18:12.555\norganization, protecting my data,\nmaking sure that we're in business and\n\n335\n00:18:12.555 --> 00:18:14.950\nmaking money\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like you're saying as well,\n\n336\n00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.850\nignorance is not an excuse,\n\n337\n00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.230\nand audit the auditors here\n&gt;&gt; Yes absolutely,\n\n338\n00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.070\nyou can't say I didn't know, right,\nthat's what due diligence comes into play.\n\n339\n00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:27.960\nIf you are in the healthcare industry,\nyou better know HIPAA, or you better have\n\n340\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.660\nsomebody on your speed dial that\nyou can call and ask questions to.\n\n341\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.740\nYou can talk to other industries.\n\n342\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.430\nGo talk to the security guys for\n\n343\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.310\nanother organization that's\nin your vertical, right?\n\n344\n00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.530\nOr in the same field as you.\n\n345\n00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.530\nHey, how do you deal with this?\n\n346\n00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.140\nLet's talk about it.\n\n347\n00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:48.101\nAnd we're not gonna give up company\nsecrets but we can definitely\n\n348\n00:18:48.101 --> 00:18:52.722\nshare some of that information to help,\nit can be beneficial to both sides.\n\n349\n00:18:52.722 --> 00:18:56.504\nAll right, let's talk a little bit now,\n\n350\n00:18:56.504 --> 00:19:01.810\nas we talked about data retention,\nconfiguration file.\n\n351\n00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:07.251\nSo now we're gonna start taking a look\nat some of the actual information,\n\n352\n00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:10.341\nwhere we can pull this information from.\n\n353\n00:19:10.341 --> 00:19:15.429\nAnd the first thing they mentioned is\nnetwork device configuration files.\n\n354\n00:19:15.429 --> 00:19:19.957\nSo let me pull one up for us really quick.\n\n355\n00:19:19.957 --> 00:19:21.573\nAll right, so\nI have got a config file here.\n\n356\n00:19:21.573 --> 00:19:25.130\nI'm just gonna open up really quick,\ntake a look.\n\n357\n00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.180\nZoom in for everybody.\n\n358\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.130\nThat looks good.\n\n359\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:31.200\nAnd this is just a config file off\nof one of our test routers, so\n\n360\n00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.410\nit's not any great information.\n\n361\n00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.630\nDon't worry, I'm not giving away\nthe secrets here at ITProTV.\n\n362\n00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.869\nBut we can see things like domain name,\n\n363\n00:19:40.869 --> 00:19:44.983\nmulticast, looks like no IPv6 cvf.\n\n364\n00:19:44.983 --> 00:19:49.070\nThere's some information\nabout the interfaces, right?\n\n365\n00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:54.226\nThere's the IP address and\nthe subnet mask, speed, duplex.\n\n366\n00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:58.710\nAnd so this is a couple things that we\nshould think about when we're looking at\n\n367\n00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:59.470\nthis information.\n\n368\n00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:05.580\nOne, good for me to have as a security\nprofessional for the organization.\n\n369\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.327\nI need my baselines, I need my config\nfiles, so if anything happens I can go\n\n370\n00:20:09.327 --> 00:20:13.288\nback and I can restore those or\nI understand what those settings were.\n\n371\n00:20:13.288 --> 00:20:16.981\nWe also wanna think about,\nas far as the bad guy goes,\n\n372\n00:20:16.981 --> 00:20:20.101\nthis is a relatively simple config file,\nbut\n\n373\n00:20:20.101 --> 00:20:25.359\nthere can be a lot of sensitive\ninformation stored in configuration files,\n\n374\n00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:29.631\nso protecting those config files\non your different devices,\n\n375\n00:20:29.631 --> 00:20:32.695\nis going to became very important, right.\n\n376\n00:20:32.695 --> 00:20:35.965\nOther things we wanna think about,\n\n377\n00:20:35.965 --> 00:20:41.530\ngood old device state data like\nrouting tables for example.\n\n378\n00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.740\nLike let's take a look at\nmy Windows machine here.\n\n379\n00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:49.470\nTo see my routing table,\nI can do a little route, print, and\n\n380\n00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.260\nI can see the routing table for\nthis particular node.\n\n381\n00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.940\nIt's not gonna be all that important on\nyour end points, but on your servers and\n\n382\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.680\non your routers, that might be something\nthat you gotta take a look at, or\n\n383\n00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:06.280\nyou might have custom routes that\nyou push out to your devices,\n\n384\n00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.790\nthat you need to make sure are there,\nbut pulling this information, again,\n\n385\n00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:16.520\nis what's a good way to say, we wanna make\nsure we're collecting this information.\n\n386\n00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.910\nSo routing tables can\ncontain device state data.\n\n387\n00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.250\nWe also wanna think about cam tables.\n\n388\n00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:27.140\nCam tables are content addressable memory.\n\n389\n00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.470\nAnd this is what switches use, right?\n\n390\n00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:32.691\nWe've talked about switches in other\nclasses like in Network Plus and\n\n391\n00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:33.700\nother classes.\n\n392\n00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.630\nWe know that a switch has what we\ncall content addressable memory, or\n\n393\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:44.930\na CAM table, and that's where it maps\nthe MAC addresses to the ports, right?\n\n394\n00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:45.520\nRight?\n\n395\n00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.235\nAnd so that when a switch is supposed to\nonly send out traffic out a port if that\n\n396\n00:21:49.235 --> 00:21:51.080\nnode is located out that port.\n\n397\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.990\nHow does he know what\nnodes are out that port?\n\n398\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.660\nThat cam table.\n\n399\n00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.160\nIf I can get that information\nfrom that cam table,\n\n400\n00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.930\nthat information could be\nmodified as part of an attack.\n\n401\n00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.520\nSo I need to make sure I know\nwhat should be in there.\n\n402\n00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.900\nI need to make sure we're monitoring that,\nwe're collecting that information.\n\n403\n00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.540\nNAT tables, same thing.\n\n404\n00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.890\nA lot of information, a lot of NAT,\nnetwork address translation,\n\n405\n00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:16.918\nmapping private to public IP addresses so\nthat we can use those internal\n\n406\n00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:21.450\nranges inside and\nstill have people getting Internet access.\n\n407\n00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:25.290\nWe've gotta make sure we\nhave got that information.\n\n408\n00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.610\nDNS caches,\nanother great source of information.\n\n409\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.840\nIn fact,\nI could show you here on my system,\n\n410\n00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.650\nhopefully nothing too embarrassing.\n\n411\n00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:38.770\nI do a little IP config, forward slash,\ndisplay DNS, for example.\n\n412\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.709\nI can go back through here,\nand I can see, whoops.\n\n413\n00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.170\nEverything is timed out.\n\n414\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.720\nI haven't been on the internet in a while.\n\n415\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.670\nLast pass is the last thing I saw.\n\n416\n00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.880\nBut in here,\nthis is recently resolved names.\n\n417\n00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.620\nI should say recently resolved,\nfully qualified domain names or\n\n418\n00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.370\nDNS names, mappings to IP addresses.\n\n419\n00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.880\nAnd from this information I can\nsee where that device has gone?\n\n420\n00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.570\nAlmost you can see their Internet\nhistory basically through here.\n\n421\n00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.220\nSo if I've got a compromised machine.\n\n422\n00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:15.840\nI might wanna pull the DNS cache,\nmake sure I grab that before times out.\n\n423\n00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.460\nOr if there's anything left in it\nbecause it does time out automatically.\n\n424\n00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.400\nEventually those records\nare purged from that cache.\n\n425\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.320\nSo, pulling back that information.\n\n426\n00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:26.930\nWhat else?\n\n427\n00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.760\nARP caches are another\none that we can look at.\n\n428\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:37.020\nIf I do an arp -a,\nI can see all my IP to mac addresses.\n\n429\n00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.620\nThese are cached on my system.\n\n430\n00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:45.580\nAnd looking at this information, I could\nlook for spoofing scenarios where I\n\n431\n00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:50.520\nsee two different IP addresses, point it\nback to the same MAC address would be\n\n432\n00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.759\nan indication of a man in the middle\ntype of attack or something like that.\n\n433\n00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.480\nSo pulling this information back,\nit would be important.\n\n434\n00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.430\nSo, I guess in the end the point here is\nthat there's a lot of information and\n\n435\n00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:07.795\na lot of different places not just your\nlog files that we think about immediately.\n\n436\n00:24:07.795 --> 00:24:10.230\nWe've gotta make sure we understand\n\n437\n00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.650\nall different places that we\ncan pull this information from.\n\n438\n00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.656\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike, well that's\nstill a lot of great information.\n\n439\n00:24:15.656 --> 00:24:19.844\nI keep looking at this bullet list that\ndoes look like we're gonna have to go into\n\n440\n00:24:19.844 --> 00:24:23.783\na part 3 when it comes to data sources\nbecause, as you probably found out by\n\n441\n00:24:23.783 --> 00:24:26.650\nnow part 2 here,\nwe got a lot of sources to check out.\n\n442\n00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.330\nBut, it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n443\n00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.900\nMike, did you have any additional words\nthat you might like to throw into this one\n\n444\n00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.610\nor are we gonna leave them\nwith the Mike cliffhanger?\n\n445\n00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.020\n&gt;&gt; Let's do the Mike cliffhanger.\n\n446\n00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, that's cruel and\nunusual torture there.\n\n447\n00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.910\nMike, thanks for\nbeing here with us in the ITProTV studios.\n\n448\n00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.030\nWe appreciate you, the viewer, watching.\n\n449\n00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.670\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n450\n00:24:46.670 -->

00:00:11.492\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:14.996\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.996 --> 00:00:16.575\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:21.205\nAnd in today's episode, we're continuing\nthrough our series in logical operations\n\n7\n00:00:21.205 --> 00:00:22.735\nCyberSec First Responder, and\n\n8\n00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:26.182\nwe're actually working on a little\nmini series here, and that is sources.\n\n9\n00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:30.222\nWe're back with the part three and joining\nus back in the studio is Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:31.402\nMike how are you doing sir?\n\n11\n00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:32.062\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing very well,\n\n12\n00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:35.612\nthanks for having me back and yeah we\ndo have quite a series going on here.\n\n13\n00:00:35.612 --> 00:00:39.082\nBut there's a lot of places\nto get information and\n\n14\n00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:44.450\nthat's really what this module or\nthis particular objective is all about.\n\n15\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.590\nSo, let's just pick up where we left\noff and we were talking about some of\n\n16\n00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.370\nthe different locations as far as\nnetwork device data or state data like\n\n17\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.680\nyour routing tables on your routers,\nyour CAM tables on your switches.\n\n18\n00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.760\nAnd we talked a little about\nwhat I might find in there and\n\n19\n00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.010\nwhy I need to protect that\ninformation about our networks.\n\n20\n00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.950\nThose routing tables, right,\nif the outside world could\n\n21\n00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.950\nsomehow get your router to\nshare that routing information.\n\n22\n00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.790\nThey can find information about your\ninternal network organization which is\n\n23\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.360\ngonna make it easier for the bad guys\nto step through your network, right.\n\n24\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.240\nYour CAM tables,\n\n25\n00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.270\nwhere your switchers are keeping track of\nwhat MAC addresses lie out what ports.\n\n26\n00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.740\nIf somebody's manipulating\nthat information,\n\n27\n00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.810\nthey might be try to sniff data.\n\n28\n00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.520\nRemember, one of the things\nabout when we sniff traffic,\n\n29\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.010\nwe only see the traffic that's\ndestined for our network adapter and\n\n30\n00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.880\nwe go on to promiscuous mode now\nwe can see all the data even if\n\n31\n00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.880\nit is not bound for us unless we're\non a switch Ethernet environment.\n\n32\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.540\nAnd now all of a sudden the switch\nis filtering the data before\n\n33\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.510\nit ever gets to me.\n\n34\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.400\nSo how can I sniff Wes' traffic right\nif I can't but if I can get in and\n\n35\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.350\nI CAM table and convince that switch that\nWes' MAC address lies out my port then\n\n36\n00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.340\nmaybe I can get it to send his data out of\nmy port, I could capture that information.\n\n37\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.780\nSo playing around that CAM table.\n\n38\n00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.050\nNAT tables again can give up\na lot of information about\n\n39\n00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.910\nyour internal networks and\nDNS caches and ARP caches.\n\n40\n00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.030\nRemember DNS is named IP address mappings,\nthis is where I can do spoofing,\n\n41\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.200\nif I can convince your machine\nthat BankofAmerica.com\n\n42\n00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.380\nis my IP address,\nthat can lead to attacks, right.\n\n43\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.840\nThe ARP cache, this is how we do man in\nthe middle attacks, is I convince one\n\n44\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.980\nend of the conversation that the MAC\naddress he's trying to reach is me and\n\n45\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.480\nI convince the other end of the\nconversation that the MAC address they're\n\n46\n00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.100\ntrying to reach is me, and\nI can get that traffic to flow through me.\n\n47\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.740\nAll using, or poisoning, for example.\n\n48\n00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.410\nSo, gotta protect that information.\n\n49\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.720\nOther information that we are gonna\ngather, switches and router logs.\n\n50\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.260\nWe talked about all the different\nlog files that are out there,\n\n51\n00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.840\nthat we need to gather.\n\n52\n00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.940\nSwitches and routers.\n\n53\n00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.190\nWhat information do we have there?\n\n54\n00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.710\nWell, think about what\nthose devices are doing.\n\n55\n00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.340\nYour router, that's where all that, your\nIs routing between different networks so\n\n56\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.900\nit's got a record of data\nthat's traversing that router\n\n57\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.420\nincoming and outgoing.\n\n58\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.150\nMost of these routers and switches,\nwe can adjust their verbosity.\n\n59\n00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.220\nWe can control how much they're logging.\n\n60\n00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.800\nSo we can try and get it out, the whole\ngoal, remember, is to get everything we\n\n61\n00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.480\nneed but not too much extra which\nsounds easy enough but it's really not.\n\n62\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.090\nWe don't wanna monitor everything\npretty close to it here, right?\n\n63\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.240\nSo we gotta find out where\nwe can limit what we can.\n\n64\n00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.470\nSource and destination information\ncan be found in there.\n\n65\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.660\nWireless device logs,\nyour wireless access points.\n\n66\n00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.060\nThey're much like routers, same type of\ninformation I'm gonna see in those logs,\n\n67\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.700\nconnections that are being established,\n\n68\n00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.120\nwhat that IP address was from\nthe node that was trying to connect.\n\n69\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.110\nLet's take a, actually, you know what,\nlet's do this, let's take a look at,\n\n70\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.500\nI've got a couple images here and\nI'll have to zoom into these as we go.\n\n71\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.480\nSo you can pull up my screen for me.\n\n72\n00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.890\nSo I've got a couple captures here.\n\n73\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.675\nI just wanna show you the basics of,\nlike for example this is a firewall log.\n\n74\n00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:14.500\nAnd they're all gonna look a little\ndifferent depending on the device,\n\n75\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.610\nand what is designed to capture, but here,\nthis is just one from Windows firewall.\n\n76\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.800\nAnd you can see if you look at these\ncolumns you got date, time, whether it was\n\n77\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.150\nallowed or not, protocol, IP address for\nthe source, for the destination.\n\n78\n00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.140\nSource port, destination port and them\nsome more information about the packet\n\n79\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.120\nitself, size and flags and\nthings like that.\n\n80\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.650\nAnd different firewalls will log different\nthings, but remember we're gonna talk\n\n81\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.680\na little bit later, probably not this\nepisode we'll get into another episode.\n\n82\n00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.400\nI'm gonna show you guys how we\ncan work with these logs and\n\n83\n00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.810\nmake it a little bit easier, grab just\nthe information we need out of these logs.\n\n84\n00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.650\nThis is where SIEM systems will help, but\nif you're in a small organization and\n\n85\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.690\nyou don't have a SIEM system,\nthere are tools available that we can use\n\n86\n00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.940\nto help us sift through, if you will,\nall of this information.\n\n87\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.570\nSo that's an example of\na Windows firewall log.\n\n88\n00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.690\nOther logs we've gotta look at,\nand we'll look at some more later.\n\n89\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.420\nBut let me just mention a few of them now.\n\n90\n00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.480\nThe web application firewalls.\n\n91\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.749\nThese are gonna do a little bit different.\n\n92\n00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.250\nYou're firewall logs, again you're seeing\nall the traffic that is coming in and\n\n93\n00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.250\nout of that firewall.\n\n94\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.250\nWe look at a web application firewall.\n\n95\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.730\nThese are firewalls that we run\nspecifically for web application.\n\n96\n00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.870\nSo on our web server they are not\ndesigned to protect the entire host,\n\n97\n00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.670\nthey are going to protect\nthe application itself.\n\n98\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.110\n&gt;&gt; Would this be something Mike,\n\n99\n00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.920\nthat we might be using just to detect\nsomething like a SQL injection attack or\n\n100\n00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.540\nmaybe a cross site scripting\nattack something like that?\n\n101\n00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.500\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n102\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.580\nThat's what these firewalls\nare really designed to do as protect\n\n103\n00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.950\nthat web application.\n\n104\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.000\nSo they have rules in there,\nthat they are looking for\n\n105\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.740\nsymptoms of or a pattern of cross\nsite scripting or SQL injection.\n\n106\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.247\nThese are typically,\nthey're application layer firewalls, so\n\n107\n00:06:02.247 --> 00:06:05.010\nthey are gonna apply\nrules to HTTP traffic.\n\n108\n00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.540\nAnd they'll record all kinds of\ninformation from that application's point\n\n109\n00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.530\nof view, source, what rule was\nmatching it, why this was logged,\n\n110\n00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.160\nwhat action it was taking.\n\n111\n00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.700\nThe HTTP method, where there was a get,\nwhere there was a post.\n\n112\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.480\nQueries, path to files that were delivered\nin that post process or get process.\n\n113\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.830\nSo wireless access, or\nI'm sorry, wireless.\n\n114\n00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.870\nI keep saying wireless.\n\n115\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.130\nYou see WA and\nyou really wanna say wireless, don't you?\n\n116\n00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.740\nWeb application firewalls,\nif I can get that right.\n\n117\n00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.820\n&gt;&gt; I got to bring it in here too.\n\n118\n00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.550\nI looked at it and I thought it was\nthe Windows Advanced Firewall or\n\n119\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.084\nAdvanced Firewall with Security there.\n\n120\n00:06:40.084 --> 00:06:43.400\n[LAUGH] So\nI'm on the ball with you on that one too.\n\n121\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.020\n&gt;&gt; We run out of acronyms and\nwe reuse acronyms and\n\n122\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.360\nit really depends on the context.\n\n123\n00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.880\nYou have to look at everything\naround it to understand\n\n124\n00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.070\nwhat that acronyms\nactually is standing for.\n\n125\n00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.257\nOther logs community to look at,\nIDSs and IPSs.\n\n126\n00:06:54.257 --> 00:06:58.190\nWe know what these are by now, and so we\nknow that they're gonna have great logging\n\n127\n00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.180\ncapabilities and we've gotta make sure\nthat we're going in and looking at those.\n\n128\n00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.210\nWhen we're looking at IDSs and\nIPSs, we don't wanna,\n\n129\n00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.160\nit's typically a learning process for\nboth the software before us.\n\n130\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.030\nWe might start off just saying\nhey log in everything and\n\n131\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.280\nthen we're slowly gonna work that\nback until where we're getting rid of\n\n132\n00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.240\ninformation that's not necessary to log.\n\n133\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.550\nBecause of regulation requires that we\ndon't have to or it doesn't require that\n\n134\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:30.010\nwe do or\nit's basic information that we don't need.\n\n135\n00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.750\nLike we were talking about successful\nlogons or something like that.\n\n136\n00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.990\nSo your DNS has started.\n\n137\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.120\nWell, I know DNS has started,\nor I hope it is.\n\n138\n00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.930\nSo, trying to filter it down.\n\n139\n00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.640\nWe also need to be familiar\nwith the term SDEE,\n\n140\n00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.950\nanother acronym I wanna\nthroughout out there at you.\n\n141\n00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.667\nThis was Security Device Event Exchange.\n\n142\n00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:53.189\nSecurity Device Event Exchange.\n\n143\n00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:56.842\nAnd this is a Standard that these IDSs and\n\n144\n00:07:56.842 --> 00:08:01.790\nIPSs can use that we can interchange or\nexchange data.\n\n145\n00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:07.100\nIt's kinda a way to talk about these\nevents within these systems, and\n\n146\n00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.990\nbe able to bring that in.\n\n147\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.585\nBecause if I'm using a third party SIEM,\nright?\n\n148\n00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:14.100\nWhat's a good way to say this?\n\n149\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.730\nThere's so many different IDSs and\nIPSs out there,\n\n150\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.130\nwhen these systems are collecting all this\ninformation, does it have to understand\n\n151\n00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:28.350\nhow every single one of those devices\nregurgitates or puts its information out.\n\n152\n00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:33.650\nBy following a standard like this,\nif my IDS or my IPS uses SDEE,\n\n153\n00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.370\nthen I can be assured that my other\nsoftware will work with that.\n\n154\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.340\n&gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking, Mike,\n\n155\n00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.190\nthat might be coming in handy as\nwe see more things like today,\n\n156\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.830\nlike unified threat management, where\neverything's going to a single standpoint,\n\n157\n00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.290\nor a single centralized focus, and\neverybody's speaking different languages.\n\n158\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.250\nWell, then, what's the point\nof central administration and\n\n159\n00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.250\nunified thread management?\n\n160\n00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.170\nSo everybody has to speak that common\nlanguage so that we can understand it and\n\n161\n00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.850\ninterpret it and like you said,\nnormalization of the data, right?\n\n162\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.520\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly right.\n\n163\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.680\nLet's take a look at my screen again.\n\n164\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.160\nHere's another log we need to or\n\n165\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.010\nwe should understand can have\nsome pertinent information.\n\n166\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.660\nProxy logs, right.\n\n167\n00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.600\nRemember a proxy is something that does\nsomething on behalf of someone else.\n\n168\n00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.990\nDid I say that right?\n\n169\n00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.670\nSomething that does something\non behalf of someone else.\n\n170\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.180\nPretty generic term, right?\n\n171\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.730\nOr generic definition I should say.\n\n172\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.360\nBut on behalf of,\nwhen we talk about proxies.\n\n173\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.240\nAnd so for example, a web proxy,\nwhere your users inside your\n\n174\n00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.940\ncorporate network request\na web page from the web.\n\n175\n00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.810\nThe request goes through the proxy.\n\n176\n00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:36.650\nAnd the proxy goes out and\ngets that web page on behalf of the user.\n\n177\n00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.220\nIt helps us hide security\nthrough obscurity,\n\n178\n00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.140\nkinda keeping our internal IP address\nranges and information secret.\n\n179\n00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.760\nWell here it is, this is,\nit's gonna log that information,\n\n180\n00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.120\nthat proxy logs everything\nthat's going on through it.\n\n181\n00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.960\nSo this is another place that I can go and\nlook for information.\n\n182\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.390\nCarrier provided logs,\nespecially now with mobile devices.\n\n183\n00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.341\nThis becomes even more\nimportant to understand,\n\n184\n00:10:01.341 --> 00:10:06.270\nknowing that they're available,\nthat we can typically talk to a carrier.\n\n185\n00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.390\nAnd we can get them to\ngive us information,\n\n186\n00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.695\nassuming we have the appropriate\npaperwork, right.\n\n187\n00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:16.855\nAnd in the appropriate authority, the\nmobile devices are a big vector nowadays,\n\n188\n00:10:16.855 --> 00:10:18.325\nattack vector.\n\n189\n00:10:18.325 --> 00:10:20.125\nSo it's gotta be part of our security.\n\n190\n00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:23.315\nWe've got, we can call up\nthose wireless providers and\n\n191\n00:10:23.315 --> 00:10:26.305\nsay hey look we need to get the log files,\nor the Internet\n\n192\n00:10:26.305 --> 00:10:30.495\nactivity that occurred on this particular\ndevice, at such and such time.\n\n193\n00:10:30.495 --> 00:10:33.725\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I noticed that throughout these\ncouple of episodes that we've been in,\n\n194\n00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:36.400\nyou've mentioned this kind of in passing.\n\n195\n00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.060\nWhat if I just break out the normal\nWireshark, right, the old network sniffer\n\n196\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.440\nout there, to try to gather that\ninformation that's traversing the network?\n\n197\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.870\nCan't we use something like that, as well?\n\n198\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n199\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.030\nThe only problem when we\nlook at the sniffers,\n\n200\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.610\nyou're talking about what's\ngoing on right now, right.\n\n201\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.670\nAnd I can capture that, but the problem\nis, the attack occurred a few hours ago,\n\n202\n00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.356\nand I know what device, and\nI know what happened, but\n\n203\n00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:58.992\nI need to get that information.\n\n204\n00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:03.229\nAnd it very well could be the attack\noriginated from one of my employee's\n\n205\n00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:07.952\nmobile devices, I need to see how that\ndevice got infected, what it contacted,\n\n206\n00:11:07.952 --> 00:11:10.390\nwhere it was when this happened.\n\n207\n00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:14.375\nAnd I don't have that information,\nbut the provider does.\n\n208\n00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:17.935\nSo I can maybe go to them, petition\nthem to get those log files released.\n\n209\n00:11:17.935 --> 00:11:22.595\nAnd they'll have information about more\nthan you probably want them to have, call\n\n210\n00:11:22.595 --> 00:11:29.182\ndetails, voicemail details, text messages,\nGPS, IP information, geolocation.\n\n211\n00:11:29.182 --> 00:11:32.272\nThey've got all that information, right.\n\n212\n00:11:32.272 --> 00:11:35.042\n&gt;&gt; Now, this wouldn't be something\nlike you were saying earlier with\n\n213\n00:11:35.042 --> 00:11:36.982\nthings like anomaly behavior detection.\n\n214\n00:11:36.982 --> 00:11:39.380\nWe couldn't use like a sniffer like that,\nright.\n\n215\n00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.510\nBecause you said that's just real time,\nso I need more pattern analysis,\n\n216\n00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.410\nso that's not the right\nway to use the sniffer.\n\n217\n00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.990\nIf you need something like that, you need\nsomething that can do trending analysis,\n\n218\n00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.700\nright.\n\n219\n00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.930\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and if you're sniffing that\ntraffic over periods of time, then you can\n\n220\n00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.130\nstart developing that baseline and you\nmight be able to spot those anomalies but\n\n221\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.160\ntrying to keep packet capture records for\nextended periods of time.\n\n222\n00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.610\nI mean you can imagine how big\nthose log files would end up.\n\n223\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:10.720\nSo it's not even, I don't know if it'd\nbe feasible to try to keep all of that.\n\n224\n00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.050\nAgain it's that constant battle about\ndeciding what it is I need to retain,\n\n225\n00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.920\nwhat is pertinent and what I don't need\nto retain and what I can get rid of.\n\n226\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.710\nHindsight is 20/20 right, when you're\nanalyzing the effect of the attack?\n\n227\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.470\nThat's when you realize,\nI wish we would have kept that.\n\n228\n00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.650\nSo, I gotta watch that.\n\n229\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.470\nSoftware defined networking is another\none, just a term, really, more than\n\n230\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.090\nanything they throw in here but when\nwe talk about software defined network,\n\n231\n00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:43.110\nthis is a newer concept that has stemmed\nfrom our virtualization capabilities.\n\n232\n00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.940\nBut it basically separates out\nthe network control systems and\n\n233\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.230\nthe forwarding systems.\n\n234\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.240\nAnd it makes it to where I can modify\nnetworks without actually touching\n\n235\n00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:58.110\nthe devices, the actual hardware that's\ndoing the forwarding of the packets.\n\n236\n00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.750\nBut it has it's own\ncollection systems right?\n\n237\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:06.340\nSo there's another source of log files\nthat I need to monitor and maintain.\n\n238\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.070\nWe talk about host based.\n\n239\n00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.600\nSo let's move off in\nthe host based system logs.\n\n240\n00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.840\nI think I mentioned this earlier.\n\n241\n00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.790\nJust about every system is going to log.\n\n242\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.980\nI don't know any that don't.\n\n243\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.720\nSo understanding where\nthose log file reside.\n\n244\n00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.950\nWhat information I can gather from them,\nhow to get them is gonna be important.\n\n245\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.375\nBut that's gonna be different between\na NICS based system versus a Windows based\n\n246\n00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:35.250\nsystem versus an OS X based system, right?\n\n247\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.890\nThey're not gonna be in the same place,\n\n248\n00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.410\nthey're not gonna be\ncalled the same thing.\n\n249\n00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.300\nSo I need to familiarize\nourself with those.\n\n250\n00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.060\nWhen it comes to our Windows systems well\nwe probably, well I shouldn't say that.\n\n251\n00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:50.580\nWe'll, I was gonna say we all know where\nthey are, but many of you might not.\n\n252\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.540\nThere are three main logs we\nfind in the Windows systems,\n\n253\n00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.740\nthe application, the system,\nand the security logs.\n\n254\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.910\nBut there are dozens and\nI would almost say hundreds\n\n255\n00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.370\nof logs available in a Windows operating\nsystem if you know where to look.\n\n256\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:10.420\nWe've got our event viewer where we can\ngo in and read through these log files.\n\n257\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.528\nAnd let's take a quick peek,\nagain we'll actually do,\n\n258\n00:14:13.528 --> 00:14:16.957\nin a module coming up I'll show you\nsome of the tools to be able to\n\n259\n00:14:16.957 --> 00:14:21.330\nfilter these log files down, find\npertinent information, things like that.\n\n260\n00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.630\nBut for now lets just kinda look at\nsome of the logs that are available.\n\n261\n00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:29.070\nOn my Windows system here I'm simply\ngonna go in and open up my Event Viewer.\n\n262\n00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.802\nBuilt-in application in Windows.\n\n263\n00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:36.540\nSo we go in here and\nview my Windows logs, right?\n\n264\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.510\nSo we can see right up there.\n\n265\n00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.375\nI've got my Windows logs application\nsecurity setup system and\n\n266\n00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:42.630\nforwarded events.\n\n267\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.600\nAgain the main three application,\nsecurity and system.\n\n268\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.290\nI'll zoom back out.\n\n269\n00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.528\nIf I click on one of these, hey here's\nan example of a Windows log I've got some\n\n270\n00:14:53.528 --> 00:14:57.191\nkinda summary information going\nacross here, down at the bottom,\n\n271\n00:14:57.191 --> 00:15:01.561\nas I select each one of those, I can get\nsome more detailed information about that\n\n272\n00:15:01.561 --> 00:15:04.552\nparticular event,\nthere's different categories.\n\n273\n00:15:04.552 --> 00:15:09.474\nYou've got your informational versus your\nerrors versus if I can find some Let's\n\n274\n00:15:09.474 --> 00:15:12.130\ngo over to System,\nI might have some there.\n\n275\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.000\nThere's another error.\n\n276\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.980\nTrying to find some warnings.\n\n277\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.180\nIt's either all or nothing here\nit's either a, those are audits,\n\n278\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.320\nexcesses, you get a yellow exclamation or\nyellow triangles for your warnings.\n\n279\n00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.930\nAnd these are just the main logs.\n\n280\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.289\nIf i go into forwarded logs or forwarded\nevents, this is for subscriptions.\n\n281\n00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.330\nApplication log,\n\n282\n00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.880\nthis is where applications\nare configured to record events.\n\n283\n00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.300\nYour security log,\nthis is where all of your auditing goes.\n\n284\n00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.373\nSo failed and successful log on attempts,\nauditing file access,\n\n285\n00:15:43.373 --> 00:15:44.982\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n286\n00:15:44.982 --> 00:15:48.920\nIt's just a log that's where your\noperating system can record events.\n\n287\n00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.130\nForwarded events,\nthis is where I can subscribe.\n\n288\n00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:57.537\nThis is a way to centralize\nlog management in Windows.\n\n289\n00:15:57.537 --> 00:16:01.501\nSo if my responsibility to monitor the log\nfiles from 15 different web servers,\n\n290\n00:16:01.501 --> 00:16:03.692\nI don't want to have to\nremote into each one.\n\n291\n00:16:03.692 --> 00:16:06.071\nOne of those servers and\nopen up event viewer,\n\n292\n00:16:06.071 --> 00:16:09.366\nI can subscribe to those log files\nfrom those 15 web servers and\n\n293\n00:16:09.366 --> 00:16:12.500\nhave them all sent to my\nsystem to my forwarded events.\n\n294\n00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.868\nSo when I come in in the morning,\nI can open this log up and\n\n295\n00:16:15.868 --> 00:16:20.196\nI can see the log files from 15\ndifferent web servers in one location.\n\n296\n00:16:20.196 --> 00:16:22.853\nNot only that, my subscription\ncan control what information,\n\n297\n00:16:22.853 --> 00:16:24.734\nlike I don't wanna see\nthe information log.\n\n298\n00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:28.658\nI just wanna see warnings and\nerrors and criticals, for example, so\n\n299\n00:16:28.658 --> 00:16:31.036\nwe can create some subscriptions there.\n\n300\n00:16:31.036 --> 00:16:36.045\nBelow that just a quick peek I'm gonna\nexpand applications service logs.\n\n301\n00:16:36.045 --> 00:16:39.997\nExpand out Microsoft Windows and\n\n302\n00:16:39.997 --> 00:16:46.921\nwe'll see that that list goes on and\non and on and on and on.\n\n303\n00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:51.207\nAnd that's still not all of them,\nI could turn on some of my operational and\n\n304\n00:16:51.207 --> 00:16:54.827\nmore verbose logs, and\nI would see 100 more pop up in there.\n\n305\n00:16:54.827 --> 00:16:59.857\nSo there's a lot of logs, The trick is\ntrying to find the appropriate log and\n\n306\n00:16:59.857 --> 00:17:01.910\nget the information out of it.\n\n307\n00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.590\nAll right,\nif we get over to a Linux system.\n\n308\n00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.510\nLet's jump over to Kali here and\nlet me open up a terminal.\n\n309\n00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.860\nIt's got its logging system, so\nwe can look at, first, let's do this.\n\n310\n00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:18.988\nLet's do a, let's cat\n\n311\n00:17:18.988 --> 00:17:24.990\n/etc/rsyslog.conf, okay.\n\n312\n00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.393\nAnd this is the configuration file,\nhopefully, that's big enough for\n\n313\n00:17:28.393 --> 00:17:29.301\neverybody to see.\n\n314\n00:17:29.301 --> 00:17:36.110\nsyslog.conf, and again we're not here to\nlearn how to modify this particular file.\n\n315\n00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.280\nBut I just want to show you,\n\n316\n00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.810\nLinux out of the box is configured\nto log events just like Windows is.\n\n317\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.616\nHere's some rules down here,\n\n318\n00:17:45.616 --> 00:17:50.209\nanything that's from the daemon log\nis going to go into /var/log/daemon.\n\n319\n00:17:50.209 --> 00:17:54.320\nAnd kernel information,\nkernel messages /var/log/kernel.\n\n320\n00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.360\nI've got mail messages\ngoing into mail.log.\n\n321\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.320\nSo this is gonna help me either turn on or\n\n322\n00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.650\noff some of that logging if I don't need\nit to keep my log files nice and tidy.\n\n323\n00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.650\nAlso where it's going, maybe I want\nto change that default location or\n\n324\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.220\njust find out where\nthe heck they are going.\n\n325\n00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.270\nWhat else?\n\n326\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.290\nSo that's an example of the sysconf.\n\n327\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.520\nIf I want to see that log file, dash or\n\n328\n00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.330\ntail is gonna show me the last\nfew lines of the log file.\n\n329\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.700\nAnd I just did a disk update on\nthis thing not too long ago, so\n\n330\n00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.010\nthere's probably all kinds\nof messages in here.\n\n331\n00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.950\nBut this is, again, just tail and\nthen the name of that log.\n\n332\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.180\nIn this case,\nI wanted to look at syslog, and\n\n333\n00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.200\nI can see Clam AV update\nprocess was started.\n\n334\n00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.250\nWhat else can I see?\n\n335\n00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.975\nIt looks like some kind of\nself-check database was okay.\n\n336\n00:18:47.975 --> 00:18:53.610\nD-Bus daemon activating the VA systemv,\nstarting Gnome terminal.\n\n337\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.062\nAgain, not here to learn\nthis particular log,\n\n338\n00:18:57.062 --> 00:19:00.264\njust showing you\nthe example of a Linux log.\n\n339\n00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.908\nOops what did I do?\n\n340\n00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:03.793\nLet me get out of that.\n\n341\n00:19:05.927 --> 00:19:10.280\nWhat else, let's do an ls /var/log, okay.\n\n342\n00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.970\nAnd in here, hopefully,\nyou guys are gonna be able to see that,\n\n343\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.470\nyou can see all kinds of\ndifferent logs that are occurring.\n\n344\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.220\nAnd this is just the default location.\n\n345\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.750\nThis is not to say applications\nthat I've got installed on here or\n\n346\n00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.170\nservices that I've got installed on here\nmight be logging additional information\n\n347\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:25.900\nsomewhere else.\n\n348\n00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.578\nI've gotta make sure I know where those\napplications are configured to send their\n\n349\n00:19:30.578 --> 00:19:31.809\nlogs and find those.\n\n350\n00:19:31.809 --> 00:19:39.320\nWe can see all kinds of logs in there,\napplication logs, as I was just saying.\n\n351\n00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.780\nYour browsers, typically have\nlog files associated with them.\n\n352\n00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.000\nSo I can go and check those log files.\n\n353\n00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.004\nWe've talked about Intrusion\nPrevention Systems Network-Based.\n\n354\n00:19:49.004 --> 00:19:51.250\nWhat about\nHost-Based Intrusion Prevention Systems?\n\n355\n00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:55.377\nThose are going to have log files, that\nwe need to be able to check out, right.\n\n356\n00:19:55.377 --> 00:20:00.110\nAnti-virus logs, right, looking at your\nSymantec or McAfee, or whatever it is\n\n357\n00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.420\nyou're using for anti-virus,\ntalking about last successful runs.\n\n358\n00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.440\nI can't tell you how many times I have\ngone to a machine and you pull up that\n\n359\n00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.652\nWindows Defender log and you see\nthat the last few scans have failed.\n\n360\n00:20:09.652 --> 00:20:12.090\nIt hasn't done a successful\nscan in weeks or\n\n361\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.490\nhasn't updated its definitions in weeks.\n\n362\n00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.100\nAnd that's a problem,\nwe thought it was doing its job.\n\n363\n00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.120\nWe're trusting the fact that\nit's keeping my system safe and\n\n364\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.950\nyet it's definitions are over a week old.\n\n365\n00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.220\nWhich means my user could be susceptible\nto things that should not have been.\n\n366\n00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.390\nSo looking at those log\nfiles are very important.\n\n367\n00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.610\nService logs, we talked about the\ndifferent services on our network, DNS,\n\n368\n00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:42.650\nDHCP, active directory, web services,\nall of those keep log files.\n\n369\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.710\nDNS is going to give me information\nabout queries that are occurring.\n\n370\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:52.040\nAnd keep in mind too that you can see\nthese from different perspectives, right.\n\n371\n00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.390\nWhen I go to that DNS server,\nI'll see the log files for DNS and\n\n372\n00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.800\nI'll be able to spot unusual activity.\n\n373\n00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.130\nAn unusual number of queries coming in or\n\n374\n00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.550\nsuspicious lookups coming\ninto that DNS server.\n\n375\n00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:13.190\nSuspicious domain names showing up in\nthe name resolution in those log files.\n\n376\n00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:17.970\nTypes of DNS queries that are going on,\nI see a lot of unusual requests for\n\n377\n00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.820\nzone transfers right.\n\n378\n00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.770\nThat's a good indication that somebody on\nmy network is trying to get my DNS server\n\n379\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.760\nto give up the ghost and\nprovide the entire zone, right.\n\n380\n00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.570\nSo being able to look at those logs,\nspot those kind of things.\n\n381\n00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.080\nSMTP, and I've got a couple examples,\nlet's peruse.\n\n382\n00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.389\nLet me find them first\nbefore we bring those up.\n\n383\n00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.786\nLets take a look at a SMTP log entry.\n\n384\n00:21:44.786 --> 00:21:47.422\nAll right, so here's an example,\nlet me zoom into this guy.\n\n385\n00:21:47.422 --> 00:21:51.710\nAnd here is from a SMTP Server,\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol.\n\n386\n00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.843\nAll right, and you can see date and\ntime information,\n\n387\n00:21:54.843 --> 00:21:57.854\nwho the local exchange server was,\nor SMTP server.\n\n388\n00:21:57.854 --> 00:22:02.169\nI shouldn't say Exchange,\nthe port number, who it was to,\n\n389\n00:22:02.169 --> 00:22:05.540\nthe size, any type of reply code,\nall right.\n\n390\n00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.792\nWe've got HTTP logs.\n\n391\n00:22:10.237 --> 00:22:11.920\nA little over zoom there.\n\n392\n00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.760\nAgain, very similar information, right.\n\n393\n00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.960\nLooking at the IP address, who the user\nID was in this case because maybe\n\n394\n00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.350\nyou had to authenticate for this one date\nand time, and then what the request was.\n\n395\n00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.323\nThey're requesting an image and\n\n396\n00:22:25.323 --> 00:22:28.567\nthen the response code that\nthe HTTP server sent back.\n\n397\n00:22:28.567 --> 00:22:32.840\nPage not found or success,\na 200 message or what have you.\n\n398\n00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:41.120\nAnother one is going to be our IIS logs,\nright, or our http logs.\n\n399\n00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.080\nHere I can see who is connecting to my\nweb server, what pages they're viewing.\n\n400\n00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:52.580\nWe've got our, What are we looking\nat here, this is an SSH log.\n\n401\n00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.940\nSo I can see connections, right.\n\n402\n00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.480\nPeople attempting to make\nsecure connections using SSH,\n\n403\n00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.120\nI can see source, IP address, and port.\n\n404\n00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.634\nThe version of SSH that they were using.\n\n405\n00:23:02.634 --> 00:23:05.803\nAgain, I'm not worried, you notice I'm not\nspending a lot of time on each of these\n\n406\n00:23:05.803 --> 00:23:08.340\nlogs and\nbreaking down every bit of information.\n\n407\n00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.630\nIt's more about learning\nthat these logs exist and\n\n408\n00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.970\nthen I need to get familiar with them, and\n\n409\n00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.350\nstart making sure they're part of my data\nanalysis, pulling this information in.\n\n410\n00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.740\nSQL logs, it would be another one,\nlet me zoom into there.\n\n411\n00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.660\nYou could see things like who's\nconnecting to a particular database,\n\n412\n00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.850\nwhat query they were running.\n\n413\n00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:34.820\nIn this particular one, I can see a login\nfailed down there towards the bottom.\n\n414\n00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.530\nSo those are the kinds of\nthings I can find out.\n\n415\n00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.980\nWho's making connections to that database\nshouldn't be coming from that IP\n\n416\n00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:40.560\naddress rage?\n\n417\n00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.146\nOr who's running that particular query,\nwhy?\n\n418\n00:23:43.146 --> 00:23:44.990\nWell, I shouldn't say why.\n\n419\n00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.110\nTypically, the log file\nwon't tell you the why,\n\n420\n00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.010\nthat's the part that\nthe human has to figure out.\n\n421\n00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:56.005\nSo this is another example of log,\nseeing what tables are being accessed and\n\n422\n00:23:56.005 --> 00:24:02.294\nwhat databases, what queries are being\nsent against those database servers.\n\n423\n00:24:02.294 --> 00:24:07.203\nYou start to look at your log and\nyou see from a web interface or\n\n424\n00:24:07.203 --> 00:24:13.820\nfrom an external IP address, a change\nrequest right or a drop table request.\n\n425\n00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.470\nThat's not a good day there shouldn't be\nanybody outside requesting you to drop\n\n426\n00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.091\ntables on your backend SQL Server.\n\n427\n00:24:19.091 --> 00:24:22.019\nSo you gotta pay attention\nto these log files.\n\n428\n00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.250\nVulnerability testing data,\nthe information we get from\n\n429\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:31.440\nrunning those vulnerability scans,\nthat needs to part of our information.\n\n430\n00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:37.416\nWe get our baselines on our system,\nfinding out what we're vulnerable to.\n\n431\n00:24:37.416 --> 00:24:41.186\nWe go through and we do our updates,\nor our mitigations of those, and\n\n432\n00:24:41.186 --> 00:24:45.671\nthen running those reports again and\nseeing that we've corrected some of those,\n\n433\n00:24:45.671 --> 00:24:48.413\nand some of the red flags\nhave now turned to green.\n\n434\n00:24:48.413 --> 00:24:54.692\nSo in the end, just a lot of information,\na lot of different sources that we have,\n\n435\n00:24:54.692 --> 00:24:59.240\nand we need to understand\nall these different sources.\n\n436\n00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.818\nAs we're looking at where do\nI get this information from.\n\n437\n00:25:00.818 --> 00:25:05.287\nBecause as a cyberCide first responder I\ngotta know where to look if an incident\n\n438\n00:25:05.287 --> 00:25:09.620\nhas occurred or if a breach has occurred\nI've gotta know that the log files on\n\n439\n00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.660\nthat infected are not the only\nthing I'm gonna be looking at.\n\n440\n00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.280\nI wanna look at log files\nfrom the network itself.\n\n441\n00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.587\nFrom the intrusion detection and\nfrom the intrusion prevention systems,\n\n442\n00:25:19.587 --> 00:25:23.049\nfrom the router, from where the attack\ncame from, from the other devices that\n\n443\n00:25:23.049 --> 00:25:25.899\nwere maybe accessed from that\nmachine once it's compromised.\n\n444\n00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:29.378\nJust a lot of places to look,\na lot of different sources.\n\n445\n00:25:29.378 --> 00:25:33.714\nAnd then the importance of having\na strategy to looking through that\n\n446\n00:25:33.714 --> 00:25:38.656\ninformation, third party tools to help\nus with that information, your SIEM\n\n447\n00:25:38.656 --> 00:25:43.650\nsystems to pull that big data together and\nhopefully make sense out of it.\n\n448\n00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.960\n&gt;&gt; Mike, thank you for taking the time to\nshow us the sources of the information,\n\n449\n00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.910\nsome of the tools, and some of the things\nthat we can do with that information.\n\n450\n00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.800\nBut judging from that clock what we can't\ndo is spend any more time on this episode.\n\n451\n00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.084\nSo we are going to sign off, but before we\ndo Mike do you have any additional words\n\n452\n00:25:57.084 --> 00:26:00.432\nthat you might want to throw in here when\nit comes to things like the data sources?\n\n453\n00:26:00.432 --> 00:26:03.781\n&gt;&gt; Like I said they don't expect\nyou to be familiar with and\n\n454\n00:26:03.781 --> 00:26:08.235\nbe able to interpret every single\nlog from every single device.\n\n455\n00:26:08.235 --> 00:26:09.380\nIt's more about understanding,\n\n456\n00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.370\nwhat information can I get\nform a router log, right?\n\n457\n00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:17.037\nCan I find out what their HTTP method was,\nfrom that log on the router?\n\n458\n00:26:17.037 --> 00:26:19.140\nProbably not, right?\n\n459\n00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.988\nThat's where I'm gonna go to the web\napplication firewall log for.\n\n460\n00:26:21.988 --> 00:26:26.688\nCan I see in that web application\nfirewall log information about the SSH\n\n461\n00:26:26.688 --> 00:26:28.339\nsession that was setup?\n\n462\n00:26:28.339 --> 00:26:31.270\nNo, that would be in that SSH log.\n\n463\n00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:36.760\nSo understanding, one, what logs\nare available and two, what information I\n\n464\n00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:41.390\ncan get out of those various logs, that's\nreally what I want you guys to focus on.\n\n465\n00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike.\n\n466\n00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.159\nThank you, as alway,\na wealth of information.\n\n467\n00:26:43.159 --> 00:26:45.800\nWe appreciate having you\nhere in the studios.\n\n468\n00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.269\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n469\n00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:50.257\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n470\n00:26:50.257 --> 00:26:51.662\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n471\n00:26:51.662

00:00:08.305\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:11.628\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:15.289\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another great\nepisode here in the ITProTV studios.\n\n6\n00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.493\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:20.818\nAnd in today's episode, we're continuing\nthrough our series in logical operations,\n\n8\n00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:22.210\nCyberSec First Responder.\n\n9\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.359\nAnd joining us back in the studios for\nthis very endeavor is none other than Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.990\nMike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.166\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:27.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.938\nThanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:28.938 --> 00:00:30.031\nExcited to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:33.615\nAnd today, we're gonna be taking\nsome of the different tools that\n\n16\n00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:37.720\nwe've got available to work with our\nlog files, or really any type of file.\n\n17\n00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.600\nDoesn't have to be a log file.\n\n18\n00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.292\nThe objective in here is use\nappropriate tools to analyze logs.\n\n19\n00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:45.839\nBut anytime we're looking\nat any type of file,\n\n20\n00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.229\nwhether their log files or other files,\nif they've got a lot of data in there it's\n\n21\n00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.429\nnice to be able to find something\nwithin that file, right?\n\n22\n00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.140\nOr look for a particular pattern,\nif you will.\n\n23\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.869\nSo that's some of\nthe tools we wanna look at.\n\n24\n00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:02.715\nAnd then in an episode coming up,\nwe'll take a look at working with regular\n\n25\n00:01:02.715 --> 00:01:05.900\nexpressions, which is all\nabout trying to find patterns.\n\n26\n00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.690\nReally that's what it is.\n\n27\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.130\nSo let's start with some\nof the Linux tools.\n\n28\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.867\nAnd the ones they call out on\nthe objectives here are gonna be grep,\n\n29\n00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:19.330\ncut, and diff, all right?\n\n30\n00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.307\nAnd grep is my regular expression tool.\n\n31\n00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:27.641\nIt allows me to work with regular\nexpressions but we can use it in a much\n\n32\n00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:32.530\nsimpler way where we're just looking for\nstring patterns, all right?\n\n33\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.110\nA word, a number, or something like that.\n\n34\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.510\nWe can just basically type it in.\n\n35\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.430\nAnd we'll take a look at\nhow to do this in a second.\n\n36\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.070\nIn fact, well,\nlet's just go ahead and start.\n\n37\n00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.030\nWe'll take them one at a time.\n\n38\n00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.350\nSo we'll start with grep.\n\n39\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.671\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n40\n00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.117\nI've got my Cali Linux box opened up.\n\n41\n00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:52.590\nI'm gonna fire up my terminal and\nI've got a file on my desktop.\n\n42\n00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.370\nSo let me just switch over to my desktop\njust to keep everything nice and\n\n43\n00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.540\neasy here.\n\n44\n00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.730\nI can see I've got a file called nmap.txt.\n\n45\n00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.520\nAnd if we cat that guy,\nthere is the file, right?\n\n46\n00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.860\nAnd it's a very short file,\nI mean I did that intentionally.\n\n47\n00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.508\nGive us just a little bit of data to\nwork with to make it easier to see.\n\n48\n00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:16.987\nBut let's say I just wanted the lines.\n\n49\n00:02:16.987 --> 00:02:21.682\nThis first couple of lines, or this\nfirst line really, is telling me that I\n\n50\n00:02:21.682 --> 00:02:26.539\nran the Nmap scan, when it started,\nthe command I used to get these results.\n\n51\n00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:30.760\nAnd then the last one is my summary,\nright, how long it took.\n\n52\n00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.870\nHow many IP addresses were scanned.\n\n53\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.150\nAnd the date and time that it was run.\n\n54\n00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.230\nSo let's say that I want to get just\na file that has those IP addresses, right?\n\n55\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.977\nAnd this is something that I do\nwhen I'm doing this type of test.\n\n56\n00:02:46.977 --> 00:02:49.700\nAnd I've go to a network and\nI'm first getting to that network,\n\n57\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.585\nthe first thing I need to do is\nfigure out which hosts are up, right?\n\n58\n00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:53.893\nI need my live hosts,\n\n59\n00:02:53.893 --> 00:02:58.630\nbecause I'm not gonna waste time\nscanning IP addresses that aren't there.\n\n60\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.217\nYou wouldn't start with\nan Nmap-A do an entire subnet,\n\n61\n00:03:02.217 --> 00:03:06.714\nbecause very good chance that many of\nthose IP addresses are not in use.\n\n62\n00:03:06.714 --> 00:03:09.788\nAnd so it's just gonna make\nit take a little bit longer.\n\n63\n00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:14.041\nSo one of the things I like to do, and\nthere's many different ways you can\n\n64\n00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:18.597\ndo this of course, is to take my Nmap\nscan and grab it, and find my live hosts.\n\n65\n00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:21.574\nAnd then we'll use cut,\nthe other command, we need to talk about,\n\n66\n00:03:21.574 --> 00:03:23.622\nto trim it down to just\nthe information I need.\n\n67\n00:03:23.622 --> 00:03:28.066\nAnd then I can actually use\nthat as my source file, right,\n\n68\n00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:30.889\nmy -il In my Nmap scans from then on.\n\n69\n00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.663\nAnd I can target just the live hosts\nwithout having to specify individual IP\n\n70\n00:03:35.663 --> 00:03:37.880\naddresses or anything like that.\n\n71\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.470\nAnd this is just one use again for\na tool like this.\n\n72\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.434\nSo let's try it.\n\n73\n00:03:42.434 --> 00:03:47.103\nGrep is G-R-E-P, right?\n\n74\n00:03:47.103 --> 00:03:51.602\nAnd we're not in Windows here,\nlet's do a man grep.\n\n75\n00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:54.982\nThere are a lot of instructions\non how to use the tool,\n\n76\n00:03:54.982 --> 00:03:59.020\na lot of the different switches\nthat you can use with it.\n\n77\n00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.410\nSo just pull out your man pages.\n\n78\n00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.018\nThere's plenty of stuff online as well,\nas far as working with grep.\n\n79\n00:04:05.018 --> 00:04:07.926\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, you just kinda intimidated\nme there when I looked at some of\n\n80\n00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:09.100\nthe output of the man pages.\n\n81\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.889\nNow I've done simple things like grep and\nIP address.\n\n82\n00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.165\nMore specifically when I'm looking for\nmy network adaptor's IP address,\n\n83\n00:04:16.165 --> 00:04:19.253\nI know that IF config will\noutput a lot of information.\n\n84\n00:04:19.253 --> 00:04:22.299\nAnd I just do it basically grep\nwith a certain IP address, but\n\n85\n00:04:22.299 --> 00:04:25.785\nit looks like you can get very,\nvery advanced in using this utility.\n\n86\n00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:27.845\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you really can.\n\n87\n00:04:27.845 --> 00:04:30.315\nThere's entire classes\non regular expressions.\n\n88\n00:04:31.545 --> 00:04:36.020\nOn this exam, though, I will recommend\nthat you have a basic understanding for\n\n89\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.160\nreading regular expressions.\n\n90\n00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.950\nAgain, we're gonna get into those in that\nnext episode, and we'll take a look at it.\n\n91\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.933\nBut the best thing you can do is\npractice with your regular expressions.\n\n92\n00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:47.142\nBecause if you don't use it, you lose it.\n\n93\n00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:51.380\nThere's a lot of complexities to it,\nbut it's also very, very powerful.\n\n94\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.820\nAll right, so let's get back to this one.\n\n95\n00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.860\nSo when I'm looking at this file,\nI notice that what I'm looking for\n\n96\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.620\nis something that identifies\nthe lines that I want.\n\n97\n00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.630\nAnd what I see,\nthese are the three lines I really want.\n\n98\n00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.769\nAnd I could actually use status or\nI could use the word up.\n\n99\n00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:12.741\nI could use the word host in this case,\ncuz it's only on those.\n\n100\n00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:16.895\nBut depending on your output and how it\nlooks, you might have some that are listed\n\n101\n00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:19.600\nand then it says status down,\nsomething like that.\n\n102\n00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.798\nSo just look at your different line and\n\n103\n00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:25.996\nsee what is that is unique about those\nlines that you're trying to grab.\n\n104\n00:05:25.996 --> 00:05:30.103\nSo I'm just gonna do grep,\nand then up, right?\n\n105\n00:05:30.103 --> 00:05:33.685\nAnd I actually don't have to put that in\nquotes, but it is a good habit to get it,\n\n106\n00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:34.875\nso I'm gonna leave that.\n\n107\n00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:38.646\nGrep, up, and\nthen the name of that file was nmap.text.\n\n108\n00:05:38.646 --> 00:05:40.439\nSo I'm telling the command grep.\n\n109\n00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:44.500\nAnd then what I'm looking for, up, and\nthen the file I have to look through.\n\n110\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.349\nAnd I hit Enter, and\nnotice the results are different now.\n\n111\n00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:51.679\nNow I only see those three lines\nthat have the word up on it.\n\n112\n00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:54.990\nIf we wanted to do something\na little different,\n\n113\n00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.690\nwe could do status colon and\nbasically get the same results, right?\n\n114\n00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.920\nBecause those same three lines have\nstatus colon as well as the word up.\n\n115\n00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.720\nDo pay attention to the case on this.\n\n116\n00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.490\nIf we change this to a little u,\nall right, notice I don't get any results.\n\n117\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.713\nThere are switches I can use with grep\nthat can tell it to be case insensitive\n\n118\n00:06:17.713 --> 00:06:20.875\nbut like again,\nwe're just gonna keep it simple here.\n\n119\n00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:23.655\nSo let's just stick with\nthat case sensitivity.\n\n120\n00:06:23.655 --> 00:06:27.341\nWe'll switch it back to up,\nand there we go, all right?\n\n121\n00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:29.350\nSo that's grep.\n\n122\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.544\nIf we wanted to do grep,\nlike Wes was saying here, 10 0 100 99,\n\n123\n00:06:34.544 --> 00:06:38.490\nall right, and\nthen the name of my file, nmap.txt.\n\n124\n00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.960\nAnd notice, it finds that line\nthat has that IP address on it.\n\n125\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.630\n&gt;&gt; Mike, would that work if you did\nsomething like grep for instance, and\n\n126\n00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.090\nthen you did like a 10 asterisk?\n\n127\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.670\nDoes it take things like wild cards?\n\n128\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.310\n&gt;&gt; Let's try it, Wes,\nand see what it does.\n\n129\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.187\nAll right, and\n\n130\n00:06:52.187 --> 00:06:56.248\nwhat you'll find is this is where we\nstart getting into the wild cards.\n\n131\n00:06:56.248 --> 00:06:58.582\nAnd it doesn't do what we expected there.\n\n132\n00:06:58.582 --> 00:06:59.684\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n133\n00:06:59.684 --> 00:07:03.730\n&gt;&gt; And if you're used to using those kind\nof wild cards, there are wild cards.\n\n134\n00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.350\nBut they're gonna be a little bit\ndifferent in our regular expression.\n\n135\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.140\nAll right, so let's clear that up and\nwe'll keep on trucking.\n\n136\n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.810\nSo that was grep, and let's run that one\nmore time so we can see that output again.\n\n137\n00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.960\nAll right, so now I'm close to what\nI want as far as my end result\n\n138\n00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.390\ngoes as to get a list of IP addresses for\na live host.\n\n139\n00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.280\nNow I've got it narrowed down to\nwhere the IP addresses are there.\n\n140\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.820\nThe other lines are gone,\nthat's using grep.\n\n141\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.360\nNow let's talk about the cut command,\nall right?\n\n142\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.990\nSo with cut, cut allows me to\ndo just that, cut a file up.\n\n143\n00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.179\nAnd there's a couple things that I need\nwhen I'm working with the cut command.\n\n144\n00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:44.817\nOne, is I need my delimiter, right?\n\n145\n00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:50.880\nAnd the delimiter is what is going\nto separate this file into columns,\n\n146\n00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.920\nall right?\n\n147\n00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.798\nIf we look at this output\nthat I have right up here,\n\n148\n00:07:54.798 --> 00:07:59.133\nwe can see that I've got the word host,\nand then I've got a space, right?\n\n149\n00:07:59.133 --> 00:08:01.510\nI've got a blank between,\nif I can highlight just that.\n\n150\n00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.251\nThere we go.\n\n151\n00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:05.088\nGot a space between there,\nthen I've got an IP address, and\n\n152\n00:08:05.088 --> 00:08:06.991\nthen I've got a space in between there.\n\n153\n00:08:06.991 --> 00:08:08.960\nAnd then I've got a couple\nopen close parentheses.\n\n154\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.290\nI've got some more space then status,\ncolon, another space and up.\n\n155\n00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:19.058\nSo what I'm seeing is that if I was\nto tell it that the spaces were my\n\n156\n00:08:19.058 --> 00:08:22.728\ncolumns form, or\nthat's what delimits my text.\n\n157\n00:08:22.728 --> 00:08:25.529\nYou can almost see how it would\nmake columns out of that.\n\n158\n00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:29.040\nThe first column would be\nhost colon then a space.\n\n159\n00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.050\nThen the next column would be\nthe IP address and then a space.\n\n160\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.260\nAnd then the next column would be\nthese parentheses and then a space.\n\n161\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.970\nNext column status and then space.\n\n162\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.020\nAnd then next column up.\n\n163\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.350\nSo if I tell it the deliminator is\na space, that's what we'll end up with.\n\n164\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.680\nAnd now we can call each one of\nthose columns a field right?\n\n165\n00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.970\nColumn, field in database\nterms mean the same thing.\n\n166\n00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.740\nAnd our fields are gonna be just numbered.\n\n167\n00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.400\nThe first field, the second field,\nthe third field.\n\n168\n00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.150\nSo this would be the first field, right?\n\n169\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.820\nAnd then I've a got delimiter,\nthen I've got my second field delimiter,\n\n170\n00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.380\nthird field delimiter,\nfourth field delimiter, fifth field.\n\n171\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.710\nSo I actually have five fields in here,\nall right.\n\n172\n00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.980\nSo what we can do then is we can tell,\nwith a cut command we can tell it,\n\n173\n00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.510\nhey, I want to delimit it on the space and\n\n174\n00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:25.850\nthen I want to get in my\ncase just field two, right?\n\n175\n00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.480\nBecause that's the field that's going\nto have those IP addresses in there.\n\n176\n00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.540\nAnd we can start combining\ncommands using our pipe symbol.\n\n177\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.243\nSo let's take that last command\nthat filters it down to\n\n178\n00:09:38.243 --> 00:09:42.758\njust the lines I want and\nlet's just pipe that into.\n\n179\n00:09:42.758 --> 00:09:47.585\nAll right, let's grip that, and then\nlet's pipe that into a cut command, and\n\n180\n00:09:47.585 --> 00:09:52.360\n-d, for my delimiter, and then,\nin quotes, I'm gonna put an empty space.\n\n181\n00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.349\nNow, your delimiter could be a character,\nright, a backslash,\n\n182\n00:09:56.349 --> 00:10:00.778\na period, anything that's gonna divide\nyour text up the way you want it.\n\n183\n00:10:00.778 --> 00:10:05.700\nSo, we'll do a dash d and then tell it\nthat's the space that I'm gonna use.\n\n184\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.360\nAnd then dash f for the field.\n\n185\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.320\nAnd I want field to, and we'll hit Enter.\n\n186\n00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.550\nAnd look at that.\n\n187\n00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.070\nNow I'm down to just the IP addresses.\n\n188\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.455\n&gt;&gt; Mike, help me out and help our viewers\nout, the pipe character in there,\n\n189\n00:10:20.455 --> 00:10:21.749\nwhat was that doing?\n\n190\n00:10:21.749 --> 00:10:23.337\nYou put it right in the middle\nof those two commands,\n\n191\n00:10:23.337 --> 00:10:24.830\nwhat does the pipe character\ndoing there for us?\n\n192\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.396\n&gt;&gt; Great question Wes, and what it's\ndoing is it's using the output from\n\n193\n00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:31.206\nthe previous command as the input for\nthe next command.\n\n194\n00:10:31.206 --> 00:10:34.090\nBecause notice I didn't tell it\nwhat file to cut, all right?\n\n195\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.060\nI didn't say hey, nmap.text or\nanything like that.\n\n196\n00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.219\nIt just takes the results\nof the first command and\n\n197\n00:10:40.219 --> 00:10:43.388\npipes them into the second\ncommand as its input.\n\n198\n00:10:43.388 --> 00:10:45.880\nAnd we could even add to this.\n\n199\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.328\nWe could put this out,\noops, I'm trying to click.\n\n200\n00:10:49.328 --> 00:10:56.299\nWe can just pipe that out to, say,\nlivehost, lovehost, I do love my livehost.\n\n201\n00:10:56.299 --> 00:11:02.740\nLiveHosts, man, .text for example.\n\n202\n00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.620\nAnd now I've got my liveHosts.txt.\n\n203\n00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.880\nAnd there it is,\nit's just my IP addresses.\n\n204\n00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.905\nSo now if I wanna go nmap -il,\n\n205\n00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:17.229\nlet's do a quick port scan,\nsomething real quick,\n\n206\n00:11:17.229 --> 00:11:22.681\noops, tell it where it is,\nlivehost.text-isin.\n\n207\n00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:26.618\nAnd it will run through, and\nit will do that scan but\n\n208\n00:11:26.618 --> 00:11:31.760\nonly using those three IP addresses\nthat are in that file, right.\n\n209\n00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.860\nAnd it's taken it's time, there It goes.\n\n210\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.410\n&gt;&gt; Mike that seems really handy when\nyou're trying to get a single field but\n\n211\n00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.770\nwhat if I have multiple fields is there\na way that we can pull back multiple\n\n212\n00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.390\nfields and see that output?\n\n213\n00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.990\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely that's a great question and\n\n214\n00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.660\ntypically when you're looking at like\na log file in this example it just wanted\n\n215\n00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.990\nthe IP sddress cuz I\nknew the format I needed.\n\n216\n00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:57.012\nDefeat an n map for later use, but\nwhat if I'm going through a log file and\n\n217\n00:11:57.012 --> 00:12:01.610\nwhat I really need to see is date,\nIP address, and user name, but\n\n218\n00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.940\nnot all the other stuff, right?\n\n219\n00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.440\nSo I need more than one field and\n\n220\n00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.222\nagain you just have to list\nthem out separated by commas.\n\n221\n00:12:07.222 --> 00:12:09.800\nOr you can do a dash for\na range of fields.\n\n222\n00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.648\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n223\n00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:13.495\nIf we bring that last command back.\n\n224\n00:12:13.495 --> 00:12:19.913\nI can do 2-5 for example and\nyou'll see that skips the first field.\n\n225\n00:12:19.913 --> 00:12:22.743\nI'm having a little bit of a weird\nthing with my numbering going on.\n\n226\n00:12:22.743 --> 00:12:26.293\nIt's not seeming to like the open and\nclose parentheses as a field.\n\n227\n00:12:26.293 --> 00:12:30.557\nBut what if I wanted just two and five?\n\n228\n00:12:30.557 --> 00:12:32.122\nWe could do two.\n\n229\n00:12:32.122 --> 00:12:36.022\nWell, let me say, you see how you\nget field 2, field, 3, field 4,\n\n230\n00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:37.070\nfield 5, right?\n\n231\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.680\nThe IP, the parentheses,\nthe status, and the up.\n\n232\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.990\nNow, if I wanted just 2 and 5,\nI don't get the up for some reason.\n\n233\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.928\nSomething's a little quirky inside here.\n\n234\n00:12:45.928 --> 00:12:48.386\nLet's change that to a 4.\n\n235\n00:12:48.386 --> 00:12:52.740\nAnd there you can see,\nnow I'm getting field 2 and field 4.\n\n236\n00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.530\nSo you can either separate them by commas\nand you can separate as many as you need.\n\n237\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:03.221\nWe can do, I mean technically, we could\ndo one, two, three, four and five.\n\n238\n00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:09.200\nBut then we're really not\ncutting anything, right?\n\n239\n00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.691\nBut just as an example, you can list\nout as many fields as you want.\n\n240\n00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:16.350\nThe only thing is your data does\nhave to kind of support this, right.\n\n241\n00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:21.150\nIf you don't have delimiters\nthat make it nice and tidy,\n\n242\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.650\nit's not gonna work that well.\n\n243\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.567\nIf the information you're looking for\nis sometimes in field two but\n\n244\n00:13:26.567 --> 00:13:29.604\nsometimes in field three,\nthat's not gonna work.\n\n245\n00:13:29.604 --> 00:13:33.042\nBut a lot of your log files\nhave very standardized output,\n\n246\n00:13:33.042 --> 00:13:35.230\nwhere the first item is an ID number.\n\n247\n00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.520\nThe second item is source IP address.\n\n248\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.580\nThe third item is code, the fourth\nitem is the actual error message.\n\n249\n00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.790\nThe fifth item is something else.\n\n250\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.830\nAnd every message,\nno matter what it's about,\n\n251\n00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.780\nno matter what log it's in,\nhas that same format.\n\n252\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.220\nSo things like that really\nlend itself to using the cut.\n\n253\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.100\nBut if you get into a file\nwhere it's not like that, or\n\n254\n00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.150\nthe log file has different fields based\non the type of event that it's logging,\n\n255\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.580\nit can really give you problems.\n\n256\n00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:06.520\nCuz field one for most of my events is the\nIP address, field two is my port number.\n\n257\n00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.290\nGreat, except for a few of them, field\ntwos actually the message cuz there's no\n\n258\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.010\nport number associating or\nsomething weird like that.\n\n259\n00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.836\nSo do be careful, don't expect\nit to work perfectly every time.\n\n260\n00:14:16.836 --> 00:14:20.190\nIt's all about how the data\nis set up in the first place.\n\n261\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.650\nAll right, the last thing I want\nto show you with the in Linux,\n\n262\n00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:30.210\nthat they specifically call out is\nthe diff command, let's do a man diff.\n\n263\n00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.117\nAnd you'll see there are instructions\nthat go with that so\n\n264\n00:14:33.117 --> 00:14:35.683\nyou can take a peak at\nthose when you're studying.\n\n265\n00:14:35.683 --> 00:14:39.765\nBut basically diff allows me to\ncompare two files and look for\n\n266\n00:14:39.765 --> 00:14:43.058\nthe differences between the two files,\nright.\n\n267\n00:14:43.058 --> 00:14:46.866\nAnd this is something that you really need\nto have, that the ability to look at two\n\n268\n00:14:46.866 --> 00:14:50.480\nfiles and immediately tell what\nthe differences are is great, right?\n\n269\n00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.254\nWe know like hashing algorithms,\nthose can be used to run,\n\n270\n00:14:54.254 --> 00:14:57.951\nwe can run a hashing algorithm on a file,\nget a hash value,\n\n271\n00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:02.950\ncompare it to the hash value of a, that\nsame file later on if its been modified.\n\n272\n00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.739\nIf the values are changed,\nthey don't match anymore but\n\n273\n00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:08.150\nit doesn't tell you what changed, right.\n\n274\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.200\nWhat if I need to figure out what\nhas changed between two files?\n\n275\n00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.230\nLet's say I'm comparing two log files,\nand they should be the same.\n\n276\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.985\nI need to make sure and go through\nthe log file line by line trying to\n\n277\n00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:23.415\nsee if they're exactly the same, would be\na nightmare, I mean it would be crazy.\n\n278\n00:15:23.415 --> 00:15:26.875\nSo that's where commands like\ndiff really come into play.\n\n279\n00:15:26.875 --> 00:15:31.874\nSo lets take a look, what I've got here,\nI've got a couple of files\n\n280\n00:15:31.874 --> 00:15:36.901\nthat I just setup to as an example\nmake it really simple for us to see.\n\n281\n00:15:36.901 --> 00:15:40.940\nI've got a file called test and\nit has two names, Mike and Von.\n\n282\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:46.690\nI've got another file called test2 and\nits got Mike, Wes and Von, right?\n\n283\n00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:50.099\nSo there is a little bit of difference,\neasy for us to spot the differences but\n\n284\n00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:53.573\nI thought that would be a good example to\nkind of show us how this command works.\n\n285\n00:15:53.573 --> 00:16:00.159\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ntype in diff test And test2.\n\n286\n00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:03.844\nName of the first file, name of\nthe second file, and I'll hit Enter.\n\n287\n00:16:03.844 --> 00:16:08.811\nAnd I get some strange output down here,\nright,\n\n288\n00:16:08.811 --> 00:16:12.090\nI've got 1a2 &gt; and then Wes.\n\n289\n00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:13.010\nIt's like wow, what the heck?\n\n290\n00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:17.230\nOkay, well we can tell Wes was the\ndifference, right, between file one and\n\n291\n00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.780\nfile two.\n\n292\n00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.890\nSo great,\nit did a good job of figuring that out.\n\n293\n00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.460\nBut that other stuff,\nwhat the heck is the rest of it there?\n\n294\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.000\nSome kind of secret code?\n\n295\n00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.220\nAnd it is, it's a secret code.\n\n296\n00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.640\nAnd if you're not in the club,\nyou don't get to know.\n\n297\n00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.565\nI'm just kidding.\n\n298\n00:16:31.565 --> 00:16:37.270\n[LAUGH]\nWes is like, no, that's not true.\n\n299\n00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.910\nSo what that is is it's\ntelling me a couple of things.\n\n300\n00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:45.990\nThat first line,\n1a2 Is telling me that the line\n\n301\n00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:52.050\nnumber in the first file one,\nneeds to be and that's actually not true.\n\n302\n00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:58.063\nLine number for the first file and\nthen and the line over the line two.\n\n303\n00:16:58.063 --> 00:17:01.480\nIt's telling me, what it's supposed\nto be telling me the first number is\n\n304\n00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.660\nthe line number from the first file.\n\n305\n00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.470\nThe second one, the a, is saying add,\nit can either be an a, a c or\n\n306\n00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.650\na d, add, change or delete.\n\n307\n00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.840\nAnd then the second number is\nthe line from the second file.\n\n308\n00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.940\nThe line number from the second file.\n\n309\n00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.330\nSo what it's telling me is that\nin that first file I need to add\n\n310\n00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.950\nthe second file line 2,\nsee how that's working?\n\n311\n00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.210\nAnd if you look right above\nthere Wes is the second line.\n\n312\n00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:33.790\nNow it's telling me to add it to\nline 1 which is kind of odd because\n\n313\n00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.800\nthat's not where it would go if\nI wanted it to match exactly.\n\n314\n00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.688\nIt should be on the second line.\n\n315\n00:17:38.688 --> 00:17:42.650\nThe little carrot, the greater than symbol\nin front of Wes is telling me that that\n\n316\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.930\ncame from the second file.\n\n317\n00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.540\nIf it was a less than symbol,\nwe would see that would be the file or\n\n318\n00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.590\nit was telling me that that line\ncome from the first file, all right.\n\n319\n00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.750\nSo a really cool command is sitting here\ntelling me, yes, there are differences.\n\n320\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.760\nWhat the differences are, where those\ndifferences are located, what line and\n\n321\n00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.680\nwhat file.\n\n322\n00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.360\nAnd how to change it, how to make it so\n\n323\n00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.640\nthat they are the same if\nthat's what I need to do.\n\n324\n00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.500\nHow is that for cool, right?\n\n325\n00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.900\nLet's switch it around and\nsee what happens.\n\n326\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.130\nWhat if I do, let's get out of there.\n\n327\n00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:16.900\nLet's do div Test2 test, right?\n\n328\n00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.990\nAnd now you can see my results\nare actually bit different,\n\n329\n00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:23.870\nI got 2d1&lt; Wes, all right?\n\n330\n00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:32.840\n2 is telling me from the second file\nI need to delete line one, all right?\n\n331\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.760\nWhich again, seems to be wrong.\n\n332\n00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.860\nTest 2, sorry, that's the second line,.\n\n333\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:39.850\nSorry, my bad.\n\n334\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.290\nI was reading my code wrong.\n\n335\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.960\nThe second line in the first file,\nneeds to be deleted.\n\n336\n00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.570\nAnd then it's just saying line\nnumber one in the second file,\n\n337\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.220\nbecause there's nothing to do\nwith the second file, right?\n\n338\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.050\nSo, it's just saying,\ngo to line two, delete it.\n\n339\n00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.580\nAnd what line is it?\n\n340\n00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.640\nIt's the one that says Wes.\n\n341\n00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.000\nRemember, the less than symbol\nis the text from the first file.\n\n342\n00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.530\nIt's a little confusing, I know,\n\n343\n00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:06.750\nand me saying it back to back like that\nit's like, wait, start over again.\n\n344\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.440\nSo, play around with that.\n\n345\n00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.180\nAgain, the code is basically the number,\n\n346\n00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:16.530\nin this case a 2 is the line\nnumber from the first file.\n\n347\n00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:20.700\nThe second code character is going\nto be either add, delete or change.\n\n348\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.050\nSo if the line doesn't need to be deleted\nbut maybe it was spelled differently,\n\n349\n00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.200\nit'll tell you, look, just change this.\n\n350\n00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.520\nSo add, delete or change.\n\n351\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.400\nAnd then the line number\nfrom the second file.\n\n352\n00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.110\nAnd this is telling me\nwhat's on those lines.\n\n353\n00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.880\nIf it's a less-than symbol,\nit's from the first file.\n\n354\n00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.140\nIf it's a greater-than symbol,\nit's from the second file.\n\n355\n00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.370\nLet's take a look at one\nthat's a little more complex.\n\n356\n00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.090\nI've got this authorization\nlog that I grabbed.\n\n357\n00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.158\nAnd let's take a look at it.\n\n358\n00:19:47.158 --> 00:19:52.780\nCat off.log and\nwe can see it's a pretty good size,\n\n359\n00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.130\nit's really not that big but\nit's a good size file.\n\n360\n00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.370\nDefinitely not something I would want to\ntry to thumb through with my human eye,\n\n361\n00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.870\ntrying to find the differences.\n\n362\n00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.540\nBecause I've got another\ncopy of that file here but\n\n363\n00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.980\nI deleted a couple of lines out of it.\n\n364\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.320\nNow I want you to compare these side by\nside and tell me what the differences are.\n\n365\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.210\nSo let's do it this way.\n\n366\n00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.960\nWe'll open that one,\nwe'll open that one and there we go.\n\n367\n00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.440\nWe're just gonna sit here all day and\nflip back and\n\n368\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.230\nforth and try to find the differences.\n\n369\n00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.310\nYeah, not gonna be any fun, right?\n\n370\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:28.354\nLet's close that and let's see if we can't\nuse our commands to do the same thing.\n\n371\n00:20:28.354 --> 00:20:33.430\nWe'll say diff auth.log and\n\n372\n00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:37.494\nI call it auth1.log.\n\n373\n00:20:37.494 --> 00:20:39.350\nAnd look it there, right?\n\n374\n00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:44.650\nSo if we read our code, this is\ntelling me that from the first file,\n\n375\n00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:48.540\nline 97 needs to be deleted so\n\n376\n00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:53.150\nthat it will then match\nline 96 in the second file.\n\n377\n00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:57.750\nAnd there is the line\nitself from the first file.\n\n378\n00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.510\nThis is the line I'm looking for\nso that I can delete it.\n\n379\n00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.883\nSo tells me the line number and\nshows me the content of that line.\n\n380\n00:21:04.883 --> 00:21:09.488\nThen this says, by the way,\nalso line 104 from the file and\n\n381\n00:21:09.488 --> 00:21:13.189\nline 106 from the first file,\nneed to be deleted so\n\n382\n00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:17.760\nthat they'll match line 102\nin the second file, right?\n\n383\n00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.810\nAnd again I can see the text\nof those two files.\n\n384\n00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:25.780\nAnd then the last one is telling me,\nactually, I think that was it, wasn't it?\n\n385\n00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:30.470\nYeah, so that was just scrolling there,\nit's a line wrapped on that.\n\n386\n00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.440\nSo it's telling me exactly what to\ndo to make those files the same.\n\n387\n00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:34.990\nAnd it might or\n\n388\n00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.950\nmight not be a case of you wanting\nto make those files the same, right?\n\n389\n00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.300\nI don't, in fact typically for\n\n390\n00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.890\ndoing a forensic investigation,\nwe don't wanna modify anything.\n\n391\n00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.170\nBut I definitely need to\nbe able to compare files.\n\n392\n00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.020\nAnd I know that I can use hashing\nalgorithms to do that, but\n\n393\n00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.770\nit doesn't tell me what's\ndifferent in there.\n\n394\n00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.630\nAnd if it's a shortened\nlist of names like we saw,\n\n395\n00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.330\nmaybe I can do that without a tool.\n\n396\n00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:01.410\nIf it's a log file like this,\nmuch easier if I have an automated or\n\n397\n00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.470\nsome tool to allow me to do that.\n\n398\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:09.150\nSo we've got Grep,\nwhich is gonna allow me to look for\n\n399\n00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.980\nwords within a line and\nonly return those lines.\n\n400\n00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.420\nIt actually is much more\npowerful than that and\n\n401\n00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.200\nwe'll get into regular expressions later.\n\n402\n00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.640\nWe've got cut which allows me to chop up\na file into fields by telling it what\n\n403\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.820\nthe delimiter is.\n\n404\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.930\nAnd then choosing the fields\nthat I want and the output and\n\n405\n00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:27.920\nwe saw that we could combine those two\nto generate the output that we wanted.\n\n406\n00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.790\nAnd then we say the dif command allows\nme to differentiate between two files,\n\n407\n00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.090\ndetermine whether or\nnot they are the same.\n\n408\n00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:38.570\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I can see, even though this is\nabout log analysis, I can see where that\n\n409\n00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:43.480\nwould come in handy comparing scripts,\nmaking sure that the scripts are the same.\n\n410\n00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.660\nThat was the first thing that\ncame to mind cuz I can't copy and\n\n411\n00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.730\npaste to save my life.\n\n412\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.680\nAnd I wanna make sure that this\nscript matches another script.\n\n413\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.700\nYou can use those commands, now that being\nsaid it does look like we're coming to\n\n414\n00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.160\nthe end of another episode.\n\n415\n00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.270\nBut I do know that we have some additional\ntopics that we need to fit in for\n\n416\n00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.100\nlog analysis.\n\n417\n00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.400\nMike, what do you say we go\ninto a part two on this one?\n\n418\n00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have to take a look and\n\n419\n00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.020\nsee how Windows allows us\nto do some similar things.\n\n420\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.170\n&gt;&gt; All right well that's a great\nplace to wrap this one up.\n\n421\n00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.470\nWe appreciate you being here Mike and\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n422\n00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.050\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n423\n00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:15.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n424\n00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.124\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n425\n00:23:18.124 --> 00:23:24.595\n[MUSIC]\n\n426\n00:23:24.595 -->

00:00:08.273\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:11.011\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.200\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to the ITProTV studios.\n\n6\n00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.600\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through out\n\n7\n00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.830\nseries in logical operations\ncyber sec first responder.\n\n8\n00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.880\nComing back with a part\ntwo in log analysis.\n\n9\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.910\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nis none other than Mr. Mike Roger.\n\n10\n00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.700\nMike how are you doing sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.950\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.118\nThanks for having me back,\nexcited to continue on with our analysis.\n\n13\n00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:35.380\nSo you know, in the previous episode,\nwe took a look at some of the tools we had\n\n14\n00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.780\nwithin our mixed environments,\nour Linux environments, Div,\n\n15\n00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.420\nCut and Grep,\nreduced to work with out log files and\n\n16\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.560\nmake it a little bit easier, parsing for\nimportant information, keywords.\n\n17\n00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.682\nYou know, I didn't should have probably\nuse an actual log file there and we'll\n\n18\n00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:57.652\ndo some later, like using grep to look for\nthe word denied or unsuccessful and\n\n19\n00:00:57.652 --> 00:01:02.760\nthings like that or patterns that you\nknow that belong to certain malware.\n\n20\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.320\nYou know, you can go in there and\ndo a grep for malware123.\n\n21\n00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.880\nOr some other pattern that you knew\nthat this malware produces, right?\n\n22\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.870\nYou can find things like that on these\nbulletins on these malware sites and\n\n23\n00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.980\nthen look for them in your log files.\n\n24\n00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.660\nIn Windows,\nwe do have some very similar tools.\n\n25\n00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.470\nWe don't have the same ones but\nthe one we'll start with is Find.\n\n26\n00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.140\nAnd Find is similar to Grep It allows\nme to look for text within a file.\n\n27\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.590\nLet's bump this font up\njust a wee bit on this guy,\n\n28\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.680\nmake it easier for us to see out there.\n\n29\n00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.450\nWell, hopefully that's\na little bit better there.\n\n30\n00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.260\nAnd the command is find.\n\n31\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.590\nYou could do it find /?, And\n\n32\n00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.180\nyou can see the syntax,\nyou can do capital V for not containing.\n\n33\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.590\nIf you just want to count the lines or\nif you want to display line numbers,\n\n34\n00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.213\nignore case, a few different\nswitches there that you can use.\n\n35\n00:02:00.213 --> 00:02:01.629\nBut it's not a,\n\n36\n00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:06.370\nit really doesn't work with the regular\nexpressions like we do with Grep.\n\n37\n00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.750\nBut, let's take a look\nat how we can do this.\n\n38\n00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.880\nLet's change over,\n\n39\n00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.380\nI know there's a log file on my\nsystem that I want to take a peak at.\n\n40\n00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.770\nSo, we are going to go to, oops,\nlet's change that into Linux and\n\n41\n00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.510\nWindows combined there,\nforward slash, back slash.\n\n42\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.250\nNow, let's see where's that guy at.\n\n43\n00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.930\nHe's in windows,\nSystem32/LogFiles/HTTPerrors.\n\n44\n00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.470\nAnd if we do a, and\nthere I go again with my Linux commands.\n\n45\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.730\nI can see I've got a HTTPerr1.log,\njust HTTP error log.\n\n46\n00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.190\nAnd what I wanna do is\nif we just CAT that,\n\n47\n00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.620\nor in Windows it would be type instead\nof cat, we don't have the cat command.\n\n48\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.000\nWe can take a look at it again, so\njust a standard long file, right?\n\n49\n00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.990\nAnd if we wanna search through this and\nlook for\n\n50\n00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.840\nparticular strings,\nwe can simply do a find.\n\n51\n00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.100\nAnd then, in quotes, we'll put,\nactually don't remember what I did.\n\n52\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.700\nI log in and\nthen the name of the file and enter.\n\n53\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.030\nAnd there I can see that I have one match,\nright?\n\n54\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.380\nIt found one line.\n\n55\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.635\nAnd if we look in, there is log in, right?\n\n56\n00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:20.910\nA couple things we want to notice here.\n\n57\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.390\nOne is it's actually part\nof another word right.\n\n58\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.290\nSo it's not looking forward on its own,\nthere's no spaces around.\n\n59\n00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.980\nWhat if I did this What if\nwe added a space in there?\n\n60\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.490\nNow, we'll see we don't get any results.\n\n61\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:44.006\nWhat if I did, took out the n but\nput an asterisk there?\n\n62\n00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.494\nAll right,\nstill don't get those results, right?\n\n63\n00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:50.933\nWe don't get that same use\nwith that wild card but\n\n64\n00:03:50.933 --> 00:03:54.740\nI can ignore the case if I choose to.\n\n65\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.139\nI could do a -i.\n\n66\n00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.702\nAnd now all of the sudden, I'll match\nlowercase log in's as well as this one,\n\n67\n00:04:02.702 --> 00:04:08.180\nactually has two where it would\nmatch either one of those.\n\n68\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.990\nSo it is case sensitive\nunless you use that switch i.\n\n69\n00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.250\n&gt;&gt; So grep, you showed us earlier how you\ngot a lot of options with it, you got wild\n\n70\n00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.858\ncards in there, but it looks like find And\nwhen you're looking for something Mike\n\n71\n00:04:19.858 --> 00:04:22.810\nlooks like you've gotta be very literal\nin what you're gonna be looking for.\n\n72\n00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.250\n&gt;&gt; You do, you have to kind of\nspell it out with that find there.\n\n73\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.380\nAnd there are ways to use\nregular expressions in Windows.\n\n74\n00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.280\nWe have there's a regex guy in here.\n\n75\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.920\nBut these are the tools again\nthat they call out on this exam.\n\n76\n00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.407\nSo get in there,\nplay around with the find commands,\n\n77\n00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:38.430\nlook at the different options you have and\nyou have to use switch question mark.\n\n78\n00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.450\nAnd try a few of them out and\nsee how you can manipulate files or\n\n79\n00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.940\ntext using that find command, right?\n\n80\n00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.724\nAnother one that they're\ngonna call out on the exam\n\n81\n00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:55.294\nis actually WMIC,\nwhich is an oldie but a goody.\n\n82\n00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:58.850\nWMI is my\nWindows Management Instrumentation.\n\n83\n00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.630\nAnd if you're familiar with Windows at\nall, and you've used this before you know,\n\n84\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.860\nif you haven't, I'm gonna tell you.\n\n85\n00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.970\nYou can get access to just\nall kinds of information\n\n86\n00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.040\nthrough the Windows\nManagement Instrumentation.\n\n87\n00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.850\nIt's great source of info.\n\n88\n00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.850\nIt also allows me to do it remotely,\nas long as I've got my\n\n89\n00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.350\nWinRM set up, my Windows Remote Management\nset up, I can reach out and\n\n90\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.090\ntouch machines on the network and\n\n91\n00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.800\nuse WMI to pull back information,\nconfig information, things like that.\n\n92\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.740\nHow much processor?\n\n93\n00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.600\nHow much memory?\n\n94\n00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.800\nIP addresses, subnets, I mean,\nyou name it and you can get it with WMI.\n\n95\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.680\nIt's really cool.\n\n96\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.300\nThere's a client called WMIC, so\n\n97\n00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.440\nWindows Management Instrumentation Client,\nthat you can use from the command line.\n\n98\n00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.450\nNow, I'll be honest with you,\n\n99\n00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.040\nit's been a little while since I played\nwith this because we have PowerShell now.\n\n100\n00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.660\nAnd in Windows environments\nPowerShell is the way to\n\n101\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.340\ngo because it does everything our\ncommand prompt did and then some.\n\n102\n00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.050\nIt's much easier to script with it,\nit's a really good tool.\n\n103\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.590\nBut again, on the objectives,\nthis specifically call out WMIC.\n\n104\n00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.420\nSo I wanna show you it, so\nyou can at least get familiar with it.\n\n105\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I gotta give you a little\nbit of credit here, too, Mike.\n\n106\n00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.340\nWhen it comes down to something like\nWindows Management instrumentation, right?\n\n107\n00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.080\nIt's a lot like SNMP in that\nThose object identifiers.\n\n108\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.920\nI don't know what they mean and\nyou really have to know the language.\n\n109\n00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.070\nSo you're really learning another language\nif you are going to dealing with WMI\n\n110\n00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.190\nat any level, right?\n\n111\n00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.860\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you really do.\n\n112\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.600\nSo let's play.\n\n113\n00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.890\nLet me change back to my route here.\n\n114\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.810\nAnd let's do this,\nI'm gonna type in wmic, for\n\n115\n00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.190\nWindows Management Instrumentation Client,\nand I'm gonna hit Enter.\n\n116\n00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.280\nAnd if you look at the prompt,\nwell, there is my,\n\n117\n00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.710\nlet's just zoom out,\nthat's a little too zoomied.\n\n118\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:52.500\nYou can see it changed my prompt,\nI'm at wmic:root\\cli, right.\n\n119\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.530\nI'm going to zoom back out.\n\n120\n00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.732\nAnd again, we're not gonna get worked\ncause we can spend all day talking about\n\n121\n00:06:57.732 --> 00:07:01.690\nWMI as West was saying,\nyou can get very complex with this.\n\n122\n00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.910\nBut we can also keep it relatively simple.\n\n123\n00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.780\nOnce I'm at this prompt, if I want\ninformation on a remote node I can type\n\n124\n00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.450\nin, /node: name of the node,\n\n125\n00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.680\nname of the computer I'm trying to reach\nout and touch, /user: and a user account\n\n126\n00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.360\nthat has credentials on that machine\nthat can look at this, and password.\n\n127\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.500\nAnd here's where you do wanna be\ncareful with something like this.\n\n128\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.670\nYou're gonna know my super\nsecret password after this.\n\n129\n00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.720\nSo if you had anybody shoulder surfing,\nor if you were trying to script this,\n\n130\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.950\nthis is a problem,\nbecause now my password in plain text and\n\n131\n00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.130\nanybody watching me type\ncould see what I was typing.\n\n132\n00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.420\nIf that was my administrator password,\nI definitely don't wanna get that out,\n\n133\n00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.490\nso do keep that in mind when\nwe're doing WMaya like this.\n\n134\n00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.820\nI'll hit enter and\nnotice I don't get an error.\n\n135\n00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.694\nIf something was to go wrong, I mean\nlike if it couldn't find that node or\n\n136\n00:07:56.694 --> 00:07:59.946\nif that account didn't have\nthe appropriate credentials.\n\n137\n00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.335\nIt would have let me know,\n\n138\n00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:05.260\nlet's say invalid node or some other\nair message as I went through there.\n\n139\n00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.490\nBut instead it just dumped me right back\nto the prompt which means that now knows\n\n140\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.695\nany commands I fire should\nbe sent against app1,\n\n141\n00:08:13.695 --> 00:08:17.395\na remote server to another VM I have\nrunning on this little network and\n\n142\n00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:21.375\nit's gonna use the administrator and\nthe password that I've typed in there.\n\n143\n00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.515\nSo if I wanna pull back information and\n\n144\n00:08:23.515 --> 00:08:27.445\nwhat they specifically call that\nagain in the logical operation,\n\n145\n00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:31.300\nCyberSec First Responder is how\nto get event log information.\n\n146\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.020\nAll right, so if I wanna reach out and\ntalk to that web server and\n\n147\n00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.020\npull back event log data,\nI could use this.\n\n148\n00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.510\nNow again,\nI will tell you real world not a chance.\n\n149\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.580\nI mean, I'm most likely going to,\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n150\n00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.800\nThere's other ways I could\nprobably do this, I say probably,\n\n151\n00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.760\nthere are many other\nways we could do this.\n\n152\n00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.160\nBut this is a pretty quick and\ndirty way to do it, and\n\n153\n00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.880\nit's installed on most computers.\n\n154\n00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.310\nYou've got to make sure\nremote administration,\n\n155\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.580\nremote management is turned\non on the other end.\n\n156\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.000\nSo there are some gotchas there.\n\n157\n00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.960\nIt's not like okay you can just walk\ninto a network, sit at a machine and go.\n\n158\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.510\nBut maybe in your organization, your\nWindows environment and use group policy\n\n159\n00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.990\nto enable remote administration on most\nof your servers that have to deal with so\n\n160\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.340\nthat parts already taken care of, right?\n\n161\n00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.970\nAnd if you just need a real quick\nsit down at a command prompt and\n\n162\n00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.800\nget some information back,\nthis really isn't bad.\n\n163\n00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.550\nAnd once you memorize a couple commands,\n\n164\n00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.950\nor you have them scripted out,\nyou're good to go.\n\n165\n00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:27.448\nSo I give this a lot of grief,\nbut it is useful.\n\n166\n00:09:27.448 --> 00:09:31.000\nI don't wanna make you think that this\nis something that you'll never ever do.\n\n167\n00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.250\nSo there are gonna be times when\nthis is the appropriate tool,\n\n168\n00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.800\nand that's what this course is all about.\n\n169\n00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.280\nYou're knowing the appropriate tools\nto use In different scenarios.\n\n170\n00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.740\nSo let me show you exactly how this works.\n\n171\n00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.990\nI'm gonna do ntevent, is going to\nbe what I'm trying to retrieve.\n\n172\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.580\nThat allows me to get into\nthe log files where, and\n\n173\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:54.880\nthen in quotes logfile equals,\nright, and then security.\n\n174\n00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.490\nAnd security needs to be quoted but\nI'm already inside quotes, so, or\n\n175\n00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.070\nI've got double quotes so I'm gonna use\na single quote around the name of the log\n\n176\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:07.170\nI'm looking for\nsecurity in my single quote for that.\n\n177\n00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.780\nAnd this is why I need those overall\n\n178\n00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.790\nquotes cause I wanna group everything\ntogether and then end clause.\n\n179\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:20.060\nAnd eventType = 5 and\nthen I'll end my quote.\n\n180\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.560\nSo those outer quotes allow me to group\nthose two statements in my end, and\n\n181\n00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.760\nthere's now, both half of\nthe statement needs to be true.\n\n182\n00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.560\nIt's gonna pull from the security log,\nand if only if eventType is five.\n\n183\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.600\nAnd gosh if I can remember\nthe warn of the order.\n\n184\n00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.610\nWarning critical information\naudit success, audit failure.\n\n185\n00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.720\nI think otherwise it might be\ncritical warning information.\n\n186\n00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.450\nI have to double check.\n\n187\n00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.710\nAnyway type one through five or\nyour different messages right?\n\n188\n00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.300\nAnd type five as the audit failure.\n\n189\n00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.570\nSo I wanna search my security log and\n\n190\n00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.070\nI wanna see if there's any\nfailed log in attempts.\n\n191\n00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.870\nWell, again if I had access to the log\nfile I'm gonna show you event viewer and\n\n192\n00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.220\nthere's great filtering\ncapabilities in there.\n\n193\n00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.126\nBut from the command line, and using WMI,\nthis is the way we would do it.\n\n194\n00:11:06.126 --> 00:11:10.875\nSo eventType = 5 and\nthen what do I wanna retrieve?\n\n195\n00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:14.930\nCuz I could send back\nthe entire event log event.\n\n196\n00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:20.540\nBut I don't need all of that information,\nso I can specify, I wanna get,\n\n197\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:26.280\nlet's do source name, and\nI'm just gonna separate these with commas.\n\n198\n00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.239\nWe'll do timegenerated.\n\n199\n00:11:31.999 --> 00:11:35.130\nAnd what else do I wanna get out of that?\n\n200\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.250\nThat should be good.\n\n201\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.310\nWe'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n202\n00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.700\nAnd there we go.\n\n203\n00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.700\nYou know what?\nI could've added the message,\n\n204\n00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.870\nlet's do that real quick.\n\n205\n00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.260\nLet me get back down to here and add.\n\n206\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.550\nBecause here we're seeing the log but\n\n207\n00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.210\nI'm not seeing the actual message\nthat it's coming through.\n\n208\n00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.180\nSo I hit enter.\n\n209\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.160\nThat's a little bit better.\n\n210\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.100\nHorrible on the Word Wrap, but\n\n211\n00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:07.790\nwe should be able to see where I've\ngot an account failed to log on.\n\n212\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.540\nI can see the security ID,\nthe account name, the domain,\n\n213\n00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.780\nremote logon request originated work\nstation name not always available.\n\n214\n00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:21.310\nAnd again, the actual messages are not\nimportant, but the operation is.\n\n215\n00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.170\nYou see that I was able to\nreach out across the network,\n\n216\n00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.160\ngo do the log file on that remote\nwindows based machine, and\n\n217\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.290\npull back the just the event ID type five.\n\n218\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.940\nAnd Wes, I think you looked\nthat up what we get there?\n\n219\n00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.960\n&gt;&gt; I did, and you were right.\n\n220\n00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.320\nError is one, and it goes from there,\nand then it's two is warning,\n\n221\n00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.930\nthree is informational,\nfour is security audit success, and\n\n222\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.780\nfive is security audit failure.\n\n223\n00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.470\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, there we go.\n\n224\n00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.430\nAll right, so\nthat's just a quick dirty way, again,\n\n225\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:54.200\nto using those codes to filter out\nwhere we talked about earlier,\n\n226\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.440\nI just wanna see the warnings or\nI just wanna see the criticals.\n\n227\n00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.265\nOr in this case,\nI just want to see the audit failures,\n\n228\n00:12:59.265 --> 00:13:01.975\ncuz that's what I need to know.\n\n229\n00:13:01.975 --> 00:13:03.780\nSo even after all the grief I get it,\n\n230\n00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.920\nyou can see where this would be very\nuseful because I can just sit down and\n\n231\n00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.470\nreal quick hey have we had any failed log\non attempts on that web server today.\n\n232\n00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.680\nOkay, let's go look at the log file and\nsee.\n\n233\n00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.450\nI don't have to reach out,\nI don't have to remote desktop out there.\n\n234\n00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.290\nI can just run disk command and\nreturn that information.\n\n235\n00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:25.860\nSo that's a little peek at the WMIC, the\nWindows Management Instrumentation Client.\n\n236\n00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.400\nType in quit to get out of that and\n\n237\n00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:34.190\nthat will bring you back to\nyour normal command prompt.\n\n238\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.580\nAll right,\nnext thing I wanna look at in Windows here\n\n239\n00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.740\nis the event viewer itself because this\nis where all the information is stored.\n\n240\n00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.041\nSo let's go over to the even viewer.\n\n241\n00:13:47.429 --> 00:13:49.910\nIt's slowly accepting my characters.\n\n242\n00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.040\nThere we go.\n\n243\n00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.778\nAnd we'll open that guy up.\n\n244\n00:13:53.897 --> 00:13:54.700\nMaybe.\n\n245\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.730\nAnd again, I know they point\nthis out on the objective,\n\n246\n00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.040\nwhere they call out\nspecifically the event viewer.\n\n247\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.020\nSo I wanna spend a little time in here and\n\n248\n00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.550\nshow you a few things about the event\nviewer that we need to be familiar with.\n\n249\n00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:11.270\nFirst of all, over here on the top\nleft I've got my Windows logs.\n\n250\n00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.620\nI'm gonna expand that out and\n\n251\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.930\nwe'll see the main logs\napplication security, and system.\n\n252\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.990\nWe also see setup, which is for\ninstallation and applications.\n\n253\n00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.140\nThey can log messages there Forwarded\nevents, this has to do with subscriptions,\n\n254\n00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.960\nwhen you're pulling logs from\nother systems back here.\n\n255\n00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.990\nBut as far as local log files go,\n\n256\n00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.370\napplication is where your\napplications store events.\n\n257\n00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.090\nSecurity is where any auditing goes,\nright?\n\n258\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.180\nWhether you're auditing logon events,\nor file access, or whatever it is you've\n\n259\n00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.460\nchosen to audit in your audit policy,\nthose end up in your security log.\n\n260\n00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.990\nIf you go way back in the day,\nthe security log was always blank and\n\n261\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.660\neveryone is like wait,\nwhat kind of security log is this?\n\n262\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.280\nWell, we didn't audit logins by\ndefault and so it would just be empty,\n\n263\n00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.010\nthere was no audit policy.\n\n264\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:57.770\nNow Windows Audits, log in events,\nand a few other things, by default so\n\n265\n00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.330\nthere is some things in the security log.\n\n266\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.250\n&gt;&gt; You know Mike, when it comes to event\nviewer you were showing us in that\n\n267\n00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.490\ncommand that if were using something like\nWindows Management Instrumentation we have\n\n268\n00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.510\nto put a code in there.\n\n269\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.730\nIs there a way that we can see\nrepresented in the GUI itself,\n\n270\n00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.540\nthose different event classes.\n\n271\n00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely.\n\n272\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.740\nPretty little icons.\n\n273\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.770\nThat makes it a whole\nlot easier to work with.\n\n274\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.810\nThe system log is where your system is\ngoing to log events your operating system.\n\n275\n00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.820\nSo let's take a look let's go to that\nsecurity log just select it over here and\n\n276\n00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.710\nthere are dozens if not\nhundreds of other log files.\n\n277\n00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.570\nSo this is just a quick peak at one,\nright?\n\n278\n00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:37.170\nAnd here is my security log and\nI can see all of my events.\n\n279\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.560\nI can see what the keyword is,\nwhat the date and time was,\n\n280\n00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.950\nthe source, the event id,\nand the task category.\n\n281\n00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.320\nAnd I've got this little\ngold key over here.\n\n282\n00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.800\nAnd as I scroll down through here,\nlet's see where we can find.\n\n283\n00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.148\nSo I could scroll, and scroll, and scroll.\n\n284\n00:15:54.148 --> 00:15:56.605\nAnd looking for failed logon event and\n\n285\n00:15:56.605 --> 00:16:01.152\nyou can see I didn't check the date\non the results of our Find command.\n\n286\n00:16:01.152 --> 00:16:03.822\nI guess I should have,\nactually I was looking at the app one.\n\n287\n00:16:03.822 --> 00:16:05.299\nThat's where those were, right?\n\n288\n00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:07.012\nWe were doing a remote computer, so.\n\n289\n00:16:07.012 --> 00:16:10.882\nIt doesn't look like there's any here,\nbut again,\n\n290\n00:16:10.882 --> 00:16:16.132\ngoing through these line by line,\njust eyeballing them can be tedious.\n\n291\n00:16:16.132 --> 00:16:19.110\nIt can be time consuming,\nand it can be error prone.\n\n292\n00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.160\nBecause as we scroll, we go too fast,\nor we just miss things.\n\n293\n00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.529\nI'm talking to Wes, I look back down and\nI've already scrolled past 30 lines.\n\n294\n00:16:25.529 --> 00:16:29.630\nSo it's not the most\nefficient way to do things.\n\n295\n00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.395\nAll right, so\nwe have our filter capabilities.\n\n296\n00:16:32.395 --> 00:16:36.152\nAnd over here on the right\nhand side of my action pane,\n\n297\n00:16:36.152 --> 00:16:39.040\nI've got my filter current log.\n\n298\n00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.880\nAnd let's pull that up.\n\n299\n00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.696\nAnd in this filter dialogue box you can\nsee that I have things like any time,\n\n300\n00:16:45.696 --> 00:16:46.243\nright?\n\n301\n00:16:46.243 --> 00:16:47.559\nI've got my, and I'll click on these.\n\n302\n00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:52.415\nI can't click on them while I've\ngot it zoomed in unfortunately, but\n\n303\n00:16:52.415 --> 00:16:53.743\nI've got the log.\n\n304\n00:16:53.743 --> 00:16:57.343\nAnd it could be anytime, it could\nbe last seven days, what have you.\n\n305\n00:16:57.343 --> 00:17:01.684\nEvent level, error, critical,\nwarning, verbose, informational,\n\n306\n00:17:01.684 --> 00:17:03.700\nyou can go down to event log.\n\n307\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.410\nBecause I right-clicked on the security,\nor\n\n308\n00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.160\nhad security selected,\nnotice event log security is grayed out.\n\n309\n00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.130\nBut I'll show you in a second,\nwhen you create custom views,\n\n310\n00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.810\nyou can actually pull from multiple log\nfiles, which is a very handy feature,\n\n311\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:20.120\nevent sources, keywords, user, computer,\nso lots of things I can filter by.\n\n312\n00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.980\nAnd let's just do one real quick.\n\n313\n00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.630\nI'll show you this dropdown list.\n\n314\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.810\nLast hour or last 24 hours, right?\n\n315\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.880\nIf I come in and do this every day, why do\nI wanna see anything older than 24 hours?\n\n316\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.920\nI saw those events yesterday, right?\n\n317\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.110\nOr whatever the case may be, two days ago.\n\n318\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.440\nSo you can choose the different time,\nyou can do a custom range.\n\n319\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:41.160\nI'll just do criticals and warnings and\nerrors and I'll leave it on anytime.\n\n320\n00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.539\nAnd I'll click, OK.\n\n321\n00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:46.663\nAnd it doesn't look like I have any\nevents, so that's not very much fun.\n\n322\n00:17:46.663 --> 00:17:51.102\nIf I want to get rid of the log, or the\nfilter I should say, clear log will clear,\n\n323\n00:17:51.102 --> 00:17:54.260\nI'm sorry,\nthat's not what I wanted to click on.\n\n324\n00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.861\nClear filter is what we\nwant to click on over here.\n\n325\n00:17:56.861 --> 00:17:58.190\nLet's zoom in so you can see that.\n\n326\n00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.486\nClear filter, and\nit pulls everything back.\n\n327\n00:18:00.486 --> 00:18:03.766\nSo one of the things when you're\nfiltering logs, you want to keep in mind,\n\n328\n00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:05.797\nwhen you are looking in\nthe event viewer here,\n\n329\n00:18:05.797 --> 00:18:08.060\nright up here at the top\nit's actually telling me.\n\n330\n00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.436\nBecause you might think,\nno, the log is blank.\n\n331\n00:18:10.436 --> 00:18:13.070\nWell there's 22,000 events in there.\n\n332\n00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.640\nThere just being filtered and\nwhen you filter, you are not removing, so\n\n333\n00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.640\nwhen you clear the filter all\nthose events come right back.\n\n334\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.670\nLet's go take a look at system.\n\n335\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.880\nIt's going to be a little more exciting,\nhopefully.\n\n336\n00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.590\nAnd let's filter that down again,\nby critical error and warning, and\n\n337\n00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.030\nwe'll click OK.\n\n338\n00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.676\nAnd there we go, now I can see\nthose different event types and\n\n339\n00:18:31.676 --> 00:18:36.484\nthe different icons associated with those,\nat least for errors and warnings.\n\n340\n00:18:36.484 --> 00:18:37.980\nHopefully, I don't have any critical.\n\n341\n00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.250\nAll right, so that's taking\na look at doing the filtering,\n\n342\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.380\nwe talked about severity.\n\n343\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.300\nThe other thing I want to\ntalk about is saving these.\n\n344\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.800\nBecause if I have to come in here,\nlet's say this is part of my job.\n\n345\n00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.672\nI'm the one that got tasked with reading\nthrough the log files, looking for\n\n346\n00:18:53.672 --> 00:18:57.950\ncritical events, and trying to\nfigure out what to do about those.\n\n347\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.660\nI don't want to come in here and\ncreate those filters all the time.\n\n348\n00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.380\nThat's where I can create my custom view.\n\n349\n00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.900\nSo I can click, Create Custom View,\n\n350\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.405\nand I get this exact same\ndialogue box as my filter.\n\n351\n00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:12.830\nBut let's say I just want to say the last\n24 hours, critical errors and warnings.\n\n352\n00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.466\nAnd I wanna check, and\nnot from just the system log,\n\n353\n00:19:16.466 --> 00:19:21.188\nbut also the application log and\nalso the security log, all right?\n\n354\n00:19:21.188 --> 00:19:23.351\nAnd I'll go ahead and close that up, but\n\n355\n00:19:23.351 --> 00:19:25.652\nmaybe your job was to monitor DNS and\nDHCP.\n\n356\n00:19:25.652 --> 00:19:29.539\nI could definitely expand out my\napplication and service logs and\n\n357\n00:19:29.539 --> 00:19:30.464\nthen Windows.\n\n358\n00:19:30.464 --> 00:19:32.599\nAnd I could go down in DHCP operational,\nand\n\n359\n00:19:32.599 --> 00:19:34.980\nI could pull events from\nthose just the same way.\n\n360\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.730\nThose are gonna show up in\nthese check boxes, right?\n\n361\n00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.910\nSo I could definitely pull\nfrom any log I want to.\n\n362\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.210\nAnd that's all I'm gonna do.\n\n363\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.216\nI'm just gonna do a real simple filter and\nI'll click OK.\n\n364\n00:19:47.216 --> 00:19:48.840\nAnd it wants me to give it a name.\n\n365\n00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.728\nAnd I'll say, Daily View.\n\n366\n00:19:52.601 --> 00:19:56.290\nAll right, and I probably can't use\na space in there so let's get rid of that.\n\n367\n00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:57.040\nWhere am I gonna put it?\n\n368\n00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.740\nI'm gonna put it in custom views but you\ncan make folders to kinda organize these.\n\n369\n00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:05.040\nI'll click, OK and now over here in\nmy custom views is my daily view so\n\n370\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.480\neveryday I come in I click on daily\nview and there's my custom view.\n\n371\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.770\nAnd we start combining\nthis of a subscription and\n\n372\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.800\npulling logs from multiple servers.\n\n373\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.840\nYou can give powerful results with\nthe filtering capabilities built in to\n\n374\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.580\nThis Windows Log system.\n\n375\n00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:25.950\nLast thing I wanna show you about the logs\nis clearing them and saving them.\n\n376\n00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:32.740\nLet's go back over here to\nthe security log, for example.\n\n377\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.280\nIf we wanna clear this log,\nmaybe it's getting bigger\n\n378\n00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.790\nWe need to make it easier\nto get back to events.\n\n379\n00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.068\nWe can clear this out occasionally.\n\n380\n00:20:43.068 --> 00:20:47.920\nWhat you wanna keep in mind is,\nyou never wanna clear the log.\n\n381\n00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.430\nThat's not a good way to say it.\n\n382\n00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:54.290\nRarely are you gonna ever clear\nthe log and not save it, right?\n\n383\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:58.150\nBecause when you clear this log, you're\ndoing just that, you are deleting or\n\n384\n00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.680\nremoving the events from the log.\n\n385\n00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.560\nSo if you don't have a backup of these and\nyou really don't wanna have to take\n\n386\n00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.390\na backup tape out just to\ngo find your old log files.\n\n387\n00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.600\nMake sure you save them,\nand it'll prompt you.\n\n388\n00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.540\nIn fact, you saw me click on it by mistake\nearlier, and you saw it prompt me.\n\n389\n00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:18.810\nIf I click clear log, it says,\ndo I wanna save this log before clearing?\n\n390\n00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.250\nAnd I most definitely do, right?\n\n391\n00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.951\nIt's very rare that I want\nto clear without saving it.\n\n392\n00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:26.883\nSo I'll do save and clear and\nthen I'm going to dump this.\n\n393\n00:21:26.883 --> 00:21:30.096\nI'll just put in My Docs for\nnow, that's fine.\n\n394\n00:21:30.096 --> 00:21:31.928\nI'll call it sec.old.\n\n395\n00:21:35.345 --> 00:21:39.114\nDevtx and I'll click Save.\n\n396\n00:21:39.114 --> 00:21:41.415\nAnd that's not how you spell old, Mike.\n\n397\n00:21:41.415 --> 00:21:43.753\nAll right, invalid filename formatted.\n\n398\n00:21:43.753 --> 00:21:46.972\nIt didn't like that, so\nlet's just call it oldsec.\n\n399\n00:21:49.289 --> 00:21:54.022\nAll right, and now notice everything is\ngone except there is one event that comes\n\n400\n00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:57.232\nback and this is an event that\nsays the log was cleared.\n\n401\n00:21:57.232 --> 00:21:59.637\nAnd it tells you who cleared it,\nwhen they cleared it,\n\n402\n00:21:59.637 --> 00:22:01.270\nwhere they cleared it from, right?\n\n403\n00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:06.020\nSo, at least I have a record of Wes\nmaybe accidentally cleared the log file.\n\n404\n00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.557\nWell, there's gonna be an event in there\nsaying that Wes cleared the log file.\n\n405\n00:22:09.557 --> 00:22:10.647\nI don't know what you're talking about?\n\n406\n00:22:10.647 --> 00:22:11.702\nI didn't do it.\n\n407\n00:22:11.702 --> 00:22:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Mike, now with the saving of the logs\nthere, do I understand this right?\n\n408\n00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.490\nIs that something that you\nwant to keep protected?\n\n409\n00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.250\nThis isn't just something you want to\nkeep on a spreadsheet in the middle of\n\n410\n00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.600\nthe lobby where everybody can see it.\n\n411\n00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.930\nNow I am joking here.\n\n412\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.460\nBut these logs themselves,\nthey can be a point of attack.\n\n413\n00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.364\nSo we have to be careful\nwhere we save them, right?\n\n414\n00:22:26.364 --> 00:22:29.289\n&gt;&gt; It's just about all the data that we\ncollect when we're doing this kind of\n\n415\n00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:31.110\nthing should be considered sensitive.\n\n416\n00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.890\nIt's a great point,\n\n417\n00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.200\nbecause think about the information\nthat's in the log files, all right.\n\n418\n00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.250\nThere's a reason you have to be\nan administrator to get into here.\n\n419\n00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:43.690\nIt has IP addresses, it could\npotentially have user names in there.\n\n420\n00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.651\nAll kinds of information we can get out\nof there definitely want to protect it.\n\n421\n00:22:46.651 --> 00:22:49.110\nIf you ever need to go back and\nopen up one of those logs,\n\n422\n00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.090\nyou simply go open saved log.\n\n423\n00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.530\nYou browse and find your event log.\n\n424\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:58.548\nYou click open,\nyou tell it where I wanna open that up.\n\n425\n00:22:58.548 --> 00:23:01.120\nAnd I say, OK, and there we go.\n\n426\n00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.638\nThere is that log know some way down here,\nin the saved logs, all right.\n\n427\n00:23:06.638 --> 00:23:09.967\nAnd I can still use my\nfilters against the save log.\n\n428\n00:23:09.967 --> 00:23:13.600\nAnd we can do all of that just like\nwe did when it was a live log.\n\n429\n00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.180\nSo the Event Viewer, if you haven't messes\nwith this in Windows before, I know\n\n430\n00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.920\nA few years ago, the Event Viewer, the\nEvent Log, were kind of a joke in Windows.\n\n431\n00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.670\nPeople made fun of them because they\ngive you very cryptic information,\n\n432\n00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.480\nthere wasn't a lot of it,\nit was difficult to work with.\n\n433\n00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.440\nBig, big strides in what you can do with\nthe Event Logs, so do take a look at that.\n\n434\n00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.120\nLearn to get comfortable in there\nbecause as a first responder,\n\n435\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.150\nwe're gonna be dealing\nwith log files a lot.\n\n436\n00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.230\nSo understanding these tools, the ones\nwe learned in the previous episode,\n\n437\n00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.948\nones we learned in this episode\nare gonna be a big part of your routine.\n\n438\n00:23:44.948 --> 00:23:47.544\nAll right, and Wes,\nI know we got a little more to go but\n\n439\n00:23:47.544 --> 00:23:50.360\nI don't think I can squeeze\nit in the time we got left.\n\n440\n00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.146\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n441\n00:23:51.146 --> 00:23:53.910\nwe're gonna have to leave them\nwith another Mike cliff hanger up.\n\n442\n00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.750\nDon't blame it on me, but do come back.\n\n443\n00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.680\nWe got,\nwe're going to go into a part three.\n\n444\n00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.400\nSo Mike, that looks like it's a great\nplace to go ahead and wrap this one\n\n445\n00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.790\nOne up, as always we appreciate having\nyou here on the studios with us.\n\n446\n00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.652\nWe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n447\n00:24:05.652 --> 00:24:07.041\nSigning out for ITProTV.\n\n448\n00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:08.600\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n449\n00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.400\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:10.893\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.360\n&gt;&gt; Hello out there in TV land,\nwelcome back to the ITProTV studio.\n\n5\n00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.090\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode, we're continuing through our\n\n6\n00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.070\nseries in logical operations\nCyberSec First Responder.\n\n7\n00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.030\nAnd we're coming back with\na part 3 in log analysis.\n\n8\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.890\nAnd joining us back in the studio is\nnone other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.970\nHow you doing sir?\n\n10\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.720\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.230\nYeah, we got a little bit more to\ndo when it comes to log analysis,\n\n12\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.130\na couple more things they\ncall out on the objectives.\n\n13\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.110\nSo, next on our list of things to\ntalk about is actually scripting and\n\n14\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.670\nscripting is, well one, it's a lot of fun.\n\n15\n00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.630\nHopefully you guys and\ngals out there are geeks like me.\n\n16\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.620\nAnd scripting is all\nabout automating things.\n\n17\n00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.920\nThings that I do that are tedious or\nrepetitive,\n\n18\n00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.410\nI can try to automate and\nthat's what scripting is all about.\n\n19\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.700\nWe've got several different scripting\nlanguages that we can use and\n\n20\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.380\nthis test is not on scripting.\n\n21\n00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.040\nSo, done with that.\n\n22\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.070\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n23\n00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.680\nWe do need to know a little bit about it,\nright?\n\n24\n00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.040\nWe need to understand\nthey call out a couple.\n\n25\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.990\nThey call out bash and\nPowerShell as our scripting language is.\n\n26\n00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.820\nSo I just wanted to show you a couple of\nexamples of how we go about writing and\n\n27\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.760\nthen running scripts in those two\ndifferent scripting languages.\n\n28\n00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.160\nSo let's start with Cally.\n\n29\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.685\nWe'll take a look at bash, right.\n\n30\n00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:33.600\nBash, my born again shell\nhas a scripting language.\n\n31\n00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.870\nSo we can write scripts,\nwe can automate things.\n\n32\n00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.390\nAnd really what it comes down to is\nwhatever I can in my bash shell,\n\n33\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.570\nI can script it out.\n\n34\n00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.270\nWhich just means I take my commands and\n\n35\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.230\nI put them in a file instead\nof in my bash shell.\n\n36\n00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.980\nAnd then from my shell, I just call\nthe file and it executes those commands.\n\n37\n00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.410\nThere are some tricks that you'll\nget familiar with as far as\n\n38\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.390\nif one command has to complete and\nsend back data for the next plan,\n\n39\n00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.920\nthings like that that\nyou'll have to worry about.\n\n40\n00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.800\nIn its simplest form,\nwe just run our commands.\n\n41\n00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.180\nSo let me show you an example here.\n\n42\n00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.420\nI have a script that I\nwrote up real quick.\n\n43\n00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.897\nIn fact, the stuff that we were\ndoing earlier with nmap and\n\n44\n00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.931\nI said this would be a great\nthing to script out.\n\n45\n00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.660\nWell, that's what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna script that up.\n\n46\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.840\nNow just keep you from sitting here and\nwatching me type, cuz I'm not the best\n\n47\n00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.160\ntyper as you guys have noticed,\nI've already written up my script.\n\n48\n00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.270\nSo I'm going to show you\nwhat I've got right here and\n\n49\n00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.060\nthen I'll zoom in and\nwe'll kind of work around here.\n\n50\n00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.530\nSo what you'll see is\nit's just a text file.\n\n51\n00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.080\nIn fact, you know what?\n\n52\n00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.720\nLet's do this,\n\n53\n00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.060\nrather than [INAUDIBLE] it there, let's\nopen that up with my little text editor.\n\n54\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.590\nMake it a little bit easier to see and\n\n55\n00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.270\nyou can definitely tell what's part of\nthe text file and what's not, right?\n\n56\n00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.830\nSo it's just a text file and\nyou can see my #!/bin/bash,\n\n57\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.740\nthat is what my bash scripts\nare gonna start with.\n\n58\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.500\nAnd then I've chosen to echo,\necho means to print the screen, right,\n\n59\n00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.605\nany messages that I wanna type out,\nI can do that.\n\n60\n00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:06.085\nSo I put echo running scan, right?\n\n61\n00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:09.315\nJust to make it look like\nwe did something cool.\n\n62\n00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:11.505\nThen the actual command\nis on the next line,\n\n63\n00:03:11.505 --> 00:03:16.110\nstarts with nmap and I'm just doing\nthat -sn, a little port scan.\n\n64\n00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.250\nAnd my IP address range 10.0.100.0/24.\n\n65\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.300\nAnd then I'm gonna output that,\nthe -o into a grepable format.\n\n66\n00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.240\nAnd I'm gonna put that on my desktop and\nI'm logged in as root.\n\n67\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.330\nAnd I wanna name it scripttest.txt.\n\n68\n00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.240\nAnd then I'm also gonna add a little\ngreater than symbol at the end there.\n\n69\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.580\nSwitch dev or /dev/null.\n\n70\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.620\nThat's actually something I added\nrecently, because without that,\n\n71\n00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.090\nwhen I run this script, it would\ngenerate my text files that I wanted but\n\n72\n00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.440\nit would also display the output\nin the terminal window.\n\n73\n00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.630\nAll right, and that I didn't want that.\n\n74\n00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.500\nSometimes that's convenient,\nmaybe you do want that.\n\n75\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.910\nOther times maybe you want\nto keep it neat and tidy and\n\n76\n00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.520\nnot all of the information scrolling\npast you on your terminal.\n\n77\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.907\nSo what you do is you send it out,\nthe output of this to dev/null,\n\n78\n00:04:11.907 --> 00:04:16.540\nits kind of like into never, neverland, it\njust disappears into nothing, all right.\n\n79\n00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.120\nSo that's what I'm doing,\nthey are still gonna create the file but\n\n80\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.000\nit's not gonna display anything on\nthe screen as that command is running.\n\n81\n00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.810\nSo I'm not gonna see nmap and the version\nand stuff and then my command and\n\n82\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.160\nmy results and things like that.\n\n83\n00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.030\nAll right, now once it creates\nthis file scripttest.txt,\n\n84\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.740\nright, it's gonna dump\nthat out on my desktop.\n\n85\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.080\nAnd the next command\nis what we learned and\n\n86\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.586\nI'm gonna try to move my mouse and\nI can't.\n\n87\n00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:46.588\nSorry, my IBM is right there in\nthe middle,I [INAUDIBLE] ,I guess I could\n\n88\n00:04:46.588 --> 00:04:48.965\nzoom out, move that and then zoom back in.\n\n89\n00:04:48.965 --> 00:04:50.153\nThere we go.\n\n90\n00:04:50.153 --> 00:04:53.860\nAnd then we got grep,\nthe word up in quotes with a capital U,\n\n91\n00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.164\nremember from our previous episode,\nI'm just using that to look for\n\n92\n00:04:58.164 --> 00:05:00.720\nlines that have the word up in it.\n\n93\n00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.460\nBecause those are gonna be my live hosts.\n\n94\n00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.100\nThe ones that responded\nto the ping in my scan.\n\n95\n00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.320\nAnd I'm gonna take that,\nI'm going to pipe the results of that.\n\n96\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.450\nSo you can see I've got grep\nup the location of the file,\n\n97\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.380\nwhich is on my desktop.\n\n98\n00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.000\nAnd I'm saying look for\nall the lines with up.\n\n99\n00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.100\nAnd then take that result,\nnow what is the result?\n\n100\n00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.300\nIt's just the lines that\nhave the word up on it.\n\n101\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.640\nI'm gonna pipe that into the cut command\nand say look, go ahead and look for\n\n102\n00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.050\nuse a delimiter of a space and\ngive me the second field.\n\n103\n00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.500\nWhich if you remember from the other\nepisode, that's gonna be the IP address.\n\n104\n00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.271\nAnd then I'm gonna pipe the results\nof that into another file.\n\n105\n00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:41.570\nLivehost.txt, all right?\n\n106\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.340\nAnd I guess I'd better run\nthis from the desktop,\n\n107\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.910\notherwise, there's an input\nswitch root switch desktop,\n\n108\n00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.280\nwhich means wherever I run it,\nthat's where it's gonna go.\n\n109\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.510\nSo I need to make sure I'm in the right\ndirectory, so I can find it later.\n\n110\n00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.690\nAnd then after that command completes,\necho Live host list created successfully.\n\n111\n00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.890\nAnd again, that's just a string in quotes.\n\n112\n00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.060\nI could put no soup for\nyou, if I wanted to,\n\n113\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.050\nwhatever I want to put inside\nthere would be just fine.\n\n114\n00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.520\nAll right, so that is my script.\n\n115\n00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.660\nSo lets go ahead and\nwhile we're here, lets fix it.\n\n116\n00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.870\nLets go ahead and just make sure\nno matter where I run this from.\n\n117\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.020\nIt always puts my results\nout of my desktop, so\n\n118\n00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.800\nthat I don't have to worry\nabout trying to find it.\n\n119\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.100\nSo that should be good and\nwe'll click save for\n\n120\n00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.380\nmy changes and we'll close it, right.\n\n121\n00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.520\nWhat happens when I leave scripts,\nit usually breaks things, so\n\n122\n00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.330\nwe'll see what happens here.\n\n123\n00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.390\nAll right, so now we're gonna try to\nrun that script, you can see my prompt,\n\n124\n00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.890\nI'm already on the desktop, right?\n\n125\n00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.170\nSo there is that script, so I don't\nhave to specify a path or anything.\n\n126\n00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.720\nIt is executable in Linux.\n\n127\n00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.780\nSo I've gotta do the ./.\n\n128\n00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:55.600\nOnce I created that file,\nI had to do a chmod on that, right?\n\n129\n00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.367\nChmod, I did 755 and then script.\n\n130\n00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:06.353\n.All right, that changes the permissions,\n\n131\n00:07:06.353 --> 00:07:11.840\nif I do LSA, whoops, ls-l, there we go.\n\n132\n00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.200\nI will see what I did to that\nscript file was market executable.\n\n133\n00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.650\nNow, granted, I shouldn't do it that way.\n\n134\n00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.430\nHere we are teaching security and\n\n135\n00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.180\nI granted everybody execution\npermissions on this one.\n\n136\n00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.500\nNot the most secure way to do things,\nbut for our demo, it'll work just fine.\n\n137\n00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.730\nAgain, they're not\ntesting us on that part.\n\n138\n00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.340\nSo, it is executable.\n\n139\n00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.140\nSo let's run it,\nlet's clear this screen a little bit.\n\n140\n00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.772\nAnd let's do a ./script.\n\n141\n00:07:40.772 --> 00:07:42.875\nAnd I'll hit Enter.\n\n142\n00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:46.368\nAnd you can see my first message comes up,\nrunning scan and\n\n143\n00:07:46.368 --> 00:07:49.589\nit just sits there blinking,\nblinking, blinking.\n\n144\n00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:53.581\nSo what it's doing now is its\nactually executing that nmap scan in\n\n145\n00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:54.680\nthe background.\n\n146\n00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.292\nNotice the output is not\ncoming to my terminal.\n\n147\n00:07:57.292 --> 00:08:00.589\nBecause we chose to go out to switch desk,\nswitch null,\n\n148\n00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:04.043\nI don't have to see I'm not\nforced to watch the scan go by.\n\n149\n00:08:04.043 --> 00:08:08.360\nI could've done an ampersand to\nmove this to the background, too.\n\n150\n00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.993\nBut I kind of wanted to see my\nmessages pop up and things.\n\n151\n00:08:10.993 --> 00:08:11.609\nAnd there we go.\n\n152\n00:08:11.609 --> 00:08:14.330\nIt says live host list\ncreated successfully.\n\n153\n00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.810\nI'm back to my prompt.\n\n154\n00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.710\nAlso if I look at my desktop,\nI can see two new files.\n\n155\n00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:24.310\nAnd on the very bottom left hand\ncorner I see scripttest.txt.\n\n156\n00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.060\nThat was my initial file\nfrom the nmap scan.\n\n157\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:32.140\nAnd then up at the top second column\nthere my icons I see livehosts.txt and\n\n158\n00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:37.980\nthat was the output after I grepped it,\ncut it, and saved it as a new file.\n\n159\n00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.010\nSo let's cat that guy livehosts.txt.\n\n160\n00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:47.070\nAnd look at there, just the IP\naddresses of live responding machines.\n\n161\n00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:52.865\nAnd so now anytime I wanna do that and\nsave it out to a file, I can simply\n\n162\n00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:58.910\n./script and we're good to go,\nwhatever you happen to call your script.\n\n163\n00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:05.640\nYou should be a little more descriptive\nwith your titles than I am, all right?\n\n164\n00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.936\nDon't call it script because that doesn't\ntell other administrators or you later\n\n165\n00:09:08.936 --> 00:09:11.823\non six months after you've created\nthis what the heck that script does.\n\n166\n00:09:11.823 --> 00:09:16.354\nSo do make sure you're a little more\ndescriptive with your titles or\n\n167\n00:09:16.354 --> 00:09:18.480\nfile names there.\n\n168\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:24.380\nAll right, so that's again a very brief\nprimer when it comes to scripting in Bash.\n\n169\n00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.040\nReally what I want us to understand\nis that in a Linux environment,\n\n170\n00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.630\nwe can script things.\n\n171\n00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.210\nWe can automate our Bash\ncommands by using a Bash script.\n\n172\n00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.830\nIt's just a matter of typing those\ncommands, saving it in a file,\n\n173\n00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.570\nmarking it as executable and\nthen calling that script, all right.\n\n174\n00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:43.541\nSo play around with that.\n\n175\n00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:46.708\nIf there's some things that you do\nall the time that you're tired of,\n\n176\n00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:51.210\nmaybe, every time you come in you've gotta\ndo, I have configs, something simple here.\n\n177\n00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.430\nPut that in a file, save it and then call\nit after you mark it as executable and\n\n178\n00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.180\nsee what happens, all right?\n\n179\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.630\nSo you can see by starting to combine\nsome of this stuff we can get very,\n\n180\n00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.350\nvery powerful.\n\n181\n00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:06.890\nHere we're scripting and we're using grep\nand we're using cut to create that list.\n\n182\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:14.960\nAll right, so next let's switch over\nto the Windows side of the world.\n\n183\n00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.280\nSo we'll switch over to my DC here and\nwe're gonna script in this one.\n\n184\n00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.420\nWe don't have Bash, but\nwe have PowerShell, right.\n\n185\n00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.430\nPowerShell is a very, very powerful\nlanguage, no pun intended there, or\n\n186\n00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.760\npardon the pun, but it is,\nit's extremely powerful.\n\n187\n00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.000\nIt's a scripting language,\nwell, as we know it here,\n\n188\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.590\nthis is not a course on PowerShell.\n\n189\n00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.870\nDont expect to learn everything\nyou need to know about PowerShell.\n\n190\n00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.878\nBut there are great resources out there\nif you choose to go down this row.\n\n191\n00:10:42.878 --> 00:10:46.058\nFor this exam, I wanna make sure that we\nunderstand that Windows has scripting\n\n192\n00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:47.410\ncapabilities as well.\n\n193\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.790\nAnd it didnt start with PowerShell.\n\n194\n00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.351\nAlso understand that I can do this for\nthe command prompt, all right?\n\n195\n00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:58.581\nI can create a CMD or a BIN or a CFD or-\n&gt;&gt; .bat file.\n\n196\n00:10:58.581 --> 00:10:59.924\n&gt;&gt; .bat file, thank you.\n\n197\n00:10:59.924 --> 00:11:01.306\n.bat file, it's been so long.\n\n198\n00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:05.963\nI can take a text file put my command\nprompt commands in there, rename that file\n\n199\n00:11:05.963 --> 00:11:10.640\neither bad or CMD, and I can run it and\nit'll execute those commands, right.\n\n200\n00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.060\nSo scripting is not new to Windows but\n\n201\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.260\nWindows PowerShell is a much\nmore powerful language.\n\n202\n00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.440\n&gt;&gt; And Mike, help me out here I mean,\n\n203\n00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.020\nyou could go even farther\nwith security in PowerShell.\n\n204\n00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.090\nYou could do things like, for instance,\nrequiring that you have to have digital\n\n205\n00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:27.340\nsignatures on your scripts so that you\nknow they're coming from a trusted source,\n\n206\n00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.990\nI mean we could go even farther with the\nsecurity on these scripts too, can't we?\n\n207\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can definitely.\n\n208\n00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.210\nEven when we're working with\nscripts in our Windows environment,\n\n209\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.740\nyou've got like three or four policies.\n\n210\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.420\nThere's the run all scripts.\n\n211\n00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.020\nDon't run any scripts.\n\n212\n00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.930\nRun remote signed or I forget what\nthe other one is, local signed.\n\n213\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.110\nI'd have to go double-check on that one,\nbut there's a few different categories.\n\n214\n00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.630\nAnd what that does is says,\n\n215\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:56.340\nhey I won't run this script unless\nit is digitally signed, right.\n\n216\n00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.388\nSo that I can verify that\nwe trust this script.\n\n217\n00:11:59.388 --> 00:12:05.227\nIf you change your policy, which you\ncan do like if I open up PowerShell,\n\n218\n00:12:05.227 --> 00:12:07.760\nI go get-Policy, what is it?\n\n219\n00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.685\nGet-Policy?\n\n220\n00:12:08.685 --> 00:12:09.385\n&gt;&gt; Execution policy.\n\n221\n00:12:09.385 --> 00:12:13.252\n&gt;&gt; Execution policy, thank you.\n\n222\n00:12:13.252 --> 00:12:15.432\nWe can see that mine is remote signed.\n\n223\n00:12:15.432 --> 00:12:19.362\nSo local scripts that will run just fine,\nif it's remote like I'm reaching out to\n\n224\n00:12:19.362 --> 00:12:24.132\na shared folder it'll require\nthem to be signed, right,\n\n225\n00:12:24.132 --> 00:12:26.342\nif I'm going out across\nthe network to get them.\n\n226\n00:12:26.342 --> 00:12:30.303\nAnd you can do a set-execution\npolicy to change that.\n\n227\n00:12:30.303 --> 00:12:32.842\nI don't think they're gonna test you\non that but I do want to show you.\n\n228\n00:12:32.842 --> 00:12:35.270\nIn fact,\nlet's bump this font up a little bit too,\n\n229\n00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:39.720\nmake it a little bit bigger for\nus to see out there.\n\n230\n00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.320\nAll right, let's take a look at a couple\nof theses scripts that I have created.\n\n231\n00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.340\nLet's change over to my\ndesktop to make life easier.\n\n232\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:53.657\nAnd this is not Linux.\n\n233\n00:12:56.627 --> 00:12:59.628\nAnd it doesn't like that,\n\n234\n00:12:59.628 --> 00:13:04.594\nlet's try C:\\users\\Mike\\Desktop\\.\n\n235\n00:13:04.594 --> 00:13:07.945\nAll right, and\nthere's my files out there on my desktop.\n\n236\n00:13:07.945 --> 00:13:10.545\nAnd one of them's that FileInfo.ps1.\n\n237\n00:13:10.545 --> 00:13:17.465\nSo let's see if I can type\nFileInfo.ps1 and there\n\n238\n00:13:17.465 --> 00:13:22.965\nI can see my script and you can see this\nis a very simple two liner that I have.\n\n239\n00:13:22.965 --> 00:13:26.550\nAnother way that I can work with\nscripts and the way I love to do it\n\n240\n00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.980\nit's something known as\nthe integrated scripting environment,\n\n241\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.700\nas I right-clicked on my PowerShell icon,\nand that second option down,\n\n242\n00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.730\nRun ISE, or Run ISE as\nAdministrator is the second one.\n\n243\n00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.590\nISE is Integrated Scripting Environment,\nand it is fantastic, if you wanna\n\n244\n00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.880\nlearn how to work with scripts and\nPowerShell, this is what you use.\n\n245\n00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.130\nBecause you'll see what\nhappens when it loads up.\n\n246\n00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.860\nNow it might look like this by default\nwith just a standard PowerShell.\n\n247\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:58.160\nI can type in ipconfig,\nI can do get-net adapter.\n\n248\n00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.420\nBut notice when I'm doing PowerShell\ncommands, can you see that?\n\n249\n00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.390\nLet me zoom in a little bit for you there.\n\n250\n00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.830\nAs I'm typing the command it\ngrayed out when I zoomed in.\n\n251\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.609\nBut you can see this menu pop up.\n\n252\n00:14:07.609 --> 00:14:12.010\nAnd it showing me all the possible\ncommands that start with get-net.\n\n253\n00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.370\nSo as I type that list it get shorter and\nshorter, and I can either up or\n\n254\n00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.140\ndown arrow to get to the command,\nI can click on one, and\n\n255\n00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.650\nthen I can just tab to\nautofill that syntax.\n\n256\n00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.239\nSo as I'm learning scripting,\ngreat way to go.\n\n257\n00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:29.287\nAnother cool thing is over here, is every\nsingle, whoops, I didn't want do to that,\n\n258\n00:14:29.287 --> 00:14:33.380\nis every single command,\nlet's close that, open that guy up again.\n\n259\n00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.650\nThat's not what I wanted to do,\ngreat googly.\n\n260\n00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.220\nThere we go.\n\n261\n00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.080\nI was trying to see if I could\nget rid of this part here.\n\n262\n00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.440\nBut I don't know how to do that.\n\n263\n00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.790\nBut anyway, all of these commands here, as\nyou notice as you click on them it gives\n\n264\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.200\nyou some information about those commands.\n\n265\n00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.872\nAgain, we're not here to learn PowerShell,\nso let's [INAUDIBLE].\n\n266\n00:14:51.872 --> 00:14:55.360\nYou can see mine,\nprobably needs the help files updated.\n\n267\n00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.355\nWow, that let me, there you go, they let\nme actually fill in the parameters and\n\n268\n00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:01.440\nthen click and\ndrag out into my environment.\n\n269\n00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.670\nBut that's not what I wanted to show you.\n\n270\n00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.630\nUp here I'm not gonna\nbother changing my font,\n\n271\n00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.522\nbecause we're not staying\nin here very long.\n\n272\n00:15:07.522 --> 00:15:10.000\nI just wanted to show you,\nwhen you come into ISE,\n\n273\n00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.420\nyou hit this little button right here,\nit opens up this pane.\n\n274\n00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:21.830\nNormally when you type down in PowerShell,\nright, it executes that command.\n\n275\n00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.250\nIf I hit enter it's gonna\nexecute the command.\n\n276\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.990\nI can't get to the next\nline to write a script.\n\n277\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:32.268\nUp here, however, get-net adapter,\nagain, I can tab autofill,\n\n278\n00:15:32.268 --> 00:15:36.363\nI can hit line or my return and\nI can go to my next line and\n\n279\n00:15:36.363 --> 00:15:41.008\nwrite more commands and\nthen I can save this as a .ps1 file.\n\n280\n00:15:41.008 --> 00:15:47.014\nNow it is important in Windows to have the\nright extension, PowerShell scripts.ps1.\n\n281\n00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:48.688\nAll right, but I'm gonna close,\n\n282\n00:15:48.688 --> 00:15:52.390\nI'm gonna actually let's open that\nother script that I wrote for you guys.\n\n283\n00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:56.984\nWe'll open it up in here although\nwe didn't change my font.\n\n284\n00:15:56.984 --> 00:15:58.900\nSee if it'll just let me bump it up,\nthere we go.\n\n285\n00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.535\nAll right, so, here is my script,\nup in this top pane.\n\n286\n00:16:03.535 --> 00:16:05.679\nI'm not gonna save that one.\n\n287\n00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:10.688\nSo, all I have is $list = dir,\nwhich means that this is creating\n\n288\n00:16:10.688 --> 00:16:16.155\na variable in Powershell and\nI'm gonna store the results of a directory\n\n289\n00:16:16.155 --> 00:16:21.980\ncommand In this list per variable and\nten I want to do get item property.\n\n290\n00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.260\nAll of my PowerShell commands\nare verb-noun, so, get- and\n\n291\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.940\nthen what is it I want to get.\n\n292\n00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.150\nVerb is the Get,\nItemProperty is what I want.\n\n293\n00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:35.570\nAnd of each item, ooh,\nlet's do that in the list.\n\n294\n00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.520\nSo, it'll go through the list\nvariable one at a time cuz\n\n295\n00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.980\nthat directory should have multiple\nthings in it or potentially could.\n\n296\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.040\nIt'll go through one at a time and get\nthe properties for each item in that list.\n\n297\n00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.710\nAnd then, it's gonna create a format\nlist or it's gonna format it for\n\n298\n00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:55.690\nme in a list view, and\nthen I'm gonna outlfile to FileInfo.txt.\n\n299\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.177\nAnd what's cool about this is a great\nlittle script that I use a lot because if\n\n300\n00:16:59.177 --> 00:17:00.048\nI go to a machine and\n\n301\n00:17:00.048 --> 00:17:03.120\nI need to know information about\nthe files in a directory, right?\n\n302\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.150\nI can actually use this to\npullback some really good info\n\n303\n00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:11.120\nvery quickly about all of\nthe files in a directory.\n\n304\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.500\nSo, as you're doing your first responder,\nyour incident responder,\n\n305\n00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:20.050\nit's things like that, this is\na command you could definitely use.\n\n306\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.250\nSo, let's execute this guy.\n\n307\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.543\nI'm gonna drag this up just a bit, and\n\n308\n00:17:26.543 --> 00:17:30.040\nwe're gonna clear my screen.\n\n309\n00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.900\nAnd we're going to, let's change over to,\nnow, this one, the way I've got this\n\n310\n00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:41.800\ncommand written is it's going to look\nin the current directory and do a DIR.\n\n311\n00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.960\nSo, wherever I'm currently at, now,\nin system32, there's a lot of files.\n\n312\n00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.940\nSo, I really don't wanna run this\nwhile I'm in that directory.\n\n313\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.340\nSo, I'm gonna change up.\n\n314\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.178\nI copied here some random\nfiles over to my desktop,\n\n315\n00:17:52.178 --> 00:17:54.220\njust so we'd have something to look at.\n\n316\n00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.490\nSo, I'm gonna change over my desktop.\n\n317\n00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.770\ncd C:\\Windows, or not Windows.\n\n318\n00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:07.000\nSilly me, Users\\, I'm logged in as\nMike right now, switch Desktop.\n\n319\n00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.191\nAll right, and if I do a directory,\nyou'll see I've got a few files out there,\n\n320\n00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:12.710\nincluding this script.\n\n321\n00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:19.707\nSo, now that I'm at that location,\nI'm gonna call that script .\\FileInfo.ps1.\n\n322\n00:18:19.707 --> 00:18:22.052\nAll right, so, there I am.\n\n323\n00:18:22.052 --> 00:18:23.402\nTo call a PowerShell script,\n\n324\n00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:26.436\nvery similar to Bash,\nyou're just saying the name of the script.\n\n325\n00:18:26.436 --> 00:18:29.979\nIn this case, .\\, all right?\n\n326\n00:18:29.979 --> 00:18:30.807\nAnd I'll hit Enter.\n\n327\n00:18:32.918 --> 00:18:34.732\nAnd you know what, Mike,\n\n328\n00:18:34.732 --> 00:18:40.380\nyou're a silly kinda guys cuz this\nis not a backslash, there we go.\n\n329\n00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.218\nActually, you know what?\n\n330\n00:18:42.218 --> 00:18:44.640\nI think I could use\neither one in that case.\n\n331\n00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.660\nIt's so much fun going back and\nforth between Linux and Windows.\n\n332\n00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.240\nLet's take a look.\n\n333\n00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:54.288\nOn my desktop, do I have a file,\nyes I do, called fileinfo.txt.\n\n334\n00:18:54.288 --> 00:18:57.280\nRemember, that was\nthe output of my command.\n\n335\n00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.320\nWe take a look, and there we go.\n\n336\n00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:04.016\nIt tells you what directory you are in and\nI can see the name of the file,\n\n337\n00:19:04.016 --> 00:19:09.358\nthe length or the size, create, modified,\nwhat my permissions are on there.\n\n338\n00:19:09.358 --> 00:19:11.890\nYou can see a lot of information there.\n\n339\n00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.970\nAnd then the next file, all right?\n\n340\n00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.590\nSo, it's just going through each one and\npulling back information.\n\n341\n00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.131\nAgain, what this script is\ndoing is not part of this,\n\n342\n00:19:20.131 --> 00:19:21.942\nis not pertinent to what are the exam.\n\n343\n00:19:21.942 --> 00:19:24.730\nThey're not gonna test you\non what Mike's script did.\n\n344\n00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.630\nBut it's an example to show you the kinds\nof things that it can accomplish with\n\n345\n00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.700\na simple couple of lines in PowerShell.\n\n346\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.650\nIf I go and change directories to it,\nlet's go to another location.\n\n347\n00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.315\nLet's do, what would be a good example?\n\n348\n00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:47.060\nLet's do my, let's just go back to Mike.\n\n349\n00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.520\nLet's just cd.., to dump back up.\n\n350\n00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.090\nCuz here, I've got directories,\nright, instead of files.\n\n351\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.780\nWhat would happen if I\nran the script from here?\n\n352\n00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.290\nAll right, File.\n\n353\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:03.604\nNow, I'm not in that directory, so,\nI'm gonna have to do C:\\Users\\mike.\n\n354\n00:20:03.604 --> 00:20:06.190\nYou have to tell it where the script is,\nright?\n\n355\n00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.600\nIf you just take the name of\nthe script like you did to ./,\n\n356\n00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.930\nit's gonna look in the current directory.\n\n357\n00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.270\nI'm not in that directory anymore.\n\n358\n00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.280\nMy script's out of my desktop,\nbut I'm in my Mike directory.\n\n359\n00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.805\nSo, now,\nI've gotta point it to the script.\n\n360\n00:20:16.805 --> 00:20:18.470\nI gotta give it the entire path.\n\n361\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.722\nSo, Users\\mike\\Desktop, and\n\n362\n00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:26.538\nwhat is it, FileInfo.ps1?\n\n363\n00:20:26.538 --> 00:20:30.028\nAll right, and I didn't change\nthe name in the script, so,\n\n364\n00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:34.610\nit should of overwritten this file\nwith a new version of the file.\n\n365\n00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.690\nAnd sure enough, now,\n\n366\n00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.260\nwhen we look in here,\nI see information about my directories.\n\n367\n00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.880\nNames of the directories, when they were\ncreated, mode, link type and whether or\n\n368\n00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.530\nnot its the target.\n\n369\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.526\nSo, whether it's a file,\nwhether it's a directory.\n\n370\n00:20:47.526 --> 00:20:52.483\nAnd again, I want you to focus on what\nthe script was doing as much as how I was\n\n371\n00:20:52.483 --> 00:20:56.735\nable to take a command that I might\nuse frequently in the course of\n\n372\n00:20:56.735 --> 00:21:00.140\nan investigation and\nturn it into a script.\n\n373\n00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.090\nSomething that I can just run any time.\n\n374\n00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:04.740\nScripts are portable too.\n\n375\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.881\nWhat if I hire Wes, right,\nas part of our team and\n\n376\n00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:08.571\nhe needs to be able to do these things.\n\n377\n00:21:08.571 --> 00:21:11.930\nBut Wes is not a PowerShell\nscripting guru.\n\n378\n00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.790\nBut he needs to be able\nto get that information.\n\n379\n00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.300\nI can say, hey, Wes,\nhere's a great script.\n\n380\n00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.340\nPut it on your thumb drive, keep it with\nyou, run it when you need it, all right?\n\n381\n00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.170\nAnd now, he can run that.\n\n382\n00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.320\nI don't have to print out commands and\n\n383\n00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.970\nmake Wes try to type them in\nat some terminal somewhere.\n\n384\n00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.462\nHe can just run the script, right?\n\n385\n00:21:26.462 --> 00:21:29.460\nCuz with these scripts, you saw what I\ndid with a very simple, simple script.\n\n386\n00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.010\nWe can get very complex with the scripts.\n\n387\n00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.330\nThey can do incredibly powerful things.\n\n388\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.500\nSo, being able to encapsulate\nthose commands and\n\n389\n00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.210\nmake them portable is another big\nbenefit of using scripting languages.\n\n390\n00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.120\nWhether that's in Bash,\nwhether that's in PowerShell, or\n\n391\n00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.580\nany other scripting language\nthat you choose to use.\n\n392\n00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.487\nThere's many, many,\nmany of them out there that we can use.\n\n393\n00:21:51.487 --> 00:21:54.820\nAll right, Wes,\nlast thing I just wanna mention here\n\n394\n00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:58.760\nbefore we call this one\na show is log correlation.\n\n395\n00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.320\nThe concept of log correlation and\nwhat a SIEM system is.\n\n396\n00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.240\nSIEM, S-I-E-M, System Information and\n\n397\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.250\nEvent Management, and\nthe idea behind log correlation.\n\n398\n00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:15.020\nWhen we look at all the information we can\npull back from endpoints on our network,\n\n399\n00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.260\nour clients, our servers.\n\n400\n00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.930\nFrom the interconnectivity devices,\nrouters, and switches,\n\n401\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:25.950\nand firewalls, there is just a huge amount\nof information that needs to be processed,\n\n402\n00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.460\nwhat we call big data.\n\n403\n00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.330\nWe're pulling back information\nfrom log files and hundreds or\n\n404\n00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:35.430\nthousands of servers and\ndozens of access points and firewalls.\n\n405\n00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.380\nAnd I got to make sense of all this,\nright?\n\n406\n00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.180\nThat's where these SIEM\nsystems come into play.\n\n407\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.230\nThis is software that\nhelps me do just that.\n\n408\n00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:47.308\nTo pull all this information from\ndifferent sources, and then query it.\n\n409\n00:22:47.308 --> 00:22:51.191\nOr start looking at it in a meaningful\nway, making pie charts out of it,\n\n410\n00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:53.670\ndepending on the SIEM system you're using.\n\n411\n00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.140\nThere's open source ones like OSSIM.\n\n412\n00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.360\nThere's commercial\nproducts like AlienVault,\n\n413\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.430\nwhich is actually based on OSSIM.\n\n414\n00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:07.180\nThat's a huge, beautiful SIEM system that\n\n415\n00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.040\ngives you great looking graphs, and\npie charts, and just the kind of stuff you\n\n416\n00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.530\nwanna take to the sea levels when\nyou gotta go ask for more money.\n\n417\n00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.100\nWhy I'm doing all this security\nstuff to keep our network safe.\n\n418\n00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.070\nWell, look here's all our\nvulnerable machines and\n\n419\n00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.700\nthis is what we could do if we just spent,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n420\n00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.720\nBut SIEM systems, again, are for\nlog correlation and more.\n\n421\n00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.250\nAlso, understand the concept,\nwhen we're talking about log correlation.\n\n422\n00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.187\nTime synchronization is a very\nimportant thing within a network.\n\n423\n00:23:32.187 --> 00:23:36.850\nAnd when we're doing an analysis, we have\nto make sure we're on the same page.\n\n424\n00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:41.837\nIf I'm pulling a log file from a firewall\nand a log file from a web server that got\n\n425\n00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:45.391\ncompromised, and\nI wanna see the attack progress, and\n\n426\n00:23:45.391 --> 00:23:50.329\nalso the router maybe that it had to go\nthrough to get to my web server, right?\n\n427\n00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:52.830\nI need to pull the log files\nfrom all of those, and\n\n428\n00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.589\nI need to see this event\nprogress through my systems.\n\n429\n00:23:55.589 --> 00:23:58.651\nWhich means, I need to be on\nthe same page when it comes to time.\n\n430\n00:23:58.651 --> 00:24:03.165\nIf the time is off on the firewall and\nthe time stamps are off on the logs and\n\n431\n00:24:03.165 --> 00:24:06.569\non that firewall,\nhow am I gonna be able to see, okay so\n\n432\n00:24:06.569 --> 00:24:09.160\nat 8:05 my web-server was defaced.\n\n433\n00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.017\nSometime before 8:05, I should see some\nevents of some connection coming through\n\n434\n00:24:14.017 --> 00:24:17.420\nmy firewall,\nconnecting to that web server, right?\n\n435\n00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.776\nBut if the time stamps are off,\nit's not gonna do any good.\n\n436\n00:24:19.776 --> 00:24:23.063\nSo these seam systems help me,\nnot fixes issues like that,\n\n437\n00:24:23.063 --> 00:24:26.968\nthat still has to be correct, but\nit does help me correlate log files.\n\n438\n00:24:26.968 --> 00:24:32.253\nAnd I say this because we can do log\nfile correlation without software,\n\n439\n00:24:32.253 --> 00:24:35.438\nit's just a very tedious manual process.\n\n440\n00:24:35.438 --> 00:24:39.317\nBut I want you to make sure we\nrealize that time information,\n\n441\n00:24:39.317 --> 00:24:40.915\ntime synchronization,\n\n442\n00:24:40.915 --> 00:24:45.560\nis an important part of network security,\nbecause of this very fact.\n\n443\n00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.010\nBecause after the fact, when I'm going\nback and analyzing the information,\n\n444\n00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.630\nif everything is not synced up,\nit becomes very challenging if not\n\n445\n00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:58.690\nnear impossible to prove events\nwhere on this particular timeline,\n\n446\n00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:03.540\nif I can't show that the log files\nare on the same date and the same time.\n\n447\n00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.823\nIf I go to a judge or try to produce\nevidence and say here's the attack and\n\n448\n00:25:06.823 --> 00:25:07.829\nit says 8:05 PM.\n\n449\n00:25:07.829 --> 00:25:12.645\nAnd I say here's where they got into my\nfirewall about an hour before that and\n\n450\n00:25:12.645 --> 00:25:16.783\nit says 9:10 PM somebody's lying or\nthe log files are wrong,\n\n451\n00:25:16.783 --> 00:25:20.150\nand now that evidence is inadmissible.\n\n452\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:20.782\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike,\n\n453\n00:25:20.782 --> 00:25:23.184\nwell this has been a long journey\nwhen it comes to log analysis.\n\n454\n00:25:23.184 --> 00:25:26.668\nWe do appreciate you taking\nthe time to explain it, but\n\n455\n00:25:26.668 --> 00:25:30.170\nit looks like we're running\nout of time on that clock.\n\n456\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.020\nBut before we sign out Mike, you got\nany additional words that you might\n\n457\n00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.180\nwant to throw to the viewers\nwhen it comes to log analysis?\n\n458\n00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.171\n&gt;&gt; I would say yes to this one.\n\n459\n00:25:36.171 --> 00:25:41.309\nI know I don't normally, but I wanna\nmake sure you guys are paying attention\n\n460\n00:25:41.309 --> 00:25:46.622\nto using these filters and playing with\nthe find command and the grep command.\n\n461\n00:25:46.622 --> 00:25:52.146\nBecause it's one of the things that\nstuck out to me when I took this exam,\n\n462\n00:25:52.146 --> 00:25:57.325\nis they wanted to make sure you\nunderstood how those commands work.\n\n463\n00:25:57.325 --> 00:25:58.855\nSo do play around with those.\n\n464\n00:25:58.855 --> 00:26:01.795\nReally, the only way to get good\nat those is to try them out.\n\n465\n00:26:01.795 --> 00:26:06.870\nMake some files, grab some sample log\nfiles from some website on the internet,\n\n466\n00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.490\nor just make your own,\ngrab your own system log files.\n\n467\n00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:14.230\nPlay with find, play with grep,\nlearn how to filter those logs so\n\n468\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.280\nthat you can find\nthe pertinent information.\n\n469\n00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, words of wisdom from Mike.\n\n470\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.940\nTake heed out there everybody.\n\n471\n00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.930\nMike, as always, we do appreciate\nhaving you here in the studios, and\n\n472\n00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:24.060\nwe appreciate you, the viewer, watching.\n\n473\n00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.636\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n474\n00:26:26.636 --> 00:26:27.136\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n475\n00:26:27.136 -->

00:00:08.446\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:12.371\n&gt;&gt; You're watch ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:13.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.150\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.360\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.750\nin today's episode we are back with more\nof our CyberSec First Responder series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.860\nJoining us yet again, of course, would\nbe our good friend, Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n10\n00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.680\nMike, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.550\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.440\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.550\nI'm excited to be here and\nexcited for our topic today.\n\n14\n00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.100\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure you are.\n\n15\n00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.815\nI can tell.\n\n16\n00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:39.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because we're going\nto be doing regular expressions.\n\n17\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.650\nRegular expressions are very useful.\n\n18\n00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.680\nI don't wanna belittle their purpose or\nanything like that.\n\n19\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.220\nThey are good.\n\n20\n00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.420\nThey are frustrating sometimes.\n\n21\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.780\nBut then again computers can do that.\n\n22\n00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.570\nIt's just the nature of the beast.\n\n23\n00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.910\nBut, today we are going to be\nlooking at regular expressions.\n\n24\n00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.780\nAnd using regular expression to parse log\nfiles is what the objective is all about.\n\n25\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.850\nSo what that means is we need to\nunderstand what regular expressions\n\n26\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.180\nare and how we can use them to filter out\nlog files, look for particular things.\n\n27\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.110\nIf I'm looking for an IP address, I see\nan IP address in an event, and I need to\n\n28\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.100\nsee if there's any other events, you don't\nneed to parse that log file and find it.\n\n29\n00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.740\nI'm not gonna scroll line by line\nlooking for that IP address.\n\n30\n00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.860\nI can use something like a regular\nexpression to filter that log and\n\n31\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.810\nfind every line that has\nthat IP address in it.\n\n32\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.180\nOr if you know the name of some\nmalicious file that's been going around,\n\n33\n00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.540\nthat's infecting machines.\n\n34\n00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.620\nAnd we can look for log file entries\nthat have that file name in it,\n\n35\n00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.800\nor strings that malicious code\noutputs as part of its process.\n\n36\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.350\nWe can look for that kind of thing.\n\n37\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.090\nThey're extremely powerful,\nthe issues you'll run into with regular\n\n38\n00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.690\nexpressions are one,\nthere's a lot of shortcuts to them.\n\n39\n00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.810\nAnd there's not a lot,\nthere are some inconsistencies\n\n40\n00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.860\nbetween the different engines that\nyou're using for regular expressions.\n\n41\n00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.713\nIn other words,\nwhat might work here on your Ubuntu Linux\n\n42\n00:02:04.713 --> 00:02:08.400\ndistribution might not work somewhere else\n\n43\n00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.140\nwhere you're using that regular\nexpression, the same syntax you're using.\n\n44\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.670\nYou have to change it up because\nyou've got basic regular expressions,\n\n45\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.750\nextended regular expressions.\n\n46\n00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.060\nYou've got PEARL specific, You've got PHP.\n\n47\n00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.870\nYou've got JAVA.\n\n48\n00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.230\nI mean, there's lots of different\nI wanna call them engines for\n\n49\n00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.740\nlack of a better term there that\nwork with these regular expressions.\n\n50\n00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.000\nBut there are some things that\nare good throughout all of them.\n\n51\n00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.010\nAnd really the thing you do is play,\nget in there, practice with this.\n\n52\n00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.375\nIt's the only way a way\nto get better at it.\n\n53\n00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:41.195\nStart memorizing some of the switches and\nthings that you can use.\n\n54\n00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:42.425\n&gt;&gt; Cheat sheets.\n\n55\n00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:44.035\n&gt;&gt; Cheat sheets are fantastic.\n\n56\n00:02:44.035 --> 00:02:47.295\nEverybody, if you're gonna use these\nI guarantee anybody that does this on\n\n57\n00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:51.205\na regular basis has one of those cheat\nsheets taped to their cubicle wall or\n\n58\n00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:54.995\nwherever so they can quickly look and\nsee what was it if I wanted to look for\n\n59\n00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:56.650\na control character.\n\n60\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.990\nYeah, it's a 4/c that's gonna do that for\nme or something like that, so.\n\n61\n00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.580\n&gt;&gt; It'd be funny to make a file of regular\nexpression cheat sheets that you use\n\n62\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.886\nregular expression to grep through.\n\n63\n00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:08.265\n[LAUGH] Finding exactly\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n64\n00:03:08.265 --> 00:03:11.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Use a regular expression\nto find the regular expression\n\n65\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.560\nthat I want to use, yeah.\n\n66\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.890\nSo we could work on that,\ncould be our next project.\n\n67\n00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.980\nSo that's what we're here to talk\nabout today, and you know with\n\n68\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.910\nregular expressions, as I said, they're,\nthe whole idea is we're pattern matching.\n\n69\n00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.180\nThat's all we're doing,\nis we're matching patterns.\n\n70\n00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.900\nRight?\nWhen we think about a log file, or\n\n71\n00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.820\nany file, or any bit of data on\na computer, it's a series of characters.\n\n72\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.700\nIt's letters or numbers or\nspecial characters or white spaces or\n\n73\n00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.910\ncontrol character.\n\n74\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.920\nNonprintable characters,\nreturn characters, things like that.\n\n75\n00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.440\nAnd what we're going to do is, we're going\nto look for a pattern in those characters.\n\n76\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.340\nNow that pattern might be '1-2-3', or\n'a-b-c' or the word 'malware.' right?\n\n77\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.850\nThat's a pattern.\n\n78\n00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.780\nWait, how is malware a pattern.\n\n79\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.030\nWell the pattern is, there's a little 'm'\nand then an 'a' and then an 'l' right?\n\n80\n00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.540\nAnd I'm going to look for\nthat pattern throughout the log files.\n\n81\n00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.690\nIs there anywhere else that I can\nfind an 'm', followed by an 'a',\n\n82\n00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.320\nfollowed by an 'l', followed by a 'w' and\nso on and so forth, right.\n\n83\n00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.020\nSo when I say pattern, I don't want you to\nthink of the pattern is like four M's or\n\n84\n00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.730\nanything like that or dot dot slash dot\ndot slash, it's anything is a pattern.\n\n85\n00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.875\nWe're just gonna say this is what we're\nlooking for, now let's go find it.\n\n86\n00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:22.115\nSomewhere else in this file, if it exists.\n\n87\n00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:22.875\nRight?\n\n88\n00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:25.415\nSo we can use this for\ndifferent types of searches.\n\n89\n00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:30.165\nWe can do keyword searches,\nlike for malware, for example.\n\n90\n00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:30.875\nI use that example.\n\n91\n00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:33.080\nIt's very doubtful we're\nactually gonna look for\n\n92\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.140\nthe word malware in there but-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, typically,\n\n93\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.960\nyou're probably gonna be looking for\nwords like success or failure.\n\n94\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.810\nEspecially, when it comes to log files.\n\n95\n00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or login denied,\nthings like that.\n\n96\n00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.690\nIP address searches.\n\n97\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.610\nAs I earlier, you might have\nan entry on our log file that\n\n98\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.220\nshows a particular IP address doing\nsomething it shouldn't be doing.\n\n99\n00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.420\nAnd you wanna search through other\nlog files for that IP address, or\n\n100\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.110\nIP address ranges, or\njust valid IP addresses.\n\n101\n00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.461\nSpecial character searches could be done,\nI'm looking for @ symbols.\n\n102\n00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:09.420\nAnd it's not just parsing log files,\n\n103\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.700\neven though that's really\nwhat we're dealing with here.\n\n104\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.070\nWe can use these when we\nare filtering input in an Html form.\n\n105\n00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.440\nSeeing if they've in-putted\na valid email address.\n\n106\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.600\nMaybe not valid, proper format at least.\n\n107\n00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.615\nString of characters, an @ symbol,\nsome more characters, a period and\n\n108\n00:05:28.615 --> 00:05:31.596\nthen 3-4 characters after that for\nthe extension or\n\n109\n00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:36.320\n2-4 after that whatever the case may\nbe depending on what we're looking for.\n\n110\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.880\nPort number searches is really just\nabout anything you want to do.\n\n111\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.100\nSo what we need to do in order to be able\nto work with these regular expressions.\n\n112\n00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.620\nWe're gonna do some examples,\nI'm gonna pull up a machine and\n\n113\n00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.530\nwe'll do some searching through there and\nshow you what happens.\n\n114\n00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.460\nBut first I want to go through logical\noperations list of characters or\n\n115\n00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.212\noperators that they want us\nto be familiar with them.\n\n116\n00:05:58.212 --> 00:06:01.180\nAnd we'll talk about each one they\ngot some great I just grabbed\n\n117\n00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.260\ntheir images were gonna show\nyou the descriptions and\n\n118\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.810\nsome examples and\nthen we'll do some for real.\n\n119\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.720\nMaybe at the end of this or\n\n120\n00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.420\nin the next episode well take\na look at actually doing some.\n\n121\n00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.810\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n122\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.540\nAnd we'll start off looking at,\nmake sure I'm on the first one there.\n\n123\n00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.600\nWe'll zoom in just a wee bit for you.\n\n124\n00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.190\nAnd so, this is,\nlet's just start at the beginning.\n\n125\n00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.010\nWe got the asterisk, right?\n\n126\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.850\nOr the splat,\ndepending on what you wanna call that.\n\n127\n00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.600\nMatches zero or more instances of\nthe preceeding character Right.\n\n128\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:39.040\nSo in the example over there to the right,\nit says, 105* matches the 10 and 104.\n\n129\n00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.741\nThe 105 and 1052 and the 1055 and 1055.\n\n130\n00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:46.880\nSo let's decipher that.\n\n131\n00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.712\nMatches 0 or more instances\nof the preceding characters.\n\n132\n00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:55.321\nHow does it match the 10 in 104?\n\n133\n00:06:55.321 --> 00:06:57.150\nBecause there are zero instances of five.\n\n134\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n135\n00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.530\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n136\n00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.850\nIt's kind of odd to think about it\nthat way, but the asterisk is zero or\n\n137\n00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.410\nmore instances.\n\n138\n00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.240\nSo, it does match 104.\n\n139\n00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.900\nAnd this is where regular expressions can\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n140\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.350\nthe brain starts cramping\n&gt;&gt; It's like,why,\n\n141\n00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.360\nwhy did 104 come back in my result\nwhen I was searching for 105 asterisk.\n\n142\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.860\n&gt;&gt; Like why would I want to look for\none zero,\n\n143\n00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.420\nI mean that's a really\nspecialized search string.\n\n144\n00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.930\nRight?\n\n145\n00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.620\nThat I am looking for\none zero and than then anything.\n\n146\n00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.800\nAlso I want to look for 105 anything.\n\n147\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n148\n00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.560\n&gt;&gt; It's very strange.\n\n149\n00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.530\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's odd.\n\n150\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.080\nBut there are some times when\nyou might wanna use this.\n\n151\n00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.940\nAnd I'll show you an example of\nhow it works in a little bit.\n\n152\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.260\nBut the key here is to remember, this\nis what you're gonna have to remember,\n\n153\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.510\nbetween these three first characters,\nthe splat.\n\n154\n00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.830\nFor the asterisk,\nthe question mark and the plus.\n\n155\n00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:54.961\nThe asterisk is 0 or more instances,\nthe question mark is 0 or 1 instance.\n\n156\n00:07:54.961 --> 00:07:58.348\nSo either none of them or\none but not more than one.\n\n157\n00:07:58.348 --> 00:08:02.996\nAll right, look at the example here,\n105?, still matches the 104,\n\n158\n00:08:02.996 --> 00:08:06.440\nbecause that's 0 of\nthe preceding character, right.\n\n159\n00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.340\nThe preceding character's the 5.\n\n160\n00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.453\nAnother thing we've gotta\nbe careful with here.\n\n161\n00:08:10.453 --> 00:08:12.751\nNotice, it's only look at the 5.\n\n162\n00:08:12.751 --> 00:08:16.820\nIt's not looking at, within our brain,\nwe wanna think you're looking for 105.\n\n163\n00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.630\n&gt;&gt; There's one instance of 1 0,\nthen the 5 is the variable.\n\n164\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.890\nI can have zero instances of the 5,\nI can have one instance of the 5\n\n165\n00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.360\nIf we're using the question mark,\nthat'd be the end of that.\n\n166\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.656\nIf we're using the splat,\nit would be at least,\n\n167\n00:08:28.656 --> 00:08:32.692\nor zero instances of five, one instance of\nfive, or multiple instances of the five.\n\n168\n00:08:32.692 --> 00:08:36.471\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, and\nthat's what you've got to remember is,\n\n169\n00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:40.770\nthe operator is only operating On\nthe single character in front of it-\n\n170\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.290\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to sit down.\n\n171\n00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.488\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not the whole string.\n\n172\n00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:43.791\n&gt;&gt; It's time to sit.\n\n173\n00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:45.075\nThere's a lot of thinking.\n\n174\n00:08:45.075 --> 00:08:48.031\n&gt;&gt; It is, which is why,\nagain, it matches 104.\n\n175\n00:08:48.031 --> 00:08:51.498\nCuz it's saying there has to be a one,\nthere has to be a zero, but\n\n176\n00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:54.360\nthen there might or might not be a five.\n\n177\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.539\nRight so the 1 and 0 are already set and\n\n178\n00:08:56.539 --> 00:09:00.910\nthat's why the 104 ends up matching is\ncuz there is the 1, there is the 0.\n\n179\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.584\nAnd then this other item might not be a 5.\n\n180\n00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.907\nWell there's not, it matches.\n\n181\n00:09:04.907 --> 00:09:10.589\nBut it wouldn't match 1055 cuz that\nwould be more than 1 and this is 0 or 1.\n\n182\n00:09:10.589 --> 00:09:13.930\nAnd then the plus matches 1 or more.\n\n183\n00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.880\nSo in this case notice the 104 no\nlonger shows up in my example.\n\n184\n00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.340\nBecause now I'm saying there\nhas to be at least one.\n\n185\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.950\nWhereas these two, it was zero or\nmore, zero or one.\n\n186\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.470\nNow, I'm saying one or more.\n\n187\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.880\nSo it has to be at least one,\nfive and there could be more than 1,\n\n188\n00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.245\n5 like in 1055, all right So those, those\noperators there we use those all the time.\n\n189\n00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:36.423\nThose are very common operators.\n\n190\n00:09:36.423 --> 00:09:41.565\nThe { } within inner number just\n\n191\n00:09:41.565 --> 00:09:46.465\na variable inside they're matches only\nin instances of the preceding character.\n\n192\n00:09:46.465 --> 00:09:48.885\nSo in this case we're saying 105, and\n\n193\n00:09:48.885 --> 00:09:53.110\nthen in curly braces, 3, and\nthen end your curly brace.\n\n194\n00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.100\nSo now I'm saying there has to be a one,\nthere has to be a zero,\n\n195\n00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.880\nand that's gonna be\nfollowed by three fives.\n\n196\n00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.940\nNow I could've actually written one zero,\nfive, five, five, right, and\n\n197\n00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.490\njust matched the pattern that way.\n\n198\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.255\nBut in this case it's just a shorthand,\nsort of a shorthand way.\n\n199\n00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:14.676\nIt's a way that I can\neasily modifiable as well,\n\n200\n00:10:14.676 --> 00:10:18.060\nusing that brace system there I guess.\n\n201\n00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.395\nAnd then there's the end, comma,\n\n202\n00:10:20.395 --> 00:10:25.405\nwhich matches at least in instances\nof the preceding character.\n\n203\n00:10:25.405 --> 00:10:32.165\nSo I can see instead of only in instances\nat least in instances so now I'm saying\n\n204\n00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:36.065\nthere has to be at least 1, there could be\n2, there could be 3, there could be 23.\n\n205\n00:10:36.065 --> 00:10:40.315\nBut it has to be at least 1 cause\nthe 1 is inside the curly braces.\n\n206\n00:10:40.315 --> 00:10:44.225\nSo 105 { 1, }.\n\n207\n00:10:44.225 --> 00:10:47.375\nSays 105 would match, 1055 would match,\n\n208\n00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:51.801\n105555 would match,\n10555555 would match, right?\n\n209\n00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:55.287\nBut as long as there's at least\none five after the one zero.\n\n210\n00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:59.710\nAnd then you've got the n comma m\noption down here at the bottom.\n\n211\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:04.970\nSo now we're talking between n and\nm instance fo the preceding character.\n\n212\n00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.120\nSo with the n,\n\n213\n00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.390\nI am saying here is the minimum number\nof instances that should occur.\n\n214\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.600\nWith just the n I'm telling you\nthis is exactly how many instances.\n\n215\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.390\nWith the n,m now I'm saying there is gonna\nbe at least as many Up to this many.\n\n216\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.010\nAnd it is inclusive.\n\n217\n00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:26.610\nSo that would include, like if I do a 1,3,\nlike in our example on the right,\n\n218\n00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.340\n1 is included.\n\n219\n00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.508\nSo 105 does match, cuz there's one 5.\n\n220\n00:11:31.508 --> 00:11:34.774\n10555 matches, cuz there are three.\n\n221\n00:11:34.774 --> 00:11:40.360\n105555, If there were 4 5s,\nthat would not match.\n\n222\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:45.171\nBecause I'm saying it has to be 1,\n2, or 3 instances of the 5.\n\n223\n00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:47.480\nBut they are inclusive,\nthey're not exclusive.\n\n224\n00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:54.542\nIf it was exclusive it would only\nmatch 2 of the 5s, and not a 1 or a 3.\n\n225\n00:11:54.542 --> 00:11:57.507\nSo there's a few of them,\nbut there are more.\n\n226\n00:11:57.507 --> 00:12:01.387\n&gt;&gt; We can throw a little water on the fire\nthat's smoking out of your brains,\n\n227\n00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:02.019\nright now.\n\n228\n00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:08.670\nI always tell Mike this is the one thing\nif I could never have to do, I wouldn't.\n\n229\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.409\nBut there are times when\nyou just have to do it.\n\n230\n00:12:10.409 --> 00:12:12.530\nParsing log file, you're gonna do this.\n\n231\n00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.770\nIf you're looking through\na large text file,\n\n232\n00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.820\nyou're gonna be using\nsome regular expression.\n\n233\n00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.190\nI use it inside of some,\ncreating scripts so\n\n234\n00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.850\nthat I can catch, do a catch all kind\nof thing and it's very handy there.\n\n235\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.600\nBut just can't away from it.\n\n236\n00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.080\n&gt;&gt; Or searching through play when you're\nusing the search point, looking for\n\n237\n00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:35.090\na particular exploit and I need one for\nApache But I need version 2.4 or less.\n\n238\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.606\nBecause anything later than that has\nbeen patched against that exploit.\n\n239\n00:12:37.606 --> 00:12:38.632\nIf you search through that,\n\n240\n00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:40.780\nregular expressions are gonna\nhelp you find that, right?\n\n241\n00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.390\nSo you do use them.\n\n242\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.259\nIn this one,\nI've got a couple operators here.\n\n243\n00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:46.941\nI've got the ^, is the first one,\n\n244\n00:12:46.941 --> 00:12:52.220\nmatches the position at the beginning\nof the following string.\n\n245\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.964\nSo this is one where the character or the\ncaret in this case, goes in front of the,\n\n246\n00:12:55.964 --> 00:12:58.460\nyeah in front of the string\nthat you're looking for.\n\n247\n00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.660\nSo caret 105 does not match 2105,\n\n248\n00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:09.506\nbecause what I'm saying is it\nneeds to start with 105 all right.\n\n249\n00:13:09.506 --> 00:13:11.789\nIt could be anything after that, but\n\n250\n00:13:11.789 --> 00:13:15.039\nthe 105 has to come at\nthe beginning of the match.\n\n251\n00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:20.090\nAnd that 2 out in front Is\nwhy this one doesn't match.\n\n252\n00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.157\nThe dollar sign is just the opposite,\n\n253\n00:13:22.157 --> 00:13:25.458\nnow you're saying I want to match\nthis at the end of a string.\n\n254\n00:13:25.458 --> 00:13:32.993\nSo 105$ does not match 1052, because 105\nis not at the end of that string, right?\n\n255\n00:13:32.993 --> 00:13:37.420\nThere's a 2 following the 105,\nso it's not going to count.\n\n256\n00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:43.428\nAnd again, we use this a lot,\nas well, especially with words.\n\n257\n00:13:43.428 --> 00:13:49.844\nBecause if I'm looking for,\nwhat would be an example.\n\n258\n00:13:49.844 --> 00:13:57.014\nLet's use one like, cranky, I can't think\none off the top of my head, fail, right?\n\n259\n00:13:57.014 --> 00:14:03.050\nIf I do fail$, that would not\nmatch failed or failure, right?\n\n260\n00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:07.023\nBecause fail has to be the end of it, so\nthe particular log entry I'm looking for\n\n261\n00:14:07.023 --> 00:14:08.226\nhad the word fail in it.\n\n262\n00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:12.983\nBut if I just do fail without the dollar\nsign, it would match failure, failed,\n\n263\n00:14:12.983 --> 00:14:17.670\nin-failed no, I can't think of anything\nelse that has fail at the middle of it\n\n264\n00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.372\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n265\n00:14:18.372 --> 00:14:20.127\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It would match anything like that if I\n\n266\n00:14:20.127 --> 00:14:22.940\nput the dollar sign there now I'm saying\n&gt;&gt; Failed and\n\n267\n00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.330\nthen nothing after it, right?\n\n268\n00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:30.010\nSo, again, these are ones we'll use quite\noften in our expressions as we build more\n\n269\n00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.090\ncomplex expressions.\n\n270\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.569\nThen we've got some more operators here.\n\n271\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.820\nLet me zoom back one more there.\n\n272\n00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.730\nI've got my open bracket and\nclosed bracket, right.\n\n273\n00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.510\nThe square ones, without the shift\non your keyboard typically matches\n\n274\n00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:51.740\nany character within the set,\nthe set is contained in the brackets.\n\n275\n00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.260\nSo the open close brackets\nare where I can create a set.\n\n276\n00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.845\nAnd then, will look for\na match from within that set.\n\n277\n00:14:59.845 --> 00:15:02.960\nIt's really a way to kind of\nlimit what we're looking for.\n\n278\n00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.896\nLike here they've got,\n{ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 },\n\n279\n00:15:07.896 --> 00:15:11.689\nmatches every character in the 1055.\n\n280\n00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:12.860\nThat's a horrible example.\n\n281\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.200\nLikewise, abcdef matches the e and\nthe c in security.\n\n282\n00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.230\nThis will be a little bit easier\nI think when I actually show you,\n\n283\n00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.560\ncoming up we'll go through some exercises.\n\n284\n00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.388\nBut what I'm basically saying is\nanything inside that brackets,\n\n285\n00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:31.657\nthat's a single character.\n\n286\n00:15:31.657 --> 00:15:36.530\nNow that character could be 0, 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9, right?\n\n287\n00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.911\nCould be any one of those, but\nthat's what I'm looking for is that,\n\n288\n00:15:39.911 --> 00:15:42.320\na character that exist within this set,\nright?\n\n289\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:48.096\nIf this was [0123] it would match a 0,\n\n290\n00:15:48.096 --> 00:15:52.960\n1, 2 or 3, it would not match a 4.\n\n291\n00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.497\nRight?\n\n292\n00:15:53.497 --> 00:15:56.970\nBecause four is not within my set,\nso I've been able to limit.\n\n293\n00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.560\nThat's why I said doing 0-9,\nyou're saying any digit.\n\n294\n00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.350\nAnd there's other ways I can say that,\nbut this is one way to do that.\n\n295\n00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.496\nSame thing when they do a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\n296\n00:16:06.496 --> 00:16:10.800\nThe e matches because it's in that set,\nthe c matches because it's in that set.\n\n297\n00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.540\nIt wouldn't match the S in security\ncuz the S is not in that set, right.\n\n298\n00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.520\nBut it's a little bit confusing the way\nthey've got that example written up,\n\n299\n00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.500\nbecause you would use that open A,\nB, C, D,\n\n300\n00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.680\nE, F, close to find one character, right.\n\n301\n00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.720\nAnd then you'd have another open bracket\nset closed, define the second character.\n\n302\n00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.270\nAnd again I'll show you\nhere in a little bit.\n\n303\n00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.103\nIf the characters I'm trying to\ndo in the set are sequential,\n\n304\n00:16:36.103 --> 00:16:40.410\nI can shorten it up a little bit using an\noperator known as the hyphen or the dash,\n\n305\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.944\nmatches a range of\ncharacters within the set.\n\n306\n00:16:42.944 --> 00:16:45.810\nSo it's used within the brackets,\nall right.\n\n307\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:50.321\nBut it's a way of saying,\ninstead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\n\n308\n00:16:50.321 --> 00:16:53.690\n8, 9 I guess a open\nbracket 0-9 close bracket.\n\n309\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:59.434\nThat would be the exact same thing as\nwriting out this one in the example above.\n\n310\n00:16:59.434 --> 00:17:06.400\nA through f or a-f is the same as\nthe abcdef within the braces, right.\n\n311\n00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.889\nJust a shortcut for writing it out.\n\n312\n00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.320\nAnd then you've got the caret.\n\n313\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.440\nWait a second, Mike,\ndidn't you show us the caret earlier?\n\n314\n00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.250\nYou said that matches\nthe beginning of the word.\n\n315\n00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.580\nWell it does,\nuntil you put it inside brackets.\n\n316\n00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:26.330\nOnce you put it inside brackets,\nit becomes the negator or the negative or\n\n317\n00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:31.460\nthe not character so I can say not 0123.\n\n318\n00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.760\nIt would match the five, but\nit wouldn't match the one or\n\n319\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.240\nthe zero, because it's saying not 0,\n1, 2 or 3.\n\n320\n00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.840\nRemember, sometimes it's easier to say\nwhat it shouldn't be than what it is.\n\n321\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.560\nIf the list of what it is really,\nreally long.\n\n322\n00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.130\nBut the list of what it shouldn't\nbe is a little bit shorter,\n\n323\n00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.640\nthat might be easier to write.\n\n324\n00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.850\nOr sometimes I know what it shouldn't be,\nit could be anything else.\n\n325\n00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.000\nAnd I can't list out every possibility,\nbut\n\n326\n00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.290\nI can tell you what it can't be, right?\n\n327\n00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.635\nLike in my field I know you can\nput in just about anything.\n\n328\n00:17:59.635 --> 00:18:03.515\nBut what you can't put in is an @ symbol,\nright?\n\n329\n00:18:03.515 --> 00:18:08.295\nSo I can much easier say not @ than\ntry to list everything else you might\n\n330\n00:18:09.435 --> 00:18:10.775\nput in there.\n\n331\n00:18:10.775 --> 00:18:13.615\nSo that's how I can negate those.\n\n332\n00:18:13.615 --> 00:18:15.575\nLet's see,\nI like the way they wrote this out.\n\n333\n00:18:15.575 --> 00:18:21.740\nSo not a through f would match the s,\nthe u, the r, the i, and the t and the y.\n\n334\n00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:27.212\nEverything but the e and the c,\nbecause those fall within that range.\n\n335\n00:18:27.212 --> 00:18:31.097\nAll right, next is the dot, the period,\n\n336\n00:18:31.097 --> 00:18:38.660\nwhatever you want to call that one matches\nany character except for line breaks.\n\n337\n00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.750\n&gt;&gt; A true wildcard.\n\n338\n00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.830\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n339\n00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.690\nAnd this is where, again,\na little bit tricky.\n\n340\n00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:46.000\nWe're used to thinking about the asterisk\nor the splat as the wild card.\n\n341\n00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.420\nRemember, that's not the wild\ncard in regular expressions.\n\n342\n00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.106\nIt is on purpose just to make us confused.\n\n343\n00:18:52.106 --> 00:18:53.626\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hey,\n\n344\n00:18:53.626 --> 00:18:56.640\nwhat does everybody\nthinks the wild card is?\n\n345\n00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.680\nLet's not use that one.\n\n346\n00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.179\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n347\n00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:01.007\n&gt;&gt; God forbid you come from any kind of\n\n348\n00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:03.922\nWindows background where\nthe asterisk is a wild card.\n\n349\n00:19:03.922 --> 00:19:06.075\nYou're really going to have\na hard time with this.\n\n350\n00:19:06.075 --> 00:19:07.795\n&gt;&gt; So much fun.\n\n351\n00:19:07.795 --> 00:19:09.095\nSo the dot is the wild card.\n\n352\n00:19:09.095 --> 00:19:12.876\nSo in this case, in their example,\nthey've got 105 dot,\n\n353\n00:19:12.876 --> 00:19:16.892\nwould match 105, 5, 105,\n6, 105, 7, and so on.\n\n354\n00:19:16.892 --> 00:19:19.800\nCuz it's saying basically,\nthere has to be a 1.\n\n355\n00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.170\nThere has to be a zero.\n\n356\n00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.778\nThere has to be a five.\n\n357\n00:19:22.778 --> 00:19:24.650\nAnd then there has to be something else,\nbut\n\n358\n00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.835\ntheir not telling you what\nthat something else is.\n\n359\n00:19:26.835 --> 00:19:32.520\nIt could be a five,\nit could be a one, it could an A.\n\n360\n00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.640\nRight, it could be anything except for\na line breaker.\n\n361\n00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.360\nIt could be a question mark.\n\n362\n00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.080\nIt is the truly and\nlike Daniel says, the wildcard.\n\n363\n00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.360\nThen there's the open and\nclose parenthesis.\n\n364\n00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:50.710\nAnd these are gonna define subexpressions\nwith the pattern inside parenthesis.\n\n365\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:55.240\nSo we'll use the parenthesis to\nbasically do grouping, right.\n\n366\n00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.830\nJust like we do with math.\n\n367\n00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.760\nIf we say okay, we want to do 2 plus 4,\ntimes six plus eight, and\n\n368\n00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.130\nwe'll put the 2 plus 4 inside parentheses,\nif we want that operation to happen first.\n\n369\n00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.740\nIf we want to alter the,\nPlease Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,\n\n370\n00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:14.030\nthing, the PEMDAS, we can use\nparentheses to change that order.\n\n371\n00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.540\nIt's kind of the same thing here.\n\n372\n00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.030\nAnything within the parentheses\nis considered a single operation.\n\n373\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.820\nSo, it's a way to group things together.\n\n374\n00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.270\nIf we go beyond the scope\nof this particular exam\n\n375\n00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.400\nwe start getting into grouping and\nregular expressions.\n\n376\n00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.492\nAnd actually anything within a group is\nwhat they call captured and then it gets\n\n377\n00:20:30.492 --> 00:20:34.898\nloaded into memory and then I can actually\ngo back and fire off queries against that.\n\n378\n00:20:34.898 --> 00:20:40.309\nBut that's way beyond what is that back\nsearching I forget the term for that.\n\n379\n00:20:40.309 --> 00:20:44.091\nBut we're not going to get\ninto that part just yet.\n\n380\n00:20:44.091 --> 00:20:49.238\nSo in this case in their example they\ngot open parentheses, open bracket,\n\n381\n00:20:49.238 --> 00:20:54.058\n0-9 close bracket, abcd,\nclose parentheses, open brace, 2,\n\n382\n00:20:54.058 --> 00:20:59.800\nclose brace, would match 5 abc 5 abc\nwithout the parentheses it matches 5 abcc.\n\n383\n00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.531\nAll right, let's look at that.\n\n384\n00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:07.960\nSo what we're saying is it could be 0-9,\n\n385\n00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.964\nso any number 0-9, followed by abc.\n\n386\n00:21:12.964 --> 00:21:15.642\nAnd then we've got the closed parentheses,\nand\n\n387\n00:21:15.642 --> 00:21:18.260\nthey were saying two\ninstances of that in a row.\n\n388\n00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.410\nSo that's why I say 5abc5abc.\n\n389\n00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.490\nIf I take the parentheses out, well,\n\n390\n00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:30.570\nnow the {2} bumps up against the c,\nthe letter c.\n\n391\n00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.180\nAnd remember when we do\noperators it's operating against\n\n392\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.440\nthe string in front of it\nnot the entire string.\n\n393\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.970\nThen you'd be saying,\nhey I'll match any number.\n\n394\n00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:43.330\nabc, but there's gotta be two c's,\nall right?\n\n395\n00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:48.880\nSo the parenthesis is what\nmoves that brace two out,\n\n396\n00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.180\nand says no, no, two of this whole thing.\n\n397\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.160\nNot two of just the letter c, right?\n\n398\n00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.520\nSo that's how we can use those\nparentheses within our patterns.\n\n399\n00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.960\nTo control the way it's operating that.\n\n400\n00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.610\nThen you got the pipe symbol,\n\n401\n00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.340\nthat's usually the Shift+Backslash\non your keyboard.\n\n402\n00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.330\nThat is the OR\nlogical operator that matches\n\n403\n00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.650\nthe preceding string or\nthe following string.\n\n404\n00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:25.310\nSo I'm saying 105 OR abc matches\nthe 105 in 1055 and the abc in abcdef.\n\n405\n00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.733\nSo it's an OR.\n\n406\n00:22:29.733 --> 00:22:32.572\nWhen you are reading it to yourself,\njust reading an OR there.\n\n407\n00:22:32.572 --> 00:22:34.875\nSo I might look for a log files,\n\n408\n00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:40.206\nI wanna say is there any entries that\nhave to do with DHCP or DNS, right.\n\n409\n00:22:40.206 --> 00:22:47.526\nI put DHCP pipe DNS and\nthat will be read as DHCP or DNS.\n\n410\n00:22:47.526 --> 00:22:49.655\nAll right?\n\n411\n00:22:49.655 --> 00:22:51.469\nWe use that a lot.\n\n412\n00:22:51.469 --> 00:22:55.083\nThe back slash, denotes the following\ncharacter as a special character or\n\n413\n00:22:55.083 --> 00:22:56.560\na literal character.\n\n414\n00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.460\nA literal character is used to\nescape a search operator, all right?\n\n415\n00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.490\nThis one is a little bit tricky sometimes,\nbecause there's a dual meaning there.\n\n416\n00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.300\nIt's follow, [LAUGH] I like the way,\nit says denotes the following character\n\n417\n00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.180\nas a special character or\na literal character.\n\n418\n00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.530\nWhich one is it?\n\n419\n00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.230\nIt does one or the other doesn't it?\n\n420\n00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.070\nCome on tell me what you mean here.\n\n421\n00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.680\nIt really depends on what the character\nis before you put the backslash in\n\n422\n00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.580\nfront of it.\n\n423\n00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:25.210\nIs sometimes used to denote the following\ncharacter as a special character like in\n\n424\n00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.610\nthe \\W.\n\n425\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.347\nWell, that's saying that\nthis is not just a W.\n\n426\n00:23:30.347 --> 00:23:32.840\nThis is a special W and has meaning.\n\n427\n00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.160\nA special operator matching all non-words.\n\n428\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:42.015\nSo it would match\nthe exclamation point in 1055!\n\n429\n00:23:42.015 --> 00:23:43.345\nAnd just an aside here,\n\n430\n00:23:43.345 --> 00:23:47.547\nlet's talk about what they mean by word\nbecause that can be confusing too.\n\n431\n00:23:47.547 --> 00:23:52.073\nWe think of words as what we speak, right,\na certain combination of characters that,\n\n432\n00:23:52.073 --> 00:23:53.254\nthen mean something.\n\n433\n00:23:53.254 --> 00:23:56.656\nIn regular expressions,\na word is any character,\n\n434\n00:23:56.656 --> 00:24:02.110\nAny character other than spaces and\ntabs and line feeds and things like that.\n\n435\n00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.911\nSo 1 is a word.\n\n436\n00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:08.962\nThe letter c is a word when it\ncomes to regular expressions.\n\n437\n00:24:08.962 --> 00:24:12.810\nAn underscore is actually the one special\ncharacter that's considered a word.\n\n438\n00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.130\nBut everything else,\nlike an exclamation point, is not a word.\n\n439\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:21.450\nAnd a lot of these special characters\nyou can negate by capitalizing them.\n\n440\n00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:26.100\nLike backslash little w is\nwhen I want to specify a word.\n\n441\n00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.620\nBut if I do the big W,\nwe're saying not word.\n\n442\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.670\nLittle s is space,\nwhitespace, tabs, spaces.\n\n443\n00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.760\nBig S is not whitespace, all right.\n\n444\n00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.420\nSo sometimes you can negate\nsomething just by capitalizing it.\n\n445\n00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.389\nBut not everything,\nthat's why we have our cheat sheets.\n\n446\n00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:42.011\n[LAUGH] But\n\n447\n00:24:42.011 --> 00:24:47.000\na backlash dollar sign is a literal\ncharacter cuz a dollar sign has meaning.\n\n448\n00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.860\nWe already saw that the dollar\nsign meant end of a word, right?\n\n449\n00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.750\nBut what if I wanna look for\nthe dollar sign?\n\n450\n00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.960\nI'm looking for something in my log\nfiles that has to do with price.\n\n451\n00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.270\nSo I need to find the actual\ndollar sign symbol.\n\n452\n00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.910\nIf I try to put that in my regular\nexpression, it's gonna treat it as,\n\n453\n00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.060\nyou mean at the end of the word.\n\n454\n00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.420\nThat's what you're looking for.\n\n455\n00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:10.960\nAnd if I do backlash dollar sign, now it's\nsaying, you want the actual dollar sign.\n\n456\n00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.411\nI see what you're doing there, all right.\n\n457\n00:25:13.411 --> 00:25:14.477\nSo that one's tricky.\n\n458\n00:25:14.477 --> 00:25:19.101\nThe backslash can mean different\nthings depending on where it's used.\n\n459\n00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:23.435\nAll right, then we've got r,\nthese I kinda just said.\n\n460\n00:25:23.435 --> 00:25:28.760\nWe've got the little w to match a word,\nthe big W to match a not word.\n\n461\n00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.716\nI say little and big,\nthe lowercase and the uppercase.\n\n462\n00:25:30.716 --> 00:25:32.496\nLet's be specific there, Mike.\n\n463\n00:25:32.496 --> 00:25:38.461\nSo 105\\w would match 105a and\n\n464\n00:25:38.461 --> 00:25:43.657\n1055, whereas capital W,\n\n465\n00:25:43.657 --> 00:25:48.282\n105\\W matches 105!\n\n466\n00:25:48.282 --> 00:25:52.054\nBecause there's a non-word\ncharacter coming after that.\n\n467\n00:25:52.054 --> 00:25:54.296\nAgain, this is where it's tricky.\n\n468\n00:25:54.296 --> 00:25:55.620\nWe're thinking, wait, words.\n\n469\n00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.390\nSo now he's talking about 105.\n\n470\n00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.680\nIs that a word or not?\n\n471\n00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.710\nNo, I'm not.\n\n472\n00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.757\nI'm saying there's a 1,\nthen there's a 0, then there's a 5.\n\n473\n00:26:03.757 --> 00:26:06.290\nAnd then there's some other\ncharacter that's a word.\n\n474\n00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.736\nAn a is a word, a 5 is a word,\nan exclamation point is not a word,\n\n475\n00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:13.440\nall right.\n\n476\n00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.157\nSo this is what really I think throws\npeople off in the beginning working with\n\n477\n00:26:17.157 --> 00:26:18.444\nregular expressions is.\n\n478\n00:26:18.444 --> 00:26:23.255\nIt's so easy to forget that were only\ntalking about either preceding character\n\n479\n00:26:23.255 --> 00:26:25.925\nor that character, not the entire string.\n\n480\n00:26:25.925 --> 00:26:27.025\nCuz when we hear a word,\n\n481\n00:26:27.025 --> 00:26:30.276\nwe think of all the letters are pushed\ntogether surrounded by a space.\n\n482\n00:26:30.276 --> 00:26:31.241\nThat's what makes a word, right.\n\n483\n00:26:31.241 --> 00:26:36.081\nWhen you read a printed page,\nthe spaces delimit a word.\n\n484\n00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:40.180\nHere, a character is a word, right.\n\n485\n00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.104\nLittle d matches any digit.\n\n486\n00:26:42.104 --> 00:26:47.850\nSo 105\\d says, hey, find me a 1,\na 0, a 5, followed by some digit.\n\n487\n00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.759\nSo it could be 1055,\nit could be 1059, it could be 1050.\n\n488\n00:26:51.759 --> 00:26:54.549\nAny string 105 and then a digit.\n\n489\n00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:56.760\nThe capital D says non-digit.\n\n490\n00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:03.452\nSo 105\\D would match 105a, 105!, but\n\n491\n00:27:03.452 --> 00:27:09.220\nnot 1055 because that would be a digit.\n\n492\n00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:13.505\nAnd we're saying non-digit after 105.\n\n493\n00:27:13.505 --> 00:27:16.042\nMaybe you're looking for\npatch level or version number.\n\n494\n00:27:16.042 --> 00:27:19.126\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you need that.\n\n495\n00:27:19.126 --> 00:27:21.220\n&gt;&gt; You should be seeing this pattern,\nthough,\n\n496\n00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.900\nis that we're starting with a larger set.\n\n497\n00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:29.130\nAnd working our way down to a more\nstructured subset of that set, right.\n\n498\n00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:34.740\nSo Mike has taken us from anything to,\nwell, now we're looking at words.\n\n499\n00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.410\nAnd now we're looking at, well,\ndon't forget, letters and\n\n500\n00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:38.620\nnumbers are both considered words.\n\n501\n00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.188\nWhat if I don't want letters or\nnumbers at all?\n\n502\n00:27:41.188 --> 00:27:44.890\nNow I've gotta take that out and\nuse the d or not d or whatever.\n\n503\n00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.768\nJust continue to narrow, narrow, and\nnarrow so that you get that fine tuned.\n\n504\n00:27:48.768 --> 00:27:53.540\nRegEx can be used as a scalpel to get\nexactly what it is you're looking for.\n\n505\n00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.270\nYou just have to know the proper\nsyntax to be able to find it.\n\n506\n00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:00.769\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, [LAUGH] and\nthat's the trick right there.\n\n507\n00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:01.984\nLet's see what else we got?\n\n508\n00:28:01.984 --> 00:28:03.711\nWe talked about the ds and the ws.\n\n509\n00:28:03.711 --> 00:28:06.940\nThe ss,\nI mentioned that already as whitespace.\n\n510\n00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.685\nWhitespace is any space,\ntab, return or new line.\n\n511\n00:28:10.685 --> 00:28:16.010\nSo the little ss, I'm looking for a 1,\na 0, a 5, and then some space after it.\n\n512\n00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.750\nWhether that's a line return, or\na couple of Spacebar or Enters, or\n\n513\n00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.300\na couple of Tabs.\n\n514\n00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.352\nAnd we're saying, hey,\nthere should be whitespace after that.\n\n515\n00:28:24.352 --> 00:28:26.448\nSo you kinda see,\nif I zoom in even further,\n\n516\n00:28:26.448 --> 00:28:30.670\nyou can tell there's a space between\nthat 5 and that quote, all right.\n\n517\n00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:34.043\nWhereas the big S says, no space.\n\n518\n00:28:34.043 --> 00:28:38.356\nAnd I'm saying, make sure there's\nnon-whitespace after 105.\n\n519\n00:28:38.356 --> 00:28:43.970\nSo 1055, well, that second 5 is not\nwhitespace, so that would match.\n\n520\n00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.000\nThe a is not whitespace,\nso that would match.\n\n521\n00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.010\nThe exclamation point is not whitespace,\nso that would match.\n\n522\n00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:54.058\nAnd that zoom with the scroll wheel,\nit doesn't work too well.\n\n523\n00:28:54.058 --> 00:28:57.016\nThe bs are word boundaries.\n\n524\n00:28:57.016 --> 00:29:01.159\nDefined as one side being any\nnon-whitespace character.\n\n525\n00:29:01.159 --> 00:29:05.090\nThe other being a whitespace character.\n\n526\n00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:11.573\nSo 105\\b matches 105 in 22105,\n\n527\n00:29:11.573 --> 00:29:16.525\nbut not the 105 in 21052.\n\n528\n00:29:16.525 --> 00:29:19.449\nBecause l'm saying, there should be a 105.\n\n529\n00:29:19.449 --> 00:29:22.724\nAnd then after that 105,\n\n530\n00:29:22.724 --> 00:29:27.504\nthere should be whitespace, all right.\n\n531\n00:29:27.504 --> 00:29:30.389\nBecause this is a boundary\nof a word there.\n\n532\n00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:34.810\nSo because that 2 follows the 5 in\nthe second example, it will not match.\n\n533\n00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.616\nIf there was a 2105 2,\nthen that would have matched.\n\n534\n00:29:38.616 --> 00:29:40.810\nCuz then that 5 would be a word boundary,\nright.\n\n535\n00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.920\nThe capital B, a non-word boundary.\n\n536\n00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.028\nSo now if I'm trying to find 105 in\nthe middle of a series of numbers,\n\n537\n00:29:50.028 --> 00:29:50.855\nfor example.\n\n538\n00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:54.861\nI could say, I wanna find 105\\B.\n\n539\n00:29:54.861 --> 00:29:55.915\nSo here it would match.\n\n540\n00:29:58.337 --> 00:30:02.068\nAnd the little c is for\nmy control characters.\n\n541\n00:30:02.068 --> 00:30:05.461\nA control character is non-written\nsymbols like Tab or Return.\n\n542\n00:30:05.461 --> 00:30:08.709\nHere, they're saying they're looking for\n\n543\n00:30:08.709 --> 00:30:14.441\n105\\cI is the same thing as looking for\n105 and then Ctrl+I after that.\n\n544\n00:30:17.037 --> 00:30:18.590\nOops, that is zoom, not next picture.\n\n545\n00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.980\nAll right, I know we're getting\nabout out of time here, Daniel.\n\n546\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.785\nLet me see what else we've\ngot as far as slides go.\n\n547\n00:30:25.785 --> 00:30:29.510\nLet's do one more and then we'll go\nback and we'll take a look at some.\n\n548\n00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.550\nOr actually, that's probably\na good place to stop, kinda.\n\n549\n00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.150\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n550\n00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:35.325\n&gt;&gt; We got lots of examples that I wanna\nshow you to kinda put some of this\n\n551\n00:30:35.325 --> 00:30:35.960\ninto place.\n\n552\n00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.000\nBut we have been talking for\na little while.\n\n553\n00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.357\n&gt;&gt; The clock is a very stringent mistress.\n\n554\n00:30:42.357 --> 00:30:44.095\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She keeps us to our paces,\n\n555\n00:30:44.095 --> 00:30:45.520\nthat's for sure.\n\n556\n00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.450\nAnd it has completely expired for\nthis episode.\n\n557\n00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.790\nWe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n558\n00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.620\nHopefully, we haven't scared you\ntoo badly when it comes to RegEx.\n\n559\n00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:56.020\nIf you are new to RegEx,\nyou're probably quaking in your boots.\n\n560\n00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.550\nAnd that's fine, we understand.\n\n561\n00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.280\nWe'll be there with you.\n\n562\n00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.620\nWe will hold your hand because\nit can be very difficult.\n\n563\n00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.342\nMike, well,\n\n564\n00:31:02.342 --> 00:31:06.590\nI think you did a very good job explaining\neach one of the operators inside of RegEx.\n\n565\n00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.620\nAt least giving us\nan idea of what they do.\n\n566\n00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.040\nAnd how we can use them so that we can\ngo down the road a little farther.\n\n567\n00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.737\nAnd see how we can\npractically work that out.\n\n568\n00:31:13.737 --> 00:31:16.470\nThat being said,\nthere is no time left on the clock.\n\n569\n00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.900\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncall this a day for this episode.\n\n570\n00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.469\nThanks for joining us for ITProTV.\n\n571\n00:31:20.469 --> 00:31:21.826\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n572\n00:31:21.826 --> 00:31:22.796\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n573\n00:31:22.796 --> 00:31:25.617\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n574\n00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:31.552\n[MUSIC]\n\n575\n00:31:31.552 --> 00:31:34.906\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.224\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:12.349\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.129\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.980\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.952\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.952 --> 00:00:21.832\nAnd in today's episode we're back with\nmore of our CyberSec First Responder\n\n9\n00:00:21.832 --> 00:00:26.007\nseries and, of course, joining us back in\nthe studio, yet again, to continue our\n\n10\n00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:30.510\nconversation on regular expression, our\ngood friend, our mentor Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n11\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.340\nMike, welcome back sir.\n\n12\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.070\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.890\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Daniel,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.145\nAnd yeah,\nmore of those regular expressions.\n\n15\n00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:38.840\n[LAUGH] All right so yeah,\n\n16\n00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.035\nwe got in the previous episode we\ntook a look at lot of the operators.\n\n17\n00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:45.810\nSo we just went through a list of\noperators, defined what they meant,\n\n18\n00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.430\nand a couple of examples of what\nthey would and would not match.\n\n19\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.410\nNow I want to try to put\nsome of these into play and\n\n20\n00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.236\nactually use them so\nyou can see how they work.\n\n21\n00:00:57.236 --> 00:01:01.800\nAnd then I wanna go back and take a couple\nof examples from Logical Operations that\n\n22\n00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.620\nwe can try to decipher and see if we\ncan read because when it comes time for\n\n23\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.610\nthe exam you're not gonna be\nwriting any regular expressions.\n\n24\n00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.501\n[SOUND] All right?\n\n25\n00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:13.200\nWipe my forehead on that one.\n\n26\n00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.720\nBut what they are gonna do is give you\n\n27\n00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.390\nwhich regular expression would you\nuse to give you these results?\n\n28\n00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.350\nAnd here's four regular expressions.\n\n29\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.910\nAnd at first glance,\nthey all look exactly the same.\n\n30\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.540\nA string of random characters\nabout 30 characters long.\n\n31\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.180\nAnd you've gotta figure out, wait, which\none is it that's gonna give me the results\n\n32\n00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.360\nthat I'm looking for on this question?\n\n33\n00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.340\nAnd so, like I said, it was one that kind\nof caught me off guard a little bit is\n\n34\n00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.360\nthere was more than one\nregular expression question.\n\n35\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.820\nBut and again, I probably shouldn't be\ntalking about actual exam questions.\n\n36\n00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.500\nI'm not giving any actual\nexam questions away.\n\n37\n00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.810\nI'm just saying there are going to be\nregular expression questions on the exam,\n\n38\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.440\nand in my case there was more than one,\nbut it's a pool of questions so\n\n39\n00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.190\nyou never know what you're gonna get.\n\n40\n00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.960\nAll right so that being said let's\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n41\n00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.600\nI've got my Kali box open.\n\n42\n00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.530\nAnd I've made up a little\nfile that we're gonna use and\n\n43\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.214\nI'll kind of leave it open\nin the background here.\n\n44\n00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:13.657\nAnd it's just got different things\nthat I wanted to use as, hey,\n\n45\n00:02:13.657 --> 00:02:16.036\nlet's try to figure out\nif we can match this or\n\n46\n00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:19.550\nthat or the other as we go through\nthese different operators.\n\n47\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.610\nWe're gonna keep it really simple,\n\n48\n00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.720\nbasically single operators in each one of\nthese to see how each one of them works.\n\n49\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.190\nAll right, so we can bring that back up.\n\n50\n00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.470\nLet me fire up my terminal here.\n\n51\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.920\nWhere'd that guy go?\n\n52\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.940\nWe'll throw that in the background so\nwe can peek at it if we want to.\n\n53\n00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.670\nAll right, so what we're gonna\ndo here is we're gonna start.\n\n54\n00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.414\nWe're gonna be using grep.\n\n55\n00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:50.039\nAnd one thing I will tell you is that\nversions will make a difference,\n\n56\n00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.848\nall right.\n\n57\n00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:54.979\nLike I said I'm here on Kali Linux, and\n\n58\n00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:59.996\nKali Linux grep,\nthere's GNU grep two point.\n\n59\n00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:01.667\nWow, I cannot talk.\n\n60\n00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:03.730\n&gt;&gt; 2.27.\n&gt;&gt; 2.27, thank you.\n\n61\n00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.790\nAnd it won't make a difference.\n\n62\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.060\nCertain commands might or\n\n63\n00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.660\nmight not work on whatever you're sitting\nat when you're playing with this.\n\n64\n00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.420\nSo play around with them.\n\n65\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.500\nTry a few different ways.\n\n66\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.720\nThere's always more than one way.\n\n67\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.360\nI was telling you earlier, I read\nthis thing where this guy was saying,\n\n68\n00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.520\nhey look, if you can write a regular\nexpression successfully to find something,\n\n69\n00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.810\nI can pretty much guarantee you that\nthere's an infinite number of other ways\n\n70\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.390\nyou could write the expression\nto find the exact same thing.\n\n71\n00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.905\nNow infinite is probably not true but\nthe point is valid that there's definitely\n\n72\n00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:43.225\nmore than one way to skin the cat, so we\nsay, when it comes to regular expressions.\n\n73\n00:03:43.225 --> 00:03:47.535\nWhatever works for you is probably\nthe best way to do it, right?\n\n74\n00:03:47.535 --> 00:03:51.710\nLike I said, we can do open bracket,\nzero, one, two, three closed bracket.\n\n75\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.020\nOr I could do open bracket,\none dash three, closed bracket.\n\n76\n00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.610\nIt would be the exact same results.\n\n77\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.060\nReadability wise, they're pretty close,\nbut as my expressions get\n\n78\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.810\nmuch more complex, then it really can\nmake a difference in readability,\n\n79\n00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.660\nso it's really what works best for you.\n\n80\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.260\nAll right, so with that being said,\nlet's get started here.\n\n81\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.080\nThe first one I wanna do is just grepping\nfor a simple string of letters or\n\n82\n00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.730\nnumbers in that respect.\n\n83\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.961\nBut let's do grep HTTP.\n\n84\n00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:22.185\nHow's my font there Daniel,\nis that big enough for everybody?\n\n85\n00:04:22.185 --> 00:04:23.106\n&gt;&gt; You're looking good, yeah.\n\n86\n00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:25.182\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and then the name of the file.\n\n87\n00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:31.218\nSo with grep, it's grep,\nthe pattern you're looking for, and\n\n88\n00:04:31.218 --> 00:04:36.390\nthen the file that you want to examine for\nthat pattern.\n\n89\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.260\nAll right, I'll hit Enter and\nnotice it found HTTPS, and the URL,\n\n90\n00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.700\nand it also found HTTP, and\n\n91\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.850\nthe rest because I didn't specify\nthat HTTP was the end of the word, or\n\n92\n00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.680\nanything like that, so\nHTTP is indeed part of HTTPS, all right.\n\n93\n00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.330\nSo that's the HTTP.\n\n94\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.360\nWe could also do grep 192 and then regex.\n\n95\n00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.800\nAnd notice that pulls back several\nresults because they have 192 in them.\n\n96\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.883\nAll right, so anything that has a good\nold 192 is gonna count for that.\n\n97\n00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:19.090\nSo this is very basic, very simple.\n\n98\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.640\nType what you're looking for,\nhit Enter, and go for it, all right?\n\n99\n00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.340\nLet's see what else we can do.\n\n100\n00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.576\nIf we had changed that up we\nwould've done grep HTTPS.\n\n101\n00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.970\nNotice we don't get the HTTP because we\nsaid there should be an S following the P.\n\n102\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.300\nWell in that HTTP there's\na colon following the P.\n\n103\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.760\nThat is not an S so\nthat one is not going to match, all right.\n\n104\n00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.820\nLet's see,\nnow let's do some wild card options.\n\n105\n00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.420\nWe'll do grep.\n\n106\n00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.842\nWhat if I do something like this, F..L?\n\n107\n00:05:59.062 --> 00:06:01.780\nAll right, I was like,\nwait those are weird results.\n\n108\n00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.931\nWhat were you actually looking for?\n\n109\n00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:08.278\nSo F..L, I'm saying, there should be\nan F and then anything except for\n\n110\n00:06:08.278 --> 00:06:13.960\na return, and then anything except for\na return, and then L, all right.\n\n111\n00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.770\nSo in default, well there's an F,\nsomething, something L, all right.\n\n112\n00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.120\nIn fail, there is an F,\nsomething, something, L.\n\n113\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.270\nNot the same something,\nsomething, but it doesn't matter.\n\n114\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.850\nThat's the wild card.\n\n115\n00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.570\nAlso notice I can't just do dot to\nrepresent any number of characters.\n\n116\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.920\nThere are some combinations I can\nget in there and do with that but\n\n117\n00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.280\nin this case the dot represents\na single wildcard character.\n\n118\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.170\nSo if I wanted F three\nrandom somethings and\n\n119\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.180\nthen an L I'd put F dot dot dot,\nL, all right, to match that.\n\n120\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.580\nNext we're gonna look at\nescaping a character.\n\n121\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:55.309\nSo what if I do grep, open parentheses,\nand then my name on my file.\n\n122\n00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:02.370\nWhat is, silly thing.\n\n123\n00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.920\nThere's, all right,\nlet me get rid of that.\n\n124\n00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.540\nTry that again.\n\n125\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.012\nOpen parenthesis, reg.\n\n126\n00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.810\nWhy is it not liking that?\n\n127\n00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.700\nI'm going to have to try\nto force this to do it.\n\n128\n00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.695\nLet's see if I can make it do it.\n\n129\n00:07:14.695 --> 00:07:19.530\nDemo.txt, yeah, it's not liking that.\n\n130\n00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.715\nBecause of the, I was gonna try to show\nyou how we have to escape a character and\n\n131\n00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:25.910\nit's already telling me,\n\n132\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.470\nwait a second that open\nparenthesis is missing something.\n\n133\n00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:36.540\nWe do have over here, I can see\nescape test open close parenthesis.\n\n134\n00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:42.210\nWhat if I do this, grep,\nthat is not the one I want.\n\n135\n00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.907\nBackslash, open parentheses, and\n\n136\n00:07:44.907 --> 00:07:49.722\nthen regex, dot text, and\nnotice it finds it now.\n\n137\n00:07:49.722 --> 00:07:52.762\nSo, and this is something very\ncommon you're going to use grep or\n\n138\n00:07:52.762 --> 00:07:55.806\nregex editor and you're like,\nI'm looking for parenthesis and\n\n139\n00:07:55.806 --> 00:07:57.428\nit's not working like it is here.\n\n140\n00:07:57.428 --> 00:07:59.475\nThat's saying, hey no,\nhey no, and I'm like yes.\n\n141\n00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:01.855\nI'm looking for parentheses in my text.\n\n142\n00:08:01.855 --> 00:08:03.376\nSomewhere in this log file.\n\n143\n00:08:03.376 --> 00:08:05.888\nThere's an open parentheses, something,\nsomething, close parentheses.\n\n144\n00:08:05.888 --> 00:08:06.992\nI need to find it.\n\n145\n00:08:06.992 --> 00:08:08.580\nWell, you can.\n\n146\n00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.750\n&gt;&gt; We're running into the fact that\nthe open parentheses is a special\n\n147\n00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.055\ncharacter for regular expression, and\nthat's why we're having too low, well, no,\n\n148\n00:08:16.055 --> 00:08:19.145\ndon't treat it as a regular\nexpression special character.\n\n149\n00:08:19.145 --> 00:08:23.325\nI just need you to treat it as any normal\nopen parenthesis inside of my document.\n\n150\n00:08:23.325 --> 00:08:27.495\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right we got to use\nthat to make it a literal.\n\n151\n00:08:27.495 --> 00:08:31.065\nLike if we tried grep, open close\nparenthesis, well now we're not going to\n\n152\n00:08:31.065 --> 00:08:34.925\nget the error about you're\nmissing a closing parenthesis but\n\n153\n00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:35.545\nwhat's it going to find?\n\n154\n00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.400\nNotice it gives me another error cause now\nit's saying, hey, that's a grouping but\n\n155\n00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.750\nthere's nothing inside your grouping.\n\n156\n00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.580\nThere's no expression.\n\n157\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.930\nWhat am I actually looking for?\n\n158\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:48.640\nThere's no pattern here to look for\nbut if I did this.\n\n159\n00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.560\nLet's escape that and escape that.\n\n160\n00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.890\nNotice now it finds it no problem.\n\n161\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.870\nBecause I told it hey, no,\n\n162\n00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:02.080\nthis isn't a special character treat\nit as a literal character, all right.\n\n163\n00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.800\nNext, let's do some character classes.\n\n164\n00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.590\nNow again, classes, character classes.\n\n165\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:14.060\nWhen we do the open bracket,\nour characters inside there, and close.\n\n166\n00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.632\nLet me clear this screen.\n\n167\n00:09:16.632 --> 00:09:19.470\nGoing to tidy up a little bit,\nand let's do a grep.\n\n168\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:25.450\nLet's say I want to find; notice\nover here I've got WAN, LAN, CAN.\n\n169\n00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.020\nYou know what?\nLet me bump the font up on that.\n\n170\n00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.049\nI don't think you can see\nthat all that well can you.\n\n171\n00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:32.322\nCan I bump that up?\n\n172\n00:09:34.703 --> 00:09:37.280\nEvidently, it doesn't\nlike any of my shortcuts.\n\n173\n00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.320\nI could go into my Properties,\nbut we'll worry about that later.\n\n174\n00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.960\nAll right, and I can't spell grep right.\n\n175\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Gerp.\n\n176\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.814\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; That's not going\nto work out too well.\n\n177\n00:09:44.814 --> 00:09:45.794\n&gt;&gt; You can't gerp things, Mike.\n\n178\n00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.460\n&gt;&gt; Let's say I'm looking for lan and\n\n179\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.110\ncan and man or something like that.\n\n180\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.180\nSo what I can do.\n\n181\n00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.210\nIs, I could do each word, right.\n\n182\n00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.860\nOr I could use my character class.\n\n183\n00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.230\nI can do open brace, lcw.\n\n184\n00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.990\nClose brace, an.\n\n185\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.360\nAnd then the name of\nthe file I want to search.\n\n186\n00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.890\nAnd I'll hit enter.\n\n187\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:12.750\nAnd notice it finds land, wan,\ncan, but it didn't find man or\n\n188\n00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.010\npan, which is in my list.\n\n189\n00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:20.110\nAnd that's because there's no p or m as\na possibility for the first character.\n\n190\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.630\nThis is again where it's a little tricky.\n\n191\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.630\nYou've got to remember that,\ninside that bracket,\n\n192\n00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.540\nI'm saying it's gotta be one of these\ncharacters, but only for one character.\n\n193\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.370\nThen there has to be an A, so it's an L,\n\n194\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.570\nfollowed by an A, a C followed by an A,\nor a W followed by an A.\n\n195\n00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.090\nAnything else followed\nby an A doesn't count.\n\n196\n00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.010\nAnd there has to be an N after the A,\nright?\n\n197\n00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:45.654\nCuz I've told it specifically an A and\nan N after one of these characters.\n\n198\n00:10:45.654 --> 00:10:47.937\nWhat if I did this?\n\n199\n00:10:47.937 --> 00:10:50.970\nWhat if we said, and\nlet's just bring that last command back.\n\n200\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:56.020\nAnd add a caret inside the open and\nclosed brace.\n\n201\n00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.010\nRemember, this is the negative,\nthe negator.\n\n202\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:58.780\n&gt;&gt; The negation, yeah.\n\n203\n00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.430\n&gt;&gt; The negation, yeah.\n\n204\n00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:05.600\nSo now I'm saying not L or\nC or W, followed by an AN.\n\n205\n00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.670\nSo anything else but those three\nletters followed by an A and an N.\n\n206\n00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.520\n&gt;&gt; So it should grab all the ones that\nwe didn't get with our previous search.\n\n207\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, and we look at our\nresults, and we did but we also got LAN.\n\n208\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.060\n&gt;&gt; Sort of.\n&gt;&gt; Wait a second,\n\n209\n00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.350\nwhat the heck is up with that?\n\n210\n00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.980\nWe didn't see that on the last result,\nright, I didn't see that up here.\n\n211\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.360\nWhy didn't it match but it did match here?\n\n212\n00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.380\nBut that's an L and we said no L's.\n\n213\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.060\nWhat is your guess on that one?\n\n214\n00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.310\n&gt;&gt; No lowercase L's.\n\n215\n00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:36.130\nThis is an uppercase L and in this type of\nenvironment case sensitivity is important.\n\n216\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.290\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely is.\n\n217\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.250\nIt is matching at a case sensitive.\n\n218\n00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.510\nSo we could do a couple\nof different things.\n\n219\n00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.490\nIf we went back to when we were\nlooking for the LAN CAN or WAN,\n\n220\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.530\nI could add a capital L in\nthere as a possibility right.\n\n221\n00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.700\nAnd now both those LANs come up.\n\n222\n00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.600\nOr if I wanted to do my\nnegative I can say hey not l or\n\n223\n00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.640\nuppercase L I don't want any L's.\n\n224\n00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.440\nAnd now we just get the MAN and\nthe PAN all right.\n\n225\n00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.090\nSo, we can use again, that's the character\nset, the open closed bracket.\n\n226\n00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:12.420\nAnd the carrot inside\nthose brackets there.\n\n227\n00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.920\nWhat about a range of characters?\n\n228\n00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.930\nLet's do that one.\n\n229\n00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:24.179\nWhat if I do grep, open bracket, and\nthen we'll do something like a-m.\n\n230\n00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.587\nAnd I'm also gonna do a-m.\n\n231\n00:12:27.587 --> 00:12:30.172\nWhoops.\n\n232\n00:12:30.172 --> 00:12:33.190\nAnd I'll close that bracket, all right,\nand then the name of the file.\n\n233\n00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.010\nSo what I'm doing here is I'm saying\nit could be an a through an m, or\n\n234\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.440\nan uppercase A through an M.\n\n235\n00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.650\nLowercase or uppercase A through M.\n\n236\n00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.890\nAnd I hit enter.\n\n237\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.460\nAnd we get all kinds of crazy stuff\nbecause Mike forgot the an on\n\n238\n00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.480\nthe end of that.\n\n239\n00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.553\nSo lets try that again.\n\n240\n00:12:49.553 --> 00:12:50.359\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's an a.\n\n241\n00:12:50.359 --> 00:12:52.010\n&gt;&gt; So Mike [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah just\n\n242\n00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:56.120\nabout everyone of those things on my list\nhas either an a or n in there somewhere.\n\n243\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.581\nSo that's not very specific\nlets add the an to that and\n\n244\n00:12:58.581 --> 00:13:01.436\nwe'll get to back to looking for\nlan, man, can, wan, pan.\n\n245\n00:13:01.436 --> 00:13:03.510\nRight, and now notice what I find.\n\n246\n00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:11.010\nI find both LAN with an uppercase L and\nlan with a lowercase l and CAN and MAN.\n\n247\n00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.620\nBecause they fall within\nthose ranges there.\n\n248\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.230\nAnd what I want you to notice is how I\ndid that range or those multiple ranges.\n\n249\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.790\nYou can specify multiple ranges\nwithin the open and close bracket.\n\n250\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.520\nThere's no comma between there.\n\n251\n00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.380\nThere's no semi colon it's range,\nplugged up right against range,\n\n252\n00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.410\nplugged up right against range.\n\n253\n00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:28.910\nRight?\n\n254\n00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.850\nIn fact,\nwe talked about what a word was earlier.\n\n255\n00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:39.082\nJust to type it out so\nyou can visualize it,\n\n256\n00:13:39.082 --> 00:13:43.238\nif I do open bracket, a-z,\n\n257\n00:13:43.238 --> 00:13:48.110\na-z, 0-9_ close bracket.\n\n258\n00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.710\nThat's basically the same thing\nas saying slash w, right?\n\n259\n00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.570\nBecause it's a word.\n\n260\n00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.990\nAll those characters are considered words,\nspecial characters,\n\n261\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.340\nspaces are not considered words,\nall right?\n\n262\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.560\nBut notice how I just slammed all those\nranges together, no separators in there.\n\n263\n00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.520\nIt'll figure it out, all right,\nlet's clear that up a little bit.\n\n264\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.450\nAnd what's next?\n\n265\n00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:15.260\nSo we did our character range,\nlet's do one with an IP address next and\n\n266\n00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.290\nthen I lost track of time, so\nyou have to keep me on track here.\n\n267\n00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.060\nWhat I wanna do is I'm gonna grep for,\n\n268\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.780\nwe've got a bunch of IP\naddresses over there.\n\n269\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.700\nAnd when you're grepping for\n\n270\n00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.540\nIP addresses this can be challenging,\ndepending on what you're trying to do.\n\n271\n00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.750\nBut a good majority of the time,\n\n272\n00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:37.590\nI'm looking at IP addresses\nwhere most of it stays the same.\n\n273\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.770\nAnd I'm looking for a particular\naddress within a subnet, for example.\n\n274\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:45.430\nWhich is a lot easier than just\ntrying to find valid IP ranges.\n\n275\n00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.130\nCuz then I've gotta specify all\nthe possibilities, one, two,\n\n276\n00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:54.860\nthree digits per octet it becomes a really\nlong complex formula or expression.\n\n277\n00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.883\nBut in this case, because,\nlet's say I want to find all the entries\n\n278\n00:14:59.883 --> 00:15:06.774\nin my log file from the computers or any\nnode on the 10.1.100 subnet /24, right.\n\n279\n00:15:06.774 --> 00:15:08.980\nSo those first three octets\naren't gonna change.\n\n280\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.060\nSo those,\nI can actually specify statically in here.\n\n281\n00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.640\nSo what I can do is, I can say,\nall right, we're gonna look for 10.\n\n282\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.220\nIt helps if you turn your number lock on.\n\n283\n00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.830\nNow we're gonna do 10., wait.\n\n284\n00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.030\nThat dot is a special character isn't it?\n\n285\n00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.650\nThat's gonna represent a wild card,\nthat's not what I'm trying to do here.\n\n286\n00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.750\nSo I have to tell it,\nthat's a literal character.\n\n287\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.410\nSo the actual period is\nwhat I'm looking for.\n\n288\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:37.080\nSo 10.0.- making sure I\n\n289\n00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:42.040\nescape it there, 100 Escape dot.\n\n290\n00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.600\nAnd now the third octet\nis what can be anything.\n\n291\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.410\nNow I could stop right there.\n\n292\n00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.980\nIn fact let's try it,\nlet's see what happens.\n\n293\n00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.388\nRegx demo and look, that works just fine.\n\n294\n00:15:51.388 --> 00:15:56.325\nBecause, well because I'm\nsaying that's 10.0.100., and\n\n295\n00:15:56.325 --> 00:16:00.029\nthen I'm not specifying\nanything after that, and so\n\n296\n00:16:00.029 --> 00:16:03.338\nall of these have that string in there,\nright?\n\n297\n00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.744\n10.0.100.\n\n298\n00:16:05.744 --> 00:16:09.080\nBut what if there was a number in\nmy file that looked like this?\n\n299\n00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.560\nWhat if we go over here, and we add one.\n\n300\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.470\nAnd we say 10.0.100.100 [SOUND].\n\n301\n00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:17.268\nRight, something like that.\n\n302\n00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:18.530\nRight, or we'll save,\nmake it look even better.\n\n303\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.280\nWe'll just say something crazy like that,\nright?\n\n304\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.819\nLet's save that guy [SOUND].\n\n305\n00:16:24.819 --> 00:16:26.560\nAnd see what my regular expression does.\n\n306\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.310\nSame expression.\n\n307\n00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.750\nAnd it returns that.\n\n308\n00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.780\nAnd that's not an IP address.\n\n309\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.780\nThat can be a serial number,\na version number in a log file,\n\n310\n00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.810\ndefinitely not what I'm looking for.\n\n311\n00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.660\nAnd I try to do, yeah, so\nit's, it shouldn't be there.\n\n312\n00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:45.170\nSo yes, my expression worked when\nthe data was exactly as I wanted it.\n\n313\n00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.130\nBut that's typically not the case, right?\n\n314\n00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.988\nI can't guarantee that there aren't any\nnumbers that happen to follow the format\n\n315\n00:16:50.988 --> 00:16:52.163\n10.0.100.\n\n316\n00:16:52.163 --> 00:16:53.970\nand then crazy stuff after it.\n\n317\n00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.090\nSo I really need to be more\nspecific in my expression.\n\n318\n00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.650\nSo if I want just IP addresses,\nor at least again,\n\n319\n00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.150\nthey might not be IP addresses.\n\n320\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.570\nBut if I wanna specify it has to be just\nthree digits in that last octet there,\n\n321\n00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.790\nthat's where we're gonna\nhave to change things up.\n\n322\n00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.100\nSo let's do this.\n\n323\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:13.575\nLet's do, basically, what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna say, open bracket,\n\n324\n00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:18.090\n0 through 9, and even that I don't\nknow lets see if we wanna do.\n\n325\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:21.730\nWe wanna do that then we won't\nbe more specific than that.\n\n326\n00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.490\nLets be more specific then.\n\n327\n00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:27.500\nSo the first character in the last octet,\nwhat are my possible values and\n\n328\n00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.820\nthis is really have to,\nhow you have to think about it.\n\n329\n00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.580\nWhat possible values could there be and\n\n330\n00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.110\nhow can I write\nan expression to match that.\n\n331\n00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.590\nSo if I think about the last octet,\nit's one to three characters long,\n\n332\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.050\nall right digits.\n\n333\n00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.760\nIt could be 0.1 through,\nall the way through 0.255.\n\n334\n00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.770\nAlright, let's say that.\n\n335\n00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:49.980\nSo let's change this, we're gonna\nsay should be a 1 all the way up\n\n336\n00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:55.050\nto 9, all right and we'll close the.\n\n337\n00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.070\nActually I take that back.\n\n338\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.590\nThat should be, let's do it this way,\n\n339\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.840\nlet's say that the first digit\ncould really only be a 1 or a 2.\n\n340\n00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.600\nOr nothing at all.\n\n341\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.801\nSo let's say 0-2.\n\n342\n00:18:09.801 --> 00:18:13.750\nClose that bracket, but\nthen I'm gonna put a question mark.\n\n343\n00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.820\nAnd this might throw my whole example off.\n\n344\n00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.630\nYou know what?\n\n345\n00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.980\nLet me do my actual example and\nthen we'll try to get creative with it.\n\n346\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.500\nAnd I'll tell you what that\nquestion mark was gonna do there.\n\n347\n00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.510\nSo let's do it this way first,\nthe way I know it's gonna work.\n\n348\n00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:29.180\nLet's do 2, open brace,\nzero dash nine, close brace.\n\n349\n00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.000\nI told you we were going to\nkeep things simple at first and\n\n350\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.120\nthen I start throwing in crazy stuff.\n\n351\n00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.120\nOpen brace, zero dash nine,\nclose brace, alright?\n\n352\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.900\n&gt;&gt; So this is going to create\nsomething in the 200 range.\n\n353\n00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so you should see all IP\naddresses on that subnet that start with\n\n354\n00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.740\na 2 in the last octet, 2 through 200.\n\n355\n00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.090\nThrough 299, really, in my case.\n\n356\n00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:51.450\nAnd sure enough, it did.\n\n357\n00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.140\nI just see the twos.\n\n358\n00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:57.750\nNow again,\nthat would give me false results if\n\n359\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.260\nsomething that looks similar\nto an IP address over here.\n\n360\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.230\nOops, I can't type.\n\n361\n00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:07.820\nAll right,\nthat's not a valid IP address, 286.\n\n362\n00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.100\nBut we're not checking for\nvalid IP addresses,\n\n363\n00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.040\nwe're looking for\npatterns of numbers here in this case.\n\n364\n00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.270\nSo that one would actually\ncome up in my results.\n\n365\n00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.455\nWell, we know better than that, we know\nthat our numbers shouldn't be like that in\n\n366\n00:19:21.455 --> 00:19:24.385\nour IP addresses, so\nlet's say 5 for that, 0 through 5.\n\n367\n00:19:24.385 --> 00:19:29.005\nAnd the last number, if it's a 5 in this\ncase it'd be my broadcast address for\n\n368\n00:19:29.005 --> 00:19:29.885\nthis particular subnet .255.\n\n369\n00:19:29.885 --> 00:19:32.475\nSo I don't even want a 5,\nI wanna put a 4 there.\n\n370\n00:19:32.475 --> 00:19:36.949\nAll right and now I'm getting,\n\n371\n00:19:36.949 --> 00:19:40.570\nwhat do we get there, but\nI have to put a five there,\n\n372\n00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.690\nbecause then i wont get the two thirty\nfive, the fun of regular expressions.\n\n373\n00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.340\nThere are ways I could do that as well,\nI put an OR and we could fix that so\n\n374\n00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.835\nit could find the 235s and\nthe 254s but not the 255s.\n\n375\n00:19:54.835 --> 00:19:57.550\nIt's just gonna make my expression\nthat much more complex, alright.\n\n376\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.440\nBut, for the most part, that's gonna work,\nat least it gets me close to what I want\n\n377\n00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.420\nfor this particular scenario and what we\nneed to know for this exam, all right?\n\n378\n00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.920\nSo pretty neat there, the way you mim,\n\n379\n00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:16.570\nthat's kinda combining escaping characters\nas well using my ranges over there.\n\n380\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.730\nWhat else did I say we were\ngoing to do with that, Daniel,\n\n381\n00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.070\nI think that's probably good.\n\n382\n00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:25.260\nNow Daniel pointed out it's only\nthe 200's, but we could change that.\n\n383\n00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.510\nLet's try doing something like this.\n\n384\n00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:32.490\nWe'll say the open bracket 0-2,\nclose bracket,\n\n385\n00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:36.260\nand what's that gonna do to my numbers.\n\n386\n00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.310\nNotice that gets all of this stuff.\n\n387\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:43.570\nBut it also gets this one that doesn't\nmatch anything up here anymore.\n\n388\n00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.460\nAnd that's not what I want.\n\n389\n00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.630\nSo let's get rid of that.\n\n390\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:53.582\nSo what I could do, is I could say,\nthis is the end of the word.\n\n391\n00:20:53.582 --> 00:20:57.415\nAnd notice that one is now\ngone from our results,\n\n392\n00:20:57.415 --> 00:21:00.600\nbecause I put that dollar sign\nafter that last character.\n\n393\n00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.550\nThat last character could be a 0, 1, 2, 3,\n4 or 5 but I'm saying, after whatever that\n\n394\n00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:08.470\ncharacter is, that's the end of the word,\nthere should be a word boundary there.\n\n395\n00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.570\nAnd so now that number that\ndoesn't match IP formats\n\n396\n00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.920\nis no longer included in my results.\n\n397\n00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.660\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n398\n00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.700\nIf you really wanna challenge yourself,\nhave a good time, and\n\n399\n00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.600\ntry to figure out how,\nwhat if we wanted to add 10.0.100.72?\n\n400\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.260\nRight, make that happen, right?\n\n401\n00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.690\nSo that's, you should be able\nto take what you've learned so\n\n402\n00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.920\nfar, use a little bit of logic\nin your regular expression.\n\n403\n00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.370\nTry to see if you can't make that work.\n\n404\n00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it gets fun.\n\n405\n00:21:32.175 --> 00:21:33.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well if we have time,\n\n406\n00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.670\nI'll show you some examples\nof writing when looking for\n\n407\n00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.650\nvalid IP addresses, right?\n\n408\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:39.740\nBecause really, writing a form,\n\n409\n00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.090\nin fact, we'll come back to that\nconcept here, actually let's do it now.\n\n410\n00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:45.280\n&gt;&gt; You're already here Mike.\n\n411\n00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it.\n\n412\n00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.290\nLet me clear up my screen a little bit,\n\n413\n00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.610\nbecause I don't like working\nat the bottom or the top.\n\n414\n00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.192\nAnd you notice I like\nworking in the middle there.\n\n415\n00:21:51.192 --> 00:21:53.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If I get down to the bottom,\n\n416\n00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.080\nI clear the screen, but\n\n417\n00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.480\nthen I immediately hit here a couple times\nto get out of the top, that's just me.\n\n418\n00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:04.468\nOne thing that's usually really\neasy to do, looking for digits.\n\n419\n00:22:04.468 --> 00:22:07.260\nThere is a shorthand that you can use.\n\n420\n00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.390\nLet's say I was looking for\na social security number.\n\n421\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.090\nIn the US we have social security\nnumbers that identify us uniquely so\n\n422\n00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.400\nwe can pay our taxes and\nthey can verify if we did.\n\n423\n00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.470\nAll that good stuff.\n\n424\n00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:17.630\nBut they follow the format.\n\n425\n00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:21.210\nThree digits, dash,\ntwo digits, dash, four digits.\n\n426\n00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.710\nSo in most expressions, or RegX engines,\n\n427\n00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:29.670\nI can actually do something very simple.\n\n428\n00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:35.637\nI can do \\d \\d \\d- \\d \\d- \\d \\d \\d \\d- and\n\n429\n00:22:35.637 --> 00:22:38.570\nI get a whole lot of nothing.\n\n430\n00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:39.950\nNow, you guys should be able to see,\n\n431\n00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:45.140\nright over here, I have that,\nand it's not matching it.\n\n432\n00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:45.750\nAll right?\n\n433\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.050\nWhen it technically should.\n\n434\n00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.280\nAnd in other Regx engines,\nit probably will.\n\n435\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.297\nThe \\d is shorthand for digit.\n\n436\n00:22:55.297 --> 00:23:00.355\nAnd not every flavor\nincludes all those options.\n\n437\n00:23:01.445 --> 00:23:02.515\nGrep in here does not.\n\n438\n00:23:02.515 --> 00:23:06.695\nNow, this Grep uses what's called\nbasic regular expressions.\n\n439\n00:23:06.695 --> 00:23:09.235\nYou can do extended regular expressions.\n\n440\n00:23:09.235 --> 00:23:11.033\nBut even that, I don't think,\nis gonna cut it.\n\n441\n00:23:11.033 --> 00:23:15.345\nLike if I come back over here and\ndo a -E, this is,\n\n442\n00:23:15.345 --> 00:23:20.650\nif you're a Linux guy or girl, you might\nhave done this before as egrep or fgrep.\n\n443\n00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.390\nThere's different greps you can do.\n\n444\n00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.760\nThose are actually being depreciated and\nthey want you to use a dash e or\n\n445\n00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.490\na dash f instead, but\nsame thing I still get nothing.\n\n446\n00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.120\nSo even adding the extended expressions\n\n447\n00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:38.350\ndoesn't give me the ability to use\nthe slash D in this particular case.\n\n448\n00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.840\nTry it, though,\nin your situation that slash D might work.\n\n449\n00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.910\nAnd it's a lot easier than doing open\nbracket, open bracket, colon, digit,\n\n450\n00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.230\nclosed bracket, closed bracket,\ncuz that's technically how you look for\n\n451\n00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.160\na digit in regular expressions.\n\n452\n00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.650\nThis short-hand is a lot easier to write.\n\n453\n00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.830\nBut, since I don't have it,\nwe're going to write it out the long way.\n\n454\n00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.596\nWe're gonna do grep.\n\n455\n00:23:56.596 --> 00:24:02.954\nIt is extended, and\nI'm gonna do open bracket, open bracket,\n\n456\n00:24:02.954 --> 00:24:07.912\ncolon, digit Colon,\nI did a semi-colon there.\n\n457\n00:24:07.912 --> 00:24:08.600\nOops!\n\n458\n00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.170\nA colon close, close.\n\n459\n00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:11.810\nRight?\n\n460\n00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.260\nAnd if we just did this\nlet's see what it would.\n\n461\n00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.550\nRight?\nThere's a lot of things that have digits\n\n462\n00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.670\nin my file.\n\n463\n00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:22.120\nSo, anything that has a digit is\nbeing returned with that expression.\n\n464\n00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.230\nLet's fix that up a little bit though.\n\n465\n00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:29.100\nLet's say, we want not just one digit,\nbut three digits.\n\n466\n00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:36.799\nSo, what I could do is just copy this,\nand paste that three times.\n\n467\n00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:42.739\nAll right, now, it's only gonna get ones\nwhere there's three digits in a row.\n\n468\n00:24:42.739 --> 00:24:46.930\nBut if the three digits in a row here is\nat the end, that one I don't really want.\n\n469\n00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.450\nIs there someway I could\ntell it to look for\n\n470\n00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.340\nthree digits at the beginning of a word?\n\n471\n00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.810\n&gt;&gt; There is, you already told us, Mike.\n\n472\n00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.090\nIt's in the previous episode.\n\n473\n00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.180\n&gt;&gt; I should go back and watch that.\n\n474\n00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.150\nLet's put a carrot out there.\n\n475\n00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.950\nAnd see what that changes.\n\n476\n00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.650\nNow, notice it's only if there's three\ndigits at the beginning of the word,\n\n477\n00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:05.090\nright?, is when it's going to match.\n\n478\n00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.360\nBut let's get back to\nthe Social Security Number,\n\n479\n00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.680\nbecause what I could do is take out this,\n\n480\n00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.210\ncuz maybe my Social Security Number is not\nat the beginning of a particular line.\n\n481\n00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.315\nWhat I could do is just add a dash.\n\n482\n00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:20.610\nNow, I'm saying digit, digit, digit, dash.\n\n483\n00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.610\nLet's see what that changes.\n\n484\n00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.970\nNow, I'm getting closer.\n\n485\n00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:27.702\n&gt;&gt; It looks like you're getting emo.text,\nbut it's just your word wrap.\n\n486\n00:25:27.702 --> 00:25:29.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just scary.\n\n487\n00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.700\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if we can,\nis that a little better?\n\n488\n00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:33.545\n&gt;&gt; That's better.\n\n489\n00:25:33.545 --> 00:25:35.560\n[LAUGH] It's like, Mike,\nkinda weird stuff.\n\n490\n00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.210\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah,\njust take a year I got these weird things.\n\n491\n00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.800\nNot that there's anything wrong with-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n492\n00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.445\n&gt;&gt; Shouldn't say that.\n\n493\n00:25:42.445 --> 00:25:45.058\n[CROSSTALK] It sounds weird.\n\n494\n00:25:45.058 --> 00:25:47.360\nI could go for some blue hair.\n\n495\n00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.740\nAll right, so where was I?\n\n496\n00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.890\nI completely lost my\ntrain of thought there.\n\n497\n00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.250\nSo, now, I'm getting closer,\nbut we do have that.\n\n498\n00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.900\nOne that's similar to a social\nsecurity number, but not quite, right?\n\n499\n00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.570\nThere's three digits to\nthat middle section.\n\n500\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.840\nMaybe that's a part number, or something,\nbut that's gonna throw my results off.\n\n501\n00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.350\nIt's not what I'm look for.\n\n502\n00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:08.490\nSo, I'm gonna need to be a little\nmore specific in my command.\n\n503\n00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:09.850\nWe're gonna take that same command, and\n\n504\n00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.800\nwe'll just this we'll\nwrite the whole thing out.\n\n505\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.878\nWe'll do two more.\n\n506\n00:26:13.878 --> 00:26:18.520\nDash four more, so\n\n507\n00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.940\nthat was saying digit, digit, digit-\ndigit, digit- digit, digit, digit, digit.\n\n508\n00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.650\nAnd ta-da, now I'm finding,\n\n509\n00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:30.660\nat least numbers that have the exact\nsame format as a social security number.\n\n510\n00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.680\nKeep in mind everything I'm saying here,\n\n511\n00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.020\nthere's no guarantee that's\na social security number, right?\n\n512\n00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.340\nI have no context around the number.\n\n513\n00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.590\nThat could be a part number,\nthat could be an employee ID.\n\n514\n00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:44.030\nBut it sure enough follows the same\nformat as social security numbers, so\n\n515\n00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:47.078\nit's getting me what I'm looking for,\nit's getting me close anyway.\n\n516\n00:26:47.078 --> 00:26:51.260\nAll right, let's see,\nI know we're getting short on time.\n\n517\n00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.280\nYou know what?\nWe're gonna have to go into\n\n518\n00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:52.870\nanother one anyway.\n\n519\n00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.160\nSo, I'm not gonna try to rush and\nfinish up.\n\n520\n00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.370\nI'm just gonna keep on\ntrucking at our pace.\n\n521\n00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.770\nSo, cut me off when you need to,\nMr Daniel.\n\n522\n00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:02.620\nAll right, so we've done the repetitions.\n\n523\n00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.450\nLet's tidy this up a little bit.\n\n524\n00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.830\nCuz that is a messy\nlittle expression there.\n\n525\n00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.800\nWe could make it a little\nbit easier to read.\n\n526\n00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.120\nBy doing something like this.\n\n527\n00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.630\nLet's do grep, make sure I want to include\nmy extended regular expressions in\n\n528\n00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.390\nthis case, and we'll do the digit.\n\n529\n00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:25.800\nBut instead of doing digit, digit, digit,\nI'm gonna go open curly brace, three,\n\n530\n00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:30.310\nclose curly brace, dash, digit, but\n\n531\n00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:35.059\nI know that there should\nonly be two digits, dash,\n\n532\n00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:39.260\ndigit open curly for close curly.\n\n533\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.720\nAnd then name of the file\nthat I want to examine.\n\n534\n00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.120\nAnd there's a good same results.\n\n535\n00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.830\nTwo different ways to write that that\ngive me the exact same results, and\n\n536\n00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.430\nthere's many more ways we\ncould actually write that.\n\n537\n00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.540\nBut now, you can see at least it's.\n\n538\n00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.800\nMore like it's on one line.\n\n539\n00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.950\nLet's just maximize this, cuz now,\nI am getting other wraparounds there.\n\n540\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.060\nSome of it I just can't\nhelp there too long.\n\n541\n00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.717\nBut see how we can tidy that up\nby using that opened curly brace,\n\n542\n00:28:05.717 --> 00:28:07.270\nclosed curly brace.\n\n543\n00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:10.250\nInstead of saying three instances,\nI'll just say instance\n\n544\n00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:14.660\ntimes three basically is what those\ncurly braces are gonna do for me.\n\n545\n00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:20.350\nAll right, let's see, that's gonna bring\nus into unknown number of characters,\n\n546\n00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:21.740\nand that might take me a minute or two.\n\n547\n00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.330\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna say,\n\n548\n00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:25.550\nI think this is probably a pretty\ngood stopping spot for us.\n\n549\n00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.790\nSo, you've given us a lot to chew on,\nto feed on, to try to figure out,\n\n550\n00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.350\nwrap our little minds around that.\n\n551\n00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:32.490\nAnd it can take a minute, so\n\n552\n00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.099\nwe don't wanna make you guys\ndrink from a fire hose.\n\n553\n00:28:35.099 --> 00:28:36.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] As it were, right?\n\n554\n00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.520\nRegex is very complex.\n\n555\n00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.290\nIt takes a little bit of getting used to.\n\n556\n00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.824\nSo, this is a good spot for\nthem to simmer in their own juices.\n\n557\n00:28:42.824 --> 00:28:44.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n558\n00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.150\nI like it..\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike.\n\n559\n00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.120\nThanks for joining us today.\n\n560\n00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.390\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n561\n00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:51.170\nWe will be back with a part three,\nour Regex rounding it out.\n\n562\n00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:54.170\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n563\n00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.050\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n564\n00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.812\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n565\n00:28:57.812 -->

00:00:08.267\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:12.203\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:13.755\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:16.807\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.807 --> 00:00:18.490\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n8\n00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.718\nAnd we are back with another episode\nof our CyberSec First Responder series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.718 --> 00:00:25.240\nSay that three times fast.\n\n10\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.280\nAnd, of course, just when you thought\nit was safe to go back to ITProTV,\n\n11\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.350\nwe're back with another round of regular\nexpression with Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.150\nMike, welcome back, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.020\nGlad to have you again.\n\n14\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.867\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\nGlad to be back, and yeah, one more.\n\n15\n00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:39.543\nI promise we'll stop after this.\n\n16\n00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:42.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, but\n\n17\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.898\nwe did have a few more\nexamples really to show you.\n\n18\n00:00:45.898 --> 00:00:49.899\nAnd in some of the operators that\nwe looked at in that first episode.\n\n19\n00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.020\nI wanna make sure we do an example and\nwe can see actually how they are working.\n\n20\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.200\nSo let's continue on.\n\n21\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.260\nWe left off getting ready to talk\nabout unknown number of characters.\n\n22\n00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.410\nSo here we're talking about\nrepetition of a character.\n\n23\n00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.200\nBut we don't know exactly how many.\n\n24\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.270\nWe saw how we could do an open brace,\nI'm sorry not brace.\n\n25\n00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.490\nYeah, open brace, the curly.\n\n26\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.177\nAnd then a digit, and then a close curly.\n\n27\n00:01:15.177 --> 00:01:17.059\nAnd that would give us the same thing.\n\n28\n00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:19.164\nAnd we'll say, look, I'm looking for\nthis many instances.\n\n29\n00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:24.992\nRemember, open brace and\nclose brace, we could do that.\n\n30\n00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:25.770\nBut there's other ways\nwe can do it as well.\n\n31\n00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.851\nEspecially when we don't know how many.\n\n32\n00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:32.165\nBecause the n allowed\nme to specify how many.\n\n33\n00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:33.920\nBut it would only match that number.\n\n34\n00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.358\nWe could do an n,m, where we can say,\nat least this many up to this many.\n\n35\n00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:42.381\nBut what if we just wanna say a lot?\n\n36\n00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:43.762\nIt could be 20, there could be 50.\n\n37\n00:01:43.762 --> 00:01:45.740\nI don't know how many\nrepetitions there are gonna be.\n\n38\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.547\nI can see things like this\nwhen you're doing searches for\n\n39\n00:01:48.547 --> 00:01:55.390\ndirectory traversal, ../ for\nmy directory traversal.\n\n40\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.710\nThat pattern might repeat 1, 2, 5, 20\ntimes as they try to work their way back\n\n41\n00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.016\nup through my file system\nto get to the root.\n\n42\n00:02:02.016 --> 00:02:05.560\nSo that they can work their way\ndown into something they know.\n\n43\n00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.285\nAnd a lot of times, we'll put extras.\n\n44\n00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:11.835\nWe'll just do../ ../ ../ a bunch of times.\n\n45\n00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:14.532\nJust so we can guarantee we've\nmade all the way to the top.\n\n46\n00:02:14.532 --> 00:02:17.740\nAnd then we can work our way back down\nthrough the file structures that we know.\n\n47\n00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.350\nSo looking for repetitions and\nsomething like that.\n\n48\n00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.290\nSo let's take a look\nat how we can do that.\n\n49\n00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.020\nWe'll peek at my screen here.\n\n50\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.910\nAnd the first thing I wanna do is\nI wanna look for repetitions of A.\n\n51\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.560\nNow you can see over here to the left,\nI know it's a little tiny.\n\n52\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.645\nBut I've got just A, AA, AAA, AAAAA.\n\n53\n00:02:36.645 --> 00:02:37.468\nAnd some Bs and\n\n54\n00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:41.660\nsome Cs in there to give us some things\nthat we can try to play around with.\n\n55\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.326\nSo what I wanna do is, let's do a grep.\n\n56\n00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:48.651\nAnd we're gonna start with,\n\n57\n00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:52.980\nthis isn't extended because the syntax\nwe're using is gonna be extended.\n\n58\n00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.387\nLike if I leave off this e and\nI just say a+ and\n\n59\n00:02:57.387 --> 00:03:01.806\nthen go to my file, we don't get anything.\n\n60\n00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:08.260\nNow the + is gonna denote one or\nmore instances of the letter A.\n\n61\n00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.284\nThat's really what it's looking for.\n\n62\n00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:13.020\nBut nothing came back, and that's odd.\n\n63\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.268\nSo let's try putting this -e out there and\nsee what that changes.\n\n64\n00:03:19.268 --> 00:03:20.850\nNow I've got some results.\n\n65\n00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.780\nNot really the results I was looking for,\nbut I do have some results.\n\n66\n00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.050\nSo you're seeing that that syntax there,\nthat +, we're gonna use that or\n\n67\n00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.500\nit's gonna be part of the extended set.\n\n68\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.510\nAnd things like LAN comes\nbecause there is a single A.\n\n69\n00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:37.210\nThere's some double As.\n\n70\n00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.430\nSo everything that's showing up\ndoes have an A somewhere in it.\n\n71\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.310\nBut I'm looking for these guys down here.\n\n72\n00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.209\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nchange that up a little bit.\n\n73\n00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.430\nAnd you guys know what I'm gonna do.\n\n74\n00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.406\nAt this point,\nyou're all experts at regex.\n\n75\n00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:57.480\nAnd you know, hey Mike, why don't you\njust say it's the beginning of the word?\n\n76\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.900\nAnd so I'll put my little caret out front.\n\n77\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.310\nAnd that changes my results,\ngives me more of what I'm looking for.\n\n78\n00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.780\nAnd a lot of regex expression\nbuilding is this is how it works,\n\n79\n00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.770\nit's trial and error.\n\n80\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.800\nBuild, build, get close,\nget closer, get closer.\n\n81\n00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.820\nBoom, and you finally hit your target.\n\n82\n00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.263\nSo it is building up these expressions\nuntil you're just fluent in it.\n\n83\n00:04:16.263 --> 00:04:17.665\nAnd then maybe you're gonna whip one out.\n\n84\n00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:21.736\nBut I find that I don't\ndo it often enough.\n\n85\n00:04:21.736 --> 00:04:24.020\nThat I really do have to pick away at it.\n\n86\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is maybe\nlike shooting a bow and arrow.\n\n87\n00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.160\nYou get the target off there.\n\n88\n00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.960\nYou shoot, you aim, you hit a little high.\n\n89\n00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.701\nWell, you readjust, and you shoot.\n\n90\n00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:34.530\nYou aim a little lower,\nbut not quite on target.\n\n91\n00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.892\nYou're continuing to refine your aim\nusing the different expressions.\n\n92\n00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:39.115\nAnd we talked about that before.\n\n93\n00:04:39.115 --> 00:04:42.960\nBut it really is the lifeblood\nof using regular expression.\n\n94\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.645\nYou're gonna write some\nexpressions a few times.\n\n95\n00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:51.280\nLook at the output and go, okay,\nI need to take this out and take that out.\n\n96\n00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.830\nIt usually is not like crafted right\nout of the gates, perfect regex,\n\n97\n00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.580\nunless it's something very simple.\n\n98\n00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.975\n&gt;&gt; Or you've done it a bunch of times or\nsomething like that.\n\n99\n00:04:59.975 --> 00:05:02.574\nCuz remember when we're looking for\nthe Social Security numbers and\n\n100\n00:05:02.574 --> 00:05:03.700\nmy expression looked great.\n\n101\n00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.254\nIt should match a Social Security number,\nboom, and it did.\n\n102\n00:05:07.254 --> 00:05:10.773\nBut I didn't think about part numbers\nthat followed a very similar format.\n\n103\n00:05:10.773 --> 00:05:13.810\nBut had ten numbers after the last\ndash instead of just four.\n\n104\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.673\nThose are the things that pop up.\n\n105\n00:05:14.673 --> 00:05:17.750\nAnd you go,\nI didn't think about that possibility.\n\n106\n00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.240\nLet's add something in my expression\nto make sure that doesn't come up.\n\n107\n00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.057\nAll right, so there's your a+.\n\n108\n00:05:23.057 --> 00:05:26.479\na+ is saying, any number of As,\n\n109\n00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.010\none or more As in a row,\nwhich is what we see.\n\n110\n00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.690\nThere's the single A, but then all of\nthese have multiple As in them as well.\n\n111\n00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.095\nWe could string these together.\n\n112\n00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:42.470\nWhat if I was looking for, and\nwe'll just bring that last command back.\n\n113\n00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.792\nLet's say we want Bs.\n\n114\n00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:47.200\nWe're starting with As to start the word.\n\n115\n00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.985\nAny number of As, it doesn't matter.\n\n116\n00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:50.455\nThen there's gonna be a B.\n\n117\n00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:55.471\nAnd I'll say, any number of Bs,\nat least one or more Bs.\n\n118\n00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:57.022\nAnd then there should be some Cs in there.\n\n119\n00:05:57.022 --> 00:06:02.650\nI don't know how many, but\nwe'll just say one or more Cs.\n\n120\n00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.734\nNotice none of these show up anymore.\n\n121\n00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:11.272\nBecause there is multiple As, but\nthere is not Bs and Cs following them.\n\n122\n00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:16.928\nSo now I'm getting just the AAAABCCC and\nthe AAABBBBC.\n\n123\n00:06:16.928 --> 00:06:18.506\nSay that one three times fast.\n\n124\n00:06:18.506 --> 00:06:20.393\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, but\n\n125\n00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:22.459\nit didn't get that last one.\n\n126\n00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:25.186\nSee this last one, there's no Bs in there.\n\n127\n00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:26.608\nTheres As and Cs.\n\n128\n00:06:26.608 --> 00:06:28.760\n&gt;&gt; That didn't meet\nthe requirement of the expression.\n\n129\n00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz the +, you've gotta keep\nthis in mind, the + is one or more.\n\n130\n00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.000\nIs there something that does zero or more?\n\n131\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.410\nYes, there is.\n\n132\n00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.570\nRemember our good old *?\n\n133\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.430\nLet's change that to an * and\nsee what happens.\n\n134\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.801\nNow I get it cuz I'm saying one or\nmore As, zero or\n\n135\n00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:53.089\nmore Bs, followed by one or more Cs.\n\n136\n00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:55.600\nAnd now, all of a sudden, that finds it.\n\n137\n00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.344\nSo when you're looking for unknown number\nof characters, you're gonna use your + and\n\n138\n00:07:00.344 --> 00:07:02.923\nyour * depending on what\nyou're looking for.\n\n139\n00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:06.330\nAll right,\nlet's do talk about optional characters.\n\n140\n00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.613\nI almost gave this one away when we\nwere working on the IP address ranges.\n\n141\n00:07:10.613 --> 00:07:15.133\nBut a question mark,\nwhich means several things as we've seen,\n\n142\n00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:17.610\ncan also make something optional.\n\n143\n00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.883\nSo if we did something like this.\n\n144\n00:07:19.883 --> 00:07:21.108\nLet's do grep for, and\n\n145\n00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:25.980\nwe'll do our extended because the question\nmark's gonna be part of my extended set.\n\n146\n00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.810\nWe'll do the capital E and the word files.\n\n147\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.520\nAnd you got to tell it\nwhat file to grep or\n\n148\n00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.670\nit will not do what you want it to do and\ntake a while doing it.\n\n149\n00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.254\nSo there we go, we did the word files.\n\n150\n00:07:40.254 --> 00:07:45.000\nAnd I can see I've found 7 files,\n15 files, no files.\n\n151\n00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.102\nBut if I look at my test, I know my\nsheet here, there's also one file found.\n\n152\n00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:55.770\nSince there was one, the word files was\nsingular and it was just file, no s.\n\n153\n00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.889\nI wanna find all of those.\n\n154\n00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:01.137\nI need to know, do I log file anytime\nsomeone was searching for a file or\n\n155\n00:08:01.137 --> 00:08:03.952\nthere was one, whether it was 15 or 100.\n\n156\n00:08:03.952 --> 00:08:07.291\nBut the message changes if\nit's only a single one.\n\n157\n00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:10.220\nSo how do I account for that?\n\n158\n00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:16.080\nWell, one way you can do it cuz there\nare many ways we can do it, is to do this.\n\n159\n00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.320\nPut a question mark after the S.\n\n160\n00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.310\nAgain, think back to our first episode\nwhen we used these modifying characters\n\n161\n00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.660\nlike this or operators It's only referring\nto the character in front of it,\n\n162\n00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.860\nnot the entire word as\nwe like to think of it.\n\n163\n00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.902\nIt's a word according\nto regular expressions.\n\n164\n00:08:31.902 --> 00:08:35.200\nAnd a word according to regular\nexpressions in this case will be the s.\n\n165\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.686\nThat is the word we're doing.\n\n166\n00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:43.760\nSo this is gonna say anything that's f,\ni, l, e and then an s or maybe not an s.\n\n167\n00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.743\nQuestion mark is optional.\n\n168\n00:08:44.743 --> 00:08:45.790\nLet's see what that does.\n\n169\n00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:52.304\nAnd now I noticed that one file comes\nup as well as the one that have files.\n\n170\n00:08:52.304 --> 00:08:56.960\nAnd you can put that anywhere\nin this expression, all right.\n\n171\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.160\nLet's do this.\n\n172\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.160\nLet's clear my screen just\nto get a little height here.\n\n173\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.330\nLet's bring that back and what if\nwe put a question mark right there?\n\n174\n00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.561\nNow we are saying the F is optional and\nthen there is gonna be an I,\n\n175\n00:09:14.561 --> 00:09:18.173\nan L, an E, and then maybe an S,\nmaybe not an S.\n\n176\n00:09:18.173 --> 00:09:18.811\nAll right?\n\n177\n00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:24.642\nAnd now we found a lot things\nwe found no files found.\n\n178\n00:09:24.642 --> 00:09:26.650\nIt's interesting why that\ndidn't want to come up.\n\n179\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.821\nThat didn't come up on the other one,\ndid it?\n\n180\n00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:29.617\nI have to look at that.\n\n181\n00:09:29.617 --> 00:09:31.770\nAlso found no piles found either.\n\n182\n00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.216\nMy little sense of humor there.\n\n183\n00:09:34.216 --> 00:09:38.720\nAnd it found some other thing, failed\nbecause, why did that one get found?\n\n184\n00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.890\nLet's see.\n\n185\n00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.417\nThere's an ile right there, right?\n\n186\n00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:49.540\nThe capital, the F is optional, the S\nis optional, the ILE has to be there.\n\n187\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.970\nAnd sure enough in the word failed.\n\n188\n00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.295\nSo you can kind of see it's fun to\nplay around with regular expressions.\n\n189\n00:09:53.295 --> 00:09:57.632\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you get some weird results from\ntime to time when you play with reg ex and\n\n190\n00:09:57.632 --> 00:10:01.320\ngo, why the heck is that that's\nit I see what I did right there.\n\n191\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.899\n&gt;&gt; Exactly I am curious though lets go\nback to that first one I should trouble\n\n192\n00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:05.849\nshoot this later.\n\n193\n00:10:05.849 --> 00:10:09.439\nBut okay I just didn't notice it,\nit did find the no files found,\n\n194\n00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:11.020\nI thought that was missing.\n\n195\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.090\nI was like that should of matched.\n\n196\n00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.292\nAll right so there we see the question\nmark is giving us those optional,\n\n197\n00:10:17.292 --> 00:10:21.914\nmaking it optional We can do this like\nwith the IP address ranges which I'll try\n\n198\n00:10:21.914 --> 00:10:23.052\nto show you later.\n\n199\n00:10:23.052 --> 00:10:26.920\nYou might say cuz an IP could have\nthree digits or two digits right.\n\n200\n00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.422\nIt could be a 100 dot or a 10 dot,\nand we have to account for that and\n\n201\n00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:37.368\nso the first range would be open\nbracket 0 dash 9 close bracket\n\n202\n00:10:37.368 --> 00:10:42.340\nquestion mark, and\nthen open brackets 09, close bracket.\n\n203\n00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.940\nProbably a question mark for that one too,\ncuz it could be a single digit.\n\n204\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.809\nBut then the last of the last character\nset wouldn't have a question mark.\n\n205\n00:10:48.809 --> 00:10:51.630\nSo now it could be one digit,\ntwo digits, or three digits.\n\n206\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.080\nAnd so we use the question mark,\nthe optional, quite a bit as well,\n\n207\n00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.720\ngoing through long files all right.\n\n208\n00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.370\nLet's talk about white space.\n\n209\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.990\nAnd I will tell you that white\nspace is one of the ones that\n\n210\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.440\nfrustrates me sometimes.\n\n211\n00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.910\nIt can be tricky to work with.\n\n212\n00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.602\nBut we do have some characters that\nwill allow me to work with white space.\n\n213\n00:11:10.602 --> 00:11:16.291\nThat was that s, the little s,\nnot the capital S.\n\n214\n00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:18.817\nThat represents white space\nwhich could be a space.\n\n215\n00:11:18.817 --> 00:11:22.249\nCould be a tab,\ncould also be a line of return.\n\n216\n00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:24.583\nWhen we're talking about white space.\n\n217\n00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:29.048\nSo, let's try to find,\nin my text file here I've got some,\n\n218\n00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:31.251\nwhat are we looking for here?\n\n219\n00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:38.462\nLet me flip over to that and really\ndown here I wanna look at these guys,\n\n220\n00:11:38.462 --> 00:11:45.700\nand I know these are really tiny on\nyour screen but it',s there we go.\n\n221\n00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.240\nI've got my cursor right\nin the middle of that.\n\n222\n00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.450\nBut you can see that I've got\nkinda like an ordered list there.\n\n223\n00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:50.900\nBut those are separate lines.\n\n224\n00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.280\nBut there's different amounts\nof space between those.\n\n225\n00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.340\nSome of them have a single space,\nthe second one has two spaces,\n\n226\n00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.260\nthe third one has a tab, and\nthe fourth one has no space at all.\n\n227\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.450\nSo let's see what happens when we play\naround with our regular expressions and\n\n228\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.130\nthose crazy guys down there.\n\n229\n00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.260\nAll right, we're gonna do grep.\n\n230\n00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.140\nThis is part of my extended set or\nthe syntax I'm using.\n\n231\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.770\nAnd for this one,\nwhen we're working with my white space,\n\n232\n00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.850\nI've found that I need\na single quote around these.\n\n233\n00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.200\nAlthough I will tell you sometimes,\n\n234\n00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.160\nand sometimes not,\na very frustrating part about this.\n\n235\n00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.955\nThat's why you just experiment and\nplay with your regular expressions.\n\n236\n00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:30.704\nSo I'm gonna say all right let's say,\n\n237\n00:12:30.704 --> 00:12:34.200\nwe get the first digit is\ngonna be a 0 through 9.\n\n238\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.500\nThere's a bulleted list out there,\none, two, three, four so 0 through 9.\n\n239\n00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.040\nAnd then that's gonna be followed by\na dot, because my bulleted list has a, or\n\n240\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.600\nmy numbered list,\nI shouldn't say bulleted list.\n\n241\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.123\nMy numbered list,\nmy ordered list has a dot, right one dot.\n\n242\n00:12:49.123 --> 00:12:53.374\nSo I do need to put a dot, but I can't put\njust a dot, I have to escape the dot, or\n\n243\n00:12:53.374 --> 00:12:54.310\nthe period.\n\n244\n00:12:54.310 --> 00:13:02.510\nSo I do \\., and\nthen I'm gonna do \\s for white space.\n\n245\n00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:08.042\nAnd then we'll put, what did I use,\nxyz for this one, yeah, xyz.\n\n246\n00:13:08.042 --> 00:13:12.078\nAnd then I'll end my quote,\ntell it what file we're gonna look at, and\n\n247\n00:13:12.078 --> 00:13:13.034\nsee what we get.\n\n248\n00:13:13.034 --> 00:13:17.115\nAnd, interesting results for\nthis one, right, because the s\n\n249\n00:13:17.115 --> 00:13:22.450\nrepresents white space which again can\nbe a space, a tab or line character.\n\n250\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.060\nSo, I get the one number one.\n\n251\n00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.386\nThat's a single space in front\nof the x there after the period.\n\n252\n00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:29.150\nMakes sense that that matches.\n\n253\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.660\nThe 3 actually has a single tab there So\ndoes that that matches.\n\n254\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.459\nBut the 2 had two spaces and\nthat one didn't match, why?\n\n255\n00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:43.150\nWell because the / s is saying\na white space character.\n\n256\n00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.070\nThat white space character could\nbe a space, could be a tab but\n\n257\n00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.570\nnot two spaces right.\n\n258\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.900\nthat would be two white space characters.\n\n259\n00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.690\nWe'll see what happens.\n\n260\n00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.246\nLet's see if what Mike is saying is true.\n\n261\n00:13:53.246 --> 00:13:58.284\nWhat if I add another s?\n\n262\n00:13:58.284 --> 00:14:00.892\nBut the tab didn't come up,\nor the three dot, and\n\n263\n00:14:00.892 --> 00:14:03.080\nthen the whole bunch of spaces in the xyz.\n\n264\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.340\nWhy didn't that one come up?\n\n265\n00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.000\nThere's more space there\nthan there was with the 2.\n\n266\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.050\nBut that was a single tab\nnot two tabs right so\n\n267\n00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.700\nI'm saying two white space\ncharacters whatever they are.\n\n268\n00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.270\nThis is again where it can really\nthrow you off cuz your like\n\n269\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.540\nwhy is that not coming up?\n\n270\n00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:23.770\nBecause whoever made that file did\na space and a tab so you gotta do two Ss.\n\n271\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.640\nIt will drive you nuts sometimes.\n\n272\n00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.812\nWe could also do something like this.\n\n273\n00:14:28.812 --> 00:14:31.974\nWhat if I wasn't sure, and\nI wanted to account for\n\n274\n00:14:31.974 --> 00:14:35.150\nthe different number of\nwhite space characters.\n\n275\n00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.470\nIt could be one space.\n\n276\n00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:37.550\nCould be two spaces.\n\n277\n00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.370\nCould be a tab.\n\n278\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.620\nCould be two tabs.\n\n279\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.890\nCould be a tab and a space.\n\n280\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.240\nHeck, I don't know.\n\n281\n00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.210\nHmm, do we have anything in\nour books that does that?\n\n282\n00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.223\nOne or more, zero or more.\n\n283\n00:14:47.223 --> 00:14:50.172\nWait, the plus and the asterisk, right?\n\n284\n00:14:50.172 --> 00:14:52.198\nLet's see what happens when\nI throw those in there.\n\n285\n00:14:52.198 --> 00:14:58.002\nLets take out the second s and\njust say, +, all right?\n\n286\n00:14:58.002 --> 00:14:59.214\nLet's see what we get.\n\n287\n00:14:59.214 --> 00:15:01.826\nNow we're getting what we wanna see.\n\n288\n00:15:01.826 --> 00:15:03.610\nI'm saying, any number.\n\n289\n00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.760\nWell the plus is actually saying one or\nmore instances of white space.\n\n290\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.450\nSo that would matter if they tabbed and\nspaced or they tab tabbed or\n\n291\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.650\nspace space tab space space I\nwould still find those results.\n\n292\n00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.270\nYou could do the asterisk as well which\nwould say 0 or more maybe you're thinking\n\n293\n00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.710\nthat sometimes they didn't put any tabs\nat all or spaces at all, they goofed up.\n\n294\n00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.989\nLet's see what that does.\n\n295\n00:15:28.058 --> 00:15:32.167\nLook, now I get the 4.xyz,\ncuz remember, the asterisk is 0 or\n\n296\n00:15:32.167 --> 00:15:37.734\nmore instances of the preceding character,\nin this case, the white space character.\n\n297\n00:15:37.734 --> 00:15:38.270\nAll right?\n\n298\n00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.900\nSo again, playing around with these,\ntaking these switches that we're learning,\n\n299\n00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.050\nthese operators, I should say, more\ntechnically correct, and combining them.\n\n300\n00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.396\nIn cool ways to come up\nwith these expressions.\n\n301\n00:15:48.396 --> 00:15:53.317\nThat's where the power comes in when\nyou start combining the operators to\n\n302\n00:15:53.317 --> 00:15:58.154\nget exactly, as Daniel said, to turn\nthat axe into the scalpel where you\n\n303\n00:15:58.154 --> 00:16:02.938\ncan really cut this up apart and\nfind exactly what you're looking for.\n\n304\n00:16:02.938 --> 00:16:07.025\nAll right, just a couple more and then\nwe're gonna take a look at some full blown\n\n305\n00:16:07.025 --> 00:16:11.880\nexpressions and try to decipher them just\nbecause we love torture around here.\n\n306\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.380\nAll right, so let's talk about the,\n\n307\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.860\nwe've already seen this actually,\nthe beginning and the end, the carrot.\n\n308\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.530\nFor the beginning the dollar sign for\nthe end.\n\n309\n00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.520\nLet's just do a real quick example though.\n\n310\n00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.220\nI'm gonna say grep,\n\n311\n00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:33.230\nlet's just grep fail first and\nsee what we get.\n\n312\n00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:39.930\nRejects file and\nI get service start fails, failed log in.\n\n313\n00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.504\nSo you see I get anytime the word failed\nis in there no matter where it is.\n\n314\n00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:48.050\nIf we change that up,\nhowever, with that caret,\n\n315\n00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.820\nyou guys know what's going to\nhappen at this point, right?\n\n316\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.300\nI just get the one where failed is at the\nbeginning, or I could do my dollar sign,\n\n317\n00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:00.220\nand I'll just get the one\nwhere failed is at the end.\n\n318\n00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.770\nAnd I'll tell you, those come into play\na lot it's one of those things where,\n\n319\n00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.130\nwhy am I getting these other results?\n\n320\n00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.490\nI'm getting what I want but I'm getting\na whole bunch of other stuff as well.\n\n321\n00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.370\nThese two right here, the caret and\nthe dollar will really help you filter out\n\n322\n00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:18.520\nthe unwanted results many,\nmany times so know those guys.\n\n323\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.709\nLast one I wanna show you\nis the conditional or.\n\n324\n00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.890\nThe or statement is the pipe.\n\n325\n00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.820\nAnd the pipe is just the way, again,\nbasically, insert the word or in there.\n\n326\n00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:35.260\nIf we do grep something like DNS.\n\n327\n00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.410\nHow can I show you guys\nwhat we have first?\n\n328\n00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.210\nWell you can kinda see it.\n\n329\n00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.162\nLet's just look over here.\n\n330\n00:17:42.349 --> 00:17:45.634\nSo there I can see down at\nthe very bottom DNS started,\n\n331\n00:17:45.634 --> 00:17:48.940\nDHCP started, DNS stopped, rain started.\n\n332\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.070\nYeah, there's something random in there.\n\n333\n00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.080\nLet me zoom back out and see what we\ncan do with our regex expressions,\n\n334\n00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.040\nI'm gonna get off the bottom here.\n\n335\n00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.740\nAnd let's do grep, and\n\n336\n00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:09.070\nwe'll do dns|dhcp' regex and\n\n337\n00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:14.710\nI get a whole lot of nothing, and\nthat's because I didn't escape the pipe.\n\n338\n00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:15.300\nHere we go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n339\n00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.420\n&gt;&gt; Special characters, man.\n\n340\n00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.720\nThey'll get you every time.\n\n341\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.305\nEvery time!\n\n342\n00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:20.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Dan here's like, watch this!\n\n343\n00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.262\nIt's not gonna work!\n\n344\n00:18:21.262 --> 00:18:21.762\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll say.\n\n345\n00:18:21.762 --> 00:18:22.552\nHere comes the crash and\n\n346\n00:18:22.552 --> 00:18:23.192\nburn right here.\n[LAUGH]\n\n347\n00:18:23.192 --> 00:18:25.072\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you for that, sir.\n\n348\n00:18:25.072 --> 00:18:25.940\nI will get you back.\n\n349\n00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.918\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Your faceplant is well-documented now.\n\n350\n00:18:27.918 --> 00:18:30.385\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm turning red\nhere just a little bit.\n\n351\n00:18:30.385 --> 00:18:34.240\n[LAUGH] All right so let me put my\nbackslash in front of that pipe character\n\n352\n00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.870\nand see if our results change any bit and\nsure enough there we go.\n\n353\n00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:45.720\nSo now I'm saying it could be DNS or\nDHDP is what I'm looking for.\n\n354\n00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.000\nAnd we could get more complex,\nlike what if i just want it stopped?\n\n355\n00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.950\nWe could throw some white space in\nthere and then the word stopped.\n\n356\n00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.740\nAlthough, I will tell you,\nit can be frustrating.\n\n357\n00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.580\nLike, here's a good example.\n\n358\n00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.160\nLet's just do this.\n\n359\n00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.710\nI'll show you the frustration\nyou can go through.\n\n360\n00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.665\nSo far, makes sense.\n\n361\n00:19:03.665 --> 00:19:07.630\ndns/pipedhcp.\n\n362\n00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.080\nLet's do stopped though.\n\n363\n00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.270\nI only want to see if one\nof these services stopped.\n\n364\n00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.970\nI don't care if it started.\n\n365\n00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.960\nThat's not gonna work\nbecause it sees stopped\n\n366\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.180\nas the filename that I'm looking for.\n\n367\n00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.990\nIt thinks my regular expression ends here.\n\n368\n00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:25.320\nSo then we'll go and we'll say,\nthat's what it is, I gotta get this\n\n369\n00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.190\nlittle quote guy outside so it says,\nthat's a whole one big thing there.\n\n370\n00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.450\nYeah, that didn't work either.\n\n371\n00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:39.110\nI got DNS, but then I got it started or\nstopped, but no DHCP.\n\n372\n00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.270\nBecause what it's saying is it's\neither DNS or DHCP stopped.\n\n373\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.970\n&gt;&gt; Stopped.\n\n374\n00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:44.900\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's seeing that.\n\n375\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.190\nSo I'm like, groups!\n\n376\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.280\nThat's what we can do.\n\n377\n00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.190\nWe'll throw groups in there,\nwe can fix this.\n\n378\n00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.890\nNow we know what we're doing.\n\n379\n00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.600\nWe're gonna put our\nparentheses around there.\n\n380\n00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.790\nWe'll throw that around there.\n\n381\n00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.446\nNow we get a whole lot of nothing.\n\n382\n00:19:58.446 --> 00:20:02.940\nWe can try brackets, we can try brace,\nwe can sit here and bang our heads and\n\n383\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.160\nsay what the heck is going on?\n\n384\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.543\n&gt;&gt; I assume you would have to do\nsome kind of conditional inside\n\n385\n00:20:08.543 --> 00:20:13.025\nof a conditional where you're\nlike DNS stopped or started.\n\n386\n00:20:13.025 --> 00:20:17.310\nOr, dhcp stopped or started and\nit starts getting complex.\n\n387\n00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.540\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what you would do.\n\n388\n00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.120\nYou would end up doing\nmultiple ors in there.\n\n389\n00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.810\nBut let me show you a shortcut.\n\n390\n00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:23.760\nWhere, you know what?\n\n391\n00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.890\nForget all that.\n\n392\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.134\nI already have one that works,\n[LAUGH] close to what, yeah.\n\n393\n00:20:28.134 --> 00:20:31.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So let's get back to this one.\n\n394\n00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.280\nAnd that says okay so\nthat gives me dns or dhtp.\n\n395\n00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.640\nThat's what I wanted.\n\n396\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.670\nBut it gives me started and stopped,\nand I only want to see stopped.\n\n397\n00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.380\nI can't do it this way,\nwhat if I did this?\n\n398\n00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.008\nTake the one that works,\npipe that into grep.\n\n399\n00:20:46.008 --> 00:20:49.137\n[LAUGH] Stopped.\n\n400\n00:20:49.137 --> 00:20:50.480\nTa-da.\n\n401\n00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.850\nHow about that, right?\n\n402\n00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.616\nThere is nothing wrong with\ngrepping it more than once.\n\n403\n00:20:55.616 --> 00:21:01.620\nSometimes that is a whole lot easier to\nwrite two separate regular expressions,\n\n404\n00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.450\nthan to try to make one\ncomplex regular expression.\n\n405\n00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.230\nSo if you think about it this way,\nyou're starting with the entire log file.\n\n406\n00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.490\nThe first grep regular expression\nis filtering it down, but\n\n407\n00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.180\nthen you're saying, okay.\n\n408\n00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.140\nWe're gonna run you through\nanother filter, and\n\n409\n00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.230\nmake my reach result set even smaller.\n\n410\n00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.180\nAnd so I can just start\ncombining them that way, and\n\n411\n00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.960\nI'll tell you in the end It\nbecomes even more easier to read\n\n412\n00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.030\nas well as works just fine so\nI prefer this method sometimes.\n\n413\n00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike and I were talking about,\nshould you go with a really\n\n414\n00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.340\nsophisticated regex that does exactly\nwhat it is you're looking for it to do?\n\n415\n00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.380\nBut, ten months later when you come\nback and go what was that regex I wrote?\n\n416\n00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.940\nYou're looking at it and\ngoing I have no idea what this thing does.\n\n417\n00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.937\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n418\n00:21:41.937 --> 00:21:43.933\nyou have to kind of\ndecipher your own code.\n\n419\n00:21:43.933 --> 00:21:46.340\nOr make it more readable,\nfor not only yourself but\n\n420\n00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.920\nother people that are gonna see it,\nto be able to reuse it.\n\n421\n00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.950\nI want to land on the fence of\nits being more usable, right.\n\n422\n00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.310\nThat people that don't know what I'm\ndoing can look at it very easily and\n\n423\n00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.220\nat a glance tell that does this.\n\n424\n00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.940\nThat's exactly what I needed to do.\n\n425\n00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:06.760\nI'm going to steal that and use it versus\nthis complex hieroglyphics of regex\n\n426\n00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.320\nexpression that's going crazy even though\nit does exactly what you need to do and\n\n427\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.860\nnobody can tell what the heck it does.\n\n428\n00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAnd\n\n429\n00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:17.130\nthere's nothing that say that each regex\nexpression is its own expression, so\n\n430\n00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.330\nit can be as complex or\nas light as you want it at.\n\n431\n00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:24.840\nWe could have come over here and\nsaid all right, let's grep, stopped.\n\n432\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.520\nNow this example doesn't make sense,\ncuz we already had these results.\n\n433\n00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.310\nBut just to show you that you could do it,\nI could do something like this,\n\n434\n00:22:33.201 --> 00:22:38.288\nRight, and now I'm back to getting all\nthree of them, because I'm saying,\n\n435\n00:22:38.288 --> 00:22:43.630\nit's either dns or dhcp, but\nthen it's also either stopped or started.\n\n436\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.640\nAll right, as you can see how you\ncan combine it and one of the things\n\n437\n00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.860\nI like about doing this method is,\nhow easy it is to change as well.\n\n438\n00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:55.660\nLike what if, we had this one I said you\nknow what I do need to see which one\n\n439\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:01.110\nstarted not stopped, easy enough, I just\nchange that one word, you know what.\n\n440\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.979\nI need to change the services I liked\nthe stopped, but I need to look for\n\n441\n00:23:04.979 --> 00:23:05.973\nother services.\n\n442\n00:23:05.973 --> 00:23:08.561\nLet me just add another.\n\n443\n00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:13.991\nAnd I have it rain and stopped,\nso let's change that to started,\n\n444\n00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:18.750\nand I get dns started,\ndscp started, and rain started.\n\n445\n00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:25.410\nSo you can see how I can take the or,\nand have as many ors as I need, right?\n\n446\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.580\nSo again get in there, play around\nwith these, try combining them.\n\n447\n00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:34.560\nThere's great websites out there\nwhere you can do a live thing,\n\n448\n00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.820\nI found a bunch of them that will\ngive you, here's five lines,\n\n449\n00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.500\nwe want you to match these three, but not\nthese two, here's a live field to type in,\n\n450\n00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.140\nand it will show you as you're typing it,\nwhether you're succeeding or not.\n\n451\n00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.790\nA great way to practice.\n\n452\n00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:52.255\nThere's lots of cheat sheets\nout there that you can get for\n\n453\n00:23:52.255 --> 00:23:55.377\nregex to help you get\nfamiliar with these switches.\n\n454\n00:23:55.377 --> 00:24:00.564\nAll right,\nlast thing I want to do is take a look\n\n455\n00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:05.229\nat a couple of Expressions, there it is.\n\n456\n00:24:05.229 --> 00:24:07.764\nAll right,\nwe remember these we were looking at.\n\n457\n00:24:07.764 --> 00:24:10.290\nI don't know if we actually\nsolve this drawing yet.\n\n458\n00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.910\nSo let's just talk about it,\nwe've already kinda seen this.\n\n459\n00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.810\nIt's talking about building\nof a regular expression.\n\n460\n00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:19.120\nOr as Daniel was saying,\nwe hit the target but\n\n461\n00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.630\nwe wanna slowly work our way\ninto that bullseye there.\n\n462\n00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:25.370\nSo it's saying, all right, the first\noctet is static, 188, no big deal.\n\n463\n00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.240\nThen we need a dot, but\nit has to be escaped.\n\n464\n00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.010\nAnd then the second octet is known static,\nthe third octet is known.\n\n465\n00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:32.600\nSo we just keep going there.\n\n466\n00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:38.040\nAnd then the last octet, we're not sure,\nright, that's the one that could vary.\n\n467\n00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.680\nI want to find all\nthe entries in my log file.\n\n468\n00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.303\nFrom 188.24.122.0/24, so\n\n469\n00:24:44.303 --> 00:24:48.982\nthis number could be anything\nfrom one to 254, right?\n\n470\n00:24:48.982 --> 00:24:56.550\nSo what they're doing is they're saying,\nall right open brace one comma three.\n\n471\n00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.710\nSo any range from one to three digits.\n\n472\n00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.750\nYou see they put this \\d in there for\ndigit.\n\n473\n00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:07.730\nNow keep in mind if your version\nunsupport the short hand switch d,\n\n474\n00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.610\nI can replace that with open bracket,\n\n475\n00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:14.110\nopen bracket digit colon digit\ncolon close bracket close bracket.\n\n476\n00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.780\nAnd then all the curly brace one comma\nthree and that would work just fine.\n\n477\n00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.860\nAll right, now, let's take a look, we\nnever did that actual IP address either.\n\n478\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.070\nAlthough I think they do have an example\nof it that I can show you here.\n\n479\n00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.600\nLet's zoom in just we bid on this one.\n\n480\n00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.990\nAnd just a couple of examples\nthat logical operators calls at.\n\n481\n00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.340\nAnd again, it's a good practice\ncuz we can look at these and\n\n482\n00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.980\ngo, can I see what this\nis actually going to do?\n\n483\n00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.990\nBecause on the exam that's\nwhat you're gonna get.\n\n484\n00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.560\nYou're not gonna be\ncreating the expression,\n\n485\n00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.510\nthey're gonna give you expressions and\nyou got to make sure you understand\n\n486\n00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:46.150\nwhat that expression is\nactually going to return.\n\n487\n00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.370\nSo, in this case they've got error4/i,\n\n488\n00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:55.140\nthe 4/i is making a case insensitive or\nignored case is what that's for.\n\n489\n00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:00.395\nSo, you can see it matches the word error,\neven though there is capital E there.\n\n490\n00:26:00.395 --> 00:26:07.190\nMallius one two three, slash dot, or\nbackslash dot backslash W one comma four.\n\n491\n00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.110\nNow what the heck is that looking for?\n\n492\n00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:15.669\nWell, it's gonna match the name\none mallius one two three dot,\n\n493\n00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:20.270\nand then my little W is\n\n494\n00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:25.630\nsaying word, one through four digits long,\n\n495\n00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.750\ncuz my extension basically could be three\nor four characters of what they're saying.\n\n496\n00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:35.880\nSo it would match mallius123.bat.,\nalright.\n\n497\n00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.610\nThis one used to search for\nemail address, I know what that done.\n\n498\n00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:47.230\nSo, here they're saying remember the plus\nis one or more instance all right.\n\n499\n00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.180\nYeah, plus is one.\n\n500\n00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.870\nSometimes they get those confused,\nplus and asterisk.\n\n501\n00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:56.792\nThe plus of one origin is a dot and\nthen the @ symbol.\n\n502\n00:26:56.792 --> 00:26:58.140\n&gt;&gt; But that's not negated though, so\n\n503\n00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.930\nit must be a special character\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n504\n00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, at the beginning of that,\nthat dot is not negated out.\n\n505\n00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.150\n&gt;&gt; You know,\nI honestly think this might be a typo\n\n506\n00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:11.250\nbecause you wouldn't normally look for\na dot in front of the @ symbol.\n\n507\n00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:11.780\n&gt;&gt; Agreed.\n\n508\n00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.164\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n&gt;&gt; Agreed.\n\n509\n00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:16.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think this might be\na little bit of a typo here, or\n\n510\n00:27:16.485 --> 00:27:19.060\nit could be something that they're doing.\n\n511\n00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.060\nIn this case there is a dot, right?\n\n512\n00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.200\nIn the E, but\nnormally you're not looking for that.\n\n513\n00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.760\nSo my guess is this is a bit\nof a mistake on the slide,\n\n514\n00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.430\nwe have to experiment around and\nthen we could test it out, but\n\n515\n00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:34.660\nthen there's an @ symbol and then\nthere's another data, and you know what?\n\n516\n00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.730\n&gt;&gt; No, it is definitely,\nit's the wild card, yeah.\n\n517\n00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.140\n&gt;&gt; It's the wild card,\nit's not the peer, silly me.\n\n518\n00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.989\nI'm sitting and\ngoing why are they putting that there?\n\n519\n00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:44.855\nThe fun of regular expressions.\n\n520\n00:27:44.855 --> 00:27:46.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is my wild card, so\n\n521\n00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.250\nsaying any number of characters.\n\n522\n00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.920\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Is really what they are saying.\n\n523\n00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.730\nAnd then the @ symbol and\nthen any number of characters,\n\n524\n00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.410\nlike the dot is the wild card.\n\n525\n00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:58.510\nAnd it has to be at least one, cuz\na valid email address would have at least\n\n526\n00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.852\none character out in\nfront of that @ symbol.\n\n527\n00:28:00.852 --> 00:28:02.466\nA @microsoft.com, right.\n\n528\n00:28:02.466 --> 00:28:07.845\nThere has to be some characters\nafter the @ symbol, right.\n\n529\n00:28:07.845 --> 00:28:12.538\nThe domain for the email address,then they\nare saying should be a dot now they have\n\n530\n00:28:12.538 --> 00:28:16.210\nescaped it,so this is actual dot\ncharacter not the wild card and\n\n531\n00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.740\nthen some characters,either A through Z.\n\n532\n00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.640\nTwo to four instances of A through Z, so\n\n533\n00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:29.529\nthe last could be dot com, dot TV,\n&gt;&gt; Dot AU, whatever.\n\n534\n00:28:29.529 --> 00:28:33.700\n&gt;&gt; Dot AU, I'm trying to think\nof a four dot, dot party.\n\n535\n00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.323\nThat's five- that's\nthe new top of the band so\n\n536\n00:28:35.323 --> 00:28:36.552\nyou'd have to do two-\n&gt;&gt; dot TV.\n\n537\n00:28:36.552 --> 00:28:39.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, dot TV for two.\n\n538\n00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.870\nYeah, what is a- what is a four?\n\n539\n00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.050\n&gt;&gt; I don't know Vinnie.\n\n540\n00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:47.730\n&gt;&gt; WWW3.\nNo that's the beginning.\n\n541\n00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:49.170\nWhat am I thinking?\n\n542\n00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I can't think of anything off top\n\n543\n00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.210\nof my head.\n\n544\n00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:56.060\n&gt;&gt; There are a bunch of new\nones that dot me, dot party,\n\n545\n00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.120\ndot blah bla blah, I don't even know so.\n\n546\n00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.680\nDown below that here's one looking for\nthe date and were not gonna.\n\n547\n00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.748\nI know were about out of time so I think\nwe've seen enough examples of what we need\n\n548\n00:29:06.748 --> 00:29:09.660\nto do, is be able to interpret these and\nit can be tricky,\n\n549\n00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.080\nyou do have to spend a little time.\n\n550\n00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.180\nLet me see if I can find the one, let's do\nthis one and then I'll find the one for\n\n551\n00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.440\nthe IP address as well,\n\n552\n00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.840\ncause this one kinda shows a good example\nof some groupings and some ors in here.\n\n553\n00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.390\nSo what it's saying is,\nin this inner group, right?\n\n554\n00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.480\nI've got a, we've got a month day year.\n\n555\n00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.900\nAnd if you think of them about\nthe month format, right, two digits for\n\n556\n00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.870\nthe month well the first, it could be\nthe second month or the third month.\n\n557\n00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.240\nHow does that format look?\n\n558\n00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.210\nZero one if it's a two digit month format.\n\n559\n00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.570\nSo the first character is gonna be a zero.\n\n560\n00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.800\nAnd then the second character\ncould be a one through nine.\n\n561\n00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.840\nThat would cover January, February,\nMarch, April, May, June, July,\n\n562\n00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.700\nAugust and September.\n\n563\n00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:56.440\nOr there'll be a one out in front and\nthen a zero, which would be October.\n\n564\n00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.520\nBut then we got November and\nDecember, 11 and 12.\n\n565\n00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.864\nSo one followed by either a zero,\none or two.\n\n566\n00:30:01.864 --> 00:30:06.180\nThere's no three,\nbecause there is no month thirteen, right?\n\n567\n00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.370\nSo it's saying one of these.\n\n568\n00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:10.350\nSo you see how you're accounting for\nall possibilities.\n\n569\n00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:15.800\nBut instead of trying to do it in one\ncomplex expression, they're just saying,\n\n570\n00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.120\nhey, let's look for all the months\nthat have zero in front of it,\n\n571\n00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.960\nand then let's do an or, and look for all\nthe months that have a one in front of it.\n\n572\n00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.370\nThey kind of break it up into two parts,\nand make it a lot easier to work with.\n\n573\n00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:29.057\n&gt;&gt; Of course this example won't\nwork if someone uses 2/24.\n\n574\n00:30:29.057 --> 00:30:32.190\nThey have to do the 02 or\nit's not going to work.\n\n575\n00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthat's where I come out here and\n\n576\n00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.600\nhave to put the question\nmark right after that zero.\n\n577\n00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.710\nSo I'm saying there might or\n\n578\n00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:43.420\nmight not be a zero and then a one\nthrough nine possibility, right?\n\n579\n00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.160\nSo we can start combining those things up.\n\n580\n00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.250\nAnd then they escape the slash and\ndo the same thing for\n\n581\n00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:51.320\nthe dates, again accounting for\nall possibilities.\n\n582\n00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.410\nZero one through 31 days in a month.\n\n583\n00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:58.430\nSo, zero one through nine, so that'd be\ndays zero through nine, and then one,\n\n584\n00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:01.530\nand then some digit,\nbecause it could be anything.\n\n585\n00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:06.690\nNotice instead of doing a one to nine,\nthey just did a digit, right?\n\n586\n00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.650\nWhich they could have done here as well.\n\n587\n00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.630\nSo that would be, what, 10 through 19.\n\n588\n00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:15.537\nAnd then a 2/d,\nthat'd be day 20 through 29.\n\n589\n00:31:15.537 --> 00:31:20.571\nAnd then a three, and\nit went back to the open closed bracket\n\n590\n00:31:20.571 --> 00:31:25.720\nbecause it can't be a two,\nthere's no day 32 to day 34.\n\n591\n00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.620\nSo it's three open bracket zero one\nclosed bracket closed parenthesis.\n\n592\n00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.490\nClose the entire parenthesis for\nthat whole set and then a slash and\n\n593\n00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.910\nthen dealing with a year.\n\n594\n00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:38.010\nAnd then one more, let's take a look,\nI think I've got an IP.\n\n595\n00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:42.520\nMaybe I don't have an IP address range\nin here, my computer's locked up.\n\n596\n00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.020\nOops, that was it, there it is.\n\n597\n00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.700\nWe've seen that, when there's a URL,\n\n598\n00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:55.221\nthat's a good one to look at.\n\n599\n00:31:55.221 --> 00:31:56.086\nGod, I can't get my computer to\nplay along with me, there we go.\n\n600\n00:31:56.086 --> 00:31:59.057\nYou can see they're doing\nopen parenthesis http or\n\n601\n00:31:59.057 --> 00:32:03.689\nhttps colon Forward slash forward slash\nand that looks really weird when look at\n\n602\n00:32:03.689 --> 00:32:07.367\nit right.Back slash forward\nslash back slash forward slash.\n\n603\n00:32:07.367 --> 00:32:13.762\nThey're escaping each one of those\nforward slashes and then dot asterisk.\n\n604\n00:32:13.762 --> 00:32:16.396\n&gt;&gt; Which is wildcard.\n\n605\n00:32:16.396 --> 00:32:21.650\n&gt;&gt; Which is my wild card because\ncan be any number of characters.\n\n606\n00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:25.690\nAnd then dot with the backslash,\nso that's the period, right,\n\n607\n00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.640\nthe name .com or .edu or gov.\n\n608\n00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.150\nSo here they're accounting for\nthat domain, but\n\n609\n00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:36.415\nthen they're also accounting for\nsubdomains in there.\n\n610\n00:32:36.415 --> 00:32:40.955\nYou can see they've got another\nforward slash, which is escape for\n\n611\n00:32:40.955 --> 00:32:45.895\nthe back slash, and then dot asterisk and\nthen optionally more than that, right?\n\n612\n00:32:45.895 --> 00:32:49.900\nThere's another back slash\noptional dot asterisk, so\n\n613\n00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.745\nagain learning to interpret these is,\ncan I say fun?\n\n614\n00:32:53.745 --> 00:32:55.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n615\n00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:57.020\nYeah, that's what it is, fun.\n\n616\n00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.292\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right,\nwhen we start looking for\n\n617\n00:33:00.292 --> 00:33:04.104\nIP addresses again it can\nget just as complex here.\n\n618\n00:33:04.104 --> 00:33:07.383\nYou could see they are saying,\nall right for Class C's,\n\n619\n00:33:07.383 --> 00:33:11.790\nreally the key here is to think\nabout what are all the possibility?\n\n620\n00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.610\nHow do I account for\nall the possibilities?\n\n621\n00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.060\nAnd what are they trying to do?\n\n622\n00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.350\nSearch for all Class C IP addresses,\nso they're saying (19[2-9],\n\n623\n00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:27.310\nso really what they should\nsay is all private range.\n\n624\n00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.759\nNo that's not right.\n\n625\n00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:31.190\nAnyway, yeah.\n\n626\n00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.898\nSo one, nine and then two to nine.\n\n627\n00:33:33.898 --> 00:33:39.171\nHere they've got their open parentheses\nand they're gonna do a \\ dot and\n\n628\n00:33:39.171 --> 00:33:45.150\nthen a digit, one through three digits,\nbut there should be three of those.\n\n629\n00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.960\nSo a little shortcut syntax there.\n\n630\n00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:52.518\nThey're saying the digit can be anything,\nthere's gonna be at least or\n\n631\n00:33:52.518 --> 00:33:54.473\nit could be one through three.\n\n632\n00:33:54.473 --> 00:33:56.454\nNo, what are they saying there?\n\n633\n00:33:56.454 --> 00:34:00.534\nI take that back, what they're doing\nhere is they're saying at least one,\n\n634\n00:34:00.534 --> 00:34:02.332\nup to three instances of a digit.\n\n635\n00:34:02.332 --> 00:34:07.150\nAnd then they're saying this whole thing\ncould repeat three times, all right.\n\n636\n00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:11.450\nAnd then they're or and then they account\nfor anything that starts with a two and so\n\n637\n00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:12.960\non and so forth.\n\n638\n00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.590\nPlaying around with these,\ntrying to match IP addresses and\n\n639\n00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:20.290\nvalid IP addresses, you can end\nup with a pretty long expression.\n\n640\n00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:23.355\nBut the best thing to do is just get\nin there and try and see what happens.\n\n641\n00:34:23.355 --> 00:34:27.516\n&gt;&gt; Wow, I can't even say the word right.\n\n642\n00:34:27.516 --> 00:34:30.750\nIt's that offescating so\n\n643\n00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.540\nmangling of the tongue of the mind\nit just twists you into a pretzel.\n\n644\n00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.406\nRegular expression,\nnot one of my favorite things to do.\n\n645\n00:34:36.406 --> 00:34:37.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Probably not gonna\n\n646\n00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.590\nbe one of your favorite things.\n\n647\n00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:42.040\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it is, there are guys out\nthere that just live and breathe regex.\n\n648\n00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.480\nAs you could see, it's almost like a\nseparate language that's being interpreted\n\n649\n00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.740\nby another language that's being\nreinterpreted by yet another language.\n\n650\n00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.830\nIt's a very twisty for\n\n651\n00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:56.420\nthe mind, it definitely drives\nme bonkers from time to time.\n\n652\n00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.040\nI know it does the same thing for Mike.\n\n653\n00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.650\nBut it's something we got to know, right?\n\n654\n00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.530\nSo you need at least some\npassing familiarity with it.\n\n655\n00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:03.920\nEspecially if you wanna pass this exam,\n\n656\n00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.700\nthey're gonna chuck something\nat you about reg x.\n\n657\n00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.360\nYou need to have that level of knowledge,\nso\n\n658\n00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.900\nthat you can answer those questions,\nand get past that.\n\n659\n00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.381\nAnd then as you start working in\nthe business using this kind of stuff,\n\n660\n00:35:15.381 --> 00:35:18.102\nit'll pop it's ugly little\nhead up from time to time.\n\n661\n00:35:18.102 --> 00:35:20.340\nSo you have to be able to\nwork your way around it.\n\n662\n00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:24.319\nMike, thanks for you, you did walk us\nthrough quite a bit of this thing,\n\n663\n00:35:24.319 --> 00:35:25.436\nhow to work with it.\n\n664\n00:35:25.436 --> 00:35:27.980\nHow to use it from what\nMike has shown you,\n\n665\n00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.710\nyou should be able to get very\nversed if you were so inclined.\n\n666\n00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.640\nHe gave you a lot of good\ninformation on working with regex.\n\n667\n00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.094\nWe do appreciate that, and\nwe do appreciate you guys for watching,\n\n668\n00:35:37.094 --> 00:35:39.085\nstruggling through it if\nthat's what you were doing.\n\n669\n00:35:39.085 --> 00:35:42.380\nOr just loving every last second of\nit if that's what you were doing.\n\n670\n00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:47.240\nBut it is has come that time yet again for\nus to sign off with you, a fond farewell.\n\n671\n00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.410\nThanks for watching for ITPROTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n672\n00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:51.320\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n673\n00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.798\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n674\n00:35:52.798 --> 00:35:59.983\n[MUSIC]\n\n675\n00:35:59.983 -->

00:00:16.380\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.575\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode guess what, we're back more for\n\n8\n00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:22.505\nour CyberSec First Responder series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:26.368\nAnd joining me in this studio is\nthe head of flock of Seagulls Fan Club.\n\n10\n00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:28.354\n&gt;&gt; That is our good friend,\nMr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:30.755\nMike welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.755 --> 00:00:32.309\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Going great Daniel,\nglad to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.432\nYeah, one of the first concerts I saw,\nI'll date myself there.\n\n14\n00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:37.587\nAnyway yes-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:39.539\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everybody.\n\n16\n00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.292\nWe're gonna be looking at today how\nwe can analyze incidents in a Windows\n\n17\n00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:44.100\nenvironment.\n\n18\n00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.399\nI just wanna go over a couple tools that\nthey call out on the objectives that we\n\n19\n00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.546\nshould be familiar with.\n\n20\n00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:53.406\nAnd that we'll probably end up using out\nin the real world once we get beyond\n\n21\n00:00:53.406 --> 00:00:58.290\nour logical operations, CyberSec\nFirst Responder Certification Exam.\n\n22\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.295\nSo let's start by taking\na look at my screen here.\n\n23\n00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:04.960\nI've got my Windows VM opened up, and the\nfirst tool I wanna show you is regedit.\n\n24\n00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.480\nNow, regedit is a tool that's been\naround for as long as I can remember.\n\n25\n00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.569\nIt allows me to go in and view,\nand manipulate registry entries.\n\n26\n00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.858\n&gt;&gt; So you can edit the registry,\nif you will.\n\n27\n00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:17.354\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:17.854\n&gt;&gt; It's crazy.\n\n29\n00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:19.538\nI mean you never would have guessed that\n\n30\n00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:24.368\nfrom the name of the tool, right, regedit.\nIn fact, that's what I'm gonna type in\n\n31\n00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:27.567\nR-E-G-E-D-I-T.\nAnd I'll let it, yes,\n\n32\n00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:31.886\nI want to allow this to make changes.\nAnd let me collapse some things up, so we\n\n33\n00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:36.350\ncan see what it looks like when you first\nget in there normally and there we go.\n\n34\n00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.960\nThe registry again,\nis just a collection of files.\n\n35\n00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.137\nThis tool kind of reaches out and\ntouches all those different files,\n\n36\n00:01:43.137 --> 00:01:45.643\npulls it all together,\nmakes it look like it's under one thing.\n\n37\n00:01:45.643 --> 00:01:50.411\nIt's not a single file or a single\ndatabase, but several files located\n\n38\n00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:55.830\nprimarily c:windowssystem32config,\nthat's where most of the files are.\n\n39\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.826\nThere is one however,\nlocated in your user profile.\n\n40\n00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:03.020\nEnd to user.dat, each user on\nthe system will have a file there.\n\n41\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.937\nBut we don't really go\ndirectly to those files,\n\n42\n00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:07.759\nusually they're locked anyway when\nthe operating system is running.\n\n43\n00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.337\nWe use tools like this to work with it,\nand\n\n44\n00:02:10.337 --> 00:02:15.210\nthere are literally thousands,\nthousands of settings within the registry.\n\n45\n00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.390\nYou're not gonna go through\nevery single one most likely,\n\n46\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.100\nmost of them are not gonna be\nimportant to your investigation.\n\n47\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.260\nBut there are a few keys that I definitely\nwanna look at, maybe I can glean a little\n\n48\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.540\nbit of information about what's\nbeen going on, on that system.\n\n49\n00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.548\nAll right,\nthe registry is organized into hives.\n\n50\n00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:37.580\nEach one of these would\nbe considered a hive.\n\n51\n00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.570\nAnd then within those hives,\nwe have keys and values.\n\n52\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.450\nA key is a setting that I can change.\n\n53\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.250\nThe value is what I've set that key to,\nand\n\n54\n00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.540\nthen we have different data types as well.\n\n55\n00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.654\nThe value is gonna actually be made\nup of different types of data.\n\n56\n00:02:56.654 --> 00:03:00.985\nBut to us, what I wanna show you here is\na couple of places they call on the exam.\n\n57\n00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:03.882\nPlaces we should go,\nif we're looking for like I said,\n\n58\n00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:06.670\nevidence of what's been going on,\non this machine.\n\n59\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.037\nSo we're gonna start\nunderneath h key current user.\n\n60\n00:03:10.037 --> 00:03:13.135\nAll right, these are the settings for\nwhoever is currently logged on.\n\n61\n00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:16.964\nThis is a dynamic key or hive,\nif it gets loaded up when you log on.\n\n62\n00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:18.907\nSomebody else logs on the machine,\n\n63\n00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:22.830\nit's a different HKEY_CURRENT_USER\nthat gets loaded up.\n\n64\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.899\nI'm gonna expand that HKEY_CURRENT_USER,\nand\n\n65\n00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:32.966\nthen we're gonna go down into Software\n&gt; Microsoft, if I can spell there.\n\n66\n00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:33.562\nDid I go into the right one?\n\n67\n00:03:33.562 --> 00:03:35.464\nThere we go.\nI've already got it expanded out.\n\n68\n00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:42.800\nSoftware &gt; Microsoft, and then Windows,\nand then Current Version, right?\n\n69\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.965\nYou can see Windows and\nthen Current Version.\n\n70\n00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:48.205\nAnd then you wanna go in\nunderneath Explorer, right?\n\n71\n00:03:48.205 --> 00:03:54.173\nAnd underneath explore I'm gonna\nfind a node called comdlg32.\n\n72\n00:03:54.173 --> 00:04:01.580\nAnd inside here, there's a couple of what\nwe call MRUs, this are most recent used.\n\n73\n00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.235\nAnd if I click on one, like for example,\nif I wanna see executable files and\n\n74\n00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:11.370\npaths that have been used recently,\nI can look at this last visited, right?\n\n75\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.378\nMRU, and if I take a look,\nI could double-click on one of these.\n\n76\n00:04:14.378 --> 00:04:19.460\nAnd I know it's tiny, it's a little hard,\nI can't really make it any bigger.\n\n77\n00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.630\nBut here, I can see that it looks\nlike I launched PowerShell recently,\n\n78\n00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.600\nwhich I have, right?\n\n79\n00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.421\nIf I close that one and\ntake a look at this next entry down here,\n\n80\n00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:31.492\nthere I can see Notepad, right?\n\n81\n00:04:31.492 --> 00:04:35.059\nObviously this machines not compromised\nthere's nothing crazy going on.\n\n82\n00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.033\nBut now you get an idea of what\ninformation I might be able to\n\n83\n00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.290\nglean from exploring this particular key.\n\n84\n00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.565\nAnd looking at these values here,\nI can see what somebody was running.\n\n85\n00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:48.465\nIf I wanna see what OP files\nwere opened and saved recently,\n\n86\n00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:52.833\nwell there's one called Open save PID,\nprocess ID MRUs, right?\n\n87\n00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:56.149\nIf I expand that out I could go\ndown to say, executables, and\n\n88\n00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:58.815\nI could double click on one of these guys.\n\n89\n00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:02.420\nAnd here I can see,\nlook somebody was running F_port,\n\n90\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.390\nthat might be of interest to me.\n\n91\n00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:11.056\nIf I go down to the next one here,\nlooks like somebody was running system32,\n\n92\n00:05:11.056 --> 00:05:15.299\nthat's another notepad.exe example, right?\n\n93\n00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:20.850\nSee if I can see, yeah, right down\nthere I can see notepad.exe, right?\n\n94\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.410\nReally difficult to read, not ideal I\nknow, especially for displaying on here.\n\n95\n00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.832\nWhat I say is go to a Windows machine,\ntype in regedit, and explore.\n\n96\n00:05:28.832 --> 00:05:32.220\nDon't make changes unless\nyou've backed it up first.\n\n97\n00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.290\nIf this is a true forensics investigation,\n\n98\n00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.810\nI probably wouldn't be\nworking with a live system.\n\n99\n00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.220\nI'd be working with\nan image we had made and\n\n100\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.530\na forensically sound copy of the drive.\n\n101\n00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.265\nAnd then I'd extract those\nregistry files out, and\n\n102\n00:05:44.265 --> 00:05:46.635\nuse a different tool to\nbe able to read those.\n\n103\n00:05:46.635 --> 00:05:53.830\nBut on a live system, registry editors,\nhow I can explore the registry?\n\n104\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.040\nA couple of the places,\nwe looked under the comdlg32.\n\n105\n00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.990\nThere's also one if we go\nback up under Explorer,\n\n106\n00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.575\nthere's one called\nRun MRU just right here.\n\n107\n00:06:04.575 --> 00:06:09.508\nAnd this is gonna be commands that were\nlaunched from the run dialogue box.\n\n108\n00:06:09.508 --> 00:06:13.010\nYou do the Windows key + R, and here,\n\n109\n00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.340\nI can see right there that\nI launched WordPad, right?\n\n110\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.880\nDifferent from if I had actually gone\nto my Start menu and launched WordPad.\n\n111\n00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.252\nSo this is gonna show me things that\nwere launched from that Run dialog box,\n\n112\n00:06:27.252 --> 00:06:31.616\nand then there's also one\ncalled Recent Docs, right here.\n\n113\n00:06:31.616 --> 00:06:36.650\nAnd we can see there's a few different\nkeys or a lot of entries in here.\n\n114\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.336\nThis is actually where in your Windows\nExplorer, when you see your recently used\n\n115\n00:06:40.336 --> 00:06:43.767\nfiles, or when you go to an application\nit shows you, the last used files.\n\n116\n00:06:43.767 --> 00:06:47.670\nThis is where that information\nis coming from, right?\n\n117\n00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.050\nAnd I could say, go down to text and see\nwhat some of those recently used files.\n\n118\n00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.862\nThere's one called asdf.txt,\n\n119\n00:06:54.862 --> 00:06:58.171\nthat's what I name all my little\ntest files that I'm doing.\n\n120\n00:06:58.171 --> 00:07:00.236\nCuz it's just right,\na little roll with the fingers there.\n\n121\n00:07:00.236 --> 00:07:03.468\nSo again, you're seeing some\nreally good information.\n\n122\n00:07:03.468 --> 00:07:05.850\nI mean not on this system,\nit's not compromised.\n\n123\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.550\nBut now think about the possibility if\nI was looking at compromised system,\n\n124\n00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.750\nthis is where I might go and\nfind some good information, right?\n\n125\n00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.294\nLike I said, there are other tools,\nRegDump is a really popular one.\n\n126\n00:07:17.294 --> 00:07:21.960\nThis is a tool that I can use to\nextract that registry information.\n\n127\n00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:28.062\nAnd then open up those .reg files and\nread through it on an image of a registry,\n\n128\n00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:31.218\nif we have pulled that information out.\n\n129\n00:07:31.218 --> 00:07:35.227\nAnother tool they call out is\nsomething called Autoruns, and\n\n130\n00:07:35.227 --> 00:07:38.710\nI've got that guy installed\nhere somewhere as well.\n\n131\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.970\nWhere did I stick that guy?\n\n132\n00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.652\nThere it is.\nThis one is a tool that's gonna show me\n\n133\n00:07:44.652 --> 00:07:49.470\nkind of a live view of what's\ngoing on in the registry.\n\n134\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.234\nI can see it's a little\neasier to read at least, but\n\n135\n00:07:52.234 --> 00:07:54.368\nyou can see a lot of the different keys.\n\n136\n00:07:54.368 --> 00:07:58.743\nWhat's really cool about this one is,\nit's helping me look through and\n\n137\n00:07:58.743 --> 00:08:03.692\nlook for anything that's maybe out of\nthe ordinary, that potentially could be,\n\n138\n00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.073\nSome type of malware.\n\n139\n00:08:05.073 --> 00:08:06.144\nCuz that's really what we're doing.\n\n140\n00:08:06.144 --> 00:08:09.930\nWhen we go in the registry, we're trying\nto find things that don't belong.\n\n141\n00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.880\nKeys that have been made by some\nmalware that shouldn't be there,\n\n142\n00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.320\nentries for users that shouldn't be there.\n\n143\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.285\nAnd one of the cool things about this\ntool in particular is you can right\n\n144\n00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:27.437\nclick on one of these entries and\nyou can actually say check virus total.\n\n145\n00:08:27.437 --> 00:08:31.907\nLet's see if it'll let me do, I think it\ntook away my internet access on this VM.\n\n146\n00:08:31.907 --> 00:08:33.370\nYeah, so it can't find it, but\n\n147\n00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.029\nit'll actually let you submit\nthings out to Virus Total,\n\n148\n00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:39.896\nwhich is a really cool website where they\nkeep hashes for all these different files.\n\n149\n00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:44.640\nAnd they can tell you if this is a known\ngood file or a known piece of malware.\n\n150\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.900\nPretty neat tool there as well.\n\n151\n00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.620\nThat's from Systernals.\n\n152\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.840\nSo this is from Microsoft.\n\n153\n00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.810\nAnd you can see,\nwe're not gonna go through it again.\n\n154\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.450\nWe're not trying to learn this tool,\njust wanna show you that its available.\n\n155\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:58.559\nThere are a lot of tabs you can take\na look at if you go to logon tab.\n\n156\n00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:00.480\nYou've got explore.\n\n157\n00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.740\nI can see.\n\n158\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.510\nAnd I probably don't have\nanything under some of these.\n\n159\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.160\nWhat's another good one to look at?\n\n160\n00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.980\nKnown DLLs, all right, well here's some.\n\n161\n00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.130\nIt's telling me it\nactually can't find those.\n\n162\n00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:18.060\nWinlogon, so potential source of\ninformation on a Windows system.\n\n163\n00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.070\nOther tools that we're probably\nalready familiar with.\n\n164\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.470\nTools like Wireshark, what if I need\nto look at the network for Information.\n\n165\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.060\nIf I'm trying to find\ninformation about an incident.\n\n166\n00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:35.310\nWireshark is the defacto packet caps\nutility allows me to sniff the network.\n\n167\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.710\nHopefully, we've seen that before.\n\n168\n00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.670\nBut let me go ahead and fire that up.\n\n169\n00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.340\nBasically, with Wireshark, you tell it\nwhat network adapter you wanna listen on.\n\n170\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.150\nI'm gonna choose my WAN interface there,\nit's what I called my network adaptor.\n\n171\n00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.381\nAnd I'll click my start button and\nit'll start capturing packets.\n\n172\n00:09:51.381 --> 00:09:54.325\nAnd so I can look for\nprotocols that don't belong or\n\n173\n00:09:54.325 --> 00:09:57.070\nI can start intercepting traffic.\n\n174\n00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.130\nIf I see an unusual amount of\nFTP traffic leaving my network.\n\n175\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:07.842\nMaybe I'm worried about data exfiltration,\nsomebody sending out data from my systems.\n\n176\n00:10:07.842 --> 00:10:09.890\n&gt;&gt; Plus malware loves to phone home,\nright?\n\n177\n00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.400\nSo you just fire up Wireshark and\n\n178\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.840\nyou're like what's this conversation\nthat's just happening right here?\n\n179\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.400\nTake a look at that data,\nsee where it's grabbing out to.\n\n180\n00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.170\nI'm not contacting any Russian servers\nright now, why is this doing that?\n\n181\n00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.246\nYou kind of look that conversation\non find out what's going\n\n182\n00:10:26.246 --> 00:10:30.660\non it's Wirehark is definitely a very,\nit does a lot of things.\n\n183\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.012\nIt does a lot of good things and\nit does it really well.\n\n184\n00:10:33.012 --> 00:10:36.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Wireshark will let me\ncapture those network packets and\n\n185\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.990\nI can view What's going across my network,\nagain looking for\n\n186\n00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:47.120\nstrange protocols or an unusual\namount of a particular protocol.\n\n187\n00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.140\nAnd as well as capturing the packets and\nseeing where they're coming from,\n\n188\n00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.790\nwhere they're going to, what they're\npayload is if they're not encrypted,\n\n189\n00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.750\nwe can read all of that\nright out of Wireshark.\n\n190\n00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.440\nAnother packet capture\nutility we have available is.\n\n191\n00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:06.450\nWell, actually let's talk about, Netstat\nis another one they call out on the exam.\n\n192\n00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.190\nAgain, these are tools\nwe've probably used before,\n\n193\n00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:15.030\njust never thought about using it\nmaybe as an incident investigation.\n\n194\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:20.200\nBut Netstat shows me my, and\nlet's do a little differently there.\n\n195\n00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:26.310\nLet's do a little dash an All right,\nit's gonna show me my ports that are open.\n\n196\n00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.060\nWhat ports I'm listening on.\n\n197\n00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.630\nThis is a great place to go if you\nthink there's malware on a system.\n\n198\n00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:35.045\nAnd it's listening for\na back door type thing.\n\n199\n00:11:35.045 --> 00:11:36.365\nYou can see those ports open.\n\n200\n00:11:37.635 --> 00:11:38.305\nOther tools.\n\n201\n00:11:38.305 --> 00:11:41.055\nThey call out IP Config,\nI'm not gonna show you IP Config.\n\n202\n00:11:41.055 --> 00:11:44.315\nI hope you've run that before\nat this level in your career.\n\n203\n00:11:44.315 --> 00:11:48.855\nNMAP is one that we can use if we\nwanna do port scans on a system.\n\n204\n00:11:48.855 --> 00:11:53.175\nSee what ports are open, I need to know if\nthere's any ports that shouldn't be open.\n\n205\n00:11:53.175 --> 00:11:55.919\nEverything I've been talking about so\nfar, notice I'm saying.\n\n206\n00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.864\nWe need to know what shouldn't be there or\ntrying to find,\n\n207\n00:11:59.864 --> 00:12:02.838\nwe have to have a baseline, I guess,\nis what I'm trying to get at.\n\n208\n00:12:02.838 --> 00:12:05.764\nIf you don't know what port\nshould be open on the systems,\n\n209\n00:12:05.764 --> 00:12:09.970\nrunning end map after an incidence and\ngoing, look at this ports are open!\n\n210\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.218\nIt probably won't do you that much good.\n\n211\n00:12:12.218 --> 00:12:15.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've gotta be able\nto pick out what's, one of\n\n212\n00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.200\nthese things is not like the other, right,\none of these things does not belong.\n\n213\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.150\nHow do you know what doesn't belong\nif you don't already have an idea\n\n214\n00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.960\nof what should be there?\n\n215\n00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.810\nI love the way a counterfeiters always\ntalked about the best way to spot\n\n216\n00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.660\na forgery is to know the original\nlike the back of your hand.\n\n217\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.420\nAnd so that's kinda what we're doing here.\n\n218\n00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.113\nWe should know what the system looks\nlike like the back of our hand.\n\n219\n00:12:34.113 --> 00:12:39.348\nBecause we're constantly surveying,\nknowing things that should go on, and\n\n220\n00:12:39.348 --> 00:12:45.320\nthen when we run that MMAP scan we go\nthat's a strange port, 63,002 is open.\n\n221\n00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:45.860\nWhy is that open?\n\n222\n00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:46.870\nThat shouldn't be open.\n\n223\n00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.639\nI never see that.\n\n224\n00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:50.830\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nyou gotta have that baseline.\n\n225\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.642\nOther tools they call out that\nwe should know what they do.\n\n226\n00:12:53.642 --> 00:12:59.552\nNmap, again, is a port scanner, tracert or\ntrace-RT, however you wanna say that.\n\n227\n00:12:59.552 --> 00:13:02.390\nI'm gonna run that on my machine\nhere if you wanna take a look.\n\n228\n00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.890\nActually, I don't know that\nI have Internet access,\n\n229\n00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:12.160\nlets see if I had taken that\naway from this machine.\n\n230\n00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.170\nNo, I got some DNS resolution, so\nwe'll let that go but it's gonna give me\n\n231\n00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:21.160\ninformation about each hop and\nthe path on the way to the destination.\n\n232\n00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.730\nAnother good one to know,\nis the old NET command,\n\n233\n00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.550\nthis is a old one been around for ever.\n\n234\n00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.330\nWhich it uses primarily to map drives,\nright?\n\n235\n00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.597\nNET USE.\n\n236\n00:13:30.597 --> 00:13:33.820\nBut there are several commands\nyou can use with NET.\n\n237\n00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.630\nYou can see them listed here.\n\n238\n00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.753\nAs far as this particular topic goes,\nthe ones I might be using\n\n239\n00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:46.959\nare gonna be NET STATISTICS, The ones\nI might be using are net local group,\n\n240\n00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:51.085\nhacker dash, [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, and\n\n241\n00:13:51.085 --> 00:13:53.841\nyou can see when I run net statistics.\n\n242\n00:13:53.841 --> 00:13:58.130\nIt says I can get it on the server or\nthe workstation, so let's do server.\n\n243\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.600\nAnd again, not a lot going on\non this particular machine but\n\n244\n00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.660\nI can see session information.\n\n245\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.450\nNumber of sessions I have,\nhow many have timed out.\n\n246\n00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:13.120\nAmount of data sent and received,\nfiles accessed, print jobs spooled.\n\n247\n00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:19.320\nIf we do the work station, you get\na little bit different information.\n\n248\n00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.490\nBytes received, transmitted,\nread and write operations,\n\n249\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.480\nnetwork errors, connections made.\n\n250\n00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.620\nSo again, this is just a little\nbit more information I can gather\n\n251\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.840\nabout what's going on in this machine.\n\n252\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:38.050\nLooking for something unusual or\nout of the normal information.\n\n253\n00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:38.810\nNBT Stat.\n\n254\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:45.850\nNetBios over TCP-IP Statistics\nis another one that we can use.\n\n255\n00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.184\nLet's do a -C.\n\n256\n00:14:47.184 --> 00:14:49.390\nI probably don't have much going on here.\n\n257\n00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.490\nThese are gonna be your NetBIOS name\ncaches where I can see where it's\n\n258\n00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.745\nresolved NetBIOS names into IP addresses.\n\n259\n00:14:56.745 --> 00:14:57.475\nBut this is important.\n\n260\n00:14:57.475 --> 00:15:01.755\nThis could show me what machines this\nmachine was trying to connect to, right?\n\n261\n00:15:01.755 --> 00:15:03.265\nWe think there's been an incident.\n\n262\n00:15:03.265 --> 00:15:06.665\nWe can see, look, it was reaching out and\ntalking to that database server or\n\n263\n00:15:06.665 --> 00:15:08.325\nthat web server.\n\n264\n00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:10.835\nIt gives me that kind of information.\n\n265\n00:15:10.835 --> 00:15:13.186\nWhen it comes to file system information,\n\n266\n00:15:13.186 --> 00:15:15.734\nanother place we can\nlook to get information,\n\n267\n00:15:15.734 --> 00:15:19.939\nmost people are familiar with the dir\ncommand or the D-I-R for directory.\n\n268\n00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:21.530\nWe can get that listing.\n\n269\n00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.562\nWhat a lot of people don't know is there\nare actually a few switches you can use\n\n270\n00:15:25.562 --> 00:15:29.608\nwith the dir command, all right,\nthat'll give you even more information.\n\n271\n00:15:29.608 --> 00:15:33.692\nIf I go into, let's do cd Documents, and\n\n272\n00:15:33.692 --> 00:15:38.730\ntake a look,\nI can see I've got some files in here.\n\n273\n00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:44.505\nI've got, well, actually one file,\none called adsdemo.txt.\n\n274\n00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.755\nWhat if I do a dir /,\n\n275\n00:15:49.755 --> 00:15:54.036\nlet's do AS, all right.\n\n276\n00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:56.280\nAnd you see I get some different results,\nright.\n\n277\n00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:01.774\nIf we scroll back up to the help,\nwe'll see that A allows me to apply some\n\n278\n00:16:01.774 --> 00:16:08.420\nDifferent filters to my results, and the s\nis going to show me system files right.\n\n279\n00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.747\nI can do an h for hidden file, and\n\n280\n00:16:11.747 --> 00:16:17.184\nwe can do another neat one\nwithout the a is just the r.\n\n281\n00:16:17.184 --> 00:16:19.720\nThis one is going to display\nalternate data screens.\n\n282\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.440\nWe'll talk about that in just a second.\n\n283\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.540\nAnother good one to know is the q.\n\n284\n00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.870\nShows the owner of the file.\n\n285\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.487\nSo if we do a dir /q, right?\n\n286\n00:16:29.487 --> 00:16:33.940\nYou'll see out here, it tells me who the\nowner is of, in that case, that directory.\n\n287\n00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:38.230\nThis one's owned by the system,\nthis file is owned by my user account.\n\n288\n00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:44.560\nSo a few different switches you can\nactually use with the DIR command.\n\n289\n00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.140\nThe R was for alternate data streams, and\nalternate data streams are an interesting\n\n290\n00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.570\nguy, I could probably do\na show on just those.\n\n291\n00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.398\nBut NTFS allows for something\ncalled alternate data streams, and\n\n292\n00:16:54.398 --> 00:16:56.175\nit's not the only file system that does.\n\n293\n00:16:56.175 --> 00:16:59.796\nIt's really designed to store\nmetadata about the file, but\n\n294\n00:16:59.796 --> 00:17:02.200\nmost people don't know it exists.\n\n295\n00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.140\nAnd we can put information into\nthe alternate data stream and\n\n296\n00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.410\nhide it from people, right?\n\n297\n00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:13.960\nIf I go into File Explorer for\nexample, and I go into My Documents,\n\n298\n00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.720\nI'll see a text file here,\nit says AD is demoed at txtf.\n\n299\n00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.970\nI double click on it.\n\n300\n00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.310\nIt opens up just fine.\n\n301\n00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.270\nThere's a little bit of text in there.\n\n302\n00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.997\nI can close it and\nthere's nothing else in here right?\n\n303\n00:17:23.997 --> 00:17:26.410\nI don't see anything else.\n\n304\n00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.220\nBut, if I go back over\nto my command prompt and\n\n305\n00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.460\ndo a dir/r I'm gonna see\nsomething interesting.\n\n306\n00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.775\nThere is actually a second item\nin there called secret.txt,\n\n307\n00:17:37.775 --> 00:17:41.548\nbut it's ADS_demo.txt,\nthe original file we just clicked on.\n\n308\n00:17:41.548 --> 00:17:45.470\n:secret.text all right?\n\n309\n00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:51.105\nHm, that's interesting,\nlet's do this, let's do Notepad,\n\n310\n00:17:51.105 --> 00:17:55.225\nADSdemo.text:secret.text, and\nSee what happens.\n\n311\n00:17:56.415 --> 00:17:59.105\nAnd a whole nother file opens up.\n\n312\n00:17:59.105 --> 00:18:01.955\nAnd it looks like somebody's\nbeen storing passwords.\n\n313\n00:18:01.955 --> 00:18:05.295\nAnd of course, I just made this up,\nbut people will do things like this.\n\n314\n00:18:05.295 --> 00:18:08.105\nThey will put information they don't\nthink anybody's gonna find it.\n\n315\n00:18:08.105 --> 00:18:10.395\nThey'll hide stuff in that\nalternate data screen.\n\n316\n00:18:10.395 --> 00:18:13.835\nWell, you can put applications in there,\nthis is where the bad guys will\n\n317\n00:18:13.835 --> 00:18:18.870\nput executables, like their tools that\nthey want to use, they want to hide.\n\n318\n00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.710\nBecause what's interesting about the\nalternate data stream is you dump data in\n\n319\n00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.650\nthere, it does not change the file\nsize listed by Windows for\n\n320\n00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.590\nthe original file and you don't see\nit through normal Windows tools.\n\n321\n00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:30.890\nIt is completely hidden.\n\n322\n00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.190\n&gt;&gt; Insidious even.\n\n323\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.440\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's very crazy.\n\n324\n00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.760\nSo, just a good one to know, DIR.\n\n325\n00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.370\nWe used to have to get other\ntools to find these but nor\n\n326\n00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:44.810\nDAR slash R will allow us to examine the\nalternate data streams for those files.\n\n327\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:48.140\n&gt;&gt; So Mike if I was actually performing\nsome sort of forensic analysis\n\n328\n00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.040\non this directory structure\nobviously I'm not going to know.\n\n329\n00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.380\nThe size is no different.\n\n330\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.680\nIf I'm comparing and contrasting I see\nno difference in the size of the data\n\n331\n00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.930\nam I creating a script,\nis there tools that would allow me,\n\n332\n00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.990\nam I able to do that more automatedly,\nif that's a word.\n\n333\n00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can definitely write\na script because anything we can put in\n\n334\n00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.870\na batch file,\n\n335\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.310\nany command I can launch from the command\nline I can just dump it into a batch file.\n\n336\n00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.070\nAnd I could have it do a dir-r,\n\n337\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:17.510\nI could even do a little recursiveness\nif I wanted to go through this folder,\n\n338\n00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.610\nall its sub folders and things like that\ncuz really it's the only way to do it,\n\n339\n00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.650\nis to look at every single file and\nsee if there's anything hidden.\n\n340\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.739\n&gt;&gt; I mean you could go\nthrough it manually.\n\n341\n00:19:25.739 --> 00:19:27.224\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you really hated yourself.\n\n342\n00:19:27.224 --> 00:19:30.324\n&gt;&gt; Exactly if you had nothing to do for\nthe next five years.\n\n343\n00:19:30.324 --> 00:19:33.108\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Masochist.\n\n344\n00:19:33.108 --> 00:19:35.720\n&gt;&gt; All right so that's a look at dir.\n\n345\n00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.910\nAnother one we could look\nat is process explorer.\n\n346\n00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.380\nThis is a way to get information\n\n347\n00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.260\nabout processes that\nare going on in your system.\n\n348\n00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.720\nThis is a trial version\nthat I've downloaded.\n\n349\n00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.210\nWe'll just open up,\nI'm going to open up Wordpad.exe.\n\n350\n00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.660\nAnd it tells me it's a trial,\nI'm going to continue on with my trial.\n\n351\n00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.650\nAnd I can get information again\nabout the application and,\n\n352\n00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:03.050\nreally where this is useful, is when I\nhave software that I've purchased, or\n\n353\n00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.940\nthat I have acquired, but\nI don't have access to the source code.\n\n354\n00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.810\nSo I don't know what's\ngoing on inside there.\n\n355\n00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:09.920\nAnd maybe I don't trust it,\n\n356\n00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.010\nmaybe I think there's something\nfunny going on in this application.\n\n357\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.290\nEvery time I fire up this application\nthere's a lot of network activity going\n\n358\n00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.330\non, and this is supposed to\nbe an image viewer, right.\n\n359\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.820\nAns why is this network activity going on?\n\n360\n00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.160\nSo you can use a tool like\nthis to get in and examine and\n\n361\n00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.330\ntry to see what's going\non in that application.\n\n362\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:35.140\nYou can go to this resource view here and\nI can see what's inside this file.\n\n363\n00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.410\nWhat's a good thing to look at?\n\n364\n00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.870\nI was trying to think if there's\nanything exciting in here for WordPad.\n\n365\n00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:44.470\nIt shows you some of the images\nthat are located in there.\n\n366\n00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.060\nThat's not all that exciting.\n\n367\n00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.420\nBut I can get good version information,\nand let me zoom in, I know that's small,\n\n368\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.340\nall right?\n\n369\n00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:57.190\nVersion information, file product info,\nlanguage codes, who created it.\n\n370\n00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.830\nAnd this might be information that\nI can't get any other way, right?\n\n371\n00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.780\nAll I see in windows is the name of\nthe file dot EXE, I right-click on it,\n\n372\n00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.060\nI see some properties.\n\n373\n00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.520\nThis will let me dive into it and\nstart breaking it apart, and\n\n374\n00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.280\nlooking at the actual application so.\n\n375\n00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.360\nAnd there's several others,\nProcess Explorer or\n\n376\n00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.480\nPE Explorer is just one of\nthose type of tools all right.\n\n377\n00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.050\nOther things we should look at on a\nWindows system gonna be disk utilization.\n\n378\n00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:27.310\nYeah we need to see if somebody's\nhiding files on my disk.\n\n379\n00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.410\nI've had this happen several times where\npeople come to you and they're like,\n\n380\n00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.930\nthis is a relatively new machine,\nI'm outta disk space but when I look in\n\n381\n00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:38.220\nFile Explorer, I have no files other than\nWindows and a few things and my documents.\n\n382\n00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.480\nWhere is all my disk space going?\n\n383\n00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.290\nIt very could be that you\nare warez server of some kind and\n\n384\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:49.050\npeople are using your system to\ndistribute illegal copies of movies or\n\n385\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:54.440\nyou're just a staging point as they\nexfiltrate data out of your organization.\n\n386\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.580\nSo being able to look at\nwhat's going on there.\n\n387\n00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.570\nOne till I have played around\nwith is this space sniffer.\n\n388\n00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.870\nI'll take a look at my c drive.\n\n389\n00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.150\nIt takes it a minute, so\nI don't know if I'll let it finish,\n\n390\n00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:09.250\nI'm gonna close the log cuz I didn't\nrun it with administrative access, so\n\n391\n00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.420\nit's gonna have a couple issues\ngetting into certain locations.\n\n392\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.370\nBut you can see it slowly populating here.\n\n393\n00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.590\n&gt;&gt; It's really freaking me out.\n\n394\n00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda fun to watch, isn't it?\n\n395\n00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.520\n[LAUGH] And what it's doing is,\nit's exploring the disc and\n\n396\n00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.000\nit's gonna show me every little thing.\n\n397\n00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.030\nAnd you can get in here and dig around.\n\n398\n00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.230\nLet me just Zoom in so you can see,\nit's gonna freeze it for a second.\n\n399\n00:22:30.018 --> 00:22:34.460\nSystem 32, 2.9 gigabytes and\nI zoom back out.\n\n400\n00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.420\nWe'll take a look like\nhere's Windows Powershell.\n\n401\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.420\nLike click on it and\nget a little more information.\n\n402\n00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.139\nIf I double click on it,\nit will zoom in to it, I can see.\n\n403\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.210\nWhat it's taking up,\nwhy is it taking up that space.\n\n404\n00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.390\nAnd again, this test is not\nabout using any of these tools.\n\n405\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.360\nWe just need to know they're available,\nand\n\n406\n00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.000\nwhat kind of information\nwe can get using those.\n\n407\n00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.880\nSo if you need to know what's going on on\nyour disk space, there's a little bit of\n\n408\n00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.020\na difference between what you're\nshowing in Windows Explorer, and\n\n409\n00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.100\nthe fact that your drive is full and\nit won't let you store any more data,\n\n410\n00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.920\nthis is the kind of tool\nthat you would use.\n\n411\n00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.770\nSpace Sniffer, another one is WinderStat,\nkinda the same thing.\n\n412\n00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.334\nThis one's a little more graphical.\n\n413\n00:23:22.754 --> 00:23:23.380\nAnd it has,\n\n414\n00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:27.470\nwe won't say those are, cuz there could\nbe a copyright infringement there.\n\n415\n00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.510\n&gt;&gt; It's the southern version, Winderstat.\n\n416\n00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:30.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n417\n00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:33.680\n[LAUGH] But it allows me to, again,\n\n418\n00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.130\nexplore and\nsee what's going on on this hard drive.\n\n419\n00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.180\nAnd I can see what's\ntaking up all that space.\n\n420\n00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.870\nGreat reporting capabilities in here.\n\n421\n00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.995\nWhat else?\n\n422\n00:23:46.995 --> 00:23:49.192\nI wanna show you about that,\nthat's probably good for\n\n423\n00:23:49.192 --> 00:23:51.788\nthat again just another one of\nthose programs that'll really.\n\n424\n00:23:51.788 --> 00:23:55.913\nIgnore what windows telling you there and\nlet meg o look at the hard drive and\n\n425\n00:23:55.913 --> 00:23:59.515\nsee whats there because a lot of\nthis malware can try to hide itself\n\n426\n00:23:59.515 --> 00:24:01.964\nfrom some of our normal Windows processes.\n\n427\n00:24:01.964 --> 00:24:04.038\nSo we need things that\nwill go around that and\n\n428\n00:24:04.038 --> 00:24:06.080\nlook at it from a different prospective.\n\n429\n00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.820\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I would have killed for\nthis years ago.\n\n430\n00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.390\nI wish I would have known cuz I have\nmanually have gone through the entire\n\n431\n00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.550\nWindows File Directory Structure looking\nfor something that was filling up.\n\n432\n00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.270\nI thought maybe this was Malware.\n\n433\n00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.825\nRan malware detection, nothing found.\n\n434\n00:24:18.825 --> 00:24:21.410\nAnd it was a stinking update,\n\n435\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.980\nthat caught in some weird loop because\nit wasn't quite downloading correctly.\n\n436\n00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.150\nIt just kept filling\nthe Windows update folder up.\n\n437\n00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:27.820\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n438\n00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.440\nI had to go through each one of those.\n\n439\n00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.150\nHad I known on this kind of tools around.\n\n440\n00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:32.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; At that point in time,\n\n441\n00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.060\nI save myself a lot of time.\n\n442\n00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.492\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a private, a pop top,\na big glaring boxes.\n\n443\n00:24:35.492 --> 00:24:37.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why is Windows update bigger than\n\n444\n00:24:37.215 --> 00:24:37.820\nSikuli Windows?\n\n445\n00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.340\n&gt;&gt; See, that does make sense so.\n\n447\n00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.030\nYeah, great little tools we can use there.\n\n448\n00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.770\nProcesses, another thing, right?\n\n449\n00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.610\nI need to see what processes\nare going on on the system\n\n450\n00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:51.160\ncuz if there's malware running,\nif it's running some kind of back door.\n\n451\n00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.230\nHow do we find that out?\n\n452\n00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.380\nWell, we've got tools like\nProcess Monitor, Process Explorer.\n\n453\n00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.670\nYou guys I'm sure have played\naround with Task Manager.\n\n454\n00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.500\nBuilt into Windows,\nright-click on your Task Bar, and\n\n455\n00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.540\nthat gives you some\nbasic information there.\n\n456\n00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.140\nAnother good one that you can use, and\nwe can take a look at my screen here,\n\n457\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.210\nis something called Task List.\n\n458\n00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.780\nAll right,\njust type in Task list from my prompt.\n\n459\n00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.380\nAnd here I can see the different\ntasks that are running,\n\n460\n00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:23.900\nwhat their process IDs are, what\nthe session name is that's running them,\n\n461\n00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.910\nhow much memory they're using, all right.\n\n462\n00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.130\nThere used to be something called t list,\n\n463\n00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:32.820\nthe task list is the new\nversion of t list.\n\n464\n00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.150\nWe can also do things\nlike process monitor.\n\n465\n00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.810\nThis is a sys terminal tool.\n\n466\n00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.780\nLet me fire up File Explorer.\n\n467\n00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.520\nI think I put that in downloads.\n\n468\n00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.950\nYeah, Process Explorer.\n\n469\n00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.280\n&gt;&gt; Love those Systernal tools.\n\n470\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.550\n&gt;&gt; Systernals, Mark Russinovich\nmakes some great, great products.\n\n471\n00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.480\n&gt;&gt; They ought to make like\na national holiday in his name.\n\n472\n00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.050\n&gt;&gt; I'm telling you.\n\n473\n00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:52.890\n&gt;&gt; These things are amazing.\n\n474\n00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:53.460\n&gt;&gt; I'm telling you.\n\n475\n00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.840\nI feel like such a fanboy.\n\n476\n00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.390\nI was at an RSA and\nI was trying to get his autograph.\n\n477\n00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.316\nI went and bought his book.\n\n478\n00:25:58.316 --> 00:26:01.250\nOne of his was trying\nto get his autograph.\n\n479\n00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.690\nAnd I used to make fun of people for like,\n\n480\n00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.173\nwhy do you care about these\nmovie actors and stuff?\n\n481\n00:26:05.173 --> 00:26:06.063\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're just people.\n\n482\n00:26:06.063 --> 00:26:09.316\n&gt;&gt; There's Mike.\n[CROSSTALK] Will you sign my book.\n\n483\n00:26:09.316 --> 00:26:13.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nI guess we all got our heroes, right?\n\n484\n00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.880\n[LAUGH] But you can see, this is\na pretty cool view of what's going.\n\n485\n00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.770\nMy system, let me zoom in here.\n\n486\n00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:20.380\nTake a look.\n\n487\n00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.540\nProcess Explorer.\n\n488\n00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:23.940\nWhich one did I fire up first?\n\n489\n00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.550\nI forgot.\nYeah, Process Explorer\n\n490\n00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.390\nreally good at examining\nresource utilization.\n\n491\n00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.190\nWhat is it that's using up all my memory?\n\n492\n00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:33.010\nWhat is it that's using\nup all my processor?\n\n493\n00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:36.660\nI can see that information here and\nnotice it's dynamic.\n\n494\n00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.160\nIt's changing as we go.\n\n495\n00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.150\nI can take a look at these\nindividual Items that can kill them,\n\n496\n00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:47.220\nit can suspend them, it could even\nsend these out to virus total.\n\n497\n00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:53.140\nThe other one is going to\nbe processed monitor and\n\n498\n00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:57.010\nwhere as process explorer's more about\nexamining the resource utilization.\n\n499\n00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.630\nProcess monitor is really\nlooking at process interaction.\n\n500\n00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.700\nWhat is interacting with what.\n\n501\n00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.950\nWhat calls are, well that's different.\n\n502\n00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.760\nThere we go.\n\n503\n00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.430\n&gt;&gt; Work with us computer [LAUGH].\n\n504\n00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.626\n&gt;&gt; Just like a typical user I didn't\neven read the error I just closed it.\n\n505\n00:27:13.626 --> 00:27:14.253\n[LAUGH].\n\n506\n00:27:14.253 --> 00:27:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Just closed it.\n\n507\n00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.190\n&gt;&gt; I'll regret that later off screen.\n\n508\n00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:21.950\nBut here I can see, what processors\nare reaching out and touching and\n\n509\n00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:22.740\nwhat are they touching?\n\n510\n00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.200\nIt's reaching out and\ntouching this DLL, right.\n\n511\n00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.980\nBoy, that is even small for me to see.\n\n512\n00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:34.610\nWmiprvse is reaching out and\ntalking to Fastprox.dll.\n\n513\n00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.520\nIs that something that\nshould be happening?\n\n514\n00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.670\nMaybe I need to do some investigation,\nright?\n\n515\n00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.010\nSo, you can see a lot of\ngood information here.\n\n516\n00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.650\nWhat else?\n\n517\n00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.100\nYou can narrow this down, like you\ncan show it just network activity.\n\n518\n00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.910\nLet me turn all these off here.\n\n519\n00:27:52.163 --> 00:27:56.720\nGet rid of everything so\nI can look at process and thread activity.\n\n520\n00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.670\nI can look at network activity.\n\n521\n00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.050\nWhat's reaching out and\ntalking to my network.\n\n522\n00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.930\nI've got file system activity.\n\n523\n00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.490\nAnd I've got registry activity.\n\n524\n00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.350\nOr you can turn them all on.\n\n525\n00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.390\nAnd there's even a little\nprofiling events but\n\n526\n00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.960\nthat's this thing going out and\nlooking at my system.\n\n527\n00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.150\nSo, another good tool for\n\n528\n00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:20.150\nanalyzing processes running on\na Windows based system, right?\n\n529\n00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:23.370\nServices, we need to know what\nservices are running on this system.\n\n530\n00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.380\nAgain, I might have malware\nrunning in the background.\n\n531\n00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.760\nWe've got our standard tools\nthat we can use in Windows.\n\n532\n00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:36.100\nIf I type in services.msc I can\nlaunch up my services console.\n\n533\n00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:40.730\nAnd here I can see what services I have\nwhich ones are running and I can sort this\n\n534\n00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:46.610\nby status, I can take a look at\nthe startup type for these services.\n\n535\n00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:50.890\nWhich ones are set automatic or\nmanual, or delayed start.\n\n536\n00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.310\nBut it's always good to have\nmore than one tool, cuz said,\n\n537\n00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.520\nmalware likes to hide from\nsome of known Windows tools.\n\n538\n00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.340\nServices Console definitely\none we can look at.\n\n539\n00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.960\nYou can also look at msconfig,\nthat's an oldie but\n\n540\n00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.720\na goodie, been around for a while.\n\n541\n00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.160\nAnd this will show you services as well.\n\n542\n00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.770\nOne of the nice things about\nmsconfig other than the fact that\n\n543\n00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.140\nyou can't resize the window\nwhich drives me crazy.\n\n544\n00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.560\nIs that I have a check mark\nhide all Microsoft services and\n\n545\n00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.880\nit makes it a little bit easier\nto at least get to third party.\n\n546\n00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.940\nNot saying that everything\nfrom Microsoft is trustworthy.\n\n547\n00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.330\nIf I'm gonna make something and\n\n548\n00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.240\ndisguise it, I'll try to make it\nlook like a Microsoft file, maybe.\n\n549\n00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.510\nBut Startup is no longer in system config.\n\n550\n00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.420\nThat's done through Task Manager, but\n\n551\n00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.070\nthey do give you a link to\njump over to Task Manager.\n\n552\n00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.950\nHere I can see things are set\nto start automatically.\n\n553\n00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.500\nAnother good place to go.\n\n554\n00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.010\nIf we go back to the registry\nunder current control set,\n\n555\n00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:51.780\none I didn't show you h key\nlocal machine software Microsoft\n\n556\n00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:56.960\nwindows current control set, there's going\nto be a key called run once and run.\n\n557\n00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.190\nAnd these are things that are set to run\nautomatically when the system boots up.\n\n558\n00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:02.350\nAnother great place they\nlike to stash malware.\n\n559\n00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.940\nYou get rid of it,\nyou reboot the system and it's back.\n\n560\n00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.610\nHow did it get back?\n\n561\n00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.970\nCuz they hid it in those\nrun keys in your registry.\n\n562\n00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.040\nOr you might come in here and\n\n563\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.500\nsee that it's configured to start up\nautomatically when you start that system.\n\n564\n00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:20.770\nAll right, another thing we want to\ntalk about is volatile memory analysis.\n\n565\n00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.235\nGreat place to look for evidence.\n\n566\n00:30:22.235 --> 00:30:24.815\nRemember, when we're looking at evidence.\n\n567\n00:30:24.815 --> 00:30:27.195\nWe have to think about\nthe order of volatility.\n\n568\n00:30:27.195 --> 00:30:30.645\nWe wanna grab things\nthat are gonna go away.\n\n569\n00:30:30.645 --> 00:30:35.515\nRAM being one of those that we wanna try\nto capture early on, cuz of power failure\n\n570\n00:30:35.515 --> 00:30:40.095\nor if machine get shutdown we get\nready to take it back to lab, right?\n\n571\n00:30:40.095 --> 00:30:44.480\nWe lose anything that's in RAM, so\nwe wanna try to get that information out.\n\n572\n00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.080\nWe're not going to actually\ndo a RAM scrape here, but\n\n573\n00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.570\nI do want to show you a tool that can\nbe used to analyze that after the fact.\n\n574\n00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:53.870\nAnd that's called Volatility.\n\n575\n00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.700\nThere are, again,\nseveral that you can use.\n\n576\n00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:01.467\nOne of the cool things I found with,\nwhere did I put that guy?\n\n577\n00:31:01.467 --> 00:31:04.730\nThere we are.\n\n578\n00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:15.110\nI thought I moved this guy somewhere a\nlittle more friendly, but maybe I did not.\n\n579\n00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:22.370\nSo Volatility, and why this command prompt\nhas a very small size, let's do that.\n\n580\n00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:27.610\nAnd- That might be a little too big,\nbut we'll make it work, right?\n\n581\n00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.030\nWith Volatility we're\ngonna launch the tool.\n\n582\n00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:35.680\nAnd then, what you do is you tell it\nwhat filename you want to analyze,\n\n583\n00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.540\nthis would be your memory dump.\n\n584\n00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:41.490\nNow I've gone out and found there's some\nreally cool sites out there that have\n\n585\n00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:47.170\nsample memory dumps of infected machines,\nthat you can use to practice your skills.\n\n586\n00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:51.769\nI've got one of those here and you tell\nit what, where the memory dump is and\n\n587\n00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:54.695\nyou have to tell it what\nprofile your gonna use.\n\n588\n00:31:54.695 --> 00:31:57.669\nAnd the one I'm gonna use this\nis from an Windows XP machine.\n\n589\n00:31:57.669 --> 00:32:02.170\nSo, I'm gonna do profile equals win\n\n590\n00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:08.688\n&gt;&gt; XPSP2X86,\n\n591\n00:32:08.688 --> 00:32:12.010\ncuz it has to know what\noperating system dumped this.\n\n592\n00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.628\nWhat is this from?\n\n593\n00:32:14.628 --> 00:32:19.430\nSo it knows the way things are organized\nand how to display it for us,\n\n594\n00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:24.249\nand then I can do different switches\nwith it like let's do sockets.\n\n595\n00:32:26.846 --> 00:32:30.685\nAnd what this is gonna do is, it's looking\nat this memory dump and you've gotta\n\n596\n00:32:30.685 --> 00:32:34.318\nthink that the memory dump is like\na snapshot of RAM from a running machine.\n\n597\n00:32:34.318 --> 00:32:38.600\nSo at the time this snapshot was taken,\nwhat sockets were open?\n\n598\n00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.560\nAnd I can see the different sockets here.\n\n599\n00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.132\nVery cool.\nNow, let's do a question mark with this\n\n600\n00:32:44.132 --> 00:32:47.040\nguy, so I can show you some\nof the options with that.\n\n601\n00:32:51.294 --> 00:32:53.665\nMaybe, just thinking about it.\n\n602\n00:32:53.665 --> 00:32:54.407\nThat's right.\n\n603\n00:32:54.407 --> 00:32:55.540\nThat's a dash h for these guys.\n\n604\n00:33:00.978 --> 00:33:01.651\nSo, let's let it load up.\n\n605\n00:33:01.651 --> 00:33:03.350\n&gt;&gt; Wow, what options.\n\n606\n00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.623\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of switches\nthat you can use with it.\n\n607\n00:33:06.623 --> 00:33:10.284\nThe ones I was using there,\nyou got to point it to your file name and\n\n608\n00:33:10.284 --> 00:33:14.081\nyour profile and you can do --info\nto get all the other profiles and\n\n609\n00:33:14.081 --> 00:33:16.830\nthen these are the plugins\nthat you're firing.\n\n610\n00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:22.038\nSo maybe I wanna look at API hooks or\nI wanna look at dll list.\n\n611\n00:33:22.038 --> 00:33:26.430\nWhat dlls were loaded up\nwhen this dump was taken?\n\n612\n00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:30.490\nSo I can do that same command again and\njust sent that to,\n\n613\n00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.360\nwhat was that, dll dump?\n\n614\n00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.602\nIf I remember, dlllist.\n\n615\n00:33:35.602 --> 00:33:40.923\nSo, dlllist and\nit's gonna show me again what dlls were\n\n616\n00:33:40.923 --> 00:33:46.470\nloaded up in memory at the time\nthat this dump was taken.\n\n617\n00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.492\nSo this is how I can go back and\nstart looking and seeing again,\n\n618\n00:33:49.492 --> 00:33:51.656\nwhat was going on that\nmachine at that time.\n\n619\n00:33:51.656 --> 00:33:54.360\nThey also mention in this objective\nsome Active Directory tools.\n\n620\n00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.363\nThey didn't load any of those up.\n\n621\n00:33:55.363 --> 00:33:59.715\nWe've got our standard\nActive Directory consoles that we\n\n622\n00:33:59.715 --> 00:34:04.510\nget in our domain controllers or\nin our management utilities for\n\n623\n00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:09.304\nWindows domains, but\nthere's also other tools you can get like\n\n624\n00:34:09.304 --> 00:34:14.900\nAD Explorer which lets you go in and\npull back information on objects.\n\n625\n00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.313\nWhat do we wanna look for\nin Active Directory?\n\n626\n00:34:17.313 --> 00:34:20.422\nWell, really we wanna monitor,\none of the big things you monitor for\n\n627\n00:34:20.422 --> 00:34:23.860\nin Active Directory are new accounts and\ngroup membership changes.\n\n628\n00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.608\nThose are the kind of\nthings I wanna look for,\n\n629\n00:34:25.608 --> 00:34:28.704\ncuz the bad guys are gonna be making new\naccounts that they can use as a back door.\n\n630\n00:34:28.704 --> 00:34:32.660\nSo monitoring those,\nusing tools like AD Explorer.\n\n631\n00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.418\nSo, lot of different tools we have at our\ndisposal when we are examining a Windows\n\n632\n00:34:36.418 --> 00:34:37.647\nbased operating system.\n\n633\n00:34:37.647 --> 00:34:38.647\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n634\n00:34:38.647 --> 00:34:43.850\nWindows has no lack of available options,\neither built-in or third party provided.\n\n635\n00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:46.886\nSo if you need to to do some\nanalysis on a Windows machine,\n\n636\n00:34:46.886 --> 00:34:49.179\nthere's plenty of options there for you.\n\n637\n00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.465\nThat being said, Mike,\nI'm looking at the time.\n\n638\n00:34:51.465 --> 00:34:52.663\nWe've run well out of it.\n\n639\n00:34:52.663 --> 00:34:55.315\nFor this episode,\nwe do thank you for joining us and\n\n640\n00:34:55.315 --> 00:34:58.770\nwalking us through some of the options\nthat we do have available for\n\n641\n00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.510\nus doing analysis inside\nof a Windows machine.\n\n642\n00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.283\nThat being said, we do thank you guys for\n\n643\n00:35:03.283 --> 00:35:05.800\njoining us as well, but\nit is that time for us to sign off.\n\n644\n00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.260\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n645\n00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.094\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n646\n00:35:09.094 --> 00:35:10.542\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

greetings, everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:16.107\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:19.211\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n9\n00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:22.460\nwe are back with more of our\nCyberSec First Responder series.\n\n10\n00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.768\nAnd joining us in the studio, you probably\nguessed it by now, it's Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:26.807\nNo [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:27.997\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You look a little more\n\n13\n00:00:27.997 --> 00:00:28.644\nlike Mike Rodrick.\n\n14\n00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:30.114\nThat's who it is Mick Rodrick is\n\n15\n00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:30.716\njoining us-\n\n16\n00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:31.989\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mike welcome.\n\n17\n00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:32.895\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe won't be drawing any views today.\n\n18\n00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:34.783\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thanks for having me,\n\n19\n00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:36.041\nexcited to be here as always.\n\n20\n00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:36.668\nAnd yeah,\n\n21\n00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:41.940\ncontinuing on with our good old CyberSec\nFirst Responder from Logical Operations.\n\n22\n00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.520\nAll right, in this one, we're just gonna\nkinda continue our thought process.\n\n23\n00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.036\nIn the previous episode, we were looking\nat different tools we could use to analyze\n\n24\n00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:49.454\nincidents on a Windows machine.\n\n25\n00:00:49.454 --> 00:00:52.251\nNow we wanna take a look\nat a Linux machine,\n\n26\n00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:55.768\nand you'll see there's\na lot of similarities here.\n\n27\n00:00:55.768 --> 00:01:00.607\nThe first thing we're going to talk about\nis tools that we have to use to look at\n\n28\n00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:05.089\nthe network, and surprise,\nsurprise they're the same tools right?\n\n29\n00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.894\nNmap, we know Nmap as a port scanner,\n\n30\n00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:12.640\ndoes a little more than that but\nis hard it's a port scanner.\n\n31\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.200\nAnd so we can use Nmap in Linux, just like\nwe can in Windows, to scan our machine,\n\n32\n00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.020\nsee what ports are open.\n\n33\n00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.170\nWhy is that important?\n\n34\n00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.825\nBecause we need to know what\nour machines are listening on.\n\n35\n00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:25.694\nWe need to look for signs of\nmalware that has a listener going.\n\n36\n00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:29.712\nSome kind of back door that\nmaybe somebody has installed or\n\n37\n00:01:29.712 --> 00:01:34.800\nthey're transferring files out of\nsome port that's not normally open.\n\n38\n00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.780\nAnd we can find that\nusing a tool like Nmap.\n\n39\n00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.905\nNetstat, we saw that in Windows,\n\n40\n00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:43.733\nI don't need to fire that up\nagainst same information there.\n\n41\n00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:46.220\nWireshark, another one, right?\n\n42\n00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.054\nPacket capture utility that we can use to\ncapture the traffic that's going across on\n\n43\n00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:51.739\nthe network, see what's going on.\n\n44\n00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:55.860\nSee what protocols are being used,\nto look inside the packet,\n\n45\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.771\nsee what data's moving around,\nif they are in plain text.\n\n46\n00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:03.327\nThere is one though that I'll show you\nhere that we didn't look in Windows.\n\n47\n00:02:03.327 --> 00:02:07.144\nIt's another packet capture utility,\nand it's called Tcpdump.\n\n48\n00:02:07.144 --> 00:02:12.991\nAnd it's basically a text version, it's\nvery similar in functionality I guess,\n\n49\n00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:15.672\nit's the same as Wireshark, right?\n\n50\n00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:18.800\nIt's designed to grab network traffic.\n\n51\n00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.950\nIt's a packet capture utility, so\nyou can see as soon as I type Tcpdump and\n\n52\n00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.020\nhit Enter.\n\n53\n00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.730\nI can see all the traffic that's going\non between this machine and the network.\n\n54\n00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.620\nSo I'll close that, so that was Tcpdump.\n\n55\n00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.320\nA traceroute is the same thing as has\ntracert in our Windows environment.\n\n56\n00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.681\nIt's gonna give me\ninformation about the path,\n\n57\n00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:42.858\nthat my pockets are taking on\nthe way to their final destination.\n\n58\n00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:45.043\nArp which we didn't look at in Windows,\nbut\n\n59\n00:02:45.043 --> 00:02:47.475\nthey do call out here on\nthe Linux side of things.\n\n60\n00:02:47.475 --> 00:02:52.300\nBut could be used in Windows just\nas easy and for the same purpose.\n\n61\n00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.120\nArp is may address resolution protocol.\n\n62\n00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.409\nThis will be used to translate, or\nit's what the TPC IP stack uses\n\n63\n00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:06.387\nto resolve IP addresses in Mac addresses\nfor that last leg of its journey.\n\n64\n00:03:06.387 --> 00:03:11.121\nWe can do like an arp,\nI don't really see a lot in here, but\n\n65\n00:03:11.121 --> 00:03:15.579\nit's going to show me as I'm\nlooking at the arp cache.\n\n66\n00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.930\nI can see,\nwhat's recently been resolved, right?\n\n67\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.100\nWhat is my machine?\n\n68\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.372\nHow to take the IP address forward and\nturn it into a MAC address.\n\n69\n00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:27.817\nI would see those there, and we would\nbe looking for unusual activity or\n\n70\n00:03:27.817 --> 00:03:29.091\nunusual entries in here.\n\n71\n00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:33.159\nEspecially like duplications where I see\ntwo different IP addresses pointing to\n\n72\n00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.840\nthe same MAC address.\n\n73\n00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.423\nGood idea, something is going wrong there,\nsomething is going on.\n\n74\n00:03:37.423 --> 00:03:41.390\nVery well could be the beginnings\nof a man in the middle of attack or\n\n75\n00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.520\nsomebody slipping in between two\nnodes in a conversation, right?\n\n76\n00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.324\nIfconfig is a tool,\nI'll go ahead and run it here.\n\n77\n00:03:49.324 --> 00:03:50.520\nI'm sure we've seen it before.\n\n78\n00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.530\nIt's like ipconfig in windows.\n\n79\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.650\nThis is how I can look at\nmy TCP IP configuration for\n\n80\n00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.000\nmy different network adapters, right?\n\n81\n00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.980\nWhen it comes to the file system in Linux,\na few different tools we can use.\n\n82\n00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.460\nLsof shows me a list of the files\nthat have been accessed, and\n\n83\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.680\nmore than that processes that\nare accessing resources.\n\n84\n00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.989\nAs you can see, it's a long list here.\n\n85\n00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.695\nBut lsof allows me to list\nthat information out, so\n\n86\n00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:27.238\nit's kind of like a processor\nexplorer might be in Windows.\n\n87\n00:04:27.238 --> 00:04:28.020\nWhat else?\n\n88\n00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.590\nIperf is one.\n\n89\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.390\nI don't have that one set up.\n\n90\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.758\nWith iperf,\nyou take two different machines and\n\n91\n00:04:33.758 --> 00:04:35.731\nyou run basically a client and a server.\n\n92\n00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:40.402\nYou can transmit data back and forth and\nyou can look at the bandwidth utilization.\n\n93\n00:04:40.402 --> 00:04:44.380\nDD, we've made fun of-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n94\n00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.117\n&gt;&gt; Have made fun of,\n\n95\n00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:48.472\nbut we've teased about this one before,\nabout what DD stands for right Daniel?\n\n96\n00:04:48.472 --> 00:04:50.280\n&gt;&gt; Disk data destroyer and disk destroyer.\n\n97\n00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.756\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, data destroyer,\ndisk destroyer exactly.\n\n98\n00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:59.482\nBut it's what we would use to\ncreate a copy of really anythiny.\n\n99\n00:04:59.482 --> 00:05:00.821\nBut typically of a hard drive, right?\n\n100\n00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:05.458\nIf we wanna make that copy that\nwe're gonna use to do analyze,\n\n101\n00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:07.780\nwe can use DD to do that.\n\n102\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.900\nThere are other newer versions of DD that\nwe can use as well that are maybe a little\n\n103\n00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.324\nmore forensically sound.\n\n104\n00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:16.860\nBut DD's built into most systems,\nI could do a man dd.\n\n105\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.588\nAnd you can see there's quite a few\nswitches that I can use with it.\n\n106\n00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:26.800\nBut it'll make that bit by bit\ncopy that we're looking for.\n\n107\n00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.283\nCuz then we can run our\nhashing algorithms,\n\n108\n00:05:29.283 --> 00:05:31.577\nverify that they're exactly the same.\n\n109\n00:05:31.577 --> 00:05:33.630\nAnd then I can work with that copy and\n\n110\n00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.337\nnot mess with the original drive\nthat's under investigation.\n\n111\n00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:41.270\nAll right, so that would be dd.\n\n112\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.590\nWhen it comes to processes\nthat we're working with in\n\n113\n00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.858\nLinux top is the one that we all think of.\n\n114\n00:05:48.858 --> 00:05:53.670\nI run top and I can see some\ninformation about the system itself.\n\n115\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.042\nWhat my current CPU utilisation is,\nprocesses that are going on,\n\n116\n00:05:58.042 --> 00:05:59.612\nwhat the process ID is.\n\n117\n00:05:59.612 --> 00:06:01.775\nWho the ower of that processor is,\n\n118\n00:06:01.775 --> 00:06:05.290\nwhat resources it is consuming\nas far as CPU and memory.\n\n119\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.583\nAnd what command, and\n\n120\n00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:10.815\nhow long they've been running, and\nyou can see it's actually dynamic.\n\n121\n00:06:10.815 --> 00:06:16.255\nIt's not just a static representation,\nI mean it's changing as we speak.\n\n122\n00:06:16.255 --> 00:06:18.784\nSo it's kinda that live view,\n\n123\n00:06:18.784 --> 00:06:24.150\nmuch like we would see in\nTask Manager in our Windows system.\n\n124\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.502\nThere's also another one, you can go out\nand get called htop, which is little bit\n\n125\n00:06:28.502 --> 00:06:32.622\nmore information and it's also a little\nprettier it's kind of color coded.\n\n126\n00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:34.644\n&gt;&gt; We like the colors, right?\n\n127\n00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:35.852\nI haven't played with it.\n\n128\n00:06:35.852 --> 00:06:39.745\nTop is it works fine if you've\ncome from the days of your-\n\n129\n00:06:39.745 --> 00:06:40.344\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n130\n00:06:40.344 --> 00:06:44.679\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've been using Linux since like 2000.\n\n131\n00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:47.097\nNo, no, no, 1998 was the-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n132\n00:06:47.097 --> 00:06:49.695\n&gt;&gt; First time I installed, so\nI'm in before the millenium there.\n\n133\n00:06:49.695 --> 00:06:51.655\nBut you just kinda get\nused to these things, but\n\n134\n00:06:51.655 --> 00:06:53.230\nI do like things that are color coded.\n\n135\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.122\nSo I probably will eventually like, now\nthat I'm running Linux more as my daily\n\n136\n00:06:57.122 --> 00:06:59.752\ndriver that's something that\nI would do is use htop.\n\n137\n00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:02.766\nCuz having things like that can\nreally make this analysis process.\n\n138\n00:07:02.766 --> 00:07:06.404\nYou would think that's silly,\nit's just colors, it makes it easier.\n\n139\n00:07:06.404 --> 00:07:11.051\nIt makes you be able to more visually\nhave a better idea of what's\n\n140\n00:07:11.051 --> 00:07:12.955\ngoing on at a faster pace.\n\n141\n00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:16.558\nWhere before everything is just white text\nkinda jumbled together and you have to go,\n\n142\n00:07:16.558 --> 00:07:19.075\nokay, I gotta look in this area,\nI gotta look in that area.\n\n143\n00:07:19.075 --> 00:07:24.106\nHtop does a better job of steering\nyou toward areas that you might wanna\n\n144\n00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:29.236\nbe seeing, because of the colors and\nthings and the way they format it.\n\n145\n00:07:29.236 --> 00:07:32.198\nSo I would say use htop over top,\nbut no top.\n\n146\n00:07:32.198 --> 00:07:37.155\nBecause it's gonna be ubiquitous\nthroughout the systems where htop isn't.\n\n147\n00:07:37.155 --> 00:07:39.634\nI've got a Linux system in front\nof me right now, htop, nothing.\n\n148\n00:07:39.634 --> 00:07:40.948\nIt's not there, I'd have to install it.\n\n149\n00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:42.736\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Top worked fine, Mike.\n\n150\n00:07:42.736 --> 00:07:43.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n151\n00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.734\nIt's always going to be there.\n\n152\n00:07:44.734 --> 00:07:46.301\nIf you wanna take a look at my screen,\n\n153\n00:07:46.301 --> 00:07:48.534\nI went out to the gentleman's\nsite that wrote htop.\n\n154\n00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:51.729\nAnd you can see it's got\nsome screen shots here, and\n\n155\n00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:56.228\nas well it looks like somehow same\ninformation that we are getting from top\n\n156\n00:07:56.228 --> 00:07:59.860\na little prettier,\nlike you said color coded.\n\n157\n00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.817\nNice little graphs up here and\n\n158\n00:08:00.817 --> 00:08:02.968\nlittle additional information\nthat they're throwing up there.\n\n159\n00:08:02.968 --> 00:08:09.838\nI think we can see one and we had one\nthat was actually moving around there.\n\n160\n00:08:09.838 --> 00:08:13.710\nBut anyway,\nyou can see nice color coding to it.\n\n161\n00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.980\nAs Daniel said, sometimes that\nmakes the information stick out,\n\n162\n00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:21.410\nespecially abnormal information might pop\nout a little more with that color coding.\n\n163\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.140\nAll right, so\nwe'll get back over to my Linux machine.\n\n164\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.811\nI killed top,\nwe'll get rid of that one there.\n\n165\n00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:30.601\nPs is another one that we can use.\n\n166\n00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:33.979\nTake a look at the processes\nthat are running on my system.\n\n167\n00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:35.556\nYou can do a man, oops.\n\n168\n00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:36.275\n&gt;&gt; MSN.\n\n169\n00:08:36.275 --> 00:08:37.796\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; MSN, we could do that too.\n\n170\n00:08:37.796 --> 00:08:39.774\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go check a news outlet and\nsee how this thing works.\n\n171\n00:08:39.774 --> 00:08:41.104\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, gotta see what's going on.\n\n172\n00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:45.307\nWe'll see how the prosecution is going or\nthe indictments are going against\n\n173\n00:08:45.307 --> 00:08:48.206\nthe people that did the Yahoo\nbreach a few years ago.\n\n174\n00:08:48.206 --> 00:08:53.347\nBut here, you can see the man page for\nit, it's rather lengthy.\n\n175\n00:08:53.347 --> 00:08:56.207\nA lot of different\nswitches that I can use,\n\n176\n00:08:56.207 --> 00:09:00.511\ndepending on how I want that\noutput to be formatted, all right?\n\n177\n00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:03.030\nSo get familiar with that and\nplay around with it.\n\n178\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.210\nCheck and\nsee what information I can get, but\n\n179\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.840\nagain it's showing me the process ID,\nwhat terminal is owning that.\n\n180\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.272\nHow long it's been running or when it\nwas running, what command was run there.\n\n181\n00:09:12.272 --> 00:09:16.393\n&gt;&gt; I typically find myself\nusing the PS/AX or AXU switch.\n\n182\n00:09:16.393 --> 00:09:17.249\n&gt;&gt; Let's try it.\n\n183\n00:09:17.249 --> 00:09:22.970\n&gt;&gt; Cuz sometimes PS, as you saw when Mike\nran it, didn't show you a whole lot.\n\n184\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.042\nBut I bet if you do ps -ax, yeah,\nget a little bit more there.\n\n185\n00:09:26.042 --> 00:09:27.236\n&gt;&gt; Get a little bit more information.\n\n186\n00:09:27.236 --> 00:09:30.450\n&gt;&gt; And then you can find process IDs,\nlike Mike was talking about.\n\n187\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.856\nTypically, I'll need to find a process ID\nto kill a process that's gone rogue, and\n\n188\n00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:37.724\nsometimes my browser locks up and\njust won't go away.\n\n189\n00:09:37.724 --> 00:09:41.888\nps -ax, sweet, there's the process ID,\nkill, sometimes kill -9,\n\n190\n00:09:41.888 --> 00:09:44.451\nwhich will Definitely murder that process.\n\n191\n00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:46.404\nPut two in the back of its head and\nbury it in a shallow grave.\n\n192\n00:09:46.404 --> 00:09:47.821\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n193\n00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:48.769\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As it does do.\n\n194\n00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:49.817\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n195\n00:09:49.817 --> 00:09:52.086\n&gt;&gt; And it's similar information what we're\n\n196\n00:09:52.086 --> 00:09:55.877\nseeing from top it's not a dynamic view,\nit is a static view, though.\n\n197\n00:09:55.877 --> 00:10:00.562\nAll right, other things we wanna look\nat in Linux, we wanna be able to take\n\n198\n00:10:00.562 --> 00:10:05.190\na look at, maybe we're noticing\na resource utilization abnormality.\n\n199\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.780\nWe've got no memory left on the system.\n\n200\n00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.520\nFree is a command that I can look at\nsee what kind of memory I have left.\n\n201\n00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.401\nHow much of it's free, how much of it,\n\n202\n00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:21.117\nif I can slow down a little bit,\nis available, how much is in use?\n\n203\n00:10:21.117 --> 00:10:22.536\n&gt;&gt; Throw a -h on there.\n\n204\n00:10:22.536 --> 00:10:25.169\nIt helps those numbers become\na little easier to look at.\n\n205\n00:10:25.169 --> 00:10:26.302\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; -h,\n\n206\n00:10:26.302 --> 00:10:30.601\nI don't know it's gonna change that,\nthta's a good little tip there.\n\n207\n00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:34.139\nAll right, what else do we wanna do?\n\n208\n00:10:34.139 --> 00:10:37.290\nSession management is another\nthing we wanna take a look at.\n\n209\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.140\nWhat sessions are going on?\n\n210\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.576\nWe can use the who command to see\nwho we are currently logged on as.\n\n211\n00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:44.567\nYou can see I am logged on as root.\n\n212\n00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:49.052\nWe've got the w command that gives you\na little more information about that\n\n213\n00:10:49.052 --> 00:10:51.070\ncurrently logged on user.\n\n214\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.067\nI can see what terminal they're in,\nwhen they logged in,\n\n215\n00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:57.361\nwhat they're currently using.\n\n216\n00:10:57.361 --> 00:11:00.604\nrwho, I love these names.\n\n217\n00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:03.327\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is one that if I had other Linux boxes\n\n218\n00:11:03.327 --> 00:11:06.847\non here it should show you on\nmy network if they reported in.\n\n219\n00:11:06.847 --> 00:11:10.194\nIt'll show you information about who's\nlogged on to the different systems\n\n220\n00:11:10.194 --> 00:11:10.934\non the network.\n\n221\n00:11:10.934 --> 00:11:13.706\nLastlog is a good one.\n\n222\n00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:15.471\nNow mines gonna look odd and\n\n223\n00:11:15.471 --> 00:11:20.360\nmost people that run this go how come\nit shows that I've never logged on?\n\n224\n00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.610\nI know I've logged on\nas root several times.\n\n225\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.276\nI'm logged on as root right now,\nand yet is says never logged on.\n\n226\n00:11:25.276 --> 00:11:29.665\nThe thing to understand about last log\nis it's not your log on sessions with\n\n227\n00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:31.696\nthe desktop interface like this.\n\n228\n00:11:31.696 --> 00:11:37.760\nIt's usually remote sessions or SSH\nsessions where you're logging into those.\n\n229\n00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.430\nThose would be captured here,\n\n230\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:44.920\nyou wanna see whose logging on locally to\nthis machine, that's when we use last.\n\n231\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.220\nAnd last will show you the people that\nhave logged on, when they logged on and\n\n232\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.590\nyou can see like I'm still logged on and\nstill running.\n\n233\n00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:57.425\nTells me in the past though,\nwhen I've logged on, when I've logged off.\n\n234\n00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:00.826\nAll right, so again,\na lot of similar tools.\n\n235\n00:12:00.826 --> 00:12:04.290\nI know we didn't really seem\nto spend as much time here.\n\n236\n00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.370\nBut we've seen these tools,\nany other lessons, right?\n\n237\n00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:08.690\nAnd we've seen them on Windows,\n\n238\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.096\nthey're no different on Linux at least the\nones that are common on Wireshark, Nmap.\n\n239\n00:12:12.096 --> 00:12:15.091\nThose are the same whichever\none you're running it on so.\n\n240\n00:12:15.091 --> 00:12:18.167\nSo the best thing to do again\nreally looking at these tools and\n\n241\n00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:21.436\nreally understand what information\nthey're gonna give back.\n\n242\n00:12:21.436 --> 00:12:23.472\nCuz that's what you're gonna\nneed to know for the exam.\n\n243\n00:12:23.472 --> 00:12:27.441\nIf you're trying to determine,\nwho logged onto that system last?\n\n244\n00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:29.133\nWhat command would I use in Linux?\n\n245\n00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:31.441\nWhere can I find that\ninformation in Windows?\n\n246\n00:12:31.441 --> 00:12:34.408\nIf I need to see what processes\nare running currently,\n\n247\n00:12:34.408 --> 00:12:37.388\nwhat tool am I gonna use if\nI'm in a Linux environment?\n\n248\n00:12:37.388 --> 00:12:40.910\nWhat tool am I gonna use if\nI'm in a Windows environment?\n\n249\n00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.740\nHow can I look at my TCP/IP configuration\non the different environments?\n\n250\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.740\nThose are the things we\nneed to understand, and\n\n251\n00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.793\nhopefully we've helped\nwith that a little bit.\n\n252\n00:12:48.793 --> 00:12:51.523\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike,\nI know it's a bit of a short episode,\n\n253\n00:12:51.523 --> 00:12:53.915\nkind of an addendum really,\nto the Windows one.\n\n254\n00:12:53.915 --> 00:12:57.359\nBut they kind of go hand in hand,\nlike we've said, a lot of these tools,\n\n255\n00:12:57.359 --> 00:13:00.529\nthey like to bounce around,\nregardless of the operating system.\n\n256\n00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:04.342\nSo if we've shown it to you in Windows,\nit works the same in Linux.\n\n257\n00:13:04.342 --> 00:13:09.032\nSo we tried to really focus in on just the\nLinux tools in this episode specifically.\n\n258\n00:13:09.032 --> 00:13:12.610\nThat being said we're gonna call\nit a day for this here episode.\n\n259\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.500\nMike thanks again for\njoining us yet again.\n\n260\n00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.330\nWe thank you for watching.\n\n261\n00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.370\nBut signing off for ITPro.TV,\nI've

00:00:08.412\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:12.464\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:14.619\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.254\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:18.550\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.084\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n9\n00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:23.720\nwe are back with more on our\nCyberSec First Responder series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.030\nThat's right, and it's been great,\n\n11\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.140\nit's been wonderful,\nhaving a good time doing it.\n\n12\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.970\nJoining us back for\n\n13\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.800\nour festivities and revelries,\nour good friend Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n14\n00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.290\nMike welcome back man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n15\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.620\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel, thanks for\n\n16\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.920\nhaving me back,\nexcited to be here as always.\n\n17\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.960\nAll right, so in this episode,\nwe wanna take a look and\n\n18\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.770\nkinda summarize the methods and\ntools used for malware analysis.\n\n19\n00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.690\nAnd if you are part of that\nfirst responder team, and\n\n20\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.970\nyou have a machine that's\nbeen compromised or\n\n21\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.955\nsuspected of some type of malware\ninfection or bleach of some kind.\n\n22\n00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:58.080\nWe're gonna do analysis on that,\ntry to figure out what happened.\n\n23\n00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.770\nAnd we need to be able to do that\nin a secure, safe environment.\n\n24\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.860\nSo let's talk about some of the things\nwe would use to do that kind of thing.\n\n25\n00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.015\nAnd the first thing we wanna to\ntalk about is sandboxing, right?\n\n26\n00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:15.500\nSandboxing is a way that we're,\nI'm trying to think of a good way,\n\n27\n00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.480\nan analogy I could use.\n\n28\n00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.281\nBut we think about the sandbox as being a\nsafe play area maybe, when you were a kid.\n\n29\n00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.923\nI don't know if that works.\n\n30\n00:01:24.923 --> 00:01:26.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, but that's the idea.\n\n31\n00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.380\nThe idea behind the sandbox is it's,\n\n32\n00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.030\nwe're gonna create an area where\nwe keep everything inside there.\n\n33\n00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.400\nWe can let it do what it wants,\nand it's not gonna get out.\n\n34\n00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400\nAnd it's gonna contain it,\nnot gonna infect any other systems.\n\n35\n00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.100\nSo in that sandbox environment,\nI can run that piece of malware and\n\n36\n00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.410\nI can see what changes it\nmakes to my operating system.\n\n37\n00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.490\nWhat registry keys it does,\nwhat it tries to do.\n\n38\n00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.980\nYou're not gonna let it reach out, but\n\n39\n00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.410\nyou can see it attempting to\nmaybe reach out and talk.\n\n40\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.540\nSo sandboxing is that concept\nof creating a safe area where we\n\n41\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.040\ncan do our little investigation, and let\nthings happen and see what they do, right?\n\n42\n00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.045\nAnd today we have virtualization,\nwhich makes sandboxing really easy.\n\n43\n00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:11.585\nBack in the day,\n\n44\n00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:14.765\nit wasn't nearly as easy, cuz you\nhad to have the physical equipment.\n\n45\n00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:17.732\nA lot of times you'd try to\nduplicate particular environments.\n\n46\n00:02:17.732 --> 00:02:20.430\nSo that meant getting\nadditional equipment.\n\n47\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.120\nAnd it wasn't nearly as easy and\nas inexpensive as it can be nowadays.\n\n48\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.738\nWith virtualization, I can do just\nabout anything I want, right?\n\n49\n00:02:30.738 --> 00:02:35.511\nIf I got a powerful enough machine,\nI can run an entire virtual network,\n\n50\n00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:37.900\nand all the machines on it.\n\n51\n00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.420\nI can image machines and\nthen restore them into virtual machines so\n\n52\n00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.600\nI can have exact duplicates\nof my production environment.\n\n53\n00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.280\nMakes it really easy to kinda work\nwithin that type of a scenario.\n\n54\n00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.560\nSo virtualization key, no matter what\nvirtualization technology you're using.\n\n55\n00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.400\nBut with virtualization, we should be\nfamiliar with what that is, right?\n\n56\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.680\nWe're talking about running\nvirtual clients, virtual servers.\n\n57\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.520\nThese are files that act like machines,\nright, V in Hyper-V, VHD or\n\n58\n00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.480\nVHDX file and a config file.\n\n59\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.779\nThey can network,\nwe can add hardware to them or\n\n60\n00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:17.170\nvirtual hardware, right, network adapters.\n\n61\n00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.910\nWe can install software on them.\n\n62\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.010\nBut we can contain them, right?\n\n63\n00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.290\nWe can limit what they're allowed to do.\n\n64\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.048\nWe create virtual networks that\nare not attached to anything else.\n\n65\n00:03:28.048 --> 00:03:30.650\nOr we can kinda choose,\nwe can say all right,\n\n66\n00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.260\nwe're gonna let it go to the host machine,\nbut no further than that.\n\n67\n00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.640\nOr maybe we need to give\nit external access.\n\n68\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.800\nBut of course, we'd wanna be really,\n\n69\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.180\nreally careful, because we're kinda\nbreaking open our sandbox a little bit.\n\n70\n00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.609\nSo virtualization allows us to do that.\n\n71\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.870\nOther methods we use are threat\nintelligence websites,\n\n72\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.110\nwe've talked about that.\n\n73\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.560\nThere's many, many sites out there,\n\n74\n00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.570\njust about every antivirus software\nvendor has sites that you can go to.\n\n75\n00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.870\nWhere you can find out what\ntheir latest finds are,\n\n76\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.692\nyou can update your definitions.\n\n77\n00:04:00.692 --> 00:04:07.270\nCrowdsourcing is the new thing,\nwhere we're getting, when we're talking\n\n78\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.610\nabout crowdsourcing, we're really talking\nabout getting help from lots of people.\n\n79\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.170\nPaid or unpaid,\ntypically done via the Internet.\n\n80\n00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.030\nWhere you get opinions and help from\nwhomever is willing to step up and help.\n\n81\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.210\nAnd when it comes to cybersecurity and\n\n82\n00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.756\nanalysis like this, it really helps\nto have multiple eyes on the scene.\n\n83\n00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:31.340\nSomebody maybe has seen this before or\nsomething similar, so\n\n84\n00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.565\nwe can get information from each other\nto help us figure out what's going on.\n\n85\n00:04:37.085 --> 00:04:40.189\nVirusTotal, they mentioned\nthat on the objectives,\n\n86\n00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:43.363\nis a website that I know I've\nmentioned before in here.\n\n87\n00:04:43.363 --> 00:04:50.795\nLet's take a peek at that, VirusTotal is\na website you can go to, and they help us.\n\n88\n00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:55.020\nIt's a free service that analyzes\nsuspicious files and URLs to\n\n89\n00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.000\nfacilitate the quick detection of viruses,\nworms, Trojans, and all kinds of malware.\n\n90\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.560\nAnd it allows me to upload files,\nwe can also upload hash values,\n\n91\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.060\nand it can look and see if it has anything\nthat matches that in their database.\n\n92\n00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.400\nFor example if I grab, let's see here,\n\n93\n00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.880\nI just have a couple of DLLs\nfrom my Windows directory.\n\n94\n00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.830\nI'm just gonna drag one, say I'm going to,\nand drop it over here, and\n\n95\n00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.770\nclick Scan It, right?\n\n96\n00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.690\nAnd it tells me this\nfile was last analyzed,\n\n97\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.610\nlooks like on one day and 23 hours ago.\n\n98\n00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.295\nIsn't that interesting, somebody\nelse analyzed this file one day and\n\n99\n00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:34.565\n23 hours ago.\n\n100\n00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:36.185\nI can click reanalyze to\nhave them do it again,\n\n101\n00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:37.945\njust to show you what the site does.\n\n102\n00:05:37.945 --> 00:05:39.485\nBut it's gonna look at it,\n\n103\n00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:43.095\nthat one told me that it's 0 of, I think,\n60-something matches were negative.\n\n104\n00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:50.340\nThis is a great place to go when you're\ntuning your intrusion detection systems.\n\n105\n00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.890\nBecause you can get rid of\nsome of those false positives,\n\n106\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.040\nthings that pop up, like is that really\na malware, or virus, or something bad?\n\n107\n00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.010\nI could take it out here and\nthey can say no, we've scanned that,\n\n108\n00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.070\nwe know what that is.\n\n109\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.730\nThis is what it does,\nand it's safe, right?\n\n110\n00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.450\nSo you can see it's running it\nthrough these different engines, and\n\n111\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.860\nthey work with many, many,\nmany different malware vendors.\n\n112\n00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.415\nAnd we can see as it goes through the list\nhere, I think it'll end of doing, so\n\n113\n00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:15.414\nfar it's done 18.\n\n114\n00:06:15.414 --> 00:06:16.770\nWe'll zoom into that there.\n\n115\n00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.896\nYou can see that I've got\na detection ratio 0 of 18.\n\n116\n00:06:19.896 --> 00:06:23.358\nSo so far, 18 of these,\nnow after 28 malware vendors,\n\n117\n00:06:23.358 --> 00:06:28.016\nthis doesn't match anything that they've\ngot in their database, it's not.\n\n118\n00:06:28.016 --> 00:06:31.950\nAnd so presumably,\nit's a safe file, right?\n\n119\n00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.510\nBut a really good site to\nuse when you find something,\n\n120\n00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.606\nyou don't know what it is, and\nyou need to try to figure that out.\n\n121\n00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:39.960\nTaking out to VirusTotal,\nodds are that they've scanned it or\n\n122\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.099\nat least they can look at it for you, and\nhelp you try to figure out what it is.\n\n123\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.210\nAll right, other things that they call out\non our exam are reverse engineering tools.\n\n124\n00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.590\nThis is when you wanna try\nto take something apart,\n\n125\n00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.880\nfigure out how it's working,\nwatch what it's doing.\n\n126\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.280\n&gt;&gt; It's super easy, too.\n\n127\n00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.310\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; You just run this thing through there,\n\n128\n00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.450\nlook at the code, and\nyou're off to the races.\n\n129\n00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.070\nIt is, we're joking right now,\nit is a little more bit of a complex\n\n130\n00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.060\narea of expertise to get into, but not\nout of the realm of possibilities, right?\n\n131\n00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.930\n&gt;&gt; It's not, and\nit's kind of fun once you get into it.\n\n132\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.710\nThis is how you can start writing\nsome of your own exploits even, and\n\n133\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.230\ncreating exploits.\n\n134\n00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:21.158\nBut there's several programs out there\nthat'll do this, and I think you mentioned\n\n135\n00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:26.980\nOlyDbg, there's WinDbg, there's IDA,\nMy Interactive Disassembler.\n\n136\n00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.040\nThere's Immunity, is it Immunity?\n\n137\n00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.290\n&gt;&gt; Immunity's great, yeah\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n138\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.260\nin fact I'll fire that one up here.\n\n139\n00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.520\nImmunity Debugger is one that I\nhave installed on my actual laptop.\n\n140\n00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.285\n&gt;&gt; The four black boxes of awesome, right?\n\n141\n00:07:40.285 --> 00:07:42.120\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, isn't that great?\n\n142\n00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.350\nIt's a good looking program, isn't it?\n\n143\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.470\nAnd honestly, I've never looked to see if\nI could bump up the font size on here.\n\n144\n00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.167\nBut let me show you what you would\ndo with something like this.\n\n145\n00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:52.469\nI've got, what do I have running?\n\n146\n00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:53.937\nI'm gonna launch WordPad.\n\n147\n00:07:55.929 --> 00:07:57.068\nWell let's launch Word.\n\n148\n00:07:57.068 --> 00:07:58.496\nLet's go ahead and get that guy running.\n\n149\n00:07:58.496 --> 00:08:00.083\nOpen up a blank document here.\n\n150\n00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:01.140\n&gt;&gt; Word Mike, Word.\n\n151\n00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Word.\n\n152\n00:08:02.075 --> 00:08:02.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what you do with\n\n153\n00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.425\nsomething like this,\nyou just say file, attach.\n\n154\n00:08:06.425 --> 00:08:08.980\nRight and I know that's teeny\ntiny I can't even see that,\n\n155\n00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.150\nI'm looking at the computer.\n\n156\n00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.010\nBut I'll go to the file menu,\nchoose attach and\n\n157\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.680\nit shows me what's running\non my system currently.\n\n158\n00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.460\nAnd so I can come in here and\nI can choose, there's Winword there.\n\n159\n00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.020\nI'll grab that one, I'll click attach.\n\n160\n00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.990\n&gt;&gt; It's a big program,\nmight take a second.\n\n161\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.020\n&gt;&gt; Let me pull it open,\nit doesn't like that.\n\n162\n00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.540\nWow, it's interesting.\n\n163\n00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.290\n&gt;&gt; You really made it mad now.\n\n164\n00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.970\n&gt;&gt; I did, didn't I?\n\n165\n00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.100\nYeah, this is great.\n\n166\n00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.030\nLet me just give it, there you go.\n\n167\n00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.210\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n168\n00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.080\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n169\n00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.980\nGot to take a look at that Mike,\nyou have Word, it is a big program.\n\n170\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.770\n&gt;&gt; Plus Microsoft probably doesn't\nwant you reverse engineering it.\n\n171\n00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthat was the point I wanted to make.\n\n172\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.910\n&gt;&gt; Some protections there, yeah.\n\n173\n00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.690\n&gt;&gt; These programs can tell when\nthey're being dumped into debug mode,\n\n174\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.155\nor when somebody is accessing\nthis kind of information.\n\n175\n00:08:55.155 --> 00:08:59.305\nThe good programmer, these modern\nprograms can be configured to do that.\n\n176\n00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.265\nAnd so,\nsome of them will behave differently,\n\n177\n00:09:01.265 --> 00:09:06.985\nsome of that malware is crazyware,\nthey're like if it's in debug or\n\n178\n00:09:06.985 --> 00:09:09.352\nsomebody's grabbing this I'll\ncompletely hide everything and\n\n179\n00:09:09.352 --> 00:09:12.617\nnot show you anything and\nthey're creative like that.\n\n180\n00:09:12.617 --> 00:09:14.857\n&gt;&gt; They're crafty little suckers\nout there writing the malware.\n\n181\n00:09:14.857 --> 00:09:16.897\n&gt;&gt; But what this is doing\nis it's gonna allow me and\n\n182\n00:09:16.897 --> 00:09:18.027\nthis isn't the most exciting one.\n\n183\n00:09:18.027 --> 00:09:20.137\nYou can see it actually paused my program.\n\n184\n00:09:20.137 --> 00:09:22.817\nIf we look down here at the bottom,\nit's pause it.\n\n185\n00:09:22.817 --> 00:09:25.877\nBut what I can see is what's going\non at the different memory addresses\n\n186\n00:09:25.877 --> 00:09:27.380\nthat it's been assigned.\n\n187\n00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.320\nRight?\nAnd I can read those memory locations down\n\n188\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.010\nhere to see what's dumping it in there,\nyou can set up break points,\n\n189\n00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.840\nand as a program executes, you can stop,\nand look, and see what it's doing.\n\n190\n00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.922\nHere I can see the different registers,\nand what's going on, down here.\n\n191\n00:09:42.922 --> 00:09:44.420\nWhat have we got?\n\n192\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.050\nA little bit more information\non those registers.\n\n193\n00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.410\nSo a lot of great information, but\nagain the idea is that I can use this\n\n194\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.080\nto see what a program is doing,\nkinda get a look at the gears if you will,\n\n195\n00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.334\na little bit look under\nthe hood of that program.\n\n196\n00:09:58.334 --> 00:10:01.590\nNow I can click play, and\n\n197\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:06.300\nnow we should maybe something,\nsee down here, somethings are changing.\n\n198\n00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.980\nI don't know if I can make Word active\nto show a little more activity.\n\n199\n00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.463\nWord is not happy about-\n\n200\n00:10:11.463 --> 00:10:12.073\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah-\n\n201\n00:10:12.073 --> 00:10:12.636\n&gt;&gt; Being watched-\n\n202\n00:10:12.636 --> 00:10:13.385\n&gt;&gt; Watched-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n203\n00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:13.892\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n204\n00:10:13.892 --> 00:10:14.672\n&gt;&gt; So then you get the white\n\n205\n00:10:14.672 --> 00:10:19.120\nscreen of nothing and\nmy blue Cheerio spinning around, so\n\n206\n00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.848\nlet's go ahead and cut that video feed,\nthat's not gonna show you anything.\n\n207\n00:10:21.848 --> 00:10:24.135\nBut that's an example of a debugger,\nright?\n\n208\n00:10:24.135 --> 00:10:28.620\nSo we're going to attach it\nto a process and let it watch\n\n209\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.280\nbecause this is how I can see what that\nthing is loading up in the memory,\n\n210\n00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.840\nwhat it's doing, what's the next step,\nwhere is it going to next for\n\n211\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.420\nthe executable or for\nthe next process that it wants to launch.\n\n212\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.600\nYou can also start, as we were saying,\nyou can start kinda doing some\n\n213\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.780\nfuzzing in there, start dumping things in\nand seeing how the application reacts.\n\n214\n00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.290\nVery neat stuff when it comes\nto reverse engineering.\n\n215\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.840\nSo, a lot of those tools available.\n\n216\n00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's how a lot of antivirus corporations\n\n217\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.390\nand things like, they hire people that are\nvery good at using these types of tools.\n\n218\n00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.130\nAnd then when something\ngets found in the wild,\n\n219\n00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.390\nthese guys are probably one of the first\npeople to actually be able to see it.\n\n220\n00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.860\nThey dump it into this type of tool,\nand try to look.\n\n221\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.900\nWell, what is it doing?\n\n222\n00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.440\nIs it trying to infect a Linux or\na Windows type system, maybe a MacOS?\n\n223\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.630\nLook, I know, it's all hex values.\n\n224\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.540\nIt, like we said,\nit gets a little complex.\n\n225\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.910\nBut they start looking at hex values and\n\n226\n00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.710\nsee where is it actually\ntrying to dump you?\n\n227\n00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.730\nReverse those hex values and\nsee what do they come out to be.\n\n228\n00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.350\nThat's system 32.\n\n229\n00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.570\nI know where that lies.\n\n230\n00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.430\nThis is an attack against\na Windows system.\n\n231\n00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.530\nIt's a very nasty one too, and\nthen they write a patch for those types of\n\n232\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.830\nthings and then maybe an antivirus\ndefinition that gets added to your AV.\n\n233\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.090\nYou plug it in, you download and\ninstall the update to your AV system and\n\n234\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.510\nnow you're guarded against it.\n\n235\n00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.110\nSo that's where you start to really\nsee that stuff come in handy.\n\n236\n00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.200\nI've read a lot of guys\nthat do that kind of stuff.\n\n237\n00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.630\nVery interesting,\nway above most people's heads,\n\n238\n00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.440\nthey're way smarter than\nI ever thought of being.\n\n239\n00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.110\nBut really interesting stuff, you should\ndefinitely look into it just for fun.\n\n240\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it is fun once you\nkinda figure out what you're doing,\n\n241\n00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.940\nit can be a lot of fun.\n\n242\n00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.560\nAll right, another thing we can use is\na tool from Microsoft called Strings and\n\n243\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.790\nStrings, it's an odd one.\n\n244\n00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:16.651\nI mean it's gonna look through\napplications for strings.\n\n245\n00:12:16.651 --> 00:12:18.360\nLike wow, okay, it's in Linux 2.\n\n246\n00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.530\nIs it in Linux 2, yeah?\n\n247\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:25.870\nSo it's one of those things where it's\nlike creed, you're looking for strings.\n\n248\n00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.780\nString just being a string of characters,\nright?\n\n249\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.770\nBut it allows you again\nto see what's going on\n\n250\n00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.970\ninside a program that you might\nnot otherwise have access to and\n\n251\n00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.430\nfigure out if it's doing anything\nthat it shouldn't be doing, right?\n\n252\n00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.890\nYou get some executable that lets\nyou download from the internet or\n\n253\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.160\nthat you've purchased.\n\n254\n00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:45.880\nWhat is it doing, right?\n\n255\n00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.156\nWell, I can use strings to go through\nthere, and not like immunity to bugger\n\n256\n00:12:50.156 --> 00:12:54.390\nwhere I'm breaking it open and seeing what\nit's doing, but I'm searching for strings.\n\n257\n00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.390\nWhat might I find?\n\n258\n00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.110\nWell, probably just a bunch of\nstuff that is harmless, but\n\n259\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.560\nyou might see some references to URLs, for\nexample, in the middle of this program\n\n260\n00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.030\nthat should have no business reaching\nout and talking to the internet.\n\n261\n00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.970\nSo why is there an HTTP:// and\nsome URL, right?\n\n262\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.676\n&gt;&gt; Pay no attention to that, Mike.\n\n263\n00:13:12.676 --> 00:13:14.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just ignore that completely.\n\n264\n00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:19.310\nIt's opening up some FTP service,\nor it's listening on some port.\n\n265\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.800\nYou can see this information, and let me\nsee if I can show you an example here.\n\n266\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.560\nI'm gonna fire up a,\nlet me get a terminal here.\n\n267\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:34.480\nAll right, and see if I can show you.\n\n268\n00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.650\nFirst, we'll try to do a little help for\nit.\n\n269\n00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.650\nAll right, and here, again,\neverybody's hero, right, Mark Russinovich,\n\n270\n00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:46.600\nSysinternals, which became Winternals,\nis the guy that wrote this.\n\n271\n00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.880\nAnd I can see there's a few\ndifferent switches for it.\n\n272\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:55.350\nWhat I wanna do is let's\ntry doing strings,\n\n273\n00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.630\nactually let me see what's in here.\n\n274\n00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.285\nIf I do a, let's do it this way.\n\n275\n00:14:01.285 --> 00:14:05.420\nC:\\ where did I put reg dump,\n\n276\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.590\nthat's one a good one to look at,\nsay Mike downloads, boy I\n\n277\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.228\nam just killing it today.\n\n278\n00:14:16.228 --> 00:14:19.290\nWe'll do regdump.exe, there we go.\n\n279\n00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.910\nActually give it the file name not\nthe directory and it does work better.\n\n280\n00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.610\n&gt;&gt; It works a whole lot\nbetter on that line.\n\n281\n00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.070\n&gt;&gt; So I type in strings and I type in\nthe path of the file I want to examine.\n\n282\n00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.790\nI hit enter and it just spits out.\n\n283\n00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.925\nSurprise, surprise a bunch of strings.\n\n284\n00:14:33.925 --> 00:14:39.260\n&gt;&gt; So anywhere it finds string data\njust strings of text, or characters.\n\n285\n00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.560\nHere's what I found.\n\n286\n00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.360\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nAnd it displays them to the screen.\n\n287\n00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.320\n&gt;&gt; By default it's got a three character\nminimum, so it's not gonna find\n\n288\n00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.380\nany two character strings, and you can\nchange that, with some of the switches.\n\n289\n00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.920\nI was showing you\nthe forward-slash question mark,\n\n290\n00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.800\ntake a look at some of the options\nthat go along with this tool, but\n\n291\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.070\nas I scroll through here, I'll notice\nthat I've seen this error before.\n\n292\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:02.930\nIf you try to run reg dump from a running\nsystem, it's like I can't, your memory's\n\n293\n00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:07.260\nin use and it's not going to, you gotta\nget into boot and safe mode or another OS.\n\n294\n00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.360\nBut that's the error, right?\n\n295\n00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.020\nBut that error is somewhere hard\ncoded into that executable so\n\n296\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.040\nit can pop that dialogue box up.\n\n297\n00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, Mike.\n\n298\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.260\nI think you really hit\nthe nail on the head there.\n\n299\n00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.950\nThis is a compiled executable, right?\n\n300\n00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.790\nSomebody wrote this somewhere,\nand I guess Mark Russinovich did.\n\n301\n00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:25.330\n&gt;&gt; He banged this out in C, or C++,\nor whatever language he used, and\n\n302\n00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.940\ncompiled that code.\n\n303\n00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.290\nYou don't get a source file with this.\n\n304\n00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.280\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n305\n00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.520\nSo the source is not available, but\nthis is actually looking into it,\n\n306\n00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.430\nfinding any string it can find and\nthen dumping it out to you.\n\n307\n00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.520\nAnd like Mike has said you never know what\nkind of interesting thing you may find,\n\n308\n00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.480\nthat it may find.\n\n309\n00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nabsolutely this is pretty harmless,\n\n310\n00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:48.000\nit's a safe tool, not a lot of\nexciting things going on down here.\n\n311\n00:15:49.015 --> 00:15:50.290\n&gt;&gt; Except for that reg key dump stuff.\n\n312\n00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.265\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n313\n00:15:51.265 --> 00:15:51.795\n&gt;&gt; Right, that might catch an eye.\n\n314\n00:15:51.795 --> 00:15:54.914\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a description right,\nfor the tool itself.\n\n315\n00:15:54.914 --> 00:15:57.762\nIt's showing me the version number,\n\n316\n00:15:57.762 --> 00:16:02.490\nsome errors that it's able to\nuse when you do something wrong.\n\n317\n00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.860\nWhat I got down here,\n[INAUDIBLE] knows what that is.\n\n318\n00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.210\nYeah, the idea is okay.\n\n319\n00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:12.370\nNothing too bad in here but I'm not\nsaying that all of them are safe, right.\n\n320\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.940\nYou take this and you do some\nprogram that your user wants to use.\n\n321\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.900\nYou take a look at it cuz\nthey wanna install it but\n\n322\n00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.730\nyou don't know if it's safe.\n\n323\n00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.840\nYou can't get access to the source code.\n\n324\n00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.900\nLet's see if we can figure it out.\n\n325\n00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.897\nThat's when we're gonna\nuse those debugger tools.\n\n326\n00:16:23.897 --> 00:16:25.285\nWe're gonna use things like strings.\n\n327\n00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:28.318\nSo we can really dive in and\nlook at it, and\n\n328\n00:16:28.318 --> 00:16:32.600\nsee if we can find anything\nsuspicious inside there.\n\n329\n00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.970\nOr after the fact, right?\n\n330\n00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:37.960\nIf we're doing an incident response and\n\n331\n00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.850\nwe find some strange application on\nthe system that we don't know what it is.\n\n332\n00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.690\nNow this is how we analyze it.\n\n333\n00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.660\nWe use those debugger tools and\nwe fire it up inside our sand box so\n\n334\n00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.000\nthat it can't hurt anything.\n\n335\n00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.145\nAnd we watch with immunity debugger or\n\n336\n00:16:51.145 --> 00:16:54.760\n[INAUDIBLE] to see what\nthat application does.\n\n337\n00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.610\nAnd we open it up with strings and\nwe see what we can find in there.\n\n338\n00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.852\nSee if it's got, like I said,\nany strange URLs or\n\n339\n00:17:03.852 --> 00:17:07.496\nmalware that's ransomed your computer.\n\n340\n00:17:07.496 --> 00:17:10.540\nBut the key is inside the executable\nthat you need to decode it.\n\n341\n00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.227\nYou're gonna pay somebody money\nto try to get your files back.\n\n342\n00:17:14.227 --> 00:17:15.525\nWhat if you could get the key, right?\n\n343\n00:17:15.525 --> 00:17:18.629\nWhat if the wannabe bad\nguy wasn't as smart and\n\n344\n00:17:18.629 --> 00:17:22.060\nhard-coded the decryption key in there,\nright?\n\n345\n00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.450\nYou could use a tool like this\nto find that information.\n\n346\n00:17:25.452 --> 00:17:28.830\nSo a great tool to have at your disposal.\n\n347\n00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.920\nAll right, other stuff we wanna call out.\n\n348\n00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.050\nThis is stuff, again,\nthat you're probably familiar with.\n\n349\n00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.795\nBut it is on the objectives, so\nwe're gonna make sure we mention it.\n\n350\n00:17:36.795 --> 00:17:41.645\nAntivirus tools can help us discover,\n\n351\n00:17:41.645 --> 00:17:45.675\nfind that malware on our system,\ndefinitely important.\n\n352\n00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:50.307\nMalware scanners, I want to say is\nkind of like antivirus tools, but-\n\n353\n00:17:50.307 --> 00:17:52.594\n&gt;&gt; Well, you got the AV versus malware.\n\n354\n00:17:52.594 --> 00:17:54.823\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n355\n00:17:54.823 --> 00:17:56.965\n&gt;&gt; There's a difference between virus and\nmalware.\n\n356\n00:17:56.965 --> 00:17:59.138\nVirus is malware.\n\n357\n00:17:59.138 --> 00:18:01.997\nMalware is the all encompassing-\n&gt;&gt; Kind of the umbrella term for\n\n358\n00:18:01.997 --> 00:18:02.821\nall bad things.\n\n359\n00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:08.956\nWhether it's virus or\nworms or adware or spyware.\n\n360\n00:18:08.956 --> 00:18:12.555\n&gt;&gt; I just want a piece of software\nthat only looks for viruses.\n\n361\n00:18:12.555 --> 00:18:14.717\nI don't want it to look for anything.\n\n362\n00:18:14.717 --> 00:18:15.600\n&gt;&gt; And-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n363\n00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.129\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And you're seeing,\n\n364\n00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:17.187\nwe used to see that a lot-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n365\n00:18:17.187 --> 00:18:18.515\n&gt;&gt; Where antivirus\nsoftware just did viruses.\n\n366\n00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:23.004\nAnd you had to go out and get something\nelse, MalwareBytes to look for adware and\n\n367\n00:18:23.004 --> 00:18:25.345\npop ups and things like that.\n\n368\n00:18:25.345 --> 00:18:26.647\nOr adware and spyware,\n\n369\n00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:30.566\nnow we're seeing that these tools\nare really becoming multipurpose.\n\n370\n00:18:30.566 --> 00:18:31.451\nYou look at Windows for example.\n\n371\n00:18:31.451 --> 00:18:36.690\nWe had Microsoft Security Essentials,\nwhich was their antivirus software.\n\n372\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.400\nBut then they had Windows Defender,\nwhich was spyware and adware,\n\n373\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.908\nkinda like Malwarebytes.\n\n374\n00:18:41.908 --> 00:18:45.725\nWell now we just have Windows Defender,\nbecause they've rolled it all up into one,\n\n375\n00:18:45.725 --> 00:18:47.034\nand it does the whole thing.\n\n376\n00:18:47.034 --> 00:18:51.200\n&gt;&gt; They're like the mixed martial\nartists of anti-malware, right?\n\n377\n00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you gotta be able to do\n\n378\n00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.830\neverything well now.\n\n379\n00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.430\nIt's just not a one trick pony anymore.\n\n380\n00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:00.290\n&gt;&gt; And the malware itself has kind of\ncrossed the lines between adware and\n\n381\n00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.910\nspyware and virus.\n\n382\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.730\nSo there's some mix there as well.\n\n383\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.983\nBut, having good a antivirus\nscanner is obviously important.\n\n384\n00:19:07.983 --> 00:19:09.817\nAnd keep in mind too,\nas I'm sure we're aware.\n\n385\n00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:15.046\nYour antivirus software is only\nas good as your updates, right?\n\n386\n00:19:15.046 --> 00:19:18.151\nIf you're not keeping those\ndefinitions up to date,\n\n387\n00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:21.420\nit's not doing you a whole lot of good.\n\n388\n00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.920\nOther things they want to talk about here\nare going to be some of the languages.\n\n389\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.356\nThey mention something called,\nthis is a funny one, me and\n\n390\n00:19:30.356 --> 00:19:33.386\nDaniel were giggling about it earlier.\n\n391\n00:19:33.386 --> 00:19:34.491\nWell maybe giggling is the wrong word.\n\n392\n00:19:34.491 --> 00:19:36.332\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But we were chuckling.\n\n393\n00:19:36.332 --> 00:19:38.310\n&gt;&gt; We were laughing like hardy men.\n\n394\n00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.189\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n395\n00:19:39.189 --> 00:19:39.985\n&gt;&gt; With beer and stogies.\n\n396\n00:19:39.985 --> 00:19:41.386\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Did you catch that game\n\n397\n00:19:41.386 --> 00:19:41.919\nlast night?\n\n398\n00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:44.025\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:44.962\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n400\n00:19:44.962 --> 00:19:47.910\nthey called it something called MAEC.\n\n401\n00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.960\nAnd this is what we were laughing about.\n\n402\n00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.070\nBecause I said, Daniel,\nhow would you pronounce MAEC?\n\n403\n00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:57.490\n&gt;&gt; And I guess mace, cuz mayak doesn't\nreally make a whole lot of sense.\n\n404\n00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.330\n&gt;&gt; Right and\nthat's what I was going with as well.\n\n405\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.660\nBut after I did some research on it,\n\n406\n00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.770\nit was actually Mike so-\n&gt;&gt; It's you.\n\n407\n00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.310\n&gt;&gt; It's me.\n&gt;&gt; You're spelling your name wrong this\n\n408\n00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:05.600\nwhole time, you didn't even know it.\n\n409\n00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.210\n&gt;&gt; I know, I gotta talk to my mom.\n\n410\n00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.473\nShe spelled it wrong on\nmy birth certificate.\n\n411\n00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:09.218\n&gt;&gt; What were you thinking, lady?\n\n412\n00:20:09.218 --> 00:20:11.028\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyway MAEC,\n\n413\n00:20:11.028 --> 00:20:15.488\nwhich is the Malware Attribute Enumeration\nand Characterization right?\n\n414\n00:20:15.488 --> 00:20:22.680\nBasically this is a standard for\ndiscussing cyber incidents.\n\n415\n00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:28.852\nAnd that's becoming, we're seeing, I'm\ntrying to think of a good way to say this.\n\n416\n00:20:28.852 --> 00:20:30.375\nWe're seeing a lot more of it.\n\n417\n00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:34.195\nAand it's because we've realized, and I\nthink I've mentioned this in this show and\n\n418\n00:20:34.195 --> 00:20:35.375\nother shows we've done.\n\n419\n00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:38.670\nWe're realizing that we're not an island,\nwe can't do this on our own.\n\n420\n00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.400\nWe really need other people to help us,\nright?\n\n421\n00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.970\nYou as an organization can\ntry to do it on your own, but\n\n422\n00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:49.740\ntrying to defend against everything\nout there on your own is kinda crazy.\n\n423\n00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.420\nThere's stuff that you haven't seen but\nsomebody else has.\n\n424\n00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.780\nAnd they know exactly what it's doing and\n\n425\n00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.970\nthey can tell you how to protect\nyourself or what to look for.\n\n426\n00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.620\nSo we're seeing more and\nmore sharing of this information, right.\n\n427\n00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.460\nYears ago you didn't want to admit\nthat your company was breached.\n\n428\n00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:09.710\nBecause it meant losing face,\nlosing customers and things like that.\n\n429\n00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.290\nBut now we're like, okay, look.\n\n430\n00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.289\nIt's a fact that no matter what we do,\n\n431\n00:21:13.289 --> 00:21:15.733\nno matter how secure we\ntry to keep ourselves.\n\n432\n00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:18.633\nThere's a really good chance\nthat we're gonna have to face\n\n433\n00:21:18.633 --> 00:21:20.380\na breach of some kind at some point.\n\n434\n00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:25.010\nSo, let's all work together to try to\nprevent as much of it as possible.\n\n435\n00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.700\nAnd we go back to the concept\nof crowd-sourcing, right?\n\n436\n00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.670\nWorking together, so\nwe wanna share the information.\n\n437\n00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.130\nThe problem is two-fold.\n\n438\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:37.650\nOne I've got to make sure that\nwhen I share this information\n\n439\n00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.500\nI'm not sharing anything that's\ngonna cause me liability.\n\n440\n00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.951\nWhen I say, what do I mean by liability?\n\n441\n00:21:41.951 --> 00:21:46.162\nWell, remember if I'm a healthcare company\nI've got information that's protected\n\n442\n00:21:46.162 --> 00:21:47.520\nunder HIPAA regulations.\n\n443\n00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.210\nThat I have to make sure I follow.\n\n444\n00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:49.955\nWhether I've got a breach or not.\n\n445\n00:21:49.955 --> 00:21:54.503\nI can't release personally identifiable\ninformation that's protected by HIPAA or\n\n446\n00:21:54.503 --> 00:21:56.910\npersonal healthcare information, right?\n\n447\n00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.710\nThat's protected by HIPAA.\n\n448\n00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:02.750\nSo how do I share my information\nwith other organizations and yet\n\n449\n00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.890\nstill keep that safe?\n\n450\n00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.210\nThat's kind of what these\nstandards are helping us do.\n\n451\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.795\nGiving us ways that we can\nshare that information.\n\n452\n00:22:08.795 --> 00:22:11.680\nYet keep our data kind of,\n\n453\n00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.990\nI wanna say, purged of the stuff\nwe shouldn't be releasing.\n\n454\n00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.730\nThe other thing that it does,\n\n455\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:21.435\nwanna say it's two-fold,\nis develop a common language.\n\n456\n00:22:21.435 --> 00:22:24.415\nBecause that's also important,\nif you're communicating,\n\n457\n00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:27.905\nif you don't speak the same language\nit's hard to communicate, right?\n\n458\n00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:29.845\nHopefully all of you\nwatching speak English.\n\n459\n00:22:29.845 --> 00:22:33.290\nUnfortunately I'm not that bright and\nit's the only language I know.\n\n460\n00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:37.930\nBut if you didn't speak English,\nwe'd have a hard time communicating.\n\n461\n00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.950\nSo if you have two organizations\nthat are making up their own terms\n\n462\n00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.650\nwhen they talk about a cyber instant or\na breach of some kind.\n\n463\n00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.845\nHow can they share that\ninformation meaningfully?\n\n464\n00:22:47.845 --> 00:22:51.672\nBy creating a language that everybody can\nuse, we can now talk the same language.\n\n465\n00:22:51.672 --> 00:22:55.812\nWe can talk about incidents using\nthe same terms, the same acronyms.\n\n466\n00:22:55.812 --> 00:23:00.778\nAnd it's gonna make it a lot easier to\nmake the sharing of information more\n\n467\n00:23:00.778 --> 00:23:02.870\nbeneficial to everybody.\n\n468\n00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:06.110\nThere are several standards out there,\nMAEC is one of them.\n\n469\n00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:11.720\nCyber Observable Expression, CybOX is\none that's been around for a little bit.\n\n470\n00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.407\nBut it's actually been rolled\ninto something call STIX.\n\n471\n00:23:15.407 --> 00:23:18.592\nWhich is the Structured Threat\nInformation Expression,\n\n472\n00:23:18.592 --> 00:23:21.155\nStructured Threat Information Expression.\n\n473\n00:23:21.155 --> 00:23:23.450\nAnd there's also something called TAXII,\n\n474\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:28.060\nTrusted Automated Exchange of\nIndicator Information, TAXII.\n\n475\n00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.520\nAnd you'll hear this a lot nowadays.\n\n476\n00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.988\nIt is STIX and TAXII, STIX and TAXII.\n\n477\n00:23:32.988 --> 00:23:35.930\nDon't hear MAEC as much even though\nthat's the one they call out\n\n478\n00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.060\non the objectives here.\n\n479\n00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.720\nSo I threw these other ones here because\nI wanted to make sure we knew about\n\n480\n00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.760\nall of them.\n\n481\n00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:47.932\nBut STIX is really the language that\nwe will use to define the incident.\n\n482\n00:23:47.932 --> 00:23:53.796\nTAXII is more about how we can,\nI'm gonna say transport but share that.\n\n483\n00:23:53.796 --> 00:23:57.615\nShare that information, rules to allow\nthe sharing of that information.\n\n484\n00:23:57.615 --> 00:24:01.235\nSo they kind of work together which\nis why you hear STIX and TAXII.\n\n485\n00:24:01.235 --> 00:24:05.445\nBut MAEC is another one, that M-A-E-C,\nthe Malware Attribute Enumeration and\n\n486\n00:24:05.445 --> 00:24:07.465\nCharacterization that you can use.\n\n487\n00:24:07.465 --> 00:24:10.862\nSo there's not one that everybody uses,\nthere are a couple.\n\n488\n00:24:10.862 --> 00:24:15.035\nBut as long as we're sharing information\nwith other organizations in my same\n\n489\n00:24:15.035 --> 00:24:15.720\nindustry.\n\n490\n00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.400\nIf we're all using the same\none we're good to go right?\n\n491\n00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.570\nSo we pick one and we go with it.\n\n492\n00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.067\nI know the US government for\n\n493\n00:24:22.067 --> 00:24:25.265\nexample I think seems to be\nmoving towards STIX and TAXII.\n\n494\n00:24:25.265 --> 00:24:30.100\nAs their languages of choice for\nsharing cyber breach information.\n\n495\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.900\nIt's what we would use\nif I've had a breach and\n\n496\n00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.630\nI need to call upon the federal\ngovernment here in the states to help me.\n\n497\n00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.430\nI'm gonna use STIX and TAXII to\nshare that cyber breach information\n\n498\n00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.540\nwith Homeland Security, or NSA, or\nwhomever I'm sharing that with.\n\n499\n00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.830\nSo these are just protocols.\n\n500\n00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:47.600\nAgain, rules of how we define things.\n\n501\n00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.440\nTerms we can use, acronyms we can use,\nto all have a common language.\n\n502\n00:24:52.440 --> 00:25:00.240\nTo allow the sharing and the cooperation\nwhen we're doing a cyber investigation.\n\n503\n00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.586\nSo just some things,\nyou have some different methods and\n\n504\n00:25:03.586 --> 00:25:06.523\ndifferent tools that we\nuse in malware analysis.\n\n505\n00:25:06.523 --> 00:25:09.260\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell that kind of rounds it out for you.\n\n506\n00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.174\nGetting the idea of the lay\nof the land when it comes to.\n\n507\n00:25:12.174 --> 00:25:14.317\nOkay we're pretty sure we have\nsome sort of malware here.\n\n508\n00:25:14.317 --> 00:25:17.760\nLet's take a look at that and\nsee what it's trying to do.\n\n509\n00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.600\nAnd then of course ultimately put the\nkibosh on that cuz we don't like malware,\n\n510\n00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.650\nit's bad for us.\n\n511\n00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:23.970\nBut we do need to understand it so\n\n512\n00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:27.390\nthat we can better prepare ourselves for\nthe future of malware.\n\n513\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.230\nMike, thank so much for explaining\nthe common ways in which we do that.\n\n514\n00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:35.490\nLooking at the tools and methodologies\nthat are implemented in that endeavor.\n\n515\n00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.210\nThat being said it's time for\nus to sign off.\n\n516\n00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.040\nWe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n517\n00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.750\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n518\n00:25:41.750 -->

You're\n\n4\n00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.880\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.940\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.190\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan, and\nin today's episode we're continuing\n\n7\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.820\nthrough our series in logical\noperations cyber sec first responder.\n\n8\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.870\nAnd joining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Mister Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.980\nMike how you doing today sir?\n\n10\n00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Wes thanks for\nhaving me back.\n\n11\n00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.620\nIn this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at potential compromise indicators.\n\n12\n00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.813\nWhat are some things that you might see,\nnotice, show up in logs what have you that\n\n13\n00:00:37.813 --> 00:00:43.031\ncould indicate that there has been some\nkind of compromise or breach or incident.\n\n14\n00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:46.116\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat those in this episode.\n\n15\n00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:47.740\nSo let's talk about a few of them.\n\n16\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.270\nYeah the first thing that they call out.\n\n17\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.300\nIt's just some things they\ncall out on the objectives.\n\n18\n00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.450\nWe wanna go over them.\n\n19\n00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.048\nMake sure we're ready for this exam.\n\n20\n00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:56.968\nUnauthorized programs in the Startup menu.\n\n21\n00:00:56.968 --> 00:01:01.351\nWe know this is a great place to put\nmalware, try to get it in your startup so\n\n22\n00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:04.675\nthat it launches every time\nyou start up the machine, or\n\n23\n00:01:04.675 --> 00:01:09.131\nevery time you login to that machine,\nit runs an application or a service,\n\n24\n00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:11.780\nopens up a backdoor that starts listening.\n\n25\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.852\nSo you reboot your machine you\nthink you got it cleaned up, and\n\n26\n00:01:14.852 --> 00:01:18.591\nsure enough there it is again,\nbecause it's hiding in your startup menu.\n\n27\n00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:21.398\nSo this is where you need to\nknow your operating system,\n\n28\n00:01:21.398 --> 00:01:25.474\nunderstand where you can go to see what\nis configured to startup automatically.\n\n29\n00:01:25.474 --> 00:01:30.769\nLike in our Windows systems,\nyou've got our MS Info,\n\n30\n00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:34.590\nsorry and where do they hide it now Wes?\n\n31\n00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.610\n&gt;&gt; Task manager.\n\n32\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.430\n&gt;&gt; Task manager's another place we can go.\n\n33\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.850\nYeah.\nSo that's somewhere I wanna look.\n\n34\n00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.123\nUnauthorized programs, things that\nshouldn't be there, which kinda goes\n\n35\n00:01:44.123 --> 00:01:47.749\nback to one of our earlier topics,\nknowing what should be there.\n\n36\n00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.262\nI can't determine what shouldn't be\nthere if I don't know what's already\n\n37\n00:01:50.262 --> 00:01:51.014\nsupposed to be there.\n\n38\n00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:53.617\nSo having a good baseline for\nall of my systems,\n\n39\n00:01:53.617 --> 00:01:57.196\nunderstanding what that server's\nrunning so that when I look and\n\n40\n00:01:57.196 --> 00:02:02.020\nsee what's starting up automatically I can\nspot the things that shouldn't be there.\n\n41\n00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.780\n&gt;&gt; And you mentioned baseline so if I have\nsomething that I already know is like\n\n42\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.310\na trusted operating system\nI can compare to that too.\n\n43\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.600\nIf I need some kind of real\ntime live inspection because\n\n44\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.960\nlet's face it I know that I've\nopened a task manager before and\n\n45\n00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.900\ngone to the processes tab and I see 15\nSvcHost, I have no clue what they are but\n\n46\n00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.360\nthen I see one and\nit doesn't have any information on it.\n\n47\n00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.980\nBut it's definitely got a file path,\n\n48\n00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.930\nsomethings start to look a little fishy\nhere and we need to inspect it right?\n\n49\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you can get tools that'll\ngive you more information too.\n\n50\n00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.930\nLike PS Exec and some of those\nSysinternals tools on a Windows system,\n\n51\n00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.900\nTop htop, there's several for Lennox.\n\n52\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.910\nThat can show me what's\nusing my resources or\n\n53\n00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.820\nwhat is it that those\nservices are launching?\n\n54\n00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.370\nWhat's associated with them, and\n\n55\n00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.230\nto see what is launching that SvcHost that\nI have seven of and now I've got eight of?\n\n56\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.790\nI'm not sure.\n\n57\n00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.870\nAnd we gotta figure that out.\n\n58\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.880\nMalicious software.\n\n59\n00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.580\nObviously that would be\na sign of a compromise.\n\n60\n00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.210\nIf you come into your system and and\n\n61\n00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.450\nyou notice that there's a keystroke logger\napplication running in your system tray.\n\n62\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.060\nThat's not a good thing, right?\n\n63\n00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.740\nIf I've got something else,\neven something as benign as a sniffer.\n\n64\n00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.990\nOr something like that running.\n\n65\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.090\nIf you didn't install it it's not\nauthorized software it shouldn't be there,\n\n66\n00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.180\nit violates company policy,\nit's something that you didn't install.\n\n67\n00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.820\nThen somebody else did.\n\n68\n00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.080\nWho put this there, what are they doing.\n\n69\n00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.300\nThey're scanning your system or\nyour network from the inside.\n\n70\n00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.130\nThey're using your machine\nas their launch point.\n\n71\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.330\nSo noticing malicious software,\nthe presence of attack tools.\n\n72\n00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.400\nAs a bad guy once I compromise\none machine inside,\n\n73\n00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.470\nmy next goal is to get\nmy tools over there.\n\n74\n00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.260\nI'm gonna e-MCAT or something and\nmake some kind of Troj or\n\n75\n00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.410\ntunnel over your machine,\nsome kind of connection.\n\n76\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.560\nI'm gonna upload my tools over there so\n\n77\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.130\nthat I can start scanning from\nthe inside or launching more attacks\n\n78\n00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.020\nfrom the other side of your firewall,\nwhich is gonna be a lot easier.\n\n79\n00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.430\nSo noticing something like that,\nor noticing\n\n80\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.320\nthat your hard drive's out of space and\nall of a sudden you're a warez provider or\n\n81\n00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.160\nyou're hosting a bunch of movies for\nsomebody, not gonna be good right.\n\n82\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.072\nIt's definitely a sign of some\nkind of attack or compromise.\n\n83\n00:04:18.072 --> 00:04:21.110\nAnother thing we can look for\nregistry entries right.\n\n84\n00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.410\nWe've talked about this,\n\n85\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.410\nwe know we can dive into\nthe registry in a Windows system.\n\n86\n00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.765\nThe registry is where all of my\nsettings are gonna be stored.\n\n87\n00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:32.909\nWe talk about like HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER.\n\n88\n00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.194\nAnd in there,\nif we dive down into these and\n\n89\n00:04:36.194 --> 00:04:41.805\nwe start working our way down in,\nwe'll find keys like run And run once.\n\n90\n00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:48.600\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Wind-\nows, I forget the entire path.\n\n91\n00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.862\nYou get down into their current control\nset run or run once, this is places\n\n92\n00:04:52.862 --> 00:04:57.640\nwhere I can put stuff that's gonna\nexecute when you start up the machine.\n\n93\n00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.850\nMight not necessarily show up\nin your start up items but\n\n94\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.560\nit is going to start when you log in or\nwhen you launch that machine.\n\n95\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.380\n&gt;&gt; I've noticed applications, Mike,\nthat didn't have like a root kit,\n\n96\n00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.700\nwe know has administrative level access\nbut this one didn't happen to have it so\n\n97\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.430\none of the first things I\nstarted to see was H key and\n\n98\n00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.190\nthat was a telltale sign it's a registry,\nright?\n\n99\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.770\nH key.\nAnd\n\n100\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.580\nit was a user account\ncontrol that was blocking it.\n\n101\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.180\nIt would do a series of blocks and\ncome to find out it was\n\n102\n00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.900\na malicious program that was\ntrying to access the registry but\n\n103\n00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.935\nthank goodness in this case as example,\nthe user account control will say no,\n\n104\n00:05:28.935 --> 00:05:31.065\nyou don't have that\nadministrative level access.\n\n105\n00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:34.075\nSo that one was a little bit lucky,\nI kind of got some warnings.\n\n106\n00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:36.765\nBut you know if you already have that\nadministrative level access it might be\n\n107\n00:05:36.765 --> 00:05:37.445\ntransparent to you.\n\n108\n00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:38.565\nYou might not see it, right.\n\n109\n00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:41.965\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nthis is where things can hide,\n\n110\n00:05:41.965 --> 00:05:45.745\nyou think you got rid of all traces\nof say a virus, some kind of malware,\n\n111\n00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:48.560\nsome kind of spyware\n&gt;&gt; You reboot the system and\n\n112\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.800\nthere it is again, right?\n\n113\n00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.280\nAnd it's because they've added it.\n\n114\n00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.890\nThere's a key somewhere, they've added\na registry key that's reinstalling or\n\n115\n00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.470\nrerunning whatever malicious code it\nis every time you fire up that machine.\n\n116\n00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.300\nExcessive bandwidth usage If you\nnoticed the network's going really\n\n117\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.960\nslow or you see that when you look\nat something like Task Manager or\n\n118\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.810\nsome other network monitor\nthat you're using and\n\n119\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.910\nall the bandwidth is being utilized yet,\nyou're not running anything.\n\n120\n00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.550\nYou don't even have a browser open.\n\n121\n00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.750\nWhat's going on?\n\n122\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.420\nSome malware could be on your system and\nit's\n\n123\n00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.520\neither attacking other machines on your\nnetwork, doing scans, exfiltrating data.\n\n124\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.775\nSo any unusual bandwidth utilization is\nan indicator that could be compromised.\n\n125\n00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:37.825\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of interesting, I just\nhappen to have an example for this one.\n\n126\n00:06:37.825 --> 00:06:42.357\nI have a friend and\nboth of them are online gamers.\n\n127\n00:06:42.357 --> 00:06:48.727\nAnd they asked me a couple weeks back they\nsaid, we're using 36 gigs of data a day.\n\n128\n00:06:48.727 --> 00:06:52.177\nAnd if you're gaming that doesn't,\nmaybe does not sound like a lot but\n\n129\n00:06:52.177 --> 00:06:54.125\nall their machines were idle.\n\n130\n00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:56.835\nAnd come to find out when he\nconnected to the gaming server and\n\n131\n00:06:56.835 --> 00:06:59.070\nit downloads some additional content,\n\n132\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.970\nit downloaded some additional content that\nthey didn't want stored on the machine.\n\n133\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.420\nAnd it was calling outbound and\n\n134\n00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.770\nthey ended up finding it, that that was\nwhere all that bandwidth was being used.\n\n135\n00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\n\n136\n00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.260\nthat's a great example of how\nthis could be a good indicator.\n\n137\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.710\nThey had no idea that\nthey were compromised\n\n138\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.880\nuntil they noticed the bandwidth\nutilization issue.\n\n139\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.500\nSomething was sucking\nup their bandwidth and\n\n140\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.090\nthey know it wasn't anything they were.\n\n141\n00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.010\nI've got everything closed and\nI am not doing anything yet\n\n142\n00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.350\nI am still using gigs of data.\n\n143\n00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.390\nSo what is it that is doing this?\n\n144\n00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.640\nThis is an indicator.\n\n145\n00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.733\nAgain, it is not saying\nthere is a comprise.\n\n146\n00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:33.325\nNone of these are you\ndefinitely been comprised.\n\n147\n00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:37.034\nBut these are things that\nare going to get me to think and\n\n148\n00:07:37.034 --> 00:07:42.531\ndo a further investigation and decide\nwhether there has been an incident or not.\n\n149\n00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:47.813\nThey could be ex filtrating data\nusing tools that are sucking\n\n150\n00:07:47.813 --> 00:07:52.578\nup bandwidth and\nthis is where knowing what is normal,\n\n151\n00:07:52.578 --> 00:07:56.941\nagain, what is expected\nis gonna come into play.\n\n152\n00:07:56.941 --> 00:08:01.077\nIf I don't know how much\nbandwidth I'm normally using.\n\n153\n00:08:01.077 --> 00:08:04.681\nThen I'm not going to know when there's\nan excessive amount of bandwidth being\n\n154\n00:08:04.681 --> 00:08:05.229\nutilized.\n\n155\n00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:08.210\nSo in a corporate environment for\nexample we have baselines.\n\n156\n00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.650\nWe've monitored our traffic for\nperiods of time not just for\n\n157\n00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.220\nfive minute slice, all right,\ncuz it could be if it's at lunch time and\n\n158\n00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.440\nwe're not getting a true representation\nof utilization of my network.\n\n159\n00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.490\nSo we monitor it for periods of time\nthroughout the day and then multiple days\n\n160\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.620\na week, as Monday is different from\nThursday, is different from Friday.\n\n161\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.533\nSo understanding what's normal in your\nnetwork is a big part of being able\n\n162\n00:08:31.533 --> 00:08:33.760\nto recognize these indicators.\n\n163\n00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.663\nBecause if I don't know what should be\nthere, if I don' know the way things\n\n164\n00:08:36.663 --> 00:08:39.570\nnormally behave,\nI'm not gonna notice something abnormal.\n\n165\n00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.120\n&gt;&gt; That's a great example because\nyou know how they found out,\n\n166\n00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.180\nit ended up being their ISP called them\nand said that they had hit their bandwidth\n\n167\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.120\ncap in just a couple of weeks and\nthey knew they had months to go.\n\n168\n00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.753\nAnd they have like a terabyte of data so\n\n169\n00:08:49.753 --> 00:08:53.124\nthey didn't know it until it was\nan outside source saying, hey, we're gonna\n\n170\n00:08:53.124 --> 00:08:56.256\ncharge more money for bandwidth\nbecause you've already used it all up.\n\n171\n00:08:56.256 --> 00:08:58.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and in that case,\nyou're like, wait a second.\n\n172\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:03.305\nAnd we've been with this ISP for how long,\nand I've never had this problem before.\n\n173\n00:09:03.305 --> 00:09:05.440\nWe've never hit our cap before.\n\n174\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.440\nNow all of a sudden we have,\nthat's a change.\n\n175\n00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.950\nThat's something out of the ordinary.\n\n176\n00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.460\nIt's like, hm,\nthat's an indicator that, hey,\n\n177\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.260\nI need to do a little more digging and\nsee what is going on here.\n\n178\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.190\nOff hours usage, would be another one.\n\n179\n00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:22.715\nWhy do I have a record of somebody logging\ninto this system at 11 o'clock at night?\n\n180\n00:09:22.715 --> 00:09:25.380\nOr office is shut down at 5,\nsometimes people work until 6,\n\n181\n00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.110\nbut there's nobody in\nthe building after 7 o'clock.\n\n182\n00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:33.022\nAnd yet, I've got DNS queries going on\nfrom our internal DNS servers at 11\n\n183\n00:09:33.022 --> 00:09:34.346\no'clock at night.\n\n184\n00:09:34.346 --> 00:09:38.140\nOr I've got files being modified\nin the middle of the night.\n\n185\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:43.390\nOr I've got computer is being logged onto,\naccounts being authenticated.\n\n186\n00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.260\nI go look at my security logs and\n\n187\n00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.870\nI see where Wes was authenticated\nat 11 o'clock at night last night.\n\n188\n00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.150\nI ask Wes, he's like no, I was at home,\nin fact, I was in bed by that time.\n\n189\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.022\nSo it wasn't me, right?\n\n190\n00:09:54.022 --> 00:09:57.947\nThere's a good indicator\nthat something is going on.\n\n191\n00:09:57.947 --> 00:10:03.182\nNew administrators or just user accounts\nin general, big, big indicator here.\n\n192\n00:10:03.182 --> 00:10:05.340\nAll right, this is what the bad\nguys are gonna try to do.\n\n193\n00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.200\nThey want that backdoor account.\n\n194\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.370\nIf they've compromised the system, maybe\nthey've cracked somebody's password and\n\n195\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.700\nso they're able to get into the system.\n\n196\n00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.350\nWell, that person might or\n\n197\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.460\nmight not realize that their\npassword's been cracked.\n\n198\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.890\nEventually, they're gonna change their\npassword because of the password policies,\n\n199\n00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.300\nand I'm gonna lose my access that I had.\n\n200\n00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.520\nSo as a bad guy, what I wanna try to\ndo is create that back door account.\n\n201\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.100\nCreate an account that's sitting\nthere that I know the password to and\n\n202\n00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.390\nuse that as my access.\n\n203\n00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.467\nI would love to have\nan administrator account.\n\n204\n00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:41.430\nSo you start seeing new accounts on your\nsystem when there shouldn't be one there.\n\n205\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.170\nOr you go look at your administrators\ngroup and there's a user account in there.\n\n206\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.270\nAnd maybe it's a legitimate user on your\nsystem but, they're not an administrator,\n\n207\n00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.220\nyet their account is now in\nthe domain admins group or\n\n208\n00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.050\nthe enterprise admins group,\nsomething like that, right?\n\n209\n00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.520\nThis is something that's gonna indicate\nthat there's been some kind of compromise.\n\n210\n00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.570\nGuest account usage.\n\n211\n00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:02.770\nNow, do we use it?\n\n212\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.320\nShould we have it locked down so\nit can't be used?\n\n213\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.500\nDisabled, what have you.\n\n214\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.156\nGuest access should be limited if\nnot done away with altogether.\n\n215\n00:11:10.156 --> 00:11:13.440\nBut all of a sudden, I'm seeing where\nthe guest account is being used.\n\n216\n00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.790\nA good indicator that,\nthat something has gone wrong, or\n\n217\n00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.068\nthat there has been some\ntype of compromise.\n\n218\n00:11:18.068 --> 00:11:21.540\nAgain, I wanna make sure I stress\nthat none of this is there has been\n\n219\n00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.790\na compromise, right?\n\n220\n00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.635\nThere could be a legitimate reason for\nit, maybe a developer was using a guest\n\n221\n00:11:26.635 --> 00:11:29.780\naccount as a test for\nsomething they were working on.\n\n222\n00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.240\nSo it's not a guarantee that\nthere's been a compromise.\n\n223\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.060\nBut it's an indicator and\nthis is what we're looking for,\n\n224\n00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.630\nthis is what our job is.\n\n225\n00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.280\nRemember we talk about our processes.\n\n226\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.840\nFirst, we talked about preparation and\nincident response.\n\n227\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.180\nAnd then we talk about detection,\ndetecting there's this incident.\n\n228\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.380\nHow do we do that?\n\n229\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.410\nAll of these things we're\ntalking about right now, right?\n\n230\n00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.526\nThese are indicators.\n\n231\n00:11:49.526 --> 00:11:52.600\n&gt;&gt; We use technologies inside\nof our communications.\n\n232\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.330\nAnd these different technologies, they're\na part of normal communications, Mike.\n\n233\n00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.483\nBut, we also have to pay\nattention to them, right?\n\n234\n00:11:58.483 --> 00:12:02.359\nThings like our protocols and stuff like\nthat cuz these could be sources of attack\n\n235\n00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:04.930\nas well or\nsources that we see some kinda compromise.\n\n236\n00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm running a firewall,\nbut all of a sudden,\n\n237\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.560\nI see that port 53739 is open.\n\n238\n00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:11.540\nWhat is running on that?\n\n239\n00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.200\nWhat is listening on that?\n\n240\n00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.572\nThere are known ports for\nsome certain Trojans or\n\n241\n00:12:16.572 --> 00:12:18.883\nbackdoors that you can look for.\n\n242\n00:12:18.883 --> 00:12:21.230\nIf you see that port,\nyour machine is listening on it,\n\n243\n00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.630\ngood indicator that it's been compromised.\n\n244\n00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:26.500\nCan't count on that because\nbad guys are smart.\n\n245\n00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.530\nAnd they understand that they can\nchange the port that it's listening on.\n\n246\n00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.710\nSo it's hopefully one maybe\nyou don't recognize it.\n\n247\n00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.010\nBut, any ports that are open\nthat shouldn't be, or\n\n248\n00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.300\nthat you're not used to seeing.\n\n249\n00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.448\n&gt;&gt; Hm, wait, that means,\n\n250\n00:12:39.448 --> 00:12:42.962\nI need to know what ports were supposed\nto be open in the first place, right?\n\n251\n00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:46.055\n[LAUGH] The same concept I keep,\nI know I keep harping on that but\n\n252\n00:12:46.055 --> 00:12:49.820\nbaselines are what really give us\nthe ability to notice this kind of thing.\n\n253\n00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.780\nIf I don't know what ports are supposed\nto be open on that server,\n\n254\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.190\nthen I'm not gonna recognize\nwhen unusual ports are open.\n\n255\n00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.656\n&gt;&gt; Know what the norm is, right?\n\n256\n00:12:58.656 --> 00:13:02.785\nKnow what the norm is, you can't know what\nthe abnormal is unless you know what is\n\n257\n00:13:02.785 --> 00:13:04.560\nnormal within your environment.\n\n258\n00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.199\nWhether you're talking about a system,\nits configuration state.\n\n259\n00:13:08.199 --> 00:13:10.800\nA connectivity device,\nits configuration state.\n\n260\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.410\nOr something as basic as\nliek access policies for,\n\n261\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.780\neven visitors within your building.\n\n262\n00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.100\nYou have to have that\ndocumentation handy so\n\n263\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.980\nyou know what abnormality\nmight laid in your network.\n\n264\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.274\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly right.\n\n265\n00:13:22.274 --> 00:13:24.699\nProtocol, same thing.\n\n266\n00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:29.970\nLet's say, we're monitoring network\ntraffic and we see some Telnet.\n\n267\n00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.800\nNone of my admins use Telnet anymore.\n\n268\n00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.300\nWe've got other secure\nprotocols that we use.\n\n269\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.650\nWhy am I seeing Telnet on my network?\n\n270\n00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.711\nThere's FTP traffic going by.\n\n271\n00:13:38.711 --> 00:13:41.681\nWe don't use FTP for\nanything, all right, but yet,\n\n272\n00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:44.410\nthere's FTP traffic on my network.\n\n273\n00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.080\nSomething is not right.\n\n274\n00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.645\nSo, can I say it one more time?\n\n275\n00:13:48.645 --> 00:13:50.309\nIf you don't know what\nprotocols should be there,\n\n276\n00:13:50.309 --> 00:13:52.990\n[LAUGH] you're not gonna know what\nprotocols shouldn't be there, right?\n\n277\n00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.460\nSorry, I swear,\nthat's the last time I'll say it.\n\n278\n00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.527\nJust assume that the rest of\nthe list is exactly like that.\n\n279\n00:13:57.527 --> 00:14:00.600\n[LAUGH] Unknown protocols.\n\n280\n00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.768\nService disruption,\nDNS is suddenly not available or\n\n281\n00:14:05.768 --> 00:14:08.585\nsporadically unavailable.\n\n282\n00:14:08.585 --> 00:14:12.470\nDHCP having issues getting IP addresses.\n\n283\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:17.070\nEventually it fixes itself but,\nit seems to be a problem now and again.\n\n284\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.880\nWhat is causing those disruptions?\n\n285\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.426\nCould be attempt to denial\nof service attacks.\n\n286\n00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:24.855\nIt could be somebody trying\nto compromise those services,\n\n287\n00:14:24.855 --> 00:14:28.214\ncould be somebody sucking up\nall your network bandwidth,\n\n288\n00:14:28.214 --> 00:14:33.098\nwhich is preventing your DNS server from\nresponding to queries in a timely fashion.\n\n289\n00:14:33.098 --> 00:14:36.400\nAll right, I mean,\nthey could lead one could into another.\n\n290\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.150\nSo, looking at service disruption.\n\n291\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.360\nWebsite defacement, pretty obvious\nindicator hopefully for most of us.\n\n292\n00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.630\nIf I go to my website and\n\n293\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:51.790\nI see Mickey Mouse doing profane things on\nthe front page of my website or there's\n\n294\n00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:57.010\nmustaches drawn on all of the people\non my website, that's not a good thing.\n\n295\n00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:02.620\nOr, some fanatical group has put\nsome message across my website.\n\n296\n00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.468\nGood indicator of a compromise unless one\nof your employees is testing something out\n\n297\n00:15:07.468 --> 00:15:08.020\nfor you.\n\n298\n00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.234\nA good idea that somebody's been doing\nsomething that they shouldn't have\n\n299\n00:15:11.234 --> 00:15:12.390\nbeen doing.\n\n300\n00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.230\nSo, defacement of your website.\n\n301\n00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:19.509\nIt used to be a very common thing, that's\nwhat the bad guys would always try to do.\n\n302\n00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:22.541\nUnauthorized changes or modifications.\n\n303\n00:15:22.541 --> 00:15:27.029\nAgain, if I see new rules showing\nup in my firewall that are allowing\n\n304\n00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:29.728\ncertain types of packets, or denying.\n\n305\n00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:32.381\nMaybe they're trying to do a denial of\nservice, that'd be a good way to do it.\n\n306\n00:15:34.961 --> 00:15:37.828\nChanges to system configurations,\n\n307\n00:15:37.828 --> 00:15:42.821\nchanges to settings on systems,\nsuspicious files that we see,\n\n308\n00:15:42.821 --> 00:15:47.920\nthey could be DLLs that they're\ntrying to replace on our system.\n\n309\n00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.774\nIt could be,\nif they're scanning the network,\n\n310\n00:15:51.774 --> 00:15:53.794\nit could be storing that\ninformation in a file.\n\n311\n00:15:53.794 --> 00:15:57.170\nAnd then, getting ready to FTP it\nback home to whomever's trying to\n\n312\n00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.600\ncollect this information.\n\n313\n00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.277\nSo finding the suspicious\nfiles on your servers.\n\n314\n00:16:02.277 --> 00:16:05.050\nReceive a suspicious emails.\n\n315\n00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:11.046\nI guess it could be\nan indicator of a compromise.\n\n316\n00:16:11.046 --> 00:16:16.280\nEmails are easy to forge, but definitely\nsomething that we would want to look at,\n\n317\n00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.940\nif I'm getting emails from Wes,\nand Wes is on vacation.\n\n318\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.520\nAnd I know he's not sitting\nat a computer doing work.\n\n319\n00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.460\nYet I'm getting emails from him,\ntalking about hey,\n\n320\n00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.900\nwe need to reset your password or\nsomething like that.\n\n321\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.460\nOr hey, click on this link to check\nout the latest report from so and so.\n\n322\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.950\nBut Wes isn't even here.\n\n323\n00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.140\nSo suspicious emails,\nwe gotta think about that.\n\n324\n00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:44.580\nGetting that email that says royalty in\nsome country has decided to leave you some\n\n325\n00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:49.050\nmoney cuz you're a long lost relative,\nyou should know better than that.\n\n326\n00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.760\nWhat were we walking about the other day?\n\n327\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:56.450\nGet an email that says, hey, here's your\ntracking information for your DHL package.\n\n328\n00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.150\nIf you didn't order\nanything don't click on it.\n\n329\n00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:04.800\nYou didn't get some surprise package\nthat like wonder what I got.\n\n330\n00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.800\nNo if you didn't order anything\ndon't click on the link.\n\n331\n00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.430\nYou should know this right.\n\n332\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:14.170\nWas I expecting that email from Wes, did\nI ask him to send me that spreadsheet, or\n\n333\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.260\nis it just an email that happens\nto say it's from Wes and\n\n334\n00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.470\nit's got a macro virus in there\nin that Excel document, right?\n\n335\n00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.110\nSo suspicious emails.\n\n336\n00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.460\nUnauthorized sessions.\n\n337\n00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.070\nMost operating systems,\nI can go in and I can see,\n\n338\n00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:30.070\nwe're talking about operating systems\nthat allow multiple sessions, right?\n\n339\n00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.370\nMultiple people can be remoted\ninto a server at the same time.\n\n340\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.760\nWe have fast user switching and\nthings like that in our\n\n341\n00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.500\nclient operating systems where more than\none person can be logged into the system.\n\n342\n00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.370\nIf you see a, if you go to your\nTask Manager for example in Windows and\n\n343\n00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.570\nyou see sessions from some user\naccount that you don't recognize.\n\n344\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:51.570\nThis could be an issue,\n\n345\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.805\ncould be an indicator that somebody\nhas accessed your your machine.\n\n346\n00:17:55.805 --> 00:17:59.245\nFailed log ins are another\ngreat example of\n\n347\n00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.365\nan indicator that there's\nbeen a compromise.\n\n348\n00:18:01.365 --> 00:18:03.445\n&gt;&gt; Okay now you've thrown\na curve ball at me.\n\n349\n00:18:03.445 --> 00:18:04.495\nFailed log ins.\n\n350\n00:18:04.495 --> 00:18:08.120\nNow failed log ins to me means\nsomebody's not in my system\n\n351\n00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.280\nwhy would failed logins be\nsomething I should watch?\n\n352\n00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.910\n&gt;&gt; Well, because it's a good indicator\nthat they're trying to get in\n\n353\n00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:13.700\nthere, right?\n\n354\n00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.310\nI mean, we're gonna have failed log ups.\n\n355\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.200\nPeople are going to forget their\npasswords especially the day after they\n\n356\n00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.160\nchanged them.\n\n357\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.490\nPeople are going to be mistyping\ntheir password because they weren't\n\n358\n00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.460\nsitting at their desk.\n\n359\n00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.710\nI don't know how many of you guys\nhave hopefully done this as well or\n\n360\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:27.690\nI'm the only one.\n\n361\n00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.050\nBut I've been completely\noff on my home row,\n\n362\n00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.990\nwhere your hands are supposed to be on\nthe keyboard, and typed my password, and\n\n363\n00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.440\nended up typing crazy gobbledygook\ncuz I was off by one letter.\n\n364\n00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.090\nAnd so\nyou're gonna have failed logins, but\n\n365\n00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.070\nwe need to look at those,\nwe need to make sure.\n\n366\n00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.730\nIs it failed login after login,\nis it a lot of failed logins,\n\n367\n00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.440\nare they occurring at hours\nwhen that user's not there.\n\n368\n00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.570\nThat user's been on vacation.\n\n369\n00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.000\nThey're not even in town this week and\nyet I've got failed log in attempts.\n\n370\n00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.730\nThose are good indicators that someone is\ntrying to do some password guessing or\n\n371\n00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.070\nsome dictionary attacks or\nroot force attack on your passwords.\n\n372\n00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.470\n&gt;&gt; I think I just had a light bulb moment.\n\n373\n00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.450\nSo context is key to failed logins.\n\n374\n00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:11.530\nLike you say, Monday morning, it happens\nto be 8:30 here and we've got five or\n\n375\n00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.700\nsix people, user accounts failed\nto login a couple of attempts.\n\n376\n00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.700\nMaybe they haven't had their coffee yet,\nlike you said,\n\n377\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.360\nonce something happens after hours\nwhen the business isn't open.\n\n378\n00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.870\nSo when it comes to failed logins\ncontext is really key right?\n\n379\n00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely, you go and you look\nat your login and you see where Such and\n\n380\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.910\nsuch employee logged in at 7:25,\nand accessed this file server.\n\n381\n00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.050\nYou go talk to that employee hey,\n\n382\n00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:38.890\nwhat were you doing on that file\nserver at 7:25 in the morning?\n\n383\n00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.870\nI didn't get here until 8 o'clock, I don't\nknow what you're talking about, right.\n\n384\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.900\nAnd maybe before that there was a couple\nof failed login attempts when they were\n\n385\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.880\ntrying to do password guessing.\n\n386\n00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.450\nAnd then rogue hardware is\nanother [LAUGH] indicator,\n\n387\n00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:55.330\na very good indicator that there\nmight be some kind of compromise.\n\n388\n00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.650\nA strange access point\nshowing up somewhere,\n\n389\n00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:05.060\na keystroke logger plugged in\nto the back of your computer.\n\n390\n00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.560\nGosh, what else.\n\n391\n00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.240\nPhone drives, I mean, maybe not, I don't\nknow if it would fall under rogue hardware\n\n392\n00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.280\nbut It's what we call baiting when you\ntake thumb drives and you drop them out in\n\n393\n00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.560\nthe parking lot or in the lobby and\nwho can resist, their gonna pick it up and\n\n394\n00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.930\nthey're gonna take it right into work and\nplug it into their work computer,\n\n395\n00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:27.600\nno idea where that thumb drive came from,\nno idea what's on it.\n\n396\n00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.810\nBut there could be something juicy so I'm\ngoing to plug it into my work computer.\n\n397\n00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.590\nThose are indicators of a compromise.\n\n398\n00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.060\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting we're\nsitting here thinking and\n\n399\n00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.620\nI know we're kind of\nchuckling about this one.\n\n400\n00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.750\nAnd one of the things that you've always\nstressed is that if your physical security\n\n401\n00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.440\nisn't good,\nI mean everything is going to be hampered.\n\n402\n00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.580\nBut in defense of the concept here,\nI mean wireless\n\n403\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.320\nrogue access point we'd really be\nsitting outside the building, right.\n\n404\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.450\nI don't necessarily have to have physical\naccess to your network to throw up one of\n\n405\n00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.290\nthese rogue access points here.\n\n406\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.170\nAnd now we've got DHCP going on,\nand I've got people connecting\n\n407\n00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.340\nthat should be connected to a legitimate\nnetwork and now they're not,\n\n408\n00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.750\ndenial of service, interruption of\nservices like you're talking about, but\n\n409\n00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.560\nthey don't necessarily have to have\nphysical access to my network.\n\n410\n00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nabsolutely they can be sitting outside and\n\n411\n00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.440\nif that access point has a good enough\nrange on it then they can SSID that's\n\n412\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.170\nthe same as yours and\npeople are gonna connect to it.\n\n413\n00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:20.019\nAnd either they're gonna get denial of\nservice cuz it's not gonna get anywhere or\n\n414\n00:21:20.019 --> 00:21:21.382\nthey're gonna be phished.\n\n415\n00:21:21.382 --> 00:21:23.950\nThere gonna be redirected to\nsites that are doing nothing but\n\n416\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.630\ncapturing logon information,\npasswords, what have you.\n\n417\n00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.700\nIt'll be a good example of rogue hardware.\n\n418\n00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.990\nAnd not just that people could, if they\nhad physical access to your building like\n\n419\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.150\nour building here has public access.\n\n420\n00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.760\nPeople can come in, there's a coffee shop\nin our lobby that people can access.\n\n421\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.080\nThere's other businesses in here.\n\n422\n00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.100\nSo there is some common areas.\n\n423\n00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:52.210\nIf the information was\nvaluable enough I can find\n\n424\n00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:57.730\nseveral places that I could\nleave a laptop or a smartphone.\n\n425\n00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.540\nWe can load up all kinds of\nthings on smartphones now.\n\n426\n00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.900\nGet it connected, leave it somewhere,\nmaybe nobody finds it, and\n\n427\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.230\nI start running scans from it.\n\n428\n00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.900\nOr it gives me some kind of remote\naccess back into your network.\n\n429\n00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.530\nI have read about attacks where\nthey crack open a computer case and\n\n430\n00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.660\nthrow an old phone in there,\n\n431\n00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:19.070\nconnect it up to one of the ports on the\nboard, close the case up and walk away.\n\n432\n00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:23.390\nAnd now they can dial into that phone and\ndo what they need to do.\n\n433\n00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.910\nSo, physical security\nis a big part of that.\n\n434\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.570\nAnd rogue hardware in general,\nwe need to find it.\n\n435\n00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.662\nTypically when we're talking\nabout rogue hardware,\n\n436\n00:22:30.662 --> 00:22:33.930\nwe are talking about\nwireless access points,\n\n437\n00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:38.120\ntrying to slip rouge access points in\nthere to get people to connect to it.\n\n438\n00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.800\nAnd it might be unintentional, it could be\nthat, hey I just wanted to play around I\n\n439\n00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.820\nbought this wireless access point,\nI brought it into work so\n\n440\n00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.390\nthat I could play with it a bit before\nI take it home and configure it.\n\n441\n00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:50.600\nI got it setup,\nI didn't think it was any big deal.\n\n442\n00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.870\nYeah, it's blowing a hole through every\nbit of security I have because you didn't\n\n443\n00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.240\nset a password on it, people can connect\nto it, and you plugged it into our work\n\n444\n00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.895\nnetwork, or like you said, it's providing\nDHCP and it's not the right scope.\n\n445\n00:23:02.895 --> 00:23:06.525\nIt's causing denial of service because\npeople can not connect to our network cuz\n\n446\n00:23:06.525 --> 00:23:10.895\nthey are getting the wrong IP address or\nthe wrong subnet mask or what have you.\n\n447\n00:23:10.895 --> 00:23:15.985\nSo rogue hardware, definite indicator that\nthere has been some kind of compromise.\n\n448\n00:23:15.985 --> 00:23:18.365\nSo when we sum all this up.\n\n449\n00:23:18.365 --> 00:23:19.685\nI mean, there's a lot of things.\n\n450\n00:23:19.685 --> 00:23:22.580\nThis list is not inclusive,\nright, or not all inclusive.\n\n451\n00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:26.590\nThere's a lot of other things that we can\nput on here that would indicate attack.\n\n452\n00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:30.130\nBut these are some of the common ones\nthat they call out on at least on this\n\n453\n00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:34.730\nparticular exam and these are things\nthat should make us think.\n\n454\n00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:39.190\nThat should make us start our\nincident handling process.\n\n455\n00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:44.900\nAt least that investigation phase is\nthis the beginning of an attack or\n\n456\n00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.310\nhas there been a compromise?\n\n457\n00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.140\nMany times you're gonna find\nout that it's legitimate.\n\n458\n00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:54.450\nLike I said, that developer decided\nFTP was a better protocol to use so\n\n459\n00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.440\nhe's been using it, which was unusual.\n\n460\n00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.760\nWe didn't normally see\nFTP traffic on there.\n\n461\n00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.225\nWe do our initial investigation and\nwe find that it's benign,\n\n462\n00:24:03.225 --> 00:24:05.860\nright that it's okay.\n\n463\n00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:09.760\nLike I said it doesn't always indicate\nthat there has been a compromise, but\n\n464\n00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:14.710\nthese are things that should trigger\nus to take a closer look and\n\n465\n00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.870\nsee if there is a potential compromise.\n\n466\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.600\n&gt;&gt; Seems like these\ncompromises can really,\n\n467\n00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.070\nreally weaken our security for sure.\n\n468\n00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.060\nAnd it is good to know what\nare we looking for, right.\n\n469\n00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.685\nIf we're the watchman on the wall,\nwe gotta know what beacons that\n\n470\n00:24:27.685 --> 00:24:30.545\nwe're gonna be looking at,\nwhat flags, what alarms.\n\n471\n00:24:30.545 --> 00:24:33.185\nSo great job, Mike,\na lot of great explanations here.\n\n472\n00:24:33.185 --> 00:24:35.145\nIt does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n473\n00:24:35.145 --> 00:24:38.615\nBut before we do, when it comes to\npotential compromise and indicators,\n\n474\n00:24:38.615 --> 00:24:41.465\ndo you got any final words that you\nmight like to impart to our viewers?\n\n475\n00:24:41.465 --> 00:24:45.095\n&gt;&gt; I will say, I think that we stressed it\nenough that you have to have a baseline.\n\n476\n00:24:45.095 --> 00:24:47.555\nRight, you've gotta know what\nshould be there, what's normal,\n\n477\n00:24:47.555 --> 00:24:52.530\nwhat we expect to see for any of these\nbefore we can see them as anomalies and\n\n478\n00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.640\nsomething that I need\nto investigate further.\n\n479\n00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.430\nSome of this can be automated, some of\nthis is gonna be a very manual process.\n\n480\n00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:03.070\nI need to do wireless surveys now to walk\naround and look for rogue access points.\n\n481\n00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.590\nBut I can also have IDSs and\n\n482\n00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:07.720\nIPSs that know what normal\nbehavior is on my network.\n\n483\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.780\nAnd they can alert me that\nthere's a strange protocol, or\n\n484\n00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.129\nan unusual amount of\nbandwidth being consumed.\n\n485\n00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.000\nWe can monitor those\nstart up programs using\n\n486\n00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.250\ndifferent software that\nlooks at our machines.\n\n487\n00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.700\nWe can do white list and\nblack list to control software.\n\n488\n00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.750\nSo maybe try to prevent some of that or\n\n489\n00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:32.260\nget an alert when somebody tries to\ninstall some unauthorized software.\n\n490\n00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.770\nSo a lot of this is not,\nwhat's a good way to say this?\n\n491\n00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.180\nSome of it's gonna be very manual\n\n492\n00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:43.150\nothers we might be able to use tools to\nhelp us notice these kind of indicators.\n\n493\n00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.900\n&gt;&gt; All right a lot of\ngreat information Mike,\n\n494\n00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.560\nwe do appreciate you being here\nas always in the studios with us.\n\n495\n00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.400\nAnd we do appreciate\nthe viewer watching but\n\n496\n00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.080\nit looks like it is time\nto wrap this one up.\n\n497\n00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.450\nSigning out for\nITProTV I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n498\n00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:56.360\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n499\n00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.937\n&gt;&gt; And

00:00:36.317\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you.\n\n15\n00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:39.385\nYeah, so\nmore good old CyberSec First Responder.\n\n16\n00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:42.209\nIn this one, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at best practices.\n\n17\n00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.351\nIt's one of our objectives on our exam,\n\n18\n00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:48.708\nexplain the importance of best practices\nin preparation for incident response.\n\n19\n00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:52.631\nSo, really, if I just need to explain\nthe importance of best practices,\n\n20\n00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:53.896\nthen I should just say,\n\n21\n00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:58.036\nit's very important that you have\nsome best practices, no, I'm kidding.\n\n22\n00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:01.003\nWhen we talk about best practices for\nincident response,\n\n23\n00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:04.090\nthere's definitely a few things\nthat we wanna keep in mind,\n\n24\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.708\nstarting with preparation and\nplanning, right?\n\n25\n00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:11.503\nThis is probably one of the most important\nparts, or one of the best, best practices,\n\n26\n00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:14.718\nif you will, it's gotta be up\nthere on the top of the list,\n\n27\n00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:18.417\nbecause really preparation and\nplanning is what it's all about.\n\n28\n00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:22.066\nWe have to be ready for\nhandling an incident.\n\n29\n00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.454\nWe can't just sit around and go, yeah,\n\n30\n00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:27.341\nif we ever have an incident\nwe'll do something.\n\n31\n00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:30.488\nAnd then when the incident comes along,\nnobody knows what to do,\n\n32\n00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:34.626\nwho's supposed to do what, who's supposed\nto contact whom, what tools do you use?\n\n33\n00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:38.391\nThey bring out tools, and they say,\nwe've got our toolkit ready,\n\n34\n00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:42.466\nwe've got all this stuff, we've\ndownloaded our license, or what have you,\n\n35\n00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:46.201\nnever used it before, never fired it up,\nno idea exactly how to use it.\n\n36\n00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:50.020\nAnd that's not the way to go about it,\nbecause you're going to miss information.\n\n37\n00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.735\nYou're gonna miss evidence,\nif you're gonna try to prosecute,\n\n38\n00:01:53.735 --> 00:01:57.117\nyou're gonna ruin evidence,\nevidence is no longer valid or\n\n39\n00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.522\nacceptable because of the way\nyou went about collecting it.\n\n40\n00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:03.068\nThere's just a number of things\nthat can go wrong, right?\n\n41\n00:02:03.068 --> 00:02:08.364\nAnd we always talk about proper planning,\nand just about everything we do, and this\n\n42\n00:02:08.364 --> 00:02:13.598\nis no exception, so making sure that we\nhave that incident response plan in place.\n\n43\n00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:17.443\nAnd if you need to create one,\nthen you go out to some organization,\n\n44\n00:02:17.443 --> 00:02:20.621\nlike SANS Institute, and\nyou get yourself a template.\n\n45\n00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:25.027\nOr you talk to other organizations\nthat are in the same field as you, and\n\n46\n00:02:25.027 --> 00:02:30.179\nyou see what they have in place, and maybe\nyou borrow some stuff from that, right?\n\n47\n00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:32.686\nWe were talking about collaborating and\nworking together.\n\n48\n00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:36.781\nWe're not asking them to give up\ncorporate secrets, or anything like that,\n\n49\n00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.059\nbut let's share our security knowledge.\n\n50\n00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:43.600\nAnd let's make sure that we can help\neach other protect ourselves, and\n\n51\n00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.217\ntherefore protect your competitors,\nif you will, from breaches, and\n\n52\n00:02:48.217 --> 00:02:50.347\nfrom cyber incidents like this.\n\n53\n00:02:50.347 --> 00:02:54.742\nWe all work together, so planning and\npreparation, however you go about,\n\n54\n00:02:54.742 --> 00:02:59.415\nwhether you're creating your template\nfrom scratch, whether you're getting\n\n55\n00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:03.899\nit from somebody and modifying it to\nsuit your needs, but having that is key.\n\n56\n00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:08.137\nSome of the things that they specifically\ncall out in the exam objectives,\n\n57\n00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:09.559\nup to date contact list.\n\n58\n00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.334\nThis is one that you definitely\nhave to stay on top of,\n\n59\n00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:15.612\nbecause, as we all know,\nthings change in the organization.\n\n60\n00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:20.284\nPeople move from one job role to another,\npeople leave the organization,\n\n61\n00:03:20.284 --> 00:03:21.999\nnew people are brought in.\n\n62\n00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.082\nSo when we made that initial plan,\nand we set up that call list,\n\n63\n00:03:25.082 --> 00:03:29.093\nhad everybody's name and number and blah,\nblah, blah, and now all of a sudden,\n\n64\n00:03:29.093 --> 00:03:30.807\nthose people are no longer there.\n\n65\n00:03:30.807 --> 00:03:34.190\nYou break out that list, you start\ncalling, and you get the doo doo doo, or\n\n66\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.465\nhey, yeah, this is Bob, no,\nI don't even work with you guys anymore,\n\n67\n00:03:37.465 --> 00:03:38.794\nwhat are you calling me for?\n\n68\n00:03:38.794 --> 00:03:42.130\n[LAUGH] Something like that, that's\nnot what you wanna have happen, right?\n\n69\n00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.465\nSo keeping that contact list up to date,\nmaking sure we know who we're suppose to\n\n70\n00:03:46.465 --> 00:03:49.098\ncontact, and\nthat the number is still working.\n\n71\n00:03:49.098 --> 00:03:54.641\nPeople change their phone numbers, you\nwanna know internally, who am I supposed\n\n72\n00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:59.801\nto contact, and in what order,\nwhat priority, and at what level, right?\n\n73\n00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:03.000\nThere are certain things\nthat are gonna happen, and\n\n74\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.322\nwe don't immediately notify the C level\nemployees, right, or the C level officers.\n\n75\n00:04:08.322 --> 00:04:13.094\nWe notify our direct supervisor, and then\nthey make the decision of when it's time\n\n76\n00:04:13.094 --> 00:04:16.854\nto notify whomever's next in that\nchain of command, all right?\n\n77\n00:04:16.854 --> 00:04:19.195\nAs well as external\nindividuals to contact, and\n\n78\n00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:21.708\nwe always wanna work closely\nwith law enforcement,\n\n79\n00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:25.475\nthey have tools at their disposal that\nthey can bring into play, they probably\n\n80\n00:04:25.475 --> 00:04:28.761\nhave skilled employees working for\nthem that do this kind of thing.\n\n81\n00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:32.737\nAnd it's gonna help me in the event\nthat we need to prosecute,\n\n82\n00:04:32.737 --> 00:04:35.195\nbecause they will be working with me.\n\n83\n00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:39.570\nAnd they will make sure that we don't get\nany evidence that's gonna be compromised,\n\n84\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.821\nor that we can't use in the court of law,\nor making sure we don't forget anything,\n\n85\n00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:44.876\nthat kind of thing.\n\n86\n00:04:44.876 --> 00:04:49.821\nWorking with their experts, whether\nthat's local law enforcement, or state,\n\n87\n00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:54.192\nor federal, or whatever your, or\ncountry has, as far as that goes, but\n\n88\n00:04:54.192 --> 00:04:57.510\nknowing who that is ahead of\ntime is gonna be the thing.\n\n89\n00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.708\nYou don't wanna be thumbing\nthrough the phone book, or\n\n90\n00:05:00.708 --> 00:05:03.498\ndoing Google searches as\nyour data is flowing out\n\n91\n00:05:03.498 --> 00:05:07.800\nof your network trying to figure out\nwho I'm supposed to call, all right?\n\n92\n00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.025\nUp to date toolkits are important.\n\n93\n00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:11.160\nWe wanna make sure.\n\n94\n00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.057\nWe've talked about dozens and\ndozens of tools.\n\n95\n00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:18.336\nAnd there's more than we've talked\nabout out there that are available,\n\n96\n00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:22.697\ncommercial, open source, free,\nthat we wanna make part of our toolkit.\n\n97\n00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:25.133\nWe need to know,\nwe need to have tools available so\n\n98\n00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:27.279\nthat we can perform our incident response.\n\n99\n00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:31.729\nBut we need to make sure those are kept up\nto date, what worked a few years ago might\n\n100\n00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.734\nnot work now, or even six months ago\nwhen it comes to computers, right?\n\n101\n00:05:35.734 --> 00:05:38.082\n&gt;&gt; My 98 boot disk isn't still relevant,\nMike?\n\n102\n00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:39.777\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It might be, but\n\n103\n00:05:39.777 --> 00:05:43.733\nyou're not gonna run into too many\n98 boxes out there, hopefully.\n\n104\n00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:46.488\n&gt;&gt; I think it's probably not so\nmuch looking backward,\n\n105\n00:05:46.488 --> 00:05:50.774\nbeing able to support legacy stuff, it's,\ndo I have something that supports this\n\n106\n00:05:50.774 --> 00:05:53.181\nbrand new bleeding edge\npiece of technology?\n\n107\n00:05:53.181 --> 00:05:56.618\nDo I have something that will work\nwith UEFI, things of that nature?\n\n108\n00:05:56.618 --> 00:05:59.465\nIf I'm working on just old\nBIOS type in my toolkit,\n\n109\n00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:03.659\nI don't have anything that supports UEFI,\nI need to update that toolkit.\n\n110\n00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.043\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right?\n\n111\n00:06:05.043 --> 00:06:09.144\nNew file systems come out, you've got\nMicrosoft coming out with their resilient\n\n112\n00:06:09.144 --> 00:06:13.365\nfile system, you've got, as Daniel says,\nnew operating systems coming out, and\n\n113\n00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:16.527\nwhat ran on Windows 8.1,\nwe've all dealt with it, right?\n\n114\n00:06:16.527 --> 00:06:19.870\nWhat ran on 7, did it run on 8.1,\ndid it run on 10?\n\n115\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.274\nIf it ran on XP,\nit might not run on any of that, and so,\n\n116\n00:06:23.274 --> 00:06:27.567\nwhen these new operating systems come out,\nam I gonna be able to, and\n\n117\n00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:31.062\nmaybe not being used as my\ninvestigative tool, right?\n\n118\n00:06:31.062 --> 00:06:34.800\nBecause I've got my VM, I can choose\nnot to upgrade that, I suppose.\n\n119\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.256\nBut if I'm gonna be investigating machines\nthat are running these newer operating\n\n120\n00:06:38.256 --> 00:06:40.935\nsystems, can I contact them,\ncan I work with them the same way?\n\n121\n00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:43.210\nAgain, like file systems,\nthings like that.\n\n122\n00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.791\nSo keeping those toolkits up to date,\n\n123\n00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:51.208\nespecially tools like intrusion detection,\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n124\n00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:54.760\nWe've talked about antivirus software,\nthings like that, anything that's\n\n125\n00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.856\nsignature-based, definition-based, has to\nbe maintained, has to be kept up to date.\n\n126\n00:06:58.856 --> 00:07:02.500\nWhen we're doing penetration tests,\nor vulnerability scanners,\n\n127\n00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.650\nthose have to be kept up to date, right?\n\n128\n00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.098\nWe have to make sure we have\nthe latest and greatest definitions,\n\n129\n00:07:08.098 --> 00:07:11.996\nwhen we're looking for exploits,\nthat has to be kept up to date, right?\n\n130\n00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:14.810\nIf we're not paying attention,\nI mean, new exploits, or\n\n131\n00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.066\nnew vulnerabilities\nare developed every day,\n\n132\n00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:20.186\nor discovered every day,\nnew exploits are developed every day.\n\n133\n00:07:20.186 --> 00:07:24.898\nWe're gonna have to stay on top of that,\nbut, so keeping the toolkits up to date.\n\n134\n00:07:24.898 --> 00:07:29.119\nThey mention a few things in here, they're\ntalking about some of the tools, not so\n\n135\n00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:32.314\nmuch tools you need, but\nkind of categories of tools you need,\n\n136\n00:07:32.314 --> 00:07:34.937\nthey talk about creating disk images,\nall right?\n\n137\n00:07:34.937 --> 00:07:39.121\nIf we're gonna be doing an investigation,\nor analysis, for\n\n138\n00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:42.907\nincident response,\nwe need to be able to image drives.\n\n139\n00:07:42.907 --> 00:07:47.436\nWhether those are removable media\ntype drives, internal drives,\n\n140\n00:07:47.436 --> 00:07:49.744\nUSB drives, anything like that.\n\n141\n00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:53.269\nWe've gotta create those images, so\nthat we can work with those, and\n\n142\n00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:56.282\nnot destroy the original, or\nmodify the original anyway.\n\n143\n00:07:56.282 --> 00:08:00.008\nWe need tools that'll allow us\nto investigate network access,\n\n144\n00:08:00.008 --> 00:08:03.734\nwhat this machine is allowed to\nreach out and see on the network,\n\n145\n00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:08.257\nwhat shares are available\n&gt;&gt; Use a right assignment-type tools like\n\n146\n00:08:08.257 --> 00:08:14.190\nbeing able to work with our active\ndirectory, for example, and permissions.\n\n147\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.110\nDeleted data recovery, I don't know if\nwe've actually talked about any of that,\n\n148\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.687\nbut it's a big,\nbig part of doing any investigation,\n\n149\n00:08:20.687 --> 00:08:23.599\nbecause the bad people,\nthe bad actors, the threat actors,\n\n150\n00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:27.200\nwhatever you want to call them are gonna\nbe trying to cover their tracks.\n\n151\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.786\nThey're going to be trying\nto delete files, but\n\n152\n00:08:30.786 --> 00:08:36.209\nwe should know that when we delete a file\nit's not like we actually go in and\n\n153\n00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:38.925\nremove the file from the hard drive.\n\n154\n00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:43.897\nYou remove the metadata from the file, the\npointers to where that file is located on\n\n155\n00:08:43.897 --> 00:08:48.300\nthe hard drive and then though,\nthose sectors get marked as available and\n\n156\n00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.495\nthe next time you write those\nsectors could be might or\n\n157\n00:08:51.495 --> 00:08:54.789\nmight be not overwritten next\ntime you save a new file.\n\n158\n00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:58.450\nJust depends on where the operating system\ndecides to put it on the drive based on\n\n159\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.720\nits algorithms.\n\n160\n00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.905\nSo deleting a file doesn't\nremove it from the hard drive\n\n161\n00:09:03.905 --> 00:09:08.535\nnecessarily which means I can\ngo back in and recover that, and\n\n162\n00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:12.380\nthat's what we call data carving or\nfile carving.\n\n163\n00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.835\nThese are just using specialized\nsoftware that can go in and\n\n164\n00:09:15.835 --> 00:09:20.395\nanalyze the drive bit by bit not using\nthe drive's metadata to find files, but\n\n165\n00:09:20.395 --> 00:09:23.572\nlooking at the bits\nthemselves on those drives.\n\n166\n00:09:23.572 --> 00:09:26.205\nAnd saying, look,\nhere's a fragment of a file.\n\n167\n00:09:26.205 --> 00:09:27.946\nHere's another fragment of a file,\n\n168\n00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:30.922\nmaybe we can try to put\nthese files back together.\n\n169\n00:09:30.922 --> 00:09:36.090\nI mean, I've had to dig these out just to\ntry to recover from a hard drive failure.\n\n170\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.245\nYou've got the home computer that you\nnever backup and it has all those pictures\n\n171\n00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.991\non there and you're like gosh,\nnow I gotta try to recover this.\n\n172\n00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:45.450\nAnd using the right software, I was able\nto recover every single one of them.\n\n173\n00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.290\nI mean, it's impressive stuff,\nbut it just shows you that\n\n174\n00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:53.480\nthe data doesn't go away when you delete\nit, it just gets marked as free space.\n\n175\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.325\nIt doesn't erase the ones and zeros,\nunless you do a DOD wipe type thing or\n\n176\n00:09:57.325 --> 00:09:58.515\nsomething like that.\n\n177\n00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:04.649\nSo, deleted data recovery using\ntools like testdisk or foremost.\n\n178\n00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:07.344\nI wanna say, both of those are open\nsourced and freely available.\n\n179\n00:10:07.344 --> 00:10:11.079\nThere are several tools out there that\nyou can get to do that kind of thing.\n\n180\n00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:12.014\nNetwork sniffing tools.\n\n181\n00:10:12.014 --> 00:10:16.229\nWe gotta make sure we have those,\nthat we have our wire shark,\n\n182\n00:10:16.229 --> 00:10:20.785\nRTCP dump or whatever we choose to\ncapture traffic of the network.\n\n183\n00:10:20.785 --> 00:10:25.400\nPassword tracking tools, Off-track,\nCain &amp; Abel, John the Ripper, Off-track.\n\n184\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.860\nAll these different tools\nthat are available.\n\n185\n00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.040\nPort enumeration.\n\n186\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.466\nDaniel, what can I use to look for ports?\n\n187\n00:10:31.466 --> 00:10:32.770\n&gt;&gt; Man, that's a tough one.\n\n188\n00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.924\nYou could probably, you can use Telnet.\n\n189\n00:10:34.924 --> 00:10:38.055\nYou can Telnet in to 65,535 ports or\n\n190\n00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:42.088\nyou'll probably use the easier way,\nwhich is Nmap.\n\n191\n00:10:42.088 --> 00:10:43.448\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll look at Nmap.\n\n192\n00:10:43.448 --> 00:10:47.067\nAnd of course,\nNmap is not the only one out there, but\n\n193\n00:10:47.067 --> 00:10:51.024\nit is the de facto standard\nwhen it comes to port scanning.\n\n194\n00:10:51.024 --> 00:10:53.800\nBut whatever it is, making sure that\nyou've got those tools available.\n\n195\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.136\nSo basically, thinking about where\nyour investigation might lead or\n\n196\n00:10:58.136 --> 00:11:01.452\nwhat types of investigations\nyou might end up doing.\n\n197\n00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:04.350\nWhat tools you're gonna\nneed at your disposal,\n\n198\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.760\ngathering those tools up ahead of time.\n\n199\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.140\nHaving them in your tool kit,\nunderstanding how they work.\n\n200\n00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.020\nIf they're paid,\nmaking sure they're licensed.\n\n201\n00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.823\nTrying to use trial versions of software.\n\n202\n00:11:15.823 --> 00:11:19.702\nIt might be okay to learn with and\nto play around with.\n\n203\n00:11:19.702 --> 00:11:22.876\nBut when it comes to actually\ndoing an investigation,\n\n204\n00:11:22.876 --> 00:11:25.017\nyou can't be using trial software.\n\n205\n00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:30.584\nNow a lot of the trial software's\nlimited like a scanner, for example,\n\n206\n00:11:30.584 --> 00:11:36.807\nmight limit to you to scanning only so\nmany hosts at a time, because it's trial.\n\n207\n00:11:36.807 --> 00:11:42.631\nAnd the court systems are most likely not\ngoing to let's say, it's not the court.\n\n208\n00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:45.112\nThe defense is gonna be\nable to pull up some doubt,\n\n209\n00:11:45.112 --> 00:11:48.310\nif you're using trial software and\nthat's all they need.\n\n210\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:53.443\nA little reasonable doubt goes a long way\nin getting evidence thrown out of court.\n\n211\n00:11:53.443 --> 00:11:57.856\nSo, over here some trial software when it\ncomes doing your actual investigation.\n\n212\n00:11:57.856 --> 00:12:00.930\nUnless, I don't know if your\nplanning on keeping it in house.\n\n213\n00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.229\nYour going to prosecute, I guess.\n\n214\n00:12:02.229 --> 00:12:03.612\nThere's no harm.\n\n215\n00:12:03.612 --> 00:12:07.117\nNot a good idea alright.\n\n216\n00:12:07.117 --> 00:12:09.065\nSo, keep those toolkits up to date.\n\n217\n00:12:09.065 --> 00:12:12.197\nThe other thing that they call\nout here ongoing training.\n\n218\n00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:17.380\nThis is something that we have to do\nas security professionals, especially.\n\n219\n00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:22.151\nI mean, anything in the computer industry,\nyou have to continuously train,\n\n220\n00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:25.489\nbecause it doesn't stay the same for\nvery long at all.\n\n221\n00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:26.097\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n222\n00:12:26.097 --> 00:12:29.974\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My laptop, I think I\ngot it a few months ago, it's old.\n\n223\n00:12:29.974 --> 00:12:31.715\nI wanna get rid of it now,\nit's an old piece of hardware.\n\n224\n00:12:31.715 --> 00:12:34.190\nYeah, who wants this crack stuff?\n\n225\n00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.700\nSo, making sure that we\nstay on top of things.\n\n226\n00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:43.185\nLike I said, as far as knowledge goes,\ngetting into the different sites like\n\n227\n00:12:43.185 --> 00:12:47.739\nBugTracks and all these places that have\nthese RSS feeds that you can subscribe\n\n228\n00:12:47.739 --> 00:12:51.949\nto stay on top of the latest\nvulnerabilities that are being discovered,\n\n229\n00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:54.730\nthe latest attacks that have happened.\n\n230\n00:12:54.730 --> 00:13:00.033\nBecause one, they're interesting to\nread about, but I can learn from those\n\n231\n00:13:00.033 --> 00:13:06.087\nattacks methods that were used,\nweaknesses, remember, hindsight's 20/20.\n\n232\n00:13:06.087 --> 00:13:09.850\nSo by looking at things like,\nlet's use target, for example.\n\n233\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.540\nBy looking at that and\nreading the case studies on that,\n\n234\n00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.950\nwe're now that it's happened and\nthe information is coming out.\n\n235\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.537\nWe can look at how the attack happened.\n\n236\n00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:25.408\nWhat they could have done to prevent\nthat and implement that ourselves, so\n\n237\n00:13:25.408 --> 00:13:28.112\nthat we don't have to\nbe the Home Depot and\n\n238\n00:13:28.112 --> 00:13:33.180\nfall victim to the same type of attack\na few months later should've learned.\n\n239\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.983\nShould've paid attention\nto what was going on and\n\n240\n00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:38.659\nI'm not saying anything\nbad about Home Depot.\n\n241\n00:13:38.659 --> 00:13:40.590\nI'm just saying it as an example.\n\n242\n00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.366\n&gt;&gt; They legitimately got jacked up.\n\n243\n00:13:42.366 --> 00:13:43.439\n&gt;&gt; They did.\n&gt;&gt; It happened.\n\n244\n00:13:43.439 --> 00:13:47.360\n&gt;&gt; And if I'm not mistaken, it was a very\nsimilar attack to what happened with\n\n245\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.845\nTarget and I'm not saying that they could\nhave prevented and I'm not saying anything\n\n246\n00:13:51.845 --> 00:13:56.300\nbad about their security team, but\nwe do have to even use that as an example.\n\n247\n00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.107\nHow can two organizations fall\nvictim to that same type of attack.\n\n248\n00:14:00.107 --> 00:14:00.770\nWe should learn.\n\n249\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.197\nWe should share information.\n\n250\n00:14:02.197 --> 00:14:04.423\n&gt;&gt; It's easy for\nus to play armchair quarterback and\n\n251\n00:14:04.423 --> 00:14:05.960\ngo target security was horrible.\n\n252\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.226\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n253\n00:14:07.226 --> 00:14:09.029\nwas just something that\nthey didnt' account.\n\n254\n00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:13.580\nThey didn't think about it and that's why\nwe get to go, man, that sucks for Target.\n\n255\n00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.554\nWe need to learn from that.\n\n256\n00:14:15.554 --> 00:14:17.600\nWe need to go, well, how did that happen?\n\n257\n00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.013\nWhat was it that you overlooked?\n\n258\n00:14:19.013 --> 00:14:21.040\nThat's an avenue I never\nthought about myself.\n\n259\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.115\nMaybe I need to be\nchecking those things out.\n\n260\n00:14:23.115 --> 00:14:26.630\nYou have to constantly be looking\nover your attack servers.\n\n261\n00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.344\nCome at it from an attacker's point of\nview and go, hey, that looks interesting.\n\n262\n00:14:30.344 --> 00:14:34.880\nMaybe I can get somewhere here, doesn't\nseem to be any security controls on it.\n\n263\n00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.029\nThat's what you gotta do.\n\n264\n00:14:36.029 --> 00:14:38.439\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nyou start thinking about wait a second.\n\n265\n00:14:38.439 --> 00:14:41.646\nWe've got a third party HVAC\ncompany that comes in here and\n\n266\n00:14:41.646 --> 00:14:45.090\nI know they've got a laptop\nsitting in that HVAC closet.\n\n267\n00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.595\nI walk by,\nsometimes the door's open, I see it.\n\n268\n00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:50.458\nThere's a little authentication\ndialog box on it.\n\n269\n00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:51.480\nHow strong is that?\n\n270\n00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.874\nHow strong of a password are they using?\n\n271\n00:14:52.874 --> 00:14:54.390\nAre they using a password?\n\n272\n00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.649\nAnd if I was able to get in that system,\nwhat does it have access to?\n\n273\n00:14:57.649 --> 00:14:58.917\nWhat can they see?\n\n274\n00:14:58.917 --> 00:15:00.635\n&gt;&gt; Maybe they thought,\nbecause it was behind a close door.\n\n275\n00:15:00.635 --> 00:15:02.340\nThey just take the little password and\n\n276\n00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.958\nput it on a sticky note right\nthere on the computer screen.\n\n277\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.241\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly and\nthey're doing it, because, well,\n\n278\n00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:10.142\nI'm not the same Joe that's gonna come\nout every time to work on this, so\n\n279\n00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:12.600\nthe next guy that comes out\nis gonna need this password.\n\n280\n00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:17.912\nAnd so stuff like that happens and we've\ngot to learn from other people's mistakes,\n\n281\n00:15:17.912 --> 00:15:20.287\nand try to implement that in-house.\n\n282\n00:15:20.287 --> 00:15:23.521\nSo ongoing training, that's for\nyour incident responders.\n\n283\n00:15:23.521 --> 00:15:25.358\nWhat we're training to do.\n\n284\n00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:27.900\nWe need to constantly be learning.\n\n285\n00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.987\nNew technologies come out,\nnew mobile devices.\n\n286\n00:15:30.987 --> 00:15:35.050\nLike I said, new operating systems,\nnew applications, new attack vectors.\n\n287\n00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.739\nAll of this, we have to stay on top of it.\n\n288\n00:15:36.739 --> 00:15:40.711\nSo that when we know or that when we\ngo in and do an investigation, and\n\n289\n00:15:40.711 --> 00:15:43.311\nwe can do a thorough proper investigation.\n\n290\n00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:48.455\nYour incident response team itself,\nthey have to go thorough training.\n\n291\n00:15:48.455 --> 00:15:50.202\nThey have to run through exercises.\n\n292\n00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:54.329\nWe'll talk in a little bit about\nsomething called tabletop exercises,\n\n293\n00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:58.061\nwhich is a very important part of\nthat ongoing training process.\n\n294\n00:15:58.061 --> 00:16:02.256\nWhen it comes to the They change\nthe acronyms all the time here.\n\n295\n00:16:02.256 --> 00:16:06.381\nYour CIRT, your Computer Incident\nResponse Team or your CSIRT,\n\n296\n00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:10.200\nyour Computer Security\nIncident Response Team.\n\n297\n00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.759\nYou might have one of those in-house,\nor you might be an organization, and\n\n298\n00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:14.771\nthat's what you do.\n\n299\n00:16:14.771 --> 00:16:16.377\nAnd you provide that service for\n\n300\n00:16:16.377 --> 00:16:20.350\nsmaller organizations that can't\nafford their own response team.\n\n301\n00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.356\nBut within an organization,\nyou know, you might have one team.\n\n302\n00:16:23.356 --> 00:16:26.380\nBut a central team that does everything,\nright?\n\n303\n00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.740\nThey are the team, they work for\nthe entire organizations.\n\n304\n00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.181\nUsually smaller organizations or\n\n305\n00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:37.831\norganizations that have one physical\nlocation, we see the central cert team.\n\n306\n00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:43.980\nOr we might have distributive teams, if\nyour organization has multiple locations.\n\n307\n00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.050\nEspecially if they're widely\ndispersed geographically.\n\n308\n00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.620\nIt's not feasible for my team here\nto be able to get to another office\n\n309\n00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.060\nin a timely manner to do an investigation.\n\n310\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:01.030\nSo maybe we have multiple distributed\nteams located throughout our locations,\n\n311\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.220\nlarge organizations,\norganizations with different locations.\n\n312\n00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.065\nIn that case though one of the keys there\nis going to be collaboration, all right?\n\n313\n00:17:09.065 --> 00:17:11.855\nMaking sure that all of our\nteams have the same information,\n\n314\n00:17:11.855 --> 00:17:16.775\nthe same level of training, work together,\nprovide support for the other teams.\n\n315\n00:17:16.775 --> 00:17:22.865\nAnd then even large organizations might\nhave what we call a coordinating team.\n\n316\n00:17:22.865 --> 00:17:28.875\nAlmost like a corporate team that\noversees all of the other teams.\n\n317\n00:17:28.875 --> 00:17:32.860\nMight not do any of the hands on response,\nbut\n\n318\n00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:39.220\nthey oversee all their incident response\nteams, helps coordinate activities.\n\n319\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.371\nWhen we look at organizations that are\nspread out across geographical locations,\n\n320\n00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:44.508\nmultiple locations.\n\n321\n00:17:44.508 --> 00:17:50.030\nAn attack doesn't necessarily stay within\nyour geographical boundary, right?\n\n322\n00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:53.010\nBecause let's say I compromise\none of your locations,\n\n323\n00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.060\nthere's a good chance you've\ngot VPN tunnels set up.\n\n324\n00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.770\nServers in your one office have to be able\nto access servers in another office for\n\n325\n00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.390\nreplication purposes.\n\n326\n00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.150\nResources are distributed, so\n\n327\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:08.210\nyou've got users in other locations,\naccessing resources in this location.\n\n328\n00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:09.860\nThat means there's communication channels,\n\n329\n00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.710\nthat means there is a path\nbetween those locations.\n\n330\n00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.430\nWhich means anything that affects\none locations could spread\n\n331\n00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.393\nto the other location.\n\n332\n00:18:19.393 --> 00:18:25.220\nSo again,\nhaving coordination between the teams.\n\n333\n00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.250\nMaking sure that hey,\nwe're under attack here,\n\n334\n00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:32.640\nlet's shut off those other branches\nto make sure that it doesn't spread.\n\n335\n00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.720\nOr at least really, really monitor any\ntraffic going to those other locations,\n\n336\n00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.030\nmaking sure that nothing\nspreads across there.\n\n337\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:39.910\nTrying to contain,\n\n338\n00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:44.370\nthat's a big part of the incidence\nresponse is the containment aspect.\n\n339\n00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.880\nTrying to limit where that infection or\nthat incident is occurring.\n\n340\n00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.870\nManagement is another\npart of ongoing training.\n\n341\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:56.090\nAnd they kind of put this under training,\nbut really, I think what they're trying to\n\n342\n00:18:56.090 --> 00:19:00.500\nsay here is more about,\nwe have to have management buy-in.\n\n343\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.711\nWe have to have support from\nthe upper level management to\n\n344\n00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:09.544\ngive us the authority even,\nto do our incident response, okay?\n\n345\n00:19:09.544 --> 00:19:13.513\nWe're going to be investigating machines,\nwe're going to be going in and\n\n346\n00:19:13.513 --> 00:19:16.990\nseeing employee's,\npossibly personal information.\n\n347\n00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.559\nOr dealing with customer's information\nthat's been stored in these servers,\n\n348\n00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:22.298\nhealthcare information, all right?\n\n349\n00:19:22.298 --> 00:19:26.703\nSo we need upper level management buy-in\nto give us that authority to do these\n\n350\n00:19:26.703 --> 00:19:30.240\ninvestigations and\nto make the big decisions, right?\n\n351\n00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:36.250\nWe might be the big bad CSIRT team and\nwe're really good at what we do.\n\n352\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.370\nBut we're not the ones that can make\ndecisions that impact the business as\n\n353\n00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:40.570\na whole, typically.\n\n354\n00:19:41.762 --> 00:19:45.880\nWhere we'll be overstepping our bounds if\nwe started doing this, we need management.\n\n355\n00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.340\nManagement, there should be at least\none upper level management person\n\n356\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.520\nas part of your incident response team,\nall right?\n\n357\n00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.350\nSo that can be the liaison\nbetween the rest of management.\n\n358\n00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.800\nHelp us make those decisions,\n\n359\n00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.810\nespecially when we need to\nmake them quickly, all right?\n\n360\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:06.730\nI mentioned the term tabletop exercises or\ntheoretical exercises,\n\n361\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.120\nthis is when you get around and\nyou play war games.\n\n362\n00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:14.260\nYou get everybody together in a conference\nroom and you have a mock attack and\n\n363\n00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.290\nyou break out your incident response plan.\n\n364\n00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.930\nEverybody knows their roles, it looks\nlike actors sitting around reading their\n\n365\n00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.510\nscripts before they go in and shoot.\n\n366\n00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.870\nWe wanna make sure everybody knows\nwhat they're supposed to do,\n\n367\n00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.480\nwhen they're supposed to do it.\n\n368\n00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.890\nWait, Daniel has done his part,\nokay, that's my turn to step in, and\n\n369\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.140\nnow what I'm gonna do is this,\nand this, and this.\n\n370\n00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.450\nThis does many things for us.\n\n371\n00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:40.020\nThese types of exercises are very,\nvery valuable in many respects.\n\n372\n00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.550\nBecause they help us do\nthat ongoing training.\n\n373\n00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.280\nThey keep me aware or\n\n374\n00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.490\nkeep it fresh in my mind that these\nare my steps, this is my responsibility.\n\n375\n00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:54.725\nOr what we're supposed to during\nan incident, this is how we handle it.\n\n376\n00:20:54.725 --> 00:20:58.440\n&gt;&gt; It's like a band practicing\nmusic they're gonna play, right?\n\n377\n00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.840\nThey do that because, Tommy's gonna\nplay the high hat really heavy here.\n\n378\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.170\nAnd I wasn't expecting that,\nso it threw me off.\n\n379\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.476\nBut if you go through it and\nyou practice the song over and over again,\n\n380\n00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:11.277\nI know exactly what each one of\nmy band mates is going to do.\n\n381\n00:21:11.277 --> 00:21:15.130\nAnd therefore I'm prepared for it,\nit doesn't catch me off guard and\n\n382\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.970\neverybody's doing their part.\n\n383\n00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.450\nIf someone doesn't play their part,\nit throws everybody else off.\n\n384\n00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.355\nThey're whoa,\nyou're supposed to do such and such.\n\n385\n00:21:21.355 --> 00:21:24.680\nAnd not only do I know my part, but\nI start to learn their parts as well, and\n\n386\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.000\nnow there's that cross\npollination of duty.\n\n387\n00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.950\nWhere if Mike's out of the picture,\n\n388\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.790\nI might be actually able to fill in for\nthat position.\n\n389\n00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.359\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n390\n00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:35.302\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and so\nhe brings up some very good points there,\n\n391\n00:21:35.302 --> 00:21:37.970\ncuz we get to see what\neverybody else is doing.\n\n392\n00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.777\nAnd most of us,\nif you've ever done anything, heck,\n\n393\n00:21:40.777 --> 00:21:45.430\nlike what we're doing here, or\nplaying in a band, or anything like that.\n\n394\n00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:49.260\nIf Daniel and I are sitting around,\ndiscussing what we're going to do, and\n\n395\n00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.020\nI'm going through a lab and something\ndoesn't work, I'm like, didn't work.\n\n396\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.630\nAll right,\nlet's see what I can do to fix this.\n\n397\n00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.950\nIf the camera's rolling, and\nthat red tally light is on, and\n\n398\n00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.670\nmy lab doesn't work, sweat starts\ndripping down the side of my head.\n\n399\n00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.117\n&gt;&gt; It's real hot in here Mike [LAUGH].\n\n400\n00:22:03.117 --> 00:22:04.966\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think you need to turn the air\n\n401\n00:22:04.966 --> 00:22:06.022\nup a little [LAUGH].\n\n402\n00:22:06.022 --> 00:22:09.142\n&gt;&gt; I know you've played on stage before\nand you hit a couple wrong notes and\n\n403\n00:22:09.142 --> 00:22:11.625\nnow, all of a sudden,\nthat's all you can think about.\n\n404\n00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:12.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so you can't think about\n\n405\n00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.060\nthe next note you're playing and\nit gets worse and worse.\n\n406\n00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.610\nAnd it's like this horrible,\nhorrible snowball effect that occurs, and\n\n407\n00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.350\nyou just run off stage crying.\n\n408\n00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.115\n&gt;&gt; That's no [FOREIGN] [LAUGH].\n\n409\n00:22:21.115 --> 00:22:23.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's no [FOREIGN] at all.\n\n410\n00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.920\nSo that's what this kind of thing can help\nwith, it can get us over those nerves.\n\n411\n00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.030\nBecause during the incident, when the\nuntrained people that are running around\n\n412\n00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:36.740\nare doing the Chicken Little,\nthe sky is falling.\n\n413\n00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.110\nWe're calm, we're cool, we're collected,\nwe're not making bad decisions,\n\n414\n00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.500\nwe're getting what we need.\n\n415\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.880\nWe're helping other people stay calm and\ncool, and collected, and\n\n416\n00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.660\nthat kind of thing.\n\n417\n00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:50.862\nSo it's very important to run through\nthese a few times to give us that sense\n\n418\n00:22:50.862 --> 00:22:56.409\nof preparation, that sense of preparedness\nI guess is the better way to say it.\n\n419\n00:22:56.409 --> 00:22:59.298\nNot only that,\ndoes it help with the employees,\n\n420\n00:22:59.298 --> 00:23:03.050\nthe incident response team itself,\nit helps us suss our plan.\n\n421\n00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:07.550\nWe might find big gaps in our plan,\nlike we forgot to account for\n\n422\n00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:08.700\nthis all together.\n\n423\n00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.340\nCuz we sat and wrote this plan,\nthere wasn't an incident going on,\n\n424\n00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.450\nwe're following best practices,\nwe got our template, whatever it is.\n\n425\n00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.610\nAnd we just forgot a page or we missed a\nparagraph or we left something out that's\n\n426\n00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.720\nunique to our organization that\nneeded to be put in there.\n\n427\n00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.300\nI don't want to find out about\nthat during an incident response.\n\n428\n00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.929\nBut if I do a table top exercise, that's\na great time for those things to crop up.\n\n429\n00:23:29.929 --> 00:23:33.532\nCuz we can all say okay, time out, let's\ndo, no Titus, don't time out [LAUGH].\n\n430\n00:23:33.532 --> 00:23:35.471\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's our code for\n\n431\n00:23:35.471 --> 00:23:37.118\nactually stopping recording.\n\n432\n00:23:37.118 --> 00:23:39.881\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But as a team, we can say all right,\n\n433\n00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:42.450\nlook, look, we completely missed this.\n\n434\n00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:43.357\nLet's stop and\n\n435\n00:23:43.357 --> 00:23:47.271\nfigure out how we can update our\nplan to include this information.\n\n436\n00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:49.278\nAlso determining inner operability.\n\n437\n00:23:49.278 --> 00:23:53.655\nAnd when we do these incident responses,\nit's not just our team we're dealing with.\n\n438\n00:23:53.655 --> 00:23:54.750\nOur organization.\n\n439\n00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.753\nAnd most likely we're gonna\ncrossing organizational boundaries\n\n440\n00:23:57.753 --> 00:23:59.120\nbetween departments.\n\n441\n00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.340\nWe need to deal with the development guys\nto talk about the application that's being\n\n442\n00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.320\ncompromised.\n\n443\n00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.690\nWe need to deal with our database people\nbecause we need to make sure that he or\n\n444\n00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.420\nshe can give us the information we need or\n\n445\n00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:15.460\ncan shut things off to limit\nthe scope of the attack.\n\n446\n00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.870\nSo we're gonna be dealing with other\ndepartments during this and this is a good\n\n447\n00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:23.040\nchance to test that interoperability,\nmake sure these other departments aren't\n\n448\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:29.410\ndirectly part of the CIRT team,\nknow what their responsibility is.\n\n449\n00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.710\nOr understand what you're doing when you\ncome down there and ask them for that.\n\n450\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.973\nThey're like, this is not new.\n\n451\n00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:37.330\nI kind of knew you guys\nwould be asking me for this.\n\n452\n00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:37.890\nHere it is.\n\n453\n00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.170\nThat kinda thing.\n\n454\n00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:44.190\nSo lots of good things come out\nof doing tabletop exercises.\n\n455\n00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.630\nVery, very important.\n\n456\n00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.720\nCommunication methods,\nI think we've mentioned this a little bit.\n\n457\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.430\nWhen it comes to communication,\n\n458\n00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.640\nwe've talked about one\nhaving a communication plan.\n\n459\n00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.920\nWho needs to be notified,\nat what time during the incident.\n\n460\n00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.710\nHow it gets escalated, who notifies who.\n\n461\n00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:02.876\nWe need to discuss secure channels.\n\n462\n00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:05.730\nIn the event of compromise,\nhow are we gonna communicate?\n\n463\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.540\nBecause what if the bad guys\nare still in my network?\n\n464\n00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.270\nWhat if they're monitoring things?\n\n465\n00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:13.730\nI might not want to email details of\nwhat we're doing to stop the attack\n\n466\n00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:19.680\nbecause the bad guys can see that and\nnow they can take steps to\n\n467\n00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.490\nhide somewhere else and get out of\nthe way of what we're trying to do.\n\n468\n00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.810\nIt's like the movies,\nthey're always one step ahead of us.\n\n469\n00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.800\nWell, that's because you're\nusing plain text and\n\n470\n00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.070\ncommunicating across the network\nthat has already been compromised.\n\n471\n00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:36.020\nSo having secure channels of\ncommunication to use during an incident.\n\n472\n00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.320\nOut of bands communication\n\n473\n00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:43.080\nusing communication methods that are not\ninvolving your computer network.\n\n474\n00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.350\nGetting on the telephone and\ncalling people.\n\n475\n00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.140\nAssuming that it's not VoIP or-\n&gt;&gt; You learn Morse code and\n\n476\n00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.780\nyou tap it out on a little-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n477\n00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.430\n&gt;&gt; It does make me laugh a bit,\n\n478\n00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:54.530\ncuz sometimes you're like, what do\nyou mean, out of bands communication?\n\n479\n00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.400\nI can either call him, or I can call him.\n\n480\n00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.370\nThe only way to get, I'm not gonna\ndrive across town, hey, you know what,\n\n481\n00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:01.385\nin certain situations-\n&gt;&gt; You use mail.\n\n482\n00:26:01.385 --> 00:26:03.878\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That might be exactly what you have to.\n\n483\n00:26:03.878 --> 00:26:06.900\n[LAUGH] So you'll get it next week,\nhopefully, if the USPS-\n\n484\n00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.204\n&gt;&gt; Don't kill the hostages.\n\n485\n00:26:09.204 --> 00:26:11.512\nThe communication's coming.\n\n486\n00:26:11.512 --> 00:26:13.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The check's in the mail.\n\n487\n00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.044\nI promise, Mr. Ransomer.\n\n488\n00:26:15.044 --> 00:26:16.372\nIt's in the mail.\n\n489\n00:26:16.372 --> 00:26:20.693\nBut having an advance communications\nthat are at our disposal,\n\n490\n00:26:20.693 --> 00:26:22.308\nis gonna be important.\n\n491\n00:26:22.308 --> 00:26:28.320\nAnd then, documentation,\nbecause we have to have things documented.\n\n492\n00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.490\nWe have to understand what\npolicies we have in place,\n\n493\n00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.460\nand our policies are what\nguide our security.\n\n494\n00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.450\nThey are how we enforce our security or\nI shouldn't say how we enforce it.\n\n495\n00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:43.555\nBut how we let our employees\nknow what we expect.\n\n496\n00:26:43.555 --> 00:26:47.253\nAnd when it comes to incident response,\nit's our playbook.\n\n497\n00:26:47.253 --> 00:26:48.370\nThis is what we break out.\n\n498\n00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.710\nThese policies help us go through that.\n\n499\n00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.540\nThe procedures that we\nhave to have in place,\n\n500\n00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.310\nour incident response plan-\n&gt;&gt; I always think of\n\n501\n00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:01.250\nguys in like missile silos that used to\nhave keys that they turned and whatnot,\n\n502\n00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:04.450\nthey had a playbook that they\nfollowed line by line everything\n\n503\n00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:08.750\nhad to be down the money because\nwe're talking nuclear war so\n\n504\n00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.280\nit was very important that they\nfollowed those procedures.\n\n505\n00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.040\nProbably not as devastating if\nyou don't follow per se, but\n\n506\n00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.250\nit could be really\ndevastating to your business.\n\n507\n00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.470\nCould be really devastating to your\norganization, whatever that case is so,\n\n508\n00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:24.610\ncoming up with a really well defined\nstep by step plan, that I can say I\n\n509\n00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.180\nchecked that list off as I go through it,\nand say, I did what I supposed to do.\n\n510\n00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.280\nHere it is right here.\n\n511\n00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.920\nYou're covered, their covered,\neverything's accounted for.\n\n512\n00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.020\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n513\n00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:38.380\nCannot have enough practice and\nplanning, and policies and place.\n\n514\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.490\nEscalation procedure,\n\n515\n00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:43.590\nwe do have to understand that that should\nbe part of our incident response plan.\n\n516\n00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:45.360\nHow we go about escalating it?\n\n517\n00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.860\nIf we suspect that there's\na password attack going on,\n\n518\n00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.900\ndo we call the CEO right then and there?\n\n519\n00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.630\nAnd let he,\nshe know that this is going on?\n\n520\n00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:56.570\nProbably not.\n\n521\n00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:01.280\nIt's probably something that we\nnotify whomever our supervisor is.\n\n522\n00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.094\nIf we're part of the incident response\nteam, we do our job, we go in and\n\n523\n00:28:06.094 --> 00:28:07.150\nwe contain it.\n\n524\n00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:11.852\nNow, if during our analysis we find that\nthey were successful at this password\n\n525\n00:28:11.852 --> 00:28:15.500\nattack, and\nthey were able to gain access to systems.\n\n526\n00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.606\nThat might change who we need to notify.\n\n527\n00:28:17.606 --> 00:28:21.690\nIf the system that they were able gain\naccess to had sensitive information,\n\n528\n00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:26.740\nintellectual property for a organization\nthat if released could cause irreparable\n\n529\n00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:32.350\ndamage or causes monetary issues that\nmight change who we're supposed to notify.\n\n530\n00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:36.050\nBut there's definitely a chain of\ncommand that we need to follow,\n\n531\n00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.160\nthat we should have already drawn out for\nus, and\n\n532\n00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.670\neverybody needs to be trained up on,\nas well.\n\n533\n00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:46.310\nJust having that in a plan somewhere\nin a drawer is not good enough.\n\n534\n00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.800\nEverybody needs to know\nwhat that procedure is.\n\n535\n00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.740\nSo a lot of things to think about\nwhen it comes to best practices for\n\n536\n00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.030\npreparation for incident response.\n\n537\n00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:58.880\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n538\n00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.410\nDefinitely a lot of material.\n\n539\n00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:03.520\nIt seems like a very easy topic to\ngo through, and it is kinda easy,\n\n540\n00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:08.840\nit's just very broad, a lot of stuff\nthat goes into preparing for incidences.\n\n541\n00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.540\nWhat do I do?\n\n542\n00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.090\nWhat's my course of action?\n\n543\n00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.000\nWhat's my guiding star if I don't have?\n\n544\n00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.960\nA laid out plan per say,\nwhat am I gonna do in those situations.\n\n545\n00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.500\nYou gotta have every\ncontingency covered at least as\n\n546\n00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.850\nmuch as you can possibly think of to do.\n\n547\n00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:25.680\nThat's why it helps to\nhave a team of people,\n\n548\n00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.410\ndo table topping like\nMike was talking about.\n\n549\n00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:28.870\nVery, very important things.\n\n550\n00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:32.730\nMike, thanks for explaining this for\nus and going over those\n\n551\n00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:36.440\ndefinite guidelines and ideas we need\nto have implanted in the old noggin.\n\n552\n00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.553\nBut our time has run out for today.\n\n553\n00:29:38.553 --> 00:29:41.392\nGood thing, as he just got to the end\nof his list of things to talk about.\n\n554\n00:29:41.392 --> 00:29:42.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thanks for joining us everyone,\n\n555\n00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.340\nsigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n556\n00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.122\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike

00:00:08.392\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.392 --> 00:00:11.983\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:13.456\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:17.390\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we got a great show for you.\n\n7\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.260\nWe're coming back with logical operations,\ncyber sec first responder.\n\n8\n00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.890\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nis none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.830\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.110\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, thanks for having\nme back, excited to be here as always.\n\n11\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.140\nAnd in this episode,\n\n12\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.410\nwe're going to be taking a look\nat the incident response process.\n\n13\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.630\nThis whole course has really\nbeen CyberSec First Responder.\n\n14\n00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.710\nWe're talking about being that\nfirst responder in an organization.\n\n15\n00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.010\nAnd we wanna talk about the basic\noutline of the process here.\n\n16\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.260\nAnd of course, it's gonna be fine tuned\nto your organization's needs, but\n\n17\n00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.600\nthere is a process.\n\n18\n00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.330\nIf I use that word one more time,\nI think I get the gold star.\n\n19\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.910\nBut process, there it is gold star,\nthat's going to the same.\n\n20\n00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.770\nSo let's talk about the main\nphases of incident response.\n\n21\n00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.230\nAnd the first one we're gonna\nstart with is preparation, right?\n\n22\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.580\nAnd this probably one of the more\nimportant parts as we always talk\n\n23\n00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.290\nabout with any process is, right?\n\n24\n00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.670\nGetting ready, getting prepared,\nis a very important part.\n\n25\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.920\nFailing to plan is planning to fail,\nright?\n\n26\n00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.570\nWell, incident response,\nit's even more so, I think,\n\n27\n00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.940\nbecause when an incident occurs, people\nare not gonna be thinking clearly, right?\n\n28\n00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.360\nPanic ensues, people make snap decisions.\n\n29\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.910\nThey might or\nmight not be the right decisions.\n\n30\n00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.200\nThey get a little anxiety, my gosh,\nthe machine's going crazy.\n\n31\n00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.240\nIt's obviously been taken\nover remote control.\n\n32\n00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.990\nI gotta rip the cable from the wall,\nI gotta throw\n\n33\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.700\nthe computer against the wall and smash\nit a couple times to make sure it's dead.\n\n34\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.000\nObviously, I'm being a little extreme.\n\n35\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.400\nBut those are the kind of things\nthat we don't want to happen.\n\n36\n00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.250\nBecause we lose all evidence\nif we ever wanna prosecute,\n\n37\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.885\nif we wanna try to find out what happened.\n\n38\n00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:56.990\nSo we have to have a plan in\nplace of how this is gonna occur,\n\n39\n00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.980\nbecause that way people know\nwhat their responsibilities are.\n\n40\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.070\nIf they know what they're supposed to do,\nand hopefully they can do that.\n\n41\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.670\nThey don't have to think at this point.\n\n42\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.563\nSo, preparation, which includes\nplanning and also practicing, right?\n\n43\n00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.598\nGoing through table top exercises so\n\n44\n00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:15.720\nthat everybody gets\ncomfortable with their role.\n\n45\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.820\nWe can discover any gaps in our\npolicies that we might've missed and\n\n46\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.900\nwe can fill those in before\nan actual incident occurs.\n\n47\n00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.060\nSo when we talk about\nthe preparation phase,\n\n48\n00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.400\nthat's really what we're talking about.\n\n49\n00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.160\nWe're talking about our polices,\nmaking sure those are in place.\n\n50\n00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.390\nAnd we're talking about\ngetting our team together,\n\n51\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.800\ndeciding who's on\nthe Incident Response Team.\n\n52\n00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.770\nYou've got your call list,\n\n53\n00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.130\nyour procedures that you're gonna\nuse during the incident response.\n\n54\n00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.330\nAll of that is part of preparation,\ngetting everything ready.\n\n55\n00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.410\nAll the stuff we've been\ntalking about in this course.\n\n56\n00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.030\nAnd then practicing it is\njust as important, right?\n\n57\n00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.490\nBecause I can come up with\nthe best steps in the world,\n\n58\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.610\nhang them on a clip board up on the wall\nthere, if we never look at it again and\n\n59\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.790\nan incident occurs, you're still\ngonna have the same level of panic.\n\n60\n00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.270\nWho's got the clipboard?\n\n61\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.430\nI mean, you've got to practice this kind\nof thing, you've got to go over this.\n\n62\n00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.900\nThat's how you work out the kinks.\n\n63\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.310\nThat's how you get people comfortable\nwith what they're supposed to do.\n\n64\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.860\nAnd then when the incident occurs,\n\n65\n00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.460\nyour first responder team is\nthe calm people that come in and\n\n66\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.130\ntake over and calm everybody else down and\ngo through the proper procedure.\n\n67\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.160\nSo preparation, big part of it.\n\n68\n00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.370\nAnd then identification.\n\n69\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.090\nThe next phase would be identification\ncuz once we're prepared,\n\n70\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.870\nonce we have everything set up,\nall our tools in place,\n\n71\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.820\nwe've done all this, then we're gonna find\nout that we've had an incident, right?\n\n72\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.950\nSome kind of breach or infection or\n\n73\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.080\nsomething that triggers\nour first response.\n\n74\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.680\nWell, we got to identify that, right?\n\n75\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.470\nThat might be manually looking through log\nfiles, or noticing some strange behavior\n\n76\n00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.600\non the network or on a machine, or\nIDS or IPS systems, sending out alerts.\n\n77\n00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.060\nSomething is gonna identify us to\n\n78\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.610\nthe fact that there's been some kind\nof incident that we need to respond to.\n\n79\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.470\nSo we need to be able to detect it.\n\n80\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.250\nWe need to analyze it,\nbecause it might be a false alarm.\n\n81\n00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.150\nIt might be that my IDS sent up\nan alert saying there's excessive\n\n82\n00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.980\nFTP traffic coming from a subnet that\ndoesn't normally have FTP traffic on it.\n\n83\n00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.680\nAnd we get to, the response team goes and\ndoes what it's suppose to do.\n\n84\n00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.670\nWe go down there, we look, we analyze,\nand we realize that hey they're using\n\n85\n00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.730\na new way to upload files to some\nserver and they're doing FTP and\n\n86\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.220\nit was different from our base line,\nso it triggers some kind of alert.\n\n87\n00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.910\nSo identification not only of\nwhen there is an incident, but\n\n88\n00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.340\nwhen there's not an incident, right?\n\n89\n00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.230\nBeing able to analyze some\nkind of occurrence and\n\n90\n00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.390\ndetermine whether it's an incident or not.\n\n91\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.040\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, make sure, right,\nahead of time, we're prepared.\n\n92\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.560\nSo we're not proverbial run around\nlike chickens with our heads cut off.\n\n93\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.450\nJust like any kinda professional boxer\nwould practice before they go into\n\n94\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.640\na fight, we do our identification.\n\n95\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.160\nNow, once we've identified,\n\n96\n00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.310\nwe do have some kinda incidents,\nwhat's the next step?\n\n97\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.550\nWhere do we go from there?\n\n98\n00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, o our next phase would be to,\nwell, kind of in between phases.\n\n99\n00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.800\nThey have it listed with identification,\nwith the analysis and\n\n100\n00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.870\ncollection, like I was saying,\ndeciding if this is an incident,\n\n101\n00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.930\nif it is something that we need to pursue.\n\n102\n00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.720\nBut then containment would\nbe the next thing, right?\n\n103\n00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.840\nIf you determine that,\nhey, this is an infection.\n\n104\n00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.850\nThis machine has got malware on it.\n\n105\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.510\nIt's listening on a certain port.\n\n106\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.088\nIt has a back door.\n\n107\n00:05:36.088 --> 00:05:41.530\nOr it's exfiltrating data off\nof the company's network,\n\n108\n00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.070\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n109\n00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.710\nYou're gonna have to contain that.\n\n110\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.370\nAnd the containment phase,\nfew things we wanna worry about.\n\n111\n00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.430\nFirst and foremost,\nthat we always wanna think about.\n\n112\n00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.930\nEnsure the safety and\nsecurity of personnel, right?\n\n113\n00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.290\nHuman life comes first.\n\n114\n00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.830\nData is replaceable for the most part.\n\n115\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.090\nSystems are replaceable.\n\n116\n00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.930\nYou gotta make sure your people are safe.\n\n117\n00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.110\nNow, you might be thinking, well,\ntalking about cyber incidents.\n\n118\n00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.540\nHow dangerous is this?\n\n119\n00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.900\nIt's not like we're the bomb squad and\n\n120\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.490\ngoing and pulling out,\nI don't know, whatever.\n\n121\n00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.130\nWhat if you worked in one of those\npowerplants that got hit by Stuxnet or\n\n122\n00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.720\nsomething like that?\n\n123\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.390\nSo it's not out of the realm of\npossibilities that human life\n\n124\n00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.760\ncould be in danger.\n\n125\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.850\nThey trigger your fire suppression system,\nand god forbid, you're still using some of\n\n126\n00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.010\nthose old chemicals that kill people,\ncuz theysuck up all the oxygen in the air.\n\n127\n00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.960\n&gt;&gt; And speaking of Stuxnet, if I remember\nright, I mean, it was attacking things\n\n128\n00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.659\nlike the PLCs, those programmable\nlogic controllers on a major system.\n\n129\n00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:44.646\nAnd those control things like valves, so\n\n130\n00:06:44.646 --> 00:06:48.140\nyou very well could be in a situation\nwhere human life is in jeopardy.\n\n131\n00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if they start getting a meltdown\nbecause the cooling system's been shut\n\n132\n00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.150\ndown, you work for some power plant or\nsomething like that,\n\n133\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.320\nor any number of things, there's a fire\nin the building and they've remotely\n\n134\n00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.380\ncontrolled your electronic door locks and\nthey don't fail open, they fail closed.\n\n135\n00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.400\nI mean, there's a lot of possibilities and\nI don't wanna guess what could happen, but\n\n136\n00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.460\nthe point is we've gotta consider\nhumanly life, our employees, everybody.\n\n137\n00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.180\nTheir safety and\nsecurity personnel, comes first.\n\n138\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.540\nRemove the devices from the network\nwould be the next thing, right?\n\n139\n00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.021\nWe wanna contain this, we want to isolate\nit from the rest of the network to\n\n140\n00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:27.368\nminimize the impact,\nthe damage that it's causing.\n\n141\n00:07:27.368 --> 00:07:29.491\nWe've got a machine that's infected.\n\n142\n00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.310\nAnd if it's a worm,\n\n143\n00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.930\nit's probably already too late, it's\nprobably already spread across my network.\n\n144\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.250\nBut if it's, what we try to do is try\nto minimize the impact on the rest of\n\n145\n00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.150\nthe network,\nlimit where that infection can spread.\n\n146\n00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.340\nAnd that means disconnecting that from\nthe network, at the bare minimum, right?\n\n147\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.270\nIsolating it out.\n\n148\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.520\nDisabling communication between\nnetwork devices if we need to.\n\n149\n00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.530\nDisabling network user accounts possibly.\n\n150\n00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.930\nIf we know what account was used for\nthe breach,\n\n151\n00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.080\nmaking sure that account can't reach out\nand touch anything else on the network.\n\n152\n00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.053\nDisabling e-mail accounts.\n\n153\n00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:06.879\nLimiting access to affected subnets For\nexample, again,\n\n154\n00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:10.264\nisolation, whatever means necessary.\n\n155\n00:08:10.264 --> 00:08:14.891\nNotice what I didn't say was\npower off the machine, right?\n\n156\n00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:18.720\nAlthough, certain circumstances,\nthat might be warranted.\n\n157\n00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.500\nBut if we are planning on\ngathering evidence, we think about\n\n158\n00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.830\nthe rules of volatility and the fact, that\nif I power that machine down, I lose RAM.\n\n159\n00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:34.870\nI lose caches, temp file, possibly,\nof browsers, clear temp files on exiting.\n\n160\n00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.580\nThings like that.\n\n161\n00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.730\nIf you just go and\nyank the power to that thing,\n\n162\n00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.570\nwe could definitely lose that information.\n\n163\n00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.770\nThere's also the possibility\nthat you alert the attacker.\n\n164\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.340\nMaybe you're trying to\ngather more evidence.\n\n165\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.240\nThat's why I say,\nit kind of depends on what your goal is,\n\n166\n00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.330\nwhat your policies,\nyour incident response plans dictate.\n\n167\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.390\nDo we wait and\nsee if we can gather more evidence, or\n\n168\n00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.150\ndo we immediately remove it from\nthe network to isolate the damage?\n\n169\n00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.960\nBut the next phase is containment and\n\n170\n00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.550\nthen treat the compromise\nsystem as a crime scene.\n\n171\n00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.070\nAnother important thing.\n\n172\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.970\nAll right, because again, we've got\nevidence that we want to capture.\n\n173\n00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:18.790\nMe going up there and\njust unplugging cables, moving paperwork,\n\n174\n00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.410\nclosing the laptop lid,\nall of that is changing the crime scene.\n\n175\n00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:28.870\nYou are potentially invalidating,\nif that's the right word, evidence, right?\n\n176\n00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.820\nYou're corrupting evidence.\n\n177\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.770\nSo it's no longer gonna be\nvalid in a court of law, or\n\n178\n00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.100\nyou've just lost the ability\nto collect that.\n\n179\n00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.460\nI remember, one of my first practices\nof doing an incident of response.\n\n180\n00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:46.650\nThey've got a computer set on the table,\na couple USB sticks laying around there.\n\n181\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.059\nAnd they say, okay you go in,\nwhat is your first step?\n\n182\n00:09:50.059 --> 00:09:52.880\nAnd so I immediately go in and\nI'm looking at the computer.\n\n183\n00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.050\nAnd I go to move, I think I moved\none of the thumb drives, and\n\n184\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.080\nthe guy was like nope, stop.\n\n185\n00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.550\nRight, first failure already,\nyou haven't even got there yet and\n\n186\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.640\nyou've already failed.\n\n187\n00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.771\nPictures, take document,\neverything, it's a crime scene.\n\n188\n00:10:06.771 --> 00:10:10.380\nYou've all seen the TV shows,\nyou tape it off with caution tape.\n\n189\n00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.420\nYou put little numbers next to everything\nyou find, you take pictures, right.\n\n190\n00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.160\nUntil we get that documented,\nwe can't collect that evidence.\n\n191\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.540\nSo, it is gonna be treated\nlike a crime scene.\n\n192\n00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.690\nIt's a little different with a computer\ngranted a lot of the evidence is gonna be\n\n193\n00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:29.050\nin the computer itself, but\nwhat's around it is just as important.\n\n194\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.850\nYou've got a charging cable still\nplugged into the computer, but\n\n195\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.280\nnothing at the other end of it.\n\n196\n00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.130\nYou've got a USB cap but\nno USB stick, right?\n\n197\n00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.626\nThese are the kinds of things that\nmight mean something later on.\n\n198\n00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:44.420\nWhat ports they were actually connected\nto in the back of the machine.\n\n199\n00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.670\nYou know, they're taking that\ncable out of that wall and\n\n200\n00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.660\nplugging it into a rogue\nwireless access point.\n\n201\n00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.320\nLittle things like that that\nyou might not think about.\n\n202\n00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.420\nTaking screen shots,\n\n203\n00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.700\ntaking pictures of what's currently on the\nscreen when you walked in is a good thing.\n\n204\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.110\nScreensaver's gonna kick in,\n\n205\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.185\nthings change,\nmight as well grab that information.\n\n206\n00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:07.475\n&gt;&gt; Mike, it sounds like another concept\nand I know that you've told us before.\n\n207\n00:11:07.475 --> 00:11:09.086\nIt sounds like chain of\ncustody search right away.\n\n208\n00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:13.978\nI mean, you got to document the whole\narea before you even start moving things,\n\n209\n00:11:13.978 --> 00:11:16.774\nbefore you take things\nout of the scene here.\n\n210\n00:11:16.774 --> 00:11:19.850\nBecause ultimately,\nwhen it goes into a court of law,\n\n211\n00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:24.620\nright, whoever the, defense attorney could\nsay, well that's not my information.\n\n212\n00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:30.790\nThat certainly wasn't the way my client,\nif you will, handled the information.\n\n213\n00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.429\nAnd now we just can't use it anymore,\nright?\n\n214\n00:11:32.429 --> 00:11:34.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all they'd need is\na shadow of a doubt, right.\n\n215\n00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.460\nReasonable doubt and\n\n216\n00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.030\nwe can get it thrown out or\nthe judge says no you can't use that.\n\n217\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.380\nYou can definitely damage your case.\n\n218\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.540\nAlso keep in mind too that\nwhen we say a lot of this,\n\n219\n00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.540\nwe're not talking about doing\nforensics analysis at this point.\n\n220\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.030\nWe are cyber seg first responders.\n\n221\n00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.960\nWe're gonna go in,\nwe're the first ones on the scene.\n\n222\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.610\nWe're gonna make sure that we\ncontain the incident, if we can.\n\n223\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.950\nWe're gonna document everything we see.\n\n224\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.376\nAnd then, at some point,\nwe'd make that decision.\n\n225\n00:12:03.376 --> 00:12:05.567\nDo we go further or do we call in?\n\n226\n00:12:05.567 --> 00:12:09.712\nMaybe we have a third party that we\nhave on retainer that comes in and\n\n227\n00:12:09.712 --> 00:12:11.428\ndoes the actual forensic.\n\n228\n00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:14.271\nWe might gather up all the evidence,\nbag and tag it and all of that.\n\n229\n00:12:14.271 --> 00:12:17.620\nAnd then shift it off to somebody if we\nplan on using it in the court of law.\n\n230\n00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.200\nWe do have to keep in mind\nwhat our skill sets are.\n\n231\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.876\nAnd if I'm not trained up in forensics,\nI'm not going to attempt it.\n\n232\n00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:26.317\nI'll do everything I can to\nget the evidence ready for\n\n233\n00:12:26.317 --> 00:12:28.150\nthat forensic investigation.\n\n234\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.140\nBut I won't actually do it, because I\ncan end up tainting the evidence and\n\n235\n00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.350\nmaking it inadmissible.\n\n236\n00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.780\nBut maybe as a small organization,\nmaybe you're the first responder and\n\n237\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.360\nthe forensics investigator.\n\n238\n00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.210\nYou do it all.\n\n239\n00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.160\nSo we contain it.\n\n240\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.540\nWe've tried to limit the damage and the\namount of damage infection that we have.\n\n241\n00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.840\nAnd then we eradicate it, right?\n\n242\n00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.550\nOnce we identify the systems\nthat are affected,\n\n243\n00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:58.000\nwe try to remove the malware,\nif that's what it is.\n\n244\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.127\nLike I said it really depends\non what kind of incident,\n\n245\n00:13:00.127 --> 00:13:01.481\nkind of changes this a little bit.\n\n246\n00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:03.150\nBut that's all in your plan, right?\n\n247\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.500\nThis has all been decided ahead of\ntime in your incident response plan,\n\n248\n00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.180\nwhat you're gonna do if it's this.\n\n249\n00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.320\nWhat you're gonna do if it's you\nknow scenario B, for example.\n\n250\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.330\nThis and scenario B?\n\n251\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330\nI could say scenario A and\nscenario B, this and that.\n\n252\n00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.620\nI don't know, one of them.\n\n253\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.035\nAnyway, so yeah, eradication.\n\n254\n00:13:19.035 --> 00:13:21.320\nIdentify the systems that are affected.\n\n255\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.530\nOur whole goal here is to\nget things back to normal,\n\n256\n00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.990\nalthough that really kind of goes under\nthe recovery phase, which is the next one.\n\n257\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.125\nBut removing it.\n\n258\n00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:31.930\nHow do we eradicate it?\n\n259\n00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.430\nWell it depends on what the incident was.\n\n260\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.830\nIf it was malware on a system, maybe we\nreimage the system once we've gathered up\n\n261\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.770\nall the evidence that we want to analyze.\n\n262\n00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.240\nWe might do post analysis to\ndetermine how they got in,\n\n263\n00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.110\nhow we can better protect our network.\n\n264\n00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:51.804\nWe'll talk about the last\nphase here in a second.\n\n265\n00:13:51.804 --> 00:13:58.450\nBut we want to, if we have to reimage a\nmachine or remove malware from the system.\n\n266\n00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:04.720\nReplace hardware if they've done\nan attack that is damaged hardware.\n\n267\n00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.280\nTrying to think of some other examples.\n\n268\n00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.110\nRestoring data from backup,\nif they've encrypted or\n\n269\n00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:17.340\ndeleted data, or possibly modified data,\nso that we've lost integrity.\n\n270\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.760\nWe might be restoring data from backups.\n\n271\n00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.250\nAll of this is part of the,\nreally the recovery phase.\n\n272\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.330\nReboot servers,\nif they've had a denial of service attack.\n\n273\n00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.990\n&gt;&gt; Mike, it sounds a lot like this process\nhere, these last two phases, they're a lot\n\n274\n00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.270\nlike when we're doing, you mentioned\nmalware, like malware quarantine, right?\n\n275\n00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.860\nWe do a quarantine and\nthen we do the remediation of the system.\n\n276\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.710\nBoy, these terms really sound like\nthey're close to synonymous with\n\n277\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.290\nthat type of process, as well.\n\n278\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n279\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.290\nAnd yeah, we gotta watch that guy, Don.\n\n280\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.550\nHe was commenting in the chat room there\nfor those of you watching the recording.\n\n281\n00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.420\nHe was in here earlier with a laptop and\nan access.\n\n282\n00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.410\nYou never know what that guy's up to.\n\n283\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.460\nAll right, let's see what else.\n\n284\n00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.550\nWe talked about recovery.\n\n285\n00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.650\nAnd again, it might be wiping the system.\n\n286\n00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.910\nA root kit, for example,\nwe don't know If we've got it all,\n\n287\n00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.880\nwe just wipe the system and restore it.\n\n288\n00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.795\nAnd then you've got your\npost-incident process, right?\n\n289\n00:15:08.795 --> 00:15:12.552\nAfter the recovery and\nwe've got things back to normal.\n\n290\n00:15:12.552 --> 00:15:17.350\nEverybody's like, okay,\nwe're done, we're back to normal.\n\n291\n00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.600\nThen we go in and\nwe do what we call our lessons learned.\n\n292\n00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.297\nAnd that's when we're gonna review\neverything, the steps that were taken.\n\n293\n00:15:24.297 --> 00:15:28.720\nWhat we accomplished,\nhow we win about the restoration process.\n\n294\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.676\nAnd we've review it, so that we can hey,\n\n295\n00:15:31.676 --> 00:15:37.350\nwas there anything I could have done that\nwould have made this easier or better?\n\n296\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.046\nIs there something we missed in our plan?\n\n297\n00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:43.848\nLike I wish we would have done this\nbecause, in that eradication face it would\n\n298\n00:15:43.848 --> 00:15:47.100\nhave been really beneficial\nto have that information.\n\n299\n00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.370\nThis is our chance.\n\n300\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.720\nLearn from what we've seen.\n\n301\n00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.880\nDocument.\n\n302\n00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.450\nAdjust plans if necessary.\n\n303\n00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.213\nHow did the team react?\n\n304\n00:15:56.213 --> 00:15:58.110\nWell, everybody except that Mike guy.\n\n305\n00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:02.879\nMike was panicked, you could see the sweat\non his forehead, we need more training for\n\n306\n00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:03.485\nthat guy.\n\n307\n00:16:03.485 --> 00:16:06.349\nAgain, should we respond differently?\n\n308\n00:16:06.349 --> 00:16:08.585\nDo I need to update my security policy?\n\n309\n00:16:08.585 --> 00:16:13.117\nCome to find out, the user was doing\nsomething that caused this infection but\n\n310\n00:16:13.117 --> 00:16:14.938\nthey didn't know any better.\n\n311\n00:16:14.938 --> 00:16:20.440\nAnd we never identified that\nvulnerability in our acceptable use or\n\n312\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.980\nwhatever it might be.\n\n313\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:23.640\nSo they didn't know.\n\n314\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.770\nSo now we need to update\nour security policies.\n\n315\n00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.280\nTo include that information something\nwe learned that we didn't think about\n\n316\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.360\nbefore the incident.\n\n317\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.150\nSo post-incident processing or\n\n318\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.560\nlessons learned is an extremely valuable\npart of the incident response plan.\n\n319\n00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.720\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I know you've stressed\nthe first responder here,\n\n320\n00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.530\nin any kind of situation like this,\nwe educate our users, right?\n\n321\n00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:44.461\nAnd that's an ongoing things.\n\n322\n00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:46.149\nSo a good part of lessons learned,\n\n323\n00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:48.660\nbeing maybe a new lesson\nthat we weren't aware of.\n\n324\n00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.259\nThat we now need to\nteach to our employees.\n\n325\n00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:52.786\nIn the example where a user might\nhave been doing something that they\n\n326\n00:16:52.786 --> 00:16:54.438\ndidn't intentionally do anything wrong.\n\n327\n00:16:54.438 --> 00:16:56.270\nBut it certainly caused\nproblems nonetheless.\n\n328\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great point.\n\n329\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.820\nYeah, you might update your user training.\n\n330\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.480\nYou might say, we need to add a lesson\nin clicking on links in emails.\n\n331\n00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.430\nOr how to look in the header feed of\nthe email to see if it's actually from\n\n332\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:13.121\nsomebody in our domain,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n333\n00:17:15.211 --> 00:17:16.180\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n334\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:20.580\nSo it might be something that we can\nincorporate into our policies or\n\n335\n00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.330\ninto our training program\nto prevent in the future.\n\n336\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:27.936\nAnd that's the whole goal, is to make sure\nthat we can figure out what happened,\n\n337\n00:17:27.936 --> 00:17:29.992\nwhy it happened, clean things up.\n\n338\n00:17:29.992 --> 00:17:33.256\nAnd then hopefully figure out\na control that we can implement\n\n339\n00:17:33.256 --> 00:17:36.090\nto prevent it from happening again.\n\n340\n00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.300\nThat would be ideal, so\nthose are the big phases.\n\n341\n00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.640\nWhen we talk about again,\nlogical operations,\n\n342\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.050\nthey want us to talk about\nthe incident response process.\n\n343\n00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:46.980\nSo preparation, getting everything ready.\n\n344\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.170\nThat means coming up with our policies and\nour procedures, and\n\n345\n00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.110\nthen our incident response plan.\n\n346\n00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.503\nAnd defining that, working out\nthe kinks in there, practicing that.\n\n347\n00:17:56.503 --> 00:18:01.309\nRunning through dry exercises,\ntabletop exercises are fantastic for\n\n348\n00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:02.680\nthis kind of thing.\n\n349\n00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.760\nGetting everybody together,\n\n350\n00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.200\nbrainstorming, trying to see if there's\nanything we've missed in our plan.\n\n351\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.330\nWe forgot, nowhere in here is it notifying\nthe CEO that there's been an incident.\n\n352\n00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:16.650\nOops, probably a big no-no, so\nI need to include that information.\n\n353\n00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.610\nAnd then the identification\nphase where we try to, or\n\n354\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.810\nwhere we determine there\nhas been an incident.\n\n355\n00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.847\nHey, everybody's been going along their\ndaily routine, everything's good.\n\n356\n00:18:25.847 --> 00:18:27.991\nAll of a sudden that\nIPS throws up an alert.\n\n357\n00:18:27.991 --> 00:18:31.987\nWhen a user calls you up and says, hey,\nmy mouse is moving across my screen and\n\n358\n00:18:31.987 --> 00:18:34.525\nit's opening up files and\nI'm not touching it.\n\n359\n00:18:34.525 --> 00:18:36.680\nSomething is wrong here.\n\n360\n00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:41.160\nSo somehow we've got to detect or realize\nthat there has been a potential incident.\n\n361\n00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.190\nAnd we have to analyze that.\n\n362\n00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.450\nIs this an incident?\n\n363\n00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.560\nOr is it the case of\nyour desk is crooked and\n\n364\n00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.470\nyour mouse was kind of sliding down there\nand just looks like somebody's moving it?\n\n365\n00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.790\nMaybe, so\n\n366\n00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:58.260\nidentifying that there is indeed to reason\nto call out the incident response team.\n\n367\n00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.580\nAnd then containing it,\nmaking sure that we first and\n\n368\n00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.640\nforemost, protect our personnel,\nour employees, our guest, whomever it is.\n\n369\n00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.670\nMaking sure that there's no harm or\n\n370\n00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.110\nthat we can remove any safety concerns for\nthem.\n\n371\n00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:14.240\nThen we're gonna go about\nthe business of isolating it,\n\n372\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.270\ntrying to contain the incident.\n\n373\n00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.840\nPreventing malware from spreading.\n\n374\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.830\nPreventing somebody from bouncing\nfrom one server to the next and\n\n375\n00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.720\ngaining access to more information.\n\n376\n00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.640\nWhatever the case may be, limiting\naccess to the subnet that the infected\n\n377\n00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.750\nmachine was on and\ntreating it as a crime scene, right?\n\n378\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.590\nMaking sure that we do what\nwe can to preserve evidence.\n\n379\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.960\nWhether we are or not the forensics\nteam that's going to actually do\n\n380\n00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.790\nthe forensics analysis which\nis post incident, right.\n\n381\n00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.660\nOnce we've done our containment.\n\n382\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.030\nWe've gathered our evidence.\n\n383\n00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:55.194\nMaking sure that we do what we can\nto preserve any possible evidence.\n\n384\n00:19:55.194 --> 00:20:00.120\nIn the immediate area of where the breach\noccurred or incident occurred.\n\n385\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.784\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about first responders,\nMike.\n\n386\n00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:04.301\nWould an outside like law enforcement,\n\n387\n00:20:04.301 --> 00:20:07.860\nif you're talking about\ntreating it like a crime scene.\n\n388\n00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.620\nWe learn that there is some kind\nof crime that's gone on here,\n\n389\n00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.331\ncould part of that first response be.\n\n390\n00:20:12.331 --> 00:20:15.430\nHey, we need to call the authorities in\nhere and we need to bring them in here.\n\n391\n00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.456\nCuz they need to be aware what's\ngoing on inside of this incident or\n\n392\n00:20:18.456 --> 00:20:19.956\nwherever it's happening.\n\n393\n00:20:19.956 --> 00:20:20.733\n&gt;&gt; Yes for sure yeah,\n\n394\n00:20:20.733 --> 00:20:23.759\nthat's one of the things that we talk\nabout with incident response team.\n\n395\n00:20:23.759 --> 00:20:27.361\nIs you gotta know ahead of time\nthis would be in your planning,\n\n396\n00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:30.230\nat what point do we look for outside help?\n\n397\n00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.320\nWho makes that determination?\n\n398\n00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.320\nIs that the end user?\n\n399\n00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.150\nThat their mouse is moving\nstrange on the screen.\n\n400\n00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.519\nThey're not calling 911, right?\n\n401\n00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:39.870\nWe've gotta make sure that doesn't happen.\n\n402\n00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.220\nSo somebody on my\nincident response team or\n\n403\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.790\nsomebody that we notify\nmakes that decision.\n\n404\n00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.210\nBut yes, there is nothing wrong\nwith bringing in outside help.\n\n405\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:51.480\nIf you don't have the qualified\npersonnel to deal with it.\n\n406\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.013\nIf you know that this\nis gonna be prosecuted,\n\n407\n00:20:54.013 --> 00:20:56.354\nyou wanna get law enforcement involved.\n\n408\n00:20:56.354 --> 00:20:59.405\nBecause they're the ones trained in this,\n\n409\n00:20:59.405 --> 00:21:03.710\nthey're familiar with the court\nsystems and all of that.\n\n410\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.770\nI might be going to federal resources.\n\n411\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.890\nAnd there might be third party\nprivate corporations that provide\n\n412\n00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.060\nservices that we've got a retainer\nwith that we can call in.\n\n413\n00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:18.160\nBut absolutely we have\na list in our communications\n\n414\n00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.100\nplan of when we need outside personnel,\nwhen we're gonna bring that in.\n\n415\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.800\nIf it's something like, it'd have to be\nsomething crazy like child porn, right.\n\n416\n00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.550\nThis something where now I've gotta\nget the federal authorities in here.\n\n417\n00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.350\nAnd if I don't I can be in trouble.\n\n418\n00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.930\nSo we've got to make sure we understand\nwhen we're supposed to notify those\n\n419\n00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.320\noutside people.\n\n420\n00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.630\nEradication, getting rid of it,\ncleaning it.\n\n421\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.037\nMaybe we've duplicated the hard drive,\nwe've done a memory scrape.\n\n422\n00:21:42.037 --> 00:21:45.065\nWe've gathered up all of the evidence,\nwe've photographed everything.\n\n423\n00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:46.725\nNow I've got to get that\nsystem back online.\n\n424\n00:21:46.725 --> 00:21:48.765\nWe've got our evidence,\nit's bagged and tagged.\n\n425\n00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:52.015\nNow I've gotta get this system back\nonline, I get work back flowing so\n\n426\n00:21:52.015 --> 00:21:55.285\nthat we can resume our daily business.\n\n427\n00:21:55.285 --> 00:21:59.275\nSo that's the recovery phase, and then\nagain going through that lessons learned.\n\n428\n00:21:59.275 --> 00:22:04.220\nSo that is your basic breakdown\nof the incident response process.\n\n429\n00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.920\n&gt;&gt; All right a lot of\ngreat information there.\n\n430\n00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.713\nDefinitely seems like we should have this\nin place before an incident happens.\n\n431\n00:22:09.713 --> 00:22:13.726\nSo we know what to do and again we are not\nrunning around pulling our hair out\n\n432\n00:22:13.726 --> 00:22:16.560\nsaying, hey well, we should have prepared.\n\n433\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.440\n&gt;&gt; I forgot something to mention.\n\n434\n00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.810\n&gt;&gt; Reporting and documentation.\n\n435\n00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.990\n&gt;&gt; I did.\nHow did I miss that I don't know.\n\n436\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.080\nWe do have to make sure.\n\n437\n00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.420\nI mean, I kinda lump it in with\nthe lessons learned because we're gonna be\n\n438\n00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.360\ngoing through all of\nthe documentation that we had.\n\n439\n00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.600\nBut yes, that is a phase of the incident\nresponse process is reporting and\n\n440\n00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.300\ndocumentation.\n\n441\n00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.260\nSo don't let me leave that one out.\n\n442\n00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.050\nExtremely important that we document\neverything that we are doing because\n\n443\n00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.800\nthis is gonna to help me the next time.\n\n444\n00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.237\nAll right when we're doing that lessons\nlearned, this is really what we're doing.\n\n445\n00:22:48.237 --> 00:22:49.807\nIs we're looking at our documentation and\n\n446\n00:22:49.807 --> 00:22:51.740\nwe're seeing what we could\nhave done differently.\n\n447\n00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.600\nWhat worked?\n\n448\n00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.680\nWhat didn't work?\n\n449\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.850\nWe are gonna need reports to maybe\ngive to the c-level executives.\n\n450\n00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.250\nSo they can see what happened.\n\n451\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.650\nAnd we can ask them for\n\n452\n00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.380\nmoney to implement new controls to\nprevent this kind of thing in the future.\n\n453\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.400\nSo yeah, sorry,\n\n454\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.512\ndon't let me forget to include the good\nold reporting and documentation.\n\n455\n00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:12.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, we were glad that you\ndid throw that in there cuz we want you to\n\n456\n00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.400\nbe, well, exam complete.\n\n457\n00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.320\nIn case they ask you on that\n\n458\n00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.290\nexam you'd like to have that\nanswer ready and waiting.\n\n459\n00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.384\nNow does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode Mike.\n\n460\n00:23:20.384 --> 00:23:24.293\nBut before we do, any final words when it\ncomes to things like incident response.\n\n461\n00:23:24.293 --> 00:23:29.220\nAnd how are we gonna implement\nthis inside of our organizations?\n\n462\n00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.320\n&gt;&gt; Like I said I think for\n\n463\n00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.620\nme the biggest thing is doing\nthe preparation phase, and the practice.\n\n464\n00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.450\nRight cuz that's really what is\ngonna make everything go smooth.\n\n465\n00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:42.178\nBecause I'm gonna get a chance\nto try these tools out,\n\n466\n00:23:42.178 --> 00:23:43.668\nto understand how they work.\n\n467\n00:23:43.668 --> 00:23:45.044\nto see what I get back.\n\n468\n00:23:45.044 --> 00:23:49.563\nWe're gonna practice this stuff so\nthat when the actual incident occurs and\n\n469\n00:23:49.563 --> 00:23:51.480\nI'm called upon to do this job.\n\n470\n00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.672\nI will feel comfortable about it.\n\n471\n00:23:53.672 --> 00:23:55.260\nAnd I'll be able to use the tools.\n\n472\n00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.801\nI'll be able to pick the right tool for\n\n473\n00:23:56.801 --> 00:23:58.920\nwhatever job it is cuz\nI've seen it before.\n\n474\n00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.780\nI know what it does.\n\n475\n00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.510\nI know what its output is.\n\n476\n00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:05.390\nAnd I'll just be a better\nincident responder for that.\n\n477\n00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.930\nSo preparation, spend a lot of time there.\n\n478\n00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.920\n&gt;&gt; Practice makes perfect,\nwords of wisdom from Mr. Rodrick.\n\n479\n00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.241\nMike, as always, we appreciate\nyou being here in the studio.\n\n480\n00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:16.700\nAnd we do appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n481\n00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.550\nLooks like we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here for ITProTV.\n\n482\n00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.562\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n483\n00:24:20.562 --> 00:24:21.623\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n484\n00:24:21.623 --> 00:24:23.138\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n485\n00:24:23.138 --> 00:24:30.158\n[MUSIC]\n\n486\n00:24:30.158 --> 00:24:35.139\nThank you for watching ITProTV\n\n",

00:00:16.180\nAll right greetings everyone and welcome\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.340\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.340\ntoday's episode we are back with more,\nour CyberSec First Responder series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.180\nAnd of course, joining us yet\nagain, that's right,\n\n7\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.640\nwe can never get enough of the man, right?\n\n8\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.620\nHe is awesome.\n\n9\n00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.360\nHe is Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.792\nMike, welcome back, man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:31.868\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's going great.\n\n12\n00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:33.097\nThank you for those props.\n\n13\n00:00:33.097 --> 00:00:34.280\nI know you did, right?\n\n14\n00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.500\nI really do appreciate that and\nexcited to be here as always,\n\n15\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.030\nbecause we are continuing, as Daniel said,\n\n16\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.100\nour CyberSec First Responder\nfrom logical operations.\n\n17\n00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.200\nAnd in this episode,\n\n18\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.460\nwe're gonna be looking at the objective\nexplain general mitigation methods and\n\n19\n00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.500\ndevices, sorry not techniques methods and\ndevices.\n\n20\n00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.100\nIn this kind of stuff, we've talked\nabout it in other classes or shows.\n\n21\n00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.090\nBut it's a concept that, even in our first\nresponder, we're saying the same thing.\n\n22\n00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.470\nAnd that just shows you the importance of\nunderstanding how we can go about this.\n\n23\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.670\nCuz our job as a SYST member or\n\n24\n00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.970\na CSIRTS member is not just\nto do the incident response.\n\n25\n00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.590\nI mean that is one of our primary jobs.\n\n26\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.170\nWe are trained to be the first\nresponders in dealing with incidents.\n\n27\n00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.427\nBut when we deal with an incident,\npart of that dealing with it is\n\n28\n00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:36.280\ngoing to be containing it,\neradicating it, and then mitigating,\n\n29\n00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.620\ntrying to figure out how this happened and\nprevent it from happening again, right?\n\n30\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.523\nSo understanding hardening techniques,\n\n31\n00:01:42.523 --> 00:01:45.530\nknowing how we can put these in place to,\nhopefully be proactive and\n\n32\n00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.933\nprevent anything from\nhappening in the first place.\n\n33\n00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:52.329\nBut even so, if something does happen,\nlearning from that and understanding how\n\n34\n00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.420\nwe can implement different techniques\nto protect ourselves in the future.\n\n35\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.895\nSo, one of the things that you talk\nabout again is system hardening.\n\n36\n00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:04.475\nAnd when you it comes to system hardening\nthis is a pretty basic topic I mean\n\n37\n00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:06.095\n&gt;&gt; You pour shellac on the computer.\n\n38\n00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:07.713\nYou wait a few hours it's hard.\n\n39\n00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:08.905\n&gt;&gt; I like Quickrete,\n\n40\n00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:13.010\nit mixes up really quick you know just a\nlittle bit of water and you're good to go.\n\n41\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.700\nAnd that system-\n&gt;&gt; Good luck getting into that.\n\n42\n00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.729\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nobody's getting into that thing.\n\n43\n00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:21.716\nBut, that kind of kills our availability\ntriad, or our CIA triad, yeah, so\n\n44\n00:02:21.716 --> 00:02:23.580\nlet's try something else.\n\n45\n00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.720\nBut again, basic concepts that we've\nlearned in many of our classes,\n\n46\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.100\ndeactivating, or removing, or\nturning off unnecessary services.\n\n47\n00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.520\nI mean, that's gotta be one of our very\nbasic first steps when hardening any\n\n48\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.000\nserver is don't run things you don't need.\n\n49\n00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.151\nI always say this,\nI go back to like the Window 2000 days,\n\n50\n00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:48.925\nback when you would install IIS,\n\n51\n00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:54.197\nyou would also get an NTP servers and\nFTP server, SMTP server.\n\n52\n00:02:54.197 --> 00:02:56.740\nYou get all kinds of things\njust by checking IIS.\n\n53\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.300\nAnd so, if you weren't paying attention,\nyou wouldn't realize you were running FTP,\n\n54\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.100\nbut your server was darn\nsure listening on 20 and\n\n55\n00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.250\n21, waiting for a nice FTP connections.\n\n56\n00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.640\nBut going through and understanding\nthis kind of goes along with baselining.\n\n57\n00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.580\nUnderstanding what you have,\nwhat services should be there, and\n\n58\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.790\nwhat shouldn't be there, and making sure\nthat those services are not running.\n\n59\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.035\nBecause remember if a service is running\nand it's listening on a port waiting for\n\n60\n00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:21.855\nconnections.\n\n61\n00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:25.379\nThat's just a doorway into that\nsystem that somebody is gonna find.\n\n62\n00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.742\nAnd if your not using it,\nregularly if you're not monitoring it,\n\n63\n00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:33.300\nif you don't even know that it's there,\nit's gonna get compromised.\n\n64\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.670\nSo deactivating, disabling unnecessary\nservices, patching, right?\n\n65\n00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.380\nAgain, a very basic concept, but it goes\na long way in protecting our systems.\n\n66\n00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.900\nBecause vendors are writing patches.\n\n67\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.930\nThey realize when a vulnerability is\nfound, the vendors are notified like,\n\n68\n00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.790\nhey, we found this\nvulnerability in your system.\n\n69\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.030\nAnd they immediately go to\nwork in creating patches for\n\n70\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.540\nthat, and\ngetting those out to the public, so\n\n71\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.425\nthat you're not compromised\ndue to a flaw in their system.\n\n72\n00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:03.850\nCuz that's not gonna be good for\nbusiness for\n\n73\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.130\nthem, and so they're doing what they can.\n\n74\n00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.590\nBut if we're only getting patches\nonce a week, or once a month.\n\n75\n00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.890\nWe're gonna be vulnerable to things\nthat we really shouldn't be.\n\n76\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.950\nSo keeping your systems patched up.\n\n77\n00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.680\nLooking at either automating the process,\nlike we can with our operating systems,\n\n78\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.810\nor visiting the vendor sites on\na regular basis, or subscribing.\n\n79\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.541\nA lot of these vendors,\nhardware vendors, you can subscribe.\n\n80\n00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.635\nAnd they will send you notices, hey look,\nwe're releasing a new firmware for that\n\n81\n00:04:32.635 --> 00:04:36.690\nversion of such and such that you bought\nfrom us, here is your link to download it.\n\n82\n00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.992\nMake sure you get it installed, call\nus if you need any help, kind of thing.\n\n83\n00:04:39.992 --> 00:04:42.970\nSo making sure we're\nstaying on top of that.\n\n84\n00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.170\nDisabling unused user accounts.\n\n85\n00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.020\nAnother big,\n\n86\n00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.050\nbig, big one that should be a very basic\nthing, we need an off-boarding process.\n\n87\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.161\nMany people talk about on-boarding\nprocesses, bringing new employees in.\n\n88\n00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:59.030\nWe need just as important as\nhaving that off-boarding process.\n\n89\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.746\nPeople leaving the organization, or\n\n90\n00:05:00.746 --> 00:05:02.950\nchanging departments\nthat changes their role.\n\n91\n00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.620\nDoes a user account need to remain active?\n\n92\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.860\nIf they're changing roles maybe we just\nneed to change what groups it belongs to,\n\n93\n00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.920\nor what permissions it has.\n\n94\n00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.080\nOr if they're leaving the organization,\n\n95\n00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.280\nwe need disable that account\naltogether make sure nobody can use it.\n\n96\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.790\nI know we talked about I can't remember\nit was this series or another one.\n\n97\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.620\nWe talked about that\nhealthcare organization that\n\n98\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.530\ngot fined 5.5 million\ndollars due to HIPAA fines.\n\n99\n00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.104\nAnd a big part of it was because they had\na user account that the employee had left\n\n100\n00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:34.089\nover a year ago.\n\n101\n00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:37.638\nAnd that account was still being used\nto access confidential information,\n\n102\n00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:39.260\nshould have never happened.\n\n103\n00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.130\nAnd because of that their\nfines were even greater.\n\n104\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.390\nBecause it was almost like\nyou don't even care enough,\n\n105\n00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.970\nyou're not doing your due diligence.\n\n106\n00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.300\nIf you had done everything you could do,\n\n107\n00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.560\nand you still got breached,\nthat's one thing.\n\n108\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.249\nBut to leave user accounts laying around\nthat have access to this stuff that\n\n109\n00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.333\nthe employee's not even there anymore,\nthey're not gonna look too kindly on that.\n\n110\n00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:59.020\n&gt;&gt; That's just asking for\ntrouble at that point.\n\n111\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.430\nI always said I never want to be a part of\nanything that has to do with Healthcare,\n\n112\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.976\nor Financial institutes.\n\n113\n00:06:03.976 --> 00:06:06.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because their restrictions are so\n\n114\n00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.900\ntight, they're very difficult\nto stay on top of, and\n\n115\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.455\none slip up and\nyou're in front of the man.\n\n116\n00:06:11.455 --> 00:06:14.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, so patching those.\n\n117\n00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.420\nGetting rid of unused user accounts,\n\n118\n00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.769\nrestricting access to\nperipheral protocols.\n\n119\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.686\nIf you're in a secure environment and\n\n120\n00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:26.471\nyou don't wanna allow USB drives or\nanything USB.\n\n121\n00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:31.100\nWe can restrict those using policies and\nsettings within our operating system.\n\n122\n00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.400\nI know a lot of you have watched\nAdam Gordon in some of our other series.\n\n123\n00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.070\nAnd I remember him telling\nme a great story of going to\n\n124\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.500\na highly secure military\nbase to do some training.\n\n125\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.450\nAnd he's bringing his laptop with him.\n\n126\n00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.665\nAnd the guy at the gate takes his laptop,\nlooks at it.\n\n127\n00:06:47.665 --> 00:06:51.365\nCuz like you can't take this\nin it's got USB ports on it.\n\n128\n00:06:51.365 --> 00:06:53.455\nI kinda need it, that's what I'm doing.\n\n129\n00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.845\nHe's like all right give me\nthe laptop here I can fix it for you.\n\n130\n00:06:55.845 --> 00:06:58.695\nTakes his laptop turns it on its side,\ntakes a tube of epoxy and\n\n131\n00:06:58.695 --> 00:07:01.215\njust squirts it right in there.\n\n132\n00:07:01.215 --> 00:07:03.058\nOkay, here's your laptop, all right.\n\n133\n00:07:03.058 --> 00:07:03.988\nAnd that was, so\n\n134\n00:07:03.988 --> 00:07:07.920\nthat's one way to make sure you're\nnot using peripherals like that.\n\n135\n00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.854\n&gt;&gt; I was joking about the shellac earlier,\nbut\n\n136\n00:07:09.854 --> 00:07:13.105\napparently that's a legitimate form\nof hardening in your system [LAUGH].\n\n137\n00:07:13.105 --> 00:07:18.334\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah just fill it up with\nglue and you're good to go right?\n\n138\n00:07:18.334 --> 00:07:22.095\nBut whatever we have to do that's a little\nextreme obviously, hopefully we can be\n\n139\n00:07:22.095 --> 00:07:25.146\na little bit more proactive,\nrather than taking a screwdriver and\n\n140\n00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:25.830\njabbing it-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.860\n&gt;&gt; In the USB port,\n\n142\n00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.210\nwhich would work, but\nis not what we really wanna do.\n\n143\n00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.630\nRestricting shell commands.\n\n144\n00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.280\nNot everybody needs to be\nable to run certain commands.\n\n145\n00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.160\nWe need to restrict that.\n\n146\n00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.950\nAll of this It just reduces\nthe attack surface on those servers,\n\n147\n00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.970\nand that's really what we're trying to do.\n\n148\n00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.570\nLimit the number of ways in.\n\n149\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.024\nLimit the number of vulnerabilities\nwe have to deal with.\n\n150\n00:07:48.024 --> 00:07:55.984\nUpdating internal security devices is\ngonna be another big part of this.\n\n151\n00:07:55.984 --> 00:08:01.150\nMaking sure that they talk about updating\ndevices that provide security to others.\n\n152\n00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.590\nIf I've got, like I was talking\nabout intrusion detection and\n\n153\n00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.420\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n154\n00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.830\nThese are what provide the security for\nmy network.\n\n155\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:14.750\nSo how can I expect it to provide\nan acceptable level of security?\n\n156\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.230\nIf it's not up-to-date, or if it's not\nconfigured right, if we haven't tested it,\n\n157\n00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.640\nif we don't configure it right and create\nall the rules we're supposed to create,\n\n158\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.840\nhow is it supposed to protect my network?\n\n159\n00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.320\nAnd that's what we're relying on, that's\none of our main lines of defense and\n\n160\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.880\nyet, we don't have it set up right.\n\n161\n00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.510\nSo, making sure that we update those\ndevices, and that means firmware.\n\n162\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.672\nThis is one that gets a lot of\npeople is from where because yeah\n\n163\n00:08:37.672 --> 00:08:39.600\nit can be a pain in the butt all right?\n\n164\n00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.184\nIt's not like your operating system\nupdates where it will go out every night\n\n165\n00:08:43.184 --> 00:08:46.376\nand talk to the vendor and\nsee if there's any updates and report back\n\n166\n00:08:46.376 --> 00:08:50.075\ndownload them install them and you come\nin the morning and everything is done.\n\n167\n00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:51.120\nGreat.\n\n168\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.446\nUnfortunately a lot of my device like\nrouters and switches they don't do that\n\n169\n00:08:54.446 --> 00:08:57.976\nthey don't go out and so, look there's\na new firmware update let's download and\n\n170\n00:08:57.976 --> 00:09:01.440\ninstall it you come in the next day and,\nwow, it updated last night.\n\n171\n00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.140\nYeah, and unfortunately,\nit's not quite that easy.\n\n172\n00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.350\nSo, making sure we stay on top of that.\n\n173\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.630\nAnd that goes to another point,\nknowing what you have, right?\n\n174\n00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.940\nWe'll talk more about\nsomething called a site book,\n\n175\n00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.660\nwhich is the pot of gold\nat the end of the rainbow,\n\n176\n00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.720\nit's where everybody wishes they had but\nyou never get.\n\n177\n00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.430\nDocumentation for the entire network,\n\n178\n00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.740\nwe'll talk about that but\nthat is important.\n\n179\n00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.070\nBut going back to internal\nsecurity devices.\n\n180\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.140\nVendors update their definitions.\n\n181\n00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.080\nMake sure you're getting those.\n\n182\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.610\nReport malware incidents.\n\n183\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.640\nTalk to your vendors.\n\n184\n00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.090\nIf something gets through, something\ndoesn't get flagged or makes it in and\n\n185\n00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:49.720\nyou're running AV solutions and it gets by\nit or it gets by your IDS or IPS systems.\n\n186\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.500\nYou gotta deal with it, but\ndon't forget to notify the vendors.\n\n187\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.350\nSay hey look this happened.\n\n188\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.430\nThis is how we had it set up.\n\n189\n00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.700\nThey're either gonna let you know, well\nwe've got these rules you should of put in\n\n190\n00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.550\nplace, or this was configured wrong,\nor wow, that's something new.\n\n191\n00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.150\nLet's us take a look at it, and\n\n192\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.980\nnow they can incorporate that in their\ndefinitions and help everybody else out.\n\n193\n00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.480\nAll right, so by doing your part,\n\n194\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.680\nbeing an active part of the cyber security\ncommunity is extremely important.\n\n195\n00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.780\nI know I've harped on that\na few different times,\n\n196\n00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.150\ntalking about working with other\norganizations in your same industry.\n\n197\n00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.530\nWe've talked about languages,\nprotocols like and\n\n198\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:31.660\nMike being able to share this information\nbecause it takes a community effort.\n\n199\n00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.390\nAnd the bad guys\nare definitely a community.\n\n200\n00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.320\nThey're working together to attack us.\n\n201\n00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.440\nWe've got to work together to keep\nour networks and resources safe.\n\n202\n00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.140\nBut reporting malware signature,\nsharing new-found signatures,\n\n203\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.570\nyou might discover something\nthat hasn't been seen before.\n\n204\n00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.900\nStinks, yeah?\n\n205\n00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.880\nIt's not the best day in the world, but It\nhad to happen to somebody, unfortunately.\n\n206\n00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.650\nAnd now you need to do your part in making\nsure it doesn't happen to anybody else, or\n\n207\n00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.910\nas few people as possible.\n\n208\n00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.420\nCustom signatures,\nyou might write some really great IPS or\n\n209\n00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.750\nIDS rules that work really well.\n\n210\n00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:10.860\nShare them, let other people look at them,\nlet other people use them.\n\n211\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:16.470\nIt's not I get so\nangry when I read these blogs about\n\n212\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.180\npeople looking for, what was I researching\nthe other day, black lists and\n\n213\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.840\nwhite lists and somebody put a comment\nin a forum like does anybody know\n\n214\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.180\na place where I can get\na hold of a good blacklist.\n\n215\n00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.010\nAnd people respond with,\nwhy would any organization give you that?\n\n216\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.000\nThey've spent all their time and resources\ndeveloping this, develop your own.\n\n217\n00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.530\nThat's not the right attitude to have,\nright?\n\n218\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.595\nWe wanna work together.\n\n219\n00:11:42.595 --> 00:11:45.695\nIt's just gonna make for better, and\nI know, I sound like I'm up on a soapbox,\n\n220\n00:11:45.695 --> 00:11:48.095\nand we're all gonna sing kumbayah or\nsomething.\n\n221\n00:11:48.095 --> 00:11:51.965\nBut it is an important part of all this.\n\n222\n00:11:51.965 --> 00:11:52.925\n&gt;&gt; Can I get my guitar?\n\n223\n00:11:52.925 --> 00:11:53.785\n&gt;&gt; Yes, please.\n\n224\n00:11:53.785 --> 00:11:54.540\n&gt;&gt; Be right back.\n\n225\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.755\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've got my drum.\n\n226\n00:11:55.755 --> 00:11:58.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll go to town.\n\n227\n00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.140\nWell so custom signatures.\n\n228\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.540\nYeah others can use them.\n\n229\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.810\nOthers might even help you fix them or\nimprove them.\n\n230\n00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.670\nYou might think you have a pretty\ngood rule and somebody else\n\n231\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.180\nmight look at it and go wow, if you added\nthis, look what else you can catch, right.\n\n232\n00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.750\nSo this the advantage of the big\nperks of sharing, is you're\n\n233\n00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.650\nsharing information that you have but\nyou're gonna get it back, hopefully.\n\n234\n00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.210\nAnd that's gonna make this all better.\n\n235\n00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.500\nBlock external sources of Malware.\n\n236\n00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.430\nThere are known bad sites.\n\n237\n00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.340\nThere are places that that's what they do,\nthey infect people.\n\n238\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.630\nThere's websites set up and then you've\ngot all these phishing scams and\n\n239\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.280\nthings like that that try to\nredirect you to these servers.\n\n240\n00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.390\nWell, if those servers are known, because\ncompanies have been infected by it.\n\n241\n00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.600\nThey've seen the log files.\n\n242\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.550\nThey've seen the IP addresses that\ntheir computers reach out and\n\n243\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:54.450\nwe're infected with malware from\nwe need to log those, right or\n\n244\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:59.720\ndo your research,\nfind these sites and block them.\n\n245\n00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.690\nIf you had an attack in your system,\nyou've done your research on your\n\n246\n00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.740\nincident, you see where\nthe attack came from, block that.\n\n247\n00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.770\nSo not more of your employees go out and\nget infected.\n\n248\n00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.290\nData is filtering is one of\nthe tools we can use to do this.\n\n249\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:19.180\nAnd when we say block known malware sites,\nwell how do I do that?\n\n250\n00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.310\nI don't walk around all my employees or\npass out a list hey don't go to this site,\n\n251\n00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.560\nand don't go to this site,\nwe prevent them from.\n\n252\n00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.020\nWe use DNS.\n\n253\n00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.920\nAnd so, when they try to resolve that\nname, their computer sends it back to\n\n254\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.960\ntheir own IP address, 1270001 or\nit gives them an error that says this site\n\n255\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.850\nis known to spread malware,\nit has been blocked by our organization,\n\n256\n00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.150\ndo not go there and\nwe don't allow them to even get there.\n\n257\n00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:50.270\nSo restrict what kind of look up requests\nare actually validated by your DNS server.\n\n258\n00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.820\nGive them that block message.\n\n259\n00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.490\nThat's one thing I will say\nthat drives me crazy too,\n\n260\n00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.360\nis if you're gonna do that,\nmake sure you have a message set up.\n\n261\n00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.930\nIt's like, don't block it and\njust give them the spinning Cheerio and\n\n262\n00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.550\nthen it comes up with a page not found and\n\n263\n00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.770\nall they're gonna do is try\nharder to get to that site.\n\n264\n00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.650\nOr they're gonna go to another machine,\nand get to that site, or.\n\n265\n00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.800\n&gt;&gt; Probably generate some help desk calls,\ngoing, I'm trying to get to this site.\n\n266\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.505\nAnd then they go, yeah,\nyou can't go there.\n\n267\n00:14:14.505 --> 00:14:15.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n268\n00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.110\nAnd one of your machines is\ngonna be misconfigured for DNS.\n\n269\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.200\nAnd it's actually gonna get there.\n\n270\n00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.690\nHe's like, Hey Bob,\ntry this site, I can't get there.\n\n271\n00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.250\nI got there just fine.\n\n272\n00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.730\nWait my screen just flipped.\n\n273\n00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.453\nNo, wait, yeah now we're infected.\n\n274\n00:14:27.453 --> 00:14:31.709\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Using DNS to give them\n\n275\n00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:35.910\na message of some kind at\nleast to let them know hey,\n\n276\n00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:40.530\nthis is blocked for\na reason during an incident.\n\n277\n00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.280\nIf we're investigating an incident,\nand I'm pulling information,\n\n278\n00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.410\nI'm gathering up all of my indicators\nfrom my different sources.\n\n279\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.330\nAnd I see IP addresses outside that\nthese machines are reaching out to, and\n\n280\n00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:57.810\nit looks like that's where the malware's\nbeing downloaded from immediately go and\n\n281\n00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.900\nblock those on your DNS server.\n\n282\n00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.770\nWe wanna contain, we wanna prevent\nother machines from reaching out,\n\n283\n00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.890\nthey could be spreading\nthat internally and\n\n284\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:12.050\nnow all these machines are trying to\ncall that home, block it, prevent that.\n\n285\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.310\nEasy to apply, I mean honestly it's\nnot that difficult to go into DNS and\n\n286\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.370\ncreate these rules.\n\n287\n00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:22.100\nKeep in mind it won't\nremove the infection but\n\n288\n00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.630\nit will help you contain the infection.\n\n289\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.750\nThere is a downside, or not a downside,\nbut there is a limitation.\n\n290\n00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.690\nIt's not the silver bullet.\n\n291\n00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.970\nIt's not gonna keep my\nnetwork impenetrable.\n\n292\n00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.010\nThink about what we're doing.\n\n293\n00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.770\nWe're using DNS to prevent\nthem from resolving\n\n294\n00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.470\nthese names of known bad places\ninto these IP addresses.\n\n295\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.148\nWhat if they're not using your DNS server?\n\n296\n00:15:45.148 --> 00:15:48.202\nWell, then your rules aren't\ngoing to do anything are they?\n\n297\n00:15:48.202 --> 00:15:53.416\nSo if you have users that\nare semi-educated in how this stuff works.\n\n298\n00:15:53.416 --> 00:15:57.907\nThey might change their IP address\nof their DNS server that they're\n\n299\n00:15:57.907 --> 00:15:59.730\nconfigured to use.\n\n300\n00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:04.390\nMalware, sometimes,\nwe can limit bots have to reach out, and\n\n301\n00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.930\ntalk to their controller to know when to\nlaunch the attack, and what to do next.\n\n302\n00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.202\nIf we can block that,\n\n303\n00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:14.900\nthen we can prevent those bots from\ndoing what they're supposed to do.\n\n304\n00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.729\nWe'll do something called\nblack hole routing or\n\n305\n00:16:17.729 --> 00:16:22.559\nsink hole routing, where known bad sites\nare just routed to a null zero interface,\n\n306\n00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:26.786\nin a null interface, and then it go\nanywhere, they just silently drop.\n\n307\n00:16:26.786 --> 00:16:29.932\nAnd the other end doesn't even\nnotified that this is happening but\n\n308\n00:16:29.932 --> 00:16:33.120\nthe bots can't reach out and\ntalk to their controller.\n\n309\n00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.765\nWorks great unless the bots\nare hard-coded with the DNS server, right?\n\n310\n00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:41.079\nIf they're DHCP, and they're getting\ninformation from your organization, and\n\n311\n00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:44.290\nthey're gonna be pointed to your\nDNS servers, that's fantastic.\n\n312\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:49.164\nBut if the bad guy hard-coded a DNS server\nto use in their bot, then it's not gonna\n\n313\n00:16:49.164 --> 00:16:53.987\ndo anything, so just keep that in mind,\nit's not a silver bullet for anything.\n\n314\n00:16:53.987 --> 00:16:56.515\nI've used the terms blacklisting, and\n\n315\n00:16:56.515 --> 00:17:00.760\nI should mention the term whitelisting\ncuz they kinda go together.\n\n316\n00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:08.520\nBlacklisting is when we are setting\nup a list of known bad sites, right?\n\n317\n00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.460\nSo we know these sites are bad either\nthrough research we've done from\n\n318\n00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.930\nother organizations, or from our own\nmisfortune in dealing with them.\n\n319\n00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.310\nWe can then turnaround and\nwe can block those using blacklists,\n\n320\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.730\nuseful in responding to malware threats.\n\n321\n00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:30.840\nOne of the things you wanna be careful\nwith blacklists, they are susceptible to\n\n322\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:36.240\nfalse positives, especially if we get\na little too broad with our blacklists.\n\n323\n00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.720\nWe might try to say this entire subnet is\nbad but there might be some legitimate,\n\n324\n00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.520\nespecially when you're dealing with public\naddresses, and you're not exactly sure how\n\n325\n00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:51.000\nthese organizations or the registrars\nhave leased out these addresses.\n\n326\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.970\nYou can't say the whole class just\nbecause the IP address of the infection\n\n327\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:00.050\nwas a Class B address, I can't say that\nentire Class B subnet's bad, right?\n\n328\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.970\nI don't wanna block that whole thing\nbecause I don't know, there could be\n\n329\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.720\nvaluable resources or resources I\nneed to get to on that same IP range.\n\n330\n00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.520\nSo do be careful with that, so\nthat's what we call collateral damage.\n\n331\n00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.473\nYou end up trying to block a range of\naddress and then, all of a sudden,\n\n332\n00:18:14.473 --> 00:18:18.906\nmy users can't get to legitimate resources\nthat they used to be able to get to.\n\n333\n00:18:18.906 --> 00:18:22.270\nAnd what you don't know\ncan still hurt you, right?\n\n334\n00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.670\nThe thing about blacklists is you're\ntaking all the stuff you know\n\n335\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.010\nthat's bad and putting it on there.\n\n336\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.220\nBut do you know everything that's bad?\n\n337\n00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.580\nYou don't, you can't, most likely.\n\n338\n00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.660\nSo, it's a constant updated thing.\n\n339\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.370\nWe have to keep putting our research in,\nwe have to keep adding to our blacklist.\n\n340\n00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.410\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, for those times\nwhen things have gotten so bad,\n\n341\n00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:49.120\nit's easier to create a list of good\nthings, [LAUGH] cuz it's a smaller list.\n\n342\n00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.835\nThat's when we have whitelisting,\nright, it's basically the opposite.\n\n343\n00:18:50.835 --> 00:18:53.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly right, and\nthat's just as Daniel said,\n\n344\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.650\nit's just the opposite approach.\n\n345\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.920\nInstead of trying to say,\neverything's good,\n\n346\n00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.520\nand I'm gonna specify what's bad,\nwe're gonna say, everything is bad,\n\n347\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.130\neverything is bad, except for this,\nand this, and this, and this, right?\n\n348\n00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.670\nAnd it can keep you much,\nmuch safer, right?\n\n349\n00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.900\nBecause now if we don't know about it,\n\n350\n00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.900\nif it's not on the list\nyou're not getting there.\n\n351\n00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.140\nOnly the things we've added to\nthis list are going to be allowed,\n\n352\n00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.160\nthat is whitelisting.\n\n353\n00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.431\n&gt;&gt; So, I guess a good way to think about\nit when it comes to blacklisting versus\n\n354\n00:19:21.431 --> 00:19:22.279\nwhitelisting.\n\n355\n00:19:22.279 --> 00:19:26.455\nBlacklisting is an implicit allow\nwith an explicit deny, right,\n\n356\n00:19:26.455 --> 00:19:29.436\nand then whitelisting,\nthe opposite of that,\n\n357\n00:19:29.436 --> 00:19:32.880\nis going to be an implicit\ndeny with an explicit allow.\n\n358\n00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n359\n00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:34.410\n&gt;&gt; So that's a good way to think about it.\n\n360\n00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:39.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, exactly right, and\nit's a lot of work trying to come up\n\n361\n00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:44.049\nwith all the known bad sites, or trying to\nmaintain that whitelist because you're,\n\n362\n00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:46.420\nas soon as you put it in place,\nthe phone starts ringing.\n\n363\n00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.310\nHey, we can no longer do this,\nwe can no longer do that.\n\n364\n00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.080\nThis application is no longer working,\nwhat's going on?\n\n365\n00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.190\nAnd they're just things\nyou didn't think about.\n\n366\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.930\nThat application has a dashboard, it has\nto reach out and talk to this public\n\n367\n00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:01.560\nserver to populate that information,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n368\n00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.462\nSo now, it's just a constant\nadding to that whitelist.\n\n369\n00:20:05.462 --> 00:20:07.930\nNow eventually, right,\nyou'll get to the point where,\n\n370\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:11.900\nokay, we seem to be pretty good,\nwe're not having any more issues.\n\n371\n00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.810\nJust about everything we need\nis now on that whitelist, and\n\n372\n00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.340\nnow it's just gonna be new things that pop\nup I'm gonna need to add to the whitelist.\n\n373\n00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:23.000\nWhitelists are usually used in highly\nsecure environments where I've just have\n\n374\n00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.600\nto make sure that you're\nonly going to known,\n\n375\n00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.900\ngood or authorized sites or resources.\n\n376\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:36.720\nCan be very restrictive,\nconstantly needing fine-tuning on that,\n\n377\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.912\nwhat else, so yeah, that's whitelisting.\n\n378\n00:20:39.912 --> 00:20:44.434\nBlack hole routing, I mentioned that term\nearlier, yeah, this is when we set up\n\n379\n00:20:44.434 --> 00:20:48.500\nbasically a black hole or sink hole\ndepending on what you wannna call it.\n\n380\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.130\nDrop traffic before it reaches out,\nand talks to its destination.\n\n381\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.190\nSo, we might have as I was\nusing an example of a botnet,\n\n382\n00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.710\nyou've got maybe your system got infected,\nbots were loaded up on them,\n\n383\n00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.950\nzombies, whatever you\nwanna call those guys.\n\n384\n00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.770\nAnd they're supposed to reach out and\ntalk to their IRC channel, waiting for\n\n385\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:04.740\ntheir commands.\n\n386\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.390\nIf they can't, then they're just gonna\nsit there and not do anything, and\n\n387\n00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:09.130\nthat's a good thing.\n\n388\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:16.450\nSo, it's a little less overhead as well\nthan some of our filtering techniques.\n\n389\n00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.050\nBecause with the filtering,\nwith whitelisting,\n\n390\n00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.350\nwith blacklisting, things like that,\nI've gotta inspect the packet,\n\n391\n00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.190\nI've gotta look at that source and\ndestination.\n\n392\n00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:28.240\nSometimes I have to take a deeper\nlook into the content of the packet\n\n393\n00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:33.090\nwhich can be a little more\nresource-intensive than just\n\n394\n00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.080\nblackholing everything where\nthe router just drops it.\n\n395\n00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.270\nIt sees the destination, and\nthat's all it has to worry about.\n\n396\n00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:43.870\nBut it is another thing, again,\nthat's going to require fine-tuning.\n\n397\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.820\nAnd we have to be really careful when\nwe're doing entire ranges because we can\n\n398\n00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.550\nend up getting that\ncollateral damage again, and\n\n399\n00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.620\nblocking sites that should be allowed.\n\n400\n00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.040\nSystem and\napplication isolation is another\n\n401\n00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.670\nmitigation technique that we\nneed to be familiar with.\n\n402\n00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.150\nWe need to understand that\nwhen we have an incident, or\n\n403\n00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.620\na potential breach, we wanna isolate\nthe system as quickly as possible,\n\n404\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.130\nremove it from the network,\nprevent the spread, right?\n\n405\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:14.720\nIt's funny cuz you think about terms like\nviruses, and it's very similar to what\n\n406\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.110\nwe do with humans, right, and\nthe way the human viruses spread.\n\n407\n00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.750\nBut if somebody is sick like that,\nwhat do you do?\n\n408\n00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.690\nYou isolate them, you prevent them\nfrom spreading that to other people.\n\n409\n00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.250\nYou try to get them better,\nyou try to remove the virus.\n\n410\n00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.660\nBut one of the first things you\ndo is try to prevent the spread.\n\n411\n00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.600\n&gt;&gt; You look for the little monkey that\ninfected them with a cool suit on that has\n\n412\n00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.160\na ventilator and everything, it's awesome.\n\n413\n00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.800\n&gt;&gt; I've seen that video,\nyeah, that's a good one.\n\n414\n00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.813\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n415\n00:22:37.813 --> 00:22:40.011\nwe don't want an outbreak of viruses,\nright?\n\n416\n00:22:40.011 --> 00:22:47.180\nBut we can isolate systems using VLANs,\nif we need to.\n\n417\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.620\nWe can use VMs to isolate applications,\nand figure out what's going on, and\n\n418\n00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.100\nprevent that VM from talking to the rest\nof the network, so we can contain it, and\n\n419\n00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.230\nwe can do our analysis if we need to.\n\n420\n00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.990\nWhen it comes to mitigation techniques,\nagain, same concept.\n\n421\n00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.226\nIf we talk about isolation,\nby isolating targets,\n\n422\n00:23:06.226 --> 00:23:09.691\nright, we can, if they are compromised,\n\n423\n00:23:09.691 --> 00:23:14.720\nmaybe contain that within that\nisolated part of our network.\n\n424\n00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.413\nTypically, like I said, using VLANs,\n\n425\n00:23:17.413 --> 00:23:23.039\nagain we had this conversation I know this\nmorning, we were talking about subnets,\n\n426\n00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:27.810\nrouters, switches, VLANs, and\nhow we could use these to segregate.\n\n427\n00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.320\nAnd what we've gotta keep in mind is\nsubnets on their own really are no\n\n428\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.595\nform of security on their own.\n\n429\n00:23:34.595 --> 00:23:37.665\nBut rules that we create on the router\nthat control the traffic that flows\n\n430\n00:23:37.665 --> 00:23:39.893\nbetween the subnets,\nthat's what adds security.\n\n431\n00:23:39.893 --> 00:23:43.511\nSubnetting on its own doesn't really add\nany security because the router knows\n\n432\n00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:44.759\nhow to get to both subnets.\n\n433\n00:23:44.759 --> 00:23:49.289\nIt'll just take that traffic and\nforward it right through, you're limiting\n\n434\n00:23:49.289 --> 00:23:53.830\nbroadcast traffic but That's not what\nwe're trying to do, VLAN same thing.\n\n435\n00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.755\nIt can help us isolate that traffic,\n\n436\n00:23:57.755 --> 00:24:03.860\nprevent subnet from\ntalking to another subnet.\n\n437\n00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.195\nWhat else?\nMobile device management,\n\n438\n00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:11.203\nbig part of our job today when\nit comes to mitigating, and\n\n439\n00:24:11.203 --> 00:24:14.726\ntrying to protect against attacks and\nbreaches.\n\n440\n00:24:14.726 --> 00:24:19.136\nWe've gotta have a plan for our mobile\ndevices, because unless your organization\n\n441\n00:24:19.136 --> 00:24:23.168\njust doesn't allow them, and you have\na search as you come in the building.\n\n442\n00:24:23.168 --> 00:24:26.400\nMost likely you've got mobile\ndevices on your network,\n\n443\n00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.122\nwhether they're part of\nyour company's plan or not.\n\n444\n00:24:30.122 --> 00:24:31.555\nThey're gonna be attaching\nto your network,\n\n445\n00:24:31.555 --> 00:24:36.110\nthey're going to be potentially doing\nwork from or contain work data.\n\n446\n00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.130\nSo we've gotta have a plan of action for\nthese.\n\n447\n00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.900\nTypically when we look at\nwhat they call MDM systems,\n\n448\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.510\nmobile device management systems.\n\n449\n00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.190\nThere are certain things\nthat we wanna make sure\n\n450\n00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.610\nthat this management system can do.\n\n451\n00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:51.050\nAt a minimum, I need to make sure\nthat we've got device enrollment and\n\n452\n00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:52.100\nauthentication.\n\n453\n00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:56.745\nThat I can verify the identity of these\ndevices and if they're not identified,\n\n454\n00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:58.490\nthen they don't get access.\n\n455\n00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.080\nOr they're prevented or limited, at least,\nin what they're allowed to access.\n\n456\n00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.580\nSo making sure we can enroll these\ndevices, validate their identity.\n\n457\n00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.680\nRemote locks and wipes,\n\n458\n00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.350\nanother big part of MDM is being able\nto do that, cuz it's gonna happen.\n\n459\n00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.390\nOne of your employees is gonna leave\nthat phone in the back of the cab, or\n\n460\n00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.660\nat the counter at the restaurant, or\nin the bathroom, or what have you.\n\n461\n00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.420\nIt's gonna get lost,\nit's gonna get stolen.\n\n462\n00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.500\nOn that phone is company information,\nnow what do we do, right?\n\n463\n00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.970\nWell, we should be able to reach out and\nwipe that phone.\n\n464\n00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.430\nAnd that way, who ever stole it,\n\n465\n00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:39.720\nif they do get access to it,\nthey're not gonna get company information.\n\n466\n00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.111\nThey're not gonna be able\nto VPM back in the network,\n\n467\n00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:44.926\ncuz how many of you have mobile\ndevices that you've set up RDP or\n\n468\n00:25:44.926 --> 00:25:48.050\nsome sort of VPN software so\nthat you can reach back into work?\n\n469\n00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.280\nBecause you know you're gonna get a call\nafter hours, and on your day off, and\n\n470\n00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.850\nmany times I don't have to go\ninto the network physically,\n\n471\n00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.470\nI can do it from a remote location.\n\n472\n00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.940\nI can be out on the golf course and\nI can remote in and\n\n473\n00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.860\ntake a look at what the system is doing.\n\n474\n00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.750\nThat means if somebody steals it and\nthey get access to my phone,\n\n475\n00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.030\nthey can very well click the icon and\ngain access to the system, right?\n\n476\n00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.070\nSo being able to reach out and\n\n477\n00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:12.280\nwipe those devices, most of these systems\nnow can segregate personal and work.\n\n478\n00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.070\nSo that when you do reach out, let's\nsay you've got an employee that leaves\n\n479\n00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.490\nthe organization, not just a stolen phone,\nbut Daniel leaves.\n\n480\n00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:22.676\nHe's taken his phone with him, it was his\nphone, but he was doing work with it.\n\n481\n00:26:22.676 --> 00:26:27.250\nI wanna wipe it, but I can't wipe his\nentire phone because he might get\n\n482\n00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.790\na little upset with that, and there could\nbe some liability to my organization for\n\n483\n00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.330\nwiping his personal information.\n\n484\n00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.370\nHe's already mad that we've let him go and\nnow we wiped his phone,\n\n485\n00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:36.250\nwhat are you gonna do, Daniel?\n\n486\n00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.650\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't be too thrilled with that,\nI'll be honest with you.\n\n487\n00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:44.540\nBut when you get a little thing that\nsays do you agree that these people,\n\n488\n00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.490\nbecause you're attaching to their network,\nthey can wipe your phone.\n\n489\n00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.660\nAnd you have to say yes, and\nit'd be an interesting court battle,\n\n490\n00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.750\nI gotta be honest with you.\n\n491\n00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.815\nBut I'd probably be up here with\nbuckets of gas and matches going.\n\n492\n00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:57.327\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n493\n00:26:57.327 --> 00:26:59.260\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna burn you out,\n\n494\n00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.935\nyou done wiped my phone too.\n\n495\n00:27:00.935 --> 00:27:03.925\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was thinking,\nI would never, I know Daniel's armed and\n\n496\n00:27:03.925 --> 00:27:04.904\nI'm not going to.\n\n497\n00:27:04.904 --> 00:27:07.146\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n498\n00:27:07.146 --> 00:27:10.155\n&gt;&gt; You see the guns on this guy over here.\n\n499\n00:27:10.155 --> 00:27:11.995\nSo, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; It's the guns you don't see, Mike.\n\n500\n00:27:11.995 --> 00:27:15.990\n&gt;&gt; That is right, yeah, the guns I\ndon't see, exactly, all right, so\n\n501\n00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:21.190\nlooking at devices through GPS,\nmany phones support this now.\n\n502\n00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:24.080\nWe can get usually pretty darn close,\nthey're pretty accurate.\n\n503\n00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.540\nI remember when these first came out,\nit kinda gave you a proximity.\n\n504\n00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:30.258\nBut, I remember somebody was trying to\nfind their phone in their house, and\n\n505\n00:27:30.258 --> 00:27:32.470\nit It's like,\nit's not quite that accurate.\n\n506\n00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:35.540\nIt'll show you your house but it's not\ngonna tell you it's in the bedroom.\n\n507\n00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.480\nBut they're getting better, but\nmaybe we can use that as an organization,\n\n508\n00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.310\nif somebody comes to me and\n\n509\n00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.890\nsays, hey I've, I can't locate my\nphone I think I left it in a cab.\n\n510\n00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.004\nWe've called the cab company, they say\nsay there's no sign of it in there.\n\n511\n00:27:47.004 --> 00:27:50.595\nWell, Ken do I have a website that I can\npull up and I can ping your phone, and\n\n512\n00:27:50.595 --> 00:27:51.398\nsee where it is?\n\n513\n00:27:51.398 --> 00:27:54.410\nAnd maybe go locate it?\n\n514\n00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:58.357\nThe ability to push out updates,\nour users might not be as thorough or\n\n515\n00:27:58.357 --> 00:28:02.780\nas consistent as we'd like when it comes\nto keeping their device up to date.\n\n516\n00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.130\nCan we push updates out to that device?\n\n517\n00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.242\nMicrosoft Intune and\n\n518\n00:28:07.242 --> 00:28:11.193\nthings like this allow you to do this\nkinda thing, well if it's running on,\n\n519\n00:28:11.193 --> 00:28:15.720\neven if it's not running Microsoft OS,\nthey've got some tools for that.\n\n520\n00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.820\nPreventing root access, all right,\nespecially on your Android systems,\n\n521\n00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:19.890\nthings like that.\n\n522\n00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.300\nCan I limit what that user\nhas access to on that phone?\n\n523\n00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:28.210\nThat's a tough one, it depends if\nit's a company issued device or not.\n\n524\n00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.490\nI would have a hard time with\nan organization saying hey,\n\n525\n00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:35.230\nwe know that's your phone, but we're gonna\ntake away your root access on that phone.\n\n526\n00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:40.000\nYeah, probably not gonna go over to well,\nbut if it's a company issued device,\n\n527\n00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.100\nwell, then,\nthere's not a lot I can do about that.\n\n528\n00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:48.222\nConstructing encrypted containers,\nmany devices nowadays allow us to, if not\n\n529\n00:28:48.222 --> 00:28:53.360\nencrypt the entire device, at least create\npart of the storage to be encrypted.\n\n530\n00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.790\nAnd we can make sure that any work\nrelated stuff is going in to there.\n\n531\n00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.720\nAnd that way, again,\n\n532\n00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.270\nif somebody gets that device maybe we can\nkeep them from gaining access to that.\n\n533\n00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.950\nRestricting features possibly\non these devices, so\n\n534\n00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:09.100\nlots of things we can do with\nMobile Device Management.\n\n535\n00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.380\nApplication whitelisting is\nanother thing that we can do.\n\n536\n00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.900\nI know, Daniel, we're getting ready to run\nout of time here, I'll wrap up with this,\n\n537\n00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.370\napplication whitelisting is\njust like DNS whitelisting.\n\n538\n00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.050\nIf we have applications that\nare known good, we can allow them.\n\n539\n00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:28.360\nOther applications do not get installed\non those mobile devices, right.\n\n540\n00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.700\nI don't want you installing these games,\nand this and that and the other.\n\n541\n00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.270\nOnly stuff that's work related or\napproved,\n\n542\n00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.770\nat least,\nshould be allowed to go on those devices.\n\n543\n00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.689\nSo that's one thing about\napplication whitelisting,\n\n544\n00:29:39.689 --> 00:29:41.416\nand that's not just mobile devices,\nactually.\n\n545\n00:29:41.416 --> 00:29:46.412\nThat could be on your desktops,\nyour laptops, those are well.\n\n546\n00:29:46.412 --> 00:29:50.920\nWe've all got the Windows Store,\nthe Apple stuff,\n\n547\n00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.420\nthe Google stuff,\nwe wanna control what apps.\n\n548\n00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:58.590\nBecause those organizations\nreally do try to do a good job\n\n549\n00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:02.040\nof vetting those applications\nbefore they're in their stores,\n\n550\n00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.130\nbecause it's their reputation\nthat they're protecting.\n\n551\n00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:10.070\nThey don't want you downloading an app,\nand then your device becoming compromised,\n\n552\n00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.220\nand starting to talk to you or whatever.\n\n553\n00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.565\nAnd you're gonna blame it on them,\nthey don't want that reputation either so\n\n554\n00:30:15.565 --> 00:30:17.621\nthey do what they can,\nthey can't catch everything.\n\n555\n00:30:17.621 --> 00:30:22.555\nIt's obvious we have had cases where apps,\nbad apps have slipped through the cracks,\n\n556\n00:30:22.555 --> 00:30:23.245\nand gone out.\n\n557\n00:30:23.245 --> 00:30:28.135\nBut as an organization maybe we\nwant to prevent them from even\n\n558\n00:30:28.135 --> 00:30:31.495\ngoing to those stores or at least saying\nthese are the only apps you can install.\n\n559\n00:30:31.495 --> 00:30:34.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's definitely\nthe way of the future people,\n\n560\n00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:38.450\nwe don't want you downloading things\nthat would be potentially harmful or\n\n561\n00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:42.730\nexposing of your device or\nto our organization through your device.\n\n562\n00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:46.370\nSo that's just one of the things that you\ngotta get used to in this day and age.\n\n563\n00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.700\nMike, I know we got, like you said,\na few more things to go down.\n\n564\n00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:55.320\nWe'll have to make a small part\ntwo to round out this very topic.\n\n565\n00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.760\nBut Mike, thanks for joining us here\non part one, thank you guys for\n\n566\n00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.990\nwatching us as well.\n\n567\n00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.950\nHope to see you in that part two, as for\nthis one, though, we're signing off.\n\n568\n00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.190\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n569\n00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.988\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n570\n00:31:04.988 --> 00:31:07.763\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n571\n00:31:07.763 --> 00:31:13.561\n[MUSIC]\n\n572\n00:31:13.561 --> 00:31:18.050\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",
