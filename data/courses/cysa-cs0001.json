us is Daniel Lowrie, and\nwe're talking about CySA+.\n\n4\n00:00:11.238 --> 00:00:12.785\nDaniel, can you tell us what\nthis course is all about?\n\n5\n00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:13.970\n&gt;&gt; I sure can.\n\n6\n00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.216\nToday, we're gonna talk about CySA+, which\nis the CompTIA's cybersecurity analyst\n\n7\n00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:24.290\nplus certification, and it is\na certification based around security,\n\n8\n00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.200\nright, because it's part of\ncybersecurity analyst, right,\n\n9\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.040\nand we're going to talk about a lot of\ninteresting things when it comes to that.\n\n10\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.316\nIt gives you a couple of domains\nthat are inside of that,\n\n11\n00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:37.989\nthat reasearch out to things like\nincident response, and threat management,\n\n12\n00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.731\nand being able to analyze and work with\nthe different type of security issues that\n\n13\n00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:45.685\nyou might encounter as\na cybersecurity analyst.\n\n14\n00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:49.479\nI wanna cover that from soup to nuts,\nand that's what they attempt to do with\n\n15\n00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:50.360\nthe CySA+.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n16\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.660\nwho is this show targeted towards?\n&gt;&gt; This show is targeted toward people\n\n17\n00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.310\nthat actually have some experience\nwith systems administration,\n\n18\n00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.510\nnetwork administration.\n\n19\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.077\nIt is not for\nthe brand spanking new green horn out\n\n20\n00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:06.084\nthere that just gotten past\ntheir A+ certification.\n\n21\n00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:10.746\nYou must have a bit of experience with\nsome security working with different\n\n22\n00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:15.565\nnetworking tools, operating system tools,\nhave some familiarity there.\n\n23\n00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:20.568\nSo you do have to have some experience\nin the field, not required per say,\n\n24\n00:01:20.568 --> 00:01:26.139\nif you were motivated, you could probably\nstudy all of these different things and\n\n25\n00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:28.963\npass the exam, but it sure does help, and\n\n26\n00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:33.888\nit is geared toward people that have\nbeen out there working in the field as\n\n27\n00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:38.490\na system and/or network administrator,\nmaybe even some security\n\n28\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.656\nresponsibilities as well to go along\nwith that, and then to prove that set of\n\n29\n00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:46.656\nknowledge you go and you take the CySA+.\n&gt;&gt; All\n\n30\n00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:49.364\nright, so I was just going to say, is\nthere a certification involved with this\n\n31\n00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:49.998\nexam?\n&gt;&gt; There is.\n\n32\n00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:51.550\nThis is no tech skill.\n\n33\n00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.460\nThis is an actual cert, and\nyou will get a lovely minted piece of\n\n34\n00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.460\npaper that has your name on it, says\nthat you have passed successfully, and\n\n35\n00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.290\nyou are certified in these\ntechnologies and techniques.\n\n36\n00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.861\nIf we want to,\nwe can actually go to CompTIA's website,\n\n37\n00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:10.235\nwhich I've already pulled up on my\ncomputer, so we can take a look at some of\n\n38\n00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:12.772\nthe details that they give for\nus about the exam itself.\n\n39\n00:02:12.772 --> 00:02:13.570\nSo, let's check that out.\n\n40\n00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.659\nLet's go to my computer,\nhere is the opening page, and\n\n41\n00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.799\nall you had to do is go to\ncertification.comptia.org/certifications/-\n\n42\n00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.489\ncybersecurityanalystoverview, and\nthere we are right there,\n\n43\n00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.396\nwell I guess you can read that,\nthat's just cybersecurityanalyst.\n\n44\n00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:31.573\nOnce we get there we get plenty\nof information about this, giving\n\n45\n00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:35.557\nthe overview, which is right here, why is\nit different, it does have this little\n\n46\n00:02:35.557 --> 00:02:39.646\nblurb about the CySA+, so if you were\nstudying for CySA+, this is the same exam.\n\n47\n00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:43.071\nThey've had some legal issues that\nthey've had to rename and rebrand.\n\n48\n00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:44.080\nNot a big deal.\n\n49\n00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.100\nIt's just the same product,\na different coat of paint, right?\n\n50\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.865\nSo a different name on it, not a big deal.\n\n51\n00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:51.790\nAsked why is it's different, the\ndifference is the only intermediate high\n\n52\n00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.370\nstakes cybersecurity analyst\ncertification with performance-based\n\n53\n00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.080\nquestions covering security analytics,\nintrusion detection, and response.\n\n54\n00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.850\nHigh stakes exam are proctored by\nPearson VUE, that's an interesting thing,\n\n55\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.710\na little factoid you need to know.\n\n56\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.928\nSo if you want to sign up for the exam\nyou'll be taking it through Pearson VUE.\n\n57\n00:03:10.928 --> 00:03:15.550\nThat's where you'll have to go to\nactually get signed up, all right?\n\n58\n00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.578\nThe testing centers and\n\n59\n00:03:16.578 --> 00:03:20.119\nthe CySA+ is the is the most up to date\nsecurity analyst certification that covers\n\n60\n00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:23.684\nadvanced persistent threats in\na post-2014 server security environment.\n\n61\n00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:27.484\nThere's their rundown, giving us more\ninformation about the exam, some\n\n62\n00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:32.144\ncertification pathways, this is actually a\nreally interesting infographic right here.\n\n63\n00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:35.950\nSo, it's telling you about\ncore skills certification.\n\n64\n00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.709\nHere we start off with IT fundamentals,\nmoving on to A+, and then to Network+,\n\n65\n00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.217\nand to Security+, to show you where this\nfalls in line in the pathway to CASP,\n\n66\n00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:52.657\nwhich is advanced, and then probably\non to something like CISSP after that.\n\n67\n00:03:52.657 --> 00:03:58.716\nBut here you see in the intermediate\nscope you have PenTest+ and CySA+.\n\n68\n00:03:58.716 --> 00:04:02.759\nSo where PenTest+ is geared toward\nthings like red teaming and attack,\n\n69\n00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:07.329\ntrying to PenTesters, that's where they\nwill wanna go if you were on the blue team\n\n70\n00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.906\ndefender systems,\nthat's what you would want that CySA+, so\n\n71\n00:04:10.906 --> 00:04:14.172\nthat's where we're looking\nto get into cybersecurity.\n\n72\n00:04:14.172 --> 00:04:17.423\nAs a defender,\nI need to be able to short my systems, so\n\n73\n00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:20.252\nCySA+ is a great exam for\nthat test the skills or\n\n74\n00:04:20.252 --> 00:04:24.240\nlearn new skills that you need to\nknow be successful in that arena.\n\n75\n00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.923\nLet's go ahead and zoom back out,\nand we'll keep scrolling down.\n\n76\n00:04:27.923 --> 00:04:29.040\nWhat skills will you learn?\n\n77\n00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.996\nThreat management.\n\n78\n00:04:29.996 --> 00:04:30.599\nAll right.\n\n79\n00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.253\nApply environment reconnaissance\ntechniques using appropriate tools,\n\n80\n00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:37.446\nanalyzing results, and\nimplementing recommended responses.\n\n81\n00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:38.990\nWe have vulnerability management.\n\n82\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.870\nImplement vulnerability\nmanagement processes and\n\n83\n00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.085\nanalyze the results of vulnerability scan,\nsecure architecture and\n\n84\n00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:49.770\ntoolsets, these are the different\nthings that we are going to do and\n\n85\n00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.546\nemploy to make sure that our systems are\nsecure, even working through the software\n\n86\n00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:58.640\ndevelopment lifecycle, well I'm going\nto secure coding best practices.\n\n87\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.266\nCyber incident responses is if\nthe worst does happen how do we handle\n\n88\n00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:03.166\nthe situation?\n\n89\n00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:05.504\nThey want to make sure that\nyou're prepared for that, so\n\n90\n00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:08.530\nthey add cyber incident response as\none of the skills that you will learn.\n\n91\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.670\nAll right, then some of the organizations\nthat contribute to the development of\n\n92\n00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.820\nCySA, Northrop Grumman,\nRicoh, which makes printers.\n\n93\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.853\nTarget, I'm sure that they were quick to\njump on the bandwagon after their data\n\n94\n00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:24.522\nbreach, to say, you know what,\ncybersecurity is an important thing,\n\n95\n00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:28.217\nwe should probably do something with that,\nand of course, Dell, LPI.\n\n96\n00:05:28.217 --> 00:05:32.570\nJobs that use CompTIA,\nCySA+: IT Security Analyst.\n\n97\n00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.980\nSo, if you’re looking at job postings,\nthese are the types of job listing you\n\n98\n00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.400\nwould look for if you are successful\nin obtaining the CySA+.\n\n99\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.283\nSo, IT security analyst, vulnerability\nanalyst, threat intelligence analyst,\n\n100\n00:05:45.283 --> 00:05:49.691\ncybersecurity analysts, secure\noperations center, or SOC analysts, and\n\n101\n00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:52.700\ncybersecurity specialist and\nsecurity engineer.\n\n102\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.956\nThose will be all the types\nof jobs you wanna look for.\n\n103\n00:05:55.956 --> 00:06:01.112\nThat is the basic rundown though of\nwhat you can expect to learn and\n\n104\n00:06:01.112 --> 00:06:05.148\nbe tested on when it comes to CySA+.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Daniel.\n\n105\n00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:08.370\nNow, if CySA+ sounds like something you\nmight be interested in, and it sure should\n\n106\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.010\nbe, make sure you watch every single\nepisode of CySA+ in our course library.\n\n107\n00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.923\nThank you for watching ITProTV,\nwe are binge worthy, thanks.\n\n108\n00:06:15.923 --> 00:06:21.711\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
