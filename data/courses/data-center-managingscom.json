00:00:27.220\nand yes that is quite the mouthful.\n\n11\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.840\nSo we're gonna shorten that to Data Center\nMonitoring with SCOM or Microsoft SCOM.\n\n12\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.540\nAnd joining us in the studio, that's\nright, the man, the myth, the legend.\n\n13\n00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.800\nYou know him as Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:36.800 -->

am good, thank you for\ninviting me to come back.\n\n17\n00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.500\nAlways a pleasure to spend time\ntalking about different technology.\n\n18\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.960\nWe're gonna focus on,\nas Daniel was saying,\n\n19\n00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.490\nMicrosoft System Center Ops Manager\n2012 R2 Data Center Cloud Monitoring.\n\n20\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.400\nCommonly referred to, as you said,\nMicrosoft S COM or SCOM.\n\n21\n00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.010\nWe're gonna spend some time really\ngoing into the System Center suite,\n\n22\n00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.160\nprimarily focusing on\nSystem Center Office Manager.\n\n23\n00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.821\nWe'll take a little look here and\nthere at some of the other technology.\n\n24\n00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:10.460\nWe're actually gonna start\nout by talking about\n\n25\n00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.063\nwhat makes up the System Center\nOps Manager technology platform,\n\n26\n00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:18.390\nby looking at the associated products\nthat are part of the System Center suite.\n\n27\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.680\nWe'll talk about those.\n\n28\n00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.490\nWe're gonna broadly focus on\nthe concepts of data center management,\n\n29\n00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.940\ntake a look at what it means to be\nable to do continuous monitoring\n\n30\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.990\nfrom the Microsoft platform perspective.\n\n31\n00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.610\nHow do we set up SCOM?\n\n32\n00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.800\nHow do we get it up and running?\n\n33\n00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.450\nWhat's the architecture look like?\n\n34\n00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.180\nWhat are our deployment options?\n\n35\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.000\nHow do we use it to connect to a variety\nof different technology platforms,\n\n36\n00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.330\nmonitor both Microsoft and\nnon-Microsoft technology?\n\n37\n00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.110\nCan we do cross-platform\nmonitoring outside of Microsoft,\n\n38\n00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.780\nwith virtualization and\nprivate and public cloud stacks?\n\n39\n00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.590\nThe answer is, absolutely.\n\n40\n00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.010\nSo we're gonna be taking a look\nat all that, pretty cool stuff.\n\n41\n00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.470\nAnd along the way, as we always do,\nwe'll tell you some interesting stories.\n\n42\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.908\nDaniel and I, I'm sure, will come up with\nsome interesting ways to refer to things.\n\n43\n00:02:02.908 --> 00:02:06.147\nWe're also gonna try to do as\nmany hands on demonstrations for\n\n44\n00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:07.214\nyou as we can fit in.\n\n45\n00:02:07.214 --> 00:02:10.602\nWe'll be going ake a look at how to build,\nhow to deploy, how to manage and\n\n46\n00:02:10.602 --> 00:02:11.381\nhow to monitor.\n\n47\n00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:15.570\nWe'll be going into detailed\ndemonstrations around all of that.\n\n48\n00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.550\nSo having said that, let's talk about\nwhat makes up the System Center stack.\n\n49\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.510\nSystem Center, as a product line and\na group of products,\n\n50\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.450\nhas really grown over the years.\n\n51\n00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.800\nBack in the day early on,\n\n52\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.590\nwhen I first started working with these\nindividual products one at a time.\n\n53\n00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.330\nThere was no such thing as\nSystem Center as a suite of products.\n\n54\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.290\nThere was the System Center Ops Manager\nback then would have been called MOM.\n\n55\n00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.150\nMicrosoft Ops Manager.\n\n56\n00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.021\nSystem Center Configuration Manager would\nhave been a different product name.\n\n57\n00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:50.340\nAnd it would have been, really,\njust individual products.\n\n58\n00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.950\nThere was no data protection\nmanager back then.\n\n59\n00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.520\nSo we didn't really have a formal\nenterprise level backup solution.\n\n60\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.856\nOr Microsoft didn't, anyway.\n\n61\n00:02:58.856 --> 00:03:02.152\nFCCM System Center Config Manager\nwould have been called SMS,\n\n62\n00:03:02.152 --> 00:03:04.340\nSystems Management Server, back then.\n\n63\n00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.590\nAnd when I say back then,\nI mean really way back [LAUGH] right?\n\n64\n00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.290\nWe're talking about many, many years ago,\nbecause these products started out as\n\n65\n00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.340\nindividual pieces of\na broader puzzle that,\n\n66\n00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.840\nover time, Microsoft has knitted\ntogether into a suite of products.\n\n67\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.890\nBut there was no Data Protection Manager,\n\n68\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.590\nthere was no orchestrater\nto do work flow directly.\n\n69\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.570\nThere was no endpoint Protection Manager,\n\n70\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.390\nalthough there was the acquisition of\na company called Sabari years ago.\n\n71\n00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.520\nYou may or may not remember,\nI don't know if you remember Sabari.\n\n72\n00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.240\nBut they were one of the number one,\nor they were in the top two or\n\n73\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.090\nthree AV vendors, years and years ago.\n\n74\n00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.066\nFor Exchange in particular,\nthey were really well known,\n\n75\n00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:47.750\nthis was what they specialised in.\n\n76\n00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.272\nMicrosoft went out and acquired them,\namong many other companies, and\n\n77\n00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:54.852\nturned their technology into what you\nmay more commonly know these days as\n\n78\n00:03:54.852 --> 00:03:55.901\nForefront, right?\n\n79\n00:03:55.901 --> 00:04:00.169\nSo, the Forefront product line, and\nall the protections that come with that,\n\n80\n00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.550\nalthough that's kind of moving away.\n\n81\n00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.690\nThreat Mitigation Gateway, TMG,\nwhich is what the proxy server technology\n\n82\n00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.980\nkinda morphed into,\nalong with the forefront technology,\n\n83\n00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.890\nhas really all been blended back in and\nis changing around.\n\n84\n00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.930\nAnd become what we think of as\nEndpoint Protection Manager for\n\n85\n00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.600\nSystem Center Config Manager,\nand Endpoint Management,\n\n86\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.140\nessentially mobile device\nmanagement on the endpoint side.\n\n87\n00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.840\nSo we have that as part of the platform\ntoday, we didn't really have that before.\n\n88\n00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.530\nService manager, which is our help desk\nservice level management software.\n\n89\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.220\nThink of Heat, think of Remedy,\nthink of Servicenow, Service Desk.\n\n90\n00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.230\nProducts like that,\nthat are competitive in that space,\n\n91\n00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.160\nthat's what service manager does.\n\n92\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.040\nSCVMMs, System Center\nVirtual Machine Manager.\n\n93\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.210\nThat is our competitive product\non the Microsoft side for\n\n94\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.320\nVMWare's V Center for Citrix,\nthe Zen Center's N Server, etc.\n\n95\n00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.240\nSo that's our centralized management\nthought process for hyper V hosts, and\n\n96\n00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.670\nvirtualization.\n\n97\n00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.140\nWhen we more broadly think about the Cloud\ntoday, and think about Microsoft centric\n\n98\n00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.700\ntechnology around how to use the Cloud,\nset a private Clouds, monitor manage.\n\n99\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.740\nWe link to Virtual Machine manager to\ncreate what we would call the fabric,\n\n100\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.420\ncontrol of the network fabric,\nthe storage fabric,\n\n101\n00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.290\nthe public private interfaces to Azure, to\nthe Cloud fabric, and monitor in manage.\n\n102\n00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.540\nAll of that virtualization and\ntechnology through those two products.\n\n103\n00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.310\nAnd we have what's called System Center\nAdvisor, System Center Advisor is\n\n104\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.040\nan online service that we can connect to\nand buy a subscription to, that allows us\n\n105\n00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.505\nto utilize Microsoft Azure to analyze the\nconfiguration of servers and applications.\n\n106\n00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:44.625\nAnd interact with them, connect them back\nin, to the SCOM products among others and\n\n107\n00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:48.115\nwork with them, so\nwe have an entire suite of products.\n\n108\n00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:51.495\nWait I forgot App Controller as well,\nthe App Controller lets us manage\n\n109\n00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:54.625\nthe deployment of virtual machines\nacross public and private clouds.\n\n110\n00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:58.203\nAnother intrical part of what we\ntalk about in link with SCVMM.\n\n111\n00:05:58.203 --> 00:06:02.390\nAll of these products are now\npart of the System Center suite.\n\n112\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.420\nAs I said before,\n\n113\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.920\na lot of these products along\nthe historical arc did not even exist.\n\n114\n00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.270\nAnd as they started to exist, existed and\n\n115\n00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.120\nbecame parts of what we now think of\nas a System Center suite of products.\n\n116\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.540\nSo when you're thinking about\nSystem Center, you're thinking about,\n\n117\n00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.450\nat this point in time, nine different\nproducts that are linked together.\n\n118\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.480\nAnd that you typically will buy with\nan enterprise agreement, some sort of open\n\n119\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.450\nlicense enterprise agreement, or\nsome sort of arrangement with Microsoft.\n\n120\n00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.871\nThere's different ways\nto go with licensing,\n\n121\n00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:38.104\neverything really depends on your seed\ncount and how you're going to spend money,\n\n122\n00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:42.112\nwhether you want to buy upfront one time,\npurchase over three years with a EA.\n\n123\n00:06:42.112 --> 00:06:44.712\nAn enterprise agreements lets\nyou spread those payments out.\n\n124\n00:06:44.712 --> 00:06:48.506\nWhether you're going to get software\ninsurance, so you get update rights and\n\n125\n00:06:48.506 --> 00:06:52.460\nupgrade rights year over year and so\nthere's a lot of different ways to go.\n\n126\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.450\nProbably need to just do a whole\nshow just on nothing but\n\n127\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.790\nMicrosoft licensing in theory.\n\n128\n00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's so complicated and\n\n129\n00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.160\nso diverse, and\nrich in terms of the options.\n\n130\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.790\nBut however you get there, ultimately,\nwhen you buy this product,\n\n131\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.410\nyou're buying a suite of products.\n\n132\n00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.240\nYou're usually not just\nbuying one product.\n\n133\n00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.860\nYou can license just SCOM,\nlet's say, individually.\n\n134\n00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.610\nBut the reality is, you're probably\nbuying the entire suite as a business.\n\n135\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.220\nAnd then using that suite of products\nto be able to drive much broader\n\n136\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.750\nacross the enterprise or\n\n137\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.630\nacross the organization integration\nof your entire technology stack.\n\n138\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.470\nSo it's kind of an interesting approach.\n\n139\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.380\nWhen we think about getting started with\nSCOM, what we're really thinking about is\n\n140\n00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.650\nhow do we take this product,\ncontinuous operational monitoring, and\n\n141\n00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.550\nlink it to all of these other\nproducts that we were talking about?\n\n142\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.970\nSo what I wanted to show you,\njust by way of getting started,\n\n143\n00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.300\nif we can go to my machine for\njust one second.\n\n144\n00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.620\nWas exactly that, how do we get started\nwith System Center 12 Ops Manager?\n\n145\n00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.679\nMicrosoft's got a bunch of real\nestate out there on the web.\n\n146\n00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:55.499\nThroughout our episodes, throughout all of\nthe shows associated with this particular\n\n147\n00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:59.927\nset of topics, we're gonna be taking you\nout to a series of Microsoft websites,\n\n148\n00:07:59.927 --> 00:08:03.508\nall through TechNet primarily,\nthat are gonna help you to better\n\n149\n00:08:03.508 --> 00:08:08.067\nunderstand this product Features of it,\nspecifications around how to deploy it,\n\n150\n00:08:08.067 --> 00:08:10.710\nsteps involved with\ncertain aspects of usage.\n\n151\n00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.270\nThat way you've got\na complete documentation,\n\n152\n00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.524\nthought process on your side that you can\nrefer to if you're new to this product.\n\n153\n00:08:17.524 --> 00:08:20.025\nIf you've been using it for\na very long time, but\n\n154\n00:08:20.025 --> 00:08:23.442\njust need to understand a specific\napproach to a certain problem.\n\n155\n00:08:23.442 --> 00:08:26.882\nIf you are dipping your toe in the water\nbecause somebody's already set it\n\n156\n00:08:26.882 --> 00:08:27.444\nup for you.\n\n157\n00:08:27.444 --> 00:08:31.930\nAnd you've been given the task or\nthe necessary abilities.\n\n158\n00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.909\nYour boss has said hey, Daniel or whoever,\n\n159\n00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.449\nright, you're gonna take this product\nover, we need you to get spun up on it.\n\n160\n00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:39.412\nWell obviously you're in\nthe right place to do that.\n\n161\n00:08:39.412 --> 00:08:43.651\nBut aside from that, you're gonna wanna\nrefer back to these particular items and\n\n162\n00:08:43.651 --> 00:08:46.220\nread up on these a little\nbit more in depth.\n\n163\n00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.925\nIt's great to listen to us talk, but\n\n164\n00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:50.467\nthe reality is you may wanna\nlittle more specificity.\n\n165\n00:08:50.467 --> 00:08:54.389\nAnd keep in mind that over time,\nas the product emerges and\n\n166\n00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:59.445\nthen ultimately goes through revisions,\nand updates with new features.\n\n167\n00:08:59.445 --> 00:09:03.909\nThere may be a slight difference in what\nwe're talking about in terms of approach,\n\n168\n00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:06.440\nlook, feel, how you do it, where you go.\n\n169\n00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.520\nAll those things that you\nknow can change over time.\n\n170\n00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.930\nReferring to the web,\nin terms of the vendor specification,\n\n171\n00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.950\nthe most recent information is\nalways the best possible approach\n\n172\n00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.770\nto get the most up to date information.\n\n173\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.180\nAnd make sure that you're spot on\nwith what your looking to accomplish.\n\n174\n00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.580\nI know you wanted to say something,\n\n175\n00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.130\nso let me let Daniel just jump in here for\na second.\n\n176\n00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.070\nThen I wanna go full screen\nin just a minute, and\n\n177\n00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.340\nI wanna just take you through\nthis website in particular,\n\n178\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.170\nshow you a couple things about how\nto use this real estate effectively.\n\n179\n00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.480\nI'm sure you've all been\nout to Tech Net before, but\n\n180\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.390\nI wanna make sure you understand exactly\nwhat you look at with a site like this and\n\n181\n00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.140\nhow to really extract the value out of it.\n\n182\n00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.030\nBut Daniel,\nI know you wanted to jump in real quick.\n\n183\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my question is, is how does\nthis really differ, or is better, or\n\n184\n00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.880\ndifferent then using\nsomething like Azure for.\n\n185\n00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.778\nAnd because Azure can monitor on-premises\ndevices as well as obviously into\n\n186\n00:09:55.778 --> 00:09:56.440\nthe cloud.\n\n187\n00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.270\nWhy would I use this over that, or\nwhat's the difference between the two?\n\n188\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.500\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so, it's a great question.\n\n189\n00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.350\nWe're gonna talk a little more,\na little bit more in-depth in a coming\n\n190\n00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.870\nset of episodes,\nabout some of those connection points.\n\n191\n00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.060\nBut at a high level, when we think about\nAzure, the Microsoft cloud fabric, right.\n\n192\n00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.840\nThis would be the competitive product for\nAmazon AWS, for instance, right.\n\n193\n00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.230\nOr any of those vCloud Air,\n\n194\n00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.040\nthe VMware private public\ncloud Fabric that they have.\n\n195\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.490\nThis is what we're talking about on\nthe Microsoft site, the Azure Fabric.\n\n196\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.738\nWe can do private clouds in Azure, we can\nuse and interact with that technology.\n\n197\n00:10:28.738 --> 00:10:30.887\nEssentially the same way we would, but\n\n198\n00:10:30.887 --> 00:10:35.461\na private cloud with Azure is hosted off\nprem, right that's the thought process.\n\n199\n00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:39.739\nYou're essentially using Microsoft's\ndata centers and the ability for\n\n200\n00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:44.431\nMicrosoft to be able to scale globally\nto provide, not just continuity in BCDR,\n\n201\n00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:49.078\nbusiness continuity disaster recovery\ncapabilities through their network.\n\n202\n00:10:49.078 --> 00:10:52.160\nYou could fail through the Microsoft\ncloud around the world to\n\n203\n00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.520\nany of the data centers that are online.\n\n204\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.360\nSo there's a lot more not\nonly flexibility, but\n\n205\n00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.420\ndepth there in that respect.\n\n206\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.420\nFor companies that want that and\nare willing and able to host off prem, but\n\n207\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.480\nstill have a private cloud,\nit makes perfectly good sense.\n\n208\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.300\nAnd you can use, not just the system\ncenter product, the Ops Manager, but\n\n209\n00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.143\nthe majority of the tools and\ntechnologies are available as\n\n210\n00:11:15.143 --> 00:11:19.010\na service these days with Azure or\nadd ons through Azure.\n\n211\n00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:25.760\nWe have the Operations Center Suite,\nOCS, which gives us the time to Azure.\n\n212\n00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.670\nWe do online analytics,\nonline data management and\n\n213\n00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.770\nanalysis, there's all sorts\nof stuff that could be done.\n\n214\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.439\nWhen I say online I mean over\nthe wire into the cloud right,\n\n215\n00:11:33.439 --> 00:11:34.922\ndirectly into the data center.\n\n216\n00:11:34.922 --> 00:11:38.270\nSo as a customer you would get that,\nbut to Daniel's question, and\n\n217\n00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.289\nDaniel's point what's the value\nproposition, what's the differentiator.\n\n218\n00:11:42.289 --> 00:11:46.425\nA lot of companies wanna run private\ncloud, but wanna host it on prem.\n\n219\n00:11:46.425 --> 00:11:51.220\nOr wanna have a hybrid where they may\nhost portions off prem, portions on prem,\n\n220\n00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.736\nthis may be regulatory.\n\n221\n00:11:52.736 --> 00:11:54.122\nSo there may be standards and\n\n222\n00:11:54.122 --> 00:11:56.853\nconcerns around compliance\nthat have to be addressed.\n\n223\n00:11:56.853 --> 00:12:01.576\nNot every company can afford to and or,\nfrom regulatory compliance prospective,\n\n224\n00:12:01.576 --> 00:12:05.488\nallow data to be hosted in a private\ncloud scenario off prem outside of\n\n225\n00:12:05.488 --> 00:12:06.660\ntheir control.\n\n226\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.340\nAlthough that's becoming less and\nless of an issue today,\n\n227\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:14.760\nall these cloud vendors Microsoft,\nAmazon, Google, VMware, Citrix, Sysco.\n\n228\n00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.840\nAll the biggies you would think of,\nOracle is on that list as well.\n\n229\n00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.900\nAny of them if they are, and\nthey all are in one form or another,\n\n230\n00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.850\nproviding hosted private cloud services\nthrough some sort of fabric layer.\n\n231\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:30.518\nAll of them are certifying, auditing,\nand validating their ability to provide\n\n232\n00:12:30.518 --> 00:12:34.977\nthe same kind of regulatory compliance,\nthe same kind of assurance is what we\n\n233\n00:12:34.977 --> 00:12:39.664\nwould call it, in that space that you\ncould provide by hosting on prem directly.\n\n234\n00:12:39.664 --> 00:12:43.776\nSo five, six years ago, this would have\nbeen a very different conversation, right.\n\n235\n00:12:43.776 --> 00:12:48.959\nSitting in 2017 talking about this\nthought process today, there's less and\n\n236\n00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:53.316\nless of a compelling reason not to\npotentially go to a third party with\n\n237\n00:12:53.316 --> 00:12:58.025\na hosted private cloud solution like\nMicrosoft, like the Azure Fabric.\n\n238\n00:12:58.025 --> 00:13:00.760\nBut many companies are still\nstruggling with whether or\n\n239\n00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.430\nnot they can get over that hurdle.\n\n240\n00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.110\nReally it's more a head space thing right,\nit's a mental\n\n241\n00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.420\nleap you have to make culturally\nto understand that you can trust.\n\n242\n00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:13.690\nAnd certify that trust with a third party\nprovider, at a level that makes you,\n\n243\n00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.070\nas the data owner, and ultimately\ntransfers risk and liability and\n\n244\n00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:22.700\nresponsibility to them as the data\ncustodians makes everybody happy.\n\n245\n00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.690\nBut we could do almost the same\nexact thing using either the hosted\n\n246\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.950\nmodel through Azure, or\nthe on-prem model with this product.\n\n247\n00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.750\nBut a lot of companies have made\ninvestments in products like this over\n\n248\n00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.420\nthe years and continue to license them.\n\n249\n00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.430\nAnd they just haven't really\ndone the cost analysis, and\n\n250\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.550\nthe thought process hasn't really\nmatured yet to do the, whether or\n\n251\n00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.460\nnot it makes sense to do this or\nthat cost benefit analysis.\n\n252\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.540\nWhat many companies find when\nthey look at the analytics,\n\n253\n00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.370\nand they look at the level\nof approximate value,\n\n254\n00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.948\nthey seem to ultimately come down on the\nside, at least most of my customers have.\n\n255\n00:13:55.948 --> 00:14:00.050\nThat we could show them a path that allows\nthem to do the same things in the cloud,\n\n256\n00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.049\nusually for about as much,\nmaybe even less in some cases,\n\n257\n00:14:03.049 --> 00:14:06.868\ndepending on what they're ready to do,\nover a three to five year period.\n\n258\n00:14:06.868 --> 00:14:10.789\nIn other words, you can't just look at\nthe initial upfront cost to migrate and or\n\n259\n00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:13.453\nto switch,\nbecause they tend to be a little lopsided.\n\n260\n00:14:13.453 --> 00:14:17.093\nBut if you look, ultimately, over\nthe life cycle of that product or that\n\n261\n00:14:17.093 --> 00:14:21.582\nparticular architecture, you're looking at\na three to five year span traditionally.\n\n262\n00:14:21.582 --> 00:14:25.177\nYou're actually seeing parity, and\nperhaps even cost savings over time,\n\n263\n00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:28.937\nthe trick there is that you have to pay,\nand this is the case for any cloud model,\n\n264\n00:14:28.937 --> 00:14:32.640\nyou have to pay as you go, so\nclearly that's gonna be important.\n\n265\n00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.740\nAnd you have to consume, right,\nbased on what you're paying for,\n\n266\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.730\nyou have to consume as you go.\n\n267\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:40.240\nBut the trick is to understand how to\nvalue and estimate that consumption.\n\n268\n00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.851\nAnd then really understand how to micro,\n\n269\n00:14:41.851 --> 00:14:43.931\nwell, I don't wanna give\nyou the wrong impression.\n\n270\n00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:47.212\nWhen I say micromanage,\nyou're not in there 24/7, but\n\n271\n00:14:47.212 --> 00:14:51.023\nto manage down to the point where\nyou can really control consumption.\n\n272\n00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:56.081\nThis is what makes the thought process\nof a host to third party cloud model so\n\n273\n00:14:56.081 --> 00:14:59.958\ncompelling, because you really do pay for\nwhat you use.\n\n274\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.460\nAnd if you're smart about how\nyou then control that usage,\n\n275\n00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.260\nit actually becomes a cost saving\nproposition for the business.\n\n276\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.980\nSo there may be a lot of value\nin switching to that over time.\n\n277\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.520\nWe do have Azure Management pack that\nwe can download and deploy into Scom.\n\n278\n00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.420\nWe'll talk more about what\nmanagement packs are generically.\n\n279\n00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:20.750\nBut the idea of being able to download and\nset up an entire suite\n\n280\n00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:26.080\nof monitoring rules and capabilities,\nand alerts, and monitors,\n\n281\n00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.960\nand views and all the things that go into\na management packs as we'll talk about.\n\n282\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.450\nWe have them prepackaged from a lot of\nvendors, got a cool site we'll show you at\n\n283\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.670\nsome point with an up-to-date lists of all\nthe Management Packs that exist out there.\n\n284\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.410\nIt's hard to find, sometimes, the list of\nactually where they are and what they are.\n\n285\n00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.760\nBut I'll show you a place you can\ngo to take a look at that, but\n\n286\n00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.150\nwe've got a really good set of ones.\n\n287\n00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.970\nThey just bought out a brand new one for\nOffice 365 last couple of weeks.\n\n288\n00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.780\nThey're always updating, they being\nMicrosoft, always updating these things.\n\n289\n00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.833\nThere's a great one for\nthe Azure Fabric, so you download that,\n\n290\n00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:57.010\nyou integrate with Azure and\nwe can monitor and interact with that.\n\n291\n00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.920\nSo we can keep Scom on prem and\nmonitor Azure in the cloud, or\n\n292\n00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.431\nwe can monitor through the Azure Fabric\nand do everything in the cloud.\n\n293\n00:16:03.431 --> 00:16:04.774\nWe have options today,\n\n294\n00:16:04.774 --> 00:16:09.081\nwhich is great cuz as I said a few years\nago options were really very minimal.\n\n295\n00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:13.450\nYou basically use on-prem or\nwhatever would have been at that point.\n\n296\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.257\nAnd if you had cloud infrastructure,\n\n297\n00:16:15.257 --> 00:16:17.976\nyou had to rely on Microsoft\nto give you that monitoring.\n\n298\n00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:20.508\nAnd in the beginning, it was sort\nof hard to tie the two together,\n\n299\n00:16:20.508 --> 00:16:22.133\nthese days it's essentially seamless.\n\n300\n00:16:22.133 --> 00:16:25.300\n&gt;&gt; And Microsoft doesn't care which\none you use cuz they're both Microsoft\n\n301\n00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:25.845\nproducts.\n\n302\n00:16:25.845 --> 00:16:26.970\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; No, they don't.\n\n303\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.572\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They just want you to use the product,\n\n304\n00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:30.645\nwhatever it is.\n\n305\n00:16:30.645 --> 00:16:34.460\n[INAUDIBLE] always been in particular,\nthat product\n\n306\n00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:39.500\nthat it's been really difficult to explain\nthe value proposition of to customers.\n\n307\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.150\nNot because conceptually\nthey don't get it,\n\n308\n00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.110\nI have this conversation with\ncustomers and students all the time.\n\n309\n00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.210\nIt's an incredibly powerful product.\n\n310\n00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.662\nBut there's kind of an urban myth and\nlegend and\n\n311\n00:16:48.662 --> 00:16:51.433\nstigma around the product\nI find in certain circles.\n\n312\n00:16:51.433 --> 00:16:54.583\nWhere people say that's way too\ncomplicated, we can't use that we've heard\n\n313\n00:16:54.583 --> 00:16:57.310\nnothing but horror stories\nabout how complicated it is.\n\n314\n00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.750\nPeople tell us it takes like 30 minutes to\ndeploy, it takes more than that, it takes\n\n315\n00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.010\nabout an hour and half to just do the\ninstalls get everything up and running.\n\n316\n00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.255\nCouple hours if you're building out\nthe whole data center stack, but\n\n317\n00:17:08.255 --> 00:17:09.745\nit takes a few hours to stand up.\n\n318\n00:17:09.745 --> 00:17:12.092\nBut then it takes like six\nmonths to fine tune and\n\n319\n00:17:12.092 --> 00:17:16.565\nactually make operational and my God, when\nyou stand it up you turn on monitoring.\n\n320\n00:17:16.565 --> 00:17:20.375\nYou're flooded with information you can\nnever ever understand what's happening,\n\n321\n00:17:20.375 --> 00:17:22.555\nnothing can be further\nfrom the truth by the way.\n\n322\n00:17:22.555 --> 00:17:26.245\nIf you understand how to use this\nproduct and use it effectively, and\n\n323\n00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:30.560\nyou have either somebody such as Daniel or\nmyself, or\n\n324\n00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.630\nwhoever it may be that understands\nhow to use the product.\n\n325\n00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.110\nAnd shows you how to standard\nup as a consultant and/or\n\n326\n00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.230\nas a member of your team.\n\n327\n00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.020\nMaybe you at some point in the future,\n\n328\n00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.980\nhopefully, once you've been through\nall of our episodes with us.\n\n329\n00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.969\nYou'll be able to put that cap,\nthat mastery cap of knowledge on,\n\n330\n00:17:46.969 --> 00:17:50.043\nit's almost like the hat in Harry Potter,\nright?\n\n331\n00:17:50.043 --> 00:17:52.420\nI forgot,\nyou're not the Harry Potter person.\n\n332\n00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.415\nI'm talking to the wrong person.\n\n333\n00:17:53.415 --> 00:17:57.152\nBut the cap that essentially chooses you\nand puts you in the appropriate house,\n\n334\n00:17:57.152 --> 00:17:59.845\nyou probably know at least\nthat much about Harry Potter.\n\n335\n00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:00.800\n&gt;&gt; No, I know zero about Harry Potter.\n\n336\n00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.496\n&gt;&gt; You know zero about Harry Potter.\n\n337\n00:18:01.496 --> 00:18:02.690\n&gt;&gt; Sorry [LAUGH].\n\n338\n00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.290\nWe're gonna pretend we didn't make\nthe Harry Potter reference, but anyway,\n\n339\n00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.700\nit's kinda like putting on\nthat cap of knowledge, right?\n\n340\n00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.440\nSo the idea, remember Buckaroo Banzai?\n\n341\n00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.373\n&gt;&gt; I remember, but I never read it.\n\n342\n00:18:11.373 --> 00:18:13.030\n&gt;&gt; Did you see the movie?\n\n343\n00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:13.718\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n344\n00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:17.710\n&gt;&gt; You gotta watch Buckaroo Banzai,\nI'm zero for two with references today.\n\n345\n00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.290\n&gt;&gt; You're zero for today today.\n\n346\n00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.515\n&gt;&gt; I am, you gotta watch Buckaroo Banzai,\nawesome movie.\n\n347\n00:18:21.515 --> 00:18:24.685\nSo, we're going to pretend\nI said nothing about that.\n\n348\n00:18:24.685 --> 00:18:26.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, that'll be our random aside for\n\n349\n00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.230\nthis episode.\n\n350\n00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.120\nBut what I was going to suggest is just\nyou're be coming comfortable with this\n\n351\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.760\ntechnology, allows you to\nunderstand that the trick and\n\n352\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.010\nit is a trick you gotta understand this.\n\n353\n00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.310\nBut the trick and the skill with using\nthis tool is to not bite off more than you\n\n354\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:48.350\ncan chew, in other words, too focused\non broadly monitoring everything.\n\n355\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.960\nBut rather the idea here scoping and\n\n356\n00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.300\ntailoring what we would call in security,\nfiltering in english.\n\n357\n00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.960\nNarrowing your focus, this tool can be\nincredibly powerful, but it can get away\n\n358\n00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:04.990\nfrom you very easily if your idea here is\nthat, you're going to monitor everything.\n\n359\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.530\nBut if you understand that this tool\nis designed to monitor everything, but\n\n360\n00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.419\nit's a one-size-fits-one, not take it\noff the shelf and monitor everything.\n\n361\n00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:16.945\nBut take it off the shelf and monitor with\nspecificity and purpose what is specific\n\n362\n00:19:16.945 --> 00:19:20.840\nto your environment, what you need and\nwhat you want to understand.\n\n363\n00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.550\nIf you can do that, and you can only turn\non through the addition of management\n\n364\n00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:30.690\npacks, and the enabling of monitoring\nthe things that are super critical to you.\n\n365\n00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.930\nThen that's where the power\nof this tool lies,\n\n366\n00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.440\nand we're going to focus on how\nto do those things as we go.\n\n367\n00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.649\nBut ultimately, don't be scared\nof the stool, that urban myth and\n\n368\n00:19:38.649 --> 00:19:42.159\nlegend out there about the complexity\nof the stool is not accurate at all.\n\n369\n00:19:42.159 --> 00:19:46.140\nI do deployments of this kind of a tool\nfor customers all over the world.\n\n370\n00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.570\nI have lots of customers that use it, lots\nof students that I've spent time with over\n\n371\n00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.880\nthe years that are using various\nversions of this product.\n\n372\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.510\nAnd all are very happy with it, as long\nas they take the time to understand\n\n373\n00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.420\nwhat not to do as much, as they take\nthe time to understand what to do.\n\n374\n00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.460\nAnd you gotta plan, this is one of those\ntools, one of those pieces of software\n\n375\n00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.660\nthat if you're not planning,\nif you don't have a game plan.\n\n376\n00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.270\nAnd we have sizing spread\nsheets we use and documents,\n\n377\n00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.550\nthat we are going to be able to\ninteract with, that allow us to\n\n378\n00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.930\nbe able to understand and lay out exactly\nwhat it is that we wanna accomplish.\n\n379\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:23.011\nIf we have access to that material and\nwe're smart about how we use it and\n\n380\n00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:24.724\nwe have the thought process.\n\n381\n00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:27.706\nAnd the Enterprise architecture\nsketched out ahead of time,\n\n382\n00:20:27.706 --> 00:20:30.988\nbefore we ever lay hands on this product,\nbefore we ever deploy it.\n\n383\n00:20:30.988 --> 00:20:34.239\nIt's one thing to put it into a test\nenvironment, set it up, stand it up, and\n\n384\n00:20:34.239 --> 00:20:36.050\ninteract with it, encourage you to do it.\n\n385\n00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:40.180\nYou could download VHDs from\nMicrosoft that are fully functional,\n\n386\n00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.260\n180 day trials that you could stand\nthis product up with and use.\n\n387\n00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.380\nYou can go online and\nuse some of the hands-on labs at TechNet\n\n388\n00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.720\nto play with various aspects\nof the Systems Center Suite.\n\n389\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.740\nInteract with Config Manager and some of\nthe other products that are out there.\n\n390\n00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.100\nBut you should definitely use the product\nbefore you deploy it in production.\n\n391\n00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.400\nBut once you get ready\nto deploy it formally,\n\n392\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.505\nyou've got to do a lot of planning.\n\n393\n00:21:02.505 --> 00:21:06.480\n90% of the work on this\nproduct is standing it up and\n\n394\n00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.060\nplanning it ahead of time, and deploying\nthat architecture to get it right,\n\n395\n00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.890\nand then 10% is just actually,\nafter the fact, fine tuning and using.\n\n396\n00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:20.400\nThe product you're going to see as we get\ninto is not hard to use, surprisingly so\n\n397\n00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.330\na lot of people think the hardest\nthing to do is actually use it.\n\n398\n00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.458\nHardest thing to do is to plan\nto deploy it correctly and\n\n399\n00:21:26.458 --> 00:21:31.019\nactually get it right up front, it's\neasy once you've done that deployment.\n\n400\n00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:34.234\nAnd you've got it sketched out\nthe right way to actually fine tune and\n\n401\n00:21:34.234 --> 00:21:36.786\nload the management packs\neither through importing or\n\n402\n00:21:36.786 --> 00:21:39.770\ncreation of your own,\nwe'll talk about how to do both.\n\n403\n00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.690\nAnd then adding in the monitors the rules,\nthe tasks,\n\n404\n00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.380\nthe views that you want to create.\n\n405\n00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.910\nIf you create your own management packs,\n\n406\n00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.140\nI'm going to walk you\nthrough how to do all that.\n\n407\n00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.000\nWe'll show you how to do it, it's not\ndifficult at all, Damon's going to\n\n408\n00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.360\nactually do all those demos for us,\nhe stepped up and said no Adam.\n\n409\n00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.890\nI want you to just talk about\nI want to do everything.\n\n410\n00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.170\nHe didn't say any of that by the way,\nhe's not going to do that.\n\n411\n00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.070\nUnless they getting ready\nto watch the dumpster fire.\n\n412\n00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.368\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna be what is this,\n\n413\n00:22:01.368 --> 00:22:02.801\nwhat am I clicking on, where do I go.\n\n414\n00:22:02.801 --> 00:22:04.284\nBut together we're gonna\nwalk you through that.\n\n415\n00:22:04.284 --> 00:22:08.017\nDaniel is going to help me all kidding a\nside, and as he continues to do as we talk\n\n416\n00:22:08.017 --> 00:22:12.175\nabout technology like this, he's gonna\nthrow out observations and questions.\n\n417\n00:22:12.175 --> 00:22:14.985\nAnd I'm sure he's gonna have\na lot to say about this product.\n\n418\n00:22:14.985 --> 00:22:17.605\nBut as we go through, we're gonna\nshow you all the different aspects,\n\n419\n00:22:17.605 --> 00:22:19.107\nall the little nooks and crannies.\n\n420\n00:22:19.107 --> 00:22:21.627\nWhat's going on in here,\nlet's go back to the web for a minute,\n\n421\n00:22:21.627 --> 00:22:23.627\nit's just that I wanna\nyou this tech net site.\n\n422\n00:22:23.627 --> 00:22:26.597\nCould we go full screen just for\na minute so we can see a little bit more.\n\n423\n00:22:26.597 --> 00:22:28.627\nLook at that it gets so much bigger,\nI didn't even have to zoom,\n\n424\n00:22:28.627 --> 00:22:30.407\nit's almost like magic when that happens.\n\n425\n00:22:30.407 --> 00:22:32.530\nAll right so\nwhat I just wanted to show you here, and\n\n426\n00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.770\njust to remind you all the URLs\nwe take out to all the websites.\n\n427\n00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.120\nDan is gonna capture,\nwe've got them all in the show notes.\n\n428\n00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.040\nYou'll be able to get\na complete set of notes for\n\n429\n00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.630\nall the episodes we're\ndoing along with URLs.\n\n430\n00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:46.110\nGot some detailed notes from me on a\nvariety of different things that you wanna\n\n431\n00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.250\ncheck out and take a look at.\n\n432\n00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.680\nEspecially if we're talking about like\na step by step process or something.\n\n433\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.400\nI've tried to put the steps in\nwhere I can and detailed them.\n\n434\n00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.070\nIf not, I've at least given you\na website where you can find the steps\n\n435\n00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.180\nto go through, also giving you a lot\nof PowerShell in there as well.\n\n436\n00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.190\nPowerShell's gonna be an integral\npart of what we do with this tool.\n\n437\n00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.930\nAnd if you're not comfortable\nwith PowerShell, we have,\n\n438\n00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.530\nI believe if I'm not mistaken, right?\n\n439\n00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.244\n&gt;&gt; I think we do.\n\n440\n00:23:08.244 --> 00:23:10.931\n&gt;&gt; We do have episodes for you,\nnot in this particular show, but\n\n441\n00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:15.110\nbroadly in the ITPRO.TV library, that can\nhelp you to better understand PowerShell.\n\n442\n00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.690\nEncourage you to take a look at that.\n\n443\n00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.661\nJust so you know,\nas we're scrolling through here,\n\n444\n00:23:19.661 --> 00:23:22.841\nwhile you can do everything\nyou need to do in the counsel.\n\n445\n00:23:22.841 --> 00:23:27.181\nRight to be able to manage counsel,\nthere use a lot of flexibility with\n\n446\n00:23:27.181 --> 00:23:31.063\na powershell, we have a powershell,\nspecific powershell counsel,\n\n447\n00:23:31.063 --> 00:23:36.370\nspecific to the manager, so it's cut all\nof the command that's already loaded.\n\n448\n00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.240\nWe'll take a look and\nshow that to you in upcoming episodes.\n\n449\n00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.880\nYou'll want to get comfortable using that\nas we progress using iterations of this\n\n450\n00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.594\ntool over time we're gonna be\ndoing more and more in PowerShell.\n\n451\n00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:50.676\nThat seems to be the general flow\nMicrosoft's taking with the majority of\n\n452\n00:23:50.676 --> 00:23:51.960\ntheir products.\n\n453\n00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.210\nAnd you're going to want to get\ncomfortable with a non-graphical\n\n454\n00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:56.900\nenvironment to be able to script things.\n\n455\n00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.650\nThe nice thing about the PowerShell\nsnippets I'm sharing with you.\n\n456\n00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.402\nThey are alternatives for the things\nwe're already doing in the console.\n\n457\n00:24:02.402 --> 00:24:05.965\nThey're labeled as such, give you the code\nand the explanation of what to do.\n\n458\n00:24:05.965 --> 00:24:08.983\nWe'll demo a few of them, not demo all\nof them, but demo a lot of them for you.\n\n459\n00:24:08.983 --> 00:24:12.305\nBut all you have to do is practice with\nthem to understand how to use them,\n\n460\n00:24:12.305 --> 00:24:13.837\nthey're not very complicated.\n\n461\n00:24:13.837 --> 00:24:19.428\nSo, getting started with System Center\n2012, 2012 R2, Ops Manager, on a website\n\n462\n00:24:19.428 --> 00:24:23.741\nlike this, on any of the websites,\nwhat you want to make sure you look for\n\n463\n00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:28.740\nfirst of all, over here is gonna be\nthe hey, this applies to various versions.\n\n464\n00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:33.910\nAnd you'll see it applies to\nSystem Center 12 R2 12 with SP1, right?\n\n465\n00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:37.070\nSo its the more recent versions of\nthe tool, so you're always gonna wanna\n\n466\n00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.820\nmake sure you're looking at\ninformation that is appropriate for\n\n467\n00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.970\nthe version that you're gonna be using.\n\n468\n00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.010\nTo give you a little overview and\nthen they have a lot of links, right, to\n\n469\n00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:50.040\nvarious places, what's new in Ops manager,\nfor various iterations, key concepts.\n\n470\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.810\nProbably good to take a look at that.\n\n471\n00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:56.220\nOps Manager release notes,\ncan't stress how important it is for\n\n472\n00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.500\nyou to read through the release notes of\nwhatever version you're working with.\n\n473\n00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.780\nThere's a lot of subtlety and\n\n474\n00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.855\ndetail in the release notes that\nyou're gonna wanna be familiar with.\n\n475\n00:25:03.855 --> 00:25:08.230\nI talk to a lot of customers, a lot of\nstudents that come through classes,\n\n476\n00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.400\nlot of people I work with,\n\n477\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.920\nlot of peers and colleagues in the\ntechnology community that I interact with.\n\n478\n00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.250\nAnd most of the questions that I get,\nnot all of them but a lot of them,\n\n479\n00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:22.970\nare actually questions that\nare answered in release notes and or\n\n480\n00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.550\nthe web real estate that\nthe vendor puts out.\n\n481\n00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.760\nBut that you just have to go through and\nreally get the rake out, right, and\n\n482\n00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.220\njust comb all that knowledge out\nof the document and understand it.\n\n483\n00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.810\nYou'd be surprised how much of that\nstuff becomes relevant as you start to\n\n484\n00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:36.760\nuse the product.\n\n485\n00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.400\nIt's just, I think human nature,\nmost people don't read the owner's manual.\n\n486\n00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.810\nThey go right to setting up,\nand that's okay.\n\n487\n00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.570\nBut if you go back and\nread the release notes,\n\n488\n00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.420\nyou will find that there is\na lot of valuable information.\n\n489\n00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.120\nAnd then there is, in this particular\ncase, a learning road map for SCOM so\n\n490\n00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.560\nMicrosoft's training that may be available\nfor the product is usually there.\n\n491\n00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.190\nYou'll see here we have\nTech Net information, so\n\n492\n00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.260\nlinks to the main Tech Net library for\nthe Ops Manager.\n\n493\n00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.130\nWhat are the supported configurations,\n\n494\n00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.160\nwe're gonna be talking about\nthat in an upcoming episode.\n\n495\n00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.469\nHow do we deploy,\nwe're gonna be talking about that.\n\n496\n00:26:08.469 --> 00:26:12.036\nGonna do a whole set of demos for\nyou on how to deploy not just SCOM but\n\n497\n00:26:12.036 --> 00:26:14.164\nall the related products in the suite.\n\n498\n00:26:14.164 --> 00:26:18.654\nWe'll take a look at how to deploy\nthe DPM product, we'll take a look at how\n\n499\n00:26:18.654 --> 00:26:23.740\nto deploy SCVMM, and set up and stand up\nall that information and real estate.\n\n500\n00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.280\nOpts Manager guide or the ops guide,\nand also the author's guide.\n\n501\n00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.940\nThe author's guide at the bottom\nwe'll refer to at some point as well.\n\n502\n00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.190\nThis is where we go in and\nlearn how to actually manage and write or\n\n503\n00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.230\ndo our own authoring for packs.\n\n504\n00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.370\nSo, if we want to customize those packs,\n\n505\n00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:43.490\ngonna do a whole episode on how to do\nthat or said episodes on how to do that,\n\n506\n00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:47.240\nupcoming, as we get into all\nthe different aspects of the technology.\n\n507\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.920\nI'm actually gonna show you how to\nwrite a pack from the ground up,\n\n508\n00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.300\ncreate one and\nadd a bunch of stuff in there.\n\n509\n00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.320\nExport it so you can see it,\nhow we do that both from the console and\n\n510\n00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.492\nalso from PowerShell, cuz we could export\nusing different tools and technologies.\n\n511\n00:27:00.492 --> 00:27:02.560\nWe're gonna be taking a look\nat how all this works,\n\n512\n00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.040\nbut wanna encourage you to start\npoking around in the confirmation or\n\n513\n00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.120\nrather poking around in the information\nfield that's out there on the web.\n\n514\n00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.990\nAnd make sure you're comfortable with what\nyou see out there, it's gonna be really,\n\n515\n00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.445\nreally valuable for you to make\nsure you're comfortable with and\n\n516\n00:27:16.445 --> 00:27:19.035\ntake a look at all of\nthat different content.\n\n517\n00:27:19.035 --> 00:27:22.370\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Adam, I know this is\nwe got a lot of content to cover, but\n\n518\n00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.238\nI'm looking at our clock we have\nvery little bit of time left.\n\n519\n00:27:25.238 --> 00:27:29.454\nWe wanna get into some of the key\nconcepts, key features that is in SCOM for\n\n520\n00:27:29.454 --> 00:27:32.319\nus, but\nwe're gonna have to do that in a part two.\n\n521\n00:27:32.319 --> 00:27:34.627\nBut still, so\nhopefully you guys will join us there.\n\n522\n00:27:34.627 --> 00:27:36.697\nAdam, thanks for joining us thus far.\n\n523\n00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:37.587\n&gt;&gt; Welcome.\n&gt;&gt; We, like I said,\n\n524\n00:27:37.587 --> 00:27:39.077\nhopefully we'll see you in part two.\n\n525\n00:27:39.077 --> 00:27:41.437\nBut as for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n526\n00:27:41.437 --> 00:27:42.147\nWe're IT Pro TV.\n\n527\n00:27:42.147 --> 00:27:43.727\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n528\n00:27:43.727 --> 00:27:44.567\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam

the data center I'm\nmonitoring with Microsoft SCOM.\n\n9\n00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.230\nAnd of course joining\nus back in the studio,\n\n10\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.610\nhe is a man that you might know as Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.770\nHence, Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.530\nAdam, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.960\n&gt;&gt; That would be me.\nI actually answer to most things.\n\n14\n00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.430\nHey you, long hair guy,\nperson with dark hair.\n\n15\n00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.860\nWell, not too much these days,\nbut anything works.\n\n16\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.030\nBut I'm glad to be back.\n\n17\n00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.410\nHopefully, you are joining us as well,\nand are excited and\n\n18\n00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.980\ninterested in learning more about\nmonitoring with Systems Center Ops Manager\n\n19\n00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.670\nin the data center, ie, private and\npublic cloud-based monitoring.\n\n20\n00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.530\nWhen we're thinking about\ncloud-based data centers or\n\n21\n00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.180\nwe're thinking about what we would\nto to stand up a product like this,\n\n22\n00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.110\nit's important to talk about some of the\nnew features and key things you can do.\n\n23\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.660\nEvery release of the product adds\ncapabilities and feature sets.\n\n24\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.760\nWe've had many iterations of MOM/SKOM\nover the life cycle of this product.\n\n25\n00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.836\nMOM, Microsoft Office Manager, early days\nbefore it became part of System Center,\n\n26\n00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:16.410\nformally.\n\n27\n00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.360\nSystem Center Ops Manager 2007,\n2012, 2012 SP1, 2012 R2.\n\n28\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.790\nThe new, new version 2016 that's\nout there, that's been around for\n\n29\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.220\na little bit now, as well.\n\n30\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.860\nBut when we think about some\nof the key features of SCOM,\n\n31\n00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.440\nthe 2012 R2 version that\nwe're talking about.\n\n32\n00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.120\nThere's a whole litany, or\nlist of things that come to mind.\n\n33\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.179\nWe're gonna take you out and\n\n34\n00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.040\nshow you some stuff on the Microsoft\nwebsite here in just a second.\n\n35\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.350\nBut things like APM,\nApplication Performance Monitoring and\n\n36\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.470\nbeing able to monitor applications both\nin the .NET, I was gonna say jot net,\n\n37\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.660\ncombining Java and .NET together,\nthe jotNET platform.\n\n38\n00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.210\n&gt;&gt; Hey, there's another new thing, we come\nup with new stuff every time we do a show.\n\n39\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.515\n&gt;&gt; You're keeping a list, right?\n\n40\n00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:55.119\n&gt;&gt; Got it all!\n\n41\n00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's my retirement plan right there.\n\n42\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.091\nSo the .NET framework and or Java\nEnterprise platforms we can create and\n\n43\n00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:05.415\nmonitor applications in\neither of those areas.\n\n44\n00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:09.560\nWe do performance, availability\nmonitoring there, to network monitoring.\n\n45\n00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.060\nSo we got the ability to\ndiscover network devices from\n\n46\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.020\nprobably close to 100 manufacturers, all\nthe biggies you would think of, Cisco, F5,\n\n47\n00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.750\netc., all of them would have\nthe capability for us to provide and\n\n48\n00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.580\nto describe, and therefore discover and\nmonitor their devices.\n\n49\n00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.330\nPort usage, resource consumption,\nthings like that, we could take a look at.\n\n50\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.860\nDashboards can be created, very complex,\n\n51\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.910\nvery feature rich information,\nrich capabilities with real-time updating.\n\n52\n00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.450\nWe can leverage and use the BI,\n\n53\n00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.800\nthe Business Intelligence Data\nAnalytics Stacks that are available.\n\n54\n00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.150\nWe have a web console Silverlight-based.\n\n55\n00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.190\nYou know those myths about Silverlight\ngoing away were just that,\n\n56\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.910\nbecause Microsoft for years will say,\nwell, we're gonna move away from\n\n57\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.470\nSilverlight, we're not gonna use it,\nwe are gonna use it.\n\n58\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.590\nIt was kinda that whole dubi flash thing,\nright.\n\n59\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.300\nWe're gonna keep it,\nwe're not gonna keep it.\n\n60\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.840\nPeople like it, they don't like it.\n\n61\n00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.640\nBut the dashboard's web console anyway,\nare based on Silverlight's so\n\n62\n00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.890\nthey load fast.\n\n63\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.470\nRelatively speaking, they're really\ngonna be streamlined and upgraded, so\n\n64\n00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.940\nyou can interact with\nthem on a regular basis.\n\n65\n00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.840\nUnix, Linux based monitoring got the\nability to do alternate stack monitoring.\n\n66\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.575\nOracle, Ubuntu, Debian CentOS,\nall the major capabilities for\n\n67\n00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.895\nbuilds that you would want\nto take a look at there.\n\n68\n00:03:22.895 --> 00:03:26.325\nWe do management packs, and\nmanagement templates are available now.\n\n69\n00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:30.697\nWe have about eight or nine pre-built\ntemplates for web application monitoring.\n\n70\n00:03:30.697 --> 00:03:32.277\nTransaction monitoring.\n\n71\n00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:37.507\nPort monitoring or connectivity\nout to look at network devices.\n\n72\n00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:40.197\nLook at all sorts of different\nthings in the management pack area.\n\n73\n00:03:40.197 --> 00:03:42.907\nTFS, Team Foundation Server integration.\n\n74\n00:03:42.907 --> 00:03:46.577\nWe can use Intellitrace and\nbe able to pull monitoring and\n\n75\n00:03:46.577 --> 00:03:50.217\ninteract with the monitoring\ndata we see from web based apps.\n\n76\n00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:52.287\nLink it back to TFS and\n\n77\n00:03:52.287 --> 00:03:56.818\ngenerate work items directly based\non the monitoring we do inside SCOM.\n\n78\n00:03:56.818 --> 00:04:01.590\nSo we're gonna be able to enable\nour developers to be able to have\n\n79\n00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.820\nthe ability to run not only\nreal time monitoring, but\n\n80\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.090\ngenerate work items or updates and\ninteract with alerts as a result of that.\n\n81\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.930\nWe have in depth capabilities for\nthem to do that now.\n\n82\n00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.560\nSo that's really very interesting and\nimportant on that side of the house.\n\n83\n00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.025\nWe have the ability to do the global\nmonitoring of web services from\n\n84\n00:04:21.025 --> 00:04:22.630\noutside of the stacks.\n\n85\n00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.720\nSo we can essentially be outside\nat key vantage points or\n\n86\n00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.190\nmonitoring points that are being used to\nbe able to look in on the application from\n\n87\n00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.170\nthe perspective of the user outside of the\nhosted stack internal to the data center.\n\n88\n00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.370\nAnd by using this global monitoring\ncapability, we're able to look at\n\n89\n00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.260\nweb services and get real time information\nabout how they're responding from\n\n90\n00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.130\ndifferent geographies, and then be able\nto keep continuous monitoring of them.\n\n91\n00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.680\nGot a lot of customers\nin the hosting space and\n\n92\n00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.430\nthe e-commerce space that\nare using this exact technology.\n\n93\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.700\nBecause it's so critical for them, not\njust to see the inbound performance and\n\n94\n00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.210\nthe behind-the-scenes\nperformance separately, but\n\n95\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.620\nto see them both in real time and\nsee what customers and users are seeing,\n\n96\n00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.090\nwhich has been a struggle in certain\nversions of the product and the platform.\n\n97\n00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.880\nWe have competitive products\nthat do a lot of this.\n\n98\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.120\nSolarWinds has a great set of\ntools out there that do this.\n\n99\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.710\nAnd many of the other vendors, HP, IBM,\nall have Stack Monitoring that can do\n\n100\n00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.320\nthis, Microsoft's fully integrated and\ncan do this as well.\n\n101\n00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.620\nSo we're gonna see all of this and all\nthese concerns or rather capabilities that\n\n102\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.475\nwe use to address concerns are being met\nin this product and continuing to evolve.\n\n103\n00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:32.050\nIf we take a look real quick on the web,\nwhat we'll find\n\n104\n00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.960\nis another one of those tech net sites\nI told you we'd take you out to.\n\n105\n00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.510\nWhat's new in System Center 2012 R2.\n\n106\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.220\nWe've got all of the things that I\nmentioned here, fabric monitoring,\n\n107\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.480\nfabric health dashboards for the Azure\npublic/private cloud, integration.\n\n108\n00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.820\nWe've got fabric monitoring diagram view.\n\n109\n00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.430\nWe can actually see the on-prem view\nof our infrastructure laid out.\n\n110\n00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.540\nA visio like diagram, if you will but\ninteractive, we can click on and\n\n111\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.250\nsee what's happening.\n\n112\n00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.750\nIt updates in real time, so\nthat's gonna be interesting.\n\n113\n00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.540\nThe SCOM agent has been renamed\nthe Microsoft Monitoring Agent\n\n114\n00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.600\nas we go into 12 R2.\n\n115\n00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.090\nSo just reminding ourselves of that\n\n116\n00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.960\nthroughout our discussions\nwill be important.\n\n117\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.460\nBut the Microsoft monitoring\nagent brings in that APM,\n\n118\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.505\nthat Application Performance Monitoring\ncapability I was mentioning for\n\n119\n00:06:13.505 --> 00:06:14.680\n.NET and Java.\n\n120\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.360\nSo we see that is one of\nthe new features there.\n\n121\n00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.170\nWe're seeing the integration\nof the OpsManager\n\n122\n00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.840\nwith the dev process\nof the DevOps concept.\n\n123\n00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.780\nWhere we can go in, interact with,\nintegrate with TFS, as I mentioned.\n\n124\n00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.820\nThis is really one of the big,\n\n125\n00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.015\nbig things that's happening in our\nindustry in general right now.\n\n126\n00:06:32.015 --> 00:06:36.805\nIt's this idea of DevOps, the Development\nOperations nexus where these two interact.\n\n127\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.310\nTaking the dev team and\ngetting their input, their buy in,\n\n128\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.870\ntheir workflow and connecting\nit to the ops side of the house.\n\n129\n00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.070\nWhere we have the ability to monitor,\ninteract, manage,\n\n130\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.930\nmaintain control and optimize systems, and\ngetting those two departments that really\n\n131\n00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.450\ntypically would butt heads and not work\nwell together, to talk to each other and\n\n132\n00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.930\ndraw from each other's experience to\nbetter optimize the stack top to bottom.\n\n133\n00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.760\nThat's what DevOps really does.\n\n134\n00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.414\nYou ought to know if when you were\ndoing your time at the farm bureau and\n\n135\n00:07:09.414 --> 00:07:13.887\nsome of the other places you've been, as\nwe've been talking, and back then I would\n\n136\n00:07:13.887 --> 00:07:18.254\nthink that DevOps really wasn't the\nconcept per se, it wasn't defined as such.\n\n137\n00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:20.438\nBut was there this eternal\nstruggle between dev or\n\n138\n00:07:20.438 --> 00:07:23.090\nwhatever dev would have been,\nand the ops side of the house,\n\n139\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.503\nI'm thinking you probably have seen\nthat in various places you've been.\n\n140\n00:07:26.503 --> 00:07:30.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because the dev guys knew\nnothing about systems whatsoever.\n\n141\n00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.325\nThey just thought it was some-\n&gt;&gt; Or though they did.\n\n142\n00:07:32.325 --> 00:07:37.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they were at least\ncomplacent in their ignorance,\n\n143\n00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.160\nthey said yes, I don't know how this\nworks just push the magic button so\n\n144\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.474\nthat I have a server and\nI can start developing on it.\n\n145\n00:07:42.474 --> 00:07:47.372\nAnd you're like, it's not quite that easy\nit's gonna take me, especially back then,\n\n146\n00:07:47.372 --> 00:07:51.029\nwhere we didn't have things where\nyou could just spin up a server,\n\n147\n00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:52.356\ncloud type of spin ups.\n\n148\n00:07:52.356 --> 00:07:56.374\nOr I just say I want this with this\nplatform and okay, you're ready to go.\n\n149\n00:07:56.374 --> 00:08:00.546\nBecause now DevOps is a thing they want\nCompanies nowaday want you to be jack of\n\n150\n00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:03.900\nall trades,\nwear every stinking hat in the field.\n\n151\n00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.790\nI want you to do web,\n\n152\n00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.730\nI want you to do servers, I want you to do\nnetworking, I want you to do development.\n\n153\n00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.380\nAnd so that's the way it's going.\n\n154\n00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.000\nBut back then, no,\nwe had to fight with each other.\n\n155\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.114\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so this, and\nthat's very traditional.\n\n156\n00:08:15.114 --> 00:08:17.460\nI mean, you ask anybody who's\nbeen doing this long enough,\n\n157\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.757\nthey're gonna to tell you that.\n\n158\n00:08:18.757 --> 00:08:22.370\nAnd that might even, by the way,\nstill be the case in your environment.\n\n159\n00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.940\nIn other words, in your businesses,\n\n160\n00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.910\nyou may still be struggling\nwith this exact thing.\n\n161\n00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.870\nMany of my customers, many of my clients\nare trying to figure this piece out\n\n162\n00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.880\nbecause the concept has been around for\na while.\n\n163\n00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.150\nWe feared people talking about DevOps for\nseveral years now.\n\n164\n00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.000\nBut to implement a thought process\nthat actually brings development and\n\n165\n00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.670\noperations together.\n\n166\n00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:45.410\nAnd really allows them to\ncommunicate information broadly and\n\n167\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.880\neffectively, help each other to make\nthe system, the stack, the organization,\n\n168\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.630\nthe enterprise architecture better, more\nrobust, more efficient, more resilient.\n\n169\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.070\nAll things Daniel was just talking\nabout that weren't working well, right,\n\n170\n00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.420\nwhen those two sites in house\ndon't talk to each other.\n\n171\n00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.706\nIs a significant challenge, it's\na culture shift in an organization and\n\n172\n00:09:03.706 --> 00:09:04.501\nit can take time.\n\n173\n00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:07.780\nAnd it's not just about the culture\nit's about the tools that stand up,\n\n174\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.080\nthe systems to be able to enable\nthe culture to work the right way.\n\n175\n00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.720\nGood news is we've got those tools, right?\n\n176\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.900\nMicrosoft and\nmany other vendors, to be fair.\n\n177\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.780\nBut certainly Microsoft for many,\n\n178\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.830\nmany years has been moving\ntowards this thought process.\n\n179\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.230\nIn some respects,\nmore successful than in others.\n\n180\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.105\nBut ultimately we're making our way there,\nas everybody else in the industry is.\n\n181\n00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:29.450\nSystem Center's a great suite of products\nthat helps us to bridge this gap.\n\n182\n00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:30.840\nAnd as we've talked about already and\n\n183\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.175\nwe'll continue to talk about, the ability\nto link these two things together.\n\n184\n00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:39.525\nThe monitoring and the optimization\nthrough action and alerting into other\n\n185\n00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:45.125\nproducts like TFS in the extended stack is\nreally where this idea of DevOps comes in.\n\n186\n00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:46.378\nSo that's going to be exciting and\ninteresting.\n\n187\n00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:49.583\nIf we can go back for just a minute,\njust continue walking down there\n\n188\n00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:52.634\nreal quick just to highlight some\nof the things we talked about.\n\n189\n00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:56.838\nWe talked about APM and the integration\nof IntelliTrace with the TFS tie-ins,\n\n190\n00:09:56.838 --> 00:09:58.100\nI mentioned that.\n\n191\n00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.473\nAnother biggie, although a lot\nof you may not be doing this.\n\n192\n00:10:00.473 --> 00:10:04.202\nBut support for IPv6 has been set up and\n\n193\n00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:10.140\nwe now are able to fully take\nadvantage of the IPv6 stack.\n\n194\n00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.711\nYou know I talk to a lot of customers,\na lot of students, a lot of people.\n\n195\n00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:15.422\nAnd a lot of them are not\nusing IPv6 fully or\n\n196\n00:10:15.422 --> 00:10:18.220\neven partially other than just by default.\n\n197\n00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.050\nBecause it's supporting natively\nin our operating systems now.\n\n198\n00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.400\nSo it's kind of there, but\n\n199\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.020\nthey're not going out of their\nway to really deploy and use it.\n\n200\n00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.160\nBut more and more,\n\n201\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.990\nIPv6 is becoming a standard that\nmany companies are moving towards.\n\n202\n00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.970\nWe fully integrated and\n\n203\n00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.800\nsupport it across all the systems\nin our products these days.\n\n204\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.015\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n205\n00:10:36.015 --> 00:10:37.181\nGonna be important for\n\n206\n00:10:37.181 --> 00:10:41.510\nus potentially if we're looking to\nupgrade and/or update our capabilities.\n\n207\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.010\nTalked about Unix and Linux monitoring,\ntalked about System Center Advisor,\n\n208\n00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.120\ntalked about Java monitoring before.\n\n209\n00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.721\nAnd we've gone through and discuss what\nall these particular parts and pieces are.\n\n210\n00:10:50.721 --> 00:10:54.210\nBut I just wanted to show you where\nyou can find these on the web.\n\n211\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.142\nThe other things I wanted to talk\nabout here and we'll bring up and\n\n212\n00:10:58.142 --> 00:10:59.705\nzoom in on just a wee bit.\n\n213\n00:10:59.705 --> 00:11:02.570\nLet me just see if we can,\nwhoops, that's the wrong way.\n\n214\n00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.390\nOkay, I guess backwards is-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.111\n&gt;&gt; Backwards is small, front is big.\n\n216\n00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:09.210\nLet me just zoom in a little bit more.\n\n217\n00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:13.039\nAnd what I want to do is just spend a few\nminutes talking about the architecture of\n\n218\n00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:16.082\na traditional System Center Ops Manager\ndeployment with you.\n\n219\n00:11:16.082 --> 00:11:20.390\nWhen we deploy System Center Ops Manager,\nwe got a bunch of different moving parts.\n\n220\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.880\nAnd the core components of SCOM when\nwe deploy them are referred to as\n\n221\n00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.830\na management group.\n\n222\n00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.268\nThis is the language that we use,\nmanagement group.\n\n223\n00:11:27.268 --> 00:11:32.615\nAnd the management group is made up of all\nthese different moving parts and pieces.\n\n224\n00:11:32.615 --> 00:11:35.511\nI'm actually very excited about\nthe diagram you're looking at,\n\n225\n00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:38.054\nbecause I actually can take credit for\ndrawing it myself.\n\n226\n00:11:38.054 --> 00:11:39.439\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I actually created this one.\n\n227\n00:11:39.439 --> 00:11:44.737\nUnlike some of the other shows we've\ndone where I've had to rely on the very,\n\n228\n00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:49.966\nvery kind and kind of facilitating help\nof some of our co-presenters here.\n\n229\n00:11:49.966 --> 00:11:53.510\nWho've been very, very kind in developing\ndiagrams for us to show you things with.\n\n230\n00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.614\nI actually-\n&gt;&gt; He's all grown up now.\n\n231\n00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:57.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am, I'm walking on my own two feet.\n\n232\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.510\nMuch like that picture\nyour daughter generated.\n\n233\n00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.578\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, crazy.\n&gt;&gt; The whole thing,\n\n234\n00:12:00.578 --> 00:12:01.650\nthat was just cool, right?\n\n235\n00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.288\nSo I actually can take credit for\nthis one, if you don't like it though,\n\n236\n00:12:04.288 --> 00:12:05.076\nthen Daniel made it.\n\n237\n00:12:05.076 --> 00:12:07.551\nIf you do like it, then-\n&gt;&gt; Email it at daniel@ itpro.tv, right?\n\n238\n00:12:07.551 --> 00:12:09.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let Daniel know if you don't\n\n239\n00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.640\nlike it too much.\n\n240\n00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.548\nBut no, but I did just put this together\nquickly, just to illustrate and\n\n241\n00:12:14.548 --> 00:12:18.280\nshow us some of the important moving\nparts and discuss them with you.\n\n242\n00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.550\nSo let's run through here.\n\n243\n00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.090\nWe have management servers.\n\n244\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.480\nThe management servers\nare pooled together right here.\n\n245\n00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.200\nThere is just a group of them\ninside this little oval that I used\n\n246\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.450\nto represent a resource pool.\n\n247\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.233\nWhich is the grouping of two or more,\nthree or more management servers together.\n\n248\n00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:36.300\nBut management server or\nservers we need multiples to be redundant.\n\n249\n00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.120\nSo as we scale up,\n\n250\n00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.460\nscale out, create load balancing\nacross the management server pool.\n\n251\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.750\nHigh availability and\n\n252\n00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.490\nredundancy in case of system failure,\nwe're gonna add these in.\n\n253\n00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:51.310\nIn old implementations of SCOM, prior\nversions, you would have had a different\n\n254\n00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.430\narchitecture and high availability\nwould have been a different approach.\n\n255\n00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.939\nToday we're replacing the concept,\nthe older concepts.\n\n256\n00:12:58.939 --> 00:13:01.995\nAnd we're going with all management\nservers instead of an RMS,\n\n257\n00:13:01.995 --> 00:13:03.304\na root management server.\n\n258\n00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:06.934\nWhich would have been kind of the tip\nof the pyramid, the hierarchy,\n\n259\n00:13:06.934 --> 00:13:11.510\nin the older SCOM implementations, and\nthen we would have been able to use that.\n\n260\n00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:15.044\nAnd then have other management servers\nwould have been linked to that in a,\n\n261\n00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.976\nalmost like a child-parent,\nor parent-child hierarchy.\n\n262\n00:13:17.976 --> 00:13:20.360\nLittle bit different,\nnow we've moved away from that.\n\n263\n00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.218\nAll management servers\nare essentially equal and\n\n264\n00:13:23.218 --> 00:13:27.430\nwe put them into a pool, call it\na resource pool, join them together.\n\n265\n00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:35.022\nWe load balance across them all of the,\nhelp me out here, what am I looking for?\n\n266\n00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:37.361\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All of the things we would be doing.\n\n267\n00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:40.453\nAll of the tasks, right,\nthat are gonna be running,\n\n268\n00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:42.740\nall of the capabilities we need, etc.\n\n269\n00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.550\nAnything that's going on,\nthe jobs, whatever it may be.\n\n270\n00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.391\nThat's all spread across all\nthe management service in the pool.\n\n271\n00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:50.150\nKnowledge of them is\navailable to all of them.\n\n272\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.520\nSo if one were to fail,\n\n273\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.190\nwe can just pick up with those\nthings across the surviving members.\n\n274\n00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.910\nAnd we have scalability,\nwe have high availability as a result.\n\n275\n00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.260\nSo management servers,\ncommunication channel.\n\n276\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.050\nIs being provided between\nthe Ops Manager database and\n\n277\n00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:07.122\nthe managed computers in the management\ngroup through the management server.\n\n278\n00:14:07.122 --> 00:14:09.840\nWe'll see the Ops Manager\ndatabase over here.\n\n279\n00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.770\nI'm using the wrong computer\nto move around with.\n\n280\n00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.170\nThe Ops Manager database\nis sitting off to the side.\n\n281\n00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.020\nWe have two databases with Ops Manager.\n\n282\n00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.130\nWe have the Ops Manager database, and\n\n283\n00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.870\nwe have the Ops Manager\ndata warehouse database.\n\n284\n00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.563\nSo we're gonna keep track of data in\ndifferent places for different reasons.\n\n285\n00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:29.558\nTwo main databases, Ops Manager database\nis where we store all the data coming in\n\n286\n00:14:29.558 --> 00:14:34.493\nthat's being used for real-time\nmonitoring, configuration information.\n\n287\n00:14:34.493 --> 00:14:36.079\nThings like that are moving through there.\n\n288\n00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:39.490\nThe data warehouse is where we have\nreporting capabilities running.\n\n289\n00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:44.008\nWe can do longer term storage,\nwe also have analytics capability.\n\n290\n00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:45.058\nThere's a lot of different\nstuff that goes on.\n\n291\n00:14:45.058 --> 00:14:48.860\nWe'll delve more into the functions\nof those databases over time.\n\n292\n00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.460\nBut we've got those two main ones.\n\n293\n00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.599\nWe'll talk about\nSQL Server AlwaysOn technology,\n\n294\n00:14:53.599 --> 00:14:55.678\nin some of our episodes coming up.\n\n295\n00:14:55.678 --> 00:14:59.264\nWhere we talk about high availability and\nhow we can control those databases,\n\n296\n00:14:59.264 --> 00:15:01.720\nensure that they're set up and\nthey're optimized.\n\n297\n00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.203\nSo that way, if we have a failure,\n\n298\n00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:05.722\nwe've got the ability to be\nable to survive that failure.\n\n299\n00:15:05.722 --> 00:15:10.060\nSo a lot of cool things going\non in the technology stack.\n\n300\n00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.670\nWe've got agents,\nyou could see them deployed down here.\n\n301\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.833\nThese boxes right here.\n\n302\n00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:19.450\nLet me just zoom out real quick so\nyou can see that for just a second.\n\n303\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.310\nAre labeled as agents as well.\n\n304\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:25.730\nAgents are gonna be the monitoring agent,\nthe piece of software that we install\n\n305\n00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.170\non the server or on the endpoint\nthat we're looking to monitor.\n\n306\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.824\nAnd then have that report in,\non an ongoing basis,\n\n307\n00:15:31.824 --> 00:15:36.348\nuploading information into the management\nservers through there into the database.\n\n308\n00:15:36.348 --> 00:15:38.919\nAnd then making it available for\nboth reporting and\n\n309\n00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:41.800\nthrough the consoles up the upper left,\nfor us to use.\n\n310\n00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.109\nWe install agents on computers that\nare gonna be monitored, in other words.\n\n311\n00:15:45.109 --> 00:15:49.708\nWe do have Windows, Unix, and\nLinux-based systems that we can monitor so\n\n312\n00:15:49.708 --> 00:15:52.780\nthose agents could be any or\nall of those running.\n\n313\n00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.100\nI didn't label them Windows,\nLinux, Unix but\n\n314\n00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.189\nJust imagine we have a mixture of servers.\n\n315\n00:15:57.189 --> 00:16:01.190\nAnd those servers are running any of\nthose combination of operating systems.\n\n316\n00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.046\nWe have agents appropriate for\nall of them.\n\n317\n00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:06.860\nSo we can do that when we\nare deploying and monitoring.\n\n318\n00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.140\nWe then will be able to\npick up Information and\n\n319\n00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.290\ncoordinate that information\nthrough the databases.\n\n320\n00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.400\nReporting we know.\n\n321\n00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.930\nAs I said, we do have reporting.\n\n322\n00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.740\nReporting services sitting up here.\n\n323\n00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.650\nSQL Server Reporting Services,\nSSRS, is deployed.\n\n324\n00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.640\nWe're gonna have that\nrunning as a service.\n\n325\n00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.299\nAnd then using that service\non the reporting server,\n\n326\n00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:27.265\nwe're then gonna be able to\npull data out of the databases.\n\n327\n00:16:27.265 --> 00:16:30.824\nYou could see them sitting, and there's\nkind of a arrow indicating a flow and\n\n328\n00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:31.770\na connection.\n\n329\n00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.158\nWe're gonna be able to run reports,\npull that information together,\n\n330\n00:16:35.158 --> 00:16:37.480\nand then use those reports\nthrough the console.\n\n331\n00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.984\nRight over here, the set of consoles.\n\n332\n00:16:38.984 --> 00:16:43.310\nThe ops [INAUDIBLE] web console,\nto consume and to understand information.\n\n333\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.730\nSo we'll be able to go in,\ntake a look at that.\n\n334\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.470\nSo we have two different kinds of\nconsoles that are running there.\n\n335\n00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.870\nWe have the Ops Console, which is the\nmanagement console we traditionally use.\n\n336\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.183\nThink of a traditional MMC like console,\nthat's what what would be.\n\n337\n00:16:55.183 --> 00:16:58.538\nAnd then the web console, as the name\nimplies, over the web being used,\n\n338\n00:16:58.538 --> 00:17:00.310\ndifferent set of functionality.\n\n339\n00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.100\nThe Ops Console is the one we use\nprimarily to do administration.\n\n340\n00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.700\nWeb console is what we would typically\ndelegate to users that have to interact,\n\n341\n00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.010\nconsume information.\n\n342\n00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.100\nAnd use it remotely.\n\n343\n00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.860\nSo we'll let them login securely\nover the web to do that.\n\n344\n00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:12.640\nSo we'll have that.\n\n345\n00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.730\nWe have management packs.\n\n346\n00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.060\nI didn't put them on here.\n\n347\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:20.645\nBut the management packs would sit and be\ndeployed on the management servers here.\n\n348\n00:17:20.645 --> 00:17:23.333\nAnd we would then be able to\ninteract them, administer them and\n\n349\n00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:25.350\nmaintain them through the ops console.\n\n350\n00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:30.030\nAnd the management packs are going to be\nthose pre-configured and/or customized\n\n351\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.510\ncollections of settings that\nwe use to do the monitoring.\n\n352\n00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.600\nSo the monitors themselves, the tasks,\n\n353\n00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.160\nthe views, the reports, the rules, all the\ncomponent parts that make up management\n\n354\n00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.380\npacks will be brought to bear there.\n\n355\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.522\nWe have a whole bunch of management packs\nthat we either download from Microsoft or\n\n356\n00:17:46.522 --> 00:17:48.211\nget from third-party vendors.\n\n357\n00:17:48.211 --> 00:17:50.573\nSo, as I said, we have some for VMware,\n\n358\n00:17:50.573 --> 00:17:53.570\nwe can monitor VMware\ninfrastructure using SCOM.\n\n359\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:57.300\nHorizon View in particular, the VDI\nsolution that VMware has in market,\n\n360\n00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.660\nwe can do that.\n\n361\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.850\nWe have the ability to monitor HP and\n\n362\n00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.770\nIBM infrastructure, extension\nmanagement packs from those vendors.\n\n363\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.710\nSo lots of third party vendors\nwill put out management packs.\n\n364\n00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.680\nWe also have the ability and Microsoft\nputs out a great number of them for\n\n365\n00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.946\nour own infrastructure to monitor\nacross the entire Microsoft stacks.\n\n366\n00:18:15.946 --> 00:18:20.865\nSo, databases with SQL,\nenterprise content management\n\n367\n00:18:20.865 --> 00:18:25.935\nsystems with SharePoint,\nweb services, directory services.\n\n368\n00:18:25.935 --> 00:18:28.625\nWe can monitor messaging platforms, so\n\n369\n00:18:28.625 --> 00:18:33.055\nExchange, we monitor cloud-based systems,\nso Office 365.\n\n370\n00:18:33.055 --> 00:18:35.375\nAll those things online, Azure.\n\n371\n00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:37.710\nWe have management packs\nacross the entire stack.\n\n372\n00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.790\nSo we download those, either from\nMicrosoft or from a third party vendor, or\n\n373\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.100\na combination of both.\n\n374\n00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.540\nMany of them are free.\n\n375\n00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.720\nOccasionally you may have to spend some\nmoney with a vendor to be able to get\n\n376\n00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.750\ntheir management pack.\n\n377\n00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.330\nTypically indirectly cuz you\nlicense their products and then\n\n378\n00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:55.700\nyou get the management pack in order to\nrun them and then you either import them.\n\n379\n00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.510\nSo you'll either download them and\nimport them from disks on the local\n\n380\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.580\nmachine somewhere or\nyou can import them from the catalog.\n\n381\n00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.070\nA web-based website,\nthe Microsoft web-based website,\n\n382\n00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.480\nbecause that's not redundant, right?\n\n383\n00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.780\nA website that Microsoft maintains\ncalled the management pack catalog.\n\n384\n00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.980\nSystem Center management pack catalog.\n\n385\n00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:11.703\nAnd we go out and\n\n386\n00:19:11.703 --> 00:19:15.340\nwe download those management packs\ndirectly if we're connected to the web.\n\n387\n00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.280\nSo we have options, we do that either way.\n\n388\n00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.880\nWe could also create our\nown management packs,\n\n389\n00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.200\nwe'll take a look at how to\ndo that in upcoming episodes.\n\n390\n00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.370\nBut we'll essentially right-click new\nmanagement pack in the ops console,\n\n391\n00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.030\nthe administration space.\n\n392\n00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.590\nWe'll go to the management pack item.\n\n393\n00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:30.117\nWe'll right click.\n\n394\n00:19:30.117 --> 00:19:31.600\nWe'll create a new management pack.\n\n395\n00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.850\nThat is a very simple process.\n\n396\n00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.100\nTakes about three steps.\n\n397\n00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.010\nAnd we just create a shell.\n\n398\n00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.750\nEssentially, just a container.\n\n399\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.030\nThat we call a management pack.\n\n400\n00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.390\nBut we don't populate it with\nanything in that first step.\n\n401\n00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.871\nWe just name it,\nwe may provide some knowledge,\n\n402\n00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:45.782\nsome detailed descriptions of what it is,\nand we hit OK.\n\n403\n00:19:45.782 --> 00:19:48.727\nAnd then it's created as what's\ncalled an unsealed management pack,\n\n404\n00:19:48.727 --> 00:19:50.550\na management pack we can modify.\n\n405\n00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.360\nManagement packs we download from\nvendors are traditionally sealed.\n\n406\n00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.750\nThey have little lock on them,\n\n407\n00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.880\nyou can tell the difference\nwhen you look in the console.\n\n408\n00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.300\nAnd the idea is that those have to\nbe modified by creating a copy,\n\n409\n00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.200\na secondary management pack that's open,\nunsealed.\n\n410\n00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.656\nThat we put all the changes into or\n\n411\n00:20:06.656 --> 00:20:09.523\nthe overrides that we want to use\nagainst the management packet.\n\n412\n00:20:09.523 --> 00:20:11.563\nThis is language we'll come\nto talk more about and\n\n413\n00:20:11.563 --> 00:20:13.530\nbe more comfortable with over time.\n\n414\n00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.530\nBut when we create our own management\npacks, they're unsealed directly.\n\n415\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.320\nWe cannot operate on them without\nhaving to create a secondary copy.\n\n416\n00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.270\nAnd then, we go in and\nwe go to the authoring workspace and\n\n417\n00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.950\nagain we'll take a look at all this in\nupcoming episodes in the ops console.\n\n418\n00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:31.330\nAnd then, we go in to authoring and we\nstart to add in all of the various pieces\n\n419\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.750\nthat we wanna add to the management pack\nand we'll walk through how to do this.\n\n420\n00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:39.080\nRight click new monitor, right click new\nrule, right click new task, new view,\n\n421\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.540\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n422\n00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.895\nAnd we add them in in the wizard that we\ngo through depending on the kind of thing\n\n423\n00:20:44.895 --> 00:20:46.240\nwe're doing, add in.\n\n424\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.491\nAnd one of the choices we make after we\nname it and we configure it early on is\n\n425\n00:20:49.491 --> 00:20:51.970\nwhat management pack do\nwe wanna associate with.\n\n426\n00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.350\nWe'll choose our management pack.\n\n427\n00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.099\nWe put all that stuff together and then\nthe container starts to fill up with all\n\n428\n00:20:57.099 --> 00:20:59.241\nthe objects that we're looking to create.\n\n429\n00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:02.727\nAnd this is really the strength,\nthe value, of this tool is\n\n430\n00:21:02.727 --> 00:21:07.472\ncreating the customized management pack\nsolution that we want to be able to use or\n\n431\n00:21:07.472 --> 00:21:09.230\nmodify an existing one.\n\n432\n00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.810\nTo be able to give us that exact scoped\nand tailored fixed capability that we're\n\n433\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.900\nlooking to achieve and\nto be able to hone in just on that.\n\n434\n00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.790\nSo we're gonna talk about\nhow all that happens.\n\n435\n00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.900\nBut that's gonna be one of the parts\nhere that we have to think about\n\n436\n00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.006\nas the management packs.\n\n437\n00:21:22.006 --> 00:21:25.280\nWe also have the aside from\nthe consoles that are sitting up there\n\n438\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.580\nwe also have the there's actually\ntwo other consoles I didn't mention.\n\n439\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.310\nThe application diagnostics and\napplication advisor consoles.\n\n440\n00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.650\nThose are also going to be used or\nat least can be used.\n\n441\n00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:40.050\nThose are going to provide us\ndetailed diagnostic capabilities for\n\n442\n00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.200\napplication monitoring.\n\n443\n00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.920\nWe'll get a little bit more into\nthose in an upcoming episode.\n\n444\n00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.730\nI just didn't label them and\nput them up on the diagram.\n\n445\n00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.040\nCuz they're not always used,\n\n446\n00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.640\ndepending on whether you're doing web\napplication transaction monitoring or not.\n\n447\n00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.687\nBut if you are, we have detailed\nconsults to let us do that as well.\n\n448\n00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:55.017\nBut the thing we haven't talked about yet\n\n449\n00:21:55.017 --> 00:21:57.200\nis this thing right over here\ncalled the gateway server.\n\n450\n00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.310\nThe gateway server is\nan interesting concept.\n\n451\n00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.786\nSo if we have a bunch of agents\nthat are all well-connected,\n\n452\n00:22:02.786 --> 00:22:04.772\nlet's define well-connected.\n\n453\n00:22:04.772 --> 00:22:06.631\nSo, play a game with me, sir, if you will.\n\n454\n00:22:06.631 --> 00:22:11.115\nWhen I say to you, well-connected, just\nin traditional network infrastructure,\n\n455\n00:22:11.115 --> 00:22:12.246\nwhat do you think of?\n\n456\n00:22:12.246 --> 00:22:14.869\nWhat are some of the, in your mind,\nsome of the rules, the concepts,\n\n457\n00:22:14.869 --> 00:22:15.635\nthe warning signs?\n\n458\n00:22:15.635 --> 00:22:18.406\nWe would think of if we talk\nabout a well connected network.\n\n459\n00:22:18.406 --> 00:22:23.086\n&gt;&gt; I think a well connected network would\nbe something that's physically connected\n\n460\n00:22:23.086 --> 00:22:27.437\nby a high bandwidth media, something\nget ethernet, something like that.\n\n461\n00:22:27.437 --> 00:22:29.518\n&gt;&gt; Right, so a minimum threshold, right?\n\n462\n00:22:29.518 --> 00:22:31.180\nHigh is a relative term.\n\n463\n00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.680\nHigh bandwidth, but let's say low latency\nmay be another way of thinking about that\n\n464\n00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.280\nwhich would essentially be the same thing.\n\n465\n00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.610\nAnd that's the terminology we\nactually use in our documentation.\n\n466\n00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.200\nLow latency networks are what we talk\nabout, but as Daniel rightly said,\n\n467\n00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.210\nessentially dedicated high bandwidth or\nconsistent bandwidth,\n\n468\n00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.390\nalways on,\ngood connectivity is what we look for.\n\n469\n00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:54.310\nOne of the most important concepts you\nhave to learn how to manage, master,\n\n470\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.340\ndefine, and understand how to use and\ndeploy against.\n\n471\n00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.960\nThis is the idea of creating low latency\nnetworks to optimize the architecture.\n\n472\n00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.531\nAnd so when we think about creating\nwell connected systems with SCOM or\n\n473\n00:23:06.531 --> 00:23:10.221\nacross any of our infrastructure in\nMicrosoft, and indeed any vendor,\n\n474\n00:23:10.221 --> 00:23:11.638\nit's not just Microsoft.\n\n475\n00:23:11.638 --> 00:23:16.030\nBut especially here, we often refer to\nlow latency networks as being important\n\n476\n00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:20.470\nbecause the low latency concept allows\nthe machines that have agents on them to\n\n477\n00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.280\nintact with the management\nservers directly, and\n\n478\n00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.200\nto communicate with them in real time.\n\n479\n00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.728\nIf we don't have reliable\nconsistent band width,\n\n480\n00:23:27.728 --> 00:23:31.790\nthe agents will catch data on the local\nmachines until they can report back up.\n\n481\n00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:36.419\nIf we lose a management server and there's\na failure in the redundancy portion of our\n\n482\n00:23:36.419 --> 00:23:39.563\nfabric, we'll continue to monitor and\ncache locally.\n\n483\n00:23:39.563 --> 00:23:42.557\nAnd then we have to reconnect at\nsome point and upload all that data.\n\n484\n00:23:42.557 --> 00:23:45.540\nBut over time that's gonna grow to\nbecome a burden on the machine.\n\n485\n00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.217\nSo we wanna try to keep redundancy there.\n\n486\n00:23:49.217 --> 00:23:52.320\nThink about latency and\nminimize the amount of latency there is.\n\n487\n00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.292\nSo we go back to the diagram.\n\n488\n00:23:53.292 --> 00:23:56.971\nThe idea here would be that with\nwell-connected networks, so the agents,\n\n489\n00:23:56.971 --> 00:24:00.879\nlet's say, that are directly over here if\nwe think of them behind the firewall On\n\n490\n00:24:00.879 --> 00:24:04.974\nwhatever the corporate LAN would be in\nthe data center, whatever that represents.\n\n491\n00:24:04.974 --> 00:24:08.824\nThese are connecting directly up\nto the management server pool,\n\n492\n00:24:08.824 --> 00:24:13.164\nbecause there is low latency and we don't\nneed to use a proxy of some kind or\n\n493\n00:24:13.164 --> 00:24:17.930\na gateway that will connect on their\nbehalf and facilitate communication.\n\n494\n00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.410\nBut when they're outside the agents that\nare being monitored over here, as they\n\n495\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.810\nare in this diagram, the firewall in\na remote site somewhere, however they're\n\n496\n00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:30.870\nconnected, but we may not have reliable\nlow latency bandwidth that's consistent.\n\n497\n00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:34.930\nIf we have five or more of those machines\nthat have to be monitored in a geography,\n\n498\n00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:39.120\nthat's our magic number five in this case,\nthen recommendation is, hey,\n\n499\n00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.880\nlet's put a gateway server out there.\n\n500\n00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.840\nThe gateway server's going to\nfacilitate communication with all of\n\n501\n00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.510\nthose remotely managed agents.\n\n502\n00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.590\nThose agents will communicate\nthrough the gateway.\n\n503\n00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.170\nThe gateway will then be responsible for\nbatching that communication back\n\n504\n00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:56.340\nthrough whatever the firewall and or\nother connectivity systems will be.\n\n505\n00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:00.820\nGetting into the management server pool\nand then facilitating communication.\n\n506\n00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.280\nSo the gateway server is gonna\nbe very important cuz we A,\n\n507\n00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.070\nneed to worry about low latency, B,\nif there's no Kerberos authentication.\n\n508\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.660\nEssentially these are remote\nmachines outside the domain\n\n509\n00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.640\nthat are not directly connected or in a\ndifferent domain that doesn't have a trust\n\n510\n00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.090\nrelationship through federation or\nsomehow an exchange of that trust.\n\n511\n00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:23.280\nThen we need to use the gateway server\nto act on behalf of those agents,\n\n512\n00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.430\ngonna be very important.\n\n513\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:28.790\nWe use mutual authentication through the\ngateway to facilitate this communication.\n\n514\n00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.920\nThe gateway server is gonna have\na certificate installed from\n\n515\n00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.290\nthe management server pool.\n\n516\n00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.080\nAnd we're gonna be able to mutually\nauthenticate across this divide\n\n517\n00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.140\nhere, right?\n\n518\n00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.440\nIf I do that fast enough,\nthe firewall option goes away,\n\n519\n00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.700\nand it looks like I'm\ncommunicating in real-time.\n\n520\n00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.780\nBut we're going to implement\na communication pathway that's secure for\n\n521\n00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:49.150\nthe use of PKI, Public Key Infrastructure\nDigital Certificates being deployed.\n\n522\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.420\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe need a trusted CA.\n\n523\n00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.030\nTypically, these are self-signed\ninternally issued\n\n524\n00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.590\ncertificates to the domain.\n\n525\n00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.630\nSo we're going to be\nable to have our domain,\n\n526\n00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.470\nlet's say our LDAP provider over\nhere somewhere, issue certificates,\n\n527\n00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.980\nemploy them and\nset them up on the gateway server, and\n\n528\n00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.570\nthen create a trust relationship that can\nauthenticate the gateway back in, and then\n\n529\n00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:13.120\nas a result of that, when we implement the\ngateway server and the management server\n\n530\n00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.990\nrelationship through these certificates,\nwe're then able to communicate securely.\n\n531\n00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:20.900\nAnd the gateway can then act as that\ntrusted communication hub for all\n\n532\n00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.920\nthe external agents that are not domain\njoined and are at a low latency area.\n\n533\n00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.130\nSo this removes the need to install\nthe certificate on every agent,\n\n534\n00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.040\nwhich is nice cuz we don't\nhave to go through and\n\n535\n00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.540\ndeploy certificates out to all these\nmachines, deploy it to one central area,\n\n536\n00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.430\nand then we just connect all\nthe agents up through the gateway, so\n\n537\n00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.730\nit's a much smoother, much cleaner\ntransition to a managed infrastructure.\n\n538\n00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.400\nSo this thought process is new to 2012 R2.\n\n539\n00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.620\nAs I said,\nwe did different things in prior versions.\n\n540\n00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.300\nA little bit cleaner,\n\n541\n00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.970\na little bit easier, little bit more\nstreamlined as a result of that.\n\n542\n00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.570\nAnd it's easier for us,\nas administrators, as architects,\n\n543\n00:26:55.570 --> 00:27:00.010\nas managers, as implementors, people that\nare gonna build this infrastructure,\n\n544\n00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.900\nto be able to deploy successfully\nout of the gate the first time\n\n545\n00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.280\ncuz we're not messing around with all\nof these concerns and issues, and\n\n546\n00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.230\nopening up a lot of different pathways,\nand installing certificates, and all that.\n\n547\n00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.910\nNow, there is a fairly\ndetailed list of ports and\n\n548\n00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:17.100\nfirewall communication\nthat has to take place.\n\n549\n00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.360\nWe will take a look at this, and talk\nmore about this in an upcoming episode.\n\n550\n00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.270\nIt is a long laundry list,\nI don't to kid you.\n\n551\n00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.100\nThere's a lot of ports.\n\n552\n00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.580\n57, 23, and 24, for instance,\nare gonna be big on that list.\n\n553\n00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.500\nWe're going to talk about\nsome others that are there.\n\n554\n00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.480\nBut it's a doable list.\n\n555\n00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.830\nIt's a manageable list.\n\n556\n00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.160\nAnd it's only really critical if you're\ncommunicating from the outside in.\n\n557\n00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.480\nIf you're on the inside behind\nthe firewall on the LAN.\n\n558\n00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.590\nThese ports are in play.\n\n559\n00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.560\nYou want to know them, so you can monitor\ntraffic and understand what you're seeing.\n\n560\n00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.160\nBut the reality is,\n\n561\n00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.220\nyou're probably not worried about\npassing a lot of this traffic.\n\n562\n00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.180\nBecause firewalls are not\nbeing used traditionally\n\n563\n00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.750\nbetween segments of our network.\n\n564\n00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:55.430\nThere are holistic solutions that do use\nfirewalls to create protection enclaves,\n\n565\n00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.870\nand carve out secure areas of networks.\n\n566\n00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.700\nAnd I work with that kind of\ninfrastructure a lot, government and\n\n567\n00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.930\nmilitary networks, for\ninstance, are doing this.\n\n568\n00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:07.070\nSo we do wanna know what those firewall\nports are to make sure we can pass them.\n\n569\n00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.860\nYou may be running firewalls\non the local machines,\n\n570\n00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.840\nthe agent-based machines\nthat are being monitored.\n\n571\n00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.700\nWe may need to open traffic\nthere to allow communication.\n\n572\n00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.740\nSo it will be important\nto be aware of that,\n\n573\n00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.700\nbut it's not unmanageable by any means.\n\n574\n00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.550\nIt's a fairly straightforward process and\n\n575\n00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:25.218\nas a result we have a pretty easy to\ndeploy, easy to manage architecture.\n\n576\n00:28:25.218 --> 00:28:28.930\nNow, correct me if I'm wrong sir,\nbut that picture that I created,\n\n577\n00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.300\nwe're gonna have digitally\nsigned autograph copies.\n\n578\n00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.619\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna make them available for\n\n579\n00:28:33.619 --> 00:28:34.240\neverybody, right?\n\n580\n00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'll sign anything you want.\n\n581\n00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.780\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna make that available for\nyou with the show nuts,\n\n582\n00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:38.320\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n583\n00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.100\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n&gt;&gt; They will be able to download that.\n\n584\n00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.620\nYou'll have just kind of a ready made,\ngeneric diagram you can refer to.\n\n585\n00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.610\nAnd if it's helpful just to throw\nit up on the wall and to say, yeah,\n\n586\n00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:50.110\nthat's what I'm doing as I'm studying or\nI'm applying to whatever, great.\n\n587\n00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.380\nAnd if it's of value to you, use it.\n\n588\n00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.030\nCan even tell people you made it yourself.\n\n589\n00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.530\nI won't come to your house and\ntell them otherwise but\n\n590\n00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:00.150\njust make sure that you understand that\nwhat I would see that diagram as being,\n\n591\n00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.350\nwhat I use it with customers to do,\nis to start talking about and\n\n592\n00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:07.950\nsketching out what we're looking to\ndesign, what are the issues that concerns.\n\n593\n00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.470\nIn other words,\n\n594\n00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:13.210\nI use it as a skeleton to sketch out what\nmy architecture is gonna look like and\n\n595\n00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:16.645\nI use it for my planning cycles with\ncustomers to drive deployments.\n\n596\n00:29:16.645 --> 00:29:19.025\nBecause the picture\nhelps them to refer to,\n\n597\n00:29:19.025 --> 00:29:22.745\nand visually get a reference for\nthe architecture we're trying to build.\n\n598\n00:29:22.745 --> 00:29:24.435\nHopefully it'll do the same for you.\n\n599\n00:29:24.435 --> 00:29:27.545\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Adam, we'll have to take\none of those old 80s family photos\n\n600\n00:29:27.545 --> 00:29:29.405\nwhere it's the black background, and\n\n601\n00:29:29.405 --> 00:29:31.915\nour heads are just kind of floating,\nlooking off into the distance.\n\n602\n00:29:31.915 --> 00:29:32.765\nYou remember those?\n\n603\n00:29:32.765 --> 00:29:34.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; He knows the ones I'm talking about.\n\n604\n00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.500\nLook at this, that'll be fun.\n\n605\n00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.620\nBut I know you got a little bit more\nto go through on this very topic, but\n\n606\n00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.680\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n607\n00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.220\nSo it looks like we're gonna have to\nroll this into another part three.\n\n608\n00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:44.840\nThat'll be a lot of fun.\n\n609\n00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.150\nHopefully, we'll see you guys there.\n\n610\n00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.720\nThanks, Adam, for this so far.\n\n611\n00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.230\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n612\n00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.720\n&gt;&gt; But signing off

episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.570\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.662\nIn today's episode, that's right,\nas Adam has referred to-\n\n8\n00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:22.470\n&gt;&gt; Part three.\n\n9\n00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.942\n&gt;&gt; We are into a part three on\nan overview and architecture.\n\n10\n00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:29.707\nThings that we need to know to get started\ntalking about SCOM data center monitoring.\n\n11\n00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:31.413\nThat's what we're all about today.\n\n12\n00:00:31.413 --> 00:00:35.290\nAnd obviously, joining me in the studio\nis none other Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.945\nAdam, welcome back man.\n\n14\n00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:36.675\nHow's it going?\n\n15\n00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:37.642\n&gt;&gt; How do you, how do you.\n\n16\n00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:42.058\nIt is going well,\nit is cloudrific here at ITPro TV.\n\n17\n00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:44.461\nI would say data centertastic, but\nthat just would be over the cloud,\n\n18\n00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:44.961\nwould it not?\n\n19\n00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.264\n&gt;&gt; Cloudy with a chance of monitoring.\n\n20\n00:00:46.264 --> 00:00:46.945\n[LAUGH].\n\n21\n00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:48.867\n&gt;&gt; Cloudy with chance of monitoring,\nI like that.\n\n22\n00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:51.990\nSo, we're gonna continue our\nconversations as Daniel was suggesting.\n\n23\n00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.230\nWanna go back to that diagram\nwe had up in the prior episode.\n\n24\n00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.670\nBefore we do, just to remind you,\n\n25\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.680\nif you have not seen the last two\nepisodes in this particular series for\n\n26\n00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.655\nthe introduction, the overview and\narchitecture show.\n\n27\n00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:05.105\nBut if you have certainly, great,\nwe're gonna jump right back in.\n\n28\n00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:09.331\nIf you haven't, especially episode two,\nwe talked a lot about the architecture,\n\n29\n00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:13.276\nthe set up, the moving parts, and the\nbuilding blocks for how to deploy SCOM.\n\n30\n00:01:13.276 --> 00:01:16.042\nWhat a management group is,\nhow that all comes together.\n\n31\n00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:19.338\nEncourage you to take a look at that, only\ncuz you wanna be able to keep track of\n\n32\n00:01:19.338 --> 00:01:22.026\nwhat we're about to talk about\nnow to kind of build on that, and\n\n33\n00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:24.498\nknow where that diagram comes from and\nhow to explain it.\n\n34\n00:01:24.498 --> 00:01:27.237\nSo if you need to take a few moments,\ngo back maybe watch that first.\n\n35\n00:01:27.237 --> 00:01:28.521\nCome on back and join us afterwards.\n\n36\n00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:32.521\nGreat, if not then let's jump right in.\n\n37\n00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:34.473\nAwesome.\nI gotta figure out a way to do it\n\n38\n00:01:34.473 --> 00:01:36.827\nlike this, so that it-\n&gt;&gt; Remember, to your right.\n\n39\n00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:37.981\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can never get that right.\n\n40\n00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:40.367\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, so that's where we are.\n\n41\n00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.546\nSo, I wanted to bring up a few\nextra points about this.\n\n42\n00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:45.511\nWe didn't get quite a chance to\ncover in our last discussion,\n\n43\n00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:49.640\nwe had run out of time, so\nwe're doing so many cool things there.\n\n44\n00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.570\nBut we talked about the idea\nof the best practices,\n\n45\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.890\nthe low latency concept and using\nthe gateway server to help manage that.\n\n46\n00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.674\nWhat I wanted to bring out was\nthe idea of the resource pool here,\n\n47\n00:01:58.674 --> 00:01:59.980\nwho we've already spoken about.\n\n48\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.329\nThis is a generic resource\npool in the diagram,\n\n49\n00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.337\nit could be Windows infrastructure,\nit could be Linox or Unix infrastructure.\n\n50\n00:02:06.337 --> 00:02:12.377\nIt could be a set of, or monitoring what\nI mean to say, the management server.\n\n51\n00:02:12.377 --> 00:02:14.483\nSo, monitoring that\nkind of infrastructure.\n\n52\n00:02:14.483 --> 00:02:17.945\nCould be web infrastructure,\nweb applications, that kind of thing.\n\n53\n00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:22.642\nSo, the idea would be if we want to be\nable to bring together certain kinds\n\n54\n00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:25.106\nof infrastructure and monitor them,\n\n55\n00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:29.964\nwe may wanna create a resource pool\ndedicated for that kind of monitoring.\n\n56\n00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:32.834\nSo that way we have management\nservers dedicated just to\n\n57\n00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:34.673\nthat particular thought process.\n\n58\n00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:38.959\nSo, if this group of agent-based\nendpoints down here was a group of Unix,\n\n59\n00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.788\nLinux servers, this resource pool, or\nthis pool of resource management servers,\n\n60\n00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:45.980\nmay be dedicated to monitoring them.\n\n61\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.493\nAnd we may have a separate\npool dedicated to Windows.\n\n62\n00:02:48.493 --> 00:02:51.743\nSeparate pool dedicated to\nweb based infrastructure.\n\n63\n00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:55.652\nSo, just some things to think about\nthere from an architecture perspective.\n\n64\n00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:57.438\nWe don't wanna be shy, in other words,\n\n65\n00:02:57.438 --> 00:02:59.966\nabout trying to differentiate\nwhat we're monitoring.\n\n66\n00:02:59.966 --> 00:03:04.434\nAnd to be able to do so in a way that\nallows for high availability, redundancy,\n\n67\n00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:07.361\nand survivability in the case\nof a system failure.\n\n68\n00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:12.197\nBut by dedicating resource pools of\nmanagement servers to that infrastructure,\n\n69\n00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:15.349\nwe can then specifically\nunderstand how to manage and\n\n70\n00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.586\ndig through the data in\na little bit more relevant way.\n\n71\n00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:21.425\nAnd a little bit easier for us to keep\ntrack of, cuz we have our consoles that\n\n72\n00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:24.373\nwill connect, and we'll have the ability\nto be able to do that kind of stuff.\n\n73\n00:03:24.373 --> 00:03:26.891\nSo, just think about that.\n\n74\n00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.753\nIf we're coming from an older\nimplementation we will,\n\n75\n00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:34.041\nin upcoming episodes and\nsome upcoming shows,\n\n76\n00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:37.658\ntalk about the migration/upgrade\npath from SCOM,\n\n77\n00:03:37.658 --> 00:03:42.522\nlet's say 2007 install,\nand/or 2012, or 2012 SP1.\n\n78\n00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:47.732\nHow do we get up to 2012 R2, and how do\nwe run the most recent infrastructure?\n\n79\n00:03:47.732 --> 00:03:50.448\nWhat does that look like,\nwhat's that path look like?\n\n80\n00:03:50.448 --> 00:03:53.146\nAnd we'll talk about\nthe stair step approach\n\n81\n00:03:53.146 --> 00:03:57.193\nwhere we have to be installing and\nupgrading in a certain order, and\n\n82\n00:03:57.193 --> 00:04:01.030\nto a certain general platform build and\nthen moving from there.\n\n83\n00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.260\nSo we'll go through all that, but\n\n84\n00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.760\nthe idea is that we do have to worry about\nbackwards compatibility here as well.\n\n85\n00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.733\nIf we are running earlier versions of SCOM\nand we have management packs from the 2007\n\n86\n00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:15.590\ninstall, let's say, the RMS, the Root\nManagement Server is no longer available.\n\n87\n00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.060\nThat would have been the architectural\nthought process in 2007,\n\n88\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.938\nmentioned in the prior episode that we\nmoved away from that in favor of this idea\n\n89\n00:04:22.938 --> 00:04:26.614\nof grouping our management servers\ntogether equally in a resource pool.\n\n90\n00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:30.650\nAnd then spreading the load across\nthem through load balancing.\n\n91\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.330\nAnd so as a result,\nwe have a thing about how do we work with,\n\n92\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.420\nhow do we maintain backwards compatibility\nto those older systems, if necessary.\n\n93\n00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.641\nWe have a roll called the RMS emulator\nthat's gonna sit on these management\n\n94\n00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:44.659\nservers, that is available to us.\n\n95\n00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.423\nIt's on the first management\nserver that we install.\n\n96\n00:04:47.423 --> 00:04:49.357\nWe can move it around if necessary, but\n\n97\n00:04:49.357 --> 00:04:52.175\nit will be on the first new\nmanagement server we bring up.\n\n98\n00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:54.912\nSo, our first server will have\nthis role assigned to it.\n\n99\n00:04:54.912 --> 00:04:56.354\n&gt;&gt; Very Microsofty.\n\n100\n00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:57.136\n&gt;&gt; Very Microsofty.\n\n101\n00:04:57.136 --> 00:04:58.911\nIt's much like the FSMO roles,\n\n102\n00:04:58.911 --> 00:05:03.850\nFlexible Single Operation Master Roles in\nthe Windows Active Directory architecture.\n\n103\n00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.765\nI always wondered, by the way, right,\njust random aside/thought process here.\n\n104\n00:05:08.765 --> 00:05:12.934\nBut the acronym for the Flexible\nSingle Operation Master Role, FSMO,\n\n105\n00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:15.726\nF-S-M-O, is what we often hear people say.\n\n106\n00:05:15.726 --> 00:05:20.572\nFlexible single management operation\nis how you would pronounce FSMO.\n\n107\n00:05:20.572 --> 00:05:23.391\nIt should be FSOM,\nflexible single operation master.\n\n108\n00:05:23.391 --> 00:05:23.893\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n109\n00:05:23.893 --> 00:05:28.186\n&gt;&gt; If you think about it, F-S-O-M, would\nactually be the right way to think about\n\n110\n00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:31.923\nit, cuz the roles are called flexible\nsingle operation master roles,\n\n111\n00:05:31.923 --> 00:05:34.360\nnot flexible single master of operations.\n\n112\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.420\nSo, it's not actually\nFSMO it's actually FSOM.\n\n113\n00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.442\nBut every time I bring that up,\neverybody laughs at me and says.\n\n114\n00:05:40.442 --> 00:05:41.312\n&gt;&gt; You know what he's talking about.\n\n115\n00:05:41.312 --> 00:05:42.920\n&gt;&gt; Go back and\ntalk about something more important.\n\n116\n00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.582\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They don't wanna hear about that\n\n117\n00:05:44.582 --> 00:05:45.090\nkind of stuff.\n\n118\n00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.238\nBut it's just funny because that's\nthe traditional way we hear it pronounced,\n\n119\n00:05:49.238 --> 00:05:52.047\nthe way you see it in all\nthe Microsoft documentation.\n\n120\n00:05:52.047 --> 00:05:54.412\nThey talk about the FSMO Master Rolls,\nfive rolls.\n\n121\n00:05:54.412 --> 00:05:57.005\nBut they're actually FSOMs.\n\n122\n00:05:57.005 --> 00:05:59.071\n&gt;&gt; It's a brutal master, that tradition.\n\n123\n00:05:59.071 --> 00:06:02.148\nPeople get stuck into them, and\nit's hard to get out of it.\n\n124\n00:06:02.148 --> 00:06:06.122\n&gt;&gt; It is and it's one of those things,\nbut it's just one of those.\n\n125\n00:06:06.122 --> 00:06:06.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway,\n\n126\n00:06:06.907 --> 00:06:08.601\nwe're gonna actually get back to\nwhat we're here to talk about.\n\n127\n00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:09.499\n&gt;&gt; It's a splinter in your brain.\n\n128\n00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:11.191\n&gt;&gt; We're just gonna forget\nabout that whole thing and\n\n129\n00:06:11.191 --> 00:06:12.219\npretend I didn't mention it.\n\n130\n00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:14.515\nIt's totally irrelevant,\nas most things are that we talk about.\n\n131\n00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:15.731\nMore often than not.\n\n132\n00:06:15.731 --> 00:06:18.769\nAll right, so anyway, so the idea was,\nwe go back here for just a second,\n\n133\n00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:19.798\njust continue talking.\n\n134\n00:06:19.798 --> 00:06:22.091\nSo, the idea is that we\nhave this emulator role.\n\n135\n00:06:22.091 --> 00:06:26.603\nIt's gonna sit on the first server, and we\ncan obviously then go ahead and use that.\n\n136\n00:06:26.603 --> 00:06:30.026\nBy the way, if we do upgrade from 2007,\n\n137\n00:06:30.026 --> 00:06:34.016\nthe first server where\nthe RMS role was installed.\n\n138\n00:06:34.016 --> 00:06:36.906\nWhatever that was in\nthe 2007 architecture,\n\n139\n00:06:36.906 --> 00:06:41.046\nwould have this emulator role as\nwe upgrade through into 2012 R2.\n\n140\n00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:44.557\nSo, it's gonna be in a different place\ndepending on where you're coming from.\n\n141\n00:06:44.557 --> 00:06:48.050\nWe can move it between different\nmanagement servers using Power Shell.\n\n142\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.766\nThe command for\nit is get-scom management server.\n\n143\n00:06:53.766 --> 00:06:56.222\nWith a name parameter,\nyou would specify the name.\n\n144\n00:06:56.222 --> 00:07:00.022\nAnd then a pipe, and\npipe that to set SCOM emulator.\n\n145\n00:07:00.022 --> 00:07:03.400\nSo, we have two commands that\nhave essentially joined together.\n\n146\n00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.700\nThe command sequence itself\nis in the show notes,\n\n147\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.540\nyou'll be able to take\na look at it if you'd like.\n\n148\n00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.470\nBut we could do that if necessary to\nmove the RMS emulator role around.\n\n149\n00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.756\nWe can identify what machine\nwe wanna target it on, and\n\n150\n00:07:14.756 --> 00:07:16.358\nthen we can put if there if necessary.\n\n151\n00:07:16.358 --> 00:07:20.086\nSo may just be interesting for you,\nif you wanna see what the actual SCOM\n\n152\n00:07:20.086 --> 00:07:23.773\nemulator role is you can use the get\nSCOM emulator command to see that.\n\n153\n00:07:23.773 --> 00:07:27.114\nAnd you can interact with and just get\na list of what machine is there, or\n\n154\n00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:30.586\na listing of the machine that is\nalready currently inhabiting that role.\n\n155\n00:07:30.586 --> 00:07:32.375\nAnd then you can decide to\nmove it around if necessary.\n\n156\n00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:34.182\nSo, just a little word about that.\n\n157\n00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:37.406\nWe did talk about the whole idea\nof cloud-capable monitoring.\n\n158\n00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:41.335\nDaniel in the prior episode had actually\nasked about hey, what's the necessity,\n\n159\n00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:42.916\nwhat's the value proposition?\n\n160\n00:07:42.916 --> 00:07:47.593\nWhat is the thought process around using\nSCOM versus the Windows Azure fabric?\n\n161\n00:07:47.593 --> 00:07:51.392\nAnd why would we wanna choose to host\nlocally and use SCOM to do monitoring?\n\n162\n00:07:51.392 --> 00:07:54.348\nWe went ahead and we went through\nthat whole thought process.\n\n163\n00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:57.260\nTalked about private,\npublic cloud integration a little bit.\n\n164\n00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.113\nBut we can integrate SCOM,\nas I mentioned, with SCVMM,\n\n165\n00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:02.203\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n166\n00:08:02.203 --> 00:08:05.295\nAnd we could do that with\nthe management pack for VMM,\n\n167\n00:08:05.295 --> 00:08:08.253\nvirtual machine management\nfabric dashboard, so\n\n168\n00:08:08.253 --> 00:08:13.020\nwe have the ability to do full scale\nfull on monitoring of our private cloud.\n\n169\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.050\nWe can also do public cloud,\nas I mentioned, with the Azure management\n\n170\n00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.650\npack and the Windows Azure\napplication management as well.\n\n171\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.280\nWe can monitor and manage both in\nthe cloud and local infrastructure and\n\n172\n00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.400\ntie the two together.\n\n173\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.670\nSo that's nice just to\nremind ourselves of,\n\n174\n00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.700\nalthough we don't document\nit here on the diagram.\n\n175\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.960\nWe would have our management\npack installed on our\n\n176\n00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.180\nmanagement servers accessible\nthrough the ops console.\n\n177\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.064\nAs we talked about, in addition,\nwe would then be able to,\n\n178\n00:08:38.064 --> 00:08:41.814\nalthough we don't have a link out to\nthe web per se, but imagine there was some\n\n179\n00:08:41.814 --> 00:08:45.301\nsort of just a network link that goes\nout beyond the firewall over here.\n\n180\n00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:49.013\nAnd if we had the Windows Azure or the\nMicrosoft Azure cloud sitting out there,\n\n181\n00:08:49.013 --> 00:08:52.350\nwe would be able to pull infrastructure\ninto manage from that as well.\n\n182\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.490\nWe would have the appropriate management\npacks running, and we would then be able\n\n183\n00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.430\nto interact with both public and\nprivate clouds as necessary.\n\n184\n00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.382\nI talk about the idea a lot with\ncustomers, with students, with people that\n\n185\n00:09:02.382 --> 00:09:06.172\nI speak to about Systems Center in\ngeneral, but especially about SCOM.\n\n186\n00:09:06.172 --> 00:09:10.399\nThe idea of proactivity and the idea that\nproactivity is key to your successful\n\n187\n00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:13.100\narchitecture and\ndeployment in the data center.\n\n188\n00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.006\nI've talked about this in\nsome of the prior episodes,\n\n189\n00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:19.733\nwhere I talked about the idea of not\nonly one size fits one deployment,\n\n190\n00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:23.358\nthe idea of scoping and tailoring\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n191\n00:09:23.358 --> 00:09:27.967\nBut also that you need to be thinking\nproactively about how you're gonna use\n\n192\n00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:31.700\nthis tool, so\nthat you can monitor ahead of the curve.\n\n193\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.110\nUnderstand that there are things that can\ngo right or wrong on a regular basis and\n\n194\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.990\nthat a tool like SCOM can be used to help\nyou understand when things are starting to\n\n195\n00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.600\ngo wrong or\nwhen they continue to go right.\n\n196\n00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.280\nBut you have to pay attention\nto what the tool says.\n\n197\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.807\nDistributed application diagrams are a\ngreat example of proactive monitoring that\n\n198\n00:09:49.807 --> 00:09:51.026\nwe'll take a look at.\n\n199\n00:09:51.026 --> 00:09:55.045\nWe can view all the monitored components\nand the compartmentalized areas of\n\n200\n00:09:55.045 --> 00:09:59.330\nthe application stack, and we can see\nwhat's happening with them in real time.\n\n201\n00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.440\nAnd understand if things are healthy or\nnot healthy and\n\n202\n00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.610\nwhat that impact may be up and\ndown the stack.\n\n203\n00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.700\nSo that's one of the things\nyou wanna think about.\n\n204\n00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.100\nWe dynamically update that view to\nshow health and availability, so\n\n205\n00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.410\nwe can see in real time what's\nhappening there with our dashboards.\n\n206\n00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.900\nAlso synthetic transactions,\nanother thing that we wanna be aware of.\n\n207\n00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.650\nWe simulate end user\naccess to an application,\n\n208\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.950\nas I talked about in one of\nthe prior episodes as well.\n\n209\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.180\nWe could do global monitoring from\nmonitoring end points outside of\n\n210\n00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.350\nthe firewall, so\noutside in the public cloud.\n\n211\n00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.830\nBut we also can do synthetic\ntransaction monitoring,\n\n212\n00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.870\nwhere we make it look like a user's\nconnecting in and see what the user sees.\n\n213\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.720\nAnd so\nwe wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n214\n00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.580\nWe could do that from any location where\nthe ops manager agents are installed.\n\n215\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.350\nThe Microsoft monitoring agent is now\nwhat we were calling the ops manager\n\n216\n00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.250\nagent before.\n\n217\n00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.400\nSo we just wanna make sure\nwe're thinking about that.\n\n218\n00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.307\nBut the ability to do full stacks in\nsynthetic transaction monitoring and\n\n219\n00:10:53.307 --> 00:10:57.906\nglobal monitoring from key choke points,\nfrom monitoring end points with monitoring\n\n220\n00:10:57.906 --> 00:11:00.545\nagents installed back\ninto the data center.\n\n221\n00:11:00.545 --> 00:11:03.845\nTo examine that data flow from\nthe user's perspective is so\n\n222\n00:11:03.845 --> 00:11:08.315\ncrucial to organizations that have a\nglobal footprint that rely on web services\n\n223\n00:11:08.315 --> 00:11:12.155\nto be able to accurately represent, right,\nwhat's happening with them in real time.\n\n224\n00:11:12.155 --> 00:11:14.110\nThink of an ISP, think of Amazon.\n\n225\n00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.890\nThink of Google, think of anybody\nwho lives on the web, and that's to\n\n226\n00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.180\nunderstand what the user experience\nlooks like while they're using the web.\n\n227\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.460\nThis is what that kind of\na tool would be used for.\n\n228\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.480\nAnd this is one of the big\nvalue propositions,\n\n229\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.280\nright, that businesses are going for\nwith SCOM today.\n\n230\n00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.890\nThis is really where they see tremendous\nvalue in thinking about this.\n\n231\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.480\nI recently spent time with\none of my customers doing and\n\n232\n00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.890\nwalking through\nan architecture/deployment scenario for\n\n233\n00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.940\nthem with SCOM, helping them to\nunderstand how to use the tool.\n\n234\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.450\nTrained a series or\na group of their data center managers and\n\n235\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.920\narchitects from around the world.\n\n236\n00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.820\nAnd one of the most important things right\nout of the gate when we sat down and\n\n237\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.020\nthey said, okay, here's what we wanna do.\n\n238\n00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.741\nThis global monitoring concept,\n\n239\n00:11:56.741 --> 00:12:00.775\nsynthetic transaction monitoring was at\nthe top of their list, they said look,\n\n240\n00:12:00.775 --> 00:12:04.490\nwe're paying for an alternative\nvendor product that does this now.\n\n241\n00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:08.257\nWe already own system center up and\ndown the stack as a licensed product,\n\n242\n00:12:08.257 --> 00:12:11.429\nwe're not fully deploying it,\nwe need to start using SCOM.\n\n243\n00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:14.160\nWe are paying twice for\nthe same feature set.\n\n244\n00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.930\nWe understand from what we've\nbeen told that SCOM can do this.\n\n245\n00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.270\nNumber one, can you validate it does?\n\n246\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.590\nNumber two, you gotta show us how to do\nit, so that by the time we move away from\n\n247\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:26.880\nthis product, and we get this stood up, we\nwanna stop paying for this other product.\n\n248\n00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.840\nWe wanna to go full in on Microsoft.\n\n249\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.422\nThose are the kind of\nengagements I love to do,\n\n250\n00:12:30.422 --> 00:12:33.240\nkind of work I love to spend\ntime on customers with.\n\n251\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.110\nBecause getting the full value out\nof that investment in the technology\n\n252\n00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.300\nyour business has already made,\nI don't care how big or small you are.\n\n253\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.494\nYou could be a very small mom and\npop shop.\n\n254\n00:12:43.494 --> 00:12:46.480\nYou could be a large Fortune 100 customer.\n\n255\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.120\nMoney is money,\nit's important to your business,\n\n256\n00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.130\nregardless of where it comes from.\n\n257\n00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.040\nIf you're spending $1, you wanna get\nback $3 or $4 in perceived value.\n\n258\n00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.950\nThat's a good deal,\n\n259\n00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.900\nright, and so the idea would be that\nI love spending time with customers.\n\n260\n00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.680\nHelping them to understand the true\nvalue that they can extract from their\n\n261\n00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.200\ntechnology investments to better make\ntheir business investments work for\n\n262\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.260\nthem, right?\n\n263\n00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.690\nIf you go out and buy two products and do\nthe same thing, you don't deploy one and\n\n264\n00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.130\nyou kind of halfway deploy the other.\n\n265\n00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.665\nYou've spent twice the amount\nof money to get half the value.\n\n266\n00:13:16.665 --> 00:13:19.905\nAnd you're really not utilizing either\nstack fully, it's just not good,\n\n267\n00:13:19.905 --> 00:13:20.977\nno matter how you cut it.\n\n268\n00:13:20.977 --> 00:13:23.730\nI mean, it's just, no good comes\nto that no matter what you do.\n\n269\n00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.502\nIf you deploy fully on one and\nreally drill down and\n\n270\n00:13:26.502 --> 00:13:30.858\nextract all the possible value and\nyou are fully maximizing that investment,\n\n271\n00:13:30.858 --> 00:13:34.767\nthen we're talking about something\nthat really makes a lot of sense.\n\n272\n00:13:34.767 --> 00:13:37.550\nSo this is the kind of\nconversation I love to have.\n\n273\n00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.695\nThis is the kind of work I love to do.\n\n274\n00:13:38.695 --> 00:13:41.576\nThis is the kind of work that you're\ngonna be able to do after you get done\n\n275\n00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:43.480\ngoing through all these episodes with us.\n\n276\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.930\nCuz you're gonna be able to fully deploy\nand utilize this product to the maximum\n\n277\n00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.220\nadvantage, maximum benefit\nof your organization.\n\n278\n00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.885\nOr Daniel will give you your money back.\n\n279\n00:13:51.885 --> 00:13:54.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's vowed to do that.\n\n280\n00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.939\nIf we could go back here for\njust a second, what I wanna do,\n\n281\n00:13:57.939 --> 00:13:59.968\nI love how that just goes away.\n\n282\n00:13:59.968 --> 00:14:00.866\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n283\n00:14:00.866 --> 00:14:01.665\n&gt;&gt; Woo woo, all right,\n\n284\n00:14:01.665 --> 00:14:04.900\nso just rounding out our conversations\nhere as we get started with our overview.\n\n285\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.200\nGiving you some idea of where we're gonna\ngo, what that road map looks like, and\n\n286\n00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.920\nthings you need to do in order to get\nSCOM stood up and deployed fully.\n\n287\n00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.530\nThe last of the Microsoft sites,\nat least for this series,\n\n288\n00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.490\nthat we're going through in the beginning\nin the overview and architecture episodes\n\n289\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.200\nis the preparing your environment for\nSystem Center 2012 R2 Ops Manager.\n\n290\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.460\nSay that three times fast, right?\n\n291\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.940\nThis website in particular, and you can\nsee this has got a lot of resources here,\n\n292\n00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.310\nlet's just scroll down.\n\n293\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.220\nFirst things first,\n\n294\n00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.760\nwhat are the environmental\npre-reqs we need to understand?\n\n295\n00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:39.200\nSo what systems have to be set up, what\namount of memory, what kind of CPU usage,\n\n296\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.670\nwhat kind of storage, what kind of network\nbandwidth, what kind of pre-req software.\n\n297\n00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.980\nDo we need the .NET framework?\n\n298\n00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.230\nDo we need SQL?\n\n299\n00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.440\nDo we need SharePoint?\n\n300\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.920\nDo we need this, do we need that?\n\n301\n00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.710\nRight, all that stuff's gonna be listed.\n\n302\n00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:54.060\nWhat are our options to\ndeploy System Center 2012, or\n\n303\n00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.090\nspecifically, the Ops Manager?\n\n304\n00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.000\nI mentioned the value of the release\nnotes and reading through those.\n\n305\n00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.910\nIf we wanna stand it up in a test\nenvironment, setting up what's called\n\n306\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.555\na single server deployment, so\nthis is not recommended for production.\n\n307\n00:15:06.555 --> 00:15:10.045\nBut doing a stand alone single\nserver all in one install is good.\n\n308\n00:15:10.045 --> 00:15:12.574\nThis is, by the way,\nwhat you will get if you go and\n\n309\n00:15:12.574 --> 00:15:15.124\ntry to download some of\nthe VHDs that I mentioned.\n\n310\n00:15:15.124 --> 00:15:18.092\nWe're gonna show you where that\nsite is to download some sample\n\n311\n00:15:18.092 --> 00:15:21.347\nproduct from Microsoft, so you can\nset up your own lab if you want to.\n\n312\n00:15:21.347 --> 00:15:23.166\nGot that teed up on the other tab there.\n\n313\n00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:24.907\nWe'll go to that in just a minute.\n\n314\n00:15:24.907 --> 00:15:27.867\nBut you can go in there, and\nif you're new to Ops Manager, and\n\n315\n00:15:27.867 --> 00:15:31.240\nsome of you may not be using this product,\nbut wanna know more about it.\n\n316\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.950\nThere's a hey, I'm new, I need to\nknow some key concepts link here,\n\n317\n00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.130\nwhich will give you vocabulary, help you\nwalk through the diagram I created for\n\n318\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.090\nyou, show you all the moving parts there,\nexplain what's going on.\n\n319\n00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.180\nIt's a great way to get your\nfeet wet in the technology\n\n320\n00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.990\nwithout having to jump in and\njust make all the mistakes along the way.\n\n321\n00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.208\nIt's a great way to learn as well.\n\n322\n00:15:49.208 --> 00:15:50.498\nThere's nothing wrong with that, but\n\n323\n00:15:50.498 --> 00:15:52.109\nyou'll save yourself a lot of time and\ntrouble.\n\n324\n00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.040\nWe do support virtualization.\n\n325\n00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.162\nYou can run this in virtualized\nenvironments and, or\n\n326\n00:15:57.162 --> 00:15:59.996\nyou could do performance monitoring\nof virtualized infrastructure,\n\n327\n00:15:59.996 --> 00:16:02.849\ncloud based infrastructure today,\npretty much synonymous, right?\n\n328\n00:16:02.849 --> 00:16:07.227\nYou really can't say cloud and not mean\nvirtualization Because Cloud technology,\n\n329\n00:16:07.227 --> 00:16:11.048\nat least the way we think of Cloud\ntechnology today, is the key enabler for\n\n330\n00:16:11.048 --> 00:16:12.604\nwhat we do in the data center.\n\n331\n00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:16.590\nYou could virtualize without Cloud but\nyou can't do Cloud without virtualization.\n\n332\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.570\nAnd so the two really,\nat least not in a scalable enterprise way.\n\n333\n00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.579\nAnd if somebody out there is saying,\nof course,\n\n334\n00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:23.442\nyou could do cloud without virtualization,\n\n335\n00:16:23.442 --> 00:16:26.934\nyou're just doing it in a private cloud\non-prem with all your own infrastructure.\n\n336\n00:16:26.934 --> 00:16:29.827\nAbsolutely, we call that a private Cloud,\nthere's no doubt about it.\n\n337\n00:16:29.827 --> 00:16:33.700\nBut, Enterprise grade Cloud,\ntoday, scalable Cloud, today,\n\n338\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.410\nis gonna involve aspects\nof virtualization.\n\n339\n00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.743\nThat's just the way it works, and\nso, out beyond a small test bed,\n\n340\n00:16:39.743 --> 00:16:42.786\nyou really need virtualization\nto scale the technology, and\n\n341\n00:16:42.786 --> 00:16:45.888\nCloud allows us to do that in\na ubiquitous, highly redundant,\n\n342\n00:16:45.888 --> 00:16:50.218\nhighly resilient, on-demand, pay as you\ngo, always available yeah, yeah, yeah,\n\n343\n00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.540\nkinda went-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n344\n00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.950\n&gt;&gt; On and on and one, right.\n\n345\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.560\nSo this kinda stuff's gonna be helpful but\nspecifically what I wanna show you here,\n\n346\n00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.390\nlet me just scroll down, just so you know.\n\n347\n00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.690\nSo minimum hardware, right,\nthis is gonna be helpful.\n\n348\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:07.810\nNow the sizing helper concept here\ndetermine requirements for this.\n\n349\n00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.950\nIf you go and you follow this link\nI'm just gonna click here for\n\n350\n00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.910\njust a second bring up a separate page.\n\n351\n00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:16.340\nThis is gonna let you download and\ntake a look at a spreadsheet that's gonna\n\n352\n00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.020\nallow you to go in and\nactually this is our additional tools.\n\n353\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.099\nJust take a look here,\nyou see little details.\n\n354\n00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:28.940\nThis has the documents and the MSI for\nthe management pack for Java.\n\n355\n00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.890\nAnd all of the other information available\nto help you understand some of the aspects\n\n356\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:38.390\nassociated with how to manage third\nparty infrastructure and integrate that.\n\n357\n00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.840\nSo the management for\nWebLogic, WebSphere, Tomcat,\n\n358\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.040\nJBoss, Java EEE or\nJava EE all that's here.\n\n359\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.930\nThe spreadsheet I was referring\nto is actually not gonna be\n\n360\n00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.110\non this download link, I thought this was\ngonna take you right to the download link.\n\n361\n00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.225\nBut I'm gonna actually make sure we have\na copy of the spreadsheet available in\n\n362\n00:17:55.225 --> 00:17:56.745\nthe show notes for the sizing helper.\n\n363\n00:17:56.745 --> 00:17:58.601\nWe're gonna show you that\nin an upcoming episode and\n\n364\n00:17:58.601 --> 00:17:59.877\njust show you what that looks like.\n\n365\n00:17:59.877 --> 00:18:03.310\nBut you can go in, you can download\nthe information from here.\n\n366\n00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.910\nThat link doesn't go to the right link,\n\n367\n00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.183\nit should actually go to\nthe sizing helper spreadsheet.\n\n368\n00:18:07.183 --> 00:18:08.550\nNot what they were just showing you.\n\n369\n00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.826\nBut we'll fix that,\nwe'll make sure you have a copy of that.\n\n370\n00:18:10.826 --> 00:18:14.322\nThere's a nifty little spreadsheet\nthat actually allows you to put in\n\n371\n00:18:14.322 --> 00:18:18.529\nall of the specifics of how you're gonna\ndo the deployment, what the machines are,\n\n372\n00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:21.372\nhow they're set up,\nwhat they're provisioned at, and\n\n373\n00:18:21.372 --> 00:18:25.009\nthen spits out ultimately at the bottom\nthrough all the different tabs.\n\n374\n00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:27.022\nAll the different deployment scenarios for\nyou and\n\n375\n00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:29.770\ngives you the profile of how all\nthe machines have to be set up.\n\n376\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.270\nHow many do you have, how big they have to\nbe, what it's gonna ultimately take to do.\n\n377\n00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.296\nSo it's actually a really neat tool.\n\n378\n00:18:34.296 --> 00:18:36.405\nI use it with customers all the time.\n\n379\n00:18:36.405 --> 00:18:38.215\nIt's a free tool Microsoft\nmakes it available.\n\n380\n00:18:38.215 --> 00:18:40.155\nYou just have to know\nwhere to find it because,\n\n381\n00:18:40.155 --> 00:18:43.145\nobviously, the link on the page\nmay not be accurate all the time.\n\n382\n00:18:43.145 --> 00:18:43.885\nThey do that a lot, by the way.\n\n383\n00:18:43.885 --> 00:18:46.555\nSometimes those links\njust go off in places.\n\n384\n00:18:46.555 --> 00:18:48.428\nAnd so you always have to check\nto make sure they're legitimate.\n\n385\n00:18:48.428 --> 00:18:51.575\nBut I will make sure you have a copy that\nwe'll put in the ShareNotes for you.\n\n386\n00:18:51.575 --> 00:18:55.795\nBut you'll see the operating systems that\nare specified here, minimum hardware,\n\n387\n00:18:55.795 --> 00:18:58.375\nsupported processors,\nall that kinds of stuff.\n\n388\n00:18:58.375 --> 00:19:00.376\nWhat versions of SQL Server do we use?\n\n389\n00:19:00.376 --> 00:19:02.830\nAnd what are the hot fixes necessary,\nright?\n\n390\n00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.490\nWhat are the requirements for off\nsemaniter features, so you'll see here.\n\n391\n00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.090\nCan we go full screen on this one just\nbecause I want you to be able to see this\n\n392\n00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.090\na little bit better?\n\n393\n00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.190\nYou'll see here we have disk space, right.\n\n394\n00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.840\nSo at least a gigabyte of hard-drive\nspace for the management server.\n\n395\n00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.030\nWhat's the operating system supported?\n\n396\n00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.700\nIt tells you hey go to this link,\nyou'll be able to tell.\n\n397\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.190\nArchitecture everything\nhas to be 64 bit today.\n\n398\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.090\nNot this 32 bit garbage we\nused to do years ago, right?\n\n399\n00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.960\nWho needs 32 bit?\n\n400\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.850\nWe need 64 bit today.\n\n401\n00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.890\nSo you'll see here, PowerShell support.\n\n402\n00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.350\nWe do support PowerShell.\n\n403\n00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.660\nGotta make sure we have\nthe .NET framework.\n\n404\n00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.910\nRight, so that's gonna be required.\n\n405\n00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.000\nYou'll see at least 4.0 or 4.5 or better.\n\n406\n00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.943\nSo you're gonna wanna just make\nsure you have all those, right, for\n\n407\n00:19:42.943 --> 00:19:45.070\nthe ops console, tells you what you need.\n\n408\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.200\nGives the information.\n\n409\n00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.760\nIt's nice web consult it breaks it down,\ngoes through every aspect here for\n\n410\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.420\nyou you for the databases tells you\nwhat you need for the databases.\n\n411\n00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.534\nWe used SQL Server, so\nit tells you what we can use there.\n\n412\n00:19:56.534 --> 00:20:00.301\nSee installing SQL 2008r2 or\ninstalling SQL 12, so\n\n413\n00:20:00.301 --> 00:20:03.040\nwe use the more recent versions of SQL.\n\n414\n00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.880\nNone of this 2005 stuff right,\ngotta be on the more recent versions.\n\n415\n00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.120\nThe monitoring agent,\nwhat do we support there?\n\n416\n00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.580\nIf we're gonna be doing UNIX, Linux based,\nit gives you all the information for\n\n417\n00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.610\nreporting, talks to you about how\nto set up the reporting site.\n\n418\n00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:22.012\nSQL Server 2012 R2 and SSRS, so\nit helps us to understand all that for\n\n419\n00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:25.856\nthe data warehouse,\ntells us what the requirements are there.\n\n420\n00:20:25.856 --> 00:20:31.450\nStarting with 2008 or better, pretty\nmuch SQL 2008 up so we can use that.\n\n421\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.100\nSo got all that the Ops gateway server\ntells us what we need on the gateway if\n\n422\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.250\nwe're gonna deploy that.\n\n423\n00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.460\nWe could deploy that on core which is kind\nof nice cuz we're gonna deploy that in\n\n424\n00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.560\ncore infrastructure.\n\n425\n00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.450\nDoesn't necessarily need to be\non a full GUI based environment.\n\n426\n00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:46.860\nI mentioned the firewall and\n\n427\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.060\nthe chart with all the firewall\nports this is that long one.\n\n428\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.270\nI mentioned that prior, but I just wanted\nto show you this just to make sure\n\n429\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.830\nyou know where to look obviously we're\nnot gonna talk through every port here.\n\n430\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.170\nExpect you to read through this and\ntake a look at it but\n\n431\n00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.880\nyou could see by product Ops Manager,\nright for the management server.\n\n432\n00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.600\nPort number and\n\n433\n00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.730\ndirection connecting to the Ops Database\nas a configurable yap, right?\n\n434\n00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.891\nFor set up and\nthen what are the nodes here.\n\n435\n00:21:09.891 --> 00:21:14.184\nSo its nice because not only do we give\nyou the actual feature, the direction and\n\n436\n00:21:14.184 --> 00:21:18.609\nthe ports but we talk about the feature\nconnecting to other features specifically\n\n437\n00:21:18.609 --> 00:21:21.325\nand what that communication\npath looks like.\n\n438\n00:21:21.325 --> 00:21:24.260\nCuz this is what I get a lot\nfrom students in particular but\n\n439\n00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.606\nalso from customers hey, I just don't\nneed to know a list of firewall ports\n\n440\n00:21:27.606 --> 00:21:30.850\nI gotta know the firewall ports\nspecific to traffic flow.\n\n441\n00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:35.950\nCan you tell me what direction and\nwhat ports for this specific flow.\n\n442\n00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.410\nAnd we've broken that down and\ngiven it to you in this chart.\n\n443\n00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.730\nAnd as you scroll through,\n\n444\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.245\nyou'll see management server\nto the Ops database, right.\n\n445\n00:21:43.245 --> 00:21:45.029\nManagement server to management server,\n\n446\n00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:47.116\nmanagement server to\nreporting data warehouse.\n\n447\n00:21:47.116 --> 00:21:49.882\nOn and on and on, and\nas you go through and it just never ends,\n\n448\n00:21:49.882 --> 00:21:52.133\nas you can see right we've\ngot everything here.\n\n449\n00:21:52.133 --> 00:21:55.656\nSo if you go through this table,\nyou're gonna have the traffic flows and\n\n450\n00:21:55.656 --> 00:21:59.296\nthe ports bidirectionally, between\nall aspects of the architecture, so\n\n451\n00:21:59.296 --> 00:22:03.280\nthat as you're looking at this, trying to\nfigure it out, you're gonna be able to\n\n452\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.664\nattach those flows, and you're gonna\nbe able to build out that map.\n\n453\n00:22:06.664 --> 00:22:09.599\nAnd have everything documented, and\nwhen you bring these two together,\n\n454\n00:22:09.599 --> 00:22:12.154\nthis is how you do all your\ndocumentation for your planning, and\n\n455\n00:22:12.154 --> 00:22:14.070\nthis is ultimately what\nyou wanna be able to do.\n\n456\n00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.423\nSo that website's gonna\nbe really helpful for\n\n457\n00:22:16.423 --> 00:22:20.525\nyou to ensure that you understand how to\ncreate the proper pathways that allow for\n\n458\n00:22:20.525 --> 00:22:24.147\ncommunication backwards and\nforward between all these moving parts in\n\n459\n00:22:24.147 --> 00:22:26.762\nthe management group as we\ndo the full deployment.\n\n460\n00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:30.577\n&gt;&gt; Well at least Microsoft didn't leave us\nwithout support that's at least something\n\n461\n00:22:30.577 --> 00:22:31.824\ngood they've done for us.\n\n462\n00:22:31.824 --> 00:22:35.514\nCuz as we've seen it definitely is\ngonna get a little bit complex, so\n\n463\n00:22:35.514 --> 00:22:38.610\nwe're gonna need those\nreferences in the future.\n\n464\n00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.181\nAdam, thanks so much for\ngetting us this far.\n\n465\n00:22:40.181 --> 00:22:43.067\nWe're looking forward to see\nwhere else we get to go.\n\n466\n00:22:43.067 --> 00:22:46.150\nLooking at data center\nmonitoring using SCOM.\n\n467\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.170\nBut as for this episode, it looks like\nwe've come to yet another ending.\n\n468\n00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.089\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n469\n00:22:50.089 --> 00:22:52.376\nAnd Adam, thanks as always for joining us.\n\n470\n00:22:52.376 --> 00:22:54.760\nWe thank you as always for\njoining us as well.\n\n471\n00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.430\nBut signing off, we're IT ProTV.\n\n472\n00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.980\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n473\n00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.160\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n474\n00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.386\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n475\n00:23:02.386 --> 00:23:08.298\n[MUSIC]\n\n476\n00:23:08.298 --> 00:23:11.241\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:12.413\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:16.498\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\nwelcome to another great episode of\n\n5\n00:00:16.498 --> 00:00:21.396\nITPRO.TV, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin todays episode we are back with more on\n\n6\n00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.960\nour datacenter monitoring\nwith Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n7\n00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.020\nAnd joining me back in the studio yet\n\n8\n00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.340\nagain is the master that is all music,\nmovies, and Microsoft.\n\n9\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.640\nOur good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.188\nAdam, welcome back, sir,\nglad to have you again.\n\n11\n00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:38.068\n&gt;&gt; Hey ho howdy hi, so\nwe are gonna continue.\n\n12\n00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:41.221\nI'm wondering what would happen if one day\nI should I'm like lurking in the corner?\n\n13\n00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:42.626\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'm wearing the dark black shirt.\n\n14\n00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:43.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, you can't see you.\n\n15\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.527\n&gt;&gt; It would be like I'm not here, right?\n\n16\n00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:46.848\nAnd then you would go and\nthere would be nothing there.\n\n17\n00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:47.869\n&gt;&gt; I hear your voice.\n\n18\n00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:50.330\n&gt;&gt; I'm here somewhere,\nI'm talking, but you can't see me.\n\n19\n00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.130\nSo, we're going to continue talking in\nthis episode and several episodes to\n\n20\n00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.237\nfollow this one, because this is a,\nas we say here, long one.\n\n21\n00:00:57.237 --> 00:00:58.398\nIt's going to be a multi-parter.\n\n22\n00:00:58.398 --> 00:00:59.900\nWe're going to be doing some\nreally cool stuff for you.\n\n23\n00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.710\nWe're actually going to walk you through,\nafter a brief intro, just kind of\n\n24\n00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.130\nan overview of what we're going to do,\nsome of the mechanics about how we do it.\n\n25\n00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.023\nWhat are the access accounts we need?\n\n26\n00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:10.608\nWhat are the System Center Config\nservice accounts, things like that?\n\n27\n00:01:10.608 --> 00:01:14.356\nOnce we get through all the basics,\nwe're actually gonna go through a series\n\n28\n00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:17.180\nof demos about how we stand up and\nconfigure not just SCOM,\n\n29\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.890\nbut the virtual machine manager, and\nall the supporting infrastructure.\n\n30\n00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.970\nThe orchestrator, the surface level\nmanager, DPM, data protection manager,\n\n31\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.550\nkind of the red headed step child\nof the System Center family.\n\n32\n00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.982\nMost people don't actually\nknow much about that product.\n\n33\n00:01:29.982 --> 00:01:33.256\nWe're going to back in to that and\ntalk about it by way of doing a demo for\n\n34\n00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:37.029\nyou and we'll talk a little bit about how\nwe get all these things talking together\n\n35\n00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:40.810\nthrough a series as I said of actual\nhands-on live demonstrations for you.\n\n36\n00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.420\nSo it's going to be exciting.\n\n37\n00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.500\nLooking forward to spending time doing\nthat with you, but to get started we gotta\n\n38\n00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.590\ntalk a bit about the broad thought process\nabout what it means to deploy SCOM.\n\n39\n00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.250\nHow do we do that?\n\n40\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.360\nWhat are the steps,\nthe mechanical nuts and bolts and\n\n41\n00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.290\npieces we need to go through\nin order to make this work?\n\n42\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.114\nProbably the most important thing we\nhave to do, and I stress this in some of\n\n43\n00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:04.183\nthe other episodes we were talking about\nin the first part of our conversation,\n\n44\n00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:07.304\nRon, overview and architecture,\nis really the planning.\n\n45\n00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:08.567\nWe often talk about the fact,\n\n46\n00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:10.951\nI've talked about a lot in\nmany of the shows I've done.\n\n47\n00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:14.550\nDaniel, you've been a part of many of\nthe security ones with me, so we've both\n\n48\n00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.740\ntalked about the importance of planning\nto be successful versus planning to fail.\n\n49\n00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.550\nAnd planning to be successful implies\nyou're gonna spend the time to figure\n\n50\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.120\nout the answers to the questions up\nfront of who, what, when, where,\n\n51\n00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.325\nwhy, and how, right?\n\n52\n00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:31.130\nThe five w's and the h that we so\noften talk about.\n\n53\n00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.530\nMany times neglect to pay attention to and\npay the price for after the fact.\n\n54\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.140\nBut we really have to answer these\nquestions when it comes to SCOM deployment\n\n55\n00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.200\nin particular, who are going to be the\npeople that are gonna be administering.\n\n56\n00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.530\nWe need to know who they are, so\n\n57\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.810\nwe can delegate roles to them in\nthe console once we have SCOM set up.\n\n58\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.460\nWe'll talk about that, what those roles\nlook like, how we create additional\n\n59\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.400\nsecurity roles, and\nwhat we do with them in upcoming episodes.\n\n60\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.804\nWe gotta understand what\nit is we wanna accomplish,\n\n61\n00:02:57.804 --> 00:03:00.660\nwhat kind of consoles are we deploying,\nwhat are we gonna do?\n\n62\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.380\nIt's gonna be the ops console only.\n\n63\n00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.690\nOps consul and web consul,\nops consul, web consul, and\n\n64\n00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.100\napplication monitoring consuls.\n\n65\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.013\nWe got figure that out.\n\n66\n00:03:09.013 --> 00:03:10.820\nWhat does that architecture look like?\n\n67\n00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.140\nAre we going to use a resource pool for\nmanagement servers.\n\n68\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.890\nWe spoke about that on the diagram and\n\n69\n00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.490\nthe architecture discussion\nin our prior episodes.\n\n70\n00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.630\nI encourage you to go back.\n\n71\n00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.714\nTake a look at those by the way\nif you haven't seen them yet.\n\n72\n00:03:21.714 --> 00:03:24.409\nIt will give you the foundation and\nthe thought process for\n\n73\n00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.180\nall the things we're talking\nabout going forward.\n\n74\n00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.610\nAre we gonna use a gateway server and\nif so, where are those external\n\n75\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.340\nagent based systems gonna be\nthat are not domain joined.\n\n76\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.066\nThat are gonna then need to be managed.\n\n77\n00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:37.320\nHow are we gonna deal with that.\n\n78\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.350\nWe gotta think about who's\ngonna do all this work and\n\n79\n00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.570\nas a result of who linked\nthat back to the what.\n\n80\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.630\nSpecifically, who and\nwhat together, in this case,\n\n81\n00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.600\nare who's going to do the deployment, and\n\n82\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.080\nwhat service accounts are gonna be\ncreated to drive that deployment?\n\n83\n00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.780\nWe are gonna need four different\naccounts that have to be created,\n\n84\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.140\nto do a proper installation of SCOM.\n\n85\n00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.749\nYou could do the boneheaded kind of, I'm\njust gonna do it but not really plan to do\n\n86\n00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:05.432\nit way of doing things, which is, I'll use\nthe domain admin account for everything.\n\n87\n00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:07.577\nOr if you're an admin\nthat has that account and\n\n88\n00:04:07.577 --> 00:04:11.650\nthat's kind of what you log on as, you\ncould just go ahead and use your account.\n\n89\n00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.440\nBut the challenge, of course,\nbecomes not a best practice, by the way.\n\n90\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.160\nDon't wanna recommend you do that.\n\n91\n00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.710\nSome of the challenges associated\nwith that are, change your password.\n\n92\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.060\nAll the service accounts\nhave to be changed.\n\n93\n00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.260\nAnd if you don't update it then as\na result, that could be a problem.\n\n94\n00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.640\nIf you're using a different account for\neach one, we have to document and\n\n95\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.780\nkeep track of all that.\n\n96\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.086\nBut it is more secure, so\nI want to think about that.\n\n97\n00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:37.285\nIf you are no longer with the organization\nyou're account gets disabled or removed.\n\n98\n00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:41.075\nAll of a sudden they've blown up their\nsystems center ops manager install which\n\n99\n00:04:41.075 --> 00:04:42.585\nwouldn't be a good thing, right?\n\n100\n00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:46.095\nRegardless of what kind of terms\nyou leave the organization on.\n\n101\n00:04:46.095 --> 00:04:48.295\nYou don't want to wish that on\nanybody that's not a good thing,\n\n102\n00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:51.980\nso want to make sure that as we're\nstarting to I think through this.\n\n103\n00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.410\nWe wanna really have\nanswers to those questions.\n\n104\n00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.240\nTalk about these requirements,\nfigure out on paper.\n\n105\n00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.655\nAnd with the input of\nothers in the organization,\n\n106\n00:05:00.655 --> 00:05:02.506\nwhat the best path forwards gonna be.\n\n107\n00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:04.595\nYou never wanna make these\ndecisions in a vacuum,\n\n108\n00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:07.690\nthat is when you tend to start having\nissues, and you make bad decisions.\n\n109\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.300\nBecause you are not taking to account,\nall the different factors and variables.\n\n110\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.900\nThat have to be considered\nin the organization.\n\n111\n00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.500\nFor instance, there may be a naming\nconvention that you're going to be using\n\n112\n00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.870\nand that you have to be specifying\neach account based off of.\n\n113\n00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.945\nAnd or naming convention for\nmachines as well and having talk about\n\n114\n00:05:24.945 --> 00:05:28.565\nthat machine names yet but you got to\nhave a standardized approach for both.\n\n115\n00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:29.805\nWhen I do a lot of security work.\n\n116\n00:05:29.805 --> 00:05:33.925\nWe do auditing and things of that nature,\nwe're looking for that standardization.\n\n117\n00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:39.065\nLooking for that specific template based\nthought process so that everything\n\n118\n00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:44.185\nis gonna look a certain way and be based\non a standard, you don't have to do that.\n\n119\n00:05:44.185 --> 00:05:48.700\nBut if you are gonna do that, really\nimportant that you do it consistently.\n\n120\n00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.015\nIn other words what you don't want to do\nis have a naming convention you apply some\n\n121\n00:05:52.015 --> 00:05:53.446\nof the time and not all of the time.\n\n122\n00:05:53.446 --> 00:05:56.407\nBecause that leads to even more confusion\nthan if you just didn't use one in\n\n123\n00:05:56.407 --> 00:05:57.590\nthe first place right.\n\n124\n00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.810\nSo these kind of things are considerations\nbecause once you get into\n\n125\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.032\nthe actual deployment.\n\n126\n00:06:03.032 --> 00:06:05.110\nOnce you kick it off and\nstart working with it.\n\n127\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.806\nThat's not the time when the consoles\nare up that you want to be sitting there\n\n128\n00:06:08.806 --> 00:06:11.257\nwaiting and\ntrying to figure out what the goal is.\n\n129\n00:06:11.257 --> 00:06:15.243\nOr make the decision to install and then\nfind out after the fact you used the wrong\n\n130\n00:06:15.243 --> 00:06:19.140\nnaming convention, used the wrong\naccounts, made the wrong choices.\n\n131\n00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.360\nWe're implementing solutions that\nare gonna tie back into, in some respects,\n\n132\n00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.630\nthe Active Directory.\n\n133\n00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.320\nAnd as a result,\nif we start to make changes there,\n\n134\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.070\nwe may run into issues where it's not\neasy to go and back out those accounts.\n\n135\n00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.300\nNot easy to go and change the naming\npreferences that we've specified, and\n\n136\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.570\nthat can prove to be an issue.\n\n137\n00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.010\nWe don't have a direct tie in per\nse with some of these products, but\n\n138\n00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.660\nsome of them do tie in to AD and\nare going to\n\n139\n00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.430\nadd in information that would be hard to\nremove, let's put it that way, right?\n\n140\n00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.425\nWe're not talking about Exchange, not\ntalking about some of the products that\n\n141\n00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:54.820\nextend the Active Directory\nschema directly.\n\n142\n00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.768\nAlthough System Center Config Manager,\nnot a product we're here talking about\n\n143\n00:06:58.768 --> 00:07:02.251\ndirectly, but is part of the overall\nsuite of System Center products,\n\n144\n00:07:02.251 --> 00:07:06.775\nare configuration management database and\ninfrastructure management platform.\n\n145\n00:07:06.775 --> 00:07:11.695\nThat product extends the AD, although you\ndo it manually by creating a container\n\n146\n00:07:11.695 --> 00:07:15.617\nin the advanced features to put in\nthe information for the management point.\n\n147\n00:07:15.617 --> 00:07:19.057\nSo that clients or\nagents that are managed can actually find\n\n148\n00:07:19.057 --> 00:07:21.367\ntheir management servers,\nand download policies.\n\n149\n00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:22.487\nAnd then do deployments.\n\n150\n00:07:22.487 --> 00:07:25.887\nSo we do need to work with the active\ndirectory for some of these products.\n\n151\n00:07:25.887 --> 00:07:27.727\nWe've got to keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n152\n00:07:27.727 --> 00:07:30.465\nOtherwise, we're, as I said,\nprobably going to make bad choices.\n\n153\n00:07:30.465 --> 00:07:31.707\nAnd we don't want to do that.\n\n154\n00:07:31.707 --> 00:07:36.825\nSo let's think about what the actual\nmanager security accounts types are.\n\n155\n00:07:36.825 --> 00:07:40.451\nThere are four specific operations\nmanager account types we have to be\n\n156\n00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:41.760\nresponsible for.\n\n157\n00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.457\nFirst one are what we call action\naccounts, these are going to perform\n\n158\n00:07:45.457 --> 00:07:49.732\nthe actual monitoring tasks on the various\nend points that are being monitored.\n\n159\n00:07:49.732 --> 00:07:54.187\nThe agent in other words is going\nto be using these action accounts,\n\n160\n00:07:54.187 --> 00:07:57.559\nthey run under the monitoring\nhost .exe process.\n\n161\n00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:00.900\nSo when you go to look for\nevidence of this account being used or\n\n162\n00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.023\nevidence of monitoring taking place,\n\n163\n00:08:03.023 --> 00:08:06.090\nmonitoringhost.exe is\nthe process we look for.\n\n164\n00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.070\nThey could be a local system or\ndomain account.\n\n165\n00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.750\nSo we could do a local system\non a standalone machine.\n\n166\n00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.830\nRemember the gateway servers are used\nto deal with those non-domain\n\n167\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.830\njoined machines.\n\n168\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.480\nSo agents on those systems will run\nunder the local system account.\n\n169\n00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.060\nVersus domain accounts that\nare domain joint, either way.\n\n170\n00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.290\nWhat are the minimum permissions required?\n\n171\n00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.410\nIf you had to guess, right?\n\n172\n00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.340\nIf you didn't know.\n\n173\n00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:25.890\nYou may not know.\n\n174\n00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.610\nSo we're gonna play if you didn't\nknow what would the answer be.\n\n175\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if you had to guess,\n\n176\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.230\nwhat do you think the minimum permissions\nwould be for this kind of an account?\n\n177\n00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.790\nIf we need to be able\nto kick off monitoring,\n\n178\n00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:38.780\nbe able to interact with the system,\neither local or domain joint.\n\n179\n00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.140\nWhat kind of permissions\nare we looking for?\n\n180\n00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.130\n&gt;&gt; I would think that the minimum\nwould probably be domain admin level.\n\n181\n00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.682\n&gt;&gt; Well, if we're in the domain,\nif we're domain joined.\n\n182\n00:08:45.682 --> 00:08:48.599\n[CROSSTALK] Remember for local,\n&gt;&gt; Then it would be local administration.\n\n183\n00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:49.650\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nit would be the equivalent, right?\n\n184\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.150\nSo, it may not be and\nit will not actually be domain joined or\n\n185\n00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.320\nexcuse me, not domain joined,\ndomain admin.\n\n186\n00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.870\nBut Daniel's on the right track.\n\n187\n00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.297\nWe need to be a member of local users,\nso on the standalone machine or\n\n188\n00:09:00.297 --> 00:09:01.700\nnon-domain joined.\n\n189\n00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.370\nLocal users,\nlocal performance monitor users, so again.\n\n190\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.180\nRights on the box if you're monitoring.\n\n191\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.860\nNot full blown domain admin or\nadmin rights.\n\n192\n00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.900\nBecause we don't need full\ncontrol of the box but\n\n193\n00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.088\nwe need enough capabilities,\nlimited scope.\n\n194\n00:09:15.088 --> 00:09:18.170\nWe really wanna narrowly define\nthe permissions here so that we can do\n\n195\n00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.590\nthe monitoring but not have enough that\nif the account were to be compromised,\n\n196\n00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.480\nsomebody could take over the box,\nwhich would be an important distinction.\n\n197\n00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.330\nAnd then allow log on locally.\n\n198\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.540\nSo allowing log on locally, what we\ncall set interactive log on, right.\n\n199\n00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.150\nWhich is the right that's\ngiven when you log on locally.\n\n200\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.040\nBetween those three rights,\nwe're gonna have enough permissions or\n\n201\n00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.580\nthose three grants,\nwe're gonna have enough permission\n\n202\n00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.810\nto be able to execute what we need for\nthe monitoring host.exe process.\n\n203\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.926\nSo we need to have local\nrights essentially, right, or\n\n204\n00:09:44.926 --> 00:09:46.870\nthe equivalent in\na domain-joined environment.\n\n205\n00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.050\nSo, just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n206\n00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.150\nSecond type of account we have,\nthis is a long one.\n\n207\n00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.700\nAnd people often confuse this and\nsay, this is two separate ones.\n\n208\n00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.810\nIt's actually one specific group.\n\n209\n00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.250\nThere's two service accounts, but\nthey fall under this category.\n\n210\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:05.410\nSystems center configuration service,\nand system center data access service.\n\n211\n00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.700\nBoth of these together are service\naccounts specific to this environment.\n\n212\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.000\nThat used to interact with data in\nthe Ops Manager, operational database.\n\n213\n00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.590\nIf you remember our architectural diagram,\nwe had two databases.\n\n214\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.300\nWe had the operations manager database and\nthe data warehouse database.\n\n215\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.370\nThese accounts are focused on\nthe operational manager database.\n\n216\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.530\nSo the database that's the non-warehouse\ndata database, in other words.\n\n217\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.360\nMinimum permissions associated with this.\n\n218\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.010\nThis one does need admin rights,\nas Daniel was suggesting.\n\n219\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.200\nLocal admin rights on\nthe Management Server.\n\n220\n00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.420\nSome member of the local admins\ngroup on the Management Server\n\n221\n00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.590\nis where we want these\naccounts to be set up.\n\n222\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.780\nSo these are gonna interact\nwith the database and\n\n223\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.050\nbe able to move information back and\nforth.\n\n224\n00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:49.865\nThis can use a domain or local account,\nso we could do a domain joined as well.\n\n225\n00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:55.225\nBut remember, that if we are doing\nlocal accounts, this is typically\n\n226\n00:10:55.225 --> 00:10:58.975\ngonna be if the management server and\ndatabase are on the same machine.\n\n227\n00:10:58.975 --> 00:11:02.485\nAnd we don't recommend that topology or\nthat thought process\n\n228\n00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:07.215\nunless you're doing a standalone all\nin one deployment for testing purposes.\n\n229\n00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:08.930\nIf, give me just one second.\n\n230\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.520\nBefore we switch back, if we could switch\nback to my machine for just a second.\n\n231\n00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.290\nJust bringing up the picture so we can see\nthe architectural diagram from before.\n\n232\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.680\nIf we think about the logic of what\nwe had going on here, this database,\n\n233\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.740\nthe Ops Manager database right here,\n\n234\n00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.250\nis the data base these service\naccounts have to interact with.\n\n235\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.770\nWhat we're suggesting is that\nin enterprise level deployments,\n\n236\n00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.192\nwhere this is built out for\nan organization.\n\n237\n00:11:31.192 --> 00:11:33.570\nThat's gonna be a database running on SQL,\n\n238\n00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.280\nsomewhere separately from the management\nservers that are down here in the pool.\n\n239\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.830\nIn other words, that database is not gonna\nbe on one of the management servers.\n\n240\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.850\nBut rather,\nrunning as a distinct entity on its own.\n\n241\n00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:48.552\nSo, when we do it that way, then we're\nnot gonna use local accounts on that.\n\n242\n00:11:48.552 --> 00:11:51.780\nWe're gonna use a domain joined account\nthat has rights both to SQL Server and\n\n243\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.120\nthe management server.\n\n244\n00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.080\nBut when we do a local account,\n\n245\n00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.260\nwe could do that if it is sitting\nall together in one machine.\n\n246\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.950\nBut this database would have to\nbe on this management server and\n\n247\n00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.470\nwould have to be local to it.\n\n248\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:08.226\nWe don't recommend that as I was saying\nunless that is full testing only non\n\n249\n00:12:08.226 --> 00:12:09.971\nproduction environment.\n\n250\n00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:13.510\nTypically when you download for\ninstance the demonstration VHDs or\n\n251\n00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.937\ndo an install to mark it up,\n\n252\n00:12:14.937 --> 00:12:19.475\nyou are gonna do all in one just because\nit's more speedy and it's easier to do.\n\n253\n00:12:19.475 --> 00:12:20.925\nAnd then you can play with it that way.\n\n254\n00:12:20.925 --> 00:12:23.325\nBut in production this\nwill be separated out.\n\n255\n00:12:23.325 --> 00:12:26.485\nYou'd have to use a domain account for\nthat, keep that in mind.\n\n256\n00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:29.849\nAnd, specifically in production,\nif we have a pool where we've got all\n\n257\n00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:33.212\nthese servers set up, you have to\nhave the the account standardized, so\n\n258\n00:12:33.212 --> 00:12:35.384\nit's same across all\nthe servers in the pool.\n\n259\n00:12:35.384 --> 00:12:39.179\nOtherwise, one server goes to access,\ngets in cuz it has the credentials,\n\n260\n00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:42.819\nthe others don't and then all of\na sudden all sorts of bad stuff happens.\n\n261\n00:12:42.819 --> 00:12:46.784\nYour databases are not updating with all\nthe information from all the agents,\n\n262\n00:12:46.784 --> 00:12:49.358\nyou got all sorts of\njust craziness going on.\n\n263\n00:12:49.358 --> 00:12:52.588\nSo remember, plan to be successful,\ndon't plan to fail.\n\n264\n00:12:52.588 --> 00:12:54.538\nPay attention to the details.\n\n265\n00:12:54.538 --> 00:12:56.918\nThese details are the difference\nbetween success or\n\n266\n00:12:56.918 --> 00:12:58.730\nfailure the first time out of the gate.\n\n267\n00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.310\nWhen we're doing these\nkind of deployments,\n\n268\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.930\nvery important to think about that.\n\n269\n00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.010\nThere's gonna be a quiz at\nthe end of this by the way, and\n\n270\n00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.640\nif you don't pass we actually\ndon't let you turn us off.\n\n271\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.711\nWe're gonna keep simulcasting\nuntil you either give in or\n\n272\n00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:13.959\nyou take the quiz again and\nyou actually pass.\n\n273\n00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:17.380\nDaniel's gonna come visit you as a matter\nof fact and make sure that you keep watch.\n\n274\n00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.910\nHe's gonna hold your head up against\nthe screen while that's happening.\n\n275\n00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.409\nRemember this I think we talked about\nthis in one of our other episodes.\n\n276\n00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.810\nRandom aside, by the way.\n\n277\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.222\nWe gotta get that sign for that.\n\n278\n00:13:27.222 --> 00:13:28.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; We gotta have something.\n\n279\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.060\nSo you remember the Halloween movie?\n\n280\n00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.170\nI know you watch movies.\n\n281\n00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You're a student of the genre.\n\n282\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.300\nAnd I think I asked you about this in one\nof our other shows but you weren't clear,\n\n283\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.510\nor it may have been Cherokee and\n\n284\n00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.050\nshe wasn't sure cuz she's\nreally not into movies.\n\n285\n00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.620\nBut remember the,\nI think it was the original Halloween or\n\n286\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:48.710\none of the original ones where the kids\nare watching the TV during Halloween,\n\n287\n00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.490\nand then the signal goes out and\nthe masks, the pumpkin masks or\n\n288\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.330\nwhatever that he had on,\nturns them into like the raving lunatics?\n\n289\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That was in Halloween, right?\n\n290\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.840\nYeah, the signal goes out through the TV.\n\n291\n00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.060\nThey put on the-\n&gt;&gt; We did talk about this.\n\n292\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:02.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we did, right?\n\n293\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.650\n&gt;&gt; And I couldn't remember.\n\n294\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.170\n&gt;&gt; It was, yeah.\n\n295\n00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.080\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking about X-Files.\n\n296\n00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.369\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but no I think it was Halloween.\n\n297\n00:14:07.369 --> 00:14:08.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n298\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.341\n&gt;&gt; So anyway,\nit's gonna be like that, only worse.\n\n299\n00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:11.892\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay so just make sure you pay\n\n300\n00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:13.620\nattention to the details.\n\n301\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.960\nAll right.\nSo, data writer accounts, and\n\n302\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.920\ndata reader accounts.\n\n303\n00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.390\nThe other two types we have.\n\n304\n00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.198\nThese are distinctive.\n\n305\n00:14:19.198 --> 00:14:21.510\nEven though we just mentioned them more or\nless together.\n\n306\n00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.190\nThe data writer account,\nas the name implies,\n\n307\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.530\nif you had to think about it,\nallows us to collect data.\n\n308\n00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.060\nFrom the operational database, write\ndata to the reporting data warehouse.\n\n309\n00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.920\nIn other words, moves data between\nthe two databases back and forth.\n\n310\n00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.850\nRemember, the actual data that's coming\nin, that's live that's being aggregated,\n\n311\n00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.700\ngoes into the operational database and\n\n312\n00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.860\nthen is moved over to the data warehouse\nfor reporting purposes over time.\n\n313\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.720\nThe data writer account is assigned the\nappropriate permissions during install.\n\n314\n00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.170\nSo when you do this, you have to have\na stand up to database server or\n\n315\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.980\nhave access to it already available.\n\n316\n00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.360\nYou may have an instance already named,\n\n317\n00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.350\nif not you'll be able to\ncreate one as you go.\n\n318\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.860\nBut we assigned that permission\nset to the data warehouse and\n\n319\n00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.090\nthe operational manager database\non the fly during install.\n\n320\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.440\nYou have to have SQL\nserver log on rights and\n\n321\n00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.236\nlog on rights to the computer hosting\nthe operational manager database for\n\n322\n00:15:09.236 --> 00:15:11.550\nthe data writer account to\nbe available and to be used.\n\n323\n00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.300\nYou just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n324\n00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.110\nThe data reader account is used by\nthe SSRS, SQL server reporting services,\n\n325\n00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:22.970\nto be able to run queries against the ops\nmanager reporting data warehouse database.\n\n326\n00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.580\nSo if we can go back again real quick\njust over here for a moment, right?\n\n327\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.691\nWe're talking about accounts\nthat are gonna leverage one or\n\n328\n00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:33.297\nboth of these databases to be able\nto move information back and forth.\n\n329\n00:15:33.297 --> 00:15:36.479\nYou can kind of see, we have\nan implied connection here where we\n\n330\n00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:38.591\ncan move data back and forth across here.\n\n331\n00:15:38.591 --> 00:15:42.826\nThe reporting server is gonna be able to\ninteract with this to be able to get data\n\n332\n00:15:42.826 --> 00:15:47.254\nin and out as well, and to query data from\nthe Operations Manager data warehouse,\n\n333\n00:15:47.254 --> 00:15:49.692\nthe data reader account\nis used by this box and\n\n334\n00:15:49.692 --> 00:15:53.478\nthe SSRS service To be able to pull\nthat data out of here, run queries,\n\n335\n00:15:53.478 --> 00:15:56.500\ngenerate reports that\nare shown in the console.\n\n336\n00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.500\nSo we're gonna need those\naccounts running and available.\n\n337\n00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.200\nThat has to be a domain account.\n\n338\n00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.860\nAnd it has to have a SQL Server logon\nrights on the management server as well.\n\n339\n00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.050\nYour bare baseline minimum,\ntypically, domain labeled accounts.\n\n340\n00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.420\nDomain joined, in other words.\n\n341\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.380\nTypically at a minimum,\n\n342\n00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:15.820\nthey have to have logon rights into the\nmanagement service to be able to be used.\n\n343\n00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.760\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n344\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.220\nWe don't really specify\nthe use of local accounts.\n\n345\n00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.785\nAgain, unless there's\na testing environment or\n\n346\n00:16:21.785 --> 00:16:23.439\nsome sort of special scenario.\n\n347\n00:16:23.439 --> 00:16:25.399\nSo we just want to make sure\nwe're aware of that and\n\n348\n00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.980\nwe're thinking about that here.\n\n349\n00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.983\nWe actually can also lock\ndown some of these accounts.\n\n350\n00:16:29.983 --> 00:16:33.575\nThere's the ability to control\naccess by using something known as\n\n351\n00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:35.520\nthe Health Service lockdown tool.\n\n352\n00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.050\nThis is the HSLockdown.exe tool,\n\n353\n00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.570\nthat's how it's commonly\nreferred to in our documentation.\n\n354\n00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.940\nHealth Service lockdown tool,\nwe could control and\n\n355\n00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.070\nlimit the identities that are used to run.\n\n356\n00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.780\nThings like rules, tasks,\nor due monitoring.\n\n357\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.810\nIt's a tool you run after\nthe fact that can lock down and\n\n358\n00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.170\nclamp down on those permissions.\n\n359\n00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.120\nAnd allow you to specify\nwho gets rights to do this.\n\n360\n00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.730\nRuns under the local system.\n\n361\n00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.120\nBut the work flows that are kicked off\nthrough it run under the action account.\n\n362\n00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.720\nSo you gotta be careful here.\n\n363\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.933\nThis is a place where a lot of\nmy customers have had problems.\n\n364\n00:17:04.933 --> 00:17:08.390\nA lot of people wind up in\nthe support queue over this issue.\n\n365\n00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.910\nThey hear about this tool, they run it,\nlooks like it's doing great.\n\n366\n00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.300\nDoes what they want,\nthey go to start executing stuff, and\n\n367\n00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.720\nthe work flows start to fail.\n\n368\n00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.020\nAnd their scratching their\nheads going what's going on?\n\n369\n00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.940\nWe used the tool the way\nwe were supposed to.\n\n370\n00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.380\nYou gotta be careful.\n\n371\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:27.340\nIf you lock out the action account\nthat the work flows respond under\n\n372\n00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.620\nusing this tool.\n\n373\n00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.336\nThen the system management\nservice will not start.\n\n374\n00:17:31.336 --> 00:17:34.813\nAnd you have to unlock the action\naccount to get System Center Ops Manager\n\n375\n00:17:34.813 --> 00:17:36.680\nactually running the right way.\n\n376\n00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.240\nSo you gotta be careful with this tool.\n\n377\n00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.840\nWe do a good job of documenting into\nthe details of the tool when you\n\n378\n00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.680\nread up on it.\n\n379\n00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.430\nBut you gotta make sure you're\npaying attention to the details,\n\n380\n00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.150\nor bad things happen.\n\n381\n00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.308\nAs a matter of fact,\ngive me just one second.\n\n382\n00:17:48.308 --> 00:17:50.050\nYou're not supposed to see\nthe magic behind the scenes there.\n\n383\n00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:50.940\nJust give me one second.\n\n384\n00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.140\nThat's just our lab environment.\n\n385\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.200\nI'm getting ready to do a demo for you on.\n\n386\n00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.100\nBut I have the website up for this that\nwill help you to better understand\n\n387\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.820\nthe issues and concerns associated\nwith the lockdown tool.\n\n388\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.590\nSo, this is in the show notes,\nwanna make sure you check this out.\n\n389\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:04.400\nJust go take a look.\n\n390\n00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.020\nWe talk about it, tell you how to\nuse the tool, where to find it.\n\n391\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.260\nGives you the switches associated with it,\nas you can see there.\n\n392\n00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.580\nTells you how to use the tool and\nto avoid the concerns associated with it.\n\n393\n00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.150\nYou can use either a NETBIOS or\nUPN format.\n\n394\n00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:22.645\nSo essentially domain/, or\ndomain\\username@domain,\n\n395\n00:18:22.645 --> 00:18:24.677\nwhichever one you prefer.\n\n396\n00:18:24.677 --> 00:18:28.110\nWe talked about the use of it, and\nif you have to unlock the action account.\n\n397\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.660\nCuz we know that that can happen.\n\n398\n00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.550\nWe tell you exactly how\nto deal with that there.\n\n399\n00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:32.810\nSo if you do have a little oopsy,\n\n400\n00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.760\nas we say, then this is\nthe way you recover from that.\n\n401\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.530\nSo if you run into an issue\nwhere this tool get deployed,\n\n402\n00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.290\nall the sudden things stop working.\n\n403\n00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.910\nHopefully, that'll tickle\nthe back of your brain,\n\n404\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.440\nyou'll remember something about\nneeding to unlock an account.\n\n405\n00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.760\nQuickly go look it up.\n\n406\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.780\nYou'll find that by unlocking this,\nrunning the tool and\n\n407\n00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.150\nunlocking the action account.\n\n408\n00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.550\nYou're probably back in business again.\n\n409\n00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.780\nSo that's gonna help you,\nhopefully, help you to make sure\n\n410\n00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.420\nyou are aware of what needs to\nhappen there to be successful.\n\n411\n00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.323\nWhile we're on the subject\nof being successful.\n\n412\n00:18:59.323 --> 00:19:02.978\nI talked about in the last episode,\nthe ability for you to go out and\n\n413\n00:19:02.978 --> 00:19:05.800\nto download some eval software and\nplay with this.\n\n414\n00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.300\nSo we're gonna do live demos\nof installs for you here.\n\n415\n00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.140\nSo you're gonna get to\nsee us do this live.\n\n416\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.470\nBut you may not be equipped to\nset this all up on your own.\n\n417\n00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.190\nYou may wanna be able to practice it.\n\n418\n00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.783\nI showed you and talked about the fact,\nor at least talked about the fact that we\n\n419\n00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:21.737\ncould do this through some of\nthe hosted online labs at TechNet.\n\n420\n00:19:21.737 --> 00:19:24.210\nYou can also download eval software.\n\n421\n00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.170\nSo if you wanna go do the download here,\n\n422\n00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.180\nyou'll see them on the TechNet\nevaluation center.\n\n423\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.250\nJust while we're here talking really\nquickly, you'll see we have System Center.\n\n424\n00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.480\nThe latest builds for\n2016 are here, 180-day eval.\n\n425\n00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:40.082\nWe also have builds on\nSystem Center 2012 R2.\n\n426\n00:19:40.082 --> 00:19:43.740\nYou could see it right down here as\nyou drill in, 180 day eval again.\n\n427\n00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.004\nYou have to sign in.\n\n428\n00:19:45.004 --> 00:19:47.200\nYou just need a Windows Live ID.\n\n429\n00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.820\nI used to call them .NET\npasswords cuz that's how old I am.\n\n430\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.930\nAnd you just need to\nlog in with an account.\n\n431\n00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.100\nYou'll get this question a lot.\n\n432\n00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.950\nHey, does that account cost me anything?\n\n433\n00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.450\nDo I have to be a customer?\n\n434\n00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.050\nDo I have to be a partner?\n\n435\n00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.015\nAbsolutely not, you could just\nsimply be an average person.\n\n436\n00:20:00.015 --> 00:20:01.780\nThere's no connection to Microsoft at all.\n\n437\n00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.000\nCreate a free account if\nyou don't already have one.\n\n438\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.313\nSign in with that account.\n\n439\n00:20:05.313 --> 00:20:08.142\nAnd then we let you download the bits and\nyou set it up on your own.\n\n440\n00:20:08.142 --> 00:20:11.360\nAnd so you can run this and\ncreate your own environment, locally.\n\n441\n00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.700\nUsing either client-side Hyper-V, or\n\n442\n00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.790\na full rack server-based solution,\nHyper-V, VMware, whatever it is.\n\n443\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.050\nYou could use VirtualBox if you\nwant a client-side hypervisor\n\n444\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.440\nthat's not specific to an OS.\n\n445\n00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.238\nIt'll pretty much run anything,\n\n446\n00:20:24.238 --> 00:20:27.278\nit's the Swiss army knife\nof client-side hypervisors.\n\n447\n00:20:27.278 --> 00:20:28.547\nDid you ever use VirtualBox?\n\n448\n00:20:28.547 --> 00:20:29.388\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love VirtualBox.\n\n449\n00:20:29.388 --> 00:20:30.876\n&gt;&gt; It's really good.\n&gt;&gt; It's great software, yeah.\n\n450\n00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:31.890\n&gt;&gt; You can run anything you want.\n\n451\n00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.600\nYou don't have to license it, it's free.\n\n452\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.090\nOracle bought Sun a few years back,\nso they own the software now.\n\n453\n00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.720\nBut it's actually a really good product.\n\n454\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.830\nUse it all the time.\n\n455\n00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.000\nSo you have options here, right?\n\n456\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.940\nSo you could go and download that,\nuse it if you're interested.\n\n457\n00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.450\nSo just a thought process for\nyou if you're interested in going in and\n\n458\n00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.430\nbeing able to do that.\n\n459\n00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.420\nAll right, so\nmanagement group design factors.\n\n460\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.840\nLet's just talk a little bit more broadly.\n\n461\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.770\nSpoken about some of the accounts\nrequired to do the actual deployment.\n\n462\n00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.710\nWhat are some of the things\nwe have to consider?\n\n463\n00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.980\nI mentioned the who, what, when, where,\nwhy and how conversation earlier.\n\n464\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.620\nBut let's think about some specificity,\nsome specifics.\n\n465\n00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.830\nThings like the number of agents\nthat we're gonna actually be using.\n\n466\n00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.280\nCuz we have to think about being\nable to scale accordingly.\n\n467\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.020\nHow much bandwidth, how much capacity,\nthings of that nature.\n\n468\n00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.180\nNumber of network devices.\n\n469\n00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.810\nHow many things are we\ngonna be monitoring?\n\n470\n00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.000\nTrust boundaries.\n\n471\n00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.788\nHow are we gonna be monitoring trusted\ninfrastructure behind the firewall in\n\n472\n00:21:21.788 --> 00:21:23.857\nthe land inside the LDAP domain.\n\n473\n00:21:23.857 --> 00:21:25.836\nAnd how are we gonna monitor outside?\n\n474\n00:21:25.836 --> 00:21:28.020\nAnd if we have enough of that\nwe gotta use gateway service.\n\n475\n00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.190\nWe've talked about this.\n\n476\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.760\nNetwork latency,\ntalked about the importance of and\n\n477\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.430\nthe need to be sensitive\nto network latency.\n\n478\n00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.550\nGotta make sure we're not falling\nbelow certain minimal thresholds.\n\n479\n00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.850\nOtherwise we have to think long and\nhard about where things,\n\n480\n00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.270\nare versus where we want to be.\n\n481\n00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.590\nSo you gotta think about that.\n\n482\n00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.910\nWhat about high availability?\n\n483\n00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:49.050\nSQL fail over clustering in multiple\nmanagement servers in our resource pool\n\n484\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.400\nwill be helpful here.\n\n485\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.980\nSo you just want to be\nthinking about that,\n\n486\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.790\nand making sure you're aware of that.\n\n487\n00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.230\nNow, we talked about minimum\nnetwork speeds before.\n\n488\n00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:01.740\nWe showed you, I should say, this exact\nwebsite in some of the early episodes.\n\n489\n00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:06.080\nIn the first chapter, first set of\nshows around overview and architecture.\n\n490\n00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.130\nWent through they showed you\nthe firewall diagram, for\n\n491\n00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.980\ninstance, talked about all that.\n\n492\n00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.830\nThere is a table in here on\nminimal network connections\n\n493\n00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.180\nspeeds that would be important,\nand you wanna take a look at this.\n\n494\n00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.900\nIf you scroll down here a little bit,\nyou will see right here.\n\n495\n00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.650\nCan we just go full screen for\njust a second?\n\n496\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.560\nJust so\neverybody can see what I'm pointing to.\n\n497\n00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.570\nRight here on the right, in the nav area,\n\n498\n00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.110\nyou'll see it his minimum\nnetwork connectivity speeds.\n\n499\n00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.890\nAnd it just lets you go right down there.\n\n500\n00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:34.360\nAnd you could see what the minimum\nnetwork connectivity speeds are.\n\n501\n00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.650\nYou'll see from the management server to\nan agent, we need at least 64 kilobits.\n\n502\n00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.390\nThat's the first item right here.\n\n503\n00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:41.490\nManagement Server,\n\n504\n00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.450\nif we're doing agentless we need\n1,024 kilobits or a gigabit.\n\n505\n00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:46.180\nTo do agentless,\n\n506\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.390\nwe'll talk about agent versus agentless\nand we'll get into that at some point.\n\n507\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.896\nManagement server to database 256k.\n\n508\n00:22:51.896 --> 00:22:53.280\nYou can kind of read through here.\n\n509\n00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.210\nManagement server to console\nthree quarters of a gigabit.\n\n510\n00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:59.182\nSo you could see that depending on what\nwe're doing and how we're doing it,\n\n511\n00:22:59.182 --> 00:23:00.398\nthere are some requirements.\n\n512\n00:23:00.398 --> 00:23:02.790\nAnd they go up as high as\na gigabyte of bandwidth.\n\n513\n00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.530\nThat's not a lot by today's standards.\n\n514\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.850\nBut coming in from outside remotely,\n\n515\n00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.590\nthat could be a lot if you're\non a low latency network.\n\n516\n00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.490\nOr rather, a high latency network,\nnot low latency.\n\n517\n00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.510\nIf you're on a low latency,\nthat's nothing, right?\n\n518\n00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.790\nBut on a high latency network,\nyou wanna make sure you're aware of that.\n\n519\n00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:19.570\nSo this is again, just one of those\nthings to consider and to be aware of.\n\n520\n00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.310\nGotta make sure that we're\nthinking about whether or\n\n521\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.290\nnot we have enough bandwidth\nto drive these connections.\n\n522\n00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:28.208\nAnd if so, are we provisioning out\nthe right kinds of connectivity?\n\n523\n00:23:28.208 --> 00:23:32.750\nIf not,\nthen we go back to the thought process of\n\n524\n00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.750\npotentially needing that gateway\nserver that we've been referring to.\n\n525\n00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:39.420\nTo deal with low latency\nsolutions where we don't have,\n\n526\n00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.340\nrather low latency solutions are good.\n\n527\n00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.670\nWe want high, I keep getting it backwards,\nhigh latency solutions.\n\n528\n00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.476\nThe idea being that if we\nare dealing with high latency,\n\n529\n00:23:47.476 --> 00:23:49.696\nwe'll have a lot of delay in transmission.\n\n530\n00:23:49.696 --> 00:23:51.977\nWe're going to need those gateway\nservers to help us deal with that.\n\n531\n00:23:51.977 --> 00:23:55.721\nBecause we don't have enough bandwidth to\nkeep that connection between the agent and\n\n532\n00:23:55.721 --> 00:23:58.150\nthe management servers\nrunning continuously.\n\n533\n00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:00.910\nAnd the gateway server will\nhopefully be well connected, but\n\n534\n00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.415\nthe gateway server can then deal with\nthe low connection capabilities of those\n\n535\n00:24:04.415 --> 00:24:07.674\nclients that are out there remotely and\nalso remember non domain joins.\n\n536\n00:24:07.674 --> 00:24:11.242\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that and\nthinking about that as well,\n\n537\n00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:14.195\ncuz that is gonna impact our\ndesign thought process here.\n\n538\n00:24:14.195 --> 00:24:15.760\nAnd we have to be\nthinking about whether or\n\n539\n00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.830\nnot that's something that we're gonna be\nable to address through good design or\n\n540\n00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.400\nwe have to address through\nchanging that around, right?\n\n541\n00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.400\nYeah, did I say gigabit?\n\n542\n00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.415\nI mean't meg, [INAUDIBLE] I guess gigabit.\n\n543\n00:24:26.415 --> 00:24:29.820\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember.\n&gt;&gt; 1,024 kilobits, 1 megabit of bandwidth.\n\n544\n00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.120\nThank you for pointing that out.\n\n545\n00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.610\nI meant megabit even\nthough I said gigabit.\n\n546\n00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.910\nBut in my mind I was saying megabit-\n&gt;&gt; We're just so used to gigabit now.\n\n547\n00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:36.745\n&gt;&gt; Well,-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n548\n00:24:36.745 --> 00:24:39.795\n&gt;&gt; Everything is gigabit, you don't\neven think about that, but yeah, anyway,\n\n549\n00:24:39.795 --> 00:24:41.260\nthat's exactly what I was thinking.\n\n550\n00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.870\nThank you for keeping me honest cuz\nevery so often the tongue moves and\n\n551\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.590\nthe mouth goes, but the brain doesn't\nalways engage at the right time.\n\n552\n00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.040\n&gt;&gt; Chatroom will keep you in check,\nbrother [LAUGH].\n\n553\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.480\n&gt;&gt; They do, they keep you honest.\n\n554\n00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.440\nAnd you gotta appreciate\nthat cuz that is important.\n\n555\n00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.970\nSo yes, and\nwe'll give credit where credit is due.\n\n556\n00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.070\nThank you Russell for\npointing that out and keeping us honest.\n\n557\n00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:02.500\nSo we have to think about the fact\nthat the designs we're envisioning,\n\n558\n00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.230\nthe designs we're laying out, have to make\nsure that we have this kind of bandwidth,\n\n559\n00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.690\nwe have the right connectivity.\n\n560\n00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.760\nWe've got the right amount of\ninformation moving back and forth.\n\n561\n00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.980\nSo using that, hey, what do I need to\nget it done website that we referred to,\n\n562\n00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.760\nit's gonna give you all these boxes you\ncan check off on your planning document\n\n563\n00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.710\nto make sure that you understand exactly,\nall the things are being addressed,\n\n564\n00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.820\nyou've got the right information,\nyou're making the right choices.\n\n565\n00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:30.860\nA megabit of bandwidth probably\nnot a big deal to find.\n\n566\n00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.690\nBut I do have customers in\ncertain parts of the world where\n\n567\n00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:37.050\nthat amount of bandwidth consistently,\nbetween remote sites and\n\n568\n00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:40.600\nmaybe a centrally managed IT hub,\nis problematic,\n\n569\n00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.310\nbecause they're not running on\ninfrastructure that is well connected.\n\n570\n00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.440\nThey're using slower infrastructure or,\nin some respects,\n\n571\n00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.280\njust may not have the infrastructure at\nall to drive that kind of connectivity and\n\n572\n00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.525\nthat's something to be aware of.\n\n573\n00:25:52.525 --> 00:25:56.320\nCuz that can be a limiting factor and it\nis something that we have to plan for and\n\n574\n00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.360\nat least be aware of.\n\n575\n00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.880\nSpecifically around connection and\n\n576\n00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.950\nconnectivity, connecting\nmanagement groups,\n\n577\n00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.750\nwe have to make sure that when we're\nthinking about this thought process and\n\n578\n00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:09.550\nscaling out, the idea is that we're gonna\nhave local management groups, and then\n\n579\n00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.780\nwe're going to have what you can think of\nas almost like a remote management group.\n\n580\n00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.445\nBut the idea of connecting management\ngroups, as I make my screen a mess.\n\n581\n00:26:16.445 --> 00:26:18.395\nConnecting management groups,\n\n582\n00:26:18.395 --> 00:26:22.125\ntwo or more management groups connected\ntogether, sharing information.\n\n583\n00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:24.875\nThings like alerts, tasks,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n584\n00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:28.305\nA single ops console, in other words,\ncan be used to manage alerts from multiple\n\n585\n00:26:28.305 --> 00:26:32.140\ndifferent operations manager environments\nusing connected management groups.\n\n586\n00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.660\nIf we go back to the diagram for\na second, what we're thinking about here\n\n587\n00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.900\nwould be this console sitting up here\nhaving multiple management groups\n\n588\n00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:44.000\navailable to it so that we're seeing\ndifferent management groups structured for\n\n589\n00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.970\ndifferent kinds of operations so\nwe can interact with them.\n\n590\n00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:51.380\nWe're only showing one here, but the idea\nis that we would then be able to see\n\n591\n00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.870\nmultiple management groups, multiple sets\nof management servers and their associated\n\n592\n00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:59.950\ninfrastructure and that would give us\nmore flexibility in the monitoring.\n\n593\n00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.660\nNow we can do that with what are known\nas connected management groups.\n\n594\n00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.458\nWe'll see multiple operations\nmanager environments coming in.\n\n595\n00:27:05.458 --> 00:27:08.410\nIt used to be like any other kind\nof console that would be running\n\n596\n00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.000\nmultiple areas.\n\n597\n00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.950\nIn VMware, for instance, we talk about\nvCenter being able to see an enhanced link\n\n598\n00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.590\nmode, multiple vCenters, and\nbeing able to see them linked together.\n\n599\n00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.380\nSo if you have multiple ones deployed\nthroughout the architecture,\n\n600\n00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.310\nwe can see them from one central console.\n\n601\n00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:28.600\nSame idea applies here, we could do this\nand see multiple infrastructure items.\n\n602\n00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.360\nAnd then we're able to see all of this\ncoming together and we can work with it.\n\n603\n00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.730\nMakes it a lot easier than having\nto login to each one as a one-off.\n\n604\n00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:40.940\nThe idea, though, is we gotta keep in mind\nthat we do not share information with and\n\n605\n00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.400\namong these management group.\n\n606\n00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.390\nEverything is local to\nthat management group.\n\n607\n00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:48.660\nWe could see it on the console, but all\nthat information is kept structured and\n\n608\n00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.550\nkept specific to that management group.\n\n609\n00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:55.180\nSo we are not pulling it all together in\none common database, and one common area.\n\n610\n00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.542\nWe are allowing us to be able to\njust see that information through\n\n611\n00:27:58.542 --> 00:27:59.880\nthe console all up.\n\n612\n00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.370\nBut we're keeping it segmented and\nisolated ultimately.\n\n613\n00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.900\nWe need ports 57, 23 and\n24 available for this.\n\n614\n00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.020\nWe've talked about this\non the firewall listing.\n\n615\n00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.500\nSo down here on the firewall,\n\n616\n00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.810\nwe'd have to make sure those\nports are open and running.\n\n617\n00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.720\nAll servers have to run the same\nversion of Ops Manager.\n\n618\n00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.520\nThis is a really important issue\nif we're going to be doing this,\n\n619\n00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.560\nwhich is we have mix matched patch\nlevels for the versions of Ops Manager.\n\n620\n00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.580\nThis kind of concept doesn't work.\n\n621\n00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.730\nEverything, and this is a standing rule\nof thumb in general, not just with our\n\n622\n00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.000\ninfrastructure with Microsoft but\nin general among most vendors.\n\n623\n00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.810\nYou got to be at the same level for\neverything so\n\n624\n00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.160\nthat all the infrastructure\nis operating the same way.\n\n625\n00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.400\nProtocols are being used the right way.\n\n626\n00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.130\nPorts are being called the right way.\n\n627\n00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:41.520\nEverything is standardized.\n\n628\n00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.980\nIf you have mismatches at all for\n\n629\n00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:47.590\nany reason, chances are good that\nthat's not really going to work well.\n\n630\n00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.260\nAnd so, just keep that in mind.\n\n631\n00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.660\nSame standardized default patch level,\nwhatever that may be.\n\n632\n00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:57.660\nIf you're using SCOM 2012 R2, update 2 or\nwhatever that is, it's gonna be\n\n633\n00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.830\napplied to all the infrastructure, so\nall of the management servers, right?\n\n634\n00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:05.380\nThe consoles have to be updated,\nif necessary, reporting infrastructure,\n\n635\n00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.770\ndatabase infrastructure,\nappropriate version of the agents.\n\n636\n00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.600\nThe agent version is tied to\nthe deployment version of SCOM.\n\n637\n00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.900\nSo you have to have the right\nversion of agents running.\n\n638\n00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.840\nSee, there's a lot of subtlety that\nwould have to be addressed here.\n\n639\n00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.790\nBut.\n&gt;&gt; Adam, really quickly,\n\n640\n00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:23.600\nif you did have differing versions that\nyou were employing at one given time,\n\n641\n00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.410\nwould there be an error that came up?\n\n642\n00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:29.249\nOr would it actually kind of work, but\nyou might find things being inconsistent?\n\n643\n00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.280\n&gt;&gt; You would probably get a little bit of\nboth, depending on what you were doing.\n\n644\n00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.520\nSo you would get, if you want to do\ncertain things that may not be supported\n\n645\n00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.290\nby version, you would get an error.\n\n646\n00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:40.830\nA standard, hey, this isn't working, or\nsome sort of nondescript error that you\n\n647\n00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:43.225\nwould have to then reason through and\nfigure out logically.\n\n648\n00:29:43.225 --> 00:29:46.450\nCuz we're not always the best\nat giving you intelligent and\n\n649\n00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.760\neasy to follow error guidance.\n\n650\n00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not working,\n\n651\n00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.170\nthat's like what we get.\n\n652\n00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.510\nBut you would see errors for\nsome of that stuff.\n\n653\n00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.840\nSome of it may not be error\nprone because it may not require\n\n654\n00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.230\nanything specific to a certain version to\njust show you the console information.\n\n655\n00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.740\nBut as you start delving in and\nactually starting to look at stuff,\n\n656\n00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.650\nthat's when you tend to\nactually get those errors.\n\n657\n00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:07.500\nSo you would see a little bit of both,\nbut you would begin to see errors and\n\n658\n00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.200\nthings will not work the right way.\n\n659\n00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.790\nAlso the System Center\ndata acts as service and\n\n660\n00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.120\nSystem Center management\nconfiguration service account.\n\n661\n00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.140\nGotta read those out of my notes,\nbecause that's a mouthful to say.\n\n662\n00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.820\nBut are two services accounts\nthat are used for data access and\n\n663\n00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:25.185\nconfiguration are those in the local\nmanagement group have to be added in to\n\n664\n00:30:25.185 --> 00:30:29.640\nthe Ops Manager administrator user's\nrole in the connected management group.\n\n665\n00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.360\nIn other words, we have to take every one\nof those management groups that are local,\n\n666\n00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.050\nand add their accounts in so that we\ncan see them all up in the console.\n\n667\n00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.330\nSo that way,\nwe're able to actually interact with, and\n\n668\n00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.150\nif you think about the logic of it,\nbe able to move down into those\n\n669\n00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.710\nmanagement servers, see them all up,\nand pull that information back.\n\n670\n00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:49.610\nSo there is gonna be subtlety\nassociated with this configuration.\n\n671\n00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:50.765\nThere's some good guidance and\n\n672\n00:30:50.765 --> 00:30:54.361\nhow-to guidance online on the websites\nwe've been talking about about that has\n\n673\n00:30:54.361 --> 00:30:57.570\na setup connected management groups\nif you wanna go down that road.\n\n674\n00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:01.190\nYou can do connected management groups\nacross a trust boundary as well.\n\n675\n00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:05.650\nSo how do we essentially get them set up\nbetween un-trusted entities we could do\n\n676\n00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:06.630\nthis as well.\n\n677\n00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:08.760\nHave to have the ports\navailable that we talked about,\n\n678\n00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.748\nDNS resolution has to be up and running.\n\n679\n00:31:10.748 --> 00:31:12.663\nSo we gotta have DNS be\nable to resolve everything,\n\n680\n00:31:12.663 --> 00:31:14.720\ngotta have those user accounts\nwe were talking about.\n\n681\n00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.199\nAnd we've gotta make sure that we have the\nappropriate credentials used to connect,\n\n682\n00:31:19.199 --> 00:31:22.244\nbut we can bring in these different and\ndisparate areas and\n\n683\n00:31:22.244 --> 00:31:26.435\nmanage them all up in this one console\nview using connected management groups.\n\n684\n00:31:26.435 --> 00:31:30.539\nAnd this is going to be very important for\nus, because we haven't had this capability\n\n685\n00:31:30.539 --> 00:31:33.733\nin every version of SCOM,\nthis is a newer thought process as well.\n\n686\n00:31:33.733 --> 00:31:39.780\nBut gives us a lot more ability and depth\nto manage across a global enterprise.\n\n687\n00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:43.034\nIf you think about the logic of your\nglobally deployed infrastructure,\n\n688\n00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:46.610\nthis is gonna give us the ability to\nscale that infrastructure globally.\n\n689\n00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:50.230\nAnd then, manage it, instead of having\nto have 20 different consoles for\n\n690\n00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.680\nevery set of management\nserver pools we use,\n\n691\n00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.220\nwe can open up a console that brings\nthat all together in one place.\n\n692\n00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.190\nThis is true enterprise architecture, and\n\n693\n00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:01.100\nthis is true enterprise\nmanagement at a global scale.\n\n694\n00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.900\nSo this is gonna be a really\nimportant concept for us.\n\n695\n00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\na lot of moving parts going on here for\n\n696\n00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:08.050\ngetting this deployment ready set,\nand to go.\n\n697\n00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:12.360\nThat being said, we've only shaken out\none drawer inside of this dresser, so\n\n698\n00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.930\nwe're going to have to continue\non with multiple parts.\n\n699\n00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:19.080\nWe're out of time for this one, but Adam,\nyou've gotten us a pretty good idea of how\n\n700\n00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.465\nwe need to start planning, start thinking,\nto get this deployment, and deployed, and\n\n701\n00:32:23.465 --> 00:32:25.696\ngets [CROSSTALK] that's right,\nI like that.\n\n702\n00:32:25.696 --> 00:32:28.273\n&gt;&gt; Double deployment [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like being redundant\n\n703\n00:32:28.273 --> 00:32:30.343\nto make sure it drives the point home,\nright?\n\n704\n00:32:30.343 --> 00:32:32.440\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; So that being said, we'll be back for\n\n705\n00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.940\na part two,\nhopefully you guys will join us.\n\n706\n00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.790\nThank you for joining us thus far.\n\n707\n00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:37.240\nAdam, thank you as well.\n\n708\n00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.640\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n709\n00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.225\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n710\n00:32:42.225 --> 00:32:50.266\n[MUSIC]\n\n711\n00:32:50.266 --> 00:32:53.085\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:10.804\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:12.241\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.526\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:16.583\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.782\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.782 --> 00:00:22.141\nAnd in today's episode we are back\nwith more Data Center Monitoring with\n\n9\n00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:23.220\nMicrosoft SCOM.\n\n10\n00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.357\nAnd of course, joining us for a part two\nin looking at how we get this thing up and\n\n11\n00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:27.941\nrunning.\n\n12\n00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:29.626\nWhat do we gotta do to config?\n\n13\n00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:33.343\nThese groups, these management groups,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:33.343 --> 00:00:34.830\nAdam welcome back, sir.\n\n15\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.721\nHow's it going?\n\n16\n00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:38.617\n&gt;&gt; Doo da, doo da, all the doo da day.\n\n17\n00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:39.405\nIt is going well.\n\n18\n00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:40.430\nIt is going well.\n\n19\n00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.180\nWe are going to continue talking\nabout how to do an installation.\n\n20\n00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.609\nSpecifically, how do we destroy.\n\n21\n00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.000\nNo, not how do we destroy.\n\n22\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.640\nHow do we set up the distributed\nsystem architecture?\n\n23\n00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.690\nFor the ops manager management group\nthat Daniel was talking about.\n\n24\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.930\nThere is a very specific order\nwe have to engage here around.\n\n25\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.470\nIf we willy nilly, you could say forsooth\nbut that would be inaccurate usage,\n\n26\n00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.450\nif we willy nilly that destroyed\ndeployment as I was suggesting,\n\n27\n00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.200\nlet's step back and\nactually do that the right way.\n\n28\n00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.800\nIf we actually do a distribution and\na setup of this architecture.\n\n29\n00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.870\nBut don't follow a certain order.\n\n30\n00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.310\nBad things are going to happen.\n\n31\n00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.330\nThings like,\nremember the Star Trek episode?\n\n32\n00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.295\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; The [INAUDIBLE].\n\n33\n00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:21.442\nThe two.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:21.442 --> 00:01:21.942\n&gt;&gt; You do, right?\n\n35\n00:01:21.942 --> 00:01:23.685\nThe original series.\n\n36\n00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:24.825\nNot the ones that have come later,\n\n37\n00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:25.610\nas we were talking about.\n\n38\n00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.173\nBut the ones where you had the two\nguys that were half black, half white.\n\n39\n00:01:28.173 --> 00:01:28.822\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n40\n00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:30.593\nRemember?\nThey look like Linzer Torte cookies or\n\n41\n00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:31.475\nsomething like that.\n\n42\n00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:32.035\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n43\n00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:35.451\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you remember, if they met right?\n\n44\n00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:37.680\nThey're constantly trying\nto find each other.\n\n45\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.127\nIf they met and they were actually\nable to connect together,\n\n46\n00:01:42.127 --> 00:01:45.537\nthen they would end\nthe universe as we know it.\n\n47\n00:01:45.537 --> 00:01:47.392\nThere was that other one,\nLazarus, I think it was called.\n\n48\n00:01:47.392 --> 00:01:51.400\nAnd what of Lazarus, or who,\nwho will or something like that.\n\n49\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.036\nThe one where you had the two\nalter egos of the same guy,\n\n50\n00:01:54.036 --> 00:01:55.992\nkind of the guy with the scraggly beard.\n\n51\n00:01:55.992 --> 00:01:59.935\nAnd if they met outside the chamber or the\nbox in the hyper universe that was like\n\n52\n00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:03.306\nbetween the other two they would\ndestroy all known living matter.\n\n53\n00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:04.872\nYeah that was [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That's a lot\n\n54\n00:02:04.872 --> 00:02:06.332\nof despair in an old Star Trek episode.\n\n55\n00:02:06.332 --> 00:02:07.595\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There were yeah,\n\n56\n00:02:07.595 --> 00:02:09.460\nyou look back on it now and\nyou're like how?\n\n57\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.580\nWow, it was just heavy duty downer, so\n\n58\n00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.480\nif we had something like that,\nbad things would happen.\n\n59\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.400\nBut we're not gonna have that because\nwe're gonna show you how to avoid,\n\n60\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.560\nmaking sure that you don't\nmake these mistakes.\n\n61\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.980\nWanna make sure that you\ndo this the right way,\n\n62\n00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.180\nso we're gonna talk about\nthe specific order of installation.\n\n63\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.178\nIf we take a look right\nover here real quick,\n\n64\n00:02:27.178 --> 00:02:30.151\nwe do have a website that'll help\nus just make sure we track this.\n\n65\n00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:33.235\nThe top of this one, just so\ncan take a look here,\n\n66\n00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:37.010\ndistributed deployment of\nthe operations manager.\n\n67\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.259\nAnd when we do this.\n\n68\n00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.440\nWe go down to about three\nquarters the way down.\n\n69\n00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.196\nUnderneath all the just standard\nstuff you gotta take a look at.\n\n70\n00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.886\nWhen we get down towards the bottom here,\n\n71\n00:02:45.886 --> 00:02:48.168\nyou'll see we've actually\ngot step by step guidance.\n\n72\n00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.356\nI'm gonna break this out and\ntalk you through it.\n\n73\n00:02:50.356 --> 00:02:54.310\nBut we've got step by step guidance\non deployment guides for each thing.\n\n74\n00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.450\nHow do we deploy our first management\nserver into the management group.\n\n75\n00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.860\nHow do we follow-up with\nadditional management servers.\n\n76\n00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.370\nHow do we setup and\ninstall the ops console.\n\n77\n00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.655\nHow do we then configure\nthe ops console for\n\n78\n00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:07.952\nuse with SSL when we're doing reporting?\n\n79\n00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:10.480\nEvery step along the way is detailed out.\n\n80\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.440\nYou just click through\nthe appropriate link and\n\n81\n00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.380\nit takes you to step by step guidance.\n\n82\n00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.147\nSo for instance just while\nwe're doing this in real time,\n\n83\n00:03:17.147 --> 00:03:20.262\nlet's just open up how do we deploy\nour first management server.\n\n84\n00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:22.938\nAnd what we're gonna see\nhere in just a moment is,\n\n85\n00:03:22.938 --> 00:03:24.738\nwe're going to get to a website.\n\n86\n00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:28.340\nIt's going to give us the actual\nstep by step guidance right there.\n\n87\n00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.530\nHow to install our first\nmanagement server.\n\n88\n00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.553\nWalks us through the specifics.\n\n89\n00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:36.701\nYou're going to see me do this as part of\na demonstration in a little while from now\n\n90\n00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:38.600\non a few episodes going forward.\n\n91\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.750\nBut we give you the specific steps\ninvolved what do I click on,\n\n92\n00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.870\nhow do I do it, where do I go from there?\n\n93\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.190\nAnd if you just follow through all the\nsteps here, you've got a ready made cook\n\n94\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.590\nbook that is gonna tell you exactly\nhow to get this up and running.\n\n95\n00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.320\nHow do we do it from\nthe Command Prompt gotta whole set\n\n96\n00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.815\nof information that will\nhelp us do it right here.\n\n97\n00:03:56.815 --> 00:03:59.480\nYou wanna pre-made script that's\ngonna let you automate that,\n\n98\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.440\nyou can do it all that\nright from there as well.\n\n99\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.200\nSo we've got all that\ninformation available to you.\n\n100\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.050\nIf you're interested.\n\n101\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.390\nMicrosoft's put it all together,\njust gotta know where to look.\n\n102\n00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.009\nSo gonna make sure you have that link.\n\n103\n00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:12.220\nAnd you can obviously follow through\nthis on your own, step by step.\n\n104\n00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.870\nHearing me talk about it for\na few minutes,\n\n105\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.600\nseeing me do it,\nis a great way to kick start that.\n\n106\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.150\nBut you may need a little more detail.\n\n107\n00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.650\nAnd obviously, wanna make sure you\ncan be provided that information,\n\n108\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.850\nthat level of engagement, if necessary.\n\n109\n00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.770\nSo the first management server,\nthat's where we begin our journey.\n\n110\n00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.290\nWe start off there,\noperational database and\n\n111\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.720\nthe data warehouse databases\nare created as part of this\n\n112\n00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.360\ninstallation initially on\nthe specified SQL Server instance.\n\n113\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.200\nAs we go through this install,\nmanagement group will be named, so\n\n114\n00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.470\nyou'll have to come up with\na management group name.\n\n115\n00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.220\nThe account credentials for the following\noperations manager's accounts\n\n116\n00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.220\nwill be specified during this install.\n\n117\n00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.050\nWe've talked about these four types\nalready if you remember the prior\n\n118\n00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.729\nepisode, right?\n\n119\n00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.470\nAction account,\nthe System Center Config Service and\n\n120\n00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.110\nSystem Center Data Access Service\naccounts, the data reader and\n\n121\n00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.990\nthe data writer.\n\n122\n00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.870\nYou'll specify all of these, detailing out\nwhat they are, what credential to be used,\n\n123\n00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.310\nwhat password will be used.\n\n124\n00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.600\nWe can install the ops console\nat this phase if we choose to.\n\n125\n00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.889\nYou'll notice the Ops Console as\nwe talk about this is flexible.\n\n126\n00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.150\nYou can put it in right away up front\nwith the first management server.\n\n127\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.000\nWe can do it on the second phase\nwhen we're installing additional\n\n128\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.110\nmanagement servers.\n\n129\n00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.200\nWe can do it as a standalone step\nin the process, quote unquote,\n\n130\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.110\nstep three after primary and secondary\nmanagement servers have been installed.\n\n131\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.451\nSo we could do the Ops Console\nat various phases along the way.\n\n132\n00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:33.170\nIt's really up to us to decide.\n\n133\n00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.860\nAnd you'll see these options\nwhen I do the install demo where\n\n134\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.200\nwe can just check off the box to\ninstall the ops console or not.\n\n135\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.620\nStep two,\nsecond management server installed.\n\n136\n00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.573\nWe select at this point as we run\nthe install add a management server to\n\n137\n00:05:45.573 --> 00:05:48.177\nan existing management\ngroup as the option.\n\n138\n00:05:48.177 --> 00:05:50.650\nHave to have the name of\nthe management group, obviously.\n\n139\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.460\nSpecify the computer name for\n\n140\n00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.990\nthe SQL Server install instance that's\ngonna host the Ops Manager database.\n\n141\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.240\nCuz we have to refer to that, connect to\nthat to register the management server.\n\n142\n00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.730\nThe account credentials\nthat are necessary here.\n\n143\n00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.060\nThe Action Account, and\nthe System Center Config service, and\n\n144\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.530\nSystem Center Data Access Service Accounts\nwill be required.\n\n145\n00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.000\nAgain, install the console at this\nstep if you would like, up to you.\n\n146\n00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.076\nIf not in step three, quote on quote\ninstall the ops console separately at that\n\n147\n00:06:18.076 --> 00:06:20.980\npoint, if you've already\ninstalled the ops console,\n\n148\n00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.848\nthen you would skip over\nwhat I'm calling step three.\n\n149\n00:06:23.848 --> 00:06:28.180\nAnd you would simply move into installing\nthe ops manager reporting server.\n\n150\n00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.419\nNow, you're typically\ngonna wanna reporting,\n\n151\n00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.885\ncould you in theory set this whole\nthing up and then not use reporting?\n\n152\n00:06:35.885 --> 00:06:38.600\nYeah, I mean in theory you\nmay not want to run report,\n\n153\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.170\nbut that doesn't mean you can set\nup ops manager without having\n\n154\n00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.960\nthe report server available because all\nthe management packs come with reports.\n\n155\n00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.920\nAnd your're gonna need to have access to\nthat functionality to make this work.\n\n156\n00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.150\nSo step four, depending on how\nyou're counting, maybe step three.\n\n157\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.320\nInstall the ops manager reporting server.\n\n158\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.235\nRemember we specify management server,\n\n159\n00:06:57.235 --> 00:07:00.700\nthat's gonna be separate from\nthe management server pool.\n\n160\n00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.190\nAnd that is going to be used to\nhost the reporting services.\n\n161\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.540\nCould we go just for\na second to the machine.\n\n162\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.728\nJust wanna remind you of\nthis as we take a look.\n\n163\n00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:13.060\nThese are our management servers down\nhere that are specified as being just\n\n164\n00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.470\nmanagement servers, right?\n\n165\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.160\nThey're in the pool,\nthey're doing management server stuff.\n\n166\n00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.130\nLet's say a theory,\n\n167\n00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.270\nif we go left to right,\nthis was our first management server.\n\n168\n00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.220\nOur second and third one that we've\ninstalled in the prior steps.\n\n169\n00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.380\nThe console up here, the opps console,\nmay or may not have been installed.\n\n170\n00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.480\nThe one in the prior steps\nare installed separately in step three.\n\n171\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.550\nWe're now building out a separate\nmanagement server dedicated to reporting.\n\n172\n00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.900\nWe're gonna talk about that\nas being that thing up here,\n\n173\n00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.990\nthat's up at the upper\nright in our diagram.\n\n174\n00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.350\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n175\n00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.865\nWe select the SQL server instance.\n\n176\n00:07:42.865 --> 00:07:44.833\nIt's going to host SQL\nserver reporting services.\n\n177\n00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:49.061\nWe have to install that locally onto the\ncomputer that will host the ops manager\n\n178\n00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:50.611\nreporting server meeting.\n\n179\n00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:54.976\nOn that box right up here,\nwe're going to install and configure SSRS.\n\n180\n00:07:54.976 --> 00:07:58.275\nSo that it can host locally and\nbe using that service.\n\n181\n00:07:58.275 --> 00:08:03.153\nThe SSRS databases, we have two report\nserver and report server temp DB\n\n182\n00:08:03.153 --> 00:08:07.560\ncan be installed remotely on\na separate SQL cluster somewhere.\n\n183\n00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.970\nSo they don't have to\nbe running on this box.\n\n184\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.250\nThey could be running in\nthe same SQL cluster or\n\n185\n00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.960\ninstall where all the other\ndatabases are running.\n\n186\n00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.890\nTypically, they wind up running altogether\nin some sort of SQL farm on the back end.\n\n187\n00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.780\nBut that will be up to you to decide.\n\n188\n00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.492\nSo we could have the remote\ninstall of SQL for\n\n189\n00:08:23.492 --> 00:08:26.950\nthe databases to back end\nthe S S R S databases if need be.\n\n190\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:27.940\nWhat do we need do we need for this?\n\n191\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.190\nWe need the data reader account.\n\n192\n00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.490\nBecause remember the data reader\naccount is used to interact with\n\n193\n00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.090\nthe Ops Manager data warehouse.\n\n194\n00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.180\nJust be aware of that.\n\n195\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.920\nWe'll install the web console.\n\n196\n00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.190\nSo the Ops Manager web console,\nthis portion of the console up here.\n\n197\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.320\nThere's two distinct consoles, that this\ngraphic is just kind of meant to refer to.\n\n198\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.230\nThe web console can be installed on\nany existing management server, or\n\n199\n00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.460\ninstalled separately.\n\n200\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:56.300\nIn our diagram here, the OpsManager and\nweb consoles are running out on their own,\n\n201\n00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.730\nprobably on an admin\nworkstation somewhere right?\n\n202\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.720\nSo they're available as stand alones.\n\n203\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.150\nBut they could actually just be installed\nup on a management server if need be.\n\n204\n00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.030\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n205\n00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.710\nSo we'll be putting that out there.\n\n206\n00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.480\nWe can add them in.\n\n207\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.104\nBut we have to keep in mind that if we\nchoose to install the management server,\n\n208\n00:09:15.104 --> 00:09:19.102\nrather choose to bundle the web\nconsole onto a management server.\n\n209\n00:09:19.102 --> 00:09:22.660\nWe have to think about the logic\nof this and how we do this, right?\n\n210\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.246\nIf we want to go ahead and\nset up the web console on a server,\n\n211\n00:09:27.246 --> 00:09:30.909\nwe have to go ahead and\nmake sure that we do not.\n\n212\n00:09:30.909 --> 00:09:35.756\nOr can not in our mind, just know we can\nnot add the management server feature to\n\n213\n00:09:35.756 --> 00:09:38.766\na computer that already\nhas the web console, but\n\n214\n00:09:38.766 --> 00:09:42.900\nwe can add the web console onto\nan existing management server.\n\n215\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.602\nIn other words, any one of these\nmanagement servers can host a web console\n\n216\n00:09:46.602 --> 00:09:50.256\nafter install, but if we choose to\ninstall the web console separately.\n\n217\n00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.358\nWe cannot then go and\nconvert that separate box where the web\n\n218\n00:09:53.358 --> 00:09:56.140\nconsole's running into\na management server.\n\n219\n00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.360\nBecause the way the install is set up,\nit would prevent us from doing that.\n\n220\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.887\nSo little just gotcha there,\nnot a big deal.\n\n221\n00:10:01.887 --> 00:10:04.715\nYou're not in the habit of installing\nthe web console separately and\n\n222\n00:10:04.715 --> 00:10:07.750\nthen trying to convert that box into\na management server traditionally.\n\n223\n00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.563\nBut just in case you thought about that,\nyou would wanna be aware of that as well.\n\n224\n00:10:11.563 --> 00:10:13.219\nThe application diagnostics and\n\n225\n00:10:13.219 --> 00:10:16.000\napplication advisor consoles\nare also installed.\n\n226\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.640\nSo I just wanna make sure you're aware\nof the fact that, as we talked about\n\n227\n00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.990\nthose consoles wind up being bundled\ntogether up here traditionally.\n\n228\n00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.660\nWe need the name of the management serve\nthat the web console's gonna use, and\n\n229\n00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.490\njust point it to that\nwhen we do the install.\n\n230\n00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.627\nNo big deal there, pretty easy to do.\n\n231\n00:10:29.627 --> 00:10:31.772\nIf we're gonna be doing a gateway server,\nand\n\n232\n00:10:31.772 --> 00:10:34.090\nyou can see our gateway\nserver sitting down here.\n\n233\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.280\nWe've talked about this,\n\n234\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.540\nwhere we have non-domain joined\ninfrastructure we need to manage.\n\n235\n00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.030\nRemember our magic number there, simply\nfive or more machines sitting outside\n\n236\n00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.720\nof the LDAP directory that we\nneed to then bring in and manage.\n\n237\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.990\nWhen we get to that threshold,\nmore often than not,\n\n238\n00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.010\nthat's when we'll deploy\nthe gateway server.\n\n239\n00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.560\nSo, what do we do to run\nthe gateway server install?\n\n240\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.430\nDetailed instructions on the website that\nwe were talking about, high level, right?\n\n241\n00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.900\nWe'll go through request certificates for\n\n242\n00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.720\nthe gateway server in\nthe management server.\n\n243\n00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.360\nSo we'll have our PKI infrastructure,\n\n244\n00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.890\nmost likely sitting inside the LDAP\ndirectory inside Active Directory.\n\n245\n00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.860\nWhile the AD CS, Active Directory\nCertificate Service's running most likely,\n\n246\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.695\nwe'll generate certificates\nfrom the certificate interface\n\n247\n00:11:13.695 --> 00:11:15.545\ndistribute those out and deploy them.\n\n248\n00:11:15.545 --> 00:11:18.595\nWe're not showing that on the diagram,\nbut we would have a domain controller\n\n249\n00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:22.335\nsomewhere running those services,\ngenerating those certificates.\n\n250\n00:11:22.335 --> 00:11:26.350\nImport certificates,\nusing the MOMCertImport.exe tool,\n\n251\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.833\nit's a tool that's found\nin the SCOM install media.\n\n252\n00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:33.807\nYou can, then, grab that tool,\nuse it to do the certificate import copy\n\n253\n00:11:33.807 --> 00:11:36.827\nthe\nMicrosoft.enterprisemanagement.gatewayapp-\n\n254\n00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:39.221\nrovaltool.exc to the management server,\n\n255\n00:11:39.221 --> 00:11:42.270\nanother tool that is found\nin the install media.\n\n256\n00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.320\nWe have to run the enterprise\nmanagement gateway approval tool and\n\n257\n00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.950\nwhen we run that we set up and configure\ncommunication between the gateway server\n\n258\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.450\nand between the management server\nthat it is going to be bound to.\n\n259\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.860\nSo we're gonna run two sets\nof tools that we have to use.\n\n260\n00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.910\nThe MOM certificate import tool and\n\n261\n00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.260\nthen the Microsoft Enterprise\nManagement Gateway Approval Tool.\n\n262\n00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.580\nThese two tools are used in concert\nwith one another to setup and configure\n\n263\n00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.800\nthe infrastructure, the certificates and\nthe connectivity required between\n\n264\n00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.160\nthe gateway and the management server\nrecord, the one we're gonna bind it to.\n\n265\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.670\nOnce all those things are done,\nwe start the install,\n\n266\n00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.060\nwe point the gateway server to\nthe management server question.\n\n267\n00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.210\nWe give it the name and the account\ncredentials that'll be used for\n\n268\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.460\nthe gateway action account,\nwe'll specify that.\n\n269\n00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.014\nRemember local system, local computer and\nor domain account can be used and then,\n\n270\n00:12:30.014 --> 00:12:31.042\nwe're up and running.\n\n271\n00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.550\nIt's fairly straightforward.\n\n272\n00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.670\nThe little nuts and\nbolts got your steps there.\n\n273\n00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.703\nAre making sure you have\naccess to the tools and\n\n274\n00:12:36.703 --> 00:12:39.013\nthat you're using the right\ntool at the right step.\n\n275\n00:12:39.013 --> 00:12:40.564\nYou have to import the certificates,\n\n276\n00:12:40.564 --> 00:12:42.554\nbefore you do the configuration\nto the gateway.\n\n277\n00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:45.604\nYou have to export the certificates\nfrom the ADS console and\n\n278\n00:12:45.604 --> 00:12:47.255\nmake sure they're available.\n\n279\n00:12:47.255 --> 00:12:50.375\nYou just got to make sure you follow\nall the logic of the steps there, but\n\n280\n00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:51.527\nnot very difficult to do.\n\n281\n00:12:51.527 --> 00:12:53.090\nPretty straightforward actually.\n\n282\n00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.930\nYou may or may not choose to\ninstall what's called ACS,\n\n283\n00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.628\nthe audit collection services.\n\n284\n00:12:57.628 --> 00:12:59.440\nThis would be step seven in theory.\n\n285\n00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.230\nIf we did everything step by step and\ndid the console as a separate step.\n\n286\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.485\nIf we combine the console, the ops console\nas one of the earlier stepped installs.\n\n287\n00:13:07.485 --> 00:13:09.325\nStep one or\ntwo where we did the primary or\n\n288\n00:13:09.325 --> 00:13:12.915\nsecondary management servers,\nthen this in theory will be step six.\n\n289\n00:13:12.915 --> 00:13:14.115\nJust to keep track of everything.\n\n290\n00:13:14.115 --> 00:13:16.458\nExcept on Tuesday where you subtract two,\n\n291\n00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:19.786\nadd three because it's a leap year and\nyou wind up with five.\n\n292\n00:13:19.786 --> 00:13:22.435\nBut that would just be really\na question of how you do that.\n\n293\n00:13:22.435 --> 00:13:25.065\nActually totally random aside,\nso related nothing,\n\n294\n00:13:25.065 --> 00:13:27.065\nabsolutely nothing to what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n295\n00:13:27.065 --> 00:13:28.980\nBut interesting when we\ntalk about mathematics.\n\n296\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.520\nSo yeah, I was doing a whole bunch of\nencryption stuff as you are aware of.\n\n297\n00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.801\nAnd we were talking about the birthday\nattack, birthday problem, and\n\n298\n00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:39.518\nthe whole idea of how we can figure out\nusing a statistical well known statistical\n\n299\n00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:41.341\nproblem called the birthday paradox.\n\n300\n00:13:41.341 --> 00:13:44.150\nHow easy it may be to reach\ninto a random key set or\n\n301\n00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.452\nset of keys and\ntry to break a cryptographic solution and\n\n302\n00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:51.752\nfigure out what the likelihood is,\nthe odds are, that we could do that.\n\n303\n00:13:51.752 --> 00:13:54.068\nAnd using that mathematics\nworking backwards,\n\n304\n00:13:54.068 --> 00:13:58.133\nwhen we think about what it would take to\nactually generate 100% lock on the key and\n\n305\n00:13:58.133 --> 00:14:00.630\nthis is something you've\ngot to think about.\n\n306\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.979\nYou have to take into effect the fact\nthat when you do the birthday problem,\n\n307\n00:14:03.979 --> 00:14:07.754\nspecifically to how many days it will take\nor what's the likelihood of how many users\n\n308\n00:14:07.754 --> 00:14:10.007\nto get two randomly\nassociated people in a group.\n\n309\n00:14:10.007 --> 00:14:11.953\nAnd what the number is to\nhave the same birthday,\n\n310\n00:14:11.953 --> 00:14:13.568\nyou got to take into account leap years,\n\n311\n00:14:13.568 --> 00:14:17.030\nwhich people don't often think about\nbecause they only happen every so often.\n\n312\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.798\nBut you have to actually factor in a leap\nyear in order to get the answer to\n\n313\n00:14:19.798 --> 00:14:20.730\nthe question correct.\n\n314\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.931\nSo it's kind of interesting that you\nhave to take account some of those\n\n315\n00:14:22.931 --> 00:14:24.030\nthings every so often.\n\n316\n00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.520\nHaving nothing to do with what we're\ndoing here however, totally random.\n\n317\n00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.480\nBut we try to give you extra\ninformation when we talk about it.\n\n318\n00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.618\n&gt;&gt; Well it definitely points to the fact\nthat we have to pay attention to\n\n319\n00:14:31.618 --> 00:14:35.158\nthe details because without the details,\nwe come up with the wrong answer.\n\n320\n00:14:35.158 --> 00:14:38.752\nAnd doing something like this, if you\nforget one of the details you could be\n\n321\n00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:42.422\ndoing a lot of backtracking or even\ncompletely starting over from scratch.\n\n322\n00:14:42.422 --> 00:14:45.078\n[CROSSTALK] Raise your hand if\nyou've ever had that problem before.\n\n323\n00:14:45.078 --> 00:14:48.071\nSo it does pay to pay attention.\n\n324\n00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:49.550\n&gt;&gt; I do agree with you there, sir.\n\n325\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.570\nAnd I'm just actually off to\nthe side here for half a second.\n\n326\n00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:56.850\nOnly cuz I just wanted to bring\nback up this particular website and\n\n327\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.990\nget out of that one and\nlet me go back here.\n\n328\n00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.810\nThe reason I just wanna bring this up real\nquick while we're talking is I just wanna\n\n329\n00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.050\nshow you how to actually\ndo the ACS deployment.\n\n330\n00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.290\nWe're gonna talk about that.\n\n331\n00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.760\nJust gonna bring that particular\nwebsite up specifically the steps.\n\n332\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.010\nCuz there is a script that you can follow\nwhere you can actually go ahead and\n\n333\n00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:18.830\ninstall all of the ACS components and\nactually everything associated with it.\n\n334\n00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.477\nAll the core components of Ops Manager.\n\n335\n00:15:21.477 --> 00:15:26.610\nBut you're gonna go in when we do ACS and\nI'm just gonna talk about ACS first.\n\n336\n00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.084\nThe auto control or\nauto collections services rather.\n\n337\n00:15:30.084 --> 00:15:32.647\nWhen you set up and\ninstall ACS this is gonna allow us and\n\n338\n00:15:32.647 --> 00:15:34.930\nyou could see on the site,\nif we go full screen for\n\n339\n00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.730\njust a second it'll be a little\nbit easier to see this.\n\n340\n00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.296\nYou could see here,\nwell kind of easier anyway.\n\n341\n00:15:40.296 --> 00:15:44.085\nYour gonna be able to use this to\nessentially collect records generated by\n\n342\n00:15:44.085 --> 00:15:45.010\nauto policies.\n\n343\n00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.470\nAnd store them centrally.\n\n344\n00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.330\nAnd then allow us to interact\nwith that report on it,\n\n345\n00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.437\nunderstand what's happening and\nderive that information through SSRS.\n\n346\n00:15:53.437 --> 00:15:58.631\nSo this is gonna be helpful to us when we\nare looking to do this kind of reporting.\n\n347\n00:15:58.631 --> 00:16:02.270\nIt's an optional step most people\ndon't actually tend to do this.\n\n348\n00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.629\nBut it may be helpful.\n\n349\n00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:04.627\nYou'll go in.\n\n350\n00:16:04.627 --> 00:16:07.780\nYou can see what we can actually\nuse this for, Unix, Linux.\n\n351\n00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.550\nWe can use this to get information\nfrom those systems as well.\n\n352\n00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:14.160\nSo bringing that information\nin would be helpful for\n\n353\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.528\nus to think about and potentially to use.\n\n354\n00:16:16.528 --> 00:16:20.790\nWhat I wanted to show you, we script\nthat will automate this whole process.\n\n355\n00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.470\nLet me just scroll down here.\n\n356\n00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.370\nSo we can take a look.\n\n357\n00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.050\nThere we go right there.\n\n358\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.610\nSo if we're gonna install and\nwe are gonna automate the installation\n\n359\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.640\nof the system center ops manager\nfront to back, top to bottom.\n\n360\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.010\nAll steps in order doing\neverything we've been discussing.\n\n361\n00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.490\nA script to do that will\nlook something like this.\n\n362\n00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.280\nYou would run setup.exe\nwith the silent switch.\n\n363\n00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.010\nWith or without silent will be up to you.\n\n364\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.800\nBut silent would be to automate\nusing all the options in the script.\n\n365\n00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.910\nThen install, so the install switch.\n\n366\n00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.200\nAnd then all of these switches\nthat are laid out here.\n\n367\n00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.060\nWhat are the components of\nthe component switch OM server,\n\n368\n00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:00.770\nOPs manager sever, OM console,\nOM when console, OM reporting.\n\n369\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.495\nThen you'll see management group name\nswitch, specify the management group name,\n\n370\n00:17:04.495 --> 00:17:07.520\nSQL Server Instance, specify the instance.\n\n371\n00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.150\nThe database name for operation database,\nDW SQL Server Instance for\n\n372\n00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.320\nthe data warehouse.\n\n373\n00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.900\nSpecify that name Use local system\naction account, specify that.\n\n374\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.710\nUse local system gas account.\n\n375\n00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.240\nThat's the action account,\ndata reader user,\n\n376\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.190\ndata reader password, data writer user,\ndata writer password, accept the ULA,\n\n377\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.440\nso accept the end user license agreement.\n\n378\n00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.770\nWhat's the website gonna be for\nthe web console SSL,\n\n379\n00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:39.164\nwhat's the web console authorization mode,\nmixed or network, what is the SRS\n\n380\n00:17:39.164 --> 00:17:43.800\ninstance for the reporting services,\nare we gonna send reports, yes or no.\n\n381\n00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.890\nAre we enabling our reporting?\n\n382\n00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.530\nAre we sending CEI reports?\n\n383\n00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.830\nThat's the opt in for\ncustomer experience program.\n\n384\n00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.490\nThat's what everybody says no,\nright, so you have that.\n\n385\n00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:56.473\nAnd then use Microsoft Update, and we're\ngonna use update to keep the Installation\n\n386\n00:17:56.473 --> 00:17:59.291\nup to date with all the appropriate\ndownloads for patches.\n\n387\n00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:00.545\nWe're gonna take a look at that and\n\n388\n00:18:00.545 --> 00:18:02.575\nobviously see that as we\ngo through the install.\n\n389\n00:18:02.575 --> 00:18:04.905\nBut this would be how you would\nactually automate the install.\n\n390\n00:18:04.905 --> 00:18:08.345\nIf you wanted to script it and just kick\nit off and run it as a batch process,\n\n391\n00:18:08.345 --> 00:18:10.045\nyou could actually do that as well.\n\n392\n00:18:10.045 --> 00:18:15.025\nA little ambitious certainly to try to\ndo that, but if you have the gumption,\n\n393\n00:18:15.025 --> 00:18:18.770\nas we say, to try to run through that,\nyou could actually give that a shot.\n\n394\n00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.230\nAnd would be successful provided you just\nfilled in the appropriate blanks here.\n\n395\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.630\nYou can find this script online on\nthe tech website we were taking look at as\n\n396\n00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.570\none of the steps in\nthe deployment process.\n\n397\n00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.770\nIt's got the entire automation script\nthere, you just have to copy the script\n\n398\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.080\ndown and then obviously substitute\nthe appropriate variable parameters for\n\n399\n00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.690\nyour environment and do a dry run make\nsure this is working the right way.\n\n400\n00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:43.030\nThis by the way is a great example of what\nyou would set up a test environment to do.\n\n401\n00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.850\nGet this all specced out and working,\nand then transfer that script\n\n402\n00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.710\ninto your production environment\nwhen you're gonna do this.\n\n403\n00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.210\nYou have a lot of customers that\nuse SCOM and do deployments,\n\n404\n00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:55.280\nnot many of them automate because the\nreality is, you don't tend to deploy a lot\n\n405\n00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.880\nof this infrastructure after you\nget it deployed the first time.\n\n406\n00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.370\nYou don't tend to do it a lot.\n\n407\n00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.890\nSo the only time that you see this kind\nof automation being done is if you're in\n\n408\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.380\na service provisioning model where you\nhave to deploy multiple instances for\n\n409\n00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.720\ncustomers on a regular basis.\n\n410\n00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.980\nThen it makes sense to\ntry to do the automation.\n\n411\n00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.570\nBy the time you work out all the kinks and\n\n412\n00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.860\nget it all working,\nit may be more trouble than it's worth.\n\n413\n00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.810\nBecause you could probably\njust do this directly,\n\n414\n00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.700\nas we're gonna show you in\nan upcoming demonstration, where you\n\n415\n00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.700\nactually could just click through\nthe deployment and run it that way, right?\n\n416\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.070\nSo just keep in mind, just something to be\naware of when we think about successful\n\n417\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:29.095\nmethods to confirm successful\ndeployment of a management group.\n\n418\n00:19:29.095 --> 00:19:31.155\nWe kinda see that poking out of\nthe bottom of my notes there.\n\n419\n00:19:31.155 --> 00:19:34.638\nBut we can look at different views in\nthe console, we'll take a look at some of\n\n420\n00:19:34.638 --> 00:19:38.249\nthese once we stand up our SCOM instance\nand have the OPs console up and running.\n\n421\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.850\nBut we can use several different views,\ndistributed applications view,\n\n422\n00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.460\nactive alerts view, ops manager view,\nthe management server view.\n\n423\n00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.810\nWe also have reports that could be used,\nand we could stand those up.\n\n424\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.090\nThe most common alerts report will give\nus indications of things that may or\n\n425\n00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.730\nmay not have gone well.\n\n426\n00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.550\nAnd we'll be able to take a look at that\nand have a better sense of whether or\n\n427\n00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.330\nnot we were successful as\npart of the deployment.\n\n428\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.960\nWe've gotta also think about the default\nsettings for Config Manager,\n\n429\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.370\nthe Ops Manager,\nrather that we wanna config.\n\n430\n00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.560\nData retention is gonna be important for\nus to consider.\n\n431\n00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.810\nWe're actually gonna wanna\ntake a quick look here at,\n\n432\n00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.620\nspeaking of data retention,\nit's kind of how we set these things up.\n\n433\n00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.110\nWe actually have everything we need,\nright there.\n\n434\n00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.955\nSo I put together a little chart for\n\n435\n00:20:17.955 --> 00:20:22.168\nyou on default data retention periods\nthat are gonna be specified in the tool.\n\n436\n00:20:22.168 --> 00:20:25.406\nYou'll see the magic number here is seven,\nas in seven days, right.\n\n437\n00:20:25.406 --> 00:20:29.660\nWe tend to retain most data out\nof the box by default for a week.\n\n438\n00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.710\nBut one exception that stands out there\nis the performance signature information,\n\n439\n00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.860\ntwo days there, on a rolling basis.\n\n440\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.170\nBut almost everything else is gonna\nbe at seven day intervals, rolling.\n\n441\n00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:44.090\nAnd we could modify and change that, we\nhave a PowerShell command that does that.\n\n442\n00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:48.012\nSet SCOM Database grooming setting\nis the cmdlet that we would use,\n\n443\n00:20:48.012 --> 00:20:50.580\nwith an alert days to keep parameter.\n\n444\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.320\nSet that to a value of 60 days,\n\n445\n00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.070\n90 days, whatever you can modify\nthat directly in the console shell.\n\n446\n00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.730\nBut we can go in and do that, and\nwe would then manipulate these settings.\n\n447\n00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.210\nIs there value in changing\nthese default settings?\n\n448\n00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.940\nAbsolutely, if you wanna\nkeep more of this data, but\n\n449\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.010\nyou have to understand the impact of\nkeeping data long-term on a rolling basis.\n\n450\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.330\nYou're growing the operations database,\nand you have to size and scale\n\n451\n00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.250\nthe database and plan for that, or you're\ngonna run into a performance problem.\n\n452\n00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.920\nAnd this is one of those gotch areas\nwhere a lot of people don't realize,\n\n453\n00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.060\nthey'll make changes to the default\ndata retention settings.\n\n454\n00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.990\nAnd then what happens is\nthe database starts to bloat and\n\n455\n00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.345\nthey haven't scaled the performance\naccordingly and everything slows down so\n\n456\n00:21:30.345 --> 00:21:33.235\nyou just gotta think about that and\nkeep that in mind.\n\n457\n00:21:33.235 --> 00:21:38.225\nThe other issue here is that while we can\nmodify and manipulate the ops manager\n\n458\n00:21:38.225 --> 00:21:42.905\ndatabase, and the config settings or\nmodify the configuration settings for\n\n459\n00:21:42.905 --> 00:21:46.395\nthe default data retention parameters\nthat you're seeing on the screen.\n\n460\n00:21:46.395 --> 00:21:47.355\nWe can do that.\n\n461\n00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.310\nWe could do it with the OPs\nconsole if we want to, but\n\n462\n00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.050\nwe can also do it through power shell.\n\n463\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.400\nWe can do the settings for\n\n464\n00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:00.460\nthe data warehouse database only\nthrough SQL Server Management Studio,\n\n465\n00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.710\nor with a special tool called the DW,\ndata warehouse.\n\n466\n00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:11.140\nDW data RP, DW data retention policy, the\nretention period rather, data x utility.\n\n467\n00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:17.710\nSo dwdataretention.exe is\nthe tool dwdatarp.exe, is\n\n468\n00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.620\nthe name of the tool that we use to modify\nthe data warehouse retention periods.\n\n469\n00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.990\nBecause, those are not\nexposed in the console,\n\n470\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.500\nwe have no way of getting to them.\n\n471\n00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.225\nWe could do SQL Server Management Studio,\nyou could actually go in,\n\n472\n00:22:28.225 --> 00:22:31.520\nright-click on the database,\ngo in and modify the settings.\n\n473\n00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.736\nBut it's a little bit complicated\nthere if you're not used to SQL,\n\n474\n00:22:34.736 --> 00:22:36.213\nmay be not the best way to do it.\n\n475\n00:22:36.213 --> 00:22:37.536\nI've seen people do it and screw it up,\n\n476\n00:22:37.536 --> 00:22:39.312\nbecause it's kind of\nlike registry editing.\n\n477\n00:22:39.312 --> 00:22:41.430\nYou gotta know exactly where you're\ngoing and what you're doing.\n\n478\n00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.420\nBut the executable tool itself is\nactually fairly straightforward to use,\n\n479\n00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.810\nso you might wanna use that to go in and\nmodify these settings.\n\n480\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.360\nUp to you to decide whether or not that's\ngonna be of value to you or not, but\n\n481\n00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.090\nit is something to consider.\n\n482\n00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.600\nOne of the thoughts or process, or one of\nthe kind of the streams that are out there\n\n483\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.110\non the best practice side is leave\nthose default settings alone.\n\n484\n00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.720\nTweak them as necessary as you go.\n\n485\n00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.340\nYou begin to see whether or\n\n486\n00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.100\nnot those values make sense\nbased on those reporting needs.\n\n487\n00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.655\nThe other stream of consciousness best\npractice thought process in the real world\n\n488\n00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:13.106\nis, hey, let's start out by using those.\n\n489\n00:23:13.106 --> 00:23:16.737\nBut as we soon as we start standing\nthings up, turning on management packs,\n\n490\n00:23:16.737 --> 00:23:20.539\nwe're gonna start tweaking so that we\nhave a better historical run on the data,\n\n491\n00:23:20.539 --> 00:23:21.790\nwe see more of it.\n\n492\n00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.080\nA lot of times, you'll find this runs out\nto the 30 or 60 day window where you wanna\n\n493\n00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.440\nkeep at least a month, maybe two months\nworth of data rolling through on hand.\n\n494\n00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.175\nSo you can get a better trend analysis\ngoing cuz one weeks worth of data may or\n\n495\n00:23:34.175 --> 00:23:35.155\nmay not be enough.\n\n496\n00:23:35.155 --> 00:23:37.795\nBut that's gonna be up to you to decide\nover time so you have to think about,\n\n497\n00:23:37.795 --> 00:23:40.685\nwhether or not that is the magic\nyou're looking to make happen.\n\n498\n00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:44.121\nYou got a favorite number there for\ndata retention?\n\n499\n00:23:44.121 --> 00:23:46.535\n&gt;&gt; No, [LAUGH] a week, we keep it.\n\n500\n00:23:46.535 --> 00:23:48.475\nWell it depends on the data, right, and\n\n501\n00:23:48.475 --> 00:23:51.481\ndepends on if it's long-term type data,\nshort-term type data.\n\n502\n00:23:51.481 --> 00:23:53.658\nShort-term, yeah, a week is good.\n\n503\n00:23:53.658 --> 00:23:56.762\nLong-term, usually about a year.\n\n504\n00:23:56.762 --> 00:23:58.966\n&gt;&gt; Well, okay,\nI mean it will depend on the kind of data.\n\n505\n00:23:58.966 --> 00:24:02.124\nA year may be a little excessive\nin some of these settings.\n\n506\n00:24:02.124 --> 00:24:04.471\nBecause remember,\nwe're generating real time data.\n\n507\n00:24:04.471 --> 00:24:08.149\nOn alerts, real time data on monitoring,\nand we may not wanna\n\n508\n00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:12.770\narchive that much data on a rolling basis,\nbut it's up to us again to decide.\n\n509\n00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.845\nIt will depend on several variables or\nfactors, but since Daniel has no opinion,\n\n510\n00:24:16.845 --> 00:24:17.479\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n511\n00:24:17.479 --> 00:24:18.480\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna have to go with\n\n512\n00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.350\nmy opinion,\nbecause my opinion is always right.\n\n513\n00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.300\nHis is marginally right when he has one,\nbut normally does not have one.\n\n514\n00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.400\nAt least not in this case, right?\n\n515\n00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.140\n&gt;&gt; Not in this case, no.\n\n516\n00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.168\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna say whatever you said.\n\n517\n00:24:28.168 --> 00:24:30.143\n&gt;&gt; Go with that [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so.\n\n518\n00:24:30.143 --> 00:24:31.991\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Somewhere in that 30 to 60 range,\n\n519\n00:24:31.991 --> 00:24:34.210\nmore often than not is what\nwe tend to see that set at.\n\n520\n00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.280\nSo don't be afraid to modify that,\nthat's the message, right?\n\n521\n00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.780\nYou can go in and play with that,\nbut understand that you're doing so\n\n522\n00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.410\nat the risk, not a huge risk, but\njust a risk you have to be aware of.\n\n523\n00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:44.790\nOf having to then scale and\n\n524\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.510\noptimize the database on\nthe back end on the performance.\n\n525\n00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.252\nThat would take place, hopefully, if\nyou're thinking about that upfront as part\n\n526\n00:24:51.252 --> 00:24:54.834\nof the scalability planning we engage in\nand the sizing planning we engage in for\n\n527\n00:24:54.834 --> 00:24:57.721\nthose databases to make sure\nthey're being hosted in a system,\n\n528\n00:24:57.721 --> 00:24:59.710\nwhere we can accommodate\nthat kind of data.\n\n529\n00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.064\nAnd over time, we actually\nunderstand how to manage that, so\n\n530\n00:25:02.064 --> 00:25:04.080\nthat would just be something to consider.\n\n531\n00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.800\nQuickly, I think we have\na few minutes left.\n\n532\n00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.770\nWe can quickly talk about how to\nget the agents up and running.\n\n533\n00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.100\nAnd through we've installed all the\narchitectural components, all the servers.\n\n534\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.380\nBut what we need to do, potentially,\nif we go back to the diagram for\n\n535\n00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.840\njust a second,\njust to remind ourselves of where we are.\n\n536\n00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.830\nWe need to focus on getting the agents\ndeployed into these systems down here\n\n537\n00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:23.610\nto do monitoring.\n\n538\n00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:27.520\nThe agents, remember, Microsoft Monitoring\nAgent is gonna be the piece of software\n\n539\n00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.370\nthat we install that's going to\nallow us to actually draw data\n\n540\n00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.450\nin from those systems and then feed\nthat up into the management server pool.\n\n541\n00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.740\nAnd ultimately up into the databases and\nthrough reporting and\n\n542\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.700\nthrough the console,\nmanipulate, modify, and\n\n543\n00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.710\nwork with that data to the betterment\nof our infrastructure.\n\n544\n00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.820\nSo we could do a manual agent\ninstall if we choose to.\n\n545\n00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.692\nThe idea here, we can do,\nif we are doing a manual install,\n\n546\n00:25:49.692 --> 00:25:53.255\nwe have to be prepared for the fact\nthat when we install an agent manually,\n\n547\n00:25:53.255 --> 00:25:55.420\nwe automatically reject that install.\n\n548\n00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.300\nWe don't approve it,\n\n549\n00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:01.070\nand we have to setup the review new manual\nagent install in pending management view\n\n550\n00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:05.500\noption and enable it, so we could see the\npending installs and then approve them.\n\n551\n00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.750\nEssentially in the console, we have to go\nin, and we have to enable this feature.\n\n552\n00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.600\nAnd once we do that,\nthe manually installed agents\n\n553\n00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.330\nthat are in a pending state\nbecome visible in the console.\n\n554\n00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.650\nWe then can go in, and\nwe can approve them.\n\n555\n00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.760\nAnd then we can go in and say okay,\nyep, approved, highlight it.\n\n556\n00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.130\nAnd then we can actually\nallow this to occur.\n\n557\n00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.240\nIf you're familiar with\nSystem Center Config Manager,\n\n558\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.010\nSCCM, another product in\nthe System Center Suite.\n\n559\n00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:32.970\nWe have the ability to do a manual\ninstall there of the monitoring agent,\n\n560\n00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.570\nthe SCCM agent.\n\n561\n00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:38.710\nAgain, if we did that, we would have\nto approve that manual install and\n\n562\n00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.240\nallow that installation to be allowed.\n\n563\n00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.342\nOr rather, approve that\ninstall to have it be allowed.\n\n564\n00:26:43.342 --> 00:26:45.350\nAnd we would do something similar there.\n\n565\n00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:49.060\nWe enable this globally for all the\nmanagement servers, usually by default,\n\n566\n00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.020\nthat's how we'll do it.\n\n567\n00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.290\nBut we can also do it on each individual\nmanagement server separately.\n\n568\n00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.110\nSo if we wanna enable this feature for\nall servers in the pool,\n\n569\n00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.350\nwe could do that globally.\n\n570\n00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:00.370\nWe could do it just for one server,\nbut not do it for others.\n\n571\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:04.850\nIt would really be up to us to decide how\nwe wanna use that or how we want to think\n\n572\n00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:09.204\nabout that task being used ultimately\nallow this activity to take place.\n\n573\n00:27:09.204 --> 00:27:12.909\nWe use the approved task to change\nthe status from pending to approved, so\n\n574\n00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:16.753\nthere's a highlight of the approved,\nor rather, ,the pending install.\n\n575\n00:27:16.753 --> 00:27:19.764\nWe'll highlight that, we'll go over on\nthe right hand side, choose the task,\n\n576\n00:27:19.764 --> 00:27:20.265\napprove it.\n\n577\n00:27:20.265 --> 00:27:22.287\nAnd then we'll just go ahead,\nwe'll run that, it gets done,\n\n578\n00:27:22.287 --> 00:27:24.056\nyou could actually right click and\napprove it as well.\n\n579\n00:27:24.056 --> 00:27:26.033\nYou don't have to use the task,\nbut it's up to us.\n\n580\n00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:30.299\nBut keep in mind, if we don't approve\nthe manually installed agents,\n\n581\n00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:32.460\nno communication takes place.\n\n582\n00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:36.490\nSo the agent down here is pending and will\nnot be allowed to start communicating and\n\n583\n00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.130\ntalk to the management servers and\n\n584\n00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.940\nbe managed,\nunless we actually approve that install.\n\n585\n00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.400\nSo we do wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n586\n00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.201\nWe can get some errors occurring here.\n\n587\n00:27:45.201 --> 00:27:48.502\nYou were talking about errors earlier when\nwe were talking about in the prior episode\n\n588\n00:27:48.502 --> 00:27:50.744\nwhat would happen if we didn't\nset this up a certain way.\n\n589\n00:27:50.744 --> 00:27:54.250\nAnd if we didn't authorize or\ndo whatever, would we see errors, right?\n\n590\n00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.557\nAnd the answer is yes, we're doing\nthe connected management groups,\n\n591\n00:27:56.557 --> 00:27:59.221\nif we didn't have it configured the right\nway, we would get some concerns there.\n\n592\n00:27:59.221 --> 00:28:01.929\nYou'll get an error ID of 21016,\n\n593\n00:28:01.929 --> 00:28:07.426\nevent ID 21016 is the event ID we would\nsee when we try to use agent-managed\n\n594\n00:28:07.426 --> 00:28:12.730\ncomputers that have manually installed\nagents that are not approved.\n\n595\n00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.560\nWe will get an error to that effect.\n\n596\n00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.130\nIt states something like\nOps Manager was unable to set up\n\n597\n00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.630\na communication channel to, you'll\ninsert the management server name there,\n\n598\n00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.330\nto daniel1 or\nwhatever the management server is.\n\n599\n00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.500\nAnd there are no failover hosts.\n\n600\n00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.190\nThat's roughly the language\nyou will see in the error.\n\n601\n00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.430\nAnd when that happens,\nwanna make sure we see that.\n\n602\n00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.620\nWe document that,\nwe take action accordingly.\n\n603\n00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.420\nWe have to go back,\nreverse engineer that process, and\n\n604\n00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.120\napprove the manually installed agent.\n\n605\n00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.160\nWe'll also get a log entry with\nID 20000 in the event log,\n\n606\n00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.900\nthat'll tell us that\nthat's an issue as well.\n\n607\n00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.880\nSo just keep that in mind,\n20000 and, or 21016.\n\n608\n00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.120\nTwo different event IDs, depending on what\nwe're trying to do and what we see there.\n\n609\n00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.450\nSo, there may be some errors that\nwe just wanna make sure we counter.\n\n610\n00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.200\nAnd when we do see them,\nwe're aware of them.\n\n611\n00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.750\nSo just something to think about cuz\nyou can see that happening as well.\n\n612\n00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.855\nAlso, with the automatic alert resolution,\nwhich is an option a lot of people like,\n\n613\n00:29:03.855 --> 00:29:07.676\nwe determined how many days an alert will\nset in the new resolution state remains\n\n614\n00:29:07.676 --> 00:29:09.972\nactive before it's automatically resolved.\n\n615\n00:29:09.972 --> 00:29:14.911\nSo if we are gonna use SCOM and say hey,\nfor 25 or 30 days, want that alert to stay\n\n616\n00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:19.790\nthere, keep showing up as new and then\nauto resolve over time, we can set that.\n\n617\n00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.630\nThat's, again, a variable,\nwe can modify that.\n\n618\n00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:26.530\nWe do have to manipulate that setting and\nthink about that.\n\n619\n00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:30.100\nWhat we'll do is use a,\neither in the console, set it up or\n\n620\n00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.230\nuse a PowerShell solution to do that.\n\n621\n00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:37.760\nSet SCOM alert resolution setting is\nthe commandlet that we would use there,\n\n622\n00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.380\nso set-SCOM alert resolution setting.\n\n623\n00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.850\nAlert auto resolve, days is the parameter.\n\n624\n00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.630\nSet the number to 20, 30,\n40, whatever you wanna use.\n\n625\n00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.950\nAnd then healthy alert auto resolve days\nas well, you have two options there, so\n\n626\n00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.600\nwe can change one or\nboth of those parameters.\n\n627\n00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.310\nWe could figure automatic\nalert resolutions by using\n\n628\n00:29:56.310 --> 00:30:00.680\nthe PowerShell commandlets built into the\nmonitoring console, so think about that.\n\n629\n00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.000\nAgain, these are nips and tucks,\n\n630\n00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.210\ntweaks that we would tend to engage in\nthat will help us to better understand\n\n631\n00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:09.680\nhow to configure the system to\nget it working the way we want.\n\n632\n00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.382\nRemember, out of the box, a lot of these\ndefaults may be either too aggressive or\n\n633\n00:30:13.382 --> 00:30:15.137\nnot aggressive enough for our needs.\n\n634\n00:30:15.137 --> 00:30:19.448\nWe're just using middle of the road\nkind of median thought processes here.\n\n635\n00:30:19.448 --> 00:30:22.951\nWhat we wanna do is figure out how once\nwe get it out of the box, get it up and\n\n636\n00:30:22.951 --> 00:30:26.468\nrunning, what the best advantage will\nbe for us in terms of fine tuning.\n\n637\n00:30:26.468 --> 00:30:29.776\nAnd this is where a lot of the time is\nspent with the SCOM install, nipping and\n\n638\n00:30:29.776 --> 00:30:32.510\ntucking and\nmanipulating these individual settings.\n\n639\n00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.620\nWe have active alerts that\nare in this resolution state\n\n640\n00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.545\njust sitting there that we can modify.\n\n641\n00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:42.080\nWe also wanna make sure that when\nan alert source has remained healthy for\n\n642\n00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.180\na certain numbers of days,\nthat we then flip that alert as well.\n\n643\n00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.010\nThose are those two\nsettings I'm talking about.\n\n644\n00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.680\nThe remained healthy for a certain\nnumber of days is one setting, and\n\n645\n00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.890\nthe initial alert status\nitself is another.\n\n646\n00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.900\nAnd we could flip one or both of those\nusing the PowerShell commandlet.\n\n647\n00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.630\nSo keep that in mind,\nalert auto resolve days and,\n\n648\n00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:00.950\nor healthy alert auto resolve days.\n\n649\n00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.030\nFlip one or\nboth of those around as needed.\n\n650\n00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.030\nRemember, the default may be too low for\n\n651\n00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.400\nus, we may wanna extend\nthat out a little bit.\n\n652\n00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:11.490\nSo just maybe something for\nus to think about and consider as well.\n\n653\n00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.956\nAll right, I think that's a good amount.\n\n654\n00:31:12.956 --> 00:31:14.323\n&gt;&gt; Good stuff thus far, yeah.\n\n655\n00:31:14.323 --> 00:31:16.697\n&gt;&gt; Because we wanna jump in and\ndo the demo, which we'll do coming up.\n\n656\n00:31:16.697 --> 00:31:17.257\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n657\n00:31:17.257 --> 00:31:20.660\n&gt;&gt; That's probably a lot\nof stuff at one sitting for\n\n658\n00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:25.235\neverybody to keep in mind, so\nmaybe a good stopping point for us.\n\n659\n00:31:25.235 --> 00:31:26.678\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\ndrinking from a firehose,\n\n660\n00:31:26.678 --> 00:31:27.867\nthat's what we do here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n661\n00:31:27.867 --> 00:31:31.540\n[LAUGH] We'll put it on full blast and\nsay drink up, me hearties.\n\n662\n00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:35.332\nThat being said, like Adam said, we're\ngonna do some demonstration stuff, so\n\n663\n00:31:35.332 --> 00:31:38.251\nwe definitely have more ahead of us,\nso tune back in for that.\n\n664\n00:31:38.251 --> 00:31:41.630\nAs for this episode though,\nwe are gonna go ahead and call it a day.\n\n665\n00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:45.050\nThanks for watching, signing off for\nITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n666\n00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:46.150\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n667\n00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.420\n&gt;&gt; I am, who am I,\nwhat am I, I don't know.\n\n668\n00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:53.327\nI am a management server in a resource\npool, but I am not well connected, so\n\n669\n00:31:53.327 --> 00:31:55.830\nI'm using the gateway\nserver to talk to you.\n\n670\n00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.440\nFigure that one out.\n\n671\n00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.384\nOtherwise known as Adam.\n\n672\n00:31:59.384 --> 00:32:00.490\nTalk to you guys later.\n\n673\n00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.430\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n674\n00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.498\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\nOkay, that's what we were waiting for.\n\n675\n00:32:05.498 --> 00:32:11.493\n[MUSIC]\n\n676\n00:32:11.493 --> 00:32:14.756\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.379\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.689\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.560\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.398\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:20.883\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are back with more of\n\n8\n00:00:20.883 --> 00:00:25.522\nour data center monitoring with Microsoft\nSystem Center Operations Manager.\n\n9\n00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:28.545\nAnd joining me in the studio again,\nour mentor,\n\n10\n00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:31.590\nour leader in this endeavor,\nMr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.460\nAdam, welcome back, man.\n\n12\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.075\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:33.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good.\n\n14\n00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.890\nGood.\nThank you.\n\n15\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.971\nI don't think I can bear all\nthat weight on my shoulders.\n\n16\n00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:37.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n17\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.160\nwe're just gonna go with it's me,\nand we're gonna continue talking.\n\n18\n00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.900\nBut I do appreciate that very,\nvery kind introduction.\n\n19\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.380\nSo we are gonna continue.\n\n20\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.450\nThis is part three, as in you would have\nseen, hopefully by now, parts one and two.\n\n21\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.060\nAnd if you have not, gonna encourage you\nto go back take a look at those episodes.\n\n22\n00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.290\nReally important in this case, as it\nis in many cases, but especially here.\n\n23\n00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.150\nWe laid down a lot of foundational\nknowledge for you about how to set up and\n\n24\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.040\nthe thought processes\naround how to install and\n\n25\n00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.170\nconfigure SCOM,\nwhat's the prioritized order for that.\n\n26\n00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.940\nOnce we stand it up, what are we\ngonna have to do to jump in and\n\n27\n00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.160\nstart configuration on some of the areas\nthat are gonna be important to us\n\n28\n00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.350\nright out of the box.\n\n29\n00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.580\nWe talked a bit about that.\n\n30\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.680\nWe're gonna pick up that thread,\ncontinue running with it.\n\n31\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.120\nWanna talk about deployment\nmethods a little bit around\n\n32\n00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.460\nthe Microsoft Monitoring Agent,\n\n33\n00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.510\nwhich you would commonly think of as\nthe SCOM agent from days gone by.\n\n34\n00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.160\nWe're gonna take a look at how to do that,\n\n35\n00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.310\ntalk a little bit about\nthat along the way.\n\n36\n00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.570\nTake a look at the difference\nbetween console push and\n\n37\n00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.290\nthe manual install method.\n\n38\n00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.530\nShow you how to deal with those things and\nwhat you may or may not know about them.\n\n39\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.365\nWe'll do a quick demo of a console push,\nshow you how that's done.\n\n40\n00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:41.840\nAnd talk to you about some of the do's and\ndon'ts along the way.\n\n41\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.965\nIn addition we gonna take a look at\nhow to configure and work with another\n\n42\n00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:50.435\ninteresting area of the SCOM console that\nwill allows us to use group policy to\n\n43\n00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:55.420\napply some settings, that will then allow\nus to control how agents are gonna behave.\n\n44\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.320\nSo that will be interesting\nas well hopefully for you.\n\n45\n00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.080\nSo, let's go in, let's take a look\nwhile we're talking, if we could.\n\n46\n00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.430\nWe're in our SCOM console, so\nyou could see that sitting up here.\n\n47\n00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.270\nAnd I've just gone into the area where\nwe are in the administration workspace.\n\n48\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.020\nWe gave you a quick tour of this\nin our episode where we did\n\n49\n00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.290\nthe install of the SCOM, and the install\nof SCOM and configuration on the box.\n\n50\n00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.523\nSo we walk through the different\nworkspaces, pointed a few things here and\n\n51\n00:02:18.523 --> 00:02:20.485\nthere, we're gonna go a little deeper now.\n\n52\n00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:23.647\nWe're in the admin workspace, what we are,\nor where we are I should say,\n\n53\n00:02:23.647 --> 00:02:25.280\nis on the management server's area.\n\n54\n00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.540\nI just wanted to point\nout before we jump in and\n\n55\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.150\ngo down here to our network management and\ndiscovery area, where we'll do discovery.\n\n56\n00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.289\nBut we had talked as part of the install.\n\n57\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.830\nAnd part of the issues\nassociated with compatibility\n\n58\n00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.690\naround having a mixed environment with\nSCOM, when we're doing the install.\n\n59\n00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.460\nIf we have 2007 infrastructure that we're\ninstalling against, we would have the RMS,\n\n60\n00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.850\nthe root management server.\n\n61\n00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.800\nA role, and we need the RMS emulator for\nbackwards compatibility for\n\n62\n00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.650\nour management packs.\n\n63\n00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.430\nWe mentioned this in one\nof the prior episodes.\n\n64\n00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.470\nAnd we can see, as I taught you about\nthe fact that once we install SCOM,\n\n65\n00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.165\nthe first management server installed\nin the 2012 R2 management group,\n\n66\n00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.445\nis gonna get that RMS emulator rolling.\n\n67\n00:03:06.445 --> 00:03:10.105\nYou can see in the column view up there,\noff to the right, where we see and\n\n68\n00:03:10.105 --> 00:03:12.365\nwe're looking at the management server,\nand\n\n69\n00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:15.855\nwe see the name of our management server,\nand the fact that it is installed.\n\n70\n00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:19.045\nWe can see here that it does\nhold the RMS emulator role.\n\n71\n00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:22.075\nSo we're seeing that and\njust identifying that that's the case.\n\n72\n00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:24.065\nJust wanted to point that\nout to you real quick.\n\n73\n00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:26.170\nLet's go in here down\nto network management.\n\n74\n00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.530\nWe're just gonna take a look\nat the overview screen.\n\n75\n00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.910\nWe have these overview\nscreens in all these areas.\n\n76\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.840\nWe can execute activities\nright from the screen, or\n\n77\n00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.978\nwe could decide to delve in and\ngo in and do the activity directly.\n\n78\n00:03:36.978 --> 00:03:42.030\nWe can right-click, and we can either run\nthe discovery wizard right from here.\n\n79\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.280\nOr we can do required\nconfigure computers and\n\n80\n00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.520\ndevices to manage the link right\nhere off the working page.\n\n81\n00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.940\nEither one will essentially\ntake us through the same place.\n\n82\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.446\nWhat I'm gonna show you now is\nrunning the Discovery Wizard and\n\n83\n00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:58.019\nusing the Discovery Wizard to then\nconfigure the console push so\n\n84\n00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.878\nwe can install the agent on to one or\nmore machines.\n\n85\n00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:04.158\nWe're gonna take a look at how to do that,\nin case you haven't done this before,\n\n86\n00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:05.620\nwe'll take a look at how to do that.\n\n87\n00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.610\nAnd as a little added bonus,\nI'm gonna show you the equivalent\n\n88\n00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.260\nactivity in PowerShell when we're done\nusing the office manager shell and\n\n89\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.320\nthe code associated with\ndoing that install,\n\n90\n00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.470\nwith a few variables that you'll\nmodify based on your own environment.\n\n91\n00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.950\nSo, we'll take a look at that also.\n\n92\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.990\nSo, I'm gonna run\nthe Discovery Wizard here.\n\n93\n00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.645\nOther discovery wizard allows us to go\nin and to discover, quote, unquote,\n\n94\n00:04:25.645 --> 00:04:30.029\nto find through a network investigation,\ndifferent kinds of systems.\n\n95\n00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:35.368\nYou see windows computer's category,\nUnix, Linux's category, network devices.\n\n96\n00:04:35.368 --> 00:04:36.260\nSo we're gonna be able to go out and\n\n97\n00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.100\ndiscover any of the three categorical\nareas that SCOM can be used to manage.\n\n98\n00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.860\nAnd we've talked about\ncross platform support, and\n\n99\n00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.350\nnetwork device support as well.\n\n100\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.050\nWe'll use SNMP discovery to be able\nto go out, and do network device.\n\n101\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.680\nDiscovery SNMP version 1,2, or 3,\nwill be using a directory based discovery.\n\n102\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.230\nSo LDAP discovery to be able to go out and\n\n103\n00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.970\nfind Windows computers,\nif they're in the Active Directory.\n\n104\n00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.030\nSo that's what we're\ngoing to do right now.\n\n105\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.710\nSo, let's click here, we'll do our Windows\ndiscovery, highlight that, click Next.\n\n106\n00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.560\nWe have automatic computer discovery,\nor we can do advanced discovery, and\n\n107\n00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.420\nwe can specify.\n\n108\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.010\nAnd you'll see on the pull-down\nhere different classes.\n\n109\n00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.595\nWe can do servers and clients,\nservers only clients only, and\n\n110\n00:05:14.595 --> 00:05:18.275\nwe can specify the management server\nof record that we're gonna use.\n\n111\n00:05:18.275 --> 00:05:20.475\nI'm just gonna do automatic\ncomputer discovery,\n\n112\n00:05:20.475 --> 00:05:23.415\nthis will search the entire\npractice labs domain, or\n\n113\n00:05:23.415 --> 00:05:26.355\nwhatever the domain is,\nin our case called practice labs.\n\n114\n00:05:26.355 --> 00:05:30.940\nAnd allow us based on be able to do\nthat search and figure out what's there.\n\n115\n00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.110\nGet a listing of all the target machines\nthat we may want to install the agent on.\n\n116\n00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.670\nAnd then obviously choose whether or\nnot we're gonna manage those.\n\n117\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.490\nSo we'll do our automatic\ncomputer discovery.\n\n118\n00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.810\nWe'll click Next, give that just a second.\n\n119\n00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.470\nAll we have to specify what kind\nof an account we're gonna use, or\n\n120\n00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.200\nare we gonna use a specific\naccount provide the credential, or\n\n121\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.170\nare we gonna use the, as we could\nsee here server action account.\n\n122\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.510\nThe management server action account.\n\n123\n00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.080\nWe'll use that.\n\n124\n00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.940\nWe've talked about\nthe different account types.\n\n125\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.820\nYou saw me during the episode where we did\nthe install of SCOM and walked through\n\n126\n00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.360\nthat provision out these accounts,\ntalk about the different account types.\n\n127\n00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.380\nThere are four account types we\nwould use for the install and\n\n128\n00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.400\nconfiguration of SCOM, and the management\nserver action account is one of them.\n\n129\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.092\nSo we're gonna use that account,\nwe're gonna go ahead and click Discover.\n\n130\n00:06:14.092 --> 00:06:18.150\nThis will require two clicks because\nI didn't click the first time.\n\n131\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.355\nSo we gotta get a new mouse for\nthis machine.\n\n132\n00:06:20.355 --> 00:06:22.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like every time I'm clicking but\n\n133\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.690\nnothing's happening.\n\n134\n00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.260\nAll right so,\nwe're waiting on that to happen.\n\n135\n00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.400\nIt doesn't take too long,\nit takes a moment or two.\n\n136\n00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.120\nNow in the real world, understand,\n\n137\n00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.940\nthat if this is a large infrastructure\nthat you're scanning, a very large LAN or\n\n138\n00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.540\nWAN, and there's tens, hundreds, thousands\nof machines that have to be discovered.\n\n139\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.470\nYou may wanna get up and go get a cup\nof coffee cuz this could take awhile.\n\n140\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.880\nWe've only got a couple of machines, so\nwe've gotta come back here fairly quick.\n\n141\n00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.660\nBut do keep in mind that in the real\nworld, outside of a demo environment,\n\n142\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.560\nthis is gonna take some time\nbefore you get back a list.\n\n143\n00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.260\nDon't be concerned about that and\n\n144\n00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.940\ndon't worry about the fact that it looks\nlike it's taking a very long time.\n\n145\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.520\nBecause the reality is it is,\nbut it's because of the fact\n\n146\n00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.060\nthat we are scanning and\nfinding all those different machines.\n\n147\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.020\nWe could see here we find too,\nwe have our domain controller, and\n\n148\n00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.540\nwe have our VMM,\nour Virtual Machine Manager server.\n\n149\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.460\nWe've installed that in one\nof the prior episodes and\n\n150\n00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.620\nshowed you how to stand up SCVMM.\n\n151\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.800\nSo we have those,\nwe could do a Select All.\n\n152\n00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.250\nAnd we'll just choose both.\n\n153\n00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.720\nAnd we're then going to use our\nmanagement server down here,\n\n154\n00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.620\nthe one of record,\nto be able to drive the install.\n\n155\n00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.511\nAnd then when we do that,\nwe get on our summary screen.\n\n156\n00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:32.054\nA little misleading, cuz Microsoft\ndoesn't label the summary screen\n\n157\n00:07:32.054 --> 00:07:34.365\nas whether I should say\nis label it as summary.\n\n158\n00:07:34.365 --> 00:07:38.000\nBut what we're doing here what they really\nshould label it as is the configuration\n\n159\n00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.440\nscreen for the agent installation and\nthen have a summary screen after that.\n\n160\n00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.815\nCuz that's what we're actually doing here.\n\n161\n00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:46.145\nWe're specifying where we're\ngonna install the agent,\n\n162\n00:07:46.145 --> 00:07:48.385\nwhat directory we're\ngonna install it into.\n\n163\n00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.325\nIf we can go full screen for\njust a second, so you can see this,\n\n164\n00:07:50.325 --> 00:07:51.137\nit's a little bit easier.\n\n165\n00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.005\nI'm gonna deselect here so\nit's easier to see.\n\n166\n00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:58.454\n%ProgramFiles% so, system variable forever\nprogram files is based on the install.\n\n167\n00:07:58.454 --> 00:08:00.844\nThen Microsoft, then Monitoring Agent.\n\n168\n00:08:00.844 --> 00:08:04.520\nSo this is where we're gonna go to\nactually see that when it's installed.\n\n169\n00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.126\nNow what we're gonna see ultimately\nis we'll go to Control Panel once\n\n170\n00:08:08.126 --> 00:08:11.622\nthis is done and we'll have\nthe Monitoring Agent icon there there.\n\n171\n00:08:11.622 --> 00:08:13.565\nIt'll be instantiated after\na couple of minutes and\n\n172\n00:08:13.565 --> 00:08:16.050\nthen we're actually able to\ninteract with the Monitoring Agent.\n\n173\n00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.120\nAre we then gonna specify credentials?\n\n174\n00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.119\nWe obviously have to.\n\n175\n00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:22.872\nAre we gonna do this using local system or\nanother credential, domain based?\n\n176\n00:08:22.872 --> 00:08:27.039\nIt'll be up to us, so we'll go ahead and\nwe'll specify that, click Finish,\n\n177\n00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:28.282\nlet that kick off.\n\n178\n00:08:28.282 --> 00:08:32.058\nWe have our Task Status window that\ncomes up, starts to show the task,\n\n179\n00:08:32.058 --> 00:08:33.981\nyou could see it's running there.\n\n180\n00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:37.041\nJust make this full screen a little\nbit easier for you to see, and\n\n181\n00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:39.433\nyou can see we have a task for\neach of the machines.\n\n182\n00:08:39.433 --> 00:08:42.537\nIt is running, it has started,\nnow we could close this window and\n\n183\n00:08:42.537 --> 00:08:46.389\njust pick up the task status by going into\nthe Task Status view and checking on it.\n\n184\n00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:48.610\nWe don't have to leave this open.\n\n185\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.120\nBut if we wanna see it run,\nwe could see it run.\n\n186\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.380\nAnd we could open each one,\njust kinda pull this down here.\n\n187\n00:08:57.531 --> 00:09:00.825\nAnd if we could get it to do its thing\nwe'll be able to see some information\n\n188\n00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:03.096\nabout it,\nit's just not registering the click.\n\n189\n00:09:03.096 --> 00:09:05.747\nBut we would actually be able to\nsee information about each one as\n\n190\n00:09:05.747 --> 00:09:06.443\nit's running.\n\n191\n00:09:06.443 --> 00:09:10.474\nUltimately when this does finish, we will\nthen get a success or failure depending on\n\n192\n00:09:10.474 --> 00:09:13.445\nwhether or not we were able to\nreach both boxes successfully.\n\n193\n00:09:13.445 --> 00:09:15.851\nInstantiate the agent,\nwe should be able to, but\n\n194\n00:09:15.851 --> 00:09:18.157\nif there's a problem it'll pop up and\ntell us.\n\n195\n00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:21.346\nSo we'll just minimize,\nkind of make this small again, and\n\n196\n00:09:21.346 --> 00:09:23.847\nthen just minimize this down for a minute.\n\n197\n00:09:23.847 --> 00:09:28.683\nWe'll let that run, what we're\ngoing to do while that's running\n\n198\n00:09:28.683 --> 00:09:31.263\nis just through the magic\nof our console here.\n\n199\n00:09:31.263 --> 00:09:33.923\nWe just gonna click over here,\njust reset our lab timer.\n\n200\n00:09:33.923 --> 00:09:36.513\nAnd then what I'm wanna do is\nI'm gonna come over here and\n\n201\n00:09:36.513 --> 00:09:38.633\nI'm gonna go to the VMM box.\n\n202\n00:09:39.663 --> 00:09:42.920\nGo here to our VMM box real quick and\nconnect back in.\n\n203\n00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.060\nJust lost my console for one second.\n\n204\n00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.800\nSo let me just go back and\nreconnect to that box.\n\n205\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.559\nJust open up a new console\nwindow real quick.\n\n206\n00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:55.340\nAll right, sign back in there,\nwe'll just do that right now.\n\n207\n00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.520\nAnd let's just make that full screen, and\n\n208\n00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.170\nlet's just take a look at\nwhat's going on with this one.\n\n209\n00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.350\nSo let's go in here,\nlet's go to Control Panel.\n\n210\n00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.350\nAnd let's see if we could see\nwhether the Monitoring Agent has\n\n211\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.740\nalready been stood up in there or not.\n\n212\n00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.987\nSo we're just gonna take a peak and\n\n213\n00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:11.886\nsee real quick while we're\nwaiting on it to finish.\n\n214\n00:10:11.886 --> 00:10:16.604\nGo here, you'll see the Monitoring Agent\nis already installed, it's starting to be\n\n215\n00:10:16.604 --> 00:10:20.238\nconfigured, so we could see that\nthat's happening in real time.\n\n216\n00:10:20.238 --> 00:10:22.607\nLet's just kinda scroll down here so\nyou could see that.\n\n217\n00:10:22.607 --> 00:10:24.341\nThat's what the Monitoring Agent\nlooks like.\n\n218\n00:10:24.341 --> 00:10:26.662\nIf you haven't seen it before\nyou may not be used to it or\n\n219\n00:10:26.662 --> 00:10:28.941\nyou may have seen the older\nversion of the SCOM agent.\n\n220\n00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:31.947\nRemember we renamed that in SCOM 12 R2,\nour 2012 R2.\n\n221\n00:10:31.947 --> 00:10:35.004\nMicrosoft.Monitoring Agent\nis now the new name for it,\n\n222\n00:10:35.004 --> 00:10:38.199\nso if you haven't seen it before\nthis is what it looks like.\n\n223\n00:10:38.199 --> 00:10:41.127\nWe can open that up and\nwe can see the properties of it.\n\n224\n00:10:41.127 --> 00:10:43.444\nWe're not gonna spend a lot\nof time on this right now,\n\n225\n00:10:43.444 --> 00:10:46.960\nbut you can see we do have the management\ngroup that we're associated with here.\n\n226\n00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.679\nPort 5723, so how we're communicating,\nour assignment is manual,\n\n227\n00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:52.693\nwhich means that's pending right now.\n\n228\n00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:55.201\nWe have to go in and approve that,\nwe'll take a look at that and\n\n229\n00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:56.960\nsee how that has to\nhappen here in a minute.\n\n230\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.010\nAnd we have Properties, and\nwe could see what's going on with that,\n\n231\n00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.110\nour build number, etc.\n\n232\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.351\nSo we can see that that's\nalready been instantiated.\n\n233\n00:11:03.351 --> 00:11:06.578\nLet's just come down here,\nlet's just make sure that's up for\n\n234\n00:11:06.578 --> 00:11:07.901\nour right amount of time.\n\n235\n00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:10.113\nLet's come back over here and\n\n236\n00:11:10.113 --> 00:11:14.895\nbecause this is going to be a manual\npush and or pending install.\n\n237\n00:11:14.895 --> 00:11:16.920\nIf it was manual we're doing for\nthe console push,\n\n238\n00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.343\nit's not gonna wind up in pending.\n\n239\n00:11:18.343 --> 00:11:22.608\nBut if it was a manual install and we had\na pending as we had talked about in one of\n\n240\n00:11:22.608 --> 00:11:25.020\nthe prior episodes we would see it here.\n\n241\n00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.360\nYou notice we could in theory just\nhighlight the machine, click Approve, and\n\n242\n00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.080\nwe would then allow that manual install\nto go forward and be instantiated.\n\n243\n00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.472\nBut if it is successful,\nunder Agent Management,\n\n244\n00:11:34.472 --> 00:11:36.711\nonce it does finally show\nup we will see it here.\n\n245\n00:11:36.711 --> 00:11:39.749\nAnd we'll see those machines\npop in in the next few minutes.\n\n246\n00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:43.912\nOnce the task is finalized and everything\nis set up, we'll see them pop in under\n\n247\n00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:47.531\nAgent Managed and we'll be able to\nsee that finish up successfully.\n\n248\n00:11:47.531 --> 00:11:49.359\nLet's just go back,\nthere they are right there,\n\n249\n00:11:49.359 --> 00:11:50.978\nit just takes a moment\ntypically to show up.\n\n250\n00:11:50.978 --> 00:11:54.176\nYou could see them there,\njust gonna go to out job and see.\n\n251\n00:11:54.176 --> 00:11:57.097\nLooks like the task did complete\nsuccessfully, so we're done there.\n\n252\n00:11:57.097 --> 00:12:00.398\nClose that, that will take a few\nminutes to start spinning up,\n\n253\n00:12:00.398 --> 00:12:01.656\ndoing the monitoring.\n\n254\n00:12:01.656 --> 00:12:05.970\nAnd you're kicking off everything we want\nit to do, but you could see that we're\n\n255\n00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.090\nable to do a console push and\ninstall that with no trouble.\n\n256\n00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.980\nNow there may be a couple of\nthings that can derail us here,\n\n257\n00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.140\none of them may be permissions, you saw\nhow to choose the appropriate account.\n\n258\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.081\nIf we didn't have the right account,\neither to do the discovery or\n\n259\n00:12:18.081 --> 00:12:20.300\nto do the install,\nwe'd run into an issue there.\n\n260\n00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.632\nHave a permission problem,\nwe'd see that in the log and or\n\n261\n00:12:23.632 --> 00:12:26.901\nin the information in\nthe Task Status as we were looking.\n\n262\n00:12:26.901 --> 00:12:28.974\nSo you wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n263\n00:12:28.974 --> 00:12:34.604\nThe error code that we would get there,\nwould be 8007 0, 0, 0, 5.\n\n264\n00:12:34.604 --> 00:12:38.507\nSo 800, 8, 0, 0, followed by a 7,\n\n265\n00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:43.687\nfollowed by three 0's, 0,\n0, 0, followed by a 5.\n\n266\n00:12:43.687 --> 00:12:46.706\nSay that really quickly 807,005.\n\n267\n00:12:46.706 --> 00:12:48.923\n&gt;&gt; You should come up with a jingle for\nthat, like Empire, right.\n\n268\n00:12:48.923 --> 00:12:51.076\n[SOUND] 2, 300.\n\n269\n00:12:51.076 --> 00:12:52.695\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could do that, thanks,\n\n270\n00:12:52.695 --> 00:12:53.649\nthat's gonna be in my head forever now.\n\n271\n00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:54.304\n&gt;&gt; You'll never forget it.\n\n272\n00:12:54.304 --> 00:12:56.640\n&gt;&gt; No, I will never forget that.\n\n273\n00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.057\nThank you sir, I appreciate that.\n\n274\n00:12:58.057 --> 00:12:59.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n275\n00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.613\n&gt;&gt; Now I've got that in my head,\nI can't think of anything else.\n\n276\n00:13:01.613 --> 00:13:03.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if we do get an error that will pop\n\n277\n00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:05.569\nup on the screen, you've seen these errors\nbefore, you know what they look like.\n\n278\n00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:09.710\nBut that particular error number is\nspecific to a permission issue associated\n\n279\n00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.354\nwith the installation, so\njust be aware of that.\n\n280\n00:13:12.354 --> 00:13:17.016\nI did promise you that we would take\na look at how to do the install equivalent\n\n281\n00:13:17.016 --> 00:13:21.630\nof that push through System Center,\nOps Manager shell with PowerShell.\n\n282\n00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.950\nSo let's just go in and take a look at\nthat, I've got that teed up for us.\n\n283\n00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.961\nWhat I've got is I've got\nPowerShell set up here and\n\n284\n00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:31.189\nI've got the Opts Manager shell,\nit should say set up.\n\n285\n00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:35.665\nAnd I've got the PowerShell script\nthat we need to take a look at here.\n\n286\n00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:40.225\nWhat I forgot to do was just simply\ndo a little font uptick here to make\n\n287\n00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:43.750\na little easier to see, so\nlet me do that real quick.\n\n288\n00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.964\nMake that a little bit easier for\nus to see.\n\n289\n00:13:47.964 --> 00:13:52.366\nLet me maybe just move that out a wee\nbit so we could see the end of that.\n\n290\n00:13:52.366 --> 00:13:55.339\n&gt;&gt; Really quickly Adam,\nwhy would we be using PowerShell?\n\n291\n00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:57.840\nObviously, it's a great way to do it,\nthere's nothing wrong with it.\n\n292\n00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.700\nI'm just wondering,\n\n293\n00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.410\nwe've got the console itself that\nwould be able to push the agent out.\n\n294\n00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.913\nWhat would make us want to choose\nusing PowerShell versus the console?\n\n295\n00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:08.437\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we wanna be cooler\nthan everybody else.\n\n296\n00:14:08.437 --> 00:14:09.334\n&gt;&gt; That is a valid answer, sir.\n\n297\n00:14:09.334 --> 00:14:11.660\n&gt;&gt; We're just a bad ass IT [INAUDIBLE]-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n298\n00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.683\n&gt;&gt; And we wanna prove it to the world.\n\n299\n00:14:12.683 --> 00:14:13.261\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, darn right.\n\n300\n00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:14.437\n&gt;&gt; That's what that is.\n\n301\n00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:15.749\nWho was that annoying character?\n\n302\n00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:18.421\nWe were talking about\nSaturday Night Live offline, right.\n\n303\n00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:20.468\nDuring the break between\none of the episodes, and\n\n304\n00:14:20.468 --> 00:14:22.574\nI admitted that I had not\nbeen keeping up with them.\n\n305\n00:14:22.574 --> 00:14:25.251\nBut there was the annoying IT character,\nremember that?\n\n306\n00:14:25.251 --> 00:14:26.602\n&gt;&gt; Nick Burns.\n&gt;&gt; Nick Burns, there you go.\n\n307\n00:14:26.602 --> 00:14:27.686\nSo you wanna be like Nick Burns and\n\n308\n00:14:27.686 --> 00:14:29.680\njust prove to the world you're\nbetter than everybody else.\n\n309\n00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.349\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n310\n00:14:30.349 --> 00:14:33.227\nwho uses this lame console when you\ncan always type it into PowerShell?\n\n311\n00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:33.892\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n312\n00:14:33.892 --> 00:14:34.704\n&gt;&gt; And get it wrong six times.\n\n313\n00:14:34.704 --> 00:14:35.360\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n314\n00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.796\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what it is, so\n\n315\n00:14:36.796 --> 00:14:38.082\nthat's what we're going for.\n\n316\n00:14:38.082 --> 00:14:38.660\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n317\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.747\n&gt;&gt; So if you wanna be like Nick,\nthen this is what you wanna do.\n\n318\n00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:44.226\nSo, I thought I'd just show you quickly\nwhat the PowerShell equivalent of doing\n\n319\n00:14:44.226 --> 00:14:45.872\nclient push install would look like.\n\n320\n00:14:45.872 --> 00:14:49.204\nNow a couple of things with PowerShell\nhere we just wanna take note of while\n\n321\n00:14:49.204 --> 00:14:50.020\nwe're talking.\n\n322\n00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.960\nI'm gonna drag with down just a wee bit\nhere, kinda center it in the screen so\n\n323\n00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.180\nwe could talk through it.\n\n324\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.300\nWe've done something here that you may or\n\n325\n00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.523\nmay not be familiar with\nwith in PowerShell.\n\n326\n00:14:57.523 --> 00:15:02.180\nWe've declared a variable and\nwe're using the value of that variable and\n\n327\n00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.163\nthen calling.\n\n328\n00:15:03.163 --> 00:15:05.718\nWe're actually declaring three, two\ndifferent variables in the string here.\n\n329\n00:15:05.718 --> 00:15:08.980\nOne is the InstallAccount, so\nwe're declaring that with a dollar sign,\n\n330\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.360\nsetting that equal to\nthe command Get-Credential.\n\n331\n00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.159\nSo when we call the InstallAccount\nvariable down here at the end of\n\n332\n00:15:15.159 --> 00:15:18.908\nthe string, we're actually\nsubstituting Get-Credential.\n\n333\n00:15:18.908 --> 00:15:23.755\nAnd the ActionAccount will then pull\nthe Get-Credential information that was\n\n334\n00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:27.733\nqueried or initially set up when\nwe actually run Get-Credential\n\n335\n00:15:27.733 --> 00:15:30.281\nas part of setting the variable up above.\n\n336\n00:15:30.281 --> 00:15:33.850\nSo that's gonna allow us to insert\nthe credential without having to use\n\n337\n00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:34.989\nthe cmdlet directly.\n\n338\n00:15:34.989 --> 00:15:40.300\nThis is a standard way when we work with\nPowerShell or with any scripting language.\n\n339\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.906\nThat we are gonna be able to insert and\nuse the information we wanna call.\n\n340\n00:15:44.906 --> 00:15:48.464\nBut have a variable place holder for\nit so we're not hard coding things like\n\n341\n00:15:48.464 --> 00:15:50.850\ncredentials so\nthey don't show up in the script.\n\n342\n00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.848\nFrom a security standpoint,\nobviously very bad to do that.\n\n343\n00:15:53.848 --> 00:15:58.640\nFrom a repeat-use perspective,\nwhat if we change that credential?\n\n344\n00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.964\nThen we'd have to go in and\nmodify the script or it's not gonna work.\n\n345\n00:16:00.964 --> 00:16:04.485\nThis way all we have to do is just to\ncontinue to feed whatever comes from\n\n346\n00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:08.483\nGet-Credential, When we run it at the time\nthat we run the script and we'll get\n\n347\n00:16:08.483 --> 00:16:12.500\nthe most updated credential and we don't\nhave to worry about any of that stuff.\n\n348\n00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.370\nSo that's why we do that this way and\njust wanted to let you know that and\n\n349\n00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.480\nhave you see that.\n\n350\n00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.606\nWe have primary management server.\n\n351\n00:16:17.606 --> 00:16:22.366\nThat's gonna be set equal to Getscom\nManagement server with parameter computer\n\n352\n00:16:22.366 --> 00:16:23.140\nname set to.\n\n353\n00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.720\nAnd you can see I just\ninserted a variable here.\n\n354\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.860\nYou would make this whatever\nthe machine name is.\n\n355\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.650\nFor the computer that's a scum\nmanagement server in your network.\n\n356\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:36.120\nI call mine adam-ms3.itpro.tv, you would\ncall it whatever you have for your fully\n\n357\n00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.620\nqualified domain name in your domain for\nthat particular management server, right.\n\n358\n00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.800\nSo you'd set that up.\n\n359\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.120\nWe then have install SCOMAgent,\nthat is the command that we would use\n\n360\n00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.590\nwith a DNS host name parameter,\nspecify what the value is for\n\n361\n00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:52.290\nthat, ADAM01.ITPro.TV would be\nmy DNS host name in this case.\n\n362\n00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:56.130\nAgain, you would use the DNS server in\nyour environment to substitute there.\n\n363\n00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:01.670\nPrimaryManagementServer and then that's\ngonna be the flag that we need or\n\n364\n00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.070\nthe item that we need to specify that.\n\n365\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:05.710\nWhat's the PrimaryManagementServer?\n\n366\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.740\nThat ActionAccount is gonna use\nthe InstallAccount get-Credential\n\n367\n00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.455\nvariable that we specify, so\nif we use these four lines.\n\n368\n00:17:11.455 --> 00:17:15.215\nYou would type these as four\nindividual lines of code, by the way.\n\n369\n00:17:15.215 --> 00:17:17.885\nOr actually three individual lines,\nbecause it's number 1.\n\n370\n00:17:17.885 --> 00:17:20.695\nWhat I probably should've done was\nput a little line number here.\n\n371\n00:17:20.695 --> 00:17:22.375\nSo that would be line number 1.\n\n372\n00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:25.045\nThis would be line number 2.\n\n373\n00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:30.616\nThis whole thing, right,\nline number part of line number 2 and\n\n374\n00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:33.822\nthen line number 3 with that right.\n\n375\n00:17:33.822 --> 00:17:37.853\nAnd so when we do that, and then sorry,\nscrewed that up, line number 3 and\n\n376\n00:17:37.853 --> 00:17:38.733\nline number 4.\n\n377\n00:17:38.733 --> 00:17:41.750\nLet me try that better and\nkeep track of what I'm doing there we go.\n\n378\n00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.765\nSo when we do that, we have all that\ntogether, you'd execute that as a script,\n\n379\n00:17:44.765 --> 00:17:47.647\nyou put that all together, create\na little PowerShell scriptlet for that.\n\n380\n00:17:47.647 --> 00:17:50.197\nOr you could execute these\nlines one at a time, but\n\n381\n00:17:50.197 --> 00:17:52.820\nprobably write this in\na small script shave it off.\n\n382\n00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:57.260\nSave it off as a PowerShell script,\nand then you're gonna simply\n\n383\n00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.150\ncall that a run that whenever you want,\nand when you've done that, you'll then be\n\n384\n00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:04.140\nable to do the equivalent of the console\npush install, but from PowerShell.\n\n385\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.730\nAs Daniel asks,\nwhy we do it from PowerShell?\n\n386\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.660\nNot a lot of compelling reasons normally,\nI mean,\n\n387\n00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.560\nliterally you could see it's relatively\neasy to do it from the console.\n\n388\n00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.550\nSo it may just be easier for\nmost of you to do it from there but\n\n389\n00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.000\nif you wanted to do it\nfrom within PowerShell.\n\n390\n00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.710\nIf you wanted to script it, be able to do\nthis against a remote management server,\n\n391\n00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.250\nmanagement group or a resource\npool that you're working with and\n\n392\n00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.720\nyou're gonna be doing it remotely.\n\n393\n00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.540\nThis may be something you wanna\nthink about doing, using PowerShell.\n\n394\n00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.414\nThere's lots of reasons why.\n\n395\n00:18:30.414 --> 00:18:34.230\nBut for the average administrator,\nusing a single console to manage.\n\n396\n00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.710\nRelatively straight forward information,\nrelatively straight forward architecture.\n\n397\n00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.170\nProbably just do it from the console.\n\n398\n00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.420\nBut just don't shy away from power\nshells is what I\"m suggesting to you.\n\n399\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.550\nWe would load that, run that on the Ops\nmanager shell, and assuming we do that,\n\n400\n00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.620\nwe would be able to meet with success and\n\n401\n00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.830\nhopefully that would be the case if we\nwere gonna be comfortable doing it there.\n\n402\n00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.260\nWe could do that with no trouble.\n\n403\n00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:01.150\nNow there was one other PowerShell cmdlet\nthat I had talked about with you earlier,\n\n404\n00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.180\nthere were a couple actually.\n\n405\n00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.270\nAnd I just wanna take advantage of\nsince we're in here and show you.\n\n406\n00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.610\nI didn't write them out ahead of time.\n\n407\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:07.680\nI'm gonna type them in.\n\n408\n00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.150\nBut one of the nice things about using\nthe ops manager shell, using PowerShell\n\n409\n00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:15.330\nin general is the auto tab or\nauto complete feature that power shells,\n\n410\n00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.310\nthe ops manager shell all\nthe magement shells for\n\n411\n00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.880\nany of the products that have\nthe modules loaded have this capability.\n\n412\n00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.139\nSo I can start typing something like set\nand I'm gonna do, what am I gonna do,\n\n413\n00:19:24.139 --> 00:19:25.454\nset scum database scrumming.\n\n414\n00:19:25.454 --> 00:19:30.432\nSo if I do this and I do set-scumdata and\nI don't continue typing but I hit tab,\n\n415\n00:19:30.432 --> 00:19:35.335\nyou'll find that I can start auto tabbing\nthrough the various Items that will\n\n416\n00:19:35.335 --> 00:19:38.671\nmeet this criteria and\nit will autocomplete for me.\n\n417\n00:19:38.671 --> 00:19:41.417\nAnd if we go to full screen for\njust a second,\n\n418\n00:19:41.417 --> 00:19:46.097\nwhat you'll see is it autocompleted\nSet-SCOMDatabaseGroomingSetting\n\n419\n00:19:46.097 --> 00:19:47.740\nas the cmdlet that I want.\n\n420\n00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.490\nAnd that's actually one that I do want.\n\n421\n00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.170\nBecause then I can specify.\n\n422\n00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.880\nAnd if we stay full screen here,\n\n423\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.849\nyou're gonna see me autocomplete again,\nalertdays.\n\n424\n00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:01.190\nAnd without specifying the rest,\nalert days to keep is what I wanna use.\n\n425\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.158\nAnd I wanna specify what the alert days\nto keep will be if I set that to 60,\n\n426\n00:20:05.158 --> 00:20:09.193\nthen I'm able to run that and set the\nnumber of alert days that I wanna keep.\n\n427\n00:20:09.193 --> 00:20:12.890\nInstead of that standard of that, let's\nsay, seven days for data retention that\n\n428\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.805\nI showed you in the prior episode where we\nwent through and looked at the settings.\n\n429\n00:20:16.805 --> 00:20:17.875\nWe now set that to 60.\n\n430\n00:20:17.875 --> 00:20:21.565\nAnd so we can modify that\ndirectly from the shell and\n\n431\n00:20:21.565 --> 00:20:22.805\nwe can do that with no trouble.\n\n432\n00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:26.195\nSo this is one of the ways in which\nwe can modify and change things.\n\n433\n00:20:26.195 --> 00:20:29.445\nI wanna show you one more here really\nquickly just while we're doing that.\n\n434\n00:20:29.445 --> 00:20:33.591\nLet me just get to my item here that\nI wanna share with you and show you.\n\n435\n00:20:33.591 --> 00:20:37.264\nAnd I will make a note, or\nrather I'll type it in for you.\n\n436\n00:20:37.264 --> 00:20:39.436\nOf course that's what happens when\nyou put your notes together and\n\n437\n00:20:39.436 --> 00:20:40.378\nput them in the wrong order.\n\n438\n00:20:40.378 --> 00:20:42.390\nAll right, one more second here.\n\n439\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.220\nWhere is the other one?\n\n440\n00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.280\nThere it is right there.\n\n441\n00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.220\nAll right, so let's do set\nSCOM Alert resolution settings.\n\n442\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.720\nTalk about this one as well.\n\n443\n00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.490\nAnd so if we do set SCOM Alert, and\nwe don't bother to continue typing, and\n\n444\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.730\nwe start autotabbing you'll\nsee it goes ahead and\n\n445\n00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.530\nit starts to let me run through\nall the different ones.\n\n446\n00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.710\nSet alert,\nthen set alert resolution setting.\n\n447\n00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.230\nThere's only two command for\n\n448\n00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.360\nthis particular one so\nI don't have a lot of choices.\n\n449\n00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.443\nIf I had more than two I would just\niterate through hitting the tab until I\n\n450\n00:21:09.443 --> 00:21:10.883\nfind the one that I like.\n\n451\n00:21:10.883 --> 00:21:14.465\nI'll let you in on a little secret\nI cheat a lot when I do PowerShell.\n\n452\n00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:15.827\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember all the console\n\n453\n00:21:15.827 --> 00:21:16.433\ncommandments.\n\n454\n00:21:16.433 --> 00:21:17.950\nNobody does, right?\n\n455\n00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.680\nIf they tell you they do,\nthey're lying to you.\n\n456\n00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.000\nWhat most people will do,\neven if they use PowerShell all the time,\n\n457\n00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.010\nthey'll remember 15, 20, 30, 40, whatever\nthat number is that they use all the time.\n\n458\n00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:28.230\nThere's a few hundred in there.\n\n459\n00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.910\nI don't use them all on a regular basis.\n\n460\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.511\nI don't remember most of them,\nwhat I do is I'll auto tab and\n\n461\n00:21:32.511 --> 00:21:35.529\nas I start typing I have a general\nsense what the command is that I want.\n\n462\n00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:39.000\nI gotta do a SCOM alert,\nI'll type that in, I get a few options.\n\n463\n00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.964\nI'll auto tab through until I\nfind the one I'm looking for and\n\n464\n00:21:41.964 --> 00:21:43.510\nthen I'll keep going, right.\n\n465\n00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.260\nSo that's what most of us do,\n\n466\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.860\nat least most of us that are humble\nenough to admit that in public.\n\n467\n00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.692\nAnyway, we'll say that's what we do.\n\n468\n00:21:48.692 --> 00:21:49.431\n&gt;&gt; Cheat sheets, I love them.\n\n469\n00:21:49.431 --> 00:21:51.906\n&gt;&gt; Or cheat sheets, you could do that\neither way, it's the same thing.\n\n470\n00:21:51.906 --> 00:21:54.110\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\njust finish this statement out.\n\n471\n00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:57.510\nLet's do, I would do alert autoresolve, so\n\n472\n00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.670\nwe'll do alert autores don't\nneed to do much more than that.\n\n473\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.932\nYou'll see that actually autocompletes for\nautoresolve number of days,\n\n474\n00:22:04.932 --> 00:22:06.293\nwe'll do that to 20.\n\n475\n00:22:06.293 --> 00:22:09.990\nNot 230 cuz that's not\ngonna be good lets do 20.\n\n476\n00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:14.442\nLets do healthy, and there's well,\nwe'll do a healthy alert And\n\n477\n00:22:14.442 --> 00:22:17.793\nwe'll auto tab complete that for\nresolved days.\n\n478\n00:22:17.793 --> 00:22:22.300\nAnd we'll do 15 on that one and\nwe'll go ahead and specify that.\n\n479\n00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.878\nGet that setup and then once we've\ndone that we've actually gone in and\n\n480\n00:22:26.878 --> 00:22:31.380\nused the PowerShell ops manager\nconsole to modify some of the settings\n\n481\n00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:35.367\nthat we were talking about and\nshared with you in PowerShell.\n\n482\n00:22:35.367 --> 00:22:38.210\nAnd we could take a look\nat the result to that.\n\n483\n00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.920\nWe'll just leave that minimized here but\ncome back to it in just a minute.\n\n484\n00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.449\nLet's go down here and\njust show you what we just did.\n\n485\n00:22:43.449 --> 00:22:46.660\nSo let's go down here to settings.\n\n486\n00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.465\nLet's go over here real quick and\nwe can go in, go to alerts.\n\n487\n00:22:50.465 --> 00:22:55.240\nLet's right click, go to properties and\ngo to alert resolution and\n\n488\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.278\nremember we were talking about 30 and\n7 here, right?\n\n489\n00:22:59.278 --> 00:23:03.340\nThese were the standard\ndefaults that we had specified.\n\n490\n00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.180\nWe can go into database grooming.\n\n491\n00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.480\nLet's go into database grooming cuz\nI did modify database grooming.\n\n492\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.280\nWhat did I set database grooming to?\n\n493\n00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.540\nLet's just refresh the console here\nreal quick cuz that's not showing up.\n\n494\n00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.980\nWell actually let's just\ndo this we'll just open\n\n495\n00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.790\nthe console up one more time\nreal quick just get that.\n\n496\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.804\nSometime the console\ndoesn't always refresh so\n\n497\n00:23:21.804 --> 00:23:25.239\nsometimes you gotta actually either reload\nor just refresh it when you run the power\n\n498\n00:23:25.239 --> 00:23:28.446\nshell scripts to be able to get it to show\nup and actually show you the changes.\n\n499\n00:23:28.446 --> 00:23:32.940\nSo let's go back in here real quick\nWe'll go back down to Settings.\n\n500\n00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.179\nUsually easier just to reload the console.\n\n501\n00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:36.195\nSo we'll just go to Settings here.\n\n502\n00:23:36.195 --> 00:23:37.836\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n503\n00:23:37.836 --> 00:23:42.171\nLet's go in here and let's go over here.\n\n504\n00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:46.459\nAnd you'll see now may be kinda hard\nto see if we zoom in or just go well,\n\n505\n00:23:46.459 --> 00:23:47.348\nwe actually.\n\n506\n00:23:47.348 --> 00:23:48.311\nWhat am I saying?\nWe are full screen.\n\n507\n00:23:48.311 --> 00:23:49.609\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me use my magic powers and\n\n508\n00:23:49.609 --> 00:23:50.293\npull you even closer.\n\n509\n00:23:50.293 --> 00:23:54.269\nBut what you can see, and I'll kinda\nclick away on the far side of that one,\n\n510\n00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:57.990\nis once we reloaded the console,\nit refreshes automatically.\n\n511\n00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.424\nWell, automatically is relative, but\n\n512\n00:23:59.424 --> 00:24:02.259\nit should refresh automatically,\ndoesn't always it is Microsoft after all.\n\n513\n00:24:02.259 --> 00:24:06.409\nSometimes you do have to restart things,\nbut you can see the specified settings or\n\n514\n00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:10.260\nparameters that we used, 20 days now for\nresolve alerts that are in the new\n\n515\n00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.112\nresolution state 15 days if they are\nhealthy and just to remind us of what we\n\n516\n00:24:14.112 --> 00:24:17.410\ndid, and we'll take a look at\nthe other one here, as well.\n\n517\n00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:18.975\nBut just to remind us of what we did,\n\n518\n00:24:18.975 --> 00:24:23.630\nlet's bring up the shell,\nbring that down so we can kinda see this.\n\n519\n00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.600\nAnd what we'll see here is\nthat at the very bottom item,\n\n520\n00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.460\nif I can highlight we can probably see\nthat, make that blue, there we go.\n\n521\n00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.380\nYou can see right there,\nwe set it to 15 days and\n\n522\n00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.830\nwe set it to 20 days respectively.\n\n523\n00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:42.926\nAnd as a result, we can actually see that\nthose settings are gonna be the ones that\n\n524\n00:24:42.926 --> 00:24:43.898\nwe are looking at.\n\n525\n00:24:43.898 --> 00:24:49.850\nAnd if we go in here to Database Grooming,\nright click, go in here to Properties.\n\n526\n00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:53.290\nYou could see Resolved Alerts right\nat the top is now set to 60 days,\n\n527\n00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.020\nwhich is the one that I was monkeying\naround with and changing as well.\n\n528\n00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.430\nNow, could we have edited this\none directly from the console?\n\n529\n00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.240\nCould've gone in and\ndone that right here, so\n\n530\n00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.170\nto Daniel's point again,\nHey why PowerShell, why the ops console?\n\n531\n00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.185\nWe could have done that from\neither perspective, but\n\n532\n00:25:07.185 --> 00:25:11.410\ndoing it in the ops manager console\njust gives us additional flexibility.\n\n533\n00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:15.184\n&gt;&gt; I could see using PowerShell for like,\nokay this isn't my first rodeo, I just\n\n534\n00:25:15.184 --> 00:25:18.860\nwant to very quickly, deploy this out and\nset all my settings the way I want.\n\n535\n00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.527\nYou make a bunch of PowerShell scripts and\n\n536\n00:25:20.527 --> 00:25:23.490\nyou let them run through each one\nindividually and everything's set up.\n\n537\n00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.200\nYou don't have to go through and do all\nthe clicks and do all the settings so\n\n538\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.960\njust jump to the PowerShell,\nI can see that being easier.\n\n539\n00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.493\n&gt;&gt; It could be and\n\n540\n00:25:29.493 --> 00:25:32.300\nthat that may legitimately be one of\nthe reasons why you may want to do that.\n\n541\n00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.171\nThere's nothing wrong with that at all,\nabsolutely let's go in and\n\n542\n00:25:36.171 --> 00:25:40.041\none of the things that we use with\nthe console push is the msi file which\n\n543\n00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:41.193\nis MOMAgent.msi.\n\n544\n00:25:41.193 --> 00:25:43.872\nJust wanna show you where you find that\ncuz it's actually interesting when you\n\n545\n00:25:43.872 --> 00:25:46.345\nlook for the agent, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look real quick.\n\n546\n00:25:46.345 --> 00:25:49.945\nWe're in the ops manager, let me\nactually back out of the directory here,\n\n547\n00:25:49.945 --> 00:25:51.275\nwe're in the ops manager.\n\n548\n00:25:51.275 --> 00:25:56.790\nSo we're gonna go in, go to Program Files,\nwe're gonna go in System Center 2012.\n\n549\n00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:00.430\nWe can see Ops Manager DPM,\nwe did our install there.\n\n550\n00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:04.490\nGonna go into Ops Manager,\ngonna go to Server and then under Server,\n\n551\n00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:09.080\nyou'll see that we have various different\ncomponents, we have Agent Management.\n\n552\n00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.600\nInside Agent Management,\nwe're gonna have agent logs, so\n\n553\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.500\nif you have to do any troubleshooting,\ncome in here.\n\n554\n00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.320\nLook for your agent logs, so we can see\nthe logs here, that might be helpful for\n\n555\n00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.350\nus at some point to take note of.\n\n556\n00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:24.280\nWe've got amd64 unix and x86,\ndifferent versions of the agents,\n\n557\n00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.270\ndepending on the particular\nversion we need.\n\n558\n00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:30.870\nWe'll go into amd64, and\nin here, MOMAgent.msi,\n\n559\n00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.660\nwe have the MOMAgent.msi package for\n\n560\n00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.405\nevery agent type that we're\ngoing to install of equivalent.\n\n561\n00:26:37.405 --> 00:26:41.322\nSo when we're doing an x64 install\nfrom the console with PowerShell doing\n\n562\n00:26:41.322 --> 00:26:45.421\nthe push, that's the file we're actually\ncalling and using right there, and\n\n563\n00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:47.555\nthat's what does the install for us.\n\n564\n00:26:47.555 --> 00:26:51.111\nIf we're gonna do a manual install,\nwe have to actually execute that file,\n\n565\n00:26:51.111 --> 00:26:53.125\nand that's what we do to a manual install.\n\n566\n00:26:53.125 --> 00:26:54.929\nSo you wanna know where that is, and\n\n567\n00:26:54.929 --> 00:26:57.980\nobviously just have a sense\nof what we're installing.\n\n568\n00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.090\nIt's easy to sit in the console and\nsay next, next, next,\n\n569\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.380\nand have it go do its thing.\n\n570\n00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.869\nBut you probably wanna actually look under\nthe hood and actually understand what\n\n571\n00:27:04.869 --> 00:27:07.700\nyou're installing and\nhow that actually is going to come about.\n\n572\n00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.867\nAnd that's what the actual target\nprogram would be that we're using, so\n\n573\n00:27:10.867 --> 00:27:12.660\njust thought I'd show that to you.\n\n574\n00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:18.630\nWe also can do an integration of\nthe ops manager with Active Directory,\n\n575\n00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:19.930\nthis is important as well.\n\n576\n00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:23.495\nIf we do this, agents can automatically\nget their management group\n\n577\n00:27:23.495 --> 00:27:27.260\nsettings from AD and be configured\nthat way, much like we do with SCCM.\n\n578\n00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.807\nWhere with SCCM and the agent,\n\n579\n00:27:28.807 --> 00:27:32.240\nwe can tell it automatically\nwhat site it's associated with.\n\n580\n00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.351\nAnd give it information from\nthe management point, pull that out of AD\n\n581\n00:27:35.351 --> 00:27:38.852\nbased on the container we create, so\nwe want to make sure we're aware of that.\n\n582\n00:27:38.852 --> 00:27:40.970\nI'm gonna show you quickly\nhow that will be configured.\n\n583\n00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:45.470\nThere's a little group policy thought\nprocess we'll engage in separately for\n\n584\n00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.960\nageless exception monitoring, I wanna\nbriefly touch on that with you as well,\n\n585\n00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.800\nbut this one's fairly straightforward.\n\n586\n00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.270\nThe most important thing you gotta\nremember here is that the Windows domain\n\n587\n00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:59.090\nlevel, the running level for\nAD has to be at a certain minimal level.\n\n588\n00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:03.710\nWe need either Windows 2000 Native, or\nServer 2003 mixed to allow agents to be\n\n589\n00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.530\nauto assigned, so I just want to\nmake sure you're aware of that.\n\n590\n00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:11.469\nWhat we can do here is just take a look\nreal quick, let's just go out here,\n\n591\n00:28:11.469 --> 00:28:14.350\njust make sure our lab is staying current.\n\n592\n00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:18.093\nAnd we can go out to this website,\nthis will actually allow you to see\n\n593\n00:28:18.093 --> 00:28:22.494\nthe Active Directory Domain Services\ninformation, that how you set that up and\n\n594\n00:28:22.494 --> 00:28:24.740\nassign that automatically through AD.\n\n595\n00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.630\nWe have to use a tool to\nbe able to manage, and\n\n596\n00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.620\nthat tool's gonna be the ADMT tool.\n\n597\n00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.926\nAnd if you're gonna be able to go out and\nuse that we'll see here,\n\n598\n00:28:33.926 --> 00:28:36.290\nor not the ADMT tool,\nsorry thinking about the wrong thing.\n\n599\n00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.753\nThat's gonna be the MOMADAdmin\ntool that we're gonna be using,\n\n600\n00:28:38.753 --> 00:28:41.550\nI'm gonna show you where this is,\nit's in the Server directory as well.\n\n601\n00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.246\nBut the domain admin will use the\nMOMADAdmin tool to be able to set this up\n\n602\n00:28:45.246 --> 00:28:48.280\nand create the container that\nwe're gonna be able to use.\n\n603\n00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.050\nSo talk a little bit about this here,\n\n604\n00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.180\nif you wanna see where\nthis is gonna be located.\n\n605\n00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.920\nWe're just gonna go back into\nour server here, let's go to our\n\n606\n00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.590\nSCOM directory, let's just back\nout a couple of spaces here.\n\n607\n00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.692\nAnd what we're gonna do is\njust come down here and\n\n608\n00:29:07.692 --> 00:29:12.590\nlet's go down to MOM [SOUND]\nMOMADAdmin right there.\n\n609\n00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:16.035\nThat is our program,\nthat's the application right above it,\n\n610\n00:29:16.035 --> 00:29:18.180\nthat's the XML config file for it, but\n\n611\n00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.540\nthat's what we're gonna use to set up\nthe integration with active directory.\n\n612\n00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.098\nThe MOMADAdmin tool is in the root\ndirectory, so when we do the install here,\n\n613\n00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:27.760\nif you wanna take a look at the path.\n\n614\n00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.163\nWhen I say the root directory, I mean the\ninstall of SCOM in that main directory in\n\n615\n00:29:31.163 --> 00:29:33.850\nthe Server folder,\nit's where we're gonna find that.\n\n616\n00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:37.410\nYou would, as a domain admin, run that\ntool and then be able to configure out\n\n617\n00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.480\nthe integration, have the container set\nup, and then the client would be able to\n\n618\n00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.410\ntake advantage of that and be able to\ndraw down its information it's setting.\n\n619\n00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.680\nSo we can integrate there, and the website\nwe showed you gives you a little bit of\n\n620\n00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:53.370\ninformation about that, we also can do\nsome agent-less exception monitoring.\n\n621\n00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:54.980\nIf we're gonna be doing that and\n\n622\n00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.210\nmonitoring without the agent being\ninstalled directly gathering up\n\n623\n00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.000\nthat information, centralizing it, and\nusing it, we have to configure this.\n\n624\n00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.345\nIt's a two step process,\nwe're gonna collect and\n\n625\n00:30:04.345 --> 00:30:08.165\ncentrally store information about the OS\nof the machine that we're targeting,\n\n626\n00:30:08.165 --> 00:30:10.555\nthe application errors that\nmay be associated with it.\n\n627\n00:30:10.555 --> 00:30:13.895\nBut we have to configure this in\na multi-step process, I just want to show\n\n628\n00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:17.415\nyou this cuz this is kind of interesting,\nand some of you don't always get to see.\n\n629\n00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:21.135\nWe're gonna go in and we're gonna do\nclient monitoring from up here first, or\n\n630\n00:30:21.135 --> 00:30:22.285\nset it up up here first.\n\n631\n00:30:22.285 --> 00:30:24.565\nSo we're gonna come up here\nto management servers,\n\n632\n00:30:24.565 --> 00:30:28.740\nwe actually started out where we started\nthe discussion on the demo earlier.\n\n633\n00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.850\nShowing you that we have the RMS\nemulator if you remember,\n\n634\n00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.520\nwe were in this work space.\n\n635\n00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.549\nWe're gonna come back up here, we're gonna\nhighlight this, and once we get this we\n\n636\n00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:40.092\nhave configure client monitoring off\nto the right, under our task area.\n\n637\n00:30:40.092 --> 00:30:43.670\nWe're gonna run this wizard, it's gonna\nset up the client monitoring for us.\n\n638\n00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.590\nIt's also gonna generate\na group policy template\n\n639\n00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.290\nthat will then have to be deployed.\n\n640\n00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:52.650\nAnd then allow us to configure the systems\nthat are going to be bound for\n\n641\n00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.290\nagentless monitoring to be\nset up the right way so\n\n642\n00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:58.790\nwe can gather information from them\nwithout putting an agent on them.\n\n643\n00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.690\nSo it's a two step process,\nit's kinda cool,\n\n644\n00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:04.230\nwe're gonna leverage group policy to get,\nessentially,\n\n645\n00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:07.590\nthe monitoring we need done through SCOM,\nand configure it out accordingly.\n\n646\n00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.950\nSo it's kinda neat,\nwe're gonna set up, and\n\n647\n00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.010\nsee how this is done,\ngonna go ahead and click here.\n\n648\n00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:17.780\nI've gone ahead and hidden the auto hide,\nuse the auto hide feature on the task bar,\n\n649\n00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.540\nby the way, cuz these wizard windows,\nas you've seen,\n\n650\n00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.730\nsome of our other demos, come up and we\nlose the bottom portion with the buttons.\n\n651\n00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.510\nAnd unless we use the force to be able to\nactually hit the button there's no way for\n\n652\n00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.820\nus to actually click.\n\n653\n00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.553\nSo I've done that, you don't have\nto do that in the real world but\n\n654\n00:31:31.553 --> 00:31:34.400\nin the constrained environment with\nthe video screen that we have.\n\n655\n00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.398\nOr the way we have to deploy and\ndisplay for you so you can see it here,\n\n656\n00:31:37.398 --> 00:31:40.700\nit constrains the size, and\nwe just can't get a full-size screen.\n\n657\n00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.010\nSo I'm gonna click Next here, we're\ngoing to go ahead and decide whether or\n\n658\n00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:47.890\nnot we wanna opt in for the customer\nexperience improvement program.\n\n659\n00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:51.600\nIt's up to us, I'm gonna leave it at No,\nbut if we opt in, we could do that.\n\n660\n00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.260\nWe have to set up a file share and\na path where we're gonna be able to store\n\n661\n00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.805\nthe actual error data that's gonna\nbe aggregated and collected up.\n\n662\n00:31:58.805 --> 00:32:02.483\nSo we're gonna wanna specify this,\nnow this could be on the local machine,\n\n663\n00:32:02.483 --> 00:32:05.888\ncould be a UNC out to a file server\nsomewhere, it's up to us to decide.\n\n664\n00:32:05.888 --> 00:32:10.009\nI'm just gonna keep it real simple,\nI'm gonna do this, and I'm gonna do.\n\n665\n00:32:10.009 --> 00:32:14.815\nError data in the C drive, so we'll just\ncreate a share and instantiate that and\n\n666\n00:32:14.815 --> 00:32:17.630\nwe'll be able to do that\nhere in just a moment.\n\n667\n00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.430\nWe're gonna collect error reports\nfrom Windows based clients,\n\n668\n00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.300\neverything from Windows Vista forward.\n\n669\n00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.230\nWe're gonna use port 51906 to do that,\n\n670\n00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:29.520\nso we'll be able to use SSL to\nbe able to do this securely.\n\n671\n00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.510\nSo we're gonna lock this down and\nsecure that communication.\n\n672\n00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:36.350\nWe'll use Windows Authentication as well,\nso we're gonna have all that.\n\n673\n00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:40.180\nGonna click Next, if we want to enable\nerror forwarding to Microsoft to\n\n674\n00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.920\nopt in and send them our errors,\nwe'll be able to do that as well.\n\n675\n00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.560\nNot gonna bother with that, but we could.\n\n676\n00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.370\nWe'll use an existing user account called\nthe Action Account if we choose to, or\n\n677\n00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.540\nwe could specify another\naccount to drive this.\n\n678\n00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.130\nYou'll see if we pull down,\nwe only have the Action Account item, so\n\n679\n00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:55.760\nwe're gonna choose Action Account.\n\n680\n00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.260\nWell we could be a dummy credential\nif we wanted to and use that.\n\n681\n00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.650\nIt's not going to be saved but we will be\nable to use that to generate the template,\n\n682\n00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:03.710\nit will be up to us.\n\n683\n00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.320\nWe'll click Next, it takes just a minute,\ncreates the file share.\n\n684\n00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.590\nNow just before we continue,\nlet's go take a look real quick.\n\n685\n00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.200\nGo to the root of the C: drive\non the local machine, and\n\n686\n00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:17.080\nthere is our file share errordata and\nyou'll see we have a bunch of stuff in\n\n687\n00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.030\nthere that's populated as part of\nthe wizard that we're running.\n\n688\n00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:24.590\nWe've got a cabs folder, a counts folder,\npersisted cap status, and\n\n689\n00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.030\na policy text document.\n\n690\n00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.095\nThat's all created as part of\nthe wizard that we're running.\n\n691\n00:33:28.095 --> 00:33:30.255\nSo we're going to go ahead\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n692\n00:33:30.255 --> 00:33:33.020\nWe're then gonna specify create\ngroup policy admin template,\n\n693\n00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.705\nit's where the group policy\ntemplate gets created.\n\n694\n00:33:35.705 --> 00:33:38.765\nThis is an ADM file that gets created,\nand has all the settings, so\n\n695\n00:33:38.765 --> 00:33:40.935\nwe've basically populated\nit out in the wizard.\n\n696\n00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:44.245\nOnce we do that, we'll then have to\napply it to the desired computers.\n\n697\n00:33:44.245 --> 00:33:47.425\nWe'll typically go deploy this\nthrough the domain controller or\n\n698\n00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:51.412\nthe domain control architecture we have,\nand apply this to whatever O user groups\n\n699\n00:33:51.412 --> 00:33:53.982\nthe machines we want to do\nagentless monitoring on.\n\n700\n00:33:53.982 --> 00:33:57.465\nThere may be certain machines we can't\ninstall an agent on, but still want to\n\n701\n00:33:57.465 --> 00:34:01.140\nmonitor, maybe regulatory compliance\nissues or things of that nature.\n\n702\n00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.000\nI get this a lot with military and\ngovernment clients, where there's very\n\n703\n00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.370\nspecific lock down requirements that\nare populated for certain machines.\n\n704\n00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:12.300\nThey call them STIGs, security technical\nimplementation guides that are used,\n\n705\n00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.360\nput out by DISA and other groups.\n\n706\n00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.150\nAnd those groups are saying,\nhey a typical default install or\n\n707\n00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:21.920\ntypical standard install for\na desktop or server looks like this.\n\n708\n00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.350\nAnd it may or may not include the agent.\n\n709\n00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:27.946\nIf it doesn't include the agent, you maybe\nable to use policy manipulation if you\n\n710\n00:34:27.946 --> 00:34:30.418\nwill to be able to do\nagentless monitoring.\n\n711\n00:34:30.418 --> 00:34:34.130\nSo there's a lot of reasons why this may\nor may not make sense, be up to us, so\n\n712\n00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:35.240\nwe'll specify that.\n\n713\n00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.891\nWe have our path here where\nthe admin template will be saved.\n\n714\n00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:41.351\nYou'll see by default that it's\n\n715\n00:34:41.351 --> 00:34:43.820\nUsers/Administrator/PracticeLabs/Docume-\nnts.\n\n716\n00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.480\nIn other words, it will be in my\nuser profile under Documents but\n\n717\n00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.200\nI can modify that and\nput that wherever I would like.\n\n718\n00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.870\nLet's click Finish, get that set up,\nso that's been done.\n\n719\n00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.700\nSo now that we have that piece up and\nrunning we'll go ahead and\n\n720\n00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.770\nthen we'll configure the policy settings.\n\n721\n00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.200\nWe'll deploy that template,\n\n722\n00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.090\nand then we'll actually have set up\nagentless exception monitoring, and\n\n723\n00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:07.680\nby doing that we'll have the ability to\nthen to be able to go in and use that.\n\n724\n00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.390\nIf we want to see just quickly as\nwe're wrapping up here what that\n\n725\n00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.400\noutput looks like we can go in.\n\n726\n00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.585\nGo here to our C: drive,\ngo into our Documents directory,\n\n727\n00:35:17.585 --> 00:35:21.699\nlet's just extend that out real quick so\nyou can see that.\n\n728\n00:35:21.699 --> 00:35:24.943\nBut you can see our ADM file\nis right there, right, so\n\n729\n00:35:24.943 --> 00:35:27.120\nthat's our policy template.\n\n730\n00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.352\nWe can go ahead and open that up.\n\n731\n00:35:28.352 --> 00:35:32.486\nWe know that it is hopefully\njust a notepad document.\n\n732\n00:35:32.486 --> 00:35:35.386\nEssentially it's a text file, right,\nso we can just open that up and\n\n733\n00:35:35.386 --> 00:35:36.391\nsee what it looks like.\n\n734\n00:35:36.391 --> 00:35:40.226\nAnd we can see that it's got all\nthe settings and information for\n\n735\n00:35:40.226 --> 00:35:42.420\nthe wizard that we ran through.\n\n736\n00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.860\nPretty detailed as you can see\nas we're scrolling through.\n\n737\n00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.988\nYou getting all this Dan?\n\n738\n00:35:45.988 --> 00:35:48.812\n[CROSSTALK] There's gonna be\na test after we get done.\n\n739\n00:35:48.812 --> 00:35:52.743\nSo we have the whole thing there and\nthen we would import this ADM file into\n\n740\n00:35:52.743 --> 00:35:57.330\nthe domain controller using the GPM, the\nGroup Policy Management console editor.\n\n741\n00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:00.630\nWe would import and apply it and\nthen we would simply\n\n742\n00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:04.220\nuse to it apply these policy settings to\nwhatever machines that we need to manage.\n\n743\n00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.630\nSo that's how we will configure\nagentless exception monitoring.\n\n744\n00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:10.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, well it's a good spot for\nus to go ahead and\n\n745\n00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.740\ncall it another show because\nwe have more to continue.\n\n746\n00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:17.380\nBut we're almost at the station,\nconfiguring this system out.\n\n747\n00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.810\nSo bear with us, we're almost there.\n\n748\n00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.570\nAdam, thank you for bringing us thus far,\n\n749\n00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.620\nI know you're gonna take us the rest\nof the way home very shortly.\n\n750\n00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.760\nWe do thank our viewers out there for\nwatching but\n\n751\n00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.150\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n752\n00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.590\nFor ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n753\n00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:31.130\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n754\n00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.640\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n755\n00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:40.320\n[MUSIC]\n\n756\n00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.932\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.345\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:12.400\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.120\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.960\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are back with more\n\n8\n00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.900\non our data center monitoring\nwith Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.500\nAnd joining us in the studio, yet again,\nour good friend and mentor Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.890\nAdam, welcome back, good sir,\nglad to have you again.\n\n11\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.309\n&gt;&gt; Always a pleasure,\nthank you very much, appreciate it.\n\n12\n00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:33.949\n&gt;&gt; Very formal here.\n\n13\n00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And thank you.\n\n14\n00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.780\nAll right, so we're gonna continue.\n\n15\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.340\nWe're gonna round out our discussions here\n\n16\n00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.960\nwith regards of some of\nthe bedrock foundational elements.\n\n17\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.980\nAssociated with setting up and\nconfiguring various aspects of SCOM.\n\n18\n00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.981\nAnd some of the supporting\nelements we've been through and\n\n19\n00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:52.750\ndone a series of demos as\nindividual episodes for you.\n\n20\n00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.069\nOn configuring all of the products,\n\n21\n00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:55.830\nencourage you to take\na look at all of those.\n\n22\n00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.540\nMake sure you go back and\nhave an opportunity to do so, but\n\n23\n00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.680\nthere's one little aspect\nwe haven't hit on yet.\n\n24\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.600\nAlways of interest, wanna talk about it.\n\n25\n00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.574\nAlways important from\na security standpoint,\n\n26\n00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:06.310\nan operational management standpoint.\n\n27\n00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.440\nTo know where our data's going,\nwhat we're doing with it.\n\n28\n00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.730\nAnd we are talking, of course,\nabout audit collection services, or ACS.\n\n29\n00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.020\nHow are we collecting data?\n\n30\n00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.480\nWhere are we gonna centrally put it?\n\n31\n00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.940\nAnd how are we gonna manage it?\n\n32\n00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.210\nWe may choose to leave it in\nthe databases that we're using,\n\n33\n00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.530\nthe operational database, data warehouse.\n\n34\n00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.610\nWe may choose to aggregate it separately.\n\n35\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.201\nPut it out on the audit\ncollection database and\n\n36\n00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:27.070\nuse that to then be able to drive.\n\n37\n00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.800\nAthough, we don't have reports by default.\n\n38\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.769\nBut we can upload them,\n\n39\n00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:32.780\nreporting through the audit collection\nservice from various machines.\n\n40\n00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.090\nSo thought it'd be good to just talk\nabout this for a minute with you.\n\n41\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.450\nWalk you through the three component\nparts associated with ACS.\n\n42\n00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.550\nShow you quickly how the enablement\nof the auto collection capability\n\n43\n00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.540\nis gonna be done.\n\n44\n00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.394\nIt's a little task we use,\nshow you what service that attaches to,\n\n45\n00:01:47.394 --> 00:01:49.008\nhow that's all gonna come together.\n\n46\n00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.968\nTalk to you about the ADT admin tool which\nis the command line tool we often use to\n\n47\n00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:54.370\nadminister this.\n\n48\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.551\nAnd in general give you\na review of something that,\n\n49\n00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:57.880\nalthough we speak a lot about.\n\n50\n00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.862\nIt isn't always self evident and\nobvious, let's put it that way.\n\n51\n00:02:00.862 --> 00:02:02.617\nSo I thought we'd spend\na few minutes on it.\n\n52\n00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:05.249\nSo, the ACS components,\nthe three things that make up ACS,\n\n53\n00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:07.285\nwe have what are called the forwarders.\n\n54\n00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:09.525\nWe have the collectors,\nwe have the database.\n\n55\n00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:13.445\nThe forwarders are gonna be\nthe agent service that runs under\n\n56\n00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:17.095\nthe Microsoft Monitoring Agent\nthat's installed on every machine.\n\n57\n00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.055\nThere's a sub service associated with it.\n\n58\n00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.120\nWe'll take a look at that in a minute.\n\n59\n00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.490\nThis is gonna act as a collector for us.\n\n60\n00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.820\nNot the collector,\nwe just said, is part two.\n\n61\n00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.449\nBut rather, the forwarder\nsimply aggregates the data for\n\n62\n00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:29.850\nus on the individual machine.\n\n63\n00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.097\nAnd that allows us to send that\nout to a centralized collector,\n\n64\n00:02:33.097 --> 00:02:37.100\nwhich will gather the data from all\nthe different machines being monitored.\n\n65\n00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.620\nAnd then send that out and\ncentralize that in the database.\n\n66\n00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.530\nSo we have the forwarders,\nwe'll take a look at how to enable that.\n\n67\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.730\nWe have the collectors.\n\n68\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.130\nThis is the information, the event data\nthat comes in from the ACS folders.\n\n69\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.060\nWe process it at the collector and\nstore the data in the ACS database.\n\n70\n00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.520\nAnd the database itself is then\nwhat we're gonna also focus on.\n\n71\n00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.820\nGot a little bit of a minimum\nrequirement hardware,\n\n72\n00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.450\nsoftware kinda thing going\non with the database.\n\n73\n00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.340\nI'll show you a web page.\n\n74\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.630\nYou can read up on that.\n\n75\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.001\nBut the important thing to think\nabout is the fact that we specify and\n\n76\n00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:08.141\nreally do give you some guidance on using.\n\n77\n00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:11.886\nOr the difference between using standard\nversus enterprise on the SQL side for\n\n78\n00:03:11.886 --> 00:03:14.180\nthis database in particular.\n\n79\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.370\nRecommendation is to use\nEnterprise as opposed to standard,\n\n80\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.080\nand there's an interesting reason why.\n\n81\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.340\nI'm not gonna put Daniel on\nthe spot ask him if he knows why,\n\n82\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.790\nbecause I haven't told him why.\n\n83\n00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.060\nAnd he would then be honest and tell\nyou I don't know, cuz he doesn't know.\n\n84\n00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.010\nCuz he doesn't configure this particular\npart of SCOM and work with it.\n\n85\n00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.080\nAnd you may not know either,\nand this is pretty common.\n\n86\n00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.320\nA lot of people are not aware of\nthe reason why we have to do this.\n\n87\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.370\nBut it's interesting.\n\n88\n00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.670\nWhen we run the actual daily\nmaintenance cycles on the database.\n\n89\n00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.570\nIf we use standard, we pause the ACS\ndatabase in order to do maintenance on it.\n\n90\n00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.130\nAnd there's a backlog of\ninformation that gets\n\n91\n00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.960\nessentially just backed up at\nthe collector that cannot be processed.\n\n92\n00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.390\nIf we use the enterprise size database or\ndeploy on the enterprise product.\n\n93\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.081\nWe don't pause the database\nwhile we're the maintenance or\n\n94\n00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:00.630\nthe daily maintenance cycle.\n\n95\n00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.480\nThe database is running and as a result\nwe can continue information streaming in.\n\n96\n00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.310\nAnd so it is a performance issue and\nthere is a specific do,\n\n97\n00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.100\ndon't do kind of guidance\nthat you wanna follow here.\n\n98\n00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.490\nNot saying that if you use\nthe standard database,\n\n99\n00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.560\nyou're gonna necessarily\nhave bad performance.\n\n100\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.127\nBut just pointing out that there is\ngonna be a backup in the queue and\n\n101\n00:04:19.127 --> 00:04:20.410\na delay in processing.\n\n102\n00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.680\nAs a result of that daily\nmaintenance cycle that runs.\n\n103\n00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.260\nThat is something you just\nwanna think about and consider.\n\n104\n00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.310\nSpeak a little bit about that in\nthe show notes to make sure you're\n\n105\n00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.300\nfamiliar with that.\n\n106\n00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.140\nJust be aware of that.\n\n107\n00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.796\nAlso encrypted by default,\n\n108\n00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:35.020\nthe communication between the ACS\nforwarder and the ACS collector.\n\n109\n00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.910\nSo we're focusing on security there.\n\n110\n00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.012\nEnsuring that that data is\nnot gonna be compromised or\n\n111\n00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:41.310\nmade available to anybody\nthat's not supposed to see it.\n\n112\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.380\nSo that's important.\n\n113\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.980\nBut they both have to be on the same or\n\n114\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.180\ntrusted domain in order\nto have that happen.\n\n115\n00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.320\nIf it is not the case,\nthen they will not be encrypted.\n\n116\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.099\nAnd normal default\ncommunication in unencrypted or\n\n117\n00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.810\nrather untrusted\nenvironments is unencrypted.\n\n118\n00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.540\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n119\n00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.560\nWe can decide to encrypt, but we have to\nbe in same domain in order to do that.\n\n120\n00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.160\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n121\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.770\nLet's take a look at a couple of\nsupporting elements associated with this\n\n122\n00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.280\nand we'll wrap up our conversation.\n\n123\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.220\nI said this is actually\na really quick topic.\n\n124\n00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.970\nI meant that.\n\n125\n00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.930\nVery rare that I say that and\nI do mean it.\n\n126\n00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.078\nI normally say that and\nwe go 30, 40 minutes.\n\n127\n00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:15.720\nBut we're gonna get you in and\nout in about two and a half.\n\n128\n00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.620\nAnd Daniel's gonna keep\nme honest on this one.\n\n129\n00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.150\nSo let's take a look real quick\nlook at the machine here.\n\n130\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.865\nBefore I show you how to enable\nthe auto collection feature.\n\n131\n00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:25.593\nLet's just take a look at a couple of\nthe elements here that are gonna be\n\n132\n00:05:25.593 --> 00:05:26.600\nimportant for us.\n\n133\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.069\nFirst thing we're gonna do is just quickly\nlook at the service that is targeted for\n\n134\n00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.030\nthat enable auto collection task.\n\n135\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.388\nThat turns on the audit collection\non an individual machine,\n\n136\n00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:38.590\nallows us to aggregate that data.\n\n137\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.450\nI mentioned that it was part\nof one of the services.\n\n138\n00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.047\nOr it's a subset of the services\nthat are installed as\n\n139\n00:05:45.047 --> 00:05:46.730\nthe Microsoft Monitoring Agent.\n\n140\n00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.130\nThe monitoring software that's\ninstalled on every machine.\n\n141\n00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.280\nSo I'm on one of the servers that\nwe've installed the agent on.\n\n142\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.010\nAnd I'm looking underneath the services.\n\n143\n00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.140\nNow, you've gotta know where to look.\n\n144\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.480\nRemember that the agent has been renamed.\n\n145\n00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.850\nIt's now called the Microsoft\nMonitoring Agent, and the services,\n\n146\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.660\nthe Audit Forwarding Service.\n\n147\n00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.650\nSo it's up under Microsoft\nMonitoring Agent Audit Forwarding,\n\n148\n00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.490\nyou can see it there, I've highlighted it.\n\n149\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.680\nAnd notice that it is disabled by default,\nand so it is not running.\n\n150\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.980\nAnd in order for this to be configured\nproperly and turned on, and\n\n151\n00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.780\nconfigured to run automatically.\n\n152\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.150\nWe're gonna go, execute a task\nIn the office manager console.\n\n153\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.323\nThat will configure all the agents\nwe highlight to have this turned on\n\n154\n00:06:23.323 --> 00:06:24.040\nthe right way.\n\n155\n00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.610\nI'm gonna show you how to\ndo that in just a moment.\n\n156\n00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.200\nBut this is the service that we're\ngonna target with that task.\n\n157\n00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.040\nThat task is sitting right here.\n\n158\n00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.480\nCould we go full screen for\na minute just so\n\n159\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.090\nwe can see this in a little more detail?\n\n160\n00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.190\nCuz I wanna show you where this task is.\n\n161\n00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.540\nIt's not self-evident, and it's not\nthe most obvious thing in the world.\n\n162\n00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.660\nAnd you gotta drill through\nthe management packs.\n\n163\n00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.970\nAnd the monitoring specifically\nwork space with the management pack\n\n164\n00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.140\ninformation that's loaded to find that.\n\n165\n00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.130\nHow am I doing on time by the way?\n\n166\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.260\n&gt;&gt; You're good.\n\n167\n00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.525\n&gt;&gt; That's not what I was hoping to hear,\nI was hoping to hear a minute left or\n\n168\n00:06:53.525 --> 00:06:54.541\nsomething, Mr. Timekeeper.\n\n169\n00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:55.436\n&gt;&gt; 13 seconds.\n\n170\n00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:57.019\n&gt;&gt; You're good, you're good, that's all.\n\n171\n00:06:57.019 --> 00:06:58.420\nThis is why I'm not gonna run over.\n\n172\n00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.040\n&gt;&gt; I'll warn you.\n\n173\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.729\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna run over, I know I'm gonna\nrun over it's gonna be like five minutes\n\n174\n00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:02.686\nyou're not gonna tell me.\n\n175\n00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:05.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's take a look real\nquick at where we are, five seconds.\n\n176\n00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.650\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n177\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.760\nI appreciate that, sir.\n\n178\n00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.610\nSo we're in the monitoring workspace.\n\n179\n00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.950\nAnd what we'll see as we scroll down,\n\n180\n00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.900\nwe have to open up\nthe operations manager folder.\n\n181\n00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.310\nUnderneath that we have\nto go into Agent Details.\n\n182\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.550\nUnderneath that, Agent Health Status.\n\n183\n00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.080\nWe're drilling into this\nparticular dashboard.\n\n184\n00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.500\nHere we have a two-pane dashboard and\n\n185\n00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.040\nwe could see we have the agent's status\nfrom health service that we're monitoring.\n\n186\n00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.090\nAnd then the Agent State itself.\n\n187\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.340\nWe're gonna go to the right pane and\nchoose Agent State.\n\n188\n00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.948\nI've highlighted both agents.\n\n189\n00:07:34.948 --> 00:07:37.670\nPLABVMMBUILD and the DC1.\n\n190\n00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.710\nWhen I do that, I get the appropriate\nHealth Service Tasks over here.\n\n191\n00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.710\nAnd one of them, I'll put at the very top\njust about, is enable audit collection.\n\n192\n00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.834\nAnd then when I do this,\nthis will go out and\n\n193\n00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:51.730\nconfigure that service we just\nlooked at on that machine.\n\n194\n00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.930\nAnd set it up so\nthat it runs the right way.\n\n195\n00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.900\nAnd then once I've done that down here.\n\n196\n00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.270\nAnd I can't really scroll down cuz\nthat's the bottom of the screen.\n\n197\n00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.480\nBut I can then run\nthe Start Audit Collection task.\n\n198\n00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.907\nThat will then actually\nenable the collection,\n\n199\n00:08:05.907 --> 00:08:08.440\nallow the forwarder to\nstart gathering data.\n\n200\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.080\nSend it to the collector,\nallow the collector to process it, and\n\n201\n00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.260\nultimately send it into the database.\n\n202\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.050\nSo this is what we're talking\nabout when we set this up.\n\n203\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.170\nNow, the way we administer\nthis on a command line level,\n\n204\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.770\non an individual machine level\nis using the adt admin.exe tool.\n\n205\n00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.260\nThought I'd quickly show you about that.\n\n206\n00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.820\nLet me just go in here real quick and\nshow you one thing before we do that.\n\n207\n00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.940\nIf you need to know where to go to enable\nthe Audit Collection Services Forwarders,\n\n208\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.180\nwhich is what I just showed you how to do.\n\n209\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.770\nGot a little webpage here\nto help you to do that.\n\n210\n00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.584\nAt the bottom,\n\n211\n00:08:40.584 --> 00:08:44.545\nit's got links to all the other elements\nassociated with how to set up ACS.\n\n212\n00:08:44.545 --> 00:08:47.807\nIncluding which I often get asked about,\nhow to set it up for UNIX and\n\n213\n00:08:47.807 --> 00:08:50.795\nLinux gathering, and\nfiltering events from UNIX and Linux.\n\n214\n00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:54.155\nSo you have very detailed and\nvery good information there.\n\n215\n00:08:54.155 --> 00:08:57.465\nWe have a link to the Audit\nCollection Services ADT admin page.\n\n216\n00:08:57.465 --> 00:08:59.855\nWe just click here,\nwe can grab that real quick.\n\n217\n00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.730\nThis will allow us to understand\nhow to use the ADT admin tool.\n\n218\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.350\nGives us information on all\nof the syntax and switches.\n\n219\n00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.320\nShows us how to set this up, and ensure\nthat we understand how to administer,\n\n220\n00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.220\nalong with all the sub parameters here.\n\n221\n00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.980\nHas links back to all the other\ninformation we were taking a look at.\n\n222\n00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.170\nThe other thing that I thought\nwould just be helpful quickly.\n\n223\n00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.670\nWe haven't really looked\nunder the hood at SQL at all.\n\n224\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.330\nBut just to show you what\nSQL databases look like.\n\n225\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.460\nAnd you could see we haven't set\nup an ACS collector database.\n\n226\n00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.090\nBut you could see that we do have the\nother databases here from our installs.\n\n227\n00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.740\nWe do have our app controller database.\n\n228\n00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.070\nWe have our ops manager, ops manager\ndata warehouse database orchestrator,\n\n229\n00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.900\nour report server,\nour Virtual Machine manager.\n\n230\n00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.400\nAll the different databases from\nall the installs we've done.\n\n231\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.425\nAnd all of our different episodes where\nwe did all of our installs are all\n\n232\n00:09:49.425 --> 00:09:50.140\nsitting there.\n\n233\n00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.940\nWe can interact with them, of course, and\nwork with any of the ones we may need.\n\n234\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.810\nRun queries against them.\n\n235\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.700\nDo whatever we need.\n\n236\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.220\nThis is SQL 12, by the way.\n\n237\n00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.270\nWe're just in the Admin Studio,\ntaking a look.\n\n238\n00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.420\nAnd that's what it will look like\nunder the hood if we had to go in and\n\n239\n00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.090\nactually play around with one or\nmore of them.\n\n240\n00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:07.382\nSo just a little insight to ACS,\nthere are no reports loaded, by the way,\n\n241\n00:10:07.382 --> 00:10:08.570\nby default for ACS.\n\n242\n00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.200\nIf we wanna actually run ACS reports,\nwe have to upload them and\n\n243\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.510\nmake them available.\n\n244\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.305\nWe have to import them into\nSQL Reporting Services,\n\n245\n00:10:16.305 --> 00:10:18.410\nso report them into reporting server.\n\n246\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.140\nOr import them, I should say,\ninto reporting server.\n\n247\n00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.236\nIf we go back to my machine for\n\n248\n00:10:23.236 --> 00:10:26.230\njust a minute to show you the picture\nwe've been referencing here and there.\n\n249\n00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.292\nWe would have to import the reports\ninto the SSRS area here,\n\n250\n00:10:30.292 --> 00:10:33.030\nload them up, make them available.\n\n251\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.670\nWe do that from a command prompt.\n\n252\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.130\nWe can then run a command\norder to import them.\n\n253\n00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.360\nAnd then once we've done that,\nusing the upload audit reports command.\n\n254\n00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.400\nWe would then be able to go in and\naccess them and make them available.\n\n255\n00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.740\nThen we will be able to see them.\n\n256\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.010\nBut they're not loaded by default.\n\n257\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.750\nWe'd have to actually import them and make\nthem available as a separate step as well.\n\n258\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.300\nAgain, refer you back to some of\nthe steps that I called that quickly and\n\n259\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.950\nshowed on the web pages associated\nwith configuration of ACS.\n\n260\n00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.510\nWalks you through all the details\nincluding how to set up and\n\n261\n00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.860\nimport those reports.\n\n262\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.140\nSo it gives you just a full featured view\nof everything we're gonna do with ACS.\n\n263\n00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.160\n&gt;&gt; Wow, I'm flabbergasted you actually\ndid get us in under 30 minutes.\n\n264\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.960\nI don't know what to say.\n\n265\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.890\nThanks for watching everyone.\n\n266\n00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:13.830\nNo, we do thank you Adam.\n\n267\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.620\nWe are having a little fun\nhere at Adam's expense.\n\n268\n00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:22.910\nWe've gone from beginning to end,\nto creating this whole system.\n\n269\n00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.352\nIt's been a long, arduous journey.\n\n270\n00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:27.620\nThere are a lot of moving parts involved,\na lot of bits and\n\n271\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.550\npieces that you have to kinda\nget your mind wrapped around.\n\n272\n00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.718\nUnderstand how to use per se,\n\n273\n00:11:32.718 --> 00:11:37.070\nthat's why we have multiple\nparts to this part of the show.\n\n274\n00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.331\nBut once you get this\nfrom beginning to end,\n\n275\n00:11:40.331 --> 00:11:46.730\nyou'll definitely be able to create and\ndeploy an new SCOM management group.\n\n276\n00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.630\nAt least we hope,\nthat was our goal anyway.\n\n277\n00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.880\nSo if you don't understand something,\n\n278\n00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.000\nmake sure you rewatch over and over\nagain until you understand what it is.\n\n279\n00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.210\nObviously you can hit us up\nin our forums for anything.\n\n280\n00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.620\nIf you have any questions,\nwe can get those to Adam, or\n\n281\n00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.560\nif we can answer them ourselves,\nwe'll definitely do that.\n\n282\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.960\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; But Adam, we totally appreciate this.\n\n283\n00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.110\nThis is something that's very complex and\nyou have the knowledge.\n\n284\n00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.810\nWe were the learners,\nwe came to the fountain to drink today.\n\n285\n00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.150\nAnd we appreciate that\nquenching of the thirst.\n\n286\n00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.000\nThat being said,\nlooks like it is time for us.\n\n287\n00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.912\nIt's weird to cut an episode so short,\nbut that's what we're gonna do today,\n\n288\n00:12:18.912 --> 00:12:20.011\nit's time for us to sign off.\n\n289\n00:12:20.011 --> 00:12:22.564\n&gt;&gt; Cheers.\n&gt;&gt; Cheers, yes, yes, call it a day.\n\n290\n00:12:22.564 --> 00:12:23.751\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, drink to knowledge,\noutstanding.\n\n291\n00:12:23.751 --> 00:12:26.864\n&gt;&gt; To you good people, thanks for\nwatching, signing off for ITProTV,\n\n292\n00:12:26.864 --> 00:12:28.643\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n293\n00:12:28.643 --> 00:12:30.793\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon,\ncome back and join us soon.\n\n294\n00:12:30.793 --> 00:12:32.168\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n295\n00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:32.980\n&gt;&gt; Another episode.\n&gt;&gt; Bye.\n\n296\n00:12:32.980

Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.320\nAdam, glad to have you back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.910\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.010\n&gt;&gt; It is going well.\n\n13\n00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.898\nI am feeling like installing something.\n\n14\n00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:34.418\nWe've been talking about doing.\n\n15\n00:00:34.418 --> 00:00:37.442\nI'm actually feeling a hankering\nas they say in the deep south,\n\n16\n00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.590\nI have a hankering to install something,\nwhat should we install?\n\n17\n00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.617\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:41.617 --> 00:00:44.450\n&gt;&gt; We gave it away because we already\nset up on the third, but if you didn't\n\n19\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.350\nsee that or you're just tuning in,\nwhat do you think we should install?\n\n20\n00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.582\n&gt;&gt; I'm having a hankering for\nsome Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n21\n00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:52.244\nHow's that?\n\n22\n00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:57.845\n&gt;&gt; SCVMM, a little SCVMM, so we're gonna\ndo exactly that for you in this episode.\n\n23\n00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:01.220\nWe are going to, we threw all the names\nof the Microsoft products in the hat.\n\n24\n00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.110\nDaniel got to pick and he chose system\ncenter Virtual Machine Manager, so\n\n25\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.560\nwe are gonna deploy SCVMM for you.\n\n26\n00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.860\nShow you how that's done\nstart to finish as they say.\n\n27\n00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.970\nIf we can make with the magic,\nlet me see if I can get this right,\n\n28\n00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.820\nI gotta go this way and up, so I gotta.\n\n29\n00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.448\n&gt;&gt; To your right.\n\n30\n00:01:17.448 --> 00:01:20.528\n&gt;&gt; We are going to, awesome!\n\n31\n00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:21.428\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n32\n00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:25.337\n&gt;&gt; You are the best, we are gonna\nactually begin our demonstration by just\n\n33\n00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:28.680\ntalking about some of\nthe background pre-reqs real quick.\n\n34\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.640\nYeah, we do some of the background work\njust to make things run a little quicker.\n\n35\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.570\nWe've created,\nI've created two install accounts.\n\n36\n00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.830\nI'm gonna show you what those are and\nhow I did those real quick.\n\n37\n00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.340\nBut speaking of background work, you gotta\ndo and pre-reqs to make this run well.\n\n38\n00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.530\nThere is some software that\nwe have to have installed\n\n39\n00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.270\non the target box where we're\ngonna install the VMM product.\n\n40\n00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.926\nLet's just run through that for\nyou quickly.\n\n41\n00:01:48.926 --> 00:01:52.760\nYou should be running at least\nWindows Server 12 or better, 12,\n\n42\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.390\n12 R2 Server 16 as the underlying OS.\n\n43\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.660\nYou gotta have SQLServer 12 SP1 or\nbetter there.\n\n44\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.144\nSo SQL12 SP1, SQL 14, SQL 16, etc.\n\n45\n00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:09.820\nGotta have Microsoft .NET framework\nversion 4.5, so you gotta be running that.\n\n46\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.390\nAnd you need the Windows Assessment and\n\n47\n00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.030\nDeployment kit, the WADK,\nversion either for Windows 8.\n\n48\n00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.510\nExcuse me, or version for Windows 8.1 or\nthe newer newer version for Windows 10.\n\n49\n00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.360\nSo you need that.\n\n50\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.260\nWe're gonna fast forward and actually show\nyou how to install that as part of what\n\n51\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.640\nwe're doing here after we get the service\naccounts explained to you really quickly.\n\n52\n00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.410\nSo what I've done to install\nthe service accounts is the following.\n\n53\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.270\nI've gone in and\n\n54\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.200\nI have copied and you can do this\nin the real world if you choose to.\n\n55\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.830\nI have copied the admin account.\n\n56\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.530\nSo I went into the domain controller,\nopened up our domain.\n\n57\n00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.080\nYou'll see practicelabs.com right here.\n\n58\n00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.420\nWent ahead, just went to the users OU.\n\n59\n00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.250\nWent ahead and grabbed the admin account,\nright-click copy.\n\n60\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.240\nChose the admin account.\n\n61\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.480\nIn other words, as a template,\nhas all the rights necessary for\n\n62\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.560\nus to use to do the install.\n\n63\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.710\nBut created a separate instantiated\n\n64\n00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.130\nversion of that account that is\nseparate with its own password.\n\n65\n00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.810\nThat way, if we change the domain admin\npassword, we're not modifying the service\n\n66\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.720\naccount but we have all the properties\nnecessary to do the install.\n\n67\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.230\nThis is what I spoke about\nin the earlier episodes\n\n68\n00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.870\nwhen I talked about\nplanning to be successful.\n\n69\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.930\nSetting up the answers to the questions\nwho, what, where, why, and how.\n\n70\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.620\nWho is gonna be doing the install,\nwhat credentials do they have?\n\n71\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.150\nBut also what are those\nservice accounts we need and\n\n72\n00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.970\nhow are we gonna map those out,\nwhat rights do they need?\n\n73\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.960\nAnd so we've done that, we've created\nan account called VMM service account.\n\n74\n00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.720\nPretty obvious hopefully\nwhat that one does.\n\n75\n00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.210\nThat's gonna be our Virtual Machine\nManager service account for our install.\n\n76\n00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.540\nIn an upcoming demo, we're gonna be\ndoing an install and configuring and\n\n77\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.420\ndiscussing the app controller.\n\n78\n00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.850\nGot a service account set up for that,\njust so that we have that ready to go.\n\n79\n00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.030\nSo we have all of that there,\n\n80\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.730\nso what we're gonna do is flip\nover from our domain controller.\n\n81\n00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.490\nOver to our box where our Virtual Machine\nManager install is gonna take place.\n\n82\n00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.220\nI've already gone ahead and\njust spun up the Windows Assessment and\n\n83\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.340\nDeployment kit for Windows 8.1.\n\n84\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.940\nLoaded the software initially,\ngot the initial screen there, so\n\n85\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.810\nyou could see that running.\n\n86\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.830\nLet me just move this over\njust a wee bit over here, so\n\n87\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.860\nyou can see the full screen on that.\n\n88\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.770\nAnd what you'll see is that we\nspecify a location for the install.\n\n89\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.684\nWe'll just take the default install\nC:\\\\Program Files\\x86\\WindowsKits,\n\n90\n00:04:24.684 --> 00:04:27.270\nand then 8.1 and then the directory.\n\n91\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.550\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n92\n00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.710\nNeed about 6 GB of space approximately\nto get that up and running.\n\n93\n00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.870\nWe'll hit Next there.\n\n94\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.190\nWe're gonna decide whether or\n\n95\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.010\nnot we wanna join the customer\nexperience improvement program.\n\n96\n00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.570\nObviously, in the real world,\nyou may choose to opt into that.\n\n97\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.000\nFor our purposes of demonstration,\nwe'll say no, which is the default.\n\n98\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.220\nWe'll hit Next there.\n\n99\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.990\nThen we're gonna accept the end\nuser license agreement.\n\n100\n00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.110\nSo we'll hit Accept.\n\n101\n00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.690\n&gt;&gt; You made sure to read that, right?\n\n102\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.555\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I speed read.\n\n103\n00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:53.776\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I was able to scan\nthat entire thing like that without even\n\n104\n00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:55.796\nhaving to move, that's how quick I am.\n\n105\n00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.024\n&gt;&gt; You got the whole thing\nmemorized [CROSSTALK].\n\n106\n00:04:57.024 --> 00:04:57.696\n&gt;&gt; I do actually.\n\n107\n00:04:57.696 --> 00:04:58.998\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just I know it all, so\n\n108\n00:04:58.998 --> 00:04:59.815\nI don't even have to worry about it.\n\n109\n00:04:59.815 --> 00:05:04.682\nSo, on the select your features you wanna\ninstall screen here as you can see,\n\n110\n00:05:04.682 --> 00:05:09.322\nwe're gonna take off the SQL Server\n2012 Express item at the bottom.\n\n111\n00:05:09.322 --> 00:05:12.982\nThat's also gonna deselect\nthe Windows Assessment Services,\n\n112\n00:05:12.982 --> 00:05:15.512\nwe don't need those for\nthe purposes of our demonstration.\n\n113\n00:05:15.512 --> 00:05:19.412\nWe're running a SQL Server system already,\nso we've got that up and running,\n\n114\n00:05:19.412 --> 00:05:22.502\nwe're not gonna do the express,\nwhich is the all in one install.\n\n115\n00:05:22.502 --> 00:05:25.422\nWe're gonna be able to use that\nseparately if necessary, so\n\n116\n00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:27.590\nwe're gonna just go ahead and\nlet that run.\n\n117\n00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.570\nSo we're gonna do install here,\n\n118\n00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.080\nthat drops the estimated down to\nabout 3.2 gigs of estimated space.\n\n119\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.270\nWe're gonna let that run for\njust a minute using our time wisely,\n\n120\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.339\nwe're gonna come back and we're gonna take\na look at that as soon as it finishes up.\n\n121\n00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.179\nThen we're gonna pick up\nthe install right from here.\n\n122\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.600\nAll right, so now that we've finished\nthe install of the Windows Assessment and\n\n123\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.450\nDeployment Kit.\n\n124\n00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.945\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe'll just close that,\n\n125\n00:05:49.945 --> 00:05:51.443\nwe're not gonna bother\nlaunching it right now.\n\n126\n00:05:51.443 --> 00:05:53.416\nJust wanna make sure it's\ninstalled ready to go.\n\n127\n00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:58.155\nWhat we're gonna do next is open up our\nFile Explorer and what I've done is I've\n\n128\n00:05:58.155 --> 00:06:01.990\nactually just gone ahead and\nloaded up the SCVMM install media.\n\n129\n00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.110\nSo you would download the iso,\nburn it, have it available.\n\n130\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.090\nSo you open that up,\nwe're gonna right-click on the setup.\n\n131\n00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.140\nJust make sure we run as administrator,\nwanna make sure we get that installed\n\n132\n00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.980\nthe right way the first time\nwithout having any issues.\n\n133\n00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.360\nYou'll see there SCVMM 2012 R2,\nVirtual Machine Manager.\n\n134\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.810\nWe've got the Install option,\nwe're gonna click that, get that going.\n\n135\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.820\nSo let's just go ahead and\nget that up and running.\n\n136\n00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.080\nWe're gonna go ahead and select\nthe features we're gonna wanna install.\n\n137\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.010\nWe'll give that a second just to spin up.\n\n138\n00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.070\nAnd once that just loads,\nquickly does a little preload.\n\n139\n00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.150\nPuts itself in memory checks to make\nsure that we have the right version,\n\n140\n00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.140\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n141\n00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.150\nAre we on the right version of the OS.\n\n142\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.990\nAll those background pre-req\nchecks that we talked about.\n\n143\n00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.860\nOnce that comes up,\n\n144\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.450\nthen what'll we do is we get our\nSelect features to install window.\n\n145\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.620\nJust move up here a smidge, so\nwe can just kind of see that.\n\n146\n00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.510\nYou'll see we have\nthe Setup bar at the top.\n\n147\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.910\nWe're gonna go through, we obviously are\ngonna build out those blue items as we go.\n\n148\n00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.870\nSelect features to install, notice we\nhave the VMM Server and the VMM Console.\n\n149\n00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.010\nSo we're gonna want to do both here.\n\n150\n00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.470\nChoose the VMM Server and\nnotice once we do that,\n\n151\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.330\nit automatically selects the console.\n\n152\n00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.420\nBecause we don't have\na server already installed,\n\n153\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.470\nwe can't install the console separately.\n\n154\n00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.060\nGotta be able to do both together,\nso we're gonna do that.\n\n155\n00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.420\nIf we don't know what\nthe requirements are,\n\n156\n00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.510\nit does tell us what they are right there.\n\n157\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.450\nWe ran through them already,\ntold you what they were.\n\n158\n00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.350\nWe can click View all install\nrequirements gives us a list,\n\n159\n00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.580\ntells us what we need to make sure\nwe have all the requirements.\n\n160\n00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.190\nSame thing for the VMM console there.\n\n161\n00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.300\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, no installing\nthe server without the console at all.\n\n162\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.046\nOr at least that's what it seems to be\ncuz it grays out the ability to uncheck.\n\n163\n00:07:35.046 --> 00:07:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Right, you need both.\n\n164\n00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.867\nYeah, you need that in order to do that\ncuz you have to be able to manage it.\n\n165\n00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:41.280\nYou got to have the console available\nto be able manage it absolutely.\n\n166\n00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.040\nSo we're gonna click Next.\n\n167\n00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.555\nWe do our product registration,\nthis is our standard, who are you?\n\n168\n00:07:46.555 --> 00:07:48.043\nWho do you work for, product key.\n\n169\n00:07:48.043 --> 00:07:51.427\nYou'll have an option to opt to out of\nthe product key if you're gonna install\n\n170\n00:07:51.427 --> 00:07:53.936\nthis in demo or\ninstall mode where you wanna just test it.\n\n171\n00:07:53.936 --> 00:07:56.725\nRemember, you get that 180 day\ntrial we were talking about.\n\n172\n00:07:56.725 --> 00:07:58.134\nSo we're gonna be able to do that.\n\n173\n00:07:58.134 --> 00:08:01.069\nSo we're just gonna leave\nit as Windows user,\n\n174\n00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:04.060\nand I'll just do plb, for practice labs.\n\n175\n00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.780\nWindows user, we could go ahead,\nI'll put in adam.\n\n176\n00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.500\nWe could put in, let's do itprotv.\n\n177\n00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.120\nRight, so itprotv.\n\n178\n00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.590\nAnd now,\nwe'll just leave the product key blank.\n\n179\n00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.330\nWe'll do the eval edition,\ngot our EULA, so\n\n180\n00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.550\nwe'll accept the end\nuser license agreement.\n\n181\n00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.113\nClick that out, you can print that\nout by the way if you need to.\n\n182\n00:08:24.113 --> 00:08:27.201\nIf you just are in the mood to have\nthat documented, or you need that or\n\n183\n00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:30.110\nyou just got a bunch of paper\nyou're doing nothing with.\n\n184\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.910\nCould always do that as well.\n\n185\n00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.370\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna skip the practice lab.\n\n186\n00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.470\nOr excuse me, skip the licensing item for\nthis practice.\n\n187\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.740\nWe're gonna skip the CEIP.\n\n188\n00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.660\nWe're not gonna bother to opt in for that.\n\n189\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.570\nBut again, in the real world,\nwill be important for you to opt in and\n\n190\n00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.420\nmake sure you're familiar with the fact\nthat Microsoft needs that feedback, right.\n\n191\n00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.230\nSo wanna make sure we're aware\nof the fact we can help them out\n\n192\n00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.820\nby developing better products.\n\n193\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.209\nClick Next.\nWe're gonna do Microsoft Update to keep\n\n194\n00:08:53.209 --> 00:08:54.010\nup to date.\n\n195\n00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.000\nIn the real world, absolutely,\nin the demo environment here,\n\n196\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.680\nwe're doing just set-up and show you.\n\n197\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.520\nWe're not gonna bother with that because\nwe're not gonna be connecting out and\n\n198\n00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.960\ntrying to download updates.\n\n199\n00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.126\nBut in the real world very important.\n\n200\n00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:05.811\nNotice recommended, right?\n\n201\n00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:08.340\nYou wanna do that, let's click Next there.\n\n202\n00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.630\nInstall location,\ngotta make sure we have enough free space.\n\n203\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.890\nTake note of that install directory.\n\n204\n00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.430\nIt's gonna be C program files\nMicrosoft System Center\n\n205\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.390\n2012 R2 with spaces all the way through.\n\n206\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.320\nVirtual Machine Manager will\naccept that default, no big deal.\n\n207\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.950\nWe'll click Next, checks the pre-req\nwarnings or rather checks the pre-reqs for\n\n208\n00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.940\nus, gives us a warning, which we're gonna\nignore for purposes of our install.\n\n209\n00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.470\nBut just let me tell you what it is.\n\n210\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.000\nSo you'll see here,\nsequel command line utilities check.\n\n211\n00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.990\nIt says, hey, Command Line Utilities\nare not installed on this computer.\n\n212\n00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.380\nThat's okay,\nwe're using SQL somewhere else, so\n\n213\n00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.120\nwe don't have to worry\nabout that necessarily.\n\n214\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.475\nSo it's a warning,\nit's not a deal-breaker.\n\n215\n00:09:43.475 --> 00:09:47.530\nIt's just telling us that it's something\nwe may want to make sure we deal with.\n\n216\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.660\nSo we know that and we can take\ncare of that later, no big deal.\n\n217\n00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.250\nWe'll click Next,\nthen we have our database configuration.\n\n218\n00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.680\nSo now we've gotta go ahead and\nwe've gotta make sure that we specify\n\n219\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.930\nthe information for\nwhere we're gonna connect to.\n\n220\n00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.462\nNow, we can do server name here and\nor we could do IP address.\n\n221\n00:10:04.462 --> 00:10:06.453\nWe're gonna do an IP address,\n\n222\n00:10:06.453 --> 00:10:11.287\nwe're gonna type in the IP of the machine\nthat is gonna host our SQL Server.\n\n223\n00:10:11.287 --> 00:10:15.081\n192.168.0.2 is what we're\ngonna put in there.\n\n224\n00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:19.505\nThe tab, let's just hit the tab key real\nquick, it's checking the server down here,\n\n225\n00:10:19.505 --> 00:10:24.110\ncommunicating with the server, making sure\nit could hit that IP, that it's available,\n\n226\n00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.152\nthat it's online.\n\n227\n00:10:25.152 --> 00:10:26.625\nSo we're gonna wait for that.\n\n228\n00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.657\nDoesn't take very long.\n\n229\n00:10:28.657 --> 00:10:30.460\nIt usually takes a few seconds.\n\n230\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.300\nComes back.\n\n231\n00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.710\nTells us that it is online,\nit's available.\n\n232\n00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.850\nFinds the instance name, MS SQL Server.\n\n233\n00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.200\nFinds the ability for us.\n\n234\n00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.717\nAnd then say, okay.\n\n235\n00:10:38.717 --> 00:10:39.765\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n236\n00:10:39.765 --> 00:10:41.073\nCreate a new database, etc.\n\n237\n00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:44.477\nBut one thing you gotta take note of,\nit does not populate the port for us here,\n\n238\n00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:45.416\nwe gotta put that in.\n\n239\n00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:47.635\nStandard port for SQL would be?\n\n240\n00:10:47.635 --> 00:10:48.840\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea.\n\n241\n00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.770\nI'm not a SQL admin, never have been.\n\n242\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.440\n&gt;&gt; Any idea what it may be?\n\n243\n00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.007\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n244\n00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:54.741\nNo idea, no.\n\n245\n00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:55.284\n&gt;&gt; I can't see.\n\n246\n00:10:55.284 --> 00:10:56.585\n&gt;&gt; I'm like giving him the answer.\n\n247\n00:10:56.585 --> 00:10:57.746\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's pointing to something.\n\n248\n00:10:57.746 --> 00:10:58.419\n&gt;&gt; What are you talking about?\n\n249\n00:10:58.419 --> 00:10:59.524\nI can't see what's on there.\n\n250\n00:10:59.524 --> 00:11:04.355\n1433 the standard port for SQL,\nso we're gonna put that in.\n\n251\n00:11:04.355 --> 00:11:06.155\nSo we're gonna specify that port.\n\n252\n00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:09.380\nNow, you may modify that\nport that will be up to you.\n\n253\n00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.630\nBut the recommendation is\nleave the standard port there.\n\n254\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.190\nSo, 1433, we have to specify\nthe credential we're gonna use to connect.\n\n255\n00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.670\nSo, we're gonna check off the box,\nwhat credential we're gonna use.\n\n256\n00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:25.490\nWe're gonna go ahead and put in our domain\nname, and our administrator credentials.\n\n257\n00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.020\nSo, Practice Labs, Administrator,\nor whatever user account\n\n258\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.040\nyou're gonna be using, Administrator,\nso we're gonna do that.\n\n259\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.300\nSo we've got that there.\n\n260\n00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.070\nWe'll put in our password, so we're gonna\nmake sure that we put our password in,\n\n261\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.530\nsuper secret password that we're using.\n\n262\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.300\nPassword with a capital P, right.\n\n263\n00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.380\nSo we're gonna do that,\nwe have our instance name MS SQL.\n\n264\n00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.040\nThen select either an existing or new\ndatabase, new database virtual machine.\n\n265\n00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.480\nA manager or\nvirtual manager rather DB is filled in.\n\n266\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.620\nThat is the default name.\n\n267\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.480\nLeave that alone, don't mess with that.\n\n268\n00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.420\nSet the default, you'll be a lot happier.\n\n269\n00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.880\nThat's what we expect to see.\n\n270\n00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.070\nIt'll be easier when you\nread the documentation and\n\n271\n00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.945\neverything works well\nwhen you keep it there.\n\n272\n00:12:06.945 --> 00:12:08.715\nSo we've got all that programmed in.\n\n273\n00:12:08.715 --> 00:12:10.065\nLet's just go full screen for half a sec.\n\n274\n00:12:10.065 --> 00:12:11.945\nJust to make sure everybody can see that,\nreal quick.\n\n275\n00:12:11.945 --> 00:12:13.565\nYou see everything we were just doing.\n\n276\n00:12:13.565 --> 00:12:14.125\nThere's the IP.\n\n277\n00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:15.695\nThere's the port number.\n\n278\n00:12:15.695 --> 00:12:19.072\nWe checked that off,\nprovided our credential, our password.\n\n279\n00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:22.782\nHave the default instance already there\nbecause we connect it to the machine,\n\n280\n00:12:22.782 --> 00:12:27.892\nwas out connecting to the SQL server,\nMS SQL server, the default instance, and\n\n281\n00:12:27.892 --> 00:12:31.992\nthen the new database virtual manager,\nDB is the default name.\n\n282\n00:12:31.992 --> 00:12:32.892\nWe're gonna accept that.\n\n283\n00:12:32.892 --> 00:12:34.512\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n284\n00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.690\nGive that just a second.\n\n285\n00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.550\nTakes a minute or so approximately.\n\n286\n00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:44.000\nIt's going out and verifying again with\nthe SQL Server that everything is good.\n\n287\n00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.555\nThat we actually have rights with\nthat credential on that port\n\n288\n00:12:47.555 --> 00:12:48.475\nto be able to communicate.\n\n289\n00:12:48.475 --> 00:12:50.205\nThis does another check real quick.\n\n290\n00:12:50.205 --> 00:12:53.715\nThen we have to configure the service\naccount and distribute a key management\n\n291\n00:12:53.715 --> 00:12:56.125\nthat we're gonna do here for\nthe Active Directory account.\n\n292\n00:12:56.125 --> 00:12:58.895\nWe're gonna use\nVirtual Machine Manager Service Account.\n\n293\n00:12:58.895 --> 00:13:02.385\nWe're gonna go ahead and use the account\nwe created on the domain controller,\n\n294\n00:13:02.385 --> 00:13:03.985\nthe VMM Service Account that I created.\n\n295\n00:13:03.985 --> 00:13:07.065\nWe're gonna specify that here, so\nwe're gonna do domain account,\n\n296\n00:13:07.065 --> 00:13:09.555\nwe're gonna specify user name and domain.\n\n297\n00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:11.830\nSo we're gonna do it in\nthe form of domain/user name.\n\n298\n00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.540\nEven though it's kind of\nbackwards the way they say it,\n\n299\n00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.020\nbut you know what we're gonna do, right?\n\n300\n00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.220\nThe way we always do.\n\n301\n00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.730\nSo we'll do our practice labs domain,\nVMMSRV.\n\n302\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.255\nThat's what I named the VMM virtual\nmachine manager service account.\n\n303\n00:13:24.255 --> 00:13:26.383\nWe'll do our password here.\n\n304\n00:13:26.383 --> 00:13:28.846\nAgain, super secret password.\n\n305\n00:13:28.846 --> 00:13:31.466\n&gt;&gt; Like Mel Brooks' character\non Spaceballs was 1, 2,\n\n306\n00:13:31.466 --> 00:13:33.767\n3, 4,\n5 was his luggage combination [LAUGH].\n\n307\n00:13:33.767 --> 00:13:35.764\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, yeah, exactly.\n\n308\n00:13:35.764 --> 00:13:39.760\nSo we're gonna do that and\nthen we're going to go ahead.\n\n309\n00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.420\nWe're not gonna bother with\ndistributed key management here.\n\n310\n00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.940\nWe're gonna just leave it alone and\n\n311\n00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.630\nnot check off store the keys\nin the Active Directory.\n\n312\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.223\nBut we could store them\nin the AD if necessary.\n\n313\n00:13:49.223 --> 00:13:53.351\nWhether we wanna have the encryption key\nstored in AD instead of on the local\n\n314\n00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:54.270\nmachine.\n\n315\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.300\nIf we're gonna do highly\navailable VMM installs.\n\n316\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.820\nWhere we're gonna make sure we have\nsurvivability if we lose the system.\n\n317\n00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.912\nWe need the keys in the AD to be able\nto be able to distribute them and\n\n318\n00:14:03.912 --> 00:14:05.283\nessentially recover them.\n\n319\n00:14:05.283 --> 00:14:07.791\nWe're gonna just simply\ninstall on this machine and\n\n320\n00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:09.449\nhopefully not screw anything up.\n\n321\n00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:12.903\n[CROSSTALK] It'll just get wiped out,\nwho knows, but\n\n322\n00:14:12.903 --> 00:14:16.301\nwe're gonna install and\nstore those keys locally.\n\n323\n00:14:16.301 --> 00:14:17.750\nWe're gonna accept that as the default.\n\n324\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.590\nThat makes the install\ngo a little quicker.\n\n325\n00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.120\nIt's a little bit easier for\nus to demo with, but\n\n326\n00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.930\nif we were gonna put it into the AD,\nyou'll see here we need the location,\n\n327\n00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.960\nwhat's the domain, what's the OU, where\nare we gonna put it, that kind of thing.\n\n328\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.765\nSo we'll specify that, click Next.\n\n329\n00:14:33.765 --> 00:14:38.705\nThe ports that are configured by default\nfor installation are gonna be there.\n\n330\n00:14:38.705 --> 00:14:43.465\nWe're just gonna simply accept them, but\nyou'll see 8100 for the VMM console, 5985,\n\n331\n00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:48.265\nthe agent on the hosting library's server.\n\n332\n00:14:48.265 --> 00:14:49.405\nAnd you can walk down the list here and\n\n333\n00:14:49.405 --> 00:14:51.415\nsee all the various ports\nthat are necessary.\n\n334\n00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:53.390\nSo we're gonna leave all those in place.\n\n335\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.660\nClick Next.\n\n336\n00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.265\nWe then have our library configuration.\n\n337\n00:14:56.265 --> 00:15:00.270\nWhere we are going to be\ncreating our library share?\n\n338\n00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.835\nThis is where we're gonna be storing\nall of our files, so our VMM files\n\n339\n00:15:03.835 --> 00:15:07.535\nthat are gonna be used to be able to\nUltimately create virtual machines.\n\n340\n00:15:07.535 --> 00:15:11.835\nRemember the VM Manager, so essentially\nour front end, think of vCenter,\n\n341\n00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:12.855\nthink of Zen.\n\n342\n00:15:12.855 --> 00:15:16.565\nThese are the front ends that are being\nused to manage virtual infrastructure\n\n343\n00:15:16.565 --> 00:15:17.885\nin competitive platforms.\n\n344\n00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:19.565\nThat's what VMM is for us.\n\n345\n00:15:19.565 --> 00:15:21.735\nSo we're installing that, setting that up.\n\n346\n00:15:21.735 --> 00:15:24.365\nWe all ready had VMM set up and running.\n\n347\n00:15:24.365 --> 00:15:28.015\nWe had a VMM library share,\nwe'll be able to use an existing one.\n\n348\n00:15:28.015 --> 00:15:31.740\nWe're gonna simply set\nthe default MSSCVMM,\n\n349\n00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.710\nso Microsoft Systems Center\nVirtual Machine Manager.\n\n350\n00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.410\nLibrary is the name of the share.\n\n351\n00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.830\nWe'll accept that default.\n\n352\n00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.840\nThe default location program data,\nVirtual Machine Manager Library Files.\n\n353\n00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.013\nNotice we do have the option to change\nthat if necessary we can always move\n\n354\n00:15:45.013 --> 00:15:45.645\nthat around.\n\n355\n00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:49.566\nAnd the description is just the VMM\nLibrary share, but we can, of course,\n\n356\n00:15:49.566 --> 00:15:51.008\nmodify that if necessary.\n\n357\n00:15:51.008 --> 00:15:54.373\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nget the install running.\n\n358\n00:15:54.373 --> 00:15:56.079\nGonna do that here in just a second.\n\n359\n00:15:56.079 --> 00:16:00.480\nLet me just click Next, almost done,\nwe just have our install summary.\n\n360\n00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.400\nThis gives us a list of\neverything we're gonna do.\n\n361\n00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.120\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Install.\n\n362\n00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.453\nThis is gonna go through\ndo our deployment for us.\n\n363\n00:16:08.453 --> 00:16:10.805\nWe're gonna watch that go\nthrough the deployment,\n\n364\n00:16:10.805 --> 00:16:12.738\nyou'll see it's not gonna take too long.\n\n365\n00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:15.812\nMicrosoft SQL Server objects\nare being added there.\n\n366\n00:16:15.812 --> 00:16:19.625\nWe're gonna walk through do the management\nserver eventually do the console.\n\n367\n00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:22.729\nOnce that's done finishing the install,\nwe're not gonna watch the whole thing,\n\n368\n00:16:22.729 --> 00:16:24.246\nwe'll just let it kick off for a minute.\n\n369\n00:16:24.246 --> 00:16:27.317\nBut once it's done we'll come on back and\nthen we'll take a look to make\n\n370\n00:16:27.317 --> 00:16:30.199\nsure it was successfully installed\nto wrap up our demonstration.\n\n371\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.530\nAll right, so you can see that\nwe are done with installation.\n\n372\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.030\nWhat we're gonna just point\nout here real quick for\n\n373\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.420\nyou now that we finished the install.\n\n374\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.590\nWe got the management server,\nwe got the VMM cons,\n\n375\n00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.110\nwe got the little green circle,\nwhite check saying good job.\n\n376\n00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.740\nYou actually did it the right way.\n\n377\n00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.730\nThat's not really what it says.\n\n378\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:46.262\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n379\n00:16:46.262 --> 00:16:48.784\nI'm just imaging that if I was talking\nto it, that's what it would say.\n\n380\n00:16:48.784 --> 00:16:50.068\nBut what's important is down here.\n\n381\n00:16:50.068 --> 00:16:53.190\nWe go full screen for just half a second\nso you could see this a little bit better.\n\n382\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.980\nThese check boxes down here, just take\nnote of this but just scroll down here so\n\n383\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.230\nyou can see it, check for\nthe lasted VM updates.\n\n384\n00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.410\nObviously, you leave that checked,\n\n385\n00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.140\nit's gonna go out on the web,\npull down whatever updates may exist.\n\n386\n00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.500\nGood to do that in the real world.\n\n387\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.980\nWe're not gonna bother with that here\ncuz we're just trying to stand it up for\n\n388\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.920\nyou just to make sure you can see it work.\n\n389\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.360\nOpen the VMM console\nafter the wizard closes.\n\n390\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.790\nYou could do that, we do have a little\nshortcut sitting on the desktop\n\n391\n00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.600\nthat is created as part of the install.\n\n392\n00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.710\nWe just go load the console\nright from there, as well.\n\n393\n00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.490\nSo, it's up to us to decide what to do.\n\n394\n00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.190\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nuncheck both of those.\n\n395\n00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.780\nWe'll launch the console from over there,\njust to close here.\n\n396\n00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:33.420\nWe're just gonna get rid of our media,\nhit close on that, minimize that.\n\n397\n00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.480\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\nlaunch the console.\n\n398\n00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.329\nNow do keep in mind, we'll just lost this\nup real quick, just so you can see it.\n\n399\n00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.060\nWe are going to need to do a restart here,\nbefore we can do another install.\n\n400\n00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.980\nOur next step is going to be installing,\nconfiguring the app controller.\n\n401\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.200\nWe're going to do a restart on this,\ngoing out of the demo,\n\n402\n00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.835\nas soon as we're wrapping up here\nin a minute, just to prep for that,\n\n403\n00:17:52.835 --> 00:17:55.695\neven though you'll see us pick\nthat up in the next episode.\n\n404\n00:17:55.695 --> 00:17:57.965\nBut in the real world,\nif you're doing this in sequence,\n\n405\n00:17:57.965 --> 00:17:59.725\nyou're putting them both on the same box.\n\n406\n00:17:59.725 --> 00:18:01.375\nAnything you install after VMM,\n\n407\n00:18:01.375 --> 00:18:04.006\nyou gotta do restart on VMM in\norder to do the next install.\n\n408\n00:18:04.006 --> 00:18:07.212\nSo if you don't, you just get in there and\nyou get like halfway through the install\n\n409\n00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:09.652\nand it's like, wait a second,\nyou got a restart pending.\n\n410\n00:18:09.652 --> 00:18:12.152\nYou wanna go ahead and\ndo that before we do anything else.\n\n411\n00:18:12.152 --> 00:18:14.602\nThat's after you type all the information,\nwhich really sucks.\n\n412\n00:18:14.602 --> 00:18:16.569\nSo, you wanna make sure\nyou know about that.\n\n413\n00:18:16.569 --> 00:18:19.519\nIn addition, in the real world,\njust so you now,\n\n414\n00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:23.120\nthe VMM service has a nasty habit\nof not starting on restart.\n\n415\n00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.239\nEven though it's supposed\nto start automatically,\n\n416\n00:18:25.239 --> 00:18:27.791\nit has a nasty habit of hanging or\ndoing the delayed start thing.\n\n417\n00:18:27.791 --> 00:18:30.861\nBut it's really delayed, like yeah,\nsit down I'm not starting.\n\n418\n00:18:30.861 --> 00:18:34.331\nSo you just got to go in, and if you\nstart the console, doesn't boot up or\n\n419\n00:18:34.331 --> 00:18:35.851\nrather the console doesn't connect,\n\n420\n00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:39.000\nit's probably nothing more than\na service error, see this happen a lot.\n\n421\n00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.670\nJust go into the services, kick that\nservice over make sure it's running,\n\n422\n00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.530\ntry the console again comes right\nup like that with no trouble.\n\n423\n00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.180\nBut just so you know because that\ndoes happen in the real world and\n\n424\n00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.620\nthat can catch you if you're\nnot paying attention.\n\n425\n00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.170\nWe'll just go ahead and\n\n426\n00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:55.060\nwe'll connect through a quick using the\ndefault credentials that are already used\n\n427\n00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.920\nor the current credentials\nthat we're logged on under.\n\n428\n00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.150\nYou'll see the console spins up here,\n\n429\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.160\ntakes just a minute to\ncome up the first time.\n\n430\n00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.220\nSo we'll give it a moment.\n\n431\n00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.870\nYou do not need to restart to get the\nconsole running once you do the install.\n\n432\n00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:09.180\nBut you do wanna restart after we do\nthis to make sure we're ready for\n\n433\n00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.970\nthe next install just so you know.\n\n434\n00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.820\nThis is normal behavior by the way.\n\n435\n00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.640\nJust take a moment or\n\n436\n00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.670\ntwo, first time we're doing this,\nto actually get it to go out and connect.\n\n437\n00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.420\nSo don't be worried about that,\nthat is normal, that is also on purpose.\n\n438\n00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.810\nMicrosoft advertises by keeping their\nproduct name up on the screen for\n\n439\n00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:25.890\njust a minute or so.\n\n440\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.490\nBut you can see once we do connect in\nthe first time, console is up and running.\n\n441\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:33.310\nWe got SCVMM configuration,\nwe're gonna have to go through and\n\n442\n00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.450\ndo that at some point.\n\n443\n00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:35.600\nBut we have the basics there.\n\n444\n00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.450\nIf you haven't seen SCVMM before,\nthis is what the console looks like.\n\n445\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.370\nWe've got other courses where you\ncan come through take a look.\n\n446\n00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:44.390\nWe go through and do a deep dive on this.\n\n447\n00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:50.865\nThe MCSE for Microsoft cloud credential\nmade up of 7246, 7247 two examples.\n\n448\n00:19:50.865 --> 00:19:53.705\nWe do a deep dive on this product\nin particular and go through all\n\n449\n00:19:53.705 --> 00:19:56.615\nthe little nooks and crannies about how\nto set this up and configure everything.\n\n450\n00:19:56.615 --> 00:19:59.295\nSo, it'd be good for\nyou to take a look at that at some point.\n\n451\n00:19:59.295 --> 00:20:03.255\nBut once we have this up and running more\nor less, the purpose of our demonstration.\n\n452\n00:20:03.255 --> 00:20:05.545\nWe're just going to go ahead and\nclose the console, so\n\n453\n00:20:05.545 --> 00:20:06.515\nlet me just do that real quick.\n\n454\n00:20:06.515 --> 00:20:11.455\nWe're just going to go ahead and we're\ngoing to proactively restart our machine.\n\n455\n00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:17.360\nSo, we're going to come in here I'm\ngonna do our restart and hit Continue.\n\n456\n00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.130\nThat's gonna go down, come back up, and\n\n457\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.730\nthen we'll be ready to go with\nour next installation demo,\n\n458\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.260\nwhich will be installing and\nconfiguring the app controller.\n\n459\n00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.710\nAnd we'll see you back for that.\n\n460\n00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.050\nAnd please, do come back and join us,\n\n461\n00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.210\nthat's gonna be number two in I think\nour five part series on the installs.\n\n462\n00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:31.780\nRight, we've got five?\n\n463\n00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've got\n&gt;&gt; We'd walk him through everything.\n\n464\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.150\n&gt;&gt; Quite a few of them.\n\n465\n00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.250\nIt's gotta be a lot of fun.\n\n466\n00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.570\nThis was not too difficult,\nvery simple, straight forward.\n\n467\n00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.740\nThat's what I do love\nabout Microsoft products.\n\n468\n00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.610\nThey don't make their installation very\nout of the realm possibilities for your\n\n469\n00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.840\naverage admin out there, it's very walk\nyou through this, here's the next steps.\n\n470\n00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.350\nKeep it simple, right,\nand that's what I like.\n\n471\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.800\nAnd Adam, you walked us through that\nvery well, we thank you for that.\n\n472\n00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.490\nAnd do join us back in, we're gonna\nbe doing some more demonstrations so\n\n473\n00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.660\nstay tuned for that.\n\n474\n00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.380\nThat's for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n475\n00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.790\nFor ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n476\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:03.777\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n477\n00:21:03.777 --> 00:21:06.669\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n478\n00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:12.381\n[MUSIC]\n\n479\n00:21:12.381 --> 00:21:15.494\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.610\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.270\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.084\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.084 --> 00:00:16.450\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.180\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.581\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n9\n00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:23.857\nwe are back with more on our data center\nmonitoring with Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.925\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio,\nwho else would it be than none other,\n\n11\n00:00:27.925 --> 00:00:29.180\nthan Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.380\nAdam, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.550\n&gt;&gt; Going really well, going really well.\n\n14\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.600\nHopefully, it's going really well for\nyou also.\n\n15\n00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.730\nWe're gonna continue our discussion/demos,\n\n16\n00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.460\ninstalling various aspects\nof the System Center Suite.\n\n17\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.350\nWe're going to be installing and\n\n18\n00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.870\nconfiguring the app\ncontroller server piece.\n\n19\n00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.030\nWe're gonna take you through that,\nsee how that works.\n\n20\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.030\nJust to remind you, the last episode,\nin case you haven't seen it,\n\n21\n00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.592\nprobably a good idea to walk\nthrough these sequentially.\n\n22\n00:00:52.592 --> 00:00:54.529\nWe configured the SCVMM product, so\n\n23\n00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:57.720\nwe installed\nSystem Center Virtual Machine manager.\n\n24\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.300\nWe finished up that install with a restart\n\n25\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.950\nof the VMM server to enable us\nto then continue where we are,\n\n26\n00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.970\nwe'll go there in just a second to\ninstall the app controller piece.\n\n27\n00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.260\nWe're installing it on the VMM VMM server,\nbut\n\n28\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.650\nwe talked about the fact we need that\nrestart at the end of the VMM install\n\n29\n00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.410\nin order to set the system, make sure that\nwe can do the app controller install.\n\n30\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.730\nIf you don't do that, what you find is,\nyou get about third or so,\n\n31\n00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.250\nmaybe halfway through the app controller\ninstall and it stops and says hey,\n\n32\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.110\nby the way, you have a pending restart and\nwe need to get that done before you can\n\n33\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.802\nactually do the install and it wipe\nset all the information you typed in.\n\n34\n00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:34.041\nYou gotta restart and\nstart and start over again.\n\n35\n00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:36.769\nSo just reminding you of that\nas we get started here so\n\n36\n00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:39.820\nyou don't get caught by\nthat in the real world.\n\n37\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.580\nIn addition I did also remind you of the\nlast episode that VMM has a strange habit\n\n38\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.468\nof not only starting the service to load\nthe console properly it usually works.\n\n39\n00:01:49.468 --> 00:01:52.861\nI don't wanna give you the case for the\nother sense that will not work correctly.\n\n40\n00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:57.371\nBut, we do see sometimes in the real\nworld, that the VMM service will, even\n\n41\n00:01:57.371 --> 00:02:02.730\nthough it's set to auto-start, will go to\ndelayed start and not start up properly.\n\n42\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.740\nSo if you have a problem\nloading the console,\n\n43\n00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.260\njust make sure you go check\nthat service on the box.\n\n44\n00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.850\nIt's usually nothing more than that.\n\n45\n00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.650\nIf you start the service up,\nyou'll find the console loads right away.\n\n46\n00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.320\nSo just a few little\nminor things to consider,\n\n47\n00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.260\njust be aware of real world\nscenarios/issues you wanna address.\n\n48\n00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.185\nAnd that way you're not stuck\nhaving to scratch your head.\n\n49\n00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:22.905\nAdd and you'll think about hey,\nwhat's going on with that,\n\n50\n00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:25.465\nhow did not or did happen or\nnot happen the right way.\n\n51\n00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:29.045\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead, we're\ngonna go in and take a look at how to do\n\n52\n00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:32.655\nthe app controller install, what you're\ngonna see up there, I've just gone ahead\n\n53\n00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:36.565\nand loaded the app controller media,\nso we just started that up.\n\n54\n00:02:36.565 --> 00:02:40.340\nWe've got our set up file right\nthere we're gonna right click to\n\n55\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.170\nrun as Administrator,\nas you're used to seeing me do.\n\n56\n00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.630\nJust reminding you of that so we know.\n\n57\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.029\nOn the system center,\n\n58\n00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:51.030\n2012 app controller install interface,\nyou'll notice we do Install.\n\n59\n00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.170\nBut you'll notice we\nhave a check box here.\n\n60\n00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.727\nAnd what we're gonna see is that this\nsays use Microsoft update to go out and\n\n61\n00:02:56.727 --> 00:02:58.544\ncheck for updates to app controller.\n\n62\n00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:03.560\nThis is important I know we talked about\nin the VMM install that there is a check\n\n63\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.419\nbox it occurs at the end of VM's install\ncycle as we finish up on the complete\n\n64\n00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:13.278\nscreen we unchecked it in the demo saying\nhey use Windows update to go out and\n\n65\n00:03:13.278 --> 00:03:14.860\ndownload new updates.\n\n66\n00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.920\nWe said in the real world,\nleave that check off,\n\n67\n00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.830\nif you wanna make sure\nyou update the product.\n\n68\n00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.904\nWe're doing that on the front end here,\nthe reason is that,\n\n69\n00:03:21.904 --> 00:03:26.064\nwe're probably gonna need some specific\nsoftware, that's gonna have to be in or\n\n70\n00:03:26.064 --> 00:03:29.644\non the boxes of pre-req for\napp controller, you're gonna see that.\n\n71\n00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:33.345\nAnd I'm just gonna click Install while\nwe're talking, just to kick this off so\n\n72\n00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:34.720\nwe can gt this running.\n\n73\n00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.130\nBut what you'll see is we're gonna go out,\nwe're gonna check for that software, and\n\n74\n00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.730\nthen once we do that we are gonna actually\nthen potentially have to download and\n\n75\n00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.900\ninstall, we're gonna go ahead and check\nand see if it's doing that right now,\n\n76\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.690\ncomes out, brings up our hey,\nlet's put in our product key.\n\n77\n00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.520\nWe've talked about this on\nthe last install of VMM as well.\n\n78\n00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.571\nIn the real world clearly you would\nlicense these products, all right?\n\n79\n00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:59.195\nCuz you have to use them in production.\n\n80\n00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:02.828\nIn the demo environments we're building\nin or you may build to practice with,\n\n81\n00:04:02.828 --> 00:04:05.206\nyou don't have to necessarily\ninstall a license.\n\n82\n00:04:05.206 --> 00:04:07.630\nYou can install the product as an eval.\n\n83\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.773\nIf you do that, you get 180 day usage or\n\n84\n00:04:09.773 --> 00:04:13.520\n90 days depending on what version\nyou downloaded, that kinda thing.\n\n85\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.769\nIf it's one of the beta release or\npre-release builds versus the full\n\n86\n00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.200\nfinished product release build\nyou may get 90 versus 180 days.\n\n87\n00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.850\nBut if you're using full release product,\nin this case, 2012 R2 would be.\n\n88\n00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.808\nYou get 180 day eval.\n\n89\n00:04:27.808 --> 00:04:31.280\nSo you could skip the license key,\nwe're gonna skip that as well.\n\n90\n00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.880\nIt does tell you right here,\nhey we're putting this in an eval mode or\n\n91\n00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.030\nan eval edition,\nif you;re not gonna license it.\n\n92\n00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.720\nSo we'll click Next, we get our\nulevel we're gonna check off and\n\n93\n00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.641\nsay we read that, even though we did not,\nas Daniel reminded me last time.\n\n94\n00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:46.611\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you'll notice that checkbox we\n\n95\n00:04:46.611 --> 00:04:48.260\nhad on the first screen.\n\n96\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.470\nHey, do we need to check for\nmissing software?\n\n97\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.780\nAbsolutely, you'll see,\nwe got a couple of items here on the WCF,\n\n98\n00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.600\nthe Windows Communication Framework.\n\n99\n00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.667\nData services, version 5.\n\n100\n00:04:56.667 --> 00:05:01.570\nThe web server IS role has to be\ninstalled and configured on the box.\n\n101\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.274\nIt is not, so we're gonna configure\nthat as part of the install.\n\n102\n00:05:04.274 --> 00:05:06.680\nSo these things are gonna happen.\n\n103\n00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.300\nSo we're gonna be going through and\nhaving this do it's thing.\n\n104\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.950\nNow we can just so we know.\n\n105\n00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.680\nIn case we think we missed something,\nverify pre-reqs again.\n\n106\n00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.000\nWe're not gonna bother doing that.\n\n107\n00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.863\nWe know we have all the prereqs,\nbut If for\n\n108\n00:05:18.863 --> 00:05:22.592\nsome reason you feel you're missing\nsomething or something doesn't look right,\n\n109\n00:05:22.592 --> 00:05:25.790\njust re-run that prereq check,\nyou do that at the lower left.\n\n110\n00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.300\nAnd then obviously, once you get the\nresults, make sure you have what you need.\n\n111\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.070\nWe're gonna click Install,\nwe,re gonna let this do it's thing.\n\n112\n00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.812\nAnd it's gonna take a few minutes\nto download, get all of that done.\n\n113\n00:05:34.812 --> 00:05:38.520\nIt's enabling IS in the role\nservices right now.\n\n114\n00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.750\nWe'll wait for that to finish,\nwe'll come on back and\n\n115\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.119\nwe'll take a look once that's done,\nand then we'll continue.\n\n116\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.210\nAll right, so, you could see we've got\nour select install pass screen up.\n\n117\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.905\nWe finished downloading our\nprereqs configuring IS.\n\n118\n00:05:49.905 --> 00:05:53.430\nGot WCF services version\n5 installed in there.\n\n119\n00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.230\nWe're gonna go ahead.\n\n120\n00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.580\nWe're gonna use the default path we can\nobviously modify this in the real world.\n\n121\n00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.540\nJust keep in mind here for your disk\nspace, about 24 gigs, what do we require?\n\n122\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.968\n50 megs, real, real small install,\ncompare to some of the others, right?\n\n123\n00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:09.445\nRemember the, [COUGH] Some of the other\nsoftware we took a look at the prereqs of\n\n124\n00:06:09.445 --> 00:06:14.243\nthe VMM, we needed about 4, 3 to 4 gigs of\nspace for the Windows deployment kit that\n\n125\n00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:17.930\nwe download, we don't need that for\nthis, this is really tiny.\n\n126\n00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.360\nSo, we'll just gonna go ahead and\nclick Next here.\n\n127\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.110\nConfigure the services, what kind of\nservices account we're gonna use.\n\n128\n00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.190\nWe're gonna do our domain account.\n\n129\n00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.030\nSo we're just gonna click here.\n\n130\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.580\nLet's put this in real quick.\n\n131\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.380\nThis will be our domain.\n\n132\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.929\nSo practice labs administrator and\nthen make sure\n\n133\n00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:38.710\nthat's spelled correctly, cuz-\n&gt;&gt; It does matter.\n\n134\n00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.452\n&gt;&gt; I am just such a great typist.\n\n135\n00:06:39.452 --> 00:06:41.810\nYes, spelling does matter.\n\n136\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.569\nBelieve it or not, it does.\n\n137\n00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.710\nAnd we have our password there.\n\n138\n00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.430\nWe do have our port number\ndown at the bottom.\n\n139\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.973\nI don't know if you're able to see that or\nnot.\n\n140\n00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:52.530\nLet's just, we go to full screen for\njust a second, just to show you that\n\n141\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.165\nyou'll see the port number down here,\n18,622, this is the port,\n\n142\n00:06:57.165 --> 00:07:01.880\nthe traditional port that you use for\napp controller communication.\n\n143\n00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.420\nWe can modify that, probably you don't\nwanna do that, but we could go in and\n\n144\n00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.290\nmodify that If we wanted to we'd have\nto make some changes in other areas.\n\n145\n00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.442\nAnd it may get a little complicated\nto get it right, everywhere.\n\n146\n00:07:11.442 --> 00:07:15.120\nBut we can modify that port if\nnecessary so you'll see it here.\n\n147\n00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.910\nWe're gonna go ahead and click Next,\nwe have to configure the website now.\n\n148\n00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.840\nRemember the app controller is gonna be\nresting on top of the IIS role that we've\n\n149\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.690\nconfigured.\n\n150\n00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.860\nSo we need to make sure that\nwe are setting up the website.\n\n151\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.417\nAnd having it configured the right way so\nthat we can interact with it, and\n\n152\n00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:32.582\nhave control or can leverage it.\n\n153\n00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:34.530\nSo we're gonna go ahead.\n\n154\n00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.210\nAnd just take a look,\n\n155\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.210\nwe have a default IP address all and\na sign meaning it will bind to any IP.\n\n156\n00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.070\nWe've got our default port here, 443.\n\n157\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.286\nSo secure communication through HTTPS\nbeing used we'll see that here.\n\n158\n00:07:46.286 --> 00:07:50.529\nWe do then have either the ability\nto use an existing certificate or\n\n159\n00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:53.574\nwe have to generate a self\nsigned certificate.\n\n160\n00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:57.303\nWe can go ahead if we use the existing\ncertificate and pull down,\n\n161\n00:07:57.303 --> 00:08:01.794\nwe'll see that we have our domain\nspecified here, our domain certificate,\n\n162\n00:08:01.794 --> 00:08:03.797\nquote unquote, specified here,\n\n163\n00:08:03.797 --> 00:08:08.775\nthe machinepracticelabs.com certificate\nthat's been issued behind the scenes,\n\n164\n00:08:08.775 --> 00:08:13.270\nthis is just the certificate that's\nbeen used or set up for this demo.\n\n165\n00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.405\nIn the real world, you would either have\nto have a certificate already available,\n\n166\n00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:21.068\nit could be a self signed certificate\nissued to the machine from your PKI,\n\n167\n00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:24.278\nfrom your public key infrastructure,\nprobably ADCS, right?\n\n168\n00:08:24.278 --> 00:08:27.724\nSo, the Active Directory Certificate\nServices would be used to self sign and\n\n169\n00:08:27.724 --> 00:08:31.380\nauto generate a certificate, that could\nbe then assigned to this machine.\n\n170\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.838\nYou could generate a self signed\ncertificate on this machine itself.\n\n171\n00:08:34.838 --> 00:08:37.360\nIt will be up to you to\ndecide how to do that.\n\n172\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.880\nBut if the domain certificate\nservices issues a certificate,\n\n173\n00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.890\nyou'll then have it published and\nmade available.\n\n174\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:43.970\nYou could pull it in either way.\n\n175\n00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.263\nSo, we'll go ahead, or\n\n176\n00:08:45.263 --> 00:08:48.234\na third party certificate as\nwell from a third party PKI.\n\n177\n00:08:48.234 --> 00:08:50.090\nWe'll just go ahead and grab this.\n\n178\n00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.248\nIf we click view here, we can see\nthe certificate, just quickly, so\n\n179\n00:08:53.248 --> 00:08:54.930\nyou can see what it looks like.\n\n180\n00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.080\nThis is our standard X509v3\ncertificate template.\n\n181\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.050\nNothing to weird about this.\n\n182\n00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.720\nWe'll see it here.\n\n183\n00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.150\nAnd we can see it's issued\nto the VM build, or\n\n184\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.900\nVMM build machine, issued by the VMM\nbuild practiselabs.com machine.\n\n185\n00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.450\nIn other words, it is a certificate\nissued by this machine itself.\n\n186\n00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.870\nAnd we see the certification path is here,\nright?\n\n187\n00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.970\nSo it's going to be the key container\ncertificate that's being used to specify\n\n188\n00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.560\nthat we can actually apply this to\nthe website, and use this to validate, and\n\n189\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.750\nuse this to ensure that\nwe can host securely.\n\n190\n00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.610\nSo we're gonna grab that certificate, once\nwe've done that, we'll just click Refresh,\n\n191\n00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.520\njust make sure that is available,\nloaded properly, all is good.\n\n192\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.560\nWe know it is, but we just wanna\ndo that as the best practice.\n\n193\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.110\nMake sure we follow all those steps, and\n\n194\n00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.960\nmake sure everything is\ngonna work the right way.\n\n195\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.600\nSo we've got that.\n\n196\n00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.490\nWe'll click Next.\n\n197\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.244\nWe then have to configure\nthe SQL database.\n\n198\n00:09:46.244 --> 00:09:50.920\nSo we're gonna go in and make sure\nthat we have this information put in.\n\n199\n00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.581\nRemember, we're using or\nwe have been using for\n\n200\n00:09:54.581 --> 00:09:58.793\nour demos, the IP address as\nsupposed the server name.\n\n201\n00:09:58.793 --> 00:10:00.908\nSo we're gonna specify\nthe IP address here,\n\n202\n00:10:00.908 --> 00:10:04.150\n192.168.0.2 is the machine\nIP we've been using.\n\n203\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.275\nOur port is gonna be the standard,\nport for SQL Server,\n\n204\n00:10:07.275 --> 00:10:10.082\nI would ask you what that\nport is based on the last.\n\n205\n00:10:10.082 --> 00:10:11.057\n&gt;&gt; 1.4.3.3.\n\n206\n00:10:11.057 --> 00:10:13.536\n&gt;&gt; This time you got it right,\nabsolutely, 1.4-\n\n207\n00:10:13.536 --> 00:10:14.084\n&gt;&gt; I learned something new.\n\n208\n00:10:14.084 --> 00:10:18.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] 1.4.3.3, and we've got our\ninstance name, we're using our standard\n\n209\n00:10:18.942 --> 00:10:22.531\ninstance, which will be MS SQL server,\nso we'll put that in.\n\n210\n00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:24.497\nMake sure we got the right\nnumber of S's there.\n\n211\n00:10:24.497 --> 00:10:28.637\n[CROSSTALK] SSSSS SQL server.\n\n212\n00:10:28.637 --> 00:10:30.350\nSo you just wanna make\nsure you get that right.\n\n213\n00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.770\nWhatever the instance name is,\n\n214\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.535\nyou may have a named instance\nthat your DBA has set up for you.\n\n215\n00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:38.315\nYou may be that DBA,\nyou may be setting this up for yourself.\n\n216\n00:10:38.315 --> 00:10:41.515\nSo, you'll pull in whatever that\nparticular information may be.\n\n217\n00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:42.685\nYou'll figure that out.\n\n218\n00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:43.565\nThe database name,\n\n219\n00:10:43.565 --> 00:10:48.080\nyou'll see the default database name\nthere, appcontroller, no spaces.\n\n220\n00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.060\nThat's what we'll accept.\n\n221\n00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.000\nWe accepted the default\nVMM database name as well.\n\n222\n00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.590\nWe'll be doing that with all\nof our installs pretty much.\n\n223\n00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.460\nYou can, obviously, modify those\nif you have a naming convention or\n\n224\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.230\nsomething you need to deal\nwith in your organization.\n\n225\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.130\nBut the best practice recommendation,\nis simply to leave those database\n\n226\n00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.710\nnames alone, that way we're not messing\naround with what we would expect and see.\n\n227\n00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.520\nAnd then if we're reading documentation\nlater from Microsoft about how to\n\n228\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.030\ndo a recovery, or\nhow to do a backup, or anything\n\n229\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.110\nwe may need to do later, those names are\ngonna match up, because they're gonna be\n\n230\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.690\nwhat are used in the documentation\nas the standard database names.\n\n231\n00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.790\nSo it's just a little extra way for\nyou to be cautious, but\n\n232\n00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.680\nalso to ensure that if you have a problem\ndown the road and you have to go back and\n\n233\n00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.060\nread up on how to deal with it,\nthings will match up easily,\n\n234\n00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.950\nyou're not gonna be mystified about what\nyou called something or where it is.\n\n235\n00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.320\nSo we're gonna leave that there.\n\n236\n00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.489\nLet that goes through, just make sure\neverything is copacetic, as we say.\n\n237\n00:11:39.489 --> 00:11:40.897\nWill give that a second or two,\n\n238\n00:11:40.897 --> 00:11:43.769\nusually takes a moment just be\nable to connect to the database,\n\n239\n00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:48.040\nmake sure everything is good, verifying\nthat everything is the way it should be.\n\n240\n00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.903\nI did spell it correctly,\nno extra Ss, so that's always good.\n\n241\n00:11:49.903 --> 00:11:51.265\n&gt;&gt; You didn't type with a lisp [LAUGH].\n\n242\n00:11:51.265 --> 00:11:53.150\n&gt;&gt; I do, I do, I can.\n\n243\n00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.524\nAnd so you'll see,\nwe do have the customer improvement or\n\n244\n00:11:55.524 --> 00:11:57.640\ncustomer experience improvement program.\n\n245\n00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.090\nRemember, we're opting out in this\nin the demo, but in the real world,\n\n246\n00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.270\nyou would hopefully opt in, give Microsoft\npeople would understand more about\n\n247\n00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.810\nyou're usage, how you're using\nthe product, and to benefit from that, and\n\n248\n00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.060\nmake the product better.\n\n249\n00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.872\nThe Microsoft update check mark there,\nwe talked about this,\n\n250\n00:12:11.872 --> 00:12:14.710\nare we gonna use this to\ndownload updates on going?\n\n251\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.560\nThis is the, hey, do you wanna use\nthe update function to securely patch and\n\n252\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.140\nmaintain app controller?\n\n253\n00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.486\nIn the real world definitely wanna opt\nin for this, in the demo we're not gonna\n\n254\n00:12:24.486 --> 00:12:27.140\nbother with this, cuz again,\nwe're not gonna be downloading updates.\n\n255\n00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.973\nBut make sure you're aware of that, okay?\n\n256\n00:12:28.973 --> 00:12:30.444\nSo we're gonna click next here.\n\n257\n00:12:30.444 --> 00:12:32.797\nWe get our confirm the settings page.\n\n258\n00:12:32.797 --> 00:12:34.647\nThis is where we're just\ngonna double check, and\n\n259\n00:12:34.647 --> 00:12:38.000\nwe should be a little bit cautious here,\nto make sure we have everything correct.\n\n260\n00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.440\nIf you're the standard IT professional,\nyou're probably gonna click Next or\n\n261\n00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.730\nInstall and not bother to look.\n\n262\n00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.610\nBut hopefully, what you're gonna do, and\nthis is something I tell all my customers,\n\n263\n00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.599\ntell my students to do,\nfrom a documentation standpoint,\n\n264\n00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.380\nwhat better time to capture the build\ninformation than right now,\n\n265\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.080\nby taking a screen capture,\ndropping this into your documentation,\n\n266\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.750\nyou've got everything essentially\nlaid out beautifully here.\n\n267\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.620\nWhen we come in and we do audit work after\nthe fact, you show me this, I can quickly\n\n268\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.650\nvalidate this against what you're showing\nme in the environment, and it's good.\n\n269\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.280\nI need to do DR, I've got all\nthe important information here,\n\n270\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.070\nthe port numbers, the install directory,\nthe URL, the information about\n\n271\n00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.110\nthe database, the name of the certificate,\nall that stuff's here.\n\n272\n00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.730\nI obviously, clearly,\nneed additional stuff, but\n\n273\n00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.850\nI've got all the pertinent\nfacts to drive DR here.\n\n274\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.385\nSo this will be a great time for you to do\na quick screen capture, even if it is one\n\n275\n00:13:28.385 --> 00:13:31.826\nof those, let me take a picture with my\nphone and just capture it, cuz maybe you\n\n276\n00:13:31.826 --> 00:13:35.505\ndon't have a screen capture or screen\nsnip program installed on the machine.\n\n277\n00:13:35.505 --> 00:13:38.030\nThat's fine,\ncuz you know I have customers say, hey,\n\n278\n00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.850\nwe don't have that as part of our build.\n\n279\n00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.370\nJust take the picture and\nthen drop into the demo, or drop it into\n\n280\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.400\nthe documentation after the fact, so\njust make sure you're aware of that.\n\n281\n00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.170\nWe're gonna click Install,\nthis is gonna kick off.\n\n282\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.948\nIt is gonna take a few minutes for\nit to run through, we'll watch it for\n\n283\n00:13:50.948 --> 00:13:54.025\njust a second, but then we'll cut away and\nwe'll come back when it's done.\n\n284\n00:13:54.025 --> 00:13:57.484\nBut I just want to point out before we\ndo that, that you'll see that we can go,\n\n285\n00:13:57.484 --> 00:14:01.000\nand we're watching here, we have server\nalready configured core components\n\n286\n00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.129\nare setup,\nwe have our website already setup,\n\n287\n00:14:03.129 --> 00:14:06.090\nthe firewall settings are really\njust what's being done there.\n\n288\n00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.240\nThe database itself is\nnow being instantiated,\n\n289\n00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.960\nthe server is being configured, the agent\njobs eventually will get PowerShell,\n\n290\n00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.740\nand then we'll complete the install.\n\n291\n00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.700\nSo it will take a few minutes,\nonce this is done, we'll come back and\n\n292\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.870\ntake a look, and\nthen we'll finish up our install.\n\n293\n00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.577\nSo we can see that our app\ncontroller setup has finished,\n\n294\n00:14:22.577 --> 00:14:24.150\nuou'll see the completion screen there.\n\n295\n00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.112\nGot our screen circles,\nwhite checks for everything.\n\n296\n00:14:27.112 --> 00:14:28.854\nIt'd be great if they put a smiley face.\n\n297\n00:14:28.854 --> 00:14:29.559\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n298\n00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:33.552\n&gt;&gt; Or Bill Gates's head was floating\nin a window, like an easter egg.\n\n299\n00:14:33.552 --> 00:14:36.348\n&gt;&gt; Him, winking with his thumb-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah something like that.\n\n300\n00:14:36.348 --> 00:14:38.483\n&gt;&gt; It will be awesome.\n&gt;&gt; I've beaten the snot out of, you know,\n\n301\n00:14:38.483 --> 00:14:39.310\nwhat's his name?\n\n302\n00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.141\n&gt;&gt; Steve Jobs?\n[LAUGH]\n\n303\n00:14:40.141 --> 00:14:40.641\n&gt;&gt; No, not Jobs.\n\n304\n00:14:40.641 --> 00:14:41.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:14:41.898 --> 00:14:43.122\n&gt;&gt; The one who was running Microsoft\n\n306\n00:14:43.122 --> 00:14:44.090\nbefore the current guy.\n\n307\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.950\n&gt;&gt; He was a Ballmer?\n\n308\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ballmer, if he's beating\nthe snot out of Ballmer or something.\n\n309\n00:14:47.745 --> 00:14:50.503\nAnyway, but you know, they don’t ask\nour opinion about this kind of stuff.\n\n310\n00:14:50.503 --> 00:14:51.800\n&gt;&gt; They should.\n[LAUGH]\n\n311\n00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.328\n&gt;&gt; Well, you’re right, they should, but\n\n312\n00:14:52.328 --> 00:14:53.219\nthey don’t.\nBut anyway,\n\n313\n00:14:53.219 --> 00:14:56.163\nso what we’ll see at the bottom\nof the screen there is,\n\n314\n00:14:56.163 --> 00:15:00.010\nwe do have an option to go ahead and\nstart the app controller website up.\n\n315\n00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.583\nWe’re gonna leave leave that unchecked,\nonly cuz I wanna show you how to ensure\n\n316\n00:15:03.583 --> 00:15:06.730\nthat the proper level of authentication\nis set up on the website.\n\n317\n00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.172\nGonna take into IIS, show you how to do\nthat real quick, then we'll go ahead and\n\n318\n00:15:10.172 --> 00:15:13.572\nwe'll launch the website to show you\nthat it is configured and complete,\n\n319\n00:15:13.572 --> 00:15:15.432\nand we'll wrap up this demo.\n\n320\n00:15:15.432 --> 00:15:17.982\nBut normally in the real world,\nif you go ahead and do this,\n\n321\n00:15:17.982 --> 00:15:20.582\nyou may decide to opt right in,\nset this up, but\n\n322\n00:15:20.582 --> 00:15:24.242\nas I said all we're running right now\nwas basic authentication on the site,\n\n323\n00:15:24.242 --> 00:15:28.040\nwhich would get you in as\nan administrator local on the system.\n\n324\n00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.096\nBut you may wanna enable a higher level of\nauthentication, Windows Authentication,\n\n325\n00:15:32.096 --> 00:15:34.880\na deal with credential-based\nauthentication from\n\n326\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.270\nanother user in the domain.\n\n327\n00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.190\nSo I wanna show you how to do that as\nthe best practice just before we spin\n\n328\n00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.000\nthe site up.\n\n329\n00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.670\nSo we're gonna finish this out,\nwe'll just go ahead and click Finish.\n\n330\n00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.501\nWe'll go ahead and just close out\nour window on the media here.\n\n331\n00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:50.270\nAnd what we're gonna do,\ngo into our Server Manager on the box.\n\n332\n00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.254\nWe're gonna go into the IIS Manager,\nand take a look at the website.\n\n333\n00:15:53.254 --> 00:15:56.724\nSo we can see the IIS is installed and\nconfigured here, just so\n\n334\n00:15:56.724 --> 00:15:57.809\nwe could see that.\n\n335\n00:15:57.809 --> 00:15:59.600\nWe're gonna come over to tools And\n\n336\n00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.813\non tools, we're gonna come down here to\nIIS manager, just gonna bring this up.\n\n337\n00:16:03.813 --> 00:16:06.481\nWe're running IS services version 8,\n\n338\n00:16:06.481 --> 00:16:11.850\nthis is the server 12 r2 box 88.5\ndepending on the version of Windows.\n\n339\n00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:16.720\nAnd we're gonna open up our plaid vmm\nbuild practice labs website here,\n\n340\n00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.120\njust gonna open this up,\nwe're going to extend this down.\n\n341\n00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.322\nWe're just gonna get rid of our little,\nhey do you wanna go out and connect and\n\n342\n00:16:22.322 --> 00:16:24.007\ndownload stuff from Microsoft prompt?\n\n343\n00:16:24.007 --> 00:16:26.466\nGonna open our sites container here.\n\n344\n00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:29.886\nAnd under sites, you'll see we have our\napp controller website that is been\n\n345\n00:16:29.886 --> 00:16:32.780\ninstantiated, that's what we\nwere doing during the install.\n\n346\n00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.770\nWe were building out and configuring that\nwebsite, so it's already been set up.\n\n347\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.390\nNow if we go full-screen here for a sec,\nit's kind of hard to see the detail.\n\n348\n00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.070\nYou'll see that one of the sub-sites\nvirtual directory here, we have this API,\n\n349\n00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.910\nthe API home site.\n\n350\n00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.250\nWe're gonna go ahead and set up\nauthentication on this particular area.\n\n351\n00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.930\nSo we're gonna highlight this, right?\n\n352\n00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.769\nWe can see what's sitting up underneath\nthere, we have a bin directory, and\n\n353\n00:16:55.769 --> 00:16:58.025\ninside bin, we just have settings, right?\n\n354\n00:16:58.025 --> 00:17:01.016\nThere's really nothing to speak of\nthat we're gonna interact with, but\n\n355\n00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:02.233\nwe have API here for the home.\n\n356\n00:17:02.233 --> 00:17:05.497\nWe're gonna come over here to do\nauthentication, double-click on that and\n\n357\n00:17:05.497 --> 00:17:08.448\nyou'll see we have the Windows\nauthentication levels here.\n\n358\n00:17:08.448 --> 00:17:11.230\nAnd I mentioned that the only\nthing that's running by default\n\n359\n00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.470\nis basic authentication.\n\n360\n00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.180\nWe can see that there,\neverything else is set to disabled.\n\n361\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.505\nAnd so what we're gonna do is grab Windows\nauthentication, and we can enable any\n\n362\n00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:24.035\nof these, just by highlighting and using\nthe tasks area over here, under actions.\n\n363\n00:17:24.035 --> 00:17:26.611\nYou can actually right click and\ndo it as well from here.\n\n364\n00:17:26.611 --> 00:17:28.835\nYou know,\nit's just question at what you prefer?\n\n365\n00:17:28.835 --> 00:17:31.331\nSo we'll just click enable here,\nwe'll set that up,\n\n366\n00:17:31.331 --> 00:17:35.047\nnow it's been turned on with some advanced\nsettings, and we need to go in there.\n\n367\n00:17:35.047 --> 00:17:38.549\nWe're not gonna configure anything there,\nbut if we do wanna take a look,\n\n368\n00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:42.390\nwe can just quickly see that we have\nextended protection capabilities here.\n\n369\n00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.820\nKernel mode authentication is selected,\nso we've enabled that, it says,\n\n370\n00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.920\njust in case you haven't\ndealt with this before.\n\n371\n00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.774\nBy default, we enable kernel mode app, or\n\n372\n00:17:50.774 --> 00:17:52.939\nkernel mode authentication\nprotection rather,\n\n373\n00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:56.653\nwhich improves authentication performance,\nprevents authentication problems,\n\n374\n00:17:56.653 --> 00:18:00.331\nsome of them anyway, with application\npools configured with the custom identity.\n\n375\n00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:04.620\nIt allows us to control and optimize\nright, the authentication process.\n\n376\n00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.650\nSo, we're gonna just go with that,\nleave that there.\n\n377\n00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.970\nNow that that's been set up,\nwe'll minimize this,\n\n378\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.570\nwe're not gonna bother to close out, and\nwe'll just go ahead and minimize this.\n\n379\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.860\nWe'll go ahead and\nminimize the server manager as well.\n\n380\n00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.010\nWhat we'll then gonna do is spin up IE so\nwe'll just bring up Internet Explorer.\n\n381\n00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.870\nAnd we're just gonna go ahead or\nwe're gonna type in our path, so\n\n382\n00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.000\nwe'll just gonna go ahead and do this.\n\n383\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.021\nSo we'll put in https,\nthat is if you remember\n\n384\n00:18:29.021 --> 00:18:33.061\nfrom our configuration it's\nsecure connect so port 443.\n\n385\n00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:36.733\nSo we're gonna do that, play or\nplab, I should say, oops,\n\n386\n00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:39.478\nhold on,\nlet me turn off the caps lock there.\n\n387\n00:18:39.478 --> 00:18:43.872\nplabvmmbuild and then practicelabs.com,\n\n388\n00:18:43.872 --> 00:18:48.495\nthis would be the URL of\nthe machine that you're\n\n389\n00:18:48.495 --> 00:18:53.593\nconfiguring in the real world,\nwe're using this.\n\n390\n00:18:53.593 --> 00:18:54.885\nBut obviously in the real world,\n\n391\n00:18:54.885 --> 00:18:57.065\nthis will be whatever it is\nthat you're gonna be using.\n\n392\n00:18:57.065 --> 00:19:00.885\nSo gonna go ahead, we're gonna type\nthat in, just hit Go there real quick.\n\n393\n00:19:00.885 --> 00:19:05.425\nFirst time we connect, we are prompted to\ndownload Silverlight and put in the latest\n\n394\n00:19:05.425 --> 00:19:08.375\nbill, but we don't already have\nit preconfigured in the system.\n\n395\n00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:10.935\nDidn't set it up and install it ahead\nof time, so you would see this,\n\n396\n00:19:10.935 --> 00:19:14.560\ncuz want you to see this is the expected\nbehavior so you'll know about it.\n\n397\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.700\nNo big deal, you just have to click to\ndownload obviously, so we'll do that.\n\n398\n00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.898\n&gt;&gt; Rumors of the Silverlight's\ndemise have been great exaggerated.\n\n399\n00:19:19.898 --> 00:19:21.716\n&gt;&gt; They have been.\n\n400\n00:19:21.716 --> 00:19:22.949\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it has popping up\n\n401\n00:19:22.949 --> 00:19:23.846\neverywhere right?\n\n402\n00:19:23.846 --> 00:19:25.241\nSo we're gonna click Run here.\n\n403\n00:19:25.241 --> 00:19:29.433\nWe're gonna get our little prompt for\ninstalling Silverlight.\n\n404\n00:19:29.433 --> 00:19:33.073\nNow just zoom in for min, just wanna show\nyou this cause you probably not gonna\n\n405\n00:19:33.073 --> 00:19:36.937\nwanna do these two things, meaning you're\nnot gonna wanna make Bing your default\n\n406\n00:19:36.937 --> 00:19:39.350\nsearch engine and\nmake MSN your home page, right?\n\n407\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.850\nSo make sure you opt out of those if\nyou have no desire to have that happen,\n\n408\n00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.400\nI'm gonna opt out of that, right?\n\n409\n00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.170\nSo we're gonna make sure that's there.\n\n410\n00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.840\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and we're\njust gonna download, and it's interesting,\n\n411\n00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.480\nif you actually take a look back and\n\n412\n00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.360\njust let me full screen for just show\nyou the marketing genius here, right?\n\n413\n00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.640\nSo, okay, you've got the opt-ins but\nthen if you read real small fine print\n\n414\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.430\ndown there, asterisk after each one\napplies to IE, Firefox, Chrome and Safari.\n\n415\n00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.790\nSo it does apply to every browser.\n\n416\n00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.860\nThis is the behavior that is\none should know that, right?\n\n417\n00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.775\nSo just point that out to you, anyway.\n\n418\n00:20:10.775 --> 00:20:12.019\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna love Big Brother [LAUGH].\n\n419\n00:20:12.019 --> 00:20:13.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes!\n\n420\n00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.230\nThank you very much.\n\n421\n00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:18.700\nWe're gonna click Install Now, it'll take\njust a moment to download and do that.\n\n422\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.640\nThey do say in that little prompt there,\nit's less than a 30 second install,\n\n423\n00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.030\nno big deal,\nyou could see it is pretty quick.\n\n424\n00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.670\nIt has been done,\nit does tell you to refresh.\n\n425\n00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.030\nif you just hit Close, it actually does\nload up without having to refresh,\n\n426\n00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.220\nit's up to you, but it will take a moment.\n\n427\n00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.550\nIt does load up, that's the super\nsecret magnetic combo crypto\n\n428\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.220\nlock being unlocked for\nyou to see the console there.\n\n429\n00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.940\n&gt;&gt; It's a very wonderful graphic.\n\n430\n00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.710\n&gt;&gt; It is a wonderful graphic,\nit's almost good as a swirling vortex.\n\n431\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In the new versions of Windows, right?\n\n432\n00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:52.280\nAnd so you'll see here that we do\nget our app controller console up.\n\n433\n00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.510\nNotice at the bottom here, you have to go\nfull screen for me for just a second so\n\n434\n00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.490\nwe could see the warning.\n\n435\n00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.010\nNot warning but just the notes,\nI can't really drag it up,\n\n436\n00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.440\nit sits at the bottom of the screen.\n\n437\n00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.520\nBut you'll see 180 day eval,\n\n438\n00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.020\nright, it reminds us we have\nnot licensed the product.\n\n439\n00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.725\nWe're running it in eval mode\nwhich is fine, no big deal,\n\n440\n00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:12.178\njust reminding you of that [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Is the eval mode restricted in any\n\n441\n00:21:12.178 --> 00:21:12.742\nway Adam?\n\n442\n00:21:12.742 --> 00:21:16.574\n&gt;&gt; Full license product, full\nfunctionality, no restriction other than\n\n443\n00:21:16.574 --> 00:21:20.045\njust keeping track of the calendar and\nknow when it's gonna die.\n\n444\n00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:21.935\nBut no, other than that,\nit works the same way.\n\n445\n00:21:21.935 --> 00:21:25.270\nSo we're just gonna get rid of that\njust so we're not bothered by that.\n\n446\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.930\nAnd then you'll see we're signed\nin on our app controller.\n\n447\n00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.530\nWe're not gonna go through our\nsettings bells and whistles now.\n\n448\n00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.500\nWe'll be talking about this more in\nsome of the upcoming episodes and\n\n449\n00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.890\nwe'll interact with this\na little bit in other areas.\n\n450\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.000\nBut we can see this is fully\nfunctional set up ready to go.\n\n451\n00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.670\nAt that point we can either sign out or\nwe can just leave this up and running.\n\n452\n00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.792\nWe'll go ahead and we'll sign out and\nthen once we've done that,\n\n453\n00:21:45.792 --> 00:21:48.929\nwe'll see the app controller just\ndrops back down, ops, shoot.\n\n454\n00:21:48.929 --> 00:21:52.670\nJust try that one more time,\nthat's the refresh issue with Silverlight.\n\n455\n00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.727\nLet's try, let's do it this way.\n\n456\n00:21:54.727 --> 00:21:55.336\nLet's just do this.\nAnd\n\n457\n00:21:55.336 --> 00:21:58.844\nget rid of that,\nthat's good enough without refreshing, and\n\n458\n00:21:58.844 --> 00:22:02.660\nit doesn't actually sign out\nthe right way in the first time.\n\n459\n00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.820\nBut you can see once we've done the\ninstall, we're all set and ready to go.\n\n460\n00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.250\nAnd that completes our discussion and\nour demo for\n\n461\n00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.205\nyou of how to set the app\ncontroller server product.\n\n462\n00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:13.025\nCome back to join us for another episode,\n\n463\n00:22:13.025 --> 00:22:16.475\nwe're gonna be taking a look at how\nto configure and install Ops Manager.\n\n464\n00:22:16.475 --> 00:22:17.482\nThat's gonna be, I believe,\n\n465\n00:22:17.482 --> 00:22:19.402\nour next demo coming up,\nthat will be an interesting one.\n\n466\n00:22:19.402 --> 00:22:22.615\nEspecially given the fact that that's\ngonna be the focus of our attention\n\n467\n00:22:22.615 --> 00:22:26.695\nfrom majority of our discussions in this\nset of shows, really important demo.\n\n468\n00:22:26.695 --> 00:22:28.835\nYou wanna see how to build that\nout from the ground up and\n\n469\n00:22:28.835 --> 00:22:30.605\nmake sure we understand\nhow to configure it, so\n\n470\n00:22:30.605 --> 00:22:33.840\nwe can be successful at doing our\ndata set of monitoring in the cloud.\n\n471\n00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.731\nSo come back and see us for that.\n\n472\n00:22:34.731 --> 00:22:38.785\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff Adam, thank you so much\nfor showing us how to get the apps manager\n\n473\n00:22:38.785 --> 00:22:41.808\ninstalled, or\ncontroller should I say apps controller.\n\n474\n00:22:41.808 --> 00:22:42.869\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Apps controller.\n\n475\n00:22:42.869 --> 00:22:45.564\n&gt;&gt; Managers and controllers all over the\nplace, it's hard to keep them straight.\n\n476\n00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:46.731\n&gt;&gt; Everything wants to be a manager.\n\n477\n00:22:46.731 --> 00:22:48.235\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n478\n00:22:48.235 --> 00:22:50.860\nAll right that being said,looks like we've\ncome to the end of our episode, hopefully,\n\n479\n00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.720\nyou've enjoyed it and\nyou've learned something from it.\n\n480\n00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.970\nWe strive hard to make that the very case.\n\n481\n00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.963\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\nsign off though but for ITPROTV,\n\n482\n00:22:57.963 --> 00:22:59.413\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n483\n00:22:59.413 --> 00:23:00.572\n&gt;&gt; I'm Silverlight.\n\n484\n00:23:00.572 --> 00:23:01.995\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n485\n00:23:01.995 --> 00:23:10.216\n[MUSIC]\n\n486\n00:23:10.216 --> 00:23:12.933\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.529\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.629\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.850\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.360\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are back with more of our data\n\n7\n00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.600\ncenter monitoring with\nMicrosoft SCOM series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.120\nAnd it's been a long good time,\nbut joining us yet\n\n9\n00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.340\nagain to continue guiding us down that\npath Is our good friend Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.380\nAdam welcome back again,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.259\n&gt;&gt; It is going fantabioulusly well,\nI fell I'm [CROSSTALK] with sunshine.\n\n12\n00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:36.024\n&gt;&gt; Fantabioulus.\n[LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:38.173\n&gt;&gt; That's what I feel like.\n\n14\n00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:40.430\n&gt;&gt; Blue skies, blue skies coming your way.\n\n15\n00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.060\nSo we're gonna continue our\ndiscussion/demo series here,\n\n16\n00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.510\nwe're focusing on the SCOM product.\n\n17\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.090\nNow the centerpiece of what we've been\ntalking about in these shows/episodes,\n\n18\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.170\nwe've done some of the background and\nsome of the supporting cast of characters.\n\n19\n00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.100\nWe set up in episode one of\nthis series the VMM product,\n\n20\n00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.460\nwe set up in episode\ntwo the app controller.\n\n21\n00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.410\nWe're now gonna do SCOM and\nconfigure SCOM on a single server install.\n\n22\n00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.320\nReason we're gonna do that is it's just\neasier to bring all that together in\n\n23\n00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.240\none place.\n\n24\n00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.940\nDo the demo for you, than it is to\nhave all those different pieces\n\n25\n00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.780\nconfigured out and having to jump\nthrough them during the demo,\n\n26\n00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.220\njust to put the database in place, just to\nconfigure this, just to configure that.\n\n27\n00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.530\nSo we're gonna do a standard\nall-in-one install database,\n\n28\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.850\nassumption is it's running\non the same machine.\n\n29\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.080\nRemember, in the real world, if you're\nsetting this up in a lab environment,\n\n30\n00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.920\nthis is most likely what\nyou would do anyway.\n\n31\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.920\nIf you're gonna do this in production,\nthe only difference is where you go to\n\n32\n00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.740\nspec out the database and say where\nis my database, where's my instance?\n\n33\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.010\nYou'll be connecting to a remote machine,\nbut\n\n34\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.150\nother than that, most of what we're gonna\ndo is gonna look identical for you.\n\n35\n00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.217\nJust to be aware of that, we're gonna\nstart out with dealing with our prereqs.\n\n36\n00:01:48.217 --> 00:01:50.388\nBut I'm gonna do this a little bit\ndifferently than I've done in some of\n\n37\n00:01:50.388 --> 00:01:51.670\nthe prior episodes.\n\n38\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.540\nI'm gonna bring PowerShell\ninto the mix here,\n\n39\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.860\nwe'll take a look at this in a minute.\n\n40\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.630\nWe like PowerShell and we have to be\nusing it for a variety of things.\n\n41\n00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.560\nSo it's always important to think\nabout how we can use PowerShell,\n\n42\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.930\nwhat we can use it for.\n\n43\n00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.160\nRemember the ideas anything\nwe could do in the GUI,\n\n44\n00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.720\ntraditionally can be\ndone through PowerShell.\n\n45\n00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.509\nAnd there may always be a additional\nthings that our PowerShell only, or\n\n46\n00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.365\nPowerShell centric,\nthat may not apply to the GUI, or\n\n47\n00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:15.181\nmay not possible through the GUI.\n\n48\n00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:18.959\nBut in this case, what we're gonna\ndo in PowerShell is install and\n\n49\n00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.466\nconfigure the web service,\nthe Web server function rather,\n\n50\n00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:26.528\nas a role on the box prior to installing\nSCOM and then also configure it.\n\n51\n00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:29.632\nWe can easily do that through the GUI\nusing the server manager, but\n\n52\n00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:33.140\nI'm gonna show you what to do it in\nPowerShell as prerequ to get this set up.\n\n53\n00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.190\nSo let's take a look if we could, we'll\nstart with that we'll get that going and\n\n54\n00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.680\nthen once it's done, we'll jump in and\nactually do our install.\n\n55\n00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.920\nWe've got our media already loaded,\nour setup fie ready to go.\n\n56\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.910\nBut what we're gonna do\nis jump into PowerShell,\n\n57\n00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.390\nI've adjusted the console shell font and\nbackground and the color scheme for you,\n\n58\n00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.930\nit's a little bit easier for you to see.\n\n59\n00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.350\nAnd what we've done is\nwe've gone ahead and\n\n60\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.690\nI've typed in the add Windows\nfeature PowerShell command line,\n\n61\n00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.610\nfollowed by the feature we want,\nin this case the web server.\n\n62\n00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.050\nFollowed by a long string no spaces,\n\n63\n00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.950\ncomma separated, of all\nthe configuration parameters we need.\n\n64\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.700\nSo what we do in the web server, and\n\n65\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.940\nwe're gonna then go in and\ndo the web management compatibility.\n\n66\n00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.582\nWeb asp is gonna solve the asp.\n\n67\n00:03:15.582 --> 00:03:20.624\nWe're gonna go ahead the active server\npage content, we're gonna go through,\n\n68\n00:03:20.624 --> 00:03:25.294\nas you see if you read through that\nstring set up ASPnet 4.5, ASP.NET,\n\n69\n00:03:25.294 --> 00:03:26.740\nHTTP activation.\n\n70\n00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.492\nInclude the management tools,\ndo all the various things,\n\n71\n00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:31.050\nthe ISAPI filters are there as well.\n\n72\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.490\nAll the things we need done\nto configure this out and\n\n73\n00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.260\nhave the .net framework capability\nbuilt in and ready to go.\n\n74\n00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.817\nSo we're gonna go ahead, let me just\nclick in here so we're all set, and\n\n75\n00:03:40.817 --> 00:03:44.723\nwe're gonna hit Enter and\nget our little paste buffer there.\n\n76\n00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:49.226\nLet me do that and then actually do\nit this way, one second I forgot,\n\n77\n00:03:49.226 --> 00:03:54.124\ngotta just backspace one and\nthen we'll be able to, there we go, tools,\n\n78\n00:03:54.124 --> 00:03:58.355\nactivate the console,\nlittle trick in our demo environment.\n\n79\n00:03:58.355 --> 00:03:59.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To make sure it's working\n\n80\n00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.000\nthe right way.\n\n81\n00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.660\n&gt;&gt; It's fun showing things on ITPRO TV.\n\n82\n00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.730\n&gt;&gt; You gotta have these little\nthings happening to make it look\n\n83\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.670\nlike it really is live, even though this\nis all really just a bunch of robots.\n\n84\n00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.551\nIt's [INAUDIBLE] world.\n\n85\n00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:11.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just robots doing this.\n\n86\n00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.570\nBut you can see, as we're going through,\nthat the installation starting in\n\n87\n00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.720\nthe console, PowerShell is going out,\nconfiguring the required feature,\n\n88\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.700\nsetting up and getting all the specifics\nof the parameters configured out for us.\n\n89\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.486\nWon't take too long so we'll just wait for\nthis to go ahead and finish up.\n\n90\n00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:31.239\nWhile we're waiting on this real quick,\nso PowerShell, right,\n\n91\n00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:33.250\nthis is an interesting little product.\n\n92\n00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.012\nWe do a lot with PowerShell and\nas I mentioned, using PowerShell,\n\n93\n00:04:37.012 --> 00:04:40.170\nwhile it's not required necessarily for\nthe install,\n\n94\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.090\nit's a set of skills that are gonna\nbecome really important for you.\n\n95\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.349\nEven more so as we continue on down the\nroad of talking about the various things\n\n96\n00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.774\nthat are gonna be\ninvolved with using SCOM,\n\n97\n00:04:50.774 --> 00:04:54.990\nstanding up configuring the product and\nmaking sure that it's ready to go.\n\n98\n00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.899\nWe do try to sprinkle in some of\nthe PowerShell cmdlets from time to time,\n\n99\n00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:59.760\nyou'll see those both\nin product episodes and\n\n100\n00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.163\nour episodes that are upcoming\naround our various things.\n\n101\n00:05:02.163 --> 00:05:06.525\nAlways encourage should go around taking\nnote of those PowerShell cmdlets,\n\n102\n00:05:06.525 --> 00:05:11.216\ntest them out make sure they work, but you\nhave to keep in mind that those PowerShell\n\n103\n00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:14.190\ncmdlets are specific to\nthe SCOM PowerShell shell.\n\n104\n00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.490\nIn other words the ops manager shell\nthat is PowerShell, but with PowerShell\n\n105\n00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.580\nare already loading the System Center\nOps Manager cmdlet module for you.\n\n106\n00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.570\nAs opposed to just the normal\nPowerShell modules or\n\n107\n00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.130\nthe standard PowerShell implementation,\nwhich doesn't support those cmdlets,\n\n108\n00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.535\nunless you add the modules in.\n\n109\n00:05:33.535 --> 00:05:34.990\nThere you can do that either way,\n\n110\n00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.860\nwe're not gonna get into how do I add the\nmodules in the standard PowerShell here.\n\n111\n00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.710\nBut it's easy to import modules, you\nwould just use the import module cmdlet,\n\n112\n00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.090\nspecify the name of the module or modules.\n\n113\n00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.594\nYou'd have to know where they are,\nthey're in the install media for SCOM,\n\n114\n00:05:48.594 --> 00:05:51.166\nson you could certainly bring\nthem in if you wanted to and\n\n115\n00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:53.440\nuse just your standard PowerShell shell or\nISE.\n\n116\n00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.907\nDaniel and I were talking about the ISE\neditor before we got started with this\n\n117\n00:05:56.907 --> 00:06:00.010\ndemo, that's just the graphical\neditor overlay for PowerShell.\n\n118\n00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.020\nSo you can write your scripts,\nyou can test them, debug them,\n\n119\n00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.710\netc, do all that in there.\n\n120\n00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.798\nOr you could simply load and\nonce we do have SCOM up and running,\n\n121\n00:06:07.798 --> 00:06:10.014\nwe'll show you there is\na separate command or\n\n122\n00:06:10.014 --> 00:06:13.012\nPowerShell cmdlet window that\nyou open up specific to SCOM.\n\n123\n00:06:13.012 --> 00:06:16.685\nYou can just open that one up and all\nthose cmdlets are already imported from\n\n124\n00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:20.420\nmodule, you can just run all\nthe cmdlets we're gonna show you there.\n\n125\n00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.110\nSo just keep that in mind and make sure\nyou're areare of that distinction,\n\n126\n00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.890\ncuz I get that sometimes for\ncustomers, say, have in PowerShell and\n\n127\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.130\nI'm using these cmdlets you're sending,\nthey're not working.\n\n128\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.950\nWell if you're in the normal PowerShell\nthey won't, because they're probably not\n\n129\n00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.830\nsupported there, but if you open up\nthe ops manager cmdlet shell they will be.\n\n130\n00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.728\nSo just understand that distinction and\n\n131\n00:06:37.728 --> 00:06:40.870\nif we go back take a look,\nwe will see that we are successful.\n\n132\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.630\nThat has been configured, and\n\n133\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.010\nyou'll see here success true,\nrestart needed no, right?\n\n134\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.050\nExit code success, so that's all good.\n\n135\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.040\nWe have all that set up, it says Windows\nautomatic updating is not enabled.\n\n136\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.490\nNo big deal, that's not a problem for\nus, just a warning, but\n\n137\n00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.140\nother than that perfectly fine.\n\n138\n00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.270\nSo that's all been done, that's good,\njust going to minimize PowerShell.\n\n139\n00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.780\nAnd what we're going to\ndo is now come over here,\n\n140\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.610\nwe're going to go to our setup item,\nour setup.exe.\n\n141\n00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.290\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\nrun MSI we're going to run this,\n\n142\n00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.730\nright click, run as Administrator.\n\n143\n00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.040\nAnd we're gonna load and run, spring that\nup in the middle of the screen there.\n\n144\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.620\nWe're gonna load and run the SCOM\n2012 R2 Ops manager install window.\n\n145\n00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.250\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna get started with our install.\n\n146\n00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.330\nNow keep in mind, we've pointed this\nout in some of the other demos as well,\n\n147\n00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.440\nwe have that option to download latest\nupdates for the Center program.\n\n148\n00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.680\nWanna opt in on that, remember that\nis not the same thing as going out to\n\n149\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.980\nMicrosoft and\ndownloading security updates.\n\n150\n00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:41.620\nThat is, I wanna download any updates to\nthe SCOM 2012 R2 ops manager software,\n\n151\n00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.850\nand make sure I'm downloading and\ninstalling the most recent version.\n\n152\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.010\nThis is typically gonna be roll\nup updates or things like that.\n\n153\n00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.310\nThey made them put out since the iso\nwas actually standardized and\n\n154\n00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.070\npushed out, right?\n\n155\n00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.811\nSo always good to do that so\nwe get the latest version.\n\n156\n00:07:54.811 --> 00:07:58.139\nSo we're gonna do that, we're then gonna\ngo ahead, we're gonna click install.\n\n157\n00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:00.121\nWe'll let that go out\ntake a look real quick.\n\n158\n00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:02.201\nIt's gonna download or Check for updates.\n\n159\n00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:04.698\nWe may or may not get any just\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n160\n00:08:04.698 --> 00:08:07.780\nSo once we have that finish\ndoesn't take too long.\n\n161\n00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.100\nOnce that's done, we'll then be able\nto select our features to install.\n\n162\n00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.860\nSo we'll see that roll over.\n\n163\n00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.530\nAnd we have our options here.\n\n164\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.240\nNow we talked about in the overview\nin the administration episodes.\n\n165\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.088\nThe very beginning set of\nepisodes we put together for\n\n166\n00:08:23.088 --> 00:08:28.060\nthis overall show, that we have\ndifferent moving parts and pieces.\n\n167\n00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.980\nAnd if you remember,\nin our picture that we looked at,\n\n168\n00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.270\nlet me just bring that up real quick so\nwe can just take a look,\n\n169\n00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.165\nour standard [COUGH] Little graphics\nfile that I put together for you.\n\n170\n00:08:38.165 --> 00:08:41.595\nYou'll see that we've talked about,\nextensively, right?\n\n171\n00:08:41.595 --> 00:08:44.825\nOur agents that we're gonna deploy for\nmonitoring, talking about our gateway\n\n172\n00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:48.375\nserver, we talked about our management\nserver or servers in a pool.\n\n173\n00:08:48.375 --> 00:08:51.595\nTalked about our databases that\nwill be created and set up.\n\n174\n00:08:51.595 --> 00:08:54.675\nWe've talked about our Ops console,\nour web console,\n\n175\n00:08:54.675 --> 00:08:58.260\nour application monitoring consoles,\nand our reporting server.\n\n176\n00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.400\nSo we have all these different moving\nparts that we're gonna start to see\n\n177\n00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.040\nthe options for install, at least most of\nthem anyway are gonna be on that screen.\n\n178\n00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.650\nAnd what you're gonna see is we have\nthe management server option there.\n\n179\n00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.890\nWe'll go back to it in a minute.\n\n180\n00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.800\nWe have the Ops Console option there.\n\n181\n00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.670\nAnd we talked about In the,\nhey what's the order?\n\n182\n00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.520\nWhat's the priority order for install?\n\n183\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.000\nDiscussion, the fact that we would\ndo our first management server and\n\n184\n00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.850\nwe could opt in to do the Ops\nconsole at that point.\n\n185\n00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.320\nOr just install the management server, and\n\n186\n00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.710\nthen do the Ops console at\na different time, right?\n\n187\n00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.940\nEither step one, do it all together.\n\n188\n00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:34.590\nStep one without the console then step two\nin our process was, do secondary servers.\n\n189\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.860\nAgain ops console and\noptions there are not.\n\n190\n00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.880\nWe didn't do it there.\n\n191\n00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.510\nOur step three was do the ops console by\nitself after the fact we could do that or\n\n192\n00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.840\nnot, it will be up to us.\n\n193\n00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.910\nWe have the web console.\n\n194\n00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.830\nWe talked about installing that\nseparately that will be an option.\n\n195\n00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.920\nAnd you'll see the reporting servers,\nand option there is well.\n\n196\n00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.040\nAnd we'll be able to install and configure\nthat, but we'll do that separately.\n\n197\n00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.700\nSo what we're gonna do is comeback here,\nwe have our management server and\n\n198\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.600\nour Ops Console.\n\n199\n00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.320\nWe're gonna choose both here and\ndo them at the same time.\n\n200\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.880\nSo, I'm gonna opt in and\ndo one and the other.\n\n201\n00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.930\nWe're then gonna go ahead and just take\na look at, before we actually continue\n\n202\n00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:13.040\nthe install, this item on the left here,\nwhich says important configurations.\n\n203\n00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.820\nAnd you could take a look if\nyou're not sure about this.\n\n204\n00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.830\nAnd click here,\nwe'll just do that real quick.\n\n205\n00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.490\nIt opens up the website, where it goes\nout to the web, opens up a website,\n\n206\n00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.990\nyou gotta be connected to web\nobviously for this to work.\n\n207\n00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.380\nAnd it takes you out, and it will give\nyou a link to a page, where support and\n\n208\n00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.480\nconfigurations are gonna be\ndiscussed by build and version.\n\n209\n00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.370\nSo if you're not clear on\nsure about what to do,\n\n210\n00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.140\nwhat order to do it in,\nhow you install, what can be done, etc.\n\n211\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.480\nIf you don't remember that,\nyou haven't seen that episode,\n\n212\n00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.710\nthat series of discussions,\nget this information.\n\n213\n00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.730\nMake sure you're up to date.\n\n214\n00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:51.160\nThe nice thing about that also If we\nchange the rules of the game along the way\n\n215\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.400\nand Microsoft updates the requirements,\nclicking there will give\n\n216\n00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.560\nyou the most recent information as\nopposed to what we may have talked about\n\n217\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.180\nwhen we put these episodes together,\nmaybe now it's six months, a year later,\n\n218\n00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.080\nwho knows how long it is\nwith you watching this now.\n\n219\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.460\nAnd you may be seeing this but we may\nhave changed Use parameter since then.\n\n220\n00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.270\nSo it's good to check the most recent\ninformation just to point that out to you.\n\n221\n00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.930\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Next here.\n\n222\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.840\nWe're then gonna get our install location.\n\n223\n00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.400\nStandard install location.\n\n224\n00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.270\nWe will leave the defaults there but\n\n225\n00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.250\nyou'll see C/Program Files Microsoft\nsystem center 2012 R2,\n\n226\n00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.160\nOps manager in this case, instead of\none of the other programs we looked at.\n\n227\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.980\nRequired space, roughly just over a gig.\n\n228\n00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.570\nYou'll see 1,305 megabytes, so be just\nover a gig, about a gig and a third,\n\n229\n00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.340\napproximately, something like that.\n\n230\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.640\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n231\n00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.150\nWe'll click next,\nverifies quickly that we're all set to go.\n\n232\n00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.410\nProceed with setup, so we're gonna\nthen be able to go in and click next.\n\n233\n00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.700\nAll prerequisites are passed.\n\n234\n00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.120\nNow this was just the prereq check, right?\n\n235\n00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.710\nThis was just saying is all\nthe software installed?\n\n236\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:53.690\nEverything we need there.\n\n237\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.350\nAre we sure we have everything we need?\n\n238\n00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:59.750\nIf we're not sure what those are right\nhere, review full system requirements.\n\n239\n00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.150\nGo and check that link out again.\n\n240\n00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.660\nThe most recent information would\nalways be available there over the web.\n\n241\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.910\nGonna click next here.\n\n242\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.950\nNow we have to specify an install option.\n\n243\n00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.580\nWe have to specify here\nwhat we're gonna do or\n\n244\n00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.080\nessentially how we're gonna install,\nright?\n\n245\n00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.810\nAre we gonna create the first management\ngroup server in a new management group?\n\n246\n00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.850\nThis is the first server installed.\n\n247\n00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.900\nCreate the management group.\n\n248\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.970\nWe have to name it.\n\n249\n00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.160\nAnd specify the database location.\n\n250\n00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.040\nAll those things we talked about in\nthe episode that are specific to\n\n251\n00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.380\nthe first install.\n\n252\n00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.810\nOr are we gonna add a management server to\nan existing management group that will be\n\n253\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.870\nthe option below.\n\n254\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.110\nWe've already done that, setup\nthe management group done this already.\n\n255\n00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.220\nThis will be adding additional servers.\n\n256\n00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.380\nInto the management group.\n\n257\n00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.000\nThis gonna be a second, third,\nfourth server et cetera.\n\n258\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.650\nAnd we would then make a different set of\nchoices cause we have to provide the name\n\n259\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.850\nof the management group and\n\n260\n00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.070\nuse the existing data bases\nthat are already there.\n\n261\n00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.690\nSo that's setup and look different\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n262\n00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:55.290\nThis is our first install so we're going\nto choose the default option on top and\n\n263\n00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.400\nwe're gonna give our\nmanagement group a name.\n\n264\n00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.800\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna name this.\n\n265\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.400\nAnd we could call this anything we'd want.\n\n266\n00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.220\nIf you have a naming convention\nin your organization,\n\n267\n00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.820\nyou would wanna follow that, right?\n\n268\n00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:12.306\nI'm gonna use our practise labs,\nPRACTICELABSCOM,\n\n269\n00:13:12.306 --> 00:13:17.190\ngroup name for our management group.\n\n270\n00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.320\nSo we're gonna use that,\nthat's our domain that we're using.\n\n271\n00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.350\nWe're just kinda keeping everything\nstandardized for ease of use and\n\n272\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.820\nease of reference in the demo.\n\n273\n00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.360\nBut in the real world,\nof course, as I said,\n\n274\n00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.220\nyou would specify what it is\nthat you would like to use.\n\n275\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.250\nSo we have PRACTICELABSCOM, no dot.\n\n276\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.680\nMake sure that's spelled\ncorrectly Hit next here.\n\n277\n00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.180\nWe get our ULA, or user license agreement.\n\n278\n00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.640\nGoing to go ahead and click that.\n\n279\n00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.705\nAnd now I'm not going to scroll down.\n\n280\n00:13:40.705 --> 00:13:42.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to use my super powers and\n\n281\n00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.860\nread the whole thing without\nhaving to go through that.\n\n282\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.600\n&gt;&gt; Use osmosis.\n\n283\n00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.800\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to use just the ability\nto observe that information\n\n284\n00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.060\nwithout having to go through it and\nactually look at it.\n\n285\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.670\nSo this is where the magic happens.\n\n286\n00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.180\nConfigure the operational database.\n\n287\n00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.260\nRemember, two databases here, right?\n\n288\n00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.600\nLet's just remind ourselves\nquickly what this looks like.\n\n289\n00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.480\nWe have our ops manager database, that's\nwhat we call the operational database.\n\n290\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.810\nAnd we have our ops\nmanager data warehouse.\n\n291\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.070\nWe're working on this one right now,\nthe ops manager database.\n\n292\n00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.020\nThat's the one we're about to configure\nand specify the settings for.\n\n293\n00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:16.300\nSo we're gonna go in here,\nserver name and or instance name.\n\n294\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.010\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna set this up.\n\n295\n00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.860\nNow keep in mind, right?\n\n296\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.980\nThat when we're in here and\nwe're looking at this.\n\n297\n00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.240\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe are going to use our local instance.\n\n298\n00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.690\nWe've said in the beginning of the episode\nwe're gonna use the all-in-one install.\n\n299\n00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.750\nLocal instance of MS SQL\nserver on the machine.\n\n300\n00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.920\nSo ours is gonna look a little bit\ndifferent than what you would probably\n\n301\n00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.650\nuse in the real world.\n\n302\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:42.680\nBecause you may be connecting out to an\ninstance that's set up in a SQL cluster,\n\n303\n00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.120\nor that the DBA may have set up for you.\n\n304\n00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.890\nSo yours will probably look\ndifferent when you do this, but for\n\n305\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.490\npurposes of our discussion,\nour demonstration,\n\n306\n00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.710\nwe're just doing this all in one quick\ndemo, putting it all together for you.\n\n307\n00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.750\nSo I'm gonna use the MS SQL\nserver that's local.\n\n308\n00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.010\nSo I'm gonna type in\nthe name of the machine.\n\n309\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.870\nPlay or plab rather.\n\n310\n00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:06.841\nSpell that correctly,\nnot pal, plabsysbuild01,\n\n311\n00:15:06.841 --> 00:15:10.739\nplabsysbuild01, plabsysbuild01.\n\n312\n00:15:10.739 --> 00:15:11.570\nThat's the name for our local machine.\n\n313\n00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:19.140\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and put on\nthe name of our instance MS SQL server.\n\n314\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.501\nHave our standard port there,\nwhich Daniel knows is port-\n\n315\n00:15:22.501 --> 00:15:23.599\n&gt;&gt; 1433.\n\n316\n00:15:23.599 --> 00:15:24.620\n&gt;&gt; 1433, absolutely.\n\n317\n00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.760\nAnd then you'll see,\ncan we go full screen for just a second?\n\n318\n00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.070\nJust to show you all this.\n\n319\n00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.640\nYou'll see we have our named instance.\n\n320\n00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.230\nWe have our port.\n\n321\n00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.480\nI just wanted to just see\nthe name of t he database here.\n\n322\n00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.210\nDatabase name,\n\n323\n00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:38.260\noperations manager, standard size\ncan modify that if necessary.\n\n324\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.220\nBut this is our ops manager\ndatabase as opposed to the data\n\n325\n00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.600\nwarehouse database, right.\n\n326\n00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.190\nAnd then we have our data file folder,\nlog file folder.\n\n327\n00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.145\nStandard default install,\n\n328\n00:15:47.145 --> 00:15:52.931\nProgram Files\\Microsoft SQL\nServer\\MSSQL11\\MSSQLSERVER\\MSSQL\\DATA,\n\n329\n00:15:52.931 --> 00:15:53.506\nright?\n\n330\n00:15:53.506 --> 00:15:55.083\nAnd then we're gonna install\ninto that directory.\n\n331\n00:15:55.083 --> 00:15:58.424\nWe're gonna leave all of\nthose defaults alone and\n\n332\n00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:02.172\nIn the real world again,\nyou may choose to modify that.\n\n333\n00:16:02.172 --> 00:16:04.580\nThat will be up to you but\nwe're gonna leave those alone.\n\n334\n00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.720\nWe're then gonna have the option,\n\n335\n00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.290\non the next screen,\nto configure the data warehouse database.\n\n336\n00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.743\nSo, part two of our conversation.\n\n337\n00:16:10.743 --> 00:16:11.738\nSo, we're gonna click Next here.\n\n338\n00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:14.543\nAnd what I'm a ctually gonna do\nthe following, just before we do that.\n\n339\n00:16:14.543 --> 00:16:15.793\nI'm gonna cheat a little bit.\n\n340\n00:16:15.793 --> 00:16:16.705\nI'm gonna copy that so\n\n341\n00:16:16.705 --> 00:16:19.262\nthat I don't have to worry about\nactually typing it out again.\n\n342\n00:16:19.262 --> 00:16:21.204\nBecause if I got it right the first time,\n\n343\n00:16:21.204 --> 00:16:23.730\nI'm going to assume hopefully\nthat it will be good.\n\n344\n00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.160\nSo we're gonna click Next.\n\n345\n00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.927\nWe'll check that right now,\nthat looks good.\n\n346\n00:16:26.927 --> 00:16:29.880\nSo what I'm gonna do is for\nthe data warehouse database,\n\n347\n00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.241\nI'm gonna paste that in.\n\n348\n00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:34.002\nSo I don't bother typing it again,\nbut assume I typed it in.\n\n349\n00:16:34.002 --> 00:16:38.275\nAnd you'll see format server name, it just\nchecks to make sure we can get out there.\n\n350\n00:16:38.275 --> 00:16:41.113\nWe're then gonna be able to go ahead.\n\n351\n00:16:41.113 --> 00:16:43.914\nAnd you'll see we have, and again if we\ncould just go full screen for a minute,\n\n352\n00:16:43.914 --> 00:16:46.280\njust to show you what the naming\nconvention looks like.\n\n353\n00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.317\nOps Manager DW,\nthat will be our data warehouse database,\n\n354\n00:16:49.317 --> 00:16:51.090\nas opposed to our other database.\n\n355\n00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.285\nSame path, cuz we're installing locally.\n\n356\n00:16:53.285 --> 00:16:57.221\nAnd so what we're doing now is we're\nworking on this database right here on\n\n357\n00:16:57.221 --> 00:17:00.107\nthe right,\nthe Ops Manager Data Warehouse database.\n\n358\n00:17:00.107 --> 00:17:04.425\nThe DW for Data Warehouse, that's the one\nwe're gonna finish configuring right now.\n\n359\n00:17:04.425 --> 00:17:07.870\nAnd as soon as we're done,\nwe're gonna actually then go ahead and\n\n360\n00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.645\nget ready to do our install.\n\n361\n00:17:09.645 --> 00:17:13.155\nSo we're gonna do this,\nget this spun up, hit Next.\n\n362\n00:17:13.155 --> 00:17:15.945\nNotice we're almost done,\nwe've still got a couple of bars here,\n\n363\n00:17:15.945 --> 00:17:17.020\nnot quite there yet.\n\n364\n00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.030\nRemember we also need to specify\ncuz this is our first install.\n\n365\n00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.550\nWe have to specify our various accounts.\n\n366\n00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.960\nRemember we have four different kinds\nof accounts or types that we specify.\n\n367\n00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.990\nWe've got our management\nserver action account.\n\n368\n00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.250\nWe've got our\nSystem Center Config server and\n\n369\n00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.270\nSystem Center Data Access service account.\n\n370\n00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.660\nWe've got our Data Reader and\nData Writer account.\n\n371\n00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.940\nNow we've talked extensively\nabout these accounts.\n\n372\n00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.870\nWhat permission levels they need,\nwhether they are domain and/or local.\n\n373\n00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.705\nHow we configure all\nthat in prior episodes.\n\n374\n00:17:45.705 --> 00:17:49.259\nSo just reminding you that we've been\nthrough all of these when we walked\n\n375\n00:17:49.259 --> 00:17:51.369\nthrough the logic of\nhow to do the install.\n\n376\n00:17:51.369 --> 00:17:54.050\nAnd what it is that we would do and\nthe order we would do it in.\n\n377\n00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:58.920\nBut because this is our first management\nserver, we have to specify all of these.\n\n378\n00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.205\nIf this was the second\nmanagement server and\n\n379\n00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:04.190\nwe were already joining\nan existing management group.\n\n380\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.710\nWe would be able to either already\nhave some of this populated, or\n\n381\n00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.290\nperhaps not have to specify all it,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n382\n00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.150\nSo we're gonna start typing these in.\n\n383\n00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.350\nNotice the option here for\nlocal and or domain account for\n\n384\n00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.320\nthree of the four selected as domain.\n\n385\n00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.020\nNotice that for\nthe system center config and\n\n386\n00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.360\ndata access service accounts,\nthey're set to local by default, right?\n\n387\n00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.700\nBecause we're gonna use the local\naccount for that on the system.\n\n388\n00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:36.120\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and we're\ngoing to type in here, our information.\n\n389\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.850\nAnd we'll do practice labs, and\nthen that's the name of our domain.\n\n390\n00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.410\nAnd then we're gonna do administrator.\n\n391\n00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.307\nSo we're going to do our\ndomain admin account.\n\n392\n00:18:46.307 --> 00:18:50.942\nNow remember in the real world you would\nnot choose to use your domain admin\n\n393\n00:18:50.942 --> 00:18:51.625\naccount.\n\n394\n00:18:51.625 --> 00:18:53.612\nAs the account that you're\ngoing to be using for this.\n\n395\n00:18:53.612 --> 00:18:56.960\nYou would come up with a set of accounts\nthat would be given the specific\n\n396\n00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.219\npermissions necessary.\n\n397\n00:18:58.219 --> 00:19:01.891\nWe're doing that in the demo just for\npurposes of ease of use and\n\n398\n00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.009\nto keep it simple.\n\n399\n00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:06.018\nSo we don't have to keep track of all\nthese different accounts while we're doing\n\n400\n00:19:06.018 --> 00:19:06.870\nthe install.\n\n401\n00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.120\nBut in the real world,\n\n402\n00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.060\nyou would wanna make sure you're using\na separate account for that, right?\n\n403\n00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.850\nWe're gonna go ahead, we're gonna put in,\n\n404\n00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.150\nlet me just make sure\nI type that correctly.\n\n405\n00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.870\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nput in our password.\n\n406\n00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.850\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do the same thing here for\n\n407\n00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.940\nthe Data Reader and\nthe Data Writer account.\n\n408\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.120\nSo we're gonna go down here, and\n\n409\n00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.470\nwe're going to make sure that we put\nthat same account in for all three.\n\n410\n00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.630\nLet me just do that real quick.\n\n411\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.493\nGonna use our, whoops, hold on,\nthat's not what I wanted to copy.\n\n412\n00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:41.970\nOkay, let's type it in.\n\n413\n00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.316\n&gt;&gt; When all else fails, right, the old\nkeyboard is waiting to work for us.\n\n414\n00:19:46.316 --> 00:19:47.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wanted to copy that.\n\n415\n00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.770\nYou saw me copy it, but it copied\nsomething totally different, all right.\n\n416\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.230\n&gt;&gt; Computers hate us Adam,\nhow many times do I have to tell you?\n\n417\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.690\n&gt;&gt; When they take over the world,\nI'm just going to-\n\n418\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:56.800\n&gt;&gt; We'll enjoy fighting them.\n\n419\n00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.702\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm gonna unplug them.\n\n420\n00:19:57.702 --> 00:20:00.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're just gonna unplug them,\npull their batteries out.\n\n421\n00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.373\n&gt;&gt; Let me just do that, get rid of that.\n\n422\n00:20:03.373 --> 00:20:08.285\nAnd let me just do this real quick\njust to get that out of the way.\n\n423\n00:20:08.285 --> 00:20:09.506\nThere we go.\n\n424\n00:20:09.506 --> 00:20:10.670\nThat way that doesn't bother us.\n\n425\n00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:16.565\nAll right, so\nJust typed in our password in there and\n\n426\n00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:18.430\nmake sure we type that correctly.\n\n427\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.256\nAnd then, let's go down here and\n\n428\n00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:29.548\nlet's do practicelabs\\administrator.\n\n429\n00:20:29.548 --> 00:20:31.493\nAnd then our password here.\n\n430\n00:20:34.722 --> 00:20:39.370\nAll right, so we've got our account set\nup, our password's entered correctly.\n\n431\n00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.100\nHopefully everything is\nconfigured the right way.\n\n432\n00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.560\nOnce we've got all that set up,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n433\n00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.550\nwe're just gonna pause for a second,\nverify that, make sure we're all good.\n\n434\n00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:54.140\nAnd then, once we're all set and\nready to go, we are gonna click Next.\n\n435\n00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.860\nNow we get this little pop-up here.\n\n436\n00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.520\nCan we go full-screen to see that?\n\n437\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.770\nWe're gonna see it says,\nsetup detected that the action account\n\n438\n00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.230\nspecified is a domain\nadministrator account.\n\n439\n00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.247\nI told you that's not a good idea,\ndon't wanna do that in the real world.\n\n440\n00:21:07.247 --> 00:21:08.643\nWe warn you about that.\n\n441\n00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:10.957\nIt says, for\nsecurity reasons not recommended.\n\n442\n00:21:10.957 --> 00:21:12.615\nI said not the best practice.\n\n443\n00:21:12.615 --> 00:21:15.006\nWe're doing it just for\nease of demonstration,\n\n444\n00:21:15.006 --> 00:21:16.475\nease of use here in this demo.\n\n445\n00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:18.268\nIn the real world this I suggested.\n\n446\n00:21:18.268 --> 00:21:24.083\nMake sure that you don't use the domain\naccount for your installation.\n\n447\n00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:25.001\nBut for here it's fine.\n\n448\n00:21:25.001 --> 00:21:26.945\nWe note that we know that's an issue.\n\n449\n00:21:26.945 --> 00:21:28.620\nWe're accepting that risk.\n\n450\n00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.660\nJust because we're setting this\nup to show you how to do it.\n\n451\n00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.340\nIn the real world,\n\n452\n00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.260\nif you don't use a domain admin\naccount you will not see that prompt.\n\n453\n00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.900\nWe're gonna go ahead and opt out of the\ncustomer experience improvement program.\n\n454\n00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.980\nAnd the error reporting, in the real world\nI encourage you to opt into both of these.\n\n455\n00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.336\nWe're gonna click Next, and\n\n456\n00:21:46.336 --> 00:21:51.244\nonce we do that we are going to\nmake sure it took my click there.\n\n457\n00:21:51.244 --> 00:21:51.850\nThere we go.\n\n458\n00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.750\nWe're gonna get our install summary.\n\n459\n00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:57.030\nAgain, thinking about the fact that\nthis may be a good opportunity for\n\n460\n00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.550\nyou to grab a screenshot.\n\n461\n00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.810\nThis will probably be two because of\nthe fact that you have to scroll.\n\n462\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:04.270\nBut grab a screenshot of this,\ndocument it so you know what you're doing.\n\n463\n00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.760\nOnce you've done all that we're gonna\ngo ahead, we're gonna click Install.\n\n464\n00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.390\nWe're gonna let that run.\n\n465\n00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.454\nThat is gonna take\na little bit of time for\n\n466\n00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:12.530\nus to actually get through the install.\n\n467\n00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.272\nSo we're gonna wait for\nthat to finish and then come on back and\n\n468\n00:22:15.272 --> 00:22:16.282\nshow you the results.\n\n469\n00:22:16.282 --> 00:22:19.972\nBut just before we cut away to do that,\nyou'll notice initial config,\n\n470\n00:22:19.972 --> 00:22:22.446\noperational database configuration starts.\n\n471\n00:22:22.446 --> 00:22:23.800\nAnd then we're gonna go through that.\n\n472\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.799\nBut then the management server itself,\nthen the data warehouse config,\n\n473\n00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:30.589\nthen the operations console,\nthen final config.\n\n474\n00:22:30.589 --> 00:22:34.976\nSo we're doing this in a specified order\nto ensure we understand how things\n\n475\n00:22:34.976 --> 00:22:36.519\nare actually gonna work.\n\n476\n00:22:36.519 --> 00:22:40.140\nAnd to make sure we understand the order\nthat they have to do be done in.\n\n477\n00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.038\nIt's the same order we discussed when we\nwent through the episodes talking about\n\n478\n00:22:43.038 --> 00:22:44.290\nhow things would work.\n\n479\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.240\nSo stay tuned.\n\n480\n00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.180\nAs soon as this finishes up,\n\n481\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.560\nwe'll come on back and we'll show you\nwhat the rest of the demo looks like.\n\n482\n00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.880\nSo we see that our\ninstallation is finished.\n\n483\n00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.650\nWhat we're gonna do is just quickly check,\n\n484\n00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.830\nmake sure we see that\neverything turned out well.\n\n485\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.299\nWe just see a little warning off there\nto the left of the management server.\n\n486\n00:22:59.299 --> 00:23:01.165\nBut when you read it,\nall it really says is hey,\n\n487\n00:23:01.165 --> 00:23:02.717\nwe're installing as an eval edition.\n\n488\n00:23:02.717 --> 00:23:05.550\nJust again, reminding us we\nhaven't licensed the product.\n\n489\n00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.330\nNo big deal, we know that's the case,\nand we're fine with that.\n\n490\n00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.960\nOther than that,\neverything is green, all looks good.\n\n491\n00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.230\nWe'll scroll down here just so\nyou could see the very bottom item.\n\n492\n00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.274\nAnd you'll see everything is good there.\n\n493\n00:23:15.274 --> 00:23:18.885\nWe do have our check boxes at the bottom,\nlaunch Microsoft Update.\n\n494\n00:23:18.885 --> 00:23:22.130\nWhen the wizard closes make sure we're\nup to date, we have all the patches.\n\n495\n00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:23.450\nWe know the value of that.\n\n496\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.800\nStart the Ops console\nwhen the wizard closes.\n\n497\n00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.210\nWe could go ahead and\neither leave that in there or\n\n498\n00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.550\nuse the short cut that's gonna\nbe created from the app on sure.\n\n499\n00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.830\nIt's up to us to decide.\n\n500\n00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.220\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll let that launch for us this time.\n\n501\n00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.590\nSo we hit Close, we'll have that come up.\n\n502\n00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.460\nTakes just a moment to bring\nthe console up the first time.\n\n503\n00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.542\nOnce we get that up and running,\nwe can go full screen for just a moment.\n\n504\n00:23:44.542 --> 00:23:47.864\nJust wanna quickly zero you\nin on the environment here.\n\n505\n00:23:47.864 --> 00:23:51.562\nThis is the first time you're getting\nto see the actual console in our\n\n506\n00:23:51.562 --> 00:23:52.535\nconversations.\n\n507\n00:23:52.535 --> 00:23:53.713\nWe're gonna be coming in,\n\n508\n00:23:53.713 --> 00:23:56.695\nspending a lot more time in here\nthroughout the remaining episodes.\n\n509\n00:23:56.695 --> 00:23:59.741\nAs we configure and\ninteract with various workspaces But\n\n510\n00:23:59.741 --> 00:24:03.169\njust to show you quickly what we have,\nwe have four workspaces,\n\n511\n00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:07.060\nthese are the areas down here that\nwe are gonna be interacting with.\n\n512\n00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.940\nYou'll see we have Monitoring,\nwe have Auditing or excuse me,\n\n513\n00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.230\nAuthoring, pardon me.\n\n514\n00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.960\nWe have Administration and\nwe have the My Workspace area.\n\n515\n00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.910\nMy Workspace is where you can customize\nand configure your own views,\n\n516\n00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:22.640\ncreate your own little kind of\ncomfortable working area if you will, so\n\n517\n00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.610\nyou can customize the look and feel.\n\n518\n00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:28.740\nAdministration is where we spend\ntime configuring the settings,\n\n519\n00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.890\nmaking sure we understand what has to\nhappen for the system to run correctly,\n\n520\n00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:37.690\nour device management, agent versus\nagentless manage, our management servers\n\n521\n00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:42.310\nare found here, our pending management\ninstalls, if we have any agents that\n\n522\n00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:45.530\nhave been manually installed and\nhave to be approved will be found here.\n\n523\n00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.030\nWe talked about that in\none of our prior episodes.\n\n524\n00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:52.265\nOur Unix Linux computers if we're\nmonitoring alternate operating systems.\n\n525\n00:24:52.265 --> 00:24:53.750\nStacks will be found here.\n\n526\n00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:54.880\nWe have our management packs.\n\n527\n00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.718\nWe'll spend some time in here taking\na look at how to create management packs\n\n528\n00:24:59.718 --> 00:25:01.996\nfrom scratch or use existing ones.\n\n529\n00:25:01.996 --> 00:25:06.049\nWhen we do our install, the management\npacks that are already configured or\n\n530\n00:25:06.049 --> 00:25:09.720\nset up as part of our install will\nbe available, they're imported,\n\n531\n00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.836\nand you could see the list of them here.\n\n532\n00:25:11.836 --> 00:25:14.583\nSo, we have all of those and\nwe can obviously go and work with them.\n\n533\n00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:16.956\nWe have 95 out of the box by default.\n\n534\n00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:21.352\nWe'll add to that if necessary by\ndownloading additional management packs\n\n535\n00:25:21.352 --> 00:25:25.270\nfrom other vendors or creating our own and\nthen working with them.\n\n536\n00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.710\nSo we'll be able to do\nthat in upcoming episodes.\n\n537\n00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.025\nNetwork management is gonna be found here,\n\n538\n00:25:30.025 --> 00:25:33.950\nwe'll be able to deal with our different\ndiscovery methodologies, and go out and\n\n539\n00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:37.220\nfind network devices and\nsystems that we wanna be able to manage.\n\n540\n00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.130\nWe'll be taking a look at that.\n\n541\n00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:41.990\nOur notifications areas here,\nsetting up our channels,\n\n542\n00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.410\nour subscriptions, and or our subscribers.\n\n543\n00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.940\nWe'll be talking about that, how we\ncommunicate, and get updates from SCOM.\n\n544\n00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.600\nSo, we'll be taking a look at that.\n\n545\n00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.140\nOur product connectors are here.\n\n546\n00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.410\nHow do we connect out to alternate systems\nand interact with them, and bring them in\n\n547\n00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.640\nso they can be monitored, or provide data\nto us for monitoring, through connections?\n\n548\n00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.040\nSo, we'll be talking\nabout that at some point.\n\n549\n00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.800\nWe have our resource pools, so\nif we setup our resource pool,\n\n550\n00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.500\nas we've been talking about, we'll be\nable to see it here and interact with it.\n\n551\n00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.710\nYou'll see that we have our\nAD Assignment Resource Pool,\n\n552\n00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:19.000\nour AR all Management Service Resource\nPool and Notifications Resource Pool\n\n553\n00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.430\nthrough resource pools that\nare installed out of the box by default.\n\n554\n00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.350\nWe'll then be able to go in and\nwork with these if necessary.\n\n555\n00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.460\nYou'll see we can right click here, and\nwe have options to be able to go in and\n\n556\n00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:33.225\ndo a variety of things based on what\nwe're doing in this particular area.\n\n557\n00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:37.785\nWe can also go in, and you'll see over\nhere, create a resource pool if necessary,\n\n558\n00:26:37.785 --> 00:26:42.075\nor create our own, and or manually provide\nmembership updates work with them.\n\n559\n00:26:42.075 --> 00:26:45.807\nAnd we'll go more into detail on\nsome of this in upcoming episodes.\n\n560\n00:26:45.807 --> 00:26:47.237\nThe run as configurations.\n\n561\n00:26:47.237 --> 00:26:50.107\nSo, our accounts that we're\ngonna be using are here.\n\n562\n00:26:50.107 --> 00:26:54.727\nThis is where our system action account\nand our admin account is gonna be found\n\n563\n00:26:54.727 --> 00:26:57.367\nalong with all the other\naccounts that we've specified.\n\n564\n00:26:57.367 --> 00:26:58.807\nSo we'll see those here.\n\n565\n00:26:58.807 --> 00:27:03.277\nWe have our profiles that are used to\nbe able to then create building blocks\n\n566\n00:27:03.277 --> 00:27:07.930\nthat we can assign user rights, delegate\nresponsibilities for administration.\n\n567\n00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.580\nWe have our Unix Linux accounts,\nwe're going to be interacting with\n\n568\n00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.450\nUnix Linux systems, so we need a separate\nset of run as accounts for them.\n\n569\n00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.660\nWe'll see them here,\nunder Security we have User Roles.\n\n570\n00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.045\nOur user roles are built\nfrom our profile so\n\n571\n00:27:20.045 --> 00:27:23.422\nwe're gonna be use those to be\nable to create a user role, and\n\n572\n00:27:23.422 --> 00:27:28.000\ndefine the activities that a user may\nengage in through a delegation event.\n\n573\n00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.285\nAnd so, we'll be able to go in,\ncreate a new user role, and specify,\n\n574\n00:27:31.285 --> 00:27:35.110\nyou'll see there operator, read-only,\nauthor, advanced operator, etc.\n\n575\n00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.870\nAnd we'll then be able to go in and\n\n576\n00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.480\nassign the user the appropriate rights,\nwe'll be able to do that.\n\n577\n00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.799\nWe see our settings here.\n\n578\n00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.040\nThese are settings for the system overall.\n\n579\n00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.820\nAnd we'll be able to go in, take a look\nat things like agent heartbeat, and\n\n580\n00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.100\nall of these will have\nproperties associated with them.\n\n581\n00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.380\nWhat's the interval on heart\nbeating from the agent?\n\n582\n00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.195\nSo how many second go by before\nwe update on a rolling basis?\n\n583\n00:27:58.195 --> 00:28:00.645\nSo we'll be able to\nmodify that if necessary.\n\n584\n00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:05.825\nWe could see our alert area here, go in\nand take a look at the various states and\n\n585\n00:28:05.825 --> 00:28:09.475\nIDs that are setup for\nalerts out of the box by default.\n\n586\n00:28:09.475 --> 00:28:14.175\nA resolved item you'll see here,\nresolution state is 254,\n\n587\n00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:15.905\nacknowledge 249, new 0.\n\n588\n00:28:15.905 --> 00:28:20.760\nSo we could set up alert resolution states\nand we'll see how to program in a new one.\n\n589\n00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.970\nIn one of our future discussions,\nwe'll simply come here and create our own.\n\n590\n00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.690\nWe also can see automatic\nalert resolution, and\n\n591\n00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.000\nremember we talked about these values\nin one of our prior episodes where\n\n592\n00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.770\nwe talked about some of the configuration\nsettings and things to do\n\n593\n00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:36.880\nout of the box once we get the install\ndone and maybe modifying these settings.\n\n594\n00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.100\nAnd I told you how to do this through\nPowerShell using one of the cmdlets, but\n\n595\n00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.870\nwe also could do it from here,\njust in the graphical interface.\n\n596\n00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:46.680\nWe would change that 30 day or\n7 day default and just go and\n\n597\n00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.940\nmodify it as needed.\n\n598\n00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.410\nSo we can do all that from here,\nif we decide to.\n\n599\n00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:54.100\nWe have our database grooming settings,\nwe talked about some of these as well,\n\n600\n00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.680\nI showed you the retention periods,\nthe default periods.\n\n601\n00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.250\nWe'd be able to go in and see those.\n\n602\n00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.770\nI created little a Word document table for\nyou that mirrored this exactly.\n\n603\n00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.290\nAnd we talked about modifying\nthese if necessary.\n\n604\n00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:10.470\nAgain, can do that, right from here as\nwe talked about and or from PowerShell,\n\n605\n00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:11.430\njust click Edit.\n\n606\n00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.310\nYou can go in, and from here, there we go.\n\n607\n00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:17.150\nSoon as that registers,\nwe can go in and there we go,\n\n608\n00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.650\nwe can actually get the item to come up.\n\n609\n00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:23.210\nIt's that double left tap click,\nright hand thing that we gotta do.\n\n610\n00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.330\nMy mouse is a little screwy sometimes,\ndoesn't always register the click.\n\n611\n00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.720\nAnd you could see that we're able to\nsimply, in the interface here, modify it.\n\n612\n00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.450\nWe did talk about the fact we could\ndo this through PowerShell as well.\n\n613\n00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:34.800\nSo we showed you how to do that.\n\n614\n00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.460\nSo you've got these settings here.\n\n615\n00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:41.450\nWe've got other things for\nthe general settings we have reporting,\n\n616\n00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.580\nwe have web addresses,\na variety of different things.\n\n617\n00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.230\nWe have our\nSystem Center Advisor area here.\n\n618\n00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.260\nWe can interact with that product and\nlook at some of the settings and\n\n619\n00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.570\nconfigurations.\n\n620\n00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.040\nWe have in the authoring workspace,\n\n621\n00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.860\nswitching up just a little bit,\nour ability,\n\n622\n00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.640\ncould we go back full screen just so you\ncould see this in a little more detail?\n\n623\n00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.540\nYou'll see that we have,\n\n624\n00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.210\nand we'll spend a significant\namount of time in here as well.\n\n625\n00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.940\nWe have our management pack objects, and\nwe wanna create a new management pack and\n\n626\n00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.020\npopulate it with a variety\nof different things.\n\n627\n00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.030\nAnd I've spoken about\nsome of these before.\n\n628\n00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:09.730\nWe'll see them here.\n\n629\n00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.740\nWe have attributes, monitors,\nobject discovery methods, overrides,\n\n630\n00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.550\nrules, service level tracking tasks and\nviews.\n\n631\n00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:20.140\nWe'll be able to right click, click New,\nand then create one or more of these.\n\n632\n00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.830\nAnd then attach them to a new management\npack that we've created inside\n\n633\n00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:24.970\nof the admin workspace.\n\n634\n00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.692\nAnd by doing that,\nwe populate our management pack and\n\n635\n00:30:27.692 --> 00:30:31.081\nthen we can export that management\npack and give it to others to use.\n\n636\n00:30:31.081 --> 00:30:33.236\nThat's what you're getting for\nChristmas by the way big guy.\n\n637\n00:30:33.236 --> 00:30:34.253\nI'm giving you a management pack.\n\n638\n00:30:34.253 --> 00:30:35.861\nSo, you're gonna get one of those.\n\n639\n00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:37.221\nSo, we'll show you how to do that.\n\n640\n00:30:37.221 --> 00:30:38.004\n&gt;&gt; You spoil me sir.\n\n641\n00:30:38.004 --> 00:30:40.040\n&gt;&gt; I do try, I do try.\n\n642\n00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.660\nWe have our distributed applications.\n\n643\n00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:45.900\nWe'll talk about the ability to be\nable to go in and take a look at this.\n\n644\n00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.520\nWe can right click,\ncreate a new distributed application,\n\n645\n00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.160\njust to give you a quick idea here.\n\n646\n00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.300\nThis is where we're gonna go in,\n\n647\n00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.138\nand most likely use one of\nthe templates that are set up here.\n\n648\n00:30:54.138 --> 00:30:59.680\nYou'll see .NET three tier application, a\nline of business web app, messaging blank,\n\n649\n00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.930\nwhich is really just a canvas that\nwe'll start dragging pieces on.\n\n650\n00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.760\nIf you're familiar with Orchestrator and\ndoing workflows, if you're familiar with\n\n651\n00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:11.590\nVisio and building diagrams and flows,\nand enabling them, same kind of concept,\n\n652\n00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.690\nwe'll be able to build out\nthe logic of our application here,\n\n653\n00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:19.250\nput in all the actual connectors and and\npieces, configure it out, set it up and\n\n654\n00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.980\nthen actually put it in, so to speak,\nand have it run live and monitor it.\n\n655\n00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.470\nAnd you'll see that we're able to attach\nit to the Management Pack and if we've\n\n656\n00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.900\ncreated our own Management Pack or custom\nManagement Pack, we'll be able to assign\n\n657\n00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.930\nthe distributed app to the Management Pack\nand have it monitor that application.\n\n658\n00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:38.200\nThis is actually the magic behind\nthe scenes that takes place to do this.\n\n659\n00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.080\nSo, we'll be going through and\ntalking through how to do this.\n\n660\n00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.190\nYou guys will actually see this\nin one of our upcoming episodes.\n\n661\n00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:45.435\nOnce we've done that,\n\n662\n00:31:45.435 --> 00:31:48.867\nwe've got our distributed\napplication designer sitting here.\n\n663\n00:31:48.867 --> 00:31:52.720\nJust so yo can see that, we'll pull\nthat right down below our little blue,\n\n664\n00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.222\nmythical floating box there, for\nour control panel inside the VM.\n\n665\n00:31:56.222 --> 00:31:58.456\nAnd you'll see that we can then go in and\n\n666\n00:31:58.456 --> 00:32:02.165\nwe'll be able to start building\nout objects and or the details.\n\n667\n00:32:02.165 --> 00:32:06.260\nAnd we could actually begin\nusing our object search and\n\n668\n00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.255\nall the various things we wanna do.\n\n669\n00:32:08.255 --> 00:32:11.030\nWe just go New here, specify real quick.\n\n670\n00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:16.298\nLet's just do a quick one just so\nyou can see what it looks like.\n\n671\n00:32:16.298 --> 00:32:19.300\nAnd then we'll use our 3-Tier.\n\n672\n00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:24.330\nAnd let's just choose our Defaults.\n\n673\n00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.550\nAnd let's click OK.\n\n674\n00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:30.128\nAnd you'll see now I get our design,\nand I get the pre-made template.\n\n675\n00:32:30.128 --> 00:32:33.760\nAnd then I can actually go in and\nI can start to add components.\n\n676\n00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.375\nAnd I can drag things out and\ndrop them on here.\n\n677\n00:32:36.375 --> 00:32:41.260\nAnd I can use all this different sliders\nto be able to build up the actual logic.\n\n678\n00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.180\nSo again, if you've used one of the\nMicrosoft products looks similar to this,\n\n679\n00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.880\nAccess Views or Report Builder,\nSQL Server reporting services,\n\n680\n00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.338\nif you use Report Designer,\nthey are similar.\n\n681\n00:32:51.338 --> 00:32:54.270\nThey're a grid-like function\nwhere you just attach things and\n\n682\n00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:55.150\nthen interact with them.\n\n683\n00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:56.870\nSo once we're done with that, we save it.\n\n684\n00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.760\nAnd then we add that to\nour management pack.\n\n685\n00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.340\nWe're not gonna do that right now,\nbut you get general idea here.\n\n686\n00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.480\nWe can also go in,\nuse our management pack templates,\n\n687\n00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.140\nour pre-built templates\nthat are available to us.\n\n688\n00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.660\nAnd so let's say we wanna use\na .NET application performance and\n\n689\n00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.948\nmonitoring template.\n\n690\n00:33:12.948 --> 00:33:16.985\nWe can right-click, add a monitoring\nwizard or use the add monitoring wizard.\n\n691\n00:33:16.985 --> 00:33:20.840\nWe'll be able to add this monitor\ninto our management pack and\n\n692\n00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.370\nbind it there,\nspecifying what it is we wanna do.\n\n693\n00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.150\nSo we'll choose that there.\n\n694\n00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.270\nAnd then what we'll do here real quick,\nlet me just hide the task bar so\n\n695\n00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.290\nwe can see that, because this particular\nwindow has a nasty habit of just coming\n\n696\n00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:38.180\nup, being just big enough that we\ncan't actually see it, normally.\n\n697\n00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.930\nSo we're gonna click Next.\n\n698\n00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:41.867\nAnd then as you could see\nwe'll give it a name.\n\n699\n00:33:46.644 --> 00:33:47.433\nAnd then here,\n\n700\n00:33:47.433 --> 00:33:50.840\nwe'll again choose our management\npack that we want to bind it to.\n\n701\n00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.660\nIn our demo when we do it for real,\nwe'll actually go through and\n\n702\n00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.410\nhave a custom management pack we'll\nbind it to, and we'll do all that.\n\n703\n00:33:56.410 --> 00:34:00.800\nBut you could see then,\nwe go ahead and we click Next.\n\n704\n00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.740\nAnd then, once we've done that,\nwe'll be able to go ahead and\n\n705\n00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.240\nadd in our application components,\nspecify our targeted group, set up and\n\n706\n00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.500\nspecify our server-side configuration\nin this particular template.\n\n707\n00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.610\nSet up the monitoring.\n\n708\n00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:14.280\nWe'll be able to bind that\nto our management pack.\n\n709\n00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:14.907\nAnd again,\n\n710\n00:34:14.907 --> 00:34:19.248\nthe management pack becomes the container\nthat allows us to monitor everything.\n\n711\n00:34:19.248 --> 00:34:22.810\nAnd we're setting up the individual\ncomponent parts of that using\n\n712\n00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:27.199\nthe authoring work space so that as we\nbuild out our necessary functionality, and\n\n713\n00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:30.696\nwe add the things that we need to do,\nwe're able to track those and\n\n714\n00:34:30.696 --> 00:34:35.212\nuse the management pack to assign those\nspecific necessary objects, properties,\n\n715\n00:34:35.212 --> 00:34:37.660\nfunctions, all the stuff we want to do.\n\n716\n00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.330\nSo all that takes place in authoring.\n\n717\n00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:44.960\nIn the monitoring workspace we're\nable to go in and actually engage in\n\n718\n00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.930\nthe specific work, or see the outcome of\nspecific monitoring that's taking place.\n\n719\n00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:51.890\nSo we're actually using SCOM to drive.\n\n720\n00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:56.790\nSo if we go full-screen, we can see here\nwe've got our action alerts over all,\n\n721\n00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.100\nour active alerts that\nare running in the system.\n\n722\n00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.310\nWe may or not have anything right now.\n\n723\n00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.720\nRight now,\nwe're clean cuz we just installed.\n\n724\n00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.670\nWe've got our discovered inventory.\n\n725\n00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.750\nWithout having anything, with agents\nrunning, the only we see is ourselves.\n\n726\n00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.490\nSo we can see that we're there, and\nwe seem to be healthy for the moment.\n\n727\n00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:13.880\nThat's a big relief, right?\n\n728\n00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.060\nAlways good to know that.\n\n729\n00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.010\nWe don't have any distributed\napplications other than our standard Ops\n\n730\n00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.500\nmanager management group.\n\n731\n00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.670\nSo that's, again, just out of the box\nby default what we would see.\n\n732\n00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:25.510\nThe ops manager management group\nbecomes the distributed app\n\n733\n00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:26.425\nthat we are monitoring.\n\n734\n00:35:26.425 --> 00:35:29.700\nWe're monitoring all the health of\nall the component parts in there.\n\n735\n00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.340\nSo we're able to see that.\n\n736\n00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.270\nAnd we have tasks associated\nwith that on the bar over here.\n\n737\n00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.120\nAnd they change, they're contextual.\n\n738\n00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.150\nThe navigation elements change as well.\n\n739\n00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.975\nOur default views are there.\n\n740\n00:35:40.975 --> 00:35:45.268\nWe have our six default views off on\nthe lower right under our navigation\n\n741\n00:35:45.268 --> 00:35:48.475\nalert diagram,\nevent performance state, and\n\n742\n00:35:48.475 --> 00:35:51.375\nin this case, network vicinity for\nthe dashboards.\n\n743\n00:35:51.375 --> 00:35:52.955\nWe can see all those different things.\n\n744\n00:35:52.955 --> 00:35:54.285\nWe have our health explorer.\n\n745\n00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:56.445\nWe have our ability in this\ncase to put the machine or\n\n746\n00:35:56.445 --> 00:35:57.555\nthe server in a maintenance mode.\n\n747\n00:35:57.555 --> 00:36:00.225\nThat's one of our primary actions or\ntasks.\n\n748\n00:36:00.225 --> 00:36:03.065\nIf we have tasks that are running,\nwe can check the status of them,\n\n749\n00:36:03.065 --> 00:36:04.500\nsee what's going on.\n\n750\n00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.040\nUnix Linux computers have their own area,\nand\n\n751\n00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.030\nWindows computers have their own\narea as well for the dashboard.\n\n752\n00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:13.460\nAnd we can see, we've just done\nthe install, we're healthy.\n\n753\n00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.290\nThe management server role is healthy.\n\n754\n00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:18.230\nWe're not currently monitoring the\noperating system cuz we haven't enabled\n\n755\n00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:22.520\nany monitoring yet, but we could tell that\nthe general system itself is healthy.\n\n756\n00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:27.410\nAnd we could see that, and we could also\nsee that we've added some tasks over here\n\n757\n00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:30.880\non the right at the bottom for\nWindows computer specific in this view.\n\n758\n00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.600\nWe could do things like pinging.\n\n759\n00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.730\nWe could do computer management.\n\n760\n00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:35.350\nOpen up the computer Manager.\n\n761\n00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:38.150\nSo we have, depending on\nthe particular item we select,\n\n762\n00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:42.590\ndepending on the particular area we're in,\nwe have contextual opportunities to engage\n\n763\n00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:46.840\nand operate with different pre-made\ntasks or workflows that may exist.\n\n764\n00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.830\nWe can do remote desktop admin.\n\n765\n00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.010\nWe can open up and\nconnect to a machine directly.\n\n766\n00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.620\nAnd then we have all of\nthe various monitoring\n\n767\n00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.790\nelements from the management\npacks that have been imported.\n\n768\n00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:58.710\nAnd we see them here.\n\n769\n00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:03.610\nAnd we have one for system center, for the\nOPS manager itself, for Windows machine,\n\n770\n00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.160\nfor Linux machines.\n\n771\n00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.850\nThese are all out of the box, right?\n\n772\n00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.570\nBy default,\nplus whatever else we would bring in.\n\n773\n00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:13.690\nAnd so, if we take a look for\ninstance here, up under Windows,\n\n774\n00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.270\nMicrosoft Windows server,\nwe see a variety of elements that help\n\n775\n00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:21.380\nus to understand how to manage\na traditional Microsoft Windows server.\n\n776\n00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:24.130\nWe would see any active\nalerts that may occur.\n\n777\n00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.280\nWe'd see the operating\nsystem performance monitor.\n\n778\n00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.010\nSo we would be able to pre-configure\nthis or set this up as necessary.\n\n779\n00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:33.060\nWe can actually go in and modify it here.\n\n780\n00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.970\nWe would have any tasks\nthat may be running.\n\n781\n00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:37.190\nWe'd have the state of the server.\n\n782\n00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:41.055\nWe would be able to see health,\nIP address information, etc.\n\n783\n00:37:41.055 --> 00:37:45.560\nWe'd be able to go in, look at detailed\nhealth monitoring with various dashboards,\n\n784\n00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.120\nthings like disc health, right?\n\n785\n00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.940\nWould be displayed here,\nwe'll be able to see what it looks like.\n\n786\n00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.650\nAgain, nothing is monitoring yet\nbecause were just out of the box.\n\n787\n00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.780\nBut you get the idea.\n\n788\n00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.755\nPerformance would be look at here as well.\n\n789\n00:37:55.755 --> 00:38:00.920\nAnd so all of these views and all this\ninformation is coming to us out of\n\n790\n00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.970\nthe management packs that have been\ninstalled with the default configuration.\n\n791\n00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.800\nAnd then we start to delve in, modify, and\n\n792\n00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.200\nmanipulate as necessary to create\nthe environment, install the agents, and\n\n793\n00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.300\nstart to do the in-depth monitoring\nthat SCOM's actually gonna be used for.\n\n794\n00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:20.030\n&gt;&gt; All right, definitely a lot of to take\na look at when it comes to the operations\n\n795\n00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:23.160\nmanager, And\nnow that we know how to install the thing,\n\n796\n00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.860\nwe can actually do that and\nstart playing around in there,\n\n797\n00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:30.110\nstarting getting things connected and\nmonitoring, as well.\n\n798\n00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.290\nAdam, we do thank you for\n\n799\n00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.660\nshowing us how to get this far because\nthis is an important step for us.\n\n800\n00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.182\nSo, being able to install this thing and\nget it running, operational,\n\n801\n00:38:38.182 --> 00:38:39.181\nis very important.\n\n802\n00:38:39.181 --> 00:38:40.846\nAnd now I think that, hopefully,\n\n803\n00:38:40.846 --> 00:38:44.250\nour audience there will have\nthe ability to do that very thing.\n\n804\n00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:45.490\nThat being said, I'm looking at our clock.\n\n805\n00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.150\nOur time is well expired.\n\n806\n00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:50.690\nBut for very good reason, we hung in\nthere for it, for you good people so\n\n807\n00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.720\nthat you have knowledge, which is power.\n\n808\n00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.350\nThat being said,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n809\n00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:57.060\nFor ITProTV, thanks for watching.\n\n810\n00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.200\nI've been your host, Daniel

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.737\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:16.580\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.830\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n9\n00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.510\nwe're back with more of our Datacenter\nMonitoring with Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n10\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.280\nAnd of course,\njoining us back in the studio,\n\n11\n00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.470\nlending his expertise on that topic, that\nwe might be more knowledgeable ourselves,\n\n12\n00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.000\nour good friend, Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.755\nAdam, welcome back, sir,\nso glad to have you again.\n\n14\n00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:36.655\n&gt;&gt; Pleasure as always, pleasure as always.\n\n15\n00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:40.325\nGlad to be here talking with you,\ncontinuing our roll through\n\n16\n00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:44.105\nour implementation/installation\ndemonstrations.\n\n17\n00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:45.755\nThat's a mouthful right there.\n\n18\n00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:49.482\nWe're gonna take up Data Protection\nManager in this particular episode.\n\n19\n00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.907\nWe're gonna show you how to get that up\nand running, build out, or continue to\n\n20\n00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:56.887\nbuild out, all the supporting-cast\ncharacters around System Center.\n\n21\n00:00:56.887 --> 00:01:00.207\nSurrounding SCOM with all the elements\nnecessary to make it successful.\n\n22\n00:01:00.207 --> 00:01:05.197\nData Protection Manager is going\nto be the enterprise backup and\n\n23\n00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:09.490\ndata recovery product that Microsoft has,\nthat's part of the System Center suite.\n\n24\n00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.460\nThink of Backup Exec, think Arcserve,\nthink whatever you may be using in\n\n25\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.790\nthe real world that is your equivalent\nof an enterprise-level backup solution.\n\n26\n00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.210\nThat's what DPM is for us here.\n\n27\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.450\nWe're gonna walk through how\nto do the install for you.\n\n28\n00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.150\nGonna show you a quick little bonus,\n\n29\n00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.340\nextra added special item that we talked\nabout at the very end of our last episode.\n\n30\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.590\nIf you haven't watched that one,\n\n31\n00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.220\non how to stand up SCOM, get it\nconfigured, we did the full install there.\n\n32\n00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.260\nWe did do our reboot on the machine,\n\n33\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260\nalthough I didn't show you that\nat the end of the episode.\n\n34\n00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.850\nJust to make sure, as we've been talking\nabout, we're ready to do our next install.\n\n35\n00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.010\nRemember, if we're gonna be combining\nmultiple roles together on a single\n\n36\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.830\nserver, we're gonna want\nto do reboots in-between,\n\n37\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.940\nto make sure the installs will set up and\nstack properly.\n\n38\n00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.720\nWe've done that, and what I wanted to show\nyou, just before we get started with DPM,\n\n39\n00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.640\nis what happens once we get SCOM up and\nrunning.\n\n40\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.430\nWe walked through the Console with you.\n\n41\n00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.980\nWhat I didn't actually\nshow you in that episode\n\n42\n00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.580\nwas what the PowerShell cmdlets looked\nlike in the Ops Manager PowerShell module.\n\n43\n00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.360\nSo, I thought we'd start with that real\nquick, if you want to take a look.\n\n44\n00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.856\nEven if you don't, just close your\neyes and pretend you're not looking,\n\n45\n00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:13.430\nit doesn't matter.\n\n46\n00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.520\nWe're to get to the DPM installer here and\n\n47\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.470\njust in a minute we just got that\nset up but I brought up the apps\n\n48\n00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.400\nmanager PowerShell console for you see\nthat's running you'll see it's right here\n\n49\n00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.450\nalso this is the apps manager variance for\nPowerShell not the actual PowerShell.\n\n50\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.510\nI did modify, and I do in my\ndemonstrations, modify PowerShell so\n\n51\n00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.660\nthat you can see it better.\n\n52\n00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.720\nSo just to understand,\nwhen you go look it up and\n\n53\n00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.150\nbring it up, it's not gonna start up and\nlook white with a blue back.\n\n54\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.180\nOr rather white background with blue text,\nunless you modify the console permanently.\n\n55\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.400\nBut I do that because it's easier for\nyou guys to see it.\n\n56\n00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.190\nIt will start up and\nlook like the standard PowerShell.\n\n57\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.190\nIt'll be black,\nlook like a DOS shell with the white text.\n\n58\n00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.360\nSo just don't get thrown off by that.\n\n59\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.340\nNow all I did was to see all the command\nat center installed to your in the module\n\n60\n00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.740\nI just issued the get commands command.\n\n61\n00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.900\nYou'll see that right here just highlight\nthat for you and by doing that it just\n\n62\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.480\nechoes back to the shell in\nthe console for resolve a commands but\n\n63\n00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.300\nthere are very large number of them and\nyou may not be able to.\n\n64\n00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.120\nKeep up with all of them and\n\n65\n00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.610\nactually see what all of them are, so\ninstead of just doing them to the shell.\n\n66\n00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.690\nWhat I thought would be good\nis just quickly let you see\n\n67\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.890\nhow we actually are gonna\nbe able to take this, and\n\n68\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.720\nhow we're actually gonna be able to output\nthe content of the get command command.\n\n69\n00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.250\nSo, I issue to get command.\n\n70\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.670\nI output it to a string,\nwherever I want to put it.\n\n71\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.450\nIn this case I just created a directory\nin the root of the C drive called SKOM.\n\n72\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.807\nI'll create a folder called command or\na file rather called commandlets.txt and\n\n73\n00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:47.846\nonce I do this and\nI hit enter I'm then able to,\n\n74\n00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:54.962\nOutput that and\nthen once I've done that if I go and\n\n75\n00:03:54.962 --> 00:04:01.170\ntake a look real quick I'll see that\nIn the C drive, let's go to C drive.\n\n76\n00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.960\nWe have our scam folder.\n\n77\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.170\nWe have our Cmdlets .txtfile.\n\n78\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.930\nNow, it is almost 400 kilobits.\n\n79\n00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.960\nYou didn't wanna open that in Notepad\nyou might wanna take that and\n\n80\n00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.550\ntry to open that in Word or Wordpad.\n\n81\n00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.840\nAnd it's gonna be able to deal with that\nlarger size a little bit more efficiently\n\n82\n00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.150\nbut it will give you a working\nlist of all the Cmdlets and\n\n83\n00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.950\nhelp then to start working through\nthem see what they are and\n\n84\n00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.560\ngives you a nice way to be\nable to parse real quickly and\n\n85\n00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.720\nsearch for one if you're not familiar\nwith it or not sure as to what it may be,\n\n86\n00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.880\nyou can look it up to see\nwhether it's there or not.\n\n87\n00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.280\nYou could do the same\nthing in ICE by the way.\n\n88\n00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.240\nSo, I've talked about ICE before, and\n\n89\n00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.050\nyou certainly could do that\nthere as well if you wanted to.\n\n90\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.510\nRemember ICE may or\nmay not be installed by default.\n\n91\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.440\nYou may have to go in and grab that and\ninteract with that separately.\n\n92\n00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.330\nSo, all we did was just set that up.\n\n93\n00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.670\nNow, I parked that little\nshortcut down here for us.\n\n94\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.890\nOn the task bar.\n\n95\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.920\nAnd in case you're not\nfamiliar with how to do that,\n\n96\n00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.650\nI just went in to the work space,\nthe Start work space.\n\n97\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.690\nI went in and, notice I put them here,\non the Start work space as well,\n\n98\n00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.250\nbecause I've already set them up there.\n\n99\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.690\nBut those tiles are not\ngonna be there by default.\n\n100\n00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.120\nInstead what I did, is I went down\nhere into my app workspace, and\n\n101\n00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.440\nI simply just scrolled\nover found the area for\n\n102\n00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.590\nSystem Center 2012 where the install is,\nOps Console, Ops Manager Shell.\n\n103\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.860\nRight click on each one, one at a time.\n\n104\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.470\nIt'll say pin to start or pin to taskbar.\n\n105\n00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.670\nBecause I've already pinned\nthem there it says unpin.\n\n106\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.840\nAll I did was just do each, one at a time.\n\n107\n00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.560\nGet the shortcut.\n\n108\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.000\nThen I launch it right from there.\n\n109\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.720\nJust so you can set yourself up, you have\nall the items in the place you want them\n\n110\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.740\nto be and it's easy to work with them.\n\n111\n00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.470\nIf you're gonna be looking for ISE,\nand see whether or not it's installed,\n\n112\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.750\nyou could do a quick search for\nISE there, you'll see that we do have\n\n113\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.450\nWindows PowerShell ISE and we can go ahead\nand we can load that up, and we can then,\n\n114\n00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.650\nif you've never seen ISE,\nlet's just bring this in real quick.\n\n115\n00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.590\nRun this administrator one time to\nsee you can quickly get a sense.\n\n116\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.240\nSo, it does start up looking like this and\nin case again you may or\n\n117\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.700\nmay not be familiar with it.\n\n118\n00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.400\nYou can simply pull this\nlittle button right here.\n\n119\n00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.840\nCan we go full screen for a second?\n\n120\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.650\nJust so\nyou could see this a little bit easier.\n\n121\n00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.380\nJust go ahead and click on that and\nit will open up for you.\n\n122\n00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.290\nI love my mouse.\n\n123\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.550\nThat's what I keep saying to myself.\n\n124\n00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.360\nThere we go.\n\n125\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.870\nIt will allow you to see a workspace where\nyou can actually type in the various\n\n126\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.030\nlines of the power shell command list\nof the script you wanna create without\n\n127\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.430\nexecuting them, but working them, editing\nthem, debugging, whatever you need to do.\n\n128\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.400\nYou could then execute them from up here,\nyou'll see the output down here.\n\n129\n00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.750\nSo you can work with different areas, and\nyou can modify this view as needed, but\n\n130\n00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.060\nthe reason I brought this up, and the\nreason this is nice, is that we can go and\n\n131\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.770\nwe can search by module and\nwe can pull down here on the right,\n\n132\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.960\nand we can actually see\nthat we can search.\n\n133\n00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.460\nAnd if we scroll down we could see\na list of all the modules that are here,\n\n134\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.680\nin powershell.\n\n135\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.860\nAnd we can scroll through and search for\n\n136\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.170\ncommandlets that may be available\nby whatever module we have loaded.\n\n137\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.740\nNow remember, this is going to be ice for\nthe normal powershell function.\n\n138\n00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.580\nOf the machine,\nthis is not the operations manager shell.\n\n139\n00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.190\nSo, as a result as we scroll through here,\nright, we go back up.\n\n140\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.890\nWe would have to choose the ops\nmanager module specifically so\n\n141\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.580\nwe can search for those modules, right?\n\n142\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.580\nSo, we could choose that here and then\nwe will see all the module Commandlets,\n\n143\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.380\nall the ones that are loaded\nwith this particular module.\n\n144\n00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.620\nWe'll see them all here, and this is\nessentially what we got in the output of\n\n145\n00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.270\nthat list we just created, right.\n\n146\n00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.100\nAnd we can actually bring all these up.\n\n147\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.060\nNow, the nice thing about this is\nwe can choose any one of these.\n\n148\n00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.150\nLet's just randomly choose one.\n\n149\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.080\nLet's go in and do [INAUDIBLE] run as\nagent account or run as account And\n\n150\n00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.000\nit will tell us a little bit about it.\n\n151\n00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.180\nShows us what it is.\n\n152\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.790\nSays to import the ops manager module.\n\n153\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.910\nAnd it's commandlets including blah,\nblah, blah.\n\n154\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.070\nClick show details.\n\n155\n00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.200\nYou have to bring it in, because remember,\nit's not loaded into powershell normally.\n\n156\n00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.410\nSo we're seeing the module,\nbecause it's on the machine, but\n\n157\n00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.670\nwe're not actually working with it, unless\nwe actually import it and bring it in.\n\n158\n00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.020\nBecause these are two distinctly\ndifferent versions, of powershell.\n\n159\n00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.910\nOne is the normal PowerShell install for\n\n160\n00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.860\nthe machine, the other is\nthe shell-specific ops manager.\n\n161\n00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.190\nAnd so we just wanna make sure\nyou're familiar with that, so\n\n162\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:13.070\nif we click Show Details, it will bring\nit in so we can interact with it.\n\n163\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.710\nAnd then we can see all the parameters\nthat are available to us,\n\n164\n00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.250\nwe can see all the information about it,\nand we can start to interact with it.\n\n165\n00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.620\nSo Ice is a very powerful tool in general.\n\n166\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.520\nFor PowerShell.\n\n167\n00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.010\nBut as an editor especially, it gives\nus additional capabilities here, and\n\n168\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.640\ngives us the ability to\ninteract with search for\n\n169\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.530\ncommandlets, find out how to set them up,\nwhat the parameters are to use with them,\n\n170\n00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.360\nso we don't have to go out and\nlook for all this on the web.\n\n171\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.900\nSo I just wanted you to see that\nas we're getting started here, and\n\n172\n00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.540\ngetting ready to interact with DPM Just\nthought it would be of value to you.\n\n173\n00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.850\nAll right, so\nwe’re going to close this out.\n\n174\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:49.910\nWe’re going to go in.\n\n175\n00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.960\nNow, what I’ve done, is I’ve started the\nDPM, the data protection manager setup.\n\n176\n00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.780\nBecause, we’re gonna get an error.\n\n177\n00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.260\nAnd I want to show you what\nthat error looks like,\n\n178\n00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.520\nand how to deal with it the first\ntime we do the install.\n\n179\n00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.185\nWe're doing an all in one install again,\n\n180\n00:09:02.185 --> 00:09:06.230\nwe;'re using the local SQL\nserver instance on this box.\n\n181\n00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.050\nSQL's installed locally on this machine.\n\n182\n00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.150\nAnd that's what we're using for our demos.\n\n183\n00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.959\nSo, as a result we have a pre req or\nessentially.\n\n184\n00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.300\nDependency, if you will,\nthat has to be there.\n\n185\n00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.660\nAnd that is gonna be the, what is it?\n\n186\n00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.650\nThe SIS,\n\n187\n00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:24.150\nthe SIS filter, that we are gonna have\nto install that's not there by default.\n\n188\n00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.090\nWhen we do an all-in-one install, and\n\n189\n00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.610\nwe use the Standalone SQL server instance\nthat's not clustered on this box.\n\n190\n00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.960\nWe get this issue.\n\n191\n00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.450\nAnd so, this is expected.\n\n192\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.420\nJust wanted you to see this.\n\n193\n00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.570\nYou run the install, we get this,\nthe pre-req actually does get installed.\n\n194\n00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.090\nBut it errors out now and\nsays hey, okay, I did that.\n\n195\n00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.080\nBut since I did that, you got to\nessentially come back and try again.\n\n196\n00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.810\nSo no big deal.\n\n197\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.390\nWe're going to go ahead, we're going\nto cancel out of this at the bottom.\n\n198\n00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.380\nLet me just drag this back up.\n\n199\n00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.410\nSo, you can see the cancel\nbutton down there.\n\n200\n00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.070\nWe're gonna cancel out of this install.\n\n201\n00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:01.140\nAnd once we've cancelled, we're then gonna\ngo ahead, we're gonna restart the box and\n\n202\n00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.520\nwe're then gonna clear that error so\nwhen we run this set up,\n\n203\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.740\nwe're actually gonna then be able to go\nthrough and complete it without a concern.\n\n204\n00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.400\nSo I'm gonna do that as soon as\nwe come back cuz you're gonna\n\n205\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.750\nnot watch me do that, but\nassume it's gonna get done.\n\n206\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.810\nAs soon as we come back,\nwe're gonna be up and ready to go,\n\n207\n00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.140\nand we're actually gonna have the install\nsetup again, the wizard running.\n\n208\n00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.200\nWe're gonna run through this time.\n\n209\n00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.990\nThis time it'll actually be successful.\n\n210\n00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.360\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n211\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.429\nCome back in just one second.\n\n212\n00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.951\nAll right, so\nwe're back from our restart and\n\n213\n00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:30.355\nyou could see what I did is I\njust brought back up the media.\n\n214\n00:10:30.355 --> 00:10:32.987\nAnd I wanted to show you this one in\nparticular cuz DPM is a little bit\n\n215\n00:10:32.987 --> 00:10:34.480\ndifferent than all the others.\n\n216\n00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.390\nAll the other media we've looked at,\nthe VMM, the App Controller, Apps Manager,\n\n217\n00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.570\nyou go right in and there's a setup\ndomicile or EXC sitting right on the root.\n\n218\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.350\nDPM is a little bit of a different\nstructure for consuming for\n\n219\n00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.810\njust a second there for\nscreen to see we've two folders there and\n\n220\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.860\nwe're gonna go into SCDPM,\nour data protection manager.\n\n221\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.410\nWe'll then scroll down and\nunderneath there, at the bottom,\n\n222\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.340\nwe'll see our setup application.\n\n223\n00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.571\nRight click, run that as admin.\n\n224\n00:10:58.571 --> 00:11:04.339\nWe're gonna get our little start up\nlaunch page or splash screen 12 R2.\n\n225\n00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:07.130\nWe're gonna then do our\ndata protection install.\n\n226\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.750\nWe'll accept our EULA.\n\n227\n00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.970\nThis is gonna be fairly straightforward.\n\n228\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.740\nIt runs a quick little setup check for us.\n\n229\n00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.410\nAnd then as soon as that's done,\nwe're gonna get back to our pre-req check.\n\n230\n00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.520\nSo we'll see this in just moment.\n\n231\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.920\nThis is where we had advanced\nthrough in the first go-around,\n\n232\n00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.330\njust to show you the error.\n\n233\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.800\nSo I had pre-loaded all this, you didn't\nhave to worry about seeing it all happen.\n\n234\n00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.670\nBecause we're gonna show\nit to you this time.\n\n235\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.700\nAnd so\nnow once we've dealt with that error and\n\n236\n00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.090\nwe're starting we're gonna start with our\nwelcome screen, and we'll click next.\n\n237\n00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.760\nWe're then doing our prereq check.\n\n238\n00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.470\nWe're gonna use our\nstand alone SQL Server.\n\n239\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.482\nThis is where we were last\ntime if you remember.\n\n240\n00:11:41.482 --> 00:11:46.515\nWe had Loaded in our credential, run the\npre-req check, found the SIS filter error.\n\n241\n00:11:46.515 --> 00:11:49.085\nDealt with that through the restart,\nwe're now good to go.\n\n242\n00:11:49.085 --> 00:11:50.985\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nput this back in.\n\n243\n00:11:50.985 --> 00:11:55.137\nI'm gonna go ahead and specify here,\nyou stand alone SQL SQL server.\n\n244\n00:11:55.137 --> 00:11:59.177\nI'm gonna do ahead and I'm gonna put\nin the instance name that we're using.\n\n245\n00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:05.606\nSo I'm just gonna type that in,\nthe MS SQL server.\n\n246\n00:12:05.606 --> 00:12:07.047\nSo we've got all that.\n\n247\n00:12:07.047 --> 00:12:09.957\nWell then I'm gonna go ahead,\nwe're just gonna tap through there.\n\n248\n00:12:09.957 --> 00:12:11.857\nWe'll get our little hair,\nare you ready to check and\n\n249\n00:12:11.857 --> 00:12:14.047\nmake sure you're good to do your install.\n\n250\n00:12:14.047 --> 00:12:15.747\nWe're gonna go ahead checking an install.\n\n251\n00:12:15.747 --> 00:12:20.040\nNow it says, setup will use current users\ncredentials for the SQL instance so\n\n252\n00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.410\nthat's what we're doing that's why\nwe're not providing a credential here.\n\n253\n00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.290\nGonna click check and\ninstall give that a second.\n\n254\n00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.650\nThis is what we ran prior to\nthe last time we did this to C\n\n255\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:36.320\nthat we would have that capability or\nthat error have may or may not come up.\n\n256\n00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.390\nLooks like we're good we're gonna go\nahead and it says and if you zoom you can\n\n257\n00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.240\nprobably see it here real quick we\njust go full screen for a second.\n\n258\n00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.040\nThis time instead of\nthe error what do we get?\n\n259\n00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.840\nThis computer meets the software and\nhardware requirements for the DPM.\n\n260\n00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.715\nSo this time we've dealt with that,\n\n261\n00:12:51.715 --> 00:12:54.803\nwe no longer have that issue\nwith the SIS filter dependency.\n\n262\n00:12:54.803 --> 00:12:58.670\nSo we're gonna be able to move past that,\nget into product registration.\n\n263\n00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.780\nWe're gonna click next here.\n\n264\n00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.560\nWe're gonna be asked for\nour username, we'll put that in.\n\n265\n00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:09.910\nDo administrator here, we're going to go\nahead, assuming that's spelled correctly.\n\n266\n00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:14.620\nAnd we'll do practice labs for this.\n\n267\n00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.300\nAnd then we have our product key here,\ngonna go ahead,\n\n268\n00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.610\nwe actually have our product key for\nthis particular install.\n\n269\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.330\nI have it here.\n\n270\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.700\nSo we're just gonna use a product key for\n\n271\n00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.450\nthis one unlike some the prior ones we've\ndone where we just done this in eval mode.\n\n272\n00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.870\nThought we've throned\na little curve ball in there.\n\n273\n00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.300\nPut our product key in.\n\n274\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.380\nDon't try to use that product key in\nhumble is a girls that is just for\n\n275\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.920\ndemonstration purposes all right.\n\n276\n00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.090\nSo I'm going to click next there give that\njust a second we're then going to go ahead\n\n277\n00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:45.310\nmove pass that we'll see that we then have\nour install setting screen pretty straight\n\n278\n00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:49.340\nforward just our standard defaults what's\nour program, installed directory going to\n\n279\n00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.390\nbe, what's our drive space look like,\nwhat's required, things like that.\n\n280\n00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:57.490\nWe're gonna click Next, or\nwe're gonna use Microsoft Update.\n\n281\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.770\nWe've talked about this in the real world,\nright?\n\n282\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.140\nAre we gonna need to do the updates?\n\n283\n00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.490\nYes, absolutely.\n\n284\n00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.030\nBut for\npurposes of our demonstration here,\n\n285\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.970\nwe're not gonna bother with the updates.\n\n286\n00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.970\nBut you know in the real world,\nwe definitely wanna be doing that.\n\n287\n00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.110\nWe'll click Next.\n\n288\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.960\nAre we gonna do the customer feedback?\n\n289\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.660\nAgain in the real world,\nimportant for you to do that here,\n\n290\n00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.740\nwe'll deal with that later then we\nget our summary, pretty simple.\n\n291\n00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.330\nJust go ahead and click Install.\n\n292\n00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.153\nWe're gonna let that do it's thing.\n\n293\n00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:24.170\nIt's gonna cook for a couple minutes.\n\n294\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.640\nWhen we come back, we'll actually\ntake a look at it being done.\n\n295\n00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.460\nWe'll open up the console,\nmake sure everything is working for you.\n\n296\n00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.390\nSo please come on back and\n\n297\n00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.869\nsee us in just a couple of minutes,\nwe'll have that all set up for you.\n\n298\n00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.940\nAll right, so you can see we finished\nup our Data Protection Manager install,\n\n299\n00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.640\njust bring this down just a smidge so\nyou can see that.\n\n300\n00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.330\nYou'll see that we are successful,\ngot a little green check.\n\n301\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.815\nUnlike the others, no green circle, white\ncheck, they switched it up on this one.\n\n302\n00:14:46.815 --> 00:14:47.915\nNo circle green check.\n\n303\n00:14:47.915 --> 00:14:48.795\n&gt;&gt; Who needs consistency.\n\n304\n00:14:48.795 --> 00:14:50.395\n&gt;&gt; Gotta love those guys at Microsoft.\n\n305\n00:14:50.395 --> 00:14:51.915\nBoy they're always thinking\nabout ways to totally.\n\n306\n00:14:51.915 --> 00:14:54.144\n&gt;&gt; What it is, is one team built this and\nanother team built the other thing.\n\n307\n00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:55.456\n&gt;&gt; Confound and confuse.\n\n308\n00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:57.116\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Like the other.\n\n309\n00:14:57.116 --> 00:14:58.255\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n310\n00:14:58.255 --> 00:15:01.433\nNow I just wanna show you, let's go full\nscreen for me for just one second so\n\n311\n00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:03.290\nyou can see this link right down here.\n\n312\n00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.410\nSo it does say hey, by the way, if you\nwanna click on this link to see the latest\n\n313\n00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.010\nEMP updates, click there to be\nable to go out and take a look.\n\n314\n00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.590\nSo, if there is information,\nyou could go out to the web,\n\n315\n00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.090\nassuming you're connected, of course.\n\n316\n00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.620\nYou'll be able to find that.\n\n317\n00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.840\nWe're gonna go ahead and click Close,\nand we'll let that finish up.\n\n318\n00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.090\nNow, we do get the little check for\n\n319\n00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.260\nupdate thing, it's running in the\nbackground automatically for Microsoft.\n\n320\n00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.820\nNo big deal,\nwe're not gonna bother with that.\n\n321\n00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.580\nWe're just gonna close out of that,\ncuz we know.\n\n322\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.020\nIn the real world that would be important.\n\n323\n00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.080\nHere, we're not gonna bother with that,\nwe're good.\n\n324\n00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.550\nSo now, that we've got that done,\nwe'll just come over here and\n\n325\n00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.130\nwe'll see then we have\ntwo console shortcuts.\n\n326\n00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.740\nLet me just move this down so\nyou can see this.\n\n327\n00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.596\nBecause that one's kinda long.\n\n328\n00:15:39.596 --> 00:15:41.637\nAnd actually,\nI'll pull it over to the side here so\n\n329\n00:15:41.637 --> 00:15:43.810\nyou can see it right in\nthe middle of the screen.\n\n330\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.180\nNot that it helps much, it's so dark.\n\n331\n00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.200\nIt's kinda hard to see.\n\n332\n00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.250\nBut you can see it is\nthe DPM Console shortcut.\n\n333\n00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.390\nAnd then we have our\nDPM Management Shell as well.\n\n334\n00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.890\nSo, we do have a PowerShell\nshell specific to DPM.\n\n335\n00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.920\nJust like we do with the ops manager.\n\n336\n00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.380\nAnd we have the console for DPM,\nlet's go ahead and open up the console for\n\n337\n00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.240\nDPM real quick,\nmake sure that's gonna load for us.\n\n338\n00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.400\nWe could see that it does, and\nyou could see that we now have\n\n339\n00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.070\nan interface we can work with,\nagain this is an enterprise level back up.\n\n340\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.620\nAnd data management product.\n\n341\n00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.850\nSo, this is gonna be where\nwe set up our backups.\n\n342\n00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.790\nWe'll be able to interact with and link\nthis to our private or public clouds and\n\n343\n00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.160\nbe able to do our backups and\nmanage them from here.\n\n344\n00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.166\nSo, this is an interesting product.\n\n345\n00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:24.460\nWe could do our monitoring,\nour protection, our recovery.\n\n346\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.560\nOur reporting and our management\nthrough the various work spaces.\n\n347\n00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.230\nAnd we can go in and make sure that\nwe’ve got all the things necessary for\n\n348\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.530\nus to be able to ensure the BCDR,\n\n349\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.540\nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery\ncapabilities, are fully integrated\n\n350\n00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.700\nIt into our cloud infrastructure using\nthe system center suite of products.\n\n351\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.670\nAnd we're building out, and continuing to\nbuild out that entire ring of products,\n\n352\n00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.540\nand the protection that\nthey all afford each other,\n\n353\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.160\nand the interaction among them,\nas we continue to do our installs.\n\n354\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.820\nWe're gonna be coming back\nwith another episode.\n\n355\n00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.600\nI wanna invite you to take a look at that.\n\n356\n00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.620\nWe've actually got two more left to\nbe able to do the full install of all\n\n357\n00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.000\nthe product suite.\n\n358\n00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.790\nMembers that we need.\n\n359\n00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:03.020\nGonna be doing Orchestrator,\nand also Service Level Manager.\n\n360\n00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.130\nSo, I want to invite you to come back and\ntake a look at those and\n\n361\n00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.930\nhopefully you'll do so very very quickly.\n\n362\n00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.660\n&gt;&gt; Alright well Adam,\nthanks for joining us today.\n\n363\n00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.560\nThanks for showing us how to install\nthe Data Protection Manager.\n\n364\n00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.450\nIt seems to a very interesting product.\n\n365\n00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.000\nSomething we may need in the future.\n\n366\n00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.860\nThat being said we do thank you guys for\nwatching as well, the viewer.\n\n367\n00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:23.170\nBut it is time for us to sign off,\nfor ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n368\n00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:23.835\nI'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n369\n00:17:23.835 -->

00:00:19.740\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we're back with more\n\n6\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.470\non our series about data center\nmonitoring with Microsoft SCOM.\n\n7\n00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.440\nJoining us in the studio, you saw him\nfriendly waving at you, so nice of him.\n\n8\n00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.100\nMr Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.840\nAdam, welcome back Sir!\n\n10\n00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.950\nHow is it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.590\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, good, how is it going?\n\n12\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.560\nHello.\n&gt;&gt; There he is.\n\n13\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.220\n&gt;&gt; All right!\nSo we're gonna take up and\n\n14\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.880\ncontinue our demonstration slash.\n\n15\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.870\nExplanation of the components in all\nthe surrounding environments surround SCOM\n\n16\n00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.260\nin systems center.\n\n17\n00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.920\nJust to remind you if you haven't\nseen the episodes up until now.\n\n18\n00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.330\nYou may wanna go back just review them,\nwe did the VMM,\n\n19\n00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.480\nthe virtual machine manager project.\n\n20\n00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.940\nWe did.\n\n21\n00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.300\nThe app controller.\n\n22\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.580\nWe did SCOM.\n\n23\n00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.270\nWe're about to do the,\nwhat are we doing now?\n\n24\n00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.510\nThe orchestrator, right?\n\n25\n00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.600\nThat's what we're doing now, right?\n\n26\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.000\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nyou got your baton, right?\n\n27\n00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna do the orchestrator.\n\n28\n00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.600\nSo we're gonna have Daniel orchestrate for\nus.\n\n29\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.160\nThe orchestrator product is\nthe automation workflow product.\n\n30\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.750\nThis is like PowerShell, but\n\n31\n00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.880\nwith a graphical interface,\nallowing us to be able to build workflows.\n\n32\n00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.220\nAnd then, deploy them using what\nare called integration connectors.\n\n33\n00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.050\nWe're gonna be able to connect and\nuse integration packages,\n\n34\n00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.140\nto be able to manage workflow and\n\n35\n00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.500\nbuild componentized, compartmentalized\nworkflows for various products.\n\n36\n00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.250\nReally cool little\naspect of System Center.\n\n37\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.650\nNot a lot of people use the product and\nuse it well.\n\n38\n00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.770\nI see this in the field\na lot with customers.\n\n39\n00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.270\nThey hear about it, they want to use it,\nthey're not really sure what to do with it\n\n40\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.400\nand it's a really,\nreally neat little product.\n\n41\n00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.920\nWe're gonna show you how to\nset this up and install this.\n\n42\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.090\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\njump right in, if we can.\n\n43\n00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.970\nWe'll take a look.\n\n44\n00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.980\nSo, we've got our\ninstallation media loaded up,\n\n45\n00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.180\nour System Center orchestrator media.\n\n46\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.279\nWe're gonna right-click on\nSetup Orchestrator down here.\n\n47\n00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.060\nDo a little run as administrator,\nas we always do.\n\n48\n00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.720\nLet's just get that out of the way,\nbring this up and\n\n49\n00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.760\nyou'll see here we have our System Center\n12 R2 orchestrator product.\n\n50\n00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.465\nDo our install right here so\nlet's just click on and\n\n51\n00:02:09.465 --> 00:02:13.395\nthat will give that just a second to\nspin up we get our standard product\n\n52\n00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:17.235\nregistration screen most of these\nproducts will look more less the same\n\n53\n00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:21.555\nthe naming of the product now outstanding\nso we gonna go ahead as we've been doing\n\n54\n00:02:21.555 --> 00:02:26.645\nset this up we'll call this\nadministrator we'll put this in as\n\n55\n00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:31.980\npractice labs we gonna bypass our\nkey on this one set up is an E verb.\n\n56\n00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.430\nSo go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n57\n00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.470\nWe're gonna accept our ULA and\n\n58\n00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.400\nyes I did read it ahead of time\nin case you were wondering.\n\n59\n00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.120\nAnd if we could just zoom in for a minute,\nso full screen just to see this here.\n\n60\n00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.140\nWe do have management\nserver selected by default.\n\n61\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.740\nBut notice the options,\nwe are gonna leave all the defaults.\n\n62\n00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.500\nBut we have the run book server,\nwe have the orchestrator console and\n\n63\n00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.310\nweb service and run book designer.\n\n64\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.246\nThe designer's where we're gonna\nactually build out work flow.\n\n65\n00:02:56.246 --> 00:02:59.950\nThis is gonna be our drag and drop grid\nlike environment and we're gonna be\n\n66\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.880\nable to go in and use that to be able to\nbuild out our workflows and deploy them.\n\n67\n00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.730\nWe'll take a look at that.\n\n68\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.240\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\ndo this install we'll kick this off,\n\n69\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.210\nlet's click next.\n\n70\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.590\nWe're gonna check for\nrequired hardware and software.\n\n71\n00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.830\nYou'll see that we have\nthat piece well in hand.\n\n72\n00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.520\nWe have to configure our service accounts.\n\n73\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.160\nWe're gonna go in,\nset up the information we need here.\n\n74\n00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.110\nWe'll install with our\npractice Labs accounts.\n\n75\n00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.370\nLet me just spell that correctly here.\n\n76\n00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.040\nPractice labs administrator.\n\n77\n00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.010\nThe one we've been using for\nmost of our installs.\n\n78\n00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.360\nSo we do administrator.\n\n79\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.160\nBut we do our standard password here.\n\n80\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.070\nAnd then, what we're gonna do it to see\nwe have our domain down at the bottom.\n\n81\n00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.320\nWe are gonna run a test to make sure\nwe put the credential in correctly.\n\n82\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.690\nDidn't fat finger anything,\nor screw something up.\n\n83\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.380\nCuz you never know, you may have made\na mistake, you wanna catch it now.\n\n84\n00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.580\nSo we'll check it quickly.\n\n85\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.260\nYou could see Credential Accepted,\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n86\n00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.300\nThen we're gonna click Next here.\n\n87\n00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.090\nWe're gonna then have to go in and\nconfigure the database server.\n\n88\n00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.330\nSo we're gonna specify what\nwe're gonna do here for\n\n89\n00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.470\nus database instance\nremember we're doing in all\n\n90\n00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.700\none installer we have our database running\non the machine we've been using that for\n\n91\n00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.770\nvarious demonstrations in the different\nepisodes we've been doing.\n\n92\n00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.020\nSo we have an instance\nto SQL running locally.\n\n93\n00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.720\nAs a result we're gonna\nuse that local instance.\n\n94\n00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.910\nIn the real world, as you're doing\nyour install, in the organization,\n\n95\n00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.760\nout the enterprise.\n\n96\n00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.490\nWhenever you're doing this,\nyou may path this differently.\n\n97\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.350\nSo just understand what I'm about to type\nin in other words is the local install and\n\n98\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.150\nthe instance for the local install.\n\n99\n00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.070\nYou may choose to do this differently.\n\n100\n00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.160\nSo I'm to put in practice labs, so let's\njust put that in almost practice labs,\n\n101\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.490\nthink about the credential here,\ngetting ahead of myself.\n\n102\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.076\nI'm gonna put in the name of the machine,\napp lab, for\n\n103\n00:04:41.076 --> 00:04:45.664\npractice labs, this is Asus,\nright, Asus machine,\n\n104\n00:04:45.664 --> 00:04:50.283\nit's Asus build 01 and\nthen our database instance.\n\n105\n00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:54.340\nMSSQL Server.\n\n106\n00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.720\nSo we're gonna use that.\n\n107\n00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.850\nWe have our default port there of 1433.\n\n108\n00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.233\nWe're gonna go ahead and specify our\nwindows authentication credential will be\n\n109\n00:05:03.233 --> 00:05:07.551\nused, so we're not gonna put in a specific\ncredential for SQL, but rather just\n\n110\n00:05:07.551 --> 00:05:12.030\nuse our built in Windows credential\nthat we're already supplying and using.\n\n111\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.080\nWe can test our database connection.\n\n112\n00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.000\nAlways good to do that.\n\n113\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.440\nCheck that out, make sure we haven't\ntyped in that name incorrectly,\n\n114\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.740\nhave a problem with the credential.\n\n115\n00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.490\nAgain, wanna check these things out.\n\n116\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.610\nIt's a good way for us to catch errors\nupfront and not start the install and\n\n117\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.120\nfind out things are not gonna go well,\nand have to backtrack.\n\n118\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.350\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n119\n00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.950\nDoesn't take very long,\ntypically about 30 seconds or so.\n\n120\n00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.110\nYou could see that here,\nwe do have a success, so that is good.\n\n121\n00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.471\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n122\n00:05:36.471 --> 00:05:39.290\nWe're then gonna be asked about\nconfiguring the database.\n\n123\n00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.900\nAre we doing a new install\nwith a new database?\n\n124\n00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.790\nWe are gonna do that.\n\n125\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.660\nYou'll see the default database\nname there is Orchestrator.\n\n126\n00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.360\nSo, we're gonna accept that.\n\n127\n00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.990\nBut we could specify an existing\ndatabase if we chose to.\n\n128\n00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.730\nIt'd be up to us to decide.\n\n129\n00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.660\nRemember, in the real world if you're\nsetting up multiple instances you may\n\n130\n00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.010\nalready have a database.\n\n131\n00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.500\nAnd as a result you may have a named\ninstance you want to connect to.\n\n132\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.110\nSo, we're gonna do new database,\nwe'll leave that alone.\n\n133\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.450\nWe're then gonna set up\nthe orchestrated users group,\n\n134\n00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.430\nin other words what group\nare we going to specify.\n\n135\n00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.130\nThat is going to allow us to have\naccess to the Runbook Designer and\n\n136\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.680\nthe Deployment Manager portions\nof the Orchestrator install.\n\n137\n00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.040\nOrchestrator's a compartmentalized\nprogram.\n\n138\n00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.820\nWe have the Runbook Designer,\nwhich is used to actually create, design,\n\n139\n00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.700\nthe runbooks.\n\n140\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.300\nRunbooks are what we call\nthe workflows that we wanna create.\n\n141\n00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.580\nThat's just the name we give them.\n\n142\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.700\nCall them runbooks.\n\n143\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.710\nWe save them and then we deploy them.\n\n144\n00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.800\nThe deployment manager is where we\nactually bring in the integration packs.\n\n145\n00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.490\nWe are gonna import integration packs and\nthen use those which are gonna give us,\n\n146\n00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.150\nthink of this almost like Vizio,\nwhere you're importing the shapes for\n\n147\n00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.660\nvarious solutions you wanna\nbe able to work with.\n\n148\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.270\nThe integration pack imports all\nthe modular components and the work flow\n\n149\n00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.160\nelements for various products, so\nit's almost like a management pack.\n\n150\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.840\nFor Scom, but it's the integration pack is\nthe equivalent of the management pack but\n\n151\n00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.170\nin the orchstrator product.\n\n152\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.730\nSo, the deployment manager is\nthe piece that's used to import\n\n153\n00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.140\nthose integration packs, make them\navailable for the orchestrator server\n\n154\n00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.750\nwhere they're hosted and give us access\nto them in the runbook designer.\n\n155\n00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.700\nSo, it can use them to actually build\nthose runbooks, so it's a multi level\n\n156\n00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.750\nsolution, right and so the user groups or\nthe users group Is gonna be the group that\n\n157\n00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.610\nwe have to be a member of to be able to\nget access to these functional elements.\n\n158\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.740\nThink of it like being a member\nof domain admin group in Windows,\n\n159\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.110\ngives you access to everything.\n\n160\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.990\nIt's that equivalent.\n\n161\n00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.950\nSo, we have on that's built in by default.\n\n162\n00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.610\nIt's called the Orchestrator users group.\n\n163\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.830\nWe're gonna accept that and\nleave that there.\n\n164\n00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.390\nWe are gonna grant remote\naccess to the Runbook Designer.\n\n165\n00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.640\nCan we go full screen for\njust a second to show you this?\n\n166\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.290\nThis is a check box down at the bottom.\n\n167\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.769\nIf we wanna be able to give this group\nformation to be able to access the Run Box\n\n168\n00:07:45.769 --> 00:07:50.367\ndesigner, from a different machine other\nthan the management server itself,\n\n169\n00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:53.478\nwe have to make sure that we\nare giving remote access.\n\n170\n00:07:53.478 --> 00:07:57.674\nThat is the default here because very\nlikely we're gonna wanna administer this\n\n171\n00:07:57.674 --> 00:08:00.867\nand work with this but\nnot just on the management server We may\n\n172\n00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:03.389\nactually decide to use\nthis product remotely.\n\n173\n00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:06.564\nWe often have an admin station,\nsomething like that, we use and so\n\n174\n00:08:06.564 --> 00:08:08.060\nwe wanna be aware of that.\n\n175\n00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.940\nSo you don't wanna uncheck that box if you\nwanna be able to give access to a system\n\n176\n00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.800\nother than the management server itself.\n\n177\n00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.750\nSo just keep that in mind,\nthat's why we have that set up there.\n\n178\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.290\nSo gonna leave that there,\nwe're gonna go ahead and click next.\n\n179\n00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.940\nWe then have to specify the ports for\nthe web service.\n\n180\n00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.080\nWe're gonna leave the defaults in place.\n\n181\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.120\nYou'll see port 81 for\n\n182\n00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.970\nthe web service, port 82 for\nthe orchestration console port.\n\n183\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.260\nThose are the defaults.\n\n184\n00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.500\nAgain, we can modify those,\n\n185\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.610\nbut probably better if we're\ngonna leave those in place.\n\n186\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.448\nWe're then gonna go ahead accepting those\ndefaults, select the install location,\n\n187\n00:08:40.448 --> 00:08:43.809\nhave our standard default\ninstall program files, X86,\n\n188\n00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:47.049\nMicrosoft System Center 2012 R2,\nOrchestrator.\n\n189\n00:08:47.049 --> 00:08:48.870\nYou decide whether you want\nto leave it there or not.\n\n190\n00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.940\nNotice this bar has like, budged at all.\n\n191\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.682\nWe've been through five screens and\nit's not moving.\n\n192\n00:08:52.682 --> 00:08:53.305\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n193\n00:08:53.305 --> 00:08:54.266\nIt's not doing nothing.\n\n194\n00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:56.630\n&gt;&gt; We've got an install that takes\n1000 years with this product.\n\n195\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.410\nIt's crazy.\n\n196\n00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.130\nBut it actually will get\ngoing here in just a minute.\n\n197\n00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.100\nWe're almost there.\n\n198\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.780\nWe've got our system center orchestrator\nto help us to improve it product.\n\n199\n00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.290\nLittle screen, we always know about this.\n\n200\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.400\nWe talked about this.\n\n201\n00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.650\nIn the real world, we would opt in.\n\n202\n00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.590\nHopefully, you would choose to opt in and\nspecify that you wanna give Microsoft some\n\n203\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.390\nfeedback through the customer\nexperience improvement program.\n\n204\n00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.590\nWe're gonna say no here.\n\n205\n00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.180\nNo to error reporting as well.\n\n206\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.330\nBut we would in the real\nworld hopefully opt in.\n\n207\n00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.100\nOpt in.\n\n208\n00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.450\nWe do have our install summary.\n\n209\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.440\nAgain, I'll just remind you as I\noften have, we have the demos.\n\n210\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.240\nGood opportunity for you to stop,\ntake a screen capture here,\n\n211\n00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.220\nthink about your documentation,\nget that information captured properly.\n\n212\n00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.750\nNice thing about this, and\n\n213\n00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.010\nit's a little unusual than some of\nthe other screens In the other products.\n\n214\n00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.500\nThey give us the ability to click here and\n\n215\n00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.410\njust change that particular item,\nwhich is nice.\n\n216\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.870\nWe could opt in right here on this screen\nwithout having to go Previous, Previous,\n\n217\n00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.220\nPrevious, Back, Back, Back.\n\n218\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.080\nWe could jump right in and\nchange it right from here.\n\n219\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.840\nSo, it's kind of just a odd little\nitem in this particular wizard.\n\n220\n00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.790\nIt doesn't show up in every one.\n\n221\n00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.253\nBut it's nice that they thought\nabout us and allowed us to do this.\n\n222\n00:09:55.253 --> 00:09:58.649\nThis was User friendly product team\nat Microsoft that designed this\n\n223\n00:09:58.649 --> 00:09:59.810\nparticular one.\n\n224\n00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:00.780\nSo we like that.\n\n225\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.060\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click Install.\n\n226\n00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.170\nWe're gonna let that cook.\n\n227\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.000\nIt's gonna take a few minutes, so\nwe're gonna wait for that to finish up.\n\n228\n00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.320\nWe'll come on back and\nshow you what the results are and\n\n229\n00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.780\ntake a look at the moving\nparts as soon as we finish up.\n\n230\n00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.860\nAll right, so you can see that the\nOrchestrator's setup finally completed.\n\n231\n00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.510\nWe've got our green circles,\nwhite checks all the way down.\n\n232\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.510\nWe do have, just at the bottom\nhere we can scroll down and see,\n\n233\n00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.060\nthe Launch Windows Update, we're gonna\nuncheck that in the demo environment.\n\n234\n00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.990\nIn the real world,\nclearly wanna keep that selected.\n\n235\n00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.900\nWe do have view system\ncenter Orchestrator online.\n\n236\n00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.930\nWe're gonna uncheck that but\n\n237\n00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.890\nyou can take a look at that in\nthe real world if you would like.\n\n238\n00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.920\nI did click to uncheck that,\nI put the check back in.\n\n239\n00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.069\nIt's one of those Funky little.\n\n240\n00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now it's\n\n241\n00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.640\na check back in check box days.\n\n242\n00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.160\nBut, the bottom item, go ahead and\nlaunch the runbook designer,\n\n243\n00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.470\nwe're gonna leave that at checked off,\nwe wanna see the runbook designer.\n\n244\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.330\nMention what it is.\n\n245\n00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.410\nWe're gonna have it launch that for us.\n\n246\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.120\nWe're gonna click close.\n\n247\n00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.020\nGoing to open up the runbook designer,\ngive this just a second.\n\n248\n00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.440\nLet's explode that out,\nmake that full size so you can see that.\n\n249\n00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.800\nIf we could, just take a look\nfull screen here for a minute, so\n\n250\n00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.410\nwe can see the bottom part of the screen\nthat you're missing right now.\n\n251\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.970\nRemember, the runbook designer\nis where we go in and\n\n252\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.190\nactually create the runbooks using\nthe integration pack components.\n\n253\n00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.470\nYou'll see the activities on the\nright-hand side under activities here, by\n\n254\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.660\nwork area, systems scheduling, monitoring\nyou know, whatever the case may be.\n\n255\n00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.740\nAnd as we add integration packs, we get\nmore work areas here, more activities.\n\n256\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.580\nSo we'll have them specifically for\nSCOM, we'll have them for exchange, for\n\n257\n00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.620\nShare Point, whatever the case may be we\ndownload this integration packs via mam.\n\n258\n00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.440\nSo, if we do that and we bring those\nin we'll then be able to start adding\n\n259\n00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.200\nspecific activities associated with\nthe particular workflow in question,\n\n260\n00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.290\ndragging them out on the screen and\ncreating we would come in here under run\n\n261\n00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.190\nbooks and we could see that right now\nwe don't have any run books set up.\n\n262\n00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:57.260\nBut we could right click new run book if\nwe wanted to create one we just create,\n\n263\n00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.480\none right here if we wanted to and the new\nrun book would be very similar just\n\n264\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:07.202\na named, instance we then go ahead do\nsomething like drag out, get computer.\n\n265\n00:12:07.202 --> 00:12:08.420\nDo we wanna check this out?\n\n266\n00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.460\nWe always check out the run book so\nwe could begin to work with it.\n\n267\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.110\nChange the icons so\nwe could see it's edited right now\n\n268\n00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.910\nwe just drag out a bunch of\nthese shapes onto the screen.\n\n269\n00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.730\nAnd then, once we're done,\nget computer and/or IP status.\n\n270\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.490\nWe may get something\nlike get service status.\n\n271\n00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.570\nJust drag that out, we'll line that up.\n\n272\n00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:31.640\nWe may then to decide do monitor\ndisk space or something like that.\n\n273\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.330\nAnd then,\nwhen we're done e'll go ahead and\n\n274\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.320\nperhaps we'll restart the system\nafter we've done all that.\n\n275\n00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.020\nSo, we'll drag out a restart system icon.\n\n276\n00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.660\nAnd each one of these, as we hover over\nthem, if we go back to full screen for\n\n277\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.000\njust a second so\nyou can see this in a little more detail.\n\n278\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.639\nWhen I hover over the shape, I have\nconnector arrows that indicate flow.\n\n279\n00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.980\nAnd you'll see that I can drag that.\n\n280\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.950\nconnect that over like that and\n\n281\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.970\ncreate a linear flow to\nactually instantiate an anchor.\n\n282\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.210\nThe workflow elements, so I know what\norder I want to execute them in.\n\n283\n00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:08.000\nAnd I can begin to,\nyou know, draw that out.\n\n284\n00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.550\nSo, whoops.\n\n285\n00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.090\nDidn't mean to grab that that way.\n\n286\n00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.600\nGotta be careful you grab the arrow.\n\n287\n00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.350\nYou can see I got a little\ncross hair when I do that.\n\n288\n00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.540\nAnd there we go.\n\n289\n00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.010\nGrab that, bring that over.\n\n290\n00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:18.934\nAll right.\n\n291\n00:13:18.934 --> 00:13:23.191\nAnd you'll see, sometimes, depending\non the kind of relationship I set up,\n\n292\n00:13:23.191 --> 00:13:26.620\nit says here, this activity you\nare trying to link is an event.\n\n293\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.670\nEvent activities cannot\naccept incoming links.\n\n294\n00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.870\nThis particular event right here, can't\nactually accept an inbound work flow.\n\n295\n00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.100\nIt could be monitoring or\ndoing something on its own.\n\n296\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.290\nSo, you have to obviously understand the\nshapes and the activities we're working\n\n297\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.770\nwith, and as you start to spend time using\nthe product, we'll learn more about it.\n\n298\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.460\nSo, let's move that out of the way.\n\n299\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.610\nLet's just go ahead and\nbring this over here.\n\n300\n00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:48.970\nSo, we'll have this running.\n\n301\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.400\nI should move this back out this way\na little bit, have a little more room.\n\n302\n00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.020\nWe then can go ahead, grab that.\n\n303\n00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:02.190\nThere we go right there grab that put\nthat over there set that up so we've got\n\n304\n00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.780\na little work flow there if we decide we\ndon't want the monitor we can go ahead and\n\n305\n00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.910\ndelete that shape just highlight that\nwe can get rid of it and delete it and\n\n306\n00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.830\nright click on at friend stands and\nchoose delete and\n\n307\n00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.130\nsay yeah we're just going to get rid of\nthat and just move it up to the side.\n\n308\n00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.070\nThe other nice thing about\nthe Orchestrator here when we go in and\n\n309\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.540\nstart setting these up and we actually\ncreate the work flow we can right click on\n\n310\n00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.890\neach one we can rename them cuz we\nmay wanna take the generic name and\n\n311\n00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:30.050\nspecify this machine let's put in\nthe machine name that we're gonna monitor.\n\n312\n00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:35.190\nSo let's rename that instead of get\ncomputer UP status we're gonna do you\n\n313\n00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:39.425\nknow get status for ITPROTV\n\n314\n00:14:39.425 --> 00:14:45.320\nserver one or something like that so\nwe could actually\n\n315\n00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.940\nspec out our work flow make it make sense\nlabel it so people know what we're doing.\n\n316\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.730\nIn addition.\n\n317\n00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:56.424\nWe can go in to the properties and\nwe can decide that we\n\n318\n00:14:56.424 --> 00:15:01.337\nwanna specify what computer\nwe're gonna connect to so\n\n319\n00:15:01.337 --> 00:15:05.286\nwe have to have the program\nin the computer,\n\n320\n00:15:05.286 --> 00:15:11.046\nwe wanna be able to hit so\nwe go in here maybe go out on the network,\n\n321\n00:15:11.046 --> 00:15:17.773\nfind the computer that's available,\nlet's just pretend we found one and\n\n322\n00:15:17.773 --> 00:15:25.932\nlet's just call this Plab D-C 01 which is\nunder main controller.practise lab.com.\n\n323\n00:15:25.932 --> 00:15:28.289\nLets assume that what we gonna do and\n\n324\n00:15:28.289 --> 00:15:31.990\nthen run behavior we gonna\ndecide how this is gonna run.\n\n325\n00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.860\nWe gonna report when the report\nrun in when someone sinks in.\n\n326\n00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.300\nOr are we gonna go ahead and\noutput the activity?\n\n327\n00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.660\nOutput it a certain way?\n\n328\n00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.100\nThere's different things we do\njust depending on what it is.\n\n329\n00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.360\nSo, we're gonna program\nin all the properties.\n\n330\n00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.706\nWe do this for all the different\nelements of the run book.\n\n331\n00:15:46.706 --> 00:15:49.786\nAnd then,\nsome of these have a looping entity or\n\n332\n00:15:49.786 --> 00:15:54.723\nelement where we can actually go ahead and\nwe can enable this and say, Okay.\n\n333\n00:15:54.723 --> 00:15:58.810\nIf it doesn't work the first time, kind of\na delay, let's go back and try it after so\n\n334\n00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.094\nmany seconds cuz We may be pinging or\nmay be trying to do a heartbeat or\n\n335\n00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:02.920\nwho knows what.\n\n336\n00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.088\nIt depends, obviously,\n\n337\n00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:07.280\non the particular item in\nthe workflow that we're gonna build.\n\n338\n00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.410\nOrchestration is a fairly\ndetailed process.\n\n339\n00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.590\nAnd when I spend time with\ncustomers doing this and\n\n340\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.240\nbuilding out workflows and\nbuilding out workbooks or\n\n341\n00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.370\nrunbooks for them, this can take\na while to figure out how to get right.\n\n342\n00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.920\nThere's some really good\ne-learning out there\n\n343\n00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.230\nthat you can take a look at from Microsoft\ndirectly, on how to do orchestrators or\n\n344\n00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.160\nhow to do the runbooks rather.\n\n345\n00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.820\nThere's some interesting books out there\nthat people have put out about this.\n\n346\n00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.490\nBut it's kindly in a practice and\nreally spend time doing to get well,\n\n347\n00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.250\nto get well-versed with, cuz you have to\nunderstand all the different activities\n\n348\n00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.300\nbased on the integration packs\nthat you're gonna be working with.\n\n349\n00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.720\nAnd what I do when I load in the\nintegration packer, customer says, hey,\n\n350\n00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.600\nI need you to figure this out or\na student has a question.\n\n351\n00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.690\nI got to load that up.\n\n352\n00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.890\nI'll spend a few hours playing with\nall the different activities or\n\n353\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.170\nunderstanding them so have a better\nunderstanding of how to integrate them.\n\n354\n00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.550\nSo we would set this all up obviously.\n\n355\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.090\nAnd once we're done,\nwe'll get everything organized.\n\n356\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.180\nWe would then wanna go ahead and\n\n357\n00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:06.830\nsave this, you'll notice up here we\nhave a check in feature that we can use.\n\n358\n00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:11.160\nCheck in allows us to\nessentially stop editing and\n\n359\n00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.520\nthen once we've done that we can name or\nrename this.\n\n360\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.660\nWe can right-click upon the tab we could\ncheck out, we could do a test on this,\n\n361\n00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.490\nwe can run it see what would happen.\n\n362\n00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.832\nWe can save it, we can delete it,\nexport it, set up permissions,\n\n363\n00:17:23.832 --> 00:17:26.000\nall the standard stuff\nwe would need to do.\n\n364\n00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.544\nAnd then once we're done, we would then\nbe able to deploy this workbook, or\n\n365\n00:17:30.544 --> 00:17:34.236\nrather this runbook, and\nbe able to use it to then automate and\n\n366\n00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:36.500\ncarry out some sort of activity.\n\n367\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:41.360\nNow the other piece associated with this\nthat we spoke about during the install,\n\n368\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.282\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n369\n00:17:42.282 --> 00:17:44.730\nWe're gonna go over here to\nour desktop for a minute.\n\n370\n00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.030\nWe're to go down here.\n\n371\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:51.470\nI'll do a little quick browse,\nlet me just scroll over here, and\n\n372\n00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.990\nwhat we're gonna look for is our,\nyou'll see here we have a runbook design.\n\n373\n00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:59.886\nAnd we've already seen that, but I mention\nthat we will have a console as well for\n\n374\n00:17:59.886 --> 00:18:03.600\norchestrator, so let me take a look at\nthis, and see what's going on here.\n\n375\n00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.968\nSo let's just right-click on the console,\nand\n\n376\n00:18:05.968 --> 00:18:09.910\nlet's just pin that to the Start menu so\nwe can see that, and we'll open that up.\n\n377\n00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.894\nAnd then there's one other thing\nwe just wanna take a look at here,\n\n378\n00:18:12.894 --> 00:18:14.022\nreally quickly as well.\n\n379\n00:18:14.022 --> 00:18:16.598\nLet me just scroll this way.\n\n380\n00:18:16.598 --> 00:18:18.970\nI should be able to find that.\n\n381\n00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.741\nWhere are we?\n\n382\n00:18:20.741 --> 00:18:25.848\nNo, that's up under SQL and\nwhat am I looking for?\n\n383\n00:18:25.848 --> 00:18:31.844\nI am looking for our, do, do, do.\n\n384\n00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:33.637\n&gt;&gt; There's lots of options.\n\n385\n00:18:33.637 --> 00:18:34.975\n&gt;&gt; I'm just looking for\nthe deployment manager.\n\n386\n00:18:34.975 --> 00:18:36.603\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure I didn't sitting up there.\n\n387\n00:18:36.603 --> 00:18:38.298\nIt's alphabetical by product.\n\n388\n00:18:38.298 --> 00:18:40.260\nI just wasn't looking in the right place.\n\n389\n00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.490\nI missed that D there.\n\n390\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.570\nI didn't realize it was there.\n\n391\n00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.960\nThe deployment manager,\nwhich you remember is where we wanna go.\n\n392\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.410\nTo do our integration imports,\nright, our integration pack imports.\n\n393\n00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:49.600\nSo we're gonna bring that in.\n\n394\n00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.819\nI just wanna show you this as well.\n\n395\n00:18:50.819 --> 00:18:55.160\nSo we'll right-click on this, we'll pin\nthat to the Start menu so we can see that.\n\n396\n00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.720\nLet's just take a look at the console.\n\n397\n00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.220\nThen we'll take a look at how\nwe bring in an integration pack.\n\n398\n00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.307\nWe are gonna run these.\n\n399\n00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:04.290\nSo will go ahead and will just do\nthat real quick, bring this up.\n\n400\n00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.310\nThis is a web based console\nthat we will login to, so\n\n401\n00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.280\nthis allows us to interact\nwith the orchestrated product,\n\n402\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.100\nthis is against the actual orchestrator\nserver that we've installed.\n\n403\n00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.120\nAnd you'll see right there, website cannot\nbe found, now why would that happen?\n\n404\n00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.870\nMaybe we have a service error,\nmaybe there's something going on\n\n405\n00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:26.090\nthat is not gonna allow us to access that,\nit looks like we have website not found.\n\n406\n00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:29.080\nWhen you do the install initially,\nit does take a little bit of time for\n\n407\n00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.510\nthe website to instantiate.\n\n408\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.150\nIt may just be that it's not done\ncooking yet behind the scenes, and\n\n409\n00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.080\nthat could also be the case.\n\n410\n00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.450\nSo we may just have to go in and\ntake a look at that,\n\n411\n00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:40.240\ndo a little troubleshooting if that\nhappens the first time we go to connect.\n\n412\n00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.430\nLet's look at the manager in the meantime.\n\n413\n00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.980\nSpring up the deployment manager.\n\n414\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.600\nWe'll see here the deployment manager.\n\n415\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.480\nJust wanna make this full screen so\nwe can see this.\n\n416\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.580\nWe'll see our integration packs here,\n\n417\n00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.220\nnotice that we don't have any\nintegration packs loaded by default.\n\n418\n00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.890\nBut we could go in, right-click,\nand we could register the IP\n\n419\n00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.556\nwith the orchestrator manager\nserver and/or deploy IP runbooks,\n\n420\n00:20:03.556 --> 00:20:09.840\nDeploy IP2 runbook servers what I was\ntrying to say and actually bring them in.\n\n421\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.160\nIt's a two step process and\n\n422\n00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.410\nwhen we go in and we do this, welcome to\nthe innovation pack registration wizard.\n\n423\n00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.660\nWe actually are then able to go in,\nwalk through the steps,\n\n424\n00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.110\nrequired to go ahead and register\nintegration packs or hot fixes or updates.\n\n425\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.480\nWhatever you may be importing and\nmake them available.\n\n426\n00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.650\nWe're not gonna go out and\nactually download them off the Internet.\n\n427\n00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.730\nBut just to show you\nthe beginning of this process.\n\n428\n00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.810\nWe could click next here,\nwe would then be able to add in,\n\n429\n00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.290\nwe would have to either have\nthem available locally or\n\n430\n00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.080\nwe would have to have downloaded them\nalready and make them available.\n\n431\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.170\nSo we would bring in those integration\npacks once we get them from Microsoft or\n\n432\n00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.370\na third party vendor.\n\n433\n00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.620\nWherever they're gonna be and\n\n434\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.220\nthen once we've got that,\nwe'll be able to load those up.\n\n435\n00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.640\nWe're able to add them in here.\n\n436\n00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.750\nAnd then run through and\nintegrate them or import them.\n\n437\n00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.470\nWhen we then deploy them, we have a second\nwizard that allows us to walk-through\n\n438\n00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.550\nthe steps to deploy the integration packs.\n\n439\n00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.090\nWe'd obviously have to integrate them and\nhave them in first.\n\n440\n00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.030\nWe would see the integration packs\nthat we've loaded up using the prior\n\n441\n00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:05.610\nwizard here.\n\n442\n00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.000\nWe would then highlight them,\nand then deploy them out.\n\n443\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.770\nAnd we would then be able to use them.\n\n444\n00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.090\nOnce that's done, we then would be able\nto go in and use the runbook design, and\n\n445\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.720\nwe would see the additional\nintegration pack activities.\n\n446\n00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.740\nAnd we'd be able to use them here, and\nbe able to create the work flows as needed\n\n447\n00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:24.095\nto be able to drive whatever\nrunbook design we would like to do.\n\n448\n00:21:24.095 --> 00:21:28.130\nSo once we have all that set up,\nwe're then able to interact with,\n\n449\n00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.580\nin this case you can see the runbook\ndesign server right here.\n\n450\n00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.800\nAnd we'll be able to go in and\nbe able to configure and\n\n451\n00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.040\nuse it,\nwe showed you that in the other console.\n\n452\n00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.510\nBut I just wanna show you here,\nwe do have to point at logs, so\n\n453\n00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.355\nwe can see what's going on\nwith the deployments we stage.\n\n454\n00:21:42.355 --> 00:21:44.460\nRight-click on the server and see those.\n\n455\n00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.040\nAnd we have properties here, really\nnothing to speak of that we can set up.\n\n456\n00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.520\nBut you'll see we have\nthe name of the server,\n\n457\n00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.870\nwhat it is and\nwe have the runbook designer.\n\n458\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.410\nWe can see the install version,\nsometimes you have to go in and\n\n459\n00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:55.820\nsee what version you're running.\n\n460\n00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.470\nThis is one of the ways you\ncould tell the version.\n\n461\n00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.328\nSo we're able to see that here, we're also\nable to go and see the runbooks server\n\n462\n00:22:01.328 --> 00:22:04.415\nright from here, and\nreally same kind of thing I wanna install.\n\n463\n00:22:04.415 --> 00:22:08.850\nEither deployment logs, look at properties\nof the server, same thing really just see\n\n464\n00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.430\nthe build number and\nversion on the install date here.\n\n465\n00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.340\nNothing more than that, but it does\nallow us to work with the product and\n\n466\n00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.570\ninteract with it to be able to\nbring the integration packs.\n\n467\n00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.280\nSo just wanna make sure\nyou are able to see that.\n\n468\n00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:25.510\nLet's go in and let's do one other\nthing here really quickly, oops,\n\n469\n00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:30.130\nto see if I can get that to hit the right\narea and get that taskbar back up.\n\n470\n00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:30.920\nThere we go.\n\n471\n00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.320\nSo let's just go in here.\n\n472\n00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.720\nLet's go over to IaaS real quick, see\nwhat's going on with our website so we can\n\n473\n00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.850\nsee whether or not that was actually\nset up the right way and is running.\n\n474\n00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.230\nWe didn't get an error on the install, so\nwe would assume that that should be up and\n\n475\n00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:44.510\nrunning and functional.\n\n476\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.990\nAnd let's just take a look,\nwe'll make this full size here so\n\n477\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.140\nwe can see what's going on.\n\n478\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.872\nLet's just move that over, whoops,\nlet's see if we can catch that,\n\n479\n00:22:51.872 --> 00:22:54.100\njust move that over a little bit.\n\n480\n00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:59.400\nAnd if we move it all the way over, we'll\nsee we do have our default website, we\n\n481\n00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.430\ndo have our system center orchestrator web\nservice, and orchestration console site.\n\n482\n00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.410\nSo the site is there,\ndoes look like it, is fine.\n\n483\n00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.750\nWe could see it here,\nwe can see the settings of it.\n\n484\n00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:09.700\nLet's just go in and\n\n485\n00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.930\nmake sure we don't have anything\nfunky going on with authentication.\n\n486\n00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:18.130\nAnd it looks like we do have\nWindows authentication enabled.\n\n487\n00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.590\nWe should be able to get in there.\n\n488\n00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:23.310\nLet's just go ahead and although we\nwould never normally wanna do this.\n\n489\n00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.141\nLet's just enable anonymous\nauthentication, make sure we can connect.\n\n490\n00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:27.914\nAnd make sure there's nothing\ngoing on that's wrong,\n\n491\n00:23:27.914 --> 00:23:29.580\njust from a troubleshooting perspective.\n\n492\n00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.220\nAnd let's make sure that's fine, and then\nlet's see if that changes anything for\n\n493\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.190\nus or not.\n\n494\n00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:38.000\nSo let's go in here, and\nlet's go in and see, and\n\n495\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.760\nalso let's just restart that real\nquick before we do anything else.\n\n496\n00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.670\nJust to make sure we don't have any issues\nwith that, so we'll take that down.\n\n497\n00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.960\nBring that back up real quick.\n\n498\n00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:50.010\nLittle real time troubleshooting for\nyou, cuz we add value at ITProTV.\n\n499\n00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:51.069\nEvery time we do something.\n\n500\n00:23:51.069 --> 00:23:53.290\nAnd yeah, this is the kind of stuff\nthat happens in the real world, right?\n\n501\n00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.290\nYou may go to connect and\nyou may think it's fine.\n\n502\n00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:56.572\nCuz it looks like I'm installed fine.\n\n503\n00:23:56.572 --> 00:23:57.363\nAnd it may not come up.\n\n504\n00:23:57.363 --> 00:23:58.941\nAnd you gotta go in and\nyou gotta check it out.\n\n505\n00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:02.539\nSo I'm just gonna do a quick refresh here,\nmake sure everything is good.\n\n506\n00:24:02.539 --> 00:24:05.319\nNow, let's go ahead and\nlet's see if we can actually connect out.\n\n507\n00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:08.250\nLet's do a quick browse and\nsee what's going on there.\n\n508\n00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.980\nSee if we can connect and\nget that to come up.\n\n509\n00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.217\nIt registered my click for\nthe browse, it may not have.\n\n510\n00:24:16.217 --> 00:24:17.466\nLet me try that one more time.\n\n511\n00:24:17.466 --> 00:24:18.790\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; There it goes.\n\n512\n00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, there, it's right there.\n\n513\n00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.700\nAnd there we go.\n\n514\n00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.020\nSo you see now,\nwe've got our prompt for Silverlight.\n\n515\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.850\nSo that looks like it is working.\n\n516\n00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.400\nLet's just go ahead and\ninstall that real quick.\n\n517\n00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.930\nYou saw me do this for\nthe other console, remember?\n\n518\n00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.170\nWe had to install Silverlight.\n\n519\n00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:34.700\nSometimes, you need to do that.\n\n520\n00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.220\nAnd so, that may have just been the issue\nthe first time we didn't get the prompt.\n\n521\n00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.540\nAnd then, once I went ahead and\n\n522\n00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.870\nrestarted it, you could see here that\nit is gonna come up with no trouble.\n\n523\n00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.850\nSo let's just go ahead and install that.\n\n524\n00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.210\nLet's put Silverlight in real quick,\nshould get that up and\n\n525\n00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.490\nrunning in just a moment here.\n\n526\n00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:49.580\nThis is for the app control.\n\n527\n00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.487\nYou remember we did that demo earlier.\n\n528\n00:24:51.487 --> 00:24:53.220\nAnd then, we actually had to\nput Silverlight in there.\n\n529\n00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.360\nWe're able to get it in the console.\n\n530\n00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.940\nSo that could be the same\nthing that's going on here.\n\n531\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:58.950\nSo we'll just go ahead.\n\n532\n00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.680\nLet's refresh that.\n\n533\n00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.690\nAnd just get that out of the way.\n\n534\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.020\nAnd now, we can see our consoles\ncoming up with no trouble.\n\n535\n00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.920\nCuz we already installed, we don't have\nto actually reinstall Silverlight.\n\n536\n00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.840\nI just hit browse like two or three times.\n\n537\n00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.471\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It stack up all the tabs before I\n\n538\n00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:13.448\nrealized what's going on.\n\n539\n00:25:13.448 --> 00:25:15.050\n&gt;&gt; Just reminded that it's there, right?\n\n540\n00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:17.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly,\ncuz if one is good, three is better.\n\n541\n00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.740\nSo, that's always good.\n\n542\n00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.660\nSo it takes a moment to\nload the first time.\n\n543\n00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.051\nYou could see it's kinda doing it's thing.\n\n544\n00:25:22.051 --> 00:25:25.960\nAnd then, eventually, once it does\ncome up, we should be able to get in.\n\n545\n00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.610\nWhat do we got there?\n\n546\n00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.590\nDebug, resource string's unavailable.\n\n547\n00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.690\nOkay, no big deal.\n\n548\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:34.754\nThat should allow us to get in,\nshowing us access is denied.\n\n549\n00:25:34.754 --> 00:25:36.890\nAll right, it looks like we may\nstill have a permission issue.\n\n550\n00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.770\nBut we got the console up and running.\n\n551\n00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.900\nWhat would probably need\nto happen at this point,\n\n552\n00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.450\na restart will typically\ndeal with these issues.\n\n553\n00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:47.270\nWe maybe having a problem because\nthe service is not fully instantiated.\n\n554\n00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.730\nThere maybe something going\non behind the scenes.\n\n555\n00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.495\nWe restart and then bring the console up,\n\n556\n00:25:51.495 --> 00:25:53.640\nit usually clears problem\nup with no trouble.\n\n557\n00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.910\nBut you could see that it's not\ntoo hard to troubleshoot that and\n\n558\n00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:56.930\nget that up and running.\n\n559\n00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.320\nWe just have to do a restart.\n\n560\n00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.250\nChances are good we do that,\nconsole will connect with no trouble, and\n\n561\n00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.470\nwe'll be able to take a look at it and\ninteract with it.\n\n562\n00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.580\nSo, we're gonna spare you the interest,\nthe waiting on that.\n\n563\n00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.300\nYou'll just assume, and\ntrust me on this one, that if you restart,\n\n564\n00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.600\nit will work with no trouble.\n\n565\n00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.893\nBut we'll call that one good.\n\n566\n00:26:13.893 --> 00:26:16.410\nYou saw how everything gets installed and\ncomes up.\n\n567\n00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:20.360\nOnce we're done with Orchestrator,\ngonna restart the system, tee it up.\n\n568\n00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.198\nWe're actually gonna go in,\nlast demo that we're gonna do for you.\n\n569\n00:26:23.198 --> 00:26:25.460\nAnd we're actually going to\ninstall Service Level Manager.\n\n570\n00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.980\nYou're gonna get a chance to see how that\ngets set up and stood up and configured.\n\n571\n00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.600\nAnd then, once we're done with that,\nwell, who knows what we're gonna do then.\n\n572\n00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.722\nCuz you have this crazy\nguy standing next to me.\n\n573\n00:26:33.722 --> 00:26:38.250\nSo he's got all sorts of crazy ideas\nthat we can go ahead and do for you.\n\n574\n00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.920\nBut I think what we'll probably\nwind up doing, if I'm not mistaken,\n\n575\n00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.154\nis just talking more about SKA.\n\n576\n00:26:42.154 --> 00:26:43.494\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; How we use that to do cloud-based\n\n577\n00:26:43.494 --> 00:26:44.032\nmanagement.\n\n578\n00:26:44.032 --> 00:26:44.614\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n579\n00:26:44.614 --> 00:26:45.940\nWell, we love the SKA, right?\n\n580\n00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.285\nIt's an amazing product and that's why\nwe're all here to learn more about it.\n\n581\n00:26:49.285 --> 00:26:51.245\nAdam, we do thank you for dropping by and\n\n582\n00:26:51.245 --> 00:26:53.851\nhelping us understand how\nto install Orchestrator.\n\n583\n00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:55.290\nThat's a very nice product.\n\n584\n00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.000\nAnd even giving us a test drive\naround the system a little bit,\n\n585\n00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.890\nsee kinda how it works,\nat least a high level view over that.\n\n586\n00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.710\nLike I said, thanks for dropping by,\nbut it looks like it's that time for\n\n587\n00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:05.860\nus to sign off.\n\n588\n00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.714\nThanks for watching for ITProTV.\n\n589\n00:27:07.714 --> 00:27:09.760\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n590\n00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.574\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n591\n00:27:10.574 --> 00:27:11.995\n&gt;&gt; And

with more Datacenter\nmonitoring with Microsoft SCOM.\n\n9\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.232\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio\nagain, you know him very well.\n\n10\n00:00:26.232 --> 00:00:28.350\nHis name is none other than Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.946\nAdam, welcome back, sir,\nI'm glad to have you, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.946 -->

00:00:42.790\nAnd yes, now SCOM, so that's all he had\nto do is go to the configuration console,\n\n16\n00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.061\nclick that button,\nright click, and [LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:49.775\nWe can hear your bracelets jingling.\n\n18\n00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:53.680\n[LAUGH] You're not completely silent,\nthere you go.\n\n19\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.890\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwe're just playing around with you.\n\n20\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.130\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\n\n21\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.910\nwe're gonna talk about how to\ninstall Service Level Manager.\n\n22\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.260\nThis is the last of the episodes\ninvolved with demonstrating how to do\n\n23\n00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.971\nthe configuration, installation, and\nsetup of all the key moving parts.\n\n24\n00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:10.598\nAll the components associated with\nthe Systems Center Suite, surrounding SCOM\n\n25\n00:01:10.598 --> 00:01:15.428\nwith all the environmental attributes,\nvalues, things that are gonna be required\n\n26\n00:01:15.428 --> 00:01:18.820\nto make it healthy and\nallow it to work its magic for us.\n\n27\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.040\nAnd Service Level Manager is\ngonna be really important,\n\n28\n00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.192\nthis is our equivalent product of hit,\nremedy, service task, service now,\n\n29\n00:01:26.192 --> 00:01:30.470\nany of those products out there you may\nbe familiar with that allow you to do\n\n30\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.400\nticketing, management, and\nmonitoring of your SLAs and use of KPIs.\n\n31\n00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.280\nIn order to be able to keep track of\nwhat's happening in the organization,\n\n32\n00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.770\nwe're gonna set this product up and\ndeploy it.\n\n33\n00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.750\nWe have gone ahead and\njust started the deployment off.\n\n34\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.117\nRun the beginning steps of the wizard,\nwalk through the hey,\n\n35\n00:01:49.117 --> 00:01:52.572\nlet's get the information in there,\nlet's accept the EULA.\n\n36\n00:01:52.572 --> 00:01:56.209\nLet's check off if we wanna do it as\nan eval, let's run the pre req check,\n\n37\n00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:57.629\nmake sure all that's done.\n\n38\n00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:00.829\nAnd then, once we do that,\nwe're gonna go ahead, and\n\n39\n00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.985\nwe're gonna click Next to\nbe able to continue on.\n\n40\n00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:07.835\nIt did say by the way, its solution cannot\ncontinue, don't have enough memory.\n\n41\n00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:10.402\nBut this is just the demo environment,\nwe're not worried about that.\n\n42\n00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:14.272\nIn the real world, we recommend at\nleast 8 gigs of memory on the box,\n\n43\n00:02:14.272 --> 00:02:17.112\nwe're deploying it to a VM with\nless than that, no problem.\n\n44\n00:02:17.112 --> 00:02:19.012\nIt'll work for\npurposes of what we're doing.\n\n45\n00:02:19.012 --> 00:02:21.952\nBut in case you saw that on the screen,\nI didn't bother to stop and\n\n46\n00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:23.442\nactually sight see there.\n\n47\n00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:26.282\nBut if you saw that, caught wind of that,\ndon't worry about that,\n\n48\n00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:29.552\nin the real world, you wanna pay\nattention to those install requirements.\n\n49\n00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:32.612\nHere we're gonna fudge that a little\nbit and just pretend that didn't exist.\n\n50\n00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:35.320\nSo we do get a little configure\ndatabase warning here.\n\n51\n00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.690\nThe collation specification for\nSQL is unsupported.\n\n52\n00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.488\nIt's warning us of that again,\nin the demo environment,\n\n53\n00:02:42.488 --> 00:02:44.870\na little bit different that when\nwe may do in the real world.\n\n54\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.450\nBut it's just telling us that we\nhave an unsupported SQL collation\n\n55\n00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.250\nthought process here.\n\n56\n00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.420\nI think the one that we've selected is,\nit doesn't tell us what it is.\n\n57\n00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.330\nWhatever the default is\nthat was configured for\n\n58\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.375\nall the other installs we've\nbeen doing is set up here.\n\n59\n00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:03.160\nWe modify that, but normally not\na problem, we'll click OK here.\n\n60\n00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.810\nWe'll then be able to wait for it to\nconnect out to the instance, you could see\n\n61\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.840\nit does, and then once we've done that,\nwe'll see that the instance is there.\n\n62\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.520\nWhat's our database server?\n\n63\n00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.970\nWhat's our default instance?\n\n64\n00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.519\nWhere are we installing, etc?\n\n65\n00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.340\nSo we're gonna find all that.\n\n66\n00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.530\nSee that there, we're then gonna go ahead,\n\n67\n00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.600\nand we're gonna accept\nall of those defaults.\n\n68\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.703\nI just wanna point out,\nmaybe we can go full-screen for\n\n69\n00:03:25.703 --> 00:03:27.064\njust half a second just to see this.\n\n70\n00:03:27.064 --> 00:03:31.135\nPoint out the default database\nnamed Service Manager and\n\n71\n00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:33.860\nour default instance in our machine.\n\n72\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.270\nSo we're gonna do that, we're gonna click\nNext, and then it's gonna ask us for\n\n73\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.820\nour management group name.\n\n74\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.510\nWe're gonna go ahead, it's best for\nour management group name.\n\n75\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.810\nRemember, we would already have\na management group name set up\n\n76\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.990\nfrom before, right?\n\n77\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.300\nSo, or we may have one, we may not,\nit depends on when we're installing this.\n\n78\n00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.350\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nput in a name for our management group.\n\n79\n00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.020\nWe'll call this practice labs.\n\n80\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.520\nIf we are going to use an existing one,\nwe just need to know what it will be.\n\n81\n00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.868\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do this.\n\n82\n00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:04.760\nIn the management group admin section,\nwho's gonna be involved with\n\n83\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.940\nadministering, we're gonna\nbrowse to set that up.\n\n84\n00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.530\nSo let's browse here,\nwe'll give that just a second.\n\n85\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.770\nIt's gonna bring up a standard box you're\nprobably pretty familiar with if we've\n\n86\n00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.650\nbeen doing this,\nwhere we have to put in a user name.\n\n87\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.200\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ntype in administrator.\n\n88\n00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.770\nAnd we'll just check that to make\nsure that it finds it for us.\n\n89\n00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.350\nIt gives us two options there.\n\n90\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.930\nNotice that we have\nthe administrators account, and\n\n91\n00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.500\nnotice that we have\nthe administrators group.\n\n92\n00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.090\nWe're gonna choose the administrators\naccount up at the top.\n\n93\n00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.881\nSpecify that, get that little underline\ntelling us it's validated the name.\n\n94\n00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:38.870\nWe'll come back, that'll be put in there.\n\n95\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.390\nCould've just typed in practice\nlabs administrator, but yeah,\n\n96\n00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.650\nthat's not as much fun.\n\n97\n00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.220\nAnd I have more stuff to talk about,\ncuz we do need to get out beyond that 15,\n\n98\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.420\n20 minute time mark, so.\n\n99\n00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.610\n&gt;&gt; We have to validate that guy that coded\nin the fact that you can hit check names\n\n100\n00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.960\nand underlines and\nvalidates that that works.\n\n101\n00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.575\n&gt;&gt; Well, you gotta make sure he\nfeels like he's important, cuz-\n\n102\n00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:54.519\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he did something.\n\n103\n00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:56.862\n&gt;&gt; He's valuable, we gotta make sure\nwe take advantage of [CROSSTALK]-\n\n104\n00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:57.448\n&gt;&gt; I actually really love that\n\n105\n00:04:57.448 --> 00:04:58.166\nfeature, to be honest with you.\n\n106\n00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.320\n&gt;&gt; It is kinda cool.\n\n107\n00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.230\nIt does prevent you from making stupid\nmistakes, which is hey, I'm choosing\n\n108\n00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.390\na machine name, a user name, a group name\nthat isn't correct, isn't recognized.\n\n109\n00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.860\nYou get all the way through, and it\ndies on you halfway through the install.\n\n110\n00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.105\nThose are the good old days.\n\n111\n00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:12.550\n&gt;&gt; Look, I put administrator.\n\n112\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that can happen, that can happen.\n\n113\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.871\nDoes happen, has happened,\nwill happen, I'm sure.\n\n114\n00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:21.007\nAll right, so on the configure the account\nfor service management services,\n\n115\n00:05:21.007 --> 00:05:23.680\nwe're gonna use a domain,\nas opposed to a local service account.\n\n116\n00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.260\nSo we're gonna click there,\ngonna type in our user name.\n\n117\n00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.490\nWe're gonna use that admin\naccount we were just using.\n\n118\n00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.250\nSo administrator, spell that correctly,\nspeaking of administrator.\n\n119\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.363\nSo we're gonna put that in, gonna type\nin our password, get that in there.\n\n120\n00:05:39.363 --> 00:05:41.630\nWe're gonna specify our domain.\n\n121\n00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.760\nWe'll pull that down,\nput our domain in there.\n\n122\n00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.720\nRemember, in your world, it'll be\nwhatever domain you're associated with.\n\n123\n00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.315\nHere it's our practice labs domain.\n\n124\n00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:51.890\nWe're gonna take advantage of that\ntest credentials item, click there.\n\n125\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.470\nThat's been accepted,\nwe can see that's all good.\n\n126\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.900\nSo now we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n127\n00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.330\nNow we have to configure the service\nmanager workflow account.\n\n128\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.260\nWe have several accounts we have\nto specify and configure, so\n\n129\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.280\nwe're gonna go through them.\n\n130\n00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.440\nAgain, we'll go ahead,\nwe'll do domain here.\n\n131\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.533\nAnd we'll specify our user name,\nadministrator.\n\n132\n00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:15.280\nAnd we'll specify our password.\n\n133\n00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.530\nAnd we will specify our domain,\nPractice Labs.\n\n134\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.520\nDo a little, Practice Labs, there we go.\n\n135\n00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.800\nTest credential, again,\nwe'll give that a second.\n\n136\n00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.820\nComes back with no trouble, and\n\n137\n00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.020\nthen once we've done that, we'll be\ndone with configuring our accounts.\n\n138\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.930\nWe'll click Next,\nwe got our help improve screen.\n\n139\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.820\nRemember in the real world,\nas we've been saying, opt in and say yes.\n\n140\n00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.000\nHere we're gonna say no, click Next.\n\n141\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.110\nWe got a little installation summary.\n\n142\n00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.313\nGonna let that sit there for a second,\njust so you can see what you're doing.\n\n143\n00:06:46.313 --> 00:06:49.720\nGive you the standard reminder I've been\ngiving you in every episode around this.\n\n144\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.080\nScreen capture this,\nuse it for your documentation.\n\n145\n00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.220\nMake your auditors and make your IA\nprofessionals in your organizations happy,\n\n146\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.760\nmake sure you have good documentation.\n\n147\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.780\nIt's gonna help you when it comes to BCDR,\nbusiness continuity disaster recovery,\n\n148\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.360\naround this or\nany of our products that we're installing.\n\n149\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.180\nYou can never go wrong with having too\nmuch documentation when it comes to how\n\n150\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.220\nyou install and configure.\n\n151\n00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.070\nSo take advantage of that, right?\n\n152\n00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.320\nAll right, we're gonna click Install,\nwe're gonna wait for that to go out and\n\n153\n00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.910\ndo its thing.\n\n154\n00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.970\nIt is gonna take a few\nminutes as you can see.\n\n155\n00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.320\nWe're gonna let that cook.\n\n156\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.870\nWhen we come back, we're gonna\nhave this all set up ready to go,\n\n157\n00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.170\nand we'll take a look at it for you.\n\n158\n00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.760\nAll right, so we can see the Service\nManager Setup Wizard has completed.\n\n159\n00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.590\nThis time,\nit's white circles with green checks.\n\n160\n00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.600\nI love it when we get this randomization\nof completion and success, right?\n\n161\n00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.040\nWe normally have green circle,\nwhite check.\n\n162\n00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.165\nWe now have white circle, green check, and\n\n163\n00:07:38.165 --> 00:07:40.935\nremember, we had just the check\nin one of the other ones.\n\n164\n00:07:40.935 --> 00:07:43.170\nSo it is just a potpourri,\n\n165\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:48.850\na cornucopia of random success\nmarkers here, as we go through.\n\n166\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.010\nBut we do see success, and\n\n167\n00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.530\nthe interesting thing about this one,\nwe're not actually done yet.\n\n168\n00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.200\nWe are in the sense we've installed.\n\n169\n00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.770\nBut we have to go through and\nhave to run the encryption key backup and\n\n170\n00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.670\nrestore wizard, so that we can back up the\nencryption keys for Service Level Manager.\n\n171\n00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.970\nI'm gonna show you how\nto do that right now.\n\n172\n00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.910\nWe do have the open encryption backup and\n\n173\n00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.650\nrestore wizard check mark\ndown at the bottom selector.\n\n174\n00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.490\nWe're gonna leave that there,\nwe're not gonna open the console yet,\n\n175\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.960\nwe're gonna run this first.\n\n176\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.430\nAnd then where we double\ntake a look at the console.\n\n177\n00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.286\nSo we're gonna go ahead and click Close.\n\n178\n00:08:17.286 --> 00:08:19.274\nThis is gonna launch the wizard for us,\n\n179\n00:08:19.274 --> 00:08:22.540\nI'm just gonna kill the installation\nmedia in the background.\n\n180\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.920\nJust get that out of the way, so\nwe have a little room on the screen.\n\n181\n00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.220\nLet me just bring this over,\nkind of centered, so we can see that.\n\n182\n00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:35.640\nWe'll offset that just a little bit, so\nwe can see what that says right there,\n\n183\n00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.260\nencrypting key, backup or restore wizard,\nwe're gonna click Next on this.\n\n184\n00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.430\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ndecide what we're doing.\n\n185\n00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.440\nWe haven't backed up the key yet,\nso obviously,\n\n186\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.160\nbacking up first, restoring second, right?\n\n187\n00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.700\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna back up the key.\n\n188\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.880\nNotice by default, it is selected and\nthat is the option we're gonna go for.\n\n189\n00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.910\nWe'll click Next.\n\n190\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.150\nWe have to browse and\nspecify where we're gonna put this.\n\n191\n00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.830\nWe're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna specify or just browse, and\n\n192\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.570\nuse the default path.\n\n193\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.050\nWe'll do it in our documents\ndirectory locally for\n\n194\n00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.540\nthe user logged on that's\ndoing the install.\n\n195\n00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.160\nFor you, you would obviously\nput this somewhere more secure.\n\n196\n00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.980\nSpecify a place where you're gonna be able\nto store that key or retrieve it, and\n\n197\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.270\nthen use it from there when necessary.\n\n198\n00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.240\nI'm just gonna call mine SM for\nService Manager key.\n\n199\n00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.060\nSo I'm gonna call the file SM key,\nall right.\n\n200\n00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.440\nSo we'll put that in there.\n\n201\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.140\nYou'll see it's in the directory,\n\n202\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.850\nMy Documents directory, where we did the\ndemo, if you remember, for setting up and\n\n203\n00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.610\ntaking a look at various things and\ndownloading and putting them in.\n\n204\n00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.430\nWe may have information floating\naround a variety of places.\n\n205\n00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.480\nSo we're just gonna store it here.\n\n206\n00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.480\nWe'll click Open, got that in there.\n\n207\n00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.710\nPopulates that path for us,\nreally nice, we'll click Next.\n\n208\n00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.410\nAre we gonna use a password with that?\n\n209\n00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.880\nIf we wanna use a password,\nassign one to the file.\n\n210\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.090\nSo we'll put our password in there.\n\n211\n00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:55.510\nJust hit Tab for that,\nwe'll do that, click Next.\n\n212\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.190\nAnd then, just wait for\nthat, we'll click Complete.\n\n213\n00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.040\nSo, we have that all set up, ready to go,\nreally, nothing more involved than that.\n\n214\n00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.730\nIt's just that way, we have the key.\n\n215\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.040\nAnd if there's a problem,\nwe can obviously run the restore procedure\n\n216\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.660\nusing the same program, and run it\nthe opposite way and restore the key.\n\n217\n00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.780\nWe're gonna go in and\nload the console now.\n\n218\n00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.360\nSo, we're gonna go to our Start workspace.\n\n219\n00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.510\nWe'll see that we do not have\nit installed here as a tile.\n\n220\n00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.720\nWe haven't added it in.\n\n221\n00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.070\nWe have added in some of the other\nones we've been working with.\n\n222\n00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.830\nWe can either go browse for it, or\nwe can just search for it either way.\n\n223\n00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.570\nSo if we just search right from here,\nstart typing service,\n\n224\n00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:34.650\nyou'll see Service Manager Console comes\nup right down here, about halfway down.\n\n225\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:39.370\nGonna right click on that, we'll do a pin\nto start just so we can see it right here.\n\n226\n00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.915\nGet out of there, we'll right click,\nwe'll do pin to task bar, so we have it.\n\n227\n00:10:42.915 --> 00:10:46.120\nAnd we'll do a run as administrator,\nright?\n\n228\n00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.070\nSo we're gonna load that up real quick.\n\n229\n00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.421\nWe could see that when we do that,\nwe are then prompted for the connect to,\n\n230\n00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:53.708\nwhat's the server name\nwe're gonna connect to.\n\n231\n00:10:53.708 --> 00:10:56.910\nGonna connect to our server\nwhere we did the install.\n\n232\n00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.370\nAssuming all the services are running,\neverything's running well,\n\n233\n00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.140\nshould be able to get in there\nafter just a momentary pause.\n\n234\n00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.450\nIt's loading up right now,\nyou'll see that come up.\n\n235\n00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:09.400\nOnce it does, you'll see that we have the\nService Level Management console in here.\n\n236\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.410\nWe've got some workspace areas\nwe can quickly identify.\n\n237\n00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.350\nWe've got the administration workspace.\n\n238\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.230\nWe have the library workspace,\nwork items, and configuration items.\n\n239\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.650\nWe'll be going through and\ntake a look at this product and\n\n240\n00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.250\ntalking more about it some\nof our upcoming episodes.\n\n241\n00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.592\nBut remember, this is where we're gonna be\nable to take the output of Ops Manager,\n\n242\n00:11:27.592 --> 00:11:30.180\nonce we create the configuration\n\n243\n00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.230\nthat binds these two products\ntogether through a connector.\n\n244\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.424\nAnd allow the alerts that are generated\nthere to actually then come over here and\n\n245\n00:11:37.424 --> 00:11:40.490\nopen up configuration items,\nwork items, tickets, and\n\n246\n00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.822\ndo resolution, or\nwalk through the resolution chains for us.\n\n247\n00:11:43.822 --> 00:11:46.430\nSo we're gonna see this synergy\nstarting to take place.\n\n248\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.434\nWe'll have some upcoming episodes where\nwe talk about how do we configure all\n\n249\n00:11:50.434 --> 00:11:54.825\nthe interaction and the interconnection\nthat is required between these products.\n\n250\n00:11:54.825 --> 00:11:57.893\nSo they could talk to each other, and\nwe'll be setting that up here and\n\n251\n00:11:57.893 --> 00:11:59.330\nbeing able to work with it.\n\n252\n00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.500\nAnd once we've done that,\n\n253\n00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.480\nwe'll then be able to see\nthe information flowing back and forth.\n\n254\n00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.550\nSo we'll be taking a look at that\nsome of our upcoming discussions, but\n\n255\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.183\nyou can see as we get in and set this up,\n\n256\n00:12:08.183 --> 00:12:11.538\nthis one does take a little bit longer\nthan most of the others to instantiate.\n\n257\n00:12:11.538 --> 00:12:13.980\nIt's about a 15 minute install,\ngive or take.\n\n258\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.700\nIt's amazing how that time just flies by.\n\n259\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like nothing.\n\n260\n00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.910\nBut it does take a little\nbit longer than the other.\n\n261\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.620\nSo don't be surprised when you go\nto install Service Level Manager\n\n262\n00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.550\nthat it does take longer.\n\n263\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.390\nThe main reason, and\nI was talking about this with Daniel while\n\n264\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:31.390\nwe were waiting on it to finish, is the\nneed to import all the management packs.\n\n265\n00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.750\nYou could see we have 137 of them sitting\nthere that have been imported by default,\n\n266\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.730\nand there's quite a number of them for\n\n267\n00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.630\nService Level Manager and this is what\ntakes the longest amount of time.\n\n268\n00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.480\nIt's gonna copy all of that information,\nbring it in, and\n\n269\n00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.480\nset it up the right way as part of\nconfiguration of the tool initially.\n\n270\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.970\nSo this is why it does tend\nto take a little bit longer\n\n271\n00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.460\nthan some of the other programs\nthat we've done the demos for.\n\n272\n00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.110\nSo just so you have a sense of that.\n\n273\n00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.870\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Adam,\n\n274\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.420\nthanks for walking us through\ninstalling the Service Manager.\n\n275\n00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.070\nLike you said, not too difficult, but\n\n276\n00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:04.590\na little bit of time consuming on the\nplate there, so just be prepared for that.\n\n277\n00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.070\nThat being said, looks like we've\ncome to the end of this episode.\n\n278\n00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.810\nAdam, thanks so much for joining us today.\n\n279\n00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.410\nWe do thank our audience for watching,\n\n280\n00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.270\nbut signing off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n281\n00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.372\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n282\n00:13:15.372 --> 00:13:17.883\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n283\n00:13:17.883 --> 00:13:23.860\n[MUSIC]\n\n284\n00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.710\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:10.736\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.736 --> 00:00:12.257\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:14.077\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.077 --> 00:00:17.040\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.160\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.280\nwe're back with more of our series on data\ncenter monitoring using Microsoft SCOM.\n\n9\n00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.980\nAnd joining us back in the studio,\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.900\nAdam, welcome back, so\nglad to have you again, today.\n\n11\n00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.160\n&gt;&gt; Always glad to be here, hanging out\nwith you and all the kind studio and\n\n12\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.495\naudience folk out there,\nand I expert TV event.\n\n13\n00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.355\nWe're gonna continue our conversations,\ncome take a look at\n\n14\n00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:43.535\none of the interesting, important,\nalthough often underrated topics,\n\n15\n00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:46.975\nassociated with using SCOM which is,\nhow do we migrate?\n\n16\n00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:52.117\nHow do we get from SCOM 2007,\nlet's say hypothetically or\n\n17\n00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:59.208\n12 or 12 SP1 into 12 R2, we have a very\nclearly defined pathway have to follow.\n\n18\n00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:02.221\nGot some information that'll\nmake that helpful for you,\n\n19\n00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:05.861\nthe basic concept is real simple,\nI'm gonna give it to you right now.\n\n20\n00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:08.955\nAnd then essentially we're done,\nit's like a 30 second episode.\n\n21\n00:01:08.955 --> 00:01:10.139\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Which we've never done before but\n\n22\n00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:12.653\nwe're gonna extend that, we're not\nreally gonna do a 30 second episode.\n\n23\n00:01:12.653 --> 00:01:16.438\nBut I could literally tell you everything\nyou need to know in 30 seconds.\n\n24\n00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:19.755\nWhich is going from SCOM 2007,\n\n25\n00:01:19.755 --> 00:01:25.173\n2012 and/or 2012 SP1 is\nreally very specific,\n\n26\n00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:30.588\nvery easily defined,\nvery linear path, which is you must\n\n27\n00:01:30.588 --> 00:01:36.460\nstop at every version up through 2012 R2,\non your way.\n\n28\n00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.185\nSo, to go from SCOM 2007, you can't go\nright to 12 R2, you got to go to 12,\n\n29\n00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:47.348\nthen 12SP1, then 12 R2,\nif you're in 12, you gotta go 12 SP1,\n\n30\n00:01:47.348 --> 00:01:52.129\nthen 12 R2, if you're in 12 SP1,\nyou gotta go SP1 to 12 R2.\n\n31\n00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:56.631\nSo, how you do it is really just\na question of degrees, right?\n\n32\n00:01:56.631 --> 00:02:01.113\nIt's a question of going through,\ndoing as many as three rounds of\n\n33\n00:02:01.113 --> 00:02:04.967\nupgrades along the way,\nif you're gonna be doing that.\n\n34\n00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:09.004\nAnd as you're doing that,\nas opposed to installing brand new,\n\n35\n00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:13.491\nyou are just adding in,\nall the additional capabilities, features,\n\n36\n00:02:13.491 --> 00:02:16.886\nbinary bits, updates,\netc that bring you current.\n\n37\n00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:20.717\nAnd we'll talk about and show you just\nsome of the guidance associated with that.\n\n38\n00:02:20.717 --> 00:02:24.287\nThere's some real good documentation\nout on the web, it's real simple to do,\n\n39\n00:02:24.287 --> 00:02:27.022\nwe'll point out some things for\nyou'll want to be aware of.\n\n40\n00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:32.799\nGot to make sure you're at a certain\nstarting point level in SCOM 2007, you\n\n41\n00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:39.111\ngotta be 2007 R2 cumulative update four\nin order to start down that upgrade path.\n\n42\n00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:42.377\nSo, you just wanna know that, that may\nnot apply to a lot of you, by the way.\n\n43\n00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:46.080\nA lot of you may already be running\nnewer iterations of the product, so,\n\n44\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.640\nthat's fine, no big deal, but\nif you're running all the version,\n\n45\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.570\ngot to make sure you read\nat least that version.\n\n46\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.404\nIf you're not, got to go\ndownload the appropriate updates,\n\n47\n00:02:54.404 --> 00:02:56.375\nmake sure you have that capability there.\n\n48\n00:02:56.375 --> 00:03:00.710\nBut once you're at 2007 R2\ncumulative update four, we call CU,\n\n49\n00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.240\ncumulative update four,\nyou're ready to start going.\n\n50\n00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.213\nYou go from there to 12, from 12 to 12SP1,\nand then from 12SP1 into 12R2.\n\n51\n00:03:10.213 --> 00:03:14.012\nSo, It is a bit of a convoluted process,\nyou remember, we do movies all the time,\n\n52\n00:03:14.012 --> 00:03:16.450\nwe don't really,\nI don't think we've ever done-\n\n53\n00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.470\n&gt;&gt; We do love the movies.\n\n54\n00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.251\n&gt;&gt; We do love the movies.\n\n55\n00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:19.897\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I've got a different approach for\n\n56\n00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:22.833\nyou at the movies, we've never\nreally done old school video games,\n\n57\n00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:23.802\nas opposed to movies.\n\n58\n00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:24.941\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n59\n00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:28.702\n&gt;&gt; But when I, I'm old enough that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:03:28.702 --> 00:03:30.021\n&gt;&gt; I remember when Pong first came\n\n61\n00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:30.583\nout, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:31.490\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I was alive.\n\n63\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.246\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was, so,\n\n64\n00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.650\nthat's a whole generational thing.\n\n65\n00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.320\nBut I mean, I remember, cuz we had\nrestaurants when I was growing up.\n\n66\n00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.920\nFor many years my family's been\nin the restaurant business and\n\n67\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.580\nI remember in one of our sub\nshops we actually had one of\n\n68\n00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.480\nthe first tabletop Pong\ngames when they came out.\n\n69\n00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.390\nIt was like a big deal, you put your food\non it and you'd play it or whatever but\n\n70\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.060\nI remember playing that when I was a kid.\n\n71\n00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.320\nSo, Pong is not thing I'm\ngonna use as the analogy here,\n\n72\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.950\nbut you remember playing Frogger?\n\n73\n00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You remember?\n\n74\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.995\nSo, you remember you have to jump like\none log over, you have to get all the way\n\n75\n00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:04.293\nacross and not get run over by the mad\ntrucker or get swept down the stream.\n\n76\n00:04:04.293 --> 00:04:05.190\n&gt;&gt; It was a fun game.\n\n77\n00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.421\n&gt;&gt; It is a really cool game, so, if you've\nnever played Frogger, you gotta go out and\n\n78\n00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:11.174\nfind one of the emulators online,\n\n79\n00:04:11.174 --> 00:04:14.980\nyou can find all the original emulators\nthese days, really easy to do.\n\n80\n00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.453\nI still have my original Atari,\nby the way, with all my game cartridges.\n\n81\n00:04:17.453 --> 00:04:18.750\n&gt;&gt; Do you really, good for you.\n\n82\n00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.160\n&gt;&gt; I hook it up every so\noften and I play it.\n\n83\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.800\n&gt;&gt; That is awesome.\n\n84\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.238\n&gt;&gt; I have the paddles to play tennis and\nplay Pong on.\n\n85\n00:04:23.238 --> 00:04:23.830\n&gt;&gt; That is so awesome.\n\n86\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.246\n&gt;&gt; I got the joysticks to play\nAsteroids and I got Downhill Skier,\n\n87\n00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:28.810\nremember the downhill?\n\n88\n00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n89\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.695\n&gt;&gt; The bear that would\ncome out of the woods,\n\n90\n00:04:30.695 --> 00:04:31.851\nlike out of nowhere and just eat you.\n\n91\n00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:32.547\n&gt;&gt; Eat you, yes.\n\n92\n00:04:32.547 --> 00:04:33.442\n&gt;&gt; And I got chess.\n\n93\n00:04:33.442 --> 00:04:36.530\n[CROSSTALK] I got probably\nlike 30 cartridges.\n\n94\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.456\n&gt;&gt; You know, I've rolled over\na million points on Asteroids.\n\n95\n00:04:39.456 --> 00:04:40.670\n&gt;&gt; I'm Defender too, a defender.\n\n96\n00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.470\n&gt;&gt; Defender's,\none of the hardest games ever made.\n\n97\n00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.784\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was-\n&gt;&gt; You think you're a gamer,\n\n98\n00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.041\ngo play defender and weep.\n\n99\n00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:49.499\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I remember when Defender\n\n100\n00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:55.027\ncame out, it was a stand alone up in\nthe arcade along with Galaga and Tempest.\n\n101\n00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:56.466\nYou remember Tempest,\nyou go around the barrel-\n\n102\n00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:57.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n103\n00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.920\nWes is really good at Tempest actually.\n\n104\n00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.768\nI love Tempest,\nthey're all really cool games.\n\n105\n00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:04.860\nBut Frogger is a good analogy for this,\nbecause Frogger, you've gotta jump\n\n106\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.590\nliterally level to level, log to logs,\narea in the road to get across.\n\n107\n00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.991\nIt's kinda the same analogy,\nat least in my mind, it's working for me,\n\n108\n00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:12.701\nmay not work for you.\n\n109\n00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:15.320\n&gt;&gt; Now Adam, that begs the question.\n\n110\n00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.550\nWould it be better for us to just do\na side-by-side upgrade, where I just stand\n\n111\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.170\nup 2012 R2 box next to my 2007 and\nthen just migrate the data over.\n\n112\n00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, we call an upgrade this\npath of going from 2007 R2,\n\n113\n00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.742\ninto each iteration that's what we call\nan upgrade, what you're thinking of,\n\n114\n00:05:34.742 --> 00:05:39.810\nwe use this terms kind of sometimes,\nnot necessarily, using them the right way.\n\n115\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.680\nThe upgrade concept is that concept,\nyou're thinking of doing, as you said,\n\n116\n00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.552\na side by side or essentially, an install\nthat runs parallel and then being able\n\n117\n00:05:49.552 --> 00:05:54.087\nto migrate as opposed to upgrade,\nright, migrate certain things over.\n\n118\n00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:57.380\nSo, we would be talking about a migration,\nnot an upgrade.\n\n119\n00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.320\nI get the concept definitely, but\nwe just want to use the right language.\n\n120\n00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.890\n&gt;&gt; Totally.\n&gt;&gt; Just because in our documentation\n\n121\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.900\non the Microsoft website,\nas we talk about, as you read about it.\n\n122\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.532\nYou'll see upgrade referring to this\npath of starting in 2007 R2 and\n\n123\n00:06:10.532 --> 00:06:14.191\ninterrating through these\nchanges to get into 12 or 2,\n\n124\n00:06:14.191 --> 00:06:18.915\nyou won't see migration use this a term,\nyou'll see upgrade uses a term.\n\n125\n00:06:18.915 --> 00:06:21.875\nWhen we think about migration, and\nwe could think about migration,\n\n126\n00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:25.039\nwhen we think about migration,\nwe're thinking about that side by side,\n\n127\n00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.255\nthat's kind of the thought\nprocess we're using.\n\n128\n00:06:27.255 --> 00:06:28.747\nI'm just scrolling down here for\n\n129\n00:06:28.747 --> 00:06:32.264\none second to get to something I wanna\nsay about migration, cuz it's kind of at\n\n130\n00:06:32.264 --> 00:06:35.911\nthe bottom of my list of topics as opposed\nto the top, so, it's a good question.\n\n131\n00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:39.303\nBut we specifically refer to,\nwhat we call coexistence, so,\n\n132\n00:06:39.303 --> 00:06:43.341\nthat's actually what we do,\nparallel side by side, kinda terminology.\n\n133\n00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:47.764\nMigration is the term we use, it's what\nyou'll see in the documentation, but\n\n134\n00:06:47.764 --> 00:06:52.715\nwe talk about it as being a coexistence\nof 2007 R2 with 12 R2, or you know, 12,\n\n135\n00:06:52.715 --> 00:06:55.030\n12 R2, whatever we're doing.\n\n136\n00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:01.040\nAnd specifically what we talk about there,\nis the idea of multi homing the agents.\n\n137\n00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.980\nSo, that way the agent can report in, to\ndifferent management groups and give data\n\n138\n00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.938\nto one set of management servers or the\nother while it's being moved between them.\n\n139\n00:07:08.938 --> 00:07:12.040\nAnd we'll talk a little bit more about\nthat in a few minutes, we'll get to that.\n\n140\n00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.370\nBut specifically,\n\n141\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.860\nwhat I was just making sure, I looked\nup real quick while we were talking.\n\n142\n00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.990\nWe can multihome up to four different\nmanagement groups, was the thing I had\n\n143\n00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.540\nto look up since i don't remember all\nthe numbers off the top of my head.\n\n144\n00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.810\nIf we do the coexistence\njust side by side.\n\n145\n00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.030\nSo, we actually can have different\nphases of different management groups at\n\n146\n00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.260\ndifferent levels, and actually have agents\nreporting into each of them, as they go.\n\n147\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.157\nThe nice thing is those agents\nare isolated the reporting\n\n148\n00:07:36.157 --> 00:07:39.653\ntakes place kinda like this, so,\nthe data is not shared among them,\n\n149\n00:07:39.653 --> 00:07:42.572\nit's gonna be kept in that\nparticular silos we operate.\n\n150\n00:07:42.572 --> 00:07:47.713\nBut overtime, we do have to cut over\neventually, so, we definitely could stand\n\n151\n00:07:47.713 --> 00:07:53.023\none up and then simply move the agent in a\nmigrate and deal with that whole scenario.\n\n152\n00:07:53.023 --> 00:07:55.215\nWe have upgrade the agent obviously.\n\n153\n00:07:55.215 --> 00:07:58.774\nFrom the old SCOM 2007 agent into\nthe new version we talked about,\n\n154\n00:07:58.774 --> 00:08:01.430\nthe Microsoft Monitoring Agent\nis being the name for\n\n155\n00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.410\nthe new virtual to do the upgrade.\n\n156\n00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.680\nWe'd have to upgrade it because the new\nagent can talk to the old infrastructure\n\n157\n00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.410\nbut the old agent cannot talk\nto the new infrastructure.\n\n158\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.980\nSo the old SCOM 2007\nagents can't report in and\n\n159\n00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.620\ntalk to new management groups cuz\nthe bits are totally different.\n\n160\n00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.520\nBu if we upgrade the agent, we can,\nthrough backwards compatibility and\n\n161\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.740\nthrough the RMS emulator role we've\ntalked about in prior episodes, allow for\n\n162\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.960\nthat communication to take place.\n\n163\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.600\nSo, we definitely could do it either way,\nand a lot of times,\n\n164\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.420\nwe will stand up new infrastructure, as\nopposed to upgrading old infrastructure,\n\n165\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.780\nespecially if it's physical-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n166\n00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.730\n&gt;&gt; Cuz back then,\nit probably was physical boxes.\n\n167\n00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.120\nIt's wasn't virtualized.\n\n168\n00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.720\nSo we're talking, probably six,\nseven, eight years ago now,\n\n169\n00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.340\nif you were running 2007 R2.\n\n170\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:49.150\nAnd the reality is, or 2007, and\nultimately maybe R2 as part of that.\n\n171\n00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.840\nYou would probably still have physical\nservers, or they'd be on their way out,\n\n172\n00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.480\nthey'd be on the edge of that usability\nwindow that we often talk about.\n\n173\n00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.710\nMaybe three to five, or six years,\nsomething like that for hardware.\n\n174\n00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:05.250\nYou may not invest in upgrading that\nhardware to make it viable to that host.\n\n175\n00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.880\nYou may decide, hey you know what?\n\n176\n00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.220\nYou know, kind of end the life.\n\n177\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.870\nWe're gonna virtualized anyway.\n\n178\n00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.060\nYou might be going down that road,\nmaybe will upgrade,\n\n179\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.020\nquote unquote, will upgrade from P to V.\n\n180\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.730\nAnd so we'll virtualized it.\n\n181\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.490\nAnd then as a result,\nwe can walk through that upgrade path.\n\n182\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.700\nIf we're installing new, very likely\ntoday, it's gonna be a virtual instance.\n\n183\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.810\nIt's rare you would install\nphysical infrastructure.\n\n184\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.080\nI mean, you could, don't get me wrong,\nbut you can run most of this stuff,\n\n185\n00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.330\nif not all of it,\nbe virtualized today anyway.\n\n186\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.850\nAnd if you're running\nlarge-scale infrastructure and\n\n187\n00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.730\nmonitoring, you probably have virtualized\ninfrastructure you're running to being\n\n188\n00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.670\nwith, you might as well monitor\nit using virtualization.\n\n189\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.700\nThis makes a lot of sense meaning\nvirtualized infrastructure being used to\n\n190\n00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.670\nrun all the underlying information.\n\n191\n00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.840\nSo, we're probably seeing\na mixture of that stuff,\n\n192\n00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.080\nso it's very likely that\nscenario does exist.\n\n193\n00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.270\nSo it's a pretty good thought process,\nin the sense we may do either or.\n\n194\n00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.040\nLet's take a look just\nreal quick if we could.\n\n195\n00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:02.090\nAnd let's talk about some of those web\nsites, just some of the things that will\n\n196\n00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:07.020\nhelp us specifically to go through and\nset up the migration scenario,\n\n197\n00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.140\nor the upgrade scenario depending\non what we're doing in our minds.\n\n198\n00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.850\nWe'll focus on upgrading first.\n\n199\n00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.445\nHow do we walk through these various\nstages, what are the specific checklists,\n\n200\n00:10:15.445 --> 00:10:17.620\npre-reqs, should install that kinda stuff.\n\n201\n00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.750\nLike I mentioned, certain build and\ncumulative update levels\n\n202\n00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.010\nmay have to be applied at certain\nkey points in the process.\n\n203\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.740\nSo there's things you\njust wanna know about.\n\n204\n00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.770\nSo, we put all these URLs\nin the show notes for you.\n\n205\n00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.560\nAlways encourage you to go out,\ntake a look at the URLs, number one.\n\n206\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.850\nJust to make sure they're still valid.\n\n207\n00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.020\nCuz obviously they may move\naround from time to time.\n\n208\n00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.930\nSo you wanna check them and\n\n209\n00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.584\nif they're not, usually they'll redirect\nyou to the most up-to-date information.\n\n210\n00:10:41.584 --> 00:10:43.010\nNumber two, every so often,\n\n211\n00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.970\nalthough this information's\nprobably not really gonna change.\n\n212\n00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.670\nBut in other areas of the courses and/or\nthe shows and episodes that we discussed,\n\n213\n00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.480\nyou do hear me refer from time to time in\nfact that hey, you're at this point in\n\n214\n00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.420\ntime, we're putting this content together,\nthis is what you need to do.\n\n215\n00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.080\nThat may change in the future,\nlook on the web for\n\n216\n00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.630\nthe latest update for hardware\ncompatibility, for network monitoring.\n\n217\n00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.580\nWhat are all the vendors that we monitor,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n218\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.230\nThat's stuff updates over time and\nyou also wanna go out on the web and\n\n219\n00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.740\nget the most recent information on that.\n\n220\n00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.020\nSo, upgrading.\n\n221\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.130\nReal simple here.\n\n222\n00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.310\nWe start off with free TechNet,\nwhat the overview for upgrading is, and\n\n223\n00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.740\nthey give us links to everything.\n\n224\n00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.670\nWe have a process flow diagram.\n\n225\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.110\nIf we can go full screen for\njust a second so\n\n226\n00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.820\nyou can see some of\nthe links I'm pointing to.\n\n227\n00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.325\nThe process flow diagram or\nupgrade path checklist for Ops Manager.\n\n228\n00:11:30.325 --> 00:11:33.345\nNow, just so you know,\nwrite a little full disclosure here.\n\n229\n00:11:33.345 --> 00:11:34.655\nSo you get excited about this.\n\n230\n00:11:34.655 --> 00:11:37.295\nI see something like this\nupgrade process flow diagram.\n\n231\n00:11:37.295 --> 00:11:38.295\nI'm like that's cool.\n\n232\n00:11:38.295 --> 00:11:39.695\nThey've got a Visio chart.\n\n233\n00:11:39.695 --> 00:11:42.770\nSomething I can use it,\nit's a check list, be pretty simple.\n\n234\n00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.850\nYou click on that link unfortunately,\nit doesn't exist anymore.\n\n235\n00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.023\nAnd it actually takes you out to just a,\nnot a random site, but\n\n236\n00:11:50.023 --> 00:11:53.150\na site that has nothing to do\nwith process flow and diagrams.\n\n237\n00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.310\nSo, don't get too excited about that one.\n\n238\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.930\nBut the upgrade with checklist, or\nthe upgrade path with checklist?\n\n239\n00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.770\nThat one does actually have a nice\nlittle standardized chart you can use to\n\n240\n00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:03.570\nwalk through things.\n\n241\n00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.760\nJust be aware of that.\n\n242\n00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.650\nSupporting configurations for\nwhat running 12 will look like.\n\n243\n00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.940\nSo, what's the hardware,\nwhat's the software requirements?\n\n244\n00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.760\nThat link is good.\n\n245\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.350\nHow do we upgrade hardware and\nsoftware to meet our system requirements?\n\n246\n00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.930\nTalk about maybe doing a P to V.\n\n247\n00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.140\nLet's go to virtual conversion.\n\n248\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.470\nSo wanna read up on some of that,\nthose links would be helpful here.\n\n249\n00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.530\nSupported configs for\nsystem 12, our two Ops Manager.\n\n250\n00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.250\nSo you know when you look\nat something like this, for\n\n251\n00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.900\ninstance, what you'll get here.\n\n252\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.570\nJust give us a second to\nload the new page up.\n\n253\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:38.970\nAnd what we'll see is we get information\nthat allows us to link here.\n\n254\n00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.000\nHow do we prep our\nenvironment to get ready?\n\n255\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.830\nWhat are the basic requirements for\n2012 SP1?\n\n256\n00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.050\nWhat are the requirements for 12 itself?\n\n257\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.810\nAnd as we look through each one,\n\n258\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.510\nespecially the prepping,\nthis is the one I'll click on.\n\n259\n00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.310\nJust to show you here.\n\n260\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.330\nI have this on a separate page,\nbut let's just take a look.\n\n261\n00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.880\nThe prepping one is really nice, because\nit gives you the first things to do list.\n\n262\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.450\nThis gives you all the pre-reqs.\n\n263\n00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.930\nTells you what the environmental\nrequirements are.\n\n264\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.960\nMakes sure you have all\nthe information that you need.\n\n265\n00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.730\nI've talked about the value of\nreading release notes before.\n\n266\n00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.480\nImportant for you to be doing that.\n\n267\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.140\nTalk about how to virtualize.\n\n268\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.780\nIf we're gonna run virtualization as I\nsuggested, how are we gonna do that?\n\n269\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:18.530\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n270\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.089\nWe're gonna run Ops Manager on Azure.\n\n271\n00:13:21.089 --> 00:13:24.930\nIf we're gonna run it on Azure,\nyou know how are we gonna do that, right?\n\n272\n00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.910\nBe nice that they put the competitive\ninformation on here for AWS and\n\n273\n00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:28.990\nyou know everything else.\n\n274\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.250\nYou know that vap but you can extrapolate\nkinda figure that out, right?\n\n275\n00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.790\nYou know how that would work but\nyeah we do have all that, so\n\n276\n00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.090\nyou see that here,\nminimum screen resolution.\n\n277\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.710\nYou guys can figure that part out.\n\n278\n00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.305\nMinimum hardware, right, so\nyou wanna check that out.\n\n279\n00:13:42.305 --> 00:13:46.290\n64-bit everything today, so\nyou just wanna know about that.\n\n280\n00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.230\nMinimum OSs, .NET,\nPowerShell, things like that.\n\n281\n00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.720\nWe talked about some of that before.\n\n282\n00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.090\nMinimum SQL requirements,\n\n283\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.610\nI've been through this list with\nyou in some of the prior episodes.\n\n284\n00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:00.160\nBut one of the nice things about it is,\nit breaks it down for you by feature here.\n\n285\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.010\nTells you what all the different\ninstall components are,\n\n286\n00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.750\nwhat the requirements will be and I'm just\ntracking down the side here by the way.\n\n287\n00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.660\nThis nav area gives you everything\nif you want to just jump\n\n288\n00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.380\nto SQL server requirements.\n\n289\n00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.260\nI've shown you the firewall requirements\nin some prior episodes, but\n\n290\n00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.620\nonly from ports that have to be open.\n\n291\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.910\nThe different communication\npathways we use.\n\n292\n00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.770\nIt's a really nice set up.\n\n293\n00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.650\nA lot of the time some of\nthe documentation that we have used or\n\n294\n00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.460\nwe get from a vendor,\nwhether it's Microsoft or any vendor.\n\n295\n00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.420\nIt kinda makes some\nassumptions about what we know,\n\n296\n00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.800\nit makes some assumptions about the most\nlikely way we're gonna do this space time.\n\n297\n00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.240\nWhat the vendor recommends and\n\n298\n00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.610\nit doesn't always do a great job\nof laying out all the scenarios.\n\n299\n00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.080\nAll of the paths and\nall of that information.\n\n300\n00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.460\nThat the average IT professional\nmay not necessarily know.\n\n301\n00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.290\nThey just make a lot of assumptions.\n\n302\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.870\nAnd I like the fact,\nespecially, in this product.\n\n303\n00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.140\nLine the pseudo-products,\nwhere it is really complex.\n\n304\n00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.360\nThere's a lot of interaction and\na lot of things that have to go right, for\n\n305\n00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.750\nall the products to work well together.\n\n306\n00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.980\nMicrosoft has done a great job.\n\n307\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.490\nAnd you got to give credit\nwhere credit is due, right?\n\n308\n00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:07.039\nBecause here we do certainly tend to\ncall vendors out when things go wrong.\n\n309\n00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:09.246\nAnd we tend to spend a lot of\ntime harping on the negative, and\n\n310\n00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:12.250\ncomplaining about the fact things\ndon't always work the way they should.\n\n311\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.852\nBut we should equally give them\npraise when they do something, right.\n\n312\n00:15:15.852 --> 00:15:19.170\nAnd if the documentation on\nSystem Center in particular,\n\n313\n00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.030\nbut especially in Ops Manager,\nthe ones we're showing you,\n\n314\n00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.150\nand all the additional documentation\nout there, is really top notch.\n\n315\n00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.210\nThey've done a great job not\nonly in updating the product and\n\n316\n00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.720\nupdating the product flow, updating the\ninformation, updating the capabilities,\n\n317\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.140\nbut really documenting every possible\nscenario and thought process, and\n\n318\n00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.450\nevery question that the average IT\nprofessional would need to have answered.\n\n319\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.892\nHey, how does this talk to this?\n\n320\n00:15:42.892 --> 00:15:47.023\nWhat's that process, what's that\nfirewall port, what's that requirement?\n\n321\n00:15:47.023 --> 00:15:50.835\nIf I'm going from here to there,\nwhat do i need to know to be successful?\n\n322\n00:15:50.835 --> 00:15:53.300\nYou'll find that\ninformation on these pages.\n\n323\n00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.110\n&gt;&gt; How do I do this in AWS?\n\n324\n00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.687\nWait.\n\n325\n00:15:55.687 --> 00:15:57.492\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n326\n00:15:57.492 --> 00:15:59.015\n&gt;&gt; I'm not supposed to talk about\n\n327\n00:15:59.015 --> 00:15:59.940\nthat, right?\n\n328\n00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.260\nBut other than that,\neverything else is there.\n\n329\n00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.250\nThere actually is some\nreally good documentation on\n\n330\n00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.880\nalternate platform hosting.\n\n331\n00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.840\nI've shown you some things on how\nto monitor and manage Unix and\n\n332\n00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.790\nLinux systems, how to deal with Java.\n\n333\n00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.410\nThere is stuff on hosting through AWS,\n\n334\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.396\nif you wanna host with Microsoft,\nyou know VMs there.\n\n335\n00:16:17.396 --> 00:16:19.410\nIt's essentially the same process.\n\n336\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.160\nThis is on Azure, there's no difference.\n\n337\n00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.480\nWe joke about it, but\n\n338\n00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.750\na VM is a VM regardless of\nthe underlying architecture it runs on.\n\n339\n00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.620\nThe only issues there are hey,\nhow do I set up the networking?\n\n340\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.510\nHow do I back up and\nget my encryption keys and certificates?\n\n341\n00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.760\nThat's unique to a certain\nvendor's platform.\n\n342\n00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.690\nBut generically running a Microsoft VM\non the underlying fabric,\n\n343\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.440\nis like running it in your data center.\n\n344\n00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.150\nThere's no difference, so.\n\n345\n00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:47.080\nHosting on AWS is identical, other than\nperhaps vagaries and variables on pricing.\n\n346\n00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.150\nI don't know who's cheaper on\nany given day based on usage,\n\n347\n00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.760\nbut they usually run neck and neck.\n\n348\n00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.280\nThey're about the same.\n\n349\n00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.540\nSo there's really no difference there.\n\n350\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.290\nWe joke around a lot about it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.190\n&gt;&gt; But it's basically, it's a no brainer.\n\n352\n00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.343\nIf you can do it on one, you could\ndo it there, and do it in VM Cloud,\n\n353\n00:17:01.343 --> 00:17:03.700\nVMware Air Cloud, Cloud Air,\n\n354\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.090\nwhatever the hell they call it now,\ntheir hosting solution.\n\n355\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:10.571\nYou can do it pretty much anywhere because\nyou're running the operating system you\n\n356\n00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:11.527\nwant in the platform.\n\n357\n00:17:11.527 --> 00:17:15.020\nAnd you're just running it\non top of either a PaaS or\n\n358\n00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.730\nan IaaS provided infrastructure.\n\n359\n00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:18.670\nAnd that's all you care about.\n\n360\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.190\nYou don't care about what's underneath.\n\n361\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.020\nIt's obstructed away.\n\n362\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.650\nThat's the whole concept of software\ndefinition cloud surfaces today anyway.\n\n363\n00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.550\nSo we have all this information,\nit's gonna be very valuable for us.\n\n364\n00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.160\nIn addition what I wanted to show you.\n\n365\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.120\nWe can go back here.\n\n366\n00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.760\nWe have the individual link some\nare going to good through all of them.\n\n367\n00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.970\nI'm just going to show you that\nthere clicking of that main page\n\n368\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.760\nlooking at the individual\nsystem requirements for 12.\n\n369\n00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.918\nWhat's the pre-upgrade tasks that you\nwould go through making sure if we're\n\n370\n00:17:43.918 --> 00:17:45.060\ngoing to do this.\n\n371\n00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.120\nThat we understand it again.\n\n372\n00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.210\nRemember, upgrade is I'm gonna\nstick with that version,\n\n373\n00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.260\nadd new versions in place as we go.\n\n374\n00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.260\nRight, then we should call it an in-place\nupgrade, cuz that's what it is.\n\n375\n00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.690\nVersus I'm gonna migrate, or\nI'm gonna multi-home those agents, and\n\n376\n00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.680\nconnect them in to different\nmanagement groups.\n\n377\n00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.390\nSo we talked about the different\nthings you would do here.\n\n378\n00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.680\nAgain, they've got these links.\n\n379\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.700\nHey, I want to upgrade hardware and\nsoftware.\n\n380\n00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.927\nHey, I want to back up\nthe RMS encryption key.\n\n381\n00:18:10.927 --> 00:18:13.307\nAnd then I could we go full\nscreen just to show you this.\n\n382\n00:18:13.307 --> 00:18:14.405\nEven better.\nThis is again,\n\n383\n00:18:14.405 --> 00:18:18.455\none of the reason I love the documentation\non this particular product.\n\n384\n00:18:18.455 --> 00:18:21.005\nThey've gone to the trouble\ncreating a task matrix.\n\n385\n00:18:21.005 --> 00:18:22.465\nBut look at the column on the right.\n\n386\n00:18:22.465 --> 00:18:24.245\nDown time risk and mitigation.\n\n387\n00:18:24.245 --> 00:18:26.595\nThey're telling us,\nassuming everything goes well, right.\n\n388\n00:18:26.595 --> 00:18:27.505\nA big disclaimer.\n\n389\n00:18:27.505 --> 00:18:30.105\nIf something doesn't go right\nbecause you have a variable\n\n390\n00:18:30.105 --> 00:18:32.175\nin your environment you're\nnot accounting for.\n\n391\n00:18:32.175 --> 00:18:35.640\nYou don't remember if there's\nsomething's not standardized.\n\n392\n00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.420\nThen clearly this is a middle of\nthe road median assessment, right.\n\n393\n00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.910\nBut, they've gone to the trouble\nof saying hey, you know what,\n\n394\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.560\nthere's no down time associated\nbacking up the RMS encryption key.\n\n395\n00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.605\nLow risk,\nno interference to current operations.\n\n396\n00:18:48.605 --> 00:18:49.685\nThat's really good, right?\n\n397\n00:18:49.685 --> 00:18:54.125\nBecause again, what's the risk factor\nhere, what's the guesswork for\n\n398\n00:18:54.125 --> 00:18:57.775\nan IT professional that's\nprobably never done this before?\n\n399\n00:18:57.775 --> 00:19:01.665\nBecause how many times do you upgrade\nfrom one major platform to another?\n\n400\n00:19:01.665 --> 00:19:06.125\nOnce, maybe twice in your management\ncycle on that product, if you're lucky.\n\n401\n00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:08.320\nMaybe you don't do it at all.\n\n402\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.230\nRight, so unless you're a consultant\ndoing this in the field for\n\n403\n00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:16.720\ncustomers or you're setting up test\nenvironments or something like that.\n\n404\n00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.670\nYou probably just don't really\never do this stuff and so\n\n405\n00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.540\nyou probably have a lot of questions,\nright?\n\n406\n00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.850\nHow do I know when I click that button\nsomething bad's not gonna happen?\n\n407\n00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.350\nHow do I know my system's\nnot gonna require a reboot?\n\n408\n00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.550\nI mean, those are the burning\nquestions a lot of us have.\n\n409\n00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.140\nAnd those are the concerns\nthat a lot of us\n\n410\n00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.770\nthink about when we go\nthrough this process.\n\n411\n00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.270\nBut we don't really always\nget good answers to.\n\n412\n00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.088\nOr you gotta talk to\nsomebody who's done it.\n\n413\n00:19:39.088 --> 00:19:43.564\nBut they're not always likely to\nshare that information with you for\n\n414\n00:19:43.564 --> 00:19:45.040\na variety of reasons.\n\n415\n00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.370\nMaybe they wanna keep that information for\nthemselves.\n\n416\n00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.060\nThey're not interested in\nhelping you to be successful.\n\n417\n00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.770\nHopefully that's not the case by the way\ncuz that's not how you should be,\n\n418\n00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.850\nyou should be willing to\nshare that information.\n\n419\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.390\nBut if you're a consultant and\nyou're being asked by a bunch of people,\n\n420\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.630\nhey is this going to work?\n\n421\n00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.890\nYou're charging for your time.\n\n422\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.260\nI'll be happy to tell you\na consultant will say.\n\n423\n00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.258\nBut you gotta pay me, right?\n\n424\n00:20:04.258 --> 00:20:05.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And if you don't wanna pay,\n\n425\n00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.550\nyou may not be able to find out.\n\n426\n00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.545\nYou may go out online, Google it,\nlook up in the forums, things like that.\n\n427\n00:20:10.545 --> 00:20:15.785\nBut you see a lot of competitive, backing\nand forthing, question and answer streams.\n\n428\n00:20:15.785 --> 00:20:17.780\nAnd you don't always know\nwhich one's accurate, right?\n\n429\n00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.150\nSomebody says hey I have this question,\nyou get five different answers.\n\n430\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.820\nAll of them kinda go like this.\n\n431\n00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.100\nAnd nobody's really clear\non which one it is.\n\n432\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.060\nAnd you don't know which one to believe,\nunless you try it five different ways.\n\n433\n00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.710\nHow do you know which one's the right one?\n\n434\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.050\nThese are the real world challenges\nassociated with this kind of\n\n435\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.070\na conversation.\n\n436\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.180\nSo getting this kind of material,\n\n437\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.000\nmaking sure that you have that\nassessment from the vendor.\n\n438\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000\nFrom the group that should be\nable to tell you authoritatively\n\n439\n00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.590\ncuz they wrote the software.\n\n440\n00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.630\nThey coming out and telling you hey,\nif you do it this way and\n\n441\n00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.150\neverything goes well.\n\n442\n00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:55.550\nObviously a big disclaimer, your things\ncan go sideways plan for that eventuality.\n\n443\n00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.990\nBut assuming nothing goes wrong,\n\n444\n00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.280\nyou should have no interruption of\nservice, no down time, no issue.\n\n445\n00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.300\nThat's a big relief, at least in my book.\n\n446\n00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.180\nWhen I talk to customers about this,\n\n447\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.070\nI will typically sit them down and\nwalk them through this particular site.\n\n448\n00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.500\nAnd I'll say, look,\nhere's what our plan is.\n\n449\n00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.660\nHere's what we have to do if we're\ngonna do this upgrade this way for you.\n\n450\n00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.080\nAnd here's where the risk\nassessment tells us we are.\n\n451\n00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.950\nHere's the key choke points\nthat may become problematic.\n\n452\n00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.230\nHere's what we're gonna do to mitigate\nthem to make sure we don't have issues.\n\n453\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.540\nWe'll have backups of everything.\n\n454\n00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.920\nWe'll do this, this, and this.\n\n455\n00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.280\nAnd this is the path\nwe're gonna go through.\n\n456\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.320\nBecause it helps them\nto feel more confident\n\n457\n00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.120\nin what the outcomes are by seeing\nit first hand from the vendor.\n\n458\n00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.660\nAt least I found over time that it\nmakes them feel more comfortable.\n\n459\n00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.320\nHopefully when you're doing this and\n\n460\n00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.440\nyou're the one having to put your finger\non the button and pull the trigger.\n\n461\n00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.260\nIt's making you feel more comfortable.\n\n462\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.430\nBecause you're the one who ultimately\nhas to be accountable to your boss, and\n\n463\n00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.310\nyour organization.\n\n464\n00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:52.190\nOr as a consultant you're the one who's\ngonna have to be accountable to your\n\n465\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.520\ncustomers and\nyou gotta know those answers.\n\n466\n00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.380\nYou gotta be comfortable saying yeah when\nI do this, this is what's going to happen.\n\n467\n00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.110\nAs long as we do it this way,\nwe should be good.\n\n468\n00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.190\nNow to that end, let me show you a couple\nother things that will be helpful for you.\n\n469\n00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.636\nAnd we are gonna give you a copy of this\nspreadsheet that I have mentioned in prior\n\n470\n00:22:07.636 --> 00:22:08.156\nepisodes.\n\n471\n00:22:08.156 --> 00:22:10.240\nI'm gonna demo it here for\nyou here in a minute.\n\n472\n00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.229\nWhich is the upgrade planning spreadsheet.\n\n473\n00:22:12.229 --> 00:22:15.910\nSo you know how to do scaling, and\nknow how to plan for implementations.\n\n474\n00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.770\nIt's a really valuable resource.\n\n475\n00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.800\nA lot of the links on\nthe Microsoft website.\n\n476\n00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.740\nThe only, only issue.\n\n477\n00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.810\nThe real, small little, stupid issue.\n\n478\n00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:23.980\nBut I’ve got to call it out.\n\n479\n00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.360\nAnd just make sure you’re aware of it.\n\n480\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.110\nThat I have with the whole site,\nall the documentation.\n\n481\n00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.590\nIs, that a lot of the links\nin the documentation.\n\n482\n00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.090\nWhere it says, and\nclick here for the spranning.\n\n483\n00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:33.970\nThe spranning.\n\n484\n00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:34.833\n&gt;&gt; The spranning.\n[LAUGH]\n\n485\n00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:36.480\n&gt;&gt; For the spranning upgrade sheet.\n\n486\n00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.620\nFor the planning upgrade sheet for,\nits called the sizing helper.\n\n487\n00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.750\nWhen you look through that, those links\ngo off at a space, it's just not there.\n\n488\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.470\nMicrosoft either has moved it around or\ndone something with it.\n\n489\n00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.655\nI think it's probably partially because\nof the flocks between the 12 R2 and\n\n490\n00:22:51.655 --> 00:22:53.245\nnow the 16 version.\n\n491\n00:22:53.245 --> 00:22:55.585\nAnd the fact that we do\nhave System Center 16 out.\n\n492\n00:22:55.585 --> 00:23:00.335\nAnd a lot of that new information is now\ndirectly going there to that website.\n\n493\n00:23:00.335 --> 00:23:02.682\nIt's all the information\nabout the16 platform.\n\n494\n00:23:02.682 --> 00:23:07.302\nAnd also the OMS, the operation\nmanager suite which is the online\n\n495\n00:23:07.302 --> 00:23:09.722\nAzure arrive solution you\ncan get through Azure now.\n\n496\n00:23:09.722 --> 00:23:13.462\nWe'll take a look at that, talk a little\nmore about that in some upcoming episodes.\n\n497\n00:23:13.462 --> 00:23:16.200\nKind of cool stuff cuz you can do\na lot of this online now which is\n\n498\n00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.160\nalso pretty interesting.\n\n499\n00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.011\nAnd we talked about that\nactually in the prior ups.\n\n500\n00:23:19.011 --> 00:23:20.530\nAnd you asked about that at some point.\n\n501\n00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.070\nAnd we talked a bit about using Azure.\n\n502\n00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.660\nWhich could do with the Azure Pack,\nand managing it and hosting it, and\n\n503\n00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.670\nall that there.\n\n504\n00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.760\nBut so the spreadsheet's become\na little bit difficult to find.\n\n505\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.425\nAnd as I've gone out and\nhave to either direct client to it.\n\n506\n00:23:33.425 --> 00:23:36.280\nOr told them hey, I'll just get your copy.\n\n507\n00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.016\nI always have a copy so I've it with me.\n\n508\n00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:40.068\nSo I don't throw [INAUDIBLE] but\nfinding it on the web but\n\n509\n00:23:40.068 --> 00:23:41.906\nI found that it's just\na little bit hard to find.\n\n510\n00:23:41.906 --> 00:23:44.222\nSo we're gonna actually make sure\nwe have a copy in the show notes.\n\n511\n00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:45.514\nI'm gonna show you where to get it.\n\n512\n00:23:45.514 --> 00:23:48.779\nBut the only issue I have with all of\nthe documentation is just that one\n\n513\n00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:49.890\nlittle thing.\n\n514\n00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.996\nJust that they would fix that link,\nit would be like a slam dunk,\n\n515\n00:23:51.996 --> 00:23:52.710\nit'd be perfect.\n\n516\n00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.252\nBut you can't, obviously,\nmake everything perfect, right?\n\n517\n00:23:55.252 --> 00:23:58.289\nSo we do have this,\nwe also have the upgrade path checklist,\n\n518\n00:23:58.289 --> 00:23:59.450\nit's just another one.\n\n519\n00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.030\nI did show you this already,\none of the links you can click on.\n\n520\n00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.520\nBut I just wanted to call out\non this screen in particular, or\n\n521\n00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.410\nthis webpage in particular.\n\n522\n00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.390\nYou could see here that they have\nthe little condition, or scenario.\n\n523\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:14.480\nSo if you're gonna upgrade,\nfor instance, your Ops Manager\n\n524\n00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.370\n2007 R2 single server group are already\nmeeting minimum requirements, right?\n\n525\n00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.620\nA simple upgrade,\nwe would call it, you go there.\n\n526\n00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.700\nIf you're gonna do a single\nserver upgrade complex,\n\n527\n00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.535\nwith distributed infrastructure,\nyou go to the next one.\n\n528\n00:24:26.535 --> 00:24:30.090\nIf you're gonna do a distributed upgrade,\nor you're gonna do a distributed upgrade\n\n529\n00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.400\nsimple or complex,\nyou click through the appropriate link.\n\n530\n00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:37.250\nSo again, we’ve done a good job at\ndescribing for you what that looks like.\n\n531\n00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:41.880\nAnd as a result, which scenario will\nmost likely make you successful, so\n\n532\n00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.495\nyou’re not missing out on things.\n\n533\n00:24:43.495 --> 00:24:47.970\nLike, I have to multi-home the agent,\nI have to do this, I have to do that.\n\n534\n00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.240\nYou just follow the appropriate scenario.\n\n535\n00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.640\nSo if we had, let's say,\ndown at the bottom here,\n\n536\n00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.500\nOps Manager 2007 R2\ndistributed management group.\n\n537\n00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.700\nOne or more servers not meeting\nthe minimum supporting requirements.\n\n538\n00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.620\nHow do we deal with that?\n\n539\n00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.860\nMaybe we need some new hardware, right?\n\n540\n00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.300\nSo we would click on this link, and\n\n541\n00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:11.860\nwe would just follow what is considered\nthe complex distributed upgrade checklist.\n\n542\n00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.310\nAnd we get our checklist her,e\ntells us what we need to do,\n\n543\n00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.230\nkind of in the order\nthat we need to do it.\n\n544\n00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.780\nAgain, walks through each step,\nyou click along the way.\n\n545\n00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.630\nHow do we deal with replacing gateways,\n\n546\n00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:26.690\nhow do we deal with replacing hardware\nin the secondary management servers?\n\n547\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.330\nHow do we do that upgrade for\nthe secondary management servers?\n\n548\n00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.620\nHow do we deal with\nmanagement group upgrade and\n\n549\n00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.680\ncreating a management\ngroup out of the RMS?\n\n550\n00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.097\nRemember, the RMS,\nthe root management server, the old role,\n\n551\n00:25:38.097 --> 00:25:42.610\nnow in 2012 R2 we call that a management\ngroup, so we have to deal with that.\n\n552\n00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.620\nSo how do we just step through each one,\nwhich is nice,\n\n553\n00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.290\nhow do we deal with the importing of\nthe upgrade helper management pack?\n\n554\n00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.040\nWe actually have a management pack that\nhelps you walk through the upgrade.\n\n555\n00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.180\nYou can download that,\nimport that, run that,\n\n556\n00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:59.132\nand it'll actually give you all the steps\nyou can click through and actually follow.\n\n557\n00:25:59.132 --> 00:26:02.765\nIt's a really cool little idea that\nthey put together, so it's neat.\n\n558\n00:26:02.765 --> 00:26:05.241\nIf you're not aware of that,\nif you're not using that, definitely,\n\n559\n00:26:05.241 --> 00:26:06.160\nyou should be doing that.\n\n560\n00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.120\nWhen you click here on the reference for\n\n561\n00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.270\nit, it takes us out, tells us about\nthe upgrade helper management pack.\n\n562\n00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:14.953\nGives us a little bit of information,\n\n563\n00:26:14.953 --> 00:26:17.820\ntells you it takes about 15\nminutes to run Discovery.\n\n564\n00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.790\nFinds all the information on\nall the servers, the roles and\n\n565\n00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.530\neverything, tells you what will and will\nnot meet the requirements for upgrade.\n\n566\n00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.540\nGives you the path, and\ntells you what to do and how to do it.\n\n567\n00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.030\nIt's a great little way\nto drive through that,\n\n568\n00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.390\nwe give you all the information\nabout how to use it here.\n\n569\n00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.490\nSo it would be something for\nyou to think about.\n\n570\n00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:37.320\nWe assess the status of the agents\nin your management group,\n\n571\n00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.020\nand tell you which ones have to be\nupgraded, how to get that done.\n\n572\n00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.290\nEverything you would think of that may\nbe difficult is right there as part of\n\n573\n00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:44.796\nmanagement pack.\n\n574\n00:26:44.796 --> 00:26:48.620\nAnd it's great, when you think about the\nimpressiveness of the product, that we can\n\n575\n00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.670\nwrite a management pack, and then use that\nto drive upgrade to the product itself.\n\n576\n00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.443\nUse the product to upgrade itself,\nin other words.\n\n577\n00:26:54.443 --> 00:26:57.696\nI think that's kinda neat,\nI was gonna say nifty, but\n\n578\n00:26:57.696 --> 00:26:59.837\nthat's not a formal IT-pro term.\n\n579\n00:26:59.837 --> 00:27:03.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the spreadsheet,\n\n580\n00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.708\nthe mythical,\nmagical spreadsheet I keep talking about.\n\n581\n00:27:05.708 --> 00:27:08.290\nSo you could see here,\nSystem Center 12, and\n\n582\n00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.650\ndon't let the System Center\n12 moniker fool you.\n\n583\n00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:15.710\nThis will work for 12, 12 SP1,\n12 R2, you can use it for\n\n584\n00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.590\nany of those scenarios, it's got\nthe scaling and the capability to do it.\n\n585\n00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.690\nEven though it was published,\nyou could see, back in the January of 12,\n\n586\n00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.540\nit is still valuable.\n\n587\n00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.200\nSo you'll be able to use this,\nit's called the Sizing Helper,\n\n588\n00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.710\nthe SCOM Sizing Helper, and\nit's a nice little spreadsheet.\n\n589\n00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:35.070\nIt's got all the little click-through\nbuttons, so it tells you how to do this.\n\n590\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.350\nWe have all the tabs on the bottom\nthat these are referencing.\n\n591\n00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:42.697\nLet me just jump up here, to about 120%,\nmake it a little bit easier for\n\n592\n00:27:42.697 --> 00:27:43.389\nyou to see.\n\n593\n00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:47.544\nAnd you’ll see we have a Standard\nDeployment here, Windows computers,\n\n594\n00:27:47.544 --> 00:27:51.540\nnetwork devices, APM,\napplication performance monitoring.\n\n595\n00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.680\nHow do we deal with advanced deployments,\nlike gateway servers, UNIX or Linux.\n\n596\n00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.551\nWhat’s called URL monitoring here, it's\nnow called Global Service Monitoring for\n\n597\n00:27:59.551 --> 00:28:00.670\nyou to refer to it.\n\n598\n00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:08.490\nGSM with synthetic transactions, that's\nwhere we monitor from outside of the LAN.\n\n599\n00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:12.370\nLooking at the customer's view of our web\nservice and our distributed web app, and\n\n600\n00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:13.900\nlook at it from the outside in.\n\n601\n00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.550\nSo we look at it from monitoring points\nscattered outside the environment.\n\n602\n00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.240\nThat's whats called the GSM Capability\nnow, so we have that.\n\n603\n00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.890\nWe have the Advanced Database Sizing,\nhow do we size the databases, and\n\n604\n00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.370\nhow do we size the data\nwarehouse database?\n\n605\n00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:29.990\nAny and\nall of these are gonna be available to us.\n\n606\n00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:34.950\nSo for instance, if we go in here and\ndo a Tab right here,\n\n607\n00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:36.240\nand all these tabs are on the bottom.\n\n608\n00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.480\nThey have different scenarios,\nand what you'll see is,\n\n609\n00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.960\nlet me just go back to 120%,\nyou could see that a little bit easier.\n\n610\n00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.090\n500 Windows computers,\n100 network devices,\n\n611\n00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:49.310\nwhat the minimum requirements\nwill be in order to drive that.\n\n612\n00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:55.640\nWhat the resource pool will look like for\nthat, what the roles are needed\n\n613\n00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.600\nthat will drive that, and\nthen choosing the right hardware.\n\n614\n00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.550\nWe've got some hard-coded numbers here,\n\n615\n00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.170\nbased on the pre-made\nscenario that we've chosen.\n\n616\n00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.245\nAnd we could see it spits\nout information for\n\n617\n00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:10.915\nus on the data warehouse size and\nthe database size.\n\n618\n00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:15.893\nAnd as we move through,\nAnd as we choose each of\n\n619\n00:29:15.893 --> 00:29:19.597\nthese different scenarios,\njust by clicking through the various tabs.\n\n620\n00:29:19.597 --> 00:29:23.386\nYou'll see, 500 Windows computers,\n500 APM-enabled Windows computers,\n\n621\n00:29:23.386 --> 00:29:24.551\n100 network devices.\n\n622\n00:29:24.551 --> 00:29:26.351\nWhatever the mix and match will be,\n\n623\n00:29:26.351 --> 00:29:30.320\nyou'll see here that we have all of\nthe different requirements laid out.\n\n624\n00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.810\nAnd it gives us all the pre-made\ninformation we need to do the sizing, so\n\n625\n00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.570\nthis is nice,\nbecause it allows us to calculate, right?\n\n626\n00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.370\nAll the different things that we may need.\n\n627\n00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:46.885\nAnd if we go just out to the end here,\nwe'll see we can scale up to 150,000\n\n628\n00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:53.010\nWindows computers, 700 APM-enabled\ncomputers, 2,000 network devices.\n\n629\n00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.914\nThat is a a substantial network,\nit's not massive,\n\n630\n00:29:55.914 --> 00:29:58.571\nby comparison to certain\nenterprise networks.\n\n631\n00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:03.023\nBut for an average IT professional,\nto have that many resources under\n\n632\n00:30:03.023 --> 00:30:06.330\nmanagement is a significant network,\nright?\n\n633\n00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.342\nSo we scale this spreadsheet out really,\nreally far.\n\n634\n00:30:09.342 --> 00:30:12.830\nYou could see there's a lot of\ninformation in here, right?\n\n635\n00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.140\nWe've got two resource pools for\n\n636\n00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.510\nmonitoring the different devices here,\nthree management server resource pools.\n\n637\n00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:22.566\nSo you've got different information that's\nset up here, it specs them out for you.\n\n638\n00:30:22.566 --> 00:30:26.285\nTells you how big the databases\nneed to be, got the web console and\n\n639\n00:30:26.285 --> 00:30:30.010\nthe reporting server capabilities set up,\nscales all that out.\n\n640\n00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.450\nAnd then, when we're done,\nwe can look at requirements for\n\n641\n00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:37.860\nthe gateway server, look at requirements\nfor UNIX and Linux monitoring.\n\n642\n00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.538\nMake that a little bigger, so\nyou could see that there, right?\n\n643\n00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:44.417\nSo in case you need that,\nwe've got some notes on max agent size for\n\n644\n00:30:44.417 --> 00:30:45.472\nURL monitoring.\n\n645\n00:30:45.472 --> 00:30:50.108\nWhich is now referred to as the Gateway\nMonitorings, the external monitoring,\n\n646\n00:30:50.108 --> 00:30:53.110\nthe Gateway Monitoring,\nwe can look at this.\n\n647\n00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:57.310\nWe've got overall database size\ncalculations, so we can go through.\n\n648\n00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:02.260\nAnd based on these estimates, we can take\na look at IOP load, things like that.\n\n649\n00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.510\nData warehouse size, the same thing, and\n\n650\n00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.576\nthen the database, this calculated for\nthe data warehouse.\n\n651\n00:31:08.576 --> 00:31:10.480\nHow many RAID arrays or\n\n652\n00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.250\ndrives in the array do we need to\ncalculate out based on scaling?\n\n653\n00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.420\nThey've done a really good\njob with the spreadsheet,\n\n654\n00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.480\ngiving us all this information.\n\n655\n00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.360\nAllowing us to manipulate the figures\nif needed, so we can modify them.\n\n656\n00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.550\nAnd then when we're done,\nwe just click Back to scenarios.\n\n657\n00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.360\nAnd it'll take us either\nback to the scenario,\n\n658\n00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.850\nor, cuz I've been clicking\nall over the place, right?\n\n659\n00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:33.090\nWe could just go back here to the front\nand we just jump in at any point,\n\n660\n00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:34.080\nif we want to.\n\n661\n00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.067\nWe've also got supported\nconfiguration information, so\n\n662\n00:31:37.067 --> 00:31:39.763\nit tells us what the maximums are,\nthings like that.\n\n663\n00:31:39.763 --> 00:31:43.955\nAnd it's got some best practices here,\nthat tells us how to use the spreadsheet,\n\n664\n00:31:43.955 --> 00:31:47.907\nhow to deal with the Individual components\nand parts about scalability, and\n\n665\n00:31:47.907 --> 00:31:51.770\ngives us some links to the web that\ngives us additional information.\n\n666\n00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:53.340\nSo this is a valuable resource.\n\n667\n00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.570\nOne that, if you have not yet\n\n668\n00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:57.480\nused or are not aware of, you definitely\nwanna go out and take a look at.\n\n669\n00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.900\nIt's gonna prove to be helpful for\n\n670\n00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.998\nyou when you're thinking\nabout doing your scalability.\n\n671\n00:32:00.998 --> 00:32:03.734\nSo that's gonna hopefully\nprove to be valuable for\n\n672\n00:32:03.734 --> 00:32:06.596\nyou and give you some information\nthat will make you or\n\n673\n00:32:06.596 --> 00:32:10.813\nallow you to make better choices about\nhow your gonna recommend scalability.\n\n674\n00:32:10.813 --> 00:32:13.123\nWe did talk quickly just\nas we are finishing up.\n\n675\n00:32:13.123 --> 00:32:18.090\nDaniel kind of front loaded us on that\nwhole migration and coexistence thing.\n\n676\n00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.070\nAnd I talked multi homing a little bit.\n\n677\n00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.930\nI just wanted to circle back to that idea.\n\n678\n00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.160\nStress again reminds you and\n\n679\n00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.950\nwe talk about it in the spread sheet,\ntalk about it in the documentation.\n\n680\n00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:31.470\nI mentioned it response to\nwhat Daniel asked about.\n\n681\n00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:36.330\nGotta upgrade those agents from SCOM\n2007 R2 CU4 right, so in other words,\n\n682\n00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.840\nthe old style agents.\n\n683\n00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.380\nGotta have them upgraded to the Microsoft\nmonitoring agent, very important for\n\n684\n00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.013\nus to do that.\n\n685\n00:32:42.013 --> 00:32:45.325\nOnce we do that we then are able\nto send monitor data back to\n\n686\n00:32:45.325 --> 00:32:48.090\ndifferent management\ngroups at the same time.\n\n687\n00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.250\nSo we're multi-home, but\n\n688\n00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.680\nwe can now talk to multiple\nmanagement groups simultaneously.\n\n689\n00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.623\nOtherwise, remember old agent\nonly talks to old servers.\n\n690\n00:32:55.623 --> 00:32:59.860\nNew agent talks to new, but\nis also backwards compatible for old.\n\n691\n00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.870\nSo we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n692\n00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:05.940\nManagement groups, or rather management\npacks, deployed into the management\n\n693\n00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.540\ngroups, will function as before,\neven though they are completely separate.\n\n694\n00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.635\nWe will be able to use them to\nmanage that infrastructure.\n\n695\n00:33:11.635 --> 00:33:13.725\nBy management group, no problem there.\n\n696\n00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:18.188\nSo we send that data back through those\nagents to the properly manage and packs.\n\n697\n00:33:18.188 --> 00:33:20.738\nSo reporting your data\nmanagement all that stuff,\n\n698\n00:33:20.738 --> 00:33:22.763\nnot gonna get screwed up in the process.\n\n699\n00:33:22.763 --> 00:33:27.647\nOnce we migrate and we ultimately choose\nto start moving over we can export\n\n700\n00:33:27.647 --> 00:33:30.577\nthose matters from packs out 2007 R2.\n\n701\n00:33:30.577 --> 00:33:34.708\nSo we're not gonna lose them,\nwe'll show you how to do the Management\n\n702\n00:33:34.708 --> 00:33:39.060\npack export in an upcoming episode,\nnot out of R2, but just in 12 R2.\n\n703\n00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.590\nWe'll show you how to simply export it,\nit's the same, you just right-click and\n\n704\n00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.150\nExport, it's no big deal.\n\n705\n00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:48.950\nWe can do that, bring them into the 12\nR2 environment in an isolated test bed,\n\n706\n00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:49.980\nif we choose to.\n\n707\n00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.605\nOr bring them in and start to test\nthem and make sure they're there.\n\n708\n00:33:52.605 --> 00:33:57.179\nMulti home agents will send data back to\nboth management groups during that cut\n\n709\n00:33:57.179 --> 00:33:58.643\nover or cross over time.\n\n710\n00:33:58.643 --> 00:34:03.202\nAnd then as we sundown as we get\nrid of that 2007 R2 infrastructure,\n\n711\n00:34:03.202 --> 00:34:07.987\nthe agents are simply just now gonna\nreport into the new management groups in\n\n712\n00:34:07.987 --> 00:34:10.120\nthe 12R2 resource pool.\n\n713\n00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.860\nAnd they're no longer gonna be\ntalking to the old infrastructure.\n\n714\n00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.410\nBut rest assured, we could take those\nmanagement packs out of 2007 R2,\n\n715\n00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:19.000\nwe don't lose them, and\nwe can bring them in.\n\n716\n00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.110\nAnd as long as we have an export path\nthat's clear, there's no errors or issues\n\n717\n00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.880\nwith the management packs, should be able\nto bring those over and use them there.\n\n718\n00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.916\nSo that part's also gonna be hopefully\nvaluable, put some ease in your thought\n\n719\n00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:34.025\nprocess here, in terms of just not having\nto recreate all that infrastructure.\n\n720\n00:34:34.025 --> 00:34:37.596\nCuz if you spend a lot of time customizing\nand loading up those management packs,\n\n721\n00:34:37.596 --> 00:34:39.550\nyou wanna make sure you\nhave access to them.\n\n722\n00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.210\nYou don't wanna have to recreate\nthe wheel if you don't have to.\n\n723\n00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.090\nSo that's gonna be important.\n\n724\n00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.920\n&gt;&gt; That's right, who wants to go back over\nall that work you've already done just\n\n725\n00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.740\nto do it again?\n\n726\n00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.590\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Adam just loves redoing work.\n\n727\n00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:48.370\n&gt;&gt; All right, that's me.\n\n728\n00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:52.890\n&gt;&gt; Adam, thanks so much for giving us the\nresources necessary that we're going to\n\n729\n00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:56.900\nneed to\n&gt;&gt; Walk through an update or migration and\n\n730\n00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.950\nreminding us of the important distinction\nbetween the two of update and migration.\n\n731\n00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:05.920\nAnd doing one is different than the other\nand specifically for Microsoft's sake.\n\n732\n00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.880\nSo that being said, it looks like\nwe've come to the end of our episode,\n\n733\n00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.180\nwe do thank you good folks for watching.\n\n734\n00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.790\nWe thank Adam for joining us as well.\n\n735\n00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:16.520\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n736\n00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.219\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n737\n00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:17.985\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n738\n00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:25.742\n[MUSIC]\n\n739\n00:35:25.742 --> 00:35:28.656\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:15.980\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.600\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are back with more on our data\n\n8\n00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.480\ncenter monitoring with\nMicrosoft SCOM series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.780\nAnd joining us back in the studio for,\nthat's SCOM suite.\n\n10\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.790\nSCOM is just a fun word to say.\n\n11\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; SCOM, SCOM, SCOM, SCOM.\n\n12\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.400\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you heard him.\n\n13\n00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.900\nHe is the man,\nthe myth of legend that is Adam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.470\nAdam, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n15\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.530\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, it's going well.\n\n16\n00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.147\nHopefully it's going well for\n\n17\n00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:41.077\nyou out there as long as\nyou're having SCOMerific day.\n\n18\n00:00:41.077 --> 00:00:42.473\nThat's a bad-\n&gt;&gt; We're just gonna create new\n\n19\n00:00:42.473 --> 00:00:43.268\nadjectives and verbs.\n\n20\n00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:47.962\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's yeah\n&gt;&gt; SCOM, [CROSSTALK].\n\n21\n00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:51.513\nAll right, so we're gonna talk some more,\nI'm gonna do this without saying SCOM,\n\n22\n00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:54.264\nwe're gonna talk some more about\nthe product that I can't name,\n\n23\n00:00:54.264 --> 00:00:55.937\nit's almost like Voldemort, right?\n\n24\n00:00:55.937 --> 00:00:56.752\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Voldemort,\n\n25\n00:00:56.752 --> 00:00:58.147\nyou're not allowed to say his name,\n\n26\n00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:00.930\nor Beetlejuice, you say his name\nthree times and he shows up.\n\n27\n00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.690\nThere are people like that, by the way.\n\n28\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.818\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You probably know people like\n\n29\n00:01:03.818 --> 00:01:04.345\nthat, right.\n\n30\n00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:06.180\nYou say their name and all of the sudden\njust out of the blue they just walk in.\n\n31\n00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.919\n&gt;&gt; They appear.\n\n32\n00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:09.814\n&gt;&gt; If we say Mike's name three times\nquickly he may actually just pop in and\n\n33\n00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:10.789\nsit down in that chair.\n\n34\n00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:12.995\n&gt;&gt; That's right, in a puff of blue smoke.\n\n35\n00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:14.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Materializes out of nowhere.\n\n36\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.190\nAll right, so we're gonna take a deeper\nlook, get under the covers a little bit.\n\n37\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.050\nThe last episodes we have done\na complete and thorough overview and\n\n38\n00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.560\nreview of the architecture of SCOM.\n\n39\n00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.650\nWe've talked about and shown you\nhow to actually do an installation\n\n40\n00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.860\nof every aspect of System Center.\n\n41\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.210\nWe've been through,\ntalked about how to do the configuration,\n\n42\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.452\nhow to connect everything up,\nhow to get it all working.\n\n43\n00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:40.370\nWe wanna talk about one of\nthe most important elements, and\n\n44\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.980\nlet's not forget about\nthe episodes right before this.\n\n45\n00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.632\nWe talked about how to do\nthe update versus migration.\n\n46\n00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:49.085\nThat whole conversation Daniel helped\nme to keep straight in my head.\n\n47\n00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:52.645\nAnd we talked about updating and\nmigrating and what that looks like.\n\n48\n00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.829\nVery important part of the overall\nconversations around this product and\n\n49\n00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.864\nhow to structure them.\n\n50\n00:01:56.864 --> 00:02:01.562\nIf you're coming out of 2007 R2 we need to\nknow what that path looks like to get you\n\n51\n00:02:01.562 --> 00:02:05.936\nup into 12R2, get you working with all\nthe features, bells and whistles and\n\n52\n00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:08.306\ncapabilities we've been talking about.\n\n53\n00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:12.393\nAnd we'll continue to talk about as we\ncontinue moving on throughout the rest of\n\n54\n00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:15.937\nthe episodes that make up this body\nof knowledge, this set of shows.\n\n55\n00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:18.687\nWe've got real interesting and\ncool things yet to come.\n\n56\n00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:20.257\nApplications performance monitoring,\n\n57\n00:02:20.257 --> 00:02:22.777\nwe're gonna talk about\nend-ro-end service monitoring,\n\n58\n00:02:22.777 --> 00:02:26.670\ngonna talk about making sure we know how\nto deal with scorecards and dashboards.\n\n59\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.810\nWe got a whole thing on tuning,\noptimization, and\n\n60\n00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.280\nBCDR that'll come up at the very,\nvery end of our discussions.\n\n61\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.120\nThat is something that you're\ngonna wanna take a look at.\n\n62\n00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.310\nMake sure you know how to work with\nthe product but also something goes wrong,\n\n63\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.280\nhow do we recover it,\nput it all back together again?\n\n64\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.874\nIt's kind of like the humpty\ndumpty of that process, right?\n\n65\n00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:44.117\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.\n\n66\n00:02:44.117 --> 00:02:46.493\n&gt;&gt; Have you seen those commercials\nthat they got going on now with,\n\n67\n00:02:46.493 --> 00:02:49.353\nI think it's for one of the insurance\ncompanies where, I think it's Geico,\n\n68\n00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:52.040\nactually, where they literally have\nthe Humpty Dumpty egg character?\n\n69\n00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.638\n&gt;&gt; No, I haven't seen it.\n&gt;&gt; He's in the hospital,\n\n70\n00:02:53.638 --> 00:02:57.150\nhe's in a thousand pieces,\nthey've got three or four of them,\n\n71\n00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.310\nbut it's the modern, so he's hooked\nup in ICU, he's in the body cast, and\n\n72\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.980\nhe's got the yolk\ndribbling out on the side.\n\n73\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.570\nIt's really funny, and\nthen one of them he's got like, the 11th,\n\n74\n00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.900\n12th century, whatever it would have been,\nEnglish soldier standing off to the side.\n\n75\n00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.440\nAnd he's like yeah, it's so\nhard to get good help these days, and you\n\n76\n00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.040\nsee them all just ind of sitting there and\nthey're just looking at him like you know.\n\n77\n00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.640\nAnd they're all dressed like\ntraditional garb in the spirit of it,\n\n78\n00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.750\nit's really funny.\n\n79\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.130\nSo we're gonna not do that, but\nthat is our random aside, part one for\n\n80\n00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.100\nthis episode by the way.\n\n81\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.800\nIf you haven't seen any of our random\nasides, they are fun and entertaining.\n\n82\n00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.178\nWe do try to give you\nknowledge in multiple areas.\n\n83\n00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:39.089\nDaniel's gonna talk about\nsticks at some point as well.\n\n84\n00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure given the tenure of what we've\n\n85\n00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.195\nbeen doing earlier in the day here.\n\n86\n00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:43.935\nSo we're gonna jump in.\n\n87\n00:03:43.935 --> 00:03:45.835\nWe're gonna talk a bit\nabout management packs.\n\n88\n00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:47.395\nHow they work, what they are.\n\n89\n00:03:47.395 --> 00:03:52.007\nOne of the most important elements of\nusing SCOM is this idea of being able to\n\n90\n00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:55.747\nbring in to import, to get a hold\nof from third party vendors, and\n\n91\n00:03:55.747 --> 00:03:57.017\nor from Microsoft.\n\n92\n00:03:57.017 --> 00:04:00.247\nAnd I'm gonna show you a list\nwhere you can see what the most up\n\n93\n00:04:00.247 --> 00:04:04.182\nto date listing of the master packs\nthat are currently available are, but\n\n94\n00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:07.970\nwere gonna take a look at, and\nunderstand more about, management packs.\n\n95\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.978\nWe'll have an upcoming episode a little\nlater on where we deal with how to do\n\n96\n00:04:10.978 --> 00:04:13.344\nauthoring of management packs and\nhow to customize them.\n\n97\n00:04:13.344 --> 00:04:16.650\nBut we're gonna lay down some of that\nfoundational knowledge for you right now.\n\n98\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.150\nSo if we can go in and take a look real\nquick, what we're gonna do is we are in\n\n99\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.870\nthe SCOM management interface and\nwe are in the monitoring area right now.\n\n100\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.797\nWe see the output of the management\npacks up here as we look and\n\n101\n00:04:28.797 --> 00:04:33.150\nwe see the folders associated\nwith various management packs.\n\n102\n00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.880\nAnd we see the different views\nthat we may be wanting to use.\n\n103\n00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.230\nWe have, can we go full screen for\n\n104\n00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.460\na minute just so\nwe can see that a little bit clearer.\n\n105\n00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.930\nWe have the alerts view, we have\ndiscovery, you know, in terms of what's\n\n106\n00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.455\nbeen discovered in inventory, we'll\ntake a look at how to deal with that and\n\n107\n00:04:47.455 --> 00:04:51.122\nwhat that looks like, distributed\napplications, we've got a task status.\n\n108\n00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:54.066\nThere's all these different things\nthat are available to us here and\n\n109\n00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:57.112\nall the very, we'll be talking about\nviews in upcoming episodes, but\n\n110\n00:04:57.112 --> 00:05:00.445\nall the different views that we can\ncreate and use, you see them there.\n\n111\n00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:03.150\nRight-click New, Alert, Event, State.\n\n112\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.560\nWe've got performance diagram,\ntask status, web page dashboard.\n\n113\n00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.350\nAny one of these, all of these, are gonna\nbe brought and made available to us,\n\n114\n00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.980\nat least out of the box anyway,\nfrom management pack.\n\n115\n00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.080\nSo all this stuff comes\nin from management packs.\n\n116\n00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.480\nAnd we're able to leverage them.\n\n117\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.843\nFor instance here, if we have any active\nalerts, you can see we do have some,\n\n118\n00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:24.740\nwe'll be able to see those here.\n\n119\n00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.920\nAnd we can interact with an alert,\nfigure out what it is.\n\n120\n00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.130\nGet some information on it, see where\nit's coming from, what the alert rule is,\n\n121\n00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.270\nand why it may be important to us.\n\n122\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.010\nWe can take some action and or\nexecute tasks associated with this.\n\n123\n00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.310\nSo this is important.\n\n124\n00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.327\nIf we have any tasks that are running or\nanything that may be pending and\n\n125\n00:05:43.327 --> 00:05:46.871\nthat we're in the middle of doing, we can\ngo check on it with the task status view.\n\n126\n00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:48.967\nIf we're doing a job\nthat may take a while,\n\n127\n00:05:48.967 --> 00:05:50.900\nwe'd close out the job status window.\n\n128\n00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.820\nWe wanna go back,\ntake a look at the status.\n\n129\n00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.790\nWe could see that right up there.\n\n130\n00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.210\nIf we have any inventory that's been\ndiscovered, we'll be able to see our\n\n131\n00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.590\ninventory here so we can see our ops\nmanager server right here, right.\n\n132\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.210\nHe is there.\n\n133\n00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.470\nWe can see the status of it.\n\n134\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.440\nWe see it's in a warning state right now.\n\n135\n00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.500\nWe may be able to go in and\nmay be able to do some stuff with it.\n\n136\n00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.340\nSo we have all these different things\nthat are happening as a result of these\n\n137\n00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.390\nmanagement packs.\n\n138\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.882\nWhen we go into the administration\nwork space down here, and\n\n139\n00:06:18.882 --> 00:06:21.484\nwe scroll,\nlet's just go down a little bit,\n\n140\n00:06:21.484 --> 00:06:24.913\nwe can see management packs\nare right here over on the left.\n\n141\n00:06:24.913 --> 00:06:29.269\nWe highlight them and we can see\nwe've got 120 management packs there,\n\n142\n00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:33.560\nbased on default install is SCOM having\nimported anything out beyond just\n\n143\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.485\nthe standard ones that\nwe'll be able to bring in.\n\n144\n00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:39.100\nAnd you'll see that we've got\nquite a number of them there, but\n\n145\n00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.430\nwe can always add more, right.\n\n146\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.020\nIf 120 is good, well shucks,\n121's gonna be better, right?\n\n147\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.445\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna talk about how\n\n148\n00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:47.570\nto bring in a managment pack.\n\n149\n00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.107\nNow before we do that, let's just go out,\n\n150\n00:06:49.107 --> 00:06:50.919\nlet's take a look at what's available,\nright.\n\n151\n00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.251\nBecause you wanna know about\nwhat options you have so\n\n152\n00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:56.810\nyou can make an educated choice about\nwhat management packs you wanna bring it.\n\n153\n00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.850\nThe value of this tool,\nas we've talked about in some episodes,\n\n154\n00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.120\nready, we'll continue to talk about\nthroughout the rest of the show,\n\n155\n00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.330\nis the idea of understanding\nwhat it is SCOM can do for you.\n\n156\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.940\nWhat can I do for you today, Daniel?\n\n157\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.795\nIs the question that we'd wanna ask.\n\n158\n00:07:10.795 --> 00:07:14.960\nAnd what SCOM replies is, well, howdy,\nI can do anything you want me to do.\n\n159\n00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.030\nAll you gotta do is go get the right\nmanagement pack and bring it in, right?\n\n160\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.317\nNow the trick is, of course, you gotta\nknow what management packs are out there.\n\n161\n00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.835\nAnd you gotta link that concept\nto the management pack,\n\n162\n00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:27.202\nback to infrastructure you wanna monitor,\nright.\n\n163\n00:07:27.202 --> 00:07:31.232\nSo when we go we take a look you'll see\nthem on Microsoft TechNet website on\n\n164\n00:07:31.232 --> 00:07:34.224\nthe Microsoft Management Pack here,\nall these URLs.\n\n165\n00:07:34.224 --> 00:07:39.106\nI got about 12 websites up on the probably\nsee then tab where is all of them at\n\n166\n00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:40.280\nsome point.\n\n167\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.479\nAnd we've been doing this\nin the episode so far, and\n\n168\n00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.150\ngonna continue to do\nthis throughout the show.\n\n169\n00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.916\nTaking out and showing you all sorts\nof websites, almost exclusively all\n\n170\n00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:51.741\nMicrosoft TechNet related, that\nare gonna show you, give you access to,\n\n171\n00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:55.447\nhelp you to better understand this\nproduct through our documentation,\n\n172\n00:07:55.447 --> 00:07:59.667\nthrough our how-to's, through all of\nthe standardized information you need.\n\n173\n00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:02.549\nTo make this product work for you.\n\n174\n00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:04.723\nAnd the result of that is you\nwatch this episode now live,\n\n175\n00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:06.120\nwhile we're setting it up.\n\n176\n00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.730\nYou watch it six months,\na year from now, who knows when.\n\n177\n00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.700\nAnd you've got the URLs in the show notes.\n\n178\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.770\nYou go back, you reference them.\n\n179\n00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.500\nIf they update, you have the most\nrecent information right there.\n\n180\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.580\nAnd you'll still be able to see the most\nrecent list of management packs.\n\n181\n00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.570\nIf not, Daniel will show up at your\ndoor with a hand-engraved list, right?\n\n182\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:23.495\nCuz you used to do\nthe calligraphy [CROSSTALK]\n\n183\n00:08:23.495 --> 00:08:24.797\n&gt;&gt; I do [INAUDIBLE] calligraphy, yes.\n\n184\n00:08:24.797 --> 00:08:28.917\n&gt;&gt; He will scribe out a list for you and\nactually make it available to you for\n\n185\n00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:30.160\na small nominal fee.\n\n186\n00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.290\nHow small is, well,\na matter of negotiation, as you said.\n\n187\n00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.664\nWe do have trained salespeople\nstanding by [CROSSTALK].\n\n188\n00:08:36.664 --> 00:08:38.390\nOkay, so let's just take a look here.\n\n189\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.820\nYou can see we do have a list, and\n\n190\n00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.670\nI like this particular list\nbecause it is up to date.\n\n191\n00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.610\nRelatively speaking it's not as update\nas you're gonna find out there but\n\n192\n00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.230\nit is a good overview list\nwhile the management packs.\n\n193\n00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.020\nThere are lots of sites that will\ngive you list of management packs but\n\n194\n00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.150\nI find that not all of\nthem are up to date.\n\n195\n00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.240\nAnd so\nyou got to hunt around a little bit.\n\n196\n00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.590\nSo we've got a nice set of manage packs\nhere, we've got them by date, and\n\n197\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.550\nthey are out of order sequentially.\n\n198\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.420\nThey're done alphabetically,\nnot by date order.\n\n199\n00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.140\nSo you look there, that's 2008, then they\ngot a 2013, then they got a 2016 one,\n\n200\n00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.720\nthey kind of jump around.\n\n201\n00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.300\nBut you'll see that it is nice.\n\n202\n00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.360\nSo we scroll down here, I'm not\ngonna go through the whole list and\n\n203\n00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.280\npoint stuff out, but you can see there's\nquite a number of them as we go through.\n\n204\n00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.540\nNow these are all Microsoft-related,\n\n205\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.870\nmeaning these are all the ones\nthat are just from Microsoft.\n\n206\n00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.820\nThere's another site out there,\n\n207\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.800\nI will make sure we add\nthis URL to the show notes.\n\n208\n00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.265\nI'm not gonna put it up for you right now.\n\n209\n00:09:34.265 --> 00:09:39.015\nBut there's another site out there that\ndoes all the third party management packs\n\n210\n00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:43.115\nthat is also really good, really\nauthoritative, got a pretty good combined\n\n211\n00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:46.380\nlist to everything, and\nit's the one I tend to go to and I use.\n\n212\n00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.160\nWhen a customer says hey do you\nhave a management pack for that or\n\n213\n00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.430\ncan we find one?\n\n214\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.110\nI don't have a clue for sure cuz\nthere's hundreds of them out there.\n\n215\n00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.430\nI gotta go look it up like you would.\n\n216\n00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.620\nAnd this is the site I actually go to so\nI'm gonna add that one to the show notes.\n\n217\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.450\nI forgot to give you that one.\n\n218\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.748\nWe'll make sure you have that one as well.\n\n219\n00:10:00.748 --> 00:10:03.792\nBut you could see we got\nall sorts of stuff here and\n\n220\n00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:08.335\nthis is gonna allow us to be able to\nbring in some of the most recent stuff.\n\n221\n00:10:08.335 --> 00:10:12.054\nWe can just zoom in for a second just so\nyou can see just what I'm looking at.\n\n222\n00:10:12.054 --> 00:10:14.735\nMicrosoft Server hyper V 2016, right?\n\n223\n00:10:14.735 --> 00:10:17.794\nThat was released March 13th of 2017.\n\n224\n00:10:17.794 --> 00:10:21.984\nI mean, that's a relatively recent\nmanagement pack, one of the most recent\n\n225\n00:10:21.984 --> 00:10:25.670\nones, right out there ready to go so\nwe do have all the latest stuff.\n\n226\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:30.365\nIIS 2016 sitting right there,\ngot Server 16 sitting down here,\n\n227\n00:10:30.365 --> 00:10:32.350\nall sorts of stuff going on.\n\n228\n00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.300\nSo we got quite a number of them.\n\n229\n00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.520\nThere was recently an update for the\nOffice 365 management packs that came out.\n\n230\n00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.360\nObviously, recently is a relative thing.\n\n231\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.100\nBut recent to when we're actually\ndoing this slide for you.\n\n232\n00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.990\nSo you just want to make sure you're\nkeeping up to date on this stuff.\n\n233\n00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.690\nSo now that we know in theory where to\ngo to find those management packs and\n\n234\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.020\nget some information on them.\n\n235\n00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.890\nAnd by the way, just so\n\n236\n00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.590\nyou know when you click on this,\nI should have done this before.\n\n237\n00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:59.740\nLet's just grab one of these,\nlet's do that Server DNS, where is it?\n\n238\n00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.070\nServer, HyperV16 so\nlet's just click on this one just so\n\n239\n00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.250\nyou could see what\nhappens here real quick.\n\n240\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.370\nSo you're gonna be taken out and\n\n241\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.840\nyou're gonna go right to\nthe download site which is nice.\n\n242\n00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.560\nYou get that management\npack whatever it is.\n\n243\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.130\nYou could read the details on it just so\n\n244\n00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.080\nyou could see what's\ngoing on with it there.\n\n245\n00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.490\nShows you what's involved,\ngives you the different language files and\n\n246\n00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.580\nthe different language\nsupport that we have for it.\n\n247\n00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.600\nThere's actually a more, you can go\ndown and see all of them there cuz we do\n\n248\n00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.610\nrelease that in all the languages we\nsupport in terms of the stack overall.\n\n249\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.400\nSo you have all that and then we have some\ninformation about the management pack.\n\n250\n00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.230\nAnd just the MSI will need etc..\n\n251\n00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.690\nSo you download that and then when\nyou're done, you then tee that up.\n\n252\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.210\nSo let's say we have that somewhere.\n\n253\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.120\nYou explode that out so\nwe have all the files.\n\n254\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.120\nAnd let's just take a look\nat that process real quick.\n\n255\n00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.475\nSo let me grab this one.\n\n256\n00:11:47.475 --> 00:11:51.315\nAnd instead of doing select all,\nbecause that would just be ridiculous,\n\n257\n00:11:51.315 --> 00:11:55.575\nlet's just go in and let's grab, you wanna\ndo this in German, what are you thinking?\n\n258\n00:11:55.575 --> 00:11:56.197\nJapanese?\n\n259\n00:11:56.197 --> 00:11:57.458\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We were talking about Japanese earlier.\n\n260\n00:11:57.458 --> 00:11:59.395\n&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, [FOREIGN], exactly.\n\n261\n00:11:59.395 --> 00:12:02.145\nLet's just do the MSI down here,\nwe'll do the RTF,\n\n262\n00:12:02.145 --> 00:12:06.035\nthat's just real small megabyte in size,\napproximately.\n\n263\n00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:08.530\nLet's click Next there, whoops.\n\n264\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.600\nAnd let's do a Save as.\n\n265\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.370\nAnd I'm just going to dump\nthis onto our desktop here so\n\n266\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.700\nthat we can see it real quick.\n\n267\n00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.190\nLet's do a Save as on that one as well.\n\n268\n00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:24.100\nLet's just close that, let's close that.\n\n269\n00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.010\nLet's minimize that,\n\n270\n00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:29.220\nlet's minimize that, let's minimize that,\nlet's minimize everything.\n\n271\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.610\nNow what we got right\nthere is our MSI files,\n\n272\n00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:37.580\njust drag that over here into\nthe light of the streaming knowledge\n\n273\n00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.170\nthat's coming through the Windows\n10 desktop portal right there.\n\n274\n00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.590\nThat's us enlightening you, in real time,\nthat was so gorgeous, look at that.\n\n275\n00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.410\n[LAUGH] A really good one, that I just\ncame up with in real time and lightning\n\n276\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.570\nyou to the Windows 10 web portal cycle,\nso let's just run the MSI real quick.\n\n277\n00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.175\nWe just wanted you to see what we get when\nwe actually explode one of these out.\n\n278\n00:12:55.175 --> 00:12:58.315\nWe're gonna go ahead and accept the UA,\npretty straight forward.\n\n279\n00:12:58.315 --> 00:12:59.665\nGo ahead, and click Next.\n\n280\n00:12:59.665 --> 00:13:03.855\nWe've got a path here,\nI'm gonna modify this path, real quick.\n\n281\n00:13:03.855 --> 00:13:04.985\nAnd, what I'm gonna do,\n\n282\n00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:08.915\nis I'm just gonna create a folder\non the desktop to dump this in to.\n\n283\n00:13:08.915 --> 00:13:11.835\nIt's called MP, just so\nwe know where to find it.\n\n284\n00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:14.974\nAnd, that way we can go\njust quickly grab it, and\n\n285\n00:13:14.974 --> 00:13:19.812\nnot have to go into the default directory\nhere and actually deal with that.\n\n286\n00:13:19.812 --> 00:13:24.740\nLet's do the following,\nwait let me do that one more time.\n\n287\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:30.456\nAnd let's go here, and\nlet's do, in program files,\n\n288\n00:13:30.456 --> 00:13:34.450\nactually we'll do the default path.\n\n289\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:35.030\nLet's do that.\n\n290\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.700\nSee program files X86, and\nwe'll do MP and just do it right there.\n\n291\n00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.380\nOkay so let's do that.\n\n292\n00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.850\nLet's do Next, let's do Install.\n\n293\n00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.160\nJust gotta quickly provide our password\nto have admin rights to do that.\n\n294\n00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.800\nWe'll do that.\n\n295\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.610\nAnd then when we go in,\nyou'll see right there that we get,\n\n296\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.910\njust open that up, we get our MP and\n\n297\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.670\nor our .mp or .mpb file that allows us,\nand we're gonna take a look at how to do\n\n298\n00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:09.210\nthe import here in a minute, allows us to\nthen do the import into a SCOM console.\n\n299\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.130\nSo once we get these downloads of these\nmanagement packs, we're getting them and\n\n300\n00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.130\nthen we're exploding them out.\n\n301\n00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.130\nThey're gonna come down as MSI's,\ntraditionally,\n\n302\n00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.350\nand we're gonna open them up.\n\n303\n00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.730\nWe're gonna have to create an archive\nsomewhere, set them up there,\n\n304\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.580\nand then we're gonna\ndownload extend them out and\n\n305\n00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.470\nthen use these files to actually\nimport the functionality.\n\n306\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.410\nThe difference is the .mp files\nare just the individual files for\n\n307\n00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.590\nthe management pack.\n\n308\n00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.760\nThe .mpv is the management pack bundle\nfile, it's got additional file so\n\n309\n00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.740\nmaybe necessary to support\nthe managing pack.\n\n310\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.840\nAnd so you'll see you have\ndiscovery monitoring library and\n\n311\n00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.800\nwe would then be able bring those in.\n\n312\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.010\nSo we have all that.\n\n313\n00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.810\nSo that's how we would\nthen stage these and\n\n314\n00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:51.350\nset them up if we were going to do\nan import from the local disk essentially\n\n315\n00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.320\non the machine with an archive or direct\nto what we were going to import out of.\n\n316\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.364\nWe could also import over the web using\nthe catalog, we go to Microsoft's site and\n\n317\n00:14:59.364 --> 00:15:02.310\njust pull these down directly\nif you have Internet access.\n\n318\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.634\nSo we have a couple of\ndifferent options here.\n\n319\n00:15:04.634 --> 00:15:09.618\nAnd then, once we decide we're ready\nto go, let's just go back in to our\n\n320\n00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:15.033\nconsole real quick, just reset the lab\ntimer there so we have that ready to go.\n\n321\n00:15:15.033 --> 00:15:20.394\nAnd then in here what we're able to do\nis right-click on management packs and\n\n322\n00:15:20.394 --> 00:15:22.299\nwe can go ahead and import.\n\n323\n00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:26.633\nIf we import management packs we have two\noptions, we have the add feature here,\n\n324\n00:15:26.633 --> 00:15:30.394\nadd from catalogue, that will be\nadding from the Microsoft website,\n\n325\n00:15:30.394 --> 00:15:31.559\nright where that is.\n\n326\n00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:34.024\nOr add from disk like we had\njust talked about go ahead and\n\n327\n00:15:34.024 --> 00:15:35.873\ngarb those files from the local machine.\n\n328\n00:15:35.873 --> 00:15:38.965\nSo you would simply go add\nfrom appropriate area and\n\n329\n00:15:38.965 --> 00:15:40.430\nwe will go put them in.\n\n330\n00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.700\nOnce we're done,\nyou just walk through the wizard.\n\n331\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.130\nThose are then gonna be loaded up in here,\nand they're made available.\n\n332\n00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:52.390\nNow we could also import a management\npack, using the SCOM ops manager shell.\n\n333\n00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.710\nWe can use PowerShell,\nin other words, to do this.\n\n334\n00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.356\nYou'll see that I've got the,\njust move this over just a touch so\n\n335\n00:15:58.356 --> 00:15:59.361\nyou can see that.\n\n336\n00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:04.190\nI've got the command line loaded up here\nfor us, to be able to do the import.\n\n337\n00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.862\nNow there's a couple of\nways we can do this.\n\n338\n00:16:05.862 --> 00:16:09.708\nWe can import, we'll see here SCOM\nmanagement pack, full name so\n\n339\n00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:13.880\nwe specify the path and the name, and\nthis is a sealed management pack.\n\n340\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.410\nThe management packs we\ndownload from Microsoft,\n\n341\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.800\nwe download from third party\nvendors are traditionally sealed.\n\n342\n00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.447\nThe .mp,\n.mpb extensions indicate they're sealed.\n\n343\n00:16:23.447 --> 00:16:27.380\nA sealed management pack is a management\npack that's been created by somebody else.\n\n344\n00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.420\nIt is essentially locked down.\n\n345\n00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.660\nWe import it, and when we do that,\nit looks like this.\n\n346\n00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.910\nAny of these here.\n\n347\n00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:41.600\nI know it's hard to see, but\nthey are gonna have a little gold,\n\n348\n00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.370\nwell it looks like a padlock,\nif you will, at the lower right-hand side\n\n349\n00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:50.790\nof the icon, a little box, it looks like\na little management pack item there.\n\n350\n00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.020\nAnd you can see, and probably the best\nway to deal with it is to just look in\n\n351\n00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.910\nthe column review for sealed for\nthe attribute in sealed yes or no.\n\n352\n00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:01.290\nThe ones that are not sealed have\na little gray icon sitting down here\n\n353\n00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.410\noff to the right and\nthey just have a no value there,\n\n354\n00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.510\nessentially they are not sealed,\nyes, right?\n\n355\n00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.860\nSo the ones that have\nthe gray icon are unsealed.\n\n356\n00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.000\nNow unsealed ones are ones\nwe create ourselves.\n\n357\n00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.371\nWe're gonna show you in an upcoming\nepisode where we do custom management pack\n\n358\n00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:18.347\noffering, how to do that, but\nit's really not complicated at all.\n\n359\n00:17:18.347 --> 00:17:23.890\nLiterally all we do is right click, create\nmanagement pack to create an unsealed one.\n\n360\n00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:24.760\nWe give it a name.\n\n361\n00:17:30.576 --> 00:17:35.520\nWe'll call it un for\nunsealed, and click Next.\n\n362\n00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.028\nWe could ad in some knowledge in\nthere if we want to, right, so\n\n363\n00:17:38.028 --> 00:17:40.977\nwe can just write some documentation up,\nit's actually description,\n\n364\n00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:43.420\nthink with that,\nreally nothing more involved than that.\n\n365\n00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.840\nAnd you could treat that as optional,\nyou don't have to do that.\n\n366\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.370\nAnd it's basically a two-step process\nclick Create there and then as soon as we\n\n367\n00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.950\ndo that it takes a second to refresh\nthat management pack will pop in here.\n\n368\n00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.250\nAnd that's unsealed, we can use that.\n\n369\n00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:00.470\nNow the unsealed management pack is\nimportant because the unsealed management\n\n370\n00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:03.520\npack allows us to add\nmanagement pack elements in.\n\n371\n00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.135\nMonitors, views, dashboards, rules\nall that stuff we were talking about.\n\n372\n00:18:08.135 --> 00:18:13.285\nAnd create our own vision of monitoring\nuniquely tailored to what our need are for\n\n373\n00:18:13.285 --> 00:18:16.845\nwhatever product or information or\nthought process we want to address.\n\n374\n00:18:16.845 --> 00:18:19.275\nThere's my unsealed matters\nfrom pack right there.\n\n375\n00:18:19.275 --> 00:18:22.205\nThe sealed ones come down pre-made,\nthere locked out.\n\n376\n00:18:22.205 --> 00:18:25.925\nNow we can work with them but we have\nto create what are called overrides.\n\n377\n00:18:25.925 --> 00:18:30.170\nAnd you can see here that there's a client\nmonitoring overrides management pack,\n\n378\n00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.970\nthat is one of the default\nones that's available to us.\n\n379\n00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.240\nThat gives us the ability to\noverride the management pack, and\n\n380\n00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.780\noverride is you creating a set of\nadditional settings you want to apply to\n\n381\n00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.280\nthe management pack, or apply through\nthe management pack that's sealed.\n\n382\n00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.140\nAnd we lay them down on top of\nthe management pack as a transform.\n\n383\n00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.760\nWe essentially modify the management\npack in the settings.\n\n384\n00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.407\nBut we don't change\nthe original management pack,\n\n385\n00:18:55.407 --> 00:18:59.136\nwe simply change it when you apply it\nusing the secondary set of settings,\n\n386\n00:18:59.136 --> 00:19:02.945\nstore it in another management pack\nthat's unsealed called an override.\n\n387\n00:19:02.945 --> 00:19:06.271\nAnd those are put together,\nthey're combined and\n\n388\n00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:09.100\nwe generate out one finished product.\n\n389\n00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.200\nSo we have the locked initial baseline or\ntemplate management pack.\n\n390\n00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.010\nWe have the overrides,\nlike the Wonder Twin powers, right?\n\n391\n00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.390\nWe activate them, and then we combine\ntogether, and that's what we get.\n\n392\n00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.510\nAnd so that's how the overrides\ncome into play and\n\n393\n00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:23.690\nthat's the difference between sealed and\nunsealed.\n\n394\n00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.300\nWhen we wanna be able to\noverride the management packs,\n\n395\n00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.750\nwe create an unsealed management\npack to store those overrides, or\n\n396\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.680\nuse one of the existing default ones that\ncan be used as, essentially, a container.\n\n397\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.410\nThe default management pack that's\nin there as well is open and\n\n398\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.140\nyou can use that to store your override.\n\n399\n00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.910\nSo we could do that either way.\n\n400\n00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:47.830\nWhen we go back then and we look at our\nimport through the PowerShell cmdlet.\n\n401\n00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:52.511\nWhen we're importing SCOM\nmanagement pack or using the .mp or\n\n402\n00:19:52.511 --> 00:19:56.676\n.mpb extension,\nit could be either one here, right.\n\n403\n00:19:56.676 --> 00:19:59.334\nThat is a sealed management\npack like the demo that\n\n404\n00:19:59.334 --> 00:20:03.110\nI showed you where we open the management\npack and we saw the files.\n\n405\n00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.420\nThat command line, in other words,\nwould be used to import\n\n406\n00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.290\na sealed management pack or\nset of management packs.\n\n407\n00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:13.410\nHowever, if we wanna import the SCOM\nmanagement pack that is unsealed,\n\n408\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.890\nsame thought process.\n\n409\n00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.550\nOnly difference is right at the very end,\n\n410\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.512\nwe're gonna just simply\nchange this extension.\n\n411\n00:20:19.512 --> 00:20:23.164\nSo instead of .mp or .mpb,\n\n412\n00:20:23.164 --> 00:20:27.870\nwe're gonna use .xml and we would probably\n\n413\n00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:33.250\nwanna do something like instead of sealed,\njust so we know, we'll do unsealed, right?\n\n414\n00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.636\nJust so that you unsell it,\nthat would also be good.\n\n415\n00:20:36.636 --> 00:20:38.472\nIf I could spell,\nit would actually injure us, right?\n\n416\n00:20:38.472 --> 00:20:43.093\nUnsealed.xml, this is the XML file\nthat we're gonna bring in for\n\n417\n00:20:43.093 --> 00:20:45.910\nthe unsealed management pack.\n\n418\n00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:50.030\nAnd by doing that, we're then able to\nbring in the unsealed management pack.\n\n419\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.660\nNow, you may say, well, great,\n\n420\n00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.960\nbut where do I get that\nunsealed management pack from?\n\n421\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.740\nWell, you could get it from a lot of\nplaces, but the most likely place would be\n\n422\n00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.130\nthat you would take an unsealed management\npack, like the one we have here.\n\n423\n00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.898\nYou would right click on it and\nyou would export the management pack,\n\n424\n00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:09.700\nsomebody has created it,\nthey have exported it.\n\n425\n00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.032\nAnd then if they leave it unsealed\nbecause we can seal management packs that\n\n426\n00:21:13.032 --> 00:21:18.055\nare unsealed, we'll talk about that whole\nprocess in another episode later on.\n\n427\n00:21:18.055 --> 00:21:20.775\nBut the idea is you can either\nexport these as unsealed or\n\n428\n00:21:20.775 --> 00:21:24.495\nyou can go through a process to\nseal them and then export them.\n\n429\n00:21:24.495 --> 00:21:25.955\nRather export them and then seal them and\n\n430\n00:21:25.955 --> 00:21:28.765\nthen you would be able to you know\nessentially use them either way.\n\n431\n00:21:28.765 --> 00:21:31.985\nBut if we choose to export this\nas an unsealed management pack,\n\n432\n00:21:31.985 --> 00:21:33.595\nit's very simple to do.\n\n433\n00:21:33.595 --> 00:21:37.415\nWe export, let's just throw\nthis out here on the desktop.\n\n434\n00:21:37.415 --> 00:21:44.673\nWe'll make a folder for it and we'll\ncall it un cuz that is just so original.\n\n435\n00:21:44.673 --> 00:21:46.867\n[CROSSTALK] It is.\n\n436\n00:21:46.867 --> 00:21:51.224\nAnd then you'll see we export and\nif you notice the name of the file,\n\n437\n00:21:51.224 --> 00:21:54.740\nthe name of the management\npack .xml at the end.\n\n438\n00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:59.460\nThat's our unsealed management pack XML\nfile that we're now gonna be able to\n\n439\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:04.830\nuse in the shell and\ncall in to actually do the import, right.\n\n440\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:09.550\nSo if I went in and I took a look here,\nI will find that I have this file.\n\n441\n00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.890\nIt's just a text file,\nit's very simple to open, right.\n\n442\n00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.110\nAnd we can open it up.\n\n443\n00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.710\nAnd this one's really not got anything\nin it cuz I haven't loaded anything into\n\n444\n00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:17.740\nthe management pack yet.\n\n445\n00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.440\nIf I started adding views,\nI added monitors, added rules,\n\n446\n00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.410\nadded all sorts of stuff,\nthen I would have an extensive file.\n\n447\n00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.775\nBut this is very small.\n\n448\n00:22:25.775 --> 00:22:29.645\nBut this is essentially what's in the file\nthis is what makes the manage pack or\n\n449\n00:22:29.645 --> 00:22:32.095\nthe setting tells us how\nto configure everything.\n\n450\n00:22:32.095 --> 00:22:36.191\nSo when I go to import this if I'm\nimporting an XML file cuzz it's unsealed,\n\n451\n00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:37.281\nI need one of these.\n\n452\n00:22:37.281 --> 00:22:41.013\nSo somebody's gotta export that\nunsealed management pack so\n\n453\n00:22:41.013 --> 00:22:45.101\nthat I can then get that XML file,\nessentially my definition file,\n\n454\n00:22:45.101 --> 00:22:48.240\nthat I can then turn around and\nI can bring it.\n\n455\n00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.420\nSo that's how we close the loop here,\n\n456\n00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:55.560\nthe circle of management pack import life,\nright, that we need to reference.\n\n457\n00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.284\nRight, it's like Mufasa, only better.\n\n458\n00:22:57.284 --> 00:22:58.039\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It moves us all.\n\n459\n00:22:58.039 --> 00:22:58.689\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does, so\n\n460\n00:22:58.689 --> 00:23:02.273\nwe're gonna bring in those management\npacks, we're gonna then as you saw,\n\n461\n00:23:02.273 --> 00:23:03.670\nimport them either way.\n\n462\n00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.790\nWe like talking about the ops manager\nshell, we like using PowerShell when and\n\n463\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:08.700\nwhere possible.\n\n464\n00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.480\nThroughout all of our episodes,\nwe always try, and we'll continue to try\n\n465\n00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.610\nto bring PowerShell into the mix for you\nwhere we can, show you some alternate ways\n\n466\n00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.380\nto be able to accomplish the same\nresults that we're doing in the console.\n\n467\n00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.410\nNot because you can't do\neverything in the console,\n\n468\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.310\nnot because you can't do\neverything in PowerShell.\n\n469\n00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.950\nQuite the opposite,\nyou could do it either way,\n\n470\n00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:26.970\nbut the point is you wanna have options.\n\n471\n00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.080\nSometimes you feel like a Powershell,\nsometimes you don't alright.\n\n472\n00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.290\nSo it's just a question of\nwhat you want to do but\n\n473\n00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.620\nif you want to use PowerShell then\nobviously you can do this as well.\n\n474\n00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.673\nGoing back to the console for\njust a moment,\n\n475\n00:23:37.673 --> 00:23:40.184\nwe just click here to bring that back up,\nthere we go.\n\n476\n00:23:40.184 --> 00:23:42.525\nSo we have our management packs set up,\nright,\n\n477\n00:23:42.525 --> 00:23:46.300\nwe now have the ability to work with\nit in theory and interact with it.\n\n478\n00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.920\nSo we've talked about all that.\n\n479\n00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.160\nSealed management packs, we've talked\nabout the fact they're read only, right,\n\n480\n00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.120\nthey're used to be able to then\ncreate a standard baseline.\n\n481\n00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.285\nWe apply overrides to be\nable to work with them.\n\n482\n00:23:56.285 --> 00:23:58.805\nThey can be referenced by\nother management packs, so\n\n483\n00:23:58.805 --> 00:24:01.885\nthey can be brought in by an unsealed\nmanagement pack, as I said,\n\n484\n00:24:01.885 --> 00:24:04.808\ncombined together and\nthen we can deliver to you that output.\n\n485\n00:24:04.808 --> 00:24:07.883\nAnd we also need to talk\nabout the different elements.\n\n486\n00:24:07.883 --> 00:24:11.428\nThat are gonna help us to be able to\ngo in and to discover objects and\n\n487\n00:24:11.428 --> 00:24:15.232\ninteract with them and work with\nthem through the management pack, or\n\n488\n00:24:15.232 --> 00:24:18.330\nthe things that the management\npack will monitor.\n\n489\n00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:22.120\nWhen I create a management pack, I have to\ndecide how it's going to be applied and\n\n490\n00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.700\nwhat its targets are going to be.\n\n491\n00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.440\nWe call this object discovery.\n\n492\n00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.500\nAnd so we use object discovery to discover\nthe applications or the components,\n\n493\n00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.900\nthe infrastructure, whatever it is.\n\n494\n00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.190\nThat we're gonna monitor\nwith three different ways.\n\n495\n00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.740\nThree different ways,\nnot two, not four, but three.\n\n496\n00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.500\nThree different ways of interacting and\ndoing this.\n\n497\n00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.890\nWe could do registry based discovery,\nobject discovery.\n\n498\n00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:46.670\nThis is our preferred method because\nit requires the least amount of CPU and\n\n499\n00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.780\nmemory overhead, so\nit's the least intensive on the system.\n\n500\n00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.410\nCuz what we're doing is going\nthrough the registry of the target,\n\n501\n00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.560\nlooking to see whether there's\ncertain configurations and\n\n502\n00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.940\nif there are keys are available, in other\nwords we say okay, great let me do that.\n\n503\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.310\nIf not, then we don't.\n\n504\n00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:04.110\nWe can use WMI so we can use WQL,\nWMI query language to figure out\n\n505\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.740\nwhether something is set up and\nconfigured a certain way.\n\n506\n00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.160\nOr we can use scripts and\nwe can essentially run some sort of script\n\n507\n00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.230\nto be able to go through and\ndo this as well.\n\n508\n00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:15.840\nWe also have to think about using\nmanagement pack rules, these are used to\n\n509\n00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.350\nessentially structure outcomes and\ncontrol what it is we would like.\n\n510\n00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.300\nWe've three different rules, this are all\nthe different building blocks and\n\n511\n00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.840\nmoving parts of the management paths.\n\n512\n00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.440\nWe've alert generating rules, you could\nprobably figure out, what there's the red\n\n513\n00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.090\nbased on the occurrence of events\nthat generates sort of an alert.\n\n514\n00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.690\nWe saw the output of that,\nwe looked at the alert view\n\n515\n00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.130\njust as we were getting started\nas we opened up the console and\n\n516\n00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.370\nwe took a look at the fact\nwe had some alerts in there.\n\n517\n00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:42.230\nWe have a collection, this is a collection\nrule that stores and gathers data so\n\n518\n00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.840\nit can be used for reporting later.\n\n519\n00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:48.540\nWe also have timed commands that will\nrun commands, bat files, executables,\n\n520\n00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.130\nthey can be scheduled in other words and\nexecute at a certain point and time.\n\n521\n00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.680\nSo we have these types of rules.\n\n522\n00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.590\nWe also have what are known as monitors,\n\n523\n00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.020\nthese show the health state of\nan application or an object.\n\n524\n00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.200\nWe can interact with these and\nwork with these.\n\n525\n00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.780\nA health state will be monitored in\neither what's called a two state or\n\n526\n00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.170\na three state solution.\n\n527\n00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.760\nTwo state red green,\nthree-state, red, green, yellow.\n\n528\n00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.030\nSo, a stoplight KPIs,\nright, in other words.\n\n529\n00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.950\nSometimes called RAG, red, amber,\ngreen, essentially the same idea.\n\n530\n00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.390\nKPIs or RAG charting,\nyou may have heard of that before,\n\n531\n00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.280\nit's just a thought process\nassociated with this.\n\n532\n00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.475\nWe do use rules and monitors together\nto drive the collection of data, so\n\n533\n00:26:23.475 --> 00:26:24.435\nwe want to keep that in mind.\n\n534\n00:26:24.435 --> 00:26:28.474\nBut understand monitors don't store\nthe collected data that they generate in\n\n535\n00:26:28.474 --> 00:26:31.960\nthe ops manager database,\nthey only store health state changes and\n\n536\n00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.485\nalert information in\nthe ops manager database.\n\n537\n00:26:34.485 --> 00:26:36.987\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that,\n[CROSSTALK] sort of extinction.\n\n538\n00:26:36.987 --> 00:26:40.832\n&gt;&gt; Sounds very similar to something\nlike O'Ryan or solar winds,\n\n539\n00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:44.532\ntype of product where it's\nlooking at this data, whether or\n\n540\n00:26:44.532 --> 00:26:48.240\nnot my network devices are online and\nmy servers are online.\n\n541\n00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.670\nGonna look at the health,\ngive me that red,\n\n542\n00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:54.780\ngreen blue kinda thing, is this a direct\ncompetitor to that type of system.\n\n543\n00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.950\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and I prefer not to say\ncompetitor but just friendly association,\n\n544\n00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.200\nwe all know each other, we're part\nof the same broad thought process.\n\n545\n00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.805\nYes this specifically SCOM is meant\nto compete in that market space.\n\n546\n00:27:07.805 --> 00:27:11.995\nIt's like O'Ryan, it's like HP open view,\nIBM tively, Solar Winds,\n\n547\n00:27:11.995 --> 00:27:16.670\nthe O'Ryan product from Solar Winds,\nSpiceWorks has a product that does this.\n\n548\n00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.010\nThere's a whole bunch of different\ncompanies that are in this space,\n\n549\n00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.680\nnot unusual today by any means.\n\n550\n00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.670\nThey're all good by the way,\nwe're not saying this particular one or\n\n551\n00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.820\nthat particular one is good or\nbad compared to others.\n\n552\n00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.660\nBut Daniel asked a very\nimportant question.\n\n553\n00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.750\nHey, is this essentially what I'm\ngetting if I buy these other products?\n\n554\n00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.620\nThe answer is absolutely,\nit's exactly what they do.\n\n555\n00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.420\nWe do it as well and\nwe're just talking about how we do it.\n\n556\n00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.150\nWhen I say we I mean Microsoft but\n\n557\n00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.850\nwe could be talking about\nany of those products.\n\n558\n00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.890\nThere would be slight\ndifferences of course, and\n\n559\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.010\nvariations on how we apply this.\n\n560\n00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.510\nThe language, the terminology, the things\nwe do but at the end of the day,\n\n561\n00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:48.980\nmonitoring's monitoring.\n\n562\n00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.350\nYou take a look at something,\nyou report back on it, you document,\n\n563\n00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.580\nyou report it out so we can then interact\nwith it in some dashboard like format.\n\n564\n00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.260\nThe formula's basically gonna be the same,\n\n565\n00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.180\nregardless of who's doing\nthe baking on the back end.\n\n566\n00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:05.240\nWe have different types of monitors\nthat we can talk about, unit monitors,\n\n567\n00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.930\naggregate roll up monitors, and\n\n568\n00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.370\ndependency roll up monitors are different\ntypes of monitors we find there.\n\n569\n00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:11.930\nLet's just take a look at monitors and\n\n570\n00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.290\nrules of a little bit of information about\nthem without throwing a whole bunch of\n\n571\n00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.670\nvocabulary out at you\nabout different objects.\n\n572\n00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.730\nI'm gonna show you where some of these\nthings live here in just a minute as well.\n\n573\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:25.070\nLet me just bring up the website here,\ngive me just a second.\n\n574\n00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.960\nGo over to tab number two right and\nwe can see Monitors and Rules and\n\n575\n00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.320\nwe do have some information.\n\n576\n00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.120\nI made this point before and\nI'll make it in upcoming episodes as well\n\n577\n00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:39.070\nthat the documentation on this product is\nreally tight, really good on the website.\n\n578\n00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:43.020\nMicrosoft's done a really good job with\nTechNet putting out up to date technical\n\n579\n00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.040\ndocumentation on every\naspect of this product.\n\n580\n00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:50.690\nIt is a complex web of interactivity\nthat we generate with SCOM and\n\n581\n00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.300\nthe system center components that\nwe talk about linking it to.\n\n582\n00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.300\nVirtual machine manager,\nservice manager, config manager,\n\n583\n00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:03.100\ndata protection manager,\nthe app controller, orchestrator, right?\n\n584\n00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:08.570\nThese are very complex systems and\ncomplex interactions with connectors.\n\n585\n00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.280\nWe'll have an episode coming up later\nwhere we show you how to link service\n\n586\n00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.830\nmanager with connectors back into SCOM.\n\n587\n00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:18.270\nSo alerts generated and configuration\ninformation generated can be dealt with\n\n588\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.920\nin our service desk queues\nupdated in realtime And\n\n589\n00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.405\nclosed out in a bidirectional feed.\n\n590\n00:29:23.405 --> 00:29:26.440\nWe'll talk about connecting out to\nthe Active Directory, pulling user and\n\n591\n00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.450\ngroup information in for discovery, so\n\n592\n00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.900\nservice manager knows how\nmanage objects and update SCOM.\n\n593\n00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.341\nWe talk about using Orchestrator to\ncreate workflow, App Controller to play\n\n594\n00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:41.332\napplications, Virtual Machine Manager to\nmanage our fabric for our private networks\n\n595\n00:29:41.332 --> 00:29:45.389\nand our private cloud infrastructure\nto do virtual machine hosting.\n\n596\n00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:50.179\nWe talk about all of these different tools\nand techniques and technologies, and\n\n597\n00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:54.688\ncombining them together can get a little\nbit involved, little bit involved\n\n598\n00:29:54.688 --> 00:29:58.703\nin the sense it's very deep and\nvery, very specific set of steps and\n\n599\n00:29:58.703 --> 00:30:01.823\na very broad architecture\nthat we have to engage in.\n\n600\n00:30:01.823 --> 00:30:04.741\nBut once we stand it all up,\nwe get it all working,\n\n601\n00:30:04.741 --> 00:30:09.330\nthis is the heart SCOM product is the\nbeating heart of all of those technologies\n\n602\n00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.735\nbecause all that data from all\nof them is flowing in here and\n\n603\n00:30:12.735 --> 00:30:15.744\nbeing used to update and\nmanage state in real time.\n\n604\n00:30:15.744 --> 00:30:18.780\nAnd then, in many cases flowing\nout to our reporting interface.\n\n605\n00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.390\nNow let's just go up here for\na second, and\n\n606\n00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:25.660\nyou can see, remember our diagram we've\nbeen referencing for architecture.\n\n607\n00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.660\nWe can see that regardless of where we're\ncoming from, agents that are outside\n\n608\n00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:35.020\nof our domain, not domain joined,\nin remote locations with low bandwidth,\n\n609\n00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:38.740\nthat they're not consistently able\nto connect across high latency,\n\n610\n00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.500\nlow bandwidth scenarios will be\ndeploying our gateway server.\n\n611\n00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.329\nFirst we talk about to drive that\ninformation in to our resourceful pool f\n\n612\n00:30:45.329 --> 00:30:46.900\nmanagement services.\n\n613\n00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.840\nInternal systems that are being monitored\nwith agents that are on the LAN that\n\n614\n00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:55.230\nare connected with low latency and high\nreliable bandwidth will be sitting here.\n\n615\n00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:59.660\nWe've got our ops manager database, our\ndata warehouse database sitting over here,\n\n616\n00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.900\nwe got our consoles that are connecting\nin, that are updating us in real time.\n\n617\n00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:08.490\nWe've got a reporting server functionality\nthat's connecting into the Ops Manager\n\n618\n00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:12.670\ndata warehouse database using queries\nto be able to pull data out and\n\n619\n00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.190\nupdate us through reporting,\n\n620\n00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:18.450\nthrough dashboards, through a variety\nof mechanisms as to what the status is.\n\n621\n00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.410\nAll this is happening in here, right?\n\n622\n00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:24.080\nAnd all this is taking place\nbecause of management packs and\n\n623\n00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.480\nbecause of the ability to monitor and to\nuse rules in order to be able to do this.\n\n624\n00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.050\nSo reading up on the different monitors,\nthe health state, right?\n\n625\n00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.430\nWe talked about unit monitors,\n\n626\n00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:36.840\ndependency monitors, aggregate monitors,\nthese rollout monitors.\n\n627\n00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.560\nThere's a little bit of documentation\nhere as to what they are,\n\n628\n00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.010\nwe'll be able to take a look at what\nthe health explorer looks like.\n\n629\n00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:47.380\nI show you this in some upcoming episodes\nand we can delve in, right-click\n\n630\n00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.545\non a machine, go into health explorer, see\nwhat's going on with the entity health.\n\n631\n00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:54.475\nDrill down, find out what's good and\nbad at every level.\n\n632\n00:31:54.475 --> 00:31:58.253\nDrill through these and\nsee linkages to events, to alerts and\n\n633\n00:31:58.253 --> 00:32:00.517\nto interactive status in real time.\n\n634\n00:32:00.517 --> 00:32:04.400\nSo it's a very powerful element of\nmonitoring that we can engage in here.\n\n635\n00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.898\nWe've got our rules alerting collection\nand command rules as I mentioned to you.\n\n636\n00:32:07.898 --> 00:32:10.170\nAnd the ability to interact with them.\n\n637\n00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.070\nShould we create a monitor or rule,\nwhich one is going to make the most sense?\n\n638\n00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:16.470\nWe can use monitors and rules,\nthey are very similar as I mentioned.\n\n639\n00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:19.730\nThe difference is, of course is I\ntalked about, how we store the data and\n\n640\n00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:20.650\nwhat we do with it.\n\n641\n00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:24.680\nAnd we say, hey create a monitor if,\nright, you have some of these reasons.\n\n642\n00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.800\nHey create a rule if, you want to collect\nperformance counters or events for\n\n643\n00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.530\nanalysis and reporting.\n\n644\n00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:33.200\nMonitors only collect information when\nthey initiate a change in health state.\n\n645\n00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.657\nRules go through and collect it in\na different way and have more information.\n\n646\n00:32:36.657 --> 00:32:39.933\nWant to generate an alert that's not\nrelated to health state of an object,\n\n647\n00:32:39.933 --> 00:32:41.295\na rule's a good idea for that.\n\n648\n00:32:41.295 --> 00:32:44.007\nSo you can read through these scenarios,\nreally good and\n\n649\n00:32:44.007 --> 00:32:45.941\nI made this point at least once already.\n\n650\n00:32:45.941 --> 00:32:49.859\nI'll make it in some upcoming episodes\nabout the fact that what I like a lot\n\n651\n00:32:49.859 --> 00:32:54.219\nabout the documentation in particular is\nMicrosoft has done a great job not just of\n\n652\n00:32:54.219 --> 00:32:57.440\ntelling us technically,\nhey this is what you need to do, but\n\n653\n00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.039\ngiving us the scenarios and\nthe context to understand how to do it and\n\n654\n00:33:01.039 --> 00:33:03.800\nthe reasons why we would\nchoose one over the other.\n\n655\n00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.740\nThat's one of the biggest pain points for\nmost IT professionals\n\n656\n00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.013\nwhen you use a tool like this is,\nam I making the right choices, right?\n\n657\n00:33:10.013 --> 00:33:11.990\nAm I using this the right way?\n\n658\n00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:15.180\nIs this the scenario that\nindicates I should be doing this?\n\n659\n00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.870\nAnd you always kinda scratch your head,\nyou're just not sure.\n\n660\n00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:20.460\nThey've done a really great job\nof helping us walk through that.\n\n661\n00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.510\nEspecially if you're newer\nto the product you may or\n\n662\n00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:26.800\nmay not necessarily understand all\nthe intricacies and the subtleties\n\n663\n00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.260\nof all these just things that\nare floating around that you gotta do.\n\n664\n00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.740\nAnd you're just kinda flying by the seat\nof your pants hoping it all works\n\n665\n00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.550\nout, right.\n\n666\n00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.890\nOr somebody's come in and configured\nit all for you, a consultant, right,\n\n667\n00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:40.350\nhopefully done a good job for you.\n\n668\n00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.620\nBut a lot of it may be black box,\n\n669\n00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.140\nyou just really may not\nunderstand what they did, right.\n\n670\n00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.910\nAnd as a result of that, you may really\nwe scared to get in there a mess around,\n\n671\n00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:51.070\ntouch things, start interacting and\nfiguring stuff out.\n\n672\n00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:54.161\nYou have the documentation, it's really\ngonna help you walk through that, and\n\n673\n00:33:54.161 --> 00:33:55.260\navoid some of that concern.\n\n674\n00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.307\nSo, it hopefully will be a value add for\n\n675\n00:33:57.307 --> 00:34:00.731\nyou to be able to delve into\nthe websites we're sharing with you.\n\n676\n00:34:00.731 --> 00:34:04.325\nWe'll continue to in upcoming episodes and\nmake sure you're comfortable with these,\n\n677\n00:34:04.325 --> 00:34:05.061\nand you see them.\n\n678\n00:34:05.061 --> 00:34:07.562\nWe'll continue talking\nabout setting up SCOM,\n\n679\n00:34:07.562 --> 00:34:11.466\ndealing with some of the other items\nassociated with the management packs,\n\n680\n00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:14.280\ntargeting, for instance,\nand how to deal with that.\n\n681\n00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.800\nWe'll talk about run as accounts, run as\nprofiles, coming up and some of the other\n\n682\n00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.770\nstuff associated with configuring\nthe fabric in the app monitoring,\n\n683\n00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.910\ncuz it's all gonna still be very\nimportant stuff we gotta cover.\n\n684\n00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:26.860\nAnd as I promised you, I will do, but I'm\nnot gonna do now cuz we're out of time,\n\n685\n00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.500\nwe'll show you in the next episode.\n\n686\n00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.640\nWe'll go in, and just show you\nwhere all those elements are, so\n\n687\n00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.620\nwhen you right-click and say New, and you\nwanna create stuff to drop in a management\n\n688\n00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.810\npack, you'll see where they\nare in the authoring portion.\n\n689\n00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:37.865\nThe authoring workspace,\n\n690\n00:34:37.865 --> 00:34:40.152\nwe'll show you where all the stuff\nis we've been talking about.\n\n691\n00:34:40.152 --> 00:34:41.830\nSo, a reason to come on back, as they say.\n\n692\n00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:44.830\n&gt;&gt; Definitely that, that sounds very cool,\nI'm looking forward to seeing that.\n\n693\n00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.700\nAdam, we do thank you for\ngetting us this far.\n\n694\n00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.310\nLike you said, looks like we're\nout of time for this episode so\n\n695\n00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:52.240\nwe will have to continue this\nconversation into a part two.\n\n696\n00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.200\nHopefully we'll see you there.\n\n697\n00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.680\nWe do thank you for watching.\n\n698\n00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.540\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n699\n00:34:57.540

00:00:08.228\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:12.376\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:14.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.010\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.780\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are back with more of our data\n\n8\n00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.190\ncenter monitoring with Microsoft Scum,\nseries I guess that is.\n\n9\n00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.540\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio to\ncontinue that series, our good friend Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.160\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.556\nAdam, welcome back man, how goes it today?\n\n12\n00:00:32.556 --> 00:00:34.659\n[SOUND] With emphasis.\n\n13\n00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:35.293\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n14\n00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:36.424\nAbsolutely awesome.\n\n15\n00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:37.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I would say scum-erific but\n\n16\n00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:40.470\nwe've already used that\nin at least one episode.\n\n17\n00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.260\nIt is, as always, going fabulously well.\n\n18\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.270\nThe reason is I get to\nspend time with you.\n\n19\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.200\nTalking about really cool technology.\n\n20\n00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.660\nAnd get to hang out with this gentleman\nover here who gets to talk with me\n\n21\n00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.100\nabout just about anything I\ndecide I wanna talk about,\n\n22\n00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.530\nbecause that's what we need Daniel to do.\n\n23\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.500\n&gt;&gt; They chain me to the desk.\n\n24\n00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.310\n&gt;&gt; Share the knowledge.\n\n25\n00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.080\n&gt;&gt; They chain me to the desk.\n\n26\n00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They do, we've talked about\n\n27\n00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.660\nthat before.\n\n28\n00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.930\nSo he's gonna come up with some\nreally cool stuff along the way here,\n\n29\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.920\nI'm sure, as he always does.\n\n30\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.310\nBut let's start off by picking up where\nwe left off in the prior episode.\n\n31\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.870\nAnd if you did not see that episode,\nstrongly encourage you,\n\n32\n00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.510\nmore strongly than before, with many of\nother, hey if you haven't watched it,\n\n33\n00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.700\ngo back and\ntake a look at it conversations.\n\n34\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.040\nThis one in particular because the last\nepisode was really where we laid down\n\n35\n00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.990\npretty in depth discussion, foundational\nknowledge about management packs.\n\n36\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.780\nHow we're structuring them, what we're\ndoing to set up the configuration or\n\n37\n00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.310\nthe specifications around fabric and\napplication monitoring.\n\n38\n00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.010\nAnd we left off kinda in the middle\nthere and said all right, hey.\n\n39\n00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.700\nWe've talked about rules,\ntalked about this, talked about monitors,\n\n40\n00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.970\ntalked about that.\n\n41\n00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.070\nGotta be sure on this and that, otherwise\njust it doesn't make sense, right,\n\n42\n00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.530\nyou gotta have this and that.\n\n43\n00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.990\nAnd by the way.\n\n44\n00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.400\nTotal random aside,\nthis is our random aside for this episode.\n\n45\n00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.150\nAre you a Bob's Burger fan?\n\n46\n00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.890\n&gt;&gt; Bob's Burger,\nI don't even think I know them.\n\n47\n00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.900\n&gt;&gt; You don't know of Bob?\n\n48\n00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.700\nI'm talking about the cartoon\nas opposed to the place.\n\n49\n00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.555\nAgain, I would say [CROSSTALK].\n\n50\n00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:01.660\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm thinking probably\na swing and a miss in this regard.\n\n51\n00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.230\nSo if you haven't seen\nthe animated series.\n\n52\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.468\nOn the order of Family Guy, or\nAmerican Dad, or [CROSSTALK].\n\n53\n00:02:06.468 --> 00:02:10.182\n&gt;&gt; It's not quite like that,\nbut it is that concept.\n\n54\n00:02:10.182 --> 00:02:11.437\nIn that well it's a family.\n\n55\n00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:13.690\nLiterally it's Family Guy\nowns a burger shop.\n\n56\n00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.500\nIt's like him and his wife, the kids.\n\n57\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.320\nIt's about all that.\n\n58\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.220\nIt's a great series, you gotta watch it.\n\n59\n00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.990\nBut if you haven't seen it, you have\nno idea what to make reference to, so.\n\n60\n00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.420\nYou lose out on that one,\nbecause it was a really cool one, but\n\n61\n00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.240\nwe'll just save that one for another time.\n\n62\n00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.350\nYou sir, have homework.\n\n63\n00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.860\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; You need to take a look at\n\n64\n00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.190\nBob's Burgers.\n\n65\n00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.120\nAnd we need to circle back and\nperhaps jump back in at some point and\n\n66\n00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.930\nreintegrate that into the conversation.\n\n67\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.070\nAlright, anyway, if you haven't seen it,\n\n68\n00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.200\nyou guys should go out,\nwatch Bob's Burgers, awesome show.\n\n69\n00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.090\nSo, what I was going to suggest is that we\nleft off, really in the middle of cooking.\n\n70\n00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.450\nYou ruined the whole analogy.\n\n71\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.880\nThis is just just cooking the perfect\nburger, just like in Bob's Burgers.\n\n72\n00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.650\nThat's the thing, in every show,\nhe's got a different burger,\n\n73\n00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.850\ncuz it's a burger restaurant,\ndifferent burger.\n\n74\n00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.880\nHe's got the board up,\nlike the burger of the day, so\n\n75\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.080\nit'd be something like the mac and\ncheese burger.\n\n76\n00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.520\nAnd he's got a catchy title for\n\n77\n00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.160\nevery one of the It's really\na theme thing, it's really cool.\n\n78\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.430\nAnyway, but\nas I said again it does not work.\n\n79\n00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.310\n&gt;&gt; If I don't actually know what\nhe's talking about [LAUGH].\n\n80\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.650\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking,\nwe may need to throw this whole episode.\n\n81\n00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.530\n&gt;&gt; Just redo.\n\n82\n00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.310\n&gt;&gt; We need to come back.\n\n83\n00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.970\nLike one's your burgified.\n\n84\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well that could-\n&gt;&gt; Bob-ify.\n\n85\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.170\n&gt;&gt; That could be awhile-\n&gt;&gt; That could,\n\n86\n00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.803\nthat could take awhile-\n\n87\n00:03:25.803 --> 00:03:26.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're right.\n\n88\n00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.380\nSo we probably should push through-\n&gt;&gt; Probably should just go-\n\n89\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.710\n&gt;&gt; All right, we'll just keep going.\n\n90\n00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.680\nSo what I was gonna suggest was that we\nhave to go back in and essentially finish\n\n91\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.965\ncooking up all the stuff we need to put\ntogether to set these management packs up.\n\n92\n00:03:37.965 --> 00:03:39.445\nWe're gonna jump back in and\n\n93\n00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:42.625\npick back up with that talk about\ntargeting a little bit, run as accounts,\n\n94\n00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:47.795\nrun as profiles, link them back to\nthis context that we've been creating.\n\n95\n00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:50.505\nAnd so, I want you to make sure\nyou've seen all that stuff\n\n96\n00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:51.865\nbefore you pick up here.\n\n97\n00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:55.390\nBecause this discussion's gonna make\nthis amount of sense to you, and\n\n98\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.130\nI'm not talking about\nthe three fingers here.\n\n99\n00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.670\nI'm talking about the zero here.\n\n100\n00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.770\nIt's just not gonna make sense to you\nuntil you see the other stuff cuz we're\n\n101\n00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.840\njumping in half to three-quarters of\nthe way through that conversation.\n\n102\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.530\nSo I wanna just give you that heads up,\ninvite you to go back,\n\n103\n00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.760\ntake a look at that episode.\n\n104\n00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.750\nCome on back if you've already seen it,\nstay here if you haven't.\n\n105\n00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.670\nJust take a few minutes, go watch that,\nthen come on back and let's continue on.\n\n106\n00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.820\nSo, this would be a good time.\n\n107\n00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.302\nI don't know if you watch Bob's Burgers.\n\n108\n00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:20.599\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you do this.\n\n109\n00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.306\nI'll watch Bob's Burgers.\n\n110\n00:04:22.306 --> 00:04:25.500\n&gt;&gt; You could do that while we're waiting\nand then we could just pretended like it\n\n111\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.920\nwas all working out and\npick it up right from here.\n\n112\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.900\nYou're not gonna do that are you?\n\n113\n00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.430\nNo, all right.\nSo let's talk about target a little bit.\n\n114\n00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.580\nSo we've been talking\nabout management packs.\n\n115\n00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.450\nHow to set them up.\n\n116\n00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.870\nTargeting is actually a really\nsimple concept, right.\n\n117\n00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.880\nSo you sir, I know, are a enthusiast\nof things that go bang and\n\n118\n00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.500\nthings you throw and go, and they stick.\n\n119\n00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n120\n00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.860\n&gt;&gt; And all sorts of stuff.\n\n121\n00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.370\nDaniel likes knives and guns.\n\n122\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.250\nAnd so if I say I wanna target something,\nI am selecting a target.\n\n123\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.565\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Let's keep this clean,\n\n124\n00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:54.020\nremember this is a family-oriented\nthought process right?\n\n125\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.560\nSo if I am selecting a target\nIn your mind, right?\n\n126\n00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.070\nWithout necessarily referring to SCOM.\n\n127\n00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.410\nWhat would you think we're talking about?\n\n128\n00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.240\nWhat would selected target mean to you?\n\n129\n00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.110\nIn other words, if I said that to you.\n\n130\n00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.300\nSaid hey, we need a selected target,\nwhat are we doing?\n\n131\n00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.100\n&gt;&gt; It's selecting the thing\nthat you want to hit, right?\n\n132\n00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.750\nSo if we're talking about guns or knives,\nI wanna throw a bullet or a knife at that.\n\n133\n00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.940\nThat is the intended area in which that\nshould land or hit, as I like to say.\n\n134\n00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.070\nIf we're talking in computers then\nmaybe I want to see something like\n\n135\n00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.170\ndid it run successfully or not?\n\n136\n00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.920\nThat would be my intended target.\n\n137\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.250\nDid I hit that?\n\n138\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.130\nIntended computer or not,\nthat would be my intended target-\n\n139\n00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.730\n&gt;&gt; Good, so and\n\n140\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.830\nyou said the exact word I was hoping for.\n\n141\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.880\nDid it run or not, right?\n\n142\n00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.030\nAs you said when talking about computers,\ndid we successfully get that to run?\n\n143\n00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.590\nSo the targeting idea, selecting a target\nis really just deciding what machine or\n\n144\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.500\nmachines we wanna be monitoring\nwith the monitor pack, or\n\n145\n00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.650\nthe management pack rather.\n\n146\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.660\nWhere the rule or monitor's gonna be\nrunning is what we're doing when thinking\n\n147\n00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.310\nabout when we're talking about targeting.\n\n148\n00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.680\nSo we wanna make sure we\nunderstand the concept.\n\n149\n00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.490\nLet's take a look real quick\nover here if we could.\n\n150\n00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.020\nSelecting a target.\n\n151\n00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.175\nWe've got the webpage up.\n\n152\n00:05:59.175 --> 00:06:01.980\nAand as always, these URLs are gonna\nbe in the show notes for you.\n\n153\n00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.500\nSo you're gonna have them but\nvery first sentence here.\n\n154\n00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.440\nEvery time you create a monitor or rule,\nyou must select the target for it,\n\n155\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.050\ndetermining where the monitor or\nrule will run.\n\n156\n00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.090\nAnd how it will be used, that's the exact\nthing that Daniel was describing to us.\n\n157\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.570\nYou would almost swear that he had been\ngiven that information ahead of time,\n\n158\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.450\ncould have looked it up and knew it was.\n\n159\n00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.181\n&gt;&gt; I divined that sir.\n\n160\n00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:22.426\n&gt;&gt; But I was going to say,\nyou are honest and\n\n161\n00:06:22.426 --> 00:06:26.930\nwould never have done that without telling\nour polite and kind studio audience.\n\n162\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.860\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; That you were up to such shenanigans.\n\n163\n00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.650\nSo, great opportunity for us to understand\nthat one of the most important,\n\n164\n00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.400\ncritical elements, we get everything\norganized with management pack, right?\n\n165\n00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.010\nBut if we don't target it,\n\n166\n00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.405\nthen we've really got no\nopportunity to gather information.\n\n167\n00:06:40.405 --> 00:06:43.460\nCuz we've got the thing,\nwe got it all set up, but\n\n168\n00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.410\nwe're not actually saying,\nhey go use it over there, right?\n\n169\n00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.540\nI like that whole throw a bullet thing,\nI've never thrown a bullet.\n\n170\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.260\nI've thrown a knife, I've shot bullets.\n\n171\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.920\nIt's a lot more efficient\nwhen you shoot them.\n\n172\n00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I haven't thrown them before.\n\n173\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.850\nI imagine if you were like the Hulk or\nsomebody.\n\n174\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.780\n&gt;&gt; That would really work.\n\n175\n00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.730\n&gt;&gt; That would probably work, but for\n\n176\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.030\nthe average human being, I'm not really\nstrong enough to throw a bullet.\n\n177\n00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.220\n&gt;&gt; Superman could just tap the primer.\n\n178\n00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he would be like,\nbut I prefer to shoot mine.\n\n179\n00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.090\n&gt;&gt; That would be kind of cool.\n\n180\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.250\n&gt;&gt; They go a lot further.\n\n181\n00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.170\nIf you've never thrown a bullet,\nyou should give it a try.\n\n182\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.840\nIt's a lot of fun, yeah.\n\n183\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll have to do that.\n\n184\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.640\nMaybe we'll go to the range one day and\nyou can show me how to throw a bullet,\n\n185\n00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.340\nthat would be really cool.\n\n186\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.320\n&gt;&gt; If you really want to\ntest your aiming skills.\n\n187\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't want to say cuz\nI know I'm good with a gun but\n\n188\n00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.090\nI don't know if I'm good at throwing.\n\n189\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.510\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I shoot like\nAntonio Banderas in El Mariachi.\n\n190\n00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.200\nI'm like pow pow, pow pow.\n\n191\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.940\n&gt;&gt; But you do it.\n\n192\n00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.900\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I'm throwing them.\n\n193\n00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n194\n00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.460\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n195\n00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.450\n&gt;&gt; I always see that on tv and the movies.\n\n196\n00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.460\n&gt;&gt; That's really ridiculous.\n\n197\n00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.980\n&gt;&gt; That's not even close to what\nyou do if you want to think about\n\n198\n00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.205\nhitting anything other\nthan the side of a barn.\n\n199\n00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:39.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And even then, that's suspect.\n\n200\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.680\n&gt;&gt; Just by accident because it ricocheted,\nnot because it actually meant to go there.\n\n201\n00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.680\nAll right, so let's go back into\n[LAUGH] what we were looking at.\n\n202\n00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.460\nGo back to our console here.\n\n203\n00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.250\nI just wanna show you and\nbring some of this stuff together.\n\n204\n00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.810\nWe've been creating the management pack.\n\n205\n00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.090\nWe've talked about how to create one.\n\n206\n00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.060\nYou see the one we created\nsitting right here.\n\n207\n00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.531\nWe talked about sealed\nversus unsealed last time.\n\n208\n00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:58.462\nWe went ahead and\nshowed you how to import,\n\n209\n00:07:58.462 --> 00:08:01.102\nhow to take those management pack items,\ndownload them.\n\n210\n00:08:01.102 --> 00:08:03.073\nShowed how to explode out the MSI.\n\n211\n00:08:03.073 --> 00:08:06.821\nGrab the .mpb files, bring them in.\n\n212\n00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:09.573\nHow to deal with a .xml file and\ninstall, or rather,\n\n213\n00:08:09.573 --> 00:08:12.660\nimport the unsealed versus\nsealed management packs.\n\n214\n00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.600\nWe talked about how to do all of that,\n\n215\n00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.047\ntalked about all\nthe different moving parts.\n\n216\n00:08:17.047 --> 00:08:20.453\nWhat I hinted at the last episode,\nwas hey we are gonna come back.\n\n217\n00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:24.357\nWe're gonna take a look at the authoring\nworkspace, which is right over here.\n\n218\n00:08:24.357 --> 00:08:25.585\nWe're gonna go there right now, and\n\n219\n00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:28.372\nwe're gonna show you the management pack\nobjects that we have been talking about.\n\n220\n00:08:28.372 --> 00:08:29.533\nJust show you where they live and\n\n221\n00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:31.527\nmake sure you understand how\nthey interact with them.\n\n222\n00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:35.746\nWe're gonna open this up right here and\nyou can see the attributes the monitors,\n\n223\n00:08:35.746 --> 00:08:38.555\nwe've got our object\ndiscovery methods overrides.\n\n224\n00:08:38.555 --> 00:08:41.960\nTalked that overrides, how we create\nthe unsealed management pack.\n\n225\n00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.380\nPut the overrides in there,\n\n226\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.940\napply them by joining them\ntogether with the management pack.\n\n227\n00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.347\nThat's sealed and\nthen generate a sense with the outcome.\n\n228\n00:08:48.347 --> 00:08:50.100\nSo we got that, we got rules, got tasks,\n\n229\n00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.825\nthese we've got all the things\nwe've been talking about here.\n\n230\n00:08:52.825 --> 00:08:56.706\nAnd so these are the moving parts\nthat we are creating and or using and\n\n231\n00:08:56.706 --> 00:09:01.070\nare interacting with In order to be\nable to customize the management pack.\n\n232\n00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.880\nRemember, if we're building our own,\nwe're a third party vendor,\n\n233\n00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.150\nwe're Microsoft, right?\n\n234\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.500\nWhoever we are,\n\n235\n00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.810\nwe're going through somewhere in the logic\nto build the management pack out.\n\n236\n00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.980\nNow there are management pack\nauthoring tools that can be used,\n\n237\n00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.990\nwe create them in\nthe consoles you've seen.\n\n238\n00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.360\nIn the upcoming episode where\nwe'll talk about creating and\n\n239\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.670\ncustomizing management packs we'll talk\nabout an alternate way something called\n\n240\n00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.850\nthe VSAE Video Studio Altering Extensions.\n\n241\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.590\nWhere you can download and actually add in\n\n242\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.360\nthey're essentially With templates\nthat can add an individual studio.\n\n243\n00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.050\nWe open the individual studio\nup under the new project area.\n\n244\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.595\nGot seven new templates that get\nstuffed in there so we can use theem.\n\n245\n00:09:37.595 --> 00:09:40.410\nThree for service manager, four for SCOM.\n\n246\n00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.273\nVarious versions of SCOM 2007R2,\n12, 12SP1, 12R2.\n\n247\n00:09:45.273 --> 00:09:46.246\nSo we have them all.\n\n248\n00:09:46.246 --> 00:09:50.307\nAnd we can then actually do our Madison\nPack authoring right inside a visual\n\n249\n00:09:50.307 --> 00:09:51.190\nstudio.\n\n250\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.991\nSo we do have options.\n\n251\n00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:54.541\nSo we can use different\napproaches to get this done.\n\n252\n00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:57.769\nSo just think about that when we're\ntalking about management packs and\n\n253\n00:09:57.769 --> 00:10:01.206\nhow we may actually come about or come on\nthem so to speak, and be able to bring\n\n254\n00:10:01.206 --> 00:10:05.000\nthem together in terms of what we're\ngonna do and how we're gonna do that.\n\n255\n00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000\nOne of the other interesting elements\nwe've gotta think about here, and\n\n256\n00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.090\nby the way,\njust while we're here real quick.\n\n257\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.400\nI meant to do this while I was here, we\nwould highlight any one of these elements.\n\n258\n00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.838\nDoesn't really matter what it is.\n\n259\n00:10:15.838 --> 00:10:18.630\nAnd depending on what we have,\nand this may take a moment.\n\n260\n00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.550\nWe do have a lot of views to load up.\n\n261\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:26.210\nBut we'll be able to right click and\nclick new and or create most things here.\n\n262\n00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.850\nAnd views is actually gonna take\na real long time so let's actually do\n\n263\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.810\nthe following, let's just do tasks,\ncuz tasks will be not so long.\n\n264\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.280\nWe don't have as many tasks.\n\n265\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.810\nBut you can see we have almost 5000 tasks.\n\n266\n00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.820\nWe have like, close to 13,000 views so\nthat's why it takes so long to load up.\n\n267\n00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.273\nBut you can see we can do,\ncreate a new task, or any of these things,\n\n268\n00:10:43.273 --> 00:10:44.662\nit doesn't really matter what it is.\n\n269\n00:10:44.662 --> 00:10:47.411\nAnd what I just wanted to\nshow you here quickly,\n\n270\n00:10:47.411 --> 00:10:51.260\nwith the create a whatever wizard,\nright, so, right over here,\n\n271\n00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.454\ncreate a task wizard is we select our\nmanagement pack down at the bottom,\n\n272\n00:10:55.454 --> 00:11:00.445\ncreate a new one, but we also can choose\nthe management pack that we've customized.\n\n273\n00:11:00.445 --> 00:11:03.312\nAnd you could see there I've\ngot the Adam ITProTV UN for\n\n274\n00:11:03.312 --> 00:11:06.373\nunsealed on that we've been just using and\nworking with.\n\n275\n00:11:06.373 --> 00:11:10.502\nAnd I can pull it out of the list and\nI can attach this task or\n\n276\n00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:14.230\nI can attach the monitor I\ncan attach the rules etc.\n\n277\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.330\nI can put those in the management pack,\ngathering them up as a I go and\n\n278\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:18.920\nadding them in.\n\n279\n00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.370\nSo when I export it,\n\n280\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.805\nas we showed you in the last episode,\nwe got that XML file if it's unsealed.\n\n281\n00:11:24.805 --> 00:11:28.517\nI've got all of the manifest information,\nall the object descriptions, so\n\n282\n00:11:28.517 --> 00:11:32.285\nthat when I import the Management Pack\nsomewhere else, it brings all that with\n\n283\n00:11:32.285 --> 00:11:35.850\nit and it configures the system so\nthat everything's set and ready to go.\n\n284\n00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.510\nSo we're attaching these items, right.\n\n285\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.790\nWe're attaching these objects to\nthe appropriate management pack as we're\n\n286\n00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.602\ncreating our own.\n\n287\n00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:47.320\nThis is the hidden secret, this is the\nmagic that we make happen under the hood\n\n288\n00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.380\nhere as we are dealing management packs,\nright.\n\n289\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.010\nSo we're just gonna exit out of this,\njust so you can see that,\n\n290\n00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.020\nwe're gonna go back\nover to Administration,\n\n291\n00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.470\nwe're gonna talk about another\nelement here that is very important.\n\n292\n00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.540\nLet me scroll down while we're doing that.\n\n293\n00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.910\nWe're gonna talk about\nour Run As configuration.\n\n294\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.660\nGonna take a look at accounts,\nand profiles, and\n\n295\n00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.090\nhow we link the two together.\n\n296\n00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.241\nRun As Accounts and\nRun As Profiles are very important for us.\n\n297\n00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:14.209\nThey let us run the different objects\nin the Management Pack, the rules,\n\n298\n00:12:14.209 --> 00:12:17.676\nthe tasks The monitors,\nthe discoveries whatever they may be.\n\n299\n00:12:17.676 --> 00:12:19.676\nThey let us put them all out there.\n\n300\n00:12:19.676 --> 00:12:23.405\nAnd run them under the appropriate\nuser account and profile,\n\n301\n00:12:23.405 --> 00:12:28.180\nthat gives them the rights so the right\nfocus to be able to then interact.\n\n302\n00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.940\nAnd so we're gonna be able to set up,\nin theory, a little privilege account.\n\n303\n00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.588\nSo we really constrain it,\ndon't give it full rights.\n\n304\n00:12:33.588 --> 00:12:36.790\nWe never wanna run something\nlike this with domain admin, or\n\n305\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.780\nlocal admin rights we can avoid it.\n\n306\n00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.324\nIt's because of the security implications,\nright?\n\n307\n00:12:40.324 --> 00:12:42.820\nNever a bad idea rather never a good idea.\n\n308\n00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.261\nIt's always a bad idea I meant to say.\n\n309\n00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:45.490\nSo we wanna try to do this.\n\n310\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.370\nSo paying attention to this part and\nreally figuring this out as we plan to\n\n311\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:54.600\ndeploy SCOM and go through the checklist\nitems we gotta configure and\n\n312\n00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.290\ncome up with ahead of time is gonna be\nan important element of what we do.\n\n313\n00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:02.220\nNow I've gone ahead and created a account\nfor us to use in the profile just to show\n\n314\n00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.240\nyou What we get, and we'll go in and\nwe'll do this ourselves here.\n\n315\n00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.730\nI've got AdamITProTV1, already created,\n\n316\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.340\nwe could clearly see it's not a typical\naccount that would show up there, right?\n\n317\n00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.540\nSo we know that one's been created.\n\n318\n00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.940\nAnd then under our profiles here, we'll\njust go here, right up the top I have\n\n319\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:24.390\nAdamITProTVprofile1 the run as profile is\ngonna be used to link the run as account.\n\n320\n00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.790\nTo then allow it or\nbind it to the objects and\n\n321\n00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.190\nthe activities that we\nwanna be able to use.\n\n322\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.936\nSo we're gonna configure these,\nand see how this works.\n\n323\n00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:34.739\nLet's start with the account.\n\n324\n00:13:34.739 --> 00:13:38.475\nGo in, we'll come here,\ndo a create run as account.\n\n325\n00:13:38.475 --> 00:13:41.448\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll just crank this out real quick,\n\n326\n00:13:41.448 --> 00:13:43.760\nwe'll hit Next in our overview screen.\n\n327\n00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.920\nNow we do have a bunch of\ndifferent run as account types,\n\n328\n00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.860\nI think there's seven of them\nIf I remember correctly.\n\n329\n00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.560\n2, 4, 6, 8 of them look at that,\nI was one off.\n\n330\n00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.522\nThat's not too bad though,\nconsidering I just totally guessed and\n\n331\n00:13:55.522 --> 00:13:56.494\nI had no idea what the number was.\n\n332\n00:13:56.494 --> 00:13:57.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.660\nI never remember all the numbers for\nall these different lists.\n\n334\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.000\nWe got so many different things going on.\n\n335\n00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.719\nBut it's in that ballpark, as you can see.\n\n336\n00:14:02.719 --> 00:14:06.320\nBut we do have Windows accounts,\nthat's one we're gonna use by the way.\n\n337\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.900\nBut we do have community strings\nan option here, basic authentication,\n\n338\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:15.830\nsimple authentication, digest,\nbinary, action, and SNMPB3 account.\n\n339\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.830\nAny one or all of these\nare gonna be able to be used and\n\n340\n00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.600\nwe've got some information in the show\nnotes for you about these things.\n\n341\n00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.680\nThe Windows account clearly,\nWindows credential.\n\n342\n00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.580\nWe're gonna use that\nright now to create one.\n\n343\n00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.717\nCommunity string,\nis actually the SNMPV2 account.\n\n344\n00:14:29.717 --> 00:14:32.154\nSo if we're gonna be using\nnetwork discovery and\n\n345\n00:14:32.154 --> 00:14:34.709\nwe'll talk about this a little bit and\nyou wanna use\n\n346\n00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:38.871\nSNMP Simple Network Management Protocol\nversion 2 then you need to use a community\n\n347\n00:14:38.871 --> 00:14:42.334\nstring account because then you'll\nprovide the community string.\n\n348\n00:14:42.334 --> 00:14:45.320\nWhatever that is, public,\nprivate, whatever the case may be.\n\n349\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.650\nBasic authentication,\nbasic web base authentication so\n\n350\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.100\nstandard basic web authentication\nsimple authentication.\n\n351\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.611\nJust username and password nothing special\nthere, digest authentication again\n\n352\n00:14:57.611 --> 00:15:01.076\nstandard digest web authentication\nbinary authentication,\n\n353\n00:15:01.076 --> 00:15:03.184\nthat's a way of saying user defined.\n\n354\n00:15:03.184 --> 00:15:07.540\nSo you define the authentication whatever\nyou're gonna be doing, action account is\n\n355\n00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.786\nthe Windows credential that's assigned and\nused for the action account profile.\n\n356\n00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:15.575\nAnd then the SNMPV three account,\nthat's used for discovering and for\n\n357\n00:15:15.575 --> 00:15:19.000\ndealing with SNMP devices using\nversion three of the protocol.\n\n358\n00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.510\nSo we just have to make some choices\nthere based on what it is we wanna do.\n\n359\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.370\nWe're gonna choose a Windows account.\n\n360\n00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.989\nWe're gonna give it a display name.\n\n361\n00:15:25.989 --> 00:15:28.660\nI'll choose,\nlet's put Daniel in there this time.\n\n362\n00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:33.266\nWe did Adam last time so\nwe'll do Daniel, ITPro TV, and\n\n363\n00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:38.080\nDaniel you're gonna be number two,\njust so that we know.\n\n364\n00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.881\nSo, we'll do that, we'll click Next,\nusername and password, very simple, so\n\n365\n00:15:42.881 --> 00:15:46.260\nwe'll go ahead,\nI'll just use the guest account there.\n\n366\n00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.790\nYou can use any account you'd like.\n\n367\n00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.154\nPlease, by the way, in the real\nworld do not use the guest account.\n\n368\n00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:53.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was using that merely for\n\n369\n00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.720\ndemonstration purposes, okay?\n\n370\n00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.436\nIn the real world that would be\nalmost as bad as using the domain\n\n371\n00:15:57.436 --> 00:15:58.541\nadmin account, right?\n\n372\n00:15:58.541 --> 00:15:59.625\nDon't wanna do that.\n\n373\n00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.461\n&gt;&gt; Because the people are like I thought\nhe was an expert at this that's wrong.\n\n374\n00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:03.360\nNo, that's [INAUDIBLE].\n\n375\n00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.274\nYou shouldn't use that\nguest account there, Adam.\n\n376\n00:16:05.274 --> 00:16:07.343\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is gonna be disabled by\n\n377\n00:16:07.343 --> 00:16:08.058\ndefault first of all.\n\n378\n00:16:08.058 --> 00:16:11.191\nSo it wouldn't work, but\nmore importantly if you did use it,\n\n379\n00:16:11.191 --> 00:16:13.920\nyou did enable it,\nit does have very limited rights.\n\n380\n00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.820\nWouldn't necessarily be a bad thing,\nbut it's anonymous access account.\n\n381\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.890\nYou don't wanna use that,\n\n382\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.230\nbecause you're gonna have all\nsorts of people jumping in there.\n\n383\n00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.450\nThis is not a good idea.\n\n384\n00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.250\nUsing it merely for demonstration purposes\njust because we know there is an account,\n\n385\n00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.880\nthere in the domain.\n\n386\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.780\nIt is called guess,\n\n387\n00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.660\nwe can authenticate real quickly,\ncheck to make sure it's valid.\n\n388\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.920\nAnd it will always come back and work.\n\n389\n00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.950\nJust like admin,\nthe administrator account, always works.\n\n390\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.232\nBut, just give a little variety here,\nokay?\n\n391\n00:16:36.232 --> 00:16:37.440\nDo a little switch up.\n\n392\n00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.200\nSo we got that.\n\n393\n00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.440\nNow, do wanna spend a minute.\n\n394\n00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.032\nLet's go to full screen, I wanna talk\nabout this, I want you to see this.\n\n395\n00:16:42.032 --> 00:16:46.256\nDo you wanna talk about the difference\nhere with the selected distributions\n\n396\n00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.898\nsecurity option between less and\nmore secure.\n\n397\n00:16:48.898 --> 00:16:53.192\nAnd this is an important thought process,\none that we just have to think about,\n\n398\n00:16:53.192 --> 00:16:55.400\nmake sure we are comfortable with.\n\n399\n00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.390\nNow, we have an understanding of it.\n\n400\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.270\nI'm gonna show you this in real time\nas we finish up creating the account,\n\n401\n00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.270\ndo the profile, and\nthen I have to link the two.\n\n402\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.000\nSo we're gonna get a prompt at the end\nof that second wizard that says, hey,\n\n403\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.770\nby the way,\ndepending on the choice you made.\n\n404\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:12.000\nYou gotta go and finnish configuring to\ndo the manual thing with more secure or\n\n405\n00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.400\na less secure,\nwe're automating the delivery for you.\n\n406\n00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.730\nI will distribute those accounts.\n\n407\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.000\nLet's talk about this.\n\n408\n00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.895\nSelect the distribution security\noption for this run as account,\n\n409\n00:17:19.895 --> 00:17:21.764\nremember we are creating run as accounts.\n\n410\n00:17:21.764 --> 00:17:25.893\nIf we do less secure, I want the\ncredential to be distributed automatically\n\n411\n00:17:25.893 --> 00:17:30.023\nto all managed computers, what this\nmeans is that SCOM will distribute this\n\n412\n00:17:30.023 --> 00:17:31.973\naccount automatically out for us.\n\n413\n00:17:31.973 --> 00:17:35.148\nAnd we don't have to worry about\nspecifying manually which computers\n\n414\n00:17:35.148 --> 00:17:39.055\nare gonna be able to get this account,\nand which ones it will be used with.\n\n415\n00:17:39.055 --> 00:17:40.545\nIf we are doing more secure, and\n\n416\n00:17:40.545 --> 00:17:43.610\nyou will see by the way\nthe default option, more secure,\n\n417\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.940\nI wanna manually select the computers to\nwhich the credential will be distributed.\n\n418\n00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:51.640\nWe'll be prompted at the end of the second\nwizard run when we do our run has profile.\n\n419\n00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.080\nWe'll see the last screen.\n\n420\n00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.010\nIt's got a little caution flag\nnext to the user account.\n\n421\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.300\nHey by the way, you've got to tell\nus where you want this thing to go,\n\n422\n00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.530\nwe've got to click through it and\nthen actually change it.\n\n423\n00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.190\nSo I'm going to leave it,\nhave more secure just so you can see that,\n\n424\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.150\nand then when we go in and change it\nwe're actually going to get a prompt\n\n425\n00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.450\nto come right back to this\nscreen believe it or not.\n\n426\n00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:11.490\nNot on the wizard, but just this screen.\n\n427\n00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.210\nAnd then, we'll change it to less secure.\n\n428\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.380\nIt'll change to the green check and\nwill automatically deploy that for us.\n\n429\n00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.860\nBut, I want you to see this and\njust understand the difference.\n\n430\n00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.640\nBetween these two options.\n\n431\n00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.660\nVery, very important\nto be able to do that.\n\n432\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.790\nSo we'll leave it at more secure here.,\njust so we'll click create.\n\n433\n00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.780\nGive that a moment.\n\n434\n00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.810\nNow you'll see here,\nyou successfully created.\n\n435\n00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.400\nThis is not the warning\nI was talking about.\n\n436\n00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.948\nIt's just reminding us of that.\n\n437\n00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:37.570\nBut we're gonna have to actually\ndeal with it in the next wizard,\n\n438\n00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.330\nat the end of the profile wizard.\n\n439\n00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.300\nSo we're gonna see it there.\n\n440\n00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.460\nSo we're gonna acknowledge it.\n\n441\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.060\nJust click close, we're good.\n\n442\n00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.570\nWe got our account right there.\n\n443\n00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:45.620\nThere's Daniel's account.\n\n444\n00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.453\nNow, what we're gonna do is come\ndown here, go to our profiles area.\n\n445\n00:18:49.453 --> 00:18:53.740\nNow, we have to create a profile, and\nbind the account and the profile together.\n\n446\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.040\nSo that way, we actually have stuff to do.\n\n447\n00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.520\nSo same thing, we're gonna right click\nProfile, create Run As Profile And\n\n448\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.000\nwe got a little instructory screen.\n\n449\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.150\nWe'll click next there.\n\n450\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:04.450\nGot to give it a name.\n\n451\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:10.210\nSo we'll name it for Daniel ITProTV\n\n452\n00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:15.520\n2, so we'll give it the same\nname as the profile account.\n\n453\n00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.510\nYou'll see here we now select\nthe destination Madison pack.\n\n454\n00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.670\nWhat Madison pack do we wanna\nassociate this profile with?\n\n455\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.320\nIn other words, what are we gonna tell it,\n\n456\n00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.250\nit has the tools necessarily do its job,\nright?\n\n457\n00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.880\nIt's with management package.\n\n458\n00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.990\nWhat kind of tools?\n\n459\n00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:31.510\nWhat kind of tool that we get?\n\n460\n00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:37.390\nSo it's gonna be like,\nwhat's the brand of Sirius house?\n\n461\n00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:38.210\n&gt;&gt; Craftsman.\n&gt;&gt; There you go,\n\n462\n00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.270\nit's gonna be like a Craftsman tool set or\ntool belt rather.\n\n463\n00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.260\nOr is it gonna be like,\nI know, maybe Milwaukee, right?\n\n464\n00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.861\nIt is a good one, or\nis it gonna be DeWalt, right?\n\n465\n00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:47.480\nThat's another good one?\n\n466\n00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.220\n&gt;&gt; We do like DeWalt.\n\n467\n00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do like DeWalt.\n\n468\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.547\nActually, Sears is talking about having\nto sell off their brands because they're\n\n469\n00:19:51.547 --> 00:19:52.531\nin such horrible financial shape.\n\n470\n00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:53.450\n&gt;&gt; I did not know that.\n\n471\n00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:54.570\n&gt;&gt; They're actually thinking about\nselling off Craftsman, yeah.\n\n472\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.120\n&gt;&gt; That's a shame.\n\n473\n00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.660\nThat's like an American icon, yeah.\n\n474\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.643\n&gt;&gt; That's is like, and\n\n475\n00:19:58.643 --> 00:20:02.810\nthey're just in such bad financial straits\nthat's what they're talking about doing.\n\n476\n00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:07.150\nAll right, Adam ITProTV on which is that\nmanagement pack, so we'll bind it here.\n\n477\n00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.205\nSo, let's grab that one.\n\n478\n00:20:08.205 --> 00:20:10.742\nWe'll make our choice,\nand we just do that click,\n\n479\n00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.680\ncuz you know the first click never-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n480\n00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.910\n&gt;&gt; Is as good as the second one.\n\n481\n00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:18.670\n[LAUGH] We'll click next, and then this\nis where we bring the runas account in.\n\n482\n00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.890\nWe just, remember, created it.\n\n483\n00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.450\nNow we're gonna go out,\nwe're gonna grab Daniel's account.\n\n484\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.660\nWe're gonna add that in here.\n\n485\n00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.800\nLet's go grab that.\n\n486\n00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.740\nDo a run as account.\n\n487\n00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.990\nNotice we have all the accounts here or\nwe could create a new one, right?\n\n488\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.150\nThe run as account will be used to manage\na following objects, any and all targeted\n\n489\n00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.850\nobjects, or we could sub divide,\nthis is going and say, you know what?\n\n490\n00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:41.210\nI just wanna use these for\nthese kind of computers,\n\n491\n00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:45.240\nmaybe to SQL 2012 Databases and\nthat's all Daniel's account.\n\n492\n00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.910\nHe's gonna be able to use or\nbe used for, nothing else.\n\n493\n00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.390\nThat'll be up to us to decide.\n\n494\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.090\nWe'll just leave it at all\ntargeted right now, click OK.\n\n495\n00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.480\nWe got that here.\n\n496\n00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.002\nNow, we're about to see on completion that\nwarning I was telling you about on that\n\n497\n00:20:57.002 --> 00:20:59.159\nprompt to go out and\nconfigure the distribution.\n\n498\n00:20:59.159 --> 00:21:03.100\nSo that it's either gonna be manual,\nhit the list and tell me what machines.\n\n499\n00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.640\nOr less secure, right,\ncuz more secure is manual,\n\n500\n00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.220\nless secure just automatically\ndistributed for me.\n\n501\n00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.130\nSo let's take a look, we'll click Create,\ngive that just a second.\n\n502\n00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.870\nAnd as soon as we get that done,\n\n503\n00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.400\nwhat we'll get is that screen\nthat I was talking about.\n\n504\n00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.730\nAnd we're gonna get that\ncompletion prompt, and\n\n505\n00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.860\nthen we're going to have to\ndecide how to handle that.\n\n506\n00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.704\nSo, we'll wait just\na moment to do it's thing.\n\n507\n00:21:25.704 --> 00:21:27.300\nIt should be finishing up right now.\n\n508\n00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.976\n&gt;&gt; As Michael says, the spinning Cheerio.\n\n509\n00:21:29.976 --> 00:21:31.860\n&gt;&gt; That's a good one.\n\n510\n00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.926\nIf it was for St. Patty's Day, it's green.\n\n511\n00:21:33.926 --> 00:21:35.490\n&gt;&gt; It's green, yeah.\n\n512\n00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.330\n&gt;&gt; So,\nnow you see we have our objects selected\n\n513\n00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.880\nmay not be monitored right because we\nhaven't distributed the credentials.\n\n514\n00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.600\nMore secure run as accounts, and\n\n515\n00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.860\nthat's that little caution\nflag I was talking about.\n\n516\n00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.900\nSo we're gonna click right here,\nif you see that,\n\n517\n00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.240\nit's gonna bring up the property window,\nright?\n\n518\n00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.130\nAnd we're gonna be on\nthat distribution screen.\n\n519\n00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.690\nNow, if it was still gonna be\nmore secure manual Click add.\n\n520\n00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:57.700\nWe gotta go in.\n\n521\n00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.260\nWe gotta search,\nfind whatever machines we wanna choose.\n\n522\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.610\nHighlight, choose add, right.\n\n523\n00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:04.810\nChoose okay.\n\n524\n00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.630\nThat's gonna distribute only to that, and\n\n525\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.230\nthen you'll have a list\nof manager servers.\n\n526\n00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.830\nIf we chose less secure,\n\n527\n00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.720\nwhich we could do as well, this would\nautomatically be distributed out for us.\n\n528\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.220\nEither way, right.\n\n529\n00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.310\nLet's just cancel out of that.\n\n530\n00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.488\nCome back here one more time,\ndo it the right way.\n\n531\n00:22:20.488 --> 00:22:24.310\nLet's just go in,\nlet's do less secure just so we know.\n\n532\n00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.041\nHit apply.\n\n533\n00:22:25.041 --> 00:22:26.090\nHit OK.\n\n534\n00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.130\nSee we got the green check here now.\n\n535\n00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.560\nSo now that we click, let's get that\nauto-hide out of the way there.\n\n536\n00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.780\nClick close, we've got that done.\n\n537\n00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.890\nOur Daniel ITProTV profile\nsitting right down there.\n\n538\n00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.380\nAnd so,\nthat's how we take that run as account.\n\n539\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.890\nLink it back to the profile, right?\n\n540\n00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:43.890\nSo, we have the run as account.\n\n541\n00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.240\nWe have the run as profile.\n\n542\n00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.080\nWe configure those.\n\n543\n00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.120\nAnd then,\nwe've got all the moving parts we need.\n\n544\n00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.470\nAnd the piece is put together.\n\n545\n00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:51.480\nNow, we still have a couple of things.\n\n546\n00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.990\nI did show you override.\n\n547\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.750\nShowed you the console task.\n\n548\n00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.380\nShow you how all those\nother things come together.\n\n549\n00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.700\nJust want to remind you of them.\n\n550\n00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.760\nIn the option area, or not the option\narea rather the object area for\n\n551\n00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.070\nmonitoring with management\npacks that we looked at.\n\n552\n00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.670\nThey're all sitting right\nhere as management objects.\n\n553\n00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.480\nBut, I specified that we would\ntalk a little bit about them.\n\n554\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.880\nWhat I have here I just wanted show you\nwas how to override, if you need to create\n\n555\n00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.460\nan override, got a little primer and\nhow to go through and do that.\n\n556\n00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.820\nWe can right click,\nessentially create override and\n\n557\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.800\nthen attach them to a management pack\nprogram in all the different objects.\n\n558\n00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.970\nTell us how we want them to work.\n\n559\n00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.470\nSo, gotta a little primer\non how to do that here.\n\n560\n00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.350\nGot a primer on tasks, that's just\nshowing you how to create a task.\n\n561\n00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.600\nSo we just went in,\ntook a look at that one, right?\n\n562\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.030\nWe could see that.\n\n563\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.930\nSo, we have all those different things.\n\n564\n00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.640\nAnd let's go in here real quick,\nsince we're here for overrides.\n\n565\n00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.600\nJust take a look at\noverrides while we're here.\n\n566\n00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.290\nWe'll give that just a minute.\n\n567\n00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.715\nWe can go ahead.\n\n568\n00:23:45.715 --> 00:23:46.810\nRight-Click here.\n\n569\n00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.490\nLet's just come in here,\nrefresh, got that.\n\n570\n00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:52.407\nAnd let's go in here.\n\n571\n00:23:52.407 --> 00:23:53.745\nLet's just say this one.\n\n572\n00:23:53.745 --> 00:23:56.601\nYou'll see we have an override here.\n\n573\n00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:59.383\nWe can just bring this override up and\nsee what it looks like.\n\n574\n00:23:59.383 --> 00:24:03.775\nAnd you'll see the override is gonna give\nus a matrix of all the different settings.\n\n575\n00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:07.475\nAssociated with whatever the management\npack configuration looks like.\n\n576\n00:24:07.475 --> 00:24:11.970\nAnd then we can go in and we can,\nyou see it's got to be assigned.\n\n577\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:15.050\nWe can then decide to edit this and\nmake changes to it if we want to.\n\n578\n00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.820\nSo this is how we actually\nprogram in an override.\n\n579\n00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.780\nSo let's go over here real quick.\n\n580\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.078\nAnd let's do the Follow and\nwhere are we at?\n\n581\n00:24:25.078 --> 00:24:28.800\n[SOUND] Just come over here.\n\n582\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.252\nAnd where are we at over here?\n\n583\n00:24:31.252 --> 00:24:33.404\nLet's come over here real quick.\n\n584\n00:24:33.404 --> 00:24:38.461\nAnd got our management pack right here,\nright?\n\n585\n00:24:38.461 --> 00:24:41.015\nAnd remember, we went in,\nwe took a look at our management pack.\n\n586\n00:24:41.015 --> 00:24:42.005\nCreated it.\n\n587\n00:24:42.005 --> 00:24:44.741\nIf you go back and\nremember, all we see here,\n\n588\n00:24:44.741 --> 00:24:49.063\nwith our management pack is just\nthe name convention, whatever it is.\n\n589\n00:24:49.063 --> 00:24:51.024\nIf we had any knowledge we would see that.\n\n590\n00:24:51.024 --> 00:24:54.293\nWe do see dependencies, what management\npacks are dependent on this, or\n\n591\n00:24:54.293 --> 00:24:55.307\nwe're dependent on.\n\n592\n00:24:55.307 --> 00:24:58.247\nIn other words,\nwhat are the linkages behind the scenes,\n\n593\n00:24:58.247 --> 00:25:01.790\nthe base classes that were bound to,\nor that were referenced by.\n\n594\n00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.290\nBut notice nowhere here do\nwe see the objects, right?\n\n595\n00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:05.750\nNo overrides, nothing like that.\n\n596\n00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.340\nWe just see the other management packs.\n\n597\n00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.550\nThe management pack, remember,\nis just a container.\n\n598\n00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.160\nNothing more.\n\n599\n00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.870\nLet's look at one that's sealed.\n\n600\n00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:17.390\nRight here we'll see the dependency here,\nwe can see we do have a fair number here.\n\n601\n00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.480\nWe have a number that\nwe're depending on and\n\n602\n00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.230\na number that are going to\nbe referenced by us, right?\n\n603\n00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.214\nSo we depend on some, some depend on us.\n\n604\n00:25:25.214 --> 00:25:28.944\nBut these are just showing us the other\nmanagement packs we're involved with or\n\n605\n00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:30.290\ninteracting with, right.\n\n606\n00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:35.370\nSo most of the work we do around\nmanagement packs almost without exception.\n\n607\n00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.990\nIt's gonna be done over\nhere in the authoring area.\n\n608\n00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:41.610\nWe're interacting with all the objects and\nwe're gonna go in and\n\n609\n00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:46.170\nwe're gonna use those objects to\ndrive management pack creation.\n\n610\n00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:50.590\nAnd or we have our management\npack templates up here as well.\n\n611\n00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:55.310\nWhere we can come in,\nwe can add a monitoring wizard and\n\n612\n00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:59.770\nwe can use one of these templates to\nthen go in and create a monitor, and\n\n613\n00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.642\nwe can decide how we're gonna use this.\n\n614\n00:26:01.642 --> 00:26:04.630\nWe're gonna take a look at this in\nsome upcoming episodes when we do\n\n615\n00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.850\napplication monitoring for instance.\n\n616\n00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.950\nAnd we're gonna go in and do,\nwhether it's a .NET performance monitor or\n\n617\n00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:14.900\nperhaps a web app availability monitor,\nyeah we're gonna go in and\n\n618\n00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.426\nsample some of these,\nactually walk through some demos on them.\n\n619\n00:26:17.426 --> 00:26:20.850\nWe're gonna use pre-made management pack\ntemplates that are gonna have some stuff\n\n620\n00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.950\nalready configured, and we're gonna be\nable to bring those objects together and\n\n621\n00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:24.910\nuse them in that way.\n\n622\n00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:28.770\nSo we got a lot of different options here,\nright, depending on what we're doing.\n\n623\n00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.040\nSo we're gonna be in and\n\n624\n00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.638\nout of this console doing a lot\nof this stuff on a regular basis.\n\n625\n00:26:33.638 --> 00:26:35.210\nJust wanted to point that out to you,\n\n626\n00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:39.430\nmake sure we're thinking about how all\nof this is gonna come together and\n\n627\n00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.660\nthat we see that all of these moving\nparts, all of the different objects\n\n628\n00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.340\nassociated with the management pack\nare very important, because we have to set\n\n629\n00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.680\nthese up in order to be able to make sure\nthat they're being used the right way.\n\n630\n00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.170\nSo we get the right monitoring.\n\n631\n00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:56.610\nThe other piece that this is impacted by\nand connected to is the reporting piece,\n\n632\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.400\nbecause the reports are built on\nthe information that we gather\n\n633\n00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.830\nfrom the use of the management\npacks as we're monitoring.\n\n634\n00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.980\nAnd then that information is gonna be\npulled out of the data warehouse database\n\n635\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.460\nand through the reporting services,\n\n636\n00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.500\nthe SSRS instance,\nwe're then gonna be able to show data or\n\n637\n00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.060\nreport on it based on dashboards and\nviews and whatever it is we may be doing.\n\n638\n00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.010\nAnd so it's important for us to see how\nall of these things are coming together\n\n639\n00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.970\naround the management pack.\n\n640\n00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.140\nAnd let me just go and\ntake a quick look at one report and\n\n641\n00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.500\njust see what may be of interest here.\n\n642\n00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.890\nI'm gonna just scroll down a little bit.\n\n643\n00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:30.900\nAnd where is it at?\n\n644\n00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.610\nSystem Center, Core Monitoring Reports.\n\n645\n00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.359\nLet's take a look at this one.\n\n646\n00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:40.714\nAnd let's see, let us do the following,\n\n647\n00:27:40.714 --> 00:27:46.071\nlet me think about this for just a moment.\n\n648\n00:27:46.071 --> 00:27:52.324\nLet's do data volume, yeah,\nlet's do Data Volume by Management Pack.\n\n649\n00:27:52.324 --> 00:27:54.191\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nwe'll open that up real quick.\n\n650\n00:27:54.191 --> 00:27:56.514\nJust a standard report, nothing too fancy.\n\n651\n00:27:56.514 --> 00:28:00.630\nYou'll see here reports,\nand creation reports.\n\n652\n00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.134\nWe will talk about this in\nsome upcoming episodes.\n\n653\n00:28:03.134 --> 00:28:08.470\nBut we're gonna take a look at the\nreporting interface, how to use reports.\n\n654\n00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.130\nThere is a tool called Report Design or\n\n655\n00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.660\nReport Builder, that you can use\nto be able to build reports.\n\n656\n00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.300\nYou can build them in\nVisual Studio as well.\n\n657\n00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.870\nThey're based on, or the back end on\nsecret server reporting services but\n\n658\n00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:19.994\nthis is just a wire frame,\n\n659\n00:28:19.994 --> 00:28:23.240\nessentially a forum that we use to\nbe able to build the report out.\n\n660\n00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.150\nWe make the appropriate choices here.\n\n661\n00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:27.250\nWe see if we've got\na bunch of stuff selected.\n\n662\n00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:33.880\nWe have to specify the time Interface,\nfrom today to today is not gonna work.\n\n663\n00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.590\nSo, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll just back this off here.\n\n664\n00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:37.710\nJust click here.\n\n665\n00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.630\nIt'd be nice if it just actually clicked.\n\n666\n00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:42.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I need like Siri voice control\n\n667\n00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:43.230\nfor this right?\n\n668\n00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.870\nSo we have this, put our time zone in,,\naggregate daily?\n\n669\n00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.470\nWhat data types do we want?\n\n670\n00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:48.490\nWhat's the management group?\n\n671\n00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.560\nWe have our management group.\n\n672\n00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.221\nWhat management packs are all selected.\n\n673\n00:28:51.221 --> 00:28:56.245\nAnd when we click Run, what this does\nis this goes out to the data warehouse.\n\n674\n00:28:56.245 --> 00:29:00.717\nAnd what we're doing right now, just while\nwe're waiting on that on the back end.\n\n675\n00:29:00.717 --> 00:29:02.089\nWhat we're doing essentially,\n\n676\n00:29:02.089 --> 00:29:05.700\nis from the console right here we're\ngenerating information on the report form.\n\n677\n00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.480\nWe're launching it,\nwe're going to the report server.\n\n678\n00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.830\nReport server then executes a query or\n\n679\n00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:13.500\nseries of queries against\nthe data warehouse database.\n\n680\n00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.720\nBringing that information back and\nultimately displaying it for\n\n681\n00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.520\nus in the Ops console.\n\n682\n00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.620\nSo that's or the web console depending\non where we are, what we're doing.\n\n683\n00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.960\nAnd you can see here when we load this up.\n\n684\n00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.660\nWe can go full screen.\n\n685\n00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.110\nWe can see a little bit of\nthe detail here real quick.\n\n686\n00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:29.570\nWe've got, and again, we're running\nthis in just a demo environment.\n\n687\n00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.760\nWe are not really doing any\nheavy duty monitoring right now.\n\n688\n00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.150\nWe're just in and out of certain features,\njust showing you stuff.\n\n689\n00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:36.290\nSo there's a limited amount\nof data in the database,\n\n690\n00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:40.770\nbut even then we do have information\non the different management packs.\n\n691\n00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.320\nWe can see percent of total\nin terms of data volume.\n\n692\n00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.080\nHow much each management\npack is taking up.\n\n693\n00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.940\nAnd the largest one is\nthe health library there.\n\n694\n00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.800\nNot very big but it's using\nthe largest amount of data overall.\n\n695\n00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.790\nIt's got 106 state changes\nthat have taken place,\n\n696\n00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.970\nwhereas most of the others are very small.\n\n697\n00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.490\nThe System Center Core Library\nis right up there,\n\n698\n00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.670\nabout half the size overall\nthe number of state changes.\n\n699\n00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.664\nBut we could go in, and we can click\nthrough, let just pull down here so\n\n700\n00:30:07.664 --> 00:30:10.466\nyou can see some of this\nbefore we click through.\n\n701\n00:30:10.466 --> 00:30:15.002\nBut we do have these nice graphs below\nthat are gonna show us the actual data\n\n702\n00:30:15.002 --> 00:30:19.538\ncount, the discovery data submitted\nby date, generated alerts by day,\n\n703\n00:30:19.538 --> 00:30:20.725\nthat kinda thing.\n\n704\n00:30:20.725 --> 00:30:24.721\nSo we could see that graphic and if we had\nmore data and we did a larger time span\n\n705\n00:30:24.721 --> 00:30:28.980\nother than a single day, we'd also have\na more impressive set of visuals there.\n\n706\n00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:34.350\nIt's fairly limited overall, but we can\nclick through on the health library.\n\n707\n00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.350\nJust click on that one management pack.\n\n708\n00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.990\nIt'll then take as down and\n\n709\n00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:43.140\nshow us specific information on this\nparticular instance within the report.\n\n710\n00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.210\nSo we can drill down here,\nget more information.\n\n711\n00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.120\nWhether or\nnot there's data in this one instance,\n\n712\n00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.840\nthat we would see charted,\nobviously depends, right.\n\n713\n00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.100\nBut in general you could see,\nwe could drill in.\n\n714\n00:30:53.100 --> 00:31:00.780\nWe could Continue to drill down,\ngive that just a second.\n\n715\n00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.580\nAnd if we drill through here,\n\n716\n00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:09.710\njust on the number of the actual\nstate changes that occurred,\n\n717\n00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.540\nwe can see they're broken out,\nand they're broken out by type.\n\n718\n00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.260\nEntity health, availability,\nconfig performance, count for\n\n719\n00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.970\neach, percentage of data\nvolume total is listed here.\n\n720\n00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:23.050\nWe get that charted, so\nwe can actually see that.\n\n721\n00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:27.210\nAnd we see an actual instance by\nclass of all the different counts.\n\n722\n00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.967\nI mean this is detail reporting,\n\n723\n00:31:28.967 --> 00:31:31.870\nthis is just an out of the box\nreport by the way right?.\n\n724\n00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.190\nThis is not one, we would create and\ncustomize on our own.\n\n725\n00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:39.400\nBut rather simply, an out of the box\ninstance of the reports that are generated\n\n726\n00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.330\nand created as part of the importation\nof the standard management packs.\n\n727\n00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.450\nRemember reports are part\nof management packs,\n\n728\n00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.950\nthey come in as part of\nthe association when we import them.\n\n729\n00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:49.950\nAnd as a result,\n\n730\n00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.660\nwe're getting this detailed data\ncoming back from the data warehouse.\n\n731\n00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.555\nAll we have to do is be smart enough\nto figure out what reports are there,\n\n732\n00:31:56.555 --> 00:31:58.198\nunderstand how they can be leveraged and\n\n733\n00:31:58.198 --> 00:32:00.002\nwe can get this kind\nof detailed reporting.\n\n734\n00:32:00.002 --> 00:32:03.734\nAnd if we need to customize,\nwe can go ahead and customize reports,\n\n735\n00:32:03.734 --> 00:32:07.935\ncreate our own queries, our own data\nsources, link to the various tables.\n\n736\n00:32:07.935 --> 00:32:11.297\nAs long as we have a little bit\nof background with the design and\n\n737\n00:32:11.297 --> 00:32:15.565\nthe layout and we understand the SQL query\nlanguage for the SQL structure query\n\n738\n00:32:15.565 --> 00:32:19.980\nlanguage that we would be using, we could\ndo just about anything we wanted here.\n\n739\n00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:20.859\nSo this is a very,\n\n740\n00:32:20.859 --> 00:32:24.205\nvery powerful element of the management\npack that we also wanna make\n\n741\n00:32:24.205 --> 00:32:28.290\nsure we're aware of and we're thinking\nabout as part of this conversation.\n\n742\n00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:32.092\n&gt;&gt; Definitely a fairly robust monitoring\nsystem that we've built in here,\n\n743\n00:32:32.092 --> 00:32:35.598\ninteresting stuff, we can dive into\nthat very deeply if we need to.\n\n744\n00:32:35.598 --> 00:32:40.621\nAnd speaking of deep dives, guess what,\nwe are at the end of time for\n\n745\n00:32:40.621 --> 00:32:45.577\nthis episode and we're well out of\nO2 when it comes for this show.\n\n746\n00:32:45.577 --> 00:32:48.306\nSo we'll have to roll this into a part 3,\ncontinue this conversation and\n\n747\n00:32:48.306 --> 00:32:50.033\nthen we got a couple more\nthings to talk about.\n\n748\n00:32:50.033 --> 00:32:52.382\nIn this regards,\nmove onto fabric as well so\n\n749\n00:32:52.382 --> 00:32:55.370\nthat will definitely be\nan interesting conversation.\n\n750\n00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:56.890\nYou should totally come back for that.\n\n751\n00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:01.000\nAdam, we thank you for getting us here so\nfar, now it's time to refill the tanks,\n\n752\n00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.350\nrecharge the batteries.\n\n753\n00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.280\nAnd come back for that part 3 and\nsee the rest of it.\n\n754\n00:33:04.280 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.344\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:12.149\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:14.088\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.088 --> 00:00:16.960\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.030\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are coming back at you\n\n9\n00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.730\nwith more On our data center\nmonitoring with Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n10\n00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.510\nAnd just when you thought\nit was safe to go back\n\n11\n00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.880\ninto the monitoring of the fabric end,\nthe network applications, guess what?\n\n12\n00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.600\nWe're back for a more of a,\nsort of, part three.\n\n13\n00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.410\nAnd joining us on that part\nthree to round out the series,\n\n14\n00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.880\nthe mini-series inside the series,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n15\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.450\nAdam, welcome back, man.\n\n16\n00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.400\nWhere are we going today?\n\n17\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm still trying to wrap my head around\n\n18\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.030\nthe series inside the series\ninside the series.\n\n19\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.130\n&gt;&gt; It's like a Russian doll.\n\n20\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.190\n&gt;&gt; It is, the dolls, those are awesome.\n\n21\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.980\nI actually have a set of political\ndolls from Russia from right before\n\n22\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.362\nthe wall came down.\n\n23\n00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:00.113\nThe Berlin Wall,\nthe dissolution of the Soviet Union, and\n\n24\n00:01:00.113 --> 00:01:02.510\nI have all the leaders going all the way\nback and all the way up through Gorbechov.\n\n25\n00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.373\n&gt;&gt; That's actually kind of cool.\n\n26\n00:01:04.373 --> 00:01:08.760\n&gt;&gt; Hand painted from Moscow, it's one\nof my thesis advisors when I was in\n\n27\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.370\nschool brought it back for me cuz he\nwas stationed over there for awhile.\n\n28\n00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.100\n&gt;&gt; How about that?\n\n29\n00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's actually.\n\n30\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.173\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; It's very, very cool.\n\n31\n00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:16.560\nSo anyway, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So what are we doing today?\n\n32\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.680\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; So what are we doing today?\n\n33\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just gonna say,\nwe're not here.\n\n34\n00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.440\nIt's like Antique Road Show.\n\n35\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.300\nWe're not here to do that.\n\n36\n00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.570\nWe are here, however,\nto continue talking as Daniel said,\n\n37\n00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.210\npart three cuz you know one and two were\njust not enough and strangely enough,\n\n38\n00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.680\nif you add one and\ntwo together, you get three.\n\n39\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.590\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n40\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.810\n&gt;&gt; That's how we got here\ncuz we took parts one and\n\n41\n00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.110\npart two, didn't have enough in there to\nfinish up and we added it together and\n\n42\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.820\nwe're about to add some knowledge\nto your heads as we see.\n\n43\n00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.480\nWe're gonna talk about monitoring,\nand device monitoring and discovery.\n\n44\n00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.060\nSpecifically network monitoring and\n\n45\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.950\nconfiguring that fabric Daniel keeps\nhinting at and talking about with SCVMM.\n\n46\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.450\nWe're just gonna talk\nthrough some of that.\n\n47\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.460\nWe've then got a series of episodes coming\nup right after this where we're gonna demo\n\n48\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.460\nsome of this for\nyou in a little bit more detail.\n\n49\n00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.750\nTake in through network discovery,\nshow you how that works, where to demo.\n\n50\n00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.980\nHow to set up and configure VMM and\nintegrate it so we have pro monitoring\n\n51\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.950\ntaking place and the SQL analysis and\nall that kinda stuff that we need.\n\n52\n00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.940\nSo we're gonna do some cool things for\nyou there.\n\n53\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.300\nBut first we're gonna talk\na bit more about monitoring.\n\n54\n00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.845\nSo when we think about\nmonitoring with SCOM,\n\n55\n00:02:17.845 --> 00:02:20.035\nwe've can talk a lot\nabout it in this setup.\n\n56\n00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:23.165\nSince we're talking about management\npacks, how we configured all that.\n\n57\n00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:26.245\nWe also could do discovery and\nfind network devices.\n\n58\n00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:28.545\nAnd this is one of the other\nthings that's kinda cool.\n\n59\n00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:33.457\nNetwork device monitoring allows us\nto go out and find using either SNMP,\n\n60\n00:02:33.457 --> 00:02:38.107\nSimple Network Management Protocol version\none, version two, and/or version three.\n\n61\n00:02:38.107 --> 00:02:40.737\nAnd includes the ability to be\nable to use both IPv4 and IPv6,\n\n62\n00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:46.097\nthe ability to be able to find devices\nfrom over 80 manufactures currently and\n\n63\n00:02:46.097 --> 00:02:49.527\neven more to come, so\ncontinue to evolve this product over time.\n\n64\n00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:53.910\nWe can discover using seven different\nviews and we can then go out and\n\n65\n00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.410\nfigure out what's out there.\n\n66\n00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.410\nAnd not just manager,\nnot just manage computers, but\n\n67\n00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.820\nalso manage network endpoints.\n\n68\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.025\nSo routers, switches, things like that\ncan be discovered and brought in as well.\n\n69\n00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:09.805\nWe extend the monitoring for\nprocess, for memory consumption.\n\n70\n00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:13.705\nSo we're looking at performance, and we're\nlooking at health as a result of that.\n\n71\n00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:16.555\nSo we have capabilities that\nare gonna go deep and wide there.\n\n72\n00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:19.235\nSo if we take a look over here for\njust a minute, what we'll see is,\n\n73\n00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:22.660\nwe do have a little primer on this for\nyou up on the web.\n\n74\n00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.510\nThank you to Microsoft, once again, for\n\n75\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.480\ndoing such a great job with getting all\nthe documentation out there for us.\n\n76\n00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.440\nWe got different network device\nviews that we wanna be aware of, and\n\n77\n00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.010\nI'm gonna show these to\nyou here in just a minute.\n\n78\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.365\nBut we talk about here, we've got\nthe host's view, legacy network devices.\n\n79\n00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:42.835\nWe've got router switches,\nDLANs, something called HSRP,\n\n80\n00:03:42.835 --> 00:03:47.575\nthe hot standby router protocol,\nCisco proprietary protocol,\n\n81\n00:03:47.575 --> 00:03:50.665\ngoing to have a little website up here\nI'll show you in just a sec which\n\n82\n00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:54.555\ngives you some detailed information\ndirect from Cisco on their protocol.\n\n83\n00:03:54.555 --> 00:03:57.535\nProbably important for you to read up\non that if you're not familiar with it.\n\n84\n00:03:57.535 --> 00:04:02.220\nEssentially a redundancy protocol that\nwe use for establishing gateways so\n\n85\n00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.580\nthat we can take a look at making\nsure everything stays up and\n\n86\n00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.540\nwe're able to communicate with it.\n\n87\n00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.670\nWe don't lose the interaction we need\nto be able to cross the gateway and\n\n88\n00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.120\nbe able to communicate with the device,\nimportant for us.\n\n89\n00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.840\nWe're up to,\n\n90\n00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.030\nif I'm not mistaken, version two of\nthe protocol if I remember correctly.\n\n91\n00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.390\nVersion one originally comes out\nthrough RFC, wanna say 2281 if\n\n92\n00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.915\nI remember correctly, and I know I'm\ncorrect cuz it's in my notes right there.\n\n93\n00:04:27.915 --> 00:04:28.637\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's right there.\n\n94\n00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:32.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But it's RFC 2281 that was\nthe original version of the protocol, and\n\n95\n00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.610\nwe have that ability to then\nbe able to set this up.\n\n96\n00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.690\nSo you probably wanna read up on that\njust a little bit, you'll be able to find\n\n97\n00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.680\nthat information here,\nI'll show it to you in just a second.\n\n98\n00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.000\nBut we've got this little primer here on\nall the different capabilities we use,\n\n99\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.220\nwe could scroll through and\nyou could see how to get this going.\n\n100\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.450\nWe do have some required management\npacks that have to be in place to drive\n\n101\n00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.180\nDiscovery.\n\n102\n00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.480\nWe've got\nthe Microsoft Windows Server Network and\n\n103\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.990\nClient Network Discover Management packs,\nwe've talked extensively about to get\n\n104\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.380\nthose, where you get the from,\nhow to import them, what to do with them.\n\n105\n00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.940\nSo now you have all of that information.\n\n106\n00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.260\nYou may wanna also bring in older versions\nof the operating system management packs\n\n107\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.420\nto support older deployments, Server 2003,\nServer 2008, Windows 7, Windows Vista.\n\n108\n00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.190\nNotice by the way, Windows XP,\nsuspiciously absent there.\n\n109\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.940\nNot suspiciously, because we no longer\nsupport it, but do keep that in mind.\n\n110\n00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.200\nBut yet, even though we don't support 2003\nanymore, cuz it also is out of warranty\n\n111\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.510\nas we say, no longer sport officially,\nand it's still on the active list because\n\n112\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.560\nthere's still so much of that deployed\nin the server stacks, just so you know.\n\n113\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.020\nThat is still there for the moment.\n\n114\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.280\nHowever, moving forward,\n\n115\n00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.290\nmoving into 2016 and beyond,\nthat stuff's going to go away over time.\n\n116\n00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.870\nSo keep that in mind and\n\n117\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.970\nstay on that track to make sure you're\nupgrading that infrastructure as required.\n\n118\n00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.310\nWe do have a little primer on how\nNetwork Discovery works down here.\n\n119\n00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.930\nWe're going to take you through and\nshow a little bit of it here.\n\n120\n00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.500\nI'll go a little deeper in the demo\nwe're going to do in a separate episode\n\n121\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.970\nmomentarily, but\nyou will be able to see it here and\n\n122\n00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.970\nbe able to see the information on it.\n\n123\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.580\nIf we are gonna go out and discover\nnetwork devices through opps managers,\n\n124\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.830\nI'm gonna show you how to do.\n\n125\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.350\nWe have a little website here,\na little webpage again.\n\n126\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.400\nThat shows us some of\nthe basic information.\n\n127\n00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.480\nHow to set up our network devices,\ndiscovery rule.\n\n128\n00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.510\nI'm gonna walk you through\nhow to do this right now, and\n\n129\n00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.640\nshow you in the administration\nworkspace using discovery wizard\n\n130\n00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.560\nhow we actually do that.\n\n131\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.770\nSo we'll just take a look at the high\nlevel, then we'll come back,\n\n132\n00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.090\nwe'll do a demo on that.\n\n133\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.970\nWe do have a hot standby router protocol\nfeature and functionality documentation.\n\n134\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.000\nI promised you we'd put that up for\nyou just to show you where it is.\n\n135\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.820\nWe do have the URL for you in the show\nnotes on that so you can go and\n\n136\n00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.500\nyou can take a look.\n\n137\n00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.180\nBut we're gonna be able\nto walk through and\n\n138\n00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.930\nsee all the information we need in order\nto be able to figure out how this works.\n\n139\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.310\nSo let's go in real quick,\nwe'll take a look.\n\n140\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.710\nJust minimize that, sorry about that.\n\n141\n00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.980\nLet's go ahead and just take a look,\nhere inside the console, real quick.\n\n142\n00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.420\nIn the Admin work space,\nNetwork Management,\n\n143\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.200\nwe do have our discovery rules here.\n\n144\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.460\nNotice, we don't have any.\n\n145\n00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.610\nGonna right click, run the Discovery\nWizard, and, when we do that,\n\n146\n00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.690\nwe have options.\n\n147\n00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.720\nWe can go in and\ndiscover our Windows computer,\n\n148\n00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.700\nwe can discover Unix Linux computers.\n\n149\n00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.918\nNetwork device,\nwe're gonna focus on network device.\n\n150\n00:07:00.918 --> 00:07:03.281\nWant to do a push of the console agent, or\n\n151\n00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:06.130\npush install the agent\nthrough the console.\n\n152\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.470\nWe've been doing it here.\n\n153\n00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.350\nOnce we do a discovery we have\nthe ability then to push the agent out\n\n154\n00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.580\nif we want to as opposed\nto a manual install.\n\n155\n00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.410\nAnd we talked about some of the\ndifferences in the way we do installs for\n\n156\n00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.550\nthese agents in episodes.\n\n157\n00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.100\nYou may want to just make sure you're\nthinking about that while we're here.\n\n158\n00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.820\nWe're gonna do a Network Discovery.\n\n159\n00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.880\nYou'll see that we give\nthis a name real quick, so\n\n160\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.300\nwe'll just name it momentarily, select\nour management and or gateway server, so\n\n161\n00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.240\nwe'd have to specify what we have.\n\n162\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.700\nWe do have one there, we'll put that in.\n\n163\n00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.150\nWe're gonna use our available pool,\nwe are, and then this is the part I just\n\n164\n00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.350\nwanna show you quickly,\nexplicit or recursive discovery.\n\n165\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.380\nExplicit goes out and discovers only those\nnetwork that we specify, whereas recursive\n\n166\n00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.020\ngoes out and finds everything and\nthen just gives us a full list.\n\n167\n00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.632\nSo we'll be walking through this and\ntaking a look in more detail.\n\n168\n00:07:48.632 --> 00:07:50.463\nAnd how this works in an upcoming demo.\n\n169\n00:07:50.463 --> 00:07:54.139\nBut I just wanted you to see this a little\nbit, just get a general overview and\n\n170\n00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:58.051\na sense of this This is important, because\nthis is gonna drive our ability to then\n\n171\n00:07:58.051 --> 00:08:00.760\nbring in those network devices and\nmanage them.\n\n172\n00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.340\nAnd it's one of the three pillars that we\nhave here with regards to Windows, Unix,\n\n173\n00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.250\nLinux, and network discovery,\nwith regards to populating information so\n\n174\n00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.120\nwe can actually manage infrastructure.\n\n175\n00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.090\nSo once we do that, assuming, of course,\nthat we have found network devices.\n\n176\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.530\nWe will see them here under\nNetwork Device, and or\n\n177\n00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.210\nif they are pending management we will see\nthem here and then have to come in and\n\n178\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:27.890\napprove them just like we will do when\nwe are or allow them to be monitored.\n\n179\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.060\nJust like we're doing with the agents when\nwe have pending agent installations and\n\n180\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.021\nwe have to approve them.\n\n181\n00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:37.930\nSo we're gonna see all that here,\nactually there, more or less, right?\n\n182\n00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.410\nWe're gonna see it all right there and\n\n183\n00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.580\nwe're then gonna be able\nto work with these systems.\n\n184\n00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.977\nAnd remember,\nwe tie this back in to reporting,\n\n185\n00:08:43.977 --> 00:08:47.903\nwe tie it in through the management packs\nas we took a look at in the last episode.\n\n186\n00:08:47.903 --> 00:08:50.279\nWe go here to reporting and\nlet's just open this up,\n\n187\n00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:52.600\nlet's take a look real quick for a second.\n\n188\n00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.530\nAnd we can see, as we go in here.\n\n189\n00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.260\nThat, when we start to look.\n\n190\n00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.090\nWe will have the ability\nto be able to go in.\n\n191\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.080\nJust pull this down here.\n\n192\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.800\nAnd we can see we have just general\nnetwork management reports here.\n\n193\n00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.570\nAnd we could see we have process, our\nmemory interface packet bind, etcetera.\n\n194\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.180\nWe can see information about\nthe network and devices attached to it.\n\n195\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.530\nWe can create our own reports that\nwill further delve into this for\n\n196\n00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.890\nus if we choose to.\n\n197\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.400\nSo we've got a lot of capabilities or\n\n198\n00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.590\ndifferent options that we can use\ninside of the Reporting Library.\n\n199\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.770\nWe do have generic reports,\nwe didn't really look at these last time.\n\n200\n00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:33.330\nBut we have generic reports on various\nperformance items, configuration changes.\n\n201\n00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.410\nI showed you one of\nthe reports in the last demo.\n\n202\n00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:40.160\nAnd discussion we did in episode two where\nwe took a look at the health breakdown of\n\n203\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.490\nthe data volume breakdown of the data\nwarehouse based on management pack and\n\n204\n00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.370\nthe health status pack was the number one.\n\n205\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.800\nSo we have a lot of different options\nto go in here and interact with.\n\n206\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.240\nAnd network reporting or\n\n207\n00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.080\nnetwork monitoring of the device is\ngonna play a critical part in this.\n\n208\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.640\nBut you can see we also\nhave client monitoring.\n\n209\n00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.861\nWe have endpoint monitoring,\napplication monitoring.\n\n210\n00:09:57.861 --> 00:10:02.940\nSo we have all sorts of different reports\nthat we can bring in and we can use.\n\n211\n00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.860\nSo we had taken a look at the agent.\n\n212\n00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.520\nOr rather, data volume by\nmanagement pack last time, right?\n\n213\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.358\nSo we could be taking a look at this.\n\n214\n00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:12.500\nWhat we're gonna do is talk a bit\nabout configuring fabric monitoring\n\n215\n00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.510\nas part of our conversation here, as well.\n\n216\n00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.440\nRemember, System Center Virtual\nMachine Manager, SCVMM.\n\n217\n00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.750\nOne of the core products\nin the system center suite.\n\n218\n00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.652\nIs where we're gonna go to create\nour fabric for our private cloud.\n\n219\n00:10:23.652 --> 00:10:27.470\nSo we're gonna set up our hosting\ncapabilities, set up our networking, and\n\n220\n00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.010\ndo all the things we need to do.\n\n221\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.900\nBut we have to integrate VMM and\nOps Manger together so\n\n222\n00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.050\nthat we have the ability to\nset up the fabric in VMM and\n\n223\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.890\nthen monitor it through SCOM and\nhave the two talk to each other.\n\n224\n00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.414\nWe gotta have some management\npack setup and installed,\n\n225\n00:10:40.414 --> 00:10:42.053\nconfigured here in order to do that.\n\n226\n00:10:42.053 --> 00:10:45.712\nWe have got a list of them\nin the show notes for you.\n\n227\n00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:48.570\nAnd the main one is\nthe SQL Server core library.\n\n228\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.090\nAnd we need that.\n\n229\n00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.969\nWe have certain versions specifically and\nI put those in the notes,\n\n230\n00:10:52.969 --> 00:10:55.361\nput the core library, Server 2008.\n\n231\n00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:56.266\nWhat else do we have there?\n\n232\n00:10:56.266 --> 00:11:01.472\nServer 2008 IIS, we need\nWindows Server operating system, and\n\n233\n00:11:01.472 --> 00:11:07.690\nthe IIS services library version in order\nto be able to do the VMM integration.\n\n234\n00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.980\nWe also have to make sure we have the ops\nconsole installed on the VMM server.\n\n235\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.360\nOnce we set the VMM instance up,\nwe're gonna be able to do that before we\n\n236\n00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.850\nconfigure the integration,\nwe gotta make sure that's there.\n\n237\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.710\nAnd we also deploy the ops agent.\n\n238\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.610\nIt's recommended we deploy\na Microsoft monitoring agent,\n\n239\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.920\nthe SCOM agent, onto the VMM server,\nand all virtual machines.\n\n240\n00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.390\nSo that way we could do\nfull stack monitoring.\n\n241\n00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.670\nAnd then once we do that, we're gonna\nuse the Add Operations Manager Wizard,\n\n242\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.340\nInside VMM to actually do the integration.\n\n243\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.580\nSo let's just take a look here for\njust one second, give me just a moment.\n\n244\n00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.890\nLet me just switch over to\na different VM real quick.\n\n245\n00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.452\nSo I just wanna bring this up,\nlet me just also extend our lab timer so\n\n246\n00:11:46.452 --> 00:11:48.900\nthat we don't have a problem with that.\n\n247\n00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.230\nLet me bring up our VMM and\n\n248\n00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.550\nyou could see here we do have\nour VMM machine up and running.\n\n249\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.710\nWe haven't gone and really done any\nconfiguration, or anything yet.\n\n250\n00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.003\nWe're gonna take a look at this and\n\n251\n00:12:00.003 --> 00:12:05.237\ngo more in depth in a full blown demo\nepisode coming soon to ITPro.TV near you.\n\n252\n00:12:05.237 --> 00:12:06.720\nIt's gonna happen in just a little bit.\n\n253\n00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.635\nYou're gonna come back and\njoin us for that, but\n\n254\n00:12:08.635 --> 00:12:10.730\nI just wanted to show\nyou what VMM looks like.\n\n255\n00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.590\nHaven't really looked under the hood\ntoo much in this product yet, but\n\n256\n00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.030\nthe idea here would be that we'll be able\nto go in and we'll be able to integrate\n\n257\n00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:23.100\nthe VMM solution with the SCOM management\nand we'll have the two talk to each other.\n\n258\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.550\nWe do recommend, so let's just go in\nhere real quick, we'll take a look.\n\n259\n00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:33.532\nWe do recommend that we install or have\ninstalled in here the management agent.\n\n260\n00:12:33.532 --> 00:12:36.916\nYou'll see right now it is\nnot installed on this box.\n\n261\n00:12:36.916 --> 00:12:39.415\nAnd one of the recommendations\nduring the configuration is,\n\n262\n00:12:39.415 --> 00:12:40.950\nhey let's get that installed.\n\n263\n00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.065\nWe could do a console push.\n\n264\n00:12:43.065 --> 00:12:46.625\nSo we could go out and\nuse the discovery method to find VMM,\n\n265\n00:12:46.625 --> 00:12:49.245\nand then actually put the agent out there.\n\n266\n00:12:49.245 --> 00:12:51.223\nAnd then install it,\nand then configure it.\n\n267\n00:12:51.223 --> 00:12:53.375\nAnd you're gonna actually see\nme walk through that, and\n\n268\n00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:55.920\nsee that process as part of the demo\nthat we're gonna do for you.\n\n269\n00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.500\nBut if you think about the logic of it,\nwe go back to the console on SCOM,\n\n270\n00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.980\nwe do a discovery method,\nWindows computer,\n\n271\n00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.500\nfind VMM, highlight that, view\nthe console, push for the agent install,\n\n272\n00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.820\nhave it show up here, and then we'd\nbe able to tie these two together.\n\n273\n00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.720\nUsing the Add Operations Manager Wizard,\nwhich we'll have in the VMM box, and\n\n274\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.190\nthen we'd be able to start\ndoing the monitoring.\n\n275\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.300\nSo we're gonna go through and take\na look at all that and how that works.\n\n276\n00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.210\nBut I just wanted to show you that\njust at the top or the high level\n\n277\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.560\nhere as we're talking, just to make sure\nwe have a sense of what we're doing.\n\n278\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.490\nLet me also, just while we're doing this,\n\n279\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.424\nshow you a couple of things about\nVMM that you may wanna be aware of.\n\n280\n00:13:32.535 --> 00:13:35.921\nLet us take a look at,\nwe did viewing and reporting.\n\n281\n00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:38.818\nLet me go back here just one second\ncuz we just talked about these things,\n\n282\n00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.360\nlet me quickly show them to you.\n\n283\n00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.330\nSo setting up and\nviewing the network device,\n\n284\n00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.080\nas I showed you where\nyou would go to do this.\n\n285\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.970\nWe have a little website here\nthat'll give you some information on\n\n286\n00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.270\nhow to go in under network monitoring and\nactually take a look.\n\n287\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.890\nYou'll be able to then see that.\n\n288\n00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.260\nWe can actually, I didn't show you\nthe network summary dashboard,\n\n289\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.970\nI'll be happy to go in and\ntake a look at that with you real quick.\n\n290\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.010\nWell we'd have a dashboard\nthat shows you this as well.\n\n291\n00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.930\nSo I will go back in the console\nmomentarily to show this to you.\n\n292\n00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.660\nWe do have the reports for\nnetwork monitoring.\n\n293\n00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.450\nI showed you some of the reports just now,\nshowed you process utilization,\n\n294\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:06.970\nmemory, etc.\n\n295\n00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.295\nunder the SCOM reporting interface.\n\n296\n00:14:09.295 --> 00:14:13.705\nSo we can take a look at those, an output\nof network monitoring, very important.\n\n297\n00:14:13.705 --> 00:14:15.745\nWe do have our virtual\nmachine manager overview.\n\n298\n00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:18.459\nThis is the one I just wanted to show you,\nwith regards to fabric.\n\n299\n00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:22.735\nAgain coming in here we have just\nan overview, getting started.\n\n300\n00:14:22.735 --> 00:14:24.405\nWe do then have the requirements.\n\n301\n00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.695\nWe do have all the things\nwe need to do to set it up.\n\n302\n00:14:26.695 --> 00:14:30.125\nNow we did do,\nin the first set of episodes,\n\n303\n00:14:30.125 --> 00:14:33.350\nnot only an overview of the product,\nbut we actually did a hands-on demo\n\n304\n00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.635\nwhere we did an episode specific\nto installing and configuring VMM.\n\n305\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.600\nSo we have gone through and\nshowed you how to stand this product up.\n\n306\n00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.770\nWe just haven't actually\ncovered the interface and\n\n307\n00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.920\nconfiguration between this product and\nSCOM.\n\n308\n00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.110\nAnd we're actually gonna do that,\n\n309\n00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.070\nas I said, in an upcoming episode\nhere in just a little bit.\n\n310\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.310\nBut we do have all of the requirements,\nall of the information,\n\n311\n00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.794\nall the things we need to be able to\nbe successful sitting right here.\n\n312\n00:14:56.794 --> 00:14:57.714\nLet's just go in and\n\n313\n00:14:57.714 --> 00:15:00.920\ntake a look at that dashboard really\nquickly that I forgot to show you.\n\n314\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.940\nSo let's just go back, we'll take\na look at that while we're here.\n\n315\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.800\nWe'll go to Monitoring real quick.\n\n316\n00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.500\nAnd when we wanna go in and we wanna\ntake a look, let's just come down here.\n\n317\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.130\nAnd under Network Monitoring right here,\nI'm gonna just open this up.\n\n318\n00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.450\nWe can see because of\nthe monitoring that's taking place,\n\n319\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.420\nwe can see all of the different views and\ndashboards that will be helpful for us.\n\n320\n00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.780\nThe output of our network discovery for\nall of our devices.\n\n321\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.600\nWe'll have active alerts.\n\n322\n00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.930\nMay or may not have any right now.\n\n323\n00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:30.490\nWe're not going to [INAUDIBLE].\n\n324\n00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:31.938\nWe haven't discovered anything.\n\n325\n00:15:31.938 --> 00:15:34.410\nBut we could see all the hosts\nthat are being discovered\n\n326\n00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.850\nthrough the discovery system and\nnetwork monitoring.\n\n327\n00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.319\nWe have HSRP going on.\n\n328\n00:15:38.319 --> 00:15:42.690\nAnd we're interacting with Cisco device,\nwe'll see our HSRP groups there.\n\n329\n00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.675\nWe'll be able to get a view,\ninteract with them.\n\n330\n00:15:44.675 --> 00:15:47.922\nAny legacy network device is\nbased on the discovery method and\n\n331\n00:15:47.922 --> 00:15:51.607\nthe different categories we have,\nany network devices, we'll have\n\n332\n00:15:51.607 --> 00:15:55.604\na network summary dashboard We do a nice\nlittle discussion on dashboards and\n\n333\n00:15:55.604 --> 00:15:59.727\nhave an upcoming episode on that where\nwe actually show you how to create them,\n\n334\n00:15:59.727 --> 00:16:02.179\ntalk about the column review,\nthe grid view.\n\n335\n00:16:02.179 --> 00:16:04.118\nAnd talk about how to\nbreak down a dashboard and\n\n336\n00:16:04.118 --> 00:16:06.250\nconfigure it with all the different parts.\n\n337\n00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.530\nShow you how to put a little widget\non there and configure a widget.\n\n338\n00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.090\nDaniel liked saying\nwidget in that episode.\n\n339\n00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.230\nHe says it non-stop behind\nthe scenes all the time.\n\n340\n00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.960\n&gt;&gt; Widget.\n\n341\n00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.003\n&gt;&gt; Just like that, exactly.\n\n342\n00:16:15.003 --> 00:16:15.752\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n343\n00:16:15.752 --> 00:16:17.220\nwe're gonna who you how to do all this.\n\n344\n00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.250\nBut you can see we have all\nthe different views here.\n\n345\n00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.900\nWe have a view for routers,\nif we've discovered routers.\n\n346\n00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.860\nOne for switches, and\nas I mentioned one for VLANs.\n\n347\n00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.040\nAnd then we do have a performance\nview up under here as well,\n\n348\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.860\nwhere we can drill down even further.\n\n349\n00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.893\nAside from the reporting, this is just\nthe monitoring piece, like PerfMon,\n\n350\n00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:36.289\nwhere we're gonna be\nable to see free memory.\n\n351\n00:16:36.289 --> 00:16:41.010\nWe're gonna be able to see interface\nusage, port usage, process utilization.\n\n352\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.140\nSo we got some very detailed\nmonitoring that takes place and\n\n353\n00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.180\nsome reporting that backs that up as\nwell around the network discovery.\n\n354\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.250\nAnd of course,\nthen linking that broader and\n\n355\n00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:54.570\nwider out beyond just the network\ninterfaces and information.\n\n356\n00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.190\nBut now drilling into the fabric with VMM,\nthe virtual machines\n\n357\n00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.580\nreally begin to see the scope of this\nproject and really widening this out.\n\n358\n00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.090\nWe can monitor, and we can see not just\nthe health of an individual device, but we\n\n359\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:10.270\ncan actually, through the VMM integration,\nmonitor the health of the cloud overall.\n\n360\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.760\nSo the entire cloud,\nthe fabric itself, and\n\n361\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.910\nall the monitoring that\ntakes place around that.\n\n362\n00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.700\nWe can also turn this a little broader and\nwider, and\n\n363\n00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.510\ntake this out to Azure to\nMicrosoft cloud fabric.\n\n364\n00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:25.940\nAnd we can actually configure System\nCenter Manager SCCM and configuration.\n\n365\n00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.220\nI'm gonna try it again.\n\n366\n00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.330\nWe can configure the OPs\nmatters is what I mean to say.\n\n367\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.290\nTo actually broaden its scope of coverage,\nand connect out to Azure and\n\n368\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:38.360\ndo cloud base monitoring for us from the\non-prem instance of we own SCCM locally.\n\n369\n00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.380\nWe are running a hosted\nprivate cloud with Microsoft.\n\n370\n00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.890\nWe can actually do monitoring\ninto the Azure stack.\n\n371\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.710\nWe do have a monitor and management pack\nfor Windows Azure that we can download and\n\n372\n00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.920\nwe can install, import and configure.\n\n373\n00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.210\nWe can bring that in.\n\n374\n00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.830\nWe do need to be running at least\nSCCM 2012 SP1 in order to do this, so\n\n375\n00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.940\njust wanted to make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n376\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.280\nObviously, 2012 R2 would be\ncertainly perfectly fine there.\n\n377\n00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.650\nWe do need Internet connectivity,\n\n378\n00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.020\nso we gotta be able to go out and\nhave access to the Internet.\n\n379\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.204\nCan't manage the cloud\nfabric without the cloud.\n\n380\n00:18:08.204 --> 00:18:09.066\n&gt;&gt; Kind of difficult.\n\n381\n00:18:09.066 --> 00:18:09.935\n&gt;&gt; It would be hard.\n\n382\n00:18:09.935 --> 00:18:10.931\n&gt;&gt; It would be hard.\n\n383\n00:18:10.931 --> 00:18:12.790\nThey haven't come up with\na way to do that yet.\n\n384\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:17.730\nAnd then we do also need to enable Windows\nAzure Diagnostics in Microsoft Azure.\n\n385\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.830\nSo up in the cloud stack,\nwe have to turn on the Azure diagnostics\n\n386\n00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.080\ncapabilities that we can actually\nthen draw down that data and monitor.\n\n387\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.680\nWe have to set up and\nconfigure data to be using Microsoft or\n\n388\n00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.810\nto be forwarding it to\nMicrosoft Azure storage.\n\n389\n00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.140\nSo there's some configuration on\nthe backend with Azure that we have to\n\n390\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.540\ninteract with and engage.\n\n391\n00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.635\nOnce we get that all set up,\nwe have to have an account obviously and\n\n392\n00:18:39.635 --> 00:18:41.415\nan active account on the Azure fabric.\n\n393\n00:18:41.415 --> 00:18:43.015\nWe'd have to have that as well, but\n\n394\n00:18:43.015 --> 00:18:46.575\nwe can than make sure that we\nhave our valid certificates,\n\n395\n00:18:46.575 --> 00:18:51.380\nwe need our X509B3 certificates to\nauthenticate into the Azure stack.\n\n396\n00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.480\nSo there's some things we\nwanna go through there.\n\n397\n00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.960\nWe'll add in the Windows Azure\nsubscription.\n\n398\n00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.190\nWe have a wizard for that.\n\n399\n00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.800\nIt's called\nthe Add Windows Azure Subscription Wizard.\n\n400\n00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.742\nI love how they name wizards.\n\n401\n00:19:00.742 --> 00:19:01.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n402\n00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.930\n&gt;&gt; It's just like you want to do that?\n\n403\n00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.550\nWe'll just call it that and\nthat's what our wizard will be.\n\n404\n00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:09.920\nSo we'll discover the Azure resources\nby running that particular wizard\n\n405\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.270\nafter we setup and import the management\npack, the wizard becomes available.\n\n406\n00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.590\nSo you're not gonna have the wizard\nuntil you bring the management pack in.\n\n407\n00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.740\nOnce you import the manager pack,\nyou run the wizard.\n\n408\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.960\nYou tell it what is your Azure\nconfiguration is, your account,\n\n409\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.560\nyour subscription, all that information.\n\n410\n00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.430\nGoes out, hits the cloud,\ndetails out everything it needs,\n\n411\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.380\nbrings it back and then lets you walk\nthrough the whole configuration.\n\n412\n00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.400\nSo that part is pretty straightforward.\n\n413\n00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.070\nWe can use that and set that up.\n\n414\n00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:38.160\nWe also have this cool thing that we\nhaven't really talked about until now But\n\n415\n00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.500\nI do just wanna show you a little\nbit information on it as well.\n\n416\n00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.610\nGive me just one second to\nbring up the webpage again.\n\n417\n00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:47.160\nAnd it is called the Ops Manager Suite,\nwhich is essentially\n\n418\n00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.200\nanother element of Ops Manager\nout in the cloud through Azure.\n\n419\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.450\nSo what OMS, the Ops Manager Suite?\n\n420\n00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:58.700\nThis is essentially our cloud based hosted\nversion of SCOM that runs in Azure.\n\n421\n00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.560\nSo we actually have\nthe ability to do this and\n\n422\n00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.260\nrun this directly there, if we need to.\n\n423\n00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.850\nWe are gonna be able to integrate with\nSystem Center components like SCOM.\n\n424\n00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.750\nSo if we are using this and\n\n425\n00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.000\nwe have a hybrid solution where\nwe have on-prem resources.\n\n426\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.760\nAnd in the cloud resources, we can\nactually monitor either from on-prem into\n\n427\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.000\nthe cloud or from the cloud down into\nour on-prem instance and do both.\n\n428\n00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.733\nSo we actually now have essentially\n[INAUDIBLE] service option,\n\n429\n00:20:22.733 --> 00:20:24.564\nwhich is pretty cool\nif you think about it.\n\n430\n00:20:24.564 --> 00:20:26.700\nAnd think about what this\ncapability gives you.\n\n431\n00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.110\nSo we do have the URL for this,\nyou can go out and take a look.\n\n432\n00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.650\nYou can set up a free account and\n\n433\n00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.510\nplay around with this\na little bit which is nice.\n\n434\n00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:36.070\nBut you can see we have Insight and\nAnalytics here through Log Analytics, so\n\n435\n00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.790\nwe can collect, search, and act on all\nthe various log information we get.\n\n436\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.510\nSo essentially a SEM capability,\nSecurity Information Event Management.\n\n437\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.910\nWe do have the automation and\ncontrol capabilities.\n\n438\n00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:50.950\nWith runbooks, we're talking about those\nwith Powershell and with Orchestrator.\n\n439\n00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.200\nWe do have that capability.\n\n440\n00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.460\nWe do have the Azure backup and\nAzure site recovery capabilities, so\n\n441\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.100\nprotection in disaster recovery\nis there in the cloud for us.\n\n442\n00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.940\nAnd we do have the availability\nto be able to be fully compliant\n\n443\n00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.210\nhere with our Security and Audit solution.\n\n444\n00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.930\nSo we have ISO compliance and all\nthe different standards that would be out\n\n445\n00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:12.130\nthere that you may need from an\nauditability and verification standpoint.\n\n446\n00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.870\nSo got all those different options here.\n\n447\n00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:14.730\nAnd you can drill down and\n\n448\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.390\nlearn more about any one of these, just by\nfollowing the appropriate links if needed.\n\n449\n00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:22.180\nSo we can bring this whole solution\nto bear here just by integrating and\n\n450\n00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.000\nconnecting up so we have the capabilities\nto use this from the cloud down.\n\n451\n00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.010\nOr from the private side in our\ninternal private cloud up into Azure.\n\n452\n00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.610\nAnd we can do this from\neither perspective or both.\n\n453\n00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.740\nReally broadening and strengthening our\nability to be able to do monitoring today.\n\n454\n00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.230\nSo this is, really from where we've been,\n\n455\n00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:44.246\nuntil the advent of this latest iteration,\n12 R2 and certainly now, Server 16.\n\n456\n00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.430\nAnd using system center\n2016 what's having even\n\n457\n00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.450\nmore [INAUDIBLE] having more features.\n\n458\n00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:55.280\nBuy the growth and the advent of the use\nof Azure Fabric and the cloud overall.\n\n459\n00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.740\nI was reading a statistics where something\nlike the growth in the last year alone for\n\n460\n00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.820\nuptake in Office 365 and cloud.\n\n461\n00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.146\nWith something like 450%, or\n\n462\n00:22:04.146 --> 00:22:07.540\nsome crazy number like that,\nover the last 12-month period.\n\n463\n00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.510\nAnd it's because of these kind of jumps\nand leaps in progress and services.\n\n464\n00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.090\nThat we're seeing such a huge uptake\nin the cloud or what's going on and so\n\n465\n00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.405\nit's really fascinating.\n\n466\n00:22:16.405 --> 00:22:19.240\nSo what's going on at the monitoring\nstack, the capabilities,\n\n467\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.290\nnot just Azure fabric obviously\nspecific here at Microsoft.\n\n468\n00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.670\nBut even more broadly with\nthings like Amazon, with Docker,\n\n469\n00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.360\njust all the other stuff that's going on.\n\n470\n00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.210\nIt's such a great time to be\ndoing this kind of work and\n\n471\n00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.410\njust be thinking about it.\n\n472\n00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.450\nI mean any time's a great time, right,\nbut the point is especially with just all\n\n473\n00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.410\nthe technology streams\nthat are coming together.\n\n474\n00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.550\nIt's just such a cool time\nto be working with IT and\n\n475\n00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.480\ndealing with this kind of stuff.\n\n476\n00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.980\nSo it is pretty cool as we say.\n\n477\n00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.340\n&gt;&gt; I think I would agree with you on that\nvery fact as well and just going through\n\n478\n00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.080\nwhat we have here in Office Manager and\nwhat we can do with the monitoring.\n\n479\n00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.530\nWhich assumingly no end.\n\n480\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.880\nI mean the fact that we can\nactually monitor third party\n\n481\n00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.510\ndevices things like Cisco\ndevices doing HSRP and\n\n482\n00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.370\njust other network devices that we\nhave available to our environment.\n\n483\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:03.930\nThat's an amazing thing, right?\n\n484\n00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.360\nWe're not just pidgeon-holed into well,\nit's a Microsoft product, so\n\n485\n00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.760\nit just does Microsoft.\n\n486\n00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.400\nWe get to branch out from there and\n\n487\n00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.020\nthen obviously like you've been talking\nabout moving out into Azure and\n\n488\n00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.790\nintegrating our cloud solution with\nour on-prem private cloud solution.\n\n489\n00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.450\nAnd monitoring everything within there,\n\n490\n00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.110\nmaking sure everything is\nlooking the way it should look.\n\n491\n00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.200\nVery detailed, they spent a lot\nof time and effort to make this.\n\n492\n00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.330\nA quality product that does a lot and\n\n493\n00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.910\ngives you a lot of\nhorsepower under the hood.\n\n494\n00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.480\nVery, very cool stuff.\n\n495\n00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.490\nAdam, I'm really looking forward to seeing\nsome of the demos we're getting ready to\n\n496\n00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.530\njump into in upcoming episodes.\n\n497\n00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.040\nBut as for now, I mean you've got us\nreally steered in the right direction.\n\n498\n00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.500\nWe've got to look at a lot of this stuff,\nunderstand the process\n\n499\n00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:49.040\nbehind these things to kind of think\nlogically how we would do these things.\n\n500\n00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.860\nThe demo is really gonna solidify that for\nus and we appreciate that.\n\n501\n00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.327\nThat being said, looking at the clock and\nI guess we've come to the end of a very\n\n502\n00:23:56.327 --> 00:24:00.132\ngreat episode unless you have\nanything else you would like to add?\n\n503\n00:24:00.132 --> 00:24:02.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Almost, I do, there's one quick thing.\n\n504\n00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.550\nI just want to go on\nsomething Daniel said.\n\n505\n00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.860\nHe was talking not just obviously\nthe great capabilities here, but\n\n506\n00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.130\nhe mentioned we can branch out.\n\n507\n00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.660\nWe can interact with other products.\n\n508\n00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.530\nBring back up monitor, if we could please.\n\n509\n00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.310\nJust and I didn't hit on this when we were\nin VMM in the console because we were just\n\n510\n00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.310\ntalking, but\nyou're just sitting there, right?\n\n511\n00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.780\nWhen we jump in in the library,\n\n512\n00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.340\nyou have the ability to manage not just\nour own virtualization and cloud stack.\n\n513\n00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.040\nYou could see that with HyperV, but\n\n514\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.330\nthe only product currently in\nthe market that manages all three.\n\n515\n00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:34.690\nZen Server and ESX, meaning we can manage\nHyper-V, we can manage Citrix Xen,\n\n516\n00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:39.320\nand we can manage VMware all from\nfrom VMM, all from System Center VMM.\n\n517\n00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.400\nNot complete management, like we could\ndo everything all those products do.\n\n518\n00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.030\nBut we have oversight,\nmanagement, interaction, and\n\n519\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.980\nintegration Capabilities to understand\nconfigs and keep an eye on them.\n\n520\n00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.700\nWe also have competitive\nmanagement packs available for\n\n521\n00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:56.260\nSCOM that manage into the VMWare and\nmanage into the Citrix environments.\n\n522\n00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.250\nSo we can pull in monitoring, as you were\nsaying, from all those platforms and\n\n523\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.560\nbring them in and\nactually then use this interface and\n\n524\n00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.110\nthis integration to be able to\ncreate that holistic solution.\n\n525\n00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:11.700\nThat ecosystem that's gonna monitor, not\njust our own Microsoft-centric stack but\n\n526\n00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.490\nour Unix, Linux infrastructure.\n\n527\n00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.540\nOur networking infrastructure and\nour cloud and\n\n528\n00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.970\nvirtualization platform infrastructure\nacross every major vendor today.\n\n529\n00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.230\nWe've got EMC [INAUDIBLE]\nmanagement packs, For\n\n530\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.520\nstorage, we've got everything that you\ncan imagine and all that stuff is there.\n\n531\n00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.310\nYou've just got to go out and grab it,\nbring it in and integrate it.\n\n532\n00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.910\nAnd then use the product line,\n\n533\n00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.640\nthe entire suite of products to be\nable to manage everything you have.\n\n534\n00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.840\n&gt;&gt; We've got to cue that meme\nof fry from Futurama saying,\n\n535\n00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.265\nshut up and take my money.\n\n536\n00:25:38.265 --> 00:25:39.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At this point,\n\n537\n00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.690\nman, there's nothing this thing can't do.\n\n538\n00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:42.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And I gotta have it,\n\n539\n00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.020\nso\n&gt;&gt; Like I was saying before though,\n\n540\n00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.120\nlooks like we've come to the end.\n\n541\n00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.120\nAdam, we thank you for\nyour insight on this product.\n\n542\n00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.790\nWe thank you guys for joining us.\n\n543\n00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.100\nBut we're gonna go right\nahead sign off for ITProTV.\n\n544\n00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.980\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n545\n00:25:53.980 -->

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:18.630\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.790\nAnd in today's episode we are talking\nall about data center monitoring with\n\n8\n00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.080\nMicrosoft SCOM and the six gun slinger\nstanding next to me is our good friend and\n\n9\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.500\njoining us again today, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.300\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.520\nHow is it going, man?\n\n12\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.020\nI'm shot help me [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.290\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, it's going well.\n\n14\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.250\nHey, get out have a little fun,\nwhen you're doing this otherwise,\n\n15\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.810\nwell, it's just not fun.\n\n16\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.220\nSo that's why you gotta\nplay rattle a little bit,\n\n17\n00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.430\nbut we do bring you serious information\nand good tidings from the land of SCOM.\n\n18\n00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.870\nWe are gonna continue our\ndemonstrations for you.\n\n19\n00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.260\nWe thought we would take a look at how to\nintegrate VMM, Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n20\n00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.140\nHow did take that,\nhow to integrate that with SCOM.\n\n21\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.358\nWe've talked a little bit about\nthat in one of our prior episodes,\n\n22\n00:00:57.358 --> 00:00:59.025\nwanna show you how that happens.\n\n23\n00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.125\nGonna go in,\ntake a look at the VMM settings,\n\n24\n00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:04.375\ngo in configure the Ops Manager\ninformation in there.\n\n25\n00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:07.465\nAnd we wanna also bring up Pro and\n\n26\n00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:10.360\nperformance resource\noptimization monitoring.\n\n27\n00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.500\nWe're gonna take a look at that.\n\n28\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.200\nThat would be essentially the idea in\nVMWare's competitive stack of DRS,\n\n29\n00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.540\nthe Distributed Resource Scheduler,\nand that automated load balancing, and\n\n30\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.510\nautomation, and monitoring, and\nall that kinda stuff that goes on.\n\n31\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.990\nWe're gonna take a look at some of that,\nhow all that comes together.\n\n32\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.360\nSo we're gonna jump in over here,\ntake a look.\n\n33\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.370\nThere we are, right up there.\n\n34\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.080\nAnd we're going to,\nI've already opened up the VMM console.\n\n35\n00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.300\nSo we're just on our server where\nour SCVMM instance is installed.\n\n36\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.900\nI've opened up the console and\n\n37\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.150\nI've just gone into the settings\nworkspace right down here.\n\n38\n00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.630\nAnd then the settings workspace I've\nhighlighted System Center settings.\n\n39\n00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.540\nAnd we have our Ops Manager\nserver item there.\n\n40\n00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.270\nGonna right-click on that,\njust bring up Properties.\n\n41\n00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.208\nAnd we're gonna get our\nAdd Operations Manager,\n\n42\n00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:55.460\njust move this over so you can see it.\n\n43\n00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.510\nAdd Operations Manager wizard.\n\n44\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.560\nWe're gonna go through here through\nthe introductory screen, and\n\n45\n00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.423\nwe're gonna specify the Ops Manager we're\ngonna connect to and configure this out.\n\n46\n00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:08.376\nWe'll provide credentials, we'll specify\nthat we have or it gives us a listing of\n\n47\n00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:12.255\nall the management packs we need,\nmake sure those are already installed.\n\n48\n00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:15.738\nI walked through in my discussion and hit\nthe high level on most of the management\n\n49\n00:02:15.738 --> 00:02:18.142\npacks I said we needed a bunch,\nI rattled two or three of them off.\n\n50\n00:02:18.142 --> 00:02:22.652\nAll of them including the versions are in\nthe show notes for you by the way, so\n\n51\n00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:25.622\nyou will be able to see them and\nknow exactly what those versions are.\n\n52\n00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:27.982\nIn case you're squinting right\nnow at the screen trying to say,\n\n53\n00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:30.452\nlet me get that real quick,\nsee what that version is.\n\n54\n00:02:30.452 --> 00:02:31.812\nWe did tell you everything\nyou need right there,\n\n55\n00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:34.172\nwhen you're gonna integrate this so,\nno worries about that at all.\n\n56\n00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:37.712\nSo we're gonna resume, we have all\nthe information necessary to proceed.\n\n57\n00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:40.882\nWe're gonna click Next,\nwe're gonna specify our server name.\n\n58\n00:02:40.882 --> 00:02:44.767\nSo we're gonna go ahead and type this in,\n\n59\n00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:51.850\nplabcis01.practicelabs.com to\nour fully qualified domain name.\n\n60\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.020\nWe then, you'll see here, have our\nused VMMs service account setting, we\n\n61\n00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.380\ncan go ahead and use either the VMM Server\nservice account, or use a Run As account.\n\n62\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.150\nWe'll leave the default\nservice account there for VMM.\n\n63\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.410\nWe're gonna enable Performance and\n\n64\n00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.820\nResource Optimization,\ndown at the bottom here, Enable Pro.\n\n65\n00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.460\nThis is gonna allow us to then\ndo some proactive monitoring and\n\n66\n00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.620\nspecify how things are working and\nwhether or not they're optimizing.\n\n67\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.490\nIf not, take some steps to\nhopefully make sure that happens.\n\n68\n00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.320\nEnable Maintenance Mode Integration\nwith Ops Manager.\n\n69\n00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.450\nWhen hosts are put into Maintenance Mode,\nmake sure that if we do them in VMM,\n\n70\n00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.700\nwe alert Ops Manager so that way\nOps Manager doesn't go crazy trying\n\n71\n00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.030\nto tell us, hey, by the way, you know\nthat server you keep wanting to monitor?\n\n72\n00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.140\nIt's not there, and here's all these\ncrazy alerts about the fact it's offline.\n\n73\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.100\nWell yeah, we know that.\n\n74\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.340\nBut we may not know that, in the sense\nthat if VMM is going to be able to\n\n75\n00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.700\nput a host into maintenance mode, to do\nsome patching or manipulation of the VMs,\n\n76\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.610\nor whatever we need to do,\nthen if we don't tell SCOM that,\n\n77\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.380\nSCOM's gonna think it's offline,\nfor real, and indeed it is.\n\n78\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.100\nBut it may not know why, and\nwe're gonna get crazy alerts, and\n\n79\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.200\nall sorts of stuff happening,\nwhereas, if we alert and\n\n80\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.800\ntell it that we're doing this,\nit's gonna be a lot better for us.\n\n81\n00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.900\nSo, wanna make sure we\ncheck these things off, and\n\n82\n00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.940\nobviously, benefit from as much\nautomation and communication as possible.\n\n83\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.030\nSo that's what we're gonna do,\n\n84\n00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.990\nwe're gonna click Next here,\nleave all those settings there.\n\n85\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.650\nWe have to specify our username\nthat's gonna be able to drive\n\n86\n00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.500\nall this munificence and magic for us.\n\n87\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.960\nThere's a word for you.\n\n88\n00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.680\nLook that one up and tell me what\nthe old english use of that one was.\n\n89\n00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.650\nAll right, so we're gonna do\npractice labs here for our domain.\n\n90\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.820\nSo we're gonna go make sure\nwe spelled that correctly.\n\n91\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.160\nAnd I'm thinking we did,\nthat could just be a smudge on my screen.\n\n92\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.450\nThere we go, practice labs, good.\n\n93\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.260\nAnd we are going to do administrator.\n\n94\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.030\nAnd we are going to put our password in.\n\n95\n00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:44.930\nWe got all of that.\n\n96\n00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.230\nAnd then we are gonna click Next.\n\n97\n00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.520\nGive that just a second.\n\n98\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.680\nNow, I like this right here.\n\n99\n00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.220\nWe're just gonna take\na look at this real quick.\n\n100\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.530\nSo we've talked a lot about the value\nof PowerShell in different places,\n\n101\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.450\ntalked about the value of\nautomation in scripting.\n\n102\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.510\nOne of the nice things\nMicrosoft's been doing for\n\n103\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.850\na while now in the console is\nintegrating PowerShell where we can.\n\n104\n00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.820\nAnd they obviously have tie-ins to do\nthat, we talked about some of them.\n\n105\n00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.910\nWe'll continue to in other episodes\ngoing forward throughout all the shows.\n\n106\n00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.040\nBut we get to peek under the hood every so\noften.\n\n107\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.260\nWe get to view the script that's gonna\nactually get generated to do this.\n\n108\n00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.290\nAnd so just do a little word wrap here so\nwe can see it, so\n\n109\n00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.880\nit's a little bit easier for you to see.\n\n110\n00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.530\nIt's not a very big one,\n\n111\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.970\nI will make the font a little bigger\ncuz I know it's kind of hard to see.\n\n112\n00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.910\nJust give me just a second, we'll do that.\n\n113\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.720\nMake that easier for\nyou to take a look at.\n\n114\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.560\nAnd we can see there that we've got\na PowerShell script that's gonna be run to\n\n115\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.893\nbe able to do a declared variable,\nVMM credential.\n\n116\n00:05:38.893 --> 00:05:45.315\nSet that equal to Get-Credential, then we\ngot New-SCOpsMgrConnection -EnablePRO,\n\n117\n00:05:45.315 --> 00:05:49.305\nso we've got the parameter for\nEnablePRO $true.\n\n118\n00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:52.285\nEnableMaintenanceModeIntegration $true,\nwe did that.\n\n119\n00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:56.700\nOpsMgr, specify the name of the OpsMgr,\nrunning synchronously,\n\n120\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.155\nuse our credential will\nUseVMMServerServiceAccount.\n\n121\n00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:02.370\nAnd so we've got that script\nrunning behind the scenes.\n\n122\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.470\nSo, all this stuff we think gonna be\nsmart next, next, next, configure,\n\n123\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.120\nconfigure, OK.\n\n124\n00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.467\nWhat really happens behind the scene is\nthe PowerShell kicks off in the ops shell,\n\n125\n00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:16.800\nor the VMM shell and its then gonna go\nahead and it's gonna run this for us.\n\n126\n00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.630\nOne of the reasons we keep stressing\nto you that it's important to start\n\n127\n00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.260\nlearning about PowerShell,\nand knowing what it does\n\n128\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.800\nis that it's really being used to\ndrive almost everything we do.\n\n129\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.128\nWe just have a nice pretty graphical\noverlay for most of it in the console,\n\n130\n00:06:28.128 --> 00:06:30.608\nbut reality is,\nit's there whether we like it or not.\n\n131\n00:06:30.608 --> 00:06:33.875\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of funny, we're clicking\nthings and checking boxes and stuff.\n\n132\n00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:36.875\nAnd the whole time, the system is\nbasically building a PowerShell script out\n\n133\n00:06:36.875 --> 00:06:39.737\nin the background, and then when you're\ndone it goes yeah you think it did\n\n134\n00:06:39.737 --> 00:06:42.781\nsomething really with the GUI really all\nyou did was tell us what we should put in\n\n135\n00:06:42.781 --> 00:06:44.848\nthe PowerShell script and\nnow we're running that.\n\n136\n00:06:44.848 --> 00:06:47.440\nSo like Adam said,\nit can be really helpful for\n\n137\n00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.300\nyou to understand what that looks like and\nhow that works on the backend.\n\n138\n00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I made a boo-boo.\n\n139\n00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.530\n&gt;&gt; You did?\n\n140\n00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.883\n&gt;&gt; It does happened on occasion,\ncuz I could not see,\n\n141\n00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.866\ncuz my screen went half-dim again [LAUGH].\n\n142\n00:06:58.866 --> 00:06:59.444\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n143\n00:06:59.444 --> 00:07:02.674\nI just took the opportunity while Daniel\nwas chatting with you, to hit Run so\n\n144\n00:07:02.674 --> 00:07:04.050\nwe just get this thing started.\n\n145\n00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.395\nAnd immediately we get the error,\nwhich is actually not a bad thing,\n\n146\n00:07:06.395 --> 00:07:09.400\ncuz you wanna see when things go wrong so\nyou know how to fix them.\n\n147\n00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.680\nSo if we get an error here, and\nwe can see the error up there.\n\n148\n00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.570\nCan we go fullscreen so\nI can show you what the error is.\n\n149\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.690\nWe'll rerun this to fix it for\nyou right now.\n\n150\n00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.900\nI think I'm gonna have Daniel type,\n\n151\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.810\nand see [LAUGH] he can\nsee it better than I can.\n\n152\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.430\nSo the problem, and when you look,\n\n153\n00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.090\nI know it may be hard to see even now,\nbut I left out the a.\n\n154\n00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.060\n&gt;&gt; Instead of plab I did plb.\n\n155\n00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.090\nSo the way we have a typo,\nin the sense that-\n\n156\n00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.000\n&gt;&gt; There's no such computer [LAUGH].\n\n157\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.998\n&gt;&gt; There's no such name out there.\n\n158\n00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:33.618\nSo, this does show you,\nby the way, DNS is working, and\n\n159\n00:07:33.618 --> 00:07:36.525\nwe do actually check those machines\nto make sure they are real.\n\n160\n00:07:36.525 --> 00:07:39.957\nSo what we're gonna do is simply go\nback and re-run this, no big deal.\n\n161\n00:07:39.957 --> 00:07:41.820\nWe'll do this and fix it up right now.\n\n162\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.760\nSo let's just quickly\nzip back through this.\n\n163\n00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.763\nWe'll spell it correctly this time,\nof course, and we'll get it right.\n\n164\n00:07:46.763 --> 00:07:52.346\nP-L-A-B-S-Y-S-0-1, could've sworn I\nput the A in there the first time.\n\n165\n00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:58.460\nPracticelabs.com, make\nsure we got that in there.\n\n166\n00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.870\nGot all that stuff.\n\n167\n00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.408\nGonna go ahead click Next,\nput in our user name,\n\n168\n00:08:03.408 --> 00:08:10.660\npracticelabs, and then administrator.\n\n169\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.870\nAt least it fails the second you start,\nas opposed to one of those,\n\n170\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.530\nlet me go get all the prep work done,\nhalfway through, wait ten minutes,\n\n171\n00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.150\nthen I'm gonna fail\nright before I connect.\n\n172\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.680\nThat would have just obviously not\nbeen very good cuz we would have\n\n173\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.170\nwasted all that time waiting on it.\n\n174\n00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.100\nSo at least it did fail right out of\nthe gate, that's the good thing, right.\n\n175\n00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.340\nAll right, so\nwe have practice labs, we got that.\n\n176\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.540\nLet's just click Next there,\nlet's get that set up.\n\n177\n00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.670\nLet's hit Finish, let's get that running.\n\n178\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.000\nThis time you could see right up there,\nit is running.\n\n179\n00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.600\nIt is out of the gate and successful.\n\n180\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.940\nIt's gonna take a couple minutes to cook.\n\n181\n00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.490\nSo we're gonna wait on this to finish up.\n\n182\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.050\nWe're gonna come on back, show you\nwhat happens after we get done, and\n\n183\n00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:44.045\nplay with Pro a little bit.\n\n184\n00:08:44.045 --> 00:08:50.870\nAll right, so we can see that our task has\nsuccessfully completed, hurrah, or huzzah.\n\n185\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Huzzah!\n&gt;&gt; Or just yay, whatever you prefer.\n\n186\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.680\nBut you can see we were successful.\n\n187\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.510\nI do know in the real world this will take\nyou, I'd guess, about 10 or 15 minutes, so\n\n188\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.950\ndon't be surprised about that.\n\n189\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.450\nBut we can see it did complete,\nran successfully.\n\n190\n00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.740\nWe didn't really go into the detail\nof what goes on in the job area here.\n\n191\n00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.840\nBut you can see the summary\narea tells us what's happening.\n\n192\n00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.178\nYou can go down here, look at details,\nisn't much more to know than that.\n\n193\n00:09:17.178 --> 00:09:20.000\nCuz we only did one thing but\nwe can see that that's there.\n\n194\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.300\nDo a little change tracking,\n\n195\n00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.760\nin case we did multiple iterations\nwe could see what was going on.\n\n196\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.000\nWe'll close this out.\n\n197\n00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.760\nYou can, just so you know, close that\nwindow out during install at any time and\n\n198\n00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.680\njust go back and\nlook at it whenever you want.\n\n199\n00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.840\nGot a little jobs area right up here,\nyou can just click on that.\n\n200\n00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.170\nBrings the window right back up for\nus, shows us what's happening.\n\n201\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.590\nSo we could do that as needed.\n\n202\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.188\nNow what we're gonna do is make\nsure that everything is setup.\n\n203\n00:09:44.188 --> 00:09:47.876\nNow we enable Pro as part of the install\nand configuration so, I'm just gonna go in\n\n204\n00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:50.825\nand show you the properties and\nshow you it's already turned on.\n\n205\n00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:54.025\nBut, if we didn't we would go in and\ncheck off the box in the property setting\n\n206\n00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:56.585\nhere and Pro would be enabled,\nso we'll take a look at that.\n\n207\n00:09:56.585 --> 00:10:00.245\nWe're also gonna go in and\nconfigure SQL Server Analysis Services and\n\n208\n00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:01.285\nmake sure we enable that.\n\n209\n00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:04.141\nWe're gonna take a look at that and\nshow you how to do that as well here.\n\n210\n00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:08.335\nSo gonna right-click on the Ops Manager\nserver, go to properties,\n\n211\n00:10:08.335 --> 00:10:12.095\nwe'll see that we do have connection\nstatus, green circle white check okay,\n\n212\n00:10:12.095 --> 00:10:13.530\nthat's what we expect to see.\n\n213\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:17.120\nAll is well, we do have our hard\ncoded information here now.\n\n214\n00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.130\nConnection settings, enable the connection\nto Ops Manager that's running of course.\n\n215\n00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.510\nEnable Pro,\nyou could see it is turned on by default.\n\n216\n00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.940\nIf we had to turn it on,\nwe'd come in here, check that off.\n\n217\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.860\nWe do have the maintenance mode\nintegration, we talked about those things\n\n218\n00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.470\non the setup as we were doing\nthe configuration initially.\n\n219\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.930\nJust move this over so you can see\nthat a little bit more clearly.\n\n220\n00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.390\nSo we had talked about this.\n\n221\n00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.270\nCan also take a look at and tell that our\nmanagement packs have been installed and\n\n222\n00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.660\nconfigured successfully.\n\n223\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.540\nWe'll see them here.\n\n224\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.720\nSo we do have a list of the ones that\nare a part of this configuration.\n\n225\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.700\nThis is actually what's taking the longest\nhere, is that making sure the all these\n\n226\n00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.410\nmanagement packages get instantiated and\nset up the right way.\n\n227\n00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.570\nAnd then I mentioned\nSQL Server Analysis Services,\n\n228\n00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.740\nsaid we would show you how to do this.\n\n229\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.795\nWe could enable the SSAS\nfunctionality here,\n\n230\n00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:04.256\ncheck off the box as you can see in\norder for VMM to be able to use SSAS or\n\n231\n00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:09.034\nthe SQL Server Analysis Services,\nthis is essentially the data cube and\n\n232\n00:11:09.034 --> 00:11:12.277\nthe data warehouse, and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n233\n00:11:12.277 --> 00:11:14.315\nBe able to do this to do\nforecasting analysis,\n\n234\n00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:16.150\nwe have to enable this integration.\n\n235\n00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.460\nSo we're gonna set this up.\n\n236\n00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.163\nWe'll give it a SASS Server name,\nwe're gonna\n\n237\n00:11:22.163 --> 00:11:27.110\nuse our default SQL install here,\nplabsys01.\n\n238\n00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.868\nWe'll give it our instance name MSSQL\nServer our default name that we've been\n\n239\n00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:33.890\nusing for everything else.\n\n240\n00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.087\nWe'll put in our port here 2383,\n\n241\n00:11:38.087 --> 00:11:43.736\nthat is our standard port\nthat we're going to use.\n\n242\n00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:49.023\nAnd then we'll specify our credentials\nright down here, we'll do our enter\n\n243\n00:11:49.023 --> 00:11:55.430\nusername and password, to our username,\nwhich will be our domain, practice labs.\n\n244\n00:11:55.430 --> 00:12:01.595\nAdministrator, we'll put that in, and\nthen we will put in our password.\n\n245\n00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:02.879\nWhoops, put in our password.\n\n246\n00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.970\nGet that in there as well.\n\n247\n00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.360\nGo ahead and we'll click OK.\n\n248\n00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.270\nWe could do the View Script on\nthe bottom there, on the left.\n\n249\n00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.330\nI showed you that before, just pointing\nthat out, we can do that as well.\n\n250\n00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.650\nWe'll give that just\na moment to do its thing.\n\n251\n00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.540\nWhat did I do there?\n\n252\n00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.290\nPlease provide a valid computer and\ninstance name.\n\n253\n00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.040\nAll right, so\nI may have had a little typo there.\n\n254\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.310\nLet's make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n255\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.210\n&gt;&gt; The plb machine's\ncome back to haunt us.\n\n256\n00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.390\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps, it could be.\n\n257\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.300\nLet's just make sure I\ndidn't make a mistake there.\n\n258\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.840\nI may have put in o instead\nof zero on the item there.\n\n259\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.680\nI'm not sure, I thought I hit zero.\n\n260\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.940\nBut plabsys, again,\nthat screen keeps going up and down.\n\n261\n00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.810\nThere we go, plabsys MSSQL Server,\nwe've got that.\n\n262\n00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.530\nGot the right number S,\nis in there in the MSSQL Server.\n\n263\n00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.563\nGot our port number 2383.\n\n264\n00:12:48.563 --> 00:12:50.310\nThat all looks good.\n\n265\n00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.070\nCould be our password or username.\n\n266\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:59.630\nLet's just go ahead and let's take a look\nand make sure that we're good there.\n\n267\n00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.660\nAll right, so let me just go in,\nwe'll just double check that really quick.\n\n268\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.578\nAnd let me see, so\nwe've got practice labs administrator.\n\n269\n00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:12.776\nJust make sure the password is right,\nthat could have been the problem.\n\n270\n00:13:12.776 --> 00:13:14.413\nMake sure that's good.\n\n271\n00:13:14.413 --> 00:13:19.680\n2383 MSSQL plabsys01,\nthat should all be good.\n\n272\n00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.740\nLet's take a look and see.\n\n273\n00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.502\nPerhaps I just did not pay attention.\n\n274\n00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:32.331\n&gt;&gt; It's trying.\n\n275\n00:13:32.331 --> 00:13:32.920\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n276\n00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.440\n&gt;&gt; There it is!\n\n277\n00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.100\n&gt;&gt; There we go, awesome!\n\n278\n00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.295\n&gt;&gt; Had us holding our breath for\nfive seconds.\n\n279\n00:13:37.295 --> 00:13:38.780\n&gt;&gt; Why we didn't get that on camera.\n\n280\n00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.290\nIt's gonna be like a moving one.\n\n281\n00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.130\nAwesome, all right.\n\n282\n00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.910\nSo we got that, so it was probably just\nme not typing in the right stuff cuz\n\n283\n00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.178\nI can't see half the time on the screen.\n\n284\n00:13:49.178 --> 00:13:52.710\nSo we can see that once we get that\nset up it's now configured as well.\n\n285\n00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.970\nAnd now if we go back, we take a look\nat properties, we can actually see that\n\n286\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.320\nit is up and running and\nwe'll be able to go in and ensure that.\n\n287\n00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.278\nSo we can go take a look real quick and\njust see.\n\n288\n00:14:02.278 --> 00:14:06.630\nWe go to Properties here, come over here,\nwe can actually see it is now setup and\n\n289\n00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.140\nconfigured.\n\n290\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.420\nSee it looks a little different.\n\n291\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.300\nWe do have our instance there,\ngot our port,\n\n292\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.370\nall of that information\nis available to us.\n\n293\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.870\nThis is how we do the backend\nintegration and make sure we go through\n\n294\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:22.080\nconfigure SCOM, VMM integration, enable\nand use Pro or enable and setup Pro.\n\n295\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.440\nEnable and use and setup SSAS integration,\nand by handing out and giving out all this\n\n296\n00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.560\ncredentials getting everything organized,\nconfigured up and set up correctly,\n\n297\n00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.360\nwe now have the ability to link the VMM\nproduct into the SCOM solution.\n\n298\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.349\nBring fabric monitoring of\nthe cloud into SCOM and\n\n299\n00:14:39.349 --> 00:14:43.560\nallow us to be more proactive in how\nwe manage and maintain the fabric.\n\n300\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.914\nAnd that's gonna be an upcoming\nsource of conversation for us,\n\n301\n00:14:46.914 --> 00:14:49.897\nin terms of how we're gonna\ndo application monitoring,\n\n302\n00:14:49.897 --> 00:14:52.335\nin dealing with some of\nthose kinds of issues.\n\n303\n00:14:52.335 --> 00:14:56.052\nWe also have a whole separation\nconversation that goes, and not just\n\n304\n00:14:56.052 --> 00:15:00.539\na conversation, but entire show, whole\nepisodes on how to actually configure and\n\n305\n00:15:00.539 --> 00:15:05.740\ndo monitoring with VMM and integration and\nall that, in the 7246 and 7247 series.\n\n306\n00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.520\nThe MCSC private cloud,\nwhere we go deeper and\n\n307\n00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:13.360\nwider into not just SCOM, but really do\na deep dive into VMM specifically and\n\n308\n00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.660\nlook at how we set that fabric up and\nmaintain that.\n\n309\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.000\nSo always think about that,\n\n310\n00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.270\nI encourage you to come back,\ntake a look at those shows join us and\n\n311\n00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.370\nfind out more about how we extend\nthis product and do more with it.\n\n312\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.020\nBut we're gonna continue our conversations\ngoing through the rest of our episodes and\n\n313\n00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.120\nshow material here around SCOM and\nSCOM monitoring, and how we do that for\n\n314\n00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.720\nthe data center in the cloud.\n\n315\n00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:38.517\nAnd Daniel, you are, if I'm not mistaken,\ngoing to use your powers of maleficence.\n\n316\n00:15:38.517 --> 00:15:41.950\nMalevolent powers, maleficence powers,\nyou are maleficent.\n\n317\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.230\nNo, you are not, I'm only kidding.\n\n318\n00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.000\nDaniel is gonna take us out,\nbut we are done with our demo.\n\n319\n00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.270\nAlways have, and keep in mind just\nas we're wrapping up, always have\n\n320\n00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.250\nin your mind the thought process about,\nnot just documenting what we did,\n\n321\n00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.510\nyou saw what we did and you're\nobviously gonna go and practice that.\n\n322\n00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.260\nBut I always stress the importance\nof using those screens that we saw.\n\n323\n00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.700\nSummer screens and the script screens\nto grab that documentation and\n\n324\n00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.860\nmake sure we have a record of it so that\nyou know what you did in the real world.\n\n325\n00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.040\nSo you can track that\nback a year from now,\n\n326\n00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.940\ntwo years from now whenever you've\ngotta manage that infrastructure.\n\n327\n00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.017\nIn case something goes wrong, we're\ngonna talk about disaster recovery and\n\n328\n00:16:13.017 --> 00:16:16.380\nbusiness continuity in some of the very\nlast episodes we put together for you.\n\n329\n00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.140\nWanna make sure you take a look at those,\nand understand how to deal with it.\n\n330\n00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.090\nBut if anything does go wrong,\nyou got a record of what we did here.\n\n331\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.360\nSo don't underestimate the value\nof taking some screen captures,\n\n332\n00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.120\ntaking a look at what you did, and\ncapturing it as you're doing it, so\n\n333\n00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.950\nyou can refer back to it\nlater if you need to.\n\n334\n00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.060\nSo it's gonna be very important.\n\n335\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Wise words from our good friend,\nMr. Adam Gordon.\n\n336\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.720\nWe do thank you for\nthe cool demonstrations today, and\n\n337\n00:16:35.720 -->

00:00:12.130\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.340\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Datacenter Monitoing\nwith Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n5\n00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.350\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.880\nToday, we have the lovely\nAdam Gordon in studio.\n\n7\n00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.220\nThank you for joining us

that was very nice.\n\n15\n00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.980\nSo we are going to continue\ntalking about SCOM.\n\n16\n00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.570\nIt's always nice to spend time with you,\nnice to spend time with Cherokee.\n\n17\n00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.550\nAnd nice to be lovely so\neverything is nice so that's good.\n\n18\n00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.620\nSo we're gonna continue talking, we\nare actually going spend some time talking\n\n19\n00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.600\nabout application performance monitoring\ncommonly what is refered to as\n\n20\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.210\nAPM that's what you often hear\npeople talk about with SCUM.\n\n21\n00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.380\nUsing the technology.\n\n22\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.070\nTo be able to monitor in general.\n\n23\n00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.170\nWe've been talking about that all along\nthroughout the show in all the episodes\n\n24\n00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.210\nwe've been going through.\n\n25\n00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.260\nShown you how to set up\nsystem center ops manager.\n\n26\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.370\nHow to create your management group,\nyour resource pool.\n\n27\n00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.900\nHow to use gateway service in theory if\nneeded We've talked about the agents,\n\n28\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.890\nhow to deploy them.\n\n29\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.490\nGone through all of that stuff and\nif you haven't seen any of those or\n\n30\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.830\nall those episodes are the ones\nthat you may need.\n\n31\n00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.780\nAlways encourage you to go back,\n\n32\n00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.410\ntake a look quite a bit of information\nthat we've covered thus far.\n\n33\n00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.340\nWe've talked about being able to go\nthrough and being able to do upgrades and\n\n34\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.480\nmigrations.\n\n35\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.190\nDaniel helped us to work through the whole\ndifference there between the language and\n\n36\n00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.850\nthe meaning of upgrade versus migration.\n\n37\n00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.590\nWe've talked about being able to go\nthrough and look at and actually interact\n\n38\n00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.940\nwith and understand monitoring from\nseveral different perspectives importing\n\n39\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.230\nmanagement packs, understanding what goes\non with them, how they're built out,\n\n40\n00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.790\nwhy they're so important,\nwe continue those conversations.\n\n41\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.980\nWe actually have episodes\ncoming up later on.\n\n42\n00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.940\nI encourage you to take a look at them\nat some point about how to do some\n\n43\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.870\ncustom authoring on management packs.\n\n44\n00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.320\nPretty exciting and\ninteresting stuff there.\n\n45\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.250\nWe're gonna focus however\nnow on one of the core\n\n46\n00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.770\nrequirements that most\nbusinesses focus on with SCOM.\n\n47\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.530\nWhich is, hey we've got a stack of\napplications typically .NET related\n\n48\n00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.380\nWeb service related more often than not,\nbuilt on the Windows Communication,\n\n49\n00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.640\nfoundations, the WCF and ASP.NET.\n\n50\n00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.890\nAnd we wanna be able to monitor those,\nwell, that's good,\n\n51\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.880\ncuz that's what we do and we wanna be\nable to use the monitoring strength,\n\n52\n00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.430\nthe power of SCOM, of System Center\nOperations Manager to be able to do this.\n\n53\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.590\nThese applications are gonna be\nhosted in Microsoft IF servers, so\n\n54\n00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.090\nthey're web centric, wither version\nseven or version eight for IIS.\n\n55\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.450\nAnd these Windows services that\nare written using the dot net framework,\n\n56\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.280\nare specifically gonna be able to lend\nthemselves to this kind of monitoring.\n\n57\n00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.270\nSo it's important to take some time figure\nout how we're going to be able to do this.\n\n58\n00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.400\nWhat it looks like.\n\n59\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.500\nWhat some of the requirements may be.\n\n60\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.722\nWe may have some packs, for\ninstance that are going to be important.\n\n61\n00:03:05.722 --> 00:03:09.122\nAnd we're going to hopefully talk\na little bit about how we get this set up\n\n62\n00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:09.860\nand do that.\n\n63\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.280\nWe're also gonna take a look\nat end to end kinda some\n\n64\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.640\ndemonstration elements that help us\nto better understand how to do this.\n\n65\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.830\nBut we're gonna spend some time talking\nabout it first before we do any of that.\n\n66\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.905\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good enough.\n\n67\n00:03:20.905 --> 00:03:23.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, Adam, you mentioned IIS.\n\n68\n00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.200\nSo that I would assume is a requirement,\n\n69\n00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.470\nbut are there any other kind of\nmanagement pack requirements?\n\n70\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.200\nAbsolutely so\n\n71\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.690\nthere actually are four management packs\nthat we would wanna have imported.\n\n72\n00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.900\nWe've talked about how to do this in prior\nepisodes remember we can import management\n\n73\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.780\npacks either from disks,\n\n74\n00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.030\ntypically you would've downloaded\nthem had them available somewhere,\n\n75\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.750\nwalked you though how to do that,\ndid some demonstrations with that.\n\n76\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.160\nWe also can import them from a catalog,\nessentially going up to the web,\n\n77\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.380\ngetting them from Microsoft and\nbringing them in.\n\n78\n00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.210\nSo we'll assume that you know\nhow to do that at this point.\n\n79\n00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.640\nBut there are a four management\npacks we wanna have available.\n\n80\n00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.460\nThe Server 2008, IIS version 7,\nManagement Pack for IIS Applications,\n\n81\n00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.960\nbased on IIS 7,\nthe Microsoft System Center APM Web,\n\n82\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:13.180\nIIS version 7 Management Pack,\nthe Windows Server 12 IIS Version 8,\n\n83\n00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.710\nApplication Management Pack And\nSystemCenter APM Web IIS version 8.\n\n84\n00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:23.430\nSo we need the appropriate operating\nsystem IIS-centric Management Pack and\n\n85\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.110\nthen the SystemCenter APM Management Pack\nfor both version 7 and version 8 hosting.\n\n86\n00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.970\nAnd so, we'd import all of those and\nthen once we have those set up,\n\n87\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.250\nwe'd have access to the ability to\nstart using the APM monitoring.\n\n88\n00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.260\nSo we're gonna want to make\nsure we have those available.\n\n89\n00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.380\nAnd again, remember,\nwe can get those management packs\n\n90\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.570\nby either downloading them\ndirectly from Microsoft, or\n\n91\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.920\nimporting them off a disk\nonce we have them available.\n\n92\n00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.060\nEither way,\nwe're able to go out and get those.\n\n93\n00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.270\nAnd we have, in prior shows where we\ntalked about how to do this, actually\n\n94\n00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.140\nshown you the website where you can find\nthat list of all the management packs.\n\n95\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.710\nWe actually gave you that URL.\n\n96\n00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.730\nTook you out there, showed you how to\ndownload one, showed you the list there.\n\n97\n00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.430\nAnd we also put in another URL that\nactually gives you third party management\n\n98\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.840\npaths from outside that\nare not Microsoft-centric.\n\n99\n00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.720\nSo you do have the ability to go back,\ntake a look at that, if you need to.\n\n100\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.385\n&gt;&gt; Which is nice, because\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure since I'm new to this show\n\n101\n00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:23.665\nhere, I'm sure you've already mentioned to\neveryone that Microsoft has their Technet\n\n102\n00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:28.095\nwebsite with a lot of helpful information\nin case anyone gets stuck or has any kind\n\n103\n00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:32.620\nof custom situations that they may need\nto investigate a little bit further.\n\n104\n00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.920\nWe have extensively actually we're going\nto right now take a look at that website\n\n105\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.150\nor I should say actually right usually\ncan get this if I just there right?\n\n106\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.095\nUp there somewhere.\n\n107\n00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:45.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're going for\n\n108\n00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.390\nright there.\n\n109\n00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.945\nIt I'm never able to get that right.\n\n110\n00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:48.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n111\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.900\nI have to tie one of my hands off and\nonly use one going in the right direction.\n\n112\n00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.760\nSo we have been talking extensively\nthroughout all the episodes we'll continue\n\n113\n00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.840\nto That's when [INAUDIBLE] present\ninformation to you [INAUDIBLE] use.\n\n114\n00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.380\nMicrosoft System Center,\nnew data center monitoring,\n\n115\n00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.750\nwe've been talking about the value of\nthe documentation Microsoft has out there.\n\n116\n00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.040\nThe real estate in other words on\nthe webs, Cherokee was just suggesting\n\n117\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.660\nthrough TechNet pretty much primarily,\nthere are a couple of other sites here and\n\n118\n00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.030\nthere we've looked at but the MSDN library\nfor instance, we have taken a look at.\n\n119\n00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.050\nWe will look at in future episodes.\n\n120\n00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.380\nWith regards to some of the functionality,\nthere's some cross over here\n\n121\n00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.150\nwith using Visual Studio to do\nmanagement pack authoring for instance.\n\n122\n00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.200\nAnd be able to sign management packs,\nso it's a few other areas we look at.\n\n123\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.295\nBut primarily It is tech net.\n\n124\n00:06:33.295 --> 00:06:35.585\nYou could see on the screen\nhere in front of you,\n\n125\n00:06:35.585 --> 00:06:40.155\nwe're talking about monitoring with APN,\ndoing .NET application monitoring.\n\n126\n00:06:40.155 --> 00:06:43.555\nThere's a lot of detail that you're\ngonna want to take a look at, and\n\n127\n00:06:43.555 --> 00:06:45.182\njust make sure you're up to date on.\n\n128\n00:06:45.182 --> 00:06:48.482\nAnd as we've talked about in prior\nepisodes, depending on when you actually\n\n129\n00:06:48.482 --> 00:06:53.372\nwatch an episode, it will be partinate\ncertainly at the time you watch it, but\n\n130\n00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:57.242\nsome of the information on the product\nmay be outdated, there may be an update,\n\n131\n00:06:57.242 --> 00:07:00.132\na service pack, a slight change in this or\n\n132\n00:07:00.132 --> 00:07:03.162\nthat particular activity or\nthought process.\n\n133\n00:07:03.162 --> 00:07:06.482\nWe refer to the web because we\nwanna have you have the ability to\n\n134\n00:07:06.482 --> 00:07:09.230\nbe able to find those recent and\nupdated information.\n\n135\n00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.950\nIn case something slightly changes.\n\n136\n00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.360\nSo all the URLs we look at are always\nin the Show Notes for you.\n\n137\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.430\nThat way you can go out and validate that\nwhat we're talking about is still actually\n\n138\n00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.240\nidentical to what we did two months,\nsix months, seven months ago,\n\n139\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.680\nwhenever it is that we put the show in\nthe cam before you got to watch it.\n\n140\n00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.330\nAnd then if it's not, at least you\nhave the most recent reference, and\n\n141\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.970\nyou can fine tune the knowledge.\n\n142\n00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.910\nBased on just the slight changes\nthat may be out with a product\n\n143\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.360\nat any given moment in time.\n\n144\n00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.160\nSo when we're doing .NET monitoring,\n\n145\n00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.090\nthere are some things we wanna know ahead\nof time, right, before we get started.\n\n146\n00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.710\nThis website, Citation from Tech now will\nhelp us just focus in on some of things.\n\n147\n00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.930\nWe talked about knowing\nthe packs you need to import.\n\n148\n00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.900\nSo they're listed here.\n\n149\n00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.950\nWe talked about them, IS7, IS8.\n\n150\n00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.920\nRemember that we have different\nversions of S-COM or SCOM.\n\n151\n00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.390\nLike sound like Daniel.\n\n152\n00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:58.852\nEzcom [LAUGH] That we maybe.\n\n153\n00:07:58.852 --> 00:08:01.458\nI never called it EZcom til' I\nstarted doing the show with them.\n\n154\n00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:04.189\nWe said Zcom,\nnow we say EZcom because well you know.\n\n155\n00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:06.124\nHe's big and imposing and\nif you say this you can't.\n\n156\n00:08:06.124 --> 00:08:07.599\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't say it his way,\n\n157\n00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:08.606\nhe's liable to get upset.\n\n158\n00:08:08.606 --> 00:08:11.655\nSo with\nMicrosoft System Center Ops Manager,\n\n159\n00:08:11.655 --> 00:08:15.887\nwe talked about the fact that\nyou'll need both IIS7 and IIS8.\n\n160\n00:08:15.887 --> 00:08:18.560\nAnd the focus on the web\nmanagement capabilities and\n\n161\n00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.100\ntherefore the management path\nassociated with those versions.\n\n162\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.128\nBut remember there are different\nversions of System Center Ops Manager.\n\n163\n00:08:25.128 --> 00:08:28.730\nWe've talked about 20 or 2007 R2.\n\n164\n00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.677\nComing out of that older platform\nmigrating into either 12, 12 SP1,\n\n165\n00:08:33.677 --> 00:08:35.495\nor now hopefully 12 R2.\n\n166\n00:08:35.495 --> 00:08:39.780\nCuz that's where we're spending our time\ntalking about and interacting with around\n\n167\n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.210\nall of our episodes and of course,\nthere's 2016 that is out in market now.\n\n168\n00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.570\nSo you've got many different\nversions that are available to you.\n\n169\n00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.810\nSo a lot of times there'll be guidance in\nwebsites we take a look at that says hey,\n\n170\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.550\nif you're on specifically 12 SP1,\n\n171\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.350\nmake sure you take note\nof this particular thing.\n\n172\n00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.650\nIf you're on 12 R2, note this.\n\n173\n00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.670\nAnd so you wanna make sure\nbased on version specificity\n\n174\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.910\nthat you are able to zero in on\nthe right amount of information.\n\n175\n00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.160\nSo the websites are usually very\nhelpful about this as well,\n\n176\n00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.570\nso just take note of that.\n\n177\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.760\nWe're going to go into the environment\nhere in a minute and take a look.\n\n178\n00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.610\nI'll just give you a high level thought\nprocess of what this looks like.\n\n179\n00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.320\nWe’re going to do a full run through and\na demo on this in a separate episode.\n\n180\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.080\nSo just understand we're not\ngoing to go all the way through,\n\n181\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.090\nhey how do we setup APM and N.\n\n182\n00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.500\nBut we are gonna take a look\nat just the idea behind it.\n\n183\n00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.385\nBut you'll see here on the website,\nwe have a little screen capture.\n\n184\n00:09:31.385 --> 00:09:34.710\nWe just roll down a little more, so\nyou can see that above my box here.\n\n185\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.758\nIt's ASP.NET Web\nApplication Inventory View.\n\n186\n00:09:36.758 --> 00:09:42.370\nWe're in the monitoring area here,\nwe've got our application monitoring here.\n\n187\n00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.080\nAnd then below under the .NET monitoring,\nwe could see that there are different\n\n188\n00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.190\nviews that will be available for\nIIS ASP.NET 7, 8.\n\n189\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.930\nThis comes from the management\npacks being imported.\n\n190\n00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.240\nSo, just want to make sure\nwe're familiar with this.\n\n191\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.660\nAs always, the website's will have\nlinks to different information.\n\n192\n00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.740\nHow do we check for app compatibility or\nfor compatibility for\n\n193\n00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.080\nclient hind sight monitoring.\n\n194\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.200\nSo we've got some information\non how to do that.\n\n195\n00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.500\nWe've also got a link here how to\nconfigure monitoring for .NET apps.\n\n196\n00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.160\nWe're gonna take a look at that, and\nhow to start monitoring a new application.\n\n197\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.235\nSo always good to take a look\nat what's out on the web\n\n198\n00:10:16.235 --> 00:10:19.385\nMaking sure we know how\nto use the information.\n\n199\n00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:22.985\nHow to configure monitoring for\n.NET app link will take you here.\n\n200\n00:10:22.985 --> 00:10:23.733\nHow to set it up.\n\n201\n00:10:23.733 --> 00:10:26.255\nI am gonna demo the beginning\nof this thought process for\n\n202\n00:10:26.255 --> 00:10:29.730\nyou and then we'll go through\nactually take a look at it.\n\n203\n00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.510\nBut we can go in to the authoring area,\nas you will see here,\n\n204\n00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.375\nuse the .NET application\nperformance monitoring template.\n\n205\n00:10:36.375 --> 00:10:40.660\nRight-click at the monitor, we go through\nthe wizard, kind of figure it out.\n\n206\n00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.710\nAnd specify information that allows us to\n\n207\n00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.530\nattach to whatever instance of\nan application we want to monitor.\n\n208\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.980\nAnd then set up the monitoring,\nand of course consume that data.\n\n209\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:51.742\nNow with that,\n\n210\n00:10:51.742 --> 00:10:56.520\nwe're gonna have two other consoles and\nwe have talked about consoles before.\n\n211\n00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.330\nJust bring the image up that we have been\nusing here to refer to our architecture\n\n212\n00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.400\nand we've gone through this\nin many different episodes.\n\n213\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.900\nYou'll see me and hear me continue to\nrefer to this in upcoming episodes\n\n214\n00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.480\nas we talk about other\nelements of architecture.\n\n215\n00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.380\nBut the idea here is that remember,\nwe have our consoles, right?\n\n216\n00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.440\nWe have our ops and web console up here.\n\n217\n00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.260\nWe didn't add the other two\nconsoles into the diagram but\n\n218\n00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.990\nwe know there's a total of four of them.\n\n219\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.820\nWe do have the application advisor and\napplication diagnostics consoles as well.\n\n220\n00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.720\nThey would just in theory be sitting\nthere allowing us to interact with them.\n\n221\n00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.230\nI do show you how to use these and\nwe do discuss them in other episodes.\n\n222\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.460\nSo you're gonna interact with them and\nwant to know about them.\n\n223\n00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.310\nBut remember the consoles are available\nfor us to connect into one or\n\n224\n00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.410\nboth of our databases depending\non what we are doing,\n\n225\n00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.040\nconsuming reports obviously we've\ntalked extensively about this.\n\n226\n00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.960\nWe'd continue to interacting with one or\nmore management servers either outside,\n\n227\n00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.590\nthrough the gateway, or\ndirectly here inside the pool.\n\n228\n00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.960\nAnd we are then able to\ninteract with the information.\n\n229\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.110\nThe application advisor and\napplication diagnostic consoles\n\n230\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.970\nhelp us trouble shoot performance\nissues with applications.\n\n231\n00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:09.300\nSo they're tied directly\nto this idea of using APM.\n\n232\n00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.630\nBut we need to have the web console\ndeployed The Ops Manager web console.\n\n233\n00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.310\nOne of the two we've listed\nhere has to be installed and\n\n234\n00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.185\ndeployed for\nus to be able to use these other consoles.\n\n235\n00:12:20.185 --> 00:12:24.130\nSo in our very first set of\nepisodes talked about overview and\n\n236\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:29.050\narchitecture, ran through a whole\nseries of hands on how tos.\n\n237\n00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.925\nConfigured and installed every version or\nevery Product rather,\n\n238\n00:12:32.925 --> 00:12:35.494\nin the system center suite in 2012 R2.\n\n239\n00:12:35.494 --> 00:12:39.009\nAnd one of the things we did is we\nactually walked through the install\n\n240\n00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.487\nconfiguration of\nSystems Center Ops Manager.\n\n241\n00:12:41.487 --> 00:12:43.646\nAnd we took a look at how\nto install the consoles,\n\n242\n00:12:43.646 --> 00:12:45.550\nin what order we would install them.\n\n243\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.230\nRemember we can install our\nfirst management server with or\n\n244\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.820\nwithout the ops console.\n\n245\n00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.760\nSecond and additional management servers\ninto the management group, with or\n\n246\n00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.200\nwithout the ops console.\n\n247\n00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.990\nBut the web console would be installed\ntypically as a separate step\n\n248\n00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.210\nafter the fact.\n\n249\n00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.360\nAnd so you'd wanna make sure you have\nthat done cuz that is gonna be a pre-req.\n\n250\n00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.570\nWe wanna make sure that we're just aware\nof that as part of hey, how do we set up?\n\n251\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.475\nAnd how do we get ready to use APM?\n\n252\n00:13:10.475 --> 00:13:13.515\nCuz you're gonna wanna use these\nother consoles to deal with some of\n\n253\n00:13:13.515 --> 00:13:16.790\nthe troubleshooting aspects that\nthe monitoring may uncover.\n\n254\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.720\nApplication performance\nissues can take a variety\n\n255\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.120\nof different approaches in terms of\ntheir impact to our organization.\n\n256\n00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.990\nThey can slow down application\ninteractivity, they can slow down usage.\n\n257\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.400\nThey can become a bottleneck in\nother words in various places and\n\n258\n00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.140\nthis can lead to concern.\n\n259\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:39.660\nSo making sure we're using every aspect of\nour monitoring capabilities through APM\n\n260\n00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.470\nto find these issues.\n\n261\n00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.670\nAnd then when appropriate,\n\n262\n00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.760\ntroubleshoot them, is gonna be\nan important part of what we do.\n\n263\n00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.660\nSo I just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that,\n\n264\n00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.750\nwe do use the wizard to do the .NET\nmonitoring as we were indicating.\n\n265\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.700\nAnd we're gonna take a look at how\nto set this up with that template.\n\n266\n00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.060\nWe also wanna make sure,\nlet's come back out here real quick.\n\n267\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.090\nDo that double tap on my click.\n\n268\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.280\nSo we do wanna make sure that once we\ngo through we set up our performance\n\n269\n00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.370\nmonitoring here, and\nwe go through the steps.\n\n270\n00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.310\nYou obviously have a nice\nlittle how to here.\n\n271\n00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.890\nWe're gonna demo this for\nyou in real time in an upcoming episode.\n\n272\n00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.990\nBut once we've done that if we need\nto then do additional customization\n\n273\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.390\nwe could do some additional tweaking here.\n\n274\n00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:24.360\nSo we talked a bit about this with server\nside versus client side monitoring and\n\n275\n00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.910\nthe perspective for both.\n\n276\n00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:30.020\nAnd so we're able to go through and\nsee both sides of this operation.\n\n277\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.990\nWhat does the app look\nlike from the client side?\n\n278\n00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.390\nWhat does it look like on the server side?\n\n279\n00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.180\nAnd how do we then make\nsure that when we monitor,\n\n280\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.140\nwe're seeing performance\nfrom both perspectives.\n\n281\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.550\nBecause a lot of times,\nit will run it being the app,\n\n282\n00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:46.160\nthe app will be seemingly\nrunning well on the server side.\n\n283\n00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.270\nLooks like all of indicators are good,\n\n284\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:52.160\neverything seems to be okay,\nour resource pool seems to be good.\n\n285\n00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.430\nMemory usage seems to be within boundary,\n\n286\n00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.200\nseem to have good IO input\noutput good bandwidth, etc.\n\n287\n00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.520\nAll that stuff is good but\n\n288\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.500\nthe client's complaining hey the app\ndoesn't seem to be responding well.\n\n289\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.860\nAnd so we have to think about the fact\nthat sometimes that's legitimate.\n\n290\n00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.230\nUsers are complaining,\nthere is a legitimate concern.\n\n291\n00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.790\nSometimes, yeah,\n\n292\n00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.450\nwe've all have this happened as\nIT Administrators, users are complaining.\n\n293\n00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.040\nWe go look under the hood and\nwe ascertain there is nothing wrong and\n\n294\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.080\nthe users are just in their\nmind they are having a problem.\n\n295\n00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.825\nI'm not suggesting that they\ndon't think something is wrong.\n\n296\n00:15:24.825 --> 00:15:28.130\nBut wink, wink, nod, nod,\nnudge, nudge, right?\n\n297\n00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.840\nWe know they're kind of\nmaybe not perceiving things\n\n298\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.330\nthe way that we would perceive them,\nright?\n\n299\n00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.130\nSo want to be able to monitor\nfrom both sides of this divide.\n\n300\n00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.448\nIt's gonna be very important for\nus to do this.\n\n301\n00:15:38.448 --> 00:15:41.740\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of funny you bring that up,\nAdam, because sometimes like you said that\n\n302\n00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.500\nperception from the client\nversus the back end.\n\n303\n00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.100\nI saw this funny meme online where\nrhere is a rock near a shoreline and\n\n304\n00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.440\nthere's this beautiful siren or mermaid.\n\n305\n00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.763\nOr at least what it appeared to be on\nthe front side she's leaning up against\n\n306\n00:15:54.763 --> 00:15:55.308\nthat rock.\n\n307\n00:15:55.308 --> 00:15:56.498\nAnd on the back,\n\n308\n00:15:56.498 --> 00:16:02.535\nwas this horrific dragon style bobby in\nthe front of that image said client side.\n\n309\n00:16:02.535 --> 00:16:03.532\nAnd then the back end there.\n\n310\n00:16:03.532 --> 00:16:05.951\nAnd I know that's very drastic,\nbut it's very true.\n\n311\n00:16:05.951 --> 00:16:07.479\n&gt;&gt; It's a drastic dragon?\n\n312\n00:16:07.479 --> 00:16:08.962\n&gt;&gt; A drastic dragon.\n\n313\n00:16:08.962 --> 00:16:10.048\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A drastic dragon.\n\n314\n00:16:10.048 --> 00:16:11.328\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n315\n00:16:11.328 --> 00:16:15.971\nGeek humor, it's not always the best,\nbut it has some truth behind it.\n\n316\n00:16:15.971 --> 00:16:17.188\nGet it, behind it?\n\n317\n00:16:17.188 --> 00:16:19.519\n&gt;&gt; Behind it, drastic dragon from behind.\n\n318\n00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:23.646\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So listen, users are both the joy and\n\n319\n00:16:23.646 --> 00:16:26.720\nthe pain of being in IT, right?\n\n320\n00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.785\nIf you're a parent you understand this\nbecause it's the same thought process.\n\n321\n00:16:29.785 --> 00:16:31.171\nWhen you have kids, you love them.\n\n322\n00:16:31.171 --> 00:16:35.099\nBut you understand why in the wild certain\nanimals eat their young at certain points\n\n323\n00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:36.310\nin time, right?\n\n324\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.600\nSo the reality is that we love users,\nright?\n\n325\n00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.130\nBut we also understand that they are gonna\n\n326\n00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.200\nperceive things that may\nnot always be there.\n\n327\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.460\nAnd so we wanna understand how to validate\nand create in our minds and the minds\n\n328\n00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.260\nof our community that we're supporting as\nIT professionals using a tool like this,\n\n329\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:00.200\nvalidity around real hard core performance\nissues that have to be addressed.\n\n330\n00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.810\nBut also dispel rumor, myth, and\nlegend around things that really are not\n\n331\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.990\nhappening, and not happening for\nthe reasons that people will say they are.\n\n332\n00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.570\nUsers can tell me they don't feel that\nthey're getting good performance.\n\n333\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:16.070\nBut if I can validate, in other words,\nwith dashboard views, with monitoring,\n\n334\n00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.170\nperformance views.\n\n335\n00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.447\nAll the things that we have talked about,\n\n336\n00:17:19.447 --> 00:17:23.687\ncontinue to talk about as we expand our\nknowledge of how to use System Center.\n\n337\n00:17:23.687 --> 00:17:28.312\nNot just Ops Manager, but all of\nthe suite of tools associated with it.\n\n338\n00:17:28.312 --> 00:17:31.029\nThen we can pull in those data\npoints from different places.\n\n339\n00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:34.381\nWe've shown you some detailed\nreports in episodes to date.\n\n340\n00:17:34.381 --> 00:17:37.220\nI'm gonna show you some\nadditional ones going forward.\n\n341\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.750\nThere is a wealth of data sitting in\nthe data warehouse database that could be\n\n342\n00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.840\nqueried once we set up and\ninitialize monitoring.\n\n343\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.675\nWe can pull that data in and\nCherokee makes a great point.\n\n344\n00:17:48.675 --> 00:17:51.939\nBy using this data to show,\nright, the reality,\n\n345\n00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:54.209\nthe horror of the back end dragon.\n\n346\n00:17:54.209 --> 00:17:58.958\nBut also dispel the myth of just how\nthat dragon may or may not be perceived.\n\n347\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:01.832\nWe can hopefully turn the corner\nwith people, and listen,\n\n348\n00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:04.320\nusers are always gonna be\nthe way they are, right?\n\n349\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.320\nThey're always gonna say, yeah,\nit sucks and it's your fault.\n\n350\n00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.423\nBut the reality is if we can\ndispel that myth, we could at\n\n351\n00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:14.531\nleast set a baseline that says, look,\nthe application is running well.\n\n352\n00:18:14.531 --> 00:18:16.578\nYou may not perceive it as being okay.\n\n353\n00:18:16.578 --> 00:18:18.503\nLet's talk about the reasons why.\n\n354\n00:18:18.503 --> 00:18:22.159\nBut let's talk about things we can do as\nopposed to things you think are happening\n\n355\n00:18:22.159 --> 00:18:23.087\nthat just aren't.\n\n356\n00:18:23.087 --> 00:18:25.330\nAnd that's one of the values\nof this kind of a tool.\n\n357\n00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.808\nIt's very important to think about that.\n\n358\n00:18:26.808 --> 00:18:29.819\nAnd it's to that end, if we just go back\nand take a look at couple more areas.\n\n359\n00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:32.552\nI was talking about\nthe Apps Diagnostic console,\n\n360\n00:18:32.552 --> 00:18:35.553\nthe Application specifically\nDiagnostics console.\n\n361\n00:18:35.553 --> 00:18:38.270\nWe do have a link to it here,\ncan say a little bit about it.\n\n362\n00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:41.535\nIf you haven't seen it yet, as I said,\nwe have demoed it in a couple different\n\n363\n00:18:41.535 --> 00:18:43.968\nepisodes for you,\nencourage you to take a look at those.\n\n364\n00:18:43.968 --> 00:18:49.570\nBut you can open them up and you'll see\nhere, our URL is gonna be right here.\n\n365\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.659\nHTTP or TPS, whichever it is,\nweb host, ops manager,\n\n366\n00:18:53.659 --> 00:18:58.446\nthat is going to be for our format,\ntypically, how we will go in.\n\n367\n00:18:58.446 --> 00:19:02.070\nAnd then you'll see here that's just\nto console for the web console.\n\n368\n00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:06.816\nThe Apps Diagnostic console,\nHTTPS host Apps Diagnostic and\n\n369\n00:19:06.816 --> 00:19:10.385\nthe App Adviser,\nHTTPS Webhost App Adviser.\n\n370\n00:19:10.385 --> 00:19:12.043\nYou'll see those both right there.\n\n371\n00:19:12.043 --> 00:19:13.610\nThere in the show notes for you as well.\n\n372\n00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.883\nWe've reproduced them there for you,\ntell you what they are so you know.\n\n373\n00:19:16.883 --> 00:19:19.207\nBut you can go down, you can take a look.\n\n374\n00:19:19.207 --> 00:19:23.042\nWe can view areas of interest by events,\ngroup areas of interest, and\n\n375\n00:19:23.042 --> 00:19:24.720\nthen interact with them.\n\n376\n00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.740\nThis is what the console looks like,\nif you haven't seen it yet.\n\n377\n00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:33.420\nYou can see right there that we go in,\n\n378\n00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:38.760\nwe're able to see our application group\non the left here, in the nav area.\n\n379\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.060\nWe're able to fill in some parameters so\n\n380\n00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.430\nwe can figure out how we wanna filter and\ngroup.\n\n381\n00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.210\nAnd then over here,\nwe're able to see issues and concerns.\n\n382\n00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.550\nWe're then able to drill down on these.\n\n383\n00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.568\nFind information out by going through and\n\n384\n00:19:51.568 --> 00:19:55.208\nessentially drilling through these\nitems and reading up more about them.\n\n385\n00:19:55.208 --> 00:19:59.760\nAnd we could then go in and we can, based\non what we see, decide to take action.\n\n386\n00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.210\nOr, whatever the case may be.\n\n387\n00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.930\nSo we can go in,\nyou'll see that it shows grouping\n\n388\n00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.265\napplication orders by\ndifferent functionally groups.\n\n389\n00:20:07.265 --> 00:20:09.290\nYou'll see here Computers, Applications,\n\n390\n00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:14.875\nEvents, Advisor, with different categories\nand workspaces we can interact around.\n\n391\n00:20:14.875 --> 00:20:18.903\nAnd so we're able to go in and\nget detailed diagnostic\n\n392\n00:20:18.903 --> 00:20:23.838\ninformation when we are using one\nof these particular consoles.\n\n393\n00:20:23.838 --> 00:20:28.127\nWe can also prioritize alerts by\nusing the Application Advisor.\n\n394\n00:20:28.127 --> 00:20:32.325\nSo we can go in and say hey, these\nparticular alerts are gonna be important.\n\n395\n00:20:32.325 --> 00:20:33.407\nLet's pay attention them.\n\n396\n00:20:33.407 --> 00:20:36.327\nWe can go ahead and\nscope and run this report.\n\n397\n00:20:36.327 --> 00:20:39.613\nFilter it in such a way that we're\nable to tell exactly what it is\n\n398\n00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:40.676\nwe are looking for.\n\n399\n00:20:40.676 --> 00:20:44.207\nAnd so when we do this, down here, oops.\n\n400\n00:20:44.207 --> 00:20:45.988\nWe can go through,\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n401\n00:20:45.988 --> 00:20:48.070\nWe don't have a pretty\npicture on this one.\n\n402\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.651\nBut we can go in, we can use the console\nto then be able to generate a list\n\n403\n00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:54.748\nprioritized based on issues and\n\n404\n00:20:54.748 --> 00:20:58.334\nconcerns that we can then\ncreate action items around.\n\n405\n00:20:58.334 --> 00:21:02.250\nAnd then use either SCOM itself or\nother tools associated with SCOM.\n\n406\n00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.920\nI'm thinking service manager for instance.\n\n407\n00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.800\nI'm thinking virtual machine manager for\nprivate cloud fabric.\n\n408\n00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.140\nAnd we can go in,\nperhaps data protection manager,\n\n409\n00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.330\nif we have an issue where we have to\nensure we have a backup going on.\n\n410\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.460\nSystem Center config manager, if we\nhave to worry about doing a deployment\n\n411\n00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.100\nof an application or a virtual machine or\nsomething to that end.\n\n412\n00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.998\nWhatever the case may be, we can go ahead\nand we can use those to then be able\n\n413\n00:21:25.998 --> 00:21:30.355\nto drill down and achieve more\nfocused remediation if required.\n\n414\n00:21:30.355 --> 00:21:33.170\nWe also have the ability to\nbe able to use IntelliTrace.\n\n415\n00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:37.010\nSo we'll talk about IntelliTrace,\ncouple of different areas.\n\n416\n00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:41.753\nWe talk about it specifically because\nwe can use IntelliTrace to collect and\n\n417\n00:21:41.753 --> 00:21:45.914\nget debug logs from applications,\npart of this thought process.\n\n418\n00:21:45.914 --> 00:21:50.466\nAnd we can then throw those\nover into Visual Studio.\n\n419\n00:21:50.466 --> 00:21:53.805\nAnd we can use them in Visual Studio,\n\n420\n00:21:53.805 --> 00:21:59.208\nthrough Visual Studio to TFS,\nTeam Foundation Services.\n\n421\n00:21:59.208 --> 00:22:02.526\nAnd with Team Foundation Services,\nor the TFS server,\n\n422\n00:22:02.526 --> 00:22:06.833\nwhat we can do is we can create work\nitems for managing our dev cycles in our\n\n423\n00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:10.659\nworkflow in the dev environment,\nout of the IntelliTrace log.\n\n424\n00:22:10.659 --> 00:22:14.278\nSo that we can actually use the debugging\nto create the opportunity for\n\n425\n00:22:14.278 --> 00:22:18.580\nus to then tell our dev team, hey, we\nneed to go in and deal with these issues.\n\n426\n00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.696\nAnd so we can link these two together and\n\n427\n00:22:20.696 --> 00:22:23.722\nthis is again one of the strengths\nof this kind of a tool.\n\n428\n00:22:23.722 --> 00:22:25.953\nBecause when we go in and we collect and\n\n429\n00:22:25.953 --> 00:22:30.647\nyou can see right here historical data\nfrom System Center using IntelliTrace.\n\n430\n00:22:30.647 --> 00:22:34.090\nWe do have to turn this on and\nit does have to be enabled.\n\n431\n00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:38.660\nBut once we've done this, we can take\nthis data and we can then have it spawn\n\n432\n00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:43.290\nwork items in our workflow for\nus in our thought process on the dev side.\n\n433\n00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.940\nThis is essentially DevOps, right.\n\n434\n00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.590\nThis is what we do, we link the Dev and\nthe Ops environment together and\n\n435\n00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.290\nthis is our way of doing this.\n\n436\n00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.170\nThis is a very powerful\nthought process here as well,\n\n437\n00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.414\nbecause we can do historical profiling.\n\n438\n00:22:55.414 --> 00:22:59.352\nGrab these snapshots and\nthen move them over to the dev team and\n\n439\n00:22:59.352 --> 00:23:02.240\ngive them the opportunity\nto work with them.\n\n440\n00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.390\n&gt;&gt; This is a really powerful tool, Adam.\n\n441\n00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.100\nWe're able to take and\nremove the guesswork out of it.\n\n442\n00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.089\nWe're able to obtain quantitative data.\n\n443\n00:23:09.089 --> 00:23:14.169\nAnd really get a clear overview and\nas-is picture about what's going on,\n\n444\n00:23:14.169 --> 00:23:16.517\nwhat issues need to be addressed.\n\n445\n00:23:16.517 --> 00:23:18.255\n&gt;&gt; That was just me pausing for\na simple water while Cherokee was talking.\n\n446\n00:23:18.255 --> 00:23:19.124\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n447\n00:23:19.124 --> 00:23:19.741\n&gt;&gt; No problem.\n\n448\n00:23:19.741 --> 00:23:21.399\n&gt;&gt; I should've given you\nan extra second Adam [LAUGH].\n\n449\n00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:23.233\n&gt;&gt; That's the magic behind\nthe scene you don't see,\n\n450\n00:23:23.233 --> 00:23:24.520\nthat's why we go to a small screen.\n\n451\n00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.843\nIf you saw the whole screen, you'd see\nall the other people running around in\n\n452\n00:23:27.843 --> 00:23:31.490\nthe studio you never see that are back\nbehind us making all the magic happen.\n\n453\n00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.220\nSo yes, it is such a powerful tool.\n\n454\n00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.974\nAnd it is the ability for us to be able\nto really create an end to end, this is\n\n455\n00:23:38.974 --> 00:23:44.450\nthe thought process we have in end to end\nservice monitor for the lifecycle, right?\n\n456\n00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.645\nAnd we're looking at not just\ntaking debug log information but\n\n457\n00:23:47.645 --> 00:23:49.337\nreal time performance metrics.\n\n458\n00:23:49.337 --> 00:23:53.881\nAnd all sorts of data points together to\nthen be able to take this idea of APM,\n\n459\n00:23:53.881 --> 00:23:58.570\nthe application performance monitoring,\nand use it to bracket and filter and\n\n460\n00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.870\nthen drive our discussions\naround remediation.\n\n461\n00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:02.629\nFor web services.\n\n462\n00:24:02.629 --> 00:24:04.577\nSo it is a very valuable\nthought process for us.\n\n463\n00:24:04.577 --> 00:24:09.390\nOne that we wanna make sure\nwe take maximum advantage of.\n\n464\n00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.320\nHow we can integrate\nour operations manager,\n\n465\n00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.100\nas I was saying,\nwith our dev thought processes here.\n\n466\n00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.370\nIt's kind of the last\nthought process we have.\n\n467\n00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.260\nThis idea of integrating with TFS,\nas I suggested,\n\n468\n00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:25.050\nwe support this in TFS 2010,\nin 2012 and 2013.\n\n469\n00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:29.640\nSo the more recent versions, we're up\nto Visual Studio 2017 I think now.\n\n470\n00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.720\nBut we do support interaction and\n\n471\n00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.940\nintegration with the platform out through\nthe most recent revs of these products.\n\n472\n00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.770\nAnd we are linking System Center,\nspecifically Ops Manager, which really\n\n473\n00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:44.000\nbecomes the hub of communication and\ninformation exchange outs.\n\n474\n00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.160\nAll of the peripheral elements, not\njust of System Center, but of the other\n\n475\n00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.050\nsupporting products outside of System\nCenter like Visual Studio, like TFS.\n\n476\n00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.360\nSome of you may not work in an environment\nwhere you do a lot of internal dev.\n\n477\n00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.032\nSo you may not be in a big enough business\nwhere you have your own internal app\n\n478\n00:25:00.032 --> 00:25:00.810\ndev team.\n\n479\n00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:03.030\nYou may outsource app\ndev to another entity.\n\n480\n00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.890\nThat doesn't mean you can't\ntake advantage of this,\n\n481\n00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.600\nit just means you may not have a need for\nit right now.\n\n482\n00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.980\nIf you're not in the hey,\nwe build web apps for a living business,\n\n483\n00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.990\nthen APM just may not be technology\nthat makes a lot of sense for you.\n\n484\n00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.760\nBut most of us without exception\n\n485\n00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.740\nhave applications that we interact\nwith that are web-centric today.\n\n486\n00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.850\nThe question is not so\n\n487\n00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.270\nmuch, should I be doing the monitoring\nwith my own infrastructure.\n\n488\n00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:30.399\nThe question is, who's gonna do the\nmonitoring for me, if not me, then who?\n\n489\n00:25:30.399 --> 00:25:31.500\nIn other words, right?\n\n490\n00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:36.780\nBecause if we're hosting this in Azure,\nin the equivalent platform on AWS, or\n\n491\n00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.240\nwherever we may be hosting, it may not be\na Microsoft Center Solution, that's okay.\n\n492\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.210\nThere is a world outside of Microsoft,\nright.\n\n493\n00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.810\nWherever you're hosting\nyour web applications,\n\n494\n00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.680\nthat vendor has to provide this\nkind of capability for you.\n\n495\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:56.860\nWe've talked about, in other episodes,\nthe idea of the Ops Manager Suite online.\n\n496\n00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:01.651\nAnd the ability to use essentially your\nanalytics to be able to do ops monitoring\n\n497\n00:26:01.651 --> 00:26:03.050\nfrom the cloud.\n\n498\n00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.610\nEither from the user fabric\ndown into your private cloud,\n\n499\n00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.240\nif you're hybrid hosting in both places.\n\n500\n00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.140\nFrom your on-prem into the cloud,\nif you're hosting with Microsoft but\n\n501\n00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.620\nmaintain monitoring\ninfrastructure on-prem.\n\n502\n00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:20.010\nOr if you're doing private cloud,\nonly monitor on-prem yourself.\n\n503\n00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.240\nWell we've talked about the ability\nto use the Azure fabric and\n\n504\n00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.050\nleverage the Ops Manager Suite.\n\n505\n00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:30.290\nAzure Analytics and\nAzure Log Data Monitoring and\n\n506\n00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:34.405\nAzure Recovery and all of the different\nthings we went through in that discussion.\n\n507\n00:26:34.405 --> 00:26:36.710\nThere's a lot of value in\nleveraging the web today.\n\n508\n00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.230\nAnd it's not just about,\nI need to install, have it local and\n\n509\n00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:41.300\nthat's all I do anymore.\n\n510\n00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.750\nIt's about, where is my data?\n\n511\n00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.320\nWhere are my applications?\n\n512\n00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.050\nHow am I gonna monitor them and\n\n513\n00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.000\nhow am I gonna understand\nwhat's happening with them.\n\n514\n00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.960\nSo you gotta figure out ultimately\nwhat the best approach is.\n\n515\n00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.260\nAnd it may not be\nSystem Center Ops Manager on-prem,\n\n516\n00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:00.310\nisolated running a privately\nhosted private cloud on-prem.\n\n517\n00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.740\nYou may very well today have a private\ncloud that's hosted by a third-party\n\n518\n00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.550\ncompany on your behalf.\n\n519\n00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.480\nYou could still use these tools\nto monitor into the cloud.\n\n520\n00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.880\nWe talked about the usual\nmanagement packs and\n\n521\n00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.850\nthe integration of the Azure fabric\ninto your monitoring solution.\n\n522\n00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.240\nThis concept with APM is just\nanother ripple in that fabric,\n\n523\n00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.800\nanother extension of\nthat monitoring out and\n\n524\n00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.320\ntaking advantage of the web and\nweb-related application services.\n\n525\n00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.470\nJust a matter of how you\nchoose to approach that.\n\n526\n00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.098\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Adam for\ntaking the time to explain.\n\n527\n00:27:29.098 --> 00:27:31.780\nI now know what application\nperformance monitoring is, and\n\n528\n00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.850\nI really just can't wait to get\nsome hands-on demonstration here.\n\n529\n00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.620\nSo ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n530\n00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.510\nBut for this show we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n531\n00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.980\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n532\n00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.080\n&gt;&gt; That would be me.\n\n533\n00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.500\nI'm not Cherokee Boose, but I am wearing a\nvery bright lovely, from what I was told.\n\n534\n00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes!\n&gt;&gt; Lovely,\n\n535\n00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.867\nlovely bright shirt which\nmakes me Mister Lovely.\n\n536\n00:27:51.867 --> 00:27:54.703\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See you next time here ITProTV.\n\n537\n00:27:54.703 --> 00:27:55.808\nBye.\n\n538\n00:27:55.808 --> 00:27:56.349\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n539\n00:27:56.349 --> 00:28:03.401\n[MUSIC]\n\n540\n00:28:03.401 --> 00:28:06.047\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:11.954\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:13.697\n[SOUND] Welcome ladies and\n\n5\n00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:18.680\ngentlemen to your Datacenter Monitoring\nwith Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.670\n&gt;&gt; That's tough to say.\n\n7\n00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.480\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n8\n00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm your show host,\n\n9\n00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.500\nCherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.190\nAnd, in this episode, Mr. Adam Gordon\nis actually going to be showing us\n\n11\n00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.410\nhow to use APM to monitor\nnew applications.\n\n12\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.900\nSo I'm pretty excited, Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.730\nI have never done this before so\nthis is new for me, and\n\n14\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.460\nI'm really just ready to go.\n\n15\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.360\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well then I guess I can't\nask you to actually do this while I go\n\n16\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.200\ntake a break, so.\n\n17\n00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.980\n&gt;&gt; No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.160\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna drive, but\n\n19\n00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.320\nCherokee is going to be a part of this.\n\n20\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.110\nAnd we're gonna incorporate her and we're\ngoing to incorporate all of you actually.\n\n21\n00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.230\nAnd Cherokee makes\na really important player.\n\n22\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.180\nWe fool around sometimes,\n\n23\n00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.500\nwe obviously joke around\na little bit as we get started.\n\n24\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.320\nBut what she said is actually\nprobably the case for a lot of you.\n\n25\n00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.230\nWhich is hey, I may not have actually\nset up and done APM before, right?\n\n26\n00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.430\nThis is something new and\n\n27\n00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.535\nmaybe although I've used SCOM,\nmaybe I haven't actually used it this way.\n\n28\n00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:06.100\n&gt;&gt; And there's no shame in that.\n\n29\n00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.600\nNumber one,\n\n30\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.260\nbecause that's one of the reasons you come\nto ITProTV to learn how to do new stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.980\nBut it could get a little intimidating and\n\n32\n00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.200\nit could be a little\nexciting at the same time.\n\n33\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.510\nA lot of exciting in CheCherokee's\ncase because you could see just how\n\n34\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.680\nexciting it really is\nwhen she talks about it.\n\n35\n00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.620\nBut it could be a little intimidating\ntoo she does a good job of hiding that\n\n36\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.530\npiece of it but\n\n37\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.390\nthe reality is, if I ask her to do this\nright now herself while I sat back and\n\n38\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.020\nwatch I'm sure she wouldn't be as excited-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n39\n00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As she is while watching me do it and\n\n40\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.470\nthen learning how to do it.\n\n41\n00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.760\nAnd so that is often the case with many of\nthese things, especially some of the more\n\n42\n00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.570\ncomplex, at least in our mind what we\nthink is complex technology elements.\n\n43\n00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.660\nAnd you're gonna see right now,\nit's actually not very hard to do at all.\n\n44\n00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.923\nI wanna dispel those myths\nabout the fact that something\n\n45\n00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:55.091\nlike application monitoring can be tough,\nyou know, we hear dot net,\n\n46\n00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:58.830\nwe hear web services,\nwe hear W-C-F, things like that.\n\n47\n00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.580\nAnd, you know,\n\n48\n00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.750\nwe start to say, Well that's like the\nrealm of stuff that I'm not aware of this.\n\n49\n00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.130\nAn IT admin, as a network person,\nas a monitor person,\n\n50\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.110\nwhatever you do,\nmaybe outside of the App-Dev area, okay,\n\n51\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.670\nthat's that black magic that\npeople engage in, right?\n\n52\n00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.060\nOn the other side of the building,\nI know nothing about.\n\n53\n00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.960\nNothing can be farther from\nthe truth quite honestly.\n\n54\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.530\nIt's not very difficult to do.\n\n55\n00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.690\nI'm gonna walk you through and\n\n56\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.280\nshow you here in the next several minutes\njust how easy it actually can be.\n\n57\n00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.045\nAnd then at the end,\n\n58\n00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:26.390\nwe're gonna make Cherokee do it\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.820\n&gt;&gt; Because she's been taking notes.\n\n60\n00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.620\nAnd if she doesn't do it, well, then we're\ngonna have a problem, because then you\n\n61\n00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.560\ncan't leave until she gets it right,\nand we may be here for a while.\n\n62\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.820\nSo, get your comfy clothes out,\nput on your minion slippers, or whatever\n\n63\n00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.670\nyou have and make sure you got a really\ngood big, tall drink and a sandwich.\n\n64\n00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.237\nThis could take a while.\n\n65\n00:02:45.237 --> 00:02:46.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're gonna get started.\n\n66\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.560\nSo you're gonna keep me honest.\n\n67\n00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna make sure that I don't\n\n68\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.120\nmiss a step and\nyou out there are gonna watch.\n\n69\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.540\nAnd when we get done, we are gonna\nbe monitoring .NET application,\n\n70\n00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.340\nboys and girls.\n\n71\n00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.170\nSo let's take a look, what I actually set\nup for us, just about we getting started,\n\n72\n00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.670\nis, I've already just preloaded\nan application monitor.\n\n73\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.110\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncreate one in just a minute, but\n\n74\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.590\nI wanted to show you what it will look\nlike so you can see the outcome of this.\n\n75\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.730\nBecause it takes about five to ten minutes\nafter we get done setting everything up\n\n76\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.180\nfor all the data to start coming in, for\nthe console to refresh, for us to start\n\n77\n00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.820\ngetting at a status help update on our\napp and for it to show up like it is on\n\n78\n00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.580\nthe screen there, where it's as healthy,\nand we can actually see the app.\n\n79\n00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.310\nLet me just bring this out so\nyou can see this here.\n\n80\n00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.280\nAnd you can see the status, so I figure\nit was good to have one in there for us.\n\n81\n00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.450\nWe can already see it and run it.\n\n82\n00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.630\nWe will go ahead and create one.\n\n83\n00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.770\nBut we're not going to wait around for\nit to start showing up to be healthy.\n\n84\n00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.730\nWe're going to do it and\njust show you how to do it.\n\n85\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.570\nSo what we're doing here,\nyou'll remember our last episode.\n\n86\n00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.440\nAnd by the way if you haven't seen the\nlast episode where we talk about the ideas\n\n87\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.760\nbehind the APM.\n\n88\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.570\nHow we set it up.\n\n89\n00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.810\nThe management packs required.\n\n90\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.540\nAll that kind of stuff.\n\n91\n00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.560\nYou may want to just poke\nyour head in there and\n\n92\n00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.690\ntake a look at that real quick so\nthis makes a little more sense to you.\n\n93\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.840\nBut what we did is we've gone ahead,\nwe've imported our management packs.\n\n94\n00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.460\nWe've set up the background and\nbackend requirements here.\n\n95\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.540\nAnd so when we come in and we are in our\nmonitoring workspace as you can see.\n\n96\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.670\nLet's just go to the top here.\n\n97\n00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.590\nSo, you could see where we are monitoring\nworkspace and that as we come down We come\n\n98\n00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.660\ndown into our application monitoring area,\nwe've opened this up in other words, and\n\n99\n00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.010\nthis is where we're gonna see our APM,\nor application monitoring capabilities,\n\n100\n00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.630\nall the elements,\nthe objects that are given to us,\n\n101\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.410\nthe views, the dashboards, performance\nmonitoring from the Madison patch, right?\n\n102\n00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.700\nRemember, this is web service centric.\n\n103\n00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.110\nIS seven, IS eight, and\n\n104\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.690\nthe system center app monitoring\nmanagement packs that go with that.\n\n105\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.080\nAnd so we have underneath there,\nour application dashboard.\n\n106\n00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.940\nWe don't have anything on there right\nnow because that does take a while to\n\n107\n00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.790\npopulate.\n\n108\n00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.040\nWe have to be running the app for\na while and monitoring it,\n\n109\n00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.100\ngathering data over a period of time,\ntypically at least a day for\n\n110\n00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.670\nus to have anything of significant\nvalue to show up here.\n\n111\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.750\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense,\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n112\n00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.250\n&gt;&gt; Good, I'm glad you-\n\n113\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n114\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.685\n&gt;&gt; Shake on it.\n\n115\n00:05:00.685 --> 00:05:02.175\n&gt;&gt; To accumulate some information is gonna\n\n116\n00:05:02.175 --> 00:05:03.615\ntake some time.\n&gt;&gt; Over here, over here,\n\n117\n00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:04.745\nit's good, it's good, wait, thumbs up,\n\n118\n00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:06.145\nthumbs up, let's do do, wait, wait.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n119\n00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:07.055\nwoo hoo!\nWait,\n\n120\n00:05:07.055 --> 00:05:08.005\nokay.\n&gt;&gt; Don't ad lib,\n\n121\n00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:10.005\nlet's just do this together.\nRight, so me and\n\n122\n00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:11.225\nmy little one, right here.\nYou\n\n123\n00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:12.475\never do thumb wrestling?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n124\n00:05:12.475 --> 00:05:13.155\n&gt;&gt; This is awesome.\n\n125\n00:05:13.155 --> 00:05:14.085\nSo me and my little one,\n\n126\n00:05:14.085 --> 00:05:15.835\nthis is our thing, we thumb wrestle.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:05:15.835 --> 00:05:16.865\n&gt;&gt; So let's thumb wrestle.\n\n128\n00:05:16.865 --> 00:05:17.765\nWhoever wins Okay.\n\n129\n00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:18.365\n&gt;&gt; Let's actually do\n\n130\n00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:18.965\nthe demo.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n131\n00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:19.655\nall right.\n\n132\n00:05:19.655 --> 00:05:20.765\nOne.\n&gt;&gt; One.\n\n133\n00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:21.265\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n134\n00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:21.815\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n135\n00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:22.315\n&gt;&gt; Three.\n\n136\n00:05:22.315 --> 00:05:22.865\n&gt;&gt; Three.\n\n137\n00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:24.890\n&gt;&gt; Four, I declare thumb war.\n\n138\n00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.824\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Okay, so that means you're\n\n139\n00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:30.327\ndriving, you're coming over here now.\n&gt;&gt; Wait I thought the winner is\n\n140\n00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:31.965\nthe winner.\n&gt;&gt; No the winner is the one who\n\n141\n00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:32.580\nhas to do the demo.\n\n142\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so yes,\n\n143\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.090\nit is exciting and it's cool.\n\n144\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.190\nAnd it is going to give us a lot of\ncapabilities to take a look at stuff.\n\n145\n00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.700\nSo we do have,\nas we just scroll back down here.\n\n146\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.090\nWe do have our dashboard and there's one\nquick thing that's interesting here.\n\n147\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.810\nWe also have the ability to see\nour SLAs if we have any in place,\n\n148\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.070\nour service level agreements.\n\n149\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.610\nThis ties back in to our\nService Manager product.\n\n150\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.190\nWe've talked about Service Manager in\nsome of the other episodes until and\n\n151\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.360\nup until this point,\nwe're gonna talk about it again,\n\n152\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.580\ngoing forward in some future episodes.\n\n153\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.610\nBut remember the service manager product\none of the products in the system center\n\n154\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.400\nsuite is where we will be\nable to create connectors\n\n155\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.030\nconnecting back into SCOM connecting\ninto the different products and\n\n156\n00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.260\nthen allow monitoring and alerting from\nSCOM to be taken into service manager,\n\n157\n00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.360\ncreate incident and\nproblem management tickets and flow,\n\n158\n00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.600\nwork flows that will then be use to\nresolve for port on track and result.\n\n159\n00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.490\nAnd then we have the bidirectional\ncommunication coming back out of\n\n160\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.260\nservice manager.\n\n161\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.870\nIf we set up the connectors the right way,\nwe have an alert connector for\n\n162\n00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.830\nSCOM coming out of service manager,\n\n163\n00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.965\nhad a CI connector,\na configuration an item connector.\n\n164\n00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:44.995\nIf we set both up, we then have\nthe ability to check off some additional\n\n165\n00:06:44.995 --> 00:06:49.775\ninfrastructure capabilities there where\nwe do bidirectional alert resolution, and\n\n166\n00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:52.825\nbidirectional management\nof maintenance mode.\n\n167\n00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:56.395\nSo we can actually put systems in\na maintenance mode and do work on them and\n\n168\n00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:58.425\ndo trigger that from Service Manager.\n\n169\n00:06:58.425 --> 00:07:02.270\nAnd we can trigger alert tracking and\nresolution and status updates.\n\n170\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.550\nOut of service manager.\n\n171\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.670\nAnd if SCOM closes an alert,\nwe update service manager.\n\n172\n00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.810\nSo, goes both ways to keep us honest\nthroughout the entire life cycle and\n\n173\n00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.698\nthe escalation path.\n\n174\n00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:14.870\nAnd our SLA's will show up here,\nif we have the connector set up,\n\n175\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.360\nand they are tied in.\n\n176\n00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay so,\nthis may be a silly question here, but\n\n177\n00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.890\nlike I said, I am new to this concept.\n\n178\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.100\nSo if I Have my SLA's here and\nI am managing and\n\n179\n00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.480\nmonitoring multiple applications then this\nwill really just help me keep a good idea,\n\n180\n00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.770\na measurement for my performance\nlevels to make sure I'm adhering\n\n181\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.430\nto the different applications\nthat I am running?\n\n182\n00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.470\n&gt;&gt; It will show us if we are not\nadhering and it will show us if we are.\n\n183\n00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.024\nSo in other words it will keep us on\ntrack and show us graphically and\n\n184\n00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:44.761\nthen with performance\ncounters things like that.\n\n185\n00:07:44.761 --> 00:07:47.992\nBut it'll show us different areas and\nindicate whether we are accepted or\n\n186\n00:07:47.992 --> 00:07:49.191\nnot based on monitoring and\n\n187\n00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:51.919\nthen of course based on the levels\nthe SLA we're suggesting.\n\n188\n00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:52.884\n&gt;&gt; I like that, I won't forget.\n\n189\n00:07:52.884 --> 00:07:54.748\n&gt;&gt; Exactly what it does,\nexactly what it does.\n\n190\n00:07:54.748 --> 00:07:57.090\nAll right so, We are going to just\nthrow down another layer here.\n\n191\n00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.720\nSo we have our basic applications,\nwe'd see this fill in over time.\n\n192\n00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.680\nWe can, as you know, right-click here.\n\n193\n00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.810\nYou do a refresh.\n\n194\n00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.420\nIt is harder to see, but that little blue\nline that goes shooting across there\n\n195\n00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.072\nis the refresh on the dashboards.\n\n196\n00:08:08.072 --> 00:08:10.100\nYou've seen that in some\nof the other episodes.\n\n197\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.610\nWe have our .NET monitoring specifically.\n\n198\n00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.050\nCome in here, if we have any active alert\non the application, we would see them.\n\n199\n00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:20.238\nWe don't have any now, so that is good to\nknow I went in before we got started and\n\n200\n00:08:20.238 --> 00:08:21.703\ndeleted all of the alerts.\n\n201\n00:08:21.703 --> 00:08:22.515\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't see them.\n\n202\n00:08:22.515 --> 00:08:23.660\nA whole bunch in there, but no.\n\n203\n00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.760\nI didn't do that, I'm only kidding.\n\n204\n00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.660\nThere's no alerts right now\nbecause we are monitoring.\n\n205\n00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.850\nThe app is healthy.\n\n206\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.329\nWe haven't put it under stress yet.\n\n207\n00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:30.746\nThere's really no usage of it.\n\n208\n00:08:30.746 --> 00:08:32.114\nRemember in the real world,\n\n209\n00:08:32.114 --> 00:08:35.500\nyou'd have users hitting this\nthing through the web constantly.\n\n210\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.170\nYou would be generating traffic.\n\n211\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:40.140\nThis is just an app that we've\nset up that we're monitoring, but\n\n212\n00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.490\nnobody's in there using it.\n\n213\n00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.608\nWe're not stressing the web service.\n\n214\n00:08:43.608 --> 00:08:47.038\nSo there's really probably gonna be no\nalerting that's gonna take place while\n\n215\n00:08:47.038 --> 00:08:48.890\nwe're actually in the demo environment.\n\n216\n00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.740\nBut it's obviously good to check and\nknow that.\n\n217\n00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.988\nWe do have our IS hosted\nWCF web service inventory.\n\n218\n00:08:54.988 --> 00:08:57.730\nRemember Windows Communication Foundation\nframework.\n\n219\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.550\nYou could see here we are monitoring\nsystem center, 2012 Orchestrator.\n\n220\n00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.345\nAt least you can probably\nsee the edge of that.\n\n221\n00:09:03.345 --> 00:09:06.786\nProbably not the whole thing, but\nyou could see the orchestrated website,\n\n222\n00:09:06.786 --> 00:09:07.765\nweb services there.\n\n223\n00:09:07.765 --> 00:09:09.835\nWe've got the information on that.\n\n224\n00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:11.755\nWe can tell that that is doing well.\n\n225\n00:09:11.755 --> 00:09:12.915\nWe can come down here.\n\n226\n00:09:12.915 --> 00:09:15.355\nCan we go full screen just on this,\njust to see the bottom a little bit?\n\n227\n00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:16.425\nThank you very much.\n\n228\n00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:19.715\nYou can see down here under\nthe detailed view that we have\n\n229\n00:09:19.715 --> 00:09:23.445\nsome information about this display name,\nfull path name out there.\n\n230\n00:09:23.445 --> 00:09:26.185\nSo we've got some information\non the application.\n\n231\n00:09:26.185 --> 00:09:28.097\nThe name of the application route.\n\n232\n00:09:28.097 --> 00:09:33.830\nAnd we can go through and\nwe can click on that item.\n\n233\n00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:38.920\nAnd it takes us up here\ninto the state monitor.\n\n234\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.430\nAnd shows us information, let me actually\njust drag this over just a wee bit here.\n\n235\n00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.110\nSo you can see this and\n\n236\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.630\nmove it down below that annoying little\nblue box with the plus sign in it.\n\n237\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.650\nYou could see it here, the State Monitor\nopens up in a separate window.\n\n238\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.630\nYou can see the console,\nthe apps console sitting there behind us.\n\n239\n00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.760\nAnd you can see that we do have this\ninformation, it is in a warning state.\n\n240\n00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.474\nWe're not quite sure why but we certainly\ncould go in, we could drill down and\n\n241\n00:10:03.474 --> 00:10:04.345\ntake a look here.\n\n242\n00:10:04.345 --> 00:10:10.290\nAnd we can see that in the Detail View,\nlet's just see what's going on down here.\n\n243\n00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.670\nWe've got some general information,\nphysical processors,\n\n244\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.490\nthere's logical processors,\n\n245\n00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.910\nbunch of information that helps us to\nunderstand what maybe happening here.\n\n246\n00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.280\nBut nothing that seems to be\nindicating the warning sign, but\n\n247\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.900\nwe can right click on the warning,\nand you'll notice that you can open up\n\n248\n00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.030\ndifferent views to drill down and\nsee more data here.\n\n249\n00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.510\nAlerting, Diagram view,\nEvent View, Performance View\n\n250\n00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.840\nwe will probably wanna use something\ncalled the Health Explorer when we have\n\n251\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.296\na question as to the status of the health\nof this particular application.\n\n252\n00:10:41.296 --> 00:10:46.180\nThe Health Explorer is gonna aggregate for\nus all of the data around the alerts and\n\n253\n00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.560\nthe changes in state.\n\n254\n00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.240\nHey we went from healthy to warning,\nwarning to critical,\n\n255\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.520\ncritical to, back to warning or whatever.\n\n256\n00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.600\nWe're gonna see all this, so I wanna\nshow you a couple of these real quick\n\n257\n00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.390\nbecause these can be very helpful\nto help us go in and diagnose, and\n\n258\n00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.780\nunderstand what may be going on.\n\n259\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.380\nSo let's take a look, go ahead,\nwe'll open up the Health Explorer here.\n\n260\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.280\nNotice it opens up, brings up for\n\n261\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.060\nus this window, right on top\nof the one we were just using.\n\n262\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.060\nI'll just quickly show you behind,\nwe're kinda stacking them up.\n\n263\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.690\nMuch like index cards, right?\n\n264\n00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.625\nSo we've got this one stacked up here\nlet's just go full-screen on this one so\n\n265\n00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:20.719\nit'll be a little bit easier\nto see what's happening.\n\n266\n00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:26.030\nAnd we can see that we have a lot of\ninformation being generated over here.\n\n267\n00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.450\nEntity health, and when we click on it,\nwe can see that there's a little summary,\n\n268\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.680\ndoesn't really have much information\nthere, the value of this is the state\n\n269\n00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.270\nchange events tab where we\ncan see that there's been\n\n270\n00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:43.660\ntimeline changes from either critical\nto warning, or warning to critical.\n\n271\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.060\nRed circle is critical,\nyellow caution flag warning right?\n\n272\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.260\nSo we could see different states and\nhow they were moving back and forth.\n\n273\n00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.039\nAnd we can scroll through and\njust kinda see that.\n\n274\n00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:56.270\nLooks like we started out right here.\n\n275\n00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.720\nYou can see this is,\n\n276\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.620\nif you take a look, we're starting out\nfrom essentially nothing to good and\n\n277\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.380\nwe're just going through and\nseeing How this all progresses.\n\n278\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.466\nNow you may notice the date stamps\non some of these are back in 2014.\n\n279\n00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:13.930\nThe most recent ones are 2017,\nthose are the ones we're using.\n\n280\n00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.250\nAll the ones prior to that\nare just monitoring data\n\n281\n00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:21.590\nthat's been sitting in the system from\nwhen we initially do installs, and\n\n282\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.620\nconfigure, and create images,\nand stuff like that.\n\n283\n00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.280\nSo a lot of that old data is not\nnecessarily relevant to what we're doing\n\n284\n00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.340\nnow just the last couple of\nones right up here, in the last\n\n285\n00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.850\nfew minutes as we've done the install\nof the app and started to configure it,\n\n286\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.070\nare of interest to us right here,\nthese last two that are sitting up here.\n\n287\n00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:44.960\nSo we can go drill through, and\nwe can begin to see as we move down.\n\n288\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.140\nWindows Application Health Rollup,\n\n289\n00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.930\navailability of the data\naccess service and\n\n290\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.490\nthere will be different state changes that\nwe will see as the system comes online.\n\n291\n00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.260\nAnd we can reference these,\nwe can begin to get a timeline, and\n\n292\n00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.550\nbegin to see what's happening.\n\n293\n00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.854\nThis is one element,\n\n294\n00:13:00.854 --> 00:13:04.847\none area that we can use to help\nus understand what's happening.\n\n295\n00:13:04.847 --> 00:13:08.966\nNow, up here we can recalculate\nhealth of the system, and go out and\n\n296\n00:13:08.966 --> 00:13:12.362\nask the monitor to go out and\nuse the algorithms it uses,\n\n297\n00:13:12.362 --> 00:13:16.140\nthe monitors it uses,\npull data back in and give us an update.\n\n298\n00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.660\nThis is essentially like a refresh, right?\n\n299\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.420\nGive us an update on the current\nhealth status and tell us whether or\n\n300\n00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.580\nnot this is accurate.\n\n301\n00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.200\nMaybe we made some changes and\nwanna see an update on this.\n\n302\n00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.690\nWe also can reset the health monitor.\n\n303\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.300\nSo we can say, okay,\nwe know about that, reset it.\n\n304\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.942\nAnd then we can go ahead and\nwe could start monitoring or\n\n305\n00:13:32.942 --> 00:13:34.619\ncontinue monitoring from there.\n\n306\n00:13:34.619 --> 00:13:38.430\nWe also have the ability,\njust get out of here on second.\n\n307\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.700\n&gt;&gt; Now Adam, that blue plus\nsymbol that you're looking at,\n\n308\n00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.710\nat the top there that you hovered over,\nthat's just part of your actual\n\n309\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.000\nlab environment, that wouldn't\nbe in a production environment.\n\n310\n00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.796\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea where that came from,\nthat's an alien piece of technology.\n\n311\n00:13:50.796 --> 00:13:51.429\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That\n\n312\n00:13:51.429 --> 00:13:56.230\nis actually the mind control element\nthat we use to make you love ITProTV.\n\n313\n00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.350\nIt beams ITProTV thoughts\nto you in real time.\n\n314\n00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.620\nThat is just as Cherokee says,\nI'm fooling around with you.\n\n315\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.400\nThat's just the control window.\n\n316\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.410\nThe control, floating control elements for\nthe virtual lab environment we're using.\n\n317\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.889\nYou will never see that in the real world,\nright?\n\n318\n00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:13.106\nUnless you happened to host in\na virtual environment, RDPN, or\n\n319\n00:14:13.106 --> 00:14:17.156\nuse some sort of KVM like technology and\nit gives you that kind of a control panel,\n\n320\n00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:20.525\nbut other than that you\nwouldn't see that normally.\n\n321\n00:14:20.525 --> 00:14:22.995\nYou'll see here we also can go in and\nwe can,\n\n322\n00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:25.695\nI really like going with the whole\nITProTV mind control thing.\n\n323\n00:14:25.695 --> 00:14:26.965\nI thought that was really cool.\n\n324\n00:14:26.965 --> 00:14:30.115\nWe need the flashing light and the siren\nto come on when we do that, though.\n\n325\n00:14:30.115 --> 00:14:33.085\nWe can't also go in you'll notice and\ndeal with overrides here.\n\n326\n00:14:33.085 --> 00:14:36.985\nWe talked about overrides in our\nmonitoring with management packs.\n\n327\n00:14:36.985 --> 00:14:38.472\nWe talked about them in\nsome prior episodes.\n\n328\n00:14:38.472 --> 00:14:40.170\nWe'll talk about them again later on.\n\n329\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:45.170\nThe ability to create overrides is the\nability to take a sealed Management Pack,\n\n330\n00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.500\nwhich is the state of most Management\nPacks when we import them, and to then\n\n331\n00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.430\nlay over the top our customizations and\nchanges and then apply them.\n\n332\n00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:58.340\nCombining them with the sealed Management\nPack together to then generate for us\n\n333\n00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.590\nultimately, the output we want from the,\nquote and quote, modified management pack.\n\n334\n00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.870\nSo we can interact with our\noverrides here and control them, and\n\n335\n00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.240\nthen see the impact of\nthem on the health stat.\n\n336\n00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.650\nSo, it's a very useful tool by drilling\nin and looking to health monitor or\n\n337\n00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.810\nhealth explorer as part of this.\n\n338\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.434\nBut notice,\nwe also could right-click here,\n\n339\n00:15:18.434 --> 00:15:23.158\nwe can go ahead and we can go, and\nwe can look at a diagram view.\n\n340\n00:15:23.158 --> 00:15:24.780\nJust give it a second to come in.\n\n341\n00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.910\nWe've taken a look at these interactive\ndiagrams in other episodes,\n\n342\n00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:32.910\nwhere we can see the actual structure\nof the application, drilling down and\n\n343\n00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.080\nlooking at content and elements, and\n\n344\n00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.530\nseeing the health status of\nthem in real time, as well.\n\n345\n00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.247\nSo this is also gonna be interesting.\n\n346\n00:15:39.247 --> 00:15:41.860\nWe see our healthy stuff over here.\n\n347\n00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.070\nOpen this up, let's just pull this down.\n\n348\n00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:48.590\nAnd we can see all of the moving parts,\nthe database here,\n\n349\n00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:53.490\nthe interactivity of the services,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n350\n00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:58.609\nAnd we can see by clicking on\nthem what elements are healthy,\n\n351\n00:15:58.609 --> 00:16:02.284\nlike the whole Risky Business\nsunglasses icon there as you can see.\n\n352\n00:16:02.284 --> 00:16:03.867\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, we have all of this.\n\n353\n00:16:03.867 --> 00:16:08.500\nAnd we can see the report console,\nthe web console looks healthy.\n\n354\n00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.689\nWe can select there and see the individual\ninformation for each component.\n\n355\n00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:17.944\nIf we're looking at what's not monitored,\nwe could select what's not monitored and\n\n356\n00:16:17.944 --> 00:16:21.167\nsee things in the system that\nare currently not being monitored.\n\n357\n00:16:21.167 --> 00:16:26.058\nSince this is in an interactive diagram\nview, it lets us understand by directly\n\n358\n00:16:26.058 --> 00:16:31.160\nclicking through and visually linking\nobject identifiers and these icons.\n\n359\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.980\nWith status, we're able to see\nwhat the current status is.\n\n360\n00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.740\nAnd this does update in real time as well,\nso there is a refresh cycle for it.\n\n361\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.900\nIt's not updating consistently,\nbut this diagram does update and\n\n362\n00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.020\ndoes give us actual status.\n\n363\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.793\nAnd then we can see here\nwhat's in a warning state.\n\n364\n00:16:47.793 --> 00:16:49.886\nSo we can click through on each area,\n\n365\n00:16:49.886 --> 00:16:53.320\nwe just have to of course roll\nover here to see warning.\n\n366\n00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.988\nAnd we could see the elements\nthat are in a warning state.\n\n367\n00:16:55.988 --> 00:16:59.693\nAnd we can see that there's some kind of\nwarning on the MS SQL Server instance for\n\n368\n00:16:59.693 --> 00:17:02.480\nthe database, for instance,\non the back end, with this.\n\n369\n00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.540\nSo there may be something we wanna\ngo drill into on the app, right?\n\n370\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.257\nSo we can get lots of different views\nto see what's actually happening with\n\n371\n00:17:10.257 --> 00:17:12.857\nour data status by actually\ncreating this monitor.\n\n372\n00:17:12.857 --> 00:17:14.080\nWe haven't created this yet, right?\n\n373\n00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.481\nRemember, I did this ahead of time.\nI'm just walking you\n\n374\n00:17:15.481 --> 00:17:18.156\nthrough what the output is, and\nthen when you see me create it,\n\n375\n00:17:18.156 --> 00:17:22.080\nyou're gonna have already seen all these\ncool stuff that we could do with it.\n\n376\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.653\n&gt;&gt; So Adam,\nthis is a really cool user interface here.\n\n377\n00:17:24.653 --> 00:17:28.568\nAnd if I already have this particular\ncomponent set up in my environment,\n\n378\n00:17:28.568 --> 00:17:31.472\nand you had a pretty interesting\nnotion earlier that if\n\n379\n00:17:31.472 --> 00:17:35.532\nmy company wasn't large enough to have\nits own internal development team.\n\n380\n00:17:35.532 --> 00:17:39.332\nAnd I was working with a third party\nentity, would I be able to easily take\n\n381\n00:17:39.332 --> 00:17:43.150\nthis information and export it, or\nhow would that normally be handled?\n\n382\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, it would depend on whether\nthe third-party entity was giving you\n\n383\n00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.880\naccess to the systems to monitor.\n\n384\n00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.607\nSo, in other words, were they hosting\nit and doing monitoring for you,\n\n385\n00:17:53.607 --> 00:17:56.840\nthen the question would flip around and we\nwould say, hey, what are they exporting?\n\n386\n00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.090\nWhat are they giving you?\n\n387\n00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If we're gonna be hosting the app, or\n\n388\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.110\nperhaps they're developing the app,\nso maybe they've developed the code.\n\n389\n00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.340\nWe're running it on our servers,\n\n390\n00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.390\nwhich is fairly common as a thought\nprocess when we outsource.\n\n391\n00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.490\nIf they're doing that, then we will\nown the monitoring environment.\n\n392\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.347\nWe can take this information,\nwe can export it.\n\n393\n00:18:16.347 --> 00:18:18.035\nWe have reports, for instance.\n\n394\n00:18:18.035 --> 00:18:21.209\nWe can also delegate through\nthe use of the roles area,\n\n395\n00:18:21.209 --> 00:18:25.144\nwe've talked about in other episodes,\nwhere we can assign a role.\n\n396\n00:18:25.144 --> 00:18:30.565\nAnd tailor and filter that view that we\ngive somebody by security trimming the UI.\n\n397\n00:18:30.565 --> 00:18:33.640\nGiving them only rights to certain\nelements within the system.\n\n398\n00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.685\nThe Windows security model,\nin other words, right?\n\n399\n00:18:34.685 --> 00:18:35.534\n&gt;&gt; Yep!\n&gt;&gt; If you think about it.\n\n400\n00:18:35.534 --> 00:18:37.606\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\nWe use that generically in almost every\n\n401\n00:18:37.606 --> 00:18:38.580\nproduct we have.\n\n402\n00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.077\nWe have the ability to do that in\nall the Systems Center products but\n\n403\n00:18:42.077 --> 00:18:43.522\nobviously in SCOM as well.\n\n404\n00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:49.076\nWe could give those developers the ability\nto log in with limited console access and\n\n405\n00:18:49.076 --> 00:18:50.730\nsee monitoring.\n\n406\n00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.607\nGive them a role that's constrained,\nin other words.\n\n407\n00:18:52.607 --> 00:18:55.350\nAnd we will be able to give them\naccess to the data directly.\n\n408\n00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.746\nSo it wouldn't necessarily be we have\nto export the data because we export\n\n409\n00:18:58.746 --> 00:19:00.050\nmanagement packs.\n\n410\n00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.092\nWe don't tend to export data\nbecause data sits in the databases.\n\n411\n00:19:03.092 --> 00:19:05.810\nThe way we get at it would\nbe through reports, right?\n\n412\n00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:10.040\nWe query the databases, pull that data\nout of the data warehouse database and\n\n413\n00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.770\nuse reports to represent it.\n\n414\n00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.866\nSo we could give them a limited view\nthat gives them reporting rights, or\n\n415\n00:19:14.866 --> 00:19:17.528\nconsole management rights if\nthey wanna interact directly.\n\n416\n00:19:17.528 --> 00:19:19.120\nSo there would be different ways to do it.\n\n417\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.284\nIt's just a matter of what\nthe best approach would be, right?\n\n418\n00:19:21.284 --> 00:19:21.816\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, thank you.\n\n419\n00:19:21.816 --> 00:19:23.552\n&gt;&gt; What we wanna do or\nhow we wanna achieve that.\n\n420\n00:19:23.552 --> 00:19:25.802\nAll right, so let's go back in.\n\n421\n00:19:25.802 --> 00:19:27.480\nLet's get out of the diagram view.\n\n422\n00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.853\nLet's get out of our status and\nstate view here.\n\n423\n00:19:29.853 --> 00:19:32.308\nWe just wanted to poke around\nunder the covers a little bit,\n\n424\n00:19:32.308 --> 00:19:33.980\nshow you some of the output of this.\n\n425\n00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.574\nJust before we go in and create one, we\ncould see the monitored application here.\n\n426\n00:19:37.574 --> 00:19:39.723\nWe can see the overall health,\n\n427\n00:19:39.723 --> 00:19:43.630\nwe see the application itself\nhas a subfolder created.\n\n428\n00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.720\nIf we did have alerts,\nas I said, we would see them.\n\n429\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.758\nWe don't right now.\n\n430\n00:19:46.758 --> 00:19:48.190\nWe could drill through.\n\n431\n00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.700\nWe could see the healthy\nstate of the monitor.\n\n432\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.730\nWe could see information here.\n\n433\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.970\nSo we do have a nice\namount of information.\n\n434\n00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.740\nAlso on the right,\ncan we go full screen for\n\n435\n00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.580\na second cuz I didn't\ntalk about this before.\n\n436\n00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.756\nWhenever we highlight anything, we've seen\nthis in other episodes and other demos, in\n\n437\n00:20:03.756 --> 00:20:07.502\nthe ops console, everything's contextual\non the right here in the work area.\n\n438\n00:20:07.502 --> 00:20:09.544\nBut as we highlight something,\n\n439\n00:20:09.544 --> 00:20:13.810\nwe have the ability to do a variety\nof things here as you can see.\n\n440\n00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:18.260\nStart maintenance mode, entity properties,\nhealth explorer as I showed you.\n\n441\n00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.550\nAll the different views.\n\n442\n00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.258\nTo Cherokee's question just a moment ago,\nas I mentioned,\n\n443\n00:20:22.258 --> 00:20:23.753\nmaybe we'll do some reporting.\n\n444\n00:20:23.753 --> 00:20:27.362\nWe could see a list of some reports down\nthere on the right under Report Tasks,\n\n445\n00:20:27.362 --> 00:20:30.969\nthat may be valuable that we can either\ngenerate or give to somebody, right,\n\n446\n00:20:30.969 --> 00:20:32.790\npotentially, once we run them.\n\n447\n00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.330\nSo we do have the ability to interact\nwith this data contextually right here.\n\n448\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.990\nAll right, so now what we're gonna do is\ngo in and actually create this thing.\n\n449\n00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.310\nWe've been poking around under the hood\nfor almost probably 20 minutes about\n\n450\n00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.240\nwhat it looks like after we do it,\nbut we haven't actually done it yet.\n\n451\n00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.607\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're goinna actually create the monitor.\n\n452\n00:20:48.607 --> 00:20:49.912\nWe're gonna switch gears.\n\n453\n00:20:49.912 --> 00:20:52.517\nWe're gonna leave the monitoring area and\nwe're gonna go to the authoring area.\n\n454\n00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:56.152\nBecause this is where we go to\naccess our management pack template,\n\n455\n00:20:56.152 --> 00:20:59.900\nour management pack objects we've\ntalked about in other episodes.\n\n456\n00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.908\nThose will be down here underneath here\nin the management pack object area.\n\n457\n00:21:02.908 --> 00:21:04.930\nWe're not gonna mess with those.\n\n458\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.826\nFor now, we're just gonna come up here.\n\n459\n00:21:07.826 --> 00:21:08.444\nThere we go.\n\n460\n00:21:08.444 --> 00:21:10.262\nGonna come up here.\nWe're gonna go to authoring.\n\n461\n00:21:10.262 --> 00:21:13.236\nAnd you can see under management\npack template that we do have a .NET\n\n462\n00:21:13.236 --> 00:21:15.660\napplication performance\nmonitoring template.\n\n463\n00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.191\nWe can hover there.\nIt gives all this information about what\n\n464\n00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:20.260\nit is and how we're gonna use it.\n\n465\n00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.730\nYou'll see the app that\nI've already created,\n\n466\n00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.870\nthat we've been playing\naround with is there listed,\n\n467\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.130\nbeen sitting there for a while.\n\n468\n00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.172\nWe're gonna go ahead and create another\ninstance, another instantiation of this,\n\n469\n00:21:28.172 --> 00:21:29.535\nand show you how to walk through this.\n\n470\n00:21:29.535 --> 00:21:35.630\nSo we're gonna right-click on this\ntemplate, Add Monitoring Wizard.\n\n471\n00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.762\nAnd by the way, there is a link\nright down here, off to the left,\n\n472\n00:21:38.762 --> 00:21:39.986\nadd monitoring wizard.\n\n473\n00:21:39.986 --> 00:21:41.860\nWe can launch it right from there,\nand we would get-\n\n474\n00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:42.568\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Just giving you\n\n475\n00:21:42.568 --> 00:21:43.571\na couple different ways to execute?\n\n476\n00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:45.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would just be the same thing.\n\n477\n00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.770\nWe would still get to the same window.\n\n478\n00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.004\nWe'd still have to make a choice here.\n\n479\n00:21:48.004 --> 00:21:51.563\nIt doesn't matter if we highlight\nthe template, right-click and choose\n\n480\n00:21:51.563 --> 00:21:55.670\nAdd Monitoring Wizard, we'd still get\nthis screen and we'd still choose here.\n\n481\n00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.820\nAnd if we just load Add Monitoring Wizard\nover there on the left,\n\n482\n00:21:58.820 --> 00:21:59.770\nwe get to the same place.\n\n483\n00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:00.619\nSo it wouldn't matter either way.\n\n484\n00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:04.342\nIt's totally a question of just whether or\nnot you have happen to be of the mindset\n\n485\n00:22:04.342 --> 00:22:08.065\nthat I'll click on the template\nversus launching the wizard directly.\n\n486\n00:22:08.065 --> 00:22:10.185\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nhighlight our template.\n\n487\n00:22:10.185 --> 00:22:12.180\nVery important to make\nthe right selection here,\n\n488\n00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.135\notherwise we wind up monitoring\nsomething that we may not wanna monitor.\n\n489\n00:22:15.135 --> 00:22:17.045\nWe gotta go back and do it again.\n\n490\n00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:19.485\nSo, we're gonna do .NET\nperformance monitoring here.\n\n491\n00:22:19.485 --> 00:22:21.980\nClick Next, we have to give it a name.\n\n492\n00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:28.453\nI'd named my prior one ITproTVnetapp1.\n\n493\n00:22:28.453 --> 00:22:31.970\nSo I told you Cherokee was\ngonna participate in this one,\n\n494\n00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:36.460\nso we're gonna call this one C-H-E-R for\nher, O-K-E-E, right?\n\n495\n00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.851\n&gt;&gt; You spelled it correctly.\n\n496\n00:22:37.851 --> 00:22:41.011\n&gt;&gt; I did spell it correctly,\nso we're gonna go ahead and\n\n497\n00:22:41.011 --> 00:22:43.440\nname the application Cherokee.\n\n498\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.782\n&gt;&gt; You should see some\nof my Starbucks cups.\n\n499\n00:22:45.782 --> 00:22:50.270\nCherokey, Cheruba,\nI'm sure you get all sorts of stuff.\n\n500\n00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.560\nThey manage to slaughter and\nbutcher my name.\n\n501\n00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.620\nAnd we're talking four letters and\nthe first person created, right, I mean.\n\n502\n00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.580\nIt's not hard to figure out Adam,\nbut you know, what can I tell you?\n\n503\n00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.185\nAll right, so\nthen what we do is we go ahead and\n\n504\n00:23:04.185 --> 00:23:07.007\nthen the pronunciations\nare just even funnier.\n\n505\n00:23:07.007 --> 00:23:10.267\nAllen, Aegor, I got like-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] So\n\n506\n00:23:10.267 --> 00:23:10.893\nyou know what I'm talking about?\n\n507\n00:23:10.893 --> 00:23:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've just learned to answer to\nanything that even remotely resembles it.\n\n508\n00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.312\nIf it's my drink, I'll take it.\n\n509\n00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:18.920\nIf it's your drink and\nI'm there before you, you're out of luck.\n\n510\n00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.090\nSo I just want my coffee.\n\n511\n00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.620\nI don't really care whose name is\non the cup to be honest with you.\n\n512\n00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.451\nAll right, so then what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n513\n00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:26.082\nwe're gonna choose.\n\n514\n00:23:26.082 --> 00:23:26.954\nCould we go full screen?\n\n515\n00:23:26.954 --> 00:23:29.190\nCuz we're not gonna be able to\nsee all this unless we do that.\n\n516\n00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:30.016\nThank you very much, sir.\n\n517\n00:23:30.016 --> 00:23:35.140\nWe are going down here to have\nto choose our management pack.\n\n518\n00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.220\nWe have to assign this\napplication template and\n\n519\n00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.920\nmonitoring wizard to a management pack.\n\n520\n00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.732\nSo that way, we get all of those views and\nall those tools I was showing you.\n\n521\n00:23:45.732 --> 00:23:50.670\nThe application alert view,\nthe dashboard, the diagram view.\n\n522\n00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.750\nAll that stuff, all those things.\n\n523\n00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:55.350\nThey're all objects that\nare coming to us as part of\n\n524\n00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.139\nbeing able to be associated\nwith the management pack.\n\n525\n00:23:58.139 --> 00:24:02.333\nSo we have to assign, or essentially\ncreate a dependency between our monitor\n\n526\n00:24:02.333 --> 00:24:06.010\nand the management pack to be able\nto bring all that information in so\n\n527\n00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.090\nwe actually have it once we're done.\n\n528\n00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.780\nAnd we can see all those\nthings I was just showing you.\n\n529\n00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.910\nIf we don't do this, we've got nothing.\n\n530\n00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.820\nThere's nothing that's gonna\nshow up when we're done.\n\n531\n00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.910\nSo we're gonna either create a brand new\nmanagement pack, we could do that, or\n\n532\n00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.050\nwe can choose one of the ones\nthat's already there.\n\n533\n00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.820\nI'm gonna use the default management\npack which has all those monitors,\n\n534\n00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.710\nall those objects,\nall those views already associated with\n\n535\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.880\nthe reports all that stuff I showed you,\nit's all there.\n\n536\n00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.380\nSo we're gonna choose\nthe default management pack.\n\n537\n00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.310\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\n\n538\n00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:40.350\nwe are going to, just get that up there,\nwe're gonna click next.\n\n539\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.860\nThen, we're gonna specify add\napplication components to monitor.\n\n540\n00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.070\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nadd in the application component.\n\n541\n00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.000\nIn other words,\nwhat do we want to monitor,\n\n542\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.350\nwhat is the application we actually want\nto bring in, what are we looking at?\n\n543\n00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.210\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna bring that in.\n\n544\n00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.490\nSo we're gonna click add here,\nwe're gonna do a search.\n\n545\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.830\nYou'll see it says search for\nweb applications and services.\n\n546\n00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:00.430\nDo a search.\n\n547\n00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.860\nWe'll find orchestrator, which I already\nused and I showed you was there.\n\n548\n00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:08.620\nIn the real world, of course, we can\nsearch for either web applications and\n\n549\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.350\nservices or Windows services,\ndepending on what is there.\n\n550\n00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.625\nBut it says here before you select\nthe service, you have to have added\n\n551\n00:25:14.625 --> 00:25:17.795\nthe appropriate monitoring for service\nby using the Windows services template.\n\n552\n00:25:17.795 --> 00:25:21.405\nIn other words, when I choose Windows\nservices, it's telling me, hey guess what,\n\n553\n00:25:21.405 --> 00:25:25.125\nyou made the wrong choice three\nscreens ago because you said .NET app,\n\n554\n00:25:25.125 --> 00:25:26.192\nthat's a web app.\n\n555\n00:25:26.192 --> 00:25:30.052\nIf you want Windows you gotta go back and\nchoose a different template in order to be\n\n556\n00:25:30.052 --> 00:25:33.272\nable to do the monitoring, because\nyou're not monitoring the right one.\n\n557\n00:25:33.272 --> 00:25:35.242\nWhat they're saying here, this,\n\n558\n00:25:35.242 --> 00:25:38.272\nis that I would have to choose this\nitem right down here on the left,\n\n559\n00:25:38.272 --> 00:25:41.892\nwhich is Windows Service,\nnot the .NET application template.\n\n560\n00:25:41.892 --> 00:25:45.382\nSo I can make a choice here, but\nI've already made my choice.\n\n561\n00:25:45.382 --> 00:25:47.392\nI gotta to stick with\nwhat's already there.\n\n562\n00:25:47.392 --> 00:25:50.080\nNow, the logical question is,\nwell okay, smart guy,\n\n563\n00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.740\nthen why did they give you Windows service\nthere if you shouldn't be choosing it.\n\n564\n00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.370\nThat's a design issue,\nnothing to do with me.\n\n565\n00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.230\nI'm in knowledge, I'm not in design.\n\n566\n00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:03.610\nYou want to talk about design,\nyou send an email to microsoft.com and\n\n567\n00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.380\nyou ask them why they chose to do that.\n\n568\n00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.000\nBut what we're doing here is we're\ngonna go back to web apps and\n\n569\n00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.300\nservices, we're gonna choose orchestrator.\n\n570\n00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:17.100\nNow I made this point in other\ndemos where we're not done here.\n\n571\n00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.160\nYou've selected the component but you've\nnot added it to the bottom window here\n\n572\n00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.150\nwhere it actually is\nthen gonna become active.\n\n573\n00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.990\nAnd you don't have an okay button here\nthat goes active until you do that.\n\n574\n00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.650\nSo you gotta click Add.\n\n575\n00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:31.770\nMake sure you drop it down there,\nnow the OK button is there.\n\n576\n00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.930\nAnd then hide it, of course,\nwith my magical disappearing and\n\n577\n00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.750\nreappearing taskbar.\n\n578\n00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.970\nMove this over a little bit so\nyou can see that a little better.\n\n579\n00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.360\nAnd then we'll move it\nover a little more so\n\n580\n00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.790\nyou can see it even better,\nbecause that way it's away from the box.\n\n581\n00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:47.490\nAnd then we've added that in.\n\n582\n00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.730\nNow we have our monitoring scope,\nwe've gone ahead and we've added in\n\n583\n00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.160\nwhat we're gonna do, we've done our\nsearch, we've added in our orchestrator.\n\n584\n00:26:56.895 --> 00:27:00.465\nAnd what we're gonna do down here under\nEnvironment is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n585\n00:27:00.465 --> 00:27:05.635\nspecify, can we go full-screen just so\nyou could see this for a second,\n\n586\n00:27:05.635 --> 00:27:09.845\nwhat stage of the Environment cycle,\nthe monitoring scope, we're gonna use.\n\n587\n00:27:09.845 --> 00:27:12.435\nThis is a metadata tag, by the way.\n\n588\n00:27:12.435 --> 00:27:15.065\nYou can leave this at None,\nit wouldn't really matter.\n\n589\n00:27:15.065 --> 00:27:18.935\nBut we have standard stages here for\na lifecycle typically, Production,\n\n590\n00:27:18.935 --> 00:27:23.750\nStaging Test, Dev New, you create your\nown tag there if you wanna go in.\n\n591\n00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.450\nCreate your own metadata tag.\n\n592\n00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:30.360\nThis would line up with your ad dev\nlifecycle, your management thought process\n\n593\n00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.880\nof how you do dev, and what your\ndevelopment lifecycle stages are.\n\n594\n00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.980\nOr where you're gonna deploy\nthis application into,\n\n595\n00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.850\nwhat environment it's running.\n\n596\n00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.580\nAnd you can look at\nthat in different ways.\n\n597\n00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:46.440\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we'll say\nthis is in, let's put it in staging,\n\n598\n00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.610\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n599\n00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.230\nWe'll put it in staging.\n\n600\n00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.840\nGo ahead and we'll click next.\n\n601\n00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.900\nWe have here configure\nthe default monitoring settings.\n\n602\n00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.320\nYou'll notice turn on\nperformance event alerts,\n\n603\n00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.830\nyou'll notice turn on exception\nevent alerts, those are selected.\n\n604\n00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:03.150\nPerformance event threshold\nin milliseconds, 15000,\n\n605\n00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.010\nmeaning 15 seconds configure\nperformance event monitoring.\n\n606\n00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.520\n15 second increments for DataGrabs.\n\n607\n00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.190\nWe can modify that, but\ndo know that is in milliseconds.\n\n608\n00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.460\nThat will be important.\n\n609\n00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.860\nYou're sitting there typing 15 and you're\ngetting slammed with data because you're\n\n610\n00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.210\ngetting data reads every milliseconds.\n\n611\n00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.090\nThat would be ridiculous, so\njust pay attention to that.\n\n612\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.420\nWe do have the ability to\nuse advance settings for\n\n613\n00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.550\ncustomizing additionally here.\n\n614\n00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:31.144\nWe can also enable additional\nconfiguration options for server-side and\n\n615\n00:28:31.144 --> 00:28:32.770\nclient-side monitoring.\n\n616\n00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:34.690\nWe talked about the fact\nwhen we were setting this up\n\n617\n00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.915\nthat we had the ability to look at\nboth client-side and server-side.\n\n618\n00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:40.810\nBoth sides of the hosting\nenvironment to interact in C.\n\n619\n00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.650\nSo let's just take a look here.\n\n620\n00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.740\nWe'll enable those, when we do you'll\nnotice that we get some additional options\n\n621\n00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.660\nhere in the wizard off to the left\nthat we have to go through.\n\n622\n00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.250\nAdvanced settings is\nessentially the same idea.\n\n623\n00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:55.080\nWe go in and we could drill down\nfurther setting name spaces,\n\n624\n00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.610\nsetting methods, configuring\nexception of that monitoring so\n\n625\n00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.850\nwe could specify what kind of exceptions\nwe want, what's classified as critical.\n\n626\n00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:04.650\nWe can also go in and\n\n627\n00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:09.570\nprogram in the exact thresholds as well\nas the intervals for all the different\n\n628\n00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:13.280\nmonitors that we're gonna be engaging\nin to grab data right down here.\n\n629\n00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.630\nI'll just come down so\nyou can see all that.\n\n630\n00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:19.040\nNow, we can see that all of this is\navailable to us to interact with and\n\n631\n00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.690\nto program based on the exact\nspecification that we're looking for\n\n632\n00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.340\nwith regard to a monitor.\n\n633\n00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.660\nSo if we do advance Monitoring and\nwe do configuration.\n\n634\n00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.300\nIt's almost like fine-tuning or tweaking\nwithin the registry where we're editing\n\n635\n00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.760\nspecific settings and\nachieving certain end results.\n\n636\n00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.740\nSo we can go in,\nwe can set that here if we choose to.\n\n637\n00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.780\nWe're not gonna make changes but\njust so you can see that.\n\n638\n00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:43.589\nThe server-side and client-side\nconfigurations will look, essentially,\n\n639\n00:29:43.589 --> 00:29:44.670\nthe same.\n\n640\n00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:47.620\nLet's just click next there,\ngive that a second.\n\n641\n00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.390\nWhat we're gonna get is, there we go.\n\n642\n00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.755\nIt's always good to be connected.\n\n643\n00:29:53.755 --> 00:29:55.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What we're gonna get is,\n\n644\n00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.220\nsometimes you just have to take\na break for a second, rest, relax.\n\n645\n00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.910\nConsoles need a break just like we do,\nso they go away and then they come back.\n\n646\n00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.950\n&gt;&gt; And again, that's just,\nI guess not a symptom but\n\n647\n00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.500\njust a cause of that live environment.\n\n648\n00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.350\nIt's probably just, yeah well,\n\n649\n00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.990\nit's a flicker of the bandwidth\nmore than anything else.\n\n650\n00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:14.250\nJust a little blip in the Internet.\n\n651\n00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.215\nSomebody out there was probably\ndownloading something.\n\n652\n00:30:16.215 --> 00:30:18.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps watching the trailer for\n\n653\n00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.205\na new Marvel movie or who knows what.\n\n654\n00:30:20.205 --> 00:30:21.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so anyway,\n\n655\n00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.650\nso you see that we have the ability\nto drill in do the advanced settings,\n\n656\n00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.850\nclick next here.\n\n657\n00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.180\nYou'll see that we have our\ncustomized component for\n\n658\n00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.230\nindividual application component screen.\n\n659\n00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:31.760\nServer-side components.\n\n660\n00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.840\nWe have that here.\n\n661\n00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.290\nWe can go in and customize.\n\n662\n00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.390\nYou'll see that same exact screen I was\njust showing you for advanced settings but\n\n663\n00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:38.840\nspecific to the app.\n\n664\n00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.310\nSo we have the ability to drill\nthrough here on the server side.\n\n665\n00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:46.630\nWe also have the ability to do\nthe same thing on the client side.\n\n666\n00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.210\nTurn on the exception monitoring,\nwhatever it is we may want,\n\n667\n00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.700\nspecify the IP addresses that\nwill be used for monitoring.\n\n668\n00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.980\nRight now we have our loop back address,\nin IPv4, and\n\n669\n00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.310\nour loop back in IPv6::1 sitting up there.\n\n670\n00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:05.740\nSo we can see that and specify what\nwe're gonna do there if required.\n\n671\n00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:12.360\nAnd then we can enable our client-side\nmonitoring for the web app.\n\n672\n00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.010\nIf we have set up any of that we would\nbe able to see specifications here.\n\n673\n00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.232\nAnd then go ahead we'll click next.\n\n674\n00:31:19.232 --> 00:31:22.635\nYou'll see may need to be restarted for\nus to do this.\n\n675\n00:31:22.635 --> 00:31:24.065\nJust warning us, no big deal.\n\n676\n00:31:24.065 --> 00:31:24.565\nIt's fine.\n\n677\n00:31:24.565 --> 00:31:26.475\nWe'll click create.\n\n678\n00:31:26.475 --> 00:31:29.555\n&gt;&gt; Now if you had to,\nif you allow that client-side monitoring,\n\n679\n00:31:29.555 --> 00:31:32.075\nthat would also have to be\nconfigured on that client machine?\n\n680\n00:31:33.475 --> 00:31:37.655\n&gt;&gt; No because the client-side\nmonitoring is going to be done\n\n681\n00:31:37.655 --> 00:31:40.135\nfrom the agent that is sitting on.\n\n682\n00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.400\nSo no, there's no configuration.\n\n683\n00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.560\nWe have the monitoring that\ntakes place on the server side\n\n684\n00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.610\nthrough the monitoring agent,\nthe SCOM agent.\n\n685\n00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.320\nIt's been renamed\nthe Microsoft Monitoring Agent.\n\n686\n00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.430\nThen what we're doing is we're looking at,\nfrom the client perspective,\n\n687\n00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.410\nwe're looking at transactional data\nthat represents inbound connections.\n\n688\n00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.030\nSo we're pulling the data\noff the Web server, but\n\n689\n00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.630\nit's a question of what data we look at.\n\n690\n00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Client-side monitoring is about being\n\n691\n00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.040\nable to, we would specify the IP address\nthere that we wanna monitor, and\n\n692\n00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.240\nthen we would then be able to pull\nthat data in from that machine,\n\n693\n00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.730\nlooking at the inbound data.\n\n694\n00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.440\nWe tag the IP, in other words, we look\nat the inbound data in the logs, and\n\n695\n00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.390\nwe're pulling in that data\nfrom the monitor server.\n\n696\n00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.310\nWe don't really have to\nconfigure anything else,\n\n697\n00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:21.810\nthere's nothing weird to worry about.\n\n698\n00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:25.700\nAll right, you'll see here,\nwe do now have our app set up.\n\n699\n00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.690\nIt's going to take a few\nminutes to spin up and\n\n700\n00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.000\nsubstantiate itself on\nthe monitoring side,\n\n701\n00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.350\nas we already showed you the output of\nwhat the prior app would look like.\n\n702\n00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:37.966\nBut, this is what we would to to stand up\nand enable APM monitoring end to end on\n\n703\n00:32:37.966 --> 00:32:43.030\nthe server or in SCOM and then obviously,\ntargeting whatever web app we're using.\n\n704\n00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.870\nAnd then we've shown you through\nthe beginning of this demo\n\n705\n00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.430\nall the output that we would get from that\nand the ways that we consume that data.\n\n706\n00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:53.270\nWith Health Explorer and the various\nmonitoring information that we can use,\n\n707\n00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.160\nthe Network View, to see the diagram and\n\n708\n00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.300\nthe connectivity,\nthe interconnectivity of the application.\n\n709\n00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there we go.\n\n710\n00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.270\nWe can monitor Cherokee1 now.\n\n711\n00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.837\n&gt;&gt; Can monitor Cherokee1\nin our staging environment,\n\n712\n00:33:03.837 --> 00:33:06.800\ncuz that's where we said\nCherokee1 was gonna be deployed.\n\n713\n00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So we actually\n\n714\n00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.400\nhave it sitting in our staging\nenvironment right now.\n\n715\n00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.310\nAbsolutely.\n\n716\n00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.210\n&gt;&gt; All right so, are we good to go?\n\n717\n00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.820\nIs there anything else we need to do for\nthis particular lab?\n\n718\n00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.920\n&gt;&gt; No I think for this one we are good.\n\n719\n00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, well thank you so\nmuch Adam for showing us how to do that.\n\n720\n00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.070\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n721\n00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.540\nBut stay tuned we do have more\nmonitoring and operating information,\n\n722\n00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.640\nheaded your way.\n\n723\n00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.710\nI'm going to go ahead and\nsign out as your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n724\n00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:29.400\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n725\n00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.990\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n726\n00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:38.146\n[MUSIC]\n\n727\n00:33:38.146 --> 00:33:41.015\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.260\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.871\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:15.660\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Datacenter Monitoring\nwith Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.450\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.160\nIn this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.260\nwe will be demonstrating how to configure\nnotification accounts for alerts.\n\n9\n00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.090\nWith us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.839\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:27.855\n&gt;&gt; Hola\n&gt;&gt; Hi.\n\n12\n00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.449\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Feeling a little Spanish flair coming\n\n13\n00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.012\non today.\n\n14\n00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:32.995\nPerhaps it's my bright attire,\nI don't know.\n\n15\n00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:35.159\nI've been told it's lovely,\nbut I'm not sure if it is.\n\n16\n00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.227\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's called Flamenco pink.\n\n17\n00:00:37.227 --> 00:00:39.642\n&gt;&gt; It could be, although I don't\nknow how to do the Flamenco.\n\n18\n00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:42.770\nSo if it is, we're out of luck\nbecause this is all you're gonna get.\n\n19\n00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.557\nSo, we are going to talk about\nconfiguring notification accounts for\n\n20\n00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:46.559\nsubscribing to alerts.\n\n21\n00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.798\nNow we've actually talked about this\nin other episodes in our series, and\n\n22\n00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:54.835\nwe've actually done a demonstration\non how to set up subscriptions and\n\n23\n00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:56.329\nnotification accounts.\n\n24\n00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.452\nBut we're gonna run you back\nthrough it here, as well,\n\n25\n00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:04.046\nin the context of how we do enable and\nset up application performance monitoring.\n\n26\n00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:06.923\nCuz it is important to be able to\ntake the output of that monitoring,\n\n27\n00:01:06.923 --> 00:01:09.702\nas we've been talking about in\nsome of our prior conversations.\n\n28\n00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.940\nAnd be able to create\nactionable items with it.\n\n29\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.568\nAnd being able to take those alerts and\nbe made aware of them, subscribe to them.\n\n30\n00:01:15.568 --> 00:01:17.821\nAnd then be notified that we\nmay need to do something,\n\n31\n00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:20.240\nis gonna be one of the ways in\nwhich we consume that data.\n\n32\n00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.650\nSo we're gonna start by taking a look in\nthe console, our administration workspace.\n\n33\n00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.156\nWe are down about halfway to three\nquarters towards the bottom here,\n\n34\n00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:31.525\nwe're in the run-as configuration here,\nas you can see.\n\n35\n00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:35.223\nWe're gonna right-click here,\nwe're gonna choose create run-as account.\n\n36\n00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:38.154\nBefore we do this, just a quick\nword to remind you of this, or\n\n37\n00:01:38.154 --> 00:01:41.659\ntell you first time if you haven't\nseen any of the other conversations in\n\n38\n00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.465\nthe other episodes about this.\n\n39\n00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:44.975\nWe have a two-step process.\n\n40\n00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:48.330\nWe're gonna create run-as accounts first,\n&gt;&gt; And then we're gonna go back,\n\n41\n00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.709\nlink that to a Run As profile.\n\n42\n00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.930\nSo that way, those two things\ntogether can then be used and\n\n43\n00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.480\ndistributed to the management servers.\n\n44\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.880\nWe can then consume information.\n\n45\n00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.390\nSo we're gonna go through and\nsee how that takes place.\n\n46\n00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.645\nLet's start by creating a Run As account,\ngo ahead and we'll click here.\n\n47\n00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:06.426\nWe've got our Wizard,\ncreate our Run As account Welcome screen.\n\n48\n00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.466\nWe'll just move this over\njust a little bit, so\n\n49\n00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:11.979\nyou guys can see how that happens here.\n\n50\n00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:16.494\nAnd we are able to stay away\nfrom our floating blue box, and\n\n51\n00:02:16.494 --> 00:02:19.071\nour box in box and box\n&gt;&gt; Boxes everywhere,\n\n52\n00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.670\njust boxes boxes boxes.\n\n53\n00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.940\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click next,\n\n54\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.920\nwe're gonna then choose what kind of\nrun as account type we want to use.\n\n55\n00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.460\nNow we have different\nrun as account types,\n\n56\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.050\nthere are a whole bunch of\nthem there as you can see.\n\n57\n00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.850\nWe have Windows, we have community string.\n\n58\n00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.910\nCommunity string is the equivalent\nof S and MP version two,\n\n59\n00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.470\nsimple network matters from protocol,\nversion two.\n\n60\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.030\nCommunity string would be\nthe shared secret or password.\n\n61\n00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.890\nThat is used to be able to access the\nconfiguration of the devices through SNMP.\n\n62\n00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.713\nWe have basic authentication, simple\nauthentication, digest authentication,\n\n63\n00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:54.440\ndifferent options you\nhopefully are familiar with.\n\n64\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.230\nWe have binary authentication,\nuser choice.\n\n65\n00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.850\nIn other words, binary authentication\nmeans user subscribes and\n\n66\n00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.350\ndefines what the authentication\nmechanism will be.\n\n67\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.189\nWe have the action account.\n\n68\n00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.388\nWe've talked about accounts,\nand action accounts,\n\n69\n00:03:05.388 --> 00:03:07.380\nthroughout many of our episodes to date.\n\n70\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.780\nThese are the accounts that are set up and\nused as we configure\n\n71\n00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.830\nSystem Center Ops Manager to be\nable to do a variety of things.\n\n72\n00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.996\nWe'd use one of those and/or SPV3,\nour version three account.\n\n73\n00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:21.617\nFor SNMP is just a newer version of\nthe SNMP protocol, and we would use\n\n74\n00:03:21.617 --> 00:03:25.435\na different approach of mechanism to\nauthenticate if that was the case.\n\n75\n00:03:25.435 --> 00:03:29.375\nSo we're gonna choose Windows here because\nwe are using Windows infrastructure.\n\n76\n00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.665\nWe have to give this a name.\n\n77\n00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:33.685\nWe'll go ahead, we'll name our account.\n\n78\n00:03:33.685 --> 00:03:38.164\nI'm gonna go ahead and call it test app.\n\n79\n00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:45.208\nItprotv, whoops, user.\n\n80\n00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:47.681\nI think I got that right.\n\n81\n00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:49.960\nClose enough for government work, anyway.\n\n82\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.705\nSo, testapp_itprotv_user,\nwe'll go ahead and click next there.\n\n83\n00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:58.010\nWe have to specify our actual\nuser name and our password.\n\n84\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.942\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll use the test user Account.\n\n85\n00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:10.450\nNow in the real world you would\njust well type in the password,\n\n86\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.440\nyou would provide an actual user account\nthat exist in the domain here, right?\n\n87\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.100\nWe're just using a sample account,\nwe're not using necessarily and\n\n88\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.370\nactual account that would\nexist In your domain.\n\n89\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.420\nWe are just making it clear that\nyou would have to substitute in\n\n90\n00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.730\nan actual account value\nhere that makes sense.\n\n91\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.990\nThe account that you are going to\ndecide is going to be assigned\n\n92\n00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.240\nto this monitoring function.\n\n93\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.645\nWe've got our domain here,\npractice labs.com.\n\n94\n00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:36.930\nWe'll click, next.\n\n95\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.850\nWe then have to specify how we're gonna\nselect our distribution security option.\n\n96\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.900\nIf we do less secure,\nwhich is not the default choice, but\n\n97\n00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.920\nthe one that is above\nthe default choice right here.\n\n98\n00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.120\nWe will then have this credential\nautomatically distributed\n\n99\n00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.330\nto all managed computers.\n\n100\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.480\nIn other words, System Center Ops Manager\nwill distribute for us this credential.\n\n101\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.420\nSet it up on all the systems that\nwe want to do the monitoring on, so\n\n102\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.010\nwe don't have to worry about doing that.\n\n103\n00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.890\nWhich is more secure,\ndefault choice at the bottom.\n\n104\n00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.239\nWe have to manually decide in\nthe next process step as we go and\n\n105\n00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:09.931\nconfigure the run-as profile and\nlink the accounts and profile.\n\n106\n00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:14.609\nWe will then have to decide which\nmachine's on Tab that we get\n\n107\n00:05:14.609 --> 00:05:16.915\nwill actually be specified.\n\n108\n00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:19.446\nWe'll have to go and\nmanually click add, and\n\n109\n00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:24.025\nput in the servers that we actually then\nwant to have this account set up for.\n\n110\n00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:24.837\nSo we have an option here.\n\n111\n00:05:24.837 --> 00:05:26.325\nIt's up to us to decide.\n\n112\n00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:29.895\nMore secure, involves us\ninteracting with the process and\n\n113\n00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:33.150\nspecifying a pick list\nof the targeted systems.\n\n114\n00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.380\nLess secure, distributed to all\nof the monitor manage computers\n\n115\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.412\nthat are currently in and are set up as\npart of our management infrastructure.\n\n116\n00:05:42.412 --> 00:05:44.679\nSo we're gonna decide how to do that.\n\n117\n00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.530\nI'm gonna choose more secure, just so\n\n118\n00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.246\nyou can see what that looks like when we\nhave to go back and program in that list.\n\n119\n00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:52.348\nBut we can change it at\nany point while we go.\n\n120\n00:05:52.348 --> 00:05:55.101\nSo we'll leave it at more secure,\nwe'll click, Create.\n\n121\n00:05:55.101 --> 00:05:58.480\nIt says, hey, by the way,\nyou went ahead and did this.\n\n122\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.870\nYou now have to set up the Run As\naccount with the profile.\n\n123\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.520\nWarning, you're gonna\nhave to configure it.\n\n124\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.993\nThat's not the screen I was talking about.\n\n125\n00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:07.961\nWe're gonna see another screen at the end\nof the Run As profile wizard here in\n\n126\n00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:11.320\njust a minute, and that's the screen\nwhere we make the choice.\n\n127\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.850\nSo just telling you what this looks like\nand making sure you're familiar with this.\n\n128\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.958\nSo let's do this, we'll then go in here.\n\n129\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.473\nWe'll go to our profiles area, and\nwe could see this before we do this,\n\n130\n00:06:20.473 --> 00:06:21.770\nwe have our account here.\n\n131\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.730\nAnd we have our test app\nIT Pro TV user account,\n\n132\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.040\nyou could see it right down there.\n\n133\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.750\nSo we just created that account,\nthat is our run as account,\n\n134\n00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.970\nthat's the one that we have set up and\n\n135\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.380\nnow what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nassociate it with a run as profile.\n\n136\n00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.380\nSo we're gonna go in Create\nprofile in step two here.\n\n137\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.070\nWe're going into then\nassociate this account.\n\n138\n00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.685\nSo we go into Run as, and\nwe're going into that,\n\n139\n00:06:46.685 --> 00:06:50.413\nwe're going to go into our Run as area.\n\n140\n00:06:50.413 --> 00:06:52.148\nAnd we're going to create\nour Run as profile.\n\n141\n00:06:52.148 --> 00:06:54.177\nI'm thinking what we're doing in it.\n\n142\n00:06:54.177 --> 00:06:55.653\nIt sounds good in my head,\nuntil I start saying it.\n\n143\n00:06:55.653 --> 00:06:57.670\nAnd then it comes out all backwards.\n\n144\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.563\nAll right, so run apps configuration,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n145\n00:07:00.563 --> 00:07:01.884\ncreate our run apps profile.\n\n146\n00:07:01.884 --> 00:07:03.368\nLet's go ahead and do that real quick.\n\n147\n00:07:03.368 --> 00:07:04.722\nSo let's grab this.\n\n148\n00:07:04.722 --> 00:07:09.191\nLet me just hide the taskbar here,\nbecause it's one of those wizards that\n\n149\n00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:14.167\ncomes up that you can't actually see the\nbottom lower little bit of screen there,\n\n150\n00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:15.340\nunless we do that.\n\n151\n00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.102\nWe'll just bump that up just a bit so\nyou can see that-\n\n152\n00:07:17.102 --> 00:07:18.601\n&gt;&gt; A little finagling?\n\n153\n00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:20.525\n&gt;&gt; A little finagling, yes.\n\n154\n00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:23.082\nI did not realize that you\nspoke Yiddish there, Cherokee.\n\n155\n00:07:23.082 --> 00:07:26.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're just full of surprises.\n\n156\n00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:27.850\nI would continue talking\nto you in Yiddish, but\n\n157\n00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.760\nI'm feeling that's probably\nabout as far as we're gonna get.\n\n158\n00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.502\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.\n\n159\n00:07:30.502 --> 00:07:32.765\n&gt;&gt; So I think that we'll just\ngive you credit for that one,\n\n160\n00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:34.898\nsay that was a good job\n&gt;&gt; And then-\n\n161\n00:07:34.898 --> 00:07:35.820\n&gt;&gt; Leave it at that.\n\n162\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.580\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go ahead,\nyeah, we're gonna move on.\n\n163\n00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.630\nAll right so, let's do the following.\n\n164\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.790\nNow actually before I do this\nlet me show you one quick thing,\n\n165\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.500\nI meant to show you this and I did forget.\n\n166\n00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.120\nSo we'll do the profile here in just\na sec, but let me just show you something.\n\n167\n00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.780\nSo with the account, right, if I go over\nhere to the account I can right-click,\n\n168\n00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.470\nlet me just go in and\nshow you what I was talking about here.\n\n169\n00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.641\nWe can go once we do have the account.\n\n170\n00:07:56.641 --> 00:07:57.897\n[INAUDIBLE] was good right there.\n\n171\n00:07:57.897 --> 00:08:01.351\nOnce we do out the account set up,\nwe can go to the distribution tab.\n\n172\n00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:06.370\nAnd as I said, we could change the setting\nthat we were talking about now, right.\n\n173\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.010\nBy doing add and\nthen adding in the servers or\n\n174\n00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.140\nwe could do what is I\nsaid just on to show you.\n\n175\n00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.909\nDo it from the run as profile\nwizard when we're done, that link\n\n176\n00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:17.423\non the run as profile page, will take us\nright back here, and we'll change it.\n\n177\n00:08:17.423 --> 00:08:18.609\nIt's just a matter of how we get there.\n\n178\n00:08:18.609 --> 00:08:22.947\nBut we could do it right from here if we\nwanted to add to the distribution area and\n\n179\n00:08:22.947 --> 00:08:26.860\nwe wanted to search by computer we\nactually could go in and do this.\n\n180\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.020\nAnd we'd be able to put\nthis in right here.\n\n181\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.380\nWe would just search by computer,\ndo a search.\n\n182\n00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.280\nWe will get our management server and\nwe can put that in if we want to.\n\n183\n00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.652\nI'll show you how to do that\noff the other screen, but\n\n184\n00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:41.120\nwe're gonna wind up in the same place,\nokay.\n\n185\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.020\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna create our profile.\n\n186\n00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.356\nLet's go up to Run as Configuration,\nright-click, Run as Profile.\n\n187\n00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:49.341\nBack to where we were just a minute ago.\n\n188\n00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:50.536\nWe'll click Next here.\n\n189\n00:08:50.536 --> 00:08:53.640\nWe have to go ahead and\ngive the profile a name.\n\n190\n00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.493\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do this, let me.\n\n191\n00:08:56.493 --> 00:08:58.395\nWhat are we gonna call this?\n\n192\n00:08:58.395 --> 00:09:02.223\nWe're gonna go ahead and we are going\nto call this, just one second,\n\n193\n00:09:02.223 --> 00:09:04.660\nhave it written down I promise, I did.\n\n194\n00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.450\nI just forgot to go down to the area\nwhere I see it so I can see.\n\n195\n00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.139\nAnd we're gonna call it\ntest notification account.\n\n196\n00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:16.749\nOkay, so all right, so let's do test\nnotifi I rant about this in some episodes.\n\n197\n00:09:16.749 --> 00:09:19.830\nBut the screen I'm using,\nyou guys can't see it while I'm working.\n\n198\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.140\nIt just looks normal to you.\n\n199\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.100\nBut, the screen dims like by 50%,\nif you don't keep using it constantly,\n\n200\n00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.310\nand then it will randomly\nbrighten back up again.\n\n201\n00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.140\nSo half of the time I'm typing\nyou see me doing this and\n\n202\n00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.240\nsquinting, it's because the screen is so\ndark, I can't see what I'm actually doing.\n\n203\n00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.667\nAll right, so, notification.\n\n204\n00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:37.960\nAccount, all right,\nit's test notification.\n\n205\n00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.200\nThen we will select our management\npack that we are going to be using.\n\n206\n00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.700\nWe'll put this in here and we'll put\nthis onto our default management pack.\n\n207\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.160\nRemember it is important, I haven't talked\nabout the run s profile what we do with\n\n208\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.460\nit, but it is important to be able\nto link this to our management pack.\n\n209\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.920\nBecause remember, the Run as Profile and\n\n210\n00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.550\nthe Run as Account linked together\nare going to be leveraging information\n\n211\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.060\nthat we need, and\nalso objects from the management pack.\n\n212\n00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.330\nAnd so, we have to make sure that we\nare linking them so that they can do that.\n\n213\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.697\nAnd we're going to be using\nour [COUGH] management packs,\n\n214\n00:10:11.697 --> 00:10:16.392\nthe default management pack as we did with\nour APM monitor when we set it up within\n\n215\n00:10:16.392 --> 00:10:19.920\nour .NET application template\nwe link it to manager pack.\n\n216\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.979\nSo we're gonna do a run as account, this\nis where we bring the Run as Account here.\n\n217\n00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:24.660\nGonna go ahead, we're gonna click here.\n\n218\n00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.022\nNow remember, we already have\nour Run as Account created,\n\n219\n00:10:28.022 --> 00:10:30.047\ndown at the bottom of the list here.\n\n220\n00:10:30.047 --> 00:10:32.810\nYou would choose when you do this,\nwhatever account you've created.\n\n221\n00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.450\nI'm choosing my test ITProTV User Account.\n\n222\n00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.139\nBut notice, I could create a brand new\naccount here if I wanted to, as well,\n\n223\n00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:39.728\non the fly.\n\n224\n00:10:39.728 --> 00:10:43.451\nDo we wanna, then, allow the account\nto be able to manage all objects,\n\n225\n00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:44.850\nwhatever they may be?\n\n226\n00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.760\nOr do we wanna use a certain\nselected class or subset of objects?\n\n227\n00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.190\nUp to us to decide.\n\n228\n00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.080\nBy default, all objects make sense,\nbecause then the account and\n\n229\n00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.660\nthe profile can be used to manage and\ninteract with any object.\n\n230\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.840\nAnd alerts from anywhere.\n\n231\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.854\nBut you may wanna trim or\nsomehow modify that through a filter, and\n\n232\n00:11:01.854 --> 00:11:04.950\nscope it to a more narrowly\ndefined set of objects.\n\n233\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.530\nThat would be up to you.\n\n234\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.400\nTo choose to do that,\nyou would select here.\n\n235\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.360\nYou would go, you would choose Class,\nObject or Group, whatever it may be.\n\n236\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.840\nAnd then based on that,\nyou have a search window that opens up.\n\n237\n00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.830\nYou can then from this pick list,\nonce it's populated, choose any object.\n\n238\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.454\nYou could see there's\na list of them there.\n\n239\n00:11:22.454 --> 00:11:26.238\nAnd depending on what we chose,\nwe would then be able to say,\n\n240\n00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:29.519\nI just want to put this onto\nmy Ops Manager database.\n\n241\n00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:32.528\nI know that doesn't say Ops Manager,\nit says Tim TV, but you get the idea.\n\n242\n00:11:32.528 --> 00:11:35.648\nCuz I would then have to go find\nthe Ops Manager database alphabetically.\n\n243\n00:11:35.648 --> 00:11:38.767\nBut the idea would be that it's in\nthe list, I could choose it, and\n\n244\n00:11:38.767 --> 00:11:42.113\nthen this would only be able to\ninteract with the Ops Manager database,\n\n245\n00:11:42.113 --> 00:11:43.530\nas opposed to anything else.\n\n246\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.130\nSo we have to decide what we want\nto do and how we want to do that.\n\n247\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.130\nWe'll leave it at All Targeted Objects,\n\n248\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:53.010\nmeaning anything within the default\nmanagement pack, click OK.\n\n249\n00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.180\nWe now have that there.\n\n250\n00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.580\nWe'll click, Create,\ngive that just a second.\n\n251\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.342\nThen we're gonna see that screen I was\ntalking about where we have to go back and\n\n252\n00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:02.798\nspecify the distribution for\nthe run as accounts.\n\n253\n00:12:02.798 --> 00:12:05.380\nSo we can actually link this\nto the appropriate servers and\n\n254\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.387\nhave it be monitored.\n\n255\n00:12:06.387 --> 00:12:07.930\nWe're gonna see what I was talking about.\n\n256\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.338\nWe'll click on the link here, go back to\nthat Distribution tab that I showed you.\n\n257\n00:12:12.338 --> 00:12:15.345\nWe'll either be able to program\nin the list under More Secure, or\n\n258\n00:12:15.345 --> 00:12:16.448\nswitch to Less Secure.\n\n259\n00:12:16.448 --> 00:12:19.620\nAnd just have a distributed force,\nit's up to us to decide.\n\n260\n00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.297\nBut you'll see here, there's a link.\n\n261\n00:12:21.297 --> 00:12:23.441\nWe can click here.\n\n262\n00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:25.739\nWhen we do this,\nthat should look familiar to you now.\n\n263\n00:12:25.739 --> 00:12:27.091\nYou can see we're actually,\n\n264\n00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:30.669\ngoing to be on the same tab that I showed\nyou by right-clicking on the account.\n\n265\n00:12:30.669 --> 00:12:33.098\nAnd then choosing properties and\ngoing into the editing it directly.\n\n266\n00:12:33.098 --> 00:12:35.070\nSo can do either way, it's up to you.\n\n267\n00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.220\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click, Add,\n\n268\n00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.370\nlike we did just a minute\nago when I showed you this.\n\n269\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.673\nWe'll click, Add, twice, cuz clicking\nonce does not seem to be enough.\n\n270\n00:12:42.673 --> 00:12:46.418\nAnd then we will go ahead,\nwe'll select our server as I showed you.\n\n271\n00:12:46.418 --> 00:12:48.090\nRemember I always have to click,\n\n272\n00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.925\nAdd there to make our selections that\nwe can drop it down, get our OK button.\n\n273\n00:12:51.925 --> 00:12:54.160\nWe'll do that,\nit's now gonna show up there.\n\n274\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.110\nWhen we click OK here you'll notice\nthat that warning sign has now gone.\n\n275\n00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.540\nWe no longer have the caution flag,\nwe have our green check.\n\n276\n00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.060\nSo now, once we're done with that,\njust move this over so\n\n277\n00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.240\nyou can see,\nwe'll click our close button right there.\n\n278\n00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.060\nAnd then we will have our profile.\n\n279\n00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.870\nJust go in here so we can see that.\n\n280\n00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.390\nTakes just a second and\nthen we'll have our profile here.\n\n281\n00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:23.210\nAnd we will sort so\nwe get that alphabetically and\n\n282\n00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:30.230\nwe can go down, take a minute typically to\npop in so you just have to wait for it.\n\n283\n00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.480\nWe've seen this happened in some of\nthe other demos where the console doesn't\n\n284\n00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.560\nUpdate and refresh right away,\nusually it takes about a minute, and\n\n285\n00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.790\nif it doesn't show up, you can always\nrefresh and you will see it there.\n\n286\n00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.210\nBut we could set that up, and\nonce we've got that all up and running,\n\n287\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:46.240\nand we do have that now, what we then\ncould do if we wanted to would be then\n\n288\n00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.360\nactually create a subscription that would\nallow us to be able to then consume that.\n\n289\n00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.724\nI just want to show that to you,\nthat part of it I just want to show you,\n\n290\n00:13:53.724 --> 00:13:55.649\nwhat we would do there really quickly.\n\n291\n00:13:55.649 --> 00:13:59.616\nBut I'm getting the sense,\nI'm using my extra special lovely shirt,\n\n292\n00:13:59.616 --> 00:14:01.005\nbright flamingo color,\n\n293\n00:14:01.005 --> 00:14:05.187\nspidey sense, that the woman standing\nnext to me may wanna ask a question.\n\n294\n00:14:05.187 --> 00:14:07.999\nCuz she's been jumping up and down,\ntrying to get my attention, for\n\n295\n00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:09.050\nlike five minutes.\n\n296\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.390\nSo what did you want to say, Cherokee?\n\n297\n00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.908\n&gt;&gt; I really didn't have a question, Adam.\n\n298\n00:14:11.908 --> 00:14:13.640\nBut is it really, that's it?\n\n299\n00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.419\nI mean in order to obtain\nthose notifications,\n\n300\n00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:17.651\ndo we have any additional steps\nthat we need to run through?\n\n301\n00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:20.870\n&gt;&gt; So we are going to take a look at just\nwhat we do with a subscription here.\n\n302\n00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.388\nSo once we have our profile.\n\n303\n00:14:22.388 --> 00:14:24.154\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Just trying to refresh to see if we\n\n304\n00:14:24.154 --> 00:14:25.500\nare gonna get that to pop in.\n\n305\n00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.110\nSometimes you have to actually wait for\nit and or\n\n306\n00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.750\nas I said, you may want to\nactually close the console.\n\n307\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.880\nYou've seen me do that once or\ntwice as well, and bring that back in.\n\n308\n00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.970\nLet's go ahead and we'll do that real\nquick, sometimes the console does.\n\n309\n00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:38.660\n&gt;&gt; Bring it back in.\n\n310\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.605\n&gt;&gt; Like, yeah, when you go ahead and\nyou, whoops, that's not what I wanted.\n\n311\n00:14:41.605 --> 00:14:44.180\n[LAUGH] Could've sworn I\nhit open the console there.\n\n312\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.690\nAll right, so\nIt's random mouse day here at ITPROTV.\n\n313\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.970\nYes, sometimes closing and\nreopening the console just allows us to\n\n314\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.600\nget those kinds of things\nto show back up quickly.\n\n315\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.430\nWhen we are waiting on them they just\ndon't seem to behave the right way,\n\n316\n00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:04.970\nso let's go back in there and\nthen we should get our profile.\n\n317\n00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.558\nWhat did I call our profile.\n\n318\n00:15:06.558 --> 00:15:11.810\nThat's an [INAUDIBLE] right there,\nttest notification.\n\n319\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.900\nRight.\nCuz I couldn't spell correctly cuz\n\n320\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.160\nas I said,\nit's hard to see what was going in there.\n\n321\n00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.980\nBut you could see now\nit has popped in there.\n\n322\n00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.560\nYou could see it right down there and\nwe see the profile is there.\n\n323\n00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.630\nSo to Cherokee's question, hey okay so\ngreat, what do we do with that?\n\n324\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.360\nWe come up here to notifications\nnow in the workspace.\n\n325\n00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.420\nSo we're gonna go up just a little\nbit above where we were with run as,\n\n326\n00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.830\nwe're just Move this downs so you could\nsee it over here on the left a little bit.\n\n327\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.350\nAnd then what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna be able to come in here.\n\n328\n00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:43.540\nAnd we have channels, we have\nsubscriptions, and we have subscribers.\n\n329\n00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.780\nAnd what we do at that\npoint is we can go ahead.\n\n330\n00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.270\nAnd we've been, through in other episodes,\nthe entire thought process about channels.\n\n331\n00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.230\nNotifications or excuse me,\nunder notifications.\n\n332\n00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.250\nChannel subscribers and subscriptions.\n\n333\n00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.950\nI'm not gonna go reproduce that\nentire thought process and\n\n334\n00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.240\nall the demo steps again.\n\n335\n00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.470\nIt actually takes about\nanother 15 minutes to work\n\n336\n00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.000\nthrough all the logic of everything,\nbring it all together.\n\n337\n00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.370\nBut the short version of it\nis we then can go ahead and\n\n338\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.230\nwe can come in here and\nyou'll see we have new channels.\n\n339\n00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.130\nAnd we can do this via email through SMTP.\n\n340\n00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.760\nWe can do this by instant messaging,\nso IM.\n\n341\n00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.060\nWe can do text messaging,\nping-ponging through SMS.\n\n342\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.650\nWe can do a command, so\nour ability to be able to subscribe\n\n343\n00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.390\nthrough a channel is then\ngonna be configured here.\n\n344\n00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.700\nThis is the format we will then be able\nto send and receive information across.\n\n345\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.250\nWe're then able to use subscribers,\nusers that are specified.\n\n346\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.170\nAccounts that will be used to get data.\n\n347\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.580\nAnd then subscriptions, setting up and\nessentially saying I wanna dedicate\n\n348\n00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.730\na channel and I wanna receive information\nand I wanna be notified about things\n\n349\n00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.400\nwhen alerts happen or\nchanges are made or whatever.\n\n350\n00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.680\nBy using all of the notification\narea information items here linking\n\n351\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.200\nto the account or the profile we're using,\nwe could actually get information and\n\n352\n00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.860\ntake that down and\nInteract within a variety of ways.\n\n353\n00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.860\nWe did this other part in one\nof the other discussions and\n\n354\n00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.770\ndemos in other episodes and you could\nsee all that brought together there.\n\n355\n00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.230\nThis part was really just designed\nto show you the run as account or\n\n356\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.770\nrun as profiles, specifically.\n\n357\n00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:12.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you have it.\n\n358\n00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.850\nThat's how you go ahead and\nconfigure those notifications for alerts.\n\n359\n00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.260\nI thank you so much, Adam,\nfor joining us today.\n\n360\n00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.140\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for joining as well,\n\n361\n00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.780\nbut stay tuned we have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n362\n00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.350\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n363\n00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:25.938\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n364\n00:17:25.938 --> 00:17:26.806\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n365\n00:17:26.806 -->

00:00:08.269\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.061\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:12.979\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, ladies and\n\n6\n00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.048\ngentlemen to your Datacenter Monitoring\nwith Microsoft SCOM Series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.906\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.906 --> 00:00:22.577\nAnd this episode will be looking at web\napplication availability monitoring.\n\n9\n00:00:22.577 --> 00:00:25.688\nAnd with us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:25.688 --> 00:00:27.233\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:32.226\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like the mime episode,\nbut not quite, right?\n\n12\n00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:33.889\nHopefully, everybodies doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:36.013\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're going to jump in, and\n\n14\n00:00:36.013 --> 00:00:38.193\ncontinue our hands on demonstrations.\n\n15\n00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:41.082\nWe're gonna take a look at\nas Cherokee was just saying,\n\n16\n00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:44.860\nsynthetic transaction monitoring with or\nfor, against a website.\n\n17\n00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.600\nWe're gonna run through using another one\nof our monitoring pack templates to set up\n\n18\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.403\nif you haven't seen the prior episode.\n\n19\n00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:54.874\nWe did with the .NET template for APM for\napplication performance monitoring,\n\n20\n00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:57.053\nencourage you to go take a look at that.\n\n21\n00:00:57.053 --> 00:00:59.419\nWe're gonna use that same thought process,\nbut\n\n22\n00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:02.600\nuse the Web Application\nAvailability Monitoring template.\n\n23\n00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.020\nWe'll spin that up and we'll take a look\nat the difference between the local and\n\n24\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.250\npotentially outside in\ntransaction monitoring or\n\n25\n00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.730\navailability of transaction monitoring.\n\n26\n00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.191\nSomething called\nGlobal Service Monitoring,\n\n27\n00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:14.400\nit's kind of an interesting concept.\n\n28\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.710\nWe'll take a look at that as we go.\n\n29\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.518\nSo if we can jump in here,\nwe'll do a little show and tell.\n\n30\n00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:21.056\nMore show than tell hopefully, but\n\n31\n00:01:21.056 --> 00:01:23.323\nI think that we'll probably\nhave a mixture of both.\n\n32\n00:01:23.323 --> 00:01:26.926\nSo we're gonna highlight our\nWeb Application Availability Monitoring\n\n33\n00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:27.760\ntemplate here.\n\n34\n00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.620\nYou can see it's selected, right-click\nlike we've done, add Monitoring Wizard,\n\n35\n00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.880\nwe're gonna go in and do that,\ngive us just a second to spin up.\n\n36\n00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.580\nWe'll make sure that we choose Web\nApplication Availability Monitoring here.\n\n37\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.064\nAnd you can see we tailor our selection\nand of course, then our script changes.\n\n38\n00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:47.647\nAnd we have the appropriate areas on\nthe left that we're gonna fill in,\n\n39\n00:01:47.647 --> 00:01:48.970\nscreen by screen as we go.\n\n40\n00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.710\nWe'll click Next, we're then gonna\ngo ahead and give this a name.\n\n41\n00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.777\nWe'll call it WebAppMonitor,\ncall it anything you would like.\n\n42\n00:01:57.777 --> 00:02:01.230\nWe'll then go ahead,\nwe'll put in our management pack.\n\n43\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.890\nWe've talked about the importance\nof associated management pack\n\n44\n00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.590\nwith our monitors, so\nwe get all the objects.\n\n45\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.560\nWe have access to all the resources\nthe management pack provides.\n\n46\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.961\nWe're gonna name our website URLs websites\nplural ,if there's more than one,\n\n47\n00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:16.653\nthat we would like to monitor.\n\n48\n00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:21.460\nYou'll see we just add\nthem in here in a list.\n\n49\n00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.378\nSo we'll just do MSN.com.\n\n50\n00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:28.976\nLet's say that we also wanna do,\n\n51\n00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:32.096\nwhoops, itprotv, so\n\n52\n00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:38.210\nwe'll put in http://www.itpro.tv.\n\n53\n00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.600\nAnd you would put in the list of URLs for\n\n54\n00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.275\nall the websites that would you\nlike to be able to monitor.\n\n55\n00:02:44.275 --> 00:02:46.320\nThis would be of course,\nin the real world.\n\n56\n00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.019\nThe question of you figuring out what\nwebsites you wanna pay attention to.\n\n57\n00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.688\nAnd wanna be able to draw data down from\nin order to understand the health and\n\n58\n00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:57.450\nthe performance of them which\nare the key things we're focusing on.\n\n59\n00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.811\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n60\n00:02:59.811 --> 00:03:02.910\nAnd by the way, I forgot to tell you,\nI should just point out.\n\n61\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.903\nBut you could do HTTP and\nor HTTPS here, right?\n\n62\n00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:05.572\nJust so you know.\n\n63\n00:03:05.572 --> 00:03:09.420\nEven though it doesn't say cuz\nit's an empty text screen it in.\n\n64\n00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.315\nBut you do actually have the ability\nto do HTTP or HTTPS monitoring.\n\n65\n00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:16.060\nSo I just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n66\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.010\nHere, under select the location from\nwhere you want URLs to be monitored.\n\n67\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.328\nSo you ever played the game,\nWhere in the world is Waldo?\n\n68\n00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:26.600\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know it was a game,\nbut I thought it was like a book.\n\n69\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.659\n&gt;&gt; It's a book, it's a game.\n\n70\n00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.083\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess it is a game if\nyou're trying to erase someone.\n\n71\n00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:30.874\n&gt;&gt; You have young ones.\n\n72\n00:03:30.874 --> 00:03:31.453\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n73\n00:03:31.453 --> 00:03:34.282\n&gt;&gt; You probably read the book\nI'm assuming with them and or\n\n74\n00:03:34.282 --> 00:03:37.530\nperhaps occasionally there's\nlike all TV cartoon thing.\n\n75\n00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.465\nSo the idea with Where's Waldo, right?\n\n76\n00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:42.195\nIs Waldo goes around or\nDora the Explorer, right?\n\n77\n00:03:42.195 --> 00:03:43.641\nAnd I forget what her monkey is.\n\n78\n00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:45.020\n&gt;&gt; Where's Adam,\ncan we slap you in that shirt?\n\n79\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.961\n&gt;&gt; Where's Adam, you can do that as well-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n80\n00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:48.157\n&gt;&gt; You could track me using the shirt.\n\n81\n00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:51.320\nIt would not be hard to find me\nif I was wearing this shirt.\n\n82\n00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.947\nBut you can think about the concept of\nWhere's Waldo when we think about location\n\n83\n00:03:55.947 --> 00:03:57.931\nbased URL tracking here, right?\n\n84\n00:03:57.931 --> 00:04:02.918\nBecause we have two options, we can\ntrack and or monitor the website from\n\n85\n00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:08.660\nan internal monitor monitoring agent\nthat is sitting inside of our network.\n\n86\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.195\nIf this website is sitting in\na DMZ hosting on one of our web\n\n87\n00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:16.226\nservers in the DMZ in our datacenter.\n\n88\n00:04:16.226 --> 00:04:20.760\nWe may want to monitor it from inside the\nnetwork to look at aspects of performance\n\n89\n00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.950\nthat are specific to\nthe communication pathway.\n\n90\n00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.700\nInside of the network right\nbehind the firewall or firewalls,\n\n91\n00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.740\ndepending on where they are, but\nessentially in the LAN, for the most part.\n\n92\n00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.090\nWe could also potentially monitor\nfrom the outside in using\n\n93\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.910\nwhat is referred to,\non the screen you can probably see it.\n\n94\n00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.334\nBut it's a little bit hard to see,\nit's small, but Global Service Monitor,\n\n95\n00:04:43.334 --> 00:04:44.350\nwhat we call GSM.\n\n96\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.915\nAnd a GSM is outside in,\nwe have what are called watcher nodes that\n\n97\n00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:55.250\nare pre-positioned around the globe in\nMicrosoft fabric in their datacenters.\n\n98\n00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.370\nAnd we can leverage those to\nactually then create monitoring, or\n\n99\n00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.330\nwe can decide that we're gonna\nhave our own watcher nodes, right?\n\n100\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.568\nSo we may have a Global Enterprise\nwith infrastructure around the world.\n\n101\n00:05:07.568 --> 00:05:12.839\nWe may then wanna be able to utilize or\nspecify, hey, these machines sitting\n\n102\n00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:18.180\nout there in Spain, needs in London,\nneeds in Germany, or wherever.\n\n103\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.940\nWe wanna use them to\nactually do the monitoring.\n\n104\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.350\nAnd so Global Service Monitoring is\noutside in monitoring that allows us to\n\n105\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.592\nmonitor from outside of the network.\n\n106\n00:05:27.592 --> 00:05:30.408\nAnd look at traffic flow and\nlook at performance and\n\n107\n00:05:30.408 --> 00:05:34.207\ninformation from the outside this\nwill be the perspective of the user\n\n108\n00:05:34.207 --> 00:05:36.041\nconnecting into the web server,\n\n109\n00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:40.320\nas opposed to inside the server connected\nto the rest of our infrastructure.\n\n110\n00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.803\nAnd we most likely wanna\nbe able to use and do both,\n\n111\n00:05:42.803 --> 00:05:44.638\nbecause it's gonna be important for\n\n112\n00:05:44.638 --> 00:05:48.150\nus to have those perspectives with\nregards to how we monitor, right?\n\n113\n00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.090\n&gt;&gt; So those external entities are they\nable to monitor our internal or\n\n114\n00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.430\nour private websites?\n\n115\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.331\nDo we have to give them access or\nare they only monitoring public websites?\n\n116\n00:05:58.331 --> 00:06:00.250\n&gt;&gt; No,\nwell they're gonna monitor our websites.\n\n117\n00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.534\nRemember, if they're watching\nnodes that we control,\n\n118\n00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:04.067\nthey have monitoring agents on them.\n\n119\n00:06:04.067 --> 00:06:07.270\nThey're part of our fabric,\npart of our infrastructure.\n\n120\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.230\nIf we are hooked up to Microsoft and\nusing Azure, and we're using the Azure\n\n121\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.800\nfabric to do monitoring,\nwe are using Microsoft's infrastructure.\n\n122\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.074\nBut again,\nwe're giving it the ability to be part\n\n123\n00:06:17.074 --> 00:06:17.675\nof our own-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n124\n00:06:17.675 --> 00:06:20.680\n&gt;&gt; Infrastructure by extending and\nconnecting to it.\n\n125\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.969\nSo you're absolutely right to call\nthat out because essentially, yeah,\n\n126\n00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.583\nwe do need to have these systems somehow\nidentified and integrated in our fabric.\n\n127\n00:06:27.583 --> 00:06:28.988\nWe didn't want monitoring\n\n128\n00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:30.165\ndone by strangers-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n129\n00:06:30.165 --> 00:06:31.223\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That wouldn't be good.\n\n130\n00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:32.683\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So mommy always said stranger, danger.\n\n131\n00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:33.685\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you\n\n132\n00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:34.840\npay attention to that, right?\n\n133\n00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.891\nSo if a strange monitoring\nservice comes up and says, hey,\n\n134\n00:06:37.891 --> 00:06:39.240\nwe wanna offer you a deal.\n\n135\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.304\nRun away quickly, right-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n136\n00:06:40.304 --> 00:06:41.204\n&gt;&gt; Don't pay attention to that.\n\n137\n00:06:41.204 --> 00:06:43.038\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhat we're gonna do here, right?\n\n138\n00:06:43.038 --> 00:06:45.234\nIs we're gonna use our add button\nas you can see right here.\n\n139\n00:06:45.234 --> 00:06:49.378\nAnd we're gonna go ahead we're gonna\nclick, and we're gonna have to decide what\n\n140\n00:06:49.378 --> 00:06:53.410\nthe location will be that we monitor\nfrom the list that's available to us.\n\n141\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.717\nRight now, it's install or\nrather internal location agent base.\n\n142\n00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:59.900\nWe're gonna, for the purpose of\nthe demo using internal agents.\n\n143\n00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.191\nBut we talked about fact,\nwe could brought them this out.\n\n144\n00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:06.020\nWe did go out and click on the link for\nGlobal Service Monitoring.\n\n145\n00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.810\nWe would actually be able to go find some\ninformation out here just really quickly.\n\n146\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.147\nOut on the Microsoft website\nabout the datacenter fabric,\n\n147\n00:07:14.147 --> 00:07:16.870\nthe Azure fabric and everything.\n\n148\n00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.070\nIn the Cloud platform area,\nyou could go out and\n\n149\n00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.720\ndo a little bit of search\non a Global Service.\n\n150\n00:07:27.707 --> 00:07:30.911\nOf course, you would have to\nspell correctly which is one\n\n151\n00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:33.800\nof my biggest problems monitoring, right?\n\n152\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.710\nBut you can go out and do a search here,\nand you would then be able to get\n\n153\n00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.230\ninformation about\nthe Global Service Monitor from TechNet.\n\n154\n00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.581\nUsually we show you this\nkind of information and\n\n155\n00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:48.640\nwe'll put it up and you can go in.\n\n156\n00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.602\nClick here, just get a little\ninformation about the idea of\n\n157\n00:07:51.602 --> 00:07:54.695\nthis outside in monitoring with\nthe Global Service Monitor.\n\n158\n00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:58.644\nAnd you can read up on it and understand\nthe different kinds of monitoring.\n\n159\n00:07:58.644 --> 00:07:59.770\nThat are available.\n\n160\n00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.698\nWe're gonna to be able to\ndo two monitor types, and\n\n161\n00:08:02.698 --> 00:08:05.910\ntalk about web application\navailability monitoring.\n\n162\n00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.370\nYou can single URLs.\n\n163\n00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.460\nWe'll talk about Visual Studio,\nweb test monitoring.\n\n164\n00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.780\nRunning multi-step authentication and\nmonitoring against the site,\n\n165\n00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.730\nto check performance.\n\n166\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.640\nSo, you have different options.\n\n167\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.830\nWe do talk about test maximums and\n\n168\n00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.430\nlocations a little bit here,\nwhich is nice.\n\n169\n00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.750\nSo we go through and give you some\ninformation, about how all this is set up.\n\n170\n00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.800\nWe talk about test parameters here.\n\n171\n00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.420\nMaximum number of requests per web test,\n100.\n\n172\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.500\nMaximum web test file size,\nthe subscriptions per tenant.\n\n173\n00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.670\nYou get this with your Azure subscription\nif you're going to do GSM monitoring.\n\n174\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.930\nIt's part of the Azure Fabric.\n\n175\n00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.550\nYou'll be able to get that ,and hook that\nup, as part of what we were talking about.\n\n176\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.730\nAnd you could see,\nwe have 16 different, currently, anyway.\n\n177\n00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.380\n16 locations that are set up.\n\n178\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.880\nthat Microsoft maintains.\n\n179\n00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.520\nThis list does update over time, so\n\n180\n00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.940\nobviously, you would have to make sure\nyou'd get the most recent information.\n\n181\n00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:59.640\nBut you'll see here, they have data\ncenter monitors in most geographies.\n\n182\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.770\nSo they got them in Europe,\n\n183\n00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.860\nthey have them in Asia,\nthey have them all over the world.\n\n184\n00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.120\nLatin America,\nyou got one sitting in Brazil.\n\n185\n00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.080\nIn the US,\nthere's actually one in Miami, right.\n\n186\n00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.080\nNot too far from me.\n\n187\n00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.960\n&gt;&gt; Are you looking at extra costs\nwhenever you utilize these services?\n\n188\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, this will be a part of\nyour Azure Fabric subscription.\n\n189\n00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.090\n&gt;&gt; It is? Okay. &gt;&gt; So\nyou're not looking at extra costs, but\n\n190\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.230\nyou are looking at the outlay, initially,\nto set up and connect to Azure.\n\n191\n00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.870\nSo, whatever those monthly fees are,\n\n192\n00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.940\ndepending on how you set up and\nlicense Azure.\n\n193\n00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.320\nAnd there is a sliding scale there, right?\n\n194\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.240\nIt would just depend on\nhow you are buying in and\n\n195\n00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.980\nwhat you're opting in with at what level.\n\n196\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.530\nAnd how you are subscribing,\nhow many services you're using.\n\n197\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.540\nLet's hit me with Amazon, right?\n\n198\n00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.080\nIt's kind of an a la\ncarte thought process.\n\n199\n00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.350\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; The more you consume,\n\n200\n00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.440\nthe more you pay for.\n\n201\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.610\nSo there definitely would be costs\nassociated with this, but not directly.\n\n202\n00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.880\nIt's the broader thought process\nof opting into Azure, and\n\n203\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.050\nthen using this as part of\nthe subscription model.\n\n204\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.180\nSo, you would go through.\n\n205\n00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.120\nYou could look all this up, and find\nout all about this through the website.\n\n206\n00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.240\nAnd it would then give you a little\nbit more insight into what we do\n\n207\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.770\nfor that piece.\n\n208\n00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.525\nSo we want to come in from the outside.\n\n209\n00:09:56.525 --> 00:09:59.005\nWe're just gonna set this up from\nthe assumption we're monitoring from\n\n210\n00:09:59.005 --> 00:09:59.825\nthe inside.\n\n211\n00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:01.814\nCuz we're not subscribing to Azure and\n\n212\n00:10:01.814 --> 00:10:05.437\nsetting up the Fabric subscription\nto be able to do the demonstration.\n\n213\n00:10:05.437 --> 00:10:08.793\nWe are just simply gonna show you the\nthought process behind how you would do\n\n214\n00:10:08.793 --> 00:10:10.077\nthat, if you were going to.\n\n215\n00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:13.417\nSo I'm gonna search here for\nmy internal solution.\n\n216\n00:10:13.417 --> 00:10:17.857\nI do have my monitoring capability,\nor my watcher node, so\n\n217\n00:10:17.857 --> 00:10:20.497\nto speak,\nwith my internal management group server.\n\n218\n00:10:20.497 --> 00:10:22.978\nSo, my s01 server right here.\n\n219\n00:10:22.978 --> 00:10:23.943\nAnd I click Add.\n\n220\n00:10:23.943 --> 00:10:25.196\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a creepy name.\n&gt;&gt; The watcher note?\n\n221\n00:10:25.196 --> 00:10:28.108\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That could be a movie title.\n\n222\n00:10:28.108 --> 00:10:28.698\n&gt;&gt; It could be.\n\n223\n00:10:28.698 --> 00:10:32.268\nThe Watchman, that was,\nthat's a Marvel, I think.\n\n224\n00:10:32.268 --> 00:10:33.878\nSo you could have those.\n\n225\n00:10:33.878 --> 00:10:34.758\nSo kinda be like that.\n\n226\n00:10:34.758 --> 00:10:37.478\nAll right, so\nwe have our agent pool set up here.\n\n227\n00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:38.638\nWe'll click Next.\n\n228\n00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:44.860\nAnd then, we have our view and\nour validate test, and we can go in.\n\n229\n00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.750\nAnd we can,\nyou'll see we have our two URLs there.\n\n230\n00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.190\nAnd, excuse me,\nwhat we're gonna do is, we can go in.\n\n231\n00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:57.920\nAnd we can specify that we would be\nable to, by URL, we have each one.\n\n232\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.790\nWe can run a test and see whether\nwe can connect out and monitor.\n\n233\n00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:06.150\nAnd if we can, actually, then we would get\nthe results back on how long did it take\n\n234\n00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.820\nus to connect, and\nwhat was the performance on it?\n\n235\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.390\nWe begin to see the sample data that\nwe'll ultimately get as we monitor.\n\n236\n00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.670\nNow, we're doing this\nfrom an internal monitor.\n\n237\n00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.430\nWe're not going out to the web,\nto actually connect and\n\n238\n00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.780\nhit these sites for real.\n\n239\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.620\nSo we're not going to run the test here.\n\n240\n00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.150\nOnly cuz if we do that, and\n\n241\n00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.770\nyou can't even see the Run Test button cuz\nI'm talking to you in the box discovery.\n\n242\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.380\nLet me move it over so you could see it.\n\n243\n00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.140\nIf we were to click the Run Test now,\nwe would get a failure,\n\n244\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.500\nbecause we're not actually connecting out.\n\n245\n00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.150\nBut I'm just showing you that\nthat's what we would do.\n\n246\n00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.900\nWe could, you'll see here,\nchange our configuration.\n\n247\n00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.000\nLet me just click here.\n\n248\n00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.580\nLet's just talk about what we\ndo have underneath the hood for\n\n249\n00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.620\ntesting for a minute, though.\n\n250\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.870\nCuz this part will be of interest to you.\n\n251\n00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.640\nSo we have test frequency and performance\ndata collection that Cherokee was asking,\n\n252\n00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.090\nhey, where will we monitor from?\n\n253\n00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.150\nHow do we set it up?\n\n254\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.300\nBut she easily could have also asked,\nhey, what are we gonna monitor?\n\n255\n00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.330\nWhat are we gonna get back?\n\n256\n00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.550\nAnd what kind of data\nmight we be interested in?\n\n257\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.240\nThat would also be part of\nwhat we would see here.\n\n258\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.680\nAnd you can see we have\nour test frequency,\n\n259\n00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.200\nwe have the ability to specify our\ntime out values, things like that.\n\n260\n00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.110\nWe will then look at our alerts.\n\n261\n00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.420\nSo for this one, by default,\nwe have a request status code, a generate.\n\n262\n00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.100\nOr rather, greater than or\nequal to anything that's 400 or above.\n\n263\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.795\nMeaning, error codes that come\nback in the HTTP language stack,\n\n264\n00:12:18.795 --> 00:12:20.280\nwe've got different numbers, right?\n\n265\n00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.540\nA 404 error, page not found.\n\n266\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.160\nEverybody's usually familiar with that.\n\n267\n00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.670\n200, 300, 400.\nSo all these different codes.\n\n268\n00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.590\nWe coud search for,\nin the monitoring stream,\n\n269\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.660\nand then pull back data\nspecific to error codes.\n\n270\n00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.320\nOr status codes, proper way of referring\nto them, cuz not all of them imply errors.\n\n271\n00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.710\nIn fact, most of them do not.\n\n272\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.210\nBut a subset of the status codes\nhappen to deal with errors.\n\n273\n00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.485\nSo, bad to me for\ntalking about it that way.\n\n274\n00:12:44.485 --> 00:12:46.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I should actually be referring to it as\n\n275\n00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.110\na status code.\n\n276\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.780\nSo the status codes can be queried\nas part of our monitoring.\n\n277\n00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.280\nAnd we can go in here.\n\n278\n00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.630\nAnd through just simple string and Boolean\nthought process, say greater than or\n\n279\n00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.110\nequal to, equal to, not equal to, etc.\n\n280\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.550\nSpecify a number here.\n\n281\n00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.701\nIf we do have our own generic\nstatus codes, not generic, rather.\n\n282\n00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:08.100\nOur own custom codes that we have\nincluded in our web service.\n\n283\n00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.730\nA lot of developers will do that.\n\n284\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.340\nWe just have to know what they are,\nin terms of the number sequence, and\n\n285\n00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.720\nthen specify the monitor to be at\nthat level or above to return them,\n\n286\n00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.650\nif we want to be able to see\nevidence of them in the data stream.\n\n287\n00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.790\nSo we could do that as well.\n\n288\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.500\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, Adam, would we wanna,\n\n289\n00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.460\nit just seems like I wouldn't want\nto know about every single instance.\n\n290\n00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.910\nMaybe not at that particular,\nnotification.\n\n291\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.270\nAnd I wouldn't want to have an extreme,\nhave to shift through and\n\n292\n00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.190\nfind the important ones.\n\n293\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.550\nIs there a way to triage these alerts?\n\n294\n00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, you would want to get\nmultiple instances if they refer to\n\n295\n00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.820\ndifferent activities.\n\n296\n00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So they may very well be\n\n297\n00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:45.580\nlegitimate reasons why we would wanna\nsee multiple occurrences of a code.\n\n298\n00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.270\nUser hits the page five times and\nfive minute and\n\n299\n00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.650\nit's not coming up, we'd wanna get\nthat repetition and know that.\n\n300\n00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:52.511\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we wanna know there's\n\n301\n00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:56.030\na service outage, versus,\nonly hit it once, and it didn't come up.\n\n302\n00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.810\nAnd we don't know if it ever actually\ndid or not, in other words, right?\n\n303\n00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.700\nSo we would potentially wanna\nknow that things are happening.\n\n304\n00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.740\nWe can filter, but there usually is\n\n305\n00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.600\na mindset that we wanna see iterations\nas we're monitoring, to tell us whether\n\n306\n00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.790\nmultiple users from different places\nin these streams, in other words.\n\n307\n00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:18.420\nIf we're doing inside, or rather,\noutside monitoring on GSM.\n\n308\n00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.401\nAnd we're monitoring from different\nwatcher nodes in Ireland and\n\n309\n00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:21.082\nBrazil and wherever.\n\n310\n00:14:21.082 --> 00:14:23.032\n&gt;&gt; So you can isolate for an issue, maybe?\n\n311\n00:14:23.032 --> 00:14:27.490\n&gt;&gt; Certain pathways may be functional, but\nothers may not be, right to your point.\n\n312\n00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.880\nAnd so we would wanna see iterations of\nthat, to help us fine-tune the data and\n\n313\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.770\nmake it more valuable.\n\n314\n00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.270\nSo we would probably actually\nwant to be doing that,\n\n315\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.576\nas opposed to filtering out for it.\n\n316\n00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:37.960\nWe can see here,Content Match.\n\n317\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.010\nSo we could actually do Content Match.\n\n318\n00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:44.270\nDoes not contain, or does contain,\nequal tom less than, wild cardm etc.\n\n319\n00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.790\nAnd we can actually say, if it\ncontains this in the stream, tell us.\n\n320\n00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.980\nSo we could be looking for a word,\nwe could be looking for the URL.\n\n321\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.165\nI mean, there's just all sorts of stuff,\npotentially,\n\n322\n00:14:55.165 --> 00:14:58.098\nthat we could do here in the request for\nthe base page.\n\n323\n00:14:58.098 --> 00:14:59.526\nCheck for redirects, right?\n\n324\n00:14:59.526 --> 00:15:03.467\nSo if we're being bounced to a URL, and\nthen bounced again to another URL for\n\n325\n00:15:03.467 --> 00:15:05.780\na redirect, we wanna check for that.\n\n326\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.180\nWe could select all, or specify\nthe criteria that you wanna use for\n\n327\n00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.460\nmanaging health state.\n\n328\n00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.360\nThis top one here is all\nthat error state for alerts.\n\n329\n00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.032\nDown here, same idea for\nwarning state for health.\n\n330\n00:15:18.032 --> 00:15:21.400\nIs the health of the system degrading,\nor is it running the right way?\n\n331\n00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.300\nSo we could be looking at all this.\n\n332\n00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.330\nIn addition, as we scroll down here,\n\n333\n00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:29.580\nwe could specify the number of consecutive\ntimes the criteria would be generated.\n\n334\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.665\nSo as you were saying,\nwe could filter it as you are asked.\n\n335\n00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:35.700\nYou just have a little\nbox there with a number.\n\n336\n00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.630\nYou specify how many consecutive\ntimes you want to see that.\n\n337\n00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.400\nWe may, as I suggested,\nwant to see multiple iterations.\n\n338\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.960\nBut to Cherokee's point, we could\neasily filter that if we wanted to.\n\n339\n00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.846\nAnd then we could go ahead and we can\ndo performance collection down here.\n\n340\n00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:51.308\nAnd you'll see that we could look at\nresponse times, as I was suggesting.\n\n341\n00:15:51.308 --> 00:15:53.747\nWhat's the inbound and\noutbound performance on that.\n\n342\n00:15:53.747 --> 00:15:58.211\nAnd we look at values So\nseed it with that DNS resolution,\n\n343\n00:15:58.211 --> 00:16:03.120\ntest time, round trip time,\nTCP, things of that nature.\n\n344\n00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.620\nWe also look at allowing redirects,\nand specifying HTTP version.\n\n345\n00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:12.815\nSo are we doing version 5,\nversion 1.1 or I'm thinking HTML.\n\n346\n00:16:12.815 --> 00:16:18.495\nI'm thinking HTML not HTTP, 1.0 or\n1.1 is what I meant to say on HTTP.\n\n347\n00:16:18.495 --> 00:16:23.315\nWe can look at the HTTP method GET, HEAD,\nPOST and program in information for\n\n348\n00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.335\neach of those.\n\n349\n00:16:24.335 --> 00:16:29.005\nAnd then we also have information that we\ncould specify down here about the HTTP\n\n350\n00:16:29.005 --> 00:16:32.005\nheaders and how we're gonna deal with\nthem and what headers we want to see.\n\n351\n00:16:32.005 --> 00:16:33.850\nSo this is very detailed.\n\n352\n00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.590\nVery, very detailed\ndiagnostics in here right?\n\n353\n00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.490\nSo it's interesting that we have\nthe ability to really detail out and\n\n354\n00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:45.200\nspec out almost every aspect of\nthe interaction across the web server\n\n355\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.850\ndivide here from the monitor to watch\nyour node to the web server and back and\n\n356\n00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:51.630\nthen draw down all that data.\n\n357\n00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.840\nSo this is actually a really, really and\n\n358\n00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.238\nI'm going to use a very\nhighly technical term here.\n\n359\n00:16:56.238 --> 00:16:56.748\nRight?\n\n360\n00:16:56.748 --> 00:16:57.258\nNifty.\n\n361\n00:16:57.258 --> 00:17:00.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is a very nifty\n\n362\n00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.610\nfeature that we have.\n\n363\n00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:05.700\nSo it is really kind of cool that\nwe have the ability to do GSM,\n\n364\n00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.580\nGlobal Service Monitoring, now.\n\n365\n00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.350\nBecause this is one of the big\ncompetitive landscape points for\n\n366\n00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:14.580\nMicrosoft and the system center stack,\nand the ops manager stack.\n\n367\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.390\nThere's a lot of other products,\nyou've heard me talk about them in some\n\n368\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.410\nother episodes,\nin other areas in the show.\n\n369\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:25.020\nThings like HP OpenView, IBM Tivoli,\nSolarWinds, the Orion product,\n\n370\n00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.630\nall sorts of different products out\nthere that essentially do this, and\n\n371\n00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.090\nspecialize in doing this.\n\n372\n00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.350\nAnd we do it too, and we do it very well.\n\n373\n00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.600\nSo being able to delve into this feature\na little bit and see it is helpful,\n\n374\n00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.330\nespecially if you haven't really\nhad to set this up yourself or\n\n375\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.290\ndon't understand the capabilities of this.\n\n376\n00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:45.160\nThis is really under the hood a very\nvaluable set of tests that we can run and\n\n377\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.570\nvery valuable information we\ncan get back as a result.\n\n378\n00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.120\nSo we're gonna finish out here.\n\n379\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.110\nWe're gonna leave this here.\n\n380\n00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.900\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n381\n00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.830\nWe're then just gonna\nget our summary screen.\n\n382\n00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.780\nAs I've told you in other episodes,\nI'll remind you of this here,\n\n383\n00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.030\nIt's always a good idea to capture\nthe information on the summary screen for\n\n384\n00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.660\ndocumentation purposes, a screen capture,\n\n385\n00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.010\na picture, do a little selfie,\ndo one of these camera, right there.\n\n386\n00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:09.490\nI can actually do it face on because I'm\nstanding there, so we'll just pretend.\n\n387\n00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.560\nTend to take a picture,\nlet me get it in frame, click, right?\n\n388\n00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.790\nSo you have that and\n\n389\n00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:18.340\nthen with that you can put that into your\ndocumentation so you've got an exact\n\n390\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.010\nreproduction of what the settings\nwere when you configure this thing,\n\n391\n00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.990\nvery important for you to think about\nthat and make sure you're doing that.\n\n392\n00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.950\nWe're gonna click create.\n\n393\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.100\nGive that just a minute to come up.\n\n394\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.650\nAnd then when this done,\nwe'll have our monitor.\n\n395\n00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.790\nIt will show up, and we'll, again, we may\nhave to refresh to get it to be there.\n\n396\n00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.120\nBut trust me, it will be there.\n\n397\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.500\nBut we can go in, and\nwe'll have this available.\n\n398\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.770\nAnd we'll just go ahead and we'll refresh\nhere real quick, to get this in there.\n\n399\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.260\nJust give it a second.\n\n400\n00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.410\nAnd then once we do that, there we go.\n\n401\n00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.420\nThere's our web monitor right there.\n\n402\n00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.710\nThen we will have it available, and\nthen we'll be able to go ahead and\n\n403\n00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.950\ndeploy this and actually use this, right?\n\n404\n00:18:54.950 --> 00:19:01.125\nSo, this will then allow us to be able to\ngo in and ultimately check our web status.\n\n405\n00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:02.675\nRight?\nWe'll be able to go in,\n\n406\n00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:06.745\nand we'll be able to go to monitoring\nup under the web application so we'll\n\n407\n00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:11.015\ntransition over here, see the output of\nthis, essentially see where it goes live.\n\n408\n00:19:11.015 --> 00:19:13.725\nWe go in here,\nwe'll go into application monitoring.\n\n409\n00:19:13.725 --> 00:19:18.530\nWe went in here when we were doing\nthe .NET setup in the .NET framework\n\n410\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.670\ntransaction template and\ndoing APM, we went in and\n\n411\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.590\nshowed you what the output\nwould look like here.\n\n412\n00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.670\nIt's gonna be the same idea, we're\ngonna go up under web applications, so\n\n413\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.935\nlet's just scroll down here real quick,\nand\n\n414\n00:19:28.935 --> 00:19:31.575\nwe've got our web application\navailability monitoring.\n\n415\n00:19:31.575 --> 00:19:33.265\nWe did our .NET monitoring last time,\n\n416\n00:19:33.265 --> 00:19:37.115\nand you'll see we can go in\nunder web application status.\n\n417\n00:19:37.115 --> 00:19:40.143\nAnd eventually, we'll get our status\nto update, and then remember,\n\n418\n00:19:40.143 --> 00:19:41.875\nit takes a little bit of time.\n\n419\n00:19:41.875 --> 00:19:46.405\nI preloaded the application when we did\nthe .NET application monitoring demo.\n\n420\n00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:47.545\nSo we actually had it run for\n\n421\n00:19:47.545 --> 00:19:50.980\nabout 20 minutes behind the scenes,\nbefore we actually brought it out and\n\n422\n00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.580\nshowed it to you so you actually\nwould be able to see some status.\n\n423\n00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.750\nBut eventually we will get a status here,\n\n424\n00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.620\nwe'll be able to see the state\ntest status as well.\n\n425\n00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.890\nIf there are any active alerts,\nwe won't have any right now but\n\n426\n00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.660\neventually, if we do have anything\nwe'll be able to see them.\n\n427\n00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.210\nBut over time we will be able to get this\nup and running, and it will show up,\n\n428\n00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.160\nand we will see our monitor or\nour application running there.\n\n429\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.990\nOur web application status will show up.\n\n430\n00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.260\nHopefully it will show up as healthy\nonce it spins up and starts running.\n\n431\n00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.840\nAnd then once we have that up and\nrunning, we're able to go in and look at\n\n432\n00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.870\nthe diagram view on it if we choose to,\nso we actually can go in and we can,\n\n433\n00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.800\nlet me just see if we can refresh one more\ntime, see if we can get that in there.\n\n434\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.040\nSee the Web App Monitor's\nstarting to build but\n\n435\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.220\nit's gonna take time to come online and\nactually be available to us.\n\n436\n00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.200\nBut in the meantime, what we could do\nbecause we at least have it up and\n\n437\n00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.610\nrunning now in the sense\nthat it's out there,\n\n438\n00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.040\nwe can either go over here to\nthe right to our diagram view.\n\n439\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.500\nI want to show the diagram view\nin the .NET APM monitor remember?\n\n440\n00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.170\nYou were pretty excited about that.\n\n441\n00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That was the interactive diagram.\n\n442\n00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.160\nWe'll show that again here.\n\n443\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.020\nSame idea.\n\n444\n00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.810\nThis is one of the benefits\nwe get from linking this\n\n445\n00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:01.290\nto our default management pack, we have\nall these objects already built out and\n\n446\n00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:05.440\nwe're then able to use them as we set\nup the monitor and start to deploy it.\n\n447\n00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.480\nSo all the objects from the management\npack like these views are then\n\n448\n00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.860\navailable to us to actually deploy.\n\n449\n00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.270\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Which is one of the values, right?\n\n450\n00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:12.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n451\n00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.990\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna right-click\nhere just to show this to you.\n\n452\n00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.480\nWe did do the Health Explorer\nin our last demo.\n\n453\n00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.580\nI'm not gonna walk through that\nwhole thing again, but the idea was\n\n454\n00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.040\nthat we'll then, and we're not gonna have\nany data in the Health Explorer right now.\n\n455\n00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.670\nWe're still spinning up the monitor.\n\n456\n00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.385\nBut eventually we will get the ability to\nwalk through all the state changes and\n\n457\n00:21:28.385 --> 00:21:31.205\nlook at information about\nhow healthy we are over\n\n458\n00:21:31.205 --> 00:21:32.505\na period of time with Health Explorer.\n\n459\n00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:35.295\nSo that's gonna be very important for\nus to think about.\n\n460\n00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:38.595\nWe do have the ability to run our reports,\nand by the way, these report tasks,\n\n461\n00:21:38.595 --> 00:21:41.877\ncan we go full screen for a minute so\nwe can see what's behind my bot?\n\n462\n00:21:41.877 --> 00:21:46.247\nThese report tabs right here are the same\nones that are sitting over here right.\n\n463\n00:21:46.247 --> 00:21:47.787\n&gt;&gt; What's a different way to access them?\n\n464\n00:21:47.787 --> 00:21:50.567\n&gt;&gt; Same way to get to them just a matter\nof where you want to see them from.\n\n465\n00:21:50.567 --> 00:21:53.241\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; But all of this stuff here is the same\n\n466\n00:21:53.241 --> 00:21:56.257\nas over here and\nif we go to navigation and\n\n467\n00:21:56.257 --> 00:22:00.278\nsee the views,\nall those views right there, right?\n\n468\n00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:01.323\nSo we're going to bring up,\n\n469\n00:22:01.323 --> 00:22:03.590\nlet me just refresh one more\ntime to see if we have it.\n\n470\n00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.250\nAnother status update\nbefore we do anything else.\n\n471\n00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.030\nIt's starting to go,\nit went from gray to green.\n\n472\n00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.570\nNow you may not be able to see that, but\n\n473\n00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:13.360\nthe circle's now green which means it's\ninitializing, so we're getting data.\n\n474\n00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.030\nEventually we'll get a green\ncheck there that says healthy.\n\n475\n00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.000\nBut we can go in and\nwe can do our diagram view.\n\n476\n00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.490\nAnd when we do this,\nwe will then see our web app monitor, and\n\n477\n00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.740\nwe've got our interactive diagram.\n\n478\n00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.960\nThere's no status there yet, because\nagain, the monitor's still spinning up,\n\n479\n00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.850\nbut over time,\nwe will be able to go in and see.\n\n480\n00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.510\nNow we saw the green status go on\nthe circle there, the top circle went to\n\n481\n00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:41.270\ngreen, as I said a moment ago,\nshows us that the monitor's initializing.\n\n482\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.480\nIt's not healthy or unhealthy yet,\nit's just turning on.\n\n483\n00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.610\nBut this stuff once you deploy it,\ntakes about 20 to 30 minutes,\n\n484\n00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:50.740\nmaybe even longer depending on what kind\nof monitoring you're doing to come online.\n\n485\n00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.930\nSo you do have to be patient.\n\n486\n00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.438\nIt's not gonna happen right away and\n\n487\n00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:55.990\nit will not happen during\nthe course of our demo fully.\n\n488\n00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.390\nWe're just showing you the outline\nof how to set this up.\n\n489\n00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:03.520\nBut over time, this will come online and\nover time we then will be able to monitor.\n\n490\n00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.700\nAnd if you look we have MSM there,\nwe have ITPro.TV.\n\n491\n00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.970\nEvery one of our URLs is\nset up as its own instance.\n\n492\n00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.510\nWe have our web app monitor information.\n\n493\n00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:15.660\nAnd all of this essentially will\nnow be monitored and come online.\n\n494\n00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.050\nWe'll be able to see the status of it and\ninteract with it along the way.\n\n495\n00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.140\nOkay?\n\n496\n00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.230\n&gt;&gt; Well folks there you have it,\nweb application availability\n\n497\n00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.050\nmonitoring brought to you by\nthe distinguished Adam Gordon.\n\n498\n00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.250\nSo thank you so much Adam for\nbeing here today and thank you ladies and\n\n499\n00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.130\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n500\n00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:32.960\nBut stay tuned we have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n501\n00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.610\nFor this show I'll go ahead and sign out\nas your host, remember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n502\n00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:37.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm the

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.532 --> 00:00:08.196\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:11.893\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:13.590\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n6\n00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.970\nto your Datacenter Monitoring\nwith Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.790\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.460\nIn this episode,\nwe'll be viewing distributed applications.\n\n9\n00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.200\nAnd with us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.980\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.792\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n12\n00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:28.400\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n13\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.702\n&gt;&gt; Hello, so we're gonna continue our\nconversations around showing you different\n\n14\n00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:35.758\naspects of the System Center Ops Manager\ncapabilities for\n\n15\n00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:37.930\nmonitoring application health.\n\n16\n00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.220\nWe've taken a look at APM.\n\n17\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.873\nWe've talked about inside out and\n\n18\n00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:44.243\noutside in transaction monitoring\nwith global service monitoring.\n\n19\n00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:47.968\nWe've taken a look at and talked about\nhow to deal with event notifications,\n\n20\n00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:49.127\nalert notifications.\n\n21\n00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:52.610\nHow we do Run As Accounts,\nRun As Profiles and deal with that.\n\n22\n00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.650\nWe're gonna now put the capstone in place,\ntalk about distributed applications.\n\n23\n00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.325\nHow we can diagram out or\nessentially create a visual reference for\n\n24\n00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:03.680\nour application stack and\nthen monitor against that stack.\n\n25\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.390\nSo we're gonna start off in the console.\n\n26\n00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.991\nTake a look here if you don't mind\njoining me over here in the left wing of\n\n27\n00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:12.072\nthe ITProTV demo environment.\n\n28\n00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.546\nI've already gone ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:17.320\ncreated an app we can just look at\nfirst just to show you some things.\n\n30\n00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.810\nWe'll then go ahead and go back and\n\n31\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.840\nshow you how to create this using\ndistributed application wizard.\n\n32\n00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.493\nBut we call this distributed\napp ITProTV Test App 1.\n\n33\n00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:31.360\nYou can see we've opened up or\nexploded out our diagram.\n\n34\n00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.446\nThis is like that network diagram\nview that we've looked at in some of\n\n35\n00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:37.795\nthe other episodes where we've looked\nat the health status monitoring and\n\n36\n00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:39.941\nthe update in real time\naround those elements.\n\n37\n00:01:39.941 --> 00:01:42.016\nAnd this is gonna be the same idea.\n\n38\n00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:45.560\nAnd we'll see underneath here,\nI've added in two elements.\n\n39\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.680\nOne that's called All Computers.\n\n40\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.632\nAnd I have All Windows computers\nas objects listed here that I can\n\n41\n00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:52.519\nmonitor for.\n\n42\n00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:54.349\nI have an object called Server, and\n\n43\n00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:57.590\nI've added a specific instance\nof a Windows server here.\n\n44\n00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.500\nAnd when I hover,\nwhat you will notice is we get a pop out.\n\n45\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.420\nAnd I'll select this,\n\n46\n00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.230\nand that information will show up at\nthe bottom pane in just a minute.\n\n47\n00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.800\nBut I get a pop out hover indicates that,\nhey, I wanna know some information.\n\n48\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.420\nAnd when I do that, if I can get it to do\nthat again, I get this nice little pop out\n\n49\n00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.990\nbox that gives me all the information\nabout the object in question.\n\n50\n00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.130\nBut it's only there for\nabout ten seconds, hard to read.\n\n51\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.692\nSo if you highlight that,\n\n52\n00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:24.249\nall that information shows up\ndown here in the lower third.\n\n53\n00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.826\nNow we could see the name,\nthe Display Name, Principal Name, DNS,\n\n54\n00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:30.110\nthe NET.BIOS Name, the IP Address.\n\n55\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.160\nAll the information about\nthis object is here.\n\n56\n00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.000\nThe Network Name,\nwe have the Active Directory information,\n\n57\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.520\nif it's domain joined.\n\n58\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.090\nWe have the number of logical processors\nand physical processors available here.\n\n59\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.950\nWe have quite a bit of information.\n\n60\n00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.450\nIf it is a virtual machine,\nwe can tell that it's a virtual machine.\n\n61\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.030\nAll that stuff would be available to us,\nso all of that is here.\n\n62\n00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.270\nIn addition, on these diagrams,\nthey are fully interactive.\n\n63\n00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.124\nWe can go in,\nwe can open up any of the views.\n\n64\n00:03:01.124 --> 00:03:02.349\nCan we go full-screen just so\n\n65\n00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.540\nwe can this as it pops out cuz it's kind\nof hidden behind me a little bit there.\n\n66\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.760\nAnd I didn't bring my cloak of\ninvisibility today, with me.\n\n67\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.976\nSo it's hard for me to disappear out\nof that box while you're taking a look.\n\n68\n00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:13.070\n&gt;&gt; Maybe next time, Adam.\n\n69\n00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.880\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps next time,\nwhen I'm feeling more like a Harry Potter\n\n70\n00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.660\nkind of mood as opposed to my bright,\neffervescent, pink mood that I'm in today.\n\n71\n00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.440\nSo you'll see Alert View, Event View,\nPerformance View, Diagram View.\n\n72\n00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.270\nThese views can be opened or spawned\nspecific to the object in the diagram.\n\n73\n00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.790\nAny of these stages would allow\nme to be able to click and\n\n74\n00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.160\naccess the information for\nthat, so you'll see that.\n\n75\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.310\nWe have our Instance Properties, Heath\nExplorer, we've talked about that before,\n\n76\n00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.720\nthe importance of the Ops Manager Shell.\n\n77\n00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.870\nYou could see that, and\nwe can interact with that here.\n\n78\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.629\nAnd you'll see we could\nstart Maintenance Mode.\n\n79\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.730\nAnd we could actually put this machine\ninto maintenance mode and do work on it.\n\n80\n00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.230\nNow we could do the same thing right\nover here in the nav bar on the right.\n\n81\n00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.550\nWe have access to all of those options.\n\n82\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.060\nWe could use this information or\nthis set of Windows computer tasks,\n\n83\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.131\nright down here, for instance, to be\nable to go in, open Computer Manager.\n\n84\n00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:10.182\nPing the computer, perhaps do\na remote desktop out to it, right?\n\n85\n00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:14.030\nSo there's all this different stuff that\nwe could do if we use one of these tasks.\n\n86\n00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.181\nYou'll notice I'm able to open Computer\nManagement against the system immediately.\n\n87\n00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:21.690\nCuz all systems online are available\nof course, and I could do that.\n\n88\n00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.560\nSo you could see that I'm able to\nuse the tasks off to the right to\n\n89\n00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.580\ninteract with elements in\nthis diagram in real time.\n\n90\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.650\nWhich is incredibly important for\nus cuz we don't have to go into five or\n\n91\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.180\nsix different screens to do\nadministration based on health status.\n\n92\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.120\nWe could do it right from within\nthe distributed app diagram itself,\n\n93\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.560\nwhich makes a lot of sense\nwhen you think about it.\n\n94\n00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.670\nSo we could see that, and we could,\nobviously, execute any of these tasks,\n\n95\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.200\ndepending on what we're looking for.\n\n96\n00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.441\nNow as we scroll down,\nwe continue to see, and\n\n97\n00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:48.744\nI only opened up one area\nhere under the server.\n\n98\n00:04:48.744 --> 00:04:51.220\nI could do the same thing\nunder All Windows computers.\n\n99\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.890\nBut I'll see that we have some stuff\nthat's healthy, so I could open this up.\n\n100\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.700\nIt'll tell us what is healthy here.\n\n101\n00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.360\nAll these things on the server\nare healthy elements.\n\n102\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.530\nI can look at, Just bring that back up,\nthings that are not monitored.\n\n103\n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.540\nSo what is currently not being monitored.\n\n104\n00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.080\nI could see whatever is\nnot being monitored,\n\n105\n00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.488\nand I would see the status of those.\n\n106\n00:05:11.488 --> 00:05:14.050\nAnd if there's anything\nin a warning state,\n\n107\n00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.808\nI can see what's in a warning state.\n\n108\n00:05:15.808 --> 00:05:18.440\nAnd I could see that maybe our database\ninstance is in a warning state,\n\n109\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.240\nfor instance, hypothetically,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n110\n00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.720\nIt may be a service or\nsomething like that.\n\n111\n00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.610\nAnd I could get more information,\ndepending on what's happening.\n\n112\n00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.750\nI can refresh in any area.\n\n113\n00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.600\nIt has to redraw, rerender the diagram,\nbringing it back in and updating it.\n\n114\n00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.110\nSo I can do that, it takes just a moment.\n\n115\n00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.281\nAs you can see, it comes back up.\n\n116\n00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:39.981\nAnd then I could delve in and\ncontinue to see if there's any updates.\n\n117\n00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:44.783\nSo the distributed application diagram\nis very valuable for us because it\n\n118\n00:05:44.783 --> 00:05:49.670\nallows us to bring up an application\nthat has been put into the system here.\n\n119\n00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.670\nYou could see, when we close the diagrams,\n\n120\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.120\ngo back to the monitoring screen,\nyou could see that under Authoring,\n\n121\n00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.780\nas we use our distributed application\narea, and we create our applications.\n\n122\n00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.560\nThis is the one that I\npre-loaded before we came on\n\n123\n00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.020\nto do the demo just to\nshow you the output.\n\n124\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.860\nThat once it's there and created,\nwe then can simply go in,\n\n125\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.080\nit's very simple to do,\nright click, and just View Diagram.\n\n126\n00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.876\nThat's what I was doing just now,\nand that's what we were seeing.\n\n127\n00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:17.780\nWe could View State, as well,\nI can right-click and View State.\n\n128\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.730\nGive this just a second.\n\n129\n00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.490\nWe can go in and see our state monitor.\n\n130\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.322\nWe've looked at our state monitor\nbefore in some of the other demos.\n\n131\n00:06:24.322 --> 00:06:27.040\nWe've seen the value of\nunderstanding with the state is.\n\n132\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.460\nWe could see the state in\nany of these categories.\n\n133\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.170\nAre we up to date with software updates?\n\n134\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.030\nOr is our APM, or application\nperformance monitoring, taking place?\n\n135\n00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.262\nAll the different things that are here,\nand\n\n136\n00:06:38.262 --> 00:06:41.836\nyou'll see there are quite a number\nof them as we scroll over, right?\n\n137\n00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:45.723\nJust going by there, right, you look\nat all that stuff that potentially\n\n138\n00:06:45.723 --> 00:06:47.898\nwe can monitor for and tell the state of.\n\n139\n00:06:47.898 --> 00:06:52.402\nAnd I'm just gonna keep going until either\nwe run out of room, I run out of things to\n\n140\n00:06:52.402 --> 00:06:56.346\nsay, or you get so dizzy that you go\nlike this and fall out of your chair.\n\n141\n00:06:56.346 --> 00:07:00.094\nBut you could see all the different stuff\nthat potentially is being monitored\n\n142\n00:07:00.094 --> 00:07:00.890\nfor here.\n\n143\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.792\nAnd we're like not even\nhalfway through yet.\n\n144\n00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:04.670\nI mean,\nlook at the slider on the bottom, right?\n\n145\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.790\nWe're approaching halfway right now.\n\n146\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.025\nAnd I've already actually shaved and\nchanged my shirt twice.\n\n147\n00:07:10.025 --> 00:07:11.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we're still going.\n\n148\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.120\nAnd so you can see that this is\npulling down all of this information,\n\n149\n00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.980\nevery aspect of all the information\nassociated with the management packs and\n\n150\n00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.410\neverything we can be looking for.\n\n151\n00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.300\nNow clearly, we're not monitoring for\nmost of this.\n\n152\n00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.290\nMost of it is just,\nyou're essentially there.\n\n153\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.220\nHey, I'm available, but\nI'm not really monitoring for it yet.\n\n154\n00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.070\nBut the point is you could\nsee that I have hundreds,\n\n155\n00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.020\nright, of items that could\nbe looked at for state.\n\n156\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.230\nRight now, we're just looking at\nthe fact that we're in a warning state,\n\n157\n00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.080\ngenerically.\n\n158\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.830\nWe don't really know why, but\nwe know that we can go in.\n\n159\n00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.479\nAnd we can open up any of our views\nhere to get a better sense of that.\n\n160\n00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:51.336\nWe also know that we can open\nup our Health Explorer and\n\n161\n00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:55.480\nbegin to look at state transition or\nchanges and see what's happening when.\n\n162\n00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.140\nAnd then work backwards to\nfigure out what may be going on.\n\n163\n00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.120\nWe may wanna do a quick look and\nsee if there's any alerts.\n\n164\n00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.920\nSo maybe we'll just do a quick alert view.\n\n165\n00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.372\nWe could see there are some alerts here\nthat may be leading to some of the concern\n\n166\n00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:08.770\nthat we're seeing and\nwe can see what they are.\n\n167\n00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.680\nPowerShell scripts fail to run,\nmay or may not be important.\n\n168\n00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.506\nWe can take a look and\nsee that apm.net server side configuration\n\n169\n00:08:17.506 --> 00:08:21.580\nerror conflicts is something\nwith setting up APM.\n\n170\n00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.820\nMay have been a problem.\n\n171\n00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.090\nLooks like IS needs to be restarted,\n\n172\n00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.320\nthat'll be from one of our prior demos\nwhere I didn't bother to restart IS.\n\n173\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.720\nWe just continued to do some stuff and\nconfigure it.\n\n174\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.428\nSo we can see there's evidence of\nthings going on in the system, but\n\n175\n00:08:33.428 --> 00:08:35.580\nthat's okay,\nwe can at least now tell what they are.\n\n176\n00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.524\nAnd if we needed to delve into one of\nthem in more detail, we can go in,\n\n177\n00:08:39.524 --> 00:08:40.990\nwe can go click on it.\n\n178\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.068\nWe could see down here that we get\nthe information about the alert.\n\n179\n00:08:44.068 --> 00:08:46.533\nWe can see the alert\ndescription down here.\n\n180\n00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:51.575\nWhere machine it came from if there is\na action that is required it shows us what\n\n181\n00:08:51.575 --> 00:08:56.535\nit is over here as we scroll down we could\nsee that there may be additional details\n\n182\n00:08:56.535 --> 00:09:00.305\nin the alert summary or in the error\nsummary that we wanna take a look at.\n\n183\n00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:04.204\nSo there very detailed information with\nregards to performance monitoring that\n\n184\n00:09:04.204 --> 00:09:08.041\nthe system will give us in the console but\nwe gotta know where to go in order to find\n\n185\n00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:11.560\nbut we gotta be able to follow\nthe bread crumbs trial essentially.\n\n186\n00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.330\nThat we have from console to console\nwindow, to be able to see what we're\n\n187\n00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.410\nhaving to figure out as administrators and\nwhat may be impactful to us.\n\n188\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.860\nSo we better understand it.\n\n189\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.433\nVery powerful tool, lots and\nlots of things going on and\n\n190\n00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:28.247\nlots of information that oops,\nthat we can interact with.\n\n191\n00:09:28.247 --> 00:09:29.220\nI did click.\n\n192\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.270\nLots of things going on that\nwe can interact within there.\n\n193\n00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.970\nSo what I wanna do is show you how to\ncreate this distributed application view.\n\n194\n00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:35.990\nSo we're gonna do that right now.\n\n195\n00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.630\nWe're gonna right-click on\nthe distributed application item.\n\n196\n00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.129\nNotice we are in the authoring workspace.\n\n197\n00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:42.880\nWe are up under authoring.\n\n198\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.140\nWe've been through\nthe Management Pack templates.\n\n199\n00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.330\nDone a couple different things there.\n\n200\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.980\nWe're gonna take a ,different tact here\ndo distributed applications right-click.\n\n201\n00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.380\nCreate a new distributed app.\n\n202\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.504\nGet a little wizard that shows up.\n\n203\n00:09:53.504 --> 00:09:54.790\nPretty straight forward.\n\n204\n00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.090\nWe're gonna name this one for\nmy lovely co-host over there, Cherokee,\n\n205\n00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:04.390\nand we're gonna say that this will\nbe called Cherokee App, right?\n\n206\n00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.260\n&gt;&gt; Yay, there's an app for that.\n\n207\n00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.280\n&gt;&gt; There's an app for that.\n\n208\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.360\nThere's an app for Cherokee.\n\n209\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.120\nCherokee App One, okay?\n\n210\n00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.700\nAnd, we have some templates\nhere that we can choose.\n\n211\n00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.810\nWe have a .NET three tier application, so,\nif the Cherokee app was was a .NET app,\n\n212\n00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.590\nwe would choose that to be able\nto represent the different\n\n213\n00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:25.090\nfunctionality levels in a .NET app\nwith a two or three tier solution.\n\n214\n00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:29.015\nWe may do a blank advance,\nwhich is just a blank template.\n\n215\n00:10:29.015 --> 00:10:32.412\nThat's the one I'll do and we can pull\nout and essentially create components,\n\n216\n00:10:32.412 --> 00:10:34.300\nand then join them and\ncreate a connection.\n\n217\n00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.650\nI'll show you how to do that.\n\n218\n00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.400\nWe could do a messaging one.\n\n219\n00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.670\nWe could do a line of business web app.\n\n220\n00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:45.760\nSo every template has information\nspecific to NNA, specific of diagramming\n\n221\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.310\nthe application we're gonna look at and\nif you're not familiar with it,\n\n222\n00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.040\nhighlight the appropriate one,\nyou'll get a little description here.\n\n223\n00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.000\nYou can view the details of it.\n\n224\n00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.980\nI'll go in,\nit brings up purpose and feature.\n\n225\n00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.900\nYou can see a little bit more information\nabout what the template does.\n\n226\n00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.730\nWhat you're able to do.\n\n227\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.960\nHere it'll show you things like\nwebsites and database objects.\n\n228\n00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.360\nIf you do the line of business\nwebapp versus a messaging app where\n\n229\n00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.070\nwe'll go in and we'll be able to see all\nthe messaging components like Exchange,\n\n230\n00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.160\nmail stores, DNS infrastructure.\n\n231\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.630\nRight pretty standard\nmessaging platform stuff.\n\n232\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.870\nWe'd be able to diagram that out.\n\n233\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.500\nSo it's a question of what back end\napplication we're representing.\n\n234\n00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.132\nRemember we're not creating\nthe application here.\n\n235\n00:11:26.132 --> 00:11:29.723\nWe're creating a representation of\nan existing app not the real app\n\n236\n00:11:29.723 --> 00:11:30.930\nitself, right?\n\n237\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.460\nWe're not about to create a messaging\nsystem if we choose messaging template.\n\n238\n00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.958\nWe're gonna represent the messaging\napplication that already exists that we\n\n239\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:38.706\nwanna monitor.\n\n240\n00:11:38.706 --> 00:11:40.970\nAnd this is gonna give\nus the structure and\n\n241\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.450\nthe objects that will be populated\nIn order to be able to do that.\n\n242\n00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.480\nIf you've ever used Visio,\nfor instance, and\n\n243\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.630\ndone any work in Visio to create\na network diagram of some kind, or\n\n244\n00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.710\nyou've built workflows in either Visio or\nSharePoint designer or Visual Studio for\n\n245\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:59.410\nSharePoint or\nany of those kinds of thought processes.\n\n246\n00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.800\nIf you've used SQL Server Reporting\nServices or Report Builder Tool.\n\n247\n00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.160\nTo be able to build those objects.\n\n248\n00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.731\nYou're using some sort of a grid and\nyou're creating shapes or using\n\n249\n00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:14.547\npre-determined shapes to represent items,\nobjects, functionality, services, etc.\n\n250\n00:12:14.547 --> 00:12:16.630\nAnd that's what we're doing here,\nthat's all we're doing.\n\n251\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.440\nSo we're not actually creating the app,\nwe're creating a visual representation of\n\n252\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.430\nan existing app that we then wanna model,\njust to be clear, okay?\n\n253\n00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.420\nAnd we're gonna bind object to it so\n\n254\n00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.830\nthat obviously then they\nrepresent what we wanna monitor.\n\n255\n00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.720\nI'm gonna show you how to do that.\n\n256\n00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.549\nWe'll do our blank advanced.\n\n257\n00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:34.350\nWe'll select our management pack.\n\n258\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.700\nWe've talked about the importance\nof selecting a management pack,\n\n259\n00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.570\nhaving the objects available that\ncome in as a result of that.\n\n260\n00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:45.410\nWe're gonna click OK and\nthen we get our designer, right?\n\n261\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.850\nThis is the page where we're gonna\ngo out and actually lay this out?\n\n262\n00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:48.580\nCan we go full screen?\n\n263\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.000\nWe're just gonna need to be able\nto see everything as we go.\n\n264\n00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000\nSo, Cherokee, you're gonna help\nme make some choices here,\n\n265\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.030\nwhile we are doing this.\n\n266\n00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.510\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Let's just go full screen,\n\n267\n00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.180\nfull screen, for real, so we see the grid\nit's a little bit easier to work with.\n\n268\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.790\nSo, we have, first of all,\nthe need to put some objects out here, and\n\n269\n00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.310\ncomponents out here on the screen.\n\n270\n00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.180\nSo, what we're gonna do, is click\nAdd Components, and when we do that,\n\n271\n00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.650\nwe're gonna get a little\nad component picker, and\n\n272\n00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.850\nwe have to specify what we want to call\nthe component, and then we have to specify\n\n273\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.540\nafter we call it something, a certain kind\nof object that we're gonna bind to it.\n\n274\n00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.630\n&gt;&gt; So\nlet's give our first component a name.\n\n275\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.780\nWhat do you wanna call the first\ncomponent for the Cherokee app?\n\n276\n00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.130\n&gt;&gt; How about.\n\n277\n00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:30.834\nFuchsia.\n\n278\n00:13:30.834 --> 00:13:31.464\n&gt;&gt; Fuchsia.\n\n279\n00:13:31.464 --> 00:13:33.323\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm seeing a lot\nof fuchsia right now.\n\n280\n00:13:33.323 --> 00:13:37.557\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how to spell fuchsia so\nI'm gonna give it my best shot and\n\n281\n00:13:37.557 --> 00:13:40.448\nI'm gonna say F-U-C-H-I-A, fuchsia.\n\n282\n00:13:40.448 --> 00:13:42.391\n&gt;&gt; I think so,\nmaybe there's an s in there.\n\n283\n00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:44.027\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps, but we're gonna go with that.\n\n284\n00:13:44.027 --> 00:13:45.079\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Fuchsia, or\n\n285\n00:13:45.079 --> 00:13:47.518\nFuchia depending on how you\nchoose to pronounce it.\n\n286\n00:13:47.518 --> 00:13:48.146\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n287\n00:13:48.146 --> 00:13:49.689\n&gt;&gt; There may be an s, but you called it.\n\n288\n00:13:49.689 --> 00:13:53.898\nI didn't specify I had to be able to\nspell it, so bad for me, good for you.\n\n289\n00:13:53.898 --> 00:13:57.863\n&gt;&gt; I think Google has an operating\nsystem named fuchsia right now.\n\n290\n00:13:57.863 --> 00:13:59.660\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully they know how to spell it.\n\n291\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.580\n&gt;&gt; They're on to something.\n\n292\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.180\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully they are.\n\n293\n00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.430\nHopefully they know how to spell it.\n\n294\n00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:06.100\nAll right, so we've got future\nthere as our first component.\n\n295\n00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.150\nLet's add one more component,\nso we have a couple we can then\n\n296\n00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.500\ncreate a connection between that\nwe'll be able to interact with.\n\n297\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.720\nSo we're gonna click add\ncomponent one more time.\n\n298\n00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.249\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay so\n\n299\n00:14:14.249 --> 00:14:16.560\nwe'll just do that it's\nthe same pick list.\n\n300\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.441\nThis time you're gonna pick\nsomething I know how to spell.\n\n301\n00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:21.320\n&gt;&gt; I know I was thinking, I was like I\ndon't wanna say something like Chartreuse.\n\n302\n00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.316\nHow about just,\nwe'll stick with colors and go with green.\n\n303\n00:14:24.316 --> 00:14:25.380\nHow about that?\n\n304\n00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay so we're gonna go green.\n\n305\n00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.534\nNow we didn't talk about this last time,\nbut if we want,\n\n306\n00:14:32.534 --> 00:14:35.002\nlet's move this over so you can see.\n\n307\n00:14:35.002 --> 00:14:39.996\nIf we wanted to scope or\nnarrowly define the particular object,\n\n308\n00:14:39.996 --> 00:14:45.810\ndown here, or group of objects that\nwe wanna be able to make this shape.\n\n309\n00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.037\nThis component represents.\n\n310\n00:14:47.037 --> 00:14:50.835\nWe can decide, hey you know what,\ninstead of all objects, and\n\n311\n00:14:50.835 --> 00:14:56.098\nyou can see over here, I have 313 objects\ncurrently in my pick list all objects.\n\n312\n00:14:56.098 --> 00:14:58.498\nIf I wanna narrow that,\nI could say, you know what,\n\n313\n00:14:58.498 --> 00:15:01.893\nI just want this particular one,\nthe one we're about to choose, green.\n\n314\n00:15:01.893 --> 00:15:06.573\nI just want it to be associated with\nthe administration item, or whatever\n\n315\n00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:11.705\nthe case may be, or connector or whatever,\nand it would then narrowly define and\n\n316\n00:15:11.705 --> 00:15:16.838\nconstrain the opportunity for me to add\nobjects to this component that are unique\n\n317\n00:15:16.838 --> 00:15:21.617\nto the object choice I make essentially\nbased on my inital choice, right.\n\n318\n00:15:21.617 --> 00:15:24.557\nSo as you're building out\nthis thought process, and\n\n319\n00:15:24.557 --> 00:15:26.760\nwe're adding the components in.\n\n320\n00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.930\nYou have to be thinking about what kind\nof components are gonna be used and\n\n321\n00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.350\nwhat objects are gonna represent.\n\n322\n00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:33.830\nComponents are just empty shells,\n\n323\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.580\nthey're essentially just boxes\nthat we inscribe functionality to.\n\n324\n00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.480\nThink of almost like text boxes.\n\n325\n00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.070\nBut they're able to as containers\nhold objects that we bind to them.\n\n326\n00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.480\nWe're gonna bring objects in and\nadd them in here in just a minute.\n\n327\n00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.150\nSo they are a special kind of container.\n\n328\n00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.582\nI wanna minimize their functionality.\n\n329\n00:15:49.582 --> 00:15:53.446\nThey are important, but they're really\nnothing more than essentially, an empty\n\n330\n00:15:53.446 --> 00:15:57.032\nbox that we label with a name that we\nhope we spell correctly, cuz Our co-host\n\n331\n00:15:57.032 --> 00:16:00.590\ndoesn't throw us under the bus with\na color that we don't know how to spell.\n\n332\n00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:01.870\nI'm not bitter, by the way.\n\n333\n00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:02.718\nI just sound that way.\n\n334\n00:16:02.718 --> 00:16:05.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then, when we do that,\n\n335\n00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:08.450\nwe're then gonna actually, in the step two\nhere as soon as we create the green one,\n\n336\n00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.810\nwe're gonna bind,\nwe're gonna go select an object and\n\n337\n00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.530\nbind it by adding it into, the object\nis gonna get added into the component.\n\n338\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.490\nAnd we're then, in sense,\ngonna have an association.\n\n339\n00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:22.510\nAnd then we're gonna create a connection\nbetween those two components and\n\n340\n00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.190\nthen link them so\nthis would create the distributed app.\n\n341\n00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.180\nWe get that nice diagram.\n\n342\n00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.930\nWe're gonna see everything lined up for\nus.\n\n343\n00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.190\nThat's what we're gonna do right now.\n\n344\n00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:29.970\nI'm gonna go ahead,\n\n345\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:35.300\nI'm gonna instantiate the green component\nhere with all objects selected.\n\n346\n00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.340\nSo let me do this, and\nyou'll see we have both there.\n\n347\n00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:43.600\nNow we can position these, and\nmove them around if you would prefer to\n\n348\n00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.930\nhave them set up and\njust kind of dropped in here.\n\n349\n00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.720\nThat way you can put them side by side,\n\n350\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.010\nif you wanna put it over here where it\nwas, kind of underneath each other.\n\n351\n00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.670\nUp to you to decide where to put them.\n\n352\n00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.920\nYou know, this is you designing the app.\n\n353\n00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.850\nVisually, remember just to show the\ncomponents and understand the monitoring\n\n354\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:12.040\nof these components when we link objects\n\n355\n00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.685\nto them to represent them, so\n\n356\n00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:23.730\nwe can see the data.\n\n357\n00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.750\nI'm not gonna ask her where she wants me\nto put them, we're gonna leave them there.\n\n358\n00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.550\n&gt;&gt; That's fine Adam.\n\n359\n00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:31.092\n&gt;&gt; Because they may wind up,\nyou know who knows, we're not quite sure.\n\n360\n00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:31.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; All right,\n\n361\n00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:36.880\nso now what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nactually add objects into our components.\n\n362\n00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.550\nSo next step is we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna come over here,\n\n363\n00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.110\nwe're gonna find an object that\nis appropriate for fuchsia.\n\n364\n00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.620\nI don't have a clue what\nthe heck that's going to be,\n\n365\n00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.650\nbut we'll figure something out and\nan object that's appropriate for green.\n\n366\n00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.390\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; Maybe that's\n\n367\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.710\nthe primary colors because those are,\nyou know, secondary.\n\n368\n00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's no logic that makes sense there.\n\n369\n00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.415\nI would just not say anything\nabout that if I was you.\n\n370\n00:17:56.415 --> 00:17:58.025\nBut what we would do in the real world,\n\n371\n00:17:58.025 --> 00:18:00.645\nyou saw me in the demo\napp I had already set up.\n\n372\n00:18:00.645 --> 00:18:03.685\nSomething just from a labeling\nperspective that actually made more sense\n\n373\n00:18:03.685 --> 00:18:06.055\nwould have been servers and\nall Windows computers.\n\n374\n00:18:06.055 --> 00:18:08.682\nAnd then we would clearly be able to\n\n375\n00:18:08.682 --> 00:18:11.582\nsign objects like a specific\ninstance of a server.\n\n376\n00:18:11.582 --> 00:18:13.752\nWe're going to pretend that\nwe did something like that.\n\n377\n00:18:13.752 --> 00:18:15.922\nAnd it's not a big deal,\nthe labels, as I said,\n\n378\n00:18:15.922 --> 00:18:20.332\nare pretty much just gonna be innocuous,\nbut if you wanted to remove the label and\n\n379\n00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:23.032\nchange it, just right click there and\nwe can rename it if we need to.\n\n380\n00:18:23.032 --> 00:18:24.892\nSo it's not like if we made a choice and\n\n381\n00:18:24.892 --> 00:18:26.792\nwe didn't like it we couldn't go back and\nfix it.\n\n382\n00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:28.562\nIt would be easy enough to figure it out.\n\n383\n00:18:28.562 --> 00:18:31.022\nIt's just that we already went with that,\nso we're just going to use that.\n\n384\n00:18:31.022 --> 00:18:34.820\nBut you get the idea, the real world this\nwould be something more meaningful like\n\n385\n00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.390\nweb server, like file and print server.\n\n386\n00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.330\nSomething you would name it so\nas we add the object in and\n\n387\n00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.470\nwe drop in the specific instance to\nthe file server it actual shows up and\n\n388\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.570\nmakes sense when we track it,\nthat's what we want to make sure we do.\n\n389\n00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.190\nSo let's scroll down here, and we got\nall sorts of objects here by the way,\n\n390\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.000\nthere's quite a number of\nthem we're going to look for.\n\n391\n00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.320\nGo back up right here.\n\n392\n00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.880\nWe're gonna look for an instance\nof the Windows operating system\n\n393\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.180\nthat has a server name attached to it.\n\n394\n00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.850\nYou could see it right there.\n\n395\n00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:08.930\nSo we can drag this out, right click\non it, rather I should say add to,\n\n396\n00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.640\nand specify either create\na new component group, or\n\n397\n00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.620\nadd it to one of the ones\nthat we have here.\n\n398\n00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.710\nWe'll add the server to fuchsia.\n\n399\n00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.780\nAnd you can see when we do that,\nserver 12 R2 operating system\n\n400\n00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.360\ngets added in right there, and we can then\nsee that we're gonna start monitoring.\n\n401\n00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.250\nCan we go full-screen cause we\ngotta see what's behind me here.\n\n402\n00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.519\nAnd you'll see that we now have, when we\ndo this, we have down here our object\n\n403\n00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:36.270\nname, we have our holding computer,\nthe computer that we're gonna be using.\n\n404\n00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.910\nAnd you'll see we have the different\nviews that are gonna be\n\n405\n00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.820\nassociated with this object.\n\n406\n00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.900\nWe have our state view,\nour alert view and our diagram view.\n\n407\n00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.430\nSo we're starting to build in\nsome components structure and\n\n408\n00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.000\nthen objects bound to\nthem as containers and\n\n409\n00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.460\nthen logic that as we continue we'll\nadd another object in to the other\n\n410\n00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.400\ncomponent in a minute,\ncreate a relationship, we'll then save it.\n\n411\n00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.540\nAnd then when we go to look at\nthe diagram, this is how we begin to see\n\n412\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.660\nthe monitoring, because we're binding\nthe specific instances of objects\n\n413\n00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.220\nthat we want to get health monitoring for\n\n414\n00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.130\nand then they're gonna be brought in and\nwe're going to be able to see them.\n\n415\n00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's go grab another one.\n\n416\n00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.640\nFor green let's do.\n\n417\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah probably would have made a little\nmore sense if I, instead of said green,\n\n418\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.560\nmaybe something like\ndomain controllers and\n\n419\n00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.054\nthen you could put those domain\ncontrollers in that grouping right.\n\n420\n00:20:24.054 --> 00:20:25.525\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey reflection and\n\n421\n00:20:25.525 --> 00:20:28.450\nself-awareness is a really\nimportant concept.\n\n422\n00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.100\nThat is awesome that you came to\nthat on your own, that is great, and\n\n423\n00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.030\nyes it would have, but\nyou had your choice.\n\n424\n00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.390\nAnd you chose poorly, so\n\n425\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:40.470\nyou're now going to have to live with\nthe outcome of your consequences.\n\n426\n00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:46.540\nAll right, so we are going to choose,\nI'm just trying to find something here,\n\n427\n00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:51.570\nI'm going to go up here real quick,\nlet's do the Ops Manager database.\n\n428\n00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.230\nGrab that one, add that one.\n\n429\n00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.940\nWe'll add that one in to green so we have\nthe ops manager data warehouse database.\n\n430\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.680\nOne of our two databases, our reporting\ndatabase where we're gonna get all of that\n\n431\n00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.315\ninformation that is held there, and then\nsend it over to the reporting server and\n\n432\n00:21:05.315 --> 00:21:07.630\nthe reporting server\ninstance through querying.\n\n433\n00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.480\nSo we're gonna use that structure,\nso we have that.\n\n434\n00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.230\nLet's create a relationship between these\ntwo, we're gonna go click on our create\n\n435\n00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:18.440\nrelationship item right up here and we're\nthen going to get our little connector.\n\n436\n00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.260\nGo full screen so\n\n437\n00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.500\nyou can see the little icon hanging at\nthe bottom right-hand corner of my mouse.\n\n438\n00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.581\nIt's that kind of sideways knocked\noff your face half-broken glasses\n\n439\n00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:28.760\nlooking thing.\n\n440\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.980\nA little square and circle icon.\n\n441\n00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.840\nAnd as I grab and drag here,\n\n442\n00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.600\nyou'll see I can create a connection,\nessentially a relationship.\n\n443\n00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.670\nYou could see the little dohickey,\nI don't know what to call it,\n\n444\n00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:43.200\nbut little squiggly thing underneath my\narrow that is essentially the connector or\n\n445\n00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.730\ncreate relationship tool.\n\n446\n00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.900\nAnd I now have my\nrelationship between the two.\n\n447\n00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.970\nSo I've gone ahead and said these\ntwo items are going to be related.\n\n448\n00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.310\nAnd I wanna make sure that\nwhen they are linked up and\n\n449\n00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.900\nset up, that I see this relationship.\n\n450\n00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.750\nNow that I've done this, I wanna go\nahead and go over here to the left, and\n\n451\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.120\nI'm gonna click save.\n\n452\n00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.810\nSo let's click save,\nwe'll give this just a minute.\n\n453\n00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.850\nIt takes a moment or so to save.\n\n454\n00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.990\nIt doesn't take very long but\nyou just have to be patient with it.\n\n455\n00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.440\nLet it finish up doing it's thing.\n\n456\n00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.540\nAnd then once it is saved we'll then\nbe able to see the application.\n\n457\n00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.060\nIt'll show up momentarily in the pick list\nbehind this window in the application,\n\n458\n00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.560\ndistributed application,\narea that we were working with.\n\n459\n00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.820\nWe'll see another instance there.\n\n460\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.610\nWe may have to refresh and\nsee if we'll wait to find out.\n\n461\n00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:31.700\nIt's always a mystery,\n\n462\n00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.035\nyou never quite know whether\nyou'll have to refresh or not.\n\n463\n00:22:34.035 --> 00:22:36.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we'll refresh if we need to.\n\n464\n00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.160\nAnd then once we're done,\nwe'll close this, and\n\n465\n00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.790\nthen we will be able to,\nwhoops, did not mean to do that.\n\n466\n00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.210\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n467\n00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.560\nWhen you go to close,\ndon't close the console [LAUGH].\n\n468\n00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.150\nThat's always a good piece of advice.\n\n469\n00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.570\nI hit the wrong X there.\n\n470\n00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.580\nSo let's just get back into where we were.\n\n471\n00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.600\nLet's go back to authoring.\n\n472\n00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.520\nAnd let's go here.\n\n473\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.050\nYou'll see now, that we do have\nour share a key app right there.\n\n474\n00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.070\nLet's highlight that.\n\n475\n00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.820\nAnd let's right click, and\nwe know we can do view diagram.\n\n476\n00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.870\nAnd when we view our diagram,\nthere is our diagram.\n\n477\n00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:13.570\nAnd if we go ahead and\nopen up either fuchsia, and/or green,\n\n478\n00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:18.350\nwe will see whatever instance that we\nhave been asked to take a look at and\n\n479\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.929\nwe'll see information,\neither there or over here.\n\n480\n00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.090\nFor our Ops manager data\nwarehouse database.\n\n481\n00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.970\nThat one does have information about it.\n\n482\n00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:30.910\nWe see a log file.\n\n483\n00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.070\nWe see primary\n&gt;&gt; Pretty nice!\n\n484\n00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.620\n&gt;&gt; databases.\n\n485\n00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.150\nAll healthy.\n\n486\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.950\n&gt;&gt; A lot better than trying\nto make this out of Paint.\n\n487\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.090\nTo some other kind of,\nyou know, tool like that.\n\n488\n00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember these are all so\ninteractive.\n\n489\n00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.550\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nthey've done a good job here.\n\n490\n00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:48.017\n&gt;&gt; They're actually, as you can see him\ndrilling down into the data table element.\n\n491\n00:23:48.017 --> 00:23:51.065\nAnd I see the data tables\nare healthy as well.\n\n492\n00:23:51.065 --> 00:23:52.435\nAnd remember we can right-click and\n\n493\n00:23:52.435 --> 00:23:56.695\nwe can interact with information around\nthe diagram here and see what's going on.\n\n494\n00:23:56.695 --> 00:23:58.525\nSo this is-\n&gt;&gt; Real time.\n\n495\n00:23:58.525 --> 00:24:01.645\n&gt;&gt; A much more powerful thing\nthan just having a picture.\n\n496\n00:24:01.645 --> 00:24:06.545\nSo this is very nice in the sense of\nnow we have a representation of our\n\n497\n00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:09.345\napplication and\nthe moving parts the components.\n\n498\n00:24:09.345 --> 00:24:12.640\nWe can look at real-time status\nupdates on health and performance, but\n\n499\n00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.010\nwe can also interact if necessary and\ndo some investigation and monitoring.\n\n500\n00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think Microsoft's done a really\ngreat job at showing us how to go ahead\n\n501\n00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.180\nand view those distributed applications.\n\n502\n00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:26.040\nAnd then thank you Adam for\nshowing us how to actually set it up and\n\n503\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.000\nuse this tool that they've provided.\n\n504\n00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.340\nIs there any final thoughts that you\nhave for this particular demo, or?\n\n505\n00:24:33.504 --> 00:24:37.280\n[LAUGH] All right, throw away the key.\n\n506\n00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.100\nWell I think that about covers it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n507\n00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.460\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n508\n00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.140\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n509\n00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:43.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n510\n00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.854\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n511\n00:24:46.854 --> 00:24:52.881\n[MUSIC]\n\n512\n00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:55.980\nThank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:17.580\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.620\nIn this episode, we'll be looking\nat end-to-end service monitoring.\n\n7\n00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.180\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n8\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.110\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.780\n&gt;&gt; You are welcome.\n\n10\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.960\nThat is I think the slowest\nI've heard you ever speak,\n\n11\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.490\nin addition to mispronouncing my name.\n\n12\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.380\nBut that's okay, we'll go with that.\n\n13\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.261\nIt's not a problem.\n\n14\n00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:36.861\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Are you sure?\n\n15\n00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:41.130\n&gt;&gt; I answer to anything as long\nas it is like within reason.\n\n16\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.370\nAdding is almost as good as Adam,\nit's like one letter off.\n\n17\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.400\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n18\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.570\nYou'd be surprised what people call me.\n\n19\n00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.730\nThat's not bad, so\nwe're going to go with that.\n\n20\n00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.290\nAll right, so we can clearly\nsee that Cherokee is excited.\n\n21\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.330\nWe're not going to allow her to speak\nagain until the end of the episode,\n\n22\n00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.440\nbut she does mean well.\n\n23\n00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.720\nWe are going to continue,\nas she said, with N10 monitoring.\n\n24\n00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.620\nThis is really kind of the cool\nthing about N10 monitoring.\n\n25\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.330\nIf you have not see our prior episodes\nabout application performance monitoring,\n\n26\n00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.290\nabout APM,\nwe did actually there go into and\n\n27\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.200\ndeal with almost everything\nwe're gonna talk about here.\n\n28\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.324\nBelieve it or not,\nbecause Cherokee was so excited and\n\n29\n00:01:16.324 --> 00:01:19.552\nsaid, we've got to talk about all of this,\nthat we fit it all in right there, and\n\n30\n00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:23.090\nwe actually have nothing left to talk\nabout here, we're done, believe it or not.\n\n31\n00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.660\nYou could turn off the monitor\nright now cuz like, we're finished.\n\n32\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.240\nWe've got to throw down a microphone or\nsomething.\n\n33\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.170\n&gt;&gt; I would say you can go home and\nrelax, but\n\n34\n00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.170\nyou probably are already at home and\nrelaxed.\n\n35\n00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.860\n&gt;&gt; You are, exactly.\n\n36\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.930\nSo, you can relax.\n\n37\n00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.180\nWe're going to keep working\nbecause that's what we do here.\n\n38\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.900\nNo, we are not done.\n\n39\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.220\nDont go away, I'm only kidding.\n\n40\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.500\nBut, we did actually cover the majority of\nthe conversation we're going to have here.\n\n41\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.060\nI'm going to remind you that\nif you've seen those episodes,\n\n42\n00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.400\nyou're probably gonna see and\nhear things that are review from there.\n\n43\n00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.890\nBut you know what, it's never a bad\nidea to hear this more than once.\n\n44\n00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.370\nIf you haven't seen those episodes yet,\nno big deal.\n\n45\n00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.260\nYou could pick up on\nsome of the stuff here.\n\n46\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260\nWe're not gonna demo all of the specifics\nwe're gonna talk about here,\n\n47\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.160\nbecause we've already\ndone a majority of them.\n\n48\n00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.740\nWe're gonna do some different demos.\n\n49\n00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.070\nWe'll take a look at how to do\nan override for a management pack here.\n\n50\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.940\nWe will take a look at doing some\nsynthetic transaction monitoring.\n\n51\n00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.570\nSo we're gonna take a look at web\napplication transaction monitoring\n\n52\n00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.870\nas opposed to web application availability\nmonitoring which we talked about\n\n53\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.150\nin the last episode.\n\n54\n00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.450\nWe did a full-blown demonstration\non how to actually do that there.\n\n55\n00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.660\nBut you are gonna hear me talk\nabout it here in relation to\n\n56\n00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.110\nwalking through the different\nmanagement pack templates that exist.\n\n57\n00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.600\nAnd explaining a little bit more about\nthe ones we haven't touched on yet.\n\n58\n00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.660\nWe've used the .NET application\nperformance monitoring one, the APM one.\n\n59\n00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.310\nWe have looked extensively at web\napplication availability monitoring.\n\n60\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.810\nSo we've gone through that, talked about\nwhat we call outside-in monitoring,\n\n61\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.320\ncommonly referred to as\nglobal service monitoring.\n\n62\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.380\nWe went through and talked about using\nwatcher nodes from different data centers\n\n63\n00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.000\nthat Microsoft maintains around\nthe world to be able to do this,\n\n64\n00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.150\nand we'll reinforce that review,\nthat concept with you.\n\n65\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.060\nBut we have a few other ones\nwe haven't really touched on.\n\n66\n00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.500\nIf you want to go through and take a look\nat, OLE, OLE-DB data source, process\n\n67\n00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.390\nmonitoring, TCP port monitoring, UNIX\nLinux log, and process monitoring, etc.\n\n68\n00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.680\nSo we are going to run through those.\n\n69\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.980\nJust make sure you\nare comfortable with them,\n\n70\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.890\nyou understand a little bit more about\nthem and you are familiar with them.\n\n71\n00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.850\nAnd then when we are done,\nwe will wrapping up and talking about\n\n72\n00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.780\nsome cool stuff with Vizio, which you\nmay or may not be aware of actually.\n\n73\n00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.000\nBring that back in.\n\n74\n00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.050\nAnd talk a bit about that.\n\n75\n00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.340\n&gt;&gt; I love Vizio, yeah.\n\n76\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.730\n&gt;&gt; It is a really neat little\ntool we can do a lot with it too.\n\n77\n00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.380\nIf we could just go in here for\njust a mere shake as they say or\n\n78\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.160\ntwo of the proverbial tail.\n\n79\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.460\nIf we could go full-screen just so\n\n80\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.190\nwe could see a little bit more about\nwhat we are talking about here.\n\n81\n00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.530\nWhat we are gonna focus on is just\nkind of running down the lists,\n\n82\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.579\nlet me just highlight here.\n\n83\n00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.320\nRunning down the list on the various\nmanagement pack templates, what they are,\n\n84\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.413\nwhat they're used for.\n\n85\n00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:51.983\nWe've talked about .NET application\nperformance monitoring and we've used\n\n86\n00:03:51.983 --> 00:03:55.400\nthe .NET application performance\nmonitoring template right above here.\n\n87\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.660\nLet me just highlight that one.\n\n88\n00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.970\nWe'll start with that one.\n\n89\n00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.180\nThis is used to do what we call APM,\n\n90\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.990\nthe Application Performance Monitoring,\nallows us to monitor a .NET,\n\n91\n00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.160\nthink a web-related application of some\nkind, and do performance monitoring on it.\n\n92\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.120\nWe've seen how to do this.\n\n93\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.190\nI'm not going to go through and\nactually create the monitor again.\n\n94\n00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.220\nBut, we right-click on\nany of these templates,\n\n95\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.690\nwe add the monitoring wizard we go\nthrough and choose the appropriate one.\n\n96\n00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.290\nWhen we do that, it does give us a little\nbackground here as to what each one is.\n\n97\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.500\nWe have to install the appropriate IS7 and\n\n98\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.640\nIS version 8 management packs,\nalong with the system center\n\n99\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.600\nweb application performance monitoring\nmanagement packs that go with it.\n\n100\n00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.640\nAnd then once we've done that,\n\n101\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.010\nwe then can go ahead, give this a name,\nwhatever we're gonna call that.\n\n102\n00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.220\nSelect our management pack,\nwe'll just quickly do the default here and\n\n103\n00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.000\nthen this is where the magic happens.\n\n104\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.470\nWe do want to monitor and\nwe specify add here,\n\n105\n00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.310\nwe go out and we search, and\nwe bring in our application.\n\n106\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.520\nIn this case, Orchestrator,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n107\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.970\nAnd then once we do that and\nwe specify what environment we would like,\n\n108\n00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.610\nwhat part of our staging production,\ntest environment.\n\n109\n00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.690\nWe are going to deploy.\n\n110\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.610\nThis monitors again.\n\n111\n00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.330\nThis is metadata tagging.\n\n112\n00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.540\nNothing more than that.\n\n113\n00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.960\nWhen we've done that, we click Next,\nwe specify both client and\n\n114\n00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.390\nserver side monitoring.\n\n115\n00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.560\nWe've got some advanced features.\n\n116\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.400\nWe can go in and\n\n117\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.980\nwe took a look at in depth in that\nother episode where we do the demo.\n\n118\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.050\nNot going to go back through all of\nthem now, encourage you to go back and\n\n119\n00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.090\ntake a look there if you\nwanna see more about that.\n\n120\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.780\nAnd when we're done, we click Next,\n\n121\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.920\nwe click Create and once we do that,\nwe get our .NET monitor.\n\n122\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.840\nIt takes just a minute to set-up,\nit's creating the folders and views.\n\n123\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.250\nRemember the value of time\nis to the management pack,\n\n124\n00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.750\nwhich is we get all the objects.\n\n125\n00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.120\nThe views and the reports and\nthe rules, and\n\n126\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.680\nwe're going to talk about overrides\nhere in a little bit, and all that.\n\n127\n00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.560\nSo all that comes in, so we're just\ngoing to essentially walk through and\n\n128\n00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.990\ntalk about this with every one of them.\n\n129\n00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.650\nLet's take a look at OLE-DB we go back,\nlet's keep full-screen just so\n\n130\n00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.830\nwe can see the detail there.\n\n131\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.648\nIt's gonna be hard for\nyou to see what we're doing otherwise.\n\n132\n00:06:02.648 --> 00:06:05.690\nSo with OLE-DB, what we're doing\nis looking at performance and\n\n133\n00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.930\navailability for databases.\n\n134\n00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.320\nObject linking and embedding,\nDB Database data source.\n\n135\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.720\nSo we're gonna talk about and\nlook at our connectivity out to one or\n\n136\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.900\nmore databases that could be\nconfigured for monitoring\n\n137\n00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.940\nthat connectivity against the databases\nand queries that we may be using, as well.\n\n138\n00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.450\nIf we were to quickly look at, for\n\n139\n00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.640\njust a second before we do that, our\npicture, our architecture, if you will.\n\n140\n00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.960\nWhat we're doing is looking at\nconnectivity, interconnectivity,\n\n141\n00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.720\ncommunication, and query speed and\ntime between the ops manager database,\n\n142\n00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.820\nthe ops manager data warehouse database,\nother reporting server element here and\n\n143\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.730\nmaybe our ACS or Audit Collection Services\ndatabase, which is not on the diagram but\n\n144\n00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.060\nmay also be used depending\non how we've set up scope.\n\n145\n00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.360\nSo we gonna be thinking about that.\n\n146\n00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.170\nWe're gonna come in here to OLE-DB\nyou'll see down here at the bottom\n\n147\n00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.220\nthis template allows you to monitor\nan OLE-DB compliant data source.\n\n148\n00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.740\nYou have to choose from a list of OLE-DB\nproviders, provide your connection string.\n\n149\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.500\nWe would go through.\n\n150\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.360\nGive this a name.\n\n151\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.050\nData OLE.\n\n152\n00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.780\nWe would specify our management pack.\n\n153\n00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.280\nWhoops!\n\n154\n00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.540\nSpecify our default management pack.\n\n155\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.660\nAnd then we have to provide our\nconnection string and our query.\n\n156\n00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.710\nI'm not going to all the way\nthrough this because I don't have\n\n157\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.680\nthe actual query set up, the connection\nstring set up to go out to the database.\n\n158\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.970\nBut you get the idea here.\n\n159\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.760\nI would go in, I'd be able to\ngo provide this information,\n\n160\n00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.140\nwalk all the way through configure this,\nset up my watcher nodes, and then I would\n\n161\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:40.310\nbe able to monitor that database and\nthat connection from inside of my LAN.\n\n162\n00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.220\nHitting it from different watcher nodes.\n\n163\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.070\nRemember, we define the watcher node\nconcept as being those machines\n\n164\n00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.970\nthat have the monitoring agent on them,\nthat we're using and saying,\n\n165\n00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.260\nhey, you're gonna monitor this box.\n\n166\n00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.620\nYou're going to be over\nhere monitoring this box.\n\n167\n00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.528\nAnd you over there,\nyou're going to monitor this box.\n\n168\n00:07:55.528 --> 00:07:59.205\nSo it's those systems that are being\npicked out, and we're saying, hey,\n\n169\n00:07:59.205 --> 00:08:00.910\nyou're gonna monitor for us.\n\n170\n00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.442\nAnd that's what the watcher\nnodes are going to be.\n\n171\n00:08:02.442 --> 00:08:08.864\nSo the OLE-DB Data source template allows\nus to set up that monitoring with and\n\n172\n00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:12.971\nfor, against databases in other words,\nright?\n\n173\n00:08:12.971 --> 00:08:15.135\nThat we want to look at\nthe performance of, and\n\n174\n00:08:15.135 --> 00:08:18.385\nthat's what we're going to be doing so\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n175\n00:08:18.385 --> 00:08:21.395\nWe do have our process\nmonitoring template here.\n\n176\n00:08:21.395 --> 00:08:25.515\nProcess monitoring template allows us\nto monitor the behavior of processes\n\n177\n00:08:25.515 --> 00:08:27.465\nthat should be running on\nan agent-managed computer,\n\n178\n00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:31.005\nor monitor the behavior of processes\nthat should not be running.\n\n179\n00:08:31.005 --> 00:08:33.565\nCuz remember,\nwe can look at things that are happening,\n\n180\n00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:34.925\nwe also may what to look at the inverse.\n\n181\n00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:37.155\nHey, if that does happen, but\nit's not supposed to happen,\n\n182\n00:08:37.155 --> 00:08:40.085\nI wanna know about it,\nversus it better be happening.\n\n183\n00:08:40.085 --> 00:08:41.470\nAnd we can look at either one.\n\n184\n00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.300\nAnd see how that works.\n\n185\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.380\nSo, let's look at the beginning set\nup stages of this real quickly.\n\n186\n00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.360\nWe're not gonna again run\nall the way through, but\n\n187\n00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.850\nwe will take a look at just\nsome of the specifics.\n\n188\n00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.220\nSo, let's look at process monitoring.\n\n189\n00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.430\nWe'll grab that real quick,\nwe'll give this a name.\n\n190\n00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.000\nCall this proc1.\n\n191\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.500\nAgain we'll select our management pack.\n\n192\n00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.650\nTo our default there.\n\n193\n00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.990\nLet's click Next.\n\n194\n00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.560\nNow, monitor whether and\nhow a process is running for\n\n195\n00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.810\nprocesses that we clearly\nwant to have running.\n\n196\n00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.540\nMonitor only whether the process\nis running for unwanted processes.\n\n197\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.350\nHey, is that process kicked off\nthat pesky notepad.exe thing.\n\n198\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.570\nDon't want that running.\n\n199\n00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.990\nIf it is, tell me about it, right?\n\n200\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.684\nSo, we could do that or this thing called\nCherokee app that I keep hearing about.\n\n201\n00:09:23.684 --> 00:09:25.315\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if we don't want that running,\n\n202\n00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:28.305\nthen we may want to go in there and\nshut down that down, right?\n\n203\n00:09:28.305 --> 00:09:29.685\nAll right so we could specify that.\n\n204\n00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:32.645\nSo you'll see, we have the ability\nto do a process name here.\n\n205\n00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:36.125\nWhether it's one we want or not,\nwe can go in, we can browse, and\n\n206\n00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:37.435\nwe can go find the process.\n\n207\n00:09:37.435 --> 00:09:41.225\nNow, we're looking for\na .exe as you can see here, right?\n\n208\n00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:45.585\nSo, what we would have to do is,\nlet's actually just go browse real quick.\n\n209\n00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:52.076\nSo let's say that we were going to go,\ninto I don't know, Internet Explorer and\n\n210\n00:09:52.076 --> 00:09:57.141\nwe were gonna look for,\nactually IE is probably not a good choice.\n\n211\n00:09:57.141 --> 00:10:01.880\nLet's say that we were gonna go in and\nwe were gonna look for, do we have,\n\n212\n00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.015\nwe won't actually have\nanything in PowerShell either.\n\n213\n00:10:06.015 --> 00:10:07.145\nLet's do the following.\n\n214\n00:10:07.145 --> 00:10:09.975\nLet's just do it this way, we'll just type\nin one, I'm just trying to think of one\n\n215\n00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:13.305\nthat I know the path to but\nwe could do that, no big deal.\n\n216\n00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:15.815\nCwindowssystem32.\n\n217\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:24.685\nAnd then if I'm typing correctly, Notepad\ninstead of Votepad, let me fix that.\n\n218\n00:10:24.685 --> 00:10:27.370\nNotepad.exe, right.\n\n219\n00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.760\nAnd so, we could put that in and\nwe could say okay hey,\n\n220\n00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.730\nthat's the process that I\nwant to monitor for right?\n\n221\n00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:38.060\nSo we can do that And we could specify and\n\n222\n00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.490\nwe can have a targeted group\nthat helps us narrow our search.\n\n223\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:46.910\nSo, here we can go in search here let give\nthis a second to come up and we can say\n\n224\n00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:52.910\nthat we want databases or something\nlike that whatever a group like maybe.\n\n225\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:57.150\nAnd then we'll specify allowable\nranges of the process instance or\n\n226\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.470\nwhat we're gonna monitor\nbased on running time.\n\n227\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.650\nSo, it's different options here for\nthe duration of the process may run.\n\n228\n00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.900\nThe number of minimum\nnumber of processes or\n\n229\n00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.380\nmaximum number of processes\nwe want to look for.\n\n230\n00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.400\nSo, we got some detail thought\nprocess that goes in there.\n\n231\n00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.643\nCan also look at performance\ncounters around CPU and\n\n232\n00:11:13.643 --> 00:11:16.156\naround memory usage too low or too high.\n\n233\n00:11:16.156 --> 00:11:19.140\nLike what's that threshold if it's\nconsuming too much we wanna know.\n\n234\n00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.510\nSo we could set that up as well.\n\n235\n00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:26.164\nAnd then, once we're done with all\nthat we hit next, we finish up and\n\n236\n00:11:26.164 --> 00:11:30.437\nonce we've done that we then\nwill have our monitor available.\n\n237\n00:11:30.437 --> 00:11:32.530\nAnd we'll be able to start\nmonitoring processes.\n\n238\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:37.720\nSo, we can walk through and configure\nthis out, either for the reaffirmation of\n\n239\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.390\nprocesses we wanna see running, or, hey,\nit is running and it's not supposed to be.\n\n240\n00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.140\nAnd it can alert us to that fact.\n\n241\n00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.320\nSo this is actually a valuable one,\n&gt;&gt; Pretty nice, yeah.\n\n242\n00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.950\n&gt;&gt; One that would be very helpful for us.\n\n243\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.590\nWe could also do TCP port monitoring.\n\n244\n00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.810\nLet's highlight this one, we'll take\na look here at monitoring Wizard.\n\n245\n00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.800\nWe'll go in,\nwe'll grab the TCP Monitor Wizard,\n\n246\n00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.210\nif you see down at the bottom here,\nyou'll see that we're gonna monitor for\n\n247\n00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.630\nan application that is listening to or\non a specific TCP port.\n\n248\n00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:09.660\nSo if we wanna see http for\nweb services on port 443https.\n\n249\n00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:16.170\nOn port 443, that's what we're going to be\nmonitoring for using this particular one.\n\n250\n00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.080\nWe're gonna check essentially for\nthe availability of a port and\n\n251\n00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.170\nthe use of it, right?\n\n252\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.480\nSo that's gonna make sense for us.\n\n253\n00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.920\nSo we'll click Next,\nwe'll give this a name, port.\n\n254\n00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.699\nWe'll specify our management pack.\n\n255\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.435\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll then specify the computer or\n\n256\n00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:34.035\nthe device that we're gonna connect to.\n\n257\n00:12:34.035 --> 00:12:38.860\nSo this would be plab sys\nlet's say zero one and\n\n258\n00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.205\nthen port, whatever that we wanna have.\n\n259\n00:12:43.205 --> 00:12:45.825\nWe would do a test see whether or\nnot that's available.\n\n260\n00:12:45.825 --> 00:12:48.425\nYou'll see it is,\nyou'll see we got the response time.\n\n261\n00:12:48.425 --> 00:12:50.115\nThis is the local machine\nby the way right.\n\n262\n00:12:50.115 --> 00:12:52.655\nSo essentially,\nI'm checking my own machine here.\n\n263\n00:12:52.655 --> 00:12:55.845\nBut you can see that we're able to\nrespond in almost no time at all.\n\n264\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.560\nSpecify the watcher node that\nwill do the monitoring for us.\n\n265\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.130\nThen, set that up and then how often do we\nwanna run the query to check the monitor?\n\n266\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.744\nThe default one is two minutes,\nmeaning every two minutes that machine on\n\n267\n00:13:09.744 --> 00:13:13.849\nthe screen in front of you with\nthat check box right here, right.\n\n268\n00:13:13.849 --> 00:13:18.075\nIs gonna hit that machine that I specified\non that port every two minutes to see\n\n269\n00:13:18.075 --> 00:13:19.450\nwhether it's up or not.\n\n270\n00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.780\nIt's almost like a heartbeat check.\n\n271\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.630\nAnd it's gonna then come back and\nsay, yes, it's on.\n\n272\n00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:24.190\nYes, it's on.\n\n273\n00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.170\nOops, nope, it's not.\n\n274\n00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.140\nNo, it's not, no, it's not.\n\n275\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.480\nNope, now it's back again.\n\n276\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.470\nSo maybe we're recycling it\nbecause of maintenance mode or\n\n277\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:34.190\nmaybe we're doing some patching or\nwe took down the service that was running.\n\n278\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.930\nOn that port.\n\n279\n00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.630\nNow, we're restarting it, so we're gonna\nbe able to tell, every two minutes,\n\n280\n00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.310\nwhat's happening with that, or\nwhatever time value we specify, right.\n\n281\n00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.270\nTwo minutes is our default.\n\n282\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.530\nWe can modify that, of course,\nput anything in there we would like.\n\n283\n00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.490\nBut the idea here would be that\nthen we could get up to date,\n\n284\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:52.210\nor relatively speaking, near real\ntime up to date status, on ports and\n\n285\n00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.840\nthe availability of them.\n\n286\n00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.696\nWe have Unix log file monitoring and\nUnix process, UNIX/Linux log, and\n\n287\n00:13:58.696 --> 00:14:01.180\nUnix/Linux process monitoring.\n\n288\n00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.560\nYou can probably guess what these do,\nright?\n\n289\n00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.900\nWe're gonna check for\nthe availability of, or\n\n290\n00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.940\nlook for the existence of a string in the\nlog files with the log file monitoring.\n\n291\n00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:15.280\nSo if it says machine five, or\nwhatever the string is we're looking for,\n\n292\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.670\nwe're gonna monitor the logs looking for\nthe representation of that string or\n\n293\n00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.140\nthat information in the log,\nflag that instance and\n\n294\n00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.560\nalert us to the fact that it's happening.\n\n295\n00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.450\nThis lets us reach out proactively,\nlook for\n\n296\n00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.140\ninformation in log files that\nwould be of interest to us.\n\n297\n00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.590\n&gt;&gt; That sounds pretty customizable,\nyou could have a particular string there,\n\n298\n00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.570\nmaybe even an error message?\n\n299\n00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.490\nYou could or an error code.\n\n300\n00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Things like that.\n\n301\n00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.270\nSo it'd be more like an error\ncode than a message.\n\n302\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.364\nBut aptly either one-\n&gt;&gt; What I mean, [LAUGH]\n\n303\n00:14:39.364 --> 00:14:40.219\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, absolutely!\n\n304\n00:14:40.219 --> 00:14:42.580\nEither one would be 100% accurate.\n\n305\n00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.684\nIt's just that more often than not, we're\ngonna probably have specific code that's\n\n306\n00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:46.990\ngenerated-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n307\n00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.120\n&gt;&gt; For a lot of those errors.\n\n308\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.840\nAnd so, we would look for that string.\n\n309\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.370\nError code whatever whatever is this,\nand that's what you would search for.\n\n310\n00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.770\nSo it is highly customizable,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n311\n00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:56.350\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n312\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.670\nthe process monitoring\n&gt;&gt; For Linux and Unix, right down there.\n\n313\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:04.690\nThis one is going to allow us to run or\nlook for evidence of processes running,\n\n314\n00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.030\nso same idea, on Windows,\n\n315\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.885\nit's just essentially\ntranslated into Unix and Linux.\n\n316\n00:15:08.885 --> 00:15:12.440\nWanna make sure specific processes\nare running, this is what we look for.\n\n317\n00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:18.120\nThis is essentially gonna be the same\nas process monitoring template up here,\n\n318\n00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.520\nbut process monitoring is for Windows.\n\n319\n00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.290\nThis is the idea of process monitoring but\nUnix Linux.\n\n320\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.433\nIt's the same idea.\n\n321\n00:15:24.433 --> 00:15:25.729\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; It's just what operating\n\n322\n00:15:25.729 --> 00:15:26.710\nsystem are we using.\n\n323\n00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.650\nThe template is set up\na little differently.\n\n324\n00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.380\nAnd as a result,\nit's always nice, by the way,\n\n325\n00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:35.900\nwhen your demo environment feels free to\ntalk to you and communicate with you.\n\n326\n00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.830\n&gt;&gt; We're still connected!\n\n327\n00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:37.840\n&gt;&gt; We wanna be connected.\n\n328\n00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.870\nWe wanna have openness here.\n\n329\n00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.430\nWe're very good about sharing.\n\n330\n00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.635\nSo it's good when reports back and\ntells you that it's feeling connected.\n\n331\n00:15:43.635 --> 00:15:45.041\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me reach out and\n\n332\n00:15:45.041 --> 00:15:47.960\nhug it because I think\nyou are just awesome.\n\n333\n00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.160\nLittle pat on the console there.\n\n334\n00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.140\nThank you for telling me you're connected.\n\n335\n00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.020\nAll right, so,\nyou gotta be careful what you wish for.\n\n336\n00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.670\nIt keeps saying we should have these\ninteractive signs that flash up when\n\n337\n00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.215\nthings happen and there you go.\n\n338\n00:15:59.215 --> 00:16:00.713\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, we are connected.\n\n339\n00:16:00.713 --> 00:16:02.102\nSo we do have the Unix,\n\n340\n00:16:02.102 --> 00:16:06.760\nLinux concept for monitoring for\nprocesses just like we do in Windows.\n\n341\n00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.308\nThat's a good one.\n\n342\n00:16:07.308 --> 00:16:09.790\nWe've talked extensively\nabout web availability or\n\n343\n00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.260\nweb application availability monitoring.\n\n344\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.958\nDid a nice long demo for you on this.\n\n345\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.892\nAnd showed you how to set it up in\nthe prior episodes when we talked about\n\n346\n00:16:17.892 --> 00:16:19.598\napplication performance monitoring.\n\n347\n00:16:19.598 --> 00:16:22.316\nIf you haven't seen that,\ndefinitely wanna go back and take a look.\n\n348\n00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:25.800\nAnd we're gonna jump over that one,\ncuz we've already talked about that.\n\n349\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.430\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ntalk about the ability to go in and\n\n350\n00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.940\nset up web application\ntransaction monitoring.\n\n351\n00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.580\nJust to give you an idea of what this one\nis, we're gonna break this one out and\n\n352\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.006\ndo a separate demo on this to actually\nshow you and how to set it up.\n\n353\n00:16:40.006 --> 00:16:42.690\nBut like I've been doing with the others,\nlet me just quickly give you a little\n\n354\n00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.110\nteaser of what it is,\nso you understand it.\n\n355\n00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.168\nWe can go in to\nWeb Application Transaction Monitoring.\n\n356\n00:16:48.168 --> 00:16:49.736\nWe'll right-click, as we have.\n\n357\n00:16:49.736 --> 00:16:52.040\nWe'll do a little\nAdd Monitor Wizard there.\n\n358\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.718\nAnd just like the others,\nwe'll select the appropriate one.\n\n359\n00:16:54.718 --> 00:16:58.900\nAnd we'll then be able to go in and\nwe will click Next.\n\n360\n00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.067\nWe'll give it a name.\n\n361\n00:17:00.067 --> 00:17:04.491\nNow the interesting thing about this,\nlet me just choose the default\n\n362\n00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:08.317\nManagement pack while we do this,\nis we'll specify a URL.\n\n363\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.390\nReally don't care what this is for\nthe moment.\n\n364\n00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.110\nWe're not interested, and\n\n365\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:15.200\nI'm just putting something in\njust to get to the next screen.\n\n366\n00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.750\nThe interesting thing about this, right,\nis our ability to be able to specify that\n\n367\n00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.615\nwe wanna be able to choose\nour watcher node, right?\n\n368\n00:17:22.615 --> 00:17:25.940\nHit Next, do what we wanna do here,\nso let me just choose that.\n\n369\n00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.055\nNow, the interesting thing, and this is\nwhere you're gonna have to come back and\n\n370\n00:17:29.055 --> 00:17:31.598\nwatch the full demo, cuz we're not\ngonna show you this right now.\n\n371\n00:17:31.598 --> 00:17:33.270\nBut I'm just gonna point it out to you.\n\n372\n00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.970\nBut the interesting thing, the magic that\nhappens here is the cool part where we do\n\n373\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.828\nconfigure advance monitoring or\nrecord a browser session.\n\n374\n00:17:39.828 --> 00:17:41.660\nWe actually checked this off.\n\n375\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.611\nAnd then we can use this\nto run a scripted demo,\n\n376\n00:17:44.611 --> 00:17:47.578\nhit the server that\nrepresents this website.\n\n377\n00:17:47.578 --> 00:17:51.408\nRecord all the interactions to the browser\nas we're actually engaging and\n\n378\n00:17:51.408 --> 00:17:52.390\nwalking through.\n\n379\n00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.720\nAnd seeing how things behave.\n\n380\n00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.540\nAnd then be able to monitor all that,\nand see that data.\n\n381\n00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.940\nSo this is gonna be the ability for\nus to essentially go in.\n\n382\n00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.761\nAnd much like a macro would be,\nwhere we record the steps,\n\n383\n00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:06.515\nif you're familiar with the Macro Recorder\nor the Step Recorder in Windows.\n\n384\n00:18:06.515 --> 00:18:09.947\nIf you've ever seen that tool,\nwe actually can go through and\n\n385\n00:18:09.947 --> 00:18:12.280\ndecide exactly how we're gonna go.\n\n386\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.070\nAnd test that website on\nwhat we're gonna do with it.\n\n387\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.739\nSo that part you're gonna see when you\ncome back and watch the full demo.\n\n388\n00:18:16.739 --> 00:18:19.050\nBut I'm just pointing it out to you so\nyou know what we can do here.\n\n389\n00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.180\nCuz a lot of people miss that.\n\n390\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.260\nThey go through this thing,\nthey click Next.\n\n391\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.220\nAnd Next, Next, Next,\nthey're done, they click Create.\n\n392\n00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.640\nThey missed that, and they just missed\nthe whole value of this particular tool.\n\n393\n00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.720\nThey really didn't realize that's there.\n\n394\n00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.010\nSo we're gonna demo that for you.\n\n395\n00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.700\nSo you're gonna come back and\ntake a look at that.\n\n396\n00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.980\nBut the Web Application\nTransaction Monitoring,\n\n397\n00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.840\nthis allows us to create what are called\nsynthetic transactions, right?\n\n398\n00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.767\nThis is the idea of being able to decide\nhow we're gonna interact with that\n\n399\n00:18:42.767 --> 00:18:43.649\nweb server.\n\n400\n00:18:43.649 --> 00:18:48.176\nAnd pretend to be a user doing what a user\ndoes so we can get a more accurate picture\n\n401\n00:18:48.176 --> 00:18:52.168\nof how that's gonna behave and\nunderstand the impact of our choices,\n\n402\n00:18:52.168 --> 00:18:54.961\nthe performance, and\nall the things that go on.\n\n403\n00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:57.540\nThis is what we call,\nsynthetic transaction monitoring.\n\n404\n00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.250\nWe are gonna drive what that\ninteraction looks like.\n\n405\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.540\nThat's what we're gonna be doing.\n\n406\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.380\nSo that's what we'll be able to do here.\n\n407\n00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.701\nSo this one's cool, you're gonna come\nback here to see a demo on that.\n\n408\n00:19:05.701 --> 00:19:07.189\nWe're gonna take a look at that.\n\n409\n00:19:07.189 --> 00:19:12.010\nWe also have the Windows Service\nManagement Template right down here.\n\n410\n00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.630\nWe've taken a look at this and\ntalked about this before.\n\n411\n00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.480\nThis is used to monitor a specified or\n\n412\n00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.700\nspecific instance of a Windows Server\nrunning on an agent managed computer.\n\n413\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.925\nI want to see every instance of,\nI don't know,\n\n414\n00:19:24.925 --> 00:19:29.798\nnotepad.exe or services.mmc or\nwhatever it can be.\n\n415\n00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.660\nAnd this is what we would use.\n\n416\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.830\nWe would go in, we would right-click.\n\n417\n00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.750\nAgain, add monitoring, just like\nwe've been doing for everything else.\n\n418\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.270\nWe would do Windows Services\ndown at the bottom.\n\n419\n00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.120\nWe'll click Next, we'll give it a name.\n\n420\n00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.617\nWe will specify our management pack.\n\n421\n00:19:46.334 --> 00:19:47.699\nWe will click Next.\n\n422\n00:19:47.699 --> 00:19:51.981\nWe, just like we did in other monitor,\nhave to provide the service details.\n\n423\n00:19:51.981 --> 00:19:58.790\nSo c:/windows/system32/notepad.exe,\n\n424\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:03.817\nright, or whatever the case may be.\n\n425\n00:20:03.817 --> 00:20:05.964\nThen we'll do our targeted group.\n\n426\n00:20:08.578 --> 00:20:10.377\nJust do a quick search here.\n\n427\n00:20:12.007 --> 00:20:13.588\nAnd whatever that is.\n\n428\n00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:17.099\nAnd then you saw me walk through the\nsettings on this already as we were going\n\n429\n00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:19.230\nthrough and looking at process monitoring.\n\n430\n00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.856\nIt's very similar to process monitoring,\nbut it's focused on services.\n\n431\n00:20:22.856 --> 00:20:25.677\nSo you would give it the right\nappropriate service name, right?\n\n432\n00:20:25.677 --> 00:20:26.680\nSo we would do that.\n\n433\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.770\nThis is unique to Windows, of course.\n\n434\n00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.550\nClick Yes there to get out of that.\n\n435\n00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.360\nSo we've got that.\n\n436\n00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.670\nWe've also talked about\ndistributed applications.\n\n437\n00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.996\nJust scroll down here.\n\n438\n00:20:35.996 --> 00:20:38.556\nWe've done a discussion on\ndistributed applications.\n\n439\n00:20:38.556 --> 00:20:41.700\nThis is where we got our Cherokee app,\nversion 1.0.\n\n440\n00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.024\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We created a lovely color mix,\n\n441\n00:20:44.024 --> 00:20:44.840\nby the way.\n\n442\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.738\nIt was a spring application,\nfull of bright and\n\n443\n00:20:47.738 --> 00:20:50.206\nvibrant colors like fuchsia and green.\n\n444\n00:20:50.206 --> 00:20:52.261\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you have not seen that episode,\n\n445\n00:20:52.261 --> 00:20:53.428\nabsolutely fabulous.\n\n446\n00:20:53.428 --> 00:20:54.927\nYou should definitely check it out.\n\n447\n00:20:54.927 --> 00:20:56.650\nI know we have talked about movies.\n\n448\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.338\nThis is our randomness side, by the way.\n\n449\n00:20:58.338 --> 00:20:59.866\nWe had talked about movies.\n\n450\n00:20:59.866 --> 00:21:01.924\nAnd I know you're not\na big advocate of them.\n\n451\n00:21:01.924 --> 00:21:03.775\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, we're gonna stay away from movies.\n\n452\n00:21:03.775 --> 00:21:05.696\nBut we've talked about some TV shows.\n\n453\n00:21:05.696 --> 00:21:07.796\nYou've been a little bit more connected.\n\n454\n00:21:07.796 --> 00:21:11.190\nDid you ever watched a series\ncalled Ab Fab, Absolutely Fabulous?\n\n455\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:12.555\n&gt;&gt; No, never heard of it [LAUGH].\n\n456\n00:21:12.555 --> 00:21:13.657\n&gt;&gt; You've never watched\nAbsolutely Fabulous?\n\n457\n00:21:13.657 --> 00:21:15.433\nA British comedy, awesome.\n\n458\n00:21:15.433 --> 00:21:17.940\nIf you have not seen it,\nyou should go back and take a look.\n\n459\n00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.850\nVery, very good.\n\n460\n00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.573\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Ab-Fab, so we're not gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely Fabulous, yes.\n\n461\n00:21:21.573 --> 00:21:22.623\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely Fabulous, okay.\n\n462\n00:21:22.623 --> 00:21:23.638\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely Fabulous, yes.\n\n463\n00:21:23.638 --> 00:21:26.261\nSo that was the end of the aside,\nbecause Cherokee hasn't seen this, so\n\n464\n00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:27.728\nthere's really no way to talk about it.\n\n465\n00:21:27.728 --> 00:21:30.180\nBut If you have seen it,\nyou know what I'm talking about.\n\n466\n00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.574\nIf you have not, well, when you're\ndone watching us, you better spin\n\n467\n00:21:33.574 --> 00:21:37.038\nup Netflix and go see if you can find\nsome Absolutely Fabulous episodes.\n\n468\n00:21:37.038 --> 00:21:38.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is a really cool show,\n\n469\n00:21:38.365 --> 00:21:39.620\nyou should take a look.\n\n470\n00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.380\nBut let's go back here, we need to\ntalk about distributed applications.\n\n471\n00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.670\nYou know we can create a new\ndistributed application.\n\n472\n00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.620\nWe used the Application Designer to\ngo in and lay out our application.\n\n473\n00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.278\nWhat I stressed to you in the prior\nepisode where we did this was,\n\n474\n00:21:51.278 --> 00:21:54.590\nand I'll remind you of this again, here,\nwe are not creating an application.\n\n475\n00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.116\nIt's a little misleading when they say,\nhey,\n\n476\n00:21:56.116 --> 00:21:58.020\nwe're gonna create\na distributed application.\n\n477\n00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.920\nYou're creating a visual representation,\n\n478\n00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.900\na graphical representation made of\ncontainers and objects that are then gonna\n\n479\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.080\nallow you to represent the application\nthat is actually running in the real\n\n480\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.689\nsystem somewhere by linking to an instance\nof it, and monitoring that instance.\n\n481\n00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.910\nHow you do all that is worth your time and\neffort to go and watch the episode\n\n482\n00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.310\nwhere we built the start to finish for\nyou of the demonstration we did.\n\n483\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.780\nBut the idea would be that you will\nessentially represent the app visually\n\n484\n00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.770\nby designing this.\n\n485\n00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.562\nAnd then use this designed\ndistributed application\n\n486\n00:22:30.562 --> 00:22:33.671\nwith the appropriate monitoring,\nonce you set it all up,\n\n487\n00:22:33.671 --> 00:22:37.172\nto understand the health state\nof the distributed application.\n\n488\n00:22:37.172 --> 00:22:40.310\nSo that is kinda cool, it's part\nof end-to-end service monitoring.\n\n489\n00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:43.180\nDefinitely wanna make sure you\nare able to take a look at that.\n\n490\n00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.490\nWe've also, in the prior episode\nwhere we talked about all of this,\n\n491\n00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.930\ntalked about something called\nGlobal Service Monitoring.\n\n492\n00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:49.940\n&gt;&gt; I really liked this topic.\n\n493\n00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.860\n&gt;&gt; This was pretty cool.\n\n494\n00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.770\nThis is what we'd sometimes hear\nreferred to as outside-in monitoring.\n\n495\n00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.545\nThis is where we are outside\nof the organization,\n\n496\n00:22:58.545 --> 00:23:00.668\nusing what are called watcher nodes.\n\n497\n00:23:00.668 --> 00:23:05.007\nThese are pre-determined monitor points\nthat Microsoft runs through the Azure\n\n498\n00:23:05.007 --> 00:23:09.024\nfabric that you can subscribe to and\nuse to monitor inbound against your web\n\n499\n00:23:09.024 --> 00:23:13.340\nservice, against your application,\nin other words, that's running.\n\n500\n00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.320\nAnd you could see the performance from\nIreland and the European data center,\n\n501\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.140\nfrom Brazil, from down in Miami and\nsouth Florida, from all over.\n\n502\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.125\nAnd we've got 16 or\n\n503\n00:23:23.125 --> 00:23:26.880\n17 watcher nodes that are running\ngeographically around the world.\n\n504\n00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.487\nAnd you can go out and\nyou can take a look.\n\n505\n00:23:29.487 --> 00:23:33.398\nWhen you do this, you'll be able to\ngo out and just search for this URL.\n\n506\n00:23:33.398 --> 00:23:36.560\nWe have a URL for this in the show notes,\nyou can take a look.\n\n507\n00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.468\nBut down here on the page, let me just\nget rid of the, was this helpful.\n\n508\n00:23:40.468 --> 00:23:44.940\nDown here, about halfway,\nmaybe three-quarters of the way,\n\n509\n00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.740\nwe do have a list of the Global Service\nMonitoring Locations that are available.\n\n510\n00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.809\nThere's one in Australia,\nas you can see, Brazil, in Zurich.\n\n511\n00:23:51.809 --> 00:23:56.614\nWe have one in Paris, Hong Kong,\nDublin, all over the place, right?\n\n512\n00:23:56.614 --> 00:23:59.384\nJapan, so they're in every major region.\n\n513\n00:23:59.384 --> 00:23:59.932\n&gt;&gt; A good representation there.\n\n514\n00:23:59.932 --> 00:24:03.919\n&gt;&gt; Good representation, right,\nso you can subscribe in.\n\n515\n00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:06.195\nAnd you can use these\nthrough the Azure fabric.\n\n516\n00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:09.022\nAnd so, you have to have\nthe Azure fabric set up, and\n\n517\n00:24:09.022 --> 00:24:12.314\nyou have to connect through Azure\nto be able to do this piece.\n\n518\n00:24:12.314 --> 00:24:16.787\nBut you're then gonna be able to leverage\nthis global real estate that's set up with\n\n519\n00:24:16.787 --> 00:24:20.882\nthese watcher nodes that you can then use\nto monitor inbound to your system and\n\n520\n00:24:20.882 --> 00:24:22.720\nunderstand the performance.\n\n521\n00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.650\nSo this is a really big additional\nthought process and a huge additional\n\n522\n00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.720\ncapability that we're bringing to\nthe table with global service monitoring.\n\n523\n00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.103\nSo, wanna make sure you\nbe in System Center,\n\n524\n00:24:33.103 --> 00:24:35.503\nuse System Center with Software Assurance.\n\n525\n00:24:35.503 --> 00:24:39.121\nIf you purchase System Center,\nthe suite, with Software Assurance,\n\n526\n00:24:39.121 --> 00:24:41.390\nyou will get access to this feature.\n\n527\n00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.530\nWe can use this to be able\nto monitor from outside in,\n\n528\n00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.120\nso you're gonna be able to do this.\n\n529\n00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:50.660\nWe're taking advantage of the Azure\ninfrastructure to be able to use as I said\n\n530\n00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.750\nthese watcher notes in\nMicrosoft to set up for us.\n\n531\n00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.730\nSo there's a little bit of work you gotta\ndo there on the backend to get set up.\n\n532\n00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.377\nIf you want,\nfollow the url in the show notes.\n\n533\n00:24:59.377 --> 00:25:02.497\nIt takes you to landing page, you get\nset up, you can get a free trial and\n\n534\n00:25:02.497 --> 00:25:03.910\nthen you could see how it works.\n\n535\n00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.504\nAnd ultimately if you like it you\ncan go ahead and you can use it.\n\n536\n00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:10.330\nWe also I had mentioned would be bringing\nin and discussing Visio a little bit.\n\n537\n00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.510\nRealtime Visio dashboard.\n\n538\n00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.820\nIt's a pretty cool feature\nthat we can use here as well.\n\n539\n00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.350\nWe can actually create up to\ndate views of our environment\n\n540\n00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:22.850\nusing Visio 2010 add-in for\nSystem Center 2012 for the Sco Manager.\n\n541\n00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.800\nNow you saw something similar to this.\n\n542\n00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.110\nIn some of the demos we did where\nwe have the network view and\n\n543\n00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:31.110\nwe saw the individual components, we can\nclick down on them and interact with them.\n\n544\n00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.681\nIt is similar to that if you're\nfamiliar with Visio diagrams,\n\n545\n00:25:33.681 --> 00:25:37.027\nwe actually said they they looked pretty\nmuch like Visio, it's almost identical\n\n546\n00:25:37.027 --> 00:25:39.614\nwith what you would see with\nVision when we were creating them.\n\n547\n00:25:39.614 --> 00:25:44.590\nSo the distributed applications diagrams\ncan be exported out into a Visio format.\n\n548\n00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:48.800\nYou asked me about being able to export\nsome information we could actually do that\n\n549\n00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.390\nand we could load them up in Visio.\n\n550\n00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:54.049\nThen we connect out through Visio\nthrough the apps manager and\n\n551\n00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:55.738\nthey become updatable in real-time,\n\n552\n00:25:55.738 --> 00:25:59.060\nand then these are now real-time\ndashboard elements that we can use.\n\n553\n00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.580\nSo we've had this ability to do\nthis kind of stuff with Visio,\n\n554\n00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.810\nin SharePoint, using the interaction\nbetween the Visio web-parts and\n\n555\n00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:10.500\nthe business intelligence stack in\nSharePoint for several generations now.\n\n556\n00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.333\nBut we're bringing that and\nextending that out with this idea.\n\n557\n00:26:14.333 --> 00:26:17.329\nWith the SharePoint 2010\nVisio Services Data Provider,\n\n558\n00:26:17.329 --> 00:26:20.310\nwe're able to then leverage that and\npull this data in.\n\n559\n00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:23.740\nSo one of the key value propositions\nof System Center is, and\n\n560\n00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.650\nwe've been talking about this in a lot\nof the episodes, is not just, hey,\n\n561\n00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:29.620\nit's one product,\nit's SCOM, it's S-C-C-M, or\n\n562\n00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.920\nData Protection Manager, or\nService Manager, whatever.\n\n563\n00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.311\nIt's this ecosystem, right?\n\n564\n00:26:35.311 --> 00:26:39.888\nIt's this holistic solution that touches\nevery aspect of the organization,\n\n565\n00:26:39.888 --> 00:26:42.460\nthe enterprise, and the data center.\n\n566\n00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:47.850\nAs a result of that and allows us then to\nleverage all these different areas and\n\n567\n00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.330\ntools to be able to make as we\nsay the magic happened, right?\n\n568\n00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.015\nTo be able to do real-time monitoring.\n\n569\n00:26:53.015 --> 00:26:56.070\nTo be able to interact with data,\nbe able to consume it, and\n\n570\n00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:00.540\nthen be able to be hopefully either\nslightly reactive based on timing, but\n\n571\n00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.870\nhopefully proactively monitoring state and\n\n572\n00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:07.190\nconfiguration as a result of understanding\nwhat our informatics is telling us.\n\n573\n00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.937\nWhat the information coming back is\ntelling us about the systems and\n\n574\n00:27:09.937 --> 00:27:12.168\nwhat they are doing or\nnot doing in some cases, right?\n\n575\n00:27:12.168 --> 00:27:15.435\nSo do keep in mind,\nthere's a couple of do's and\n\n576\n00:27:15.435 --> 00:27:21.050\ndon'ts associated with setting up the\nVisio dashboard and the Visio web parts.\n\n577\n00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.190\nPut some more detail into\nthe show notes for you.\n\n578\n00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.500\nThe biggest thing you gotta remember here\nis that you need to have all the prereqs\n\n579\n00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.960\nfor both the Visio add-in, and also\nthe SharePoint gives you that services\n\n580\n00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.288\nset up and available in the system part of\ninstallation configuration of either one.\n\n581\n00:27:35.288 --> 00:27:38.690\nOr you're gotta fail your things don't\nwork there's a lot of time change trying\n\n582\n00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:39.570\nto fix this.\n\n583\n00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.505\nSo go out and read that on\nthe information about how to set this up.\n\n584\n00:27:43.505 --> 00:27:47.495\nJust make sure you tick off all the boxes\non all the required prereqs and\n\n585\n00:27:47.495 --> 00:27:48.505\nthen make sure everything is in.\n\n586\n00:27:48.505 --> 00:27:51.808\nAnd then you go and install and\nconfigure and it really works flawlessly.\n\n587\n00:27:51.808 --> 00:27:55.865\nAnd also don't be thrown off by the fact\nthat we're referencing the 2010 version.\n\n588\n00:27:55.865 --> 00:27:58.585\nIt just means that's the version\nthat's currently being used.\n\n589\n00:27:58.585 --> 00:28:01.520\nBut it's supported for\nmultiple iterations the system center.\n\n590\n00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.730\nAnd it just hasn't been updated,\nthat's all it means.\n\n591\n00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:06.829\nSo it's the older version of\nthe connection for the Visio web service,\n\n592\n00:28:06.829 --> 00:28:09.530\nbut it still works fine and\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n593\n00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:10.850\nSo just be aware of that and\n\n594\n00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.090\nmake sure that you are using\nthe appropriate approach here.\n\n595\n00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:15.440\nBut you can read up on this on the web,\n\n596\n00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.160\nit's very simple to do and\nvery easy to configure.\n\n597\n00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.720\n&gt;&gt; Well, that is it, end to end,\nthere for our service monitoring.\n\n598\n00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.269\nSo thank you for\n\n599\n00:28:22.269 --> 00:28:25.107\ntaking the time to explain a lot of those\ndifferent concepts and technologies.\n\n600\n00:28:25.107 --> 00:28:26.440\nSome we've looked at and\n\n601\n00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.830\nsome we will begin to look at\nhere with our demonstrations.\n\n602\n00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.680\nSo, don't go anywhere, stay tuned.\n\n603\n00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.300\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n604\n00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.880\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n605\n00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.000\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n606\n00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.623\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITproTV.\n\n607\n00:28:37.623 --> 00:28:44.657\n[MUSIC]\n\n608\n00:28:44.657 --> 00:28:47.495\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.336\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:12.038\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:15.651\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Data Center Monitoring\nwith Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:17.760\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.777\nIn this episode we'll be demonstrating\nhow to configure overrides and\n\n8\n00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:24.956\nwe have the claw with us today.\n\n9\n00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:26.489\nBut no, really that's Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.237\nAnd I feel almost like this episode I\nshould be at a cashier's desk just say,\n\n11\n00:00:31.237 --> 00:00:35.331\nI need an override for aisle,\ncashier on aisle four or whatever.\n\n12\n00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:36.292\n&gt;&gt; Or management pack four.\n\n13\n00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:39.069\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] For a management pack,\nyes, that's what we're talking about,\n\n14\n00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:40.270\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n15\n00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.710\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nlet Adam take the stage and\n\n16\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.550\ndemonstrate that as he does so well.\n\n17\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.580\n&gt;&gt; So, how do everybody.\n\n18\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.890\nWe're gonna talk about overrides,\nlike Cherokee was saying.\n\n19\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.240\nAnd an override exactly as\nshe described is going to\n\n20\n00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.860\nbe something that we call out and\nsay hey, I need this, right.\n\n21\n00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.140\nSomebody help me with this.\n\n22\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.680\nAnd specifically what the override really\nimplies is the idea of taking what\n\n23\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.390\nis the standard operational thought\nprocess in the management pack.\n\n24\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.590\nWhatever the monitoring is cuz we're\ngonna override the monitoring.\n\n25\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.580\nWhatever the monitoring\nis that takes place and\n\n26\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.300\nwe're gonna kind of push that to the side\nand say, hey, normally it's this.\n\n27\n00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.640\nBut, let's do it this other way instead.\n\n28\n00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.340\nWe're gonna put on top of what that\nmonitor is something different that\n\n29\n00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.700\nchanges its behavior,\nhence the concept of overriding it.\n\n30\n00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.420\nAnd then, we're going to apply that\noverride to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n31\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.780\nSo I'm gonna invite you to sit back,\nrelax and\n\n32\n00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.930\ntake a look as we walk you\nthrough how to do this right now.\n\n33\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.850\nSo, what I've done is we've gone into\nour management pack objects area.\n\n34\n00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.570\nWe're still in the authoring area because\nthis is where all of the things that we\n\n35\n00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.800\nhave to configure, change, modify, apply,\nsomehow manipulate our objects and\n\n36\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.450\nthe templates that exist for\nmonitoring are gonna be taking place.\n\n37\n00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.582\nAnd so, we've been in and\nout of here doing demonstrations for you,\n\n38\n00:01:53.582 --> 00:01:56.984\nhave a whole bunch of episodes, where\nwe go in and look at different aspects\n\n39\n00:01:56.984 --> 00:02:00.928\nof the monitoring pack templates, or the\nmanagement pack templates rather up above.\n\n40\n00:02:00.928 --> 00:02:05.259\nDistributed applications, we created\nan application in honor of Cherokee, and\n\n41\n00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.207\nwe used that to be able to do\nsome diagrams monitoring and\n\n42\n00:02:08.207 --> 00:02:10.235\nunderstanding how things work.\n\n43\n00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:11.915\nBut now,\nwhat we're gonna do is take a look,\n\n44\n00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:15.275\nspecifically at one of the management\npack objects called monitors.\n\n45\n00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:18.861\nRemember, all the things that go into\nmanagement packs are called management\n\n46\n00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:21.046\npack objects, and so\nwe got a list of them here.\n\n47\n00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:24.685\nWe've got attributes,\nwe've got monitors, we've got overrides,\n\n48\n00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:29.170\nobject discoveries, rules, Service\nLevel Tracking, all that kind of stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.820\nWe're gonna look at monitors,\nspecifically.\n\n50\n00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.960\nI've come in, I've gone to the computer\narea over here on the right,\n\n51\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.040\nin where I can choose what kind\nof monitors are available to me.\n\n52\n00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.241\nSo, the computer category, Entity Health,\nwe're gonna go to availability.\n\n53\n00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:43.645\nSo, I'm just gonna Highlight\navailability here.\n\n54\n00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:45.175\nThis is what we're gonna use.\n\n55\n00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:49.034\nAnd we're going to, you could see,\ncome over here to the far side,\n\n56\n00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:50.950\ngo to overrides, click on that.\n\n57\n00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.710\nAnd then, we have the ability to disable\nthe monitor, that would be an override,\n\n58\n00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.777\nof a kind, but not really an override.\n\n59\n00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:58.367\nWe don't really call that an override.\n\n60\n00:02:58.367 --> 00:03:03.007\nI mean in theory, in my mind, I think of\noverriding as being, making changes and\n\n61\n00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:07.157\ndisabling what would certainly be a kind\nof change, but most people confuse this.\n\n62\n00:03:07.157 --> 00:03:09.067\nDisabling is just that, disabling.\n\n63\n00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:10.231\nTurn off the monitor.\n\n64\n00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.900\nAnd we classified that\ndifferently than overriding.\n\n65\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.120\nSo we also have override the monitor.\n\n66\n00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.594\nKeep the monitor on but\nmake the change in some way.\n\n67\n00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:20.960\nAnd that's what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna override here as you can see.\n\n68\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.510\nWe have some object and or\ngroup information we have to\n\n69\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.050\nthink through in our mind and\ndecide how we wanna operate with.\n\n70\n00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.920\nCan we go full screen, just so\nyou could see this little better?\n\n71\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.970\nWhile we're talking you'll see\nwe can do an override here for\n\n72\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.230\nall objects of the class,\nin this case computer, and or for\n\n73\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.450\ngroup or for\na specific object of class computer.\n\n74\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.390\nThis would be a specific computer.\n\n75\n00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.460\nMaybe computer one versus all objects\nof the class computer, meaning any and\n\n76\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.570\nall monitored end points that\nclassify themselves as computers,\n\n77\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.050\ndifference between them, right?\n\n78\n00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.710\nSo, we wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n79\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.120\nWe're gonna choose for a group.\n\n80\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.070\nWe'll go in and then we'll search for\nour group here.\n\n81\n00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.840\nYou can see that we have\na whole list of items\n\n82\n00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.240\nthat are going to be considered groups.\n\n83\n00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.960\nCategories of different computers\nthat we may be able to use.\n\n84\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.330\nWe have SQL Server in here.\n\n85\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.950\nWe have web services in here,\nwhich is some IS stuff.\n\n86\n00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.150\nA little bit further up,\nwe've got the Windows Server category.\n\n87\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.510\nWe've got Unix and Linux in here.\n\n88\n00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.580\nWe got all sorts of stuff that\nare categories really just to depends\n\n89\n00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.080\non what we wanna use.\n\n90\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.750\nWe're gonna use the all\nWindows computer category so\n\n91\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.370\nthat we can get all of the Windows\nmachines, and override them with\n\n92\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.120\nthis particular override we're\ngonna create on this monitor.\n\n93\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.170\nSo let me just find all Windows computers\nhere, we'll scroll down, scroll down,\n\n94\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.360\nthere we are, right there.\n\n95\n00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.448\nAll Windows computers,\nwe'll highlight that, we'll click OK.\n\n96\n00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.647\nThen, we have the ability to go in and,\n\n97\n00:04:44.647 --> 00:04:48.660\nwe've actually seen this grid before\nin one of our prior episodes.\n\n98\n00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.130\nWe've talked about the fact,\nlet's move this over so you can see this.\n\n99\n00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.334\nWe've talked about the fact that we\ncan then go in and do overrides and\n\n100\n00:04:56.334 --> 00:05:01.209\ngo in and edit and modify the individual\nproperties here in the grid centrally.\n\n101\n00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:03.970\nRow by row we can go in and\ndecide what we wanna do.\n\n102\n00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.990\nWhat we're seeing here right now,\nis the set up or\n\n103\n00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.730\ncentrally the layout of everything\nthat's currently taking place, right.\n\n104\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.610\nAnd what we can do,\n\n105\n00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.070\nis we can decide to go in to any one of\nthese and high light it randomly, one.\n\n106\n00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.872\nI think my second one down,\nalert priority.\n\n107\n00:05:20.872 --> 00:05:24.480\nAnd it's clicked so that I can\nenable the ability to edit override.\n\n108\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.774\nYou may have noticed when were just\nlooking at it before I clicked there,\n\n109\n00:05:27.774 --> 00:05:31.392\nit looked all kinda grayed out and washed\nout, because we were not, or had not,\n\n110\n00:05:31.392 --> 00:05:34.328\ndecided that we were gonna work\nwith any one item in particular.\n\n111\n00:05:34.328 --> 00:05:35.308\nAnd the one's above and\n\n112\n00:05:35.308 --> 00:05:38.470\nbelow are still looking like they're\nkind of washed out a little bit.\n\n113\n00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.647\nLooking kind of tired.\n\n114\n00:05:39.647 --> 00:05:40.785\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like you were saying you feel like.\n\n115\n00:05:40.785 --> 00:05:42.857\n&gt;&gt; I feel a little washed out too.\n\n116\n00:05:42.857 --> 00:05:44.916\n&gt;&gt; So, they're looking kind of like that,\nright?\n\n117\n00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:47.418\nSo but, when we click on one,\nas you can see we highlighted,\n\n118\n00:05:47.418 --> 00:05:48.740\nit becomes interactive.\n\n119\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.870\nWe do put a selection there,\nso a little check mark,\n\n120\n00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.110\na little carat indicating,\nhey, you are here, right.\n\n121\n00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.740\nAnd then,\nwe've got whatever the parameter name is.\n\n122\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.790\nBut we have is the ability to see\nthe default value, here, so we can see.\n\n123\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.720\nLet's just go full screen.\n\n124\n00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.300\nIt'll be a little easier for\nme to talk to you and\n\n125\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.610\nshow you this while we are doing it.\n\n126\n00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.640\nYou can see we see default value,\nthis indicates the default value is low.\n\n127\n00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.670\nYou'll see that the override\nvalue is specified here.\n\n128\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.110\nThe override value mirrors\nthe default value initially and\n\n129\n00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.060\nwhat we have to do is\nspecify an override value.\n\n130\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.400\nBecause by default we don't have\nan override value until we provide\n\n131\n00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.140\nsomething different than what's there.\n\n132\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.570\nSo, we populate that override value with\nthe default value to specify data or\n\n133\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.450\nvalues in the column for us to work with,\nand then we go in and modify that.\n\n134\n00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.780\nSo people often ask, hey,\n\n135\n00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.460\nwhy are all those override values\nidentical, right, to the default vales?\n\n136\n00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.180\nThey are specifically,\nbecause that's where we start out from.\n\n137\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.330\nBut we have to make a change and\n\n138\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.310\nonce we do that, we will then see\nthat the affected value column here,\n\n139\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.910\nwill be modified depending on\nthe change we make, right?\n\n140\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.010\nSo, let's instead of doing\nlow Let's go to high, right.\n\n141\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.150\nLet's click there.\n\n142\n00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.460\nSo when we do that we have\nthis new custom property or\n\n143\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.250\nthis new custom override down below.\n\n144\n00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.980\nWill be created in the not available,\nright, we have to specify.\n\n145\n00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.980\nClick apply to achieve\nthe new effective value for\n\n146\n00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.520\nthe parameter, so we may go in,\nchoose a little edit here.\n\n147\n00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.910\nWe may decide to edit\nthe override description.\n\n148\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.350\nThis is just the langauge\nassociated with the override.\n\n149\n00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.830\nHey, this is gonna do this.\n\n150\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.410\nI'm describing what it is so\nwhen somebody sees this,\n\n151\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.560\nthey have a better understanding.\n\n152\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.640\nSo something like, this will allow me\n\n153\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.772\nto change this from low to high.\n\n154\n00:07:31.772 --> 00:07:32.722\nOr whatever we're doing,\n\n155\n00:07:32.722 --> 00:07:34.878\njust you would write something\nin there that's meaningful.\n\n156\n00:07:34.878 --> 00:07:36.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we're just doing that,\n\n157\n00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.820\nthat's gonna be our description,\nwe're gonna specify our management pack.\n\n158\n00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.320\nWhoops, specify our management pack,\n\n159\n00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.100\nremember we have to specify our management\npack because we have to bind this to\n\n160\n00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.969\nthe management pack that we want to be\nable to create or use this override with.\n\n161\n00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:55.971\nSo, that it overrides the objects in\nthe management pack based on what we're\n\n162\n00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:57.040\nspecifying here.\n\n163\n00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.240\nSo, we have to decide where we're\ngonna wanna put this right?\n\n164\n00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.940\nWe do have to enable the override\nparameter and we do them, and\n\n165\n00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.330\nwe put the check mark in the box,\nI talked to you about that.\n\n166\n00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.950\nWe do then need to make sure we\nput this on to the specified or\n\n167\n00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.790\nthe specific override management pack, or\nwhatever management back we're gonna use.\n\n168\n00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.350\nI'm gonna put this in to\nthe client monitoring overrides\n\n169\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.730\nmanagement pack right\nabove the default one.\n\n170\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.880\nSo we're gonna use that, and then what\nwe're gonna do is, we'll set up whatever\n\n171\n00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.130\nour parameters are, whatever we decide\nthat we are going to do, right?\n\n172\n00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:34.650\nWhatever it may be, we may override or\ndecide to do a couple of these,\n\n173\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.610\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n174\n00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:43.810\nBut once we're done,\nclick OK, and we click Apply,\n\n175\n00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.690\nthen we now have created\nessentially an override, right?\n\n176\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.839\nAnd once we've done this.\n\n177\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.830\nWe then are going to decide that we can\n\n178\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.220\nuse this override if necessary\nwhen we do monitoring.\n\n179\n00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.640\nWe can also take a look potentially at\noverrides that may have been created and\n\n180\n00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.292\nwe can go see,\nlet's give this a second here,\n\n181\n00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:07.991\nwe can go see different overrides that may\nbe available or that have been created.\n\n182\n00:09:07.991 --> 00:09:10.930\nYou'll see we have management\npack object type monitor.\n\n183\n00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.752\nObject discovery, recovery, and or rule.\n\n184\n00:09:14.752 --> 00:09:18.760\nAnd so, depending on what we did and\nwhere it is, we'd have to go in and\n\n185\n00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.980\ntake a look and\nwe'd have to start looking and\n\n186\n00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.540\ndelving through all these different items\nto be able to go in and find the override.\n\n187\n00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.350\nBut our override will be there if we go\nall the way through the different options,\n\n188\n00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.320\ntake a look for it.\n\n189\n00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.970\nWe'll be able to find our override,\n\n190\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.030\nand we would actually be\nable to see evidence of it.\n\n191\n00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:39.030\nNow, we've talked about the fact that we\ncan also pull all the overrides out using\n\n192\n00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.570\nthe System Center Ops Manager shell,\nin other words PowerShell, right.\n\n193\n00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.360\nWe could use a PowerShell commandlet\nto be able to pull overrides out.\n\n194\n00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.800\nWe talked about this in one of the other\nepisodes, and we can actually go in and\n\n195\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.170\nwe can see or get a list of overrides.\n\n196\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.883\nAnd we can actually get that\nfrom the shell, we can check and\n\n197\n00:09:53.883 --> 00:09:56.064\nvalidate yep it's there,\nor hey no it's not.\n\n198\n00:09:56.064 --> 00:09:57.687\nThere's something wrong we've gotta go in,\n\n199\n00:09:57.687 --> 00:09:59.450\ngotta make sure that we\ndid this the right way.\n\n200\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.300\nSo, there's a few different ways to be\nable to look for evidence of overrides\n\n201\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.120\nthat have been created because\nremember you can see there's probably,\n\n202\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.320\nits almost 170 overrides just on\nthe management pack type here alone.\n\n203\n00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.870\nBy the time we get done,\nit's 158 on the rules.\n\n204\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.150\nYou got probably almost 340\noverrides just in the system more or\n\n205\n00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.490\nless by default just as we install\ninstead of management packs.\n\n206\n00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.550\nLet alone what we may do to customize-\n&gt;&gt; Your customized rules.\n\n207\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as we go through and\ncreate or own.\n\n208\n00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.370\nSo, there could be 100 of\noverrides that are created for\n\n209\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.810\nyou to do a variety of things.\n\n210\n00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.790\nGetting an authoritative list of them\nis actually gonna be very helpful, and\n\n211\n00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.070\nyou wanna make sure you're thinking about\nthat and just have a way of doing that.\n\n212\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.010\nYou could see we could just go through and\nbrowse here, but it may be hard for\n\n213\n00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.260\nus to see them here.\n\n214\n00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.280\nSo, we may wanna be thinking\nof the use of PowerShell.\n\n215\n00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.660\nI'm also just clicking on\nreporting here real quick.\n\n216\n00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.610\nWe can go in inside of the reporting\n\n217\n00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.990\narea here and we can also go in,\nand we can take a look at.\n\n218\n00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:02.010\nDepending on what we're doing, we can\ntake a look at either a report that may\n\n219\n00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.390\nalready be created to show us\noverrides in certain monitoring areas,\n\n220\n00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.790\nor we've talked about the value of\ncreating our own reports before.\n\n221\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.080\nWe could create a report\nusing a report designer tool\n\n222\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.020\nthat would let us see overrides, and\nwe could then pull that data out and\n\n223\n00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.030\nactually have a list of overrides, or\nan ongoing report that could be updated.\n\n224\n00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:25.260\nWe could actually create a dashboard,\nand use the customization options for\n\n225\n00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.700\ndashboard creation.\n\n226\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.620\nAnd perhaps create a monitor\nthat would show us overrides or\n\n227\n00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.420\nat least give us a list.\n\n228\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.780\nSo, there's even different options\ndepending on what we wanna do to be able\n\n229\n00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.880\nto create the override and work with it.\n\n230\n00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.750\nBut, it's important for us to be aware of\nthe fact that we can create an override.\n\n231\n00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.460\nIt's important for us to know that\noverrides are going to allow us to apply\n\n232\n00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.330\nchanges to a management\npack that is sealed.\n\n233\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.474\nWe've talked about the different kinds\nof management packs before just while\n\n234\n00:11:50.474 --> 00:11:51.290\nWe're doing this.\n\n235\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.610\nLet me bring management\npacks back up real quick.\n\n236\n00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.420\nRemember, we applied this to the client\nmonitoring overrides management pack,\n\n237\n00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.430\nthat's the management pack I\nchose to apply my override to.\n\n238\n00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:05.030\nIt is an open management pack,\nwhat we call an unsealed management pack.\n\n239\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.940\nIt's there by default,\n\n240\n00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.450\nit's imported into the system to give\nus a place to put our overrides.\n\n241\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:14.180\nBut, we can also apply these\noverrides to some other ones,\n\n242\n00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.810\nthe default management pack,\nothers that may be available to us.\n\n243\n00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.912\nSo, we're taking the idea of what's\nin an existing management pack and\n\n244\n00:12:20.912 --> 00:12:22.063\nexisting monitor.\n\n245\n00:12:22.063 --> 00:12:23.751\nAnd then, we're gonna modify it and\n\n246\n00:12:23.751 --> 00:12:27.140\nthen store those changes those\noverrides in another management pack.\n\n247\n00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.180\nCreating the ability\nto combine the two and\n\n248\n00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.970\nthen generate something that's\nthen gonna work for us.\n\n249\n00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.450\nAnd we may have to create a separate\nunsealed management pack for us to be able\n\n250\n00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:39.090\nto do that or use the few that\nare provided automatically out of the box.\n\n251\n00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.660\nChoice is up to us and that's\nobviously something you'll figure out\n\n252\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.320\nin the real world, based on the best way\nfor you to approach that in your business.\n\n253\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.320\nBut, we've shown you how to\ncreate a Management Pack.\n\n254\n00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.920\nIt would not be hard to do.\n\n255\n00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.250\nAnd just by way of demonstration,\njust specifically to show you something.\n\n256\n00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.540\nTo remind you this Management Pack,\nright here, create Management pack.\n\n257\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.840\nIt's very simple to do.\n\n258\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.850\nIt's going to be a unsealed\nmanagement pack.\n\n259\n00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.370\nWe're just going to give it a name.\n\n260\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.630\nLet's call this Ops.\n\n261\n00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.270\nActually let's use A, so\nit comes up at the top of the list.\n\n262\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:13.904\nSo, we'll call it A-Ops-manage\n\n263\n00:13:13.904 --> 00:13:19.750\npack over, over writer, right?\n\n264\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.720\nAnd all we have to do is give it a name,\nclick there, we're not gonna bother with\n\n265\n00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.591\nany description or\ndocumentation on the knowledge tab.\n\n266\n00:13:26.591 --> 00:13:30.319\nThat would just be, hey this management\npack overrides being used for blah, so\n\n267\n00:13:30.319 --> 00:13:31.630\nit would just be narrating.\n\n268\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.590\nWe're not gonna bother\nwith that right now.\n\n269\n00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:34.690\nWe'll just click Create here.\n\n270\n00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.646\nAs soon as that is it's already\nthere you can see it there.\n\n271\n00:13:38.646 --> 00:13:42.573\nWhat we then can do if we wanted to\ngo back here, and have an option or\n\n272\n00:13:42.573 --> 00:13:46.800\nhave the ability I think I actually\nput a period in there or a comma.\n\n273\n00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.240\nHave the ability to go back here and\nbe able to use this.\n\n274\n00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.290\nLet's just say we go back here to\nthe monitors one more time and\n\n275\n00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.600\nwe go back here to computers.\n\n276\n00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.380\nOne more time so\nlet's just scroll down where we were.\n\n277\n00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.211\nJust a minute ago you just didn't see\nall the different categories that\n\n278\n00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:03.206\nwere there instead already\nselected computers.\n\n279\n00:14:03.206 --> 00:14:06.950\nBut let's just scroll down\nback here to where we were.\n\n280\n00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.700\nBack through the 5,000 instances of\ncards where we get to computers.\n\n281\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.040\nAll right, so there we are right there.\n\n282\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.040\nSo we get to computer and\nwe'll just open this up real quick,\n\n283\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.470\nopen up entity health\nthe way we were just doing.\n\n284\n00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.984\nOpen up availability just one more time.\n\n285\n00:14:20.984 --> 00:14:23.640\nRight-click, you see we do\nan override right from here.\n\n286\n00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.690\nWe, don't necessarily have to\ngo to the right-hand side.\n\n287\n00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.350\nWe've pointed out and Cherokee's\npointed out as I've been doing this,\n\n288\n00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.320\nhey more than one way to do that,\nabsolutely, it's all the same.\n\n289\n00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.480\nWe're just operating on the object, so\nwhether we do it from a right-click or\n\n290\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.520\nwe go off to the right to the task area,\nwe get to the same place.\n\n291\n00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.370\nIt's up to you.\n\n292\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.480\nJust a question of what you are in the\nmood for and or you feel more comfortable.\n\n293\n00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.681\nSo, we'll go ahead and we'll do\na group again and we'll go ahead and\n\n294\n00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:51.640\nchoose all Windows computers,\njust one more time.\n\n295\n00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.350\nLet's click OK, and\nthen we've already got that.\n\n296\n00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.906\nYou'll see the couple that I have there,\nright?\n\n297\n00:14:57.906 --> 00:14:59.676\nActually, you know what?\n\n298\n00:14:59.676 --> 00:15:01.810\nInstead of doing that one, hold on,\ncuz I don't want to edit that one.\n\n299\n00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:02.970\nI forgot, I already did that.\n\n300\n00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.300\nI want to create a new one,\nassign it to the other management packs.\n\n301\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:10.786\nSo let me override the let me override for\na different group.\n\n302\n00:15:10.786 --> 00:15:13.160\nAnd let's do there.\n\n303\n00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.010\nWe'll do databases.\n\n304\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.580\nAnd let's go ahead.\n\n305\n00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.700\nLet's just select something.\n\n306\n00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.741\nAgain, we're not worried about\nwhat we're overriding right now.\n\n307\n00:15:19.741 --> 00:15:24.013\nI just wanna show you the idea that since\nwe created the management pack that is\n\n308\n00:15:24.013 --> 00:15:27.440\nopen, you'll see that we have\nan unsealed management pack.\n\n309\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.755\nIf we go full screen,\nyou can see I'm selecting or\n\n310\n00:15:29.755 --> 00:15:33.080\nabout to select my own management\npack that I just created there.\n\n311\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.650\nA apps manager pack overrider or whatever.\n\n312\n00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:39.720\nThese are all the management packs\nthat are unsealed that we can store\n\n313\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.840\nour overrides in.\n\n314\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.940\nSo we create a new one.\n\n315\n00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:46.320\nIt's easier for us to then bind to that or\nwe can use one of the existing ones.\n\n316\n00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.860\nNow, the default management pack is\nconsidered an unsealed management pack,\n\n317\n00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.110\nwe could store stuff there.\n\n318\n00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.608\nBut, we also have the one\nspecific to overrides,\n\n319\n00:15:53.608 --> 00:15:57.310\nclient monitoring override management\npack, the one I selected first.\n\n320\n00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.859\nAnd we can do either one of those or\ncreate our own, and\n\n321\n00:15:59.859 --> 00:16:02.700\nthen we just name it accordingly,\nyou know what it is.\n\n322\n00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:08.150\nSo it is up to us to decide ultimately,\nwhether or not we want to use the specific\n\n323\n00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:13.590\nmanagement pack or once we figure out what\nmanagement pack, we want to be able to do.\n\n324\n00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.950\nWe'll go ahead,\nwe can enable this, set it up.\n\n325\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:21.480\nSpecify it is gonna be true and then turn\non whatever other options we may want.\n\n326\n00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.130\nAnd we're off to the races and\nwe're set to go, okay.\n\n327\n00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.660\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n328\n00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.730\nWe are not going to save our changes\n'cuz we don't care about that one.\n\n329\n00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.400\nAnd that's how we would\ncreate an override.\n\n330\n00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.280\nWe'll just keep going through that\ncreating as many overrides as we need.\n\n331\n00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.392\n&gt;&gt; All right configuring overrides 101.\n\n332\n00:16:36.392 --> 00:16:37.569\nThank you so much, Adam,\n\n333\n00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:40.520\nfor showing us how to walk through\nthat step-by-step process.\n\n334\n00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.260\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n335\n00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:42.954\nBut stay tuned.\n\n336\n00:16:42.954 --> 00:16:45.224\nWe have more demonstrations\nheaded your way.\n\n337\n00:16:45.224 --> 00:16:46.590\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n338\n00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.230\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n339\n00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.298\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n340\n00:16:49.298 --> 00:16:51.968\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n341\n00:16:51.968 -->

00:00:10.590\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.880\n&gt;&gt; Welcome,\n\n5\n00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.120\nladies and gentlemen, to your Datacenter\nMonitoring with Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.968\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:24.430\nAnd in this episode, we'll be looking at\nSynthetic Transaction Web Monitoring.\n\n8\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.130\nWith us today, we have Mr Adam Gordon\nin studios to demonstrate this topic.\n\n9\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.390\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.950\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.670\n&gt;&gt; Very good, thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.780\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's quite a mouthful there,\nit's a lot.\n\n13\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.450\n&gt;&gt; And you got it out, and you did\na good job, so that is just, high five.\n\n14\n00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.101\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo, aah, [LAUGH] where's my hand?\n\n15\n00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:41.337\nThere it is.\n&gt;&gt; There we are, okay, awesome.\n\n16\n00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:43.921\nSo Cherokee did a great job,\nshe set us up, and\n\n17\n00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:47.250\nwe are gonna jump right in because\nthis is such a cool topic.\n\n18\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.240\nWe don't wanna waste any time\nshowing you how to do it.\n\n19\n00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.760\nWe're gonna talk about synthetic\ntransaction monitoring.\n\n20\n00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.290\nAnd I demoed and\n\n21\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.050\nkinda teased this a little bit in\nthe prior episodes when we talked about\n\n22\n00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.840\njust running through all the different\noptions for end to end service monitoring.\n\n23\n00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.034\nAnd we took a look at this kinda at\nthe very end, ran through the wizard,\n\n24\n00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:06.480\nshowed you almost everything.\n\n25\n00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.180\nIt's gonna repeat that pretty quickly.\n\n26\n00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.980\nBut then I specified that little check box\nthere in the corner that we're not gonna\n\n27\n00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.370\ncheck off and show you,\nthat's gonna be where the magic happens.\n\n28\n00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.919\nWe're gonna take a look at that right now,\nso we're-\n\n29\n00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:16.588\n&gt;&gt; We get to see magic?\n\n30\n00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:20.920\n&gt;&gt; We get to see magic, and at no point in\nany part of this demonstration do my hands\n\n31\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.140\never leave my body while we do magic,\nwhich is awesome.\n\n32\n00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.022\nCuz they always stay put, and therefore,\nI can do cool things like go up here, and\n\n33\n00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:35.319\nuse this right here to be able to make\nthis kind of stuff happen over there.\n\n34\n00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:36.526\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n35\n00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:39.655\nnow that everybody knows where we are,\nwhat we're doing, and is totally confused,\n\n36\n00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:41.350\nlet's actually go do something cool.\n\n37\n00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.150\nSo Web Application Transaction Monitoring,\n\n38\n00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.300\nwhat we're gonna do, come over here up\nunderneath our Management Pad Templates.\n\n39\n00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.200\nWe're going to right click,\ngoing to add our monitoring wizard.\n\n40\n00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.800\nWe're going to choose\nWeb Application Transaction Monitoring.\n\n41\n00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.310\nRemember, we talk about this as\nallowing us to create monitoring for\n\n42\n00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.000\na simple web app.\n\n43\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.060\nYou can see this down on the bottom,\nwe move the screen.\n\n44\n00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.440\nThere we go, thank you sir.\n\n45\n00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.184\nSo we can see this down here, right?\n\n46\n00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:08.962\nWe can use the web app recorder,\nthat's the magic we're gonna talk about at\n\n47\n00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.631\nthe end of the wizard to\nrecord a web browser session.\n\n48\n00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.257\nAnd then we can look at that, and\n\n49\n00:02:13.257 --> 00:02:16.998\nwe can actually see what's happening and\nunderstand the interaction and\n\n50\n00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:20.450\nsee what a typical user sees when\nthey interact with our web server.\n\n51\n00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.870\nThis is the really cool part because\nthis allows us to be able to\n\n52\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.670\ndecide how things are gonna happen, what's\ngonna happen, and all that kind of stuff.\n\n53\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.820\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\nclick here, we're gonna click Next.\n\n54\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.946\nWe have to now provide a name,\nso we'll put a name in here.\n\n55\n00:02:35.946 --> 00:02:41.686\nWe'll call this Test Web App, Monitor.\n\n56\n00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:45.124\nYeah, close enough.\n\n57\n00:02:45.124 --> 00:02:50.604\nAnd then select our management pack,\nwe'll do our default.\n\n58\n00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:54.154\nCome on, there we go,\ndo our default management pack.\n\n59\n00:02:54.154 --> 00:02:57.360\nAnd then we have to\nprovide our web address.\n\n60\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.250\nNow I've gone ahead, and\n\n61\n00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.090\nI've typed in this address already\ncuz it is a really long one.\n\n62\n00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.630\nJust go full screen, so we can see this.\n\n63\n00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.450\nWe're using this in the test environment.\n\n64\n00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.410\n&gt;&gt; You weren't lying.\n\n65\n00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.420\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; You weren't lying.\n\n66\n00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.620\n&gt;&gt; No, I wasn't lying,\nyou don't have to type that for real.\n\n67\n00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.125\nSo this, we're gonna go to the localhost,\nOps Manager, hashtag,\n\n68\n00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:19.348\ncuz we are paying homage to the absolute\ncraziness of social media, overview.\n\n69\n00:03:19.348 --> 00:03:22.520\nAnd then we're gonna do Microsoft.System\nMonitoring ViewFolder.Root.\n\n70\n00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.060\nThis is gonna allow us to do just some\nbasic monitoring against the local system\n\n71\n00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.000\nand understand it.\n\n72\n00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.260\nSo we're using this merely for\ntest purposes.\n\n73\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.754\nIn the real word, just let me\ncopy this while we are talking.\n\n74\n00:03:33.754 --> 00:03:38.715\nIn the real world, let me just\npaste while we're talking as well,\n\n75\n00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:45.330\nyou would wanna go ahead and you would\nwanna be able to actually use a website.\n\n76\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.750\nThat is going to, or\na web application, I should say,\n\n77\n00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.460\nagainst the website that you\nactually wanna monitor, right?\n\n78\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.200\nThis is us essentially just setting up a\nmonitor in a local system that we can use\n\n79\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.570\nto demo for you, but this is not what you\nwould necessarily do in the real world.\n\n80\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.970\nIn the real world, you would actually\ntarget your web application,\n\n81\n00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.490\nmeaning your front end web url.\n\n82\n00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.880\nAnd you would use that url here,\nwhatever it is,\n\n83\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.270\nto actually then run the test again.\n\n84\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.080\nSo we're gonna test this to\nmake sure the string works.\n\n85\n00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.536\nI've already tested it, so\nI know it's gonna work, right?\n\n86\n00:04:17.536 --> 00:04:21.260\nSo we're gonna just wait for this to come\nback, you'll see this takes a few seconds.\n\n87\n00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.818\nIt will then come back.\n\n88\n00:04:21.818 --> 00:04:24.960\nIt will show us just the output here.\n\n89\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.340\nShow us that we are successful.\n\n90\n00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.270\nYou can see it there.\n\n91\n00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.480\nBoy, that would've been so\nembarrassing if that came back.\n\n92\n00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.180\nAnd they're like, yeah,\n\n93\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.740\nwe're gonna show you, you tested it,\nboop, not gonna happen, right?\n\n94\n00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.603\nBut luckily-\n&gt;&gt; It happens sometimes.\n\n95\n00:04:35.603 --> 00:04:36.590\n&gt;&gt; It happens.\n\n96\n00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.080\nIt does, sometimes,\nmore often than we care to admit.\n\n97\n00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.230\nBut you'll see here we do, or\nwe are successful, you'll see.\n\n98\n00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.360\nAnd let's just zoom in or\ngo full screen, rather.\n\n99\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.870\nWe'll go back, we talked about response\ncodes in our earlier conversation,\n\n100\n00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.290\nearlier episode, where we did web\napplication availability monitoring.\n\n101\n00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.186\nAnd we talked about the different\nHTTP response codes, 200, 300, 400.\n\n102\n00:04:57.186 --> 00:04:59.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe custom codes that would be there.\n\n103\n00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.560\nSo you could see the response code 200\nsays, yep, essentially I found the page,\n\n104\n00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.870\nI was able to connect.\n\n105\n00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.110\nYou'll see DNS resolution time,\nabout 1.3 milliseconds,\n\n106\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.660\ntotal response time, about 7,\nalmost 8 milliseconds.\n\n107\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.740\nSo you could see here that we're\ngetting some general information.\n\n108\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.029\nNow the cool thing is,\nwe can go into details here.\n\n109\n00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:20.729\nWe'll just pull this off to the side, so\n\n110\n00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.560\nyou can kind of see what we're\ndoing while we're doing this.\n\n111\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.370\nSo I just went in, went to details.\n\n112\n00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.320\nI'm drilling down on this data,\n\n113\n00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.540\ngetting more response information back in\nterms of what it did and how it did it.\n\n114\n00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.310\nSo I can see the general information\non the response times, we see all that.\n\n115\n00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.800\nI can see the HTTP request, so\n\n116\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.110\nI can actually get request and\nthe code that was used.\n\n117\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.730\nThis is HTTP version 1.1,\nas opposed to 1.0.\n\n118\n00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.080\nSo I can see that here.\n\n119\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.660\nI can see the HTTP response\nthat's coming back.\n\n120\n00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.480\nThis is the actual code\nfrom the web server.\n\n121\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.520\nAnd this is what I'm seeing.\n\n122\n00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.240\nAnd it's telling me that\nI'm running IS version 8.5.\n\n123\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.730\nSo I'm running 2012 R2, for\ninstance, under the hood.\n\n124\n00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.830\nAnd it's giving me information,\nASP.net, which is what we\n\n125\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.620\nwould expect to see with Microsoft\ncertainly, but it's giving us information.\n\n126\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.140\nAlso day and time and\nthe size of the cache and\n\n127\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.500\nother stuff that may be valuable.\n\n128\n00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.540\nSo we're just recording\nall this just to set up\n\n129\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.230\nthe demonstration in the sense\nthat we did the test.\n\n130\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.370\nThis is just the data that comes back\nwith the test, but this is validating all\n\n131\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.810\nthe things that we need to understand and\nmake sure are there.\n\n132\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.130\nSo we always wanna take a look\nat the request details,\n\n133\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.720\nmake sure everything\nlooks the way it should.\n\n134\n00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.033\n&gt;&gt; It really is a lot of information.\n\n135\n00:06:27.033 --> 00:06:31.091\nAnd I know, Adam, you are very well versed\nin security, and we also need to take that\n\n136\n00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:33.664\ninto consideration when we\ndo have this [CROSSTALK]\n\n137\n00:06:33.664 --> 00:06:34.785\n&gt;&gt; We don't pay attention to that stuff.\n\n138\n00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:35.505\nThat's just a waste of time.\n\n139\n00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:36.107\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n140\n00:06:36.107 --> 00:06:37.768\n&gt;&gt; Who cares about security?\n\n141\n00:06:37.768 --> 00:06:39.351\nThat's not important.\nCherokee raises a really [CROSSTALK]\n\n142\n00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:40.933\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you're showing me all this\n\n143\n00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:43.290\ninformation in one stop shop,\nand it's like wow.\n\n144\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.060\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee raises a really important\npoint, which is security is so\n\n145\n00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.400\nimportant in everything we do.\n\n146\n00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.764\nWe talk a lot about it, and\n\n147\n00:06:48.764 --> 00:06:51.690\nit is certainly one of the areas\nI do a lot of work in.\n\n148\n00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.310\nI'm passionate about it,\nas I know many of you are.\n\n149\n00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.220\nAnd you know how important it is to make\nsure that we safeguard this information.\n\n150\n00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.060\nSome of the stuff that we were just\nshowing, version number, for instance,\n\n151\n00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.940\nof what operating system is running, can\nbe extrapolated from understanding what\n\n152\n00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.170\nversion of web services are being\npresented, as I explained, right?\n\n153\n00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.580\nAnd so those kind of things definitely\ncould be problematic in the wrong hands,\n\n154\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.490\nand Cherokee's right to stop us here for\na second and say, hey wait a second.\n\n155\n00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.000\nIs there some concern here?\n\n156\n00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.970\nShould we be keeping track of this stuff?\n\n157\n00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.860\nDo we have to do something\nto deal with it?\n\n158\n00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.270\nRemember that this information\nis coming back to us\n\n159\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.880\nright now in a kind of secure environment,\nright?\n\n160\n00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.014\nWe're in the land behind our firewalls, so\n\n161\n00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:29.792\nlet's just take a look at\na little diagram here, right?\n\n162\n00:07:29.792 --> 00:07:32.020\nWe're sitting here, right?\n\n163\n00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.700\nAnd we're behind this firewall, imagine\nthis as our external entity, our perimeter\n\n164\n00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.730\nof defense, if you will, our outer area\nof our defense and death architecture.\n\n165\n00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.190\nAll the stuff we're doing is taking place\nback in this area, over here to the right,\n\n166\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.800\nwe're interacting with\nthe ops manager database.\n\n167\n00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.370\nWe have our agent managed\nservers down here.\n\n168\n00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.541\nWe have our agent managed infrastructure,\nI should say.\n\n169\n00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:57.636\nWe have our management servers here,\n\n170\n00:07:57.636 --> 00:08:00.917\nall the stuff we're doing is\ntaking place inside the land.\n\n171\n00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:04.186\nHopefully, and again,\neverything is relative, of course.\n\n172\n00:08:04.186 --> 00:08:08.326\nBut hopefully behind the protection\nperimeter, that is deep enough,\n\n173\n00:08:08.326 --> 00:08:13.225\nwide enough, broad enough, and architected\nsufficiently and strongly enough and\n\n174\n00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:17.641\nhardened enough to be able to withstand\ninbound detached from the outside so\n\n175\n00:08:17.641 --> 00:08:20.860\nwe hope this data would\nnot see the light of day.\n\n176\n00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.840\nI would be certainly concerned about\nthe fact that data's out there but\n\n177\n00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.248\nit's sitting in our databases.\n\n178\n00:08:26.248 --> 00:08:28.700\nWe would wanna make sure\nthat we are taking steps\n\n179\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.650\nto prevent physical\naccess to the database.\n\n180\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.605\nIt's standard stuff we would normally do,\nI don't let on access.\n\n181\n00:08:34.605 --> 00:08:37.955\nUnauthorized users without\nproper access control oversight.\n\n182\n00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:41.977\nGet into these systems remotely and/or\nphysically by walking in the data center,\n\n183\n00:08:41.977 --> 00:08:45.025\ninteracting with something that\nthey're not supposed to do,\n\n184\n00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.108\nlet's make sure we encrypt that traffic.\n\n185\n00:08:47.108 --> 00:08:49.442\nIf it is flowing across the wire.\n\n186\n00:08:49.442 --> 00:08:53.732\nWe didn't choose HTTPS in the demo here,\nbut if we were using HTTPS,\n\n187\n00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:57.082\nwe'd be securing that transactional\ndata cuz we would obviously,\n\n188\n00:08:57.082 --> 00:09:01.552\nhopefully benefit from the use of SSLTLS\nto be able to encrypt that string.\n\n189\n00:09:01.552 --> 00:09:04.360\nSo there are definitely some\nconsiderations and concerns,\n\n190\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.397\nas Cherokee is reminding us of\nthat we'd wanna think about here.\n\n191\n00:09:07.397 --> 00:09:10.111\nBut I think that we're probably okay for\nthe moment,\n\n192\n00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:14.810\nin the sense that this is happening inside\nright now, and we're monitoring inside.\n\n193\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.030\nWe're gonna use a watcher node\nthat is inside right now, so\n\n194\n00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.200\nwe're gonna be behind our firewalls.\n\n195\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.790\nWe're not gonna be as concerned if,\nas we talked about,\n\n196\n00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.690\nwith global service monitoring, one of our\nother episodes and our demonstrations.\n\n197\n00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.100\nIf we were gonna be doing\noutside in monitoring\n\n198\n00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.030\nwhere we have watcher nodes through the\nglobal service monitor foundation that's\n\n199\n00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.320\navailable through Azure that we can use,\nremember, set up System Center, buy it,\n\n200\n00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.350\nlicense it with Enterprise.\n\n201\n00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.720\nWith an EA with software insurance and\nuse the Azure fabric, and we actually get\n\n202\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.190\naccess to the global service monitoring\nWe can use those external watcher nodes.\n\n203\n00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.510\nThose data center watcher nodes\nof Microsoft maintenance.\n\n204\n00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.590\nBut keep in mind,\nthose are insecure data centers.\n\n205\n00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.890\nAcross the use of Fabric,\nthat communication will be secure.\n\n206\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.920\nThose data center and\npoint monitoring agents are physically and\n\n207\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.230\nlogically protected.\n\n208\n00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.310\nSo we're seeing the extension\nof that protection perimeter.\n\n209\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.970\nWe're just pushing it out into the cloud.\n\n210\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.280\nSo we hope that all of that\nobviously still gonna be in place.\n\n211\n00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.280\nAnd it's important to call that out and\nremind ourselves of that.\n\n212\n00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.639\nNever a bad time to think about security\nas we often say and the earlier you do so,\n\n213\n00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:21.398\nthe less likely it is you're gonna\nhave to make up for lost time and\n\n214\n00:10:21.398 --> 00:10:23.832\nopportunity where you have to go back and\nfix something.\n\n215\n00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:26.975\nSo it's always good to think about that so\nanother high five.\n\n216\n00:10:26.975 --> 00:10:29.104\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n217\n00:10:29.104 --> 00:10:30.398\n&gt;&gt; All right, there you go.\n\n218\n00:10:30.398 --> 00:10:31.263\nGot to be quick to do those high fives.\n\n219\n00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:32.273\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n220\n00:10:32.273 --> 00:10:34.600\n&gt;&gt; So what we're gonna do\nis just continue on here.\n\n221\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.650\nSo we're gonna go ahead.\n\n222\n00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.649\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n223\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.180\nJust a second to do that.\n\n224\n00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.660\nWe're then gonna choose our watcher node.\n\n225\n00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.810\nYou heard me just referring to this.\n\n226\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.770\nIf you haven't seen the other episodes\nwe've done on watcher node, a watcher node\n\n227\n00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.400\nis just the endpoint that we're gonna use\nwith the Microsoft Monitoring Agent Audit\n\n228\n00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.030\nthat's gonna be used to\ndo the monitoring for us.\n\n229\n00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.660\nIn this case, it's gonna be\none of our management servers.\n\n230\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.900\nSo you can see it's selected there.\n\n231\n00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.110\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna check this off.\n\n232\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.830\nWe have to specify how often\nwe wanna run the query.\n\n233\n00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.980\nEvery two minutes or\nwhatever we decide to do.\n\n234\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.864\nWe'll leave it there at\ntwo minutes it's fine.\n\n235\n00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:06.475\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click Next.\n\n236\n00:11:06.475 --> 00:11:08.125\nAnd then, what we're gonna do,\ncan we go back so\n\n237\n00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:10.435\nwe need to see on full screen here,\nthis part.\n\n238\n00:11:10.435 --> 00:11:11.627\nSo we're now gonna go in.\n\n239\n00:11:11.627 --> 00:11:15.555\nWe're gonna check off configure\nadvanced monitoring or\n\n240\n00:11:15.555 --> 00:11:20.230\nrecorded browser sessions, the box that I\ntalked about that we're gonna select here,\n\n241\n00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.418\nlet's move this over for\njust a sec so you can see this.\n\n242\n00:11:23.418 --> 00:11:26.740\nSo we're gonna check this off and\nyou'll notice here under custom actions,\n\n243\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.810\nafter we get done, we can record\nthe browser session from out here.\n\n244\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.152\nWe have an action that\nwill allow us to do this.\n\n245\n00:11:32.152 --> 00:11:34.570\nWe're gonna select this so\nit's gonna pop up for\n\n246\n00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.920\nus immediately instead of us having\nto go out and do it separately.\n\n247\n00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.660\nYou can do it either way.\n\n248\n00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.555\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n249\n00:11:38.555 --> 00:11:39.330\nSo we're gonna go ahead.\n\n250\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.160\nWe're gonna click Create,\ngive that a moment.\n\n251\n00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.290\nOnce that does happen we're gonna open up\nthe editor screen here we're gonna then be\n\n252\n00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.370\nable to program in some things so we'll\ngive this just a moment to finish up.\n\n253\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:56.330\nOnce we have done this we then will\nbe able to set up our request or\n\n254\n00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.490\nin the request detail page with\nthe editor set up exactly what we want to\n\n255\n00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.340\nhave happen.\n\n256\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.585\nAnd this is gonna look\nsomewhat familiar to you.\n\n257\n00:12:02.585 --> 00:12:06.230\nBased on what we've taken a look\nat in some of the other episodes,\n\n258\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.930\nwhen we did demos of this already.\n\n259\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.560\nWe took a look at getting in and\ntaking a look at the request details,\n\n260\n00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.600\nthe status codes, greater than or\nequal to, things of that nature.\n\n261\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.280\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n262\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.815\nSo we're gonna go in, we have our\nstatus code greater than or equal to,\n\n263\n00:12:18.815 --> 00:12:19.633\nlet's say, 400.\n\n264\n00:12:19.633 --> 00:12:21.929\nWe talked about content\nmatch with a string.\n\n265\n00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:25.220\nWe talked about response time in so\nmany seconds.\n\n266\n00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.690\nSo we can go in, say responds time is\nequal to let's say, or greater than or\n\n267\n00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:30.550\nless than.\n\n268\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:36.410\nSo you know if it's greater than or\nequal to let's say one, or\n\n269\n00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:41.140\nlet's say two seconds,\nthen we want to monitor for that.\n\n270\n00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.700\nSo we can go in,\nwe can decide what we're going to do.\n\n271\n00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.440\nWe see greater than or\nequal to status code 400.\n\n272\n00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.060\nThat'll be something in\nthe error area most likely,\n\n273\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.038\nthose status codes up above 400\ntypically have to do with errors.\n\n274\n00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:54.290\nSo we'll wanna see if there's\nany errors that come back,\n\n275\n00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.840\ncuz we're interacting here.\n\n276\n00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.380\nSo we'd be doing that.\n\n277\n00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.130\nNotice down here,\n\n278\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.880\nstop processing the subsequent\nrequest if an error criteria is met.\n\n279\n00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.770\nMeaning if we find an error we could\nactually then stop processing, and\n\n280\n00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.930\nwe can just essentially at that\npoint stop and do something, or\n\n281\n00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.850\nnot do something depending\non what we wanna do.\n\n282\n00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.260\nSo we have some different options here.\n\n283\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:19.890\nWe'll go ahead and we will scroll down\nto show you some more of this down here.\n\n284\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.680\nWe also have settings and\nother entries that are for warning.\n\n285\n00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.760\nWe saw this at our other demo as well.\n\n286\n00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.960\nWe're not gonna bother with right now but\nyou get the general idea.\n\n287\n00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.300\nSo then, once we've done this, we can\nverify our criteria by hitting Verify.\n\n288\n00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.769\nSo let's go in and verify.\n\n289\n00:13:36.219 --> 00:13:37.773\nGive this a second.\n\n290\n00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:48.546\nSays changes verified and\napplied to selected requests.\n\n291\n00:13:48.546 --> 00:13:51.211\nSo in other words,\nyes we are able to verify that.\n\n292\n00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:57.731\nWe'll go ahead, we'll apply, give that\njust a moment to do its job and then\n\n293\n00:14:01.202 --> 00:14:05.218\nYou'll see web application\ndata imported successfully.\n\n294\n00:14:05.218 --> 00:14:06.750\nLet me actually just go full screen here.\n\n295\n00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.000\nCan we go full screen?\n\n296\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.890\nWe need to be able to see\nthe rest of the console area and\n\n297\n00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:11.630\nwhat's going on, on the right.\n\n298\n00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.220\nSo we have that and\nwe've actually done that now.\n\n299\n00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.420\nSo now, we come over here,\nand we actually run our test.\n\n300\n00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.840\nWe're gonna go out and test this and\nsee what's gonna happen.\n\n301\n00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.652\nSo let's run our test, click there.\n\n302\n00:14:22.652 --> 00:14:27.410\nWe're gonna test the web app\nresponse data against this.\n\n303\n00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.060\nCan see right here, got our information.\n\n304\n00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:35.380\nIt ran successfully, transaction\nresponse time, about 6.9 milliseconds,\n\n305\n00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.440\nso less than our 2 second boundary or\nThreshold we said,\n\n306\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.210\nno error codes, or no response codes\nabove 400 that indicate errors.\n\n307\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.970\nSo we could see that we\nget back this information.\n\n308\n00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.170\nIf we click on Total Data, for instance,\n\n309\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:52.960\nwe could see the aggregated response DNS\nresolution and content size information.\n\n310\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.220\nSo we could see this is detailed\ninformation about what's there.\n\n311\n00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.490\nIf we look here, just click here,\n\n312\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.710\nwe can see that we may have data in some\nof these folders under response time.\n\n313\n00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.990\nSee 0 milliseconds.\n\n314\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.068\nEssentially it was instantaneous\ncause it's running on the local host.\n\n315\n00:15:08.068 --> 00:15:10.511\nSo we're kinda skewing\nthe results a little bit here,\n\n316\n00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:12.805\ncuz we're doing a test\nagainst the local machine.\n\n317\n00:15:12.805 --> 00:15:14.699\nIn the real world if you were doing\nthis out against a remote machine,\n\n318\n00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:16.803\nwe would actually get response times\nthat are higher than 0 milliseconds.\n\n319\n00:15:16.803 --> 00:15:18.415\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n320\n00:15:18.415 --> 00:15:22.540\n&gt;&gt; But you'll close your eyes and\npretend that it says 10 and not 0.\n\n321\n00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.490\nCuz it would have taken at least that\nlong to go out to a website somewhere\n\n322\n00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:26.160\nelse and come back.\n\n323\n00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.360\nSo you can see that.\n\n324\n00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.840\nWe also have links here.\n\n325\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.110\nAnd if we any information about the links,\n\n326\n00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.090\nwe'll be able to see\nthat information as well.\n\n327\n00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.340\nSo we were able to run\nour test successfully.\n\n328\n00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:41.870\nWe can view test results underneath here\nas you can see, we can view test results,\n\n329\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.570\nyou saw me just do that,\nwe also can view full results.\n\n330\n00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.300\nLet's go take a look, this is kinda cool.\n\n331\n00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.370\nWe got a little bit of a fuller\nread on the data here, so\n\n332\n00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.940\nwe actually can now see what we're doing,\nor see all that information.\n\n333\n00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.176\nWe'll go and we'll actually take a look.\n\n334\n00:15:56.176 --> 00:16:00.510\nSo you could see here, just make this\nfull screen so you can see this.\n\n335\n00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.332\nWe have all of our formatted data,\nwe also have our So\n\n336\n00:16:03.332 --> 00:16:07.004\nif we did something like This is\nlike looking at the matrix, right?\n\n337\n00:16:07.004 --> 00:16:07.683\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm\n\n338\n00:16:07.683 --> 00:16:10.370\njust getting bleary-eyed\nkinda just watching it.\n\n339\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.320\nBut you can see,\nwe do get the raw data back.\n\n340\n00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.802\nWe get the formatted\nversion of it as well.\n\n341\n00:16:13.802 --> 00:16:16.516\nAnd again, a little bit more impressive.\n\n342\n00:16:16.516 --> 00:16:20.207\nWhen we're going out to a live website\nremote from somewhere not locally,\n\n343\n00:16:20.207 --> 00:16:21.856\ninternally on the same machine.\n\n344\n00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.492\nLooking at a directory.\n\n345\n00:16:23.492 --> 00:16:25.710\nBut we actually go out to a live website.\n\n346\n00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.690\nWe hit that from outside and we see it.\n\n347\n00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.670\nThis would have a lot more data and\n\n348\n00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.270\nthere would be a lot more substance to\nthis full report that we're looking at.\n\n349\n00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.783\nBut it is kind of nice because\nit does give us a lot detail.\n\n350\n00:16:35.783 --> 00:16:39.215\nNow keep in mind,\na lot of this data may be valuable not so\n\n351\n00:16:39.215 --> 00:16:41.128\nmuch to us as administrators.\n\n352\n00:16:41.128 --> 00:16:44.505\nBut more to app dev people that are doing\ndevelopment work that are looking to\n\n353\n00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:45.789\noptimize the application.\n\n354\n00:16:45.789 --> 00:16:49.046\nLooking for response information,\nlooking for potential errors or\n\n355\n00:16:49.046 --> 00:16:50.121\nconcerns in the code.\n\n356\n00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:53.440\nAnd we would be sharing this information\nwith them potentially, right?\n\n357\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.830\nBecause this is going to be important for\nthem.\n\n358\n00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:59.020\nWhen I say them I mean the developers and\nthe administrators both,\n\n359\n00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.280\nto be able to see.\n\n360\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.659\nSo it's not just one [CROSSTALK] group or\none entity that's gonna use this, right.\n\n361\n00:17:05.659 --> 00:17:08.359\nIt's gonna obviously be both,\nso we want to think about that.\n\n362\n00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.580\nNow, we could also go out\nunder web request here, right.\n\n363\n00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.580\nAnd you'll see we could go in and\nstart a capture.\n\n364\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.140\nLet's just go in and do this just to\nshow you, talk about the capture here.\n\n365\n00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.480\nThis is essentially a macro recorder.\n\n366\n00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.080\nWe're going out and we're gonna start\ncapturing data about how we interact\n\n367\n00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.600\nwith this website and everything.\n\n368\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.694\nWe're gonna record all\nthat information and\n\n369\n00:17:28.694 --> 00:17:31.401\nbe able to take apart all that\ninformation and examine it.\n\n370\n00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:33.198\nNow, we don't really have a live website,\nso\n\n371\n00:17:33.198 --> 00:17:34.912\nI'm not gonna really be\nable to go very far.\n\n372\n00:17:34.912 --> 00:17:38.888\nBut the idea would be that we could\nactually go in, capture all of this.\n\n373\n00:17:38.888 --> 00:17:40.862\nSo if we did something like\n\n374\n00:17:46.551 --> 00:17:49.690\nMicrosoft.com, right, or something.\n\n375\n00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:57.635\n[COUGH] And we went through and\nwe clicked through.\n\n376\n00:17:57.635 --> 00:18:01.366\nWanna buy a Surface Pro 4?\n\n377\n00:18:01.366 --> 00:18:01.883\n&gt;&gt; Sure, why not?\n\n378\n00:18:01.883 --> 00:18:04.120\n&gt;&gt; We can go in and do one of those.\n\n379\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.427\nWe got Don's credit card, we could\nprobably make a purchase right now, right?\n\n380\n00:18:06.427 --> 00:18:11.085\nSo we could go ahead and grab something,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n381\n00:18:11.085 --> 00:18:14.310\nLooks like they're running a special too,\n100 bucks off.\n\n382\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.217\nSo we could do all this,\nwhen we are done with all this,\n\n383\n00:18:19.217 --> 00:18:22.974\nwe could stop our captures as you can see.\n\n384\n00:18:22.974 --> 00:18:26.195\nAnd once we've done the capture,\nwe then can go in.\n\n385\n00:18:26.195 --> 00:18:28.807\nAnd we can examine data\nthat may come back and\n\n386\n00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:31.923\nhelp us to even better\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n387\n00:18:31.923 --> 00:18:36.910\nAnd we can see more information and\na variety of things can be done with that.\n\n388\n00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.480\nWe didn't really go out\nto the actual website.\n\n389\n00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.940\nWe just kind of showed you\nthe thought process of starting and\n\n390\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.170\nstopping a capture.\n\n391\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.862\nBut the idea is that we can then use that\ndata to help us better understand what\n\n392\n00:18:45.862 --> 00:18:47.368\nthe user experience would be.\n\n393\n00:18:47.368 --> 00:18:49.416\nHey, when I connect,\nI get this or I get that.\n\n394\n00:18:49.416 --> 00:18:50.357\n&gt;&gt; What happens.\n\n395\n00:18:50.357 --> 00:18:53.060\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Things like that.\n\n396\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.820\nSo, just to keep that in mind.\n\n397\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.860\nWe also have Configure settings here.\n\n398\n00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.430\nSo if we wanna go into the web app,\n\n399\n00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.250\njust bring this over real\nquick while we're here.\n\n400\n00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.400\nAnd we can go in and we can see\nthe name of the web app monitor.\n\n401\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.304\nThis is the monitor itself\nthat we're setting up right.\n\n402\n00:19:06.304 --> 00:19:09.661\nSo we can go in, specify the watcher node.\n\n403\n00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:12.047\nMaybe make changes any\nperformance criteria,\n\n404\n00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:14.700\nany performance counters\nthat we wanna grab.\n\n405\n00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.650\nWe could actually take\na look at all this and\n\n406\n00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.935\ngo deeper into the configuration\nof the monitor.\n\n407\n00:19:18.935 --> 00:19:23.498\nAnd actually interact with that if\nwe need to change it in some way or\n\n408\n00:19:23.498 --> 00:19:26.762\ndo something like that,\nwe actually can go in.\n\n409\n00:19:26.762 --> 00:19:29.490\nAnd we can get information, right.\n\n410\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:35.129\nAnd we did talk about it,\ndid take a look at our full results.\n\n411\n00:19:35.129 --> 00:19:38.218\nAnd just the impact of what these\nwould be in terms of the data and\n\n412\n00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:39.866\nall the stuff we're looking at.\n\n413\n00:19:39.866 --> 00:19:42.560\nI think we already went through and\ntook a look at all this.\n\n414\n00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.242\nSo we do have a lot of information\nhere that we can interact with.\n\n415\n00:19:46.242 --> 00:19:50.270\nA lot of stuff that may be valuable\nto us that we wanna think about.\n\n416\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.760\nAnd potentially wanna be able to use or\nutilize.\n\n417\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.590\nWe'll close out of that real quick, but\n\n418\n00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:00.450\nyou can see here that once we have\nour monitors set up, we can go in.\n\n419\n00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.036\nAnd we can then use this as often\nas necessary to run the tests and\n\n420\n00:20:05.036 --> 00:20:08.520\nor, if necessary as I showed you,\nrecord a browser session.\n\n421\n00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.860\nLet's just show you what\nthe Record Browser Session looks like.\n\n422\n00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.400\nWhen you launch the wizard from outside,\nyou'll see here we can go in.\n\n423\n00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.920\nYou'll name your web app,\nright, so whatever it is.\n\n424\n00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.754\nChoose our Management Pack.\n\n425\n00:20:24.294 --> 00:20:27.230\nThere we go.\n\n426\n00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.000\nThen start our capture, right,\n\n427\n00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.338\nso recording that session\nlike we were just doing.\n\n428\n00:20:31.338 --> 00:20:37.714\nLet's start our capture one more time.\n\n429\n00:20:37.714 --> 00:20:42.459\n[NOISE]\nAnd\n\n430\n00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.476\nHold on, let me get out.\n\n431\n00:20:49.476 --> 00:20:51.567\nTry that one more, there we go,\n\n432\n00:20:51.567 --> 00:20:56.296\njust got to have a back space key that\nworks the right way for that to work.\n\n433\n00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:58.400\nAll right so\nlet me try that one more time.\n\n434\n00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.696\nSo if we go out and,\nI'll do something like that,\n\n435\n00:21:00.696 --> 00:21:02.292\nthat should be there from before.\n\n436\n00:21:02.292 --> 00:21:07.061\nAll right so we'll just click\nback through there one more time.\n\n437\n00:21:19.952 --> 00:21:22.970\nWe could review something like that,\nwhatever the case might be.\n\n438\n00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:23.854\n&gt;&gt; Just generating that traffic and\nresponses.\n\n439\n00:21:23.854 --> 00:21:25.752\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just whatever the case may be.\n\n440\n00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:26.370\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n441\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.398\nAll right, so\nthen when we've done all that,\n\n442\n00:21:28.398 --> 00:21:32.040\nyou see it just takes us back to the same\nplace if you launch it from outside.\n\n443\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.901\nWe can see and take a look at.\n\n444\n00:21:34.901 --> 00:21:35.473\nWe finish the capture.\n\n445\n00:21:35.473 --> 00:21:39.485\nAnd then at that point we don't have cuz\nwe're not going to the site that's set up\n\n446\n00:21:39.485 --> 00:21:40.375\nfor monitoring.\n\n447\n00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:42.390\nRemember when we do the capture this way.\n\n448\n00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.780\nWe're not really going to the real site\nwe've programmed the web app monitor for.\n\n449\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.050\nSo I'm not really gathering any data.\n\n450\n00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.175\nNo requests, groups, all that information.\n\n451\n00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:50.969\nI'm not seeing that.\n\n452\n00:21:50.969 --> 00:21:53.425\nBut In the real world if I\nwas actually doing this,\n\n453\n00:21:53.425 --> 00:21:55.775\nthen what I would see is\nI would see the request.\n\n454\n00:21:55.775 --> 00:21:59.870\nI'd be able to see the tracking\nof all that information.\n\n455\n00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.394\nAnd be able to interact with it\nagainst the real site that I've set up\n\n456\n00:22:02.394 --> 00:22:03.207\nthe monitoring for.\n\n457\n00:22:03.207 --> 00:22:07.582\nI'm just using essentially a proxy site to\nshow you the idea of starting the monitor.\n\n458\n00:22:07.582 --> 00:22:10.210\nJust so you could see what\nthe capture would look like.\n\n459\n00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.795\nBut you'll see if we\nlaunch it from outside,\n\n460\n00:22:11.795 --> 00:22:13.500\nit's essentially done the same way.\n\n461\n00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.417\nTakes us back to the same place,\nwe run the capture and\n\n462\n00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:17.688\nthen we're able to view the results\nwhen we're done, right.\n\n463\n00:22:17.688 --> 00:22:19.863\nSo that's what we just\nwanted to show you quickly.\n\n464\n00:22:19.863 --> 00:22:24.293\nJust let me not save our changes there and\njust come back out to our default, or\n\n465\n00:22:24.293 --> 00:22:26.010\nrather, our standard view.\n\n466\n00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.078\nWe see our Web App Monitor.\n\n467\n00:22:27.078 --> 00:22:29.360\nNow we could just stack these monitors up.\n\n468\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.220\nObviously name them in a way that makes\nsense for you so that you can see them.\n\n469\n00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.210\nAnd then we're able to do our\nend-to-end service monitoring.\n\n470\n00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:40.602\nBut in this particular case we're focusing\non the synthetic transaction monitoring.\n\n471\n00:22:40.602 --> 00:22:42.648\nOr ability to set up a web app monitor and\n\n472\n00:22:42.648 --> 00:22:46.809\nto then look at the interaction with\nthe website from the user's perspective.\n\n473\n00:22:46.809 --> 00:22:50.542\nAnd test the response time and\nall the different things that go with it.\n\n474\n00:22:50.542 --> 00:22:53.300\n&gt;&gt; There are a lot of different monitoring\ncapabilities within this particular\n\n475\n00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.020\nutility so thank you for\ntaking the time to show us that.\n\n476\n00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.290\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen for\njoining us on this wonderful day.\n\n477\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.405\nBut stay tuned we do have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n478\n00:23:01.405 --> 00:23:02.645\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n479\n00:23:02.645 --> 00:23:04.112\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n480\n00:23:04.112 --> 00:23:05.869\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam

00:00:08.605\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:10.925\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:12.383\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:14.308\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.308 --> 00:00:16.970\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.790\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, we are back.\n\n9\n00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.180\nThat's right, with more on our data center\nmonitoring with Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n10\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.670\nAnd joining us in the studio again today\nis our good friend and mentor, Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.790\nAdam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.710\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.150\nWe're glad to have you again.\n\n14\n00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.270\n&gt;&gt; How do, how do, how do?\n\n15\n00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.245\nOr as we say in SQL Server Reporting\nServices, how do with a query?\n\n16\n00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:38.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n17\n00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:39.975\nwe're gonna talk about reporting\nservices a little bit.\n\n18\n00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.538\nAnd we're gonna speak in\nthis particular episode, and\n\n19\n00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:44.509\nprobably at least one more after this one.\n\n20\n00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:46.700\nJust to show you some of\nthe stuff we're gonna talk about.\n\n21\n00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.120\nTalk a bit about how to configure and\n\n22\n00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.050\nmanage reporting in\nthe ops manager console.\n\n23\n00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.986\nYour reporting is gonna be unfortunately\nsometimes seen as an afterthought.\n\n24\n00:00:55.986 --> 00:00:59.490\nMeaning, we setup SCOM,\nwe've got all that stuff going on, but\n\n25\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.990\nthen we got to remember and\nremind ourselves of the fact.\n\n26\n00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.720\nLet me just show you the picture we've\nbeen referring to from time to time,\n\n27\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.610\nwe can take a look.\n\n28\n00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.389\nWe have to remind ourselves of the fact\nthat we have our reporting server kind of\n\n29\n00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:13.220\nlonely, sitting out here on the side,\nall on its own.\n\n30\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.310\nJust waiting for\nus to pay attention to it.\n\n31\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.740\nIt just hangs out there.\n\n32\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.620\nAnd what we need to remember is we install\nthe SSRS SQL server reporting services\n\n33\n00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.180\nrole onto a management server separate\nfrom the management server pool.\n\n34\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.210\nDown here at the resource\npool we talked about.\n\n35\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.800\nOnce we instantiated that\nrole the ability to draw data\n\n36\n00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.150\nthrough queries out of the data\nwarehouse database sitting over here.\n\n37\n00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.120\nAnd then we have the ability\nwith the importation.\n\n38\n00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.720\nThat is the new phrase of the day.\n\n39\n00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.040\nImportation.\n\n40\n00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.880\nNot important, not importing,\nbut importation.\n\n41\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.930\nThe importation of the management packs\nwhich we have talked about extensively\n\n42\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.190\nin prior episodes.\n\n43\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.910\nWe'll talk about some more when we talk\nabout how to actually do customization\n\n44\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.840\nof management packs, upcoming episode.\n\n45\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.570\nWanna make sure you take some time,\ncheck that out at some point.\n\n46\n00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.980\nWe'll teach you how to write management\npacks from the ground up, it's very cool.\n\n47\n00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.116\nDan is gonna sharpen up his quill and\nhis, do you ever write with a quill,\n\n48\n00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:09.930\nby the way?\n\n49\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.590\n&gt;&gt; I have, actually.\n\n50\n00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.435\n&gt;&gt; With actually ink wells.\n\n51\n00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:12.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The whole nine yards.\n\n52\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.680\nThat's kinda cool.\n\n53\n00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I used to do calligraphy\nwhen I was a kid, yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.020\n&gt;&gt; Did you really?\n\n55\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.650\nWell, you draw, so I can imagine that\nwould probably be something you would do.\n\n56\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.820\nBut it is kinda cool, right?\n\n57\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Dip the quill in the ink, and then you.\n\n58\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.960\nBut then you think about\nthe poor little porcupine or\n\n59\n00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.870\npoor bird that they got it from,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n60\n00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.810\nAnd then you're like-\n&gt;&gt; They had it coming,\n\n61\n00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.010\nthat's all I'm gonna say [LAUGH].\n\n62\n00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, wrong time, wrong place,\nthat's right it's just what you would say.\n\n63\n00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n64\n00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.440\nwhen you think about the reporting\nservices role, we're really\n\n65\n00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.585\nthinking about bringing together\nseveral different things, streams.\n\n66\n00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:42.215\nAnd ideas all together in one place.\n\n67\n00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:44.819\nAnd we have to do all that and\ndo it in the right way so\n\n68\n00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.225\nthat when we import the management packs,\nwe stack those reports up in the console.\n\n69\n00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:50.305\nWe have access to them.\n\n70\n00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:53.005\nWe're gonna show you where they are and\nhow that works.\n\n71\n00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:54.732\nBut we're talking about this.\n\n72\n00:02:54.732 --> 00:02:59.212\nWe're then gonna be able to use them\nto extract, and to analyze, and\n\n73\n00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.162\nto delve into that information.\n\n74\n00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:06.420\nUsing business intelligence, using data\nanalytics, using data visualization.\n\n75\n00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.510\nAnd all the other key terms and\ntechniques and technologies\n\n76\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.720\nthat we would throw at this problem,\nto really make this data come to life.\n\n77\n00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.710\nYou know the value, of a product like\nSCOM is not in just the collection and\n\n78\n00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.910\narchiving, warehousing of that data.\n\n79\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.050\nThat's important, but\nthat's just the nuts and bolts mechanics.\n\n80\n00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.930\nThe real value of this tool is the ability\nto take that data, turn it around and\n\n81\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.550\nanalyze it from different perspectives.\n\n82\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.530\nAnd then extract meaning from that data.\n\n83\n00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.090\nThat's really where we derive and\nunderstand value.\n\n84\n00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.438\nAnd so that's what we're\ngonna be talking about here.\n\n85\n00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:41.370\nManagement packs, will have reports\nincluded with them when we bring them in.\n\n86\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.010\nSo as we import management packs or\n\n87\n00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.690\nwe create management packs as\na vendor we add reports in.\n\n88\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.550\nReports are essentially just\npredetermined, predefined SQL queries.\n\n89\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.970\nSQL Structured Query Language queries.\n\n90\n00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.195\nWe gotta be specific when we say SQL cuz\nMicrosoft does such a good job of taking\n\n91\n00:03:58.195 --> 00:04:02.300\nthe concept of the term and\nmarketing the product against it, right?\n\n92\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.630\nSo when we talk about SQL databases,\n\n93\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.620\nwe're talking about Microsoft\ndatabase product name.\n\n94\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.620\nBut when we're talking about using Query\nlanguage, we have to be specific that\n\n95\n00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.732\nwe're talking about either SQL or\nTransact-SQL, T-SQL.\n\n96\n00:04:15.732 --> 00:04:18.370\nMaybe WQL, the WMI Query language,\n\n97\n00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.990\nthere's different implementations of\nquerying depending on what we're doing.\n\n98\n00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.520\nBut we're talking about the ability to be\nable draw data out of those databases.\n\n99\n00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.260\nSpecifically, the warehouse database\nthrough queries and then run them and\n\n100\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.350\ndisplay them in reports.\n\n101\n00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.330\nThat's really what reports allow us to\ndo and through the ops manager console.\n\n102\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.880\nAllow us to interact with them.\n\n103\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.450\nThe nice thing about reports\nare they could be scheduled for\n\n104\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.320\nboth execution, and delivery.\n\n105\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.380\nSo could say as a task essentially, hey at\ntwo in the morning, run this report, and\n\n106\n00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.020\nthen email it out to me.\n\n107\n00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.870\nOr a console message me or\nSMS or whatever the case may be.\n\n108\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.400\nWell, different options we'll\ntalk about what they are.\n\n109\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.230\nAnd we can use\na Windows File Share to dump\n\n110\n00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.390\nthe report into [INAUDIBLE] go\ngraph it off the network somewhere.\n\n111\n00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.240\nAt a certain point in time we can use\nwhat's called the null delivery provider.\n\n112\n00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.740\nWe can run the, I want to say SMS,\nwe can run the SSRS report.\n\n113\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.829\nAnd then we can keep it\ncached in the SSRS server.\n\n114\n00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.290\nAnd we can just pull it down when needed.\n\n115\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.430\nSo it kinda sits there waiting for us.\n\n116\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.790\nWe can use email, as I said.\n\n117\n00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.266\nSo we can have pre-determined and\n\n118\n00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:21.810\npre-scheduled email delivery reports,\nwhich is nice.\n\n119\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.190\nYou subscribe,\nwe'll talk about that process.\n\n120\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.970\nYou have notifications and\n\n121\n00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.650\nsubscriptions that we can tell\nyou when something's happening.\n\n122\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.450\nYou can get that information delivered.\n\n123\n00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.630\nIt's kinda like Amazon, but for reporting.\n\n124\n00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.560\nAs a matter of fact, I think they're the\nnext version, they're gonna come out, and\n\n125\n00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.591\nessentially that's just gonna be them.\n\n126\n00:05:36.591 --> 00:05:38.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All schedules, all delivery,\n\n127\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.420\neverything, all Amazon prime,\nbrought to you by Amazon.\n\n128\n00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.720\nThat would be like,\ntalk about taking over the world, right?\n\n129\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.510\nYou convince Microsoft to let you do the\ndelivery on their reports for them, and\n\n130\n00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.070\nyou brand it?\n\n131\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.040\nThat would be-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n132\n00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.200\n&gt;&gt; You gotta put that one on the list.\n\n133\n00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.804\n&gt;&gt; At that point, you're definitely\nworld domination [LAUGH].\n\n134\n00:05:53.804 --> 00:05:57.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou're running with the big boys, right?\n\n135\n00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n136\n00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.030\n&gt;&gt; That's big stuff.\n\n137\n00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.020\nBut you can imagine, right,\n\n138\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.770\njust the capabilities that we have\nwhen we think about this kinda stuff.\n\n139\n00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.650\nWe're gonna show you all this in\nthe console in a few minutes, by the way.\n\n140\n00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.690\nWe also can design our own custom reports.\n\n141\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.700\nSo it's nice to be able to take\nreports off the shelf right?\n\n142\n00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.450\nAnd say hey, I need to know how many\n\n143\n00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.550\nerrors I had interacting with that\nwebsite over the last 24 hours.\n\n144\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.290\nThey need to know how many bad reads or\n\n145\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.490\nwrites I had off that hard\ndrive on that machine.\n\n146\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.580\nCloud providers need this kind of\nstuff on a daily basis to understand\n\n147\n00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.600\ntheir infrastructure.\n\n148\n00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.470\nThere's lot's of value\nin pre-made reports.\n\n149\n00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.810\nBut there's also value in customizing\nreports and making our own.\n\n150\n00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.750\nAnd we have a tool for that, as we say.\n\n151\n00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.280\nReport builder, which is the standard\ntool that we use with SSRS,\n\n152\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.300\nwith SQL Server Reporting Services.\n\n153\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.250\nWe use Report Builder, if you've ever used\nit you know it's a grid-like interface.\n\n154\n00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.360\nWe drag out the report elements and\nwe create them on a grid.\n\n155\n00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.120\nWe lay them out, so it's almost like\na combination of the Form Builder\n\n156\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.110\nthat you're maybe used to Access,\nif you've ever done report building there.\n\n157\n00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.640\nOr if you ever use, remember FrontPage?\n\n158\n00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.480\n&gt;&gt; Vaguely, yeah, from back in the day.\n\n159\n00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.810\n&gt;&gt; Like way, way back, right?\n\n160\n00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n161\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.129\n&gt;&gt; So FrontPage was the original Microsoft\nweb authoring tool that they brought\n\n162\n00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:07.415\nout long, long time ago.\n\n163\n00:07:07.415 --> 00:07:08.991\nGot rebranded and\n\n164\n00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:15.090\nis now being used under a different\nname to be able to build a website.\n\n165\n00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.270\nSharePoint Designer is what\nwe call FrontPage now.\n\n166\n00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.090\nIt's what it's been renamed\nover the last Number of years.\n\n167\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.500\nBut it's kind of like that a little bit.\n\n168\n00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.240\nIt's got that kind of look and feel.\n\n169\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.960\nEverything's kind of moving\ntowards that tabbed interface.\n\n170\n00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.220\nLooks a lot like visual studio,\nif you ever spend any time using that.\n\n171\n00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.760\nAnd you build elements there.\n\n172\n00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.200\nThey all kind of look the same these days.\n\n173\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.990\nSo Report Builder's gonna be used.\n\n174\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.230\nYou can design and\npublish reports right from there.\n\n175\n00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.370\nIt's a neat little tool.\n\n176\n00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.165\nYou download off the SSRS site as\nyou go on to use it, it installs,\n\n177\n00:07:42.165 --> 00:07:45.000\nit just updates the latest version for\nyou.\n\n178\n00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.972\nAnd once you've done that,\n\n179\n00:07:45.972 --> 00:07:49.221\nyou're then able to use\nthe interface to be able to do this.\n\n180\n00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:51.985\nYou have two models that are created and\n\n181\n00:07:51.985 --> 00:07:55.182\nmade available for\nuse with report builder.\n\n182\n00:07:55.182 --> 00:07:58.956\nYou have to load the models in\nbefore you can then configure them.\n\n183\n00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:01.512\nAnd once you publish the models\nthen you can go in and\n\n184\n00:08:01.512 --> 00:08:03.841\nuse them Start to build\nreports against them.\n\n185\n00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:05.988\nThe models are loaded from,\n\n186\n00:08:05.988 --> 00:08:10.745\nor located at the report models\nother directory on the server.\n\n187\n00:08:10.745 --> 00:08:12.520\nSo you report model/other.\n\n188\n00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.350\nAnd there's two, they have .smdl,\n.smdl extensions.\n\n189\n00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.600\nOne is event.smdl,\none is performance.smdl.\n\n190\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.560\nYou can probably ascertain, or\njust think through the logic of,\n\n191\n00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.805\nwhat report model would kind pf\ngive you what functionality.\n\n192\n00:08:27.805 --> 00:08:32.610\nEvent.smdl is the report model that\ndeals with events and event tracking.\n\n193\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.120\nMonitoring of events and\ninteracting with them.\n\n194\n00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.920\nAnd performance.smdl is the report\nmodel that allows you allows you to do\n\n195\n00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.408\na performance monitoring.\n\n196\n00:08:40.408 --> 00:08:45.200\nSo, you know all the things about, how\nmuch free space do we have on the drive?\n\n197\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.130\nAnd what was our read rate and things\nlike that would be performance based.\n\n198\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.556\nWindows Performance Monitor, so\n\n199\n00:08:51.556 --> 00:08:54.680\nis it's in perfmon,\nit's kind of that thought process there.\n\n200\n00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.290\nEvents think of the event log,\n\n201\n00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.900\nthink of event tracking,\nany of those kind of things.\n\n202\n00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.210\nHow many times did I log on successfully?\n\n203\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.388\nHow many times did that\nwebsite have this happen?\n\n204\n00:09:04.388 --> 00:09:06.250\nThose are the kind of things\nwe would track there.\n\n205\n00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.730\nOnce we publish those models, we\nconfigure what's called the data source.\n\n206\n00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.180\nIn their data sources, the pipe or\n\n207\n00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.480\nthe feed that brings\nthe data in from the system.\n\n208\n00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.000\nAnd allows us then to use the data\nto be able to feed the reports.\n\n209\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.650\nAnd so we would go to the home page\nfrom SQL Server Reporting Services.\n\n210\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.300\nWe'd be able to interact\nwith that from that webpage.\n\n211\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.750\nIt's typically the http:// right?\n\n212\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:33.893\nThe ssrs_servername, so\nyou know whatever it would\n\n213\n00:09:33.893 --> 00:09:40.304\nbe Adam-o1.reporting .itpro.tv or\nwhatever that would be.\n\n214\n00:09:40.304 --> 00:09:44.306\nForward slash reports would be the URL we\nwould typically go to and that's where we\n\n215\n00:09:44.306 --> 00:09:48.400\nwould then find the ability to work with\nthese reports and interact with them.\n\n216\n00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.220\nSo if you haven't ever seen\nthat definitely wanna go in and\n\n217\n00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.820\nmake sure you take a look at that.\n\n218\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.440\nBut that's the kind of thing that we do.\n\n219\n00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.890\nWe build those reports\nout using these tools.\n\n220\n00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.210\nAnd once we've done that loaded up those\nmodels and configure the data sources.\n\n221\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.660\nWe're then be able to go in and\nto interact.\n\n222\n00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.350\nLet's take a look for just a minute\nif we can add the apps console.\n\n223\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.660\nWe'll just show you where the reports are.\n\n224\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.690\nAnd try to give you a little since,\nlittle feel of what were doing here.\n\n225\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.490\nSo I'm in the ops account,\nI've opened it up on ops manager.\n\n226\n00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.360\nI'm in the administration\nwork space right now.\n\n227\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.170\nWe'll talk about notifications and\nhow we subscribe and\n\n228\n00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.610\nget that stuff in just a minute.\n\n229\n00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.050\nSo come back we'll take a look at this but\nlet's start by dealing with reports.\n\n230\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.530\nRemember I told you that we\nhave the reporting workspace.\n\n231\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.300\nYou've seen this in a lot of our\nepisodes as we've gone in and\n\n232\n00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.070\ndemoed various aspects and\nfunctionality here for you.\n\n233\n00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.340\nAnd as we import the management packs,\n\n234\n00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.060\nour reports get stacked up in\nthe reporting workspace here.\n\n235\n00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.050\nAnd as we scroll up we could\njust see them listed here\n\n236\n00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.010\nwhatever the case may be based on\namount from patch they come from.\n\n237\n00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.355\nAnd so\nwe'll see under Application Monitoring,\n\n238\n00:10:46.355 --> 00:10:51.080\n.NET Monitoring, Application Wiser\nReports, we have Client-Side Monitoring,\n\n239\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.330\nProb Analysis, Resource Utilization.\n\n240\n00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.870\nThere's different categories.\n\n241\n00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.450\nAnd if we click on any one of these,\nwe'll have several reports pending on\n\n242\n00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.464\nthe particular folder and sub directories,\nmaybe five, maybe ten, maybe two.\n\n243\n00:11:02.464 --> 00:11:04.529\nHard to say, you have to obviously\ngo through and just take a look.\n\n244\n00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:09.380\nBut we've got variable numbers of reports\nbased on the management pack they come\n\n245\n00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.745\nfrom, and any one of these\nreports can be highlighted.\n\n246\n00:11:12.745 --> 00:11:16.145\nSo we can grab this one,\nlet's say application status.\n\n247\n00:11:16.145 --> 00:11:19.505\nAnd we can go in,\nwe can open the report right over here,\n\n248\n00:11:19.505 --> 00:11:21.975\nwe can also right click and\ndo the same thing by the way.\n\n249\n00:11:21.975 --> 00:11:24.555\nWe can open the report,\nwe can schedule it.\n\n250\n00:11:24.555 --> 00:11:26.035\nWe'll talk about scheduling.\n\n251\n00:11:26.035 --> 00:11:28.985\nWe've mentioned it, rather, I should say\nthis is where we can set it up to run\n\n252\n00:11:28.985 --> 00:11:30.950\nat a pre-determined time so\nwe can do that.\n\n253\n00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.460\nWe could delete the report.\n\n254\n00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.410\nDon't wanna do that though,\n\n255\n00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.130\nbecause then we gotta worry about\nre-importing it or re-creating it.\n\n256\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.950\nIf there's a problem, and\nof course we can refresh and\n\n257\n00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.800\nsometimes we have to update the reports.\n\n258\n00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.340\nAnd if we re-load a management pack or\nupdate it, may have to do that.\n\n259\n00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.950\nAnd that's a general rule of thumb,\nby the way.\n\n260\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.040\nI know we've talked about\nthis in some prior episodes.\n\n261\n00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.200\nYou saw me actually having to do\nthis in one of the prior demos from\n\n262\n00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.990\nearlier episodes where we're going through\nusing PowerShell to configure some of\n\n263\n00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:00.720\nthe variables around database grooming and\nalerts, resolution status.\n\n264\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.250\nAnd I use PowerShell, then we went and\nwe took a look at the settings, and\n\n265\n00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.810\nthey didn't update.\n\n266\n00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.524\nAnd we said, wait we gotta just\nrefresh the console, cuz remember,\n\n267\n00:12:07.524 --> 00:12:08.668\nit doesn't always refresh.\n\n268\n00:12:08.668 --> 00:12:10.520\nWe closed out, open back up and boom!\n\n269\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.200\nT settings had updated.\n\n270\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.674\nSo don't be afraid to refresh,\nlot of times we'll be doing something.\n\n271\n00:12:15.674 --> 00:12:18.694\nDoesn't show up in the console, you're\nscratching your head second guessing\n\n272\n00:12:18.694 --> 00:12:20.369\nyourself, going wait a sec, did I do that?\n\n273\n00:12:20.369 --> 00:12:23.667\nRight, but then you gotta remember\nthe console doesn't always update.\n\n274\n00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:28.072\nRemember, the console is\nrunning off of the database and\n\n275\n00:12:28.072 --> 00:12:31.022\nthe observer to update information.\n\n276\n00:12:31.022 --> 00:12:35.160\nAnd if that feed doesn't always accurately\nupdate as quickly as you want it to,\n\n277\n00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.530\nyou may have a latency or\na lag issue there.\n\n278\n00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.110\nIt's not a bad thing, I'm not saying you\nbroke it, I'm just implying that you did\n\n279\n00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.940\nsomething, it is there, but you're just\nnot seeing it reflected in the console.\n\n280\n00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.860\nAnd that could from time to time.\n\n281\n00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.430\nIt happens with a lot fo these products.\n\n282\n00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.500\nNot just SKUM.\n\n283\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.170\nHappens in several different products.\n\n284\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.980\nSo as a result don't be afraid\nto use that refresh option.\n\n285\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.350\nYou'll always right click, refresh,\nF5 in any of the consoles.\n\n286\n00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.258\nClose out the console reopen it.\n\n287\n00:13:01.258 --> 00:13:06.380\nForcing a re-communication on update\nback to the database, to update status.\n\n288\n00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.510\nThat will tend to solve a lot of these\nmissing items that are there, but\n\n289\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.880\nnot really there kind of thing.\n\n290\n00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.930\nThat we don't rather.\n\n291\n00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.130\nThey're really there, but\nyou can't see them, is what I mean to say.\n\n292\n00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.860\nSo let's just go back,\njust to talk about what we're doing here.\n\n293\n00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.450\nSo you can refresh if you need to.\n\n294\n00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.944\nThe nice thing about the report area is\ndown below here a lot of times you'll say\n\n295\n00:13:23.944 --> 00:13:25.319\nhey go run that report.\n\n296\n00:13:25.319 --> 00:13:27.528\nAnd I'll say to Daniel hey I need\nthat application status report, and\n\n297\n00:13:27.528 --> 00:13:29.369\nDaniel's like I don't know\nwhat the hell that report is.\n\n298\n00:13:29.369 --> 00:13:30.177\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What do you mean?\n\n299\n00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:30.995\nWhat does it do, right?\n\n300\n00:13:30.995 --> 00:13:32.960\nI'm not sure what it is,\nlet alone where it is.\n\n301\n00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.230\nWell, I can tell him where it is.\n\n302\n00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.500\nThat's easy to find.\n\n303\n00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.320\nHey, go to the subfolder, Daniel,\nright-click Run This Report.\n\n304\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.605\nBut, Daniel,\nbeing the inquisitive person that he is,\n\n305\n00:13:40.605 --> 00:13:42.423\nprobably wants to know\nwhat the report does.\n\n306\n00:13:42.423 --> 00:13:45.660\nAnd he may not want to run\nit until he understands it.\n\n307\n00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.970\nAnd so,\nif you read the description down below and\n\n308\n00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.210\nyou can see it's hanging out down\nthere on the bottom of the pane.\n\n309\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.750\nThank you very much, and\nyou could see as we look\n\n310\n00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.820\nit just gives us a little overview,\nnothing too fancy, right?\n\n311\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.160\nDaniel may still need to actually run the\nreport to get a better sense of it, but\n\n312\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.900\nat least he has an idea of what's\ngonna happen when he runs the report.\n\n313\n00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.390\nHe's not totally in the dark\ntrying to figure this out.\n\n314\n00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.190\nSo let's just go ahead and\nwe'll take a quick look.\n\n315\n00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.650\nWe'll open this goes to report\nopens up in a separate window,\n\n316\n00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:12.460\ngive it just a minute here.\n\n317\n00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.140\nAnd then again, this is variable the sense\non every reports design a little\n\n318\n00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:20.200\ndifferently, the fields you may need\nto implement and put data into here and\n\n319\n00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.760\ngonna look different, and\nof course report itself.\n\n320\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.440\nWe'll output differently based\non how the report was designed.\n\n321\n00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.410\nSo no two reports are necessarily\ngonna be identical but\n\n322\n00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.490\na lot of the general concepts\nare gonna be represented there.\n\n323\n00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.790\nAnd so you'll see that we have\nthe ability to be able to fill in\n\n324\n00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.690\nvarious areas on the report.\n\n325\n00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.020\nIf we go back to fullscreen for a minute,\n\n326\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.440\nmaybe it's easier for\nyou guys to see this a little bit.\n\n327\n00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.400\nYou can see the end date here.\n\n328\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.050\nSo we have a little calendar\nfunction we can pull down,\n\n329\n00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.170\ndo a little pop-up calendar,\nright, program.\n\n330\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.700\nAnd I always used to hate that when\nI had to write that stuff in and\n\n331\n00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.510\nyou didn't know what\nformat to write it in.\n\n332\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:56.780\nYou know, I do a lot of work over seas,\nyou may or may not do that.\n\n333\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.649\nBut, you know, overseas, depending on what\ncountry you're in, it's not always the way\n\n334\n00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:03.527\nwe write the date and the structure\nof the date in the United States.\n\n335\n00:15:03.527 --> 00:15:04.475\nAnd it's different.\n\n336\n00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:07.225\nSometimes it's gonna be day,\nthen month, then year.\n\n337\n00:15:07.225 --> 00:15:08.875\nOther times it's month, then day.\n\n338\n00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.595\nSo I'd be always getting it backwards.\n\n339\n00:15:10.595 --> 00:15:12.715\nI'd be like 4/3, they're like what?\n\n340\n00:15:12.715 --> 00:15:14.625\nYou want third of March?\n\n341\n00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:16.727\nNo, I want it fourth of April, but\nit's just I wrote it backwards.\n\n342\n00:15:16.727 --> 00:15:18.807\nSo you gotta think about that.\n\n343\n00:15:18.807 --> 00:15:20.543\nYou got your time values here, right?\n\n344\n00:15:20.543 --> 00:15:25.116\nSo you got your End Date, you've got your\nPeriod, are we doing this based on day,\n\n345\n00:15:25.116 --> 00:15:27.647\nweek, month, in this particular case?\n\n346\n00:15:27.647 --> 00:15:29.438\nWhat's our threshold gonna be?\n\n347\n00:15:29.438 --> 00:15:31.428\nWhat are problems that we're looking for?\n\n348\n00:15:31.428 --> 00:15:35.158\nLook for all problems or\ncategorize based on different variables.\n\n349\n00:15:35.158 --> 00:15:38.468\nIn this case, maybe critical problems,\nthings like that.\n\n350\n00:15:38.468 --> 00:15:40.878\nWhat's our thresholds that\nwe're looking at for errors?\n\n351\n00:15:40.878 --> 00:15:42.334\nAll sorts of stuff, right?\n\n352\n00:15:42.334 --> 00:15:45.574\nSo we've got a lot of\ndifferent information.\n\n353\n00:15:45.574 --> 00:15:49.154\nI'm not gonna actually run this report for\nyou, cuz I don't have any data backing\n\n354\n00:15:49.154 --> 00:15:51.494\nthis particular report,\nI just randomly chose one.\n\n355\n00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:53.844\nBut I just wanted to show it to you but\nI could run it.\n\n356\n00:15:53.844 --> 00:15:55.308\nWe always have a run button here.\n\n357\n00:15:55.308 --> 00:15:59.539\nAnd when we run it we get back information\nbased on whatever the values are that we\n\n358\n00:15:59.539 --> 00:16:00.501\nhave specified.\n\n359\n00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.377\nAnd then when we're done,\nyou'll see that, and let's just run it.\n\n360\n00:16:03.377 --> 00:16:07.557\nWell, I'll run it, we aren't gonna get\nanything but Gotta do source here,\n\n361\n00:16:07.557 --> 00:16:08.233\none second.\n\n362\n00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:09.164\nForgot about that.\n\n363\n00:16:09.164 --> 00:16:11.920\nActually, I can't run this one,\ncuz I don't have a source declared.\n\n364\n00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.900\nBut I was gonna show you when we run it,\nwe could save it, but no big deal.\n\n365\n00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.730\nIf you just go to File,\nyou can get the sense here.\n\n366\n00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.040\nWe could export the report out and,\nor save it off once we're done.\n\n367\n00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.890\nSo save to favorites,\nwe could publish it, we could print it.\n\n368\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.020\nSo we can work with the information and\n\n369\n00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.390\nmake it available to a variety\nof formats once we're done.\n\n370\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:32.640\nSo that's how we would generate\ninformation just using a generic report.\n\n371\n00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.390\nNow, once we've brought the report in,\nif we wanna schedule it to run,\n\n372\n00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.760\nlet's just look at schedule real quick,\nsince we had talked about that.\n\n373\n00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.200\nWe'll highlight the appropriate report.\n\n374\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.470\nClick on Schedule and\nactually make sure the click sticks, and\n\n375\n00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.490\nthen we can just do a description here,\nright?\n\n376\n00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.982\nSo we can do Adam Test.\n\n377\n00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:59.443\nAnd then, we'll look at our delivery\nmethods here, we have Windows File Share,\n\n378\n00:16:59.443 --> 00:17:00.710\nI mentioned this.\n\n379\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.640\nWe have the null delivery provider, email\nis not on that list because I haven't set\n\n380\n00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.640\nup the email provider and configured it.\n\n381\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.760\nI would need to provide the SMTP\ninformation to do that.\n\n382\n00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.760\nBut I mentioned there's an email option,\nand\n\n383\n00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.540\nI could use that as well,\ndepending on what I wanna do.\n\n384\n00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.757\nBut without configuring it, Windows\nfile share, I dump it into a UMC and\n\n385\n00:17:18.757 --> 00:17:20.565\nspecify where it's gonna go.\n\n386\n00:17:20.565 --> 00:17:25.325\nIf I decide to use null delivery provider,\nnotice all that detailed information\n\n387\n00:17:25.325 --> 00:17:30.015\ndown below goes away cuz the null delivery\nprovider is the hey, run it to the SSRS\n\n388\n00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:34.220\nserver and cache the report there, so\nI can grab it later when I want it.\n\n389\n00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.960\nEssentially, I go up to the server, and\n\n390\n00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.620\nI just grab it from one of\nthe published directories.\n\n391\n00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.110\nSo it's gonna stay there, so I don't have\nto worry about configuring anything,\n\n392\n00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.730\nI just have to go get it when I'm done.\n\n393\n00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:46.030\nBut if I wanna use the Windows\nfile share provider,\n\n394\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.150\nthen I actually have to use\nthe information and configure it out.\n\n395\n00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.470\nSo I know how to connect to it.\n\n396\n00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.240\nSo we'll just set it to null just cuz we\nwanna move past the screen real quick and\n\n397\n00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.650\ntake a look at the schedule.\n\n398\n00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.770\nAnd so once we do that,\nit's a standard schedule interface,\n\n399\n00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.410\nthe ones you want hourly,\ndaily, weekly, monthly.\n\n400\n00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.064\nWhen do I wanna make\nit effective to begin,\n\n401\n00:18:04.064 --> 00:18:06.810\nwhen do I wanna expire\nif I choose to do that.\n\n402\n00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.621\nLot of times, people ask, hey,\nthis is nice, but why would I really\n\n403\n00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:12.930\nschedule reports when I'm just gonna\nrun them when I wanna run them?\n\n404\n00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.890\nWell, what I often use this for, or\nwhat I tell my customers about and\n\n405\n00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.665\nstudents about is,\ndo you have a boss, a senior manager?\n\n406\n00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:24.440\nSomebody in the organization that needs\nto consume this data, but is not gonna\n\n407\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.900\nbe in the business of going and figuring\nout how to run it on their own, right?\n\n408\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.740\nAnd you normally have those\npeople in almost every business.\n\n409\n00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.160\nNot because they couldn't do it,\njust because they're too busy or\n\n410\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.410\nthey just don't have the inclination\nto go figure out how to use the console\n\n411\n00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.690\njust to get a report.\n\n412\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.670\nThey just want you to\ngive them the report.\n\n413\n00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.890\nWell, why don't you just schedule the\nreport and then have it delivered to them?\n\n414\n00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.730\nAnd that's one of the reasons\nwhy we do this traditionally,\n\n415\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.060\nbecause then if you do it this way,\n\n416\n00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.770\nyou can just literally drop that report\nin their inbox with the email provider.\n\n417\n00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.943\nOr send it to a share and just have them\ngo pull it up whenever they want it,\n\n418\n00:18:52.943 --> 00:18:54.046\nthat kind of thing, so.\n\n419\n00:18:54.046 --> 00:18:56.150\n&gt;&gt; Plus, it takes some of\nthe load off of your back, right?\n\n420\n00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.750\nYou set up that report that you\nknow you're gonna have to repeat\n\n421\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.900\non a regular basis anyway.\n\n422\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.150\nLet the machine do it for you and\n\n423\n00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.110\nthen give access to whoever\nneeds it whenever they need it.\n\n424\n00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.100\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; You're busy doing other stuff.\n\n425\n00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.090\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.\n\n426\n00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.500\nIt's a quality of life,\nhow am I gonna spend my time,\n\n427\n00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.390\nget the most value out of what I'm doing\nand using my technology kind of thing.\n\n428\n00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.390\nSo it's a good thing to know how to do,\nand\n\n429\n00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.840\nit's obviously important to be aware\nof the fact you could do it, so\n\n430\n00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.870\nI just wanna make sure you see it and\nunderstand it.\n\n431\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.340\nSo we've talked about that a little bit,\nlet's just wrap up this particular part\n\n432\n00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.000\nof the conversation with one\nother thing I wanna show you.\n\n433\n00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.630\nWe'll just get out of here, we're not\ngonna bother to actually set that up for\n\n434\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.828\ndelivery, just wanna show\nyou what we could do there.\n\n435\n00:19:30.828 --> 00:19:33.995\nI wanted to go back over here to\nadministration, show you the back\n\n436\n00:19:33.995 --> 00:19:37.700\nend piece of this, with channels,\nand subscribers, and subscriptions.\n\n437\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.190\nThis is just one of the moving parts under\nthe hood that allows us to set this up.\n\n438\n00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.500\nAnd say okay, if I am gonna deliver this,\nhow do people know there's an update?\n\n439\n00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.940\nHow do we know hey, there's something new,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n440\n00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.690\nSo, we have under notifications here,\nwe're in the administration workspace,\n\n441\n00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.170\nwe have notifications.\n\n442\n00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.205\nAnd under notifications, we have channels.\n\n443\n00:19:56.205 --> 00:20:01.640\nAnd again, we can right click here, we\ncan do a new channel right from here and,\n\n444\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.870\nor on the right under channel\nin the far right nav bar,\n\n445\n00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.850\nit's actually right up,\nget me on point there.\n\n446\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:13.030\nRight over about there, if I go this way,\nright, let me see, I'm not tall enough.\n\n447\n00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.320\n&gt;&gt; Where the hand would be.\n\n448\n00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.130\n&gt;&gt; I'm like almost there.\n\n449\n00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.120\nI can actually do this, and I'm actually\njust there, but I'm not tall enough.\n\n450\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.586\nDaniel, if you did this, you would be able\nto grab it and pull it down like this, and\n\n451\n00:20:22.586 --> 00:20:23.310\nthrow it at everybody.\n\n452\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.296\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just like that, it would be awesome.\n\n453\n00:20:25.296 --> 00:20:29.464\nWe gotta have something that pops out\nwhen I do that, like virtual reality, 3D.\n\n454\n00:20:29.464 --> 00:20:32.120\nIt'd be like poof, people were just like\nrunning away from the screen right now.\n\n455\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.410\n&gt;&gt; We'll talk to Don about\ngetting some 3D cameras in here.\n\n456\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:36.118\n&gt;&gt; That would be cool.\n\n457\n00:20:36.118 --> 00:20:40.625\nSo when I talked about hey,\nwe haven't set up the SMPT provider yet,\n\n458\n00:20:40.625 --> 00:20:43.415\nwhat I'm really talking about is we\nhaven't configured the channel for\n\n459\n00:20:43.415 --> 00:20:47.695\nSMTP delivery, so it's available so we can\nuse it, and that's what we're seeing here.\n\n460\n00:20:47.695 --> 00:20:50.998\nSo we have the ability to use email for\nSMTP delivery.\n\n461\n00:20:50.998 --> 00:20:55.306\nWe could do, I mentioned instant\nmessaging, SMS, and, or commands.\n\n462\n00:20:55.306 --> 00:20:59.067\nSo we could do a variety of different\nthings to allow us to subscribe and\n\n463\n00:20:59.067 --> 00:21:03.110\ninteract with information, and\nwe would come in and create a new channel.\n\n464\n00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.480\nWe'll just take a look here real\nquick if we do SMTP for email.\n\n465\n00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.850\nIt's pretty straightforward, except for\nthe fact that I have to hide my task bar.\n\n466\n00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:11.760\nGive me just one second.\n\n467\n00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.950\nThis is one of those windows\nthat if we don't auto hide,\n\n468\n00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.170\nwe're not gonna be able to see.\n\n469\n00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.790\nYou've seen me deal with this in some\nof the other demos from time to time.\n\n470\n00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.690\nIt's because of the screen resolution, so\nyou'll see here when we go here that we\n\n471\n00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:27.450\nthen can program in our SMTPF QDN and\nport settings, right?\n\n472\n00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.770\nSo we have our basic SMTP\nsender information there.\n\n473\n00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.465\nWe click Add,\nwe add in our SMTP address, and\n\n474\n00:21:34.465 --> 00:21:37.805\nwe just put in the information for that.\n\n475\n00:21:37.805 --> 00:21:40.965\nSpecify our authentication method,\ndo Anonymous,\n\n476\n00:21:40.965 --> 00:21:43.595\nWindows Integrated,\npretty basic standard stuff.\n\n477\n00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:47.626\nIf we do this, Retry Interval there,\nright, so we've got all the basic stuff.\n\n478\n00:21:47.626 --> 00:21:53.176\nAnd then once we set that up,\nwe're then able to use that.\n\n479\n00:21:53.176 --> 00:21:57.150\nWe've also got, let's just take a look at\nthe other since we're here real quick.\n\n480\n00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.580\nWe've got the instant messaging and,\nor SMS one.\n\n481\n00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:05.225\nAnd again, we can go in, you just need\nthe IM server or the SMS server for relay.\n\n482\n00:22:05.225 --> 00:22:09.341\nAnd you could set this up and so we have\nall the different capabilities here,\n\n483\n00:22:09.341 --> 00:22:13.397\nobviously based on each particular\nmessaging delivery thought process or\n\n484\n00:22:13.397 --> 00:22:15.408\nchannel that we would subscribe to.\n\n485\n00:22:15.408 --> 00:22:18.334\nAnd then we get down to\nthe ability to make a format here.\n\n486\n00:22:18.334 --> 00:22:21.060\nLet's just set this up.\n\n487\n00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.650\n&gt;&gt; Adam, do people typically set up\nmultiple ways, so you do email and SMS?\n\n488\n00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.570\nThat way, if one fails,\nthe other might be handling-\n\n489\n00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.320\n&gt;&gt; They do, just as a fail over or\n\n490\n00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.750\nas a back up as you would say,\nso in case one goes down.\n\n491\n00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:36.695\nCuz you may lose your email provider\nbecause your SMTP service goes offline,\n\n492\n00:22:36.695 --> 00:22:41.500\nbut your SIP provider may be online,\nthat kind of thing, so yeah, definitely.\n\n493\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.634\nAnd I just went ahead and put some\nridiculous random stuff in the server line\n\n494\n00:22:44.634 --> 00:22:48.114\nthere just to show you the next screen cuz\nI didn't show you format on the prior one,\n\n495\n00:22:48.114 --> 00:22:50.215\nI just wanna show it to you here.\n\n496\n00:22:50.215 --> 00:22:53.955\nSo you get the ability on the format\nscreen here to specify the message,\n\n497\n00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:57.075\nwhatever you want the message to\nbe when something gets delivered.\n\n498\n00:22:57.075 --> 00:23:00.555\nSo, they have this here, and\nyou can see, it's about your script.\n\n499\n00:23:00.555 --> 00:23:02.003\nIf we can go full screen,\nit may make a little more sense.\n\n500\n00:23:02.003 --> 00:23:05.302\nIt's probably not that much better, but\nit's probably just kinda hard to see.\n\n501\n00:23:05.302 --> 00:23:11.832\nBut you see you have the alert variable in\nhere, so alert:$data default, not present.\n\n502\n00:23:11.832 --> 00:23:14.322\nYou go through, and you read all this,\nand it kinda programs them and\n\n503\n00:23:14.322 --> 00:23:17.306\ndrops in all the variables for the alerts.\n\n504\n00:23:17.306 --> 00:23:22.516\nSo when the alert comes out and, or you\nget information, we then are able to say,\n\n505\n00:23:22.516 --> 00:23:26.096\nhey, this is what it is, and\nyou see this all set up and available.\n\n506\n00:23:26.096 --> 00:23:28.985\nSo this is what it would be as we go\nin and we actually set these things up.\n\n507\n00:23:28.985 --> 00:23:33.686\nWe have the same thing for SMS and the\nsame thing for the command one as well.\n\n508\n00:23:33.686 --> 00:23:36.840\nSo we've talked about the channels,\nlet's look at subscribers here for\n\n509\n00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.480\njust a minute.\n\n510\n00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.728\nNotice, we have no subscribers right now.\n\n511\n00:23:40.728 --> 00:23:44.580\nAgain, right click, we can do New,\nright here, New Channel,\n\n512\n00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.440\nNew Subscriber right below it.\n\n513\n00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.341\nOff to the right,\nwe could see New Subscriber as well.\n\n514\n00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:53.282\nAnd when we do New Subscriber, what we're\ndoing here is we're putting in someone's\n\n515\n00:23:53.282 --> 00:23:57.073\nname, so we're putting in the person that\nwe wanna create a subscription force.\n\n516\n00:23:57.073 --> 00:23:59.846\nSo, this will be administrator or\nAdam, Daniel,\n\n517\n00:23:59.846 --> 00:24:02.235\nwhoever You could see it's just put there.\n\n518\n00:24:02.235 --> 00:24:05.486\nGot a little browse window here so\nwe can go pull the user out.\n\n519\n00:24:05.486 --> 00:24:09.647\nUsed Daniel's favorite little option there\nwith the underline to specify the name and\n\n520\n00:24:09.647 --> 00:24:11.480\nmake sure it's configured, right?\n\n521\n00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.466\nSo we avoid all those errors.\n\n522\n00:24:13.466 --> 00:24:17.311\nAnd then you'll see we can specify\nalways send notifications or\n\n523\n00:24:17.311 --> 00:24:19.800\nnotify only during specified times.\n\n524\n00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.029\nSo we can specify a date range and\na time range.\n\n525\n00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:24.872\nLet's move this over so\nthat you can see this here.\n\n526\n00:24:24.872 --> 00:24:29.738\nSo if somebody’s on call or somebody works\ncertain schedules, you’re not bombarding\n\n527\n00:24:29.738 --> 00:24:34.400\nthem 24 hours a day with ridiculous\nupdates, and alerts and notifications.\n\n528\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.604\nYou could set up, essentially, a rotating\nschedule for people, which is nice.\n\n529\n00:24:37.604 --> 00:24:38.206\n&gt;&gt; That’s very nice.\n\n530\n00:24:38.206 --> 00:24:38.973\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz it's great.\n\n531\n00:24:38.973 --> 00:24:41.932\nBecause then when you’re on\ncall you get that information,\n\n532\n00:24:41.932 --> 00:24:44.900\nwhen you're not goes to whoever\nelse is subscribing for it.\n\n533\n00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.898\nSo that part's nice.\n\n534\n00:24:45.898 --> 00:24:49.373\nIt takes a little planning, little thought\nprocess on your side to do that but\n\n535\n00:24:49.373 --> 00:24:50.983\nit's nice to be able to set that up.\n\n536\n00:24:50.983 --> 00:24:53.720\n&gt;&gt; I get to ignore my phone\na whole lot less than normal.\n\n537\n00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.312\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n538\n00:24:54.312 --> 00:24:55.036\n&gt;&gt; You do, and\n\n539\n00:24:55.036 --> 00:24:58.340\nthen let's just do this one here so\nyou could see.\n\n540\n00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.973\nThen under Addresses,\naccording associate specific addresses for\n\n541\n00:25:01.973 --> 00:25:04.607\nnotification schedules,\nso we allow delivery.\n\n542\n00:25:04.607 --> 00:25:07.550\nSo this is just the back end, just thought\nI'd show it to you while we're here.\n\n543\n00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:11.840\nSo then we go in and\nwe specify just a name for the address,\n\n544\n00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.830\nwhatever it may be, and then this is\nwhere our channels come in, right?\n\n545\n00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:20.646\nWe specify out channel type and then\nwe're able to specify delivery address.\n\n546\n00:25:20.646 --> 00:25:24.016\nSo if we wanna send email,\nwe do SMTP channel and do the email.\n\n547\n00:25:24.016 --> 00:25:28.828\nIf we wanna do SMS, specify the SMS\nprovider channel and then we do the SMS.\n\n548\n00:25:28.828 --> 00:25:32.540\nIf we wanna do IM, we do that with the zip\naddress, whatever the case may be.\n\n549\n00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.752\nSo we bring these things together and\nwe essentially customize link.\n\n550\n00:25:36.752 --> 00:25:41.040\nSo we're able to say, I want this provider\nthrough a channel that's been created.\n\n551\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.585\nThat I want this subscriber to be able\nto use that channel to essentially\n\n552\n00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:46.549\nsend notifications and receive them.\n\n553\n00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:50.531\nSo I can send them to you via email,\nand over to Meagan via IM and\n\n554\n00:25:50.531 --> 00:25:52.072\nI'll get them via SMS.\n\n555\n00:25:52.072 --> 00:25:53.943\nAnd we're just gonna leave\nPeter out of the mix, cuz.\n\n556\n00:25:53.943 --> 00:25:55.888\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; He doesn't care so its irrelevant,\n\n557\n00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:58.320\nwe're not gonna bother him with stuff,\nright?\n\n558\n00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.070\nSo we could do all that right from here,\nif we wanted to,\n\n559\n00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.860\nby setting up the addressing at\nthe tail-end of this, right?\n\n560\n00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.500\nSo this would be nice, and then\nthe subscriptions themselves right here.\n\n561\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.593\nJust do new subscription, so\nagain we'll give it a name.\n\n562\n00:26:17.694 --> 00:26:21.616\nAnd then, we have our criteria for\nsubscriptions.\n\n563\n00:26:21.616 --> 00:26:24.774\nSo go full screen for me on this,\nif you would, it's gonna be important for\n\n564\n00:26:24.774 --> 00:26:25.990\nyou guys to see this.\n\n565\n00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.550\nYou'll see the conditions here when alerts\nare generated for objects that match\n\n566\n00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:34.060\nthe criteria specified, notifications\nare send to specified subscribers.\n\n567\n00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.690\nSo as a result we're gonna say,\nokay I wanna see alerts based on these\n\n568\n00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:42.215\ncriteria and then send them to me based\non the mechanism that I have provided.\n\n569\n00:26:42.215 --> 00:26:47.055\nSo this is gonna be important, so raised\nby an instance in a specific group, right?\n\n570\n00:26:47.055 --> 00:26:49.485\nAnd then,\nhave you ever done the business rules,\n\n571\n00:26:49.485 --> 00:26:53.155\nthe business logic in Outlook where\nyou've set up delivery rules?\n\n572\n00:26:53.155 --> 00:26:53.745\nIt's like this.\n\n573\n00:26:53.745 --> 00:26:55.270\nWhere you click on the keyword.\n\n574\n00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.580\nAnd then okay, specific group.\n\n575\n00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.043\nWhat do you gotta do?\nYou gotta go in and\n\n576\n00:26:58.043 --> 00:26:59.630\nsay what specific means?\n\n577\n00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:03.561\nSo you click on it, and\nthen you filter and there's a search by.\n\n578\n00:27:03.561 --> 00:27:06.359\nAre we searching all\nmanagement packs available?\n\n579\n00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:09.130\nOr we gonna search you know only\na certain management packs?\n\n580\n00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:14.930\nSo let's say, we want to do this\nspecific to Microsoft SQL Server\n\n581\n00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:21.120\n2008 monitoring, just in theory if\nthat's what we were gonna pull for.\n\n582\n00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.430\nThere's no group for that obviously in\nhere because we haven't set this up.\n\n583\n00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:28.450\nYou get the idea, we would then get\nan available group, your management group,\n\n584\n00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.730\nwhatever the case may be,\nand we program that in.\n\n585\n00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:34.971\nSo instead of filtering here, let's just\ndo a broad search, let's just do any.\n\n586\n00:27:37.198 --> 00:27:39.185\nAnd then based on that,\nonce it comes back,\n\n587\n00:27:39.185 --> 00:27:42.960\nwe'll get all the different feeder\nelements that are available as groups.\n\n588\n00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.100\nAnd so we can go in and\nwe can say, hey you know what?\n\n589\n00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:53.650\nLet me take the database's group there,\nselect that, add that.\n\n590\n00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.511\nClick OK, and\nthen that's gonna now be programmed in.\n\n591\n00:27:56.511 --> 00:28:00.526\nAnd so whenever we get an alert\nspecific to this database group and\n\n592\n00:28:00.526 --> 00:28:02.935\nwhatever other conditions I specify,\n\n593\n00:28:02.935 --> 00:28:07.030\nI'm then gonna be able to send it\nto the appropriate subscribers.\n\n594\n00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.367\nWe'll just fast forward there.\n\n595\n00:28:08.367 --> 00:28:11.790\nSpecify our subscribers if we\nhave one already created, right?\n\n596\n00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.616\nAnd hit actually okay to create one.\n\n597\n00:28:13.616 --> 00:28:17.036\nBut you get the idea, you saw me do\nit .Write a program in new ones and\n\n598\n00:28:17.036 --> 00:28:20.401\nthen from there I would go ahead and\nlet's just do that real quick.\n\n599\n00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:22.040\nAnd we'll just do this like we did.\n\n600\n00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.300\nAnd we'll just say this\nis gonna be a subscriber.\n\n601\n00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.220\nAnd you would see here address,\nname channel.\n\n602\n00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.670\nSo we program all that in.\n\n603\n00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.160\nAnd then once we have all that,\nwe would then be able to go through and\n\n604\n00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.190\nspecify a channel, if we hadn't already\nspecified one, and then wrap that up.\n\n605\n00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:45.596\nAnd then that user would be able to get\nthat information through that delivery\n\n606\n00:28:45.596 --> 00:28:49.620\nmechanism and that channel based on\nthe subscription that we create.\n\n607\n00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:54.571\nSo we're able to match specific users\nto specific conditions for updates and\n\n608\n00:28:54.571 --> 00:28:57.910\nalerts, and allow us then to consume them.\n\n609\n00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.200\nSo, this is pretty cool stuff.\n\n610\n00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.010\nWhen you start to get in under\nthe hood with all this and\n\n611\n00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:06.110\ntake a look at how we program in\nall of these little moving parts\n\n612\n00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:10.750\nto create this mesh, this interlocking web\nof information management, that allows us\n\n613\n00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.520\nto take the data coming out of and all\nthe monitoring and everything we're doing.\n\n614\n00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.861\nAnd start to push it out and\nget it into the hands of the operators and\n\n615\n00:29:17.861 --> 00:29:21.859\nthe IT professionals that are gonna need\nit to start using it to make decisions,\n\n616\n00:29:21.859 --> 00:29:24.327\nreact, manage,\ndo a bunch of different stuff.\n\n617\n00:29:24.327 --> 00:29:25.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; On top of the reports.\n\n618\n00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:30.400\nAnd this is only really part one of\nscratching the surface here on reports.\n\n619\n00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.382\nWhat we're talking about.\n\n620\n00:29:31.382 --> 00:29:32.366\nWe're gonna come back.\n\n621\n00:29:32.366 --> 00:29:34.740\nWe're gonna talk about service\nall the tracking a little bit.\n\n622\n00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.396\nTalk about how to deal with things\nlike using the SharePoint web part,\n\n623\n00:29:37.396 --> 00:29:39.165\nto be able to integrate\nthis with SharePoint.\n\n624\n00:29:39.165 --> 00:29:42.296\nWe wanna take a look at how\nto create some Dashboards,\n\n625\n00:29:42.296 --> 00:29:46.775\nUser 3-tier web app that we've\ndesigned and distributed app rather.\n\n626\n00:29:46.775 --> 00:29:49.505\nCreate a Dashboard of that so\nyou had to do a little customization.\n\n627\n00:29:49.505 --> 00:29:52.515\nWe've got some cool stuffs still to\ncome up in this particular area.\n\n628\n00:29:52.515 --> 00:29:55.415\nWe're gonna do a, as they say.\n\n629\n00:29:55.415 --> 00:29:57.020\nOtherwise don't come always part two.\n\n630\n00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And when we come back.\n\n631\n00:29:58.335 --> 00:30:01.552\nBut I think as you were about to say,\nif I'm not mistaken, we are out of time.\n\n632\n00:30:01.552 --> 00:30:03.673\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the mistress of the clock,\n\n633\n00:30:03.673 --> 00:30:07.860\nshe has definitely have ticked\nher last tock for this episode.\n\n634\n00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.540\nBut a lot of cool advanced\nfeatures to come in reporting.\n\n635\n00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.560\nCan't wait to see that in part two,\nmaybe even beyond, who knows?\n\n636\n00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.276\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] You never know\nhow far we'll go here, right?\n\n637\n00:30:15.276 --> 00:30:16.118\n&gt;&gt; Maybe we even have a part three.\n\n638\n00:30:16.118 --> 00:30:17.250\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you never know.\n\n639\n00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:18.680\nSo join us for that.\n\n640\n00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.280\nAdam, thanks so much for joining us today.\n\n641\n00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.130\nWe do thank our viewers for watching.\n\n642\n00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.603\nBut we're going to go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n643\n00:30:24.603 --> 00:30:27.731\nI 've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n644\n00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:30.523\n&gt;&gt; I am

00:00:12.257\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:14.438\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.438 --> 00:00:17.270\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.270\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are back with more data\n\n7\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.800\ncenter monitoring with Microsoft SCOM.\n\n8\n00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.240\nAnd of course joining us again in\nthe studio for some reporting action,\n\n9\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.100\ncontinuing that conversation,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.550\nAdam, welcome back sir,\nglad to have you again.\n\n11\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.829\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.631\n&gt;&gt; It goes well.\n\n13\n00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:38.770\nOn a sliding scale of one to five in\nmy report, I would say I'm a three.\n\n14\n00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.560\nBut I'm moving towards trending\n\n15\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.910\nto a five here very quickly-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.380\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna be moving to five\n\n17\n00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.130\nas soon as we talk about\nconfiguring service level tracking.\n\n18\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.190\nAnd how to set up Ops Manager to\ninteract with SharePoint because those\n\n19\n00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.530\ntwo things should be joined together.\n\n20\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.610\nWe should be using the SharePoint\nweb part to your great advantage.\n\n21\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.770\nWe're gonna talk about\nhow to do that right now.\n\n22\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.590\nSo in our last episode, if you haven't\nseen it, encourage you to take a look.\n\n23\n00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.360\nWe delved under the covers a little bit.\n\n24\n00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.110\nTalked about some of the basic\nconcepts of reports.\n\n25\n00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.690\nTalked about the fact that\nreports can be subscribed to.\n\n26\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.500\nWe talked about how to use notifications,\nchannels, subscribers, etc.\n\n27\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.150\nBe able to see alerts, and\nprogram, and collaborate with and\n\n28\n00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.110\nconnect to information.\n\n29\n00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.810\nBe updated when things occur.\n\n30\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.520\nAnd in general just a rip-roaring,\ngood old fashioned yee haw of a time,\n\n31\n00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.500\nas they say.\n\n32\n00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.940\nAnd so, we're gonna continue and take a\nlook at some of the other aspects of this.\n\n33\n00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.240\nI promised you a trip down,\nhey how do I build that dashboard and\n\n34\n00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.430\ncustomize it lane.\n\n35\n00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.810\nWe're gonna do that as well.\n\n36\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.930\nLet's jump in and\nlet's start by talking about\n\n37\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.300\nhow we deal with service level objectives,\nand monitoring them using Ops Manager.\n\n38\n00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.644\nWe've spoken about many of\nthe products that surround SCOM in\n\n39\n00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:49.320\nthe System Center Suite Service\nLevel Manager, being one of them.\n\n40\n00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.972\nAnd the USub Server Level Manager\nto not only set and maintain SLA,\n\n41\n00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:58.543\nservice level agreements, and\nto do some proactive in linked and\n\n42\n00:01:58.543 --> 00:02:04.760\npartnership with monitoring of SCOM to see\nwhen those SLAs are being upheld or not.\n\n43\n00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.620\nAnd to then create incidence and problems\nand workflows around resolution of\n\n44\n00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.700\nthat in Service Level Mmanager and\nfeedback The SCOM to resolve those alerts.\n\n45\n00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.590\nWe've got that whole thing going on and\nwe've hinted at that,\n\n46\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.720\ntalked about it in some areas,\nin a little more depth in others.\n\n47\n00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.446\nAnd we have other Microsoft MCSC Cloud\nrelated shows that you may\n\n48\n00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:29.447\nwanna check out that go more in\ndepth into this particular concept.\n\n49\n00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:34.293\nThe 7246, and 7247 exam objectives\nare discussed in two different\n\n50\n00:02:34.293 --> 00:02:37.330\nclasses that will deal\nin more depth with this.\n\n51\n00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.798\nBut, here we just want to scratch\nthe surface a little bit and\n\n52\n00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:44.220\njust talk about the concepts\nassociated with this.\n\n53\n00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.920\nWe can report on and monitor\nservice levels for applications and\n\n54\n00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.510\nor the system overall.\n\n55\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.350\nWe can take that information break it\ndown by service level and the ability or\n\n56\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.870\nthe availability of that service\nagainst predefined goals.\n\n57\n00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.020\nWe can monitor for that.\n\n58\n00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.950\nAnd so, we talk a bit about that here and\nhow we can do this.\n\n59\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.120\nYou'll take a look when\nyou go out here and\n\n60\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.010\nwe define the service level objectives for\nan application.\n\n61\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.190\nHow do we deal with that?\n\n62\n00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.060\nWe could define them against a group.\n\n63\n00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.840\nWe talked about that group concept when I\nshowed you how to set up subscriptions and\n\n64\n00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.840\nnotifications and\npull a group in in order to do that.\n\n65\n00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.960\nRunning a service level tracking report.\n\n66\n00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.730\nHow do we go in and deal with that?\n\n67\n00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.566\nHow do we create a service\nlevel dashboard?\n\n68\n00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:26.000\nWe're gonna take a look at how to do some\ncustom dashboard work here in a minute.\n\n69\n00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.970\nBut if we click through and\n\n70\n00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.840\njust take a look at running the service\nlevel tracking report, for just a moment.\n\n71\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.092\nIt's pretty straight forward, we go in,\n\n72\n00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:37.606\nin the reporting space it says click on\nMicrosoft Service Level, Report Libraries.\n\n73\n00:03:37.606 --> 00:03:41.298\nSo, we have a library that's added\nthere based on the importation and\n\n74\n00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:42.863\nthe use of management packs,\n\n75\n00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:46.630\nand we do a service level tracking\nsummary report to be able to run that.\n\n76\n00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.570\nIt's just a name, report, and\nthe library, it's very straightforward.\n\n77\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.160\nWe go in, we add SLAs in,\nwe have them defined in other words.\n\n78\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.660\nWhen we create the immigration\nwith Service Level Manager, and\n\n79\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.610\nwe have all of the connections\nwe need to be able to do that,\n\n80\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.440\nthis information will become available.\n\n81\n00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.450\nWe'll have access to it.\n\n82\n00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.440\nSo, I just want to make sure we're\nthinking about the logic of this,\n\n83\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.760\nunderstanding how we can leverage this,\nand what we can do with it.\n\n84\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.390\nWe'll go in real quick,\nsince we're on the screen,\n\n85\n00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.660\njust bear with me here on second\nwhile we bring up our Ops console.\n\n86\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.360\nI think that's the right one, there we go.\n\n87\n00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.860\nAnd you'll see system center\ncore monitoring reports.\n\n88\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.100\nThey have basic reporting here\naround system center itself.\n\n89\n00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.420\nBut this is not the service level\nreporting we're talking about,\n\n90\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.740\nit's just basic reporting.\n\n91\n00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.370\nWe have to integrate with Service\nLevel Manager to see the other one.\n\n92\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.390\nWe don't have that\nintegration set up right now.\n\n93\n00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.240\nSo, you're not gonna see it,\n\n94\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.810\nbut it would be in this general area,\nit's alphabetized, and\n\n95\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.200\nwe'll see it right up under here in\nthis area in the reporting window.\n\n96\n00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.980\nAnd then, once we've done that, we can\nthen, as we have those connectors set up\n\n97\n00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.170\nand we link to SLM, drive those reports\nand interact with that capability.\n\n98\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.570\nSo, that's gonna give us\nsome nice value there.\n\n99\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.030\nRemember, we did talk about the fact that\nwe can create our own reports and we,\n\n100\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.610\nin the last episode, talked about\nusing Report Builder to do that.\n\n101\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.260\nAnd if we are authoring reports,\nas you can see here, we would refresh,\n\n102\n00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.730\nthere are no authored reports right now.\n\n103\n00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:02.630\nI haven't built any.\n\n104\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.150\nBut if we did, they would show up here,\nand we'd be able to see them.\n\n105\n00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.400\nWe also have favorite reports.\n\n106\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.758\nWe can mark reports as favorites,\nessentially like bookmarking them and\n\n107\n00:05:10.758 --> 00:05:13.090\ncreating just a customized\nview of them here.\n\n108\n00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.800\nSo we can do this, and\nwe've already talked about scheduling and\n\n109\n00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.360\nhow to interact with that.\n\n110\n00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.960\nWe've also wanted to mention or\n\n111\n00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.470\nat least just quickly talk about\nthe idea of interaction with SharePoint.\n\n112\n00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.400\nWe have a web part.\n\n113\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.223\nWe have many web parts,\nactually, with SharePoint.\n\n114\n00:05:25.223 --> 00:05:29.352\nBut, we do have a web part that will\nallow us to be able to interact with\n\n115\n00:05:29.352 --> 00:05:30.520\nOps Manager.\n\n116\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.648\nAnd have it walk through and interact with\nand discuss information with SharePoint,\n\n117\n00:05:34.648 --> 00:05:36.709\nput it up, and\ndisplay it in a dashboard and\n\n118\n00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:39.136\nmake it available to you\nif you wanna use it there.\n\n119\n00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:43.721\nWe copy the install Ops Manager\nDashboard Viewer PowerShell script that\n\n120\n00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:48.920\nis used to configure the web part and\nrun it so that we can then use it.\n\n121\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.080\nThere's actually two scripts.\n\n122\n00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.390\nWe need that one, and we need,\nI'm going to read this one to you,\n\n123\n00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.555\ncuz I can't remember the whole name,\n\n124\n00:05:53.555 --> 00:05:57.210\nMicrosoft.EnterpriseManagement.SharePoint-\nIntegration.WSP for\n\n125\n00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.200\nthe Windows PowerShell script files.\n\n126\n00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.700\nWe copy all of that from the Ops Manager\nMedia, put it into the SharePoint server,\n\n127\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.630\nwe run the PowerShell script,\nreferencing the .WSP file.\n\n128\n00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:16.400\nAnd then, the PowerShell script configures\nand loads up the SharePoint web part and\n\n129\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.850\nallows us to instantiate and\nset it up in the global assembly cache.\n\n130\n00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.200\nThe secured cache where we\nhost our SharePoint content.\n\n131\n00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.446\nIt's allowed to be used and we publish and\nmake it available, and then from there,\n\n132\n00:06:26.446 --> 00:06:29.782\nusing the SharePoint Management Shell,\nwe actually can go in and\n\n133\n00:06:29.782 --> 00:06:31.012\nwe are then able to run.\n\n134\n00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:32.195\nAnd if you can give me one second,\n\n135\n00:06:32.195 --> 00:06:34.370\nI'm gonna show you just\nwhat the script looks like.\n\n136\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.930\nHold on one second.\n\n137\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.790\nI just want to bring it up so\nthat I can show it to you.\n\n138\n00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.840\nBut I'll show you what\nthe PowerShell script is you\n\n139\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.910\nhave to run in\nthe SharePoint Management Shell.\n\n140\n00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.300\nIf you give me just a second to do that,\nI will be happy to show that to you.\n\n141\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.350\nI have it here, I just have to put it\nup in a form you can actually see it.\n\n142\n00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:56.160\nSo, give me one Shake of the mouse tail,\nas they say.\n\n143\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.800\nAnd I will be able to put\nthat right there for you.\n\n144\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.950\nOkay, just go ahead and bring it up,\nI just had to copy it, and\n\n145\n00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.080\nmake it big enough in the format so\nyou can see it.\n\n146\n00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.910\nSo, in the SharePoint Management Shell, we\nwould then go in on the SharePoint server.\n\n147\n00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.990\nMake sure we're in the directory\nwhere we've installed those\n\n148\n00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.720\nfiles that we're just talking about,\nthe script.\n\n149\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.130\nWe would then run this, install\nOps Manager Dashboard Viewer PS1 that will\n\n150\n00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.470\nbe the PowerShell script and then specify\nthe location of the copied files.\n\n151\n00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.100\nIt's best to be in the directory\nwhere the files are already,\n\n152\n00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.300\nthe copied files are the ones\nI just mentioned.\n\n153\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.360\nThat you would wanna have,\nthe .WSP file and\n\n154\n00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.320\nthe installation script and\nif we do that we then load this up.\n\n155\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.550\nIt configures it for us,\nwe have all of the information we need and\n\n156\n00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.610\nthen we're able to actually load\nthe SharePoint web part up, configure it.\n\n157\n00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.244\nOnce we've done all that, we're prompted\nto make sure we specify what SharePoint\n\n158\n00:07:53.244 --> 00:07:56.963\nsites we're going to combine this or\nput this web part up against.\n\n159\n00:07:56.963 --> 00:07:59.709\nSo, we just have to specify\nthat during the install.\n\n160\n00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:03.395\nAnd then, once we activate the web part,\nas we have do with any of the ones that we\n\n161\n00:08:03.395 --> 00:08:06.660\nuse, We use the central lab inside\nof SharePoint to be able to do that.\n\n162\n00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.410\nYou go in, you find it,\nyou click on it, activate.\n\n163\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.480\nOnce that is done,\n\n164\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.465\nin the site collection features\nwe'll be able to go in and do that.\n\n165\n00:08:13.465 --> 00:08:17.270\nWe're then able to go in and\nprogram in the functionality for\n\n166\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.620\nthe web part and connected up.\n\n167\n00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.560\nAnd actually display all that information.\n\n168\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.940\nSo if you wanna take a look at just\nmore or less the steps involved.\n\n169\n00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.540\nIf you go back here to the machine\nbear with me for me for just a second.\n\n170\n00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.440\nWe can point you to this and again this\nsure will all be in the show notes.\n\n171\n00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.160\nIf you're not familiar with SharePoint,\nif you haven't worked with it before.\n\n172\n00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.270\nSome of the things I just said\nabout global assembly cache,\n\n173\n00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.100\nabout running it in\nthe SharePoint management shell.\n\n174\n00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.350\nAnd going into the central admin site.\n\n175\n00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.760\nAnd going to the site collection and\nactivating the feature and\n\n176\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.090\nthe web part, that all may or\nmay not make sense to you.\n\n177\n00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:48.640\nNo big deal.\n\n178\n00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.850\nIf it doesn't,\nyou could read up on how to do it here.\n\n179\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.610\nIf it does, then you have a sense of what\nI'm talking about and the steps involved.\n\n180\n00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.762\nBut you can scroll down here,\nhow to deploy the ops manager web part.\n\n181\n00:08:57.762 --> 00:08:59.950\nI just walked through\npart of that with you.\n\n182\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.370\nHow to configure it with\na connection to web console,\n\n183\n00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.510\ntalked a bit about that as well.\n\n184\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.260\nHow to add it in to the SharePoint page,\nspoke a little bit about that.\n\n185\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.170\nHow to make sure we specify\nthe proper credentials for it.\n\n186\n00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.941\nHow to then set up\nthe additional environments.\n\n187\n00:09:12.941 --> 00:09:17.090\nAnd the URLs and the various\nconnections we need, all that's here.\n\n188\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.990\nSo you just go through this article,\nread through everything you need,\n\n189\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.430\nand all the steps are there.\n\n190\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.860\nAnd you'll be able to do everything\nyou need to do with no trouble.\n\n191\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.870\nAnd it will be a great way to\ninteract with and integrate this.\n\n192\n00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:33.740\nA lot of people that are using SCOM tend\nto use SharePoint in infrastructure.\n\n193\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.640\nSharePoint is a very\npopular product today.\n\n194\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.970\nEnterprise content\nmanagement being what it is.\n\n195\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.820\nSharePoint is one of the most\npopular products in this space.\n\n196\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.920\nIf not the most popular product\ndepending on who you talk to.\n\n197\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.480\nAnd certainly we see a lot\nof SharePoint deployment.\n\n198\n00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.068\nSharePoint is a great tool for\nleveraging information management and\n\n199\n00:09:51.068 --> 00:09:53.650\ndisplay of information\nfrom tools like these.\n\n200\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.070\nWeb parts like these and\nbringing them together.\n\n201\n00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.470\nWe're gonna show you\nan alternate variant on this.\n\n202\n00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.740\nThat you could build right in SCOM,\nwhich is a dashboard and\n\n203\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.170\na widget that can be used.\n\n204\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.810\nPerformance widget,\nthings like that to augment the dashboard.\n\n205\n00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.130\nIt's essentially like\na SharePoint dashboard.\n\n206\n00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.840\nAnd a SharePoint web part that\nwould display in SharePoint, but\n\n207\n00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.780\nyou run it in SCOM.\n\n208\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.480\nSo, if you're not running SharePoint.\n\n209\n00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.815\nIf you're not familiar with it.\n\n210\n00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:16.490\nIf you're not sure how to integrate it.\n\n211\n00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.230\nIf you don't own the rights to it\nin the sense that it's managed by\n\n212\n00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.330\na different group.\n\n213\n00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.700\nAnd I get this a lot with customers.\n\n214\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.600\nIt may be hard to get them to buy in\nto allow you to integrate the web part.\n\n215\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.230\nJust politics, and\nthings being what they are.\n\n216\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.930\nMaybe SharePoint is just\nnot gonna work for you.\n\n217\n00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.380\nI’ve got a solution for you.\n\n218\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.850\nIt’s no big deal.\nWe can do it either way.\n\n219\n00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.480\nSo, I am prepared as they say.\n\n220\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.100\nAnd we’re gonna show you,\nhow to do it, by showing you.\n\n221\n00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.730\nAnd I’m gonna do this,\n\n222\n00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.160\nwalk you through this, right now,\nin kind of a demo thought process.\n\n223\n00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.490\nI'm gonna show you, as soon as I\ntell you about the various parts,\n\n224\n00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.970\nI'll show you what a dashboard looks like.\n\n225\n00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.410\nI'm gonna show you how to actually go\nin and set up a performance dashboard.\n\n226\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.100\nOr different kinds of use in dashboards.\n\n227\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.905\nAnd show you what we can do if\nwe're not gonna rely on SharePoint.\n\n228\n00:10:52.905 --> 00:10:56.710\nBut it's always important to\nmake sure we're comfortable with\n\n229\n00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.170\nthe general thought process.\n\n230\n00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.980\nI'm just gonna refresh the timer on our\nlab environment while we're talking to\n\n231\n00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.420\nmake sure we don't run out of time.\n\n232\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.560\nWhile we're bringing up\nour environment here.\n\n233\n00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.575\nBut it's always important to be able\nto make sure that we have options.\n\n234\n00:11:07.575 --> 00:11:10.090\nBecause when you use a tool\nlike this you may say yeah,\n\n235\n00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.145\nSharePoint's the way I want to go.\n\n236\n00:11:12.145 --> 00:11:13.715\nAnd great we talked about\nthat thought process.\n\n237\n00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.095\nI'll go self serve that,\nfigure it out, works for me.\n\n238\n00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:18.515\nBut there's many of you\nthere that are thinking,\n\n239\n00:11:18.515 --> 00:11:21.845\nmy God SharePoint that's way too involved,\nthere's no way I can do that.\n\n240\n00:11:21.845 --> 00:11:23.515\nIsn't there another way?\n\n241\n00:11:23.515 --> 00:11:25.435\nAnd the answer is absolutely,\ndashboards and widgets.\n\n242\n00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:27.505\nSo, let's talk about\ndashboards a little bit.\n\n243\n00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:30.200\nYou know the idea with dashboards\nis very straight forward.\n\n244\n00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.450\nHow do we layout information\nin a graphical way.\n\n245\n00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.800\nThat allows us to consume interact with,\n\n246\n00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.840\nhopefully see updates in near real time or\nclose to real time.\n\n247\n00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.720\nOn a schedule and then interact with\nthat information in a graphical way so\n\n248\n00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.380\nwe can make decisions.\n\n249\n00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.900\nThis is what a dashboard does.\n\n250\n00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.790\nRegardless of where we host or\nregardless of where we put it.\n\n251\n00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.410\nSo we have dashboard\ntemplates that can be used.\n\n252\n00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.450\nThat provide essentially pre-made methods\nto group our data together, set it up, and\n\n253\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.965\nconfigure it.\n\n254\n00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.055\nWe then display them in the dashboard.\n\n255\n00:11:58.055 --> 00:12:01.845\nWe control the layout of how we\nput information into the dashboard\n\n256\n00:12:01.845 --> 00:12:04.825\nwith either a column layout or\na grid layout.\n\n257\n00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:07.705\nColumn layout's think about how\nmany columns are we gonna stack up.\n\n258\n00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:11.155\nWe could have up to five columns into\nthe dashboard so imagine the screen,\n\n259\n00:12:11.155 --> 00:12:13.095\nup to five individual columns.\n\n260\n00:12:13.095 --> 00:12:15.875\nA grid layout think of a grid,\na X Y axis, right.\n\n261\n00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:18.585\nAnd I always think about Battleship,\nwhen I think about a grid or\n\n262\n00:12:18.585 --> 00:12:19.900\nMinesweeper or either one.\n\n263\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.518\nWe going to up nine cells.\n\n264\n00:12:21.518 --> 00:12:24.620\nNine individual boxes\nessentially reporting on and\n\n265\n00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.340\nupdating different functionality.\n\n266\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.900\nIn that mastered grid if you will,\nup to nine in the grid view.\n\n267\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.842\nWe have a service level dashboard.\n\n268\n00:12:30.842 --> 00:12:32.355\nDeals with service related stuff and\n\n269\n00:12:32.355 --> 00:12:34.946\na summary dashboard it kind of\ndoes an overview of everything.\n\n270\n00:12:34.946 --> 00:12:37.793\nAnd we used what are called\nwidgets to display and\n\n271\n00:12:37.793 --> 00:12:40.576\ninteract with information\non the dashboards.\n\n272\n00:12:40.576 --> 00:12:43.010\nAnd we have six different widget types.\n\n273\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.330\nWe have alerts, details, instance detail.\n\n274\n00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.230\nA little drill down on details\na little bit more specific to just one\n\n275\n00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.590\ninstance of a particular item.\n\n276\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.840\nSLA, service level agreement,\n\n277\n00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.370\nso linked to the service level dashboard,\nperformance and state.\n\n278\n00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:01.350\nAnd so we're gonna be able to use\nthese combinations to be able to\n\n279\n00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.040\ninteract with data.\n\n280\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.400\nLet's take a look at some of these,\njust at a high level.\n\n281\n00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.260\nAnd then we'll go in and\n\n282\n00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.140\nwe'll start to drill down a little\nbit on some more of the details.\n\n283\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.380\nSo when we're in here,\nwe're gonna go over to Monitoring.\n\n284\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.820\nAnd you could see right\nhere that I actually have\n\n285\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.250\na dashboard that's been just set up.\n\n286\n00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.410\nThat's out of the box by default,\nthis is not one that I've created.\n\n287\n00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.200\nWe're gonna take a look how to do\na custom one here in just a minute.\n\n288\n00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.520\nBut this one, it's just a basic one that\nallows us to see a pre-made application.\n\n289\n00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.390\nI've created a distributed application,\na three tiered app.\n\n290\n00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.270\nWe talked about how to do\nthis in prior episodes.\n\n291\n00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.530\nI didn't bother to walk you through the\nsteps this time, I just preloaded it, so\n\n292\n00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.970\nwe'll have it available.\n\n293\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.390\nSet it up, saved using the application,\nthe creation template for\n\n294\n00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.070\nthe three tier app.\n\n295\n00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:43.940\nAnd then I just saved, and\n\n296\n00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:48.870\nthen I just went in and pulled it up\nhere inside application monitoring.\n\n297\n00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.070\nIf we can go full screen just so\nyou could see where I am.\n\n298\n00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.960\nYou see, I'm in here under monitoring.\n\n299\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.490\nAnd I'm up near the top right,\nalphabetical.\n\n300\n00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.640\nI'm in the application monitoring folder.\n\n301\n00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.015\nI'm on applications.\n\n302\n00:13:59.015 --> 00:14:02.951\nThe only application I currently have\nlisted, as you can see, is the the three\n\n303\n00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:07.815\ntier application called ITPROTV Tier or\nTest Tier 3 that I created.\n\n304\n00:14:07.815 --> 00:14:12.885\nAnd with it highlighted I see that I\nhave a four column view right here.\n\n305\n00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:14.500\nRemember we can have up to five columns.\n\n306\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.525\nI have a four column view and\nI've also got down below.\n\n307\n00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.460\nMy Service Level Agreement\napplication helped that select.\n\n308\n00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.400\nNone of this is populated right now.\n\n309\n00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.440\nI just created the basic app.\n\n310\n00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.740\nI didn't bother to set up any\nof the back end optimized\n\n311\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.370\nmanagement data collection reporting, etc.\n\n312\n00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.500\nBut I'm just showing you what\na traditional default view may look like.\n\n313\n00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.480\nAnd then what we can do\nwith this application.\n\n314\n00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.770\nAnd you'll see, if I just scroll\nback up so we can highlight,\n\n315\n00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.160\nyou'll see with it highlight here.\n\n316\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.940\nI have all the different views.\n\n317\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.610\nI have a diagram view,\nevent view, performance view.\n\n318\n00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.000\nI have my Application Summary Dashboard\nand Network Vicinity Dashboard,\n\n319\n00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.270\ndifferent dashboards.\n\n320\n00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.460\nI've also got a couple of other items\nI'm gonna show you in a minute.\n\n321\n00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.080\nBut let's do the application\nsummary dashboard.\n\n322\n00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.330\nAnd let's just take look real quick.\n\n323\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.880\nSo we'll click on that and\n\n324\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.796\nyou'll see that we have our grid\nview with our different widgets.\n\n325\n00:15:05.796 --> 00:15:07.670\nThis is just another view\nwe're talking about right.\n\n326\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.360\nWe have potentially up to nine\nof them are in the default view.\n\n327\n00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.920\nAnd you'll see we have\ndistributed app components and\n\n328\n00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.430\nsince it's monitored\naverage response time etc.\n\n329\n00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.160\nAnd again,\nwe're not running the app right now.\n\n330\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.070\nIt hasn't been published.\n\n331\n00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.230\nWe're not doing anything with it.\n\n332\n00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.853\nNo data here, but just showing you\nwhat the view would look like,\n\n333\n00:15:23.853 --> 00:15:24.668\njust generically.\n\n334\n00:15:24.668 --> 00:15:27.160\nThis is after all,\nwe're talking about dashboards.\n\n335\n00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.290\nWe're not necessarily talking about\nmonitoring in this particular episode.\n\n336\n00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.914\nYou want to see more about\nthe monitoring and look into all that,\n\n337\n00:15:32.914 --> 00:15:35.063\nremember we've done episodes\nabout that already.\n\n338\n00:15:35.063 --> 00:15:38.664\nWe've done our end-to-end monitoring and\nservice monitoring,\n\n339\n00:15:38.664 --> 00:15:40.890\ndistributed application discussions.\n\n340\n00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.880\nPrior episodes, just go back and\ntake a look at those.\n\n341\n00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.330\nAnd then you'll get a sense of\nwhat those things look like.\n\n342\n00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.900\nI am gonna put a custom dashboard up.\n\n343\n00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.780\nSo we'll do a little smithing and\nwork under the hood here, in a minute.\n\n344\n00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.680\nBut I just wanted to show you\nthe basic idea of what these grids and\n\n345\n00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.150\ncolumn views look like.\n\n346\n00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.320\nDo you want to jump in and\nsay something there?\n\n347\n00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:56.820\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No?\n\n348\n00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.580\nI thought you, you looked\n\n349\n00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.222\nlike you had that.\n\n350\n00:15:58.222 --> 00:15:58.806\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I want a make\n\n351\n00:15:58.806 --> 00:15:59.482\na comment look on your face.\n\n352\n00:15:59.482 --> 00:16:00.678\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You did,\n\n353\n00:16:00.678 --> 00:16:01.899\nmaybe you were just\npondering something else.\n\n354\n00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:03.796\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] what do you think about?\n\n355\n00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:07.253\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking I want a ten column\ndashboard by a four grid view, and\n\n356\n00:16:07.253 --> 00:16:08.253\nhow can we do that?\n\n357\n00:16:08.253 --> 00:16:12.827\n&gt;&gt; It is pretty cool that you are able to\ndo this though within here they allow you\n\n358\n00:16:12.827 --> 00:16:17.545\nto create these custom dashboards because\nI like customizable things, I like\n\n359\n00:16:17.545 --> 00:16:22.047\nbeing able to say this is exactly what I\nexpect to see when I do this option and\n\n360\n00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:24.940\nit makes my workflow a whole lot easier.\n\n361\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:30.850\nAnd yeah you can get used to out of\nthe box options they can give you but\n\n362\n00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:35.520\nstill you can, for years even stumble over\nthings that you don't find intuitive,\n\n363\n00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.510\nbeing able to make a custom,\nmakes it always intuitive for you.\n\n364\n00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.704\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n365\n00:16:41.704 --> 00:16:42.880\nIntuitive's a great way to think about it.\n\n366\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.428\nIt makes it usable, right?\n\n367\n00:16:44.428 --> 00:16:48.030\nAnd intuitive and usable are essentially,\nin my mind, synonymous with one another.\n\n368\n00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.170\nBut it makes it approachable and usable.\n\n369\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.680\nAnd not just for you, because the secret\nof this tool, we talked about this in\n\n370\n00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.298\na prior episode with subscriptions and\nbeing able to give data to individuals,\n\n371\n00:16:57.298 --> 00:17:00.603\nmaybe a senior manager, somebody who\nneeds to consume it a certain way.\n\n372\n00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:04.917\nWe often, as IT professionals,\nas people that manages infrastructure,\n\n373\n00:17:04.917 --> 00:17:08.960\nthink I'm using it, it's gotta be\nusable for me and I have to know it.\n\n374\n00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.930\nAnd Daniel's absolutely right,\nthat is important.\n\n375\n00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.770\nBut I tend to think about that and\nbroaden that and\n\n376\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:17.260\nsay we've gotta translate that usability\nfrom our perspective into the consumers of\n\n377\n00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.690\nthe information that are gonna be using\nthe systems we manage, because a tool\n\n378\n00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:25.250\nlike this is really not about, just\nthis little amount of it is about okay,\n\n379\n00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.750\nlet's actually set it up,\nget the data, and get it flowing.\n\n380\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.260\nThat's really important piece.\n\n381\n00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.443\nBut really the value of this tool to\nthe organization is about what you do with\n\n382\n00:17:32.443 --> 00:17:34.696\nthat data after it's sitting\nin the data warehouse.\n\n383\n00:17:34.696 --> 00:17:39.844\nAnd sitting in the operations database\nbecause then we start to do reporting,\n\n384\n00:17:39.844 --> 00:17:44.212\nquerying, interaction with\nconsumption of an analysis of data,\n\n385\n00:17:44.212 --> 00:17:47.610\nthat's where we draw\ndown tremendous value.\n\n386\n00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.010\nAnd so it's extending that usability and\n\n387\n00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.380\nthat intuitiveness, right,\nout to the other users in the community\n\n388\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.070\nthat becomes equally\nimportant as part of our job.\n\n389\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.830\nAt least from my perspective I think\nthat's gonna be something that's important\n\n390\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.890\nfor me to focus on.\n\n391\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:03.190\nSo we go back to what we were looking at\njust to continue the conversation here.\n\n392\n00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.910\nWanted to show you off to the side,\n\n393\n00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.270\nit's kinda hard to see because\nthey're kind of buried here.\n\n394\n00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.440\nI do have them open, so I'm gonna\npoint them out to you in a minute.\n\n395\n00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.860\nBut in some of our earliest episodes,\nright, and we continued throughout many of\n\n396\n00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.590\nthe episodes to refer to the different\nconsoles that are available and we've\n\n397\n00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.230\ntalked a lot about the ops console, the\nweb console we've shown you extensively.\n\n398\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.684\nThe ops console we're doing pretty\nmuch every demo looking at it.\n\n399\n00:18:24.684 --> 00:18:26.954\nYou've seen the web console\nin either prior episodes and\n\n400\n00:18:26.954 --> 00:18:30.229\ncertainly we talked about in the future\nepisodes, you could see it there as well.\n\n401\n00:18:30.229 --> 00:18:35.226\nBut although we talked about them briefly,\nhaven't really shown you the application\n\n402\n00:18:35.226 --> 00:18:38.040\nadvisor or\napplication diagnostics consoles.\n\n403\n00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.010\nI mentioned them,\n\n404\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.100\nwe've taken a look at them in some prior\nepisodes quickly kinda here and there.\n\n405\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.320\nBut I wanted to just\nbring them back up and\n\n406\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.630\nshow then to you since we have\nthe application up and running.\n\n407\n00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.770\nAnd if you haven't seen the end to end\nmonitoring discussions we've done,\n\n408\n00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.110\ncould you go back and take a look.\n\n409\n00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.320\nYou may not have seen these.\n\n410\n00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.920\nSo when we do highlight the application,\nwe could do it from, in this view,\n\n411\n00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.660\ncan actually do it from,\nif we just close out of here.\n\n412\n00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.920\nJust get out of here real quick.\n\n413\n00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.020\nJust come right back here, we could\nsee they're still up here under task.\n\n414\n00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.820\nThey're in the same area.\n\n415\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.150\nIt's just the matter of\nbeing on the applications.\n\n416\n00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.150\nSo we can launch them specific to the app.\n\n417\n00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.390\nDoesn't really matter where we are.\n\n418\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.540\nWe could be a different views,\nwe still see it.\n\n419\n00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.770\nBut once we highlight the app,\nwe can launch this.\n\n420\n00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.440\nNow, I already launched them, so I'm just\ngonna bring them up and show them to you.\n\n421\n00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.594\nBut before I do that because\na picture is worth a thousand words.\n\n422\n00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:23.234\nSo let me go back and take a look.\n\n423\n00:19:23.234 --> 00:19:27.050\nRemember we talked about the fact that\nour consoles are typically sitting out\n\n424\n00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:27.820\nhere, right?\n\n425\n00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.943\nAnd they're connecting back into\nthe management servers, right?\n\n426\n00:19:30.943 --> 00:19:34.715\nThey're not necessarily going direct, it\nmay go through a network, there's always\n\n427\n00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:38.660\ndifferent ways they'll connect in and out,\nbut ultimately they're gonna come back in.\n\n428\n00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.970\nWe're gonna see data here.\n\n429\n00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.520\nRemember, this is a general approximation,\nnot a specific\n\n430\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.097\ndiagram that shows actual connectivity\npaths, ports, things like that.\n\n431\n00:19:47.097 --> 00:19:50.480\nSo just a very generic diagram,\nit shows its basic functionality.\n\n432\n00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.870\nBut were lumping those other consoles\nthat I'm talking about up here\n\n433\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.020\neven though they're not listed.\n\n434\n00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.030\nAnd I made this point,\nwhen we first demoed the diagram for you,\n\n435\n00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.690\nbrought it out one of the very first steps\nwe did, around architecture and overview.\n\n436\n00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.640\nAnd we referred to it\nmany times since then.\n\n437\n00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.650\nSo I just wanna remind you\nthe fact that all those consoles\n\n438\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:07.970\nare gonna be available to you.\n\n439\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.007\nLet's take a look at\ntwo of them right now.\n\n440\n00:20:10.007 --> 00:20:12.980\nSo if we just come down here, or\nactually we'll leave that right there,\n\n441\n00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.580\nI should say.\n\n442\n00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.820\nLet's just come down here,\nget our taskbar.\n\n443\n00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.230\nAnd I've got them already opened up,\nas you can see down here.\n\n444\n00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:24.430\nThe application advisor, and\nthe application diagnostics consoles.\n\n445\n00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.930\nWe could see both of them here.\n\n446\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.780\nWe can open up.\n\n447\n00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.160\nYou just click on it,\nopens up in the website,\n\n448\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.930\nopens up the appropriate portal and\nloads it.\n\n449\n00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.970\nGotta make sure you have\nSilverlight loaded.\n\n450\n00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.040\nWe've dealt with Silverlight.\n\n451\n00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.287\nYou saw me when we're doing all the\ninstalls of all the different products and\n\n452\n00:20:38.287 --> 00:20:41.618\nwe had a load server light up to\nget the app console working and\n\n453\n00:20:41.618 --> 00:20:43.929\nto get some of the other consoles loaded.\n\n454\n00:20:43.929 --> 00:20:46.145\nSo you just wanna make sure you have that,\nassuming it's there,\n\n455\n00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:47.390\nit should be no problem.\n\n456\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.538\nIf it doesn't load up right away,\n\n457\n00:20:48.538 --> 00:20:50.790\ngive an error it's usually that,\ngo back and install it.\n\n458\n00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.158\nThere's a prompt that pops up,\nit'll pop up with no trouble.\n\n459\n00:20:53.158 --> 00:20:55.030\nAnd you could see once we come in here,\n\n460\n00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:59.150\nwe've got client side monitoring under\ndifferent reports that are available here.\n\n461\n00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.611\nMaybe we can go full screen just to\nmake it a little bit easier to see.\n\n462\n00:21:01.611 --> 00:21:05.460\nCuz I know they're kinda small and I can't\nreally make them any bigger in this view.\n\n463\n00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.310\nProblem analysis reports.\n\n464\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.362\nResource utilization analysis.\n\n465\n00:21:09.362 --> 00:21:13.330\nWe have all these different areas\nthat we can go click on here and\n\n466\n00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.860\njust whichever one we click on,\nit allows us to load up a report.\n\n467\n00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.080\nAnd so the App Advisor allows\nus to be able to go in,\n\n468\n00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.820\ninteract with and\nlook at recommendations and\n\n469\n00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.970\nsee all sorts of different stuff\nhere that we have available.\n\n470\n00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:33.590\nSo we can load up a specific report, get\nrecommendations on a variety of things.\n\n471\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.930\nWe have tools here.\n\n472\n00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.040\nWe can schedule.\n\n473\n00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.350\nWe can make and mark something available.\n\n474\n00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.757\nWe can go ahead and essentially just\ngroup together our information,\n\n475\n00:21:41.757 --> 00:21:43.120\nhow we wanna mange it.\n\n476\n00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.969\nSo, the app advisor is like a subset\nspecialty portal that uses reporting to\n\n477\n00:21:47.969 --> 00:21:52.368\ndrill down and really give guidance\nrecommendations on performance\n\n478\n00:21:52.368 --> 00:21:56.689\nrelated issues and optimization,\nand errors that are occurring,\n\n479\n00:21:56.689 --> 00:22:00.205\nand how we may then be able to\ndeal with them as a result.\n\n480\n00:22:00.205 --> 00:22:04.627\nWe can see if we click on just\ngenerically, one of these,\n\n481\n00:22:04.627 --> 00:22:08.150\nwe go in, application failure analysis.\n\n482\n00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.700\nWe can go in and run a data sweep,\nit'll get and pull data in,\n\n483\n00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.880\nand display it in a format that looks\nlike this to show us information.\n\n484\n00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.593\nWe would specify a time range here.\n\n485\n00:22:18.593 --> 00:22:22.190\nAnd then, apply it and\nthen we'll get back something.\n\n486\n00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.740\nI don't have any data\nsource selected here, and\n\n487\n00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:28.070\nI don't have actual data sitting\nthat I can pull right now.\n\n488\n00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.960\nBut you get the idea.\n\n489\n00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.840\nYou would run it and\nwe would get back this report.\n\n490\n00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.820\n&gt;&gt; Adam, you don't have a full\nnetwork sitting around, just so\n\n491\n00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.540\nyou can pull data from it.\n\n492\n00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.650\n&gt;&gt; I don't have all that just sitting\naround, waiting to go unfortunately.\n\n493\n00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.760\nBut you could see here, this is what\nthe report does look like and so\n\n494\n00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.290\nwe'd be able to use this portal.\n\n495\n00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.880\nWe can also use the application\ndiagnostics portal\n\n496\n00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.140\nwhich is the other one that's launched or\navailable here.\n\n497\n00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:50.169\nThe console I should say cuz they're\nreally consoles and when we load them up.\n\n498\n00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:56.090\nYou'll see here, that we can go in and\nwe can again search for\n\n499\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.080\nvarious items it says,\nall here by default.\n\n500\n00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.730\nWe can go in, look for applications errors\nand/or performance related information\n\n501\n00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.950\none or both group by name, right.\n\n502\n00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.879\nSpecify event data information.\n\n503\n00:23:08.879 --> 00:23:12.099\nWe have, as you could see aspects here.\n\n504\n00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:15.265\nAnd we can pull this open and\nspecify Security,\n\n505\n00:23:15.265 --> 00:23:19.750\nPerformance, Application Failure,\nand/or Connectivity.\n\n506\n00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.820\nSo we can look at these and\ninteract with them and order them.\n\n507\n00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:27.187\nAnd we have to specify Event ID, so\nwe will be able to put in an event ID,\n\n508\n00:23:27.187 --> 00:23:29.275\nwhatever that event ID might be.\n\n509\n00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:32.526\nAnd then we can drill through\nthe information that's coming in,\n\n510\n00:23:32.526 --> 00:23:35.560\npull in those events and\nstart to correlate it here.\n\n511\n00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.890\nWe've mentioned certain event ID's\nin various discussions we've had.\n\n512\n00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.240\nAbout hey, when you install,\nif you get this event ID, it means this.\n\n513\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.450\nIf you see this error code, it means this.\n\n514\n00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.880\nWe've given you some little small\ninclination, an idea about those.\n\n515\n00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.590\nBut certainly, I have not gone through\nan exhaustive list, cuz there's many,\n\n516\n00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.420\nmany of them.\n\n517\n00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.570\nBut you would see event IDs or\nbe able to Google for them, read up\n\n518\n00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.612\non the documentation on the product and\ninteract with them, and you would then be\n\n519\n00:23:58.612 --> 00:24:02.430\nable to bring them in and search for\nthem here, if we were doing it by events.\n\n520\n00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.625\nYou could also search here, interact with,\n\n521\n00:24:05.625 --> 00:24:09.422\njust let me click on\nthe workspace to change the area.\n\n522\n00:24:09.422 --> 00:24:11.119\nSpecify here, there we go,\n\n523\n00:24:11.119 --> 00:24:15.875\nspecify applications, I did click, yet\nI clicked and it just went right back.\n\n524\n00:24:15.875 --> 00:24:19.738\nSo you could see here we can go in and\nwe can specify applications,\n\n525\n00:24:19.738 --> 00:24:22.910\nwe can put in information for\ncertain applications.\n\n526\n00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:23.710\nAnd if you look at,\n\n527\n00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.826\nif we can go full screen you can see\nthe headers up top there in the columns.\n\n528\n00:24:26.826 --> 00:24:30.945\nYou could see what kind of\ninformation we would draw in.\n\n529\n00:24:30.945 --> 00:24:34.412\nThe name of the app, statistics over the\nlast hour, monitor request, average time,\n\n530\n00:24:34.412 --> 00:24:34.941\nexception.\n\n531\n00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:39.980\nPerformance events, number of servers and\nprocesses, your current load.\n\n532\n00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.790\nSo we can do all of this and we would\nspecify under Sources here, our elements.\n\n533\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:48.950\nWe'd have to obviously have elements\ndefined that we can use as a data source.\n\n534\n00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.310\nAnd we can either go in and\n\n535\n00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:54.530\nspecify current or time and\ngo back on a certain value range.\n\n536\n00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:59.940\nWe can go to Computers here as well, and\nunder Computers we could specify and\n\n537\n00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.080\nview either configuration or\nresolution utilization.\n\n538\n00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.815\nAnd again we could specify here,\nwe've have to have elements created and\n\n539\n00:25:07.815 --> 00:25:08.969\nenabled for us to use.\n\n540\n00:25:08.969 --> 00:25:13.710\nAnd then we would apply and\nsee information being brought in.\n\n541\n00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.106\nSo it would allow us to be able to go in.\n\n542\n00:25:16.106 --> 00:25:23.800\nWe could go in and we can use these\nportals or these consoles, right?\n\n543\n00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.140\nTo be able to drill down and\ndo a more deeper dive\n\n544\n00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.390\non certain aspects of the information that\nwe're seeing here for the application.\n\n545\n00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.255\nSo we can see them and\ninteract with them right from here.\n\n546\n00:25:34.255 --> 00:25:36.623\nWhich is also nice cuz, again,\nyou may not get to see those consoles.\n\n547\n00:25:36.623 --> 00:25:38.420\nAnd if you don't know they're there,\n\n548\n00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.690\ntrip over them off in the corner\nlike you were suggesting.\n\n549\n00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.190\nWe may not realize they’re there or\nmay not even know how to launch them\n\n550\n00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.670\nunless somebody tells us,\nhey, go look for them.\n\n551\n00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.994\nThe only issue I have and\nit’s not a big one, but just in general.\n\n552\n00:25:49.994 --> 00:25:54.115\nThe only issue I have with the tool\ninterface, meaning the ops console.\n\n553\n00:25:54.115 --> 00:25:58.275\nIt's a little busy, there's so\nmuch going on all the time.\n\n554\n00:25:58.275 --> 00:26:01.945\nIf you're not really paying attention\nto the work area under Tasks.\n\n555\n00:26:01.945 --> 00:26:05.325\nWhich is contextual and\nit does change when we click on things.\n\n556\n00:26:05.325 --> 00:26:09.505\nYou could miss so much stuff because it\nis buried two, three, four layers deep.\n\n557\n00:26:09.505 --> 00:26:10.645\nYou just don't realize it's there.\n\n558\n00:26:10.645 --> 00:26:12.568\nMy point,\nlet me just show you something here.\n\n559\n00:26:12.568 --> 00:26:15.945\nIf I go into .NET monitoring,\nand under .NET monitoring,\n\n560\n00:26:15.945 --> 00:26:18.740\nI go to Monitored Applications here,\nall right.\n\n561\n00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.166\nThis area changes dramatically, right?\n\n562\n00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:24.618\nAnd if I go in here,\nI go to Active Alerts,\n\n563\n00:26:24.618 --> 00:26:28.205\nthis area is essentially very\nsimilar to the one we just saw.\n\n564\n00:26:28.205 --> 00:26:30.420\nBut we have a subscription\nitem down below.\n\n565\n00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:38.640\nBut if I come up here and I look at\nWindows computers, and we highlight.\n\n566\n00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.310\nAnd you'll see that now this\nwhole area has changed yet again.\n\n567\n00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:46.140\nI have actions to start maintenance mode.\n\n568\n00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.600\nI can go in and\nlook at the Health Explorer.\n\n569\n00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.138\nI can come down and\nsee a group of tasks specific to Windows.\n\n570\n00:26:52.138 --> 00:26:57.150\nI have a whole bunch of report tasks that\nare specific to this particular item.\n\n571\n00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.289\nSo everything is changing all the time,\nright?\n\n572\n00:26:59.289 --> 00:27:03.311\nAnd that's just, for me anyway,\nkind of the confusing thing a little bit.\n\n573\n00:27:03.311 --> 00:27:06.790\nBecause sometimes it's hard to\nkeep track of where things are and\n\n574\n00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:10.330\nwhat I wanna do and it may be hard for\nme to understand that.\n\n575\n00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.942\nOne of the nice little hidden gems\njust since we're here real quick for\n\n576\n00:27:12.942 --> 00:27:14.720\nwhat we do, the customized dashboard.\n\n577\n00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.388\nLet's look at the Health Explorer.\n\n578\n00:27:15.388 --> 00:27:16.964\nSo we can bring this up.\n\n579\n00:27:16.964 --> 00:27:19.800\nAnd haven't really showed\nthis to you before.\n\n580\n00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.682\nBut the Health Explorer\nallows us to drill down and\n\n581\n00:27:22.682 --> 00:27:25.088\nsee the information that's available.\n\n582\n00:27:25.088 --> 00:27:26.015\nAnd drill in and\n\n583\n00:27:26.015 --> 00:27:30.230\nsee what's going on with it specific\nto the item we just highlighted.\n\n584\n00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:35.790\nSo here, ManagementConfiguration,\nyeah we could drill in, take a look.\n\n585\n00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.010\nWe could see a summary and\ninformation about it.\n\n586\n00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:40.090\nWe can link to alerts that may be there.\n\n587\n00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:41.349\nWe could see state changes and\n\n588\n00:27:41.349 --> 00:27:44.279\nthe history of the state changes\nwhen they occurred and what went on.\n\n589\n00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:47.267\nWe went from it looks like\nwarning to good, right?\n\n590\n00:27:47.267 --> 00:27:50.455\nThen it looks we went from error\nto warning, and good back and\n\n591\n00:27:50.455 --> 00:27:52.155\nforth bouncing around.\n\n592\n00:27:52.155 --> 00:27:55.945\nAnd so as we highlight, we may or\nmay not have information or\n\n593\n00:27:55.945 --> 00:27:57.800\ncontext around around one of these.\n\n594\n00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.505\nBut we can click through and\nwe can see each one,\n\n595\n00:28:00.505 --> 00:28:03.422\nhelps us to better understand\nwhat may be going on.\n\n596\n00:28:03.422 --> 00:28:07.202\nAnd I can cross reference alerts\nright off the Health Explorer,\n\n597\n00:28:07.202 --> 00:28:09.140\ndrill in and see all the alerts.\n\n598\n00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:13.540\nAgain, all the management of data,\nthe reporting, the information and\n\n599\n00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.650\nthe interaction of that information\nis very rich in detail.\n\n600\n00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:20.810\nBut sometimes, it's a little too much,\na little too rich, a little too detailed.\n\n601\n00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:25.290\nFor me, I really have to stop and\nconsider carefully what I wanna know.\n\n602\n00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.890\nAnd really resolve or think through\nin my mind the best way to get there.\n\n603\n00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:29.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no lack of data,\n\n604\n00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.970\njust got to figure out where\nthe heck they're hiding the thing.\n\n605\n00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.280\n&gt;&gt; An overwhelming abundance\nof data actually is actually\n\n606\n00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.320\n&gt;&gt; An embarrassment of riches.\n\n607\n00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.580\n&gt;&gt; An embarrassment of riches, exactly.\n\n608\n00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.730\nLet's take a look at how to get\nthat dashboard up and running.\n\n609\n00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.124\nDo you think we have\nenough time to do this?\n\n610\n00:28:43.124 --> 00:28:45.254\nShould we make this say a new-\n&gt;&gt; Depends on how long you\n\n611\n00:28:45.254 --> 00:28:45.860\nthink it'll take.\n\n612\n00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.234\n&gt;&gt; Longer than you probably want it to.\n\n613\n00:28:47.234 --> 00:28:48.028\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well then we will.\n\n614\n00:28:48.028 --> 00:28:51.523\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That's the great thing\n\n615\n00:28:51.523 --> 00:28:52.672\nabout doing the show.\n\n616\n00:28:52.672 --> 00:28:54.979\nIf we need a part three,\nwe do a part three, and\n\n617\n00:28:54.979 --> 00:28:56.650\nyou guys get the benefit of that.\n\n618\n00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.240\nSo Adam, I look forward to\nseeing you in part three.\n\n619\n00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.830\nLook forward to seeing our\ngood viewer there as well.\n\n620\n00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.110\nAs for this episode,\nlooks like we've come to the end.\n\n621\n00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:07.150\nThanks for watching, and signing off for\nITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n622\n00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:07.980\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n623\n00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n624\n00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.780\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n625\n00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:17.283\n[MUSIC]\n\n626\n00:29:17.283 --> 00:29:18.965\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.181\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:12.071\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:13.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.900\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.010\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we're back with more on\n\n8\n00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.720\nour data center monitoring with Microsoft\nSCOM series and joining us back in for\n\n9\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.930\npart three, I know you're gonna love it,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.420\nAdam, how's it going today, man?\n\n11\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.955\nThat's right he's heralding\nit with his fingers.\n\n12\n00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:36.410\n[LAUGH] They're celebrating.\n\n13\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.470\n&gt;&gt; Part 3.\n[LAUGH] Not Part 2.\n\n14\n00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.770\n&gt;&gt; Not Part 2.\n&gt;&gt; Not Part 4, but Part 3.\n\n15\n00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.670\n&gt;&gt; The best part.\n\n16\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.790\n&gt;&gt; Did that without screwing it up.\n\n17\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.580\n&gt;&gt; You did great.\n\n18\n00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.580\n&gt;&gt; Could be Part 5 but only if we do\nPart 3 first then Part 4 afterwards.\n\n19\n00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.780\nAll right, so\nwe're going to talk some more.\n\n20\n00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.890\nWe left off right at the last episode.\n\n21\n00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.410\nWe're about to get in there and show\nyou some dashboards and some views, and\n\n22\n00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.260\nDavid said no\n&gt;&gt; We're out of time, can't do it.\n\n23\n00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.020\nActually, I said that.\n\n24\n00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.680\nHe agreed with me.\n\n25\n00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.200\nIt's my fault,\ncuz I said we're out of time.\n\n26\n00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.340\nBut we are gonna pick back\nup where we left off.\n\n27\n00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.500\nWe're gonna jump back in.\n\n28\n00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.470\nI'll show you that long anticipated,\nlong talked about,\n\n29\n00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.280\noften underrated discussion about\nhow to set up views and dashboards.\n\n30\n00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.020\nI showed you a little bit about\nthis in the last couple episodes.\n\n31\n00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.280\nWe hinted at some things.\n\n32\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.250\nTook a look at what\na dashboard looks like.\n\n33\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.480\nTalked about the columnar view,\nthe grid view.\n\n34\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.990\nTalked about different\nways we can see data,\n\n35\n00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.850\nbut we didn’t actually look at how we\ncan go ahead, and create one on our own.\n\n36\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.820\nWe just looked at some,\nprepackaged ones, if you will.\n\n37\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.460\nOnes that come in with\nthe management packs.\n\n38\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.360\nWe’re gonna go ahead and go under\nthe hood, and show you how to do this.\n\n39\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.750\nNow, there are a few\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n40\n00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.130\nWe’re gonna use the console.\n\n41\n00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.410\nWe’re gonna create them from there.\n\n42\n00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.430\nBut we have two consoles.\n\n43\n00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.870\nWe have, remember, the apps console,\n\n44\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.040\nwhich is where we spend\nthe majority of our time.\n\n45\n00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.740\nWe also have the web console,\nit has been solely under utilised and\n\n46\n00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.060\nsolely underrepresented here\nin our discussions today.\n\n47\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.900\nIt's actually my fault more\nthan any body's else because\n\n48\n00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.900\nI have showed it to you.\n\n49\n00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.230\nBut we are gonna take a look at it,\nwe are gonna go in and\n\n50\n00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.790\nshare what web console looks like.\n\n51\n00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.020\nIn case you haven't seen it,\nit's important to do that.\n\n52\n00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.770\nIt is a stripped down\nversion of the OPSCONSOLE,\n\n53\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.060\nprimary focus there is looking at existing\nmonitoring, although we can use the hey,\n\n54\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.640\nlet's create a custom dashboard\nview option in there and\n\n55\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.570\nactually create dashboard\nright from there.\n\n56\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.080\nSo, we're gonna use that to\nsee the alternate flip side\n\n57\n00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.370\nof how we do dashboard creation.\n\n58\n00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.160\nWe'll do both.\n\n59\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.190\nWe'll see it shows up in one,\nimmediately shows up in the other.\n\n60\n00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.560\nIn addition, although I'm not\ngonna demo it for you, but\n\n61\n00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.150\nI am gonna talk about\na tool you can download,\n\n62\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.670\na little customization\ndashboard tool called GMT.exe.\n\n63\n00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.820\nIt's a cool little dashboard tool you can\ncustomize with even further out there.\n\n64\n00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.920\nYou get it from Microsoft.\n\n65\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.030\nI'm gonna show you where\nyou can download that.\n\n66\n00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.760\nIt's got an instruction set with\na little PowerPoint slide deck,\n\n67\n00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.620\ntells you how to use it.\n\n68\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.540\nIt's a great little tool.\n\n69\n00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.810\nSo, you may wanna play with that, and\nwe'll give you some insight into that.\n\n70\n00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.020\nWe're also gonna throw\nsome views into the mix.\n\n71\n00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.180\nTalk about the different\nviews that are out there.\n\n72\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.964\nWe've shown you several of them,\nwe've been interacting with them, and\n\n73\n00:02:47.964 --> 00:02:50.186\nlooking at them all along,\nevery time we go in the console.\n\n74\n00:02:50.186 --> 00:02:52.810\nBut we haven't really stopped,\ncalled them out, and talked about them for\n\n75\n00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.580\nwhat they are.\n\n76\n00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.910\nSo we're gonna go in and\njust identify those, and\n\n77\n00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.910\nalong the way with doing dashboards,\nwe'll throw a couple of views in for\n\n78\n00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.360\ngood measure, network view, performance\nview, alert view, etc, etc, etc.\n\n79\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.810\nWe have an etc, etc, etc view as well\nactually, that's the hidden view.\n\n80\n00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.375\n&gt;&gt; That's the best one.\n\n81\n00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:08.835\nThat is the best one cuz\nit covers everything.\n\n82\n00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:11.005\nMy mother in law loves to say that,\nby the way.\n\n83\n00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:13.015\nWe'll be talking and she'll be like,\nyeah, etc, etc, etc.\n\n84\n00:03:13.015 --> 00:03:14.075\nI'm like, really?\n\n85\n00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:15.470\nShe's like, yeah, that's what I meant.\n\n86\n00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You know what I mean.\n\n87\n00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:18.765\n&gt;&gt; So I'm like, okay,\nwhatever that is, that works.\n\n88\n00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.545\nSo that's where I get that from, so\n\n89\n00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:23.255\nwe give credit where credit\nis due here at ITProTV.\n\n90\n00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:27.750\nSo let us if we can start by\ntaking a look to the right.\n\n91\n00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.480\nActually I should have done\nthis cuz it's part three.\n\n92\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.530\nThat would have been three\ntimes as good as part one.\n\n93\n00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.760\nSo yeah, you do stay to the right,\n\n94\n00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.690\nI keep going this way cuz\nthat's my natural thing.\n\n95\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.720\nI don't go off to the right,\nI go off to the left.\n\n96\n00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.980\nSo creating views in operations manager.\n\n97\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.270\nJust wanna start up the conversation\nby showing you, as we always do,\n\n98\n00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.195\nwhere to go out on the web,\nget a little more information.\n\n99\n00:03:45.195 --> 00:03:47.060\nYou're demonstrations are good.\n\n100\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.130\nThe discussion hopefully helps you point\nin the right direction, get some insight.\n\n101\n00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.770\nBut you may need that specific step\nby step, let me look at it three or\n\n102\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.990\nfour times, read it through,\n\n103\n00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.840\nunderstand it kind of guidance and\ntry to provide that to you if we can.\n\n104\n00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.320\nSo you can go out and\nread up on the views.\n\n105\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.700\nNow the reason I like this\nparticular web page, and\n\n106\n00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.810\nI've talked a lot about the value of\nthe documentation Microsoft puts out\n\n107\n00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.450\naround this product in particular,\nhow detailed it is and\n\n108\n00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.740\nthis is no exception,\nwe've got a little as we scroll down.\n\n109\n00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.510\nA little blurb on not just what views are,\nthose are important obviously, but\n\n110\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.370\nthen we have links to all the different\nkinds of views and how to do each one.\n\n111\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.890\nAnd I am gonna demo a few of these for\nyou as we run through.\n\n112\n00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.230\nBut I mentioned the alert view,\nthe event view,\n\n113\n00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.990\nthe state view were there,\nperformance view I mentioned I think.\n\n114\n00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.920\nWe've taken a look at\nsome of these already.\n\n115\n00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.600\nThe diagram view that shows us the view,\n\n116\n00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.700\nwe see that with distributed\napplication layout.\n\n117\n00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.210\nWe can see all the different parts, and\nI'll show you what that looks like,\n\n118\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.150\nthat's kinda cool.\n\n119\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.570\nWe have the webpage view,\nthe task status view, dashboard view and\n\n120\n00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.610\nthe override some reviews.\n\n121\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.580\nSo got a whole bunch of there from\nviews that we can use in here, and\n\n122\n00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.510\nthere's a specific methodology or\nstep by step process to create each one,\n\n123\n00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.650\nyou'll gonna be able to follow up and take\na look at that, just before we go in and\n\n124\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.120\ntake a look at it have a view\nthat I'd mentioned this cool tool\n\n125\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.700\nthat you can download GMD tool,\nGMT.exc tool specifically.\n\n126\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.090\nYou may wanna go up take a look,\ndon't keep put off by the fact it says.\n\n127\n00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.530\nFree windows server two thousand and\neight dashboard flops 2012 you can use it\n\n128\n00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.840\nwith 2012 or two so if you take a look\nhere you will read through it gives you\n\n129\n00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.590\na little insight and how to use too not\na big deal pretty straight forward and\n\n130\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.480\nyou ca see the kind of dashboards that can\nbe set up its pretty cool so this one.\n\n131\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.930\nAnd I think, if I'm not mistake, let\nme see if we get a deeper dive on that,\n\n132\n00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.050\nyou know, get a deeper dive on that\npicture real quick just by bringing it up.\n\n133\n00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.730\nCan we go full screen just for\na second so you can see that?\n\n134\n00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.570\nKinda neat, right?\n\n135\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.400\nThis is directly from the webpage where\nthe tool is talked about in the blog.\n\n136\n00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.140\nYou can go in and see CPU utilization.\n\n137\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.900\nWe see memory utilization.\n\n138\n00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.350\nWe can see they put out\ndisc utilization network.\n\n139\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.610\nSo they got a bunch of different stuff.\n\n140\n00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.266\nThis would be the-\n&gt;&gt; The big four.\n\n141\n00:05:47.266 --> 00:05:48.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The big four, right, big four.\n\n142\n00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.940\nBut this is the grid view.\n\n143\n00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.910\nWe have up to nine of these boxes.\n\n144\n00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.950\nThis is essentially a four,\nright, as opposed to a nine.\n\n145\n00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.855\nWhat I'm I'm trying to think,\n\n146\n00:05:57.855 --> 00:05:59.855\nbut sometimes it's not more\ncomplicated in the looks.\n\n147\n00:05:59.855 --> 00:06:00.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n148\n00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:02.205\n&gt;&gt; You gotta stop long\nenough to remember that.\n\n149\n00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:06.445\nSo this is kinda nice but specifically,\nwhich is why I like the blog entry\n\n150\n00:06:06.445 --> 00:06:09.265\nright down here, they give you\nthe link to download the tools, so\n\n151\n00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:12.322\nif you wanna go in and get you just\ndownload it right off the webpage.\n\n152\n00:06:12.322 --> 00:06:15.392\nWe got the URL for\nyou in the show notes, just so.\n\n153\n00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:18.572\nAnd when you download the zip file,\nbecause, it's not just enough to say hey,\n\n154\n00:06:18.572 --> 00:06:19.592\ngo download that.\n\n155\n00:06:19.592 --> 00:06:21.562\nBut you gotta actually\nsee what's in there.\n\n156\n00:06:21.562 --> 00:06:25.662\nAnd so, what I did,\nwas I downloaded the tool for you.\n\n157\n00:06:25.662 --> 00:06:26.972\nAnd I have it just sitting on the desktop.\n\n158\n00:06:26.972 --> 00:06:30.032\nAll we did was explode out\nthe zip file and zip it.\n\n159\n00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:34.112\nYou can see we've got the PowerPoint,\nwhich we'll just walk through how to use\n\n160\n00:06:34.112 --> 00:06:36.730\nit, it's very straightforward,\nreally simple to understand.\n\n161\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.380\nA kind of a nice way to put\nthe documentation together.\n\n162\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.000\nYou got the folder that contains\nthe actual executable along with all\n\n163\n00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.840\nthe supporting information, and\nyou go through there, you load that up,\n\n164\n00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.615\nand you'll be able to use that tool\nto create some really cool dashboard.\n\n165\n00:06:49.615 --> 00:06:53.605\nSo that's free instruct from\nMicrosoft.com, team put that out and\n\n166\n00:06:53.605 --> 00:06:55.965\nput it out for you, so\nyou guys can take a look at it.\n\n167\n00:06:55.965 --> 00:07:00.125\nSo, if you are interested obviously,\njump on in there as they say take a look.\n\n168\n00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:04.430\nAnd what we have here I'm\njust gonna refresh our lab.\n\n169\n00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.860\nA timer here, so\nbear with me here half a second.\n\n170\n00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.260\nWe always do that at\nthe beginning of our demos so\n\n171\n00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.130\nwe don't run out of time\nin the middle of it.\n\n172\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.440\nThat way I don't forget to do it.\n\n173\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.700\nBut we have our console up here, so what I\nwanted to do is pick up where we left off.\n\n174\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.210\nWe were talking about potentially\ncreating some dashboards, wanna go in and\n\n175\n00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.740\ntake a look at that.\n\n176\n00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.020\nThought we would just start out by showing\nyou a couple of these views real quick,\n\n177\n00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.500\nthat we've been discussing.\n\n178\n00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.880\nSo, you can right-click up here\nin the Monitor and WorkSpace,\n\n179\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.490\nsee this is where we are.\n\n180\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.610\nNew at the top and you'll see we\nhave all of our views down there and\n\n181\n00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.660\nof course we do have a dashboard\nas one of the views.\n\n182\n00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.330\nAnd we'll take a look at that in\na deeper dive here in a moment.\n\n183\n00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.780\nBut we choose which ever view\nthat we wanna go through.\n\n184\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.326\nSo Daniel, I'm gonna give you the option\nof telling us which view you want us to\n\n185\n00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:46.620\ndo, and if you don't choose the right\none then I'm gonna override you.\n\n186\n00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.826\nBecause I do believe in being\na benevolent authoritarian, so\n\n187\n00:07:49.826 --> 00:07:53.108\nI'm gonna give you an option but\nyou have to choose correctly.\n\n188\n00:07:53.108 --> 00:07:56.176\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's see if I can [CROSSTALK]\nWanna walk up the screen so\n\n189\n00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:56.948\nyou can see it?\n\n190\n00:07:56.948 --> 00:07:58.231\n&gt;&gt; I'm having a hard time seeing it.\n\n191\n00:07:58.231 --> 00:07:59.260\n&gt;&gt; Should we go full time?\n\n192\n00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.390\nLet's go full size real quick.\n\n193\n00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.750\n&gt;&gt; The eyes aren't what they used to be.\n\n194\n00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.720\n&gt;&gt; Want me to read them to you.\n\n195\n00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.170\nAll kidding aside, do you want me to read\nthem to you, tell you what they are?\n\n196\n00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.630\nWe got alert view, event view,\nwe got state view.\n\n197\n00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.330\nI'm just going down the list, right?\n\n198\n00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz, Daniel needs a seeing eye human so\n\n199\n00:08:10.885 --> 00:08:12.154\nhe can understand what's up there [LAUGH].\n\n200\n00:08:12.154 --> 00:08:13.858\n&gt;&gt; I'm blind.\n&gt;&gt; Performance view, diagram view,\n\n201\n00:08:13.858 --> 00:08:15.870\ntest status view, web page view,\nand dashboard view.\n\n202\n00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.610\nWe're not gonna do dashboard view first.\n\n203\n00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.560\nWe'll get to that one.\n\n204\n00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.160\nWe'll get to that.\n\n205\n00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.530\nWe're going to save that for\na secondary demo.\n\n206\n00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.522\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So do maybe alert or event [CROSSTALK]\n\n207\n00:08:23.522 --> 00:08:24.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was going to say alert.\n\n208\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.804\nI'll say go alert [CROSSTALK] sounds good,\nyeah.\n\n209\n00:08:25.804 --> 00:08:26.950\n&gt;&gt; Let's do alert view.\n\n210\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:27.570\nSo, we'll take that one.\n\n211\n00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.540\nSo, we're going to grab that real quick.\n\n212\n00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.460\nSo, we're going to be given\na little wizard here.\n\n213\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.280\nHey, what's the name of the alert view.\n\n214\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.610\nWhat do I want to call it.\n\n215\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.520\nCall it Daniel alert me now, right?\n\n216\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.120\nSomething like that, whatever that may be.\n\n217\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.240\nThen you put a little description in\nthere if we need that, no big deal.\n\n218\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.500\nWe have a criteria.\n\n219\n00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.440\nSo show that a related to,\nwe have a little pink list here.\n\n220\n00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.950\nWe have an object that\nis there by default.\n\n221\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.940\nWe can go browse, and\nwe actually look for and\n\n222\n00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.520\npull in any item that\nwe would like to use.\n\n223\n00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.300\nWe could view what are called the targets,\nwhat we wanna use, essentially.\n\n224\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.270\nWe've got a pretty robust list here.\n\n225\n00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.110\nNow, by default,\nwe filter with common targets, meaning\n\n226\n00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:09.340\nones most likely to be used, ones that we\nwould more often that not wanna create.\n\n227\n00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.040\nIn this case, an alert view for.\n\n228\n00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.185\nBut we also have an option to go all in,\ndo all targets.\n\n229\n00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:16.620\nAnd we get a complete list,\nand that's gonna give us,\n\n230\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.000\nwe have 100 on the common targets.\n\n231\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.270\nView all is going to give us 1,300.\n\n232\n00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.400\nSo, clearly, filtering is probably\ngoing to be the way to go.\n\n233\n00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.480\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n234\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.600\nWe can do something like computer,\nhealth service,\n\n235\n00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.350\ngateway, computer network adapter.\n\n236\n00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.730\nWe've got the agent in here.\n\n237\n00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.600\nI've got the databases in here.\n\n238\n00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.040\nAs we just move this over,\nyou could see all the different targets.\n\n239\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.110\nNotice in the middle column,\n\n240\n00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.960\njust before I select something,\nthey're coming out of management patch.\n\n241\n00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.790\nRemember, all of these items\nare relating back to management packs.\n\n242\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.510\nNothing exists, zero,\nnada, the big no, no, no.\n\n243\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.612\nNothing exists unless it comes from\na management pack here in SCOM, right?\n\n244\n00:10:02.612 --> 00:10:05.480\nSo we've got everything coming\nout of the management pack\n\n245\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.850\nare being created as an item that gets\nput into a custom management pack.\n\n246\n00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.310\nWe’ll be talking about that\nin some upcoming episodes.\n\n247\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.680\nAnd as a result of that,\nthen allows us to pull it in here.\n\n248\n00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.820\nSo, if we don’t have a reference pack to a\nmanagement pack, we got as we say buckets.\n\n249\n00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:20.330\n&gt;&gt; Buckets.\n\n250\n00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.450\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nThere we go, we say that.\n\n251\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.195\nSo we have all sort of stuffs.\n\n252\n00:10:23.195 --> 00:10:25.510\nSo, interesting, we can choose anything.\n\n253\n00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.040\nWe got mobile devices could be managed\nhere, got a mobile device item.\n\n254\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.570\nSo we've all sorts of different stuff.\n\n255\n00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.730\nWe'll just go ahead,\nwe'll choose something up near the top,\n\n256\n00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.860\nwe'll just choose computer.\n\n257\n00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.250\nHold on, didn't mean to do that, sorry.\n\n258\n00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:37.880\nThat was the help.\n\n259\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.330\nI wanted to click okay.\n\n260\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.210\nSo we got that, and\n\n261\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:44.620\nthen it says if we move to the right here,\nshow data contained in a specific group.\n\n262\n00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.670\nSo what we're gonna do,\nthe all group again, we're narrowing.\n\n263\n00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.310\nWe're doing what's called scoping and\ntailoring.\n\n264\n00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.260\nWe're filtering.\n\n265\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.490\nSo kind of think of\na huge tunnel up top and\n\n266\n00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.280\nas we go we're getting narrower and\nnarrower.\n\n267\n00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.820\nAnd the bottom output will be\nsomething that's going to hopefully\n\n268\n00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.210\nderive what we wanna see.\n\n269\n00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.230\nAnd so as we go through here,\n\n270\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.810\nwhat are the objects that we're\ngoing to actually specify?\n\n271\n00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.520\nI get we can search a text string and\nget a bunch of stuff or\n\n272\n00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.030\nwe can use what's here.\n\n273\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.890\nSo we can go in and as we scroll\ndown we'll just do this, just so\n\n274\n00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.170\nyou can kind of see what's here.\n\n275\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.360\nWe've got all sorts of stuff.\n\n276\n00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.280\nWe've got SQL server, got Windows\nserver instances here, server 12,\n\n277\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.510\nserver eight, whatever the case may be.\n\n278\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:30.630\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll do server 12, I guess.\n\n279\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.370\nComputer Group, or Server 12 Full.\n\n280\n00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.390\nI don't know exactly what's\ngonna have data in it.\n\n281\n00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.980\nSo we'll guess here, and\nwe'll say Server 12, most likely.\n\n282\n00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.400\nAnd then, what we'll do is\nwe'll specify some conditions.\n\n283\n00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.410\nWe talked about conditions in\nthe last demo if you remember,\n\n284\n00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.700\nfrom our prior episode.\n\n285\n00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.440\nWent through, saw how to fill that out.\n\n286\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.110\nSo if we do of a specific severity,\nof a certain priority,\n\n287\n00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:58.020\ncreated by a certain source, with\na specific name, whatever the case may be.\n\n288\n00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.010\nIf I do specific name, click Specific.\n\n289\n00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:05.210\nWe'd have to do a text string, so\nI specify text string to search SQL style.\n\n290\n00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.856\nAs opposed to gangam style, right?\n\n291\n00:12:06.856 --> 00:12:07.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n292\n00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:11.090\nSQL style\n&gt;&gt; Wildcards are acceptable, so\n\n293\n00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.940\nwe'd fill in our string,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n294\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:20.940\nSo if we do something like this,\nwe would do plab, right?\n\n295\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:26.170\nAnd asterisk, anything with the word\nplab in it would be accepted there.\n\n296\n00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:31.870\nAnd then, once we're done with all that,\nclick OK, save our view.\n\n297\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.440\nAnd we may not get any data for this one.\n\n298\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.630\nI'll show you one that actually\nhas data in it in a minute.\n\n299\n00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:40.121\nI'm really just more concerned about\ncreating some basic ones right now just so\n\n300\n00:12:40.121 --> 00:12:42.380\nthat we can see what's going on.\n\n301\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.780\nSo, give that a second,\nif we didn't lock up the console there.\n\n302\n00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.650\nSometimes we have to wait for\nit to think about what it's doing and\n\n303\n00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.650\ncome on back to life.\n\n304\n00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.110\nLet's give that a second, hold on.\n\n305\n00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.010\nThere we go, did it move?\n\n306\n00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.320\nThere we go, yeah it moved, okay.\n\n307\n00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.420\nJust wait for it to come up there,\nwhoops, there we go.\n\n308\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.280\nI was trying not to close it, but\nI think I may have clicked, yeah,\n\n309\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.790\nI clicked on Close by mistake.\n\n310\n00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.720\nLet's just open the console back up.\n\n311\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.650\nJust freezes sometimes while it's\nupdating, and between that and\n\n312\n00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.740\nthe latency in the Cloud environment for\n\n313\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.180\nthe labs you never know quite\nwhether it's responding or not.\n\n314\n00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.550\nSo I was a little too quick\nto say it's not working.\n\n315\n00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.510\nSo now you can see we have\nour alert right there.\n\n316\n00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.500\nWe'll just click on it, our Alert View.\n\n317\n00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.030\nAnd we can see that it's been programmed,\nit's in the console,\n\n318\n00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.980\nit's there immediately.\n\n319\n00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.180\nAnd if we have any data coming in with it,\nwe absolutely would be able to see it.\n\n320\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.990\nNow, let's take a look at what\nan Alert View would actually\n\n321\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.210\nlook like if we had data coming in.\n\n322\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.010\nActive alerts would essentially, always be\npopulated with whatever may be going on.\n\n323\n00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.990\nSo if we had chosen\nthe right options there,\n\n324\n00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.600\nthe right computer, the right\ninformation as we programmed it in,\n\n325\n00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.710\nthen we would be getting\nalert something like this.\n\n326\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:49.230\nSo you could see here, the alert view will\nallow us, just move this over a little\n\n327\n00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:54.320\nbit, allow us to see alerts that may be of\nseverity critical and or severity warning.\n\n328\n00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.180\nWe have different categories here, and\n\n329\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.440\nwe can highlight whichever one it may be,\nright?\n\n330\n00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.520\nWe get an error on that particular one,\nit's a severity critical.\n\n331\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.300\nWe get some detailed information down\nhere that shows us what's going on.\n\n332\n00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.530\nSo we can see a little\ndescription down below, right?\n\n333\n00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:12.820\nWe could scroll through here, see\ninformation about what may be happening.\n\n334\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.745\nIf there is additional information or\n\n335\n00:14:14.745 --> 00:14:18.481\nknowledge may be available in\nthe knowledge base, we can click through.\n\n336\n00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:20.226\nWe can potentially get in there,\nsee what's going on with that.\n\n337\n00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:23.394\nThere may not be anything there,\nbut we could click through.\n\n338\n00:14:23.394 --> 00:14:25.620\nIn addition, come back up here.\n\n339\n00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.110\nWe could see the Alert rule that\nactually leads to the alert.\n\n340\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.730\nWe could see the full path and\nthe name of the system that has it.\n\n341\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.294\nAnd then we have actions\ntied to this as we see.\n\n342\n00:14:36.294 --> 00:14:39.376\nWe could put a machine in\na maintenance mode, for instance,\n\n343\n00:14:39.376 --> 00:14:41.743\nif this computer's experiencing a problem.\n\n344\n00:14:41.743 --> 00:14:45.605\nDirectly from this view, we can go ahead\nand we can specify that we want to close\n\n345\n00:14:45.605 --> 00:14:48.840\nout the alert, acknowledge it and\nsay, yeah, we know about it.\n\n346\n00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.830\nNo big deal, it's okay.\n\n347\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.790\nNot going to worry about it.\n\n348\n00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:56.230\nI showed you the health explorer in one\nof the prior demonstrations in our last\n\n349\n00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.690\nepisode where I said, hey, since we're\nhere, let's drill in real quick.\n\n350\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.710\nWe saw we could go through, see all the\nalerts listed, and then drill through and\n\n351\n00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.280\nsee the actual information.\n\n352\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.150\nAnother way to get to that\ninformation coming out of this view.\n\n353\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.580\nSo there's a lot of different ways\nwe can leverage this information.\n\n354\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.210\nWe can also set resolutions state.\n\n355\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.715\nWe need to go back to full screen for\n\n356\n00:15:14.715 --> 00:15:17.898\nthat cuz it's actually right behind me as\nI'm talking to you on the screen there.\n\n357\n00:15:17.898 --> 00:15:21.420\nBut you can see right down here on\nthe right we can set resolution state.\n\n358\n00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.710\nSo, if we wanna set resolution sate,\nand we click,\n\n359\n00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.780\nwe will have whatever the resolution\nstate is, and we've programmed in.\n\n360\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.100\nOne of the upcoming episodes I'm going\nto show you how to create a custom\n\n361\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.135\nalert resolution state here.\n\n362\n00:15:33.135 --> 00:15:37.040\nYou'll see I have one there that normally\ndoesn't show up, but here is there, and\n\n363\n00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.120\nyou can see clearly I did\ncreate one that is customized.\n\n364\n00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.670\nIT Pro TV alerting you.\n\n365\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.130\nAnd I'm going to show you how to do that.\n\n366\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.007\nCould do that both from the console.\n\n367\n00:15:45.007 --> 00:15:46.491\nAnd I've actually showed\nyou how to go in and\n\n368\n00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:48.151\nplay around in there\nalready on prior episodes.\n\n369\n00:15:48.151 --> 00:15:51.508\nSo, we'll go back, we'll take a look I'm\nalso gonna show you how to do it through\n\n370\n00:15:51.508 --> 00:15:53.909\nPowerShell, cuz as you know,\nwe love using PowerShell.\n\n371\n00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:56.730\nSo we're gonna take a look at that,\nmake sure you understand how to do that.\n\n372\n00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.760\nBut for now, just assume that,\nif we created it, it will be there.\n\n373\n00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.188\nBuild it, as they say, and they will come.\n\n374\n00:16:02.188 --> 00:16:03.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Field of Dreams, right?\n\n375\n00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:03.620\nGreat movie.\n\n376\n00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.640\n&gt;&gt; That's right, great flick, yeah.\n\n377\n00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.310\n&gt;&gt; So ITProTV alerting you,\nwe'll set our resolution state to that.\n\n378\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.485\nSo we could say that that's now,\ngonna have that resolution,\n\n379\n00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:15.610\nthink that that one doesn't really\nmake sense for the real world, but\n\n380\n00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.340\nyou could see, I did change it now,\nit's set right up there.\n\n381\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.249\nInstead of new,\n\n382\n00:16:19.249 --> 00:16:23.470\nnow this would be the idea of tracking\nthe resolution states of various phases,\n\n383\n00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.480\nescalation phases, setting into\nthe console as you're managing through it.\n\n384\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.340\nWhen we talk about service\nlevel manager integration, and\n\n385\n00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.710\nwe get more into the service level manager\nthought process, we could throw this,\n\n386\n00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.710\nand kind of throw it over the wall,\nping-pong it back and forth.\n\n387\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:41.360\nHave it auto resolve,\nbased on activity taken, into ideas that\n\n388\n00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.930\nare thrown out at the system on that side,\nthrough the ticket management process.\n\n389\n00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.590\nSo, we can actually do some pretty\ncool stuff with this, if we decide,\n\n390\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.040\nas I said, we wanna close the alert out,\n\n391\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.100\njust highlight that to make\nsure we're working on it.\n\n392\n00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.341\nWe'll close it out right here, we'll do\nthat, you see the alert disappears, and\n\n393\n00:16:56.341 --> 00:16:58.702\nit's essentially gone so\nwe can acknowledge it and say hey,\n\n394\n00:16:58.702 --> 00:17:01.020\nwe've done with it,\nit's no longer important.\n\n395\n00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.560\nSo we can go in and\nwe can do all that with an alert view.\n\n396\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.590\nEvery one of these views that we create,\nis gonna have this depth\n\n397\n00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:10.880\nof information management associated with\nit, just depending on what we're doing.\n\n398\n00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.500\nLet's just do one more,\njust as a random choice.\n\n399\n00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.050\nWe'll let you guys decide.\n\n400\n00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.585\nWe're gonna have a poll, so everybody\nspeak really loudly so we can hear you.\n\n401\n00:17:18.585 --> 00:17:20.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm hearing something about,\n\n402\n00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.720\nI don't know, do you hear that?\n\n403\n00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.700\nI wasn’t quite sure\nwhat that sounded like.\n\n404\n00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.090\nI thought, everybody was screaming for\nstate view.\n\n405\n00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:28.080\nBut I could be wrong.\n\n406\n00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.620\nThat could have been-\n&gt;&gt; It could just be the wind blowing or\n\n407\n00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.200\nsomething like that.\n\n408\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.980\n&gt;&gt; Or it could just be that they\nwe’re really just saying they want-\n\n409\n00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.260\n&gt;&gt; Your tinnitus is acting up.\n\n410\n00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.410\n&gt;&gt; Could be.\nCould be saying they wanted diagram view,\n\n411\n00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.320\nand I could have heard state view.\n\n412\n00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that’s true.\n\n413\n00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.690\n&gt;&gt; But I’m gonna go with state view,\ncuz that's what I wanna do, so\n\n414\n00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:41.970\nwe're gonna do that one as well.\n\n415\n00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.680\nSo we'll take a look at\nstate view really quickly.\n\n416\n00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.970\nAgain, same idea, just showing you\na different way of using the views.\n\n417\n00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:47.920\nJust what do they look like,\n\n418\n00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.210\nand we'll show you what a state view\nlooks like here in just a minute.\n\n419\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.430\nYou've seen these before as well,\n\n420\n00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.230\njust wanna show you what\ngoes on under the hood.\n\n421\n00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.180\nSo we'll label this, we'll call this one,\njust keeping with our theme,\n\n422\n00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.230\nDaniel State view here, just so\nwe know which one it is.\n\n423\n00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.270\nI'm not gonna go through the whole\nobject and data source again,\n\n424\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.980\nwe've been through that.\n\n425\n00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.870\nWe're just gonna assume we\nunderstand the concepts of those.\n\n426\n00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.530\nI'm just gonna leave it\nat the generic one, and\n\n427\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:17.040\nI have to choose an object before I\ndo that, let's just do a computer,\n\n428\n00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.800\nand yeah, that's fine, no big deal.\n\n429\n00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.300\nAll right.\n\n430\n00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:29.090\nAnd let's go in, and\nlet's do all Windows computers.\n\n431\n00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.670\nSo you would see the general\nthought process here.\n\n432\n00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.090\nCriteria can not be configured for\nthis abstract type.\n\n433\n00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.810\nAll right, so what do I need to do?\n\n434\n00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:43.830\nJust think about this for one second.\n\n435\n00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.530\nLet's go in here.\n\n436\n00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.460\nAnd let's do the data access service.\n\n437\n00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.160\nAnd that will give us one\nwe can actually work with.\n\n438\n00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.920\nComputers, in general, contain a CAPTCHA.\n\n439\n00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.000\nWe got to be more specific to configure,\nis what they're telling us, basically.\n\n440\n00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.650\nSo we'll just do that.\n\n441\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.660\nAnd then instead of show data connected\nfor a specific group all Windows,\n\n442\n00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.610\nlet's just do database,\nsince we're doing the data access service.\n\n443\n00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:13.900\nAnd then we'll do a display name,\nand when we do display name,\n\n444\n00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:19.475\nthis is how we can bring in something like\nthe ops database, warehouse database.\n\n445\n00:19:19.475 --> 00:19:22.880\nWe'd have to obviously have the\nappropriate name, and know what it is but\n\n446\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:28.180\nif we did this and did operations\nwith a wildcard to indicate, we take\n\n447\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.760\nany with the word operations as that, we\nwould then be able to get that in there.\n\n448\n00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.400\nAgain, we're not expecting real\ndata to come back right now.\n\n449\n00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.830\nWe're just showing you how\nthis will get programmed.\n\n450\n00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.450\nBut what I'll do is,\nas soon as this instantiates and\n\n451\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.480\nsets up over here, this time we will\nwait a minute just to make sure\n\n452\n00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.450\nit shows up before I close the console.\n\n453\n00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.608\nBut as soon as that updates,\nwhat we'll do is, we'll go ahead and\n\n454\n00:19:48.608 --> 00:19:51.540\nwe'll show you what a real one looks\nlike in terms of functionality.\n\n455\n00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.530\nAs soon as I take a sip of water.\n\n456\n00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n457\n00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.880\n&gt;&gt; All right so, there it is, right.\n\n458\n00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.900\nThere again your stage view, right?\n\n459\n00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.298\nAgain, nothing in there, but\nwe expect that, no big deal,\n\n460\n00:20:02.298 --> 00:20:05.432\nwe can go into the distributed\napplication state view,\n\n461\n00:20:05.432 --> 00:20:09.860\nwhich does have the test application,\nwe have been using ITProTV test.\n\n462\n00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.390\nTier 3, sitting over here, and\nour ops manager, we could see this.\n\n463\n00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:18.020\nAnd it will just simply show us literally,\njust the state.\n\n464\n00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.340\nThis one is not monitored,\nthis one's in warning.\n\n465\n00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.800\nIf I go to Windows computers,\n\n466\n00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.250\nyou've seen this view before,\nwe could see the state is warning for\n\n467\n00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:30.100\nthe machine, the ops controller or\nthe ops manager server that we're on.\n\n468\n00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.490\nSo, we could see a state view as roughly\nmore than showing us critical warning,\n\n469\n00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.490\nmonitored, not monitored,\nwhatever the view is, whatever the status,\n\n470\n00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.730\nthat's what that particular\nview is going to show us.\n\n471\n00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.030\nAlright, so let's do the following.\n\n472\n00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.060\nI created a summary dashboard,\nI didn't populate it with anything, but\n\n473\n00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.450\nI created a summary dashboard,\n\n474\n00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:51.154\njust put some parts out there, and\nI just did this real quick as a one-off.\n\n475\n00:20:51.154 --> 00:20:54.030\nActually did it from the webcon, so\nI'm gonna show you how to edit it and\n\n476\n00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.260\ncreate it in there.\n\n477\n00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.230\nBut I would enter it like when I had and\nthen put in, and this is a summary\n\n478\n00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.810\ndashboard, so it's already pre-programmed,\npre-made as a template\n\n479\n00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:06.810\nwith the top-end widget, performance\nwidget, the state widget right down here.\n\n480\n00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.990\nAnd the alert view, and the alert view,\nyou could see we've already talked about,\n\n481\n00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.430\nis populated,\nthe others have to be configured.\n\n482\n00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.510\nThere's no data coming in.\n\n483\n00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.420\nI'll show you how to do that real quick.\n\n484\n00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.090\nBut we can use a dashboard\nthat's already been created.\n\n485\n00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.650\nWe can edit it, configure it,\nwe can create a new one.\n\n486\n00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.560\nI'll create a new dashboard view here.\n\n487\n00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.640\nI'll show you how to do that over\nin the web console as well, just so\n\n488\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.280\nwe can see it go back and forth.\n\n489\n00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:33.190\nAnd speaking of the web console,\nlet's just go ahead and log in real quick.\n\n490\n00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.080\nNow, just like the other consoles,\n\n491\n00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.420\nyou need to make sure\nSilverlight's up to date here.\n\n492\n00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.680\nSo if you get an error the first time,\nyou go in and test it.\n\n493\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.260\nHey, it may need some additional stuff.\n\n494\n00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.040\nJust download, let it do its thing,\nupdate real quick.\n\n495\n00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.190\nUsually log out, log back in because\nthat way it does pick up on the fact you\n\n496\n00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.980\ninstalled Silverlight, it refreshes and\nknows you're in there.\n\n497\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.320\nAnd then you log in, no big deal,\nyou can see it's working.\n\n498\n00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.180\nI did tell you the web consoles\nstreamline view, right?\n\n499\n00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.480\nIt's not gonna be a full console,\nthe way that the ops console is.\n\n500\n00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.250\nIt's really designed to let\nyou just do monitoring,\n\n501\n00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:07.360\nlooking at monitoring output for\na remote admin who's gonna be doing that.\n\n502\n00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.560\nAnd I did mention that we do have\nthe create dashboard view option,\n\n503\n00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.360\nwhich is right here.\n\n504\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.650\nOr we could do a little customization\nwith the My Work Space area,\n\n505\n00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.750\nwe'll take a look at that\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n506\n00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.720\nBut if I want to create this\ndashboard like I did right here,\n\n507\n00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.545\nI'll do one from the Web console,\nsince we're here.\n\n508\n00:22:21.545 --> 00:22:22.782\nThen we'll go back, we'll see and\n\n509\n00:22:22.782 --> 00:22:25.470\nwe'll go ahead and do another\none from inside the ops console.\n\n510\n00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.570\nSo, come in here.\n\n511\n00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:29.080\nClick create dashboard view.\n\n512\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.990\nWe're gonna get our little template layout\nselector, we've got our four templates.\n\n513\n00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:36.312\nWe talked about these in one of the prior\nepisodes, column layout, grid layout,\n\n514\n00:22:36.312 --> 00:22:38.590\nservice level dashboard,\nand the summary dashboard.\n\n515\n00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.570\nYou just saw summary dashboard,\nso we'll do a different one.\n\n516\n00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.850\nLet's go ahead, and\n\n517\n00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.190\nlet's do a column layout, you remember\nhow many columns we could have?\n\n518\n00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.830\nWhat's the maximum?\n\n519\n00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.330\n&gt;&gt; Nine.\n\n520\n00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.890\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; 20.\n\n521\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.390\n&gt;&gt; No, 5.\n\n522\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.890\n25. &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 25.\n\n523\n00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:50.390\n&gt;&gt; It's 25.\n\n524\n00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:51.030\n&gt;&gt; 25 divided\n\n525\n00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:51.530\nby 9.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n526\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.274\n&gt;&gt; Right minus 5 whatever that\n\n527\n00:22:54.274 --> 00:22:55.307\nwould be.\n\n528\n00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:56.161\n&gt;&gt; Plus 2.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n529\n00:22:56.161 --> 00:22:56.683\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n530\n00:22:56.683 --> 00:22:58.347\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so we can have a total of five\n\n531\n00:22:58.347 --> 00:23:01.670\ncolumns in the column layout view.\nRemember the grid view was not nine,\n\n532\n00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:02.640\nthat was.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n533\n00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.760\n&gt;&gt; And the column layout was 5.\n\n534\n00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.540\nWe're gonna go ahead and\n\n535\n00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.190\ngo column view and click there,\ngotta give it a name.\n\n536\n00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.010\nWe use Daniel's name here.\n\n537\n00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.098\nDaniel, column view.\n\n538\n00:23:12.098 --> 00:23:15.960\nSo that we could just keep track of it and\nknow where it's all going to show up.\n\n539\n00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.940\nSo Daniel, column view.\n\n540\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.770\nNumber of columns, right, specify here.\n\n541\n00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.390\nSee, we max out at five, right.\n\n542\n00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.890\nI'm clicking.\n\n543\n00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:25.630\nI'm up to 25.\n\n544\n00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n545\n00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.490\n&gt;&gt; But I'm stuck at five.\n\n546\n00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.267\nSo remember, we told you.\n\n547\n00:23:28.267 --> 00:23:31.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The maximum is five on the column view.\n\n548\n00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.150\nAnd five's kind of crazy,\ncuz they're really tiny.\n\n549\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.570\nIn the real world, you may do five.\n\n550\n00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.940\nBut let's just do two,\njust to keep it simple.\n\n551\n00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.980\nAnd that way,\nit's kind of easy to figure out.\n\n552\n00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.830\nWe're not going to get too crazy with it.\n\n553\n00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.350\nYou get the idea.\nYou know what they could be.\n\n554\n00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.330\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll click next, we'll do this.\n\n555\n00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.642\nWe'll go ahead and click create,\nand creating visualization.\n\n556\n00:23:48.642 --> 00:23:51.285\nWe'll give it a minute, so\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\n\n557\n00:23:51.285 --> 00:23:52.726\nit's gonna let us set up here.\n\n558\n00:23:52.726 --> 00:23:55.946\nSuccess, so Click Close and\nas soon as that comes up,\n\n559\n00:23:55.946 --> 00:23:59.430\nloads up, takes it and\nthen it's refresh here.\n\n560\n00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:03.640\nAnd so what's that does, the dashboard\nwill be here, I will see the column view.\n\n561\n00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.660\nWe'll see this and\nwe'll be invited to click to add widget.\n\n562\n00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.250\nNow, notice when we did the creation,\nwe did not get the option to select,\n\n563\n00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.120\nhey what do we wanna put in the columns.\n\n564\n00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.408\nAll we got was hey,\nhow many columns do you want?\n\n565\n00:24:17.408 --> 00:24:21.240\nNow, step 2 is okay let's go in,\nlet's put those widgets in place.\n\n566\n00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.180\nAnd then once we do that,\nlet's go ahead and let's configure them.\n\n567\n00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.180\nA little gear up here.\n\n568\n00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.170\n&gt;&gt; One thing at a time, Adam.\n\n569\n00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:26.780\n&gt;&gt; One thing at a time.\n\n570\n00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.970\nRight, don't wanna get ahead of ourselves.\n\n571\n00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.420\nSo we see that, we've done that here.\n\n572\n00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.650\nNow just so that we see,\nthere is total parody here, right.\n\n573\n00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:36.620\nSo let's go over to our ops console for\njust a minute, bring that up.\n\n574\n00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.320\nWe'll see our Daniel column\nview dashboard right here, and\n\n575\n00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.480\nwhen we click on it,\ngive that a second, there we go.\n\n576\n00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.390\nWhen we click on it,\n\n577\n00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.370\nyou'll notice it's in the same\nstate as it is in the web console.\n\n578\n00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.810\nHasn't been magically configured yet.\n\n579\n00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:51.950\nAnd we haven't done anything with it.\n\n580\n00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.910\nSo I can work in either view in real\ntime and it updates the other console.\n\n581\n00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.985\nSo it's good to know that these\ntwo things essentially are linked.\n\n582\n00:24:58.985 --> 00:25:00.535\nThey are working the same way.\n\n583\n00:25:00.535 --> 00:25:02.187\nSo create it in the web console.\n\n584\n00:25:02.187 --> 00:25:04.085\nSo let's just go ahead and\nfinish it up right here.\n\n585\n00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:05.825\nSo what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna go ahead,\n\n586\n00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:08.285\nwe're gonna add in\na couple of widgets here.\n\n587\n00:25:08.285 --> 00:25:10.605\nSo you got any ideas about\nwhat you wanna add in?\n\n588\n00:25:10.605 --> 00:25:14.840\nAny column widgets you're just dying or\nhankering to use?\n\n589\n00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.362\nThat one that we mind.\n&gt;&gt; That one that we talked about before.\n\n590\n00:25:16.362 --> 00:25:17.768\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; The one we talked about before.\n\n591\n00:25:17.768 --> 00:25:19.050\n&gt;&gt; That one we talked about before.\n\n592\n00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:19.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n593\n00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.970\nThe performance widget.\n\n594\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:21.480\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n595\n00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.548\n&gt;&gt; That one, right, okay,\nI'm glad we had that conversation.\n\n596\n00:25:24.548 --> 00:25:27.550\nAll right, so let's click here, let's just\ntake a look what the list looks like and\n\n597\n00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.640\nthen we will as Daniel\nsuggested choose the one\n\n598\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.220\nthat we discussed which is one of them\nanyway, which is the performance widget.\n\n599\n00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.170\nSo just take a look.\n\n600\n00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.590\nCan we go full screen for a sec,\nmay be easier to see that list.\n\n601\n00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.770\nYou'll see we have a list\nof templated widgets.\n\n602\n00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.200\nI mentioned widgets before.\n\n603\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.920\nYou'll want a lot of them.\n\n604\n00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.900\nThere's a few more of\nthe ones I mentioned.\n\n605\n00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.320\nBut you could see them here.\n\n606\n00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.240\nAlerts, column layout, details,\ngrid, instance details.\n\n607\n00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.240\nI mentioned these, went through them in\nthe prior episode, talked about them.\n\n608\n00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.782\nWe're gonna do that performance widget.\n\n609\n00:25:54.782 --> 00:25:56.785\nThat's gonna be the one that\nbrings in the performance counter.\n\n610\n00:25:56.785 --> 00:25:59.592\nIt's kind of like perf mon, right,\nessentially does that for us, so\n\n611\n00:25:59.592 --> 00:26:00.600\nwe'll do that.\n\n612\n00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.590\nLet's go ahead and we'll click Next there.\n\n613\n00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.970\nWe're gonna give this a name, so\nwe're gonna have to name this.\n\n614\n00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:12.405\nSo let's name this test perf mon widget.\n\n615\n00:26:12.405 --> 00:26:16.690\nSo come up with a pretty unique and\nspecial name there.\n\n616\n00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:20.760\nThen what we gotta do is we gotta go in\nand we have to unscope and count this\n\n617\n00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.700\npage, go in and select a group or an,\nI'm sorry, a group or an object is what we\n\n618\n00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.040\nselect while we're doing unscope and\ncount this page as what I meant to say.\n\n619\n00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.760\nSo we're gonna go in,\nwe're gonna click the little three button\n\n620\n00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.930\nbrowse box which actually what we\nformerly call that an ellipsis.\n\n621\n00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.450\nAnd we're gonna go in and click that,\nwe're gonna make a selection.\n\n622\n00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.160\nSo we're gonna go in here,\nwe'll grab this.\n\n623\n00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.380\nWe talked about being able to browse\ngroups versus groups and objects before.\n\n624\n00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:48.263\nSo we're gonna go in and we're gonna\ndo our test tier three application,\n\n625\n00:26:48.263 --> 00:26:51.987\nwhich is gonna be the distributed\napp that we have used.\n\n626\n00:26:51.987 --> 00:26:56.987\nSo let's see if we can do this,\nput something with\n\n627\n00:26:56.987 --> 00:27:01.640\ntest in there,\nlet's reset that real quick.\n\n628\n00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.047\nAnd let's see if we can\nget that to come up.\n\n629\n00:27:06.047 --> 00:27:10.940\nAnd so you'll see we have ITPro TV\ntest here, blah, blah, blah, whatever.\n\n630\n00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.520\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose the application.\n\n631\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.970\nSo let's go in this top one by the way,\nI know it's kinda hard to see but\n\n632\n00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:25.280\nthe icon off to your left here is gonna\nbe a triangle, kind of a red line.\n\n633\n00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.220\nOn the right hand side looks\nsomething like an inverted V or\n\n634\n00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.970\nlike the half square kind of thing.\n\n635\n00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.061\nThat's the application.\n\n636\n00:27:31.061 --> 00:27:32.270\nIt doesn't say it.\n\n637\n00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.010\nYou just gotta get used to the icons and\nknow what they are but\n\n638\n00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.750\nthis is the actual application itself.\n\n639\n00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:39.560\nSo we're gonna grab that\nonce we click that.\n\n640\n00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.390\nAnd we'll grab that.\n\n641\n00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:41.050\nPut that in there.\n\n642\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.560\nAnd then we have to go ahead and\nwe have to click Add.\n\n643\n00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.250\nAnd so we can see here when we\nclick Add for performance counters,\n\n644\n00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:52.350\nwe're gonna be able to go in and grab\nwhatever the performance counters are.\n\n645\n00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.890\nAnd in this case we're gonna just\ngo in and we're going to and\n\n646\n00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.130\nI'll just show you this\nwe'll pull it down.\n\n647\n00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:01.660\nYou'll see we just have all objects,\nall counters, all instances.\n\n648\n00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.380\nWe really don't have an option,\nit's gonna filter and pull everything in.\n\n649\n00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.360\nSo that's fine.\n\n650\n00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.750\nBut this is where people often get\nconfused and they screw up, right?\n\n651\n00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.780\nThey get stuck.\n\n652\n00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.620\nSo, everybody looks at that, goes,\n\n653\n00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.600\nokay look it's already selected down\nthere on available items, right?\n\n654\n00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.732\nBut I don't have\nthe ability to hit OK here.\n\n655\n00:28:15.732 --> 00:28:16.938\nSomething is wrong.\n\n656\n00:28:16.938 --> 00:28:20.372\nWell what's wrong is you haven't\nactually completed the job, right?\n\n657\n00:28:20.372 --> 00:28:24.183\nSo you gotta highlight here and click Add\nto drop it into the bottom box that says\n\n658\n00:28:24.183 --> 00:28:27.883\nselected items because just it is\navailable doesn't mean you have actually\n\n659\n00:28:27.883 --> 00:28:30.320\nopted it and it just means you can opt in.\n\n660\n00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.910\nSo we're gonna make sure we do that.\n\n661\n00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.620\nAnd then you'll notice we\nhave the ability to click OK.\n\n662\n00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.960\nThat will get dropped back in right here,\nso we now know that's available for us.\n\n663\n00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.400\nSo we're gonna be able to\nfinish program in that in.\n\n664\n00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.470\nSo now that we've done that,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll click Next.\n\n665\n00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.908\nWe then have a time range,\nyou know how far back do we wanna go?\n\n666\n00:28:47.908 --> 00:28:50.800\nAre we gonna go over the last 24 hours?\n\n667\n00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.760\nAre we gonna go back longer or\ndo a shorter timeline, it's up to us.\n\n668\n00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.680\nYou can see here, we have Minutes,\nHours, Days, Weeks, Months, Years.\n\n669\n00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.200\nSo if we did the last 24 years, that would\n\n670\n00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.260\nbe interesting because we don't have\na product that goes back that far, right.\n\n671\n00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.030\nAll right, so we'll do last 24 hours.\n\n672\n00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:12.230\nThen what you'll see here is we can\ndecide to select out what we wanna see.\n\n673\n00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.950\nFirst of all,\ndo you wanna see the legend on the chart?\n\n674\n00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.995\nSo when we put the widget in place, do we\nwant a legend that labels various views.\n\n675\n00:29:18.995 --> 00:29:21.655\nAnd then secondarily,\nwhat do we actually want?\n\n676\n00:29:21.655 --> 00:29:24.125\nWhat are the items essentially\nwe wanna put in the view?\n\n677\n00:29:24.125 --> 00:29:25.675\nSo you make your choice here.\n\n678\n00:29:25.675 --> 00:29:26.535\nAnd we can select them.\n\n679\n00:29:26.535 --> 00:29:30.075\nIf you put them all in, each one is about,\nlike a quarter of an inch across.\n\n680\n00:29:30.075 --> 00:29:31.185\nYou can’t really see them.\n\n681\n00:29:31.185 --> 00:29:34.085\nSo, you wanna think through\nthe logic of what you want here.\n\n682\n00:29:34.085 --> 00:29:35.485\nIt’ll be up to you.\n\n683\n00:29:35.485 --> 00:29:38.755\nSo, we have Target,\nwe have Path, Last View.\n\n684\n00:29:38.755 --> 00:29:42.016\nLet’s do minimum and maximum value,\nwe'll just add a couple of those.\n\n685\n00:29:42.016 --> 00:29:46.190\nNotice we can move those up,\ndecide where we want them.\n\n686\n00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.130\nSo I'll do minimum value\nright up in the middle there.\n\n687\n00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:50.680\nThat kinda thing.\n\n688\n00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.050\nMaximum value right next to it.\n\n689\n00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.180\nSo we kinda have those together, right.\n\n690\n00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:00.180\nMaybe move target down,\ntargeting path or side by side.\n\n691\n00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.510\nDo that kinda thing.\n\n692\n00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:06.096\nAnd then let's go ahead, we'll click Next,\nwe'll kind of finish that off.\n\n693\n00:30:06.096 --> 00:30:09.660\nLet's get back to the Create button there,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll create that.\n\n694\n00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.918\nOnce we have that up and\n\n695\n00:30:10.918 --> 00:30:15.367\nrunning, that will be one of the two\nwidgets, gotta wait for that to finish up.\n\n696\n00:30:15.367 --> 00:30:17.055\nIt'll say complete as it has.\n\n697\n00:30:17.055 --> 00:30:20.935\nWe'll just click Close and in a second\nyou'll see we have the left hand side\n\n698\n00:30:20.935 --> 00:30:24.305\nof our view is now gonna be\npopulated with a nice little grid.\n\n699\n00:30:24.305 --> 00:30:26.335\nChart, that's got some stuff in there.\n\n700\n00:30:26.335 --> 00:30:29.387\nIt's all set up and\nobviously once we get this all up and\n\n701\n00:30:29.387 --> 00:30:34.077\nrunning, we would be able to set up the\nother side, add the other widget in and\n\n702\n00:30:34.077 --> 00:30:37.987\nremember we'd have to let this run for\nat least 24 hours to get data, yet\n\n703\n00:30:37.987 --> 00:30:42.468\nwe've only got this setup for the demo, we\nspin the machines up 20 minutes before we\n\n704\n00:30:42.468 --> 00:30:43.508\nshoot the episode for you,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n705\n00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:44.528\n&gt;&gt; Just to make sure\n\n706\n00:30:44.528 --> 00:30:45.458\nthey're up and running.\n\n707\n00:30:45.458 --> 00:30:47.148\nWe don't actually have enough\ndata sitting in there,\n\n708\n00:30:47.148 --> 00:30:48.918\nwe're not leaving it running long enough.\n\n709\n00:30:48.918 --> 00:30:49.698\nBut you get the idea.\n\n710\n00:30:49.698 --> 00:30:53.929\nIf we did actually leave it running for\na few hours, we'd be able to pull data in.\n\n711\n00:30:53.929 --> 00:30:56.479\nIn the real world,\nthis would populate immediately.\n\n712\n00:30:56.479 --> 00:31:00.079\nSo the minute you set this up, as long as\nthere's enough data to populate the chart,\n\n713\n00:31:00.079 --> 00:31:03.449\nit will actually start filtering and\nspitting data out at you,\n\n714\n00:31:03.449 --> 00:31:04.749\nand you'll be able to see it.\n\n715\n00:31:04.749 --> 00:31:07.369\nSo it is kind of cool cuz it\ndoes populate right away.\n\n716\n00:31:07.369 --> 00:31:09.899\nWe would do the same thing over\nhere to add the other widget in.\n\n717\n00:31:09.899 --> 00:31:12.449\nBut let's just take a look at what\nwe would do to configure this.\n\n718\n00:31:12.449 --> 00:31:14.529\nIf we come up on this and\nsay hey, that's cool.\n\n719\n00:31:14.529 --> 00:31:17.291\nBut you know, I wanna go in,\nI wanna edit that.\n\n720\n00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:18.347\nIf we have the rights to do that,\n\n721\n00:31:18.347 --> 00:31:20.430\nlet's just take a look make\nsure we understand that.\n\n722\n00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:25.020\nWell click here, you'll see we can\ndelete contents, we can swap around and\n\n723\n00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.040\nmove widgets around and\nthe view which is nice.\n\n724\n00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.870\nHey I want that, perfmon view on\nthe right, want that undisclosed or\n\n725\n00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:31.580\nundefined widget.\n\n726\n00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.660\nI can swap them around if I want to.\n\n727\n00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.630\nBut configure is where we go to\nmake changes under the hood, right.\n\n728\n00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.060\nSo we can go in and click Configure.\n\n729\n00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:44.820\nJust essentially takes us back in to that\nwizard we were looking at a minute ago.\n\n730\n00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.216\nAnd we just run through it again, and\nwe've the option to reset the counters or\n\n731\n00:31:48.216 --> 00:31:49.360\nchange them if we need to.\n\n732\n00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.393\nSo we can go ahead and modify this,\nand we can interact with it.\n\n733\n00:31:53.393 --> 00:31:57.362\nJust click OK to Cancel out of that,\nand you'll see that we can do that, and\n\n734\n00:31:57.362 --> 00:32:01.079\nthe other nice thing is, if you're\nnot sure whether or not the table or\n\n735\n00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:05.489\nthe chart or whatever it is is up to date,\njust right click, remember we've talked\n\n736\n00:32:05.489 --> 00:32:09.552\nabout the value of doing that refresh\nthing, and it'll go out and refresh.\n\n737\n00:32:09.552 --> 00:32:13.493\nWe're not gonna pull data in, in real time\nhere but, in the real world there would be\n\n738\n00:32:13.493 --> 00:32:17.322\npulling data in for you, and you'd be able\nto see it, as we talked about already,\n\n739\n00:32:17.322 --> 00:32:20.120\nif we come over here,\nyou'll notice it has not refreshed.\n\n740\n00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.760\nNow, it is up to date but\n\n741\n00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.450\nkeep in mind I talked about the fact\nthat consoles lag sometimes, right?\n\n742\n00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.272\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; This is a good example of that.\n\n743\n00:32:26.272 --> 00:32:30.159\nWe provide it into one, it is actually\nupdatable, we have to refresh the console\n\n744\n00:32:30.159 --> 00:32:33.750\nto get that view to come up so we would\nwanna right click here, do a little\n\n745\n00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:38.660\nrefresh and sometimes that refresh\nworks right away, sometimes it may not.\n\n746\n00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:42.180\nSometimes you'll find if you click\noff of there, and you come back in,\n\n747\n00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.510\nthat does force the refresh, and it's\neasy enough to get that to come back up.\n\n748\n00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.689\nSo just a few little tips and tricks.\n\n749\n00:32:47.689 --> 00:32:49.621\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; For managing your intemperate console\n\n750\n00:32:49.621 --> 00:32:51.680\nthere if it doesn't pay attention to you.\n\n751\n00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.975\n&gt;&gt; Seems like you've done this once or\ntwice\n\n752\n00:32:52.975 --> 00:32:54.508\n&gt;&gt; No, I actually just close my eyes.\n\n753\n00:32:54.508 --> 00:32:55.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hope for the best.\n\n754\n00:32:55.605 --> 00:32:57.592\n&gt;&gt; And I pretend, I hope for the best.\n\n755\n00:32:57.592 --> 00:32:58.384\nAbsolutely.\n\n756\n00:32:58.384 --> 00:33:01.988\nSo you can see a creating of a dashboard\nview really not all that complicated quite\n\n757\n00:33:01.988 --> 00:33:03.472\nhonestly, creating any view for\n\n758\n00:33:03.472 --> 00:33:05.760\nthat matter really not\nthat complicated overall.\n\n759\n00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:10.810\n&gt;&gt; Able to do it in both the web console,\nso that’s kind of nice, we can go in and\n\n760\n00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:14.050\nout of there, do it on the full console,\nyou can see what we can do here and\n\n761\n00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:15.480\nthe value of that, obviously.\n\n762\n00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.310\nNow, if we wanna take a look at something\nlike this with some stuff running in it,\n\n763\n00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.530\nlet’s go in here and\nlet’s do the following real quick.\n\n764\n00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:26.626\nJust give me a second\njust to pull this one up,\n\n765\n00:33:26.626 --> 00:33:30.867\nwe’ll see if we can get something\nthat looks halfway decent.\n\n766\n00:33:30.867 --> 00:33:35.247\nLet's go in here, take a look at this one.\n\n767\n00:33:35.247 --> 00:33:36.783\nNo, that one doesn't have anything on it.\n\n768\n00:33:36.783 --> 00:33:41.005\nOne second, yeah, these don't,\nthat's not the one I wanted.\n\n769\n00:33:41.005 --> 00:33:45.798\nLet me go down here.\n\n770\n00:33:45.798 --> 00:33:48.268\nOperations Manager,\nthat's the one I wanted.\n\n771\n00:33:48.268 --> 00:33:51.414\n&gt;&gt; And management group health,\nthis is kind of a cool one.\n\n772\n00:33:51.414 --> 00:33:54.277\nThis is a dashboard that's been\npre-populated already and again,\n\n773\n00:33:54.277 --> 00:33:57.780\nthis is simple it's just got the widgets\nthat are basically just displaying.\n\n774\n00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.550\nBut it's nice because you can see,\nthis is one of the built in ones,\n\n775\n00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:04.900\nmonitoring with the monitoring pack for\nsystem center ops manager itself.\n\n776\n00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.478\nThis is already gonna be populated\nis what I was trying to say.\n\n777\n00:34:09.478 --> 00:34:12.824\nIt will have data in it even if we just\nturn the system on because it's doing self\n\n778\n00:34:12.824 --> 00:34:13.950\nmonitoring all the time.\n\n779\n00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:16.757\nSo, we can see what this one\nwould actually look like and\n\n780\n00:34:16.757 --> 00:34:19.100\nwe can see the resource pools are healthy.\n\n781\n00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.860\nWe can see the web user interfaces,\n\n782\n00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.250\nwhich we know are healthy because\nwe were just using the web console.\n\n783\n00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:24.150\nSo, that's good.\n\n784\n00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.706\nWe can see the alert view here.\n\n785\n00:34:25.706 --> 00:34:29.387\nWe could see the group infrastructure,\nthe Ops database seems to be healthy,\n\n786\n00:34:29.387 --> 00:34:33.124\nthe database, warehouse database seems\nto be healthy but we have some alerts on\n\n787\n00:34:33.124 --> 00:34:36.800\nthe management group in the management\nserver, a warning sign at some kind.\n\n788\n00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.180\nWe may wanna delve in and\nsee more about that, and\n\n789\n00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:44.170\nif we did, highlighted here, notice\nthe change in view off to the right.\n\n790\n00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:47.990\nAnd then we get reports that we may\nwanna go in and take a look at.\n\n791\n00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:51.334\nWe could drill down and say you know,\nI'd like to see what's going on.\n\n792\n00:34:51.334 --> 00:34:53.477\nIf we can go full screen\nbecause it's behind me,\n\n793\n00:34:53.477 --> 00:34:56.310\nyou'll be able to see we have\nthings like the health status.\n\n794\n00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.500\nWe have the availability, we have alerts.\n\n795\n00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.880\nWe may be able to generate or\nsee what's going on.\n\n796\n00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.950\nSo we can go in and see, and\n\n797\n00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:07.790\nlet's just pull up the Health Report here\nreal quick, give that just a moment.\n\n798\n00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:12.717\nRight, so we've got that set up,\nhourly, use that,\n\n799\n00:35:12.717 --> 00:35:16.363\ndo that and let's just run that.\n\n800\n00:35:16.363 --> 00:35:19.250\nWe got to do from and to,\nsorry, I did not realize that.\n\n801\n00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:24.706\nFrom today, to, or\nlet's do from yesterday rather.\n\n802\n00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:27.332\nThere we go can't do from yesterday or\nrather from today,\n\n803\n00:35:27.332 --> 00:35:29.970\nto today at the same time frame\nthat won't work real well.\n\n804\n00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:31.060\nAll right so we got that.\n\n805\n00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.700\nLet's just set that parameter.\n\n806\n00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.966\nLet's click run now.\n\n807\n00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:37.277\nThat will hopefully at least shows us\nsome basic idea based on what's in\n\n808\n00:35:37.277 --> 00:35:39.360\nthe database, so, give that a second.\n\n809\n00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.170\nThis will show you what\na report looks like.\n\n810\n00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.580\n&gt;&gt; It's very pretty.\n\n811\n00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.520\n&gt;&gt; Lots of colors, right?\n\n812\n00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.817\nAnd so what we see when we\ngenerate a report like this is,\n\n813\n00:35:47.817 --> 00:35:52.518\nwe can open up we'll just click this just\ncan see what's going on here just shows\n\n814\n00:35:52.518 --> 00:35:56.656\nus that we may be able to down the plus\nsigns to open up certain things but\n\n815\n00:35:56.656 --> 00:36:00.021\nyou'll see we get a little,\nI guess you'd call it a key or\n\n816\n00:36:00.021 --> 00:36:03.561\na matrix up top tells us how to\nread what the information is.\n\n817\n00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:06.789\nIt shows us here that we have\navailability tracker, green is up, for\n\n818\n00:36:06.789 --> 00:36:08.437\nuptime, so that's good.\n\n819\n00:36:08.437 --> 00:36:11.347\nAnd then yellow over here\nis up with a warning, so\n\n820\n00:36:11.347 --> 00:36:14.927\nwe can see that we have some duration\ntime that may be in the warning area.\n\n821\n00:36:14.927 --> 00:36:17.697\nWe have some a lot that's in the green.\n\n822\n00:36:17.697 --> 00:36:20.015\nWe have a link here, can open this up.\n\n823\n00:36:20.015 --> 00:36:21.999\nJust click there, pull this down and\n\n824\n00:36:21.999 --> 00:36:25.905\nwe can see some additional information\nhere and it links back to views and\n\n825\n00:36:25.905 --> 00:36:30.323\nother areas that we can click through in\nthe report that are linked to this that'll\n\n826\n00:36:30.323 --> 00:36:33.750\nopen up in real time to give\nus additional information.\n\n827\n00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.480\nThis is one of the cool\nthings about reports and\n\n828\n00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.171\nthe ability to use dashboard and views\nwith reports to really drive through this\n\n829\n00:36:41.171 --> 00:36:43.920\ninformation from a variety\nof perspectives.\n\n830\n00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.720\nSo its actually pretty neat right?\n\n831\n00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:50.800\nWe can click, as you could see I clicked\non the green area and I can blow this up\n\n832\n00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.420\nand see more of a deeper dive into\nthe time zone around what was green or\n\n833\n00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.500\nwhat was yellow or\nif we had a red or blue whatever.\n\n834\n00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.522\nI remember your ROYGBIV right?\n\n835\n00:37:00.522 --> 00:37:01.080\n&gt;&gt; ROYGBIV?\n&gt;&gt; Red,\n\n836\n00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.758\norange, yellow, green blue,\nindigo, violet?\n\n837\n00:37:02.758 --> 00:37:04.096\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Your rainbow of colors?\n\n838\n00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:05.120\n&gt;&gt; The rainbow of colors, the prism.\n\n839\n00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.170\n&gt;&gt; The rainbow of colors, the prism, yeah.\n\n840\n00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.640\nSo we could click through there and\nyou could see when we scroll down,\n\n841\n00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.320\nwhich is kind of the really cool part.\n\n842\n00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:15.920\nYou could see, just kinda put that back\nup just a touch so you can see the top of\n\n843\n00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:21.080\nthe grid there, but you'll see that we\nhave the ability to see literally by\n\n844\n00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:25.982\nhour increments as we go here across\nthe 24 hour period, what our uptime or\n\n845\n00:37:25.982 --> 00:37:30.470\ndowntime break down was and it gives us\na percentage as we trail between the two.\n\n846\n00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.777\nSo we got some incredibly\ndetailed reporting,\n\n847\n00:37:33.777 --> 00:37:37.340\ndashboarding, viewing of\ndata that goes on here.\n\n848\n00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.862\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n849\n00:37:38.862 --> 00:37:40.025\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is very basic stuff\n\n850\n00:37:40.025 --> 00:37:42.480\nwe're using just some\nof the built in ones.\n\n851\n00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.440\nYou can really get into some\nincredibly detailed analytics when\n\n852\n00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.500\nyou start to build your own reports\ndashboards using the dashboard\n\n853\n00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.290\ncustomization tools we talked about,\nthe GMT tool.\n\n854\n00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:56.220\nIf you use the report designer that\nwe spoke about to build reports, and\n\n855\n00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:00.410\nthen link them, and create custom\nviews to bind them and show them all,\n\n856\n00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:02.940\nyou've got some incredibly\npowerful analytical tools here.\n\n857\n00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.330\nSo it's a pretty interesting product when\nyou start getting in under the hood,\n\n858\n00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:07.980\nstarting to look at some of\nthe stuff you can do in real time.\n\n859\n00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.430\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, definitely, definitely.\n\n860\n00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:13.599\nWe've seen the power of it thus far we've\nwatched all the three episodes of it now\n\n861\n00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:16.807\non how we can work with these dashboards,\ncustomize things.\n\n862\n00:38:16.807 --> 00:38:20.390\nYou know me I already talked about this\nhow I'm a big fan of customization\n\n863\n00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:23.310\nbecause I like things to\nwork the way my brain works.\n\n864\n00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.340\nIf that makes sense to\nyou good folks out there.\n\n865\n00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.786\nAnd Adam] I think you've done a splendid\njob of showing me how I can do\n\n866\n00:38:28.786 --> 00:38:30.936\nthat hopefully you can\ndo that now as well.\n\n867\n00:38:30.936 --> 00:38:34.730\nWe do thank you for stopping by Adam and\nshowing us how to work with dashboards\n\n868\n00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.650\nscorecards, only the cool\nstuff inside of SCOM for that.\n\n869\n00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:41.450\nBut, looking at our clock we're well\nout of our time for this episode.\n\n870\n00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:42.670\nSo we're gonna call it a day.\n\n871\n00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:43.840\nThanks for watching, everyone.\n\n872\n00:38:43.840 -->

00:00:16.890\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.830\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.750\nwe're back with more on our Datacenter\nMonitoring with Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.190\nJoining us yet again, of course, would\nbe none other than our good friend and\n\n10\n00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.000\nmentor, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.600\nAdam, so good to have you back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.360\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.990\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, it is going well.\n\n14\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.900\nSplendiferously is what I would suggest as\nan adjective to describe how it is going.\n\n15\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.640\nIf you don't like that one,\njust go with it.\n\n16\n00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.770\nIt's okay, whatever works for you.\n\n17\n00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.010\n&gt;&gt; It's good.\n&gt;&gt; It's good.\n\n18\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.150\nIt's good.\nSo we're gonna\n\n19\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.550\ncontinue our discussions here.\n\n20\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.950\nThought we'd delve a little bit into\nthe intricacies, the mystery and\n\n21\n00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.910\nthe beauty of configuring and\ncustomizing the operations console.\n\n22\n00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.460\nWe've been in there playing around for\na great deal of time,\n\n23\n00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.560\ntaking you on a guided tour through\nmany of the areas of the console, and\n\n24\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.170\nwe even looked under the hood in a few\nplaces, showing you some of the tips,\n\n25\n00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.350\nthe tricks and\nthe potential landmines that exist there.\n\n26\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.949\nBut what we haven't really done is gone\nspecifically in to one of the most\n\n27\n00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:15.830\nimportant areas, we've hinted at,\nwe've actually talked about it.\n\n28\n00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.860\nI've shown you what user roles are.\n\n29\n00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.819\nI haven't shown you how to create one, and\n\n30\n00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.250\nhaven't talked to you about the security\nimplications of doing that, and\n\n31\n00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.762\nhow we can scope and tailor, my two\nfavorite terms much like Hall and Oates.\n\n32\n00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:29.779\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can put them together right?\n\n33\n00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:31.420\nOr Starsky and Hutch.\n\n34\n00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Another really good 70s TV show\n\n35\n00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.650\ncombination.\n\n36\n00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.630\nYou know, we haven't really talked\nabout how we can use a rule and\n\n37\n00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.020\nassign a user to a rule,\nand then confine or\n\n38\n00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.700\nconstraint with that user gets\nto do based on that rule.\n\n39\n00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.850\nAnd this is a really big and\nimportant thought process.\n\n40\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.810\nSo we're gonna take\na look at some of this,\n\n41\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.280\nbring all that information together,\nthrow a little PowerShell in the mix.\n\n42\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.030\nI'll show you to do a few things, and\n\n43\n00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.650\nif we have some time after that,\nDaniel's gonna tell us a couple of jokes.\n\n44\n00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.340\nAnd depending on how they go, we may or\nmay not allow him to come back for\n\n45\n00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.955\nanother episode.\n\n46\n00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll see how all that comes together.\n\n47\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.905\nAll right, so let's start with\na little bit of vocabulary.\n\n48\n00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:10.080\nWell, we're talking about\nusing the SCOM console and\n\n49\n00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.990\nwe're talking about the ability to\nbe able to sign permissions and\n\n50\n00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.740\nuse user roles and profiles and scoping.\n\n51\n00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.400\nWe've gotta think about\nwhat all these terms mean,\n\n52\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.180\nbecause we throw these terms out,\nbut we don't often define them,\n\n53\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.130\nand really think through\nthe logic of what they are.\n\n54\n00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.800\nSo, let's start with the basics,\noperation, and or privilege.\n\n55\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.378\nThese terms, these concepts.\n\n56\n00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:32.790\nEssentially just any action that's carried\nout by a user with the appropriate level\n\n57\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.420\nof permission, is what an operation or\na privilege would entail,\n\n58\n00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.280\nwhat do we define it as, or\nwhat it would represent for us.\n\n59\n00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.250\nA profile is a collection of\noperations granted or given to a role.\n\n60\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.670\nSo we collect all of the operations\ntogether, the individual things,\n\n61\n00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.940\nthe actions that somebody can do,\ncollect them all up, and\n\n62\n00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.510\nwe give them to a role, and\nwe then call that a profile.\n\n63\n00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.580\nA scope defines the boundary\nthat the running profile or\n\n64\n00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.620\nthe use of that profile is\ngonna be constrained within.\n\n65\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.960\nSo we say that role or\nthat profile is scoped for authors,\n\n66\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.190\nis scoped on just the database servers,\nthings of that nature.\n\n67\n00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.510\nHow are we gonna specify\nwhere we're gonna do things.\n\n68\n00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.950\nRole assignment, the association of users\nand groups into an ops manager role.\n\n69\n00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.800\nIn other words, when you're thinking about\nactive directory of stuff like that,\n\n70\n00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.500\nwhere we put a user in their group and\n\n71\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.660\ngive them permissions as the result\nof that grant, or that right.\n\n72\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.950\nWe are assigning them to that role or that\ngroup, and that's what we think of here.\n\n73\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.790\nAnd the user role is defined by and\n\n74\n00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.300\ncreated by the combination of profile and\nscope together.\n\n75\n00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.410\nCombining those things together\nlets us create a user role,\n\n76\n00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.710\nwe're gonna right-click, create a new\nuser role, show you how that's done.\n\n77\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.500\nWe'll also take a look at PowerShell and\nsee how to do that from within PowerShell.\n\n78\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.370\nGot a few PowerShell scripts that\nI'm gonna throw your way there.\n\n79\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.630\nWe have some different\nbuilt-in profile types or\n\n80\n00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.250\nprofile types we can think through,\nthe logical ones, right?\n\n81\n00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.800\nIf I said to you,\n\n82\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.770\nwhat are some of the profiles we may think\nof, what would be at the top of your list?\n\n83\n00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.092\nDon't tell me administrator.\n\n84\n00:03:59.092 --> 00:04:00.814\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's at the top of everybody's list,\n\n85\n00:04:00.814 --> 00:04:01.960\neverybody knows that one.\n\n86\n00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.000\nPick one not everybody\nis going to think of.\n\n87\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.820\n&gt;&gt; Admins.\n[LAUGH] Probably backup operators, maybe.\n\n88\n00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.510\n&gt;&gt; So well, in a non-SCOM world,\nabsolutely.\n\n89\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.560\nBackup operator, certainly.\n\n90\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.210\nCertainly we would have backup operators,\nadministrators, domain admin.\n\n91\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.720\nEnterprise admin, right,\nall those traditional ones we think of.\n\n92\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.770\nBut let's think about what's built in or\nwhat's focused on the SCOM icon.\n\n93\n00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.310\nSo we're gonna certainly\nhave administrators.\n\n94\n00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.900\nWe'll have advanced operators,\nwe'll have operators.\n\n95\n00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.726\nWe'll have authors.\n\n96\n00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:31.590\nSo if somebody's gonna be able to go in,\ncreate a Management Pack,\n\n97\n00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.890\ncall them an author.\n\n98\n00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.282\nIf they're in the theater and\nwe say bravo, author, author.\n\n99\n00:04:35.282 --> 00:04:36.901\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That also works very well.\n\n100\n00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:40.310\nWe'll have a Read-Only Operator, so\npeople want to go window shopping but\n\n101\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.360\ncan't afford to buy anything,\nwe'll give them that.\n\n102\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.398\nThat's also, by the way,\ngreat to assign to senior-level managers,\n\n103\n00:04:46.398 --> 00:04:50.610\nsenior-level individuals that need to\nhave the ability to be able to go in and\n\n104\n00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.330\ncheck on things, but are not gonna\ndo day-to-day administration.\n\n105\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.170\nYou don't want them in\nthere making changes, but\n\n106\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.210\nyou wanna give them\nthe ability to poke around.\n\n107\n00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.210\nSo a read-only operator role will be good.\n\n108\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.920\nI would do over a report\nsecurity administrator\n\n109\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.560\nprofile that allows us to deal with\nreports and report related stuff.\n\n110\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.070\nSo these are obviously gonna be\nimportant for us to think about,\n\n111\n00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.750\nand we'll talk about some of them and\ntake a look at them in there.\n\n112\n00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.040\nWhy don't we go in real quick, and\n\n113\n00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.460\nbefore we do that,\nwe just bring up the right screen.\n\n114\n00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.490\nBefore we actually go and\ntake a look at the console if we could,\n\n115\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.430\nlet's just show you\nwhere to go on the web.\n\n116\n00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.490\nGet a little more information if\nwe need to with regards to this.\n\n117\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.220\nI don't think I charged\nmy finger during lunch.\n\n118\n00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.430\nLet me try this again one more time.\n\n119\n00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.460\nLet's make sure it's ready to go.\n\n120\n00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.298\nIf we could, please.\n\n121\n00:05:27.298 --> 00:05:29.260\nIt's misfiring.\n\n122\n00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Gotta get that fixed.\n\n123\n00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.680\nMust have take that in from my\n50,000 mile finger check up.\n\n124\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.548\nSo implementing user roles here.\n\n125\n00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:38.540\nI got a web page.\n\n126\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.550\nJust as we often do documentations,\nvery important, we've talked about,\n\n127\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.350\ngot a nice one here.\n\n128\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.030\nIt talks about all the different\nmoving parts I mentioned.\n\n129\n00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.282\nWe've got our profiles here, shows us what\nthe profiles are, shows us the scope,\n\n130\n00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:53.150\nwe've talked about this, how they equal\nuser roles, and then how we go through and\n\n131\n00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.390\nimplement everything and\nassign and then interact with it.\n\n132\n00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.110\nSo I'm gonna give you that URL, just make\nsure you're comfortable with what's here,\n\n133\n00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.210\nand you can read up on it if you need to.\n\n134\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.170\nHaving said that,\nwhat we're gonna do is go in here.\n\n135\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.810\nWe're gonna take a look under\nthe hood a little bit, and\n\n136\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.240\npoke around to just make sure our timer\nis going to stay current for our episode.\n\n137\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.010\nSo what we have, we're in the ops console,\n\n138\n00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.980\nwe're in the administration workspace,\nas you can see.\n\n139\n00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.480\nAnd over here, down towards the bottom\non the left hand side under security,\n\n140\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.310\nwe have the user roles.\n\n141\n00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.182\nSo if we click there, we have our\nuser roles separated out by profiles.\n\n142\n00:06:26.182 --> 00:06:29.410\nAdministrator, as I mentioned,\nAdvanced Operator,\n\n143\n00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.250\nApplication Monitoring Operator, etc.\n\n144\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.600\nYou can roll down and see what's there.\n\n145\n00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.470\nAnd you may notice I have\none highlighted here.\n\n146\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.810\nIf we could just go full-screen so\nyou could see that a little bit better.\n\n147\n00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.090\nYou'll see ITProTV show hosts,\n\n148\n00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.820\nthat's not a normal one that shows up\nthere, I created that one obviously.\n\n149\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.700\nSo we're gonna go in and tell you how we\ndid that and show you what to do there.\n\n150\n00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.490\nNow we do have two options for you.\n\n151\n00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.490\nWe can do this by\nright-clicking in the console.\n\n152\n00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.510\nAnd down here under new user role.\n\n153\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.640\nWe could choose one of the pre-made\nprofiles and assign that.\n\n154\n00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.580\nSo, let's say we wanna go in,\nwe did that one as an advanced operator.\n\n155\n00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.900\nSo let's do this one under author, right.\n\n156\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.817\nSo we'll choose an author role here,\n\n157\n00:07:08.817 --> 00:07:12.197\nand we'll give it a name,\n\n158\n00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:17.740\nlet's call this one Adam ITProTV Role 1.\n\n159\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.538\nAnd we'll highlight that, so\nif we wanna do another one,\n\n160\n00:07:21.538 --> 00:07:23.330\nwe can paste that in there.\n\n161\n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.260\nAnd there's my favorite part of\nthe interface there, the paste window.\n\n162\n00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.330\nAll right, so we have that.\n\n163\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.660\nWe have a little description here.\n\n164\n00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.420\nTells us what the profiles gonna be.\n\n165\n00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.930\nNotice we can add role members in here,\nso we can assign users to this role and\n\n166\n00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.090\nspecify that they're gonna be given\nthis right if wanna be able to do that.\n\n167\n00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.480\nWe'll click next here.\n\n168\n00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.380\nApprove targets.\n\n169\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.160\nAll targets automatically approved,\n\n170\n00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.075\nincluding targets in management packs\nthat are imported in the future.\n\n171\n00:07:48.075 --> 00:07:50.964\nOur only targets explicitly added to\nthe approved targets grid are gonna\n\n172\n00:07:50.964 --> 00:07:51.542\nbe approved.\n\n173\n00:07:51.542 --> 00:07:56.529\nSo if I specify only approved targets and\nI click Add, what I'm doing is,\n\n174\n00:07:56.529 --> 00:08:01.276\nI'm specifying that the users that\nare assigned to this role All their\n\n175\n00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:05.863\ngonna be able to work with these\nspecific Management Pack Objects,\n\n176\n00:08:05.863 --> 00:08:07.735\nnot the entire interface.\n\n177\n00:08:07.735 --> 00:08:09.482\nBut only the things I decide.\n\n178\n00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:15.414\nSo maybe I may just wanna allow them to\nwork with the Agent related stuff, right?\n\n179\n00:08:15.414 --> 00:08:18.391\nSpecify that, they won't be able\nto work with anything else.\n\n180\n00:08:18.391 --> 00:08:21.080\nClick Next, Group Scope.\n\n181\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.990\nApprove the groups, members of\nthe user role can send overrides and\n\n182\n00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.940\nmonitor objects in approved groups.\n\n183\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.630\nAgain, notice here that everything\nis selected inside of the group.\n\n184\n00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:35.187\nIf I wanna change that, let me just\nuncheck, essentially select all.\n\n185\n00:08:35.187 --> 00:08:37.776\nAnd then I can go in and\nI can specify that they only\n\n186\n00:08:37.776 --> 00:08:41.790\nhave rights to be able to go in and\nwork with whatever I select here.\n\n187\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.083\nSo maybe age and\nlist managed computers and\n\n188\n00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:50.032\nmaybe network monitoring or\nsomething of that particular ilk.\n\n189\n00:08:50.032 --> 00:08:51.081\nWe'll click Next.\n\n190\n00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:54.960\nAgain all tasks automatically\navailable only ones that I add to\n\n191\n00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.210\nthe task grid here.\n\n192\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.052\nLet's specify and scroll down and\n\n193\n00:09:00.052 --> 00:09:06.279\nwe will specify that only\nthe ability to work with FTP and\n\n194\n00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:12.254\nSMTP services in the pause\narea are gonna be allowed.\n\n195\n00:09:12.254 --> 00:09:17.214\nAnd so we'll just put those in there,\nlet's click Next.\n\n196\n00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:18.815\nDashboards and Views same thing.\n\n197\n00:09:18.815 --> 00:09:22.459\nWe're gonna let them see all\nthe dashboards, or can we curtail that and\n\n198\n00:09:22.459 --> 00:09:24.112\nonly let them see certain ones.\n\n199\n00:09:24.112 --> 00:09:28.529\nSo again, let me gonna go in here,\nMonitoring Tree, under OPS Manager.\n\n200\n00:09:28.529 --> 00:09:31.995\nWhat dashboards and or\nviews am I gonna give them.\n\n201\n00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:34.577\nI'm gonna say they can see Active Alerts.\n\n202\n00:09:34.577 --> 00:09:37.889\nAnd I'm gonna see that they can\nsee Management Group Health and\n\n203\n00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:40.090\nGroup Health Trending but nothing else.\n\n204\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.096\nThey're only gonna see those.\n\n205\n00:09:42.096 --> 00:09:44.478\nAnd if I want to, on Task Pane,\n\n206\n00:09:44.478 --> 00:09:49.996\nI can add in the dashboards that this\nuser can access from the Task Pane.\n\n207\n00:09:49.996 --> 00:09:53.412\nYou know how we pop up certain actions and\nwe have them on the right, we say,\n\n208\n00:09:53.412 --> 00:09:56.880\nyou can click here and it'll do these\nfive things all linked together.\n\n209\n00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.620\nWe can control every aspect of this\nby creating a role and populating it.\n\n210\n00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.226\nThis is one of the strengths,\nthe hidden strengths, of the console.\n\n211\n00:10:03.226 --> 00:10:07.480\nA lot of people don't realize the strength\nof filtering through a user role and\n\n212\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.424\ndefining that role to this degree.\n\n213\n00:10:09.424 --> 00:10:12.001\nUnless you go in and you really\nthink through the logic of this,\n\n214\n00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:12.884\nyou don't see this.\n\n215\n00:10:12.884 --> 00:10:14.787\nNow the interesting thing\nI'm gonna show you.\n\n216\n00:10:14.787 --> 00:10:18.729\nIf we create this through PowerShell,\nwe just the basic PowerShell commands.\n\n217\n00:10:18.729 --> 00:10:21.614\nWe don't get to do all this stuff,\nwe can go back to it after the fact.\n\n218\n00:10:21.614 --> 00:10:24.220\nWe do have additional parameters\nwe can specify to do this stuff.\n\n219\n00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.196\nBut it's a little complicated in\nPowerShell to script all this out,\n\n220\n00:10:27.196 --> 00:10:29.720\nscanning the names of everything,\nit's more involved.\n\n221\n00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.334\nIt's easier to do just to do\nthe basic creation then come back in,\n\n222\n00:10:33.334 --> 00:10:37.690\nedit all the fine details to subdivide\nhere inside the actual console itself.\n\n223\n00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.400\nSo, we'll just look at that in a minute,\n\n224\n00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.140\nbut let's just say I do a network\nno dashboard or whatever.\n\n225\n00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.540\nHere, just to make a choice.\n\n226\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.492\nWe'll click Ok, hit Next.\n\n227\n00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:48.052\nKinda got our summary there.\n\n228\n00:10:48.052 --> 00:10:50.149\nPut all that together, click Create.\n\n229\n00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.430\nWe have all that.\n\n230\n00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.340\nThat showed up right here.\n\n231\n00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.051\nAnd then as I was suggesting, right?\n\n232\n00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:59.479\nLet's say just we created this role and\nwe wanted to go in and modify it.\n\n233\n00:10:59.479 --> 00:11:02.091\nAll we have to do is right-click.\n\n234\n00:11:02.091 --> 00:11:06.426\nGo into Properties and\nwe can simply go in and edit that.\n\n235\n00:11:06.426 --> 00:11:11.269\nAnd go to any one of these areas that we\ncan specify what we already made choices\n\n236\n00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.875\naround.\n\n237\n00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:16.051\nAnd just decide to add, remove,\nor modify as needed as we go.\n\n238\n00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.117\nSo we can create a user role.\n\n239\n00:11:18.117 --> 00:11:20.478\nAnd assign,\nI didn't bother putting anybody in there,\n\n240\n00:11:20.478 --> 00:11:22.553\nbecause assign members to\nit as well very easily.\n\n241\n00:11:22.553 --> 00:11:25.846\nAnd then we log in, that's what\nwe get when we open the console.\n\n242\n00:11:25.846 --> 00:11:30.005\nSo if you are working in an environment\nwhere somebody gets a console view that's\n\n243\n00:11:30.005 --> 00:11:33.444\nmodified, they have a restricted\nconsole essentially, right?\n\n244\n00:11:33.444 --> 00:11:38.341\nWe do what's called security trimming\nthe UI, which essentially means we apply\n\n245\n00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:42.300\nthe security overlay of the role\nto the user as they log in.\n\n246\n00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.310\nNarrowing and\nessentially filtering the console so\n\n247\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.160\nall they get is the properties or\nthe specified scope applied.\n\n248\n00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.570\nAnd the specifics of what you\nassign to them and nothing more.\n\n249\n00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.590\nSo if somebody really pisses you off,\n\n250\n00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.130\nthis is what you gotta do\nwhile they're at lunch.\n\n251\n00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.577\nHave them come back, log out, log in and\nI don't know what happened, I'm not sure.\n\n252\n00:11:59.577 --> 00:12:00.506\nBut I just\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:12:00.506 --> 00:12:01.737\n&gt;&gt; I know if you wait long enough, and\n\n254\n00:12:01.737 --> 00:12:03.649\nthere's a box of chocolate\non my desk in the morning,\n\n255\n00:12:03.649 --> 00:12:05.024\nI bet you things are gonna get better.\n\n256\n00:12:05.024 --> 00:12:06.591\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting how\nthat works out, isnt' it?\n\n257\n00:12:06.591 --> 00:12:07.142\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n258\n00:12:07.142 --> 00:12:11.334\n&gt;&gt; But I do love this because it makes our\njobs as administrators a whole lot easier.\n\n259\n00:12:11.334 --> 00:12:13.730\nYeah, you do a lot of work\non the front end, but\n\n260\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.142\nit saves you a whole lot\nof work on the back end.\n\n261\n00:12:16.142 --> 00:12:18.940\nYou have people coming up to you,\nhey I can't do such and such.\n\n262\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.313\nYeah, well that's because\nthat's not your job.\n\n263\n00:12:21.313 --> 00:12:22.873\nSo, you shouldn't be doing that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n264\n00:12:22.873 --> 00:12:24.401\n&gt;&gt; You're absolutely right,\n\n265\n00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:26.061\nwe don't want you doing that.\n\n266\n00:12:26.061 --> 00:12:28.305\n&gt;&gt; If you need access,\ngo get it submitted as a work ticket, and\n\n267\n00:12:28.305 --> 00:12:29.450\nwill talk about it after that.\n\n268\n00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.957\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\n\n269\n00:12:30.957 --> 00:12:33.659\nlet's take a look at how we will\ndo the same thing in PowerShell.\n\n270\n00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:36.442\nI just pulled up the PowerShell Ops\nManager Shell while we were chatting and\n\n271\n00:12:36.442 --> 00:12:37.956\nI've already got the command in there.\n\n272\n00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:38.912\nI already put it in,\n\n273\n00:12:38.912 --> 00:12:42.810\nthat's how I actually created ITProTV\nShowHosts, I did it through PowerShell.\n\n274\n00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.511\nBut you can see the command, let me\njust move this over just a little bit so\n\n275\n00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:48.341\nyou guys can see that on the screen.\n\n276\n00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:50.784\nYou'll see here, Add-SCOMUserRole.\n\n277\n00:12:50.784 --> 00:12:53.046\nName, specify the name, put it in quotes.\n\n278\n00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:55.259\nSo we have a space there,\nwant a little string to name it.\n\n279\n00:12:55.259 --> 00:12:56.692\nITProTV ShowHosts.\n\n280\n00:12:56.692 --> 00:13:00.790\nAdvancedOperator, that's the name\nof the profile that we wanna use.\n\n281\n00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.899\nSo I put it into\nthe AdvancedOperator's group or\n\n282\n00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:05.425\nthe AdvancedOperator's profile rather,\nwas defined.\n\n283\n00:13:05.425 --> 00:13:06.030\nSo, I did that.\n\n284\n00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.342\nYou'll see it was successful.\n\n285\n00:13:07.342 --> 00:13:09.930\nAnd then once I did that, boom, shows up.\n\n286\n00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.878\nNow I did have an issue\nwhere I created it,\n\n287\n00:13:11.878 --> 00:13:14.173\nthe console was not\nupdating as I've shown you.\n\n288\n00:13:14.173 --> 00:13:15.463\nThat's sometimes the case.\n\n289\n00:13:15.463 --> 00:13:18.920\nSo if the console doesn't update\nnecessarily and you need to bring that up.\n\n290\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.613\nYou know the trick by now, refresh.\n\n291\n00:13:20.613 --> 00:13:22.966\nOne of the things you can do here.\n\n292\n00:13:22.966 --> 00:13:26.911\nRight-click right on the profile\nitself and just choose refresh and\n\n293\n00:13:26.911 --> 00:13:31.070\nyou can get that to come up, as opposed\nto having to refresh everything.\n\n294\n00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.225\nAnd you actually can click right on\nthe profile and create a user role,\n\n295\n00:13:34.225 --> 00:13:35.090\nright from there.\n\n296\n00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.033\nIt's the same thing,\nit's just a matter of where you click.\n\n297\n00:13:37.033 --> 00:13:40.375\nSo we can go in and we can do that and we\ncan use PowerShell to be able to create or\n\n298\n00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:42.803\ninstantiate that profile and\nput a user role in place.\n\n299\n00:13:42.803 --> 00:13:46.384\nSo that may be one way for\nus to do a little customization.\n\n300\n00:13:46.384 --> 00:13:48.893\nAnd to do a little configuration\nmanagement in there.\n\n301\n00:13:48.893 --> 00:13:51.388\nWe talked about creating views and\nalerts and\n\n302\n00:13:51.388 --> 00:13:54.024\nalert resolution states\nin the prior episode.\n\n303\n00:13:54.024 --> 00:13:55.938\nWe didn't really go into\nalert resolution state.\n\n304\n00:13:55.938 --> 00:13:57.373\nI did hint at the fact we could do it.\n\n305\n00:13:57.373 --> 00:13:58.623\nI've shown you how to do it before.\n\n306\n00:13:58.623 --> 00:14:01.301\nWe are gonna show you how to\nmodify that again right now.\n\n307\n00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:04.083\nBut just to remind you,\nwe went in in the last episode,\n\n308\n00:14:04.083 --> 00:14:06.694\nwe'll just come up here\nto Monitoring real quick.\n\n309\n00:14:06.694 --> 00:14:10.822\nAnd we went through and you can see the\nview that I was using when we got done.\n\n310\n00:14:10.822 --> 00:14:14.146\nThe dashboard view, that we showed you in\nthe last episode, is still sitting here.\n\n311\n00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:18.676\nBut we went up here into Monitoring,\nyou can see our Daniel Column View,\n\n312\n00:14:18.676 --> 00:14:21.584\nDaniel Alert Me Now view,\nDaniel State view.\n\n313\n00:14:21.584 --> 00:14:23.024\nDaniel's been a busy boy, right?\n\n314\n00:14:23.024 --> 00:14:25.205\nSo you can see all the different\nviews we were using and\n\n315\n00:14:25.205 --> 00:14:26.426\ndemoing in the last episode.\n\n316\n00:14:26.426 --> 00:14:29.262\nWe haven't changed out the console yet,\nthey're still there.\n\n317\n00:14:29.262 --> 00:14:32.142\nAnd just to remind you,\nin case you didn't see the episode yet.\n\n318\n00:14:32.142 --> 00:14:34.311\nWe kinda gave it away and\nspoiled it for you.\n\n319\n00:14:34.311 --> 00:14:37.064\nBut the ideas that we went through,\nright-click and\n\n320\n00:14:37.064 --> 00:14:38.603\nchose to create these views.\n\n321\n00:14:38.603 --> 00:14:42.402\nAnd actually went through and created\nseveral of them just to demo them for you.\n\n322\n00:14:42.402 --> 00:14:45.310\nSo just reminding you of that.\n\n323\n00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.329\nNow the other thing that was nice here,\n\n324\n00:14:48.329 --> 00:14:53.006\nI'll just go in here real quick and\nshow you one other thing.\n\n325\n00:14:53.006 --> 00:14:56.090\nLet's close this up real quick,\nclose this up real quick.\n\n326\n00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.919\nAnd one other thing that\nis actually kind of cool,\n\n327\n00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:03.849\nup under Application Monitoring,\nup under here.\n\n328\n00:15:08.697 --> 00:15:11.008\nActually that's not the one we want,\none second.\n\n329\n00:15:14.327 --> 00:15:15.862\nWe did show you this view earlier.\n\n330\n00:15:15.862 --> 00:15:19.515\nI showed you the,\nwe started with this application view.\n\n331\n00:15:19.515 --> 00:15:21.973\nAnd we showed you just all the bells and\nwhistles that went on here.\n\n332\n00:15:21.973 --> 00:15:25.804\nBut what we can do right\nfrom here Is the following.\n\n333\n00:15:25.804 --> 00:15:27.940\nLet me bring this up.\n\n334\n00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.907\nBring up Network Vicinity.\n\n335\n00:15:30.907 --> 00:15:33.358\nAnd so, the Network Vicinity view\nis one we didn't look at yet, but\n\n336\n00:15:33.358 --> 00:15:34.607\nit's kind of an interesting one.\n\n337\n00:15:34.607 --> 00:15:37.795\nI just wanted to demo it for you real\nquickly while we're talking about views.\n\n338\n00:15:37.795 --> 00:15:42.521\nSo this allows us to be able to go in, and\nin a multi-tiered architecture with a lot\n\n339\n00:15:42.521 --> 00:15:46.190\nof stuff sitting around us,\nbe able to actually drill in.\n\n340\n00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.671\nAnd see all the pieces that are linked and\nthe status of them and the health of them.\n\n341\n00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:54.618\nAnd you can see when I click here,\nI can go in and I can launch the console.\n\n342\n00:15:54.618 --> 00:15:56.646\nYou may wanna go full screen just to be\nable to see this a little bit better.\n\n343\n00:15:56.646 --> 00:16:01.042\nWe did take a look at the application\nvisor diagnostics console before.\n\n344\n00:16:01.042 --> 00:16:02.480\nI showed you how to launch them.\n\n345\n00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.460\nWe can launch them right from here.\n\n346\n00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.830\nWe can go in, look at the health explorer.\n\n347\n00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.015\nWe can navigate through and\nsee all the different views.\n\n348\n00:16:10.015 --> 00:16:11.221\nUse right from here.\n\n349\n00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.495\nYou can take a look at report\ntasks right from here.\n\n350\n00:16:13.495 --> 00:16:15.235\nJust on this one entity.\n\n351\n00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:17.935\nBut obviously,\nif you have a very strong and a very,\n\n352\n00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:21.195\nvery robust architecture,\nwe're gonna see a lot more.\n\n353\n00:16:21.195 --> 00:16:24.455\nLet's take a look at a slightly\ndifferent way of seeing this view\n\n354\n00:16:24.455 --> 00:16:28.185\nfrom a different application or\ndifferent monitoring perspective.\n\n355\n00:16:28.185 --> 00:16:29.695\nLet me clean this up real quick.\n\n356\n00:16:29.695 --> 00:16:33.340\nJust give me one second to\nchange the view out here.\n\n357\n00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.712\nGonna come down here.\n\n358\n00:16:34.712 --> 00:16:37.400\nLet's go up under Operations Manager and\n\n359\n00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.630\nlet's go into the Diagram View,\nanother really cool view.\n\n360\n00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.550\nManagement group diagram,\n\n361\n00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.515\nanother way of looking at interactive\nviews that we haven't seen before.\n\n362\n00:16:47.515 --> 00:16:50.595\nAlways try to bring something new to\nthe table and the conversation for\n\n363\n00:16:50.595 --> 00:16:51.765\nyou when we're doing a demo.\n\n364\n00:16:51.765 --> 00:16:54.435\nAnd sprinkle in, sprinkling in or\n\n365\n00:16:54.435 --> 00:16:58.540\non a little extra added view value,\nas we say here.\n\n366\n00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.640\nThe VV.\n\n367\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.050\nSo this one's kinda interesting as well,\nthis one is cool.\n\n368\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.750\nThis shows us the breakdown\nof the ops manager group.\n\n369\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:09.070\nAnd in a hierarchical diagram,\nlays out all the components and\n\n370\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:13.540\nmoving parts and shows us real-time health\nstatus on all of them as we click through.\n\n371\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.720\nSo we start with the ops\nmanager group itself up here.\n\n372\n00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.150\nAnd then if we scroll over,\nthis is kind of hard to see everything.\n\n373\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.370\nWe can see we have the AD assignment pool.\n\n374\n00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:24.400\nThe agent exception monitoring.\n\n375\n00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.420\nThe all management pool.\n\n376\n00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.880\nThe auto collection services.\n\n377\n00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.640\nWe talked about all these parts before.\n\n378\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.706\nWe have our data access services, our\ndatabases, we'll open that up in a minute.\n\n379\n00:17:32.706 --> 00:17:34.740\nGot our management configuration.\n\n380\n00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.470\nGot all the different parts here and\nany one of them.\n\n381\n00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:43.540\nAs we open the mob and click on them may\nor may have additional items down below.\n\n382\n00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.820\nWe could see here there is a warning,\nmaybe something going on here.\n\n383\n00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.340\nAnd we may have something\nhierarchically below this.\n\n384\n00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.080\nIf not,\nwe least get some information about this.\n\n385\n00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.700\nBut let's drill in under the database\nis where we know for a fact.\n\n386\n00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.440\nWe are gonna see some stuff.\n\n387\n00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.690\nLet's open this up.\n\n388\n00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.930\nAnd we'll see our two databases down here.\n\n389\n00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.990\nOur data warehouse and\nour operational manager database.\n\n390\n00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.090\nAnd under each one, we have a green check.\n\n391\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:06.640\nWhich is good.\n\n392\n00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.002\nThat indicates that they're healthy.\n\n393\n00:18:08.002 --> 00:18:09.720\nAnd we can drill down.\n\n394\n00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.830\nAnd we can see, and I love the risky\nbusiness icon for the watcher.\n\n395\n00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.170\nThat's the watcher icon.\n\n396\n00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.160\nRight, for the actual service\nit's running and watching.\n\n397\n00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.930\nSo we could see that we are able to, so we\ncontinue to drill down see the hierarchy.\n\n398\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:25.980\nWe could see the connectivity here.\n\n399\n00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.450\nIf there's something they're linked\nto all the way over here, right,\n\n400\n00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:34.430\nand all the way back up there\nshows us what is linked to and\n\n401\n00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.570\nwhatever that item is\nthat is interacting with.\n\n402\n00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.400\nRight, we could see the web user\ninterfaces over here again, you have to\n\n403\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.590\nknow, just what's there, what may or\nmay not be available in the hierarchy.\n\n404\n00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.880\nRoot console is healthy,\nweb console is healthy, right?\n\n405\n00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.130\nWe've been looking at these components,\n\n406\n00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.000\nbut we haven't actually seen\na heads up all out view.\n\n407\n00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000\nYou may have been in someone's office\nwhere they have the plotter print out.\n\n408\n00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.009\nYou know,\nthey do the big plotter prints and\n\n409\n00:18:57.009 --> 00:19:00.062\nthey've got the architecture\ndiagram up on the wall for.\n\n410\n00:19:00.062 --> 00:19:01.470\nYou ever wonder how they got that?\n\n411\n00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.570\nWell that's what you're\nlooking at right there.\n\n412\n00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.340\nRight, so this views built in with\nthe monitoring pack for SCOM.\n\n413\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.645\nYou can make this view for\nany of your architectural elements or for\n\n414\n00:19:10.645 --> 00:19:13.014\nyour distributed\napplications if you want to.\n\n415\n00:19:13.014 --> 00:19:15.280\nAll you have to do is go on and\ncreate the right view.\n\n416\n00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.530\nThis is called the group\ndiagram in this case.\n\n417\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:22.460\nBut it's just a view of the architecture\nand the distributive components.\n\n418\n00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.950\nSo, it's nice to be able to see some\nof these digital elements as we're\n\n419\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.970\nkinda going through here and\njust taking a look.\n\n420\n00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.270\nSo, reminding yourself of how to\ncreate some different views and\n\n421\n00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.460\nwhat you can do with them.\n\n422\n00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:37.860\nAnd these things, any one these elements,\nwe can right click on and you'll see here.\n\n423\n00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.130\nIf we can go full screen just to see it,\ncuz it's kind of,\n\n424\n00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.630\nhalf of it's kinda behind there\nbecause it's off to the side.\n\n425\n00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.320\nYou'll see that we can go in.\n\n426\n00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.970\nWe can open up the views associated\nwith this particular item.\n\n427\n00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.500\nYou'll see we can look at properties,\nhealth explorer,\n\n428\n00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.670\nopen the shell directly at this point\nto work with this particular items so\n\n429\n00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:57.290\nwe could open this operations\nmanager shell right from here.\n\n430\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.070\nWe can put an item in the maintenance\nmode if we need to, if it supports that.\n\n431\n00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.900\nSo it's nice, right.\n\n432\n00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.670\nSo we can go in,\nwe can interact in any of these items.\n\n433\n00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.180\nAnd we can see what's going on with them.\n\n434\n00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.340\nSo, your friends will come over here,\n\n435\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.740\nlet's say we have\na different set of options.\n\n436\n00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.510\nWe can open up the Views,\nwe can look at Instance Properties.\n\n437\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.380\nI said here see wherever the property is.\n\n438\n00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.690\nWe already have the Shell open,\nbut if we do this,\n\n439\n00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.220\nyou'll see it opens up\nanother version of the Shell.\n\n440\n00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.060\nThis what it looks like before I go in and\nfix it, make it bigger, nice and\n\n441\n00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.340\nbright for you to see, but you'll see\nwe can open the Shell right from here.\n\n442\n00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.800\nAnd we can interact with the management\nshell if we need to, right?\n\n443\n00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.290\nSo, the diagram is not just\na flat one dimensional diagram,\n\n444\n00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.180\nit's an active view of what's\ngoing on with your components and\n\n445\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.175\nactively able to be used to\nmanage them in real time.\n\n446\n00:20:46.175 --> 00:20:48.865\nAnd the status of this will refresh and\nupdate for you, so\n\n447\n00:20:48.865 --> 00:20:51.795\nthat you can see whether or\nnot things are continuing to be healthy.\n\n448\n00:20:51.795 --> 00:20:55.365\nSo this is a pretty cool additional set\nof views that we didn't touch on in\n\n449\n00:20:55.365 --> 00:20:59.085\nthe prior episode, but that way you\ncould see there is some additional stuff\n\n450\n00:20:59.085 --> 00:21:00.845\nthat you may wanna go in and\ntake a look at.\n\n451\n00:21:00.845 --> 00:21:03.885\nWe said we'd take a look at alert\nresolution states as well, so\n\n452\n00:21:03.885 --> 00:21:05.335\nlet's go back over here,\n\n453\n00:21:05.335 --> 00:21:10.190\ngo to administration this time we're\ngonna go into our settings area.\n\n454\n00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:14.160\nNow we've been in here before and I've\ngone into the alerts area under general\n\n455\n00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.150\nand I've brought this up,\nright click on properties here, and\n\n456\n00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:21.490\nI've shown you the alert states but we\nactually took a look at alert resolution.\n\n457\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.860\nI did a demo for\nyou with powershell where we modified that\n\n458\n00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.440\nusing the powershell ops manager\nshell in one of the earlier episodes.\n\n459\n00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.020\nWe showed you how to do that.\n\n460\n00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.760\nBut we also can modify\nalert resolution states.\n\n461\n00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.710\nAnd you may see here,\nITProTV alerting you,\n\n462\n00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:41.760\nwith a resolution state of ID17,\nor a resolution ID rather.\n\n463\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.705\nA resolution State ideas is what\nI meant to say, of number 17.\n\n464\n00:21:45.705 --> 00:21:50.735\nSo, we do have the ability to go in here\nand program in our resolution states.\n\n465\n00:21:50.735 --> 00:21:54.495\nAnd if you remember, in the prior episode,\nwhere we were looking at this, I right\n\n466\n00:21:54.495 --> 00:21:58.425\nclicked and I showed you how to take that\nalert and set it to a resolution state.\n\n467\n00:21:58.425 --> 00:22:01.285\nAnd I showed you this custom\nalert state for resolution and\n\n468\n00:22:01.285 --> 00:22:03.425\nI said that's not gonna be there normally.\n\n469\n00:22:03.425 --> 00:22:05.155\nI created that, you'll come back,\n\n470\n00:22:05.155 --> 00:22:07.990\nsee this in the next episode and\nI'm gonna show you how to do that.\n\n471\n00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:09.280\nSo that's where this comes from.\n\n472\n00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.400\nNow, I could have done that right here\njust by clicking New and creating it, and\n\n473\n00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.330\nthat would have been easy.\n\n474\n00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.450\nAnd there's nothing wrong with doing that.\n\n475\n00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.070\nBut, for those of us that\nare perhaps just a slightly\n\n476\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.830\nmore adventurous group of administrators.\n\n477\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.900\nWe can also go in and\njust scroll down so you could see it.\n\n478\n00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.830\nWe could also go in right here to\nPowerShell And in Power Shell,\n\n479\n00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.970\nwe can use the ads com alert resolution\nstate commandlet, name parameter,\n\n480\n00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.060\nspecify the name.\n\n481\n00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.470\nYou can see ITProTV alerting you.\n\n482\n00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.500\nResolution state code specified 17.\n\n483\n00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.190\nDo that, goes through and it's successful.\n\n484\n00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.060\nNotice it has its own unique ID,\nits own unique string.\n\n485\n00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.700\nAnd when we do that, it shows up.\n\n486\n00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.500\nAnd then, when I go and I look at\nan alert, I can right-click and set that\n\n487\n00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.580\nalert state and resolve state rather,\nthe alert resolution state, to that code.\n\n488\n00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.900\nWe talked about tracking that alert\nthrough various stages of escalation in\n\n489\n00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.000\nthe life cycle.\n\n490\n00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.200\nAnd you could go in, profile in or\ncreate these custom resolution states.\n\n491\n00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.950\nAnd then, as you're doing that\nyou'll be able to go in and\n\n492\n00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:11.000\ndecide how to control them and\nconfigure them in the console.\n\n493\n00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.410\nSo, that's something you\njust may wanna think about.\n\n494\n00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.550\nAnd may decide may be of value to you.\n\n495\n00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.710\nA lot of customers will actually go in,\nor have asked me,\n\n496\n00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:22.180\nor I've told them how to go in and\ndo this, so they set this up to match\n\n497\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.920\ntheir escalation pathways with their SLAs,\nso they understand how to track alerts,\n\n498\n00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.440\nand then they can assign them\nas needed in the console.\n\n499\n00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.380\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n500\n00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.170\nThat's how we do this behind the scenes.\n\n501\n00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.640\nAnd if you set it with PowerShell,\nyou can edit in console and vice versa,\n\n502\n00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.460\nit goes either way,\nworks well in either direction.\n\n503\n00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.445\nSo we have a cornucopia of\nmethodologies here that you can use.\n\n504\n00:23:42.445 --> 00:23:45.713\nRemember we did also talk about\nnotification settings, talk about\n\n505\n00:23:45.713 --> 00:23:49.438\nnotification channels, how to use all of\nthose in prior episodes to set up and\n\n506\n00:23:49.438 --> 00:23:51.117\nsubscribe to updates for alerts.\n\n507\n00:23:51.117 --> 00:23:55.410\nWanted to just walk you back through that\nspecifically not to redo that again but\n\n508\n00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:59.704\njust to show you some quick PowerShell\nrelated commands that can be useful to set\n\n509\n00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:02.715\nthat up from the shell if you\nwant to do it From PowerShell\n\n510\n00:24:02.715 --> 00:24:05.571\ninstead of from within\nthe GUI like we talked about.\n\n511\n00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:09.770\nTake a look at the screen real quick\nright here, we can just go through this.\n\n512\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.980\nIf you wanted, we'll just keep it box\nin box, I'll just do one at a time.\n\n513\n00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.190\nWe'll kind of scroll down.\n\n514\n00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:17.980\nIf you want to set up a notification\nchannel directly using PowerShell.\n\n515\n00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.370\nYou'll see use the\nAdd.SCOMPNotificationChannel Cmdlet here.\n\n516\n00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.450\nTwo commands we add in, first one\ndeclares a variable called Body and\n\n517\n00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.450\nsets that up, and\nyou could see that there.\n\n518\n00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.370\nNext one adds a SCOMNotificationChannel,\ncalled ITProTV Channel or\n\n519\n00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.670\nwhatever you call it.\n\n520\n00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:38.220\nYou'd specify the server you’re gonna use,\nI specified the SIP server here.\n\n521\n00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.910\nAnd then, the UserName, and the UserName\nhas to be the SIP name for the user,\n\n522\n00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.100\nwhatever that is.\n\n523\n00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.030\nAnd then, the body of the message will\nactually be the body variable that was set\n\n524\n00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:48.940\nup above and\n\n525\n00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.930\nthen by doing that, that's actually what\nwe're then gonna be able to specify.\n\n526\n00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.340\nI showed you this content when we actually\ndid this in the console on a prior\n\n527\n00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:55.841\nepisode.\n\n528\n00:24:55.841 --> 00:24:59.448\nWe went in and took a look at the IM\nmessage field and saw the string of text\n\n529\n00:24:59.448 --> 00:25:03.496\nthat had to be programmed in and all the\nvariables that were associated with it.\n\n530\n00:25:03.496 --> 00:25:07.260\nThat's what we're approximating\nhere with the body variable, right?\n\n531\n00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.020\nIn the first one just so you know.\n\n532\n00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.110\nIf we wanna go ahead and we wanna\ncreate a notification for subscribers,\n\n533\n00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:17.050\nwe could do that with the\nAdd-SCOMNotificationSubscriber commandlet\n\n534\n00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:18.250\nright there.\n\n535\n00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.950\nAnd we can do that, you'll see it here.\n\n536\n00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:22.930\nThis is all one continuous string\nof PowerShell, by the way.\n\n537\n00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.670\nTruncated in the console,\nor in Notepad here.\n\n538\n00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:30.179\nBut after the comma at the end\nof the line here, so -DeviceList\n\n539\n00:25:30.179 --> 00:25:34.380\n\"Adam@ITProTV\", there would then be this,\nright?\n\n540\n00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.961\nThis would be following right after,\nsms : from an sms id, right?\n\n541\n00:25:37.961 --> 00:25:42.392\nThat would be the phone number to be\ntexting to, and then my sip id as well,\n\n542\n00:25:42.392 --> 00:25:42.900\nright?\n\n543\n00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.660\nObviously, those are just made up, but\n\n544\n00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.030\nyou would imagine you would substitute\nin your own variables for that.\n\n545\n00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:48.810\nAll right, for the last one,\n\n546\n00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.950\nwe are gonna have to go full screen\ncuz I can't scroll down anymore.\n\n547\n00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.460\nSo, you could see the last one.\n\n548\n00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.450\nHere, a new notification subscription.\n\n549\n00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.310\nSo, we did notification subscribers.\n\n550\n00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.630\nNow, we could use subscription.\n\n551\n00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.950\nSubscription is\nAdd-SCOMPNotificationSubscription.\n\n552\n00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.180\nSo that's the commandlet right there.\n\n553\n00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.560\nYou'll see here three different\ncommands issued one at a time.\n\n554\n00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.530\nTwo are creating variables for us.\n\n555\n00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.810\nThird one is then gonna pull those in and\nthen use those.\n\n556\n00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.720\nWe declare the subscriber variable,\n\n557\n00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.350\nthe channel variable\nspecified accordingly here.\n\n558\n00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.020\nAdd-SCOMNotificationSubscription.\n\n559\n00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.960\nName parameter specify the name.\n\n560\n00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.900\nSubscriber pull in the variable value for\nsubscriber.\n\n561\n00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.180\nChannel put in the variable value for\nChannel.\n\n562\n00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.830\nAnd they're displayed here and\nyou could see what they will be set to.\n\n563\n00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.840\nBy doing that, we're doing the same\nthing as right clicking in the console,\n\n564\n00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.920\nchoosing new and going in.\n\n565\n00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.271\nAnd actually specifying whatever\nthose particular channels may be or\n\n566\n00:26:37.271 --> 00:26:39.096\nwhatever those we're looking to do.\n\n567\n00:26:39.096 --> 00:26:43.756\nThe last thing we can take a look at,\nwe'll do this in a PowerShell.\n\n568\n00:26:43.756 --> 00:26:46.573\nMight as well just keep the screen\nreal quick, yeah, do box and box,\n\n569\n00:26:46.573 --> 00:26:47.270\nwe'll do that.\n\n570\n00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.670\nBut let me just show you one other\nitem which is the diagnostic and\n\n571\n00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.450\nrecovery tasks which are available.\n\n572\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:56.730\nYou may wanna list this in power show,\nsee what they are, if you wanna do that to\n\n573\n00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.880\nknow, from all the different ones that\nare there, what's available to you,\n\n574\n00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.140\nyou can do this now, I'm going to\nshow you how to do this two ways.\n\n575\n00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:09.390\nIf we have one that is specific, and\nthat we wanna be able to call out and\n\n576\n00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:13.525\nuse, we can just go in and use a wildcard\nsearch parameter in the string.\n\n577\n00:27:13.525 --> 00:27:16.125\nGet-SCOMDiagnostic is the commandlet.\n\n578\n00:27:16.125 --> 00:27:20.990\n-Name parameter, we just specify\nthe search string here, *ITProTV*,\n\n579\n00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.910\nanything with ITPro somewhere in the name.\n\n580\n00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:26.220\nWe'll then be able to go in and\npull that back.\n\n581\n00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.860\nSo, we could do that if we want.\n\n582\n00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.050\nAnd or Get-SCOMDiagnostic generically.\n\n583\n00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.220\nAnd if we do that,\nyou'll see that it lists out for us,\n\n584\n00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:39.250\nall of the recovery tasks that\nare in the console anywhere.\n\n585\n00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.840\nAnd as I scroll through,\nget a whole bunch of them here.\n\n586\n00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.550\nSkip past that right there.\n\n587\n00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.350\nBecause the next command down\nlists out our management packs.\n\n588\n00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.320\nAnd so we can see they're all listed here.\n\n589\n00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.880\nAnd these are coming in from the various\nmanagement packs that are available.\n\n590\n00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.899\nAnd things like, ping the computer.\n\n591\n00:27:55.899 --> 00:27:58.390\nYou can see that over here.\n\n592\n00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.750\nGo ahead and\nyou'll do a SQL broker diagnostic.\n\n593\n00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.610\nWindows SNMP Trap Service Diagnostic, etc.\n\n594\n00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:09.580\nYou may wanna get a listing of these and\nthen be able to figure out whether or\n\n595\n00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.324\nnot the task that you're looking for\nis available.\n\n596\n00:28:12.324 --> 00:28:13.980\nIf not, we may have to go and\ncreate one, or\n\n597\n00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.820\nat least know where to look to find\none and what it will be called.\n\n598\n00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.350\nSo, there's just some general commands,\nright, that may be helpful to you.\n\n599\n00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.800\nRemember, we did talk about\none of the prior episodes,\n\n600\n00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.630\nhow to bring up all of the cmdlets that\nare listed inside the Ops Manager shell.\n\n601\n00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.090\nIn case you wanna see them\nyou get command cmdlet,\n\n602\n00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.810\nwhich would then see a listing of them.\n\n603\n00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.240\nI showed you how to export\nthat out to a text file so\n\n604\n00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.040\nyou had a handy little reference so\nyou could then go through.\n\n605\n00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.970\nI also showed you how to use ICE,\nDaniel had been talking about\n\n606\n00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.940\nICE a little bit and said, hey, that's\na good idea why don't we bring that up.\n\n607\n00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.500\nWe took a look at ICE, and then we loaded\nin the ops manager module, and showed you\n\n608\n00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.380\nhow to use the search feature on the right\nhand side, to delve into those commands.\n\n609\n00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.170\nGet a better understanding of them,\nlook at the parameters, and\n\n610\n00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.160\nlearn a little bit more about them.\n\n611\n00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.390\nSo, showed you a lot of different ways\nto get in under the hood here if you\n\n612\n00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:02.000\ndon't remember those episodes or remember\nwhat we did, go back and take a look.\n\n613\n00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.582\nMay be valuable for you, especially\nif you're going to think about using\n\n614\n00:29:04.582 --> 00:29:06.843\nPowerShell to be able to go in and\ndo some of the customizations.\n\n615\n00:29:06.843 --> 00:29:09.770\nIf you're going to work in the console,\nyou've seen how to do that.\n\n616\n00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.390\nYou got options.\n\n617\n00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.435\nOptions are good, right?\n\n618\n00:29:12.435 --> 00:29:15.910\nCuz when we don't have options that, well,\nthen we just don't have options, right?\n\n619\n00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:16.800\nYou're kinda stuck.\n\n620\n00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.770\nBut if you do have options,\n\n621\n00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:21.580\nas you can see, we have a lot of different\nways to get to where we want to go.\n\n622\n00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.380\nSometimes PowerShell's good,\nsometimes Console's good,\n\n623\n00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.060\nsometimes a mixture of both is good.\n\n624\n00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.680\nYou just switch it up a little bit, right?\n\n625\n00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.860\nPut your toe in the water.\n\n626\n00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.420\nTry to start using\nPowerShell a little bit.\n\n627\n00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.610\nThe more you get comfortable with it,\nthe more you're gonna want to do and\n\n628\n00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:36.430\npretty soon, you're gonna be drinking\nfrom the UNIX/Linux Kool-Aid bowl and\n\n629\n00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.440\nyou're never going back, right?\n\n630\n00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.670\nYou're gonna be doing the CORE Nano thing.\n\n631\n00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:40.770\nThat'll be it, that'll be you.\n\n632\n00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.130\nSo, just think about that.\n\n633\n00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.240\nBut you can obviously administer\nthis tool in a variety of ways, and\n\n634\n00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.350\nthe more time you spend getting used\nto what's going on under the hood,\n\n635\n00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:49.330\nbetter off you're going to be.\n\n636\n00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:49.840\nAnd obviously,\n\n637\n00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.560\nas a result of that, more happy you\nare going to be with the outcome.\n\n638\n00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.090\nI have one more thing I want to show you.\n\n639\n00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.500\nSave the best for last.\n\n640\n00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.272\nSo, you're going to indulge me for\na minute,\n\n641\n00:29:57.272 --> 00:30:00.234\nbecause I still we've got some red on\nthe timer over there for a small sliver.\n\n642\n00:30:00.234 --> 00:30:01.305\n&gt;&gt; Put the cherry on the cake.\n\n643\n00:30:01.305 --> 00:30:02.770\n&gt;&gt; Put the cherry on the cake.\n\n644\n00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:07.510\nSo we want to just take at a few\nquick additional items in here for\n\n645\n00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.830\ncustomizations.\n\n646\n00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.340\nSo, we have them in the settings there.\n\n647\n00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.810\nWe showed the alerts area.\n\n648\n00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.160\nWanted to quickly run through some\nof the other settings with you.\n\n649\n00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.060\nShowed you a few of these is\nsome of the other episodes.\n\n650\n00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.240\nWant to show you one you\nmay not be familiar with.\n\n651\n00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.690\nWhich is hey,\nhow do I know where the console is and\n\n652\n00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.570\nhow to find it if I don't know the URL.\n\n653\n00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.800\nAnd how do I test it to make sure\nit's got Serverlite installed?\n\n654\n00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.730\nTalked about this one in the prior\nepisodes and sad hey if you go to do it\n\n655\n00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.800\nit's not there it doesn't load\nup maybe there's a problem.\n\n656\n00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.820\nI'm gonna show you how to\nfigure that out right now.\n\n657\n00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:33.820\nSo, let's go full screen just so\n\n658\n00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.490\nwe can see this cuz this\nis kind of important stuff.\n\n659\n00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.170\nWe're in settings, we're up here.\n\n660\n00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.430\nWe took a look at Heartbeat before.\n\n661\n00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.850\nWe're just gonna quickly run\nthrough the properties here.\n\n662\n00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:45.130\nThat's where we set the heartbeat\ninterval of 30 seconds by default, but\n\n663\n00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.870\nwe can modify that if we want.\n\n664\n00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.200\nI'm sorry, 60 seconds by default.\n\n665\n00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.010\nWhat am I thinking?\n\n666\n00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:52.790\nOnce a minute, we can modify that\nif we want to and change that out.\n\n667\n00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.930\nWe talked about alerts.\n\n668\n00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.810\nWe talked about database grooming before.\n\n669\n00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.970\nThis is where we go in and\nwe change the retention periods\n\n670\n00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.310\non all of the different items\nthat we're keeping data for.\n\n671\n00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.860\nYou saw me do this with\nPowerShell in a prior demo.\n\n672\n00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.160\nAnd set this up, we can edit them here.\n\n673\n00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.167\nWe can go in under privacy, this is where\nwe opt in or opt out of the customer\n\n674\n00:31:10.167 --> 00:31:14.773\nimproving program, error reporting, and\nall the stuff that we send to Microsoft.\n\n675\n00:31:14.773 --> 00:31:19.789\nIf you have a change\na heart just go in and\n\n676\n00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:28.455\nsay yes error reporting you could\nclick property that where we get.\n\n677\n00:31:28.455 --> 00:31:31.690\nAnd then it's simply gonna be :port 80 and\nthen report server,\n\n678\n00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:33.870\nyou can see it there, HTTP.\n\n679\n00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.860\nSo, we can go in and see that,\nwe have the ability to interact with that,\n\n680\n00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.220\nchange that to HTTPS if we need to,\nand we're good.\n\n681\n00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.088\nSo, we can get that and\nunderstand what it is if we're not sure.\n\n682\n00:31:42.088 --> 00:31:45.570\nOr, we talked about the web console,\nwe can see that here as well.\n\n683\n00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:49.380\nUnder web addresses, there's the address\nfor the web console right there.\n\n684\n00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.640\nThat little test button is what's\ngonna let you fire up that console.\n\n685\n00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.430\nYou can see me opening it up right here.\n\n686\n00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.256\nAlready had it open.\nBut if Serverlite's not loaded,\n\n687\n00:31:56.256 --> 00:31:59.991\nyou have a problem, it'll come up and say\nhey you need to do a little configuration.\n\n688\n00:31:59.991 --> 00:32:04.261\nThere's a little dialogue box, you click\non it, download server lite, log out,\n\n689\n00:32:04.261 --> 00:32:06.330\nlog back in, and you're ready to go.\n\n690\n00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:07.510\nSo, we have that.\n\n691\n00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.560\nAnd we could see that right there,\nright go in there, interact with that.\n\n692\n00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.690\nAnd then we have as we already saw\nHeartbeat and we have Security.\n\n693\n00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.660\nWe've talked about some of these before.\n\n694\n00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.290\nThis is an important one, let's just\ngo in here and talk about this for\n\n695\n00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.150\na second, mentioned this before,\nbut I want to remind you of it.\n\n696\n00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:25.060\nWe talked about it in some prior episodes,\n\n697\n00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.290\nactually back in the,\nit was the configuration and\n\n698\n00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:32.060\narchitecture episodes and the installation\nepisodes, where we went through and\n\n699\n00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:36.590\ntalked about manual install of the agent\nversus the push install from the client.\n\n700\n00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.750\nI did a demo on the push\ninstall from the client.\n\n701\n00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:42.540\nTalked about momagent.msi,\nwhere to find that, how to use that.\n\n702\n00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.540\nAnd we showed you\nthe different ways to do this.\n\n703\n00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.300\nWe talked about the fact that\nif we do a manual install,\n\n704\n00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.190\nthose are rejected by default.\n\n705\n00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:53.220\nThat you have to go in and you have to\nallow the management server to accept\n\n706\n00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:58.145\nmanual installs, put them into a pending\nmanagement category and then approve them.\n\n707\n00:32:58.145 --> 00:33:01.365\nAnd I said you could set it for all of\nthe management servers in the group, or\n\n708\n00:33:01.365 --> 00:33:03.055\nyou could set it by management server.\n\n709\n00:33:03.055 --> 00:33:05.305\nAnd so, this is where you would\ncome to be able to do this.\n\n710\n00:33:05.305 --> 00:33:09.185\nYou’ll see here, review new manual\ninstallations in pending mode and view.\n\n711\n00:33:09.185 --> 00:33:11.555\nAnd you can specify that,\nyou can even do automatic approve.\n\n712\n00:33:11.555 --> 00:33:16.389\nSo if you set that right there,\nhit Apply, hit OK.\n\n713\n00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:19.897\nWhat then happens is when\nyou discover something and\n\n714\n00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:23.330\nwe did a whole demo on how\ndo you go out and discover.\n\n715\n00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.010\nWe discovered installed agents.\n\n716\n00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:29.335\nBut when you do that we would then have\nsomething in here and it would show up\n\n717\n00:33:29.335 --> 00:33:32.665\nright here under pending Management\nif we have anything that's pending.\n\n718\n00:33:32.665 --> 00:33:34.825\nWe'd have to come in, right-click,\nand when we do that or\n\n719\n00:33:34.825 --> 00:33:35.835\nhighlight it, either way.\n\n720\n00:33:35.835 --> 00:33:37.845\nI know it's grayed out,\nit's kinda hard to see, but\n\n721\n00:33:37.845 --> 00:33:39.375\nyou have a proven reject right there.\n\n722\n00:33:39.375 --> 00:33:42.952\nAnd that's how we actually when then\ngo in and specify that, that gets done.\n\n723\n00:33:42.952 --> 00:33:46.112\nSo, some additional settings that\nare really important considers were\n\n724\n00:33:46.112 --> 00:33:47.192\ncustomizing and\n\n725\n00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:51.072\ntweaking that functionality in\nthe admin work space up under settings.\n\n726\n00:33:51.072 --> 00:33:54.022\nAnd this is where we go to take care\nof all those pesky little things that\n\n727\n00:33:54.022 --> 00:33:58.462\ncause us concern and consternation but are\neasily fixable if we know where to look.\n\n728\n00:33:58.462 --> 00:34:01.742\n&gt;&gt; All right, a lot of cool options for\nus available in the Ops Console.\n\n729\n00:34:01.742 --> 00:34:04.950\nAdam we thank you for holding our hand and\nwalking us down that path and\n\n730\n00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.072\ntaking a look at some of those\noptions that we do have.\n\n731\n00:34:07.072 --> 00:34:10.256\nEve chucked in some PowerShell and there\nfor us and, yeah, I do talk about the ISC,\n\n732\n00:34:10.256 --> 00:34:12.909\ncuz I call it the PowerShell for\npeople that don't know PowerShell.\n\n733\n00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:15.960\n[LAUGH] Makes my life a whole lot easier.\n\n734\n00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.330\nSo if you're in the same boat as me,\nthere you go.\n\n735\n00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.580\nUse that as well.\n\n736\n00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.000\nThanks for joining us, Adam.\n\n737\n00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.060\nWe do thank our good viewers for watching.\n\n738\n00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.179\nBut it is that time for us to sign off.\n\n739\n00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:28.418\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n740\n00:34:28.418 --> 00:34:29.154\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n741\n00:34:29.154 --> 00:34:29.974\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n742\n00:34:29.974 --> 00:34:37.702\n[MUSIC]\n\n743\n00:34:37.702 --> 00:34:40.686\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Not the other derivative.\n\n15\n00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:39.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because that would not be nice and\n\n16\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.750\nDaniel is a nice person.\n\n17\n00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.830\nSo we are gonna continue\nour conversations.\n\n18\n00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.060\nHopefully, you are excited as I am and\nin then the game,\n\n19\n00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.000\nhe's been jumping up and down about author\nit, specifically management pack author.\n\n20\n00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.220\nWe're gonna take a look at and\ntalk about how we create\n\n21\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.730\nthose crazy management pack systems\nthat we're talking about for episodes,\n\n22\n00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.700\nepisodes, and episodes now about\nthe fact how important they are.\n\n23\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.670\nEverything we do is contained within them,\nderives from them.\n\n24\n00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.330\nThey are the source of all goodness\nin the world, and we must know, and\n\n25\n00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.800\nyou specifically must know how to\ncreate them, because let's be honest,\n\n26\n00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.920\nyou get a lot of them from vendors,\nand that's a good thing.\n\n27\n00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.790\nMicrosoft puts them out, third-party\nvendors put them out, we import them.\n\n28\n00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.790\nWe're gonna talk about and\nremind you how to do that.\n\n29\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.940\nWe've shown you that but\nwe'll take a look at that real quick.\n\n30\n00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.210\nWell, there are gonna be times where you\nwanna take what's in that Madison pack and\n\n31\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.980\ndo what we call over riding it.\n\n32\n00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.650\nYou want to decide, hey,\nit's not gonna work out.\n\n33\n00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.389\nWe want to do something else and or you\nwanna go, just go off on your own and say,\n\n34\n00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:34.706\nI'm gonna be anti social.\n\n35\n00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:36.140\nI'm gonna be create my own.\n\n36\n00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.530\nAnd just, you know, forget about you.\n\n37\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.845\nI got a better idea and\nI'm gonna do it my own way, right?\n\n38\n00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:41.849\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n39\n00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:43.580\nthen you can blame yourself\nwhen everything goes wrong.\n\n40\n00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.360\n&gt;&gt; I did it my way, right?\n\n41\n00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.870\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n42\n00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.650\n&gt;&gt; That's what he was talking about,\nscum management packs.\n\n43\n00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.369\nWhen he wrote that song.\n\n44\n00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.333\n[CROSSTALK] The original title was,\nI wrote my own management pack.\n\n45\n00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.780\nBut they said, no, no, no, do it your way.\n\n46\n00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.770\nIt's a lot better.\n\n47\n00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.950\nSo we're gonna talk about\nhow to do all that.\n\n48\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.710\nBefore we do that.\n\n49\n00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.410\nWe gotta talk about some vocabulary.\n\n50\n00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.230\nYou are in a couple of rare\nepisodes here and there.\n\n51\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.040\nWe break out and we say look you\nreally gotta understand the language.\n\n52\n00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.390\nYou really gotta know\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n53\n00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.870\nYou gotta speak the language.\n\n54\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.925\nThat episode we did where\nwe talked about updates for\n\n55\n00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:13.790\na Which is migration and\nyou just kinda writing that\n\n56\n00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.470\ninformation into our brains the way that\nmakes sense and how we see it referred to.\n\n57\n00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.000\nIt's important so\nwhen you read the documentation,\n\n58\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.390\nwhen you hear us talk about it,\nwhen you go talk to others about it,\n\n59\n00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.840\nyou make sure you're speaking about\nit in the way that makes sense.\n\n60\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.980\nAnd that everybody is kinda\nin agreement about it.\n\n61\n00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.640\nThis is one of those areas where\nthese couple of terms not allowed but\n\n62\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.450\nfew things we gotta make\nsure we're clear on.\n\n63\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.380\nThe idea of object The idea of class,\nthe idea of how we kind of relate\n\n64\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.870\nthings together and how they are seen to\nbe derived and or related to one another,\n\n65\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.230\nis an important construct when\nwe talk about management packs.\n\n66\n00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.049\nSo let's define the concepts of object and\nclass.\n\n67\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.490\nThat we'll go ahead and\nwe'll take a look at how to apply them.\n\n68\n00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.310\nSo an object is what we would think of\nas the basic unit of management in scum.\n\n69\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.840\nThe idea that we can essentially\ndistill down what we're talking about\n\n70\n00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.130\nto an object such as a disk.\n\n71\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.490\nComputer, right?\n\n72\n00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.090\nSomething like that,\nthat will be an object,\n\n73\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.740\npretty basic definition,\npretty basic concepts,\n\n74\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.920\nobjects are gonna be what we will think of\nas being an instance of a specific class.\n\n75\n00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.700\nSo an object is the base element,\nthe thing that we mange,\n\n76\n00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.250\nThe thing that we interact with,\nthe thing that we talked about.\n\n77\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.440\nClass, on the other hand,\na specific type of object.\n\n78\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.350\nWhen we talk about a class,\nwe could say instead of computers,\n\n79\n00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.030\nwe could say Windows server 2012 R2\nPhysical disk specifically as the type of\n\n80\n00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.760\ndisk as supposed to just disk itself or\nWindows Server 2012 of our to data center.\n\n81\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.020\nInstead I'm just saying server or\nperhaps it would be a Linux Unix Server\n\n82\n00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.070\nas we were talking about-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n83\n00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.860\n&gt;&gt; Before we came on.\n\n84\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.068\nAnd just-\n&gt;&gt; Never know anything about it right-\n\n85\n00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:48.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Forget about it, when totally right,\n\n86\n00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.690\nso just you never know, it could happen.\n\n87\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.450\nHard to say.\n\n88\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.250\nSo the class that we just talked about\nWindows server 2012 R2 or Windows server\n\n89\n00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.670\n2012 R2 physical disc, this would\nrepresent all of the Windows server 2012.\n\n90\n00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.760\nServers are all Windows server\n2012 physical disc, and\n\n91\n00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.130\nthen we could say an object is gonna\nbe a specific instance of that class.\n\n92\n00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.600\nThe object on machine one is specifically\n\n93\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.600\none example of how we see\nthe class broadly, right?\n\n94\n00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.810\nSo objects are simply individual instances\nof things that are defined in the class.\n\n95\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.880\nIt's probably the easiest\nway to think about it.\n\n96\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.490\nEach class inside of SCOM has to\nbelong to what they call a base class.\n\n97\n00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.000\nThe base class would be the management\npack most likely that we think about.\n\n98\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.180\nSo if we think of Windows server 2012\nR2 Physical disc has been the class.\n\n99\n00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.850\nWe could say they belong to the Windows\nserver operating system management pack\n\n100\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.460\nand the base class is the management pack.\n\n101\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.450\nRight, so\nthat's how we see that relationship.\n\n102\n00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.010\nAnd we have three types of classes within\nthe management pack that we defined.\n\n103\n00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.660\nWe talked about concrete classes,\ntalk about apps tract classes and\n\n104\n00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.140\ntalk about single Classes.\n\n105\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.060\nKind of an unusual one, Singleton.\n\n106\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.560\nBut that's the name they gave it.\n\n107\n00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.440\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n&gt;&gt; Singleton is just\n\n108\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.840\na single instance of the class.\n\n109\n00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.740\nThat's what we just call it.\n\n110\n00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.380\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a British bachelor or\nsomething.\n\n111\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.005\nSingleton.\n\n112\n00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:05.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or a sports car.\n\n113\n00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n114\n00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.260\n&gt;&gt; My Singleton.\n\n115\n00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.870\nBring me my Singleton.\n\n116\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.980\nOr it could be a golf club.\n\n117\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Or, who knows what.\n\n118\n00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.440\nBut Singleton class is simply\njust a single instance.\n\n119\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.360\nOne instance of a class is\ncalled a Singleton class.\n\n120\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.600\nThat's kind of a easy one,\nonce you think about it.\n\n121\n00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.760\nThe abstract classes do\nnot identify instances.\n\n122\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.310\nThere are what we would say as\nthe opposite of a concrete class.\n\n123\n00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.790\nSo let's about concrete class,\nthen we'll talk about the abstract class.\n\n124\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.454\nThe concrete class identifies instances\nas part of a discovery process\n\n125\n00:05:33.095 --> 00:05:34.635\nAlso the ideas when we do discovery.\n\n126\n00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:36.605\nAnd we could say,\nlook we found Windows server.\n\n127\n00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:39.075\nYeah, that's a concrete\nexample of something, right?\n\n128\n00:05:39.075 --> 00:05:42.405\nWe can point in and say it's server\nfive and it's Windows server 2012 or\n\n129\n00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:43.245\nwhatever it is.\n\n130\n00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:44.915\nThat's concrete class.\n\n131\n00:05:44.915 --> 00:05:46.335\nThe abstract class extract up.\n\n132\n00:05:46.335 --> 00:05:48.555\nSo we don't identify instances up but\n\n133\n00:05:48.555 --> 00:05:52.645\nrather we use abstract classes\nas the base for other classes.\n\n134\n00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:55.675\nSo we could say that we have\na class called computers.\n\n135\n00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:56.800\nThat's abstract.\n\n136\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.390\nAnd then we could use that as a base for\nothers that will be concrete such as\n\n137\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.130\nWindows server operating systems, 2012\nR2 data center right, that kinda thing.\n\n138\n00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.770\nSo we can drill until it\nbecome more specific as we go.\n\n139\n00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.130\nSo just wanna be thinking about\nthe logic of some of this.\n\n140\n00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.800\nHow this comes together let's\nhave class relationships.\n\n141\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.760\nAnd we have to think about relationships,\nhow things are gonna\n\n142\n00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.620\ninteract with each other, can they talk to\neach other, can they do business together.\n\n143\n00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.530\nCan they have knowledge of one another?\n\n144\n00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.780\nIf not, what's the issue and\nconcern we have to address?\n\n145\n00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.930\nSo we want to think about this.\n\n146\n00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.970\nHow we associate instances from one class\nwith instances from a different class.\n\n147\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.140\nThis is what relationships are all about.\n\n148\n00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.170\nCan we, and I love the fact, you know, you\nhave young kids so you certainly see this.\n\n149\n00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.700\nSaw this when I saw your lovely.\n\n150\n00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.470\nAnd they are lovely by the way.\n\n151\n00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.815\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely stunning!\n\n152\n00:06:43.815 --> 00:06:45.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Two lovely young ladies,\n\n153\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.190\nbut when I got to meet Daniel's\ndaughter this morning,\n\n154\n00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.910\none was more talkative than the other.\n\n155\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.660\n&gt;&gt; Wow, she was really quick too, and\n\n157\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.130\nvery polite.\n\n158\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.100\nSo but when we were chatting with her,\n\n159\n00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.150\nduring one of our breaks was came to say\nhi and take their daddy out to lunch.\n\n160\n00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.760\nAnna got the chance to just\nsay hi to her real quick.\n\n161\n00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.140\nVery, very sharp young lady as I said.\n\n162\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.510\nBut the idea would be when\nkids are small like that,\n\n163\n00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.650\nwhen they're young they don't\nhave the same barriers,\n\n164\n00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.070\nconcerns and issues that we as adults\nbring to the table when we talk to people.\n\n165\n00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.970\nHis daughter was just very\ninterested in just being friendly.\n\n166\n00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.270\nLook, there's somebody there.\n\n167\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.670\nLooks interesting when we say, hi.\n\n168\n00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.800\nBut she have bail grin on her face and\nI said, I was just like, hey, how are you?\n\n169\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.005\nAnd she was just really animated.\n\n170\n00:07:34.005 --> 00:07:39.065\nHad a great conversation with me and\nI was thinking if that was somebody else,\n\n171\n00:07:39.065 --> 00:07:42.195\nif that was an adult, it definitely\nwould have not gone the same way.\n\n172\n00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:43.295\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably not.\n\n173\n00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:45.975\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's just absolutely zero likelihood\n\n174\n00:07:45.975 --> 00:07:47.515\nthat that would have happened that way.\n\n175\n00:07:47.515 --> 00:07:50.715\nAnd so it's interesting when you're a\nchild, you just don't have those filters.\n\n176\n00:07:50.715 --> 00:07:53.312\nYou don't worry about is it\nokay to say hi to somebody.\n\n177\n00:07:53.312 --> 00:07:57.077\nYou don't worry about do I have\nthe ability, am I concerned about that?\n\n178\n00:07:57.077 --> 00:07:58.386\nDo I have the right to\nhave that relationship?\n\n179\n00:07:58.386 --> 00:08:00.640\nYou just go ahead if they look\ninteresting you talk to them.\n\n180\n00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.670\nIf they don't, you just kind of ignore\nthem and you do your own stuff.\n\n181\n00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.250\nWhen we're adults it's\na little bit different, right.\n\n182\n00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.050\nWe have all those rules in place.\n\n183\n00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.790\nWe forget how to just\nbe an engaging person\n\n184\n00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.700\nbecause that gets beaten out\nof us when we go to school.\n\n185\n00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When we become an adult and\n\n186\n00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:16.363\npeople keep saying, don't do that,\ndon't do that and eventually,\n\n187\n00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:17.251\nyou stop doing that.\n\n188\n00:08:17.251 --> 00:08:21.685\nSo when we think about relationships, we\nhave to think about hosting relationships\n\n189\n00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:25.743\nand containment relationships these\nare the relationships that we see, and\n\n190\n00:08:25.743 --> 00:08:29.553\nnow we have to define the hosting\nrelationship, a class that is hosted by\n\n191\n00:08:29.553 --> 00:08:33.220\nanother class is referred to as\nsurprisingly, a hosted class.\n\n192\n00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.440\nSo the physical disk\nclass is a subset of and\n\n193\n00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.230\nit's hosted by the Windows computer class.\n\n194\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.620\nSo that would be one example of this.\n\n195\n00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.720\nIt's a subset,\n\n196\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.440\nan element that's within the broader\nclass of the Windows computer overall.\n\n197\n00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.930\nAnd the physical disk is\none element of that or\n\n198\n00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.920\none subclass called hosted class, and we\nrefer to that as a hosting relationship.\n\n199\n00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.270\nHosted classes,\n\n200\n00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:59.210\nreason we need to know this,\nwhen you remove a management pack item, or\n\n201\n00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.290\nyou remove he entire management pack,\nthe hosted class relationships go with it.\n\n202\n00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.260\nSo, if you remove the parent,\nall the hosted classes within it,\n\n203\n00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.234\nthe sub areas in other words,\nthe relationships, are removed.\n\n204\n00:09:09.234 --> 00:09:12.918\nAnd this is important because you pull\nthe wrong thing out and guess what?\n\n205\n00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:14.240\nThe whole house of cards comes down.\n\n206\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.390\n&gt;&gt; The whole enchilada [LAUGH] my friends.\n\n207\n00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.480\nLock, stock and\nbarrel as we say goes with it.\n\n208\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.290\nContainer relationships\nthese are less restrictive.\n\n209\n00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.580\nThey're not quite structured the same way.\n\n210\n00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.970\nYou can relate one class to another but\n\n211\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.320\nwe don't depend on that class\nbecause of the relationship.\n\n212\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.270\nThe idea of a hosted relationship\na hosting relationship hosts the class is\n\n213\n00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.870\nessentially a one to one relationship\nin a parent child dependency\n\n214\n00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.420\npull out the host and all the dependent\nelements go with it, right?\n\n215\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.340\nThe power sites,\nas we would often say, right?\n\n216\n00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.020\nBut, with the containment relationship,\nit's not that way.\n\n217\n00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.690\nYou could pull out the item and\nthere's not necessarily a dependency.\n\n218\n00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.065\nAnd we tend.\nAnd to leave those other things behind.\n\n219\n00:09:52.065 --> 00:09:56.015\nSo, it is important to understand\nhow we classify these relationships\n\n220\n00:09:56.015 --> 00:10:00.035\nbased on the choices we make, we may or\nmay not be setting things up in a way that\n\n221\n00:10:00.035 --> 00:10:03.605\nmakes sense to us and we have to take\nthis into account and think about this.\n\n222\n00:10:03.605 --> 00:10:08.750\nWe also have workflows and we have\nthe ability to understand how to use work\n\n223\n00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.460\nflows to really drive all the magic that\nhappens inside of the management packs.\n\n224\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.360\nThe processes that are run by the manager\nagent, the network monitoring agent,\n\n225\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.790\nwhich is what we install.\n\n226\n00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.420\nA piece of software we put on all\nthe end points we want to monitor,\n\n227\n00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.260\nas we've been talking about,\non an agent manager's computer.\n\n228\n00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.370\nWorkflows are going to be used to\nbe able to do all the things you\n\n229\n00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.400\nwant to execute there.\n\n230\n00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.890\nWe have four different types of workflows\nthat we traditionally reference.\n\n231\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.260\nWe have a data source workflow,\na probe action workflow,\n\n232\n00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.120\na condition detection workflow\nright action workflow.\n\n233\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.810\nAnd I'm gonna show you in a minute\nwhere you can find information about\n\n234\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.820\nthese out on the web cuz we often do\nwe'll show you the documentation for\n\n235\n00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.080\nthat and then there are six,\nexcuse me not workflow types,\n\n236\n00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.680\npardon me,\nthey are parts of what we call modules.\n\n237\n00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.180\nWhat I just described to you of\nthe four different module types.\n\n238\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.812\nGotta pay attention [INAUDIBLE].\n\n239\n00:10:56.812 --> 00:10:58.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Read that correctly.\n\n240\n00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.580\nI'm reading the note below when\nI'm talking about workflows, but\n\n241\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.810\nI'm actually defining modules.\n\n242\n00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna test that water cup,\nI told you that, yeah.\n\n243\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:04.800\n&gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it's dirty water.\n\n244\n00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.650\nI keep telling you that.\n\n245\n00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, the module types which are the\n\n246\n00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.530\ncontainers that contain the workflow\nelements is what I've meant to describe.\n\n247\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.150\nThose are the four types I just described,\ndata source,\n\n248\n00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.120\nprobe action, condition detection and\nwrite action.\n\n249\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.140\nAnd then we have six workflow\ntypes in conjunction with them.\n\n250\n00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.770\nAnd the six workflow types\nare the things we’ll look at and\n\n251\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.440\nuse to build elements of management\npacks here, in a minute.\n\n252\n00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.110\nDiscoveries, we’ve already seen those,\nused those, Windows,\n\n253\n00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.840\nLinux, network discoveries,\nwe’ve demonstrated those for you.\n\n254\n00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.430\nRules, take a look at those.\n\n255\n00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.450\nTasks, we've played with those already.\n\n256\n00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.130\nMonitors, diagnostics.\n\n257\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.530\nDid a little PowerShell demo.\n\n258\n00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.580\nWe've showed you how to pull\nthe all the diagnostics out.\n\n259\n00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.500\nGet diagnostics we took a look at that.\n\n260\n00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.450\nOne of our episodes, and recovery.\n\n261\n00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.090\nSo these are the work flow types that are\nused and we're gonna be able to combine\n\n262\n00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:50.850\nthose together to be able to go in and\ncreate management pack elements and\n\n263\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.880\ncreate the operational environment\nwe need for the management pack.\n\n264\n00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.990\nManagement packs are gonna be written\nin or created in the ops console.\n\n265\n00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.260\nNot exclusively because\nwe can do it elsewhere.\n\n266\n00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.678\nWe may use Visual Studio to do authoring.\n\n267\n00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:05.470\nA little bit beyond the boundary of\nwhat we're gonna be talking about here.\n\n268\n00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.600\nBut, I'm gonna quickly give you some\nideas and guidance around how to do it,\n\n269\n00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.000\nin the sense that there's\na set of extensions.\n\n270\n00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.040\nThat you can download, called the VACE.\n\n271\n00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.946\nThe Visual Studio offering extensions for\nscam.\n\n272\n00:12:16.946 --> 00:12:18.520\nAnd you can install them.\n\n273\n00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.063\nWe support that [INAUDIBLE] our most\nrecent versions of Visual Studio.\n\n274\n00:12:21.063 --> 00:12:24.170\nI think Visual Studio 17 recently\nwas released, it's out now.\n\n275\n00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:27.210\nSo, on 12th, on 13th, on 15th and\non 17th, you can use it there, and\n\n276\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.470\nyou are able to then use those and\nbe able to do authoring and\n\n277\n00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.180\nactually build that about of\npacks right in Visual Studio.\n\n278\n00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.530\nThose of you that may have\nan app dev background,\n\n279\n00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:37.560\nwanna do a little tinkering there.\n\n280\n00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.430\nYou can do that.\n\n281\n00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.480\nWe can use the console,\n\n282\n00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.340\nwe'll show you how to do that\nin a demo here in just a moment.\n\n283\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.610\nAnd once we're done with all that, we're\ngonna talk about the difference between\n\n284\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.860\nsealed and unsealed management packs.\n\n285\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.810\nAn unsealed management pack is\na management pack you create on your\n\n286\n00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.590\nown that's not locked down.\n\n287\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.777\nWhen a vendor creates a management pack,\nthink Microsoft,\n\n288\n00:12:55.777 --> 00:12:58.474\nthink whoever the vendor\nis that you get them from.\n\n289\n00:12:58.474 --> 00:12:59.870\nAnd you import them.\n\n290\n00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:00.830\nThey come in seal.\n\n291\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.460\nThey are locked down essentially.\n\n292\n00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.240\nYou can't modify them directly.\n\n293\n00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.790\nWhat you do is you make changes\nto them by creating overrides and\n\n294\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:11.280\nstoring them in a separate management\npack instead of the read only locked down\n\n295\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.550\nversion that's sealed.\n\n296\n00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.760\nYou create a new version that is unsealed\nthat works on the sealed version as\n\n297\n00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.490\nan overlay to let you make the changes\nwithout modifying the original.\n\n298\n00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.410\nMakes a lot of sense\nwhen you think about it.\n\n299\n00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.490\nAs we do that,\n\n300\n00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.370\nwe'll be able to decide what kind of\nmanagement packs we're working with.\n\n301\n00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.520\nI'm gonna demonstrate how to\ncreate an unsealed one for you.\n\n302\n00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.470\nIt's real simple.\n\n303\n00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:33.670\nWe'll right click on the management pack\narea in the administration work space,\n\n304\n00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.820\nnew management pack.\n\n305\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:35.790\nGive it a name.\n\n306\n00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.350\nClick okay.\n\n307\n00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.710\nWe're done, but it's an empty\nshell basically, just a container.\n\n308\n00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:43.530\nThen, we're going go ahead and we're\ngonna go in to the authoring space and\n\n309\n00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.090\nthat's where the magic happens and\nwe're gonna right click and\n\n310\n00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.790\nstart creating new elements to put into\nour management pack that we've created.\n\n311\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.510\nAnd we'll start to use some of those work\nflow elements that we were talking about\n\n312\n00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.170\nand drop in a monitors and\ndifferent things.\n\n313\n00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.670\nYou'll see me do that and\nonce we've done that, we get it all set.\n\n314\n00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.419\nWe can export it if I want to hand\nthe management pack off to Daniel and say,\n\n315\n00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:04.274\nhey, I've done this.\n\n316\n00:14:04.274 --> 00:14:06.839\nGo ahead and take this and\ninstall to your system and use it.\n\n317\n00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:09.189\nImagine for\na minute in the real world that we have,\n\n318\n00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:12.480\nas opposed to the fake world,\nwhere you can imagine anything happens.\n\n319\n00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.420\nThat doesn't really matter,\nbut in the real world,\n\n320\n00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.460\nwhere things actually work\nthe way they're supposed to.\n\n321\n00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.790\nWe can imagine that we're gonna\nhave a centralized t function.\n\n322\n00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.080\nBig company, global company a lot of\ncustomers fall into this category.\n\n323\n00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.440\nAnd they're got a central IT function.\n\n324\n00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.220\nThey're gonna create management packs for\n\n325\n00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:32.860\nuse in remote areas of the various eco\nsystems they're managing around the world.\n\n326\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.110\nThey're gonna export\nthese management packs.\n\n327\n00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:40.180\nGive them, by region let's say,\nto a Tom and Asia pack, and wherever.\n\n328\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.060\nAnd then, they're gonna say hey import\nthese in your management server group and\n\n329\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.690\nuse them.\n\n330\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:49.030\nAnd that way you've got all\nthe pre-made settings, reports, rules,\n\n331\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.880\ndependencies, everything we need.\n\n332\n00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.670\nAll the monitors are all there and\nyou're gonna set it all up.\n\n333\n00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.950\nYou don't have to worry\nabout creating at all,\n\n334\n00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.890\nbecause it is all essentially\nalready loaded for you.\n\n335\n00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.510\nSo, we're gonna export\nthose management packs.\n\n336\n00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.660\nNow we can export the management pack\neither use in PowerShell or the console,\n\n337\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:10.045\nit's up to us to decide however\nif management packs are unsealed,\n\n338\n00:15:10.045 --> 00:15:11.035\nwe create them ourselves,\n\n339\n00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:15.395\nwe're essentially creating a new version\nof a lock down seal management pack.\n\n340\n00:15:15.395 --> 00:15:17.055\nWe could do that either\nthrough the console or\n\n341\n00:15:17.055 --> 00:15:19.435\nPowerShell, while the option\nto do either one.\n\n342\n00:15:19.435 --> 00:15:22.645\nSealed management packs can only\nbe exported through PowerShell.\n\n343\n00:15:22.645 --> 00:15:26.215\nAnd I'm gonna show you the steps on how to\nexport them and show you the PowerShell\n\n344\n00:15:26.215 --> 00:15:29.520\ncmdlets to do so, so we'll get a chance\nto see how that's done in fact,\n\n345\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.640\nshe already got one that I've set up and\nexplored.\n\n346\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.750\nI'm just gonna run you\nthrough how that works.\n\n347\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.720\nSo, we'll take a look at that.\n\n348\n00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.350\nNot too difficult to do.\n\n349\n00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.320\nAnd then, we're gonna go ahead and talk a\nbit about how to actually seal the Madison\n\n350\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.450\npack if you create one and then you wanna\nlock it down, you gotta use a tool.\n\n351\n00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.260\nIt's actually a two-step process.\n\n352\n00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.638\nThe first part is gonna be to create\na key that's gonna allow you to\n\n353\n00:15:49.638 --> 00:15:53.765\nauthenticate the Madison Pack sign and\nmake sure we know it came from somebody.\n\n354\n00:15:53.765 --> 00:15:58.173\nShe gonna need to do this bu using\na strong naming utility called the SN\n\n355\n00:15:58.173 --> 00:15:58.864\nutility.\n\n356\n00:15:58.864 --> 00:16:01.928\nYou get that from Visual Studio,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n357\n00:16:01.928 --> 00:16:04.030\nSo you download that,\nyou get that, you run that.\n\n358\n00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.280\nIt's a very simple command.\n\n359\n00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.340\nStructure run.\n\n360\n00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.000\nYou create a extension,\na.snk extension, so\n\n361\n00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.590\nyou get your strong name signing solution.\n\n362\n00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.380\nYou get your key file, in other words.\n\n363\n00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.520\nOnce you have that,\nyou then use MPSeal.exe.\n\n364\n00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.770\nIt’s a program that’s part of\nthe operating environment of SCOM.\n\n365\n00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.400\nYou’ll see it, it’s gonna be installed.\n\n366\n00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.640\nI'll show you where to go find it.\n\n367\n00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.950\nWe'll be able to go and\ntake a look at that real quick.\n\n368\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:33.590\nAnd then we can use MP Verify, a three\nstep process to be able to verify that we\n\n369\n00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.520\nhave all the dependencies and everything\nis good, and that there are no issues.\n\n370\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.380\nSo we're going to take a look at this\nprocess and kind of how this works.\n\n371\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.820\nAnd I'm not gonna actually go in and sign\none and seal it and do everything, but\n\n372\n00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.280\nI'll show you the tools and\ntalk about how they work.\n\n373\n00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.010\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n374\n00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.420\nOr, you have an option.\n\n375\n00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can vote right now, by the way.\n\n376\n00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.200\nWe're gonna animate the screen for\nyou in a minute.\n\n377\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.170\nThere's gonna be hand that's gonna come\nout and give you a piece of paper, and\n\n378\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.960\nyou're gonna be able to\nwrite your option on there.\n\n379\n00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.925\nWe're gonna get it back.\n\n380\n00:16:56.925 --> 00:16:59.820\nDaniel's gonna tabulate the votes and\ntell us what the option says.\n\n381\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.800\nSo, are you ready for this?\n\n382\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.760\n&gt;&gt; I've got my counting hats ready.\n\n383\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you're all set to go.\n\n384\n00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:09.710\nYou're not going to be like what\nhappened at the, at the Oscars, right?\n\n385\n00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:10.936\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n&gt;&gt; They fired those people.\n\n386\n00:17:10.936 --> 00:17:13.196\n[CROSSTALK] They're like, yeah,\nyou're never doing the Oscars again.\n\n387\n00:17:13.196 --> 00:17:13.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n388\n00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.450\nlike the one girl did nothing wrong.\n\n389\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It was the guy who like screwed up.\n\n390\n00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.510\nAnd they just said, well basically,\nyou're both out of here.\n\n391\n00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.830\n&gt;&gt; You're guilty by association.\n\n392\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.470\nThat was like horrible.\n\n393\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n394\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:22.820\n&gt;&gt; That was bad,\n\n395\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.260\nwe're not going to let that happen to you.\n\n396\n00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.790\nBut we are going to go ahead and\ndo the following.\n\n397\n00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.100\nI can also teach you how to do,\nnot this cool stuff but\n\n398\n00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.150\nsomething totally unrelated.\n\n399\n00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.220\nIt'll be a surprise,\nwe're not going to tell you what it is.\n\n400\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.104\n&gt;&gt; If you act now [LAUGH].\n\n401\n00:17:34.104 --> 00:17:35.569\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell Daniel, but\nI'm not going to tell you.\n\n402\n00:17:35.569 --> 00:17:37.765\nBut he's going to think that it's\nreally cool and want to vote for it, so\n\n403\n00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:39.160\nwe're not gonna let him decide.\n\n404\n00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.306\nSo why don't we do\nthe management pack thing.\n\n405\n00:17:41.306 --> 00:17:43.829\n[CROSSTALK] You're probably gonna\ntake us off into the ether and\n\n406\n00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:45.074\ndo something totally random.\n\n407\n00:17:45.074 --> 00:17:46.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n408\n00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:47.580\nso let me just quickly\nbefore we go in here.\n\n409\n00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.220\nLet me just reset the counter on this.\n\n410\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.600\nMake sure we have enough\ntime to get this done,\n\n411\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.685\ncuz that silly thing just keeps\nwanting to go down to zero.\n\n412\n00:17:53.685 --> 00:17:54.925\nOkay, it's up and running so we can go.\n\n413\n00:17:54.925 --> 00:17:58.135\nSo let's first take a look at couple\nof things we were talking about.\n\n414\n00:17:58.135 --> 00:18:00.705\nLet me just bring up the Edge browser for\nus.\n\n415\n00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.980\nWhere do you go to find the custom\nmodule types and work flows?\n\n416\n00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.130\nWe've got a URL that will help\nyou to do this right here.\n\n417\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.160\nIgnore the fact that it says, hey,\ndocumentation is archived and\n\n418\n00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.170\nis not being maintained.\n\n419\n00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:13.970\nThat's okay.\n\n420\n00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.520\nThe basic concepts are still here and\nimportant.\n\n421\n00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.942\nSo you can read up on this little bit.\n\n422\n00:18:18.942 --> 00:18:21.034\nTalks about all the different\naction module types.\n\n423\n00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:21.745\nI mentioned them.\n\n424\n00:18:21.745 --> 00:18:23.030\nThe probe action module.\n\n425\n00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.380\nYou can see it here.\n\n426\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.490\nAnd the condition detection module,\nthe right action module.\n\n427\n00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.380\nSo just gives you some basic information\nabout how these things work.\n\n428\n00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.170\nSo, just make sure you\ntake a look at that.\n\n429\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:36.188\nI mentioned the strong name tool and\nhow you would find it.\n\n430\n00:18:36.188 --> 00:18:37.383\nSn.exe.\n\n431\n00:18:37.383 --> 00:18:38.977\nJust went out, did a quick search.\n\n432\n00:18:38.977 --> 00:18:41.770\nMSDN has the basic documentation on it.\n\n433\n00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:42.840\nYou take a look at it.\n\n434\n00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.630\nYou get this from Visual Studio.\n\n435\n00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.520\nSo once you have Visual Studio installed,\n\n436\n00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.100\nyou can actually use that to be\nable to find tool and use it.\n\n437\n00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.720\nYou could download\nseparately if you need to.\n\n438\n00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.200\nJust follow the link on the page and\nyou can actually do the download.\n\n439\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.290\nAnd I mention Visual Studio on\nthe fact that we could do our\n\n440\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.630\nactual creation of management packs\nin Visual Studio if you wanted to.\n\n441\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.460\nYou can download the VSAE.\n\n442\n00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.220\nThe System Center Visual\nStudio Authoring Extensions.\n\n443\n00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.605\nIt's in the download link right here.\n\n444\n00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:09.560\nSo, you can go and grab these.\n\n445\n00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.470\nYou add them in to Visual Studio.\n\n446\n00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.230\nYou can see, pretty straightforward.\n\n447\n00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.450\nWorks pretty much on anything.\n\n448\n00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.370\nWindows 10, all the way through,\nback to Vista, of all things.\n\n449\n00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.435\nI love when I still see XP\non there from time to time.\n\n450\n00:19:20.435 --> 00:19:21.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're like, yeah,\n\n451\n00:19:21.492 --> 00:19:22.604\nwe don't support that anymore,\nyou shouldn't run it.\n\n452\n00:19:22.604 --> 00:19:25.297\nBut you could run our software there,\nif you wanted to.\n\n453\n00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:27.610\nSo you can download this,\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n454\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.290\nInstalling it, really not a big deal.\n\n455\n00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.430\nYou'll see there, you get your MSI.\n\n456\n00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.330\nYou simply go ahead and do that.\n\n457\n00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:37.180\nWhen you do, you open up VIsual Studio,\nand you'll get, under the file, new area,\n\n458\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.740\nyou now have a new project\nthat's called management pack.\n\n459\n00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.060\nSo we have a whole set of templates\nthat we install that let you then go in,\n\n460\n00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.460\nhave the authoring environment\nset up the management pack, and\n\n461\n00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.490\nbuild it right from there.\n\n462\n00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.220\nYou save it, you test it, you export it.\n\n463\n00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.530\nAnd then you bring it in,\nyou import it into the SCOM console.\n\n464\n00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.100\nAnd then we're able to use it.\n\n465\n00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.860\nSo I do this in both areas, I do work\nin Visual Studio right packs there.\n\n466\n00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.740\nLittle bit more complicated to\ndo it there, lot more tools and\n\n467\n00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.320\nobviously things we can get into there.\n\n468\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.520\nBut it's a little bit more of\nkind of a step up environment\n\n469\n00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.150\nfrom the console itself.\n\n470\n00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.430\nSo we could do this if we want to.\n\n471\n00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.060\nIt will be up to you to decide.\n\n472\n00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.040\nBut encourage you to take a look.\n\n473\n00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.950\nWe also can just do the old fashion.\n\n474\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.980\nGo to the SCOM console and do this.\n\n475\n00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.170\nSo you'll see I'm in the admin workspace.\n\n476\n00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:21.502\nI'm in the management pack area here.\n\n477\n00:20:21.502 --> 00:20:23.275\n&gt;&gt; Just gonna right-click.\n\n478\n00:20:23.275 --> 00:20:26.975\nWe're gonna go ahead and just remind\nourselves quickly that we can import those\n\n479\n00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:29.695\nmanagement packs, especially if\nwe create them in Visual Studio.\n\n480\n00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:31.925\nWe can import them right from here.\n\n481\n00:20:31.925 --> 00:20:37.325\nWe can do that off the disk or\ndownload from the website, the catalogue.\n\n482\n00:20:37.325 --> 00:20:38.575\nSo we can do either one.\n\n483\n00:20:38.575 --> 00:20:39.690\nWe're gonna create a new one.\n\n484\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.665\nSo, create management pack.\n\n485\n00:20:41.665 --> 00:20:43.483\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna give this a name.\n\n486\n00:20:46.192 --> 00:20:48.490\nCall this Adam ITProTV, right?\n\n487\n00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.180\nSo we'll call that that so\nwe can just subtract that.\n\n488\n00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.640\nNotice the ID becomes\nthe same as the name.\n\n489\n00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.430\nHas a version, so\nwe can do versioning, right?\n\n490\n00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.780\nAnd notice there's really nothing\nelse we've gotta configure here.\n\n491\n00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.320\nWe'll just take a look at knowledge,\nbut it's just a blank page.\n\n492\n00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.375\nAnd then the magic happens after we create\nthis shell because all the container,\n\n493\n00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:10.549\nall the management pack is,\nas I said, is really just a shell.\n\n494\n00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:13.241\nWe're then gonna go into\nthe authoring workspace and start.\n\n495\n00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:14.957\nWe'll pick that management pack up, and\n\n496\n00:21:14.957 --> 00:21:17.120\nnow we're gonna start\nadding components in there.\n\n497\n00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.488\nThat really how we do\nthe customization and\n\n498\n00:21:19.488 --> 00:21:21.882\nmake the magic happen as they say, right?\n\n499\n00:21:21.882 --> 00:21:23.830\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Next here.\n\n500\n00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.960\nPretty straightforward.\n\n501\n00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.660\nKnowledge is really just\ndescription in documentation.\n\n502\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.750\nSo, if you wanna edit it,\nyou can see there's a button there.\n\n503\n00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.230\nYou could feel free to do that.\n\n504\n00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.590\nSo if we decide we wanna\nput something in there,\n\n505\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.350\nyou'll see that we have to have\nthe Visual Studios tools for\n\n506\n00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:40.440\nOffice installed in my\nVirtual Machine environment here.\n\n507\n00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.140\nWe don't have them installed,\nbut in the real world,\n\n508\n00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.210\nit would be easy enough to\ndownload those and put them in.\n\n509\n00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.890\nAnd then you could just simply edit that\njust by adding in some documentation.\n\n510\n00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.050\nNothing real fancy.\n\n511\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.091\nSo you could do that if you like.\n\n512\n00:21:50.091 --> 00:21:52.290\nWe're just gonna simply click Create here.\n\n513\n00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.830\nGive that just a second.\n\n514\n00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.280\nAll it's doing is literally\njust creating a shell.\n\n515\n00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.080\nIt's gonna put it in here alphabetically.\n\n516\n00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.230\nWe know my rule about refreshing, right?\n\n517\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.430\nSo, we'll give it a moment.\n\n518\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.660\nIf we don't see it, we'll simply\nright-click here, do a little refresh, and\n\n519\n00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.690\nwe'll see that pop in.\n\n520\n00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.030\nIt'll come in right up here alphabetized\nas soon as that does refresh.\n\n521\n00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.390\nWhile we're waiting,\nlet's go over to the authoring area.\n\n522\n00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:16.520\nYou see it's right there.\n\n523\n00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.190\nJust go back to it.\n\n524\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.380\nIt just popped in.\n\n525\n00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.575\nThe minute I say I'm moving,\nit's like, wait I gotta show up.\n\n526\n00:22:20.575 --> 00:22:22.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I may just hurry up.\n\n527\n00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.650\nSo you can see Adam IT ProTV.\n\n528\n00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:24.780\nIf we go full screen for a minute.\n\n529\n00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.540\nJust wanna show you\nthe difference in the detail here.\n\n530\n00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.540\nIf you hopefully can see it.\n\n531\n00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.430\nYou'll see the management packs on either\nside of it are all gold little, it's very\n\n532\n00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.390\nhard to see this little gold padlock\non the right-hand lower side there.\n\n533\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.250\nThat shows you it's\na sealed management pack.\n\n534\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.360\nYou can also look in\nthe column right here, and\n\n535\n00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.270\nsee in the column view that it's sealed.\n\n536\n00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.810\nAnd then the one that I create, and\nthere's a couple that are not sealed.\n\n537\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.110\nThe default management pack is not sealed,\nthat comes by default.\n\n538\n00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.530\nThe client monitoring override management\npack, again, comes by default, not sealed.\n\n539\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:58.320\nBut the one I created also, a grey little\nicon off to the lower right, not sealed.\n\n540\n00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.050\nAnd under the view here,\njust sort for sealed, not sealed.\n\n541\n00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.940\nYou'll be able to see it with no trouble.\n\n542\n00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.280\nWe'll go to the authoring area.\n\n543\n00:23:05.775 --> 00:23:11.190\nWe'll come in here, and under our\nmanagement pack objects, we see that we\n\n544\n00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:16.300\nhave all of our items that we could start\nto begin to use to create and drop in.\n\n545\n00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.280\nSo if we wanna create a management\npack that has certain monitors in it,\n\n546\n00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.300\nwe can do that.\n\n547\n00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.840\nCertain object discovery types or\nover rides or\n\n548\n00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.930\nrules or service level tracking or\ntask reviews or whatever the case may be.\n\n549\n00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:28.990\nWe can do that.\n\n550\n00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.760\nSo let's go ahead, let's do the following.\n\n551\n00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.314\nLet's go in, let's create a task.\n\n552\n00:23:33.314 --> 00:23:36.174\nWe'll right-click, see all\nthe different tasks that are there.\n\n553\n00:23:36.174 --> 00:23:41.965\nGot 4,955 of them,\ncuz 4,954 just wasn't enough.\n\n554\n00:23:41.965 --> 00:23:43.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna give you 4,955.\n\n555\n00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.468\nSo we've got quite a number to\nchoose from here, as you can see.\n\n556\n00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:50.660\nWere gonna right-click, create a new task.\n\n557\n00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.450\nAnd what we're gonna do,\nyou'll see this here in just a second,\n\n558\n00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.663\nwe're gonna create a task, and\nwe're gonna give it an association here.\n\n559\n00:23:56.663 --> 00:23:58.528\nSo what kind of task you want?\n\n560\n00:23:58.528 --> 00:24:00.978\nIs it an Agent Task or Console Task?\n\n561\n00:24:00.978 --> 00:24:03.807\nBut then you'll notice down\nhere That we go in and\n\n562\n00:24:03.807 --> 00:24:07.188\nwe choose what matters from\npack one to put that task into.\n\n563\n00:24:07.188 --> 00:24:10.419\nI'm gonna choose that nifty one\nthere that says in all capitals,\n\n564\n00:24:10.419 --> 00:24:13.500\nCHOOSE ME CUZ I'M COOL AND\nYOU NEED TO USE ME FOR THE DEMO.\n\n565\n00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.220\nWhat it actually says is AdamITPROTV.\n\n566\n00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.610\nBut I didn't name it that cuz that\nwould of been a ridiculous name.\n\n567\n00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:18.890\n&gt;&gt; Six of one, half a dozen of the other.\n\n568\n00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's all the same right,\nit means the same thing.\n\n569\n00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.280\nBut you can see that I\nchoose my management pack.\n\n570\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.780\nSo now that I've created the generic shell\nI'm gonna start dumping stuff in there,\n\n571\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.040\nand this is how we actually\npopulate the management pack,\n\n572\n00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:32.930\nstart putting stuff in it.\n\n573\n00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.840\nAnd I'm gonna show you what that\nactually means when we export it here\n\n574\n00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.730\nin a couple minutes.\n\n575\n00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.710\nSo let's go in, let's go ahead and\nlet's do the following.\n\n576\n00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:46.890\nLet us go in and let's say we're\ngonna go ahead and do a command line.\n\n577\n00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.590\nAnd you'll see we choose\nthe option over here.\n\n578\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:56.530\nClick next under age task we have\na n ame scroll this task one.\n\n579\n00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:00.240\nDescription optional task target\nwe are going to select what\n\n580\n00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.400\nwe gonna select for this.\n\n581\n00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.740\nSo we gonna select target.\n\n582\n00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.240\nAnd then we'll click next.\n\n583\n00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.910\nWhat command line are we going to do?\n\n584\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.010\nSo we have to put in the path for\nthe command.\n\n585\n00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.320\nMaybe we want to run, I dont' know,\nnotepad or something like that.\n\n586\n00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:14.850\nOr ping.\n\n587\n00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.530\nYou ever wonder how we get that ping\ntask that's always in there that\n\n588\n00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.300\nwe're talking about?\n\n589\n00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:23.124\nSomebody went in, wrote this thing up,\nsaid C going backslash Windows system 32,\n\n590\n00:25:23.124 --> 00:25:25.130\nping.exe and created a task.\n\n591\n00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.500\nAnd assigned it to a management pack and\nthat's how we get it.\n\n592\n00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.080\nSo, we gonna do the same thing here.\n\n593\n00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:35.090\nSo, we'll do c column backslash,\nWindows, system, oops.\n\n594\n00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:41.550\nSystem 32 and\nwe'll do a notepad dot exc, right.\n\n595\n00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:42.560\nSo we have that.\n\n596\n00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.923\nIf you know any parameters, you we may\nwanna add in there and we can just left,\n\n597\n00:25:46.923 --> 00:25:49.120\nexcuse me, right click rather.\n\n598\n00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:56.440\nAnd we could say something like,\nlet's see here.\n\n599\n00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.180\nSo, we'll do an agent.\n\n600\n00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.360\nSo action account identity or\nsomething like that.\n\n601\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.840\nAnd then we can set that equal to or\nnot equal to or\n\n602\n00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.520\nwe can specify something if we want to.\n\n603\n00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.580\nIt's up to us.\n\n604\n00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.840\nWe've got a working directory,\nif we choose to put that in there.\n\n605\n00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.550\nAnd then just create that.\n\n606\n00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.660\nAnd we have a time out value for\nhow long it takes to actually execute.\n\n607\n00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.170\nIf it doesn't execute it errors out.\n\n608\n00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.110\nSo now we have our task, right?\n\n609\n00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.450\nAnd we haven't seen that number go up yet.\n\n610\n00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.620\nIt will, you see it went up by two,\nso now it's 57.\n\n611\n00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.440\nBut you know,\n\n612\n00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.280\nyou can see obviously, the task is like\nburied in the middle of that somewhere.\n\n613\n00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.890\nSo if I choose or search for\nAdam and I look for\n\n614\n00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.620\nthe task, we'll be able to just see that\nit was created, it'll take just a moment.\n\n615\n00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.190\nYou can see it right there, right?\n\n616\n00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.300\nTask one has that in there because it's\nassociated withe the management packs.\n\n617\n00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.490\nI can usually search for it.\n\n618\n00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.430\nSo I could see that that\ntask has been created and\n\n619\n00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.240\nI could now use that task\nin that management path.\n\n620\n00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.240\nNow, I can keep going adding\nall sort of stuff in there.\n\n621\n00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.520\nI could do a view.\n\n622\n00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.320\nI could do rules.\n\n623\n00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:55.930\nWe'll do one more.\n\n624\n00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:57.380\nLet's do a view real quick.\n\n625\n00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.970\nSo we could add a view in.\n\n626\n00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.126\nSo let's just right click wait for\nthis to come up in just one second.\n\n627\n00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.780\n&gt;&gt; One second being\na relative elastic term.\n\n628\n00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:11.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Microsoft second,\nthat’s what we call it.\n\n629\n00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:15.120\n&gt;&gt; Well, if we’re-\n&gt;&gt; It’s a six minutes and a reboot.\n\n630\n00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n631\n00:27:15.645 --> 00:27:16.375\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n632\n00:27:16.375 --> 00:27:18.590\nlet’s just click away from that,\nwe don’t wanna refresh that.\n\n633\n00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:22.300\nThe views takes a while to load\nbecause there are a lot of them,\n\n634\n00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.700\nalmost 13,000 of them, right?\n\n635\n00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.740\nSo you could see we have a lot and again,\nyou'll see we have the views there.\n\n636\n00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.340\nWe're not gonna create a new one,\nbut you can see I can go in.\n\n637\n00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.810\nI could interact with\nall the different views.\n\n638\n00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.400\nLet's actually, cuz that's a lot\nof work to do that, let's go and\n\n639\n00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.840\ndo a monitor real quick.\n\n640\n00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.370\nSo we'll just do a monitor.\n\n641\n00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.530\nNot too many of those,\npretty easy to work with.\n\n642\n00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:46.930\nLet's go ahead, create a monitor,\nand we'll create a unit monitor.\n\n643\n00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:51.800\nAnd so we'll do this, we'll add this into\nour management pack, put that there.\n\n644\n00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.640\nAnd let's go in and\n\n645\n00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:59.253\nlet's do a log file monitor to\na text file or a Text Log rather.\n\n646\n00:27:59.253 --> 00:28:03.177\nA simple event detection and\ndo Eeent reset and\n\n647\n00:28:03.177 --> 00:28:08.607\nwe just got soe stuff we gotta\nspecify there [COUGH] Give it a name,\n\n648\n00:28:08.607 --> 00:28:13.334\ncall this task, or rather,\nexcuse, Monitored Task,\n\n649\n00:28:13.334 --> 00:28:18.565\ncall this Monitor2 and\nwe gotta specify our monitor target,\n\n650\n00:28:18.565 --> 00:28:23.111\nwe'll do a select there,\nagain we'll do the agent.\n\n651\n00:28:25.453 --> 00:28:31.610\nAnd, parent monitor is availability or\nconfiguration or performance or security.\n\n652\n00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.500\nSpecify what we want,\nwe'll do availability, so that'll be fine.\n\n653\n00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:39.040\nMonitor is enabled by default so\nit's going to come up already turned on.\n\n654\n00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:43.690\nAll the directory where the default\napplication logged out or\n\n655\n00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.470\nwe have to define the application log\nsource directory where we are, what we're\n\n656\n00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:51.230\ngonna be working with so we would have\nto specify where this is gonna be.\n\n657\n00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.930\nSay that we could do something\nlike C colon backslash, logs or\n\n658\n00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:55.940\nwhat ever it maybe.\n\n659\n00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:05.210\nWe can go ahead and we can do for pattern\nasterisk.txt whatever that maybe and\n\n660\n00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.890\nthen ops let's get back\naway from hidden task\n\n661\n00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:13.700\nbar there give that just there we go give\nthat just a second get out of the way.\n\n662\n00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.240\nThen we can go ahead and\ninsert a filter for\n\n663\n00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.580\nour parameters here we can do\nan expression so parameter name.\n\n664\n00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.460\nOperator and value.\n\n665\n00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.010\nSo parameter name could be Fred.\n\n666\n00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:30.540\nOperator could be equal to or\nnot equal to.\n\n667\n00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:35.820\nSo Fred does not equal George.\n\n668\n00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.900\nBecause Fred and George.\n\n669\n00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They're different guys.\n\n670\n00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.430\nYou wanna make sure you\nkeep them straight.\n\n671\n00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:40.900\nThey get upset about that, right?\n\n672\n00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.930\nBut in the real world here,\nyou'd be putting in events and\n\n673\n00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.810\nspecifying expressions that link them\nthat you actually wanna trace in the log.\n\n674\n00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.800\nI'm just putting in random data right now.\n\n675\n00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.010\nJust to go through this.\n\n676\n00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:55.260\nWe're gonna go in and\nput in our application log data source.\n\n677\n00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:00.675\nSo we'll do this as logs/pals and\n\n678\n00:30:00.675 --> 00:30:09.420\nour pattern as asterisk.txt again,\nspecify that.\n\n679\n00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.220\nWe'll insert our parameters again.\n\n680\n00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.600\nDo an and group.\n\n681\n00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.048\nSo we'll do Freddy.\n\n682\n00:30:21.767 --> 00:30:24.239\nAnd we'll do equals.\n\n683\n00:30:26.665 --> 00:30:31.820\nNot Freddy, all right and so\nwe'll put that in there just for purposes.\n\n684\n00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.465\nCome on, I hate that little stupid\ntask bar thing, there we go.\n\n685\n00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:36.739\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so we got that,\n\n686\n00:30:36.739 --> 00:30:41.806\nmap monitor conditions to health status so\nwe have to map this in and\n\n687\n00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:46.889\nspecify here, right, that we will,\nlet's see if I can get that to\n\n688\n00:30:49.218 --> 00:30:54.450\nWhat's going on with that one second.\n\n689\n00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:55.120\nWhy am I getting an error?\n\n690\n00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.240\nSecond event raised, second event raised.\n\n691\n00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.980\nOperational state, monitor state, okay.\n\n692\n00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:11.000\nAll right, so let me go back here one\nsecond and You fix this, half a second.\n\n693\n00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.153\nThere we go, previous, previous and,\n\n694\n00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:21.855\nThere let's do for that,\n\n695\n00:31:21.855 --> 00:31:26.300\ndo, that should be fine.\n\n696\n00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.410\nIt's this one here, all I have to.\n\n697\n00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.080\nCome on.\n\n698\n00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:33.780\nThere, that one there.\n\n699\n00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.570\nInstead of that, let's do dot, key of c,\nthat should I think fix our problem.\n\n700\n00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:43.090\nLet me just click away from that.\n\n701\n00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:47.000\nGet our hidden taskbar to cooperate.\n\n702\n00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.606\nThere we go.\n\n703\n00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:54.948\nAll right, and no, I can fix wire,\nwill not be able to [INAUDIBLE] that.\n\n704\n00:31:57.276 --> 00:31:59.506\nAll right,\nlet me do something here really quickly.\n\n705\n00:31:59.506 --> 00:32:01.219\nOut of this monitor.\n\n706\n00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:01.894\nWe're gonna fix it.\n\n707\n00:32:01.894 --> 00:32:03.239\nJust give me one second.\n\n708\n00:32:03.239 --> 00:32:06.750\nIt's just the way that I\nthink I chose to set it up.\n\n709\n00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:09.420\nSo let me do this one more time.\n\n710\n00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.770\nAnd let's just do an aggregate roll\nup instead of doing the dependency.\n\n711\n00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.200\nDependency, you've gotta actually have\nthe data in there and validate it.\n\n712\n00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.130\nIt's just not gonna play nice when we're\njust faking the data to just show you\n\n713\n00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.950\nhow to do it.\n\n714\n00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.220\nSo let me just do this one.\n\n715\n00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.040\nWe'll do this and\nwe'll call it dependency1 and\n\n716\n00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.920\nthen let's select our monitor\ntarget here real quick.\n\n717\n00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.440\nAnd we'll do that and then our\navailability will put that into our\n\n718\n00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.760\nmanagement pack do that one there,\njust click next.\n\n719\n00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.460\nWe’ll do our health state Determined by.\n\n720\n00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.780\nYou have two options here.\n\n721\n00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.050\nThis one's kind of interesting.\n\n722\n00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.520\nYou can do worst state of any\nmember meaning the absolute bottom\n\n723\n00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.880\nrung of the ladder will be\nthe common denominator.\n\n724\n00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.730\nWe can do best state so\nwe can look at your healthiest or\n\n725\n00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.070\nessentially unhealthiest, right.\n\n726\n00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.170\nWe can use that as our baseline.\n\n727\n00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:00.630\nWe'll do worse date of any member, so\nit'll show us the baseline based on\n\n728\n00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.920\nthe lowest common denominator, the weakest\nlink in the chain, if you will.\n\n729\n00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.060\nSo we'll specify that.\n\n730\n00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:05.790\nThat's fine.\n\n731\n00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:09.720\nAnd then, we'll configure our alert as\na result of this monitor going off.\n\n732\n00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.060\nSo if we do have a low threshold,\nwe'll specify that, or\n\n733\n00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.650\na high threshold,\nhow do we want the alert to be generated.\n\n734\n00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:20.080\nIs this monitor when it is generated is\nit a critical state or whatever we set.\n\n735\n00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.839\nWe'll do that.\n\n736\n00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:25.350\nWe could specify our dependency,\nour priority, our severity here.\n\n737\n00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.420\nPut a little alert description in.\n\n738\n00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:34.234\nSo this is my alert for a failed system or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n739\n00:33:34.234 --> 00:33:35.590\nYou'll write that in.\n\n740\n00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:36.830\nWe'll go ahead and click create.\n\n741\n00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.500\nWe'll just give that a second.\n\n742\n00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.661\nAnd then once we stack these up and\nwe have all of these together in our\n\n743\n00:33:42.661 --> 00:33:46.530\nmanagement pack as management\npack objects, we can go back and\n\n744\n00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:50.552\nwhen we look at the management\npack we're not going to see these.\n\n745\n00:33:50.552 --> 00:33:53.982\nAll we're going to see Is just the\nproperties of the management pack name and\n\n746\n00:33:53.982 --> 00:33:56.080\nthe knowledge which we'd\ninput it again for.\n\n747\n00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.040\nSo remember, just an empty container,\nwe don't actually see the objects in other\n\n748\n00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.260\nwords, in the management pack itself, we\nsee them referenced in these views here,\n\n749\n00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.720\nwhere we search and we see what\nmanagement pack their associated with.\n\n750\n00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.549\nSo what we're gonna do now,\nexcuse me, is the following\n\n751\n00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.370\nwe're gonna take a look at what happens\nwhen we go to export the management pack.\n\n752\n00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:20.140\nNow, if I export from console, and\nI'm gonna show you how to do that\n\n753\n00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:24.890\nin just a minute, or export from\nPowerShell, either way it works the same.\n\n754\n00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:26.840\nI'm gonna export from PowerShell.\n\n755\n00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.142\nI've got the SCOM ops\nmanagement shell here.\n\n756\n00:34:29.142 --> 00:34:32.516\nYou'll see I have the\nGet-SCOMManagementPack Commandlet issues,\n\n757\n00:34:32.516 --> 00:34:34.870\nthat gives me a list of\nall the management packs.\n\n758\n00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.770\nNow, I did this before I\ncreated the management pack, so\n\n759\n00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:39.820\nobviously my management pack's\nnot gonna be in that list.\n\n760\n00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.760\nBut I have them all listed here.\n\n761\n00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.070\nAnd the reason we do\nget SCOMManagementPack,\n\n762\n00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.470\nfirst of all show a sealed true or false.\n\n763\n00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:47.920\nGives us the name of the management pack.\n\n764\n00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.320\nWe're gonna need that for\nthe second step if we wanna export\n\n765\n00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.170\nthe management pack from the shell,\nso let's just scroll down.\n\n766\n00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:56.170\nWe have a bunch there.\n\n767\n00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:58.340\nSo, let's scroll down at the bottom here.\n\n768\n00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.540\nAnd once we get the name of the management\npack that we are looking for.\n\n769\n00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.140\nWhatever it may be.\n\n770\n00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.710\nWhat we'll do in the second step here.\n\n771\n00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:10.710\nRight here you can see it is,\nwe'll issue git scum management pack.\n\n772\n00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.930\nSpecified a name in the management\npack that we wanna export.\n\n773\n00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:15.490\nI did Microsoft Windows library.\n\n774\n00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:18.250\nIt's just sitting right up here,\nright above here.\n\n775\n00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:21.740\nAnd then pipe that to an exports\ncome management pack commands.\n\n776\n00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.960\nSo, take this information that\nwe're grabbing over here.\n\n777\n00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.690\nPass it across the pipe\nto this command lit and\n\n778\n00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:31.030\nthis command lit use in\nthis input to operate on.\n\n779\n00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:32.520\nThat's what the pipe does, right?\n\n780\n00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.060\nAnd so our git, the output of our\ngit command becomes the input for\n\n781\n00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.690\nthe export command essentially.\n\n782\n00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.420\nSo we do that and hey,\nwhere do you wanna export that to?\n\n783\n00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.015\nWell I created a little directory on\nthe C drive on a little cloud machine\n\n784\n00:35:43.015 --> 00:35:43.714\ncalled, export.\n\n785\n00:35:43.714 --> 00:35:46.240\nSo, we’re just gonna go in and\ntake a look at that real quick.\n\n786\n00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.700\nSo, let’s just see what’s sitting\nin there, I have that right here,\n\n787\n00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.940\nlet’s just bring that up.\n\n788\n00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:57.350\nAnd what we’ll do is the following,\nlet’s just go to the C drive here.\n\n789\n00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:02.520\nAnd you’ll see that in the C drive we\nhave export and inside export there\n\n790\n00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.510\nis the XML file that gives us all\nthe information for the management pack.\n\n791\n00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:11.610\nNow if you wanna see what's in\na management pack, then this what you do.\n\n792\n00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:13.580\nRight click on this thing, right?\n\n793\n00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.490\nGo ahead and open it.\n\n794\n00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:15.909\nWe just opened it with Notepad.\n\n795\n00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.960\nReal simple to do, just give it a minute.\n\n796\n00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.060\nAll it is is just an XML file.\n\n797\n00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.230\nBut what this does is this lists\neverything in the management pack,\n\n798\n00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:29.550\nincluding all of the objects, property\nIDs, everything associated with it.\n\n799\n00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.360\nNow, I exported the core\nWindows library one.\n\n800\n00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.820\nIt's got a whole bunch of stuff in it.\n\n801\n00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:37.500\nIf we looked in my management pack\nit would be a lot smaller, right?\n\n802\n00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.560\nBut you can see that I've got\na listing of everything in here and\n\n803\n00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.870\nhow it's all related.\n\n804\n00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:46.420\nSo, this is what I get when I export out\nand then I could give this to somebody and\n\n805\n00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:51.350\nsay, hey, import this along with some\nother supporting files that would go\n\n806\n00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:54.780\nwith it and they'd be able to import the\nwhole thing and have the management pack.\n\n807\n00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.010\nNow if we want to export from the console,\nwe could do that as well.\n\n808\n00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.850\nLet's just go take a look real quick.\n\n809\n00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.960\nCome over to administration,\ngo find our management pack.\n\n810\n00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.780\nThere's that one.\n\n811\n00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.550\nIt's unsealed, so\nwe can export it from the console.\n\n812\n00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:07.860\nSupposed to have them\ndo it from PowerShell.\n\n813\n00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.580\nWe can do either one\nwhen they're unsealed.\n\n814\n00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.750\nSo, we can right click, and\nwe can export the management pack.\n\n815\n00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.200\nIf we take a sealed one,\njust to show you, and we right click.\n\n816\n00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.750\nExport is grayed out, so\nwe have to export those unsealed.\n\n817\n00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:23.550\nOne, so let's take that one we just did,\nlet's export that, go ahead and\n\n818\n00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:27.110\nwe'll grab that from the console, let's\nspecify where to put that, I'm just gonna\n\n819\n00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:32.850\ncreate a new folder right here on the\ndesktop and we'll call that exported, so\n\n820\n00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:36.420\nthat we just know the difference between\nthe ones we just did from PowerShell.\n\n821\n00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:40.080\nAnd this one, we'll put it right there,\nlet's just do that real quick, right?\n\n822\n00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.020\nDoesn't take very long.\n\n823\n00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.350\nLet's just go here.\n\n824\n00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.450\nLet's go to our exported folder.\n\n825\n00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.410\nJust drag that over so\nwe can see what's going on in there, and\n\n826\n00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:51.130\nyou'll see we get that same XML file,\nexcept that this one is now just very\n\n827\n00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:55.010\nsmall and really just limited to\nthe two items that I created in there.\n\n828\n00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.910\nTwo objects, right?\n\n829\n00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:59.210\nSo, you could see that exporting,\nwell, it doesn't take much at all.\n\n830\n00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.460\nWe could then bring that\nin if we need to and\n\n831\n00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.690\nadd that into another system\nif you wanna use that.\n\n832\n00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:07.020\nSo, this is what we would do to\ndo some basic customization.\n\n833\n00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.180\nNow, I did show you the SN key,\nthe SN signing tool.\n\n834\n00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.250\nI talked about MP seal and\nI also talked about MP verifier.\n\n835\n00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.220\nI'm gonna show you where\nthose tools are real quick.\n\n836\n00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.240\nWe actually had MP seal a moment ago, but\n\n837\n00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.410\nI changed the directory to\nshow you the export container.\n\n838\n00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.880\nSo let's just go back here and\ntake a look.\n\n839\n00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.840\nWe could see MP verify the tool that we\nuse to verify the all the dependencies\n\n840\n00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.140\nare setup right way and\n\n841\n00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:34.800\nmanagement pack is once we export it\ngonna operate without the errors.\n\n842\n00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.820\nThe MP verify tool you see here Is gonna\nbe in the default install directory for\n\n843\n00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.340\nscums.\n\n844\n00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:45.940\nIt's in program files Microsoft system\ncenter towards of our two apps manager and\n\n845\n00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.580\nthe console sub directory.\n\n846\n00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.840\nWe see MP verified sitting right there and\nwe can go in.\n\n847\n00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.460\nWe can grab that and we can take\na look and we can see that that tools.\n\n848\n00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.120\nThere we've run that from\nthe command line if we need to.\n\n849\n00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.850\nSo we can interact with that.\n\n850\n00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:04.970\nAll the other one that we have let\nme just go in, just go in here.\n\n851\n00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:09.797\nAnd we'll go in, and\nwe're gonna go to the SCAA media.\n\n852\n00:39:09.797 --> 00:39:13.765\nWe're gonna go into the support tools,\nand AMD64.\n\n853\n00:39:15.035 --> 00:39:19.555\nAnd in the AMD64 in\nthe support tools MPSeal.\n\n854\n00:39:19.555 --> 00:39:23.065\nThe tool that we use to seal up\nthe management packs that are unseal just\n\n855\n00:39:23.065 --> 00:39:26.655\nsitting there in the support tools, part\nof the install medias grab it from there.\n\n856\n00:39:26.655 --> 00:39:29.835\nYou run MPSeal and\nthen you can seal the management packs.\n\n857\n00:39:29.835 --> 00:39:32.385\nSo, I can actually go\nseal the management pack\n\n858\n00:39:32.385 --> 00:39:34.595\nthat I just created out of my ITProTV.\n\n859\n00:39:34.595 --> 00:39:38.740\nAnd if you use, remember, the SN Tool to\nbe able to create that key signature.\n\n860\n00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:42.390\nUse that to verify the pack when they\nseal it, so if they have that piece of\n\n861\n00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:46.810\nthe puzzle, but I could go in, I can seal\nthe management pack, I could export it,\n\n862\n00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:51.200\nI can verify with the MP verify tool, make\nsure it's good, and then I could provide\n\n863\n00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.660\nit and they can deal with somebody if they\nwanna go ahead and import it and use it.\n\n864\n00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.640\nSo, it is kind of interesting.\n\n865\n00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.850\nWe can step through that\nwhole process if we want to.\n\n866\n00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:01.833\nDocumentation on how to do the whole\nthing start to finish out on the web.\n\n867\n00:40:01.833 --> 00:40:03.536\nBut, you've seen most\nof the moving parts and\n\n868\n00:40:03.536 --> 00:40:05.072\nseen how we can create a management pack.\n\n869\n00:40:05.072 --> 00:40:07.774\nThe other thing I just want to circle\nback to quickly as we wrap up.\n\n870\n00:40:07.774 --> 00:40:11.315\nWe talked about the Visual Studio\nextensions for authoring and\n\n871\n00:40:11.315 --> 00:40:15.470\nI talked about the fact you get a new\nproject form called management pack.\n\n872\n00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:16.460\nYou can go in and work with that.\n\n873\n00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.800\nWe actually have seven\ndifferent templates,\n\n874\n00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.710\nthat become available under there.\n\n875\n00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.160\nAnd people get thrown by this\nsometimes because they go in and\n\n876\n00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.240\nthey take a look and they get all these or\n\n877\n00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.990\nat least one anyway OPS Manager\n2007 R2 management pack template,\n\n878\n00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:34.530\nwhy do we have that if we're in theory\nusing only the new product now?\n\n879\n00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:39.970\nAnd so we have that,\nwe have 2007 R2 template, we also have 12,\n\n880\n00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:45.910\nwe have 12R2, 12SP1, service manager,\nhas some templates in there as well.\n\n881\n00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.022\nBut we have the OPS Manager,\n2007 R2 pack template,\n\n882\n00:40:49.022 --> 00:40:52.656\ncuz believe it or not number one,\npeople are still using 2007.\n\n883\n00:40:52.656 --> 00:40:56.183\nAnd number two, we can write\nmanagement packs in those environments,\n\n884\n00:40:56.183 --> 00:40:59.532\nand we talked about this,\nwhere we may have coexistence going on and\n\n885\n00:40:59.532 --> 00:41:03.706\nwe can actually create management packs\nfor the 2007 environment if we need to in\n\n886\n00:41:03.706 --> 00:41:07.250\norder to be able to then use them and\nperhaps migrate them over time.\n\n887\n00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.940\nSo just keep in mind that that\nis why we see those templates.\n\n888\n00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.872\nBut those are gonna be there as part\nof the stack when we install in\n\n889\n00:41:12.872 --> 00:41:15.330\nVisual Studio if we choose\nto do our authoring there.\n\n890\n00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.070\nIt's up to us, of course, to decide.\n\n891\n00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:20.430\nBut you can do that, and if you want to,\nyou'll be able to create management packs\n\n892\n00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:23.120\nboth for SCOM and\nalso for Service Manager.\n\n893\n00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.165\nWe haven't really talked much\nabout the Service Manager product.\n\n894\n00:41:26.165 --> 00:41:29.805\nWe've demoed how to install it early\non in one of the first episodes we did.\n\n895\n00:41:29.805 --> 00:41:34.335\nOne of the six or so product installation\ndemos we did with service level manager.\n\n896\n00:41:34.335 --> 00:41:38.365\nWe have an upcoming set of episodes on\nhow to do integration of OPS manager with\n\n897\n00:41:38.365 --> 00:41:39.525\nother products.\n\n898\n00:41:39.525 --> 00:41:42.346\nWe talked about service manager\nconnector and how to link the two.\n\n899\n00:41:42.346 --> 00:41:47.028\nBut we do use managment packs and service\nmanager and we have to keep that in mind.\n\n900\n00:41:47.028 --> 00:41:51.189\nThere is about 135 that get imported\nthere by default off top of my head and\n\n901\n00:41:51.189 --> 00:41:54.116\nthose are the management packs and\nthe extensions for\n\n902\n00:41:54.116 --> 00:41:58.420\nthem i the Visual Studio authoring\nextensions that we were talking about.\n\n903\n00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.590\nThere's three templates specifically for\nthat as well.\n\n904\n00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.050\nSo we can write management packs for\nboth products.\n\n905\n00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.510\nWhich is kind of a nice little value add.\n\n906\n00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.990\nWe talked about customization.\n\n907\n00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:10.130\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft is definitely giving us\nthe keys to the kingdom when it comes to\n\n908\n00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:11.900\ncreating our own management packs.\n\n909\n00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.910\nWe don't have to just stick\nwith what they've given us.\n\n910\n00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:15.530\nObviously, we have third\nparty out there as well but\n\n911\n00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:19.380\nwe can be our own third party provider and\nthat's always kind of fun.\n\n912\n00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:19.950\n&gt;&gt; Thirty rock?\n\n913\n00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:21.055\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thirty rock provider.\n\n914\n00:42:21.055 --> 00:42:24.240\n[LAUGH] So create management packs,\ndive in there, play with this,\n\n915\n00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.850\nlearn how to do it, get your feet wet\nbecause the more you do it obviously\n\n916\n00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:29.830\nthe better you're gonna get at it, you're\ngonna understand the intricacies of it.\n\n917\n00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:33.350\nAdam you've done a fine job of\nshowing us how to do that very thing,\n\n918\n00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.250\ngiving us the information, walking us\nthrough some of the steps even, and\n\n919\n00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:39.940\ncreating one customize\nmanagement pack on your machine.\n\n920\n00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:41.660\nSo very, very thankful for that.\n\n921\n00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.130\nBut I'm looking at the clock and\nit looks like we've run out of time for\n\n922\n00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:45.280\nthis episode.\n\n923\n00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.244\nBut hopefully you are now management\npack aware and can create your own.\n\n924\n00:42:48.244 --> 00:42:51.182\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n925\n00:42:51.182 --> 00:42:52.461\nWe thank you for watching.\n\n926\n00:42:52.461 --> 00:42:53.794\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n927\n00:42:53.794 -->

Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.950\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.870\nAdam, welcome back again.\n\n12\n00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.720\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.011\n&gt;&gt; It is going well, it is a SCOM-ify.\n\n14\n00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.400\n&gt;&gt; SCOM-ified day here at\nITProTV in studio number\n\n16\n00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.600\n&gt;&gt; Not one, not two, not three, but four.\n\n17\n00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.300\n&gt;&gt; Cuatro.\n&gt;&gt; Studio number four, cuatro.\n\n18\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.300\nThe number of shots in my\nespresso this morning as well.\n\n19\n00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.250\nSo we are going to\ncontinue our conversation.\n\n20\n00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.390\nLet's talk a little bit about integration.\n\n21\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.290\nYou know integration is\nalways an important topic.\n\n22\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.800\nWhen we integrate ops master with some\nof the other system center products.\n\n23\n00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.080\nWe talked about them.\n\n24\n00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.450\nIf you haven't seen us do that,\n\n25\n00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.010\ngo back, take a look at our prior episodes\naround architecture and overview.\n\n26\n00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.050\nWe talked about service level manager.\n\n27\n00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.430\nWe talked about data protection manager.\n\n28\n00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.310\nWe talked about orchestrator.\n\n29\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.920\nWe talked about system\ncenter config manager.\n\n30\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.350\nWe've talked about a lot,\nthe virtual machine manager.\n\n31\n00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.380\nYou see me and Daniel interact with,\ndemo, discuss.\n\n32\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.420\nAnd you'll refer to\nmany of these products.\n\n33\n00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.020\nWe've played with or interacted with\na lot of them, in terms of demoing.\n\n34\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.980\nAnd showing you individual pieces and\ncomponent parts.\n\n35\n00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.520\nOr various things that may\ngo on in terms of focus,\n\n36\n00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.040\nin terms of ability in\nsome of these tools, and\n\n37\n00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.380\ntalked about how they could work\ntogether in prior episodes.\n\n38\n00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.640\nWe actually did an entire series\nof episodes around installing and\n\n39\n00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.070\nconfiguring all these different tools.\n\n40\n00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.990\nBut we really haven't until this point\ntalked about what goes on under the hood.\n\n41\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.270\nWith regards to integrating them and\ngetting them to work together, because we\n\n42\n00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.850\ncommunicate together and we coordinate\ntogether through what we call connectors.\n\n43\n00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.910\nAnd we're gonna take a look at that after\nwe do just a little bit of an overview.\n\n44\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.390\nTalk a bit about some of the products,\n\n45\n00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.770\nremind you about what they are and\nwhat they do.\n\n46\n00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.240\nWe're gonna go in,\ndo a few demonstrations for you.\n\n47\n00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.510\nShow you how to set up the connectors\nfrom Service Level Manager\n\n48\n00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.480\nout to the various individual\ncomponents we have to link.\n\n49\n00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.770\nWe're gonna take a look\nback at Orchestrator.\n\n50\n00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.120\nDid this in a couple of episodes prior as\nwe were taking a look at the functionality\n\n51\n00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.120\nof Orchestrator.\n\n52\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.390\nWe're gonna go back in, and we're gonna\ntake a look at how to install and\n\n53\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.540\nimport integration packs in Orchestrator.\n\n54\n00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.880\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n55\n00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.240\nWe'll load them up into the server.\n\n56\n00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.790\nAnd we'll actually then take a look\nat how to create a runbook with that.\n\n57\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.120\nSo we're gonna do somethings that we've\ndone, but go a little bit deeper and\n\n58\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.460\nactually, bring in all those moving parts,\ncoordinate everything together.\n\n59\n00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.170\nSo it should be an interesting\nconversation for us.\n\n60\n00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.800\nLet's start by talking\nabout Service Manager.\n\n61\n00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.210\nService Level Manager, Service Manager,\nhow ever you want to refer to it.\n\n62\n00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.130\nThis is our product that allows us to\nstand up our Help Desk or Service Desk.\n\n63\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.940\nComing out whether you're I till centric,\n\n64\n00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.600\nor just generically\nreferring to it that way.\n\n65\n00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.730\nThe service level manager,\nthe piece software,\n\n66\n00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.400\nthe product in the System Center suite,\nis gonna be our hub or communication and\n\n67\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.900\ncoordination for all the information that\nwe're gonna gather and get out of SCOM.\n\n68\n00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.370\nSo as we're doing our monitoring, and\nas we're getting alerts, we're getting\n\n69\n00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.210\ninformation generated about health status,\nall thing we've been taking a look at and\n\n70\n00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.190\ntalking about our management\npacks are humming along.\n\n71\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.960\nWe've done our customization as we\ntalked about in prior episodes and\n\n72\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.350\nwe've done the monitoring.\n\n73\n00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.850\nWe have the data coming\ninto the data bases,\n\n74\n00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.840\nnow what we want to do is connect up\nto service level manager and have that\n\n75\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.340\ninformation that gets generated in scum\nstart to actually work for us, right.\n\n76\n00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.640\nWe want it to start generating tickets\nover in the service level manager,\n\n77\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.170\nkick off our incident and\n\n78\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.030\nproblem management processes, look at\nactivity management, change management.\n\n79\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.600\nRelease management,\nsurface request fulfillment.\n\n80\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.030\nThese are all of the different solutions\nthat a surface level manager brings to\n\n81\n00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.030\nthe table for us.\n\n82\n00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.050\nAnd I've spoken about this in other\nepisodes where I've talked out this\n\n83\n00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.950\nconnectivity that needs to take place and\nthe fact that the value\n\n84\n00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.427\nof SCOM is not the information that we\ngather that just sits in the databases.\n\n85\n00:04:15.427 --> 00:04:21.230\nAnd is essentially just static, but rather\nIt's the value of taking that information,\n\n86\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.700\nand putting it to work for us by having\nto communicate out to other systems,\n\n87\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.380\nwhat status may be on an individual\nend points being monitored or\n\n88\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.740\nwhat change in status may look like.\n\n89\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.600\nAnd then creating action, and\n\n90\n00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.060\ncreating resolution as\na result of that information.\n\n91\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.560\nSo wanna be thinking about that as we're\nthinking about how we can work with\n\n92\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.430\nservice manager what that looks like and\nthe value of that.\n\n93\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.190\nGonna take out on the web in just a minute\nshow you one of those documentation pages\n\n94\n00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.330\nwe keep referring to ground service\nmanager, give you a high level overview,\n\n95\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.365\njust to look at and\ngive you some information about it.\n\n96\n00:04:55.365 --> 00:04:58.715\nBut let's think about how service\nmanager integrates, not just with SCOM,\n\n97\n00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.445\nbut with these other components.\n\n98\n00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:03.805\nWe have a configuration manager connector,\nout to FCCM,\n\n99\n00:05:03.805 --> 00:05:06.565\nthe configuration manager solution.\n\n100\n00:05:06.565 --> 00:05:09.500\nWe have the ops manager connectors,\nas I was just talking about.\n\n101\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.980\nWe have one for\nalert generation, one for CI or\n\n102\n00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.550\nconfiguration item generation and\nupdating, so that we can be monitoring\n\n103\n00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.380\ncreating information inside\nof our service level manager.\n\n104\n00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.880\nThe service level manager\nIs in the language of ITIL.\n\n105\n00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.410\nIf you're familiar with\nthe thought processes of ITIL and\n\n106\n00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.310\nthe ITIL framework, is our configuration\nmanagement database solution\n\n107\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.440\nin the sense that it maintains our CMDB?\n\n108\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.520\nIt is going to work with the config\nmanager product which is where we also\n\n109\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.495\nmaintain knowledge of the copies of this\ninformation and it is going to help us to\n\n110\n00:05:45.495 --> 00:05:50.500\nco-ordinate the information flow\nbetween these products keeping track\n\n111\n00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.520\nof an updating our C I so our\nconfiguration items sends their entries\n\n112\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.580\nthat go into the configuration management\ndatabase that we maintain through SCCM.\n\n113\n00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.510\nBut now knowledge of that information\nis shared with different areas, so\n\n114\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.020\nwe can masterfully update that as\nthings happen in near real time.\n\n115\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.080\nAnd on the front end,\nour incident and problem and\n\n116\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.400\nchange management solutions,\nall tied to a line,\n\n117\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.230\nare linked directly through this tool,\ninto the broader CMDB context.\n\n118\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.110\nAnd so\nthis becomes a very important focal point.\n\n119\n00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.470\nA crossroads for information flow and\n\n120\n00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.880\nmanagement inside of\nthe system center solution.\n\n121\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.740\nWe have our orchestrator connector.\n\n122\n00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.680\nTake a look at that as we said and\nshow you how we connect to\n\n123\n00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.650\nour run book solutions so\nthat we can design our run books.\n\n124\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.210\nAnd we can actually do integration and\nwork flow.\n\n125\n00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.060\nWe have our virtual machine manager\nconnector, connect out to SCVMM.\n\n126\n00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.840\nWe can then spin up VMs interact\nwith them, do a variety of things.\n\n127\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.510\nAnd we have active directory integrations.\n\n128\n00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.630\nWe have an active directory connector,\nas well, that allows us to go in and\n\n129\n00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.430\nto interact with and pull down\ninformation from the AD as needed.\n\n130\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.640\nWe do health and performance\nmonitoring of the environment, so\n\n131\n00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.110\nwe can tell what's going on.\n\n132\n00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.520\nWe have a service manager management pack.\n\n133\n00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.564\nThat we can download and\ninstall an ops manager.\n\n134\n00:07:09.564 --> 00:07:14.010\nSo SCOM can be used to monitor and\nmanage Service Level Manager over all.\n\n135\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.440\nBut then Service Level Manager can be\nused to coordinate the communication\n\n136\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.530\nto all the different aspects and\nareas of the products we work with\n\n137\n00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.170\nin order to ensure that\neverybody's up to date,\n\n138\n00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.160\neverybody knows what's happening\nwith the latest information,\n\n139\n00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.950\nwe make educated decisions about what\nactivities we need to engage in.\n\n140\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.170\nAnd the status of our infrastructure,\n\n141\n00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.540\nbecause everybody's\ngoing to be being told.\n\n142\n00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.690\nWhen I say everybody, I mean all of\nthe component parts systems center\n\n143\n00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.220\nin the suite are going to\nbe told what's happening.\n\n144\n00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.189\nSo as the status of a web server updates\nand changes and perhaps a resource pool is\n\n145\n00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:50.362\ngoing to either come online, or\nnot be available in the IIS stack.\n\n146\n00:07:50.362 --> 00:07:53.590\nAs a result of under or\noverwhelming the server.\n\n147\n00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.760\nWe then can be told, across every product.\n\n148\n00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.616\nThat that status is happening.\n\n149\n00:07:58.616 --> 00:08:02.656\nAnd the appropriate actions, changes,\nupdates and information can start\n\n150\n00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:07.610\nto show up on dashboards, be executed,\nbe managed, be logged, be interacted with.\n\n151\n00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.950\nAnd this is where we start to see\nthe value that is rolling forward with\n\n152\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.610\ndeploying this entire suite\nof products because we're now\n\n153\n00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.720\ncentrally managing information.\n\n154\n00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.740\nAmplifying the value of that information\nout to the organization so that every area\n\n155\n00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.820\nthat needs to interact with it,\ngets that information in near real time.\n\n156\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.380\nIt can make decisions that are gonna\nbe impactful to the betterment\n\n157\n00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.380\nof the organizational infrastructure\nin terms of maintaining its integrity,\n\n158\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.150\nits viability, its availability, right.\n\n159\n00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.820\nSo all of these things\nare gonna be important for us.\n\n160\n00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.840\nWe have the Data Protection Manager,\nand we integrate there.\n\n161\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.920\nThe DPM product is our\nenterprise backup solution.\n\n162\n00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.300\nSo any of those products you may be\nusing outside from third-party vendors,\n\n163\n00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.170\nDPM is gonna be that\nversion in System Center.\n\n164\n00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.140\nRemember, this provides data backup and\n\n165\n00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.440\nrestore functionality\nacross the enterprise.\n\n166\n00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.090\nFor Windows servers, for client operating\nsystems, we have those capabilities there.\n\n167\n00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.150\nWe do integrate with Ops Manager\nthrough the DPM Central Console.\n\n168\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.080\nWe'll talk a bit about the console,\nhow it works,\n\n169\n00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.000\nwhat it does here, in just a moment.\n\n170\n00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.690\nBut we can manage multiple DPM servers,\nso we have multiple instances,\n\n171\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.065\ndepending on how big\nour infrastructure is.\n\n172\n00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:18.045\nMonitor and maintain health and\navailability of DPM with the console.\n\n173\n00:09:18.045 --> 00:09:21.275\nWe have protection and\nconsistency status that is maintained and\n\n174\n00:09:21.275 --> 00:09:24.905\navailable and updated in the console for\nall the protected data sources.\n\n175\n00:09:24.905 --> 00:09:28.965\nSo all the different end points that we\nare feeding in and managing will be there.\n\n176\n00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.150\nWe do have Operations Manager packs,\ntwo of them, that are important for\n\n177\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.410\nDPM that we have to import and integrate.\n\n178\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.710\nWe have the Microsoft System Center\nData Protection Manager 2012\n\n179\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.210\nDiscovery Management Pack, and\nthe 2012 Library Management Pack.\n\n180\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.600\nTwo management packs that we're\ngonna bring in and interact with.\n\n181\n00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.370\nAnd once we do that, and then we set\nup and install the central console,\n\n182\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.690\nwe have different views and tasks\nthat become available inside of SCOM.\n\n183\n00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.660\nAnd we can then interact with that.\n\n184\n00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.430\nWe can use that to manage,\nto maintain integrity, and\n\n185\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.740\nto do all things we need to do.\n\n186\n00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.220\nSo we'll take a look at some information\non that here in just a minute, as well.\n\n187\n00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.085\nWe have the Orchestrator product,\nwe integrate Orchestrator.\n\n188\n00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:10.280\nWe've demonstrated some of this\nintegration for you in prior episodes.\n\n189\n00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.510\nWe've talked about it.\n\n190\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.860\nWe integrate with SCOM through what\nis known as integration packs,\n\n191\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.730\nas I mentioned.\n\n192\n00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:20.260\nSo we import integration packs\ninto the Orchestrator product.\n\n193\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.665\nAnd then that gives us the ability to work\nwith the component parts that we need to\n\n194\n00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:28.485\nbe able to drag out on the grid and\ncreate our workflows and sync them up.\n\n195\n00:10:28.485 --> 00:10:30.200\nWe're actually gonna take\na look at how to do that.\n\n196\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.050\nWe've done that in a prior episode, but\ndid just a very high level, generic pass.\n\n197\n00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.820\nWe didn't really set one up,\nprogram it out the right way.\n\n198\n00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.150\nWe'll actually take\na look at how to do that.\n\n199\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.510\nSo a list of integration packs for SCOM.\n\n200\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.370\nI'm gonna show you where that is and\nhow we can find those with Orchestrator.\n\n201\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.260\nSo it's important just to be aware of\nwhat's out there, what's available for us.\n\n202\n00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.250\nSo we'll take a look.\n\n203\n00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.730\nOnce we get those integration packs up and\nrunning, all those activities,\n\n204\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.410\nas I mentioned, will be available.\n\n205\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.390\nAnd we'll take a look at what those\nactivities look like on the web\n\n206\n00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.190\nhere as well.\n\n207\n00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.730\nLet's go over and\n\n208\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.610\njust take a look at a few of these\nweb pages I keep referring to.\n\n209\n00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.660\nI'll show you some information you\ncould use to follow up with us here\n\n210\n00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.630\nbefore we actually jump in and\n\n211\n00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.270\nstart to do a couple of demos and\nshow you how all the magic happens, right.\n\n212\n00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.730\nSo Service Manager over here, right.\n\n213\n00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.320\nService Manager, we talked about this.\n\n214\n00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.780\nTechnical Documentation, where do we get\nall the information for Service Manager?\n\n215\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.200\nWhat are the kind of things we wanna know?\n\n216\n00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.540\nHow do we plan to set it up?\n\n217\n00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.670\nHow do we deploy it?\n\n218\n00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.120\nHow do we upgrade if we\nhave an earlier version?\n\n219\n00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.960\nAnd now we all know about\nupgrades versus migration, so\n\n220\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.780\nwe got that whole thing worked out.\n\n221\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.690\nHow do we administer it?\n\n222\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.570\nHow do we actually configure it and\nintegrate it?\n\n223\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.110\nSo all the information you would\nwanna have available to you\n\n224\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.880\nis gonna be sitting right here.\n\n225\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.530\nWe have a little nice\ndownload link right here.\n\n226\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.771\nAnd this is one of the things that I\nlike about the documentation stack, and\n\n227\n00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:48.375\nI mentioned this in other episodes.\n\n228\n00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:51.928\nWe have a link that lets us download\na copy of the typical documentation for\n\n229\n00:11:51.928 --> 00:11:54.067\nService Level Manager, right from there.\n\n230\n00:11:54.067 --> 00:11:58.760\nSo if we click on that link, let's just do\nthat real quick just so you can see that,\n\n231\n00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.755\nwhat we'll get is a link\nto the download center, and\n\n232\n00:12:01.755 --> 00:12:06.615\ndownload technical documentation for\nSystem Center 2012- Service Manager.\n\n233\n00:12:06.615 --> 00:12:11.404\nAnd so when we go in and grab this, this\nis gonna have all that information for us.\n\n234\n00:12:11.404 --> 00:12:13.730\nAnd look at all the different\nthings that are in here.\n\n235\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.450\nWe have the admin, doc and pdf,\nthe authoring doc and pdf, and\n\n236\n00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.570\nthe complete documentation stack there.\n\n237\n00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.678\nSo we can do the individual pieces and,\nor the full set.\n\n238\n00:12:23.678 --> 00:12:24.862\nSo we get everything, right.\n\n239\n00:12:24.862 --> 00:12:29.195\nHow do we actually use the authoring\ncapabilities to create management packs in\n\n240\n00:12:29.195 --> 00:12:30.572\nSurface Level Manager?\n\n241\n00:12:30.572 --> 00:12:32.880\nIf you want to know about that,\nyou can take a look there.\n\n242\n00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.390\nAnd how do we administer it?\n\n243\n00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.060\nIt would be good for you to go in,\ngrab a copy of this documentation, and\n\n244\n00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:38.680\nmake sure you have it.\n\n245\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.300\nAnd they make the point on the website,\nhey, come back and check out the link so\n\n246\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.440\nthat you get the most up-to-date\nstuff every so often.\n\n247\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.290\nAnd so you're gonna wanna do that.\n\n248\n00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.775\nData Protection Manager,\nwe talked about DPM.\n\n249\n00:12:49.775 --> 00:12:51.435\nYou'll see DPM here.\n\n250\n00:12:51.435 --> 00:12:55.335\nWe have information about DPM,\nbut also, interestingly,\n\n251\n00:12:55.335 --> 00:12:59.335\ninformation about the Microsoft Azure\nstorage solutions, where we can actually\n\n252\n00:12:59.335 --> 00:13:02.532\nprovide essentially the same\nfunctionality through the cloud now.\n\n253\n00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.982\nAnd we can use the Azure product line, or\n\n254\n00:13:04.982 --> 00:13:07.682\nthe Azure fabric to be\nable to do our backup and\n\n255\n00:13:07.682 --> 00:13:12.302\nour restoration solutions if we're running\nthe cloud solution through Microsoft.\n\n256\n00:13:12.302 --> 00:13:15.582\nRemember, we could do on-prem\nprivate cloud hosted by us.\n\n257\n00:13:15.582 --> 00:13:18.542\nWe could do private cloud hosted\noff-prem through Microsoft.\n\n258\n00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:21.222\nWe could do public,\nprivate, hybrid clouds.\n\n259\n00:13:21.222 --> 00:13:22.922\nSo we have different options here.\n\n260\n00:13:22.922 --> 00:13:27.832\nAnd they talk about how we could configure\nAzure Backup for DPM data, and actually\n\n261\n00:13:27.832 --> 00:13:32.120\nback up through DPM out into Azure and\nhave a secondary line of defense.\n\n262\n00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.340\nSo there's different ways for\nus to do this.\n\n263\n00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.540\nWe can integrate Azure directly\nwith our on-prem DPM solution.\n\n264\n00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.510\nSo there's a lot of new things\ngoing on in the space, and\n\n265\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.450\nit's definitely important for\nyou to be aware of them.\n\n266\n00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:44.470\nTake a look at them.\n\n267\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.520\nWe've got information here about DPM,\nhow it works.\n\n268\n00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.040\nDefinitely want to take a look at that.\n\n269\n00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.410\nWe've got our documentation for DPM.\n\n270\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:55.360\nDownload link right here, just like\nwe did for Service Level Manager.\n\n271\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.760\nWe go in, we take a look.\n\n272\n00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.830\nWe could see Data Protection Manager,\nour download information here.\n\n273\n00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.230\nNot as much, it's really just\neither the PDF or the Word doc, and\n\n274\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.140\nit gives you all the detailed information.\n\n275\n00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.366\nBut, again, it would be a good idea for\nyou to go out, take a look at that,\n\n276\n00:14:09.366 --> 00:14:12.457\nmake sure you're up-to-date,\nhave the most recent information.\n\n277\n00:14:12.457 --> 00:14:16.486\nI find that with DPM, in particular, it's\none of those products that either people\n\n278\n00:14:16.486 --> 00:14:19.967\nlove and they know about and they use,\nor they just don't have any clue.\n\n279\n00:14:19.967 --> 00:14:23.101\nThey're like, wow,\nthat product exists in Microsoft stack,\n\n280\n00:14:23.101 --> 00:14:25.230\nwe had no idea that you guys do that.\n\n281\n00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.514\nWhen I talk to customers because it's one\nof those products you just don't really\n\n282\n00:14:28.514 --> 00:14:29.524\nhear a lot of talk about.\n\n283\n00:14:29.524 --> 00:14:32.147\nIt's either, hey,\nwe have a need and we use it, or\n\n284\n00:14:32.147 --> 00:14:34.844\nit's one of those things\nthat's off in the corner.\n\n285\n00:14:34.844 --> 00:14:38.404\nYou buy and license the System Center\nsuite through an EA, typically,\n\n286\n00:14:38.404 --> 00:14:39.779\nan enterprise agreement.\n\n287\n00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:42.643\nBut the reality is, as we talked about\nin some of the earlier episodes,\n\n288\n00:14:42.643 --> 00:14:44.770\nyou don't always deploy all the products,\nright.\n\n289\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.560\nSo you usually have one or two of those\nthings that just kind hang out and\n\n290\n00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.304\nyou don't necessarily use them.\n\n291\n00:14:49.304 --> 00:14:51.760\nOrchestrator tends to be\na product like that, as well.\n\n292\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.740\nPeople either love it and\nknow all about it and do it, or\n\n293\n00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.260\nthey just don't really use it because they\njust don't understand what it does, and\n\n294\n00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.640\ndon't really have an understanding\nof how it can add value for them.\n\n295\n00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.020\nThis is the whole PowerShell\nconcept again, right.\n\n296\n00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.830\nWhy use a console,\nwhy use the scripting language,\n\n297\n00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.585\nwhy automate,\nwhen I can go in and do things?\n\n298\n00:15:08.585 --> 00:15:10.962\nAnd it's that mindset that we\nhave to get ourselves out of.\n\n299\n00:15:10.962 --> 00:15:15.286\nSo it's really important for\nyou, as SCOM information owners,\n\n300\n00:15:15.286 --> 00:15:18.832\nas administrators,\nI was gonna say as SCOM masters.\n\n301\n00:15:18.832 --> 00:15:20.724\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that sounds like scrum masters, and\n\n302\n00:15:20.724 --> 00:15:21.922\nyeah that's very close though.\n\n303\n00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:23.699\n&gt;&gt; That's very different, though [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; It is very different, exactly.\n\n304\n00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:25.646\nBut as IT professionals, right,\n\n305\n00:15:25.646 --> 00:15:28.948\nthat are working with not just\nSystem Center Ops Manager.\n\n306\n00:15:28.948 --> 00:15:31.461\nBut I tell my customers,\nmy students, this all the time.\n\n307\n00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:35.503\nWhen you work with one of these products,\nyou have to expect to have knowledge of,\n\n308\n00:15:35.503 --> 00:15:39.136\nand understand how to work with\nthe entire suite, if you're really gonna\n\n309\n00:15:39.136 --> 00:15:43.435\nget value out of this thought process, and\nthe investment that you're about to make.\n\n310\n00:15:43.435 --> 00:15:45.996\nThis is not a, hey, I'll plunk down\na couple of thousand dollars and\n\n311\n00:15:45.996 --> 00:15:47.602\nI'll get a piece of software investment.\n\n312\n00:15:47.602 --> 00:15:52.589\nYou're licensing a suite of products that\nwill cost several tens of thousands of\n\n313\n00:15:52.589 --> 00:15:54.643\ndollars to license, install and\n\n314\n00:15:54.643 --> 00:15:58.033\nmaintain per year over\nthe lifecycle of the solution.\n\n315\n00:15:58.033 --> 00:16:00.182\nCuz you gotta think about,\nyou need the OS.\n\n316\n00:16:00.182 --> 00:16:02.782\nUnderlying every one of these installs,\nright?\n\n317\n00:16:02.782 --> 00:16:07.349\nEven if you have an EA or\n12R2 data center, you're paying for\n\n318\n00:16:07.349 --> 00:16:09.220\nthat licensing, right?\n\n319\n00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.938\nYou've gotta think about\nthe per instance cost of that.\n\n320\n00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:14.815\nYou're gonna pay for\nthe license for the product itself,\n\n321\n00:16:14.815 --> 00:16:18.325\nor the System Center suite and\nthe licensing for it.\n\n322\n00:16:18.325 --> 00:16:22.105\nYou then gotta factor in, although it's a\nsoft cost, you've gotta factor in the cost\n\n323\n00:16:22.105 --> 00:16:25.907\nof all the knowledge acquisition it\ntakes to stand these products up.\n\n324\n00:16:25.907 --> 00:16:27.562\nYou've got to factor in the hardware,\n\n325\n00:16:27.562 --> 00:16:30.992\nor the hosting cost associated\nwith cloud or OnPrem.\n\n326\n00:16:30.992 --> 00:16:32.892\nBy the time you slice all that up,\n\n327\n00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:36.472\nascribe the cost to this on\na bottom line spreadsheet.\n\n328\n00:16:36.472 --> 00:16:40.816\nLook at it over a five year lifecycle for\nacquisition and management.\n\n329\n00:16:40.816 --> 00:16:44.286\nIt's a substantial amount of money\nto run this suite of products.\n\n330\n00:16:44.286 --> 00:16:46.656\nI'm not saying it's not a good investment,\nquite the opposite.\n\n331\n00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:48.656\nI think it's a very smart investment for\n\n332\n00:16:48.656 --> 00:16:51.096\nmost companies to put the money down and\ndo this.\n\n333\n00:16:51.096 --> 00:16:54.666\nBut, you gotta have a compelling\nbusiness need that you're gonna address,\n\n334\n00:16:54.666 --> 00:16:57.016\nnot just one need in\none part of the stack,\n\n335\n00:16:57.016 --> 00:17:00.510\nand this is where a lot of people\nmake mistakes with this product.\n\n336\n00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.490\nThey get suckered into buying System\nCenter, but they don't really have a need\n\n337\n00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.390\nfor all the products, and instead go hey,\nI just need configuration management.\n\n338\n00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:13.290\nLet's get you the whole license,\nright, and we'll get you five,\n\n339\n00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:17.280\nsix other products you don't need,\nand we'll go ahead, and we'll give you\n\n340\n00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.560\nSystem Center config manager kind\nof as the consolation prize, right?\n\n341\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.770\nThe reality is,\nwe're gonna buy this suite of products.\n\n342\n00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.670\nWe better understand how to manage it.\n\n343\n00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.990\nYou better understand how to deploy it.\n\n344\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.720\nAnd you better start using it because\nyou've essentially spent all this money,\n\n345\n00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.430\nand you're not really\ngetting any value out of it.\n\n346\n00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.970\n&gt;&gt; It's like buying an F-22 to\ngo to the grocery store, right?\n\n347\n00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:36.920\nIt's just too much.\n\n348\n00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.311\n&gt;&gt; That's just awesomely cool.\n\n349\n00:17:38.311 --> 00:17:39.678\n[LAUGH] There's no down side to that.\n\n350\n00:17:39.678 --> 00:17:40.381\n&gt;&gt; It's awesome right?\n\n351\n00:17:40.381 --> 00:17:41.002\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; There's no\n\n352\n00:17:41.002 --> 00:17:41.920\ndown side\n&gt;&gt; Inside of that.\n\n353\n00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.930\n&gt;&gt; Huge selling point.\n\n354\n00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.870\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; You will be the most awesome person\n\n355\n00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:45.470\nin that parking lot.\n\n356\n00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.660\n&gt;&gt; And you get your own parking spot.\n\n357\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you definitely do.\n\n358\n00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.440\n&gt;&gt; Right, because nobody, and if they\npark in your spot, you take care of them.\n\n359\n00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.435\nSo it's cool.\n\n360\n00:17:52.435 --> 00:17:54.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's no down side of that at all.\n\n361\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.400\nI think that's a legitimate\nspending of money myself.\n\n362\n00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.120\nI mean, I do that, don't you?\n\n363\n00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.140\n&gt;&gt; I've got $80 million.\n\n364\n00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.430\nPlus the upkeep and\nthe maintenance cost, right?\n\n365\n00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:04.820\nNot to mention the gas bill for that.\n\n366\n00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.212\n&gt;&gt; What does that run [CROSSTALK] geeze.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so anyway,\n\n367\n00:18:06.212 --> 00:18:08.200\nlet's get back to what\nwe were talking about.\n\n368\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.810\nThat was our random aside for\nthis episode, by the way.\n\n369\n00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.240\nSo, installing the central console.\n\n370\n00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.180\nWe talked a bit about this.\n\n371\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.050\nI just wanna show you\nthe documentation here for this.\n\n372\n00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:17.820\nMaking sure we know.\n\n373\n00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.900\nAnd remember,\nwhen we talk about the central console,\n\n374\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.660\nwe're talking about the DPM console,\nright?\n\n375\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.690\nJust to be clear.\n\n376\n00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:26.280\nSo, we wanna make sure we know\n&gt;&gt; That we can go in.\n\n377\n00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.910\nAnd we talk about how to install the Ops\nManager agent and the central console.\n\n378\n00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.300\nSo how do we manage multiple DPM servers?\n\n379\n00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.120\nI talked a bit about that,\nthe need to do that.\n\n380\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.485\nHave the management packs and\nthe integration and all that.\n\n381\n00:18:36.485 --> 00:18:39.825\nThat, so installing the Ops Manager agent,\nsetting up and\n\n382\n00:18:39.825 --> 00:18:42.455\ninstalling the console if you're\ngonna be working with DPM.\n\n383\n00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.315\nMaking sure we know how to do that.\n\n384\n00:18:44.315 --> 00:18:49.005\nImport the reporting management pack,\ngenerate DPM reports from Ops Manager.\n\n385\n00:18:49.005 --> 00:18:50.465\nHow do we get all of that stuff in?\n\n386\n00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:53.363\nAll of the supporting elements,\nthere's a link right down there for that.\n\n387\n00:18:53.363 --> 00:18:56.591\nSo making sure we have all\nthose moving parts and pieces,\n\n388\n00:18:56.591 --> 00:18:58.720\ngonna be important for you.\n\n389\n00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.857\nKeep in mind, just before we talk about\nintegration packs for Orchestrator,\n\n390\n00:19:02.857 --> 00:19:06.568\na lot of times by the time you get to\nSystem Center and you license this.\n\n391\n00:19:06.568 --> 00:19:09.318\nYou've got another product\nthat does what EPM does.\n\n392\n00:19:09.318 --> 00:19:13.048\nYou probably have another product\nthat does several of these things.\n\n393\n00:19:13.048 --> 00:19:16.101\nHave this conversation all the time\nwith customers because they're doing\n\n394\n00:19:16.101 --> 00:19:18.480\nthe competitive analysis,\nand they're sitting there.\n\n395\n00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.288\nOkay, we're gonna buy systems center and\nwe're gonna licence the EA, and\n\n396\n00:19:22.288 --> 00:19:25.100\nwe need SCOM to be able to do\nglobal service monitoring.\n\n397\n00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.230\nThe outside in, monitoring for\n\n398\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.330\ntransactions from the user's\nperspective against our web stack.\n\n399\n00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.210\nWe've talked about this and\nhow important this is.\n\n400\n00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:36.428\nWe've got solar winds in Orion or\nwhatever it is that is doing that now for\n\n401\n00:19:36.428 --> 00:19:38.794\nspice works or whatever you're using.\n\n402\n00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:42.066\nYou wanna get off those platforms and not\nthat those platforms are bad by the way,\n\n403\n00:19:42.066 --> 00:19:44.298\nthose platforms are awesome\nthey are great products.\n\n404\n00:19:44.298 --> 00:19:48.003\nThere's nothing wrong with them, but\nyou know, lot of venders are saying,\n\n405\n00:19:48.003 --> 00:19:52.320\nhey we've got this piece, but they may not\nhave at all than one solution, a stuck.\n\n406\n00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.930\nMicrosoft has stock, so they convinced\ncustomers and rightly so, in certain\n\n407\n00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:00.830\nrespects, that it may be better to have\neverything integrated in one place.\n\n408\n00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.460\nUse our product stack because we provide\nall these capabilities, we connect them,\n\n409\n00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.460\nwe link them,\nit's linked to the directory.\n\n410\n00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.730\nYou and\nI were talking about the value of the AD,\n\n411\n00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.740\nthe the LDAP I provided, how that's\nkind of the central lynchpin for\n\n412\n00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.810\nMicrosoft because it's really one\nof the most valuable pieces of\n\n413\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.010\ninformation management architecture\nthat they possess and provide.\n\n414\n00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:27.880\nand linking everything through that,\nexchange, share point, system center,\n\n415\n00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.900\nI mean think about all the stuff that runs\nthrough the directory the app of directory\n\n416\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.840\ntoday there is a lot of stuff\nthat we just kind of take for\n\n417\n00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.110\ngranted that is there right, we just dont\nstop to think about it all that often.\n\n418\n00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.350\nSo thinking about that,\nthere's a very compelling argument for\n\n419\n00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.310\na lot of individuals,\n\n420\n00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:48.150\na lot of organizations that centralizing\non that stack may actually be valuable.\n\n421\n00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.800\nThere's the flip side which\nis you got one vendor.\n\n422\n00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.030\nThere are concerns from a security\nperspective From a structural perspective,\n\n423\n00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.810\nfrom a viability perspective,\nyou hear those arguments as well.\n\n424\n00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.640\nDon't think Microsoft is getting out\nof the hey we're building software for\n\n425\n00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.210\na living business any time soon, so-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n426\n00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.440\n&gt;&gt; I don't think that's going to be a\n\n427\n00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.960\nproblem, but you put all your eggs in one,\n&gt;&gt; Basket, there's a risk there.\n\n428\n00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.810\nAnd we gotta understand from\na security and a governance risk and\n\n429\n00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.560\nreliance perspective that that may\nactually not be such a good thing.\n\n430\n00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.910\nI mean, there are upsides and\ndownsides in other words.\n\n431\n00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.900\nSo we do wanna do the cost\nbenefit analysis.\n\n432\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.290\nWe do wanna understand\nKind of where we are, and\n\n433\n00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.660\nbe educated in terms of\nbeing a consumer about this.\n\n434\n00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.700\nBut the ideas that I hear from a lot of\ncustomers say we're buying this product or\n\n435\n00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.140\nevaluating it, because of this or\nthat particular feature,\n\n436\n00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.500\nand What's the competitive\nanalysis against this other stack.\n\n437\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.400\nSo how does global service\nmonitoring as one example,\n\n438\n00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.860\nstack up against what we\ncan do with solar winds?\n\n439\n00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.950\nOr one of the other products?\n\n440\n00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.670\nHow does DPM stack up with\nwhat we already do or can do?\n\n441\n00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.790\nWith backup exec, or arch serve, or\n\n442\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:55.050\nDell's vault, the backup product,\nwhatever that thing is that they have.\n\n443\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.372\nRight, cuz they're\nalways buying companies.\n\n444\n00:21:56.372 --> 00:21:58.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So\nevery week it's something new, right.\n\n445\n00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.770\nBut whatever it is, right, there's all\nthese things you got to think about.\n\n446\n00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.580\nAnd so I have a lot of these\nconversations with customers\n\n447\n00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.260\n&gt;&gt; And I spend a lot of time demoing and\n\n448\n00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.000\nhelping them work through the apples\nby apples or apples by oranges,\n\n449\n00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.130\npoint by point, or point by counterpoint.\n\n450\n00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.410\nComparisons about how this is gonna work.\n\n451\n00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:22.010\nAnd It's a very interesting\nperspective when you step outside and\n\n452\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.080\ndon't tie yourself to one stack but\n\n453\n00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.380\nrather look holistically across\nthe industry and the vertical.\n\n454\n00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.270\nAnd say, this is the best to breed and\nwhat do we get if we're running it.\n\n455\n00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.940\nAnd try as hard as you can.\n\n456\n00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.210\nI'm not saying Microsoft's the best\nat everything, far from it.\n\n457\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.710\nWe all, I think, would agree that\nthey have their strengths and\n\n458\n00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.010\nweaknesses like every other\ncompany in the world.\n\n459\n00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:46.020\nBut to be fair, and to be honest,\nabout what I see in the market,\n\n460\n00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.100\nwhat I see in the competitive landscape,\nis what customers ask me to do.\n\n461\n00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.610\nAnd I feel that it's important to do that.\n\n462\n00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.180\nAnd the product line stands up\n\n463\n00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.310\nreally well against just about\nanything out there today.\n\n464\n00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:59.400\nIt's a very impressive set of products.\n\n465\n00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.200\nThe system center integration that we're\ngonna be demoing some upcoming episodes.\n\n466\n00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.090\nThe ease of use, and I want you to\nlook for this and I want you to\n\n467\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.010\nthink about this while we're doing the\ndemos, about how we set up the connectors.\n\n468\n00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.060\nNow, I gotta make sure I can't\nscrew anything up during demos.\n\n469\n00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.550\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And if nothing works well,\n\n470\n00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.930\nwe gotta keep reshooting until\nit looks flawless, right?\n\n471\n00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:22.160\nBut you're gonna see as I do this that\nthese demos that are designed to show you,\n\n472\n00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.030\nhey lets integrate.\n\n473\n00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.750\nLets create that AD connector.\n\n474\n00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.930\nLets create that orchestrator connector.\n\n475\n00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.580\nIt's just very simple to do coming\nout of Service Level Manager.\n\n476\n00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.450\nAnd as a result of that, it is very\neasy to stand these products up and\n\n477\n00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:35.770\nto get them talking.\n\n478\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.170\nAnd I keep talking about this, and\nI keep stressing this in other episodes.\n\n479\n00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.220\nThe hard part's not configuring all\nthis stuff, and standing it up,\n\n480\n00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.520\nthe hard part is you figuring out\nhow to leverage the information, and\n\n481\n00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.360\ngenerate value in the enterprise.\n\n482\n00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.596\nBy using the product the right way.\n\n483\n00:23:48.596 --> 00:23:52.500\nAnd that's why making the investment\nin going through the material through\n\n484\n00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.168\nITProTV, and doing all of the other\nthings that all of you I'm sure do.\n\n485\n00:23:56.168 --> 00:24:00.167\nIn terms of providing sweat equity\nto invest in that betterment of\n\n486\n00:24:00.167 --> 00:24:05.110\nyour knowledge and growing yourself as\nan IT professional is so, so important,\n\n487\n00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:10.530\nfor not only you, and your organizations,\nbut over all for our industry.\n\n488\n00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:14.540\nMore people that do this, more people\nthat learn how to do it the right way,\n\n489\n00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.970\nthe quicker the knowledge spreads,\nand the easier it is for\n\n490\n00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:22.110\nus to say, yeah we know how to do that,\nand we can actually do it the right way.\n\n491\n00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.900\nAnd now we can add value\nin the organization.\n\n492\n00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.390\nIt's really, really important for\nus to be thinking about that.\n\n493\n00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:27.640\nAll right, so let's get back\nto what we were showing here,\n\n494\n00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.218\nthere's two more things.\n\n495\n00:24:28.218 --> 00:24:31.920\nThen we're going to go ahead, wrap up\nour conversation in this episode and\n\n496\n00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.655\nthen come back and\nactually do some demos for you.\n\n497\n00:24:34.655 --> 00:24:39.735\nIntegration packs, talked about these for\nSystem Center 2012 12R2 Orchestrator.\n\n498\n00:24:39.735 --> 00:24:43.765\nSo we see we do have a site here where\nwe can see the integration packs.\n\n499\n00:24:43.765 --> 00:24:45.865\nAgain, this may change over time.\n\n500\n00:24:45.865 --> 00:24:49.065\nYou're looking at this if you're\nwatching us live doing this, and\n\n501\n00:24:49.065 --> 00:24:50.895\nthat's the state of the union today.\n\n502\n00:24:50.895 --> 00:24:53.720\nYou watch this six months,\na year from now, right?\n\n503\n00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.170\nAnd there may be some new ones on\nthat webpage when you go see it.\n\n504\n00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:00.222\nSo just understand that while this is\na good accurate representation of what's\n\n505\n00:25:00.222 --> 00:25:03.134\navailable, we always encourage\nyou to go out to the web.\n\n506\n00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:06.310\nThat's why we take all the time to show\nyou where all these different pieces are,\n\n507\n00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.850\nand make sure you get the most\nup-to-date information.\n\n508\n00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.820\nSo if you're looking for that new\nintegration pack, that somebody told you\n\n509\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.470\nabout that you know is out there, and it's\nnot showing up on this page right now.\n\n510\n00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.270\nMake sure you go out and\nfind it cuz it's probably there.\n\n511\n00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.520\nIt just may not have been listed when we\nactually put this episode together, or\n\n512\n00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.220\nit may have been and\nwe just purposely kept it from you.\n\n513\n00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.399\nThat's the other option as well.\n\n514\n00:25:23.399 --> 00:25:26.809\nThat does happen cuz Daniel's got a list\nof people that are good and bad, and\n\n515\n00:25:26.809 --> 00:25:30.870\ndepending on who you are, we actually show\nyou a different vision of this episode.\n\n516\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:34.020\nSo if you're on the bad list, you're\ngetting nothing, just so you're clear,\n\n517\n00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.880\nso It's not just Santa Claus.\n\n518\n00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.509\n[CROSSTALK] We do, we do.\n\n519\n00:25:37.509 --> 00:25:41.834\nWhat was that movie,\nEagle Eye with Will Smith?\n\n520\n00:25:41.834 --> 00:25:44.008\nWas that the one,\nwith the satellite, remember?\n\n521\n00:25:44.008 --> 00:25:44.696\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was, no.\n\n522\n00:25:44.696 --> 00:25:45.565\n&gt;&gt; That wasn't Eagle Eye.\n\n523\n00:25:45.565 --> 00:25:46.348\nWhat the hell was it?\n\n524\n00:25:46.348 --> 00:25:51.880\n&gt;&gt; That was my goodness,\nI can see the, with Gene Hackman.\n\n525\n00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, he plays the, yeah,\n\n526\n00:25:53.264 --> 00:25:56.340\nhe's like the crazy guy who\nhelps them figure it all out.\n\n527\n00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.100\nWhatever it was, but you know what I'm\n\n528\n00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.135\ntalking about [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n529\n00:25:59.135 --> 00:26:01.924\n[CROSSTALK] Eagle Eye was\nthe movie with Shia Labeouf.\n\n530\n00:26:01.924 --> 00:26:02.504\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n531\n00:26:02.504 --> 00:26:03.338\n&gt;&gt; But it was the same idea.\n\n532\n00:26:03.338 --> 00:26:04.766\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Not sets them up, but\n\n533\n00:26:04.766 --> 00:26:05.577\ngives him the information.\n\n534\n00:26:05.577 --> 00:26:06.947\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n535\n00:26:06.947 --> 00:26:08.278\n&gt;&gt; And then they're coming\nto the bad guys [CROSSTALK].\n\n536\n00:26:08.278 --> 00:26:10.108\nIt was actually pretty cool.\n\n537\n00:26:10.108 --> 00:26:14.185\nYeah, Gene Hackman plays\nthe kind of crazy,\n\n538\n00:26:14.185 --> 00:26:15.184\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n539\n00:26:15.184 --> 00:26:18.961\n&gt;&gt; Off kilter satellite guy who\nultimately helps him out [CROSSTALK].\n\n540\n00:26:18.961 --> 00:26:19.623\nYeah.\n\n541\n00:26:19.623 --> 00:26:21.286\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He was a good character.\n\n542\n00:26:21.286 --> 00:26:21.908\n&gt;&gt; He was great.\n\n543\n00:26:21.908 --> 00:26:25.303\n&gt;&gt; Almost like in Red,\nthe John Malkovich character.\n\n544\n00:26:25.303 --> 00:26:26.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love that character.\n\n545\n00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.144\nHe was [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I love those movies.\n\n546\n00:26:27.144 --> 00:26:29.052\nTalk about a sequel that did well.\n\n547\n00:26:29.052 --> 00:26:29.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n548\n00:26:29.796 --> 00:26:31.919\n&gt;&gt; I mean that they really took it up\na notch, not only got it right, but\n\n549\n00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:32.867\nreally hit it out of the park?\n\n550\n00:26:32.867 --> 00:26:35.678\n&gt;&gt; You smell like Washington.\n\n551\n00:26:35.678 --> 00:26:38.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Great set of movies,\n\n552\n00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.460\ngreat set of movies.\n\n553\n00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.650\nAll right so,\nSystem Center 2012 Ops Manager activities.\n\n554\n00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.550\nLast item that we have\non our hit list here.\n\n555\n00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:48.220\nSo we talked about the activities,\nran through the list.\n\n556\n00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.841\nThings like create alerts, get alerts, get\nmonitor, monitor alert, alert alert alert,\n\n557\n00:26:52.841 --> 00:26:54.570\nmore alerts, alert alert alert.\n\n558\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.213\nYou remember like-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n559\n00:26:56.213 --> 00:26:58.353\n&gt;&gt; You ever see those the Charlie Brown\n\n560\n00:26:58.353 --> 00:26:59.078\ncartoons?\n\n561\n00:26:59.078 --> 00:26:59.624\nJust remember like.\n\n562\n00:26:59.624 --> 00:27:00.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Charlie Brown Christmas.\n\n563\n00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.850\nCharlie Brown Thanksgiving.\n\n564\n00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.574\nAnd they would show the teacher and the\nteacher like wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.\n\n565\n00:27:04.574 --> 00:27:07.630\nAnd all you hear is just the random\nnoise in the background.\n\n566\n00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:08.860\nKind of like that with alerts.\n\n567\n00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.433\nWe have all these different activities.\n\n568\n00:27:10.433 --> 00:27:12.063\nWe have them listed here.\n\n569\n00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:14.570\nIt talks a bit about them.\n\n570\n00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.590\nExplains what they are, what\nthe different behavioral elements are,\n\n571\n00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.313\nwhere you find them, publishing data.\n\n572\n00:27:19.313 --> 00:27:21.280\nAnd then all the stuff down here.\n\n573\n00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.790\nThese are all the different\nalerts I was just talking about.\n\n574\n00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.670\nSo if you need to go in,\nsee a little bit more about that.\n\n575\n00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.885\nWe've talked a lot about\nthese activities already.\n\n576\n00:27:28.885 --> 00:27:31.464\nWe've been in and\nout of Ops Manager and the Ops console,\n\n577\n00:27:31.464 --> 00:27:35.090\neven into the web console by this point in\nour arc of all the episodes in the show.\n\n578\n00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.654\nWe've done quite a bit with these,\nyou've seen me go through and interact and\n\n579\n00:27:38.654 --> 00:27:40.635\ntalk around almost every one of them.\n\n580\n00:27:40.635 --> 00:27:43.965\nBut if just in case you need a reminder,\nor if you're jumping in here,\n\n581\n00:27:43.965 --> 00:27:47.265\ncuz maybe this particular piece was\nthe one you wanted to see first,\n\n582\n00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:49.775\nyou haven't seen some of those other\nepisodes, go back and take a look.\n\n583\n00:27:49.775 --> 00:27:53.180\nBut we've gone through these activities,\nshowed you them, talk about them, put them\n\n584\n00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:58.140\ninto the context of the console for you,\nand showing you how they're gonna be used.\n\n585\n00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.830\nSo just wanna point them out\nto you here so you see them.\n\n586\n00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.790\nYou know they're there, we've got all\nthese URL's for you in the show notes.\n\n587\n00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.508\nSo obviously you can go back\ntake a look at these websites,\n\n588\n00:28:06.508 --> 00:28:09.181\nmake sure you interact with\nthis information if needed.\n\n589\n00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:12.139\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna show you how to put this to\n\n590\n00:28:12.139 --> 00:28:14.460\npractical use by doing\nsome demonstrations.\n\n591\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.736\nWhen you come back and join us, cuz right\nnow Daniel's about to say that we are just\n\n592\n00:28:17.736 --> 00:28:19.199\nabout-\n&gt;&gt; Out of time.\n\n593\n00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:20.322\n&gt;&gt; There you go, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n594\n00:28:20.322 --> 00:28:23.130\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that clock, it does tick\naway, even though we don't want it to.\n\n595\n00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.800\nWe want to continue\ntalking about cool stuff,\n\n596\n00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.035\nand at this point I'm ready\nto go buy SCOM right now.\n\n597\n00:28:28.035 --> 00:28:29.948\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Adam has talked it up quite\n\n598\n00:28:29.948 --> 00:28:31.598\na good game, so-\n&gt;&gt; That would be cool-\n\n599\n00:28:31.598 --> 00:28:33.185\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n600\n00:28:33.185 --> 00:28:34.244\n&gt;&gt; A cool event instead of like\n\n601\n00:28:34.244 --> 00:28:35.590\na whetstone,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n602\n00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.416\n&gt;&gt; You could do SCOM,\nI'm going to move over here.\n\n603\n00:28:37.416 --> 00:28:38.951\n[CROSSTALK] Center on right there.\n\n604\n00:28:38.951 --> 00:28:40.155\n&gt;&gt; Japanese water stones.\n\n605\n00:28:40.155 --> 00:28:42.609\n&gt;&gt; A water stone, did I say whetstone,\nI meant water stone.\n\n606\n00:28:42.609 --> 00:28:45.048\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; All right so that being said,\n\n607\n00:28:45.048 --> 00:28:46.727\nAdam is correct we're out of time for\n\n608\n00:28:46.727 --> 00:28:50.034\nthis episode I am really looking\nforward to the demonstrations though,\n\n609\n00:28:50.034 --> 00:28:53.740\nhopefully you are as well, and\nwe'll see you in those shows, per say.\n\n610\n00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.660\nAs for this one though,\nit looks like we've come to the end.\n\n611\n00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.740\nSo thank you for watching.\n\n612\n00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.453\n&gt;&gt; Don't say it.\nDon't say it.\n\n613\n00:28:57.453 --> 00:28:59.030\n&gt;&gt; It

00:00:08.206\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:12.284\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.284 --> 00:00:13.016\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n6\n00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:17.130\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.040\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, that's right.\n\n8\n00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.350\nWe're back with more of our datacenter\nmonitoring with Microsoft SCOM, or\n\n9\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.030\nSCOM, or System Center Operations Manager,\nor however you like it,\n\n10\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.720\nas long as we're talking\nabout the same thing.\n\n11\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.660\nAnd here to talk about the same thing,\nour good friend, Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.450\nAdam, welcome back man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.030\n&gt;&gt; Good, you left out SC OM.\n\n14\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.213\n&gt;&gt; SC OM.\n&gt;&gt; SC OM.\n\n15\n00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:39.127\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like you're skipping\n\n16\n00:00:39.127 --> 00:00:40.250\nacross the lake there.\n\n17\n00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.540\nAll right, so\nwe are back to talk more about it.\n\n18\n00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.090\nAnd you know what?\n\n19\n00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.210\nWe're not only gonna talk about it,\nwe are gonna actually do it,\n\n20\n00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.570\ncuz at ITPRO.TV, we do it live.\n\n21\n00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.606\nAnd we're about to do so right now.\n\n22\n00:00:50.606 --> 00:00:54.815\nWhat we're gonna do is create an alert\nconnector through service level manager,\n\n23\n00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:58.380\nall so that we can actually\nconnect back to SC OM, or\n\n24\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.470\nany of those other versions of the product\nDaniel just reeled off for us.\n\n25\n00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.030\nIt'd be great if while I'm\ndoing this you're just there in\n\n26\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.790\nthe background-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.870\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like chanting-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.190\n&gt;&gt; Doing all those different versions.\n\n29\n00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.590\nThat would be cool, right?\n\n30\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.953\nWe'd have a soundtrack.\n\n31\n00:01:08.953 --> 00:01:12.161\nSo we're going to go ahead and we're\ngoing to show you how to do this now,\n\n32\n00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:14.844\nlive, we're gonna create\nan alert connector out of service\n\n33\n00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:17.070\nlevel manager going back\ninto the SCOM products.\n\n34\n00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.110\nThat way we can start to see the traffic\nflow that we were talking about\n\n35\n00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.870\nin the other episode, where we went\nthrough all the integration pieces, and\n\n36\n00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.850\ntalked about how we're gonna do it.\n\n37\n00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.120\nNow we're actually gonna\nshow you how to do it.\n\n38\n00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.670\nSo if you join me right over here, or\n\n39\n00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.155\nright over somewhere in this general\nvicinity, up there somewhere.\n\n40\n00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:34.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go take a look and\n\n41\n00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.340\nsee how to do this.\n\n42\n00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.470\nSo I have this service level\nmanager console open here.\n\n43\n00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.310\nI've just gone ahead and\nopened up the product.\n\n44\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.540\nI've got the administration workspace\nselected underneath Administration.\n\n45\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.880\nI have my connector area selected.\n\n46\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.070\nNo connectors there currently,\nwhich is the default way you'll see this\n\n47\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.770\nproduct installed and\nconfigured out of the box.\n\n48\n00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.520\nWe always have the option\nof right clicking and\n\n49\n00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.300\ngetting our menu to be able to engage\nthe activity we would like to use.\n\n50\n00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.170\nWe do have, as you've seen, in SCOM and\nin all the other areas in System Center.\n\n51\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.427\nHave the nav bar off to the right there,\n\n52\n00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:10.860\nthe workspace where we can\nchoose our tasks, our actions.\n\n53\n00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.240\nThey're called different things depending\non what product we're using and\n\n54\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.020\nwhat we're doing.\n\n55\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.260\nBut the same exact thing\nis sitting over here.\n\n56\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.995\nConnectors, create a connector.\n\n57\n00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:19.665\nClick on that little pop-out menu,\n\n58\n00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:22.385\nyou've got the same exact menu,\nopen it up over there.\n\n59\n00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:24.625\nSo we've got our list of connectors.\n\n60\n00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:28.275\nWe've got our active directory\nintegration connector, our SCCM,\n\n61\n00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:30.775\nSystem Center Config Manager Connector,\n\n62\n00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.685\nour ops manager alert connector which is\none we're gonna use here in just a second.\n\n63\n00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:35.695\nYou'll see it right there.\n\n64\n00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:36.995\nI'm just pointing to it.\n\n65\n00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:38.495\nWe've got our CI connector,\n\n66\n00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:42.090\nour configuration item connector\nout to the ops manager.\n\n67\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.940\nAnd then we've got our ocastrator,\nand our virtual machine connector.\n\n68\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.461\nSo we've been through\nall these connectors,\n\n69\n00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:47.908\ntalked about what they are, how they work.\n\n70\n00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:52.771\nWhat I wanted to show you here real quick,\njust before we do the actual connector and\n\n71\n00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.342\nselect it,\nis you know we have two options,\n\n72\n00:02:55.342 --> 00:03:00.160\nwe can create the connector as you saw,\nwe also have Import from CSV File.\n\n73\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.870\nIf we choose the Import from CSV File\noption, let me just center this so\n\n74\n00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.180\nyou can see it a little bit easier,\nspring that over here, and\n\n75\n00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.400\nwhat you'll see is that we can import\nthe connector from a CSV file.\n\n76\n00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.602\nThis is not a connector tip,\n\n77\n00:03:13.602 --> 00:03:16.200\n[INAUDIBLE] when you're dong bulk\nimports is when you would do this.\n\n78\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.850\nYou wanna bring in those connectors\nall at once or other connectors,\n\n79\n00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.030\ncuz you may have other connectors from\nother products that you're gonna use.\n\n80\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.010\nHowever you do this,\nwhen we wanna bring in the connectors,\n\n81\n00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.700\nplural, we need two files.\n\n82\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.570\nWe need the XML format file and\nwe need the data file.\n\n83\n00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.115\nAnd there's a little blurb\nabout the fact we need both.\n\n84\n00:03:33.115 --> 00:03:35.555\nAnd then we would browse,\nfind the appropriate files, and\n\n85\n00:03:35.555 --> 00:03:36.615\njust do a bulk import.\n\n86\n00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.625\nSo we could do that if we're interested.\n\n87\n00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:40.325\nWe're not gonna bother going through that.\n\n88\n00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:41.255\nYou get the general idea,\n\n89\n00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:44.885\nwe're just gonna import a single\nconnector in this particular episode.\n\n90\n00:03:44.885 --> 00:03:48.395\nSo we're gonna right click here,\nwe're gonna do create a connector.\n\n91\n00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.715\nWe'll do our alert connector.\n\n92\n00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:54.830\nWe'll grab that, once we've chosen that,\nwe get our wizard here.\n\n93\n00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.410\nAgain, let's just move this\nover just a little bit, so\n\n94\n00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.510\nwe can see that a little bit easier.\n\n95\n00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.380\nAnd we've got our Create a New Connector.\n\n96\n00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.040\nAnd we got some things on the left here\nwe're gonna have to walk through screen\n\n97\n00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.990\nby screen.\n\n98\n00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.360\nKind of get this done.\n\n99\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.630\nThe wizard helps us to get his up and\nrunning.\n\n100\n00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.140\nIf you're one of those people who\ndoesn't like the overview screen,\n\n101\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.630\njust check that off there, we'll get\nrid of that so we don't see it again.\n\n102\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.100\nThen click Next.\n\n103\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.140\nWe've gotta enter a name and\na description for our connector.\n\n104\n00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.850\nSo keep in mind you probably\nhave a naming convention for\n\n105\n00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.920\nyour connectors in the organization,\nfollow that.\n\n106\n00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.850\nWe're just gonna use a simple one here,\nwe'll call it OM for Ops Manager alert\n\n107\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.320\nconnector, that way when we look at\nthem in the management console there,\n\n108\n00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.100\nwe can begin to see what each one does and\nwe're not gonna be confused by that.\n\n109\n00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.250\nSo I'll have that if you wanna\ndo the description, feel free,\n\n110\n00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.660\nI'll just copy and paste here.\n\n111\n00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.979\nBecause, Hold on one second, there we go,\n\n112\n00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.590\nbecause I'm not going to go ahead and\ntype that out twice.\n\n113\n00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.930\nJust wanna call out and\npoint out the fact,\n\n114\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.550\nright down here circling around it,\nthe connector will be enabled by default.\n\n115\n00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.290\nWe can turn that off if\nwe're not interested\n\n116\n00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.110\nin having the connector available but\nrather, just simply configured.\n\n117\n00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.620\nYeah, if you're setting up everything,\n\n118\n00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.300\ndoing the build-out,\nyou're going through the checklist.\n\n119\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.860\nYou don't wanna turn things on yet.\n\n120\n00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.810\nYou just wanna start to\nstand the product up.\n\n121\n00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.730\nYou may wanna disable a connector.\n\n122\n00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.980\nIn production, there may be reasons why\nyou have to disable a connector while\n\n123\n00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.040\nyou're doing maintenance,\nthings like that.\n\n124\n00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.540\nOne system's going down.\n\n125\n00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.280\nYou don't want data being cached or coming\nin, so you may turn the connector off for\n\n126\n00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.870\na period of time.\n\n127\n00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.895\nSo there are some reasons why\na connector may have to be disabled.\n\n128\n00:05:31.895 --> 00:05:34.615\nWe're gonna ensure it's enabled,\ncuz obviously we wanna hook this up and\n\n129\n00:05:34.615 --> 00:05:35.545\nhave it working.\n\n130\n00:05:35.545 --> 00:05:36.965\nSo we'll click Next there.\n\n131\n00:05:36.965 --> 00:05:41.115\nWe then have to specify the server name\nthat we're gonna connect out with.\n\n132\n00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:45.476\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nspecify here plabsys01,\n\n133\n00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:49.016\nthat's the name of our\nsever that we're on.\n\n134\n00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:51.464\nThis is the server that\nhosts the ops manager and so\n\n135\n00:05:51.464 --> 00:05:53.820\nthat's why we're gonna specify it there.\n\n136\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.090\nRemember this is what we\nare going to be connecting to for\n\n137\n00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.970\nthe ops manager server,\nalong with the route credential or\n\n138\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.535\nthe credential that allows\nus to connect successfully.\n\n139\n00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:07.115\nSo we're gonna specify here whether\nit's our run as account and or\n\n140\n00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:09.865\nwhether we're going to use\na domain account of some kind.\n\n141\n00:06:09.865 --> 00:06:13.458\nWe've been through all these different\naccounts in many of our prior episodes.\n\n142\n00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:16.502\nWe've talked about before different\naccount types that are necessary when you\n\n143\n00:06:16.502 --> 00:06:19.452\ninstall SCOM,\nthe run as account was one of them.\n\n144\n00:06:19.452 --> 00:06:21.852\nWe have our data reader,\nour data writer account.\n\n145\n00:06:21.852 --> 00:06:23.182\nSo we have different accounts.\n\n146\n00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:26.722\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna specify here that, or\n\n147\n00:06:26.722 --> 00:06:30.742\nrather the operational database account\nis what we're gonna use, I should say.\n\n148\n00:06:30.742 --> 00:06:33.432\nBut we're gonna specify whatever\nrun as account we would like.\n\n149\n00:06:33.432 --> 00:06:36.462\nNotice when you pull down,\nthere really is no other option here\n\n150\n00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:39.840\nif we're gonna use the default one,\nthat's the one we use.\n\n151\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.400\nIf not, we'll create a new one.\n\n152\n00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.820\nWe do wanna take advantage of this.\n\n153\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.250\nLet's test that connection.\n\n154\n00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.150\nWe always specify.\n\n155\n00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.990\nIt's a good idea to do this, so\nwe wanna go ahead and do the test there.\n\n156\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.060\nI know it's kinda hard to see because it's\nkinda at the bottom of the window, but\n\n157\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.860\nif I go fullscreen,\nyou'll see domain here.\n\n158\n00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.520\nLet me just do this real quick.\n\n159\n00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.630\nSee if I can get that to blow up for you.\n\n160\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.680\nIt's not going to let me expand that.\n\n161\n00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.280\nBut we do have our domain down there.\n\n162\n00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.750\nIt's just very hard to see.\n\n163\n00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.910\nThat's the play, the play labs.\n\n164\n00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.049\nThat's the practice labs domain.\n\n165\n00:07:10.049 --> 00:07:11.929\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is kind of like playing.\n\n166\n00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:13.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're playing around, right.\n\n167\n00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.320\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of fun.\n\n168\n00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.350\nSo, you'll see I tested it.\n\n169\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.880\nReal simple right, comes back.\n\n170\n00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.570\nEverything is good.\n\n171\n00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.280\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gona click okay on that.\n\n172\n00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.790\nAnd then what we're gonna do\nis we're going to go ahead,\n\n173\n00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.960\nclick OK twice because the first\ntime is really just for show.\n\n174\n00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.890\nIt doesn't really\nregister when we do that.\n\n175\n00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.920\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n176\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.800\n&gt;&gt; Like a practice swing.\n\n177\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.520\n&gt;&gt; It is kinda like that, right.\n\n178\n00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.360\nSo now what we need to do Is we need\nto specify the routing rules for\n\n179\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.090\nincoming alerts.\n\n180\n00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.250\nThis is where it starts\nto get interesting.\n\n181\n00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.010\nSo what we're doing here is\nwe're gonna add in a rule, and\n\n182\n00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.940\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate one here for you in a minute.\n\n183\n00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.710\nWe'll click Add, that's gonna tell us how\nto deal with alerts when they start coming\n\n184\n00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.040\nin across the connector.\n\n185\n00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.260\nHow, in other words,\ndo we wanna manage the flow of traffic?\n\n186\n00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.817\nIf we don't do this now, we can obviously\ngo in and do this after the fact.\n\n187\n00:07:55.817 --> 00:07:59.023\nBut the connector's not gonna be able\nto deal with anything until we actually\n\n188\n00:07:59.023 --> 00:08:01.606\nspecify, hey, we're getting it\nfrom here when it comes in.\n\n189\n00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.281\nWe want you to do this with it.\n\n190\n00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:07.541\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna add, click Add here.\n\n191\n00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:11.445\nAnd let's see if we can just\nbring this over far enough so\n\n192\n00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:13.867\nyou can see what's going on here.\n\n193\n00:08:13.867 --> 00:08:15.563\nI'll drag this up just a wee bit.\n\n194\n00:08:15.563 --> 00:08:17.378\nAll right, so\nwe could see the bottom there.\n\n195\n00:08:17.378 --> 00:08:19.172\nImportant for\nus to be able to tell what's going on.\n\n196\n00:08:19.172 --> 00:08:21.232\nCould we go full screen just to see\nthe detail on this a little bit?\n\n197\n00:08:21.232 --> 00:08:24.400\nIt will be, I think, better for\nyou if you could see what we're doing.\n\n198\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.188\nSo we're using the add alert routing\nrule dialog box to program in the rule.\n\n199\n00:08:30.188 --> 00:08:32.920\nWhat we're gonna do is,\nwe'll go ahead and give it a name.\n\n200\n00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.229\nSo we'll specify, again,\ngeneric name here, alert rule.\n\n201\n00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:37.191\nIn the real world,\n\n202\n00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:41.293\nyou'll give this hopefully a little bit\nmore interesting and meaningful name.\n\n203\n00:08:41.293 --> 00:08:44.088\nMaybe database alerts or\nmaybe web server alerts or\n\n204\n00:08:44.088 --> 00:08:47.085\nsomething that tells you\nexactly what you're doing.\n\n205\n00:08:47.085 --> 00:08:48.373\nBut you get the idea here.\n\n206\n00:08:48.373 --> 00:08:54.150\nWe then have to specify that we are going\nto go in under Template right here,\n\n207\n00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.737\nand choose what kind of\ntemplate we wanna use.\n\n208\n00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:00.145\nAnd there's quite a list\nof them as you can see.\n\n209\n00:09:00.145 --> 00:09:03.840\nWe're gonna be doing\nOperation Manager Incidents.\n\n210\n00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.050\nBecause we're pulling this\ndata in from the ops manager.\n\n211\n00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.590\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna specify this.\n\n212\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.120\nSo let me just scroll down so\nyou could see the bottom list here.\n\n213\n00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.770\nAnd you'll see that, yeah, we have\nthings like Software Issue Incident,\n\n214\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.230\nGeneric Incident, Hardware Incident.\n\n215\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.770\nBut if we use ops manager,\nthen this changes a little bit,\n\n216\n00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.803\nthe rest of the screen down here.\n\n217\n00:09:23.803 --> 00:09:26.601\nAnd let me show you that by\nchoosing a different one.\n\n218\n00:09:26.601 --> 00:09:30.608\nAnd you'll see that the criteria may\nchange depending on what we're choosing\n\n219\n00:09:30.608 --> 00:09:33.690\nand some of the things will or\nwill not stay the same.\n\n220\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.900\nWe have a generic incident request.\n\n221\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.190\nDifferent things may pop in.\n\n222\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.610\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna choose Ops Manager Incident.\n\n223\n00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:45.340\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nwe have to deal with the criteria type.\n\n224\n00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.432\nSo select criteria type.\n\n225\n00:09:46.432 --> 00:09:49.876\nWe're gonna use, in this case,\ncomputer for which the alert was raised.\n\n226\n00:09:49.876 --> 00:09:53.927\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do the middle\noption, right here, computer for\n\n227\n00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.660\nwhich the alert was raised.\n\n228\n00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.170\nWe could do Ops Manager Management Pack,\nthat has the monitoring or\n\n229\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.950\nis raising the monitoring alert.\n\n230\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.768\nSo we could choose that,\nchoose the Management Pack name.\n\n231\n00:10:03.768 --> 00:10:04.797\nSo we could if we wanted to.\n\n232\n00:10:04.797 --> 00:10:07.520\nLet me just gonna click here real quick so\nyou could see this.\n\n233\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.196\nWe could say Management Pack equals,\nor contains, either one.\n\n234\n00:10:11.196 --> 00:10:13.440\nSo we could do a match,\nright, a string match.\n\n235\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.681\nContains we could specify database and\nthen all the management packs,\n\n236\n00:10:17.681 --> 00:10:18.817\nthat kinda thing.\n\n237\n00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:22.349\nOr equals Microsoft Core Library or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n238\n00:10:22.349 --> 00:10:24.650\nAnd then we'd be able to specify that.\n\n239\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.880\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose computer for\n\n240\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.850\nwhich the alert was raised.\n\n241\n00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.820\nAnd it says computer's a member of group.\n\n242\n00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.571\nAnd we have to choose\nthe Global Operations Group here.\n\n243\n00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:38.597\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that or\nGlobal Operators Group, I should say.\n\n244\n00:10:38.597 --> 00:10:41.536\nAnd then we'll be able to say,\nif it's a member of that group,\n\n245\n00:10:41.536 --> 00:10:44.250\nthen the alert should\nbe dealt with this way.\n\n246\n00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.930\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to do severity and\n\n247\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:48.830\npriority down here.\n\n248\n00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.240\nNotice before we get there,\nnotice we also could do custom field.\n\n249\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.461\nWe could actually program in, if we\nwanted to, custom field equal to, and\n\n250\n00:10:56.461 --> 00:10:58.208\nthen again, specify a value.\n\n251\n00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:00.519\nAnd or Ops Manager class.\n\n252\n00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:02.582\nWe had ops manager management pack.\n\n253\n00:11:02.582 --> 00:11:04.826\nWe could also do ops manager class.\n\n254\n00:11:04.826 --> 00:11:06.630\nMonitoring class name equal to.\n\n255\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.471\nIf you remember in the episode\nthat we did, or episodes we did,\n\n256\n00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:15.416\naround custom management pack creation,\nwe talked about objects and classes.\n\n257\n00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:19.661\nWe talked about the base class,\nwe talked about the different class types.\n\n258\n00:11:19.661 --> 00:11:21.476\nWe talked about the singleton class,\n\n259\n00:11:21.476 --> 00:11:23.979\nwe talked about the dependencies\nbetween classes.\n\n260\n00:11:23.979 --> 00:11:29.243\nAnd we talked about the fact that we have\nto understand the logic of object and\n\n261\n00:11:29.243 --> 00:11:29.829\nclass.\n\n262\n00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:34.414\nand the classes are really built around\nthe idea of the Windows class model,\n\n263\n00:11:34.414 --> 00:11:38.580\nthe development model we used to\ndevelop the Windows architecture.\n\n264\n00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.741\nAnd so, the Win32, Windows Server '12,\nthose kinda things,\n\n265\n00:11:42.741 --> 00:11:44.698\nwe're building on that logic.\n\n266\n00:11:44.698 --> 00:11:48.070\nAnd so we could specify the name\nof a monitoring class here.\n\n267\n00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.930\nAnd run alerts against the class.\n\n268\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.540\nSo we have a lot of different flexibility.\n\n269\n00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.190\nA lot of options on these connectors.\n\n270\n00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.600\nAnd this is where it can\nbe very interesting and\n\n271\n00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.100\nallows us to be very flexible\nabout how we approach this.\n\n272\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.842\nBut if we're not really paying attention,\nwe get ourselves into trouble.\n\n273\n00:12:02.842 --> 00:12:04.924\nBecause we don't set up\nthe connector the right way.\n\n274\n00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:06.367\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're not obviously gonna get\n\n275\n00:12:06.367 --> 00:12:07.050\nthe value out of it.\n\n276\n00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.370\nSo I wanna show that to you.\n\n277\n00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.359\nWe're gonna go back up here.\n\n278\n00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:14.917\nWe're gonna specify computer for which\nthe alert was generated or was raised.\n\n279\n00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:16.586\nAnd then we're gonna come down here.\n\n280\n00:12:16.586 --> 00:12:19.114\nJust see if I can just raise\nthis up just a little bit more.\n\n281\n00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:21.703\nAnd we're gonna do select\nalert severity and priority.\n\n282\n00:12:21.703 --> 00:12:23.790\nIt's kinda down at the bottom,\nit's a little bit hard to see.\n\n283\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.400\nBut we're gonna go in,\nand we're gonna do that.\n\n284\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.604\nAnd we're gonna do priority, we'll\ncheck this off first, and we have Low.\n\n285\n00:12:29.604 --> 00:12:32.320\nAnd I know it's hard to see,\nbut we do Low, Medium, High.\n\n286\n00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.890\nWe'll just go ahead and\nwe'll do Low priority.\n\n287\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.090\nAnd then for severity,\nwe'll go ahead, we'll go in, again,\n\n288\n00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.920\nwe have different options here,\ninformation, warning and critical.\n\n289\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.670\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do warning.\n\n290\n00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.330\nSo, we'll program those in.\n\n291\n00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.120\nWe're then go ahead, gonna click OK, and\n\n292\n00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:53.600\nwe've got our alert routing rule.\n\n293\n00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.320\nAnd we could stack up a series\nof rules here if we wanted to.\n\n294\n00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.680\nYou'll see that we can do this.\n\n295\n00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.010\nIf we add in another one, we'll then have\nthe option to move them up and down and\n\n296\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.270\nhave them centrally processed\nin the appropriate order.\n\n297\n00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.310\nAlerts that do not fit any of the rules\nabove will be routed through the following\n\n298\n00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.070\ntemplate.\n\n299\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.800\nThe default ops manager incident template\nis the template that'll pick up these\n\n300\n00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.970\nalerts because they're\ncoming from ops manager.\n\n301\n00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.150\nWhat the rules really allow us to\ndo by binding to the template and\n\n302\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:26.060\nspecifying behavior, is specifying\na certain activity and a certain flow for\n\n303\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.210\nthat activity based on a criteria match.\n\n304\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.214\nOtherwise, we have a capture wall,\nmuch like a firewall.\n\n305\n00:13:31.214 --> 00:13:35.458\nBlock all or something like that,\nwhen we don't have anything else to do.\n\n306\n00:13:35.458 --> 00:13:40.385\nWe'll go through and use the ops manager\nincident template as programmed to deal\n\n307\n00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:44.490\nwith anything that's not already\nsetup with a rule up above.\n\n308\n00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.340\nAnd it's first past the post in\nterms of a match here, right?\n\n309\n00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.648\nSo once we hit a rule that matches\nto either one or multiple rules,\n\n310\n00:13:50.648 --> 00:13:52.523\nwhatever it is, we filter through.\n\n311\n00:13:52.523 --> 00:13:56.273\nWe find the rule that matches the criteria\nbased on the alert coming in.\n\n312\n00:13:56.273 --> 00:13:58.040\nAnd that's the one we apply.\n\n313\n00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.110\nSo as soon as we hit a match,\nwe go forward.\n\n314\n00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:04.530\nIf we don't, we fall into the catch-all\nbucket at the bottom with the ops manager\n\n315\n00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.060\nincident template, right?\n\n316\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.520\nIf we have to go in and\nsay, you know what,\n\n317\n00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.040\nI need to make a change to that,\nJust highlight it, edit it.\n\n318\n00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.920\nHey, I didn't really mean to do that,\nhighlight it and remove, right?\n\n319\n00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.590\nSo we've got all the tools\nright here to do what we need.\n\n320\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.440\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n321\n00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.949\nWe now have to create a schedule,\npoll for alerts every so many seconds.\n\n322\n00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:25.295\nHow often is the connector\nconnecting out and saying, hey,\n\n323\n00:14:25.295 --> 00:14:26.404\ndo you have anything for me?\n\n324\n00:14:26.404 --> 00:14:27.618\nKinda like, are we there yet, right?\n\n325\n00:14:27.618 --> 00:14:29.547\nAre we there yet, are we there yet,\nare we there yet, right?\n\n326\n00:14:29.547 --> 00:14:32.220\nSo how often do we wanna check on that?\n\n327\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.620\nWe've got it set to 30 seconds by default.\n\n328\n00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.180\nNo big deal, we can leave that.\n\n329\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:41.060\nWe'll do 60 seconds, once a minute,\nprobably good in most organizations.\n\n330\n00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.050\nDon't really have a lot\nof concerns about that.\n\n331\n00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:46.945\nThen close alerts and Ops Manager when\nincidents are resolved or closed.\n\n332\n00:14:46.945 --> 00:14:50.780\nSo I've talked about it in several\nother episodes, the interaction and\n\n333\n00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.160\nthe connectivity here and the\ncommunication flow that's bidirectional\n\n334\n00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.530\nbetween these products as we\nstart setting up connectors.\n\n335\n00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:01.640\nDo we wanna have ops manager alerts\nclosed our when they're resolved or\n\n336\n00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.440\ndealt with here in service level manager?\n\n337\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.532\nThe answer is most likely yes cuz this\nis what we're paying all the big money\n\n338\n00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:07.133\nfor, right?\n\n339\n00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:09.151\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Wanna be able to manage it here,\n\n340\n00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:13.610\ndeal with it here, address it here through\nour escalation pathway for our SLAs.\n\n341\n00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.184\nAnd then say, hey,\nby the way, we did that.\n\n342\n00:15:15.184 --> 00:15:18.213\nGo ahead and just take care of that,\nclose it out for me in ops manager.\n\n343\n00:15:18.213 --> 00:15:21.520\nSo we don't have to go chase it in\nthe console and specify it later.\n\n344\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.320\nIf you, then,\nare smart about this, you do this,\n\n345\n00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.850\nyour alerts automatically get generated\nthrough monitoring on the scom side.\n\n346\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.320\nAutomatically get communicated\nacross the connector,\n\n347\n00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.540\nare dealt with here in\nservice level manager.\n\n348\n00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:37.271\nAnd then automatically we close the circle\nof life, except it's the circle of alerts.\n\n349\n00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:38.752\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we actually go back and\n\n350\n00:15:38.752 --> 00:15:41.975\nwe close out the alert on the SCOM side,\nwhich is great, right?\n\n351\n00:15:41.975 --> 00:15:44.500\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna check that off.\n\n352\n00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.200\nAnd resolve incidents automatically when\nthe alerts in the ops manager are closed.\n\n353\n00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.674\nIf we close an alert in ops manager,\nmake sure then we resolve the alert and\n\n354\n00:15:52.674 --> 00:15:55.936\nautomatically resolve it\nin service level manager.\n\n355\n00:15:55.936 --> 00:15:59.750\nBidirectional, we're essentially dealing\nwith it and saying, on either side,\n\n356\n00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.281\nonce we do one, alert the other.\n\n357\n00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:05.136\nSo we're not wasting our time chasing\nit when it's already been dealt with.\n\n358\n00:16:05.136 --> 00:16:08.364\nAnd, in addition,\nwe don't have orphaned, or\n\n359\n00:16:08.364 --> 00:16:13.720\nghost activities that are left in the data\nbase, and are left in the console.\n\n360\n00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.230\nAnd somebody looks at it in six months,\nand goes,\n\n361\n00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.852\nhey, why is that alert still open for\nthat Raid Ray failure?\n\n362\n00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:19.480\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n363\n00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.320\n&gt;&gt; What's going on with that?\n\n364\n00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.270\nWe've been out of storage for six months.\n\n365\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.580\nNo, no, that's all working fine.\n\n366\n00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.490\nIt's just somebody forgot to go back and\nactually close it out.\n\n367\n00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:30.810\nWe used to see this a lot when this\nwas a very person intensive process,\n\n368\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.410\nespecially with help desk tickets,\nor service desk tickets.\n\n369\n00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.160\nWhere tickets would get orphaned, because\npeople would just forget to go in and\n\n370\n00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.200\nclose them out.\n\n371\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.810\nAnd, so this is gonna help us\nto eliminate some of that, and\n\n372\n00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.430\nthis is the reason why\nwe're gonna check that off.\n\n373\n00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.320\nSo, we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna check this off as well and\n\n374\n00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.140\ngo ahead and do this.\n\n375\n00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.389\nHit next.\n\n376\n00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:48.300\nWe've got our little summary here.\n\n377\n00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.630\nTells us what we're doing.\n\n378\n00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.660\nAlways good is we talked about to\npay attention to the summary page,\n\n379\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.020\nmake sure we know what's happening.\n\n380\n00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.750\nSo, we're gonna go ahead, and\njust make sure we have a read on that.\n\n381\n00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.140\nWe'll click Create.\n\n382\n00:16:59.140 --> 00:16:59.770\nGive that a moment.\n\n383\n00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.727\nDoesn't take very long.\n\n384\n00:17:00.727 --> 00:17:01.979\nWe'll just wait for that, and\n\n385\n00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:05.510\nwe'll see the little connector will\nbe displayed here in just a moment.\n\n386\n00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.420\nWe'll see we're done.\n\n387\n00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.731\nGreen circle, white check.\n\n388\n00:17:08.731 --> 00:17:10.300\nI'll close the wizard.\n\n389\n00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.230\nNow, this is just me just\nobserving the human condition, but\n\n390\n00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.510\nI've basically done what I wanted to do.\n\n391\n00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.410\nThe wizard says, I'm successful.\n\n392\n00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.960\nYou could not just say, okay,\nwe closed the wizard screen.\n\n393\n00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.400\nIt takes extra money and\ndevelopment time to close the screen out,\n\n394\n00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.430\nas opposed to me having to\nclick on that last button.\n\n395\n00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.660\n&gt;&gt; That's the way they feel about it.\n\n396\n00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.470\nThey didn't consult us on these things,\nwe've talked about this.\n\n397\n00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n398\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.511\nBut you know I'm bitter\nabout this kind of stuff.\n\n399\n00:17:36.511 --> 00:17:39.720\nI'm just thinking,\nthis is all really cool.\n\n400\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.510\nYou got this awesome technology.\n\n401\n00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.720\nYou couldn't spend the extra $5 give\nthe developer an extra piece of pizza,\n\n402\n00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.018\nan extra red bull, and just say,\nhey, close that out for them.\n\n403\n00:17:47.018 --> 00:17:48.797\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You couldn't make that happen, right?\n\n404\n00:17:48.797 --> 00:17:49.795\nJust didn't work.\n\n405\n00:17:49.795 --> 00:17:51.445\nAnyway, we're gonna close there.\n\n406\n00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:52.125\nAnd as soon as we do,\n\n407\n00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:57.035\nyou'll see we have our alert connector\nshowing up in the console, enabled yes.\n\n408\n00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:59.255\nOur operations manager alerts are there.\n\n409\n00:17:59.255 --> 00:18:01.625\nNotice now, we'll just highlight here,\nso you can see.\n\n410\n00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:04.825\nWe now have some actions and\ntasks specific to this.\n\n411\n00:18:04.825 --> 00:18:06.665\nDelete, don't wanna do that, of course.\n\n412\n00:18:06.665 --> 00:18:09.620\nBut I betcha if I click Delete,\nit'll let it go away without a warning.\n\n413\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.200\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n\n414\n00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.520\n&gt;&gt; They couldn't close the console.\n\n415\n00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.350\nBut they'll screw you on\nthe Delete with no trouble.\n\n416\n00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.480\nMake you do the work again.\n\n417\n00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.250\nBut we're going to stick it to them, make\nthem hit that close button every time.\n\n418\n00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.670\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Remove all the operating systems, and\n\n419\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.045\neverything is all.\n\n420\n00:18:22.045 --> 00:18:22.745\n&gt;&gt; C:/format.\nYou're done.\n\n421\n00:18:22.745 --> 00:18:23.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there ya go.\n\n422\n00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.050\n&gt;&gt; So, in addition,\nwe have properties, right?\n\n423\n00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.420\nSo, we can go and we can edit.\n\n424\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.860\nWe do have the ability to search,\nwe can do a little Synchronize Now.\n\n425\n00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.470\nSynchronize Now pulls down\nthat information, and\n\n426\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.465\nsyncs the connector to make\nsure the two are talking.\n\n427\n00:18:36.465 --> 00:18:38.455\nI'll show you that in just a second.\n\n428\n00:18:38.455 --> 00:18:39.615\nWe can go ahead and\n\n429\n00:18:39.615 --> 00:18:44.105\nstart a PowerShell session from here as\nwell, with the service manager module.\n\n430\n00:18:44.105 --> 00:18:46.555\nRemember we've shown you\nthe Ops manager shell,\n\n431\n00:18:46.555 --> 00:18:49.485\ntalked about the fact we've got\na shell for SharePoint, shell for\n\n432\n00:18:49.485 --> 00:18:54.050\nExchange, shell for this, shell for\nthat, it's like a big shell game, right?\n\n433\n00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.450\nIt's almost like the guy sitting on the\nstreet corner with the cardboard box, hey,\n\n434\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.420\nwhere's my management capabilities?\n\n435\n00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.640\nWhat commandlets am I gonna use today?\n\n436\n00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.365\n&gt;&gt; A second ago it sounded\nlike you said shellfish.\n\n437\n00:19:03.365 --> 00:19:05.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Shellfish this and shellfish that.\n\n438\n00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.440\n&gt;&gt; You're just thinking lunch time,\nthat's why you're thinking that.\n\n439\n00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.630\nSo, I'm just gonna click here real quick,\n\n440\n00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.330\nwe'll just take a look at two\nthings before we wrap up, one is,\n\n441\n00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.800\ncan we just go back to full screen,\nbecause I'm talking about clicking and\n\n442\n00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.640\nyou're seeing nothing,\nit's like box on box, screen on screen.\n\n443\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.980\nSo, you'll see I'm gonna click\non Start PowerShell Session,\n\n444\n00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.050\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n445\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:25.570\nI'm also gonna kick off synchronize for\nus, so let's just click there real quick.\n\n446\n00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.210\nWe'll see this will take a second\nto come up, doesn't take very long.\n\n447\n00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.240\nJust move this down here, and you'll see\nthat we do now have the ability to go in,\n\n448\n00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.260\nand use this if we want to, so\nwe'll have PowerShell available.\n\n449\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.940\nWe can go in and do that,\njust get rid of that.\n\n450\n00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.080\nWe also have Synchronize Now,\nsynchronization request has been\n\n451\n00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.560\nsubmitted, so\nwe're now essentially saying,\n\n452\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.270\nhey, go open up that connector,\ngo talk to the other side.\n\n453\n00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.710\nGrab some information.\n\n454\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.150\nLet's see what's happening over here.\n\n455\n00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.610\nBring it back and update me.\n\n456\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.035\nSo, if we don't wanna wait that 60\nsecond cycle, or whatever it is,\n\n457\n00:19:56.035 --> 00:19:58.506\nwe could do a manual\nsynchronization if we need to.\n\n458\n00:19:58.506 --> 00:20:01.691\nAnd ever so often, you may have to do that\njust to see something show up while you're\n\n459\n00:20:01.691 --> 00:20:02.430\nwaiting, right?\n\n460\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.420\nBut normally as long as the connectors\nare set to communicate, and everything's\n\n461\n00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.880\nworking well, we normally don't have\nto bother with the synchronization.\n\n462\n00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.924\nBut you can see that we can\ndo that if necessary, okay.\n\n463\n00:20:10.924 --> 00:20:11.880\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n464\n00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.790\nWell, now, we've seen how to create this\nalert connector for the Ops manager,\n\n465\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:17.890\nvery cool, right?\n\n466\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:23.580\nSomething I love how Adam was talking\nabout creating that whole connection life\n\n467\n00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.290\ncycle almost where from start to finish\neverything make sure that it gets touched,\n\n468\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.600\nand worked on at the proper spot, and\n\n469\n00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.150\nthen ultimately completed, because\neverything is now connected together.\n\n470\n00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:39.690\nYou don't have these ghosted tasks running\naround loose, and rampant every which way.\n\n471\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:43.710\nAnd going we need to go through this and\nclean the system up, keeps that from\n\n472\n00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.720\nhappening, and that can be anybody\nthat's worked in administration for\n\n473\n00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.190\nany length of time knows\nthat is a common problem.\n\n474\n00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.240\nSo, very cool that we\ncan make that happen.\n\n475\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.330\nAdam, we thank you for\nshowing how we can do that, and\n\n476\n00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:54.870\nwe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n477\n00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.400\nBut it looks like we've come\nto the end of our show.\n\n478\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.730\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n479\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.210\n&gt;&gt; I'm a synchronized connector.\n\n480\n00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.243\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n481\n00:21:05.034

00:00:11.959\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.239\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.167\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:21.480\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we're back with more on our duck\n\n7\n00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.650\nwalking monitoring a data\ncenter that's what we're doing.\n\n8\n00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.800\nData center monitoring\nwith Microsoft Scom.\n\n9\n00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.340\nAnd of course joining us in the studio,\n\n10\n00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.410\nthe disembodied hand floating\naround my head is Mr. Adam Gordan.\n\n11\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.823\nAdam welcome back sir hows it going?\n\n12\n00:00:33.823 --> 00:00:35.055\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:36.399\nVery nice to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.340\nI'm doing well I'm doing well thank you.\n\n15\n00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.330\nThat happens sometimes.\n\n16\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.927\nIt's just one of those things.\n\n17\n00:00:39.927 --> 00:00:40.919\n&gt;&gt; Strange interviews.\n[LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:43.079\n&gt;&gt; Its, you get the feeling you have to\n\n19\n00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.527\nbe a disembodied hand and you go with it.\n\n20\n00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:49.360\nAll right, so we're gonna take a look\nat how to setup another connector.\n\n21\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.950\nIn our last episode we had taken\na look at part one of two for\n\n22\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.960\nthe operations manager connectors.\n\n23\n00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.520\nWe took a look at the alert connector,\nwalked through how to set that up.\n\n24\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.430\nPretty straightforward.\n\n25\n00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.670\nReally not too complicated.\n\n26\n00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.967\nThis one won't be any more or\nless complicated than the first one.\n\n27\n00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:05.730\nIt'll be the three bear analogy.\n\n28\n00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.687\nJust right as they say.\n\n29\n00:01:07.687 --> 00:01:12.670\nAnd we're gonna do the CI connector\nconfiguration of the CI connector.\n\n30\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.940\nPretty straightforward,\njust like the alert connector.\n\n31\n00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.160\nWe're gonna right-click.\n\n32\n00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.695\nWe're gonna do a new connector,\n\n33\n00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:21.070\nwalk-through a couple of screens on\nthe wizard, really nothing too involved.\n\n34\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.655\nWe'll set up the connector,\nsee it working, and\n\n35\n00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:24.030\nwe're gonna take a look at that right now.\n\n36\n00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.030\nSo let's go in.\n\n37\n00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.530\nWe'll start off by reminding you\nwhere we are in our workspace.\n\n38\n00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.254\nWe have our administration workspace\nin the service level manager or\n\n39\n00:01:32.254 --> 00:01:35.539\nthe service manager rather\nconsole on the connectors area.\n\n40\n00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:36.780\nWe'll right-click.\n\n41\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.020\nWe'll go ahead we'll\nchoose create connector.\n\n42\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.070\nThis time we'll do our configuration\nitem or C-I connector here.\n\n43\n00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.880\nSo we'll grab that.\n\n44\n00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.429\nLet's just bring the window up and\nover so that way we can see it but\n\n45\n00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.904\nwe can still talk to you a little bit.\n\n46\n00:01:51.904 --> 00:01:54.938\nAnd we're going to go ahead\nclick create a new connector.\n\n47\n00:01:54.938 --> 00:01:56.570\nWe're going to go ahead and\ngive this a name.\n\n48\n00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.997\nWe did the ops connector and called it,\nor rather the ops alert connector,\n\n49\n00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:06.082\nwe called it alert so\nwe could tell what it was.\n\n50\n00:02:06.082 --> 00:02:10.910\nSo we'll call this one ops CI connector.\n\n51\n00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.968\nThat way, OPM for ops manager,\nand then we'll do CI connector\n\n52\n00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:20.938\nIf I can hit the spacebar and\nspell the right way, there we go.\n\n53\n00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:23.200\nI never claimed to be a good typist.\n\n54\n00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.960\nAnd then that way, we can tell what\nit is so when we look in the console,\n\n55\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.190\nwe can quickly at a glance tell\nwhat connector we're working on.\n\n56\n00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.310\nSo go ahead and we'll do that,\nwe'll click next.\n\n57\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.190\nWe have our server details here.\n\n58\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.740\nRemember, keep in mind\nas we've done before,\n\n59\n00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.960\nthat we have to put in\nthe name of the server.\n\n60\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.260\nThat is the management server\nthat we're targeting, right?\n\n61\n00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.450\nSo the opps manager.\n\n62\n00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.803\nSo we're gonna put in the name of\nthe server here plabsy01 or sys rather 01.\n\n63\n00:02:48.803 --> 00:02:51.218\nWe have our operational database account.\n\n64\n00:02:51.218 --> 00:02:54.474\nWe talked about this run as account\nin the last episode as well.\n\n65\n00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:58.026\nWe're gonna wanna test this so we're\ngoing to hit test connection prompted for\n\n66\n00:02:58.026 --> 00:02:58.650\nour password.\n\n67\n00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.896\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll put that in real quick and\n\n68\n00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:05.220\nthen make sure that\nthe connection will work.\n\n69\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.962\nWe always want to take advantage\nof that opportunity to test,\n\n70\n00:03:07.962 --> 00:03:09.975\nas Daniel's pointed out in prior episodes.\n\n71\n00:03:09.975 --> 00:03:13.870\nIt is always good to do that, in case we\ndo have an issue there for some reason.\n\n72\n00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.986\nWe'll know and we'll find out now before\nwe get further down the road and,\n\n73\n00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:20.026\nof course, then have to go back and\nfix whatever the problem is, right?\n\n74\n00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:23.519\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I'm assuming some of the\ncommon problems are gonna be like network\n\n75\n00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.980\nconnectivity or credentials.\n\n76\n00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.193\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, yeah,\njust you don't have the right connection,\n\n77\n00:03:28.193 --> 00:03:32.001\nyou targeted the wrong machine, maybe DNS\nis not working, right, can't resolve.\n\n78\n00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.380\nWe rely on DNS we do for most everything.\n\n79\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.220\nYou got the right idea but\nthe wrong credentials as Daniel said.\n\n80\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.634\nPut in the name, you misspelled it.\n\n81\n00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:39.746\nYou got the password wrong,\n\n82\n00:03:39.746 --> 00:03:42.167\nall the common things we would\nthink of that may go wrong here.\n\n83\n00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:44.430\nGary will fix those, whatever they may be.\n\n84\n00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.090\nWe'll go ahead, we'll click OK.\n\n85\n00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.864\nWe'll click Next, pass that screen, we now\nhave the select the configuration items\n\n86\n00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:53.799\nwe're gonna import,\nreconcile with Ops Manager.\n\n87\n00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.581\nThe configuration items are going\nto be the items that we want to\n\n88\n00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:03.650\nbe able to work with and\nbe able to make sure we have knowledge of.\n\n89\n00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.805\nThey come to us from our management packs.\n\n90\n00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:07.890\nThey may be hard to see,\nif we go full screen for\n\n91\n00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.630\njust one second you'll see here.\n\n92\n00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.830\nI'm just hovering over one so\nyou can see it, but\n\n93\n00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.530\nmanagement packs, this is the Microsoft\nsystems center service designer library.\n\n94\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.880\nSo it tells us what's there,\ngot the Windows library etc.\n\n95\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.610\nSo it's going to pull these items\nin from the management packs.\n\n96\n00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.810\nSo we're going to choose which\nof the required management packs\n\n97\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.430\nthat define the configuration items\nwe want to be able to import here.\n\n98\n00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.040\nThat's the idea behind this.\n\n99\n00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.610\nSo we're going to choose\nthe Microsoft System Center library.\n\n100\n00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.890\nLet's go ahead and grab that one.\n\n101\n00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.280\nIt's about four or five down right there,\n\n102\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.860\nabout three quarters of the way\ndown on the first part of the list.\n\n103\n00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.740\nAnd then you'll notice we have a select\nall button down on the bottom.\n\n104\n00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.880\nWe also have a do not\nwrite null values for\n\n105\n00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.010\nproperties that are not\nset in ops manager option.\n\n106\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.070\nMeaning if we don't have a property set\nin the ops manager, we are saying, hey,\n\n107\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.550\ndon't put a null in.\n\n108\n00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.470\nEssentially just leave it blank,\nright, or not leave it blank,\n\n109\n00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.550\ndepending on what we try or decide to do.\n\n110\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.570\nDon't import it.\n\n111\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.906\nDon't acquire the value\nand/or set it to a null.\n\n112\n00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:07.880\nSo we're gonna leave those there.\n\n113\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.560\nWe're not gonna bother to check them off,\nbut\n\n114\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.850\nwe just wanna acknowledge what is there.\n\n115\n00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.010\nWe'll click Next.\n\n116\n00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.430\nWe have to create a schedule,\nhow often do we synchronize?\n\n117\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.990\nYou saw in the Alert Connector,\nwe synchronized every so\n\n118\n00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.130\nmany seconds, because alerts may\nbe generated very frequently.\n\n119\n00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.938\nWant to be able to bring those in as often\nand as quickly as possible, because they\n\n120\n00:05:25.938 --> 00:05:29.816\nare not only important to be able to act\non immediately, but they are perishable.\n\n121\n00:05:29.816 --> 00:05:33.398\nWhere as a synchronizing the CI,\nthe Configuration Items or\n\n122\n00:05:33.398 --> 00:05:35.928\nConfiguration Information about items,\n\n123\n00:05:35.928 --> 00:05:39.880\nthat's coming out of management\npacks is really not perishable.\n\n124\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.160\nIt doesn't change very often.\n\n125\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.826\nOnce you load up a management pack,\nyou got that stuff running It's\n\n126\n00:05:44.826 --> 00:05:49.608\nnot like you're gonna suddenly add 5,\n10, 15, 20 of these every few minutes.\n\n127\n00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:51.500\nYou're gonna build them out initially.\n\n128\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.305\nOnce we do our initial build out,\nwe have everything set up.\n\n129\n00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:57.646\nWhile it is likely you can add\nmanagement patch from time to time,\n\n130\n00:05:57.646 --> 00:06:01.166\nIt is not very likely you would do it\nthat often and even when you do it,\n\n131\n00:06:01.166 --> 00:06:03.999\nit would usually be done\nduring a maintenance window.\n\n132\n00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:07.131\nWhich are predefined traditionally for\nmaybe once or\n\n133\n00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:10.828\ntwice a month, whatever your\nchange management cycle may be.\n\n134\n00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:14.360\nSynchronizing at least once a day\nhere is perfectly adequate.\n\n135\n00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.179\nThere's no worries about that.\n\n136\n00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:17.492\nYou're really not gonna miss\nanything in other words.\n\n137\n00:06:17.492 --> 00:06:21.420\nWhereas with the alert connectors, if we\nonly synchronize once a day a match in\n\n138\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.080\npotentially all of the backlog we would\nhave that, right with all those alerts.\n\n139\n00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.520\nThat maybe generated over 24 hour period.\n\n140\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.730\nAnd the inability to act on them could be\ncatastrophic to the organizations in terms\n\n141\n00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.280\nof the health of the infrastructure.\n\n142\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.520\nSo we're gonna leave\nthis at everyday at 1700,\n\n143\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.010\nwhich would be 5 PM wherever you maybe,\nwhatever that local time is for you.\n\n144\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.060\nBut, you'll see we use military time here.\n\n145\n00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.600\nSo, in case you're not familiar\nwith where 1700 may come from.\n\n146\n00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.180\nThat is gonna be between 1600 and 1800.\n\n147\n00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just in case you needed to know\n\n148\n00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.230\nwhat that is, right?\n\n149\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.130\n&gt;&gt; He is a funny one.\n\n150\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.459\n&gt;&gt; I am a funny little guy there.\n\n151\n00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:56.533\n&gt;&gt; He'll be here all week too.\n\n152\n00:06:56.533 --> 00:06:58.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm here all week.\n\n153\n00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.370\nThank you, thank you very much.\n\n154\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.780\n&gt;&gt; Tip your waitress.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so we got something.\n\n155\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.510\nThis one is real short,\nwe don't have to do all the configuration.\n\n156\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.540\nRemember, we did the alert connectors.\n\n157\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.610\nWe had to set the routing rules for\nthe alerts.\n\n158\n00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.140\nSo I had to go in and\ntake a little detour, do all that, right.\n\n159\n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.681\nWe don't have to do all that.\n\n160\n00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:14.853\nWe really are just literally going out,\ncreating a pathway,\n\n161\n00:07:14.853 --> 00:07:18.560\ngrabbing configuration information\nthrough a management pack.\n\n162\n00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.630\nBringing it back in,\nthat's all we're doing.\n\n163\n00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.480\nSo we've got this set up, we're gonna go\nahead, just take a look at our summary,\n\n164\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.270\nmake sure everything's good.\n\n165\n00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.470\nWe'll click create here,\ndoesn't take very long at all.\n\n166\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.530\nGot our green circle, white check.\n\n167\n00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.330\nI'm not gonna bother to\ngo off on the whole hey,\n\n168\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.960\nwhy can't they close the box thing again.\n\n169\n00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.145\nYou've heard me say that already.\n\n170\n00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:36.792\n&gt;&gt; You've done that rant already.\n\n171\n00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:38.580\n&gt;&gt; Just gonna wait, we've done that.\n\n172\n00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.250\nWe're just gonna click Close and\nyou'll see that we do have our,\n\n173\n00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:49.170\nthere we go, we do have our CI connector\nnow instantiated in the console.\n\n174\n00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.550\nWe could see it there and\n\n175\n00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.310\nonce we have that set up,\nyou'll see we could highlight it.\n\n176\n00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.320\nYou'll see as we go through.\n\n177\n00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.540\nIt's pretty easy to start to\ntell which connectors are which.\n\n178\n00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.760\nAs we name them, as long as we keep track\nof them, we can see where they are.\n\n179\n00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.210\nJust reminding you, just like we did with\nthe other connectors we took a look.\n\n180\n00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.260\nWe do have our actions and\ntasks sitting over here.\n\n181\n00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.010\nI did wanna show you,\ncuz I didn't show you last time.\n\n182\n00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.530\nI showed you the PowerShell\nmanagement shell for\n\n183\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.650\nService Level Manager, but\nI didn't bother to do anything with it.\n\n184\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.950\nWe just brought it up last time\nin the prior demo, hey look,\n\n185\n00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.110\nwe can launch it, let's do that now.\n\n186\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.280\nHey look we can launch it.\n\n187\n00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.145\nOkay we're done.\n&gt;&gt; Amazing.\n\n188\n00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:25.551\n&gt;&gt; We needed to do, right it's a retread.\n\n189\n00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.230\nNo I did want to do something\nspecific here with you what I'm gonna\n\n190\n00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.543\ndo is I'm just gonna change the background\nfor a minute so you can see this a little\n\n191\n00:08:31.543 --> 00:08:34.470\nbit easier because otherwise it's\ngonna be kind of hard to tell.\n\n192\n00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.660\nWhat we're doing in there.\n\n193\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.590\nSo we're just gonna go ahead we're\ngonna change the font out so\n\n194\n00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.240\nit's a little bit bigger for you to see.\n\n195\n00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.420\nGotta actually give Mike credit for\n\n196\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.920\nthis one cuz I was struggling with hey\nwhat font do I use make it show up.\n\n197\n00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.300\nHe said just go and\nuse Lucinda Console and\n\n198\n00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.230\nmake it really big because\nthe console font shows up well.\n\n199\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.634\nAnd he taught me that and\never since I've been the console\n\n200\n00:08:55.634 --> 00:08:59.320\nconsole-crazed console guy using consoles.\n\n201\n00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.760\nSo wanna give my credit for that,\ncuz he's made that possible for\n\n202\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.230\nme to show you this kind of stuff and\nactually make it make sense.\n\n203\n00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.127\nWe're just gonna change this out to do\nour traditional color scheme there,\n\n204\n00:09:09.127 --> 00:09:11.358\nit's a little bit easier to see\nthat when we do it that way.\n\n205\n00:09:11.358 --> 00:09:13.100\nAt least I find it to\nbe a little bit easier.\n\n206\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.640\nI talked about the get_command command\nin the ops manager shell to show\n\n207\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.980\nyou all the commands that shows you how to\nexport him, get a list together of them.\n\n208\n00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.652\nSame thing applies here.\n\n209\n00:09:23.652 --> 00:09:28.162\nYou can use get_command here if you\nwant to be able to see the commands that\n\n210\n00:09:28.162 --> 00:09:29.860\nare available to you.\n\n211\n00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:35.570\nSo if we do get command, we'll see that we\nhave all of the different items available,\n\n212\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.440\nall the different commandlets available so\n\n213\n00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.620\nwe can understand what's\ngoing on with them.\n\n214\n00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.120\nThe system center service\nmanager user role, work flow,\n\n215\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.910\nall the different stuff that's in here not\nspecific just to the PowerShell module for\n\n216\n00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.040\nthe system center service manager.\n\n217\n00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.530\nWe do have other stuff\nin there as you can see.\n\n218\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.180\nPowerShell utility, PowerShell core,\nPowerShell management.\n\n219\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.760\nBut interspersed in there we got quite\na few cmdlets that are specific to\n\n220\n00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.050\nthe use of service manager.\n\n221\n00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.480\nSo it's a good idea for you to go and\npoke around a little bit.\n\n222\n00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.857\nNot necessarily cuz you're\ngonna use it right away, but\n\n223\n00:10:08.857 --> 00:10:11.396\nat some point as we've talked\nabout in many of our episodes.\n\n224\n00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:13.072\nYou may find a need for PowerShell and\n\n225\n00:10:13.072 --> 00:10:16.220\nyou wanna at least be prepared\nto understand what's in there.\n\n226\n00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.552\nHelps you to get a sense of what\nkind of commands are there.\n\n227\n00:10:18.552 --> 00:10:20.904\nThought it would just be a good\nidea to add that in for you,\n\n228\n00:10:20.904 --> 00:10:23.090\nshow you what's going\non in there real quick.\n\n229\n00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.540\nMake sure that you are comfortable\nwith it in case somebody asks you.\n\n230\n00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.115\nYou never know,\n\n231\n00:10:27.115 --> 00:10:29.508\nyou could be sitting in a bar somewhere\none night Trivia starts to go.\n\n232\n00:10:29.508 --> 00:10:34.660\n[CROSSTALK] And\nyou're just like, I know that.\n\n233\n00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.563\n&gt;&gt; Where's my free beer?\n\n234\n00:10:35.563 --> 00:10:37.140\n&gt;&gt; Give me my free beer, exactly.\n\n235\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.377\nSo you never know, right,\nthat could come in handy.\n\n236\n00:10:39.377 --> 00:10:41.480\nPlaying geek trivia you could\njust trump everybody, right.\n\n237\n00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.537\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt about that.\n\n238\n00:10:42.537 --> 00:10:43.850\n&gt;&gt; You'd be the head geek.\n\n239\n00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.360\n&gt;&gt; It never hurts to have at least some\nworking familiarity, even if what we're\n\n240\n00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.030\ntalking about, not completely entrenched\nin it, you don't use it all the time.\n\n241\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.890\nBeing completely new to\nit is never a good thing,\n\n242\n00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:59.700\nespecially if it's an operating system or\nsome system that you use on a daily basis.\n\n243\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.210\nAt least have some familiarity\nwith all of its functionality,\n\n244\n00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.590\nif not a working familiarity with it.\n\n245\n00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.330\nJust knowing what it can do can\nhelp you out a lot down the road.\n\n246\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.820\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n247\n00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.350\n&gt;&gt; Moving on.\n\n248\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.580\n&gt;&gt; Moving on.\nAll right, so\n\n249\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.970\none more thing we want to\ntake a look at real quick.\n\n250\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.070\nThought it would be just\ncool to just add this in.\n\n251\n00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.140\nWhen you create the connector, every so\n\n252\n00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.670\noften you may have to\nactually turn it off.\n\n253\n00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.549\nWe've shown you in the prior\ndemo on the install window.\n\n254\n00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:24.960\nWe didn't really mention it this time.\n\n255\n00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.090\nWe showed it to you last time.\n\n256\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.840\nThere's the check box, enabled by default,\n\n257\n00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.520\nthat says enable the connector\nwhen we create it.\n\n258\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.676\nBut what if we want to disable it,\nnot delete it?\n\n259\n00:11:32.676 --> 00:11:34.879\nThat would be, in theory,\none way to disable it.\n\n260\n00:11:34.879 --> 00:11:35.645\n&gt;&gt; But that would stop it from working.\n\n261\n00:11:35.645 --> 00:11:39.010\n&gt;&gt; That would stop it from working.\n\n262\n00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.170\nBut that would be a permanent disabling.\n\n263\n00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.296\nWe're just going for a minor,\nnon-permanent disable effect here.\n\n264\n00:11:45.296 --> 00:11:48.446\n&gt;&gt; You know, there's an admin\nout there that's deleting and\n\n265\n00:11:48.446 --> 00:11:50.147\nrecreating these connectors.\n\n266\n00:11:50.147 --> 00:11:50.763\nAs necessary.\n\n267\n00:11:50.763 --> 00:11:53.292\n[CROSSTALK] I just wish\nthat there was a way.\n\n268\n00:11:53.292 --> 00:11:54.720\n&gt;&gt; Let me just delete that.\n\n269\n00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.780\nI didn't realize.\n\n270\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.120\nIf I just had taken a look at ITPro.TV,\n\n271\n00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.770\nthis is the value of\nwhat we offer you here.\n\n272\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.060\nSo we're gonna show you real quick,\njust a little added extra for you.\n\n273\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.280\nWe're gonna show you how to disable\na connector and re-enable it.\n\n274\n00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.150\nIt's not gonna take very long at all so\n\n275\n00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:12.430\nwhatever connectors we use the one we were\njust installing so our CI connector there.\n\n276\n00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.080\nHighlighted you'll notice off to the right\nhere in the workspace that we have\n\n277\n00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.920\na disable I'll hover so you can see\nthe little pop out, and you can see.\n\n278\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.520\nYou know again I am going to go on my\nrant here for a minute here so, they go\n\n279\n00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:27.760\nto the trouble of figuring out how to give\nyou a pop out so you can see what's there.\n\n280\n00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.396\nThey can not close the stupid wizard\nwindow [CROSSTALK] when you finish\n\n281\n00:12:31.396 --> 00:12:32.343\nautomatically.\n\n282\n00:12:32.343 --> 00:12:33.625\nWhat are they thinking?\n\n283\n00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:35.217\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait for SCOM 2016 and\n\n284\n00:12:35.217 --> 00:12:37.019\nthey're gonna call it the Adam Gordon.\n\n285\n00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:39.793\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we finally listened feature,\n\n286\n00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:40.310\nright?\n\n287\n00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.400\nIt's just gonna disappear.\n\n288\n00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.450\nI mean, think about it.\n\n289\n00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.950\nYou know what it takes to\ncreate the pop out window,\n\n290\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.640\nversus what it would take to just\nclose the window on the wizard?\n\n291\n00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.034\n&gt;&gt; Probably the same coding, just.\n\n292\n00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:52.397\n&gt;&gt; It's the same guy, he just got lazy and\nsaid, all right, I'm going home early, and\n\n293\n00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.396\ndidn't bother to do it.\n\n294\n00:12:53.396 --> 00:12:55.640\nI did the check off thing for the popups.\n\n295\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.790\nI'm done, I'm not doing anything else.\n\n296\n00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.143\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's beer 30 somewhere.\n\n297\n00:12:58.143 --> 00:13:02.818\n&gt;&gt; I just joked, this is the problem\nright here, the lack of quality\n\n298\n00:13:02.818 --> 00:13:07.580\nattention to craftsmanship that\nwe fight every day in ITPro.TV.\n\n299\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.841\nAnd not just here on ITProTV cuz\nthey always have an attention but\n\n300\n00:13:09.841 --> 00:13:10.405\nin IT in general.\n\n301\n00:13:10.405 --> 00:13:11.722\n&gt;&gt; Think of the irony of Amish coders.\n\n302\n00:13:11.722 --> 00:13:19.611\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That is the ultimate\nparadox and irony right there.\n\n303\n00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:22.640\nAll right so I told you it would\ntake very short amount of time.\n\n304\n00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.590\nIt's taking us longer to talk\nabout silly ridiculousness than it\n\n305\n00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:26.920\nis to actually show you how to do it.\n\n306\n00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.836\nSo what we're gonna do is\nhighlight the connector here.\n\n307\n00:13:28.836 --> 00:13:33.579\nWe're just gonna click disable, let's do\nthat real quick, and once we've done that,\n\n308\n00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:36.566\nhey disabled and\nagain got a window telling us we did it.\n\n309\n00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.920\nBut window isn't going away.\n\n310\n00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.430\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n311\n00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.640\n&gt;&gt; Got to click on it.\n\n312\n00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.400\nIt's a highly manually person intensive\nprocess to actually manage infrastructure.\n\n313\n00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.110\nAnd you can see, once we've done that.\n\n314\n00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.120\nEnabled connector.\n\n315\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.750\nNo, right?\nIt's been changed over.\n\n316\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.180\nNo big deal.\nYou want to re-enable it?\n\n317\n00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.480\nNo problem, highlight it.\n\n318\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.600\nWe've got a green arrow pointing up.\n\n319\n00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.530\nGot that nice little pop out\ntelling us what we're doing.\n\n320\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.800\nClick enable.\n\n321\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.513\nGo ahead, we'll do that.\n\n322\n00:13:58.513 --> 00:14:00.830\nWe enabled that connector.\n\n323\n00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.330\nAnd sure enough,\nthere it is right there, re-enabled.\n\n324\n00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.560\nSo just disabling and re-enabling\na connector, real simple to do.\n\n325\n00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.630\nImportant, we were joking around about the\nfact someone's out there deleting them and\n\n326\n00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.510\nrecreating them.\n\n327\n00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.950\nHopefully you're not doing that.\n\n328\n00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:14.870\nHopefully you do know and\n\n329\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.330\nyou have realized you can enable and\ndisable connectors on command but\n\n330\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.100\nyou certainly can do it right there\nfrom the console with no trouble.\n\n331\n00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.600\nOff to the right, under tasks,\nyou'll be able to highlight that and\n\n332\n00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.140\ndo it as often as necessary.\n\n333\n00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.650\n&gt;&gt; Now there is that admin that's out\nthere writing a sternly worded letter.\n\n334\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.785\n&gt;&gt; Shaking his or her face.\n\n335\n00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:30.497\n&gt;&gt; How dare you Sir?\n\n336\n00:14:30.497 --> 00:14:34.820\n&gt;&gt; Curse you, curse you for\nshowing me the light.\n\n337\n00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, everyone that being said.\n\n338\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:42.100\nThat is how we do the CI connector and\nif we need to enable or disable connector.\n\n339\n00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.900\nWe now know how to do that as well.\n\n340\n00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.938\nSave us from just recreating and\ndeleting them.\n\n341\n00:14:46.938 --> 00:14:48.900\n[LAUGH] Add nauseum.\n\n342\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.480\nThat being said, thanks, Adam,\nfor showing us those cool things.\n\n343\n00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.110\nAnd we thank you guys for watching but\nit is that time for us to sign for off.\n\n344\n00:14:55.110

00:00:12.089\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.095\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:17.060\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.196\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n7\n00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:21.933\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe are coming back at you with more\n\n8\n00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:25.040\non data center monitoring\nwith Microsoft SCOM.\n\n9\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.370\nAnd joining us back in the studio today is\nthe man with the monitoring all over SCOM,\n\n10\n00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.350\nthat is our good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.180\nAdam, welcome back, man.\n\n12\n00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.440\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.380\n&gt;&gt; It is going well.\n\n14\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.910\nIt is going well.\n\n15\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.740\nHopefully, we'll be going\nbetter after we show you\n\n16\n00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.120\nhow to import an integration pack and\nset it up for System Center 2012.\n\n17\n00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.450\nThat is right, folks.\n\n18\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.840\nR2 Orchestrator coming\nsoon to a screen near you.\n\n19\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.707\nAs a matter of fact, right.\n\n20\n00:00:50.707 --> 00:00:51.505\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; I almost caught her.\n\n21\n00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:52.900\nI almost caught her.\n\n22\n00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.450\nClose enough.\n\n23\n00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.400\nWe're gonna get started.\n\n24\n00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.950\nWe are gonna talk about System Center\n2012, Orchestrator, and integration packs.\n\n25\n00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.924\nWe actually walked through a portion\nof this demo in some prior episodes,\n\n26\n00:01:02.924 --> 00:01:07.270\nshowed you roughly, very quickly what\nwe would do to bring integration pack.\n\n27\n00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.357\nDidn't actually do it because\nI wanted to save it so\n\n28\n00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:11.990\nwe could walk through the whole\nthing here, but we hinted at it.\n\n29\n00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.840\nWe kind of teased it out a little bit.\n\n30\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.150\nSaid you would go here.\n\n31\n00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.040\nYou would go through the two-step\nprocess of going ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.920\nactually registering the IP,\nthe management pack information\n\n33\n00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.770\nfile with the server, and\nthen actually doing the import.\n\n34\n00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.691\nWe're gonna walk you\nthrough how to do this now.\n\n35\n00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:31.331\nWe're gonna go find a couple of OIP files\nand then we're gonna bring them in,\n\n36\n00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:32.570\nactually gonna show you.\n\n37\n00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.610\nGot a list about seven or\neight of them we'll play with.\n\n38\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.346\nWe'll bring them in and then we'll go\nthrough and walk through the second part\n\n39\n00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:39.302\nof that process, and\nmake sure everything gets setup.\n\n40\n00:01:39.302 --> 00:01:43.014\nSo we're starting by using\nthe deployment manager.\n\n41\n00:01:43.014 --> 00:01:45.040\nAnd I just wanna show you\nwhere we got this from.\n\n42\n00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.591\nThe deployment manager is one of the two\nthings we have to deal with when we use\n\n43\n00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:52.380\nOrchestra, we're gonna go to our start\nmenu workspace or our start workspace.\n\n44\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.450\nAnd you'll see I've already put the tile\nfor deployment manager over here.\n\n45\n00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.382\nYou ever play concentration\nwhen you were a kid?\n\n46\n00:01:58.382 --> 00:01:59.896\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Where you flipped the cards over and\n\n47\n00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:01.250\nyou had a match?\n\n48\n00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.130\nIt's nothing like that, I just thought\nI'd make that random reference.\n\n49\n00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.730\nSo we got that tile but where we want\nto go get it from, in other words,\n\n50\n00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.150\nwhere it is, we may have to go search for\nit, down here lower left.\n\n51\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.070\nClick on our little circle with our arrow.\n\n52\n00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.550\nWe're going to go out.\nWe'll see it happens to be right here.\n\n53\n00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.160\nBut it's going to get installed as part\nof the orchestration, tool set for\n\n54\n00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.940\norchestrater, the console, the run\nbook designer, the deployment manager,\n\n55\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.810\nall right there.\n\n56\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.400\nSo all I did was just right click\non that say hey, pin to start menu.\n\n57\n00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.760\nThen I went ahead and I opened it up.\n\n58\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.385\nSo what we're going to do,\njust click out of here.\n\n59\n00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.078\nWe're just going to go back over here.\n\n60\n00:02:34.078 --> 00:02:36.230\nAlready got that opened up for you.\n\n61\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.990\nSo what we're going to do now,\njust go full screen here so\n\n62\n00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.780\nyou can see that a little bit easier.\n\n63\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.209\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nright-click on the integration packs item.\n\n64\n00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.080\nAnd we get two menu choices here.\n\n65\n00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.130\nRegister IP with\nthe Orchestrator Management Server.\n\n66\n00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.130\nWe're gonna do that first and then Deploy\nIP to Runbook Server Runbook Designer.\n\n67\n00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.540\nWe'll come back,\nwe'll talk about that in just minute.\n\n68\n00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.390\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click here on Register IP.\n\n69\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.382\nWe have Welcome to\nIntegration Pack Registration Wizard.\n\n70\n00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:06.902\nWe're gonna go out, we're gonna\nselect the integration pack or packs,\n\n71\n00:03:06.902 --> 00:03:08.055\nwhatever we wanna use.\n\n72\n00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:11.339\nAnd then we're gonna accept the licencing\nterms, and we're gonna register them.\n\n73\n00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:12.580\nSo we're gonna click Next.\n\n74\n00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.690\nWe got nothing here,\nwe're gonna use our Add button.\n\n75\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.685\nNow this may not come up by default on\nthe location where your integration packs\n\n76\n00:03:20.685 --> 00:03:23.726\nare gonna be, so\nyou're gonna have to go out and find them.\n\n77\n00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:26.180\nYou may have downloaded\nthem from Microsoft.\n\n78\n00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.944\nYou may have gotten them from a website or\na third party area.\n\n79\n00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:32.840\nSo, wherever you have them make\nsure you know where to find them.\n\n80\n00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.610\nMine are just sitting in the root\nof the C drive here in a folder\n\n81\n00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.653\ncalled integration packs.\n\n82\n00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:38.465\nSo, just gonna browse to them.\n\n83\n00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:40.265\nJust go over here and go to the C drive.\n\n84\n00:03:40.265 --> 00:03:41.945\nGot integration packs right there,\n\n85\n00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:46.385\ngonna bring that up, and\njust extend that out, just a wee bit.\n\n86\n00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:49.331\nAnd you could see here, we've got all\nsorts of different integration packs.\n\n87\n00:03:50.382 --> 00:03:54.182\nSC 2012, SP 1, integration pack for Azure.\n\n88\n00:03:54.182 --> 00:03:58.672\nWe got config manager, DPM,\ndata protection ops manager.\n\n89\n00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:02.634\nWe've got service manager,\nvirtual machine manager,\n\n90\n00:04:02.634 --> 00:04:06.358\nactive directory exchange,\nadmin exchange, FTP.\n\n91\n00:04:06.358 --> 00:04:09.612\nWe got it all, a, b, c, one, two, three.\n\n92\n00:04:09.612 --> 00:04:12.502\nYou and me, do re mi, fa so la ti.\n\n93\n00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:16.100\nAnd so you could see that I will select\nwhichever one I want to work with.\n\n94\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.730\nWe're going to go ahead, we're going\nto take the integration pack for\n\n95\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.090\nops manager, roughly sitting\nabout halfway down right here.\n\n96\n00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.250\nSo we're gonna grab that one.\n\n97\n00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.750\nJust double-click on it.\n\n98\n00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.430\nTry not to rename it in the process but\nhighlight it.\n\n99\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.200\nThere we go.\n\n100\n00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.910\nAnd once we have we'll click open.\n\n101\n00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.270\nAnd you'll see we just added\ninto the list here right.\n\n102\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.480\nReally no big deal.\n\n103\n00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.010\nGot that.\n\n104\n00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.460\nWe can add another one in if\nwe wanna to go grab one more.\n\n105\n00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.460\nLet's say we go ahead and we grab the,\nlet's do service manager since\n\n106\n00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.670\nwe're playing with that one and we'll just\nadd a couple in and we just stack up.\n\n107\n00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.520\nJust have to move that over there so\nwe can kind of see what's what, and\n\n108\n00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.350\nwe know which ones we've added in,\nand as I keep dragging across,\n\n109\n00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.490\nwhat was that whole comment\nabout not passing the blue line.\n\n110\n00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.825\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you shall not pass.\n\n111\n00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:03.040\n&gt;&gt; You shall not pass.\n\n112\n00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.590\nSo you can see them here,\nwe have all of them, no big deal,\n\n113\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.920\nwe can add as many as we want.\n\n114\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.680\nWhen we're done.\n\n115\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.490\nGo ahead and click Next to just\nlist out the ones we're gonna use,\n\n116\n00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.920\nlet's click Finish,\ngive that just a second.\n\n117\n00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.790\nWe do have the second part here.\n\n118\n00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.391\nWe have to accept our licensing terms,\nso we're just gonna go ahead and\n\n119\n00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:20.182\nclick Accept.\n\n120\n00:05:20.182 --> 00:05:21.919\n&gt;&gt; The shortest license\nI've ever seen in my life.\n\n121\n00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.045\n&gt;&gt; That is,\nyeah considering Microsoft's pension for\n\n122\n00:05:25.045 --> 00:05:27.960\nlong files that is really\nkind of a short one.\n\n123\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.690\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna accept that.\n\n124\n00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.530\nWe accept the end user agreement.\n\n125\n00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.919\nAnd then, once we've done that.\n\n126\n00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.000\nGot the second one there.\n\n127\n00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.940\nLet me just accept that one.\n\n128\n00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.220\nOnce we've done that,\nwe'll get those to pop in.\n\n129\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.720\nLet's just go back here.\n\n130\n00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.300\nCome over here.\n\n131\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.170\nWe can now see the two\nintegration packs are listed.\n\n132\n00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.233\nWe have a little log entry area down\nhere at the bottom, in the center.\n\n133\n00:05:48.233 --> 00:05:51.293\nKind of area at the lower\nthird of the screen.\n\n134\n00:05:51.293 --> 00:05:54.449\nAnd we can see that we can track\neverything we were just doing.\n\n135\n00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.453\nFrom being able to go ahead and\ngrab the license packs,\n\n136\n00:05:57.453 --> 00:06:00.500\nthe integration packs,\naccept the license terms.\n\n137\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.872\nWe just kind of walk though the log and we\ncan see everything we've been doing there.\n\n138\n00:06:04.872 --> 00:06:07.810\nAnd we can see that ultimately\nwe were successful.\n\n139\n00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.290\nSo we have that in there now,\nso that's good.\n\n140\n00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.540\nNow what we can do is deploy\nthe integration packs for,\n\n141\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.990\nin this case we'll deploy the one for\noperations manager.\n\n142\n00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.360\nWe're not going to deploy all of them but\nyou can see the idea behind it.\n\n143\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.177\nSo what we're gonna do is the following,\nwe're gonna right click the integration\n\n144\n00:06:23.177 --> 00:06:26.514\npath or integration pack rather folder and\nwe're gonna select deploy.\n\n145\n00:06:26.514 --> 00:06:29.994\nSo we're gonna come over here and we're\ngonna right click and instead of register,\n\n146\n00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:32.090\nthis time we're gonna do a deploy, right?\n\n147\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.770\nSo we're gonna do our next item.\n\n148\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.570\nDeploy here.\n\n149\n00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.230\nBring this one up.\n\n150\n00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.740\nThis is now gonna allow us to go in,\nselect the integration pack and\n\n151\n00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.013\nthen select the computer or\ncomputers we want it deployed to.\n\n152\n00:06:44.013 --> 00:06:46.240\nSo we're gonna click next on this one.\n\n153\n00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.151\nWe'll select the operations manager\nmanagement pack integration pack\n\n154\n00:06:51.151 --> 00:06:51.962\npardon me.\n\n155\n00:06:51.962 --> 00:06:54.649\nSo we're gonna select that one,\nclick next.\n\n156\n00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:56.929\nThen we have to specify\nthe computer we're gonna use.\n\n157\n00:06:56.929 --> 00:07:01.060\nLet me just look up the name of our\ntarget here, so we get the right one.\n\n158\n00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.051\nSo I wasn't paying attention to my notes,\nplabsys01, so we're gonna do plabsys01.\n\n159\n00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:10.960\nWe're then gonna go ahead click add here,\nmake sure we have that in there.\n\n160\n00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.076\nNotice we can do a little search with\nthe ellipses if we need to go out and\n\n161\n00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:18.351\nwe can, as soon as it comes up.\n\n162\n00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:20.156\nWe can go out and browse for it using a,\n\n163\n00:07:20.156 --> 00:07:23.670\nyou know kind of a traditional pick\nlist search feature area right there.\n\n164\n00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.788\nBrowse for computer.\n\n165\n00:07:24.788 --> 00:07:27.440\nGo out over the network,\nwe can find it if we need to.\n\n166\n00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.290\nWe can remove it if we put it in there and\nit's not supposed to be there.\n\n167\n00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.287\nWe'll click next.\n\n168\n00:07:35.013 --> 00:07:36.050\nThere we go.\n\n169\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.164\nAnd then we have schedule installation,\nwhen do we want this to take place.\n\n170\n00:07:39.164 --> 00:07:43.429\nDo we want to do it right away, do we want\nto schedule it, are we gonna go ahead and\n\n171\n00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:46.310\nare we going to deal with\nany of the advanced options.\n\n172\n00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.236\nSo let's just take a look.\n\n173\n00:07:47.236 --> 00:07:48.770\nSo we're not gonna bother scheduling it.\n\n174\n00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.560\nWe'll just go ahead and\nwe'll have it run as soon as we're done.\n\n175\n00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.368\nBut under advanced options, stop all\nrunning runbooks that may be running\n\n176\n00:07:55.368 --> 00:07:57.606\nbefore we actually stop\nthem from running so\n\n177\n00:07:57.606 --> 00:08:02.310\nthat they don't run while we're trying\nto do the installer they'll runaway.\n\n178\n00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.920\nTry to say that three times fast.\n\n179\n00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.020\nWhat I mean very simply is the following.\n\n180\n00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.250\nWe want to be able to go in and\nif we are actively using any runbooks,\n\n181\n00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.280\nwe wanna stop them so that as we\nbring in the new integration packs\n\n182\n00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.720\nall the various objects\nwill line up the right way.\n\n183\n00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.130\nWe're not gonna have any corruption or\nanything going on.\n\n184\n00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.826\nSo this is actually important you'll\nnotice the default setting is make sure we\n\n185\n00:08:23.826 --> 00:08:27.580\ndo stop any and all run books\nthat may be actively being used.\n\n186\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.115\nWe can also choose install\nthe integration pack hot fixes without\n\n187\n00:08:31.115 --> 00:08:34.722\nstopping the running runbooks but\nwe have to restart If we do that.\n\n188\n00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:38.768\nBecause we have to make sure that that\ninstantiation of all the object types,\n\n189\n00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:42.250\nthe definitions, and\nall the entries is done correctly.\n\n190\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.360\nSo you have an option here,\nit's up to you to decide.\n\n191\n00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.110\nWe're not gonna bother to say\nhey don't stop and then restart.\n\n192\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.570\nWe'll just go ahead and leave it at\nthe default and say stop everything,\n\n193\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.590\ncuz right now In the environment\nwe're not running any run books so\n\n194\n00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.070\nit's really not gonna matter to us.\n\n195\n00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.020\nBut in production you may not wanna\nactually restart the orchestrator server\n\n196\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.600\nand so this is something to consider and\nthink about.\n\n197\n00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.640\nSo we're gonna click next.\n\n198\n00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.990\nWe're gonna click finish.\n\n199\n00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.730\nGive this a minute.\n\n200\n00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.140\nYou can see it's deploying there.\n\n201\n00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.880\nDoes take a moment.\n\n202\n00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.676\nDoesn't take very long typically and\nyou can see once we've done that,\n\n203\n00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:21.942\nWe have our Runbook server down\nhere at the bottom under Servers.\n\n204\n00:09:21.942 --> 00:09:26.876\nJust move this over here, you'll see\nnow that we do successfully have our\n\n205\n00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:31.100\nops manager integration pack\navailable to us right there.\n\n206\n00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.392\nSo you see it was successfully deployed.\n\n207\n00:09:33.392 --> 00:09:34.798\nAnd that's how we would go in and\n\n208\n00:09:34.798 --> 00:09:36.840\nultimately tell that\nthe deployment worked.\n\n209\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.960\nWe could also go through the log\nfiles of course down below and\n\n210\n00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.350\nwe can see that we were\nsuccessful at deploying it.\n\n211\n00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.409\nWhat we will then be able to\ndo is be able to go in, and\n\n212\n00:09:45.409 --> 00:09:49.824\nin the run book designer be able to\ninteract with those items if we wanted to\n\n213\n00:09:49.824 --> 00:09:53.410\ngo in and see them and\nuse them to be able to create a runbook.\n\n214\n00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.845\nWe could certainly do that.\n\n215\n00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:57.815\nWe're gonna be talking about how\nto do that in a separate demo.\n\n216\n00:09:57.815 --> 00:09:59.821\nSo we're not gonna go in there and\nplay around right now.\n\n217\n00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:02.765\nBut at this point we would be set to go,\nright?\n\n218\n00:10:02.765 --> 00:10:04.801\nReally wouldn't have to worry\nabout doing anything else.\n\n219\n00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:06.929\nIf we have multiple integration packs,\n\n220\n00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:10.255\nwe would see them stacked up\nhere once we do the deployment.\n\n221\n00:10:10.255 --> 00:10:13.645\nLet's deploy one more, just so you could\nsee that it will pop in really time, or\n\n222\n00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:15.145\nclose to real time, while we're doing it.\n\n223\n00:10:15.145 --> 00:10:16.250\nSo we'll go back here.\n\n224\n00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.119\nRemember we do have,\none other integration pack we loaded.\n\n225\n00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.530\nThe service level manager one.\n\n226\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.810\nSo we can deploy that.\n\n227\n00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.150\nSo, let's just go ahead,\nwe'll right click one more time.\n\n228\n00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:31.630\nDo our deployment, go ahead and\nchoose our service manager to that one.\n\n229\n00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:39.201\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll do this plabsys01 and click Next.\n\n230\n00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:40.786\nDid I not type that correctly?\n\n231\n00:10:40.786 --> 00:10:41.415\nOne second.\n\n232\n00:10:45.966 --> 00:10:51.150\nI think I did forget to add.\n\n233\n00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.036\nThat's what I did I hit that and I did the\nthing I accuse everybody else of doing,\n\n234\n00:10:55.036 --> 00:10:56.433\nforgot to actually hit add.\n\n235\n00:10:56.433 --> 00:10:58.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go ahead, we'll do that.\n\n236\n00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.040\nWe'll do the stop all running click next,\nwe'll hit finish.\n\n237\n00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.730\nLet that go do its thing.\n\n238\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.350\nSoon as that kind of rolls back up.\n\n239\n00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.290\nComes over here, go here.\n\n240\n00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.826\nWe could see we now have two of them here.\n\n241\n00:11:09.826 --> 00:11:11.680\nAnd we can see they're both deployed.\n\n242\n00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.680\nAnd so we could see that immediately,\nas long as we're successful,\n\n243\n00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.624\nshows up right away.\n\n244\n00:11:15.624 --> 00:11:16.328\nPretty straightforward.\n\n245\n00:11:16.328 --> 00:11:17.710\n&gt;&gt; Yes, very straightforward.\n\n246\n00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.230\nVery easy, actually.\n\n247\n00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.578\nI love the way that\nMicrosoft always tries to.\n\n248\n00:11:21.578 --> 00:11:26.040\nEven though their systems can be complex,\nusually doing things like installation and\n\n249\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.500\nconfiguring, or installing or\ndoing something like that,\n\n250\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.800\ntheir wizards do an amazing job\nof making it pretty painless.\n\n251\n00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.544\nAnd this was no exception to that rule.\n\n252\n00:11:35.544 --> 00:11:39.620\nYou get to your packs from wherever you\nlike, Install them, integrate them,\n\n253\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.220\nget them going, very simple pick out the\none you want and you're off to the races.\n\n254\n00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.200\nThat being said Adam,\nanything else you wanna add to this?\n\n255\n00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.600\n&gt;&gt; Yep, one more thing just real quick, I\nactually had it highlighted when

one\nother thing, I just wanted to show you,\n\n258\n00:11:55.187 --> 00:11:57.260\nyou can right click on these\npacks once they're installed.\n\n259\n00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.020\nAnd if we do decide we want to uninstall\nthem, it's very simple to do that.\n\n260\n00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.309\nWe just use the uninstall.\n\n261\n00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:04.550\nYou can see right click there,\nwe have that option.\n\n262\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.090\nSo let's just click on the service\nlevel of the manager you want.\n\n263\n00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.770\nYou'll see, we uninstall.\n\n264\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.318\nConfirm here, you're really sure you,\nyou wanna do this, click OK and\n\n265\n00:12:12.318 --> 00:12:14.585\nthat management pack disappears.\n\n266\n00:12:14.585 --> 00:12:15.382\nNothing more involved.\n\n267\n00:12:15.382 --> 00:12:16.561\n&gt;&gt; Like magic, right everyone?\n\n268\n00:12:16.561 --> 00:12:18.161\nAnd it's gone.\n\n269\n00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:21.021\n&gt;&gt; Just close your eyes,\n[CROSSTALK] pretend it never existed.\n\n270\n00:12:21.021 --> 00:12:23.478\nSo it just comes and goes, just like that.\n\n271\n00:12:23.478 --> 00:12:26.429\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Adam thanks for\njoining us today, thanks for\n\n272\n00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:29.735\nshowing us how to install our\nintegration

[LAUGH] That's bad.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That is bad.\n\n50\n00:02:02.384 --> 00:02:06.122\nReminding you the fact we do have\nthe enable this connector check box there.\n\n51\n00:02:06.122 --> 00:02:09.530\nRemember in a prior episode,\nif you haven't seen it, go check it out.\n\n52\n00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.700\nReal quick, we did show you how\nto enable and disable connectors.\n\n53\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.940\nYou do it while we're installing,\n\n54\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.310\nyou could right-click on the connector\nafter the fact, choose Enable and Disable.\n\n55\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.310\nSo, it's fairly easy to do.\n\n56\n00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.140\nDaniel chimed in and said, well, you could\nalso delete them and reinstall them,\n\n57\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.960\nbut probably [LAUGH] don't wanna be doing\nthat too often if we can avoid that.\n\n58\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.706\nSo, now Select a domain or organisation\nyou are going to remember this is the AD\n\n59\n00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:35.050\nconnector,where are we going to get his\nstuff and what we are going to bring in.\n\n60\n00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.402\nSO specify what ADOU or what AD domain and\nADOU we are connect to use the domain\n\n61\n00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:43.890\nthat specifies our domain practice\nlabs.com, or let me choose the domain and\n\n62\n00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.358\nthen we can go out and\nbrowse if we have more then one and then,\n\n63\n00:02:47.358 --> 00:02:50.559\ncredentials again we've got\nour run as account there.\n\n64\n00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:55.411\nGonna go ahead and test that out\nreal quick, put in our password,\n\n65\n00:02:55.411 --> 00:03:00.895\nspecify that that goes out, we were\nsuccessful, gonna click OK on that.\n\n66\n00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:05.738\nGonna go ahead and we're gonna click Next,\nwe then have to specify what objects,\n\n67\n00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:06.801\nSelect objects.\n\n68\n00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:08.685\nWhat objects do we wanna bring in?\n\n69\n00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:13.365\nRemember, the Active Directory\nis just chock full of objects.\n\n70\n00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:16.865\nUsers, computers, groups, printers.\n\n71\n00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:21.225\nEverything you can right-click create\nnew from a menu item, another OU.\n\n72\n00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:22.755\nAll those things are all objects.\n\n73\n00:03:22.755 --> 00:03:26.125\nSo, you'll see all computers,\nprinters, users, and user groups.\n\n74\n00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:30.995\nOr we can specify, select individual\ncomputers, and/or, users, or user groups.\n\n75\n00:03:30.995 --> 00:03:32.375\nYou'll see we pulled that down.\n\n76\n00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:34.960\nGot a little add capability here.\n\n77\n00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.500\nAdd users or user groups,\nadd computers, add printers.\n\n78\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.460\nSo we can go in, specify that.\n\n79\n00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.210\nGot a little browse area there, where\nyou can grab something in particular.\n\n80\n00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.260\nWe're just gonna do a full import, but\nif you wanted to go in selectively and\n\n81\n00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.730\ndo that, we could bring them in.\n\n82\n00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.560\nSo I just wanted to show you that,\nlet's go ahead and get out of there.\n\n83\n00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.930\nLet's get out of there.\n\n84\n00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.280\nBring that back up, let's just do all so\nwe'll bring them all in, pretty simple.\n\n85\n00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.390\nAutomatically add AD users or add users\nof AD groups imported by this connector.\n\n86\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.650\nSo if we check that off, we're gonna add\nthose users in the service manager and\n\n87\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.170\nhave them available so we can work with\nthem, assign them rights to do things etc.\n\n88\n00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.130\nAgain we talked about\nthe Do Not Write No Value Properties item.\n\n89\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.400\nWe did that in one of the prior demos.\n\n90\n00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.390\nWe talked about that.\n\n91\n00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.160\nSo I'm gonna automatically add those in.\n\n92\n00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.490\nGonna click Next here.\n\n93\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.860\nWe're gonna go ahead,\ngonna click Create, gonna let that run.\n\n94\n00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.939\nAm I the only one that thinks\nthat that's like the Cylon.\n\n95\n00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.001\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] That was funny.\n\n96\n00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:30.714\n&gt;&gt; Pull a Battlestar Galactica.\n\n97\n00:04:30.714 --> 00:04:33.168\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n98\n00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:35.566\nit would be the red one going back for it.\n\n99\n00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:40.560\nNow, if you could do the cool Cylon voice,\nwhile you are doing the Smeagol.\n\n100\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.173\n&gt;&gt; The Smeagol.\n\n101\n00:04:41.173 --> 00:04:41.708\n&gt;&gt; Boys.\n\n102\n00:04:41.708 --> 00:04:46.841\nSmeagol cylon, then sir I would actually,\nI would be an.\n\n103\n00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:50.385\n&gt;&gt; I think that it would probably\ndestroy my person, to do that.\n\n104\n00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:51.712\n&gt;&gt; I think you would kill [INAUDIBLE].\n\n105\n00:04:51.712 --> 00:04:53.062\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My throat is hurting just thinking\n\n106\n00:04:53.062 --> 00:04:53.973\nabout it, personally.\n\n107\n00:04:53.973 --> 00:04:56.572\nBut if you could do that,\nthat would be like- [LAUGH]\n\n108\n00:04:56.572 --> 00:04:57.947\n&gt;&gt; Wicked cool.\n\n109\n00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:01.808\nThat would almost be as cool as\nhaving your own life size R2D2, and\n\n110\n00:05:01.808 --> 00:05:03.442\nbuilding a life size C3PO.\n\n111\n00:05:03.442 --> 00:05:04.121\n&gt;&gt; I would agree with that.\n\n112\n00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:05.062\n&gt;&gt; It would be almost as cool, almost.\n\n113\n00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:05.621\n&gt;&gt; Not quite as cool.\n\n114\n00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:08.141\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Just a hair less.\n\n115\n00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.158\n&gt;&gt; You got to push it over the threshold.\n\n116\n00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:12.037\n&gt;&gt; Because that is just even\ncooler than what you would do.\n\n117\n00:05:12.037 --> 00:05:13.150\n&gt;&gt; That's the coolest.\n\n118\n00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.027\n&gt;&gt; That is the coolest thing.\n\n119\n00:05:14.027 --> 00:05:14.601\nSo we are done.\n\n120\n00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:17.310\nLet us take a look here,\nwe're gonna click Close.\n\n121\n00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.420\nAnd we have our AD connector right there.\n\n122\n00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.536\nAnd you can see that,\nyou'll see that we can as we talked about,\n\n123\n00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:28.117\nhighlight the connector, come over\nhere disabled if we chose to do that,\n\n124\n00:05:28.117 --> 00:05:31.928\nwouldn't be hard to go on and disable that\nand you could see the we're then able\n\n125\n00:05:31.928 --> 00:05:34.990\nto work with their have all three\nconnectors available to us.\n\n126\n00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.258\nSo, going out configuring that connector,\nnot very difficult to do.\n\n127\n00:05:38.258 --> 00:05:44.030\nOnce we've got all that set up,\nwe're set and ready to go as they say.\n\n128\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.180\n&gt;&gt; Well you weren't kidding around it was\na pretty quick process nothing to it,\n\n129\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.980\na very simple, very straightforward and\nnow we're able to\n\n130\n00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.210\nmanipulate our Active Directory, inside\nof this wonderful environment of SCOM.\n\n131\n00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.260\nThanks to Adam for\nshowing us how we can do that.\n\n132\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.820\nWe thank you good folks for watching, but\nlike we said, it's a short episode for\n\n133\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.640\ntoday.\n\n134\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.448\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n135\n00:06:03.448 --> 00:06:04.060\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.512\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.512 --> 00:00:12.273\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:13.687\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.687 --> 00:00:16.742\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:20.751\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are coming back at you\n\n8\n00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:24.560\nwith more of our data center\nmonitoring with Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.230\nAnd of course,\njoining us in the studio again to lend his\n\n10\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.440\nexpertise on that very topic,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.450\nAdam, welcome back sir and\nwe're glad to have you yet again.\n\n12\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.140\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.390\n&gt;&gt; Awesomely terrific,\nsplendorifically outstandingly marginal.\n\n14\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.697\n&gt;&gt; Can you hold it down a little bit?\n\n15\n00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:44.749\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to be constrained and just\nreserved, but I was getting excited there\n\n16\n00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.380\nfor a minute then I pulled back,\nand now I'm just bland.\n\n17\n00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.951\nSo we're gonna continue talking.\n\n18\n00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:53.762\nWe are here to talk about tuning,\ntroubleshooting, and this crazy old\n\n19\n00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:58.350\nacronym, something about BC and DRN, and\nwho knows what the heck that's all about.\n\n20\n00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.360\nWe're gonna talk about\na little bit of each.\n\n21\n00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.330\nWe're gonna take you through\nsome different areas of scum.\n\n22\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.650\nTalk about some methodologies, thought\nprocesses, TEP, [LAUGH] TEP things.\n\n23\n00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.260\nI was gonna say techniques and/or tips or\nboth, but, tips and techniques.\n\n24\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.440\nI want to talk about some things that,\na lot of them are common knowledge.\n\n25\n00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.630\nYou could easily figure out where\nlogs are, things like that.\n\n26\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.180\nBut, you may not necessarily know,\n\n27\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.990\nespecially if you don't go\nlooking very often for them.\n\n28\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.400\nAnd, I get this question a lot.\n\n29\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.900\nHey, I need to troubleshoot.\n\n30\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.730\nI could probably just go search for\nanything with the word log in it, and\n\n31\n00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.660\neventually I'll find it.\n\n32\n00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.430\nBut, where do we store logs?\n\n33\n00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.900\nAre they in the same place all the time?\n\n34\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.530\nSo, we're gonna show\nyou some of that stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.320\nWe'll talk about the different\nlog files that SCOM traditionally\n\n36\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.070\ncreates in the server side.\n\n37\n00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.790\nWe got agent side logs,\ntalk about those as well.\n\n38\n00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.640\nWe'll take a look at and\n\n39\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.360\ntalk a little bit about the way in\nwhich we turn on debug logging.\n\n40\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.060\nWe've got a little thing we've\ngotta run in order to do that,\n\n41\n00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.810\nso we'll take a look at that, talk about\nsome different odds and ends there.\n\n42\n00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.140\nAnd we'll just kind of continue\non along the way we've shown you\n\n43\n00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.130\nsome of these bits and pieces and\nparts in other episodes.\n\n44\n00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.666\nWe've talked about database grooming\nbefore, how to set the retention periods\n\n45\n00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:06.477\nfor data, where to take a look at\nsome different ways to do that.\n\n46\n00:02:06.477 --> 00:02:09.735\nBut we've introduced\na lot of these concepts.\n\n47\n00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:12.455\nWe're just gonna bring them all\nback together here and kinda\n\n48\n00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:15.885\nbring them into one place where you can\nthen easily refer to them if you need to.\n\n49\n00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:20.005\nSo if you join me over here for\njust a second, or up over there.\n\n50\n00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:21.631\nI got that right the first time finally.\n\n51\n00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:22.669\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you did.\n\n52\n00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.285\n&gt;&gt; That was awesome,\nthat deserves a disembodied high five.\n\n53\n00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:27.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, right there.\n\n54\n00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.610\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go ahead and\n\n55\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.630\nwe're gonna start off by talking about\nlog files as I was just mentioning.\n\n56\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.290\nSo one of the interesting things about\nSCOM is that unlike a lot of other\n\n57\n00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.130\nproducts where it stores the log files,\nlet's say directly in an install\n\n58\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.770\ndirectory, program files system\ncenter whatever, whatever, whatever.\n\n59\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.860\nThis product it's always\ngotta be different right?\n\n60\n00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.420\nStores them up under your user profile and\nthen through that whole solution.\n\n61\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.390\nSo we've got users and then you know\nin the traditional windows environment\n\n62\n00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.120\nyou're gonna have, and then maybe we can\ngo full screen just so you can see it.\n\n63\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.486\nI highlighted the path, I don't know if\nit's gonna be any clearer for you, but\n\n64\n00:03:00.486 --> 00:03:02.911\nlet me just click down away\nfrom it here for just a second.\n\n65\n00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:06.921\nYou'll see we have C:\\Users and\nthen the user name,\n\n66\n00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:09.870\nplaceholder right in the show notes.\n\n67\n00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.300\nWe just put the placeholder in for\nyou for user names.\n\n68\n00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.950\nBut on the administrator and\nthe practice labs domain, log on here so\n\n69\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:16.950\nyou can see that.\n\n70\n00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.020\nThen we have app data,\nlocal SCOM and logs.\n\n71\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.060\nAnd you probably know app data is\none of those hidden files, or hidden\n\n72\n00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.770\nfolders rather, so you've got to go in and\nturn that on to be able to see the logs.\n\n73\n00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.550\nSo we don't make it easy for you to find\nthem, so you wanna know where they are.\n\n74\n00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.550\nAlthough this is gonna be on\nthe Ops Manager server itself.\n\n75\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.610\nWe've got all the different logs here,\nlet me just do this and\n\n76\n00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.940\nsort them back the way\nthey were a moment ago.\n\n77\n00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.820\nWe've got the full pre-req check log,\n\n78\n00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.540\nwe have the OM console log here,\nOM reporting is in ops manager.\n\n79\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.300\nWe've got OM server, the setup wizard,\n\n80\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.340\ngot the pre-req checked,\nwe've got set up logs iterated, right?\n\n81\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.870\nSo yeah, but number iterating\nthrough them, we've got each log.\n\n82\n00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.710\nFor set up, when we run it or\ndo various aspects of it.\n\n83\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.020\nWe've got a web console log here as well,\nthat one's actually fairly big.\n\n84\n00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.422\nI know it's hard to see cuz it's\ncovered by the box-in-box, but\n\n85\n00:04:06.422 --> 00:04:08.160\nat the bottom you can see.\n\n86\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.018\nWe can go full screen, that's good,\nI was just gonna sort by name,\n\n87\n00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:12.470\nbring it back up to the top.\n\n88\n00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.790\nBut what you can see is it's,\nof all the logs,\n\n89\n00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.990\nit's gonna be one of the bigger ones.\n\n90\n00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.080\nThis one and the ops manager set up\nwizard are actually the two biggest logs\n\n91\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.910\nright now, at almost 7,000 kilobytes.\n\n92\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.280\nI would convert that into gigabytes,\nbut we tried that one time and\n\n93\n00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.830\nit didn't work real well, if you remember.\n\n94\n00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.810\nI wound up with gigabytes\nwhen I meant megabytes and\n\n95\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.294\nI'm not even gonna bother with that.\n\n96\n00:04:29.294 --> 00:04:32.807\nBut you can see it is a fairly large\nlog by comparison, many of the others,\n\n97\n00:04:32.807 --> 00:04:34.010\nthey're really small.\n\n98\n00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.430\nSo you can see, and all these are standard\nlog files or text files, right?\n\n99\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.790\nSo if we go in, we take a look,\nlet's pick one that's relatively small,\n\n100\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.060\nlet's just look at our setup log here.\n\n101\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.730\nIf we just do a quick open, it opens up.\n\n102\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.460\nPretty straightforward log format,\nnothing fancy, Notepad.\n\n103\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.740\nAnd we can see all sorts\nof different stuff in here.\n\n104\n00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.158\nIt's just telling us what it's doing and\nhow it's doing it as it breaks it down.\n\n105\n00:04:55.158 --> 00:04:58.050\nSo you may wanna go and\ntake a look for log files there.\n\n106\n00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.020\nIt's gonna be important to know where\nthey are in case something comes up,\n\n107\n00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.400\nyou gotta do a little troubleshooting.\n\n108\n00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.900\nAlways good to have a sense of that and\nknow where they may be.\n\n109\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.240\nAgent logs,\nI talked about that a little bit as well.\n\n110\n00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.226\nWhen the agent's installed\non a computer and\n\n111\n00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.638\nthen linked back to be managed by SCOM,\nremember now?\n\n112\n00:05:12.638 --> 00:05:17.293\nLittle Microsoft monitoring agent, when we\nsee that, we're gonna have the Ops Manager\n\n113\n00:05:17.293 --> 00:05:20.100\nsetup wizard log file, and\nit's gonna get created.\n\n114\n00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.110\nIt will be also in C users,\nusername app data local SCOM logs,\n\n115\n00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.290\nand we'll have information\nabout the install.\n\n116\n00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.410\nThat's where those setup\nlogs were actually seeing\n\n117\n00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.780\nin the log file that I just\nshowed you are coming from.\n\n118\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.820\nBut if we deploy using a console, so\nif we actually deploy using a push method.\n\n119\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.130\nThen what we're gonna get is\nadditional log files that get created\n\n120\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.450\nin the root of the actual program folder,\na directory for SCOM.\n\n121\n00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.737\nAnd so what we would do is we'll go in and\n\n122\n00:05:45.737 --> 00:05:47.297\nwe'll take a look at this real quick,\nas well.\n\n123\n00:05:47.297 --> 00:05:49.500\nLet me just bring this up here.\n\n124\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.595\nI don't have any logs in\nthe folder I'm about to show you,\n\n125\n00:05:52.595 --> 00:05:54.710\ncuz I haven't done a push installation for\n\n126\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.450\nan agent out of this particular\niteration of our demo environment..\n\n127\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.887\nWe tend to reset them a lot of the times\nin between the time to see us using them.\n\n128\n00:06:01.887 --> 00:06:04.540\nAnd I haven't bothered to do\na client push out of this.\n\n129\n00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.390\nBut I'll show you where you would look.\n\n130\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.410\nIt's just that it's going to be empty.\n\n131\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.202\nJust so you know when we get there.\n\n132\n00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.540\nAll right, so we're going to go in here.\n\n133\n00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.087\nWe'll go to C.\n\n134\n00:06:11.087 --> 00:06:13.680\nSo we'll start back in the root here.\n\n135\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.900\nWe're going to go to Program Files.\n\n136\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.880\nAnd inside Program Files we're going to\ngo in and go to Microsoft System Center,\n\n137\n00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.080\n22R2, right there.\n\n138\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.800\nGoing to go to Ops Manager, and inside\nOps Manager we're going to go in and\n\n139\n00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.025\nwe're going to go to, server.\n\n140\n00:06:28.025 --> 00:06:30.395\nAnd then in server,\nwe're gonna do AgentManaged.\n\n141\n00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:32.875\nAnd in AgentManaged,\nyou'll see we have AgentLogs.\n\n142\n00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:34.305\nRight now there's nothing in there.\n\n143\n00:06:34.305 --> 00:06:37.025\nBut this is the path\nwe would go find logs,\n\n144\n00:06:37.025 --> 00:06:41.405\nadditional logs for if we actually have\ndone client push installs for the Agent.\n\n145\n00:06:41.405 --> 00:06:43.805\nWe'd have three logs that\nwould be sitting in there,\n\n146\n00:06:43.805 --> 00:06:47.065\nwhatever the company name would be would\nalways be attached to the front of this.\n\n147\n00:06:47.065 --> 00:06:49.025\nSo we'd have, let's just call it SCOM.\n\n148\n00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:54.401\nSo we'd have SCOM agentinstall.log\nSCOM agentpatch.log and\n\n149\n00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:59.180\nSCOM momagent MGMT,\nshort for management, .log.\n\n150\n00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.260\nAll three of those would\nbe sitting in there and\n\n151\n00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.690\nwe would see those as well if we were\nactually doing a push of some kind.\n\n152\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.150\nWe've talked about different\nways to do client installs.\n\n153\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.220\nWe do a client push install,\ndirectly from the console.\n\n154\n00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.060\nWe talked MOM, not my mother.\n\n155\n00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.900\nWe talked about using, in addition to\nthe client push, a manual install.\n\n156\n00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.790\nAnd we could do that, have that\neither pre approved or in a pending.\n\n157\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.125\nWe talked about how to set that up.\n\n158\n00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:25.798\nRemember we have to enable\nthe pending status, and\n\n159\n00:07:25.798 --> 00:07:29.960\nthe ability to do manual installs and\nhave them go to the pending category.\n\n160\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.270\nBy going to the administration workspace\nright down here, and then going in and\n\n161\n00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.290\nmodifying that setting.\n\n162\n00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.510\nAnd we talked about that and\nhow that would be done.\n\n163\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.430\nSo I've shown you that in a prior\nepisode just to remind you of that.\n\n164\n00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.090\nWe've also talked about the need\nto enable debug trace logging,\n\n165\n00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.470\nI mentioned it as we were\njust getting started.\n\n166\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.014\nWe're gonna run and\nuse debug trace logging.\n\n167\n00:07:50.014 --> 00:07:54.343\nWe have to use the start\ntracing command script there.\n\n168\n00:07:54.343 --> 00:07:57.158\nYou'll see I just did a search for\nit to show you where you would find it.\n\n169\n00:07:57.158 --> 00:08:04.279\nAnd StarTracing command script is\ngoing to be part of the install.\n\n170\n00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:07.803\nLet's take a look here,\nyou'll see it's simple.\n\n171\n00:08:07.803 --> 00:08:11.722\nWe've got our properties there\nin the system center 2012 R2.\n\n172\n00:08:11.722 --> 00:08:16.527\nAnd you'll see consult tools\ndirectory pop up right there.\n\n173\n00:08:16.527 --> 00:08:18.980\nAnd we'll find that,\nactually opened that up just so\n\n174\n00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.490\nwe could take a look at it real quick.\n\n175\n00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.630\nAnd when you go down in here,\n\n176\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.600\njust make this, this is gonna\nbe the script that is used for\n\n177\n00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.120\nthe command script that is used to be able\nto enable debug trace logging, turn it on.\n\n178\n00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.166\nSo that way, we are able to run it and\nwhen we set up debug trace logging,\n\n179\n00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:38.010\nwe afford different log in\nlevels that we can use.\n\n180\n00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.240\nWe have error details,\nso it is called ERR.\n\n181\n00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.345\nWe have warning details,\nWRN is the shortened acronym of that.\n\n182\n00:08:46.345 --> 00:08:49.993\nWe have verbose, VER, and\nwe have informational, INF.\n\n183\n00:08:49.993 --> 00:08:53.535\nSo we have the four different\nlevels we can specify with logging.\n\n184\n00:08:53.535 --> 00:08:56.335\nAnd so you run through and\nyou specify this with\n\n185\n00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:59.747\nthe appropriate switch to be able to\nspecify what level of logging you want.\n\n186\n00:08:59.747 --> 00:09:01.147\nWhen we enable it,\n\n187\n00:09:01.147 --> 00:09:06.842\nour debug log files are then gonna be\nwritten into Windows logs OpsMgrTrace.\n\n188\n00:09:06.842 --> 00:09:08.776\nSo you will go into Windows, go to Logs.\n\n189\n00:09:08.776 --> 00:09:15.463\nLook for OpsMgrTrace, so if we go in and\nwe take a look real quick for that.\n\n190\n00:09:15.463 --> 00:09:21.006\nGo into C, go to Windows and\ninside Windows, there we go.\n\n191\n00:09:21.006 --> 00:09:25.082\nWe're gonna go in and\nwe're going to go down to Logs.\n\n192\n00:09:25.082 --> 00:09:29.215\nLet's just see where that is,\nright down here.\n\n193\n00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:34.230\nAnd inside Logs, OpsMgrTrace right there.\n\n194\n00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.917\nAnd we would get our log entries and\nour information as you can see there.\n\n195\n00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:40.946\nAnd we would be able to\ngo in from there and\n\n196\n00:09:40.946 --> 00:09:43.230\nwe would be able to\ninteract with those logs.\n\n197\n00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.700\nNow the logs are written\nout in an ETL format.\n\n198\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.030\nThese are performance logs by the way,\nfrom PerfMon, right?\n\n199\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:54.348\nBut we would be able to get logs here,\n.etl is the extension.\n\n200\n00:09:54.348 --> 00:09:57.738\nWe would have to go in and\nwe would have to convert them, so\n\n201\n00:09:57.738 --> 00:10:00.151\nthat we could see them in the log viewer.\n\n202\n00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:03.036\nThere are viewers out there that\nwill do the conversion for you.\n\n203\n00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:06.617\nBut you would have to find a tool\nthat would let you take .etl and\n\n204\n00:10:06.617 --> 00:10:10.000\nconvert it over into a format\nthat could be opened up.\n\n205\n00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.800\nNotepad by itself in other words,\nwouldn't work.\n\n206\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.240\nYou would need an actual log viewing tool.\n\n207\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.196\nI think if I'm not mistaken, I don't\nremember so don't quote me on this one.\n\n208\n00:10:17.196 --> 00:10:20.485\nYou would have to try, I haven't tried\nit in a while, I just don't remember.\n\n209\n00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:25.226\nBut I think the SCCS log viewer on the Log\ntool there will actually work with\n\n210\n00:10:25.226 --> 00:10:28.230\nthe ETL files, you'll be able to use that.\n\n211\n00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.141\nI'd have to double check that,\nso I'm throwing that out there.\n\n212\n00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:34.222\nTotally disembodied statement that\nI'm not claiming responsibility for.\n\n213\n00:10:34.222 --> 00:10:37.109\nIf I'm right it was me, if I'm wrong it\nwas this gentleman standing right over\n\n214\n00:10:37.109 --> 00:10:39.138\nhere off screen [CROSSTALK]\nis the one you wanna talk to.\n\n215\n00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:40.217\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n216\n00:10:40.217 --> 00:10:43.547\nwanna make sure you send all\nthat information in to him.\n\n217\n00:10:43.547 --> 00:10:46.160\nI'm just giving you a suggestion\nas I said, totally disclaimer.\n\n218\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.440\nI'm not 100% sure that would work, because\nI haven't tried it in a very long time.\n\n219\n00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.120\nI don't remember if I was successful\nusing that tool or not, but\n\n220\n00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.950\nthere are many tools out there that\nwould certainly convert for ETL.\n\n221\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:01.363\n&gt;&gt; Now Adam when we're talking logs,\nwhen we're logging things like errors or\n\n222\n00:11:01.363 --> 00:11:05.443\nwarnings is it necessary that\nwe're gonna see a problem or\n\n223\n00:11:05.443 --> 00:11:07.791\nan error pop up with this device?\n\n224\n00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:10.706\nAnd then we're gonna go look at\nthose logs to see what it is, or\n\n225\n00:11:10.706 --> 00:11:12.725\nwe just gonna see some hinky activity, and\n\n226\n00:11:12.725 --> 00:11:15.324\nthen go to the logs to see if\nwe can discern what that is?\n\n227\n00:11:15.324 --> 00:11:15.833\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n228\n00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:17.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well there you go.\n\n229\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.445\n&gt;&gt; We may get both.\n\n230\n00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:22.460\nRemember, we've seen errors and alerts,\nand things like that in some of the demos.\n\n231\n00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.520\nCertainly shown them to you\nin the console over time.\n\n232\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.890\nWe do see the alerts showing up,\nin this com console, that's no problem.\n\n233\n00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.920\nWe've seen errors, done a couple things\nhere and there, created some errors,\n\n234\n00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.390\ntried to fix things on the fly.\n\n235\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.920\nSo we do see a bit of both\nas Daniel's suggesting.\n\n236\n00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.270\nWe may get indications that\nsomething's wrong and then go in and\n\n237\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.270\ndouble check a log to figure it out.\n\n238\n00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.600\nWe may not directly see\nevidence of the error.\n\n239\n00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.218\nIt may be logged, but it may not be\nan error that pops up on our radar so\n\n240\n00:11:47.218 --> 00:11:49.200\nto speak, and that we're aware of.\n\n241\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.180\nThe tool, it was just,\nit's a complicated tool.\n\n242\n00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.680\nSo there may be things that go real,\nreal well, and\n\n243\n00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.510\nthey generate informational items.\n\n244\n00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.010\nThere may be things that go really bad and\ngenerate errors,\n\n245\n00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.010\nand the obvious errors you get, right?\n\n246\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.160\nYou have things just stop working,\nwe know that.\n\n247\n00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.380\nThere may be errors that we\ncan essentially work through,\n\n248\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.850\nand that may not be problematic to\nthe point that they kill the system.\n\n249\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.300\nBut still may be important for\n\n250\n00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.240\nus to be aware of and so\nit would just be a mixture of things.\n\n251\n00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.790\nTypically you enter or set up debug trace\nlogging when you are having a problem.\n\n252\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.008\nYou're on the phone with\nsupport more often than not.\n\n253\n00:12:24.008 --> 00:12:27.094\nThey're trying to figure out\nwhat's going on with the console,\n\n254\n00:12:27.094 --> 00:12:29.000\nsomething's not working.\n\n255\n00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.464\nYou may set it up and run it if\nyou are a developer using the SDK\n\n256\n00:12:32.464 --> 00:12:36.150\nto be able to develop management packs or\ndo tracing for stuff.\n\n257\n00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.008\nWe talked about in the customization\nmanagement packs episode,\n\n258\n00:12:40.008 --> 00:12:44.494\nthat we can do our management pack\nauthoring in Visual Studio using the VSA,\n\n259\n00:12:44.494 --> 00:12:47.034\nthe Visual Studio Authoring extensions.\n\n260\n00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:50.791\nAnd we would do debug tracing there using\nthe ability to be able to figure out\n\n261\n00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:53.800\nwhat's going as we walk\nthrough the management pack.\n\n262\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.809\nSo we may have an ability\nto do it outside.\n\n263\n00:12:55.809 --> 00:13:00.066\nWe talked about IntelliTrace, and\nthe ability to be enable that and\n\n264\n00:13:00.066 --> 00:13:02.618\nhave that spin up work flow items for us.\n\n265\n00:13:02.618 --> 00:13:05.187\nAnd link back to items\nbeing listed in TFF and\n\n266\n00:13:05.187 --> 00:13:09.980\nteam foundation services through Visual\nStudio as another add on benefit thought\n\n267\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.629\nprocess that 12R2 bring subtable for us.\n\n268\n00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:16.077\nSo we have a lot of different\nways of potentially consuming and\n\n269\n00:13:16.077 --> 00:13:20.388\nseeing this information that either\nwe've highlighted in prior episodes or\n\n270\n00:13:20.388 --> 00:13:23.710\nwe at least are throwing out and\nreminding you of here.\n\n271\n00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.283\nSo there's definitely a lot of\nopportunity, let's put it that way.\n\n272\n00:13:26.283 --> 00:13:29.936\nIt would really depend on the nature of\nwhat the events are that we're tracking.\n\n273\n00:13:29.936 --> 00:13:31.870\nAnd then if it's\na significant enough error,\n\n274\n00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.863\nthen pretty traditional\nMicrosoft response.\n\n275\n00:13:33.863 --> 00:13:35.809\nEverything stops working, shut it off-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n276\n00:13:35.809 --> 00:13:37.996\n&gt;&gt; And you try again when things get\n\n277\n00:13:37.996 --> 00:13:39.217\na little better.\n\n278\n00:13:39.217 --> 00:13:42.740\nLet's talk about another little\nerror we wanna spend some time on.\n\n279\n00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.254\nWe've done a lot with PowerShell and\nthe Ops Manager console shell to show you\n\n280\n00:13:46.254 --> 00:13:49.948\ndifferent ways to integrate and use\nPowerShell throughout all of our episodes.\n\n281\n00:13:49.948 --> 00:13:52.885\nAnd gonna continue with that\nas we go through tuning,\n\n282\n00:13:52.885 --> 00:13:55.082\ntroubleshooting and a DCDR here.\n\n283\n00:13:55.082 --> 00:13:57.760\nI wanna show you that we can actually take\n\n284\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.360\na SCOM agent install the Microsoft\nManaging Agent and we can repair that.\n\n285\n00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.581\nNow we can do that from within the control\npanel in the GUI using the agent and\n\n286\n00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:10.078\ngo in and do it there, but\nwe can do it from PowerShell as well.\n\n287\n00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:11.151\nSo I thought I'd show you that, so\n\n288\n00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:12.744\nif you wanna take a look\nreal quick up on the screen.\n\n289\n00:14:12.744 --> 00:14:16.482\nGot a couple of little PowerShell\nscriptlets there or actually just cmdlets,\n\n290\n00:14:16.482 --> 00:14:17.880\nnot really scriptlets.\n\n291\n00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.821\nBut first one here,\nget-scomagent -dnsostname,\n\n292\n00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:25.408\nwhatever the dnshostname would be, and\nthen pipe that out to repair-scomagent.\n\n293\n00:14:25.408 --> 00:14:28.880\nSo whatever the machine is you want\nto target, that has the agent on it.\n\n294\n00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.260\nSo remember we've talked about\nthe value of the pipe before.\n\n295\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.220\nWhatever we do on the left is activity\nthat will get essentially executed,\n\n296\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.170\nwe'll get some sort of output for that.\n\n297\n00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.770\nGenerate a value, whatever it is.\n\n298\n00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.550\nTake that, move it across to\nthe right hand side of the line.\n\n299\n00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.549\nPiping implies take output from left,\n\n300\n00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:48.863\nprocess across an executor uses input on\nthe right and that's what we're gonna do.\n\n301\n00:14:48.863 --> 00:14:53.270\nWe're gonna take that machine name,\nadam01.itpro.tv.\n\n302\n00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.934\nPipe that as the value that we wanna\nrun repair-scomagent cmdlet against and\n\n303\n00:14:57.934 --> 00:14:59.807\nthen go and repair that agent.\n\n304\n00:14:59.807 --> 00:15:04.404\nAnd so that's what we're gonna be doing,\nif we execute that particular cmdlet.\n\n305\n00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.610\nSo would be good for\nus to be aware of that.\n\n306\n00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.420\nWe have a need to be\nable to repair the agent,\n\n307\n00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.040\nthis would be one of a couple\ndifferent ways we could do that.\n\n308\n00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.299\nWe also may wanna do some fine tuning.\n\n309\n00:15:14.299 --> 00:15:17.875\nWe talked about management packets before,\nall sorts of things that can go on there.\n\n310\n00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:21.567\nDid a pretty extensive discussion on some\nof the ways in which we can not only\n\n311\n00:15:21.567 --> 00:15:23.161\noptimize management packets.\n\n312\n00:15:23.161 --> 00:15:27.316\nBut actually can create our own and\nthen throw a whole bunch of stuff in it.\n\n313\n00:15:27.316 --> 00:15:29.950\nShowed you the difference\nbetween unsealed and sealed.\n\n314\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.739\nTalked about the ways in which we\ncan export management packets,\n\n315\n00:15:32.739 --> 00:15:35.031\nboth through the console\nas well as with PowerShell.\n\n316\n00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:37.553\nDid a demonstration to\nshow you how to do both.\n\n317\n00:15:37.553 --> 00:15:39.954\nSo we've done all that\nin some prior episodes.\n\n318\n00:15:39.954 --> 00:15:43.765\nOne of the things I just wanted to bring\nup here with this second PowerShell\n\n319\n00:15:43.765 --> 00:15:46.330\ncommand line, is the get SCOM rule cmdlet.\n\n320\n00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.656\nWe specify whatever the name is,\nso the name parameter.\n\n321\n00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:51.970\nYou can see we have a little string\nthere with some wildcards so\n\n322\n00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.150\nwhatever, something data something.\n\n323\n00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:58.590\nSo whatever has data in it,\nWe'll take that, pipe those outputs out to\n\n324\n00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:04.230\nthe get-scom override commandlet with an\nerroraction parameter of silentlycontinue.\n\n325\n00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.380\nSo we'll get an error, we'll keep going\nthrough the lists, where we were,\n\n326\n00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.880\none of the ways we're talking\nabout dealing with errors before.\n\n327\n00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.160\nThis will allow us to look at\nall the overrides that have been\n\n328\n00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.300\napplied to a management pack or\nseries of management packs,\n\n329\n00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.370\nwhatever we specify the name would be.\n\n330\n00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.940\nAnd this then allows us to go in and\n\n331\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.010\nto have an authoritative\nlist of all the overrides.\n\n332\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.630\nIf you remember our matters from\npat conversations, overrides\n\n333\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.150\nare what we use to be able to take\na sealed management pack from a vendor.\n\n334\n00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.090\nAnd create our additional\nchanges that we're gonna apply,\n\n335\n00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.490\nalmost like transforms on\ntop of that management pack.\n\n336\n00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.140\nSo that we can customize it,\nand that's what we do.\n\n337\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.480\nWe create overrides that allow us to\nchange values in the management pack\n\n338\n00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.790\nby saving them outside of\nthe management pack and applying them.\n\n339\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.850\nAnd so overrides are important for us to\nbe aware of because we may have a need\n\n340\n00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.290\nto be able to work with these overrides or\nbe aware of the fact they're there.\n\n341\n00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.549\nAnd we may get lost in the shuffle,\nliterally,\n\n342\n00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:59.482\nwith all the different things going on.\n\n343\n00:16:59.482 --> 00:17:01.912\nWith all the management packs we have,\nit may be real tough for\n\n344\n00:17:01.912 --> 00:17:04.860\nus to tell how many overrides have\nbeen created and where they are.\n\n345\n00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.910\nAnd this will give us an authoritative\nlist, so it will be helpful for\n\n346\n00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.230\nus just to be aware of that.\n\n347\n00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.945\nSo it's just some little tips and\ntricks, odds and ends, if you will,\n\n348\n00:17:11.945 --> 00:17:13.227\nthat are available to us in here.\n\n349\n00:17:13.227 --> 00:17:16.975\nLet me just make sure that our\ncounter on our lab time is continuing\n\n350\n00:17:16.975 --> 00:17:19.155\nto stay accurate for us, so that way,\n\n351\n00:17:19.155 --> 00:17:23.020\nwe can continue to access\nthe system while we're talking.\n\n352\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.010\nOne of the other things we wanna spend\na little time on is the idea of, hey,\n\n353\n00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.930\nwhat do we do on the backend\nwith our databases, right?\n\n354\n00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.550\nWe talked a bit about the tuning piece.\n\n355\n00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.570\nWe talked a bit about\nthe troubleshooting piece.\n\n356\n00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.490\nNow we gotta talk a bit about\nthe whole BCDR piece, right?\n\n357\n00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.900\nSo, how do we deal with\ndatabases on the backend?\n\n358\n00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.420\nHow do we ensure high availability?\n\n359\n00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.600\nIn other words, how do we make sure\nthat our data's gonna be protected?\n\n360\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.710\nWe got this great technology with\nSQL these days called always on\n\n361\n00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.130\nthat we could be using, we should be\nusing for the Ops Manager System.\n\n362\n00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.280\nSo this is high availability\nprotection that we can enable with SQL,\n\n363\n00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.770\nthe Ops database itself.\n\n364\n00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.100\nSo the operational database,\nthe data warehouse database, and\n\n365\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.050\nif we're doing ACS,\nif we're doing Auto Collection Services,\n\n366\n00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.410\nour ACS databases would\nalso be protected here.\n\n367\n00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.180\nBeing able to go in and\n\n368\n00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.380\nset up the always on availability\ngroups is not too difficult.\n\n369\n00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.130\nLet me just give you a quick\nlittle heads up here.\n\n370\n00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.055\nWe can go to my machine and take a look.\n\n371\n00:18:14.055 --> 00:18:17.577\nWe do have some guidance on the web as we\nhave been seeing throughout all of our\n\n372\n00:18:17.577 --> 00:18:21.480\nepisodes, very valuable information\nMicrosoft's making available for us.\n\n373\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.480\nSo we got a little how to\nwith an overview here.\n\n374\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.280\nSo how do we go in and set this up?\n\n375\n00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.450\nThis does require a little bit\nof knowledge on the backend\n\n376\n00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:30.760\nof the SQL environment.\n\n377\n00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.470\nIf you're not familiar with SQL, if\nyou're not, let's say, a Microsoft DBA or\n\n378\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.950\ndon't work with SQL, you may wanna\ntake a break here for a minute,\n\n379\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.340\nsay okay, should I attempt this myself?\n\n380\n00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.210\nAbsolutely, if it's\nsomebody else's database.\n\n381\n00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.810\nBut if it's your own, right, that was\na joke by the way, you should laugh.\n\n382\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.618\nDon't ever do this on anybody's database,\nall kidding aside.\n\n383\n00:18:47.618 --> 00:18:50.772\nUnless you understand what you're doing,\nand the reason I'm pausing here and\n\n384\n00:18:50.772 --> 00:18:52.620\ntelling you, you may wanna take a break.\n\n385\n00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.566\nThink about whether this is something you\nwanna actually take on, or maybe go out\n\n386\n00:18:56.566 --> 00:19:00.585\nand get the help of a DBA, somebody who's\nmanaging the databases on the backend.\n\n387\n00:19:00.585 --> 00:19:05.270\nIf you're an army of one, right,\nif that's you, then yeah, absolutely.\n\n388\n00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.140\nGo sit down, take a look at this,\nfigure it out.\n\n389\n00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.030\nIf it's not already enabled,\ngo enable it, and you'll be fine.\n\n390\n00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.348\nAnd I'm not suggesting that you\nshouldn't learn how to do it.\n\n391\n00:19:13.348 --> 00:19:17.240\nI'm not suggesting that you cannot do\nit if you've never done it before.\n\n392\n00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.020\nI'm just pointing out that if you don't\nwork with SQL on a regular basis and\n\n393\n00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.510\nyou're not comfortable with\nthe structure and the form and\n\n394\n00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.980\nthe administration,\nit can be a little imposing.\n\n395\n00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.373\nAnd if you're not familiar with what\nto do, you don't want your on the job\n\n396\n00:19:30.373 --> 00:19:33.738\ntraining first time out to be the time\nyou try to set this up the right way.\n\n397\n00:19:33.738 --> 00:19:36.945\nAnd then it doesn't necessarily work,\nand then you gotta go back and\n\n398\n00:19:36.945 --> 00:19:38.670\nfigure out what went wrong, right?\n\n399\n00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.880\nSo practice a little bit offline,\nfigure it out, and\n\n400\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.070\nthen when you're good, you definitely\ngo in and set it up, no doubt about it.\n\n401\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:48.396\nBut read through the guidance here, right,\nit's not very difficult to do, all right,\n\n402\n00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:51.580\nand then once you've done that,\nyou'll be able to track through the logic.\n\n403\n00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.580\nSo let's just go back if we could, take\na look at what we're talking about here.\n\n404\n00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.128\nSo making sure we have always\non supported Ops Manager.\n\n405\n00:19:57.128 --> 00:20:01.237\nDatabases, talk about three databases that\nwould be supported, how we go through and\n\n406\n00:20:01.237 --> 00:20:04.801\ndo this, pretty straightforward,\nnew management group installation.\n\n407\n00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:09.631\nBefore we install the management group or\nthe office manager into an availability\n\n408\n00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:13.710\ngroup, make sure we have just\nall the information necessary.\n\n409\n00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.550\nAfter we install the first\nmanagement server,\n\n410\n00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.380\nwe then just kind of go through and\njoin the existing one.\n\n411\n00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.900\nIt won't be very difficult to set up,\nyou just follow the steps here.\n\n412\n00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.990\nYou'll see we have some information\nabout specifically step by step,\n\n413\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.420\nI think it's about 11 steps in all,\nwhat we do to configure this.\n\n414\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.646\nThere are a couple of warning items here,\nhey, there's a known issue,\n\n415\n00:20:32.646 --> 00:20:35.860\nright, execution of user code and\n.NET frameworks disabled, so\n\n416\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.592\nenable or\nclear enable configuration options.\n\n417\n00:20:38.592 --> 00:20:40.903\nRight, you gotta make sure you're\njust aware of all the little dos and\n\n418\n00:20:40.903 --> 00:20:42.590\ndon'ts and take a look at that.\n\n419\n00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.010\nIf we have an existing management group,\nand we wanna enable this, again,\n\n420\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.830\njust go through, follow the logic here.\n\n421\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.930\nSo if you're installing clean and\nthen adding, versus already having\n\n422\n00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:54.010\nan existing one, just make sure you\ngo through and follow the steps.\n\n423\n00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:58.680\nOnce you go in, you're gonna be using\nSQL Manager, SQL Management Studio.\n\n424\n00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.200\nSo you'll go in, you'll find that,\nyou'll open that up.\n\n425\n00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.520\nYou'll then be able to go in and\nwork with the appropriate database.\n\n426\n00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.580\nYou have to have certain pre-reqs set up,\ncertain hardware and\n\n427\n00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.750\nsoftware requirements.\n\n428\n00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.360\nSo you're just gonna wanna make\nsure you're aware of all of that.\n\n429\n00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:19.215\nIn addition here, we do have a link\nright at the top of the page.\n\n430\n00:21:19.215 --> 00:21:20.343\nLet me click on that,\n\n431\n00:21:20.343 --> 00:21:24.299\nit gives you a little bit more just\nin-depth specificity around the always\n\n432\n00:21:24.299 --> 00:21:28.340\non availability groups themselves,\naway from SCOM just generically.\n\n433\n00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.060\nWhat are always on availability groups?\n\n434\n00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.090\nHow do they work?\n\n435\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.420\nRight, what are the benefits of them?\n\n436\n00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.430\nWhy do we need them?\n\n437\n00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.900\nSo again, this may be valuable for you to\ntake a look at, just to make sure you're\n\n438\n00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.720\ncomfortable with the ideas of how we set\nthis up and what we're gonna be doing.\n\n439\n00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.132\nIn order to ensure at least\none of the key pillars,\n\n440\n00:21:43.132 --> 00:21:46.752\none of the key mechanisms we're gonna\nuse to ensure that we're able to make\n\n441\n00:21:46.752 --> 00:21:49.349\nsure that our data is gonna be secure and\nsurvivable.\n\n442\n00:21:49.349 --> 00:21:53.375\nMost importantly, if we have a problem\nwith anything, anything goes wrong,\n\n443\n00:21:53.375 --> 00:21:57.590\nsomething doesn't work the right way,\nwe'll be able to survive that.\n\n444\n00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:02.060\nWe've also talked about configuring\ndata retention options in Ops Manager.\n\n445\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.880\nI've shown you how to go in and\ndo this from the Ops Manager side,\n\n446\n00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.672\nif you remember.\n\n447\n00:22:05.672 --> 00:22:08.670\nLet's just come in here to\nAdministration real quick.\n\n448\n00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.495\nJust come down here to Settings,\nopen this up.\n\n449\n00:22:11.495 --> 00:22:14.833\nWe have Database Grooming right here,\nwe can right click,\n\n450\n00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:19.660\ngo to Properties in the administration\nworkspace, and we have data retention.\n\n451\n00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.168\nBut remember,\nthis is on the Ops Manager database,\n\n452\n00:22:22.168 --> 00:22:25.410\nwe make that point right up here\nfrom the Ops Manager database.\n\n453\n00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.470\nThis is not the data warehouse database.\n\n454\n00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.250\nTo do the data retention for\n\n455\n00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:33.380\nthe warehouse database, we have to\nuse a slightly different method.\n\n456\n00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:40.300\nSo we can do data retention period and\nediting there inside the console.\n\n457\n00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.320\nWe can highlight some.\n\n458\n00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.000\nYou've seen me do some prior demos.\n\n459\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.870\nYou've also seem me do\nit through PowerShell.\n\n460\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.910\nI've shown you the commandlets to be\nable to go in and do this as well, but\n\n461\n00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:52.440\nwe also could use a tool\nspecific to the data warehouse.\n\n462\n00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:57.310\nI'm gonna show you just in a minute a tool\ncalled DW Data RP, so data warehouse,\n\n463\n00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:01.180\nDW, data warehouse DW Data RP, for\n\n464\n00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.730\nessentially data warehouse data\nretention policy, .exe tool.\n\n465\n00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.310\nI'm gonna show you where you find the\ntools, you gotta go out and look for it,\n\n466\n00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.930\ndownload it.\n\n467\n00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.737\nWe've already got a copy of it sitting\non the desktop, I'll show you that.\n\n468\n00:23:09.737 --> 00:23:12.780\nYou can find a little zip file,\npretty straightforward to use.\n\n469\n00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.430\nWe're also gonna talk about\nthe fact that you can go in with\n\n470\n00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.370\nSQL Server Management Studio and\n\n471\n00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.270\nedit the retention settings on\nthe data warehouse database itself.\n\n472\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.350\nBut doing it inside of the SQL Studio\ncan be a little bit involved.\n\n473\n00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.990\nLet's just take a look\nat what I mean here.\n\n474\n00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.100\nSo, give me just a second.\n\n475\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.170\nI just have to open up the studio\ncuz I don't have it set up.\n\n476\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.428\nAnd I don't have a shortcut for\nit sitting right out here, so\n\n477\n00:23:33.428 --> 00:23:34.768\nI'm just gonna go right over here.\n\n478\n00:23:34.768 --> 00:23:38.371\nI'm just gonna right click on that,\nwe're gonna run that as administrator,\n\n479\n00:23:38.371 --> 00:23:40.680\njust bring that up,\nSQL 12 Management Studio.\n\n480\n00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.880\n&gt;&gt; So ultimately, our data warehouse\nis just another database, and\n\n481\n00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.870\nyou can manage it just like\nyou would any other database.\n\n482\n00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.817\n&gt;&gt; Well, absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; But would you say you'd probably want\n\n483\n00:23:50.817 --> 00:23:54.577\nto use the system center and\ngo there for that, or\n\n484\n00:23:54.577 --> 00:23:59.096\nIs there benefits to doing one or\nthe other, should I say.\n\n485\n00:23:59.096 --> 00:24:02.819\n&gt;&gt; Well, so for the data warehouse\ndatabase we don't have an option to manage\n\n486\n00:24:02.819 --> 00:24:07.093\nit directly from SCOM, so that actually is\ngonna have to be managed either from here.\n\n487\n00:24:07.093 --> 00:24:07.605\n&gt;&gt; From there.\n\n488\n00:24:07.605 --> 00:24:08.265\n&gt;&gt; From there, correct.\n\n489\n00:24:08.265 --> 00:24:10.395\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In and I've got it up, we'll go back.\n\n490\n00:24:10.395 --> 00:24:12.195\nWe'll kind of zoom in so\nyou can see it in just a second.\n\n491\n00:24:12.195 --> 00:24:16.055\nBut from within SQL studio, and, or\nusing this other tool I was talking about,\n\n492\n00:24:16.055 --> 00:24:17.265\nthis command line tool.\n\n493\n00:24:17.265 --> 00:24:20.535\nSo we could use the DW data RP.exe tool\n\n494\n00:24:20.535 --> 00:24:22.860\nto do what I'm about to\nshow you in SQL studio.\n\n495\n00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.280\nOr we could do it in the SQL Studio GUI\nenvironment if we choose to.\n\n496\n00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:31.600\nBut there is no way to do this inside\nof SCOM directly from the console for\n\n497\n00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.890\nthe data warehouse database.\n\n498\n00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.270\n&gt;&gt; Just when I thought\nSystem Center did it all.\n\n499\n00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:39.346\n&gt;&gt; It does almost everything but we do\ndifferentiate between the ops data base,\n\n500\n00:24:39.346 --> 00:24:42.745\nwhich is directly editable,\nmanageable, and configurable.\n\n501\n00:24:42.745 --> 00:24:46.629\nAs we saw from within the console,\nat least for the data retention portion,\n\n502\n00:24:46.629 --> 00:24:49.190\nthe policies specific to that,\nthe numbers.\n\n503\n00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.778\nWe could do that from here as well if we\nwanted to, but it's a little involved.\n\n504\n00:24:51.778 --> 00:24:54.589\nYou're probably not gonna wanna go\nin here and start poking around,\n\n505\n00:24:54.589 --> 00:24:57.520\ntrying to edit these settings,\nunless you absolutely have to.\n\n506\n00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.510\nBut what we can do is the following,\n\n507\n00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:04.160\ncome in here, we can go in, right click on\nthe ops manager, data warehouse database.\n\n508\n00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.590\nSo I've got that set up here.\n\n509\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.740\nJust gonna right-click.\n\n510\n00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.150\nAnd I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna run\na query, real quick, so just do new query.\n\n511\n00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.610\nSo give that just a second.\n\n512\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:12.968\nBrings up a little screen for us.\n\n513\n00:25:12.968 --> 00:25:16.370\nThen, we've gotta type this in,\nso let me just do a select here.\n\n514\n00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.888\nGroom stored procedure name.\n\n515\n00:25:19.888 --> 00:25:24.962\nGroom stored\n\n516\n00:25:24.962 --> 00:25:33.140\nprocedure name and then I'm gonna\nmake sure I spelled that correctly.\n\n517\n00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:38.040\nGroom stored procedure name, okay.\n\n518\n00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.480\nComma and then what do we got?\n\n519\n00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.607\nWe got max data, age, days.\n\n520\n00:25:42.607 --> 00:25:52.179\nMaxData, MaxData,\n\n521\n00:25:52.179 --> 00:25:53.514\nMaxDataAgeDays.\n\n522\n00:25:53.514 --> 00:25:59.021\nOkay, and then, what else do we got?\n\n523\n00:25:59.021 --> 00:26:01.303\nFromo, not comma rather, from.\n\n524\n00:26:01.303 --> 00:26:06.980\nWe got from and except that's\nfron not from, from there we go.\n\n525\n00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.271\nFrom and we're doing that from\nstandard data set aggregation.\n\n526\n00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:15.968\nOkay, so from standard,\n\n527\n00:26:15.968 --> 00:26:24.087\nstandard.dataset, standard.dataset.\n\n528\n00:26:24.087 --> 00:26:27.430\nstandard.datasetaggregation.\n\n529\n00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:30.960\n&gt;&gt; I know when they bunch all\nthose words together like that-\n\n530\n00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.290\n&gt;&gt; Two Gs, I always leave out the extra G\n\n531\n00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.010\nin aggregation.\n\n532\n00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.510\nOne second.\n\n533\n00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.500\nAggregation right.\n\n534\n00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.539\nSo if we were to run this query.\n\n535\n00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:45.340\nRight, what we would then get back is, we\nwould get the results showing all the data\n\n536\n00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:49.450\nsets including whatever the current\nretention period should be for\n\n537\n00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.410\nthe data warehouse database, right?\n\n538\n00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.040\nSo let's just see if that's gonna work.\n\n539\n00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.300\nAssuming I spelled everything correctly\nof course, cuz you know you never know.\n\n540\n00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.990\nAll right, so lets just go in there,\nlet's execute that sure enough, boom.\n\n541\n00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.533\nData, high five.\n&gt;&gt; Even though we're\n\n542\n00:27:03.533 --> 00:27:04.818\nnot showing it that was just.\n\n543\n00:27:04.818 --> 00:27:05.351\n&gt;&gt; Boom.\n\n544\n00:27:05.351 --> 00:27:05.909\n&gt;&gt; Awesome right there.\n\n545\n00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:06.709\n&gt;&gt; There it is, right here.\n\n546\n00:27:06.709 --> 00:27:07.323\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n547\n00:27:07.323 --> 00:27:07.877\nAwesome.\n\n548\n00:27:07.877 --> 00:27:09.846\n&gt;&gt; Boom.\n&gt;&gt; Because I could not see half of what\n\n549\n00:27:09.846 --> 00:27:10.512\nI'm sending.\n\n550\n00:27:10.512 --> 00:27:13.740\n[LAUGH] You don't see the screen\nwhen you guys are watching it.\n\n551\n00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.010\nBut I don't know if you saw it.\n\n552\n00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.390\nThe screen is like flickering,\nso it gets dark and light.\n\n553\n00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:19.250\nSo it's just the whole virtual machine and\n\n554\n00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:21.330\nvirtual machine in boot\ncamp thing we're doing.\n\n555\n00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:25.730\nBut so I'm typing and like half way\nthrough it goes like 50% darker,\n\n556\n00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:26.790\nit's like shades of gray.\n\n557\n00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:27.810\n&gt;&gt; Well, you nailed it there.\n\n558\n00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.690\n&gt;&gt; I cannot see half of\nwhat I'm typing usually.\n\n559\n00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.260\nAll right anyway, so\nyou're gonna type this in.\n\n560\n00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.720\nWhat this is gonna give us back, you can\nsee it on the table right below there.\n\n561\n00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.190\nWe're gonna get all of the max age or\nmax data age settings.\n\n562\n00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.910\nIn other words these\nare essentially the retention,\n\n563\n00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:46.910\ncurrent retention periods in the data\nwarehouse that we then will now have\n\n564\n00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.545\nthe ability in theory If we choose to\nto go in and we can actually modify.\n\n565\n00:27:51.545 --> 00:27:54.255\nSo we'd have to go and do a little\ntinkering under the hood here to be able\n\n566\n00:27:54.255 --> 00:27:57.575\nto get in and actually play around\nin here so that we can go in and\n\n567\n00:27:57.575 --> 00:27:59.385\nconfigure the data retention period.\n\n568\n00:27:59.385 --> 00:28:00.265\nSo we have that now.\n\n569\n00:28:00.265 --> 00:28:04.492\nSo now we've got this, what we then would\nhave to do is go into the tables and\n\n570\n00:28:04.492 --> 00:28:07.182\nwe'd have to start finding the appropriate\ntable to start messing around,\n\n571\n00:28:07.182 --> 00:28:09.672\nbecause we're not editing here.\n\n572\n00:28:09.672 --> 00:28:11.792\nAll we're doing is seeing\nthe output of the query so\n\n573\n00:28:11.792 --> 00:28:13.612\nthat way we know what they are.\n\n574\n00:28:13.612 --> 00:28:18.142\nNow what we have to do is actually\ngo in and step to, if you will.\n\n575\n00:28:18.142 --> 00:28:19.780\nSo we're gonna go in.\n\n576\n00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.430\nWe're gonna go and expand tables.\n\n577\n00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.330\nAnd by the way, the query I just typed\nin is in the show notes for you.\n\n578\n00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.800\nWe have a nice little breakdown,\nstep by step, of every step I'm doing,\n\n579\n00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.990\nkinda showing you what to do,\nwhere to go, how to do it.\n\n580\n00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.590\nSo, rest assured, no problem.\n\n581\n00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.690\nYou'll actually be able to\ndo this if you want to,\n\n582\n00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.160\ncuz I reproduced all the steps for you.\n\n583\n00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.130\nSo, don't worry about squinting into the\nscreen trying to capture that query, or\n\n584\n00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.410\nscribbling it down.\n\n585\n00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:41.820\nIt's clearly in the show notes for you.\n\n586\n00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.110\nYou should have no trouble\nfiguring it out at all.\n\n587\n00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.260\nSo, we're gonna into Tables here.\n\n588\n00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.590\nSo, let's just open up Tables.\n\n589\n00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.450\nWe got all sorts of tables\nsitting under here.\n\n590\n00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.790\nWhat we're gonna do is look for\nthe DBO dataset table.\n\n591\n00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.946\nSo, it's alphabetical and we're gonna have\nto scroll down just a little bit here.\n\n592\n00:28:54.946 --> 00:28:59.870\nThere's DBO,\nthere's DBO data set right there.\n\n593\n00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:03.260\nSo we're gonna find our\nDBO data set table, okay?\n\n594\n00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.650\nWe gotta open the table up.\n\n595\n00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:13.570\nAnd when we take a look at the table\nwe have to be able to find\n\n596\n00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:21.370\nthe GUID for the table,\nthe unique identifier, in other words.\n\n597\n00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:22.440\nSo we're gonna go in.\n\n598\n00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.980\nWe're gonna take a look and\nlet me see here.\n\n599\n00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.150\nWe're gonna go, what are we looking for?\n\n600\n00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.490\nWe need our GUID.\n\n601\n00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:34.075\nThat will be our, nope, that's not there.\n\n602\n00:29:34.075 --> 00:29:36.484\nWhere is our GUID?\n\n603\n00:29:36.484 --> 00:29:38.015\nThat's our name.\n\n604\n00:29:38.015 --> 00:29:41.860\nAll right, so I think we're actually gonna\nbe able to show you how to do this now.\n\n605\n00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.120\nI remember where it is, my fault totally.\n\n606\n00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.090\nLet's take a look at what we're gonna\ndo to get this the right way and\n\n607\n00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.200\nhave it setup and working for you.\n\n608\n00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.240\nSo we have our DBO.dataset table open.\n\n609\n00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.730\nWhat we're gonna do is just right click.\n\n610\n00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.020\nI'm gonna do this for you in a second.\n\n611\n00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:53.860\nWe're gonna right-click.\n\n612\n00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.640\nLet me actually just\nclose the columns out.\n\n613\n00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.840\nWe're gonna right-click,\njust pull up here.\n\n614\n00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.360\nJust do our top 1,000 rows,\nit doesn't really matter,\n\n615\n00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.970\ncuz we're not gonna have\nthat many in there.\n\n616\n00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.410\nBut we're just gonna go in,\ngrab our data set ID from there,\n\n617\n00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.820\nyou'll probably see it right\nhere on the left-hand side.\n\n618\n00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.360\nOur data set ID GUID,\nlet's expand that out.\n\n619\n00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.700\nYou can kind of see that just\nat the edge there right there.\n\n620\n00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.630\nAnd then what we need to do\nis we need to note the GUID\n\n621\n00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.720\nof whatever item it is that\nwe're gonna wanna modify.\n\n622\n00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.500\nSo this is where it gets\na little interesting, right.\n\n623\n00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.552\nThis is why I was saying\nthat going in here and\n\n624\n00:30:22.552 --> 00:30:25.393\ntrying to figure out how to do\nit may be a little complicated.\n\n625\n00:30:25.393 --> 00:30:29.511\nBecause now you gotta start figuring\nout which management pack idea,\n\n626\n00:30:29.511 --> 00:30:33.836\nrather which GUID ID rather for the\ndataset is gonna link to which object so\n\n627\n00:30:33.836 --> 00:30:36.375\nthat we know how to\nactually match them up.\n\n628\n00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:39.828\nAnd we've got, as you can see here,\nsix different items, right?\n\n629\n00:30:39.828 --> 00:30:43.250\nWe've got, whoops,\nsorry I didn't mean to click there.\n\n630\n00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:44.449\nWe've got a bunch of different items here.\n\n631\n00:30:44.449 --> 00:30:48.721\nWe'd have to choose which ever one it is\nlet's just say randomly it's the third\n\n632\n00:30:48.721 --> 00:30:49.600\none down.\n\n633\n00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.430\nData management pack version,\nrow ID, ect, ect, ect.\n\n634\n00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.760\nSo we'll take our GUID or\nour ID and just copy that so\n\n635\n00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.750\nwe can have that and\nlet's just go and do the following.\n\n636\n00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:05.160\nJust throw that down here in the bottom,\njust in notepad.\n\n637\n00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.840\nThat way we just have a reference to it.\n\n638\n00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.140\nWe know where it is.\n\n639\n00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.010\nAnd then when we need it we can\nactually pull it up and refer to it.\n\n640\n00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.370\nSo that way we're not\ntrying to remember that.\n\n641\n00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.410\nSo we'll just keep that there as just\na referenceable item there for a second.\n\n642\n00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.040\nNow what we're gonna do is go down,\nwe'll leave that table open.\n\n643\n00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.860\nLet's just scroll down here,\nget to our standard aggregation table.\n\n644\n00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.830\nSo give me just a second to\nscroll down and find that.\n\n645\n00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.520\nGot that one open right here.\n\n646\n00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.160\nSo our standard data set aggregation\ntable, a little bit further down.\n\n647\n00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.340\nGonna highlight that.\n\n648\n00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.690\nGet that opened up, as well.\n\n649\n00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.170\nAnd then, we've got more items here.\n\n650\n00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:41.240\nWe're gonna have to go in and find\nwhatever it is that we wanna modify, so\n\n651\n00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.778\nwe would take that particular\ndata set ID column that we found,\n\n652\n00:31:44.778 --> 00:31:47.012\nlocate the grid that we're gonna use.\n\n653\n00:31:47.012 --> 00:31:51.120\nSo we'd have to go in here, take a look at\nthis one, I'm thinking it was this one,\n\n654\n00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.538\nI don't remember though,\nlet's take a look, it may or may not be.\n\n655\n00:31:54.538 --> 00:31:59.244\nIt is gonna be 9536D, I should have\nput this in a place where we can\n\n656\n00:31:59.244 --> 00:32:02.671\nKinda do it side by side,\nlet's see if we do that.\n\n657\n00:32:02.671 --> 00:32:06.948\n9-5-3-6-D what's that end on, F-B-9.\n\n658\n00:32:06.948 --> 00:32:09.961\nThat one right there, so\nI did get it right after all, so\n\n659\n00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:12.604\nthat one right there is\nthe one we want to modify.\n\n660\n00:32:12.604 --> 00:32:17.567\nWhat we're then gonna do is move over to\nthe aggregation type I-D column right\n\n661\n00:32:17.567 --> 00:32:22.990\nhere, and we're gonna modify this\nvalue and we're gonna move over.\n\n662\n00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:26.150\nWe're gonna find the max data,\nage days column.\n\n663\n00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.659\nSo we're gonna modify this.\n\n664\n00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:31.371\nLet's just scroll down here so we can\nsee this, just kinda highlight that so\n\n665\n00:32:31.371 --> 00:32:33.440\nwe know which one we're working on.\n\n666\n00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.280\nWe're doing number five, we can actually\njust do that all the way across just\n\n667\n00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.085\nto show you so\nyou know which one we're gonna do.\n\n668\n00:32:38.085 --> 00:32:41.570\nBut we're gonna go find\nthe max data age days column.\n\n669\n00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.607\nSo let's look up here,\nI'm just gonna scroll over.\n\n670\n00:32:46.994 --> 00:32:47.560\nWait for it.\n\n671\n00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.370\nWait for it.\nWait for it.\n\n672\n00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:48.880\nWait for it.\n\n673\n00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.430\nAlphabetical, so\nwe got to keep waiting for it.\n\n674\n00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.160\nWe're getting closer.\n\n675\n00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:51.870\n&gt;&gt; It will happen.\n\n676\n00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.487\n&gt;&gt; It will happen eventually, because\nwe're gonna run out of letters in the.\n\n677\n00:32:54.487 --> 00:32:55.857\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So eventually it will show up.\n\n678\n00:32:55.857 --> 00:32:56.768\nThere it is right there.\n\n679\n00:32:56.768 --> 00:32:58.141\nMax data age.\n\n680\n00:32:58.141 --> 00:33:02.450\nSo we just got to scroll over so we can\nkinda get that squared off right here.\n\n681\n00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:08.013\nAnd we can see that that value for\nline item 5 is 400.\n\n682\n00:33:08.013 --> 00:33:12.697\nAnd we're gonna modify that because that's\nthe value that we actually wanna change in\n\n683\n00:33:12.697 --> 00:33:13.475\nour example.\n\n684\n00:33:13.475 --> 00:33:15.210\nThat's value we wanna change.\n\n685\n00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.520\nSo if it's set to 400 and\nI wanna modify it, I can change it here.\n\n686\n00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.860\nChange it to 90 or something like that.\n\n687\n00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.000\nOr whatever the case may be.\n\n688\n00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.370\nDon't try to modify it by the way,\nthe whole row highlighted,\n\n689\n00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.490\nthat would be a bad thing.\n\n690\n00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:31.780\nThat would not end well, but if you\nwanna modify it here, we can go in and\n\n691\n00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:37.420\nwe can make it change, we could just\ngo in and modify that if we want to.\n\n692\n00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.850\nSo we will go and\nmake a change there if you choose to.\n\n693\n00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:40.630\nUp to you.\n\n694\n00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:42.510\nAnd then, we can go in and\n\n695\n00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:47.440\nwe actually can modify the value that way,\nsave it off, and we're done.\n\n696\n00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.870\nOr what we can do, cuz this may be a\nlittle involved and a little complicated.\n\n697\n00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:56.330\nInstead, what we might wanna do to put a\nnew grooming value in is, and I showed you\n\n698\n00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:00.450\nthis already, we can go and we can run\nthis query that we talked about earlier.\n\n699\n00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:01.980\nSee what all the grooming values are.\n\n700\n00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.160\nI think I got rid of the, it left.\n\n701\n00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.834\nI did not leave that one open.\n\n702\n00:34:05.834 --> 00:34:07.610\nSo we have the query output there.\n\n703\n00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.720\nYou remember we saw what that was.\n\n704\n00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.420\nWe could go in and\n\n705\n00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.390\nrun another query against the table\nto update it if we chose to.\n\n706\n00:34:14.390 --> 00:34:17.085\nSo if we wanna do that,\nwe can do the following.\n\n707\n00:34:17.085 --> 00:34:21.055\nLet's just create a new query so\nlets go in, lets create a brand new,\n\n708\n00:34:21.055 --> 00:34:22.983\noops lets just highlight there.\n\n709\n00:34:22.983 --> 00:34:24.316\nLet's create a brand new query.\n\n710\n00:34:26.013 --> 00:34:29.700\nSo let's go in and let's do the following.\n\n711\n00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:33.990\nJust do a new query right from here and\nwe can type the following or\n\n712\n00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:35.220\nwe'll type in the following.\n\n713\n00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:39.210\nLet me just type in the query for\nyou real quick, use and\n\n714\n00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:43.590\nwe're gonna do operations and we're gonna\nchoose which database we wanna use.\n\n715\n00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.600\nWe're gonna use the data\nwarehouse database.\n\n716\n00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.370\nSo I'll highlight that, so\nit's gonna auto-fill for us.\n\n717\n00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:54.620\nGo down to our next line, we're gonna\ndo update, let me just put caps\n\n718\n00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.460\nlock on there, what are we gonna update,\nwe're gonna update standard data set\n\n719\n00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:04.380\naggregation, so let me take off\nthe caps lock and do standard.\n\n720\n00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.550\nData set aggregation.\n\n721\n00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.830\nRight there,\nwe're gonna use our auto-complete, so\n\n722\n00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:10.720\nwe're not worried about typing correctly.\n\n723\n00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.861\nWe're gonna do a set max age.\n\n724\n00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:13.920\nSo we're gonna do set.\n\n725\n00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.640\nAnd we're gonna do, what are we doing.\n\n726\n00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.330\nMax data age, days.\n\n727\n00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:21.711\nMax data age days right there.\n\n728\n00:35:21.711 --> 00:35:23.241\nI'm gonna set that,\n\n729\n00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:27.960\nnow we'll set that equal to 85 or\nwhatever we wanna set it to.\n\n730\n00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.960\nJust another way to modify the same thing.\n\n731\n00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.910\nAnd we're gonna do a WHERE,\nwe'll do a WHERE and\n\n732\n00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:42.060\nwe'll do groom stored procedure name, so\ndo Groomstored procedure name right there.\n\n733\n00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:46.280\nAnd Groomstored procedure name is equal\nto, we have to specify the value.\n\n734\n00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.740\nThat'll be alert groom, so\nlet's just specify that.\n\n735\n00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:56.464\nWhoops, not AK but alert, so alert groom.\n\n736\n00:35:56.464 --> 00:36:00.198\nSo we have that so if we ran this,\nthis would then go ahead and\n\n737\n00:36:00.198 --> 00:36:05.475\nthis would allow us to change the settings\nfor the alert groom dataset from 400.\n\n738\n00:36:05.475 --> 00:36:09.455\nDays to 90, or in my case 85, or\nwhatever I want it to specify.\n\n739\n00:36:09.455 --> 00:36:13.035\nSo we could use a query to operate\nagainst the table and do it this way.\n\n740\n00:36:13.035 --> 00:36:14.705\nSo there's a few different\nways to get it to do this.\n\n741\n00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:17.155\nBut it's gonna get a little complicated\nif you gotta go in there and\n\n742\n00:36:17.155 --> 00:36:21.525\nstart messing around with tables,\nlookup, GLID IDs, and then scroll\n\n743\n00:36:21.525 --> 00:36:26.015\nover 24 columns in, figure out what you\nwanna modify, go in there and edit that.\n\n744\n00:36:26.015 --> 00:36:27.055\nThat can get a little tricky.\n\n745\n00:36:27.055 --> 00:36:30.140\nThat's why I was suggesting, you saw I had\na little problem with it I had to stop for\n\n746\n00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.930\na minute, kinda figure out where we were,\nfigure out what I was looking for,\n\n747\n00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:35.080\nmake sure I had the right table.\n\n748\n00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.010\nSo it's not the easiest\nthing in the world to do.\n\n749\n00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:42.300\nSo make sure that if you're gonna go in,\nand you're gonna operate on the database,\n\n750\n00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.050\nthat you do have a little\nunderstanding of what happens in here.\n\n751\n00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.510\nGet a DBA to help you,\nno problem with that,\n\n752\n00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:50.960\nno shame in asking somebody who does\nit all the time to help you out at all.\n\n753\n00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.270\nI would ask for\none if I had access to one just now,\n\n754\n00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:55.780\nbut I don't have a DBA around the studio.\n\n755\n00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.850\nDaniel is sitting next to me but\nhe's looking at me like, don't look at me.\n\n756\n00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.380\n&gt;&gt; I feel like SQL tries\nto hate me to death [LAUGH]\n\n757\n00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.800\n&gt;&gt; I'm just not the person that you wanna\n\n758\n00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.220\nhave poking around in there.\n\n759\n00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.135\nSo we could do something like that.\n\n760\n00:37:06.135 --> 00:37:08.921\nAnd obviously then if we went and\nexecuted this, right,\n\n761\n00:37:08.921 --> 00:37:12.400\nwe then would be able to do ahead,\nand you can see one row affected.\n\n762\n00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.750\nIt just makes the modification on\nthe alert groom, nothing else.\n\n763\n00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:19.940\nAnd now that value would be 85,\nwe go back and run our prior query,\n\n764\n00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.640\nwe actually would see that.\n\n765\n00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.520\nWe probably can go and\ndo that real quick, give me a second.\n\n766\n00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.464\nSo we gotta go back and\nget the query information, and\n\n767\n00:37:27.464 --> 00:37:29.827\nI'll type the backend for you real quick.\n\n768\n00:37:29.827 --> 00:37:33.929\nAnd we actually can just see that it\ndid modify, so let me just go ahead and\n\n769\n00:37:33.929 --> 00:37:35.083\ndo a new query here.\n\n770\n00:37:35.083 --> 00:37:41.720\nAnd we'll do our select statement\nagain And we'll do our select for\n\n771\n00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.012\ngroom store procedure name, so\nlet's do groom store procedure name.\n\n772\n00:37:51.132 --> 00:37:54.270\nGroom store procedure name,\nmake sure I spell that correctly.\n\n773\n00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.484\nGroom store procedure name,\ncomma, max data, aged days,\n\n774\n00:37:57.484 --> 00:38:01.087\nlet me just make sure that looks good,\ngroom store procedure name.\n\n775\n00:38:01.087 --> 00:38:01.870\nMax, whoops.\n\n776\n00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.862\nWe've got what, max data, age, days/s.\n\n777\n00:38:06.862 --> 00:38:10.063\nSo we got max data, age,\n\n778\n00:38:10.063 --> 00:38:14.760\ndays comma and what else do we got?\n\n779\n00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.930\nWe have [INAUDIBLE] did that last time,\ntoo.\n\n780\n00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:19.665\nWe need it from there, and\nwhere are we getting it from?\n\n781\n00:38:19.665 --> 00:38:23.838\nWe're getting it from standard\ndata set aggregation,\n\n782\n00:38:23.838 --> 00:38:27.755\nso from standard data set\naggregation right there.\n\n783\n00:38:27.755 --> 00:38:29.100\nSo when we do that.\n\n784\n00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:34.670\nAnd we'll do that, you'll see right down\nthere now a little groom is set to 85,\n\n785\n00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.910\nwhere it was 400 before.\n\n786\n00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.150\nAnd we could see the output\nof what we just did, and\n\n787\n00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.775\nyou can see it actually has modified.\n\n788\n00:38:40.775 --> 00:38:43.190\nSo there's a couple of different ways\nto go in and play around with this.\n\n789\n00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:46.930\nBut we do wanna make sure that as we're\nthinking about going in and modifying\n\n790\n00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:52.030\nthe data warehouse database as opposed to\nactually modifying the manager database\n\n791\n00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:56.180\nthat we're using the appropriate approach\nbecause either SQL Manager Studio or\n\n792\n00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.640\nthe other tool I wanted to mention\nreal quick and just show you.\n\n793\n00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.290\nWhich is the dwdatarp.exe tool,\ncan be used.\n\n794\n00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:06.030\nDwdatarp, a little bit easier than this.\n\n795\n00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:10.392\nBut still a little complex in the sense we\nstill have to understand information like\n\n796\n00:39:10.392 --> 00:39:11.273\nwhat database.\n\n797\n00:39:11.273 --> 00:39:13.420\nAnd specifically what tables, and\nwhere we're going, and what values.\n\n798\n00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.300\nSo we're not gonna get away from\nsome of that, it's just gonna\n\n799\n00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.370\nperhaps be a little bit easier for\nyou, depending on the thought process.\n\n800\n00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:21.460\nSo let's minimize this for a second.\n\n801\n00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.890\nNow, the data based tool here, let me just\nbring this up here so you could see it.\n\n802\n00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:30.090\nThe data warehouse,\ndata retention policy tool,\n\n803\n00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:33.350\nyou could be downloading it\nfrom a website right here.\n\n804\n00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:38.140\nI just went out and there is a, again,\nSystem Center Ops Manager Blog.\n\n805\n00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.010\nGotta love the fact team's\nblog about all sorts of stuff.\n\n806\n00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:41.760\nHelps us out.\n\n807\n00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.440\nThis one's a little bit old,\nthis one is from 2008.\n\n808\n00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.390\nThis tool's been out for some time now.\n\n809\n00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:49.380\nBut you could see it here, and you could\njust go out and search for the tool if you\n\n810\n00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:54.910\nsearch for dwatarp.exe tool, and\nyou'll find download tool kind of thing.\n\n811\n00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.400\nYou'll find this blog entry.\n\n812\n00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.253\nSo not a big deal to find by any means, at\nthe bottom, they have the little link for\n\n813\n00:40:00.253 --> 00:40:03.446\nyou to download it, when you do that,\nyou get the file right here.\n\n814\n00:40:03.446 --> 00:40:05.570\nI'm gonna just drag this out to the middle\nof the screen so you can see it.\n\n815\n00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.860\nWe get the zip file right there.\n\n816\n00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:08.810\nOpen it up.\n\n817\n00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:12.711\nWe have a version for AMD64, one for x86.\n\n818\n00:40:12.711 --> 00:40:13.311\nThe tool is there.\n\n819\n00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:15.040\nThere's really nothing\nto it other than that.\n\n820\n00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.170\nYou just gotta run the tool and\nthen you can read the help file.\n\n821\n00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:21.510\nSo just essentially run the tool /?.\n\n822\n00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.640\nGet the help file,\nread up on it a little bit.\n\n823\n00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:29.500\nBut we do put some information for you on\nhow to use the tool into the show notes.\n\n824\n00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.910\nThe commands are pretty straightforward,\nyou'll execute the tool with an S switch.\n\n825\n00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.110\nWhich is the server name so\nyou'll specify the name of the server.\n\n826\n00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:41.370\nD for database name, DS for\ndata set name, A for\n\n827\n00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.360\naggregation name, M for number of days.\n\n828\n00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.210\nSo you'll just go through those switches.\n\n829\n00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.400\nWe note them in the show notes for you,\nwhich is pretty straightforward to use.\n\n830\n00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.060\nAnd then, you're able to connect to\nthe system assuming of course you have\n\n831\n00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.850\nconnectivity you're able to get to it.\n\n832\n00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.450\nAnd assuming you put everything in\ncorrectly you'll be able to do the same\n\n833\n00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:59.320\nthing I just showed you in\nthe SQL Studio using that tool.\n\n834\n00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.480\nAnd you won't have an problems with it,\nit's actually fairly straightforward\n\n835\n00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.780\nto use, and actually pretty easy,\nonce you get the tool downloaded.\n\n836\n00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.971\nHardest part actually is finding the tool,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n837\n00:41:07.971 --> 00:41:09.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Once you get the tool the rest is\n\n838\n00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.230\nactually very straightforward.\n\n839\n00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:11.920\n&gt;&gt; They're hiding it very well from us.\n\n840\n00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.570\nYou gotta be on the lookout for that.\n\n841\n00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:16.865\nAll right Adam, I know we've got actually\na little bit more to go through but\n\n842\n00:41:16.865 --> 00:41:17.935\nour time is.\n\n843\n00:41:17.935 --> 00:41:19.315\nWe blew our time long ago.\n\n844\n00:41:19.315 --> 00:41:19.885\nBut that's cool.\n\n845\n00:41:19.885 --> 00:41:23.325\nWe have some stuff we wanted to get to\nyou guys so that you could look at.\n\n846\n00:41:23.325 --> 00:41:26.215\nWorking with these databases,\nobviously, jumping into SQL.\n\n847\n00:41:26.215 --> 00:41:27.895\nNot the easiest thing in\nthe world unless you're a DBA,\n\n848\n00:41:27.895 --> 00:41:30.045\nthen that's just something\nthat you do on a daily basis.\n\n849\n00:41:30.045 --> 00:41:31.905\nMaybe that will be your favorite path.\n\n850\n00:41:31.905 --> 00:41:36.465\nAnd then, of course, we have\nthe WD Data RP tool for the rest of us.\n\n851\n00:41:36.465 --> 00:41:37.798\nThat's, I'm right here.\n\n852\n00:41:37.798 --> 00:41:38.305\nRight here.\n\n853\n00:41:38.305 --> 00:41:39.330\nThat's what I'm gonna use.\n\n854\n00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.473\nSo that being said, we thank you Adam for\ngetting us this far,\n\n855\n00:41:42.473 --> 00:41:46.530\nlooking forward to seeing everybody here\nin a part two where I expect to see you.\n\n856\n00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:48.496\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV,\n\n857\n00:41:48.496 --> 00:41:50.490\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n858\n00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:51.170\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n859\n00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.610\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n860\n00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:59.867\n[MUSIC]\n\n861\n00:41:59.867 --> 00:42:03.080\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.265\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:13.754\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:17.190\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.120\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.790\nwe're back with more of our Datacenter\nMonitoring with Microsoft SCOM series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.870\nAnd joining me back in the studio again,\nis our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.350\nAdam, glad to have you again,\nhow is it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.210\n&gt;&gt; Cha Cha Cha.\n\n11\n00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.900\n&gt;&gt; Cha Cha Cha.\n\n12\n00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.560\n&gt;&gt;

ITProTV.\n\n15\n00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:42.195\nSo we are gonna continue our conversation.\n\n16\n00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:47.065\nPart Two of tuning, optimizing,\nand of course, of BCDR.\n\n17\n00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:51.365\nWe're gonna actually focus a little bit\nmore on the BCDR piece in this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:53.835\nWe're gonna pick up on some of\nthe threads we had from the last episode.\n\n19\n00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:58.560\nIf you haven't seen that, we went through,\ntalked about how to tune and\n\n20\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.960\noptimize a little bit.\n\n21\n00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.170\nHow to do some stuff with going in and\ndealing with, just setting up and\n\n22\n00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.300\nmaking SCOM run, and figuring all\nthe details we need, database grooming.\n\n23\n00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.440\nThings of that nature, that we've gone\nover in, probably, prior episodes.\n\n24\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.240\nMaybe even done a demo or two on.\n\n25\n00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.730\nWe brought them back and circled around to\nmake sure you were comfortable with them,\n\n26\n00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.350\nput them all in one place for you.\n\n27\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.880\nWe're gonna go in and we're gonna\ntake a look at how to deal with,\n\n28\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.350\nwhat happens if a management server fails?\n\n29\n00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.910\nWhat do we do?\n\n30\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.060\nThere are some detailed\nsteps you've gotta follow.\n\n31\n00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.860\nIt's not overly complex, but\nit is a methodical, step by step process.\n\n32\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.300\nWe've gotta make sure we\ndo it in the right order.\n\n33\n00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.240\nSo we're gonna take a look at that,\nsee what's going on.\n\n34\n00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.740\nGot some demo areas set up for you.\n\n35\n00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.830\nWe'll take a look at the registry\neditor in a little bit.\n\n36\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.290\nWe'll take a look at\nSQL Studio a little bit.\n\n37\n00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.190\nWe'll go in and talk about what happens,\n\n38\n00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.430\nwhen you try to do\na restore using the media.\n\n39\n00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.730\nIf you don't set it up the right way,\nthen you get an error.\n\n40\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.795\nI'm gonna show you what that error looks\nlike, show you how to deal with it.\n\n41\n00:01:55.795 --> 00:01:58.745\nBecause it's not as straightforward\nas we make it sound.\n\n42\n00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:03.515\nIt is, actually but you just gotta\nknow the secret which is, shh, silent.\n\n43\n00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.365\nWe'll talk about what\nthat means in a moment.\n\n44\n00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:08.532\nBecause if you don't do the restore\nthe right way, with the right switch,\n\n45\n00:02:08.532 --> 00:02:12.182\nyou get a nasty big old, hey, we can't\ndo this, cuz we don't support it screen.\n\n46\n00:02:12.182 --> 00:02:13.822\nSo we're gonna talk about that and\nshow you what to do,\n\n47\n00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:15.952\nmake sure you know how\nto do it the right way.\n\n48\n00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:19.792\nShow you the script involved with\nmaking sure you actually can run\n\n49\n00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:21.642\nthe restore using media,\nthe restore and the silent switch.\n\n50\n00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:24.840\nWe'll take a look at all that.\n\n51\n00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.540\nAnd we'll also go in and we'll talk\nabout editing of some config files.\n\n52\n00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.820\nMaking some changes to make sure\nthat restore works the right way.\n\n53\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.190\nSo, let's go in.\n\n54\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.500\nLet's start by talking about what happens,\n\n55\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.465\nhigh level steps when a management server\nfails, what do we do to restore it?\n\n56\n00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:42.320\nAnd we're gonna go there.\n\n57\n00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.650\nGetting better at that, right?\n\n58\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.420\n&gt;&gt; You are getting better.\n\n59\n00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.100\n&gt;&gt; It's like putting left and right on\nyour shoes to get them on the right feet.\n\n60\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.630\nIt's a small victory, but\nit's really important.\n\n61\n00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.580\nOtherwise, it sucks walking around\nall day, cuz your feet hurt.\n\n62\n00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.780\nAll right, so, what we're gonna\ndo is take a look at this.\n\n63\n00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.710\nNow, I've gone ahead, and\nwe're on the OpsManager server.\n\n64\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.190\nAnd I have, and\nI'm not gonna bring it up right now,\n\n65\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.250\nbecause you can just see it here.\n\n66\n00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.980\nThis is for Part Two of the demo here,\nin just a moment.\n\n67\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.820\nBut I have this SCOM, you can kind of see,\njust hovering over the DVD.\n\n68\n00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.250\nI've got the SCOM install\nmedia installed here.\n\n69\n00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.110\nSo we're gonna go into the D:/ drive.\n\n70\n00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:17.490\nAnd on the D:/ drive, and\n\n71\n00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.890\nI didn't bother to make the command line\nall white and full, and big and blue.\n\n72\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.360\nYou don't really need to\nsee anything in here.\n\n73\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.940\nIt's just one quick thing.\n\n74\n00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.470\nBut when we run setup.exe,\n\n75\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.530\nwhich is sitting right here, I will just\nhighlight that part so you can see it.\n\n76\n00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.460\nWhen we run setup.exe/recover,\n\n77\n00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.260\nwhich you would think logically,\nwould be what we do to start recovering,\n\n78\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.910\nand you would be partially right,\nas I was suggesting to you, we get this.\n\n79\n00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.400\nAnd this looks promising.\n\n80\n00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.840\nHey, I can-\n&gt;&gt; Something happened.\n\n81\n00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.240\n&gt;&gt; Theoretically,\nI'm off to the races here.\n\n82\n00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.550\nI'm looking good, right?\n\n83\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.140\nSo we can go ahead, we can click Install.\n\n84\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.269\nBut, this is the problem that\nyou're gonna find right here.\n\n85\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.050\nLooks like it's running, and then we get\nthe big, it would be great if they had\n\n86\n00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.672\nthe un-smiley face, and\nit came out and went wah, wah, wah,\n\n87\n00:04:05.672 --> 00:04:09.340\nandd it laughed at you and said-\n&gt;&gt; You remember Mr. Yuck, from the 80s?\n\n88\n00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like a sticker you put on detergents\n\n89\n00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.160\nand things so your kids wouldn't eat them?\n\n90\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's it for Mr. Yahtzee.\n\n91\n00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.830\n&gt;&gt; That are like Max Headroom.\n\n92\n00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.442\nCan you bring back Max Headroom?\n\n93\n00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:18.358\n&gt;&gt; Awesome [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Most,\n\n94\n00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.790\nmany of you may not have a point\nof reference to Max Headroom.\n\n95\n00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.990\nBut we gotta show Megan Max,\nthat will be fun.\n\n96\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.790\nCuz I don't know if she knows Max.\n\n97\n00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's so on, yeah.\n\n98\n00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.758\n&gt;&gt; That's like,\nyou thought Styx was cool, Megan?\n\n99\n00:04:28.758 --> 00:04:31.350\nThis is even cooler,\nwe got to show you that.\n\n100\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.110\nSo if we brought back Max Headroom,\nright, and\n\n101\n00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.830\nlike-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n102\n00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.790\n&gt;&gt; Put the Max Headroom face in there.\n\n103\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.210\nThat would just be awesome.\n\n104\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.790\n&gt;&gt; I think Microsoft's got the money\nto make that happen, yeah.\n\n105\n00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.440\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna bring that up\nin the next design meeting,\n\n106\n00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.230\nsee if we can make that happen, right.\n\n107\n00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.085\nThat'll be like SCOM 2017,\nthe Max Headroom edition, or something.\n\n108\n00:04:49.085 --> 00:04:53.095\nSo anyway, what happens here is you see,\nunable to proceed.\n\n109\n00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:54.295\nCan we go full screen for a second?\n\n110\n00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:56.915\nI want you to see this and\nreally understand what's happened.\n\n111\n00:04:56.915 --> 00:05:00.022\nIt says here, setup unable able to proceed\nwith install for the following reason.\n\n112\n00:05:00.022 --> 00:05:02.832\nNow they're good,\nthey actually do tell us exactly why.\n\n113\n00:05:02.832 --> 00:05:05.462\nNo cryptic error codes,\nno, hey, go look it up.\n\n114\n00:05:05.462 --> 00:05:08.062\nNo, yeah, we're just not interested\nin telling you what's wrong.\n\n115\n00:05:08.062 --> 00:05:09.082\nYou figure it out.\n\n116\n00:05:09.082 --> 00:05:12.162\nWe tell you exactly what the problem is,\nand I already told you what it is.\n\n117\n00:05:12.162 --> 00:05:13.992\nWe're not using the right set of switches.\n\n118\n00:05:13.992 --> 00:05:15.132\nWe're doing recover,\n\n119\n00:05:15.132 --> 00:05:18.900\nbut we got to do recover silent,\nand then we gotta script it.\n\n120\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.580\nThe only way we could do a recover, and\n\n121\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.710\nit tells you right here, disaster recovery\nswitch is passed, but not silent install.\n\n122\n00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.490\nDR is currently supported\nonly in silent mode.\n\n123\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.970\nSo we do support recovery,\nbut only in silent mode.\n\n124\n00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.600\nCan't do it, in other words,\nfrom the graphical interface.\n\n125\n00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.800\nSo we're gonna hit Cancel here,\nwe're gonna exit out of here knowing that.\n\n126\n00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.180\nNow instead,\nwhat we need to do is the following.\n\n127\n00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.790\nWe get to the right Notepad here.\n\n128\n00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.790\nWe need this.\n\n129\n00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.420\nYou could hopefully see\nthis on the screen.\n\n130\n00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.520\nThese are the high level steps,\nby the way.\n\n131\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.670\nThey're all in the show notes, including\nthe script that I have highlighted for\n\n132\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.120\nyou, as to what would need\nto happen to recover.\n\n133\n00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.520\nSo you'll see, build new server and\nensure computer name is the same, right,\n\n134\n00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.942\nas the failed server.\n\n135\n00:06:05.942 --> 00:06:10.790\nUse the recovery option with the silent\nswitches, you can see right here.\n\n136\n00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.321\nSetup.exe silent, accept ULA.\n\n137\n00:06:13.321 --> 00:06:16.840\nOne means yes, zero means no, recover.\n\n138\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.211\nAnd then the rest of it.\n\n139\n00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:21.490\nSo, enable error reporting,\nsend CIP, or CEIP.\n\n140\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.680\nUse Microsoft Update,\nwhat's our database name?\n\n141\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.970\nSQL Server instance, what's the instance?\n\n142\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.330\nData warehouse, database name, what's\nthe data warehouse SQL server instance?\n\n143\n00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.860\nWhat's our account name?\n\n144\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.860\nData reader account,\ndata reader password, data writer user,\n\n145\n00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.900\ndata writer password, action account user,\naction account password, right?\n\n146\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.990\nSo we gotta go through and do all of this,\nand run this exact command this way.\n\n147\n00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.610\nFilling in, obviously,\nthe variables associated, right,\n\n148\n00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.970\nwith what has to happen here\nto recreate this instance.\n\n149\n00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.820\nBut if you don't take the time to\nread through the documentation,\n\n150\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.030\nyou don't know this, you're off\nto what seems like a good start.\n\n151\n00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.360\nYou hit the brick wall,\nnot the end of the world.\n\n152\n00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.640\nIt's easy enough to fix, right?\n\n153\n00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.272\nIt's just the time delay, the aggravation,\n\n154\n00:07:05.272 --> 00:07:08.410\nyou know you're under\nthe gun to get this fixed.\n\n155\n00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.390\nThe business is down right now,\nin the sense that we're not monitoring.\n\n156\n00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.360\nPeople are uptight.\n\n157\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.910\nBut less delays, and\nthe more happiness, the better, right?\n\n158\n00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.350\n&gt;&gt; Dogs and cats are living together.\n\n159\n00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Insane.\n\n160\n00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.830\n&gt;&gt; Total chaos.\n\n161\n00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.125\n&gt;&gt; Things falling out of the sky.\n\n162\n00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:23.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is not a good time, right?\n\n163\n00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.140\nSo we wanna make it as easy as possible,\n\n164\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.390\nwanna make sure we kinda\nstreamline this process for you.\n\n165\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.360\nBecause honestly, as we're saying, this\nis a stressful time in the organization.\n\n166\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.750\nThe less that goes wrong, and\nthe more that goes right,\n\n167\n00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.710\nthe happier you're going to be,\nthat's just the reality.\n\n168\n00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.970\nUnlike a lot of other activities that\nwe engage in, the reality of this is,\n\n169\n00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.480\nyou probably don't do DR all that\noften on any of these products.\n\n170\n00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.688\nBecause hopefully,\nthings just work the right way, and\n\n171\n00:07:48.688 --> 00:07:49.886\nthey don't blow up too often.\n\n172\n00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:53.078\nAnd as a result, you may go through\na five-year maintenance in life\n\n173\n00:07:53.078 --> 00:07:55.379\ncycle on this product and\nnever have to recover.\n\n174\n00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:58.808\nOr you may have to recover,\nbut it may only happen once.\n\n175\n00:07:58.808 --> 00:08:02.210\nHopefully, you're in the former,\nyou don't have to recover at all.\n\n176\n00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.620\nIf you have to recover,\n\n177\n00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.650\nhopefully this will at least give you\na point of reference to start from.\n\n178\n00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.950\nBut unless you're doing this\neither as a consultant or\n\n179\n00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.580\nas a test bed environment\ngeneration kind of thing.\n\n180\n00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.940\nYou're probably not blowing things up and\nhaving to recover them all that often.\n\n181\n00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.290\nI talked to many, many customers, and we\ntalk about this concept, hey, let's plan\n\n182\n00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.500\nfor it, let's have a script set up, let's\njust put the generic script in place.\n\n183\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.110\nLet's make sure we keep\nthe variables listed, so,\n\n184\n00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.050\nif we have to deploy, we know what it is,\nyou're not scrambling to figure this out.\n\n185\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.830\nAnd they may go through\nan entire product lifecycle and\n\n186\n00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.220\nnever actually have to use it.\n\n187\n00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.450\nSo it's important just to be thinking,\nplanning for\n\n188\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.900\nsuccess as opposed to having\nto deal with it in the moment.\n\n189\n00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.410\nBecause then, it's scramble\njust to figure everything out.\n\n190\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.880\nSo, wanna make sure you see this,\n\n191\n00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.820\nyou have a sense of this, you understand\nthe issues associated with this.\n\n192\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.240\nSo, we've dealt with that piece, and I'm\njust gonna go ahead and tidy this up for\n\n193\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.360\njust one second.\n\n194\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.090\nLet's talk about the next piece, which is,\nwhat do we deal with or how do we deal\n\n195\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.470\nwith the process of recovering a failed\noperational, or data warehouse database?\n\n196\n00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.880\nWhat happens if the database itself fails?\n\n197\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.930\nServer's okay, but\ndatabase's on the backend are not working,\n\n198\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:09.960\nwhat are we gonna do?\n\n199\n00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.210\nWell if we have to go in and\nrecover a failed database\n\n200\n00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.950\nwe're gonna go into the SQL Server studio\nand we're gonna do some stuff in there.\n\n201\n00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.500\nSo let's go in, let's take a look.\n\n202\n00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.690\nGot that piece set up for you as well.\n\n203\n00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.250\nSo we'll bring up\nthe SQL Studio here real quick.\n\n204\n00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.930\nYou can see and I'm already down in\nthe tables cuz I'm gonna be doing\n\n205\n00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:31.030\na demo of part two here about how\nto edit out the named instance and\n\n206\n00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.660\nmake some changes when\nwe're doing recovery.\n\n207\n00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.900\nBut you can see hopefully,\nthat we are in the SQL Studio,\n\n208\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.018\nwe are in one of, I know it's kinda\nhard to see because it's up at the top.\n\n209\n00:09:40.018 --> 00:09:43.200\nLet me just bring this down, but\nwe're in one of the tables here for\n\n210\n00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.690\nthe system management group, so\nwe're actually in the middle of this.\n\n211\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:52.860\nBut what I've done is I've right-clicked\non the databases folder at the top\n\n212\n00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.940\nof the stack as we open the SQL Management\nStudio, and I've chosen restore.\n\n213\n00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.480\nThere's an option there\nto restore databases.\n\n214\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.730\nYou'll be able to go in,\nright-click on that once we connect to\n\n215\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.225\nthe database engine, use the proper\ncredentials in the object explorer.\n\n216\n00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:11.870\nRight-click on the database folder\ninstance, choose restore database,\n\n217\n00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:12.540\ngeneric, right?\n\n218\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.970\nOr restore any kind of database,\ndoesn't matter what it is.\n\n219\n00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.910\nAnd then here, it's very simple,\nyou'll see under source database, and\n\n220\n00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.980\nthen device and then database,\nand then destination.\n\n221\n00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.410\nWe got to fill in\nthe appropriate information.\n\n222\n00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.090\nYou could see what we're connected\nto down here on the left.\n\n223\n00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.230\nIt's the plaid, SYS01 instance.\n\n224\n00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.870\nAnd once we do that,\n\n225\n00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.480\nwe're then gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nbe able to click Device, in this case.\n\n226\n00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.740\nAnd we're gonna go in here\ninstead of database and\n\n227\n00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.100\nwe're gonna provide the path for\nthe backup.\n\n228\n00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.040\nNow, this makes a big assumption and\nhopefully I'm assuming correctly.\n\n229\n00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.540\nAnd if I'm not, you need to fix\nthis before we go any further,\n\n230\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.640\nmeaning before you keep operating\nin the real world and have\n\n231\n00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.010\nan issue that requires you to restore, you\ngotta go make a backup of those databases.\n\n232\n00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.750\nLike right now,\nyou should stop what we're doing.\n\n233\n00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.530\nI'm happy to hang out and\npause here for a couple of minutes.\n\n234\n00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.140\nI will go grab a cup of coffee.\n\n235\n00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.330\nYou need to go make an operational and\ndata warehouse data backup,\n\n236\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.930\nand I'm sure you probably\nalready have one.\n\n237\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.970\nBut if you don't have one, it's not up\nto date, if there's any issues with it,\n\n238\n00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.710\nyou should be backing this stuff up daily,\nby the way.\n\n239\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.130\nBut if you're not this will be\na great time to go fix that problem\n\n240\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.800\nbefore it becomes what we call an RGE.\n\n241\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.620\nYou know what a RGE is?\n\n242\n00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.285\n&gt;&gt; A resume generating event.\n\n243\n00:11:28.285 --> 00:11:29.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A resume generating event,\n\n244\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.690\nabsolutely, because we often say if you\ndon't back up you will be packing up.\n\n245\n00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.080\nSo make sure that you have that back up,\nthose backups,\n\n246\n00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.270\nI should say, gotta have two.\n\n247\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.311\nAnd actually if we have the ACS database,\nyou're gonna wanna have three.\n\n248\n00:11:42.311 --> 00:11:45.070\nCuz we've gotta have a backup of\nall the operational databases.\n\n249\n00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.450\nBut we gotta have that.\n\n250\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.050\nWe'll then go ahead, we'll add\nthe database backup file, wherever it is.\n\n251\n00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:54.730\nYou can see Add here, we'll just go in and\nwe'll provide whatever the location is for\n\n252\n00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.400\nthe backup and then we'll go ahead and\n\n253\n00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.580\nwe'll add it in and\nwe'll be able to mount it.\n\n254\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.940\nSo we're gonna be able\nto do that piece and\n\n255\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.968\ndo the backup here,\npretty straightforward.\n\n256\n00:12:02.968 --> 00:12:07.260\nWe click OK at that point and get a\nprompt, restore operation goes forward and\n\n257\n00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.970\nthen, we're then able to\nremount the database.\n\n258\n00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.700\nThat's not too difficult and that's really\nnot gonna be hopefully be too disruptive.\n\n259\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.920\nAgain, pretty straightforward,\npretty simple.\n\n260\n00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.630\nSounds scary but really not very scary,\nprovided we have planned to be successful,\n\n261\n00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.290\nthis is the key,\nthis is what we keep talking about.\n\n262\n00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:28.905\nUnderstand your environment,\nknow what the steps are ahead of time.\n\n263\n00:12:28.905 --> 00:12:31.671\nI'm not suggesting that if you\ngotta go and figure it out,\n\n264\n00:12:31.671 --> 00:12:33.760\nspur of the moment that you're gonna fail,\n\n265\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.267\nI'm just suggesting it's gonna be\na lot tougher on you to be successful.\n\n266\n00:12:37.267 --> 00:12:40.453\nIf you dry ran this thought\nprocess in your mind a few times,\n\n267\n00:12:40.453 --> 00:12:44.534\nif you've got the script already set up,\nyou've got the variables there,\n\n268\n00:12:44.534 --> 00:12:47.784\nif you know where the backups are,\nif you have the comfort and\n\n269\n00:12:47.784 --> 00:12:52.376\nthe knowledge in knowing that you've got\nall the tools required, to be successful,\n\n270\n00:12:52.376 --> 00:12:54.805\nboy, what a different experience this is.\n\n271\n00:12:54.805 --> 00:12:56.765\nBecause then you're just kicking back,\n\n272\n00:12:56.765 --> 00:13:00.069\nyou're just hitting the checklist\nsteps and you're just waiting for\n\n273\n00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:03.668\nwhatever time it takes for the database\nto mount or whatever the case may be.\n\n274\n00:13:03.668 --> 00:13:07.547\nBut you know at the end of that\nroad that there's a successful\n\n275\n00:13:07.547 --> 00:13:12.290\nrestore opportunity there and\nthat things are gonna get better.\n\n276\n00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.940\nWhat I used to hate more than\nalmost anything else in the world\n\n277\n00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.280\nwhen I was first starting out,\nand this was decades ago now.\n\n278\n00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.910\nBut when I was first starting out in\ndoing this, as all of you have done.\n\n279\n00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.440\nAll of us, Daniel I'm sure\nwould be in the same boat and\n\n280\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.140\nadmit the same thing to you when\nhe hears what I'm about to say.\n\n281\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.090\nThat when I was first starting out, and\n\n282\n00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.710\nI didn't really know a lot about\nsome of the things that I had to do.\n\n283\n00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.180\nAnd I was learning as I went,\nas we all do.\n\n284\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.092\nNo shame in that at all you\nalready hated that uncertainty\n\n285\n00:13:36.092 --> 00:13:39.745\nof having to hit that button and\njust not knowing what was gonna happen.\n\n286\n00:13:39.745 --> 00:13:42.546\nAnd was it gonna work and\nif it didn't work,\n\n287\n00:13:42.546 --> 00:13:44.909\nwhat the hell was I gonna do to fix it.\n\n288\n00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:47.738\nBecause the instruction said\nthis is what you did and\n\n289\n00:13:47.738 --> 00:13:51.784\nif I just didn't do it the right way or\nI didn't understand it or whatever,\n\n290\n00:13:51.784 --> 00:13:54.040\nthat was like my best shot, right.\n\n291\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.280\nAnd it was just a gnawing,\ngut wrenching feeling.\n\n292\n00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.510\nIt's one of those things that I\nthink everybody goes through-\n\n293\n00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:01.330\n&gt;&gt; You start to sweat and\n\n294\n00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.480\nyour body gets all hot.\n\n295\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.600\n&gt;&gt; No, those are the meat sweats,\nthat's like totally different.\n\n296\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.462\nBut if you've had that, and if you're\nhonest with yourself and honest with us,\n\n297\n00:14:10.462 --> 00:14:13.860\nbecause secret,\nnobody's listening but us, right.\n\n298\n00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.220\nAnd we're not gonna tell anybody.\n\n299\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.400\nBut the reality is,\n\n300\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.450\nif you're honest with yourself, we've\nall had that experience at some point.\n\n301\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.990\nIt may not have been around this,\nit may not have been around technology,\n\n302\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.847\nwe've all gone through that I'm unsure,\nnot knowing what's gonna happen,\n\n303\n00:14:25.847 --> 00:14:29.730\nand close your eyes and\nkind of do this and hope it's gonna work.\n\n304\n00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.760\nI have a lot of those\nmoments I can look back on.\n\n305\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.240\nAnd I do on a regular basis and\ndraw inspiration from and\n\n306\n00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.900\nsay hey, I'm glad I figured it out and\nI'm glad I know how to do it now.\n\n307\n00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.430\nBut wow, what a reminder for\nmaking sure that I plan to be successful\n\n308\n00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.650\ncuz I don't ever want to do that, I just\nwant to avoid that if it all possible.\n\n309\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.430\nAnd it's important to think about that and\n\n310\n00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.390\nto acknowledge that we don't\nalways have all the answers.\n\n311\n00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.210\nI tell my students all the time,\nI don't have all the answers.\n\n312\n00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.230\nThere are things you're gonna\nask me I don't know how to do.\n\n313\n00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.520\nI'm gonna be honest with you\ntell you I'm not sure, and\n\n314\n00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.760\nI'm gonna try to give it my best shot and\nfigure it out.\n\n315\n00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.150\nAnd if I don't get it right\nthe first time let's work on it and\n\n316\n00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.350\nfigure it out together.\n\n317\n00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:11.590\nBut there is things I just don't know\nhow to do cuz I just, I never done them.\n\n318\n00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.800\nIn all the years I've been doing this\nthere's a lot of stuff I don't do.\n\n319\n00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.950\nSo it's important to dry run\nthat stuff and figure it out.\n\n320\n00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:22.550\nCan't stress just how beneficial that is,\nnot just to your peace of mind but\n\n321\n00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.560\nto the stability and\nthe security of the organization.\n\n322\n00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.580\nReally, really important for\nus to do that.\n\n323\n00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.670\nSo let's talk about moving\nthe operational database.\n\n324\n00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.148\nIf we got to move it to\na different instance of SQL,\n\n325\n00:15:34.148 --> 00:15:35.624\nwhat's gonna happen there?\n\n326\n00:15:35.624 --> 00:15:39.931\nSo, we haven't failed the system,\nthe database itself hasn't failed but\n\n327\n00:15:39.931 --> 00:15:43.240\nwe gotta evacuate the instance for\nwhatever reason.\n\n328\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.900\nPerformance, maintenance,\nsystem's going down, it's going away,\n\n329\n00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.913\nwe're sundowning it, who knows what.\n\n330\n00:15:48.913 --> 00:15:51.947\nWe gotta move it over where we\nhave to move and/or restore it, so\n\n331\n00:15:51.947 --> 00:15:55.264\nit could be either one in theory,\nto a brand new computer hosting SQL,\n\n332\n00:15:55.264 --> 00:15:57.590\nas opposed to restoring\non the existing server.\n\n333\n00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.252\nSo if the database failed\nbecause the server failed,\n\n334\n00:16:00.252 --> 00:16:04.409\nThen this is what we would be doing as\nopposed to server's good, database failed.\n\n335\n00:16:04.409 --> 00:16:07.140\nThat was just what we talked about before,\njust back up and\n\n336\n00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.290\nthen have the restored dump it\nback in to the existing server.\n\n337\n00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.050\nBut if the server itself is the reason for\n\n338\n00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.580\nthe failure, we may have to actually\nrestore on to a brand new server.\n\n339\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.180\nThis gets a little more involved,\n\n340\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.620\nbecause now we got to deal with naming\ninstances as well as moving them and\n\n341\n00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.780\nmaking sure that we rename and\nre-associate to the right server.\n\n342\n00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.010\nAnd so there's a little bit\nmore going on here, right?\n\n343\n00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.780\nBecause we have to update the management\ngroup to tell it where to find\n\n344\n00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.680\nthis information.\n\n345\n00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.410\nRemember, we've got an existing instance\nthat we're working against with\n\n346\n00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.440\nthe management group.\n\n347\n00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.520\nNow we're about to rip all that out and\nsay hey, don't look over here, right,\n\n348\n00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.420\nnow let's go over here.\n\n349\n00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.448\nWell, going over here is\nactually fairly involved, right?\n\n350\n00:16:45.448 --> 00:16:47.265\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because it's not just like yeah,\n\n351\n00:16:47.265 --> 00:16:49.952\nstop calling it George,\nstart calling it Bob, right.\n\n352\n00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:53.148\nIt's a little bit more involved than\nthat because we've gotta figure out all\n\n353\n00:16:53.148 --> 00:16:56.210\nthe different places where that name\nis gonna be, and have to be updated.\n\n354\n00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.940\nIf there's registry instance issues\nwe gotta deal with, there's gonna be\n\n355\n00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.890\ndatabase table updates, not just in\nthe database itself in terms of moving it.\n\n356\n00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.640\nBut then the tables that are there\nthat reference the old server name,\n\n357\n00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.590\nthey have to be updated.\n\n358\n00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.440\nSo there's actually some\nsignificant stuff we gotta do.\n\n359\n00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.082\nThere's a config file that we\ngotta go in and edit as well.\n\n360\n00:17:16.082 --> 00:17:19.000\nSo there's some thing that we're going\nto have to go in and take care of here.\n\n361\n00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.740\nSo let's start talking about this.\n\n362\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.519\nFirst thing, before we even\nget into the demo [INAUDIBLE],\n\n363\n00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:24.090\nI'll go back there in a minute.\n\n364\n00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:25.710\nWhat do you think very first\nthing is we're gonna have to do?\n\n365\n00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.740\nWell, let's just say we already have\nthe back up, got all that stuff done.\n\n366\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.790\nBut let's just think operationally for\na minute.\n\n367\n00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:35.190\nIf we had to now decide, hey,\nwe're gonna start working on this, and\n\n368\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:39.090\nwe gotta tell the management group\nultimately that's there's been changes,\n\n369\n00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.620\nwhat's the very first thing\nyou think we're gonna do?\n\n370\n00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, first thing you'd probably\nhave to do is tell everybody, since it's\n\n371\n00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:47.540\na database, right, there's constantly\ntransactions being written and read from.\n\n372\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.700\nShe has to tell people to stop doing that\nbecause that is making that a constantly\n\n373\n00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.590\nchanging river and you need it to be\nstatic at the moment of change over.\n\n374\n00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.660\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely so we're gonna stop all\nmanager services or ops manager services\n\n375\n00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.150\nrather on all management service\nin the management group.\n\n376\n00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.170\nThis is important, right?\n\n377\n00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.460\nLet's go back here for just one second,\nbring this famous picture up that,\n\n378\n00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.420\nI don't know who but whoever did-\n&gt;&gt; It's like a Rembrandt at this point.\n\n379\n00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.360\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, right just a great picture.\n\n380\n00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.380\nAnd so, I created the picture if you\nhaven't seen the other episodes we keep\n\n381\n00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.580\ntalking about it and joking about it,\n\n382\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.170\nbut it's just a quick Visio\ndiagram that I put together.\n\n383\n00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:21.410\nJust shows the architecture,\n\n384\n00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:25.160\nwe've been using it since very first set\nof episodes on overview and architecture.\n\n385\n00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.440\nAnd we joke about it,\nwe refer to it from time to time.\n\n386\n00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.960\nJust what I want to show\nyou here real quick is,\n\n387\n00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.110\nnot just one management server that we\ngotta stop all business on as Damien said.\n\n388\n00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:38.050\nBut in order to make sure that\nthe raging torrent of a SQL\n\n389\n00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.420\nriver becomes a lazy river, right?\n\n390\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.000\nTo play that analogy out,\n\n391\n00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.360\nwe're gonna stop services across\nthe management server group.\n\n392\n00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.850\nIn other words, the resource pool,\nall the servers,\n\n393\n00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.880\nwe gotta shut down\neverything that's going on.\n\n394\n00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.370\nSo all of the operational manager services\nacross all the managements servers in\n\n395\n00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.600\nthe management group have to be\nturned down rather is essentially.\n\n396\n00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.700\nWe got to stop all activity\nwhile we're in there.\n\n397\n00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.000\nThen back up the database,\nwe don't really have the backup,\n\n398\n00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.720\nwe're going to assume we have the backup.\n\n399\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.850\nWe're kinda jumping ahead and\nsaying that's good.\n\n400\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.210\nWe're gonna copy that backup file\nout to the new SQL Server instance.\n\n401\n00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.750\nThat part is not too difficult.\n\n402\n00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.031\nThen we're gonna open up the management\nstudio, we got that opened up here,\n\n403\n00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:18.107\nas you can see, [SOUND] look,\nit's one of those.\n\n404\n00:19:18.107 --> 00:19:19.859\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND], right up there.\n\n405\n00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:23.190\nSo we have it up there, and\nwe're gonna now start working with it.\n\n406\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.550\nSo before we go in and\nwe do the restore, we'll do the restore.\n\n407\n00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.490\nSo right click,\nwe showed you how to do that.\n\n408\n00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.940\nBut then after that we gotta go to each\nmanagement server in the group and\n\n409\n00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.620\nwe gotta do a little\nediting in the registry.\n\n410\n00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.920\nSo we're gonna bring up\nthe registry editor.\n\n411\n00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.650\nGot that opened up right here and we're\ngonna go into each key local machine,\n\n412\n00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.500\nsoftware, Microsoft, system center,\nand then this part's gonna be a little\n\n413\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.060\nstrange for you, 2010 and\nthen comment and database.\n\n414\n00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.750\nAnd yes I did not misspeak.\n\n415\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.640\nI am saying this correctly.\n\n416\n00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.590\nSystem center, and then 2010, and\nthen common and then database.\n\n417\n00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.400\nAnd if we look down here,\ncould we go full screen just so\n\n418\n00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.880\nyou could see cuz the path\nis down there at the bottom.\n\n419\n00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.700\nIf we look right here at the bottom,\nwe could see the path, right?\n\n420\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.120\nComputer, [INAUDIBLE]\nlocal machine software, or\n\n421\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.580\nMicrosoft System Center\n2010 comment database.\n\n422\n00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.470\nNow you would think, and this is something\nyou just gotta steel yourself for here.\n\n423\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:23.290\nYou go into system center and\nthen right below the 2010 or\n\n424\n00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.210\nright around the system center folder,\n\n425\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.550\nyou'll see system center config,\nsystem center ops, the likely.\n\n426\n00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.800\nOkay, so in your mind it would be hey, let\nme go to System Center ops [INAUDIBLE].\n\n427\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.930\nThat must be where I gotta go to do this.\n\n428\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:35.820\nNo, it's not.\n\n429\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.400\nYou're going into the 2010\ncommon database folder or\n\n430\n00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.840\nsubdirectory through the keys in the hive.\n\n431\n00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.000\nAnd then we gotta come right\nhere to the database name.\n\n432\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.840\nAnd then we gotta change\neither the database name.\n\n433\n00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.860\nWe're not changing that,\nbut if we had to, we could.\n\n434\n00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.390\nWe're gonna come right here to database\nserver name and you'll see right,\n\n435\n00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.860\nI'm gonna click there right there.\n\n436\n00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.640\nThat's the one that's\ngonna have to be edited.\n\n437\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.790\nWe've got to update\nthe database server name.\n\n438\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.680\nWe gotta change the strength\n\n439\n00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.200\nto whatever the new name of\nthe server is gonna be, right?\n\n440\n00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.190\nThe value data has to become now\nthe name of the new instants\n\n441\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.720\nbecause if we don't change it everything\nis going to be pointing on each management\n\n442\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.580\nserver to the old one.\n\n443\n00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.140\nAnd we're not going to be\nable to see the new one.\n\n444\n00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.310\nI think I've got that backwards.\n\n445\n00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.390\nI think on the other one I did, it was\nthe old one was here and the new was here.\n\n446\n00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.380\nAnyway, either way.\n\n447\n00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.840\nBut we have to change that out so\nyou can see that this says sys01,\n\n448\n00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.900\nthat's our current instance.\n\n449\n00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.390\nWe would put in whatever\nthe new instance name is.\n\n450\n00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.800\nSo we'd have to edit the registry key out\nhere, per management server in the group.\n\n451\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.160\nYou got five management servers, after you\nrestore the database to the new instance\n\n452\n00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.200\nso it's operationally now\nsitting waiting to go,\n\n453\n00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.520\nyou gotta go through in\nevery management server.\n\n454\n00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.220\nYou gotta rename the registry key or\nset up a new name in the registry key.\n\n455\n00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.720\nThen, right, so that was step four,\ngotta setup a new instance,\n\n456\n00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.760\ngotta restore the database, do all that.\n\n457\n00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.730\nNow we gotta go into the management server\nstill, do some more editing after we get\n\n458\n00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.770\ndone with the registry,\nwe now have to come in here and\n\n459\n00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.490\nwe have to, this goes back to\nwhat I showed you earlier.\n\n460\n00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:11.470\nWe gotta do a search for config service,\n\n461\n00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:16.480\nthis is the config service config file\nthat we have to go in and we have to edit.\n\n462\n00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.800\nThis is the file that sets up all\nthe services, gives us all the information\n\n463\n00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.380\nabout how to use them and\nmanage them when we install SCOM.\n\n464\n00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.100\nNow I just went into the C drive\nhere on the management server\n\n465\n00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.425\njust to open up file explorer.\n\n466\n00:22:29.425 --> 00:22:33.214\nUse our find or\nsearch function right up here,\n\n467\n00:22:33.214 --> 00:22:36.710\nconfigservice.config, just\ndid a quick search.\n\n468\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.680\nAnd you'll see that we have a couple\nof different instances that show up.\n\n469\n00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.100\nAnd this is important for you to see.\n\n470\n00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:46.860\nYou're gonna ignore the first one,\nthe .cfg file right up there, right.\n\n471\n00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.870\nWe can do this one, the middle one\nis the one we're gonna go in and\n\n472\n00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:50.400\nwe're gonna edit.\n\n473\n00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.730\nAnd then there's a third one which\nis the configservice.config for\n\n474\n00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.720\nthe database instance itself.\n\n475\n00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.080\nWe're gonna do this middle one here.\n\n476\n00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.020\nAnd I'm just gonna bring this up so\nyou can see this.\n\n477\n00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.430\nThat one right there, and\nwe're gonna search for ServerName.\n\n478\n00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.010\nI know it's hard to see,\ncan you go full screen for a second?\n\n479\n00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.480\nI have it highlighted there\nin one of the instances.\n\n480\n00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.650\nI just did a Ctrl+F,\nright, just to do a find.\n\n481\n00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:20.940\nAnd just searched for server name and just\nsaid show me one at a time, all instances.\n\n482\n00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:26.560\nFirst one is right up here, setting name,\nserver name, value, right there for CMDB.\n\n483\n00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.830\nYou'll see right there it's the CMDB.\n\n484\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:33.090\nRight, so, we're gonna go in, and\nwe're gonna find server name instances.\n\n485\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.818\nWe have to edit out the server name\ninstance, and we have to go in and\n\n486\n00:23:36.818 --> 00:23:41.414\nspecify that the server name now becomes\nthe new name for the SQL Server instance,\n\n487\n00:23:41.414 --> 00:23:44.757\nagain, whatever would be just\nlike we did in the registry.\n\n488\n00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:48.666\nWe've gotta put the new name inside\nthe file here and make sure that we tell\n\n489\n00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:52.471\nit where to go in order to make sure\nit knows how to find the new instance.\n\n490\n00:23:52.471 --> 00:23:55.087\nSo we're gonna have to edit\nout this file as well.\n\n491\n00:23:55.087 --> 00:23:58.727\nAnd make sure that's done so\nyou'd be doing that, right?\n\n492\n00:23:58.727 --> 00:23:59.520\nSave that off.\n\n493\n00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.279\nThat's another reason why we're\nshutting all the services down because\n\n494\n00:24:02.279 --> 00:24:03.392\nwe've gotta edit that file,\n\n495\n00:24:03.392 --> 00:24:06.390\nwe're not gonna be able to deal with that\nfile while it's actually being used.\n\n496\n00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.110\nSo we're gonna make sure all the services\nare off, so we can get in there.\n\n497\n00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.075\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n498\n00:24:11.075 --> 00:24:15.295\nThen once we've done that, and that by the\nway is in Program Files &gt; System Center\n\n499\n00:24:15.295 --> 00:24:20.000\n2012 Ops Manager Server, that's in\nthe standard install directory, right?\n\n500\n00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.360\nThen in the SQL Management Studio\nwhich is where we are right now,\n\n501\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.335\nright up there, we're gonna go in and\nwe're gonna find a couple of different\n\n502\n00:24:27.335 --> 00:24:31.135\ntables that we're gonna have to make\nsome edits in and changes as well.\n\n503\n00:24:31.135 --> 00:24:33.175\nI'm in the first of them right here.\n\n504\n00:24:33.175 --> 00:24:38.937\nThis is the DDOMT_Microsoft$sytemcenter$.\n\n505\n00:24:38.937 --> 00:24:42.477\nManagement group, just do that\nwithout renaming right down there.\n\n506\n00:24:42.477 --> 00:24:46.847\nI can actually scroll down just a little\nbit, make this a little bit easier to see.\n\n507\n00:24:46.847 --> 00:24:51.727\nSo this is one of the two that we're gonna\ngo in and we're gonna take a look at, and\n\n508\n00:24:51.727 --> 00:24:55.259\nthis one, just in the table here,\nlet me just scroll up so you can see.\n\n509\n00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:01.010\nI'm inside the Ops Manager database,\noperations manager and\n\n510\n00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:05.120\nthe tables area just opened up the tables\njust literally just scrolling down,\n\n511\n00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.400\nalphabetically till I find it.\n\n512\n00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.060\nLet's scroll the way back down here,\ngot quite a few of them.\n\n513\n00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:14.000\nSo you gotta obviously figure out where\nit is, right there, oops right there.\n\n514\n00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.762\nand then what we're doing is, we're gonna\ngo ahead and we're going to, there we go.\n\n515\n00:25:20.762 --> 00:25:24.500\nWe're gonna right click and I've been\nshowing these to you in kind of read only\n\n516\n00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:29.110\nform and saying open top 1,000 rows, so\nwe don't make a mistake and screw it up.\n\n517\n00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.850\nBut if you wanna edit it, right?\n\n518\n00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:35.210\nWe can right click and we can go in and\nedit as opposed to select, right?\n\n519\n00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.108\nEdit top 200.\n\n520\n00:25:36.108 --> 00:25:38.460\nYou can actually make a change in there.\n\n521\n00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.810\nBig disclaimer, right?\n\n522\n00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.500\nThis is like registry editing.\n\n523\n00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.250\nThere's no oops,\n\n524\n00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.120\nI didn't mean to do that, undo option\nwhen you play around with these tables.\n\n525\n00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.340\nGot to be really careful in here.\n\n526\n00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.360\nSo make sure that if\nyou're gonna go in and\n\n527\n00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.280\nmake changes, you've already mapped this\nout, you know exactly what you're doing.\n\n528\n00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.165\nYou know what you're looking for,\nyou know what you're going to do,\n\n529\n00:25:55.165 --> 00:25:59.145\ncuz if you screw it up, this change is\nessentially in production in real time.\n\n530\n00:25:59.145 --> 00:26:01.975\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n531\n00:26:01.975 --> 00:26:05.035\nYou'll see we've have scrolled across,\nI've scrolled across,\n\n532\n00:26:05.035 --> 00:26:06.707\nI've opened the database table up.\n\n533\n00:26:06.707 --> 00:26:09.412\nJust gonna go come back over here,\nsee you could see this.\n\n534\n00:26:09.412 --> 00:26:12.228\nI'm on the first line right here\nbecause you see the second one is\n\n535\n00:26:12.228 --> 00:26:13.672\nessentially all null.\n\n536\n00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:17.382\nSo I'm on the name, the first line here,\nthe name distance line.\n\n537\n00:26:17.382 --> 00:26:20.824\nI'm gonna go all the way across,\nand what I'm looking for and\n\n538\n00:26:20.824 --> 00:26:24.482\nit's kind of hard to see because\nwhen you bring these things up,\n\n539\n00:26:24.482 --> 00:26:27.190\nthey're gonna look something like this.\n\n540\n00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.730\nSo you really just got to pay attention\ncuz it's really, yeah because there's so\n\n541\n00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.650\nmany items in the column headers, they're\nreally tiny, it's really hard to find.\n\n542\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:34.549\nAnd they're not all,\n\n543\n00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:37.210\nnecessarily in this case they're\nnot all in alphabetical order.\n\n544\n00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.250\nSo you gotta actually be paying\nattention and really just stop and\n\n545\n00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.360\nkinda look at each one.\n\n546\n00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.640\nWhat we're looking for\nis SQL Server name underscore.\n\n547\n00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.200\nAnd then this crazy kind\nof long identifier.\n\n548\n00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.373\nAnd that is, we've put this\ninformation in the show notes for you,\n\n549\n00:26:52.373 --> 00:26:54.054\ntell you what you're looking for.\n\n550\n00:26:54.054 --> 00:27:00.580\nWe're looking for the,\nwhat are we looking for?\n\n551\n00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.120\n6B, 1D, whatever,\nthe name of the number's in there, right?\n\n552\n00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.790\nYou'll be able to see what it is and\nwhatever it happens to be,\n\n553\n00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.850\nwe're gonna come in,\nwe're gonna find this and\n\n554\n00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.140\nthen we're gonna be able to go in and\nwe're gonna make a change here.\n\n555\n00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.150\nSo you see this one says SQL server name,\nwhatever and\n\n556\n00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.790\nit's gonna plot as 0,1 again,\nplots us 0,1.\n\n557\n00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:25.440\nWe're gonna go in and we're going\nto be able to swap that out again,\n\n558\n00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.690\nwhatever the instance name is.\n\n559\n00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:31.070\nSo it's gonna be, now server 2 or\nwhatever we call it.\n\n560\n00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.390\nAnd we're gonna put that in.\n\n561\n00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:36.470\nSo we're gonna make the change there and\nmake sure that we have that information.\n\n562\n00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:40.475\nAnd then we're going to go and\ngo down to our other one.\n\n563\n00:27:40.475 --> 00:27:44.820\nIt's got a, MT Microsoft System Ops\nManager DB at monitoring, right.\n\n564\n00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.840\nSo we're gonna go find the other one.\n\n565\n00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.730\nSame idea, we're gonna open up\nthe other table and do the same thing.\n\n566\n00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:54.530\nLet me just show you what the table is,\ndollar sign System Center Ops Manager.\n\n567\n00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.220\nSo Microsoft Office in the Office Manager.\n\n568\n00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.220\nInstead of M, let's come down here.\n\n569\n00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:07.010\nSo Ops Manager, and we're looking for,\nthat's the App Monitoring.\n\n570\n00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.640\nRight, so Ops Manager, DB, App Monitoring.\n\n571\n00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.476\nThat should be the right one.\n\n572\n00:28:12.476 --> 00:28:13.788\nLet's just do this one.\n\n573\n00:28:15.111 --> 00:28:20.580\nAnd again we're gonna come in here and\nwe're going to be looking for this.\n\n574\n00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.060\nSo we're gonna edit the main\ndatabase server name,\n\n575\n00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.500\nhappens to be this one right here.\n\n576\n00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.420\nLet's just move this over so\nyou can see this.\n\n577\n00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:34.609\nAnd again you'll have a random number\nhere, 5C00C79B, whatever it is.\n\n578\n00:28:34.609 --> 00:28:36.080\nYou could see the number there.\n\n579\n00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.370\nAnd then we're gonna look for\n\n580\n00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:41.030\nthis right there again we're gonna\nchange that instance name out.\n\n581\n00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.410\nPu it in to whatever it is,\nserver 02, whatever we have decided.\n\n582\n00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:48.400\nAnd then once we've done all that right,\nwe've changed all the name instances and\n\n583\n00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.170\nplaces where we have to assume and\nor know that they're gonna be there.\n\n584\n00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.890\nWe're not quite done yet,\nright, we still got more to do.\n\n585\n00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.600\nSo we've got all of that done and\nhopefully that's all gone well.\n\n586\n00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.860\nNow, on the new instance we have to go\nahead and log on for the management server\n\n587\n00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.140\nor action account on the data reader\naccount because they don't exist.\n\n588\n00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.250\nSo we're gonna have to go and\nadd logons for\n\n589\n00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.990\nthem, make sure we have their name and\nthe password and all of that.\n\n590\n00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:18.000\nAnd then we have to add a log on for\nalso the DAS Computer Account,\n\n591\n00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.020\nand enable the following mappings.\n\n592\n00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.760\nWe have a list of two, four,\nsix, eight mappings, I think.\n\n593\n00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.860\nYeah, eight mappings that we have to give\nit in order to give this computer account\n\n594\n00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.740\nall the information it needs and\nthe access it needs.\n\n595\n00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.000\nWe have a complete list of those\nmappings in the show notes.\n\n596\n00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.386\nThe config service,\ndb_accessadmin, db_datareader,\n\n597\n00:29:38.386 --> 00:29:43.374\ndb_datawriter, you could kinda\ntrack through the logic of this and\n\n598\n00:29:43.374 --> 00:29:48.190\nunderstand what they are,\ndb_dbladmin, db_security admin,\n\n599\n00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.815\nSDK_users and SQL_dependency_subscriber.\n\n600\n00:29:51.815 --> 00:29:57.125\nAll of those have to be mapped to the Ops\nManager database dash computer account so\n\n601\n00:29:57.125 --> 00:30:00.845\nthat it has rights to access\nall the information necessary.\n\n602\n00:30:00.845 --> 00:30:03.480\nThen as if that wasn't enough, right?\n\n603\n00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.321\n&gt;&gt; But wait, there's more.\n\n604\n00:30:04.321 --> 00:30:06.577\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's more, there's a lot more.\n\n605\n00:30:06.577 --> 00:30:09.850\nW 've gotta open up a query window\nnow on the Ops Manager database.\n\n606\n00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.924\nAnd we have to execute a query\nthat's gonna show us and\n\n607\n00:30:12.924 --> 00:30:16.477\ntell us what certain options are and\nhow they are configured,\n\n608\n00:30:16.477 --> 00:30:21.122\nand again we've got that query for you in\nthe actual, the set of commands rather I\n\n609\n00:30:21.122 --> 00:30:25.114\nshould say that are in the Show Notes,\nso you could see what they are.\n\n610\n00:30:25.114 --> 00:30:30.597\nWe have to run sp_configure, show\nadvanced options tell us what that is,\n\n611\n00:30:30.597 --> 00:30:34.340\nreconfigure then sp configure,\nCLR enabled.\n\n612\n00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:37.190\nAnd then reconfigure to\nset certain options.\n\n613\n00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:40.770\nThen we gotta run a query that\nallows us to see whether or\n\n614\n00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.480\nnot, or to tell us I should say,\nwhether or not the broker is enabled.\n\n615\n00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.010\nSo we've got a little query run there for\n\n616\n00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.730\nthe Ops Manager Database specifying\na where statement for Ops Manager.\n\n617\n00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.250\nWe then check the results of that output.\n\n618\n00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:59.640\nIf the broker is enabled for the system\ndatabase ops manager, we don't run\n\n619\n00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.740\nthe setup query that alters the database,\nand specifies how it is to be configured.\n\n620\n00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:08.090\nAnd I make reference to this in the notes,\nif it's set up, you kind of skip it.\n\n621\n00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.210\nIf it's not, I'll tell you what to do.\n\n622\n00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.220\nAssuming that everything\nis good at that point,\n\n623\n00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.730\nwe then restart the Ops Manager services\nand everything should come back up.\n\n624\n00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:19.990\nBut this is a fairly detailed process\nto move things around, as you can see.\n\n625\n00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:21.950\nThere's quite a bit to do and\n\n626\n00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.750\nwe have to make sure that we\nare doing it step by step.\n\n627\n00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.260\nNow this was moving\nthe Ops Manager Database.\n\n628\n00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.510\nBut remember, we also have\na Data Warehouse Database [LAUGH], so,\n\n629\n00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.820\nwe have to deal with it as well.\n\n630\n00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.880\nAnd the steps are essentially equally\ninvolved on the Data Warehouse side.\n\n631\n00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.530\nI'm not gonna go through\nall of them with you there.\n\n632\n00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:40.760\nRoughly the same process, roughly more or\nless the same number of steps, but\n\n633\n00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.250\nyou'd also have to substitute where\nwe said Ops Manager Database and\n\n634\n00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.870\nthis table in that database.\n\n635\n00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.680\nWe'd be looking at the data\nwarehouse database,\n\n636\n00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.880\nright, thinking through the same logic.\n\n637\n00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.454\nThere's a slightly different registry key.\n\n638\n00:31:51.454 --> 00:31:55.232\nWe go in and look for as opposed to\nthe register key we talked about for\n\n639\n00:31:55.232 --> 00:31:56.772\nthe Ops Manager database.\n\n640\n00:31:56.772 --> 00:31:59.861\nThis one is local machine software,\nMicrosoft,\n\n641\n00:31:59.861 --> 00:32:02.515\nMicrosoft Ops Manager 3.0 reporting.\n\n642\n00:32:02.515 --> 00:32:03.851\nWe have to specify there for\n\n643\n00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:07.514\nSQL reporting instance where we're\ngonna change that because remember,\n\n644\n00:32:07.514 --> 00:32:10.960\nthat's where the instance key is\nregistered for the data warehouse.\n\n645\n00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.160\nSo there is some different things.\n\n646\n00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.810\nBut we note this in the notes for you.\n\n647\n00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:15.690\nWe're gonna go in.\n\n648\n00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:19.350\nWe do edit the config service file in\nthe same place, so that part's the same.\n\n649\n00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.040\nWe then have to go into\nthe reporting server component and\n\n650\n00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.560\nedit the connection strings.\n\n651\n00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.980\nSo there is some different stuff we do\nbecause we have that reporting server\n\n652\n00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.010\nsitting out there connecting to\nthe database if you remember.\n\n653\n00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:33.690\nLet's just take a look real quick\njust at a picture that we were\n\n654\n00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:34.870\ntalking about before.\n\n655\n00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.580\nWe've got this reporting server\ninstance sitting out here\n\n656\n00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.710\nmost likely connecting to\nthe data warehouse database.\n\n657\n00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:45.640\nAnd we have to address this interchange\nas part of moving this database.\n\n658\n00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.800\nBecause if we move it then,\nand we rename the instance,\n\n659\n00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.910\nthis reporting server no longer knows\nhow to get to it and interact with it.\n\n660\n00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.040\nSo we gotta address this as well.\n\n661\n00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.540\nSo there's some backend stuff that\nhappens on the report server.\n\n662\n00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.520\nWe gotta go into the config manager, or\n\n663\n00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.150\nthe configuration interface\nof our report server and\n\n664\n00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.760\nchange some of the strings that tell\nus how to connect and where to do that.\n\n665\n00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.690\nAnd then we go in and\n\n666\n00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.460\nedit those database tables, roughly\nalong the same lines we just showed you.\n\n667\n00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.600\nWe make sure all of that is up to date.\n\n668\n00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.940\nThen we go ahead and we create\nthe associated log on accounts and\n\n669\n00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.860\nspecify whatever mappings they may need.\n\n670\n00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.460\nAnd then we restart the AI database and,\nrather we start the management server\n\n671\n00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.470\ngroup, and assuming the database\nhas been set up the right way,\n\n672\n00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.570\neverything should come up and\nshould run with no trouble.\n\n673\n00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:33.050\nSo it is two fairly involved processes\nwhen we have to relocate these databases.\n\n674\n00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:36.660\nGotta keep this in mind, gotta make\nsure that we understand that there is\n\n675\n00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:41.445\na very specific prescribed order or\nset of steps that we have to follow.\n\n676\n00:33:41.445 --> 00:33:43.755\nThis is not one of those\nthings you just wanna wing.\n\n677\n00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:45.660\nOr say, yeah,\nI think I'll just go do this.\n\n678\n00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.085\nAnd step by step you're missing things.\n\n679\n00:33:48.085 --> 00:33:49.295\nYou gotta keep going back and doing it.\n\n680\n00:33:49.295 --> 00:33:55.175\nIt does involve a very methodical, very\nspecific, very orchestrated set of steps.\n\n681\n00:33:55.175 --> 00:33:58.115\nSo I wanna make sure you know\nyou need to follow those.\n\n682\n00:33:58.115 --> 00:34:00.465\nWe've documented those for\nyou in the notes.\n\n683\n00:34:00.465 --> 00:34:02.245\nYou can use those as a general guide.\n\n684\n00:34:02.245 --> 00:34:05.060\nThere is website documentation out there,\nfor\n\n685\n00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:10.120\nrecovery, in case something changes\nbetween now and the time you may try this.\n\n686\n00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.840\nJust take a quick look out on the web,\n\n687\n00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.820\nmake sure that those steps are not\nmodified in any way for any reason,\n\n688\n00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.910\nin case anything got modified,\nchanged, you know who knows what.\n\n689\n00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:23.110\nYou never know and then you should be all\nset to be able to do a relocate/restore as\n\n690\n00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.540\nopposed to just simply restore and place.\n\n691\n00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.575\nSo that's the whole enchilada.\n\n692\n00:34:27.575 --> 00:34:29.070\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's the whole enchilada.\n\n693\n00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:33.733\nAll right, Adam, thanks for explaining\nthe work flow when it comes to disaster\n\n694\n00:34:33.733 --> 00:34:37.980\nrecovery, especially when it pertains\nto our operational database and\n\n695\n00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.316\ndatabase warehouse.\n\n696\n00:34:39.316 --> 00:34:40.630\nLike you said, very involved steps.\n\n697\n00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:41.760\nVery specific.\n\n698\n00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.920\nAnd particular types of things that you\nhave to do which we have laid on the show.\n\n699\n00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.780\nWe know you are good people but\nthanks for like kind of guiding us\n\n700\n00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.886\nthrough what that's gonna look\nlike if we ever had to do then.\n\n701\n00:34:51.886 --> 00:34:54.170\nAnd if we wanna practice\nthat we can do that as well.\n\n702\n00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.100\nAnd looking at the clock though,\nwe are well out of time for\n\n703\n00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.970\nthis episode, luckily, we have come to the\nend of the content for this very topic,\n\n704\n00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:02.250\nso how about that?\n\n705\n00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.840\nThat's what I call serendipitous.\n\n706\n00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.850\nThanks for watching, everybody.\n\n707\n00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:06.520\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n708\n00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.630\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n709\n00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.440\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n710\n00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.416\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n711\n00:35:12.416 --> 00:35:18.081\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n712\n00:35:18.081 --> 00:35:21.347\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",
