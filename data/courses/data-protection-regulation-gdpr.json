[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.597 --> 00:00:08.347\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.347 --> 00:00:12.640\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.739\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:21.570\nAnd today, we're gonna be covering\nthe General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n9\n00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.680\nNew regulation that's coming\nout in the European Union.\n\n10\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.570\nHere to help us discuss\nsome of the details and\n\n11\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.510\nfiner points of what we can expect out of\nthis new regulation is Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.480\nWelcome, Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Hello, hello, hello, hello.\n\n14\n00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.411\nLet me formally shake your hand,\n\n15\n00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:37.863\nwe're being formal because this is\na discussion about regulation after all.\n\n16\n00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:41.611\nIt's an interesting topic, and I'm glad\nMike's gonna be here to share some time\n\n17\n00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:44.291\nwith me, and with all of you,\nand help us to discuss this.\n\n18\n00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:48.720\nBut as you were saying as we got started,\nso the GDPR, right, a regulation.\n\n19\n00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.694\nAnd we were literally just chatting as\nwe were getting ready to come on for\n\n20\n00:00:51.694 --> 00:00:54.960\nthe episode, and talking about the fact\nthat the breadth, right, the scope,\n\n21\n00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.935\nthe coverage if you will,\nof this regulation.\n\n22\n00:00:56.935 --> 00:01:01.906\nIt's kind of interesting,\nbecause like any law, like any statute or\n\n23\n00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:06.385\nstandard, if you will,\nany kind of legislation in a country.\n\n24\n00:01:06.385 --> 00:01:11.083\nOr in this case, in a political entity,\nthe EU is made up of many member countries\n\n25\n00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:15.110\nas I'm sure everybody is aware,\nthese laws have to be interpreted.\n\n26\n00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.936\nWe have to understand them as individuals,\nwe have to be aware of them.\n\n27\n00:01:17.936 --> 00:01:21.457\nBut the interesting thing about\nthe regulation, the GDPR,\n\n28\n00:01:21.457 --> 00:01:26.496\nthe General Data Protection Regulation, in\nthis case, and some things that have come\n\n29\n00:01:26.496 --> 00:01:31.396\nbefore it, the Data Protection Act, what\nwe call the DPA, the directive on privacy\n\n30\n00:01:31.396 --> 00:01:36.800\nand the protection of privacy rights which\nthe GDPR is ultimately gonna replace.\n\n31\n00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.030\nEuropean directive 9546,\nthe famous one you often hear me and\n\n32\n00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.950\nmany other people that talk about\nsecurity talk about from time to time.\n\n33\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.630\nPrivacy rights, things of that nature\nhave always been important for\n\n34\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.850\nus as information security professionals.\n\n35\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.130\nBut really, EU for\ndecades has been on the forefront\n\n36\n00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.100\nof this movement around protecting the\nrights of the individual, privacy rights,\n\n37\n00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.380\nand data protection rights in general.\n\n38\n00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.184\nSo you look at the legislation\naround the world and\n\n39\n00:02:02.184 --> 00:02:06.723\nlook at the standards that we think of and\nadhere to in our industry of the European\n\n40\n00:02:06.723 --> 00:02:09.557\nstandards are some of the toughest,\nrightly so.\n\n41\n00:02:09.557 --> 00:02:13.599\nAnd have really blazed the trail for\nus, led the way with regards to how we\n\n42\n00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.117\ninterpret and\nthink about not just privacy,\n\n43\n00:02:16.117 --> 00:02:19.696\nnot just the rights of the individual,\nprotection around PII,\n\n44\n00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:24.270\npersonally identifiable information,\nall the things we think of today.\n\n45\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.400\nMost of the landmark work and\nreally the change in culture,\n\n46\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.720\nthe thought processes that we\nhave seen over the last 20,\n\n47\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.670\n30 years, have come from a work that's\nbeen done in the EU around these topics.\n\n48\n00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.540\nSo, it's great to finally see\n\n49\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.040\nthe next generation of these legislative\nefforts coming to bear fruit.\n\n50\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.951\nThe European directive,\nin this case the GDPR,\n\n51\n00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:49.720\nreally starts out life many,\nmany years ago.\n\n52\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.380\nIt was a series of thought processes over\ntime that led to, as it often does, right,\n\n53\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.247\nin these cases, years of negotiation\nwork in the European Union Council\n\n54\n00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:04.474\nto figure out what the new direction\nwould be, to negotiate and\n\n55\n00:03:04.474 --> 00:03:09.462\nultimately craft the legislation that\nleads to this particular effort.\n\n56\n00:03:09.462 --> 00:03:14.446\nAnd as of the 27th of April,\n2016, we finally see that\n\n57\n00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:19.530\ncoming to fruition,\nthe formal passing of the regulation and\n\n58\n00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.200\nthe then clock that has kind of started\nto tick associated with implementation.\n\n59\n00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.930\nIt's kind of interesting because when we\nthink about efforts like this, in some\n\n60\n00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.350\ncases, it can take years just to get to\nthe point where people sit in a room and\n\n61\n00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.590\nsay, okay,\nwe think this is something worth doing.\n\n62\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.030\nAnd then, there has to be\nthe whole process of negotiation,\n\n63\n00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.500\nthere has to be the process of approval.\n\n64\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.854\nBut then this kind of an effort\ndoesn't take effect right away.\n\n65\n00:03:43.854 --> 00:03:48.784\nAs a matter of fact, as I said, this\nparticular effort comes to fruition in\n\n66\n00:03:48.784 --> 00:03:53.700\nmid to late April of 2016,\nwith a clock that then spans two years.\n\n67\n00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.176\nAnd goes into effect over\na two year sliding period,\n\n68\n00:03:57.176 --> 00:04:02.796\nfinally to be in effect and enforceable\nthe target date, 25th of May, 2018.\n\n69\n00:04:02.796 --> 00:04:05.466\nAnd so it's interesting as\nwe see kind of just that\n\n70\n00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:09.737\nthought process behind this spinning up\nbecause there is these chunks of time.\n\n71\n00:04:09.737 --> 00:04:13.410\nBut there are these chunks of time that\nhelp us to really not only think about\n\n72\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.455\nwhat the impact of the regulation will be,\nbut also to plan and get ready, right?\n\n73\n00:04:17.455 --> 00:04:18.972\nBecause that's one of the biggest\nthings we have to do.\n\n74\n00:04:18.972 --> 00:04:21.748\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna have to put\ncontrols in place to make sure we're\n\n75\n00:04:21.748 --> 00:04:22.681\ncompliant with this.\n\n76\n00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:25.808\nFigure out what all the details are so\nrather than just slap it on here,\n\n77\n00:04:25.808 --> 00:04:28.670\nsay, look, tomorrow,\nyou have got to be compliant with this,\n\n78\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.610\nthey give you a little bit of time to get\neverything in place, which is very nice.\n\n79\n00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.410\n&gt;&gt; It's very important.\n\n80\n00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.590\nAnd so, if you wanna take a look here,\njust real quick,\n\n81\n00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.020\njust to show you what we're\nactually talking about, right?\n\n82\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.690\nSo you could see,\ncan we go full screen just so\n\n83\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.060\nthat you can see all those\npretty words behind it?\n\n84\n00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.850\nThere we go.\n\n85\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.760\nSo this is literally the legislation,\nright?\n\n86\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.620\nThe legislative Act from the official\njournal of the European Union.\n\n87\n00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.669\nYou could find this online.\n\n88\n00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.176\nLiterally, all you have to to do\nis go out and Google for GDPR,\n\n89\n00:04:55.176 --> 00:04:57.792\nlegislation or words that affect.\n\n90\n00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:02.316\nYou'll see multiple links,\nbut from the EUR-Lex,\n\n91\n00:05:02.316 --> 00:05:07.662\nthe European-Lex legal site,\nyou will find this listing.\n\n92\n00:05:07.662 --> 00:05:12.762\nThis is the actual published\nregulation from the official journal\n\n93\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:17.892\nthat lists the goings on within\nthe EU Council and ultimately puts\n\n94\n00:05:17.892 --> 00:05:22.502\nout the formal statements around these\nthings and the actual body of the work.\n\n95\n00:05:22.502 --> 00:05:26.647\nAnd so, we can see it's 88 pages,\nas all good regulations and laws are.\n\n96\n00:05:26.647 --> 00:05:28.347\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Lots of things to talk about.\n\n97\n00:05:28.347 --> 00:05:32.310\nBut you could see the formal\nstructure here, right?\n\n98\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.470\nYou could see Regulation (EU) 2016/679\nof the European Parliament and\n\n99\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.900\nof the Council as of 27th April 2016 on\nthe protection of natural persons with\n\n100\n00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.620\nregard to the processing of personal data\nand on the free movement of such data.\n\n101\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.020\nRepealing directive 9546 which is\nthe earlier one that I mentioned.\n\n102\n00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.510\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation,\nGDPR, which is what we're talking about.\n\n103\n00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.070\nAnd then it goes on to just obviously\ndo what all legal documents do,\n\n104\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.560\nvery beautiful flowery language.\n\n105\n00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.746\nLays out the thought processes and\nall the things that will happen.\n\n106\n00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:08.737\nThere are a series,\nlet me just scroll down so\n\n107\n00:06:08.737 --> 00:06:12.630\nyou can see,\nthere are a series of statements in here.\n\n108\n00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.406\nThey're numbered as we go down,\nand you kind of start to read.\n\n109\n00:06:16.406 --> 00:06:17.990\nI'm not gonna scroll through 88 pages,\n\n110\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.800\njust giving you a general sense,\nbut you start to read here.\n\n111\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.790\nAnd every paragraph or statement that's\nnumbered starts to lay out ideas and\n\n112\n00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.940\nspeak to things that we\nwill need to be aware of.\n\n113\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.800\nSo, for instance, if you look at\njust number 14, as just one example.\n\n114\n00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.680\nProtection afforded by this regulation\nshould apply to natural persons\n\n115\n00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.766\nwhatever their nationality or\nplace of residence.\n\n116\n00:06:37.766 --> 00:06:41.343\nMike and I will tell you about this\nparticular topic, specifically before\n\n117\n00:06:41.343 --> 00:06:44.936\nwe came on, right, in relation to\nthe processing of their personal data.\n\n118\n00:06:44.936 --> 00:06:49.832\nThis regulation does not cover processing\nof personal data which concerns legal\n\n119\n00:06:49.832 --> 00:06:54.728\npersons and in particular undertakings,\nestablishes legal persons including\n\n120\n00:06:54.728 --> 00:06:59.770\nthe name and the form of the legal person,\nthe contact details of the legal person.\n\n121\n00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.100\nSo there's a lot of complex language,\ncomplex ideas,\n\n122\n00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.980\nright, potentially confusing\ninformation in here.\n\n123\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.930\nWhat is a legal person, right?\n\n124\n00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.767\nWhat is a natural person?\n\n125\n00:07:10.767 --> 00:07:14.334\nI mean, these are things that may not\nmake sense to the average individual.\n\n126\n00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:19.240\nIt's language that we don't normally use,\nfor instance, when we as either\n\n127\n00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.477\nindividuals or IT professionals\ntalk about something like this.\n\n128\n00:07:23.477 --> 00:07:26.196\nIt's not how normal people\nwould sit around the table and\n\n129\n00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:29.717\nrefer to themselves, I'm a natural person,\nI'm a legal [CROSSTALK]\n\n130\n00:07:29.717 --> 00:07:31.210\n&gt;&gt; I'm a legal person.\n\n131\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.350\n&gt;&gt; You just don't hear that, right?\n\n132\n00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.085\nThat's just not what you hear.\n\n133\n00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:36.732\nBut in addition,\nit also lays out thoughts and\n\n134\n00:07:36.732 --> 00:07:42.730\nreally builds these ideas in a very\nspecific, very, very structured way.\n\n135\n00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:48.160\nThere's kind of an art and a science to\nhow these legislative documents are built.\n\n136\n00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.764\nAnd so it takes a while to\nget into the meat of this and\n\n137\n00:07:50.764 --> 00:07:53.135\nreally have a sense of this and\nunderstand it.\n\n138\n00:07:53.135 --> 00:07:57.433\nAnd you raised a great point when we\nwere talking just before we came on for\n\n139\n00:07:57.433 --> 00:07:59.910\nthe episode about a statement like this.\n\n140\n00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.310\nLike who does it apply to?\n\n141\n00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:06.598\nIs it everybody and/or is it certain\ncategories or classifications of people?\n\n142\n00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:08.450\nAnd if so, how do we know that?\n\n143\n00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:13.194\nAnd what does that mean in the nature\nof not only personal information but\n\n144\n00:08:13.194 --> 00:08:16.691\nin the kind of the now\nthe technology times we live in,\n\n145\n00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:22.490\nthe cloud as you mentioned specifically\nwhich is not only a huge equalizer, right?\n\n146\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.790\nBut it's also a huge enabler for\nthe global migration of information.\n\n147\n00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.860\nReally borderless computing right?\n\n148\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.250\nIs this what we think of it as?\n\n149\n00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.920\n&gt;&gt; As an American company I might think\nwell this doesn't apply to me, but yet\n\n150\n00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.970\nif we think back,\nwe've put our data up in the clouds.\n\n151\n00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.610\nAnd in order to have some fall tolerance,\nwe followed your principles,\n\n152\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.782\nat least a thousand miles away.\n\n153\n00:08:41.782 --> 00:08:44.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if our servers fail here in this\n\n154\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.800\ncloud provider,\n\n155\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.030\nthey're gonna fail over to another cloud\nprovider that could be in Europe, right?\n\n156\n00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.030\nAnd now all of a sudden,\nbut I forgot about that.\n\n157\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.420\nI'm thinking, these don't apply to my data\nbut yet my data's housed over there, so\n\n158\n00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.680\nin fact it does.\n\n159\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.510\n&gt;&gt; It does because one of the kind of the\nunderlying assumptions if you will, and\n\n160\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.650\nit's well known to people\nthat deal with this.\n\n161\n00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.590\nBut for the average individual probably\ndon't give it a second thought, but\n\n162\n00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:13.120\none of the underlying assumptions\nabout this is the regulations in play.\n\n163\n00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.730\nThe laws that will apply\nbased on jurisdiction and\n\n164\n00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.220\nbased on the ability for\nthose laws to bind you and\n\n165\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.390\nthe actions you take or don't take and\nrules and rights you do and\n\n166\n00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:27.080\ndon't have is based on geographic\nlocation, as you were suggesting.\n\n167\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.430\nSo if my data is in the boundary or\n\n168\n00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:36.880\nborder of the geographic entity that is\ngoverned by these rules, then and the law\n\n169\n00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.930\nis applied to that data because the data\nis now going to be beholding to that.\n\n170\n00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.130\nAnd when that data moves\ninto the geographic\n\n171\n00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.410\nsphere of the EU that data now maybe\nsubject a different set of laws,\n\n172\n00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.395\nthen perhaps the laws that apply in\nthe European Union, certainly very\n\n173\n00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:58.425\ndifferent from laws that apply in America,\nlaws that apply in other geographies and\n\n174\n00:09:58.425 --> 00:10:01.825\nother areas and Middle East,\nLatin America, in Asia.\n\n175\n00:10:01.825 --> 00:10:03.645\nAs I mentioned in our\nintroductory remarks,\n\n176\n00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:08.275\nthe EU has some of the most stringent\nprotections on records for rights,\n\n177\n00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:11.700\nprotections of privacy rights and rights\nof the individual and data protection.\n\n178\n00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:17.420\nAnywhere in the world today, and so\nthat really does change the playing field,\n\n179\n00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.940\nbecause one of the things\nbusinesses have to understand and\n\n180\n00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.980\nas a result individuals who choose to put\ntheir data in their hands of a business.\n\n181\n00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.560\nAnd we do this hundreds of time probably a\nday without even necessarily even thinking\n\n182\n00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.310\nabout the implications of it.\n\n183\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.849\nIs this idea of this borderless\nmovement of information?\n\n184\n00:10:34.849 --> 00:10:38.055\nYes, there are international borders\nthat by no means we will imply for\n\n185\n00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:41.262\na minute that we have done away with\nthe concept of the Nation State, but\n\n186\n00:10:41.262 --> 00:10:43.678\nyou know the concept of\nthe Nation State and borders.\n\n187\n00:10:43.678 --> 00:10:45.043\nWhen it comes to the movement of people,\n\n188\n00:10:45.043 --> 00:10:47.590\nit is very different than when it\ncomes to the movement of data.\n\n189\n00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:52.170\nData doesn't have to have a passport,\nright, and data doesn't have to stop and\n\n190\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.150\nbe interdicted at a border and\nbe examined, and\n\n191\n00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:59.460\nperhaps be denied entry based on a set\nof criteria the way humans beings do.\n\n192\n00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.080\nI mean, that just doesn't work that way,\nit never has.\n\n193\n00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.860\nAnd so as a result data flows freely,\nrelatively speaking, right?\n\n194\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.470\nData flows freely, in many places\nof the world, not in all places.\n\n195\n00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:13.400\nWe know certainly, there are many\ngeographic areas of the world where data\n\n196\n00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.270\ncan move freely and is for\nthe most part unobstructed, but\n\n197\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.690\nthen there are areas in the world\nwhere data is going to be constrained.\n\n198\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:24.000\nYou know the Great Firewall and things of\nthat nature that we often hear about, and\n\n199\n00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.610\nthere are definitely regimes in\nthe world where the free flow of\n\n200\n00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.130\ninformation is antithetical\nto what they do and\n\n201\n00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.630\ntheir interpretation of how law\nshould be applied to their citizens.\n\n202\n00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.800\nAnd that's that particular area and\nthat's just the way that is, but\n\n203\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.420\nin most of the world, data flows across\nborders really without a second thought.\n\n204\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.530\nAnd because it moves so freely, one of the\nchallenges we have is that we don't really\n\n205\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.410\nstop necessarily as individuals and take\ninto account what that may mean for us.\n\n206\n00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:55.320\nAnd it may that in many respects\nwe have more protection.\n\n207\n00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.460\nAs a result of a set of laws\nlike this being applied,\n\n208\n00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.810\nbut the flip side of that\nis that businesses may or\n\n209\n00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.600\nmay not understand the implications of\nhow to live up to those requirements.\n\n210\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600\nAnd that's really where, for\n\n211\n00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.110\ninstance, I would be concerned\neither as an individual.\n\n212\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:15.160\nHey you've got Mr. Credit Card Company,\nMrs. ISP, or whatever.\n\n213\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.280\nSo the nameless, faceless entities in\nthe world that control customer data,\n\n214\n00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.110\nhundreds, thousands,\nmillions of customer records.\n\n215\n00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.940\nI as an individual putting my\ndata into the pool, right?\n\n216\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.140\nI don't stop and think about when\nI apply for a credit card or\n\n217\n00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.580\nwhen I open an account, when I buy\nsomething as a customer from the Amazons,\n\n218\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.800\nthe Alibabas of the world,\nwhatever it is, who ever it is, Ebay.\n\n219\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.160\nDon't wanna leave anybody\nout of that list, right?\n\n220\n00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.040\nWhen I buy from anybody, I probably as\nmost of you do, don't really stop and\n\n221\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.540\nthink, okay.\n\n222\n00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.500\nWhen I put my surname,\nmy full name, my address, etc.\n\n223\n00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.830\nIn, that information is\nstored somewhere and\n\n224\n00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.990\nultimately more than one\nentity has rights to see that.\n\n225\n00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:59.170\nAnd that data may exist in multiple\nplaces and indeed it does.\n\n226\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.650\nAnd as a result you know\nwhile we go through life and\n\n227\n00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:05.390\nprobably don't give that a second thought\nuntil hopefully this never happens.\n\n228\n00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.554\nBut until perhaps somebody takes that\ndata does something untoward with it or\n\n229\n00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:12.964\nin some ways pretends to be us,\nmasquerades, who knows what.\n\n230\n00:13:12.964 --> 00:13:16.147\nWe don't wanna give a second thought to\nour data running around the planet as\n\n231\n00:13:16.147 --> 00:13:19.330\nlittle bits and bytes right, but\nreality is it's happening all the time and\n\n232\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.863\nI'm not suggesting that that means that we\nhave problems with information security\n\n233\n00:13:22.863 --> 00:13:24.127\nand the storage of that data.\n\n234\n00:13:24.127 --> 00:13:26.060\nMost companies do the right thing.\n\n235\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.640\nThey understand how to\nstore data securely, but\n\n236\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.980\nwe've certainly seen massive evidence,\nalmost without fail everyday\n\n237\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.850\naround the world that there are also\na lot of holes in that thought process.\n\n238\n00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.750\nAnd that for\nevery company that does it right,\n\n239\n00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.200\nthere are also a lot of companies that\nare not so good at doing it right.\n\n240\n00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.590\nFor a variety of reasons, without\ntrying to necessarily blame anyone.\n\n241\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.490\nAnd to me, it's not about blaming who\nis doing good and who is doing bad and\n\n242\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.220\nblaming those who are doing bad is\nabout trying to bring everybody into\n\n243\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.480\na space where they can all benefit\nfrom the idea of doing better.\n\n244\n00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.780\nRules like this help us to really create\nstructure around the ideas of how we\n\n245\n00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:06.180\nmanage data in such a way that companies\nare politely encouraged, right,\n\n246\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.670\nto take a better stance and ultimately to\ntighten up the safeguards around data.\n\n247\n00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.490\nSo that data management does become better\nand ultimately benefits all of us, right.\n\n248\n00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.279\nSo the reforms around.\n\n249\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.194\nThe change out of EU-directed 9546,\n\n250\n00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:26.970\nthe General Directive on Data Right\nprotection and the move towards the GDPR.\n\n251\n00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.060\nThis idea of updating if you will.\n\n252\n00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.190\nReally two instruments have been created.\n\n253\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:35.150\nWe focus on the GDPR in this episode and\nthis series of discussions,\n\n254\n00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:39.790\nreally designed to make individuals\nbetter able, as I was suggesting,\n\n255\n00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.450\nto control their personal data.\n\n256\n00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.676\nBut there's another element\nthat goes with this,\n\n257\n00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:46.896\nthe data protection directive which\nis another part of this discussion.\n\n258\n00:14:46.896 --> 00:14:49.844\nAlthough we're not going to\nspend as much time on it,\n\n259\n00:14:49.844 --> 00:14:54.363\ndesigned to enable the police and criminal\njustice sectors to deal with and ensure\n\n260\n00:14:54.363 --> 00:14:58.443\nthat things like the rights of victims and\ndata around victims in a crime.\n\n261\n00:14:58.443 --> 00:15:02.888\nWitnesses and suspects around this\nwhole process are also protected in\n\n262\n00:15:02.888 --> 00:15:05.250\nthe context of investigations.\n\n263\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.160\nOn the context of\nthe management of that data\n\n264\n00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.300\nthrough any kind of law\nenforcement action.\n\n265\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.570\nYou really have two distinct pillars\nthat have been created here.\n\n266\n00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:17.890\nOne for the average individual,\noutside of anything that may have to go on\n\n267\n00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.540\naround some sort of law\nenforcement action.\n\n268\n00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:26.090\nThe GDPR, the use of just customer data,\ncollection of data, marketing.\n\n269\n00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.460\nAll those kind of activities that we\noften just See in the background and\n\n270\n00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.180\nthink about.\n\n271\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.710\nAnd then the data protection directive\nis specifically designed to deal\n\n272\n00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:39.450\nwith issues associated with the pursuit\nby law enforcement of crime and\n\n273\n00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.360\nthe prosecution of that crime and\nall the evidence gathered around that.\n\n274\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.490\nBecause we have to think about protecting\nthe individuals that are The subject of\n\n275\n00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.600\nthe crime, or the victim of the crime,\nin a different way.\n\n276\n00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.370\nThey have rights.\n\n277\n00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.130\nCertainly, they have to be protected.\n\n278\n00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.540\nSomebody who has been the victim of a\ncrime, we don't want to use their name and\n\n279\n00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.520\nso identify them in certain situations.\n\n280\n00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.055\nIt may put them in harm's this way,\nbecause maybe\n\n281\n00:16:00.055 --> 00:16:03.545\nnow other people will find out that that's\nhappened, and who knows what can happen.\n\n282\n00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:06.553\nAll right so, there's this whole other\nthought process associated with that\n\n283\n00:16:06.553 --> 00:16:08.114\ncalled the data protection directive.\n\n284\n00:16:08.114 --> 00:16:11.968\nSo it's important that we start to\nbegin to think about the concepts here.\n\n285\n00:16:11.968 --> 00:16:15.232\nTo at least lay out the idea that\nwe do have multiple theories and\n\n286\n00:16:15.232 --> 00:16:18.261\nthought processes going on\naround updating protection.\n\n287\n00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:21.764\nIt wasn't that long ago that\nyou would log on to a computer,\n\n288\n00:16:21.764 --> 00:16:24.300\ninformation would be gathered about you.\n\n289\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:29.114\nAnd you really, outside of the EU,\nhad minimal to no protection as to what\n\n290\n00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:32.000\nthat data would be,\nwhere it would wind up.\n\n291\n00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.289\nIn some countries that's still the case,\nyou are just rolling the dice,\n\n292\n00:16:35.289 --> 00:16:36.837\nplaying roulette with your data.\n\n293\n00:16:36.837 --> 00:16:38.750\nYou don't really know what's\ngonna happen with it.\n\n294\n00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.239\nAnd you, as an individual and as consumer,\n\n295\n00:16:41.239 --> 00:16:44.212\nhad no rights to claim that\ndata in a meaningful way.\n\n296\n00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:48.370\nI mean, try to call up a company,\nin many cases around the world today, and\n\n297\n00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.820\ntry to have them give you an accurate\nrepresentation of your customer data.\n\n298\n00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.390\nIt's very hard to do, trying to get them\nto wipe you out of the customer database.\n\n299\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:02.220\nWhat we have now commonly come to call\nin the EU as a result of legislative\n\n300\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.700\nefforts there,\nthe right to be forgotten, right?\n\n301\n00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.648\nI mean,\nwe don't have outside of the EU today,\n\n302\n00:17:07.648 --> 00:17:10.007\nliving in any other part of the world,\n\n303\n00:17:10.007 --> 00:17:14.802\nan established published legal framework\nthat guarantees us as individuals\n\n304\n00:17:14.802 --> 00:17:19.698\nthe right to not only control our data\nwithin certain reasonable boundaries.\n\n305\n00:17:19.698 --> 00:17:23.253\nBut, and I'm talking about personal\ndata when I say our data, PII,\n\n306\n00:17:23.253 --> 00:17:27.423\npersonally identifiable information about\nus, but we also have a legal right to\n\n307\n00:17:27.423 --> 00:17:31.656\nactually have that data removed under\nvery specific controlled circumstances,\n\n308\n00:17:31.656 --> 00:17:36.561\nprotecting both the business who maintains\nthat data and the individual who owns it.\n\n309\n00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:39.631\nAnd let's be clear,\nthe individual owns the data, right?\n\n310\n00:17:39.631 --> 00:17:44.392\nWe own our own data according to most,\nif not all, legal interpretations.\n\n311\n00:17:44.392 --> 00:17:47.660\nIt's not just the EU's but just about\nany country anywhere in the world.\n\n312\n00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.470\nHowever, the company is the custodian\nof that data during that transaction.\n\n313\n00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.465\nThey are maintaining it and using it,\nhopefully with our consent, right?\n\n314\n00:17:55.465 --> 00:17:56.872\n[LAUGH] We think that would be the case.\n\n315\n00:17:56.872 --> 00:17:59.480\nSo they're not always the case,\nbut normally that is the case.\n\n316\n00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.160\nWhat I mean by not always the case\nis lot of times, our data, and\n\n317\n00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.652\nI shouldn't say without our consent,\nwithout our knowledge, probably a better\n\n318\n00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:08.575\nway of framing that, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm sure we consented with some\n\n319\n00:18:08.575 --> 00:18:10.020\nlittle check mark, somewhere.\n\n320\n00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.470\n&gt;&gt; We did, and that's the point,\nright, that's the subtlety in this.\n\n321\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:17.930\nIs that during the initial gathering\nof that data by, let's say Company A.\n\n322\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:22.010\nWe, among the many things we probably said\nyes to was, somewhere in there, a clause,\n\n323\n00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.920\nas Mike suggested [LAUGH],\nburied in all that language.\n\n324\n00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.210\nThat says that the company will have the\nability to be able to use your data and\n\n325\n00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.784\nperhaps share it with other partners for\nmarketing purposes.\n\n326\n00:18:32.784 --> 00:18:34.720\nThere's different ways they frame that.\n\n327\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.760\nBut essentially, there's some sort\nof legal language in there that\n\n328\n00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.860\ngives the company, Company A, the company\nthat gathered the data originally,\n\n329\n00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.700\nthe right under constrained circumstances.\n\n330\n00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.030\nBut the circumstances\ntypically favor them.\n\n331\n00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:47.970\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n332\n00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.650\n&gt;&gt; To be able to share that\ndata with other entities.\n\n333\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.880\nAnd unless you are aware of that and\n\n334\n00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.790\nopt out in some way, then it is most\nlikely the case that that will happen.\n\n335\n00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:02.191\nAnd so you go from applying for a credit\ncard with bank A to suddenly now getting\n\n336\n00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:06.980\ntrip information about time shares from\ncompanies that you never knew about.\n\n337\n00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.480\nAnd the reason for that is that\nthese companies are co-marketing.\n\n338\n00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.980\nThey are co-mingling your data,\nsharing it amongst themselves.\n\n339\n00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.110\nRemember today your bank\nis not just a bank anymore,\n\n340\n00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.170\nan online brokerage\nentity that sells things.\n\n341\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:25.300\nThe ebays, the Amazons of the world, these\nmassive online retail establishments,\n\n342\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.620\nare not just your retail establishments,\nright?\n\n343\n00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:32.430\nI mean look at the line of business\nAmazon as a company owns, or is behind.\n\n344\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:37.200\nLook at the lines of businesses that Citi\nBank, or Bank of America, or Lloyd's, or\n\n345\n00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.480\nany of the huge banks of\nthe world are behind.\n\n346\n00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.658\nNot singling them out by any means and\nsaying they're good or\n\n347\n00:19:41.658 --> 00:19:44.404\nbad, just these are some of the biggest\ninstitutions in the world, right?\n\n348\n00:19:44.404 --> 00:19:47.533\nWhen you look at them,\nthey've got their lines of business\n\n349\n00:19:47.533 --> 00:19:50.720\nscattered around the world\ndoing all sorts of things.\n\n350\n00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.194\nAnd we don't necessarily think about that,\nright?\n\n351\n00:19:53.194 --> 00:19:57.020\nBut they do everything, and so as a\nresult, they're sharing that customer data\n\n352\n00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.780\namong their business\nsegments to their advantage.\n\n353\n00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.323\nAnd so you're gonna get all that\nadditional information shared and\n\n354\n00:20:03.323 --> 00:20:04.810\ncollaterally marketed.\n\n355\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.639\nSo we have often lost control of the flow\nof our data because of these opt-ins\n\n356\n00:20:09.639 --> 00:20:13.939\nwhere we passively, by signing\nan initial agreement without, and\n\n357\n00:20:13.939 --> 00:20:18.101\nlet's be honest how many of us\nread the terms of service, right?\n\n358\n00:20:18.101 --> 00:20:21.689\n&gt;&gt; I will say I have tried a couple\nof times, I've made the effort.\n\n359\n00:20:21.689 --> 00:20:25.736\nBecause I thought, I'm checking these\ncheck marks, I'm giving you my data and\n\n360\n00:20:25.736 --> 00:20:29.870\nyou're saying in big, bold letters there,\nwe do not share your data.\n\n361\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.250\nLet's click on this link that\nsays a little more information.\n\n362\n00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.410\nAnd you realize that, well,\n\n363\n00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.860\nwe're not gonna share your data with\nother people but business associates?\n\n364\n00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.330\nThat's okay, business partners and\nthings like that, so\n\n365\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.400\nthey really are sharing my information.\n\n366\n00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.910\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n&gt;&gt; But they don't make it easy for\n\n367\n00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.840\nthe average person to interpret what\nthey're planning on doing with that data.\n\n368\n00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.520\n&gt;&gt; It's very hard.\n\n369\n00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.410\nI mean the legal ease is as I call it,\nright?\n\n370\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.400\nThe language associated with\nthat is incredibly confusing.\n\n371\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.640\nYou just saw in the one little paragraph,\nthree,\n\n372\n00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.910\nfour sentences we just broke down and\ndissected inside the new GDPR regulation.\n\n373\n00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.192\nAnd that's baby steps there.\n\n374\n00:21:05.192 --> 00:21:08.740\nThere are some that are half a page\nlong that are in a different language.\n\n375\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're not in English,\n\n376\n00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:10.273\nI don't know what language they're in,\nbut they're not in English.\n\n377\n00:21:10.273 --> 00:21:14.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I do this stuff for\n\n378\n00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:14.730\na living, right?\n\n379\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.580\nAnd I mean, I have trouble\nunderstanding what they're saying.\n\n380\n00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.690\nIt would be entirely refreshing and\ndifferent if they just said okay,\n\n381\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.950\nwe're gonna take this stuff,\ndefine this way, and\n\n382\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.700\nwe're gonna put it in this bucket,\nand nobody's gonna see it but you.\n\n383\n00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.630\nAll the other stuff is in this bucket, and\n\n384\n00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:32.820\nanybody who has a relationship with\nthat company could potentially see it.\n\n385\n00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.090\nDoes that make sense, Adam and Mike?\n\n386\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.460\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah,\nthat makes a lot of sense.\n\n387\n00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.670\nI may not like that but\nat least I understand that, right?\n\n388\n00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:44.520\nBut it's 88 pages of natural people and\nlegal people and\n\n389\n00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.930\nyour contact details of the legal\nperson but only in this condition.\n\n390\n00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.736\nAnd this is why people hate lawyers.\n\n391\n00:21:50.736 --> 00:21:53.838\nI mean, because, it's so\ndifficult to figure this stuff out.\n\n392\n00:21:53.838 --> 00:21:57.873\nBut ultimately it is our job,\nand as Mike pointed out,\n\n393\n00:21:57.873 --> 00:22:03.143\nour responsibility, most importantly,\nas individuals potentially\n\n394\n00:22:03.143 --> 00:22:07.465\nproviding data under a framework,\nin this case the GDPR.\n\n395\n00:22:07.465 --> 00:22:11.596\nAnd to understand what the rights,\nthe responsibilities,\n\n396\n00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:14.677\nand the liabilities may\nbe of our decisions.\n\n397\n00:22:14.677 --> 00:22:16.660\nBecause that is, at the end of the day,\n\n398\n00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.520\nthe only thing that we\nreally have control over.\n\n399\n00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.810\nDo we understand and\n\n400\n00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:25.270\nare we making good informed decisions,\nbased on the rules of the game?\n\n401\n00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.580\nAnd let's be honest,\nthis playbook is 88 pages long, right?\n\n402\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.050\nAnd of the 88 pages,\n\n403\n00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:34.250\nthere's probably about 80 pages of stuff\nthat we really need to pay attention to.\n\n404\n00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.710\nLast time I had to memorize and\n\n405\n00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.272\nunderstand 80 pages of rules,\nI didn't do so well on the exam.\n\n406\n00:22:39.272 --> 00:22:42.397\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't achieve success,\n\n407\n00:22:42.397 --> 00:22:44.310\nlet's put it that way.\n\n408\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.560\nAnd so it's very difficult for\n\n409\n00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.790\nthe average individual to really\nwrap their head around this.\n\n410\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.933\nAnd I don't think that's ever gonna\nchange, I'll honest with you.\n\n411\n00:22:50.933 --> 00:22:54.965\nBut what I do think that the GDPR\nhas done, continues to do,\n\n412\n00:22:54.965 --> 00:22:58.916\nbecause I think prior legislation\nthat we stand on top of,\n\n413\n00:22:58.916 --> 00:23:02.303\nthe DPA as I mentioned,\nThe Data Protection Act,\n\n414\n00:23:02.303 --> 00:23:08.060\nother acts that have come in between the\nDPA and the GDPR in the EU specifically.\n\n415\n00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.927\nHave really built a platform that,\nwhile not perfect,\n\n416\n00:23:10.927 --> 00:23:14.709\nbecause everything could always be better,\nI think is better by leaps and\n\n417\n00:23:14.709 --> 00:23:18.066\nbounds than almost anything else\nwe have around the world today.\n\n418\n00:23:18.066 --> 00:23:21.627\nAnd really is, without overstating it,\nthe gold standard for privacy and\n\n419\n00:23:21.627 --> 00:23:24.490\ndata protection for\nthe rights of the individual.\n\n420\n00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.210\nSome of the key components of GDPR,\n\n421\n00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:30.210\nwe've just talked about the high level of\nthe logic and the thought process, but\n\n422\n00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.540\none of the most important points is\nharmonization across and beyond the EU.\n\n423\n00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:38.760\nThis idea of every member state within\nthe EU having to operate essentially and\n\n424\n00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.250\nthink essentially as one entity,\none voice, one legislative agenda.\n\n425\n00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.030\nAnd that's been the case for\nthe EU since its founding.\n\n426\n00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:49.917\nI mean, that's the guiding principle,\none of them, behind the foundation,\n\n427\n00:23:49.917 --> 00:23:52.247\nthe formation, and\nthe maintenance of the EU.\n\n428\n00:23:52.247 --> 00:23:56.942\nSo that's obvious, but the regulations\nintended to established a single set of\n\n429\n00:23:56.942 --> 00:24:01.497\nrules that are enforced both within\nthe EU, and as we talked about, beyond and\n\n430\n00:24:01.497 --> 00:24:03.238\nacross the borders of the EU.\n\n431\n00:24:03.238 --> 00:24:08.125\nBecause any business from the outside\nthat is doing business in the EU,\n\n432\n00:24:08.125 --> 00:24:10.243\nfrom anywhere in the world, or\n\n433\n00:24:10.243 --> 00:24:15.626\nthat holds data on citizens of the EU Is\nnow going to have to play by these rules.\n\n434\n00:24:15.626 --> 00:24:19.078\nNow, this has also been the case for\nprior directives,\n\n435\n00:24:19.078 --> 00:24:21.440\n9546 had the same stipulations.\n\n436\n00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.540\nIf you were a business in North America,\nlet's say, and\n\n437\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.600\nyou held data on European citizens,\nand/or did business with\n\n438\n00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.850\nEuropean Union entities, you had to\nstep up and play by more or less\n\n439\n00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:39.340\nthe interpretative rules of the directive,\nin this case the 9546 directive.\n\n440\n00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.010\nNow there were some outs.\n\n441\n00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.740\nAnd some negotiated softening of those\nrules depending on where you were in\n\n442\n00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.600\nNorth America specifically.\n\n443\n00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.300\nIn the United States,\nthere was something called the Safe Harbor\n\n444\n00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.630\nclauses that were enabled for\nseveral countries.\n\n445\n00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.160\nThe United States among them.\n\n446\n00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.880\nThat allowed at least for the majority of\nthat time, for a negotiated stance between\n\n447\n00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:04.040\nthe United States let's say as the entity\nthat was trying to seek an exception.\n\n448\n00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.250\nAnd the EU is able to\nfigure out how to enforce\n\n449\n00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:12.110\nthe adherence to the regulation but not\nthe letter of the regulation rather than\n\n450\n00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:16.560\nthe spirit of the regulation which is\nessentially what safe harbor represents.\n\n451\n00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.850\nThe idea that we would be held accountable\nand held to a standard, but not have to\n\n452\n00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:24.820\nfollow the letter of the law, but rather\nthe spirit of the law, in order to comply.\n\n453\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.250\nBecause the United States and other\ncountries that negotiated safe harbor\n\n454\n00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:33.330\nclauses as one-offs with the EU, were\nnot at the same place and did not have\n\n455\n00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:39.010\nthe ability to comply at the same level as\nthe EU was requiring in their directives.\n\n456\n00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.350\nThis became an established way for\ncompanies, and as a result,\n\n457\n00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.190\nfor countries that represented\nthem to have this ability.\n\n458\n00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.840\nBut it didn't lead to a softening.\n\n459\n00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.030\nIt just led to an interpretation\nthat may not have been as strict.\n\n460\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.470\nI'm essentially saying\nthe same thing I said earlier,\n\n461\n00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.700\nbut the spirit of the law was there.\n\n462\n00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.540\nAnd so\nthis idea of harmonization continues.\n\n463\n00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.200\nProbably one of the most important things.\n\n464\n00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.210\nWe are subject to jurisdiction\nof EU regulators.\n\n465\n00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:09.590\nJust by collecting data and managing it,\nwith regards to anybody who is a resident.\n\n466\n00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.220\nSo even if I'm a country,\na company rather,\n\n467\n00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:17.500\nthat has data on a single e-resident,\nI am under the interpretation of the GDPR,\n\n468\n00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.910\nsubject to the GDPR rules and\nregulations, and e-regulators\n\n469\n00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:26.090\nhave the right to come in and see what I'm\ndoing with that data, under the law and\n\n470\n00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:31.110\nhold my company accountable, and\nthere are significant fines financially.\n\n471\n00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.260\nWe'll talk about it in\nsome upcoming episodes,\n\n472\n00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:38.740\npotentially associated with the\nmishandling of data underneath the GDPR.\n\n473\n00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:44.500\nYou know, hundreds, thousands,\nmillions of dollars are localized into\n\n474\n00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.780\nwhatever the currency is, but essentially\nrepresented in the EU currency in euros.\n\n475\n00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.950\nBut potentially, millions of Euros,\nfines for mishandling this data,\n\n476\n00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.740\nup to a certain percentage of\nthe total gross revenue of the company\n\n477\n00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.010\nover the course of a year can be levied\nas fines, which when you think about it,\n\n478\n00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:04.770\ncross border and cross political\nentity may be a really difficult sell.\n\n479\n00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:09.290\nI mean, try to sell a company here\nin the US and collection, right,\n\n480\n00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.160\nin a European court.\n\n481\n00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.670\nThat may be tough on a good day,\nbut the reality is,\n\n482\n00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:17.220\nthe EU has this massive club they can\nswing which is, hey, okay, guess what?\n\n483\n00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.390\nWe're never gonna collect that money,\nno problem.\n\n484\n00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.800\nTry doing business inside\nthe EU going forward, right.\n\n485\n00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because we're\n\n486\n00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.310\ngonna essentially shut the borders and\nyou're not coming in.\n\n487\n00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.310\nAnd by the way,\nif you have assets here, guess what?\n\n488\n00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.025\nThey're ours.\n&gt;&gt; We now own them, all right?\n\n489\n00:27:30.025 --> 00:27:31.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because you're not getting them back\n\n490\n00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.010\nuntil you pay your fine, all right.\n\n491\n00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:36.310\n&gt;&gt; But you know, for a lot of American\ncompanies, that maybe we're not a huge\n\n492\n00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:40.750\norganization and we don't have\noffices anywhere else globally, so\n\n493\n00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.500\nwe think okay well this\ndoesn't pertain to me.\n\n494\n00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.510\nBut almost every business has a web\npresence and we can sell globally.\n\n495\n00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.960\nAnd so there's a very good chance that we\nhave customers that are part of the EU so\n\n496\n00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.450\nthis definitely affects our business.\n\n497\n00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:55.710\n&gt;&gt; It can, and there are exceptions for\nsmaller businesses in certain areas.\n\n498\n00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.000\nFor instance we'll talk a bit more about\nthis idea of a protection officer,\n\n499\n00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.070\na data protection officer.\n\n500\n00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:06.000\nIt's called a DPO under the legislation,\nwhich is a mandated role\n\n501\n00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.140\nthat now companies have to bring on and or\nif they already have, kind of repurpose.\n\n502\n00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.740\nA lot of companies already have,\neither in the I.A.\n\n503\n00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.130\nin information assurance, or\nthis management office or\n\n504\n00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:20.760\nsome kind of function that kinda fall in\nto this category anyway, oversight through\n\n505\n00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.030\na government risk and compliance\nscheduling, that's GRC activities.\n\n506\n00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:27.330\nWe tend to have somebody, or\na group of entities, in this role.\n\n507\n00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.890\nIt's just a matter for many companies,\nand especially big global ones,\n\n508\n00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.530\nrepurposing them and\nnaming them accordingly.\n\n509\n00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.570\nBut for smaller entities,\nthat's probably not the case.\n\n510\n00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:40.720\nAnd so, with companies under\na certain threshold 250 employees.\n\n511\n00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.600\nWe have an opt out where we don't\nnecessarily need to do some\n\n512\n00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.530\nof these things because the legislation\nrecognizes, hey, you're small.\n\n513\n00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.610\nYou're probably not gonna have the means\nand the resources necessarily to do this.\n\n514\n00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.650\nAnd so these are some of the things that\nare there, we'll certainly uncover them,\n\n515\n00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.200\ntalk a little bit more about them.\n\n516\n00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.490\nBut it's really becoming a very\ndifferent thought process,\n\n517\n00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:03.650\nin the sense that we're being asked\nnot only to level the playing field.\n\n518\n00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:08.090\nIn the sense that now this political\neconomic entity sitting in the heart of\n\n519\n00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:13.010\nEurope has really created this idea\nof equality under the law, for\n\n520\n00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:15.370\ndata protection for\nthe rights of the individual and\n\n521\n00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:20.740\nis pushing that out other entities whether\nthey necessarily see it that way or not.\n\n522\n00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:26.080\nAnd you'll say look we don't necessarily\nmandate that you must do this,\n\n523\n00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.760\nwe understand and certainly acknowledge\nthat you may have a different national,\n\n524\n00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.060\na legal interpretation.\n\n525\n00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.170\nWant to respect that, but you have to\nrespect the fact if you come play in our\n\n526\n00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.260\nhouse you play by our rules, right?\n\n527\n00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.800\nAnd as a result because this\nis one the most important\n\n528\n00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:45.120\nareas of the world in terms of economics,\npolitics, social interaction.\n\n529\n00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.640\nIt is not the only one but\nit's very big and important one.\n\n530\n00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:53.010\nThis is now having a lot of weight and\na lot of impact because as you said,\n\n531\n00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.210\nyou know try to buy something\nonline today, right?\n\n532\n00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.400\nI mean you could buy from anywhere almost\nIf you know how to look and certainly\n\n533\n00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.200\nknow how to search you could find\nthings from all over the world, right?\n\n534\n00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.752\nYou know about my espresso fetish.\n\n535\n00:30:02.752 --> 00:30:03.700\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n[LAUGH]\n\n536\n00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.790\n&gt;&gt; So one of the things that I do and\n\n537\n00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:09.230\nI travel with cuz i spend a lot\nof time traveling or my work.\n\n538\n00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.610\nAs many of you have heard me talk\nabout over episodes in time.\n\n539\n00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.470\nBut you know I take my freeze dried\nespresso with me because I can't always\n\n540\n00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.250\nfind espresso where I go.\n\n541\n00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:22.130\nAnd it's hard living in\nthe United States to find,\n\n542\n00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.610\nas crazy as that is today,\nto find freeze dried espresso.\n\n543\n00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:30.340\nIt's a thing that just is not as\npopular in the US as it is in Europe.\n\n544\n00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.910\nAnd whenever I'm in Europe I\nbuy like suitcase full.\n\n545\n00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.520\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I know I can't find it here.\n\n546\n00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.970\nBut at some point I run out, and\n\n547\n00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.580\nI got to that point recently on my trip to\nSingapore as you and I were talking about.\n\n548\n00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.690\nAnd I was down to my last couple, and.\n\n549\n00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:45.320\nI could not walk,\n\n550\n00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.506\nI was all over trying to find it it's not\npopular in Singapore either apparently.\n\n551\n00:30:49.506 --> 00:30:50.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n552\n00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.290\nthat may find me the epiphany I'm\nlike well, duh, just go online,\n\n553\n00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.480\nthey gotta sell the stuff right?\n\n554\n00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.000\nI mean.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n555\n00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.107\n&gt;&gt; And not like you could only buy it\n\n556\n00:30:57.107 --> 00:30:57.640\nin a store right?\n\n557\n00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.230\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; It's the 21st century I can find this\n\n558\n00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.330\nstuff anywhere,\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n559\n00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.840\nI went online and sure enough, I can find\nit from Nescafe directly online, right.\n\n560\n00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.490\nI just have to go look it up go to eBay or\nwherever I wanna go and buy it.\n\n561\n00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.760\nAnd I can get it, but it's more expensive.\n\n562\n00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.900\nI mean, that's often the down side, right,\nis that there is a premium to get it and\n\n563\n00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.140\nto be able to, and by the way,\nthey did not ship to Singapore.\n\n564\n00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.730\nI could buy it, but\nI'd have to have it shipped to the US.\n\n565\n00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.420\n&gt;&gt; Which is not a big deal,\nbut for some odd reason,\n\n566\n00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.180\nthey would not ship it to Singapore.\n\n567\n00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.573\n&gt;&gt; Which is kind of just,\nI think it's that more than anything else,\n\n568\n00:31:26.573 --> 00:31:28.725\nwe talk about the expense of\nbringing stuff in the country.\n\n569\n00:31:28.725 --> 00:31:32.340\nSo the $20 box of coffee went to $45-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n570\n00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.280\n&gt;&gt; So I wanted to get it.\n\n571\n00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.460\nBut it's interesting because you\ncan get almost anything today.\n\n572\n00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:40.290\nWe don't really acknowledge borders when\nit comes to e-commerce in that respect.\n\n573\n00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:44.140\nBut at the same time, we have to think\nabout the fact that the data comes from\n\n574\n00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:48.540\nan area and the customer is in an area and\nthe product is in an area.\n\n575\n00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.650\nAnd if those areas are not legally\naligned, there are can be conflict and\n\n576\n00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:53.970\nthat is something to consider.\n\n577\n00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.830\nSo it's kind of interesting\nif we get started,\n\n578\n00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.270\nwe're gonna develop this thought\nprocesses more in some upcoming episodes.\n\n579\n00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:03.930\nContinue to drill down and some of the\nbasics surrounding the GDPR, look under\n\n580\n00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.850\nthe hood a little bit more about what's\nsome of the supporting elements are,\n\n581\n00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:12.710\ndefine this idea of personal data really\nsitting at the heart of the GDPR.\n\n582\n00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:13.460\nWhat is data?\n\n583\n00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.830\nWhat is personal data?\n\n584\n00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:15.700\nHow do we deal with that?\n\n585\n00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.940\nWhat are the ideas and the roles\ndefined of controllers and processors?\n\n586\n00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.160\nThe people that are setting the stage for\nhow we do stuff.\n\n587\n00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.530\nThe people that are actually actuating and\ndoing the things that are called for\n\n588\n00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.080\ncontrollers control, processors process.\n\n589\n00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.040\nSounds obvious but we'll talk more about\nthose roles and what they are implementing\n\n590\n00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.410\nappropriate technical controls and\nhow we deal with that.\n\n591\n00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:40.270\nI mentioned the data protection role\nalready, I use a lot of additional\n\n592\n00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.600\ndetail will develop you about\nseven additional conversations.\n\n593\n00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.890\nI look forward to spending that time with\nyou and talking about those topics but\n\n594\n00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:47.810\nwe are gonna have to come back and\n\n595\n00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.630\ndo that in another episode I think\n&gt;&gt; Alright Adam Gray start your discussion\n\n596\n00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.440\nabout general data protection regulation.\n\n597\n00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.190\nWe've got more exciting\nepisodes coming your way, but\n\n598\n00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.840\nwe are out of time for this one.\n\n599\n00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.350\nSo signing off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Mike

00:00:10.379\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.300\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.360\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and\n\n6\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.730\ntoday we're talking about\nthe General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n7\n00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.570\nThis is actually a part two\nas we continue our overview\n\n8\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.960\nof the General Data Protection regulation.\n\n9\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.000\nAnd, here to continue on with us, is Mr.\nAdam Gordon, welcome back, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.080\n&gt;&gt; So, how many times can we say\nGeneral Data Protection regulation\n\n11\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.210\nin one sentence?\n\n12\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.327\nIt's actually easier than\njust saying the acronym,\n\n13\n00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:37.840\ncuz I always flip the acronym around.\n\n14\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.190\n&gt;&gt; GPDR instead of GDPR, okay,\nI could see that, all right.\n\n15\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.210\n&gt;&gt; Because we have the Gainesville\nPolice Department, GPD, and I'm used to.\n\n16\n00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.630\n&gt;&gt; You interact with\nthem on a regular basis?\n\n17\n00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes all the time.\n\n18\n00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I understand,\nthen I could see how that may be an issue.\n\n19\n00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.750\nAll right, so, if anybody's looking for\nMike Rodrick, you know where to find him.\n\n20\n00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.520\nAll right, so we're gonna continue\nour conversations, right?\n\n21\n00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.740\nAround the overview, kinda just\ngetting to know a little bit more\n\n22\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.440\nabout GDPR as we get\nstarted talking about it.\n\n23\n00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.260\nWe'll have some episodes that'll come up\nthat will be a little bit more specific in\n\n24\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.870\ncertain topical areas.\n\n25\n00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.395\nWe're going to define and break out\nall the rights of the individual up\n\n26\n00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:14.320\nunder the GDPR, and\ndo a little focus episode on each one,\n\n27\n00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.145\nperhaps more than one depending\non the the discussion.\n\n28\n00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:18.645\nSo a lot of good stuff to come.\n\n29\n00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:21.885\nBut we still have to lay out some of\nthe foundational thought processes,\n\n30\n00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:24.605\ndefine some of the concepts\nat a high level.\n\n31\n00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:26.085\nThe end of the last episode,\n\n32\n00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.125\nI hit the highlights on some of\nthe ones we would talk about.\n\n33\n00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:33.365\nWe ended the episode really focusing on\nthe idea of harmonization of the GDPR,\n\n34\n00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:35.605\nthe regulatory thought process.\n\n35\n00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:37.025\nNot just within the borders of the EU,\n\n36\n00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:41.840\nbut essentially extending it,\nas we talked about out beyond the borders.\n\n37\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.900\nTo incorporate the commerce and or\n\n38\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.070\nthe consumption and the control of data\nby any entity outside of the EU, but\n\n39\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.460\nthat is doing business with EU nationals,\nor is doing business within the EU itself.\n\n40\n00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.810\nSo, a multinational company that has\noffices somewhere in the EU would\n\n41\n00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.240\nhave to be bound by\nthe GDPR in other words.\n\n42\n00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.340\nA business outside the EU, in Asia,\nin the Middle East, in Latin America,\n\n43\n00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.350\nin North America that is gonna contain and\nhold data and\n\n44\n00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.890\ntransact business with EU nationals\nis gonna bound by the GDPR.\n\n45\n00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.400\nSo, we were just talking about the logic\nof that extensive web of connectivity.\n\n46\n00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.965\nAnd the logic of now having to,\nas an individual who understands or\n\n47\n00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:30.685\nhopefully knows better about their rights,\nas a business, as an IT professional,\n\n48\n00:02:30.685 --> 00:02:34.424\nas a security professional, who may\nnow have to operate within an entity.\n\n49\n00:02:34.424 --> 00:02:38.090\nThat has to rethink their\nposition on data rights and\n\n50\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.620\nprotection with regards to the GDPR.\n\n51\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.430\nWe wanna to start informing\nthose conversations and\n\n52\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.790\nreally thinking more about them.\n\n53\n00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.690\nBecause when we think about this\nas an individual it's good to say,\n\n54\n00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.870\nhey we've got these additional rights,\nwe're gonna protect your data.\n\n55\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.320\nWell that's awesome, I mean,\nI think that's great.\n\n56\n00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.970\nBut as an IT professional, as an IT\nprofessional who has got a security focus\n\n57\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.890\nin a business, who now may have to either\nhelp the business interpret what our\n\n58\n00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.600\nresponsibilities and rights are now\ngoing to have to be aligned with.\n\n59\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.540\nAnd as a result to see what our\ncontrols and countermeasures may be\n\n60\n00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.190\nto align with the protections requirements\nafforded to individuals under the GDPR.\n\n61\n00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.747\nI may not be so excited about that,right?\n\n62\n00:03:16.747 --> 00:03:18.280\nI mean, it's a good thing.\n\n63\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.930\nBut it's gonna require some rethinking\nof probably traditional approaches,\n\n64\n00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.650\nthought processes, and\na retooling of policies, of procedure,\n\n65\n00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.240\nof process, a change in the way we\nlook at the world, auditability,\n\n66\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.030\nstandards and verification and\nvalidation activities.\n\n67\n00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.550\nThe whole dynamic of GRC,\nof governance risk and\n\n68\n00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.490\ncompliance, really has to be extended and\nmodified to address\n\n69\n00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.400\nthese forward thinking changes in\nthe way in which we approach data.\n\n70\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.670\nSo, it's definitely a different landscape.\n\n71\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.030\nIf I'm standing here thinking,\nas an IT and\n\n72\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.070\nsecurity professional,\nwhat are gonna be our exposures,\n\n73\n00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.320\nwhat are the liabilities as a business\nwe now face holding this data?\n\n74\n00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.040\nI'm looking at this from a very\ndifferent perspective than I would be if\n\n75\n00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.600\nI was an individual excited,\n\n76\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.270\nin theory, about the idea of\na right to be forgotten, right?\n\n77\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.460\nBecause maybe I wanna now control\nmy data at a different level.\n\n78\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.270\nSo, it is something that is gonna cause\nsome concern and perhaps some disruption.\n\n79\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.860\nYeah, and I know we've been\ntalking a little bit about scope.\n\n80\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.860\nNow, what about,\nwe've be talking about EU persons or\n\n81\n00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.760\nlegal or national-\n&gt;&gt; Or residents.\n\n82\n00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.910\nNations of the EU, right.\n\n83\n00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.910\n&gt;&gt; What about, let's say me, an American\ncitizen who buys a product from\n\n84\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.470\nan European country and now my\ninformation has gone in their database.\n\n85\n00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.370\nDo I get any protection from this?\n\n86\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, so, great question,\nright, and great thought process.\n\n87\n00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.370\nSo, as a customer, quote unquote, right?\n\n88\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.100\nA natural person if you\nwill in our dialog.\n\n89\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.990\nBut as a legal natural person,\nthe idea would be that your data going\n\n90\n00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.323\ninto a database, let's say hypothetically,\nin a company, let's call it company U.\n\n91\n00:04:49.323 --> 00:04:53.285\nAll right, in company U,\nmaybe it's based in France or\n\n92\n00:04:53.285 --> 00:04:57.285\nin Germany, or\nperhaps in any of the EU members.\n\n93\n00:04:57.285 --> 00:05:00.040\nDoesn't really matter where,\nany of the EU member countries.\n\n94\n00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.280\nIf it is gonna be, well, let's exclude the\nUK, because, as we know, they're exiting\n\n95\n00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.060\nthe EU now, but they are still technically\na member of the EU for time being.\n\n96\n00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.890\nEven in the UK, for the moment,\nbecause until Brexit is complete,\n\n97\n00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.950\nthey are not bound, they are still bound,\nI should say, by the European laws.\n\n98\n00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.670\nAnd even afterwards they will\nmost likely have agreements in\n\n99\n00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.180\nplace that will bind them on\nthe majority of these stances.\n\n100\n00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.800\nSo let's just assume hypothetically,\nthat any of those member countries,\n\n101\n00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.970\nyour data is there.\n\n102\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.950\nAs a customer, as an individual, your data\nhas to be protected to this standard.\n\n103\n00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.340\nNow you may live outside the EU,\nas you suggested.\n\n104\n00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.960\nAnd as a result, you may not have legal\nstanding necessarily to come into the EU\n\n105\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.750\nand say, well, I want to sue company U,\nbecause they did this or this or this.\n\n106\n00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.930\nBecause you're not a European national,\n\n107\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.830\nyou may not be able to directly bring\na suit in a European court of law.\n\n108\n00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.210\nBecause you just don't\nnecessarily have standing.\n\n109\n00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.180\nBut that doesn't mean that the rights\nassociated with protection of your data\n\n110\n00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.670\nare any less important.\n\n111\n00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.190\nIt just means that you may\nhave to pursue legal action\n\n112\n00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.440\nunder certain constrained conditions\nbecause you're not a citizen of the EU.\n\n113\n00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.700\nAnd you may not necessarily have the same\nabilities as a citizen to do that,\n\n114\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.520\nbut your data is still protected.\n\n115\n00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.730\nSo, technically your data\nwould be protected at\n\n116\n00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.390\nthe same exact level as an EU national\nbecause it is held by an EU based company.\n\n117\n00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.400\nAnd an EU based company within boundary,\nwithin the geography of EU, is bound by or\n\n118\n00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.360\nwill be bound by these,\n\n119\n00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.840\nthe GDPR requirements once\nthey come into force in 2018.\n\n120\n00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.100\nSo it is an interesting dichotomy,\nan interesting question because we live\n\n121\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.930\noutside but because our data lives in the\nboundaries within the geography defined,\n\n122\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.970\nthe data is extended the protection that\nthe individual may not normally have.\n\n123\n00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.830\nBecause we're not resident there,\nbut our data is.\n\n124\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.550\nSo it's kind of interesting in that\nrespect because the data takes on a life\n\n125\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.460\nof its own in that respect.\n\n126\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.150\nIf you think about the logic of it, right?\n\n127\n00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.760\nSo speaking of data, so\nlet's talk about what is data.\n\n128\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.080\nWe classify data, right?\n\n129\n00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.320\nWe were just talking about data.\n\n130\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.540\nAnd what kind of data would be in that\ncustomer record, hypothetically, right?\n\n131\n00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.450\nLet's think about that.\n\n132\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.230\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Probably your name.\n\n133\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.410\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure I'm filling in my name,\nI'm gonna have to give them an address,\n\n134\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.240\nif I'm buying products,\nso, to ship it over.\n\n135\n00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.700\nThen I've gotta pay for it somehow, so\n\n136\n00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.830\nmaybe I'm giving them\ncredit card information.\n\n137\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.860\n&gt;&gt; Credit card, most likely, or\nsomebody else's credit card information.\n\n138\n00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.460\n&gt;&gt; Or somebody else's, that I've borrowed.\n\n139\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\nyou may not worry too much about that.\n\n140\n00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.170\n&gt;&gt; My name is Adam Gordon.\n\n141\n00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.980\n&gt;&gt; Let's assume, yeah, right,\nnumber 1234 56789 0000, right?\n\n142\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.420\nLet's assume for just a minute that\nyou're doing this the right way.\n\n143\n00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.780\nAnd, that would be in theory your credit\ncard or your banking information or\n\n144\n00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.060\na combination of that, who knows?\n\n145\n00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.150\nBut, we would classify any and\nall of that as personal data, right?\n\n146\n00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.650\nThis is under the GDPR and\nand both the directives.\n\n147\n00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.860\nSo both remember of these legislative\nareas that we talked about.\n\n148\n00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.607\nThe GDPR deals with individuals,\nremember, the directive deals with\n\n149\n00:07:48.607 --> 00:07:52.052\nthe individual rights with regards\nto a law enforcement action.\n\n150\n00:07:52.052 --> 00:07:54.748\nSo in either area because\nwe do have personal data.\n\n151\n00:07:54.748 --> 00:07:58.626\nAssociated with individuals in both,\nwe classify this information,\n\n152\n00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:02.373\nthe information Mike was just kind\nof going down the checklist on that\n\n153\n00:08:02.373 --> 00:08:06.381\nwe would typically provide during some\nsort of commercial transaction or\n\n154\n00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:08.830\nwith any business, capturing anything.\n\n155\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.242\nIt doesn't mean that\nyou're buying something.\n\n156\n00:08:10.242 --> 00:08:15.058\nI mean think about when you go to\na website, and you register quote-unquote.\n\n157\n00:08:15.058 --> 00:08:16.816\nI wanna download that PDF.\n\n158\n00:08:16.816 --> 00:08:18.947\nWell great,\nlet's have you fill out this form, right?\n\n159\n00:08:18.947 --> 00:08:21.676\nBefore you do that, because we want\nsome data on you to essentially\n\n160\n00:08:21.676 --> 00:08:23.870\nbuild a marketing profile demographically.\n\n161\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.768\nSo, we're gonna ask for\nyour name, your email address,\n\n162\n00:08:26.768 --> 00:08:30.331\nmaybe your address; your physical address,\nmaybe not, it depends.\n\n163\n00:08:30.331 --> 00:08:32.250\nBut we're gonna probably ask for that.\n\n164\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.360\nWe'll ask for the country you're from,\nprobably a phone number.\n\n165\n00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.338\n&gt;&gt; They probably have my IP address\nfrom my connection that being there.\n\n166\n00:08:38.338 --> 00:08:39.591\n&gt;&gt; Your IP, right?\n\n167\n00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:41.544\nMost likely, although, the IP may or\n\n168\n00:08:41.544 --> 00:08:45.523\nmay not be an attributable property that\ncan be directly related back to you.\n\n169\n00:08:45.523 --> 00:08:47.769\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because you know IP's can be natted,\n\n170\n00:08:47.769 --> 00:08:48.821\nthey can be proxied.\n\n171\n00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:50.645\nSo they will have the IP most likely but\n\n172\n00:08:50.645 --> 00:08:53.705\nit may not be something that's\ndirectly attributable to you.\n\n173\n00:08:53.705 --> 00:08:55.692\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You could be on a public computer,\n\n174\n00:08:55.692 --> 00:08:57.120\nyou may be on a work computer.\n\n175\n00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.844\nSo it may or may not be as important but\n\n176\n00:08:58.844 --> 00:09:02.250\nwe actually talk about IP addresses\nis one of the attributable factors.\n\n177\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.748\nBecause if somebody's connecting from home\nthat IP is registered traditionally and\n\n178\n00:09:06.748 --> 00:09:08.879\nonline identifiers like IP addresses.\n\n179\n00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:12.424\nAnd I would suggest although IP addresses\nare good I'd be thinking something\n\n180\n00:09:12.424 --> 00:09:13.510\nlike cookies.\n\n181\n00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.430\nWhich would probably be a much more\nuniquely thought process buried inside of\n\n182\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.002\na machine, because we can attribute\nthat uniquely to an individual.\n\n183\n00:09:21.002 --> 00:09:23.059\nA Mac address,\nalthough they can be spoofed,\n\n184\n00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:25.752\nwould be again an attributable\ntypically to an individual,\n\n185\n00:09:25.752 --> 00:09:28.640\nalthough they are very hard to trace and\ncross reference.\n\n186\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.385\nCookies probably uniquely identifiable and\nmuch easier to figure out.\n\n187\n00:09:32.385 --> 00:09:35.283\nIP addresses, again, questionable but\n\n188\n00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:39.522\nthey're on the list of online\nidentifiers defined as such.\n\n189\n00:09:39.522 --> 00:09:43.451\nThese are all considered personal data if\nthey are capable of being linked back to\n\n190\n00:09:43.451 --> 00:09:46.626\nthe data subject, the data subject\nis the individual, you or I,\n\n191\n00:09:46.626 --> 00:09:49.390\nin this conversation\nthat we're talking about.\n\n192\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:54.298\nAny kind of location data, so, geographic\ndata from the location service on\n\n193\n00:09:54.298 --> 00:09:58.237\na cellphone for instance,\nGPS data, things of that nature.\n\n194\n00:09:58.237 --> 00:10:00.810\nMike sitting at coordinates one,\ntwo, three,\n\n195\n00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.851\nfour, that kinda thing, anything\nthat's physically able to locate you.\n\n196\n00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:08.811\nSo if there's background information\nthat may point to where you are,\n\n197\n00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:11.260\nlet's say in a shot or\nsomething like that.\n\n198\n00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.337\nThings like physical,\nphysiological, genetic.\n\n199\n00:10:15.337 --> 00:10:19.784\nVery important to think about biometric\nidentifiers that are now classified in\n\n200\n00:10:19.784 --> 00:10:24.510\nthe GDPR as being personal data unique to\nyou, because they uniquely identify you.\n\n201\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.212\nIt was not the case up until now.\n\n202\n00:10:26.212 --> 00:10:30.828\nMental and/or economical, cultural,\nor social identity factors of that\n\n203\n00:10:30.828 --> 00:10:35.299\nperson are now considered to be all\ncategorically part of this category or\n\n204\n00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:37.700\nthis identifier of personal data.\n\n205\n00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:43.613\nAnd as a result, are subject to management\nunder the guidance provided by the GDPR.\n\n206\n00:10:43.613 --> 00:10:47.270\nClassified as being uniquely\nattributable to a data subject.\n\n207\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.980\nWhich is interesting because, again,\na lot of that stuff, I mean, up until now,\n\n208\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.743\nwe've thought about it, said yeah, in\ntheory my biometric data, my retina scan,\n\n209\n00:10:54.743 --> 00:10:58.618\nmy fingerprints, trying the traditional\nthought process around that kind of stuff.\n\n210\n00:10:58.618 --> 00:11:01.704\nYeah, I know they're mine,\nthey're uniquely attributable to me, but\n\n211\n00:11:01.704 --> 00:11:04.241\nI never really thought that because\nI gave them to company X or\n\n212\n00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:06.460\nY that I'd have some sort\nof way of protecting them.\n\n213\n00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.486\nI just know they have them on file, right?\n\n214\n00:11:08.486 --> 00:11:13.253\nFor instance, many of the vend IDs that\nI carry, companies that I work for or\n\n215\n00:11:13.253 --> 00:11:18.491\nhave relationships with, or if you're\ndepending on what they are, smart cards.\n\n216\n00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:20.947\nWe've talked about this in many\nof our episodes on security.\n\n217\n00:11:20.947 --> 00:11:23.995\nThe chips in those smart cards\nshare all sorts of information.\n\n218\n00:11:23.995 --> 00:11:27.777\nCertificates are primarily the main\nthing that are stored there.\n\n219\n00:11:27.777 --> 00:11:31.355\nPasswords certainly, can be stored there,\nthere are pins can be stored there.\n\n220\n00:11:31.355 --> 00:11:35.596\nAny and all these things are potentially\nuniquely attributable to an individual\n\n221\n00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:39.959\nwhich is why we use them as an electronic\nmarkers and identifiers for multi factor,\n\n222\n00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:42.667\nsingle-dual or\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n223\n00:11:42.667 --> 00:11:46.868\nAnd they are all classified and can now\nbe attributable to an individual and\n\n224\n00:11:46.868 --> 00:11:49.768\nprotect it or\ncategorized as personal data.\n\n225\n00:11:49.768 --> 00:11:53.782\nSo see what's interesting to think\nabout this stuff because any and\n\n226\n00:11:53.782 --> 00:11:56.113\nall this things have to be considered.\n\n227\n00:11:56.113 --> 00:12:01.016\nWe don't really see a distinction between\npersonal data about individuals as being\n\n228\n00:12:01.016 --> 00:12:02.466\nin their private lives so\n\n229\n00:12:02.466 --> 00:12:07.290\nto speak versus their public or work\nroles as being distinguishable anymore.\n\n230\n00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:12.212\nA person's a person, data is data,\nwhether it is the fact that you like pizza\n\n231\n00:12:12.212 --> 00:12:15.566\nas your favorite food or\nyou have this fingerprint.\n\n232\n00:12:15.566 --> 00:12:18.781\nAll that is part of what we would\nclassify in the GDP as personal data.\n\n233\n00:12:18.781 --> 00:12:22.563\nThere is no distinction between you as\na personal person and you as a work or\n\n234\n00:12:22.563 --> 00:12:23.850\npublic person.\n\n235\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.828\nYour persona, in other words,\nis all of that together under the GDPR.\n\n236\n00:12:27.828 --> 00:12:31.264\nAnything uniquely identifying you\nis classified as personal data.\n\n237\n00:12:31.264 --> 00:12:33.509\nAnd that personal data\nis afforded protection.\n\n238\n00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:36.306\nThat's a very different approach\nthan what we've seen up until now.\n\n239\n00:12:36.306 --> 00:12:40.166\nWhere we've had selectively categorized\npersonal data elements that have been\n\n240\n00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:42.151\ncalled out and uniquely identified, but\n\n241\n00:12:42.151 --> 00:12:44.990\nwe haven't really seen\na wide necked cast this way.\n\n242\n00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.803\nSo it's one of the biggest changes,\nwhich is really,\n\n243\n00:12:47.803 --> 00:12:50.741\nfrom the perspective of being\na security professional,\n\n244\n00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:54.803\nan IT professional with a security focus,\nsomebody who works in those areas.\n\n245\n00:12:54.803 --> 00:12:58.152\nMany of you that are listening to us\nwill probably fall into this category.\n\n246\n00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:02.592\nIt's an eye opener for us but it's also an\nincredibly important change in the mindset\n\n247\n00:13:02.592 --> 00:13:04.900\nand the thought process of this.\n\n248\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.971\nBecause this really does allow us\nto claim the rights of our data and\n\n249\n00:13:08.971 --> 00:13:13.915\nour protection rights that are associated\nwith it as an individual in a way that up\n\n250\n00:13:13.915 --> 00:13:17.715\nuntil now we just unfortunately\nhave not had framework to do.\n\n251\n00:13:17.715 --> 00:13:21.330\nWe give out so much of our\ninformation as we've talked about.\n\n252\n00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.548\nUnfortunately really without\na second thought of what it means or\n\n253\n00:13:24.548 --> 00:13:25.724\nwho's going to see it.\n\n254\n00:13:25.724 --> 00:13:30.119\nAnd now we have to not only stop and think\nabout how we're gonna protect it when we\n\n255\n00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:34.500\ngather that data as the entity that is\nregistering or collecting the data.\n\n256\n00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.346\nBut as an individual were really,\nhopefully if we're paying attention,\n\n257\n00:13:38.346 --> 00:13:39.505\nbeing asked to stop and\n\n258\n00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:43.056\nreally consider what level of\nprotection our data will be afforded.\n\n259\n00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:46.650\nAnd as a result, hopefully, what level\nof protection we will enjoy, right?\n\n260\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:47.496\nAs a result.\n\n261\n00:13:47.496 --> 00:13:49.336\nSo there's no distinction there,\nimportant to know.\n\n262\n00:13:49.336 --> 00:13:50.970\nWhat about controllers and processors?\n\n263\n00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.000\nSo I've mentioned these terms as well,\nand said we would define them.\n\n264\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.283\nAnd I said controllers control, right?\n\n265\n00:13:57.283 --> 00:13:57.995\nHaters hate, right?\n\n266\n00:13:57.995 --> 00:13:59.522\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Controllers control,\n\n267\n00:13:59.522 --> 00:14:00.591\nprocessors process.\n\n268\n00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:02.375\nThat's the easy way of thinking about it,\nbut\n\n269\n00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:04.340\nthere is a little bit more subtlety to it,\nright?\n\n270\n00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.652\nWe do separate under the regulations,\nunder the GDPR, responsibilities and\n\n271\n00:14:08.652 --> 00:14:12.389\nthe duties associated with data\ncontrollers and data processors.\n\n272\n00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:13.662\nSo, let's think about this, right?\n\n273\n00:14:13.662 --> 00:14:16.784\nIf we had to guess or\nwork through it between two of these,\n\n274\n00:14:16.784 --> 00:14:19.550\nwhat controllers versus processors do?\n\n275\n00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.786\nAnd again on the surface it\nsounds very straight forward, and\n\n276\n00:14:21.786 --> 00:14:23.036\nit's really not a lot of mystery.\n\n277\n00:14:23.036 --> 00:14:26.890\nBut what do controllers traditionally\nhave as responsibilities or roles?\n\n278\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.389\n&gt;&gt; Seems like a controller\nwould be in charge or\n\n279\n00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:31.420\nin control of the overall process.\n\n280\n00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.282\n&gt;&gt; Did I mention the rule?\n\n281\n00:14:32.282 --> 00:14:33.119\nI forgot to mention the rule.\n\n282\n00:14:33.119 --> 00:14:33.678\n&gt;&gt; The rule?\n\n283\n00:14:33.678 --> 00:14:36.615\n&gt;&gt; The rule, yeah, very simple rule\nwhen we play identify the term.\n\n284\n00:14:36.615 --> 00:14:37.922\nYou can't use the term.\n\n285\n00:14:37.922 --> 00:14:39.794\n&gt;&gt; Shoot.\n&gt;&gt; To identify the term, right?\n\n286\n00:14:39.794 --> 00:14:42.170\nBecause if you, well, controllers control,\nlike I said it's nothing, but\n\n287\n00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.750\nwe've got to be a little\nbit more than that.\n\n288\n00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.911\nSo controllers do control,\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n289\n00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:47.955\nBut let's think about this from\na slightly different perspective.\n\n290\n00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:50.757\nCuz it's hard to use the term\nto define the term and\n\n291\n00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:53.310\nthen claim that we've actually defined it.\n\n292\n00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.890\nWe've just repeated ourselves.\n\n293\n00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.632\nSo controllers do control, but\n\n294\n00:14:56.632 --> 00:15:00.290\nwhat that really means is that\nthe controller role, right?\n\n295\n00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.773\nIs going to be overseeing,\n\n296\n00:15:01.773 --> 00:15:04.744\nprobably a better way of\nthinking about the same idea.\n\n297\n00:15:04.744 --> 00:15:10.447\nOverseeing or managing the thought process\nand guiding the thought process and\n\n298\n00:15:10.447 --> 00:15:16.163\nthe actions of the processor, the role\nthat essentially sits lateral to them.\n\n299\n00:15:16.163 --> 00:15:19.438\n&gt;&gt; And then as the controller\nthen at that high level,\n\n300\n00:15:19.438 --> 00:15:24.631\nis that where the responsibility comes\nback to in the end, where the buck stops?\n\n301\n00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:25.898\n&gt;&gt; So, great question.\n\n302\n00:15:25.898 --> 00:15:29.410\nSo the buck stops at both levels, right?\n\n303\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.668\nBecause the controller oversees,\nobligating,\n\n304\n00:15:32.668 --> 00:15:37.487\nwe think about obligating the controllers\nto engage in those processes.\n\n305\n00:15:37.487 --> 00:15:41.368\nThe language here that provide sufficient\nguarantees to implement appropriate\n\n306\n00:15:41.368 --> 00:15:43.428\ntechnical and organizational measures.\n\n307\n00:15:43.428 --> 00:15:45.915\nI'm quoting, actually, from the GDPR.\n\n308\n00:15:45.915 --> 00:15:46.949\nLet me say that one more time.\n\n309\n00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:50.376\nThat process, yeah, so [LAUGH] get me to\nthe right point where I have that quote.\n\n310\n00:15:50.376 --> 00:15:52.639\nSo specifically the language, right?\n\n311\n00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:56.016\nWe obligate controllers to\nengage only those processors.\n\n312\n00:15:56.016 --> 00:16:00.685\nThat provide quote, sufficient guarantees\nto implement appropriate technical and\n\n313\n00:16:00.685 --> 00:16:04.120\norganizational measures to meet\nthe regulations, the GDPR,\n\n314\n00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.798\nrequirements to protect\ndata subjects rights.\n\n315\n00:16:06.798 --> 00:16:11.583\nSo, controllers are obligated\nto figure out how to\n\n316\n00:16:11.583 --> 00:16:16.270\nwork inside the system and\nwork with processors.\n\n317\n00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:20.360\nProcessors traditionally are the companies\nor the entities that are managing\n\n318\n00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.630\nthe data, day to day, moment to moment,\nengaging in the use of it.\n\n319\n00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.150\nWe would say it's more a company\nthan an individual because companies\n\n320\n00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.780\nare collecting data, they're maintaining\nit in an e-commerce kind of setting.\n\n321\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.890\nBut it's the entity,\nwhatever that is, right,\n\n322\n00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.170\nthat's managing the data day to day,\nmoment to moment.\n\n323\n00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:39.250\nSo as a controller,\nour obligation is to only engage with and\n\n324\n00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:44.051\nonly allow those entities that\nunderstand how to do this the right way.\n\n325\n00:16:44.051 --> 00:16:46.798\nGuaranteeing that they will implement and\nassign and\n\n326\n00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:51.500\nengage around appropriate technical and\norganizational measures, i.e., policies,\n\n327\n00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.383\nprocedures, and\nprocesses to meet the requirements.\n\n328\n00:16:54.383 --> 00:16:58.740\nSo the controller has\nto bear responsibility.\n\n329\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.520\nBut if the processor screws up,\nthere's fines and\n\n330\n00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.570\nlegality issues associated with that as\nwell, so it's actually at both levels.\n\n331\n00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we do have the oversight\n\n332\n00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.830\nessentially at the controller level,\nwe're talking about due care,\n\n333\n00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.030\nwe want to think about the terms\nwe always come back to right?\n\n334\n00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.790\nDue care, and due diligence.\n\n335\n00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.860\nSo, due care is how we act,\ndue diligence is oversight.\n\n336\n00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.980\nRight, and\nwe often think about it that way.\n\n337\n00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.450\nThe processors, the actors, the people\nthat are the entities that are actually\n\n338\n00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.950\nengaging, we have to focus\nthem on due care, right?\n\n339\n00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.140\nThe controllers have to be\nfocused on due diligence.\n\n340\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.660\nThe oversight and the responsibility\naround engaging with those entities or\n\n341\n00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.930\nacting with due care.\n\n342\n00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.710\nSo verification, validation, auditing,\nknowing what they're doing and\n\n343\n00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.110\nhow they're doing it, that's really\nin the wheelhouse of the controllers.\n\n344\n00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:50.114\nWhereas the processors, the actual front\nline entities that are gathering data,\n\n345\n00:17:50.114 --> 00:17:53.117\nare interacting with let's say,\nindividuals,\n\n346\n00:17:53.117 --> 00:17:56.492\nare making sure they have\nopt-in from the individual.\n\n347\n00:17:56.492 --> 00:18:00.483\nOr making sure they adhere to collection\nresponsibilities and rights statements\n\n348\n00:18:00.483 --> 00:18:03.624\nthat they're safeguarding data\nthrough storing it properly.\n\n349\n00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:05.406\nAll things we've talked about or\n\n350\n00:18:05.406 --> 00:18:09.400\nwill talk about, they are going to\nhave to act with due care, right.\n\n351\n00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.200\nAnd we have to then oversee that to ensure\nthat that's happening the right way.\n\n352\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.970\nSo we have to make sure that\nwe are thinking about this.\n\n353\n00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.770\nAlso controllers and processors\nare required to again, quoting here.\n\n354\n00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.900\nI'll do this when I'm quoting,\nmaybe Mike can do that while I'm quoting.\n\n355\n00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:23.670\nMike can hold his hand.\n\n356\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:24.570\nThere we go, all right.\n\n357\n00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.010\nAir quote, triple air quote.\n\n358\n00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:26.970\nEven more impressive.\n\n359\n00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.100\nRight, so implement appropriate\ntechnical and organizational measures.\n\n360\n00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.066\nWe talk about this.\n\n361\n00:18:31.066 --> 00:18:36.190\nTake into account the state of the art and\nthe cost of implementation, and\n\n362\n00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:41.300\nthe nature, scope, context, and\npurposes of the processing, right?\n\n363\n00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.330\nAs well as the risk of varying likelihood\nand severity of the rights and\n\n364\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.490\nfreedoms of the individuals.\n\n365\n00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:52.220\nWhich essentially means I don't know what,\nI lost myself back a little ways.\n\n366\n00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.650\nBut what it really means, right,\nall kidding aside, what it means is that,\n\n367\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.870\nagain to my point and to your question,\nit's a great question, that both\n\n368\n00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:05.220\ncontrollers and processors are required\nto have different vantage points on this.\n\n369\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.940\nBut ultimately are both required as\nentities, to find his roles to play\n\n370\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.290\na part in applying these safeguards and\nprotections, interpreting them, and\n\n371\n00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.550\nensuring data security and\nsafety of the individual's information.\n\n372\n00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.450\nIt's not, in other words,\na simple question and a simple answer,\n\n373\n00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:25.000\nwhere we say responsibility lives only\nhere, and action lives only here.\n\n374\n00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.210\nResponsibility in action\nlived in both roles and\n\n375\n00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:32.180\nare defined as being a part of both roles\nfrom the ground up, which is good to hear,\n\n376\n00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.620\nbecause it now means that we\nhave a great oversight, right?\n\n377\n00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:40.460\nDue diligence function that has to act\nin the capacity of keeping us honest.\n\n378\n00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.490\nAnd we have a due care function that we\nhave to make sure we are paying attention\n\n379\n00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.705\nto, that we act responsibly and those two\nshould mutually reinforce one another.\n\n380\n00:19:48.705 --> 00:19:51.330\nBoth controllers and processors,\nso, it is nice, right?\n\n381\n00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.591\nAnd we do have specific guidance as to\nwhat kind of security actions would be\n\n382\n00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:57.090\nconsidered, as I mentioned,\nappropriate to the risk.\n\n383\n00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.488\nFor instance, you think I've used\nsome crazy language up until now,\n\n384\n00:20:00.488 --> 00:20:02.051\nBuckle your seat belt, right.\n\n385\n00:20:02.051 --> 00:20:03.025\n&gt;&gt; Here we go.\n\n386\n00:20:03.025 --> 00:20:05.732\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, and\nif you can spell this one by the way and\n\n387\n00:20:05.732 --> 00:20:06.755\nspell it correctly.\n\n388\n00:20:06.755 --> 00:20:09.755\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; The European version of this,\n\n389\n00:20:09.755 --> 00:20:11.925\nI will be very impressed.\n\n390\n00:20:11.925 --> 00:20:12.697\nYou cannot look at my notes.\n\n391\n00:20:12.697 --> 00:20:13.531\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n392\n00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:14.746\n&gt;&gt; In order to spell this stuff,\nall right.\n\n393\n00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:18.560\nSo the pseudo,\n[LAUGH] the pseudonymization.\n\n394\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.825\nThe pseudonymization, right?\n\n395\n00:20:20.825 --> 00:20:24.530\nAnd/or encryption of personal\ndata is one of the key actions or\n\n396\n00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.790\nelements that's considered appropriate and\nat an appropriate level\n\n397\n00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.780\nto deal with the risks associated\nwith gathering of personal data.\n\n398\n00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.340\nPseudonymization.\n\n399\n00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.315\n&gt;&gt; All right, here we go.\nAre you ready?\n\n400\n00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:34.145\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n401\n00:20:34.145 --> 00:20:35.700\n&gt;&gt; P-S-, this is how I spelled it.\n\n402\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.963\nAnd it's all ready red\nunderlined in my notes, so.\n\n403\n00:20:37.963 --> 00:20:38.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n404\n00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.367\n&gt;&gt; Right, P-S-E-U-D-O-N-O.\n\n405\n00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:43.492\nNow, you're all ready done.\n\n406\n00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:44.274\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n407\n00:20:44.274 --> 00:20:45.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's as far as I made it.\n\n408\n00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.525\n&gt;&gt; So you got pseudo, right.\n\n409\n00:20:46.525 --> 00:20:50.048\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\nThen nymization is n-y-m-i-s because\n\n410\n00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:55.216\nremember it's coming from the EU so\nremember all the Zs that we would\n\n411\n00:20:55.216 --> 00:20:59.943\nthink as Americans are essentially\nS's over there, right.\n\n412\n00:20:59.943 --> 00:21:00.794\nAll right so.\n\n413\n00:21:00.794 --> 00:21:03.133\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A pseudonymization and/or encryption\n\n414\n00:21:03.133 --> 00:21:03.990\nof personal data.\n\n415\n00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:08.658\nYou've heard me and Mike and anybody else\non ITPro.TV as a presenter, as a host,\n\n416\n00:21:08.658 --> 00:21:13.270\njust as me, whoever talks about security\nunder any circumstance you will often in\n\n417\n00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.940\nthat conversation hear us say encryption,\nencryption, encryption, right?\n\n418\n00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.490\nNumber one control or countermeasure\nassociated with confidentiality,\n\n419\n00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.540\nthe protection of data forever.\n\n420\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.700\nIt's always been a problem and\nwill always ever be.\n\n421\n00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.570\nThe use of encryption.\n\n422\n00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.710\nSo that's right there at the top, right?\n\n423\n00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.263\nBut it's just fun to say pseudonymization.\n\n424\n00:21:29.263 --> 00:21:29.811\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I like that.\n\n425\n00:21:29.811 --> 00:21:30.710\n&gt;&gt; And to spell it correctly.\n\n426\n00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.105\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What about the ability to ensure\n\n427\n00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:36.530\nthe ongoing confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability of data.\n\n428\n00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.720\nThose are the traditional three pillars,\nright?\n\n429\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.790\nThe iron triangle that\nwe often talk about.\n\n430\n00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.010\nThree pillars of information security.\n\n431\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.120\nThe C, I, and A,\nlet me do the triangle again, right?\n\n432\n00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.580\nYou want it do, wanna point?\n\n433\n00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.180\n&gt;&gt; So we got confidentiality.\n\n434\n00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:49.720\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n435\n00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.220\n&gt;&gt; Integrity.\n\n436\n00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.440\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And availability.\n\n437\n00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.130\n&gt;&gt; There we go right there.\n\n438\n00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:56.050\nSo and if you're not good turn it\naround backwards right there, and\n\n439\n00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.775\nit is essentially the same\njust the other way around.\n\n440\n00:21:58.775 --> 00:21:59.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n441\n00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.410\nyou can see my bald spot on the back,\ntoo, when I do that.\n\n442\n00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.060\nAll right, so CIA, right?\n\n443\n00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.917\nSo confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n444\n00:22:04.917 --> 00:22:06.690\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nWe've heard those, talked about those.\n\n445\n00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.082\nThose are not new, right?\n\n446\n00:22:08.082 --> 00:22:08.842\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n447\n00:22:08.842 --> 00:22:12.442\nanybody who has never heard about\nthem certainly it's a new concept if\n\n448\n00:22:12.442 --> 00:22:16.360\nthis is maybe your first introduction\nto the ideas behind data protection.\n\n449\n00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.270\nThe ideas behind rights, and\ndata protection rights of an individual.\n\n450\n00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:25.387\nBut for anybody who's been doing this for\nsome time, these are rock-solid based\n\n451\n00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:30.665\nconcepts that we build all of our ISMS or\ninformation security management systems.\n\n452\n00:22:30.665 --> 00:22:35.099\nOn the idea of an enterprise security\narchitecture is foundationally based in\n\n453\n00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:39.890\nthe pillars, the confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability concepts.\n\n454\n00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.990\nSo again, this is just harkening back in\nmany respects to things that we done and\n\n455\n00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.900\ncontinue to talk about and\ndo for decades at this point.\n\n456\n00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.557\nBut enshrining them yet again, rolling\nthem forward as the baseline to then build\n\n457\n00:22:50.557 --> 00:22:53.856\nadditional protections on this really\nwhat we're thinking about here.\n\n458\n00:22:53.856 --> 00:22:58.589\nBut also we say, resiliency, availability\nessentially is into same thing, a system,\n\n459\n00:22:58.589 --> 00:23:01.205\nand services process, and personal data.\n\n460\n00:23:01.205 --> 00:23:02.716\nThere should be some\nform of acknowledgement,\n\n461\n00:23:02.716 --> 00:23:05.375\nand awareness to the fact, it's not\nenough just to say, yes, we've encrypted.\n\n462\n00:23:05.375 --> 00:23:08.694\nIt's not enough just to say,\nyes we've provided integrity,\n\n463\n00:23:08.694 --> 00:23:11.951\ndata cannot be changed, or\nmodified without the consent, or\n\n464\n00:23:11.951 --> 00:23:16.320\nknowledge of the owners, what integrity\nis to defined as confidentiality.\n\n465\n00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.160\nKeep good data away from bad people,\nright?\n\n466\n00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.980\nSo hide the data and\nin some way protect it.\n\n467\n00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.390\nSo even if somebody gets it,\n\n468\n00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.475\nthey get it in a form that they cannot\nuse it if they're not entitled to it.\n\n469\n00:23:25.475 --> 00:23:28.955\nSome confidentiality and integrity,\nbut availability is equally important.\n\n470\n00:23:28.955 --> 00:23:32.085\nPeople often forget this, right,\nin the sense that they say, yeah,\n\n471\n00:23:32.085 --> 00:23:37.015\nwe've done the idea or we've gone\nthrough the idea of applying encryption.\n\n472\n00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:40.980\nWe protected the data in motion,\nat rest, and in use, right?\n\n473\n00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.890\nThree stages that we often\nthink about data being in.\n\n474\n00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.863\nWe've provided a changed\ncontrol around data integrity.\n\n475\n00:23:45.863 --> 00:23:49.552\nBut what about somebody who denial of\nservices, the front end of the system,\n\n476\n00:23:49.552 --> 00:23:52.701\nand prevents us from getting in\nwhen we're supposed to be there.\n\n477\n00:23:52.701 --> 00:23:55.586\nWe're authorized and we have rights to\nuse and access the data and make changes.\n\n478\n00:23:55.586 --> 00:23:58.548\nWe've still essentially sunk the ship,\nright?\n\n479\n00:23:58.548 --> 00:24:01.220\nSo all three are equally important.\n\n480\n00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.060\nWhat about the ability to\nrestore the availability and\n\n481\n00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.220\naccess to data in a timely manner\nin the event of an incident?\n\n482\n00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.170\nIn other words, somehow guarantee\ncertain levels of access.\n\n483\n00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.680\nAn SLA comes to mind,\nservice level agreement.\n\n484\n00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.250\nBut we also have a concept known as a PLA,\n\n485\n00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:17.450\na privacy level agreement, which is\nbecoming more and more common today.\n\n486\n00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.660\nAnd speaks to the idea not just\nof guarantee of service, but\n\n487\n00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.190\nguarantee of privacy with regards to\nservice, so interesting approach there.\n\n488\n00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:30.050\nA process to regularly test, assess and\nor evaluate effectiveness of controls and\n\n489\n00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.720\nmeasures within the security\nprocessing context.\n\n490\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.250\nIn other words, auditability,\nverification, validation.\n\n491\n00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.100\nAnd again, we've talked about\nall these things, right?\n\n492\n00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.760\nThese are not new, and\nthese are not concepts that in any way,\n\n493\n00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.280\nshape, or form should surprise anybody who\ndoes any of this kind of work already,\n\n494\n00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.270\nor who is new to this area.\n\n495\n00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:52.020\nBut is thinking logically, what kind\nof protections would I want to see?\n\n496\n00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.560\nWhat would be important and\nhow should I achieve them?\n\n497\n00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.160\nThis is not groundbreaking,\n\n498\n00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.580\nstartlingly new interpretations\nof something that is different.\n\n499\n00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.318\nThis is just hey,\nwe've always done it this way and\n\n500\n00:25:04.318 --> 00:25:07.769\nwe will continue to specify how\nimportant it is to do it this way.\n\n501\n00:25:07.769 --> 00:25:10.026\nBut by the way, let's tweak and update and\n\n502\n00:25:10.026 --> 00:25:13.590\nfine tune to make sure that we're\ncapturing the most logical approaches.\n\n503\n00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.560\nThe most up-to-date technicality and\ntherefore the best kind of control.\n\n504\n00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.950\nSo it's an interesting approach.\n\n505\n00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.190\n&gt;&gt; And gives us the ability to enforce,\nright?\n\n506\n00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.000\nIt'd be another thing.\n\n507\n00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.503\nWe know the right thing to do,\nwe know we should be doing that, but\n\n508\n00:25:25.503 --> 00:25:28.574\nsometimes it's cheaper, quicker to maybe-\n&gt;&gt; Don't say it.\n\n509\n00:25:28.574 --> 00:25:29.156\n&gt;&gt; Shortcut.\n\n510\n00:25:29.156 --> 00:25:30.051\nStill not bad.\n\n511\n00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:30.609\n&gt;&gt; Say it's not so.\n\n512\n00:25:30.609 --> 00:25:31.466\nSay it's not so.\n\n513\n00:25:31.466 --> 00:25:35.210\nWe are focused on money instead\nof the rights of the individual.\n\n514\n00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.810\nFor shame Mike, for shame.\n\n515\n00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:37.605\n&gt;&gt; Who would have thought.\n\n516\n00:25:37.605 --> 00:25:38.877\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is just absolutely,\n\n517\n00:25:38.877 --> 00:25:40.054\nwell absolutely correct.\n\n518\n00:25:40.054 --> 00:25:41.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, right?\n\n519\n00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.140\nAll right, but that leaves the gate.\n\n520\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.570\nSo we make jokes about some of this stuff.\n\n521\n00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.960\nBut it is actually the case,\nas unfortunate as it traditionally is.\n\n522\n00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.210\nNot that every company is that way cause\nmany companies don't act that way.\n\n523\n00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.150\nWe wanna be fair and\nwe wanna be even-handed.\n\n524\n00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.920\nBut at the same time we do know and\nsee ample evidence of the fact\n\n525\n00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.620\nthat companies unfortunately,\nat certain points in times,\n\n526\n00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.930\nmay make decisions based on\nother mitigating factors,\n\n527\n00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.520\nrather than just simply the rights and\nprotections of the individual.\n\n528\n00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.488\nWhatever those mitigating or\nother factors may be, money or\n\n529\n00:26:10.488 --> 00:26:13.409\nany other factor, and\nit's hard to say what they would be.\n\n530\n00:26:13.409 --> 00:26:16.817\nBut they don't always, unfortunately,\nalign with the rights of the individual,\n\n531\n00:26:16.817 --> 00:26:17.780\nlet's put it that way.\n\n532\n00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.500\nAs a general overview statement,\ngeneral rule,\n\n533\n00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.240\nwithout specifying any one entity and\nor any one reason,\n\n534\n00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.600\nbecause it'll be unfair to identify\nany one company that way, necessarily.\n\n535\n00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.330\nBut controllers and\n\n536\n00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:32.990\nprocessors must adhere to an approved\ncode of conduct as part of this.\n\n537\n00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:38.000\nAnd an approved certification may\nbe used to demonstrate compliance.\n\n538\n00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.525\nSo for instance,\nwe may have certain certifications or\n\n539\n00:26:41.525 --> 00:26:45.500\ncodes of conduct in certain verticals or\nsilos industries that\n\n540\n00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:50.235\ncan be put forward and used to validate\nthat we are adhering to these rules.\n\n541\n00:26:50.235 --> 00:26:52.860\nWhich is, again, pretty standard today.\n\n542\n00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.930\nThis may be something as easy\n\n543\n00:26:55.930 --> 00:27:01.170\nto understand as perhaps\na design specification.\n\n544\n00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:06.680\nFor instance, the design specifications\nto build our data centers and\n\n545\n00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.740\nto validate their operation.\n\n546\n00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:13.950\nASHRAE, which is a group that's based in\nthe US but is known internationally for\n\n547\n00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:18.005\ntheir ability to put\nout standards to create\n\n548\n00:27:18.005 --> 00:27:22.765\nthe thought process on how to manage\nthe temperature conditions and\n\n549\n00:27:22.765 --> 00:27:25.815\nthe standardization of\na data center architecture.\n\n550\n00:27:25.815 --> 00:27:30.360\nAs well as the tiering,\nthe four-tier logical\n\n551\n00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.040\narchitecture levels we have when\nwe build out data centers, right?\n\n552\n00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.216\nAnd all that stuff comes from\ninternationally recognized bodies that lay\n\n553\n00:27:37.216 --> 00:27:38.312\nthese things out.\n\n554\n00:27:38.312 --> 00:27:41.145\nThe IEEE that is responsible worldwide for\n\n555\n00:27:41.145 --> 00:27:47.055\nmost if not all of the standardization of\nnetworking, capabilities and rules, right?\n\n556\n00:27:47.055 --> 00:27:51.054\nThe 802.3 working group for Ethernet,\nalthough we don't often see it anymore and\n\n557\n00:27:51.054 --> 00:27:54.550\ntalk about it, [LAUGH] 802.5 for\ntoken ring, things like that.\n\n558\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.480\nISO, right?\n\n559\n00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.280\nFor instance,\nin the adherence to ISO standards,\n\n560\n00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.520\nwith regards to information security.\n\n561\n00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:05.130\nISO 27001, and 27002,\nfor instance, the ISMS,\n\n562\n00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.230\nthe Information Security Management System\nstandards.\n\n563\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:12.390\nThe actual breakdown of the logic\nof the architecture and then 2702,\n\n564\n00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:15.460\nthe control factors and\ncounter measures associated with that.\n\n565\n00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.680\nAny and all of these things,\nif they're internationally recognized and\n\n566\n00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.580\naccessible and\nare applicable in this particular case\n\n567\n00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.860\ncan be put forward as\napproved codes of conduct.\n\n568\n00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.100\nOr prove certifications that\nan entity can adhere to,\n\n569\n00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.150\nif they can show alignment with them,\nso that we can demonstrate compliance.\n\n570\n00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.884\nSo we're not saying anything new,\nwe want auditability,\n\n571\n00:28:33.884 --> 00:28:35.476\nwe want auditability standards.\n\n572\n00:28:35.476 --> 00:28:40.483\nSo the old SAS 70,\nthe more modern thought process that we're\n\n573\n00:28:40.483 --> 00:28:46.060\nnow using to update that the ISAE\nstandards that replace that, right?\n\n574\n00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:51.360\nSo the idea of the SOC level, SOC 1,\nSOC 2, SOC 3, and just the auditability\n\n575\n00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.030\naround information security management in\nand financial reporting controls around\n\n576\n00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:00.450\nthat management in,\nlet's say some sort of a web environment.\n\n577\n00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.127\nThose kinds of standards that\nare internationally recognized and\n\n578\n00:29:03.127 --> 00:29:05.144\nauditable can still be\nused to prove compliance.\n\n579\n00:29:05.144 --> 00:29:08.215\nIt's just that we're enshrining\nthe idea of using them specifically for\n\n580\n00:29:08.215 --> 00:29:10.130\nour controllers and processors here.\n\n581\n00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.680\nSo we do also have to have\ndocumentation of the relationship\n\n582\n00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.030\nbetween controllers and processors,\nthis is also very important.\n\n583\n00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.920\nWe have to have not only\ndocumentation of it, but\n\n584\n00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.560\nwe have to have contracts that\nmandate privacy obligations.\n\n585\n00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.160\nI mentioned this idea of the PLA\njust a couple of minutes ago.\n\n586\n00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.170\nThe Privacy Level Agreement, that's\nlateral to and sits essentially aligned\n\n587\n00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:33.535\nwith the SLA, which most of you\nare probably much more familiar with,\n\n588\n00:29:33.535 --> 00:29:35.320\nthe Service Level Agreement.\n\n589\n00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.664\nBut the idea of PLA has really gained\ntraction the last several years,\n\n590\n00:29:38.664 --> 00:29:41.963\nespecially with regards to cloud\nservices and cloud provisioning.\n\n591\n00:29:41.963 --> 00:29:44.596\nAnd the idea of creating\na lateral document,\n\n592\n00:29:44.596 --> 00:29:49.727\na lateral contractual obligation between\nprovider and customer, that stipulates and\n\n593\n00:29:49.727 --> 00:29:53.955\nlays out the rights associated for\nprivacy with regards to management,\n\n594\n00:29:53.955 --> 00:29:58.910\ngathering, maintenance of and use of\ncustomer data is what a PLA provides for.\n\n595\n00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:03.710\nAnd so articles and artifacts like\nthat have to be mandated here for\n\n596\n00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.100\nprivacy obligations.\n\n597\n00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.240\nBut controllers ultimately\nare on the hook,\n\n598\n00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.600\nback to your point, to assure themselves\nof the processor's privacy capabilities.\n\n599\n00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:16.170\nIn other words, it's the controller's\nobligation in the relationship\n\n600\n00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:20.160\nto figure out how to hold the processor\naccountable to a standard and\n\n601\n00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.600\nensure that the processor\nis following that standard.\n\n602\n00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:29.691\nIf they're not able to do that, then the\nburden and the liability sits squarely,\n\n603\n00:30:29.691 --> 00:30:34.825\naccording to the GDPR,\nsits squarely with the controller, right?\n\n604\n00:30:34.825 --> 00:30:36.461\nThe processor could screw it up and\n\n605\n00:30:36.461 --> 00:30:40.310\nact in an illegal, inappropriate fashion,\nand we'll hold them accountable.\n\n606\n00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.490\nWe'll find them,\nwe'll slap them on the wrist.\n\n607\n00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.050\nBut it's the controller that\nbears ultimate responsibility in\n\n608\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:45.950\nthe relationship.\n\n609\n00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:50.890\nTo understand that that liability exists,\nto document, manage and validate that and\n\n610\n00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.320\ncontrol that liability.\n\n611\n00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.960\nAnd if it gets out of hand,\nto then take action.\n\n612\n00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.790\nSo it's the controller who bears\nresponsibility there in order to\n\n613\n00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:58.480\nassess that.\n\n614\n00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.230\nSo just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n615\n00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.070\nI know we're almost out of time in this\nepisode, but on the heels of this,\n\n616\n00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.810\nI mentioned fines in the last one.\n\n617\n00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.730\nJust wanted to, since we're kinda talking\nabout responsibility and liability,\n\n618\n00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.800\nthought it would be good to quickly talk\nabout the fines and enforcement piece.\n\n619\n00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.251\nSo we can see what some of\nthose clubs essentially,\n\n620\n00:31:13.251 --> 00:31:15.330\nbecause they're over our heads, right?\n\n621\n00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.160\nSo I talk about fines and enforcement.\n\n622\n00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.000\nRegulators I mentioned do have\nan ability here to levy fines,\n\n623\n00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.940\npretty significant one.\n\n624\n00:31:22.975 --> 00:31:24.660\nThey're given legal authority, under GDPR,\n\n625\n00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:29.200\nto issue penalties equal to\nthe greater of euro 10 million.\n\n626\n00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.350\nSo I mention,\nthis is a significant liability.\n\n627\n00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.318\n10 million euros, which,\ndepending on the exchange rate,\n\n628\n00:31:34.318 --> 00:31:36.566\ncan significantly be be\na fair amount of money.\n\n629\n00:31:36.566 --> 00:31:41.363\nOr 2%, 2%, of the entity's global gross\nrevenue for violations under GDPR, for\n\n630\n00:31:41.363 --> 00:31:44.976\nthings like record keeping,\nsecurity, breach notification,\n\n631\n00:31:44.976 --> 00:31:46.375\nwe'll talk about that.\n\n632\n00:31:46.375 --> 00:31:50.357\nReally big deal if you have a breach and\ndon't notify in a timely manner,\n\n633\n00:31:50.357 --> 00:31:55.125\nbe an upcoming conversation, then you're\ngonna rack up some significant fines, and\n\n634\n00:31:55.125 --> 00:31:57.435\nprivacy impact assessment obligation.\n\n635\n00:31:57.435 --> 00:32:01.830\nSo any and all of these areas\n2% of global gross revenue or\n\n636\n00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:05.630\neuro 10 million, the greater of the two.\n\n637\n00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.840\nAnd for a large company,\nlet me underline and\n\n638\n00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.090\nunderscore that, not the equal,\nless than, but greater than of the two.\n\n639\n00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:16.200\nWhich means yeah, 10 million euro that's a\nlot of money, but for a big company 2% of\n\n640\n00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.410\ngross revenue globally is gonna be\na lot more than 10 million euro, right.\n\n641\n00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.593\nFor a small company clearly 10 million\nmay break the bank and that's it.\n\n642\n00:32:23.593 --> 00:32:27.169\nBut for the Googles, the Microsofts,\nthe Amazons of the world,\n\n643\n00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:31.719\n2% of the entity's gross global revenue is\ngonna have a lot more zeros attached to\n\n644\n00:32:31.719 --> 00:32:34.987\nthat potentially than 10 million,\nso that's an issue.\n\n645\n00:32:34.987 --> 00:32:37.271\n&gt;&gt; I mean companies like\nthat they can write a,\n\n646\n00:32:37.271 --> 00:32:39.495\nnot that they wouldn't miss that money but\n\n647\n00:32:39.495 --> 00:32:43.970\nit's not nearly the same impact when you\nfine somebody like that 10 million euros.\n\n648\n00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:47.750\nSo it's good to see that they are thinking\nabout that when they levy these fines and\n\n649\n00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:51.130\nthey're like we're gonna make it so\nthat you don't go you know what,\n\n650\n00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:54.150\nI know we might get fined but\nit's worth it almost.\n\n651\n00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.330\nCuz we see organizations do that now and\nagain.\n\n652\n00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.980\n&gt;&gt; We do.\nSo\n\n653\n00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.650\nthat's level one,\nthat's essentially the first layer.\n\n654\n00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:04.190\nBut violations of obligations related to\nlegal justifications around processing,\n\n655\n00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:09.030\nso things like did you get consent from\nthe data owner before you took their data.\n\n656\n00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:12.210\nSo if you go and\ngather data under false pretenses,\n\n657\n00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.710\nunder the GDPR, without opting,\nwithout consent of the owner,\n\n658\n00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.370\nyou're subject to a different\nkind of fine, right.\n\n659\n00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.520\nData subject rights,\n\n660\n00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.450\nyou violate my rights as a data subject,\nyou gather my data without my permission,\n\n661\n00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.390\nyou use it in an inappropriate way\nthat I did not give you rights to.\n\n662\n00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.700\nOr you expose it through\nessentially unjustifiable behavior,\n\n663\n00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.925\nyou purposefully act in a way\nthat leads to data breach.\n\n664\n00:33:34.925 --> 00:33:38.920\nAnd/or cross border data transfers,\n\n665\n00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.320\nyou send this data into an unprotected\narea knowing you will expose it.\n\n666\n00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.825\nAny of these actions or activities may\nresult in penalties of the greater, again\n\n667\n00:33:47.825 --> 00:33:52.620\ngreater, of the following euro 20 million\nor 4% of the entity's gross revenue.\n\n668\n00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.270\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n669\n00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.865\n&gt;&gt; So double the penalty phase\nessentially in phase one.\n\n670\n00:33:56.865 --> 00:34:00.551\nAct inappropriately we're gonna slap\nyou on the wrist, purposefully,\n\n671\n00:34:00.551 --> 00:34:04.237\nknowingly act in a way that exposes\ndata to confidentiality breach we're\n\n672\n00:34:04.237 --> 00:34:05.612\ngonna double those fines.\n\n673\n00:34:05.612 --> 00:34:06.146\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n674\n00:34:06.146 --> 00:34:09.885\n&gt;&gt; So 4% of the gross revenue,\nthat's a significant amount of money.\n\n675\n00:34:09.885 --> 00:34:11.266\n&gt;&gt; That's huge, right, absolutely.\n\n676\n00:34:11.266 --> 00:34:13.376\n&gt;&gt; That is a significant amount of money,\nI'd like to get that check.\n\n677\n00:34:13.376 --> 00:34:15.303\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH].\n\n678\n00:34:15.303 --> 00:34:18.356\n&gt;&gt; You and I could retire,\nwe would not have to come hang out and\n\n679\n00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:19.343\ntalk about stuff.\n\n680\n00:34:19.343 --> 00:34:22.823\n&gt;&gt; We'd be doing the same show probably\nbut from a beach somewhere, maybe in Maui,\n\n681\n00:34:22.823 --> 00:34:23.499\nI don't know.\n\n682\n00:34:23.499 --> 00:34:26.227\n&gt;&gt; We'd be calling it in,\nwe'd have people standing in for us.\n\n683\n00:34:26.227 --> 00:34:29.282\nI would have somebody with an Adam\nmask and they would be talking,\n\n684\n00:34:29.282 --> 00:34:32.241\nI would be sitting down and\nprobably enjoying, I don't know.\n\n685\n00:34:32.241 --> 00:34:33.205\n&gt;&gt; A little mai tai or something.\n\n686\n00:34:33.205 --> 00:34:34.331\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking more like a single malt.\n\n687\n00:34:34.331 --> 00:34:35.132\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe an espresso, yeah.\n\n688\n00:34:35.132 --> 00:34:36.020\n&gt;&gt; No, a single malt scotch.\n\n689\n00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:36.666\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there we go.\n\n690\n00:34:36.666 --> 00:34:38.233\n&gt;&gt; Good single malt scotch\ncuz then I could afford it.\n\n691\n00:34:38.233 --> 00:34:39.104\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n692\n00:34:39.104 --> 00:34:39.882\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n693\n00:34:39.882 --> 00:34:43.863\n&gt;&gt; All right, well ladies and gentlemen,\ngreat roundout to our overview of that\n\n694\n00:34:43.863 --> 00:34:47.590\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\nas we work our way through that.\n\n695\n00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.839\nWe got a lot more good\ncontent coming your way,\n\n696\n00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:53.530\nwe're gonna get down into the meat of\nthe regulation and start looking out,\n\n697\n00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:56.086\nlooking at some of the things\nthat it defines for us.\n\n698\n00:34:56.086 --> 00:34:57.098\n&gt;&gt; How about looking out at?\n\n699\n00:34:57.098 --> 00:34:58.496\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Looking out at,\n\n700\n00:34:58.496 --> 00:34:59.768\nwe can look out across it, exactly.\n\n701\n00:34:59.768 --> 00:35:03.088\n&gt;&gt; But that is to come in a future\nepisode, that is it for this one.\n\n702\n00:35:03.088 --> 00:35:06.200\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n703\n00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.396\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n704\n00:35:07.396 --> 00:35:09.903\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n705\n00:35:09.903 --> 00:35:15.813\n[MUSIC]\n\n706\n00:35:15.813 --> 00:35:18.682\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:08.253\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.253 --> 00:00:12.292\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:16.270\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.420\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.436\nAnd today, we're talking about\nthe General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n9\n00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:23.970\nIn this episode, we're actually\ncontinuing our thought process,\n\n10\n00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.420\nwe're kinda doing our overview here.\n\n11\n00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.524\nWe're in part three, so\n\n12\n00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:29.898\nif you missed the first two parts you\nmight wanna go back and check those out.\n\n13\n00:00:29.898 --> 00:00:32.490\nBut here to continue our\nconversation is Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.190\nWelcome back, Adam.\n\n15\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.442\n&gt;&gt; Hello, hello, I am having trouble\nfiguring out where to stand in my\n\n16\n00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.139\nlittle personnel container we have here.\n\n17\n00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:41.651\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have these great little\n\n18\n00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:44.813\nthings we stand on in the studio to\nhelp our feet when we're standing up and\n\n19\n00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:48.030\nthere's a bump in the middle and the bump\nis not aligned in the right place.\n\n20\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.191\nSo I'm kind of half on the bump and\nhalf off the bump.\n\n21\n00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:53.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm kind of all over the place.\n\n22\n00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.790\nAnyway, that's not important.\n\n23\n00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.090\nWhat is important is continuing\nour conversation with regards to,\n\n24\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.260\nas you were saying,\nthe overview of the GDPR.\n\n25\n00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.180\nSo in the last episode, we'd left off\nreally drilled down on define the concept\n\n26\n00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.370\nof, or the concepts and differences\nbetween controllers and processors, right?\n\n27\n00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.700\nThe roles and who is responsible,\nwhat are we doing and how do we see that.\n\n28\n00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.240\nAnd then we also spoke just briefly\nabout the concept of fines, right.\n\n29\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.840\nThe regulatory compliance solution\nthat we can bring to bear\n\n30\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.050\nunder to the GDPR if we find\nthat the controller and or\n\n31\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.320\nthe processor is not applying due care and\ndue diligence.\n\n32\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.652\nWe're talking a lot on that.\n&gt;&gt; And not just a slap on the wrist,\n\n33\n00:01:31.652 --> 00:01:32.690\nthose are some serious fines.\n\n34\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.800\n&gt;&gt; Some significant fines, right,\nanywhere from 2 to 4% of gross revenue\n\n35\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.590\ncompany wide, meaning global\ncompanies across the entire company.\n\n36\n00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.810\nNot just the operation in the EU, but\nis sent through the operation globally.\n\n37\n00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.020\nSo for big companies there is\na tremendous amount of liability.\n\n38\n00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.490\nAnd we hinted at the idea that there\nis other things we need to bring into\n\n39\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.680\nthe conversation.\n\n40\n00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.430\nI mentioned in the first episode,\nthe concept of data protection officers.\n\n41\n00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.191\nThis idea of this role in a company\nthat more often than not,\n\n42\n00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:05.287\nmay exist under a different name or\nguise today.\n\n43\n00:02:05.287 --> 00:02:10.217\nMany entities, many of my customers,\nmany students that I've talked to from\n\n44\n00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:15.260\nvarious companies already have this role\ndefined but not under the name of DPO.\n\n45\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.745\nI hear it referred to and you may know it\nas information assurance, so an IA officer\n\n46\n00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:26.355\nor role or function, a chief privacy\nofficer, or CPO, C level role,\n\n47\n00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:31.845\na chief risk officer, we often hear\ntalk about these days more and more.\n\n48\n00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:38.433\nAny kind of oversight role that is in\ncharge of, or as part of its per view and\n\n49\n00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:43.665\npart of its role has underneath\nit the specificity of taking\n\n50\n00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:49.128\na look at oversight in\nthe controller process relationship.\n\n51\n00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:53.489\nAnd ensuring validating,\nverifying compliance around that and\n\n52\n00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.007\nadherence to, in this case industry\nand/or regulatory standards\n\n53\n00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:01.430\nthat would specify how\ndata should be handled.\n\n54\n00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.740\nSo in the healthcare industry for\ninstance, especially in the United States.\n\n55\n00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.899\nIf there is a HIPPA compliance, role,\nfunction or officer in the organization,\n\n56\n00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:15.384\nthey would fall under the category of data\nprotection officers according to the GDPR.\n\n57\n00:03:15.384 --> 00:03:21.097\nUnder Hi Tech the act that is similar to\nHIPAA with regards to educational data and\n\n58\n00:03:21.097 --> 00:03:23.291\nthe information on students.\n\n59\n00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:25.925\nLet's say, hypothetically\nthat you need to maintain and\n\n60\n00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:28.850\nmaintain privacy around as\nan educational institution.\n\n61\n00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.520\nSame idea would apply there.\n\n62\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.303\nThe registrar function and\noffice that typically manages that data.\n\n63\n00:03:34.303 --> 00:03:38.505\nWhoever's in charge of compliance dealing\nwith those issues would generically fall\n\n64\n00:03:38.505 --> 00:03:40.850\ninto the category of\ndata protection officer.\n\n65\n00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.180\nSo many industries,\n\n66\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.810\nmany verticals have this role but probably\njust don't necessarily call it this.\n\n67\n00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.520\nSo it is one of those things to consider,\n\n68\n00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.890\nmany companies will find\nthemselves compliant.\n\n69\n00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.610\nBut compliant with perhaps a rebranding or\nredirecting in terms of role\n\n70\n00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.975\ndefinition of what that specific entity\ndoes or that specific role does.\n\n71\n00:04:00.975 --> 00:04:04.915\nBut the data protection officer\nhas to be appointed available.\n\n72\n00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:10.225\nAll public authorities will have these or\nmust have them under GDPR.\n\n73\n00:04:10.225 --> 00:04:14.714\nThe logic would be that any business, any\ncorporation, any entity should most likely\n\n74\n00:04:14.714 --> 00:04:17.866\nfollow suit and have these,\nright, so it would make sense.\n\n75\n00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:20.799\nWhere the core activity\nof the controller and\n\n76\n00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.739\nthe processor involves quoting, right,\nair quotes, quoting regular and\n\n77\n00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:29.540\nsystematic monitoring of data\nsubjects on a large scale.\n\n78\n00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.760\nSo, we're not talking about, and\nI mentioned this in the first episode,\n\n79\n00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.099\nwhere I said we need this role.\n\n80\n00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.401\nBut for\nsmaller entities at 250 members or less,\n\n81\n00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:42.703\nso a small company that\nhas under 250 employees,\n\n82\n00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:47.610\nwe have received this restriction so\njust be aware of that.\n\n83\n00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.421\nBut for larger entities, where there\nis going to be systematic profiling and\n\n84\n00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:56.206\nprocessing of volumes and\nvolumes of data on data subjects.\n\n85\n00:04:56.206 --> 00:04:58.237\nRemember the data subject\nis simply the user,\n\n86\n00:04:58.237 --> 00:05:01.323\nthe entity that we're gathering\ninformation about on a large scale.\n\n87\n00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:03.850\nSo you'll think of the Microsofts,\nthe Amazons,\n\n88\n00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.729\nthe Googles of the world,\nyou know hundreds of millions,\n\n89\n00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.700\nprobably billions in theory\nof customer records, right?\n\n90\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.520\nThink of airlines, think of anybody in the\ntravel industry, anybody in the healthcare\n\n91\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.970\nindustry, financial services, banking,\ninsurance, any of those kind of things.\n\n92\n00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.360\nYou've got hundreds of\nmillions of customer records.\n\n93\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.570\nThese kinds of entities have to\nhave data protection officers.\n\n94\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.930\nCuz they're gonna have a need,\nbecause of the nature of their activity\n\n95\n00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.180\nof large scale systematic drilling\ndown and gathering of data.\n\n96\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.772\nThey have a need defined under this for\n\n97\n00:05:32.772 --> 00:05:35.073\nthat so you just wanna be\nthinking about that, right.\n\n98\n00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:39.234\n&gt;&gt; Would there be any consideration on the\nfact that there might be more of a prime\n\n99\n00:05:39.234 --> 00:05:41.548\ntarget, if you will, for the bad actors?\n\n100\n00:05:41.548 --> 00:05:46.541\nWhereas a small 250 person company I might\nnot spend the time attacking cuz I'm\n\n101\n00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:48.360\nnot gonna benefit that much.\n\n102\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.789\nDoes that play into it at all?\n\n103\n00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.694\nOr is it just the fact that they've got so\nmany records they need a DPO?\n\n104\n00:05:55.694 --> 00:05:56.960\n&gt;&gt; It's probably a little bit of both.\n\n105\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.670\nIt's hard to say exactly what's in\nthe mind of people as they draft this.\n\n106\n00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.810\nAnd it's hard to say, so I mentioned\nthis exemption for 250 and under.\n\n107\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.870\nThis was actually put in\nin one of the early drafts,\n\n108\n00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.830\nseveral of the early drafts of the GDPR.\n\n109\n00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.260\nThe final version, at least the version we\noperate with now, that has been approved,\n\n110\n00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.070\nthat we see as going into or potentially\nwill be going into effect in 2018,\n\n111\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.960\nactually has that restriction removed.\n\n112\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.172\nSo it was in several of the early\ndrafts it's been removed.\n\n113\n00:06:23.172 --> 00:06:28.070\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean it\nwon't wind up back again, at some point,\n\n114\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.110\neither between kinda where we are today,\nright?\n\n115\n00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.822\nWe're in late 2017 as we're\nputting this overview together for\n\n116\n00:06:34.822 --> 00:06:39.249\nyou, just to give you when you see this\nperhaps months even, a year or more later.\n\n117\n00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.587\nGive you a little context as to where\nwe are when we're speaking about this,\n\n118\n00:06:42.587 --> 00:06:46.027\nbecause you may hear it in this episode\nand say, well, that's kind of silly,\n\n119\n00:06:46.027 --> 00:06:46.930\nit's this way now.\n\n120\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.340\nWhat are they talking about?\n\n121\n00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.770\nA year, roughly, not a year, probably\nactually let's say about eight months\n\n122\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.270\nout from implementation cuz we're sitting\nhere in late October, early November.\n\n123\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.095\nAnd we're scheduled for\nimplementation in May-\n\n124\n00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:00.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n125\n00:07:00.702 --> 00:07:01.426\n&gt;&gt; Late May.\n\n126\n00:07:01.426 --> 00:07:04.507\nSo we're out about six, seven,\neight months from the actual\n\n127\n00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:08.000\ntarget date to implement\nthe formally implement legislation.\n\n128\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.553\nSo when it does go into effect fully?\n\n129\n00:07:10.553 --> 00:07:14.795\nBetween that period, roughly six to\neight months and maybe even very shortly\n\n130\n00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:18.907\nthereafter, there's still discussion and\ntalk about the fact that there\n\n131\n00:07:18.907 --> 00:07:22.715\nmay actually be another run at trying\nto put that minimum bar back in.\n\n132\n00:07:22.715 --> 00:07:27.259\nAnd say, it's unfair, it's a burden,\nan undue regulatory burden to say\n\n133\n00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:30.796\na 50-person company needs\na data protection officer,\n\n134\n00:07:30.796 --> 00:07:35.565\nbecause there's just really not\nthe means and the ability to do that.\n\n135\n00:07:35.565 --> 00:07:39.265\nDoes that mean that you could potentially\nhave a virtual data protection officer?\n\n136\n00:07:39.265 --> 00:07:42.415\nPerhaps, would an audit stand in for\n\n137\n00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:45.315\na data protection officer if\nwe can validate and verify?\n\n138\n00:07:45.315 --> 00:07:50.055\nAccording to some accepted published\nstandards that this is how we\n\n139\n00:07:50.055 --> 00:07:51.500\nare handling certain things.\n\n140\n00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.867\nPerhaps, but does a 50-person\ncompany have the means and\n\n141\n00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:58.837\nthe wherewithal to undergo a formal,\nstructured audit at that level?\n\n142\n00:07:58.837 --> 00:08:01.610\nAny of these activities\ncan cost a lot of money.\n\n143\n00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.359\nHow often would we have to audit?\n\n144\n00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.221\nWould once a year suffice?\n\n145\n00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:08.330\nOr would it have to be once a quarter?\n\n146\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.230\nIf these are not clear questions and\nanswers that would come to mind.\n\n147\n00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.140\nThere's not always a clear path.\n\n148\n00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.101\nWe know right now that\nexemption was there.\n\n149\n00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:20.078\nIt's been removed which means in theory\nevery company would be liable for\n\n150\n00:08:20.078 --> 00:08:23.130\nhaving a Data Protection Officer\nappointed.\n\n151\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.480\nBut that doesn't necessarily\nmean all companies will.\n\n152\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.780\nAnd it doesn't mean that all\ncompanies have a need to.\n\n153\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.920\nSo it's hard sometimes\nto truly understand, but\n\n154\n00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.110\nit's a good thought process, right?\n\n155\n00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.280\nBecause clearly there should be a bar,\nthere should be a break point\n\n156\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.200\nwhere we say, hey, you're a small startup,\nright, and you're dealing with data.\n\n157\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.093\nAnd the logic being you're probably\nnot dealing with huge volumes of data\n\n158\n00:08:44.093 --> 00:08:48.325\nsystematically gathering but what do we\nsay is the break point for systematic?\n\n159\n00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:50.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What do we say is the break point for\n\n160\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.600\nlarge scale processing?\n\n161\n00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.090\nIs it 1,000 records?\n\n162\n00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.362\nIs it 100,000, is it a million?\n\n163\n00:08:54.362 --> 00:08:56.180\n&gt;&gt; Where do we draw that line?\n\n164\n00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.450\n&gt;&gt; There's no definitive scale\nin the legislation that says,\n\n165\n00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:04.290\nhey by the way, a million records\nequals yes and a 100,000 equals no.\n\n166\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.730\nIt would be great if there was guidance at\nleast we'd know definitively what's what.\n\n167\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.760\nBut you don't see that kind of guidance,\nright.\n\n168\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.761\nSo it's hard to say okay,\nthis word equal this.\n\n169\n00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:13.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n170\n00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.650\n&gt;&gt; But we have to understand\nthe spirit which is the spirit says,\n\n171\n00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.160\nhey you gotta deal with a very\nlarge volume of customer data.\n\n172\n00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.206\nThe likelihood goes up\nas you were suggesting,\n\n173\n00:09:22.206 --> 00:09:24.160\nright, I think it's great\nwe're thinking about it.\n\n174\n00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.260\nThat you may become a target\nas a company or an entity for\n\n175\n00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.350\ncertain kinds of activity.\n\n176\n00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.802\nBad actors in other words.\n\n177\n00:09:30.802 --> 00:09:35.150\nMay choose to come and target you cuz\nyou have a lot of what they want,\n\n178\n00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.140\nversus a small company that may really\nnot have quite a number of records or\n\n179\n00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.780\nnot have a enough that's it's\nworth the time and effort.\n\n180\n00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.434\nBut you could also look at it\nfrom the other perspective,\n\n181\n00:09:43.434 --> 00:09:45.136\na small company may not have\nas much security protection.\n\n182\n00:09:45.136 --> 00:09:46.872\n&gt;&gt; Less security, easier target.\n\n183\n00:09:46.872 --> 00:09:49.080\n&gt;&gt; And\na big company may have quite a lot more.\n\n184\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.960\nRight, so maybe a harder or\neasier target, as you were saying.\n\n185\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.280\nSo there's a lot of ways to spin that,\nand your mind can do somersaults there.\n\n186\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.870\nSo we just wanna make note about that and\nat least be aware of that.\n\n187\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.170\nIt's an interesting thought process, but\nlet's assume, regardless of whether you\n\n188\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.950\nthink ultimately you're gonna have a Data\nProtection Officer in play or you may be\n\n189\n00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.670\ntoo small or just not have a need for one,\nthe idea that there is this defined role.\n\n190\n00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.240\nAnd what it does,\nis kinda what we wanna speak about.\n\n191\n00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.600\nA large scale systematic processing\nof this kind of data and/or\n\n192\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.730\nspecial categories of personal data.\n\n193\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:25.080\nThings that reveal racial, ethnic origin,\npolitical opinion, religious or\n\n194\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.440\nphilosophical beliefs.\n\n195\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.460\nThings of that nature also\nfall under this category.\n\n196\n00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.990\nSo if we do large systematic gathering\nof data as a marketing entity, or\n\n197\n00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:39.130\nas a polling entity, where we're asking\nquestions and we are now gathering\n\n198\n00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:43.270\nthis data to process it, as an educational\ninstitution where we're doing surveys.\n\n199\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.590\nPerhaps, I mean just thinking off the top\nof my head about categories of entities\n\n200\n00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.030\nthat maybe in the public or private\nsphere or both, that are not traditional\n\n201\n00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.180\ncommercial entities necessarily,\nbut are asking these questions.\n\n202\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.060\nThey would, in theory,\n\n203\n00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.742\nhave a burden in order to maintain\na Data Protection Officer.\n\n204\n00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:02.990\nSo again, there are some things\nhere we wanna be aware of, right?\n\n205\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.055\nThe regulation requires that they have,\nagain quoting.\n\n206\n00:11:06.055 --> 00:11:06.982\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I'll assume you did yours.\n\n207\n00:11:06.982 --> 00:11:08.240\n&gt;&gt; That's okay [LAUGH].\n\n208\n00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.430\n&gt;&gt; That they have expert knowledge,\nright, quoting directly,\n\n209\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.240\nexpert knowledge of data\nprotection law and practices.\n\n210\n00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.160\nThe level of which should be\ndetermined in particular according to\n\n211\n00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.350\nthe data processing\noperations carried out.\n\n212\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.590\nAnd the protection required for\n\n213\n00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.190\nthe personal data processed by\nthe controller or the processor.\n\n214\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.969\nIn other words, right,\nthis role, this entity that has\n\n215\n00:11:28.969 --> 00:11:33.459\nthe Data Protection Officer,\nthis role has to be specified based on\n\n216\n00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:39.013\nthe requirements of the protection needed\nto carry out the processing of the data.\n\n217\n00:11:39.013 --> 00:11:42.532\nAnd to do so in a way that's aligned with\nthe regulations based on controller and\n\n218\n00:11:42.532 --> 00:11:44.330\nprocessor, a relationship.\n\n219\n00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.820\nSo remember, the controller overseas and\nis responsible for vetting the processor.\n\n220\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.060\nI may be the controller,\nI may be the company that says,\n\n221\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:58.410\nI want marketing segmentation data on all\nmillennials that are interested in blah.\n\n222\n00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.950\nAnd I go out and I hire a marketing\nfirm that's gonna go do the survey and\n\n223\n00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.490\nget me that data, some sort of research or\nintelligence firm.\n\n224\n00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.780\nThey become the processor.\n\n225\n00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.270\nI am the controller.\n\n226\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.130\nI'm the customer that has the need, right?\n\n227\n00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.190\nI want the data.\n\n228\n00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.750\nI'm specifying what I want, how I want it.\n\n229\n00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.400\nI'm hiring a processor.\n\n230\n00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.912\nIt's my responsibility under\nGDPR as the controller to ensure\n\n231\n00:12:18.912 --> 00:12:21.450\nthat the processor acts with integrity.\n\n232\n00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.420\nAnd acts in the best interest and\nthe spirit and letter of the law.\n\n233\n00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.916\nAnd if they don't,\nremember, I'm on the hook.\n\n234\n00:12:26.916 --> 00:12:27.420\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n235\n00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:32.210\n&gt;&gt; So are they, but we can see blame\nassigned here across the board.\n\n236\n00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:38.180\nSo, it's the Data Protection Officer's\ntask to insure that data is protected.\n\n237\n00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.660\nBut we have to make sure\nthat they do certain things.\n\n238\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.350\nThings like informing and\nadvising the controller and\n\n239\n00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:48.200\nprocessor and employees of their\nobligations to comply under the GDPR.\n\n240\n00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.400\nSo as a result and there,\nand/or any other data protection laws,\n\n241\n00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.750\nright, cuz there is more than\njust the GDPR we talked about.\n\n242\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.070\nThe data protection directive\nversus the law enforcement.\n\n243\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.800\nSo, the GDPR is the focus\nof our conversations here.\n\n244\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.070\nBut I made it clear in\nour opening episode,\n\n245\n00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.730\nthere are other things that exist around\nit that we have to take into account.\n\n246\n00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.970\nBoth countries specific like\nthe Data Protection Act in the UK.\n\n247\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:15.620\nBroader like the EU9546 directive\nof the GDPR is replacing.\n\n248\n00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.740\nThe data protection directive which\nis coming into effect around that.\n\n249\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.630\nThere's all these other things, right, so.\n\n250\n00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.740\nThe Data Protection Officer\nhas a right and\n\n251\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.140\nresponsibility to enforce and\ninform, right?\n\n252\n00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.550\nEnforce and inform around compliance, and\nreminding us of our responsibilities.\n\n253\n00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:37.490\nMonitoring compliance including internal\ndata protection activities, data awareness\n\n254\n00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.560\ntraining of staffs in order to comply,\nas well as conducting internal audits.\n\n255\n00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.450\nWe mentioned the audit verification and\nvalidation thought process.\n\n256\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.280\nSo, that's gonna be important.\n\n257\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.900\nAdvising with regards to data protection\nimpact assessments, when required.\n\n258\n00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:55.708\nThere is a specific reference to\nArticle 33 in the GDPR when we\n\n259\n00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:57.896\ntalk about certain things.\n\n260\n00:13:57.896 --> 00:14:01.664\nSo you'll hear me mention on occasion,\nit's this article or\n\n261\n00:14:01.664 --> 00:14:03.640\nit's this particular area.\n\n262\n00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.970\nRemember, it's 88 pages, right?\n\n263\n00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.050\nAnd so give me one second\nbefore we go to my machine.\n\n264\n00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.140\nI just have to bring up the appropriate\narea that we're talking about.\n\n265\n00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.160\nBut when I mention Article 33, right.\n\n266\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.580\nSo we're looking at and\ntrying to engage around the idea,\n\n267\n00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.275\nthere it is I'm just looking for\nmy bar, hold on I'm just searching.\n\n268\n00:14:23.275 --> 00:14:26.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is 88 pages after all.\n\n269\n00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:34.381\nSo you know what we're doing is we're\nlooking for, The, there's Article 13.\n\n270\n00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.074\nThere is article 55.\n\n271\n00:14:38.074 --> 00:14:38.932\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So towards the end,\n\n272\n00:14:38.932 --> 00:14:41.350\nI'm just scrolling through, I'm just\ntrying to find, just give me one second.\n\n273\n00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.180\nI'm almost there.\n\n274\n00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.799\nThere's Article 44.\n\n275\n00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:48.610\nBut towards the back of the document, out\nbeyond just some of the initial language,\n\n276\n00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:52.900\nwe have all the different articles,\nlike Article 40, Code of Conduct.\n\n277\n00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.060\nArticle 37, Designation of\nthe Data Protection Officer,\n\n278\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.460\nwhich we'll take a look\nat in just a minute, but\n\n279\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.480\nthey're broken up by section and all\nthese articles that append essentially,\n\n280\n00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.128\nthis specific functionality\nmay be talking about.\n\n281\n00:15:06.128 --> 00:15:10.705\nAnd so, designation of the Data Protection\nOfficer, for instance, takes place in\n\n282\n00:15:10.705 --> 00:15:14.893\nArticle 37, where we see the role\ndefined that I'm kinda listing for you,\n\n283\n00:15:14.893 --> 00:15:18.440\nthe activities associated with it,\nthings of that nature.\n\n284\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.670\nBut with regards to what we we're just\ndiscussing, Article 33 is referenced\n\n285\n00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:28.100\nspecifically, so Article 33 is going to be\n\n286\n00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:33.460\nthe notification of a personnel data\nbreach to the supervisory authority.\n\n287\n00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.820\nIf you wanna take a look,\nI just have the right one up now.\n\n288\n00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.970\nSo as you go back through the end of\nthe document, or towards the middle to\n\n289\n00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.700\nend of the document, you start to see\nall these articles numerically laid out.\n\n290\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.140\nArticle 33, you'll hear me\nrefer to it from time to time,\n\n291\n00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.900\nin some of our discussions.\n\n292\n00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.230\nLays out all the details\naround specificity\n\n293\n00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.960\nof how we have to respond\nwhen there is a data breach.\n\n294\n00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.862\nWho we report to,\n\n295\n00:15:54.862 --> 00:15:57.885\nit's called the supervisory\nauthority that we have to report to.\n\n296\n00:15:57.885 --> 00:16:02.355\nAnd as a result, what the Data Protection\nOfficer may as a responsibility have to\n\n297\n00:16:02.355 --> 00:16:03.671\naddress is training for\n\n298\n00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:07.373\ninternal staff to ensure they\nunderstand their responsibility.\n\n299\n00:16:07.373 --> 00:16:10.777\nUnder Article 33,\nbecause that's gonna be important.\n\n300\n00:16:10.777 --> 00:16:14.640\nArticle 34, communication of a personal\ndata breach to the data subject.\n\n301\n00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.009\nThey're gonna be responsible for\n\n302\n00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:18.092\nmarking sure we are trained\non how to deal with that.\n\n303\n00:16:18.092 --> 00:16:23.083\nThe data subject, remember, is the owner\nof the data, whereas the company or\n\n304\n00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:26.575\nthe processor is gonna have\nto deal with their aspect.\n\n305\n00:16:26.575 --> 00:16:29.845\nHey, we had your data, we screwed up,\nbut we also have to notify you so\n\n306\n00:16:29.845 --> 00:16:30.605\nyou can take steps.\n\n307\n00:16:30.605 --> 00:16:32.520\nSo there's articles\naddressing all of this.\n\n308\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.375\nArticle 35, the impact assessment\nwe were just talking about, right,\n\n309\n00:16:36.375 --> 00:16:38.527\nthe data protection impact assessment.\n\n310\n00:16:38.527 --> 00:16:39.967\nSo all these things,\n\n311\n00:16:39.967 --> 00:16:44.597\nright, are part of the conversation around\nthe data protection officer, their role,\n\n312\n00:16:44.597 --> 00:16:49.397\nwhat they have to do in order to make sure\nthat not only that they are acting in\n\n313\n00:16:49.397 --> 00:16:54.410\naccordance, but that we as the processor,\nwe as the controller,\n\n314\n00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:59.600\none or both, the owners and the managers\nof data, are also acting in accordance.\n\n315\n00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.655\nThat's very important, so.\n\n316\n00:17:00.655 --> 00:17:03.992\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's really kinda\ninteresting as we go through this,\n\n317\n00:17:03.992 --> 00:17:06.320\nI see a few things that pique my interest.\n\n318\n00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.570\nOne, I see that the data protection\nofficer they specify in the regulation,\n\n319\n00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.780\nhe must be an expert in data protection.\n\n320\n00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:14.770\n&gt;&gt; They, her or she.\n\n321\n00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.120\n&gt;&gt; He or she, yes.\n\n322\n00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.690\nSo that means,\n&gt;&gt; In data protection, correct.\n\n323\n00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:18.350\n&gt;&gt; In data protection.\n\n324\n00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:21.354\nSo you're not gonna be able just say,\nwait, who is our DPO?\n\n325\n00:17:21.354 --> 00:17:23.019\nMike, Mike, you're our DPO, right?\n\n326\n00:17:23.019 --> 00:17:25.713\nI mean this has to be\nsomebody that's trained, or\n\n327\n00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:29.450\nat least has the skill set to deal\nwith this, which I think is great.\n\n328\n00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.542\nAnd it seems like they're addressing\nissues that we've seen recently in\n\n329\n00:17:33.542 --> 00:17:37.106\nthe news, where these data breaches occur,\nand it's months or\n\n330\n00:17:37.106 --> 00:17:40.604\neven longer before the information\nis released that hey,\n\n331\n00:17:40.604 --> 00:17:44.940\nwe've lost this information,\nyour data was stolen last year.\n\n332\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.520\nSo it's really nice that you see those\nkind of things being addressed in\n\n333\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.210\nthe regulation.\n\n334\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Yahoo, for instance, right?\n\n335\n00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.228\nVerizon had a data breach recently,\nYahoo certainly.\n\n336\n00:17:53.228 --> 00:17:56.990\nI mean there's been several sterling\nexamples of, in some cases,\n\n337\n00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.595\nmulti-year disclosure issues\nwhere they haven't disclosed for\n\n338\n00:18:00.595 --> 00:18:01.905\nseveral years after the fact.\n\n339\n00:18:01.905 --> 00:18:05.310\nVerizon kind of inherited that when they\n[LAUGH] are acquiring that now, right?\n\n340\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.869\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'd like to buy you and\n\n341\n00:18:06.869 --> 00:18:09.754\nbuy all of the concerns that go with you,\nand, well.\n\n342\n00:18:09.754 --> 00:18:10.600\n&gt;&gt; You get a good price.\n\n343\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.260\n&gt;&gt; You do, but\nI mean just think about, literally,\n\n344\n00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.370\nyou're essentially buying into\na nonstop onslaught of lawsuits.\n\n345\n00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.787\nI mean, you discount the price\nheavily because you think,\n\n346\n00:18:19.787 --> 00:18:22.345\nokay this is roughly what we're\ngoing to be able to settle for,\n\n347\n00:18:22.345 --> 00:18:24.800\nbecause you know those\nconversations went on.\n\n348\n00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.820\nThe actuaries came out and\n\n349\n00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.550\nsaid we think it's going to be\nthis to settle this whole thing.\n\n350\n00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.049\nYou're buying it for this,\ndiscount it this amount and\n\n351\n00:18:31.049 --> 00:18:32.450\nyou'll still come out ahead.\n\n352\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.060\nBut even then, I mean you know.\n\n353\n00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.600\n&gt;&gt; That's a risk.\n\n354\n00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.440\n&gt;&gt; You never know, right?\n\n355\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.050\nBecause I mean you could, under\nthe light of something like this law,\n\n356\n00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.880\nwho knows what that outcome could be,\nright?\n\n357\n00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.110\nSo making sure we know what\nthose roles are, working and\n\n358\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.686\ncooperating with the controller or\n\n359\n00:18:45.686 --> 00:18:50.420\nprocessors, supervisory authority as\nI suggested under Articles 33 and 34.\n\n360\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.190\nAnd serving as point of contact, most\nimportantly, as you were suggesting, for\n\n361\n00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:58.405\nall this translation,\ncommunication on anything relating\n\n362\n00:18:58.405 --> 00:19:02.035\nto any of these concerns around breaches\nas you saw displayed in those articles.\n\n363\n00:19:02.035 --> 00:19:06.480\nBeing available for inquiries around\nthe data protection practices,\n\n364\n00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.625\nwithdrawal of consent, the right to\nbe forgotten and any related rights.\n\n365\n00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:13.585\nSo data protection officer becomes that\nsingle point of contact, that focal\n\n366\n00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:18.545\npoint in and around the company for\nthe management of this information flow.\n\n367\n00:19:18.545 --> 00:19:22.700\nYou made an interesting point when you\nwere saying he or she needs to be trained.\n\n368\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.780\nThey need to have the skills to do this.\n\n369\n00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.860\nThey may either come in with that or\nmay be trained.\n\n370\n00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.487\nThe data protection officer, under GDPR,\n\n371\n00:19:29.487 --> 00:19:33.889\nhas the right to insist on company\nresources to support them in the role and\n\n372\n00:19:33.889 --> 00:19:37.166\nfulfill their job,\nas well as for ongoing training.\n\n373\n00:19:37.166 --> 00:19:39.580\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Now again, what does that mean?\n\n374\n00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:45.372\nDoes it say you get $10,000 or\nthe equivalent in local currency per year?\n\n375\n00:19:45.372 --> 00:19:48.530\nDoes it mean you get a bank account\nwith an expense associated with it?\n\n376\n00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:52.660\nIt just means that the language is\nsuch that we're saying clearly and\n\n377\n00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.590\nunequivocably to the company,\n\n378\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:57.950\nhey look, this is not just something we\nput on paper, something that you play at.\n\n379\n00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.560\nThis is a role, as you said, as we agreed.\n\n380\n00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.450\nWe have to assign someone\nserious to this role.\n\n381\n00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.830\nThey have to be certified and\nor have certain skills.\n\n382\n00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.470\nAnd they have to be supported\nongoing in those activities\n\n383\n00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.950\nto ensure that they can actually\nlive up to these expectations.\n\n384\n00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.703\nAnd you gotta put some money and resources\nup in order to continue to do that.\n\n385\n00:20:17.703 --> 00:20:18.840\nIt's gonna be very important, right?\n\n386\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.196\nThey have to have access, the DPO does, to\nthe company's data processing personnel.\n\n387\n00:20:23.196 --> 00:20:26.690\nAll operations and those people, in other\nwords, should be available to them.\n\n388\n00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.270\nThey should be able, because remember\nof the internal audit capability and\n\n389\n00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.940\nfunction we spoke about, to be able to\ngo in and verify and validate what's\n\n390\n00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.580\nhappening within and around\nthe organization as a result, right?\n\n391\n00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.780\nThey have to have also a direct\nreporting line to the highest management\n\n392\n00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.960\nlevels of the company.\n\n393\n00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.210\nQuoting, to the highest management level,\nspecifically language from the GDPR.\n\n394\n00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:50.450\nSo they should report directly\nup to the president, the CEO.\n\n395\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.770\nAgain, we don't specify,\nbecause you don't know,\n\n396\n00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.590\nevery company handles that differently.\n\n397\n00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.980\nBut generically the idea is,\nwe're not going through three or four or\n\n398\n00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.470\nfive levels of bureaucracy, filtering\nthat in such a way that essentially\n\n399\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.960\nthe report never reaches the proper\nresponsible authority or\n\n400\n00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.320\nparty that should be\nable to be aware of it.\n\n401\n00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.340\nBut we go direct to the top, because\nthen we can hold someone accountable.\n\n402\n00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:17.100\nHey, I told Mike, right,\nthat this happening in my role as DPO.\n\n403\n00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.927\nMike in theory, just let's say in our\nexample, is the head of our company.\n\n404\n00:21:20.927 --> 00:21:25.274\nAnd if Mike chooses to ignore it or just\ndoesn't do something, I've done my job,\n\n405\n00:21:25.274 --> 00:21:28.173\nbut the reality is there's\ngonna be repercussions and\n\n406\n00:21:28.173 --> 00:21:32.600\nnow they sit squarely right at the head\nof the company cuz Mike was informed.\n\n407\n00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.460\nBut if I never got to Mike, right, because\nI had to go through three of four levels\n\n408\n00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.830\nof abstraction, Mike rightly can say look,\nI would have done something.\n\n409\n00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.484\n&gt;&gt; Right. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; If you'd\njust came and told me, but\n\n410\n00:21:43.484 --> 00:21:46.995\nI never heard from whoever\nthat this was going on.\n\n411\n00:21:46.995 --> 00:21:49.607\nI'm gonna go hold them accountable,\nbut at the end of the day,\n\n412\n00:21:49.607 --> 00:21:52.320\nhow could I have done something\nif I wasn't aware, right?\n\n413\n00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.886\nAnd that's kind of been the issue and\nthe concern in some of these cases where\n\n414\n00:21:55.886 --> 00:21:59.965\nthe highest levels of leadership either\nrightly or wrongly claim ignorance, right?\n\n415\n00:21:59.965 --> 00:22:01.404\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; We don't know for sure, but\n\n416\n00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:04.840\nyou know you sometimes find it hard to\nbelieve based on the stories they didn't\n\n417\n00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.398\nreally know that this was going on, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a little convenient.\n\n418\n00:22:07.398 --> 00:22:08.776\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a little bit, right?\n\n419\n00:22:08.776 --> 00:22:11.558\nBut in theory, this is now\ngonna be done away with, right,\n\n420\n00:22:11.558 --> 00:22:13.795\nbecause we should see\nthat reporting going up.\n\n421\n00:22:13.795 --> 00:22:15.455\nSo, wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n422\n00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.090\nWe also expressly, and\nthis is also really important.\n\n423\n00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:25.690\nWe also expressly in the regulation\nprevent the dismissal or censure\n\n424\n00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:30.150\nof the data protection officer as a result\nof them doing and performing their duties.\n\n425\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.381\nAnd we don't place any length or\nlimitations on the length of the their\n\n426\n00:22:33.381 --> 00:22:36.900\ntenure, meaning, you'll appoint them but\nonly for a year.\n\n427\n00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.870\nYou appoint them, but only for\nsix months after the breach.\n\n428\n00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:43.890\nThey ratted you out and we just nailed\nyou for 4% of your corporate profits?\n\n429\n00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.480\nYeah, you can't go fire them now,\nthat's retribution.\n\n430\n00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.620\nThey stay, right,\nyou can't get rid of them.\n\n431\n00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.010\nSo that's expressly written\ninto the GDPR as well.\n\n432\n00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:56.330\nWhich again is a tremendous,\ntremendous change from where we've been.\n\n433\n00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:01.012\nBecause we know, probably many of you I'm\nsure, and certainly even if you haven't\n\n434\n00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:04.850\nexperienced it directly, and I hope you\nnever have, but we've certainly all heard\n\n435\n00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:09.230\nstories about retribution in\nthe workplace for a variety of reasons.\n\n436\n00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:13.709\nWhistleblowers, generically is the term\nsometimes we hear assigned very\n\n437\n00:23:13.709 --> 00:23:14.705\nincorrectly and\n\n438\n00:23:14.705 --> 00:23:19.111\nI think inappropriately to people that\nare trying to do the right thing and\n\n439\n00:23:19.111 --> 00:23:23.539\nexpose some sort of issue or concern,\nand bring it to light, rightly so.\n\n440\n00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:26.200\nI think it's a horrible term that we\nuse in order to describe that behavior.\n\n441\n00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.830\nIt's very negative and it doesn't\ncarry the right connotation at all.\n\n442\n00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:33.978\nBut you probably have heard that\nterm used in the press or wherever.\n\n443\n00:23:33.978 --> 00:23:38.047\nAnd those people that are trying\nto expose that issue or\n\n444\n00:23:38.047 --> 00:23:43.268\nconcern should be congratulated and\ncelebrated, not castigated and\n\n445\n00:23:43.268 --> 00:23:48.932\nunfortunately in many cases exiled,\nand perhaps even fired incorrectly or\n\n446\n00:23:48.932 --> 00:23:53.390\nwrongly, and hounded as a result\nof their brave behavior.\n\n447\n00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:58.130\nAnd because of that, this protection is so\ncritical because it formalizes in\n\n448\n00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.440\nlaw the fact that we cannot behave\nthat way as a company, as an entity.\n\n449\n00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.710\nThat is unacceptable.\n\n450\n00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.294\nNow the nice thing about this is,\nagain, thinking about the global scope,\n\n451\n00:24:07.294 --> 00:24:11.326\ncompanies that have multiple sites and\nor multiple geographies, multinationals,\n\n452\n00:24:11.326 --> 00:24:12.897\nlet's say, or conglomerates.\n\n453\n00:24:12.897 --> 00:24:16.469\nCan actually assign a single data\nprotection officer globally if they\n\n454\n00:24:16.469 --> 00:24:17.082\nchoose to.\n\n455\n00:24:17.082 --> 00:24:20.477\nAs long as that Data Protection Officer,\nagain quoting directly,\n\n456\n00:24:20.477 --> 00:24:22.630\nis easily accessible for me to establish.\n\n457\n00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:26.337\nWhen essentially as long as there is\nsome way to communicate with them and\n\n458\n00:24:26.337 --> 00:24:29.830\nhave that relationship be transparent,\nwe're okay with you.\n\n459\n00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.225\nI say we, I'm the one whose okay with you.\n\n460\n00:24:31.225 --> 00:24:33.836\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wrote on this piece of paper Adam\n\n461\n00:24:33.836 --> 00:24:38.465\nsaid, right, the GDPR says that it is\nokay to have a single DPO globally,\n\n462\n00:24:38.465 --> 00:24:43.318\nas long as you are figuring out a way to\noperate in such a way that they're gonna\n\n463\n00:24:43.318 --> 00:24:44.380\nbe accessible.\n\n464\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.900\nSo that is kind of nice as well.\n\n465\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n466\n00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.240\n&gt;&gt; As a nod to the fact that you\ncan't fund 25 of these positions, and\n\n467\n00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.980\nwe're not talking about\na $5 an hour position.\n\n468\n00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.325\nThis is, you're talking about\na position that's probably going to\n\n469\n00:24:56.325 --> 00:25:00.190\nbe an expensive position, and there's\nobviously going to be a lot of resources\n\n470\n00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.860\nassociated with having this role on staff.\n\n471\n00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.770\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n472\n00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.390\nKeep in mind, as I made the point very\nstrenuously early on in this discussion,\n\n473\n00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:12.710\nmany companies already have this\ncapability, internal audit departments,\n\n474\n00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.720\nIA, risk management.\n\n475\n00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.393\nProject managers in general,\nunderstand and\n\n476\n00:25:17.393 --> 00:25:21.572\nhave these aspects around what they do,\nalthough they may not be trained\n\n477\n00:25:21.572 --> 00:25:24.601\nspecifically around the needs\nof data protection.\n\n478\n00:25:24.601 --> 00:25:27.950\nBut broadly they understand\nthe logic of a role like this.\n\n479\n00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.590\nThere's many candidates in the business\ntraditionally, especially a large global\n\n480\n00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:36.290\nbusiness, that can fill this role with\nlittle to know additional requirements.\n\n481\n00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.890\nBut then shifting them,\nshifting the line on and\n\n482\n00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.690\nthen shifting the responsibility and\n\n483\n00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:45.300\nfunding that position long term becomes\nthe conversation inside the business.\n\n484\n00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.690\nRight, so keep that in mind.\n\n485\n00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.680\nAlso, we can outsource this, by the way.\n\n486\n00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.810\nThere is language specifically, that does\nallow for the Data Protection Officer\n\n487\n00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.970\nfunction, to be performed by either\nan employee of the controller or\n\n488\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.960\nprocessor, or\nby a third party service provider.\n\n489\n00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.860\nSo in other words, again,\n\n490\n00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.380\nexpressly stated,\nwe actually can see an outsourcing.\n\n491\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.970\nAnd you'll see this become a candidate for\nas a service, right,\n\n492\n00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:07.910\nwhatever that would be called.\n\n493\n00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.060\nAnd we have that already.\n\n494\n00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.906\nManaged security service providers,\nMSSPs essentially fall into this category,\n\n495\n00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:17.741\nalthough the focus is much more\nnarrowly defined for the DPO role.\n\n496\n00:26:17.741 --> 00:26:21.047\nBut broadly, you're outsourcing\nSecurity as a Service, SECaaS,\n\n497\n00:26:21.047 --> 00:26:24.125\nas we often here referred to, and\nall things that go under that,\n\n498\n00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:27.499\nthis could be a subset of that, and\nthat's often happening already.\n\n499\n00:26:27.499 --> 00:26:31.660\nThat there like two shares in\nthe PricewaterhouseCooper's in the world,\n\n500\n00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.755\nthose kind of service entities that\nyou audit work, do compliance work,\n\n501\n00:26:35.755 --> 00:26:39.519\ndo services work on a contractual and\non an ad hoc, as needed basis,\n\n502\n00:26:39.519 --> 00:26:41.790\nare already providing these services.\n\n503\n00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:45.275\nThe IBMs, the Hewlett Packards of\nthe world, all the services entities,\n\n504\n00:26:45.275 --> 00:26:46.282\nDell etc., right.\n\n505\n00:26:46.282 --> 00:26:49.250\nThey're all doing this kind of work and\nhave done it for years.\n\n506\n00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.919\nI mean, this is not new, but\n\n507\n00:26:50.919 --> 00:26:54.580\nthe focus specifically in this\none area is a subset of this.\n\n508\n00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.976\nOften discussed under cyber risk,\nand cyber risk management today,\n\n509\n00:26:57.976 --> 00:27:01.714\nwhich is the category you often see in\nthis practice areas that this would fall\n\n510\n00:27:01.714 --> 00:27:03.511\nunder with regards to a cloud focus.\n\n511\n00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:07.114\nAnd broadening that scope and\nthen narrowing the focus with regards\n\n512\n00:27:07.114 --> 00:27:11.300\njust to data protection would be the way\nto go for many companies and entities.\n\n513\n00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.548\nYou heard it here first, by the way.\n\n514\n00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:15.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In case that comes up later, all right.\n\n515\n00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:16.690\nAll right, so just keep that in mind.\n\n516\n00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.320\nSee here, the Data Protection Officer\nrole, really important for what we do.\n\n517\n00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.750\nWhat about privacy matter?\n\n518\n00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.210\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yet another tack on for\n\n519\n00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.260\nthis, if you think about it.\n\n520\n00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.442\nRegulation mandate's\na risk-based approach.\n\n521\n00:27:26.442 --> 00:27:29.975\nA risk-based approach, where the\nappropriate organizational controls have\n\n522\n00:27:29.975 --> 00:27:33.795\nto be developed and/or put in\nplace based on a sliding scale,\n\n523\n00:27:33.795 --> 00:27:36.385\nagainst the degree of risk associated\nwith the process activity.\n\n524\n00:27:36.385 --> 00:27:39.865\nWhich is not unusual, and not,\nit's essentially the norm today.\n\n525\n00:27:39.865 --> 00:27:41.495\nI mean, this is what we do.\n\n526\n00:27:41.495 --> 00:27:43.625\nWe talk about risk, risk management.\n\n527\n00:27:43.625 --> 00:27:48.085\nYou've heard Mike and I, Mike, Cherokee,\nand myself, lots of us talk about\n\n528\n00:27:48.085 --> 00:27:52.580\nrisk in all of our areas of expertise,\nacross anything we do, right?\n\n529\n00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.600\nAnd the idea of understanding that return\non investment, that's sliding scale\n\n530\n00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.370\nwith regards to a risk assessment matrix,\nthe tool we would formally use to do this.\n\n531\n00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.683\nA business impact assessment to rate and\nrank services and\n\n532\n00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:08.144\nofferings in the company unless\nunderstand and described.\n\n533\n00:28:08.144 --> 00:28:11.944\nA risk value to them for a variety of\nreasons, one of which being our ability to\n\n534\n00:28:11.944 --> 00:28:16.380\nunderstand the impact of the risk, is the\nunderlying thought process here, right?\n\n535\n00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:21.350\nAnd so as a result we need to focus\nthe risk assessment instead broadly\n\n536\n00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.550\non things like how much is it gonna cost?\n\n537\n00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:28.550\nWe need to reassess and refocus that\naround a focus on the protection of data\n\n538\n00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:32.440\nsubject rights with regards to\nprivacy management under the GDPR.\n\n539\n00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.730\nThis becomes important.\n\n540\n00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:37.720\nWe need to be thinking about baking\nin data protection safeguards from\n\n541\n00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.680\nthe earliest stages of any activity and\nservice.\n\n542\n00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.520\nGo back to the fundamentals we've\nbeen talking about for years.\n\n543\n00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.140\nSecurity, early and often, right?\n\n544\n00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:50.570\nThe earlier you break down the pieces\nbake in security in the SDLC,\n\n545\n00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:54.520\nthe system or software development life\ncycle, the better off the outcomes are.\n\n546\n00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.470\nThe more likely you are to be\naligned with secure outcomes.\n\n547\n00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.640\nMore likely you are in other\nwords to have success.\n\n548\n00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.140\nWe hear this referred to\nas privacy by design.\n\n549\n00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.980\nJust like you hear security by design,\n\n550\n00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:08.950\noften called out when we hear integrating\nsecurity in all phases of the SDLC.\n\n551\n00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.420\nSo now, privacy by design.\n\n552\n00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:14.812\nYou know kind of cohabitating with\nsecurity by design and risk mitigation.\n\n553\n00:29:14.812 --> 00:29:16.410\nYou wanna be thinking\nabout all of these things.\n\n554\n00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:20.080\nBecause these are all parts of what we\nare gonna need to be focused on and\n\n555\n00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.780\nreally be aware of over all.\n\n556\n00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.590\nThere is also an increased emphasis\nthere on record keeping for controllers.\n\n557\n00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:28.860\nMaking sure we have great documentation,\nagain no surprise, hopefully.\n\n558\n00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.580\nI mean, we just prattle on\nforever about the need for and\n\n559\n00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.070\nthe great importance for\nnot only documentation but\n\n560\n00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.600\nclear and concise,\ncontextually accurate documentation.\n\n561\n00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.740\nAnd so we need that because we\nhave to have that to show and\n\n562\n00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.810\nmeet the compliance to meet the burdens.\n\n563\n00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:47.530\nTo meet the burden of compliance.\n\n564\n00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.345\nThis is what happens when this moves\na lot quicker than this does, right.\n\n565\n00:29:50.345 --> 00:29:52.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is what we need to ensure\n\n566\n00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.910\nthat we're able to meet and show that\nwe're meeting the burden for compliance.\n\n567\n00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:02.110\nBut also, to improve over time and\nto show that we are on track to improve.\n\n568\n00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:06.230\nSo we need to have not just good, but\nreally great documentation around privacy\n\n569\n00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:10.430\nmanagement, and records compliance is one\nof those key areas we have to think about.\n\n570\n00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.650\nAgain, there is an exclusion here.\n\n571\n00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.940\nThis one still is in the legislation.\n\n572\n00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.490\nHard to say for\nsure where this will wind up.\n\n573\n00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:23.753\nBut again, for staff under or less than\n250 people, there's an exclusion for\n\n574\n00:30:23.753 --> 00:30:30.580\nsmall businesses where data processing\nmay not be considered a significant risk.\n\n575\n00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.459\nWhat you call a significant risk\nis obviously up in the air,\n\n576\n00:30:33.459 --> 00:30:34.792\nit's hard to say for sure.\n\n577\n00:30:34.792 --> 00:30:39.012\nBut with regards to ensuring that we have,\nkind of this focus on record keeping,\n\n578\n00:30:39.012 --> 00:30:40.937\nif you're under 250 employees,\n\n579\n00:30:40.937 --> 00:30:45.280\nyou're not considered to be as significant\na risk as you indicated, right.\n\n580\n00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.860\nLarger companies may be, so there is\nthat thought process in certain areas,\n\n581\n00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.510\nwe just wanna make sure we're aware of\nthat and we're thinking about that.\n\n582\n00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.270\n&gt;&gt;

about not just\nthe general landscape but\n\n16\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.570\nreally start to drill in although\nat a high level cuz we're gonna\n\n17\n00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.800\nhave even more detail developed around\na lot of these thoughts as we continue.\n\n18\n00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.190\nBut we started to drill in at a high\nlevel about many of the areas of

with\nprivacy management a little bit.\n\n21\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.020\nTalk about the concept and the definition\nof private data or data privacy,\n\n22\n00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.660\nwhat that

00:01:24.170\naccount, I think.\n\n30\n00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.724\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\n31\n00:01:24.724 --> 00:01:26.460\n&gt;&gt; Also, we did talk about all that.\n\n32\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.399\nSo we're gonna continue\n[LAUGH] kind of drilling down.\n\n33\n00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.950\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthe concept of consent.\n\n34\n00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.500\nYou've heard me,\nespecially in the first episode,\n\n35\n00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.550\nwhere we just talked at a very broad,\nhigh level about some themes.\n\n36\n00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.970\nWe talked about the need to not only\ngather data in an appropriate way,\n\n37\n00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.000\nand to manage that data in\nan appropriate risk adverse way.\n\n38\n00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.600\nBut also to ensure that the data subject,\n\n39\n00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.360\nthe person who is going to be providing\nthe personally identifiable information.\n\n40\n00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.140\nThe data owner, in other words,\nsaid their consent is given along the way.\n\n41\n00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.640\nYou can't just decide you're gonna go and\n\n42\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.290\ngather data secretly\nsurreptitiously on somebody.\n\n43\n00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.650\nYou have to have their permission.\n\n44\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.981\nYou could, but that's illegal typically.\n\n45\n00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:08.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n46\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.440\nI mean not saying you couldn't do it.\n\n47\n00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.345\nPeople do it all the time.\n\n48\n00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:12.460\nThat's why identity theft is\nthe number one crime in the world.\n\n49\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.760\nBut having said that, right?\n\n50\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.630\nIt is appropriate, and indeed,\nit is accepted as well as expected that\n\n51\n00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.270\nyou would have the consent of the party,\nin order to not just gather their data,\n\n52\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.600\ncuz listen, we gather data all\nthe time without people's consent.\n\n53\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.190\nBut to hold it, to manage it, to use it\nunderneath the framework of the GDPR,\n\n54\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.040\nwe need the consent of the data\nsubject in order to do that.\n\n55\n00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.200\nSo consent, a basis for legal processing\nalong with legitimate interests,\n\n56\n00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.890\nnecessary execution of the contract,\nthings like that.\n\n57\n00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.530\nAccording to the regulation consent means,\nagain and\n\n58\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.140\nI am quoting now, right,\nyou're falling down on the job there,\n\n59\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.100\nI'm quoting,\nany freely given specific language.\n\n60\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.530\nAny freely given, specific informed and\nunambiguous indication of his or her,\n\n61\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.260\nmeaning the data subjects, wishes by which\nthe data subject, either by a statement or\n\n62\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.950\nby a clear affirmative action,\nclear affirmative action,\n\n63\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.970\nsignifies agreement to personal data\nrelating to them being processed.\n\n64\n00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.480\nQuoting language specific from the GDPR.\n\n65\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.550\nIn other words,\ntwo things we take away from this.\n\n66\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.300\nIt is not enough to merely have\nthe data without the consent.\n\n67\n00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.620\nAs a matter of fact, it is not acceptable\nto have the data without the consent.\n\n68\n00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.240\nBut the consent must come from\nthe data subject clearly,\n\n69\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.170\nunambiguously, and\nin an affirmative manner.\n\n70\n00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.070\nMeaning, I must opt in through action,\nword, and deed and\n\n71\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.610\nnot because you prefilled a box\non a form that says yes, and\n\n72\n00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.490\nyou accept these terms and expect me to\ngo uncheck the box or do something else.\n\n73\n00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.590\nOr, through inactivity, you make\nthe assumption that I'm opting in, no,\n\n74\n00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.740\nnot acceptable, not allowed, come back and\n\n75\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.160\nplay again when you get your head screwed\non the right way and understand the logic.\n\n76\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.274\nThat is expressly forbidden,\nas a matter of fact, under the GDPR.\n\n77\n00:04:05.274 --> 00:04:10.428\nWe're moving away, in other words,\nfrom these games and shenanigans that\n\n78\n00:04:10.428 --> 00:04:15.503\nentities have played up until now,\nwhere they've claimed that consent,\n\n79\n00:04:15.503 --> 00:04:20.272\nand they've claimed that affirmation\nis accepted because of opt in.\n\n80\n00:04:20.272 --> 00:04:25.147\nAnd opt in was, we pre filled the box and\nyou didn't realize that so you said,\n\n81\n00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:27.407\nokay, and that meant you opted in.\n\n82\n00:04:27.407 --> 00:04:29.767\nNo, if I don't say okay and\n\n83\n00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:34.917\nyou don't have me recorded doing that,\nyou don't have a video of me signing that,\n\n84\n00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:38.677\nyou don't have my signature, you don't\nhave an action where I have to fill in.\n\n85\n00:04:38.677 --> 00:04:42.739\nAnd let me be clear, unchecking the box,\npresenting me an empty form and\n\n86\n00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:47.400\nhaving me check the box that says, yes,\nI accept these terms and, by the way,\n\n87\n00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.082\nI consent is perfectly fine.\n\n88\n00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:53.679\nWe're not saying you can't do those\nthings, we're just saying you have to do\n\n89\n00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:58.417\nthem in a way that gives the data subject\nthe ability and the need to positively and\n\n90\n00:04:58.417 --> 00:05:02.650\naffirmatively act in a way\nthat will show I'm consenting.\n\n91\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.010\nThat's a very important thought process,\nvery important distinction.\n\n92\n00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\nthat word explicit can send, right?\n\n93\n00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.048\n&gt;&gt; On clear, affirmative action.\n\n94\n00:05:10.048 --> 00:05:11.673\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; Is what the actual language says.\n\n95\n00:05:11.673 --> 00:05:12.275\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n96\n00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:13.802\n&gt;&gt; But yes, we could read it that way and\n\n97\n00:05:13.802 --> 00:05:14.584\nsay that, but-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n98\n00:05:14.584 --> 00:05:15.400\nthat's nice-\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n99\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.830\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you've seen those forms where\nthe box is already checked and\n\n100\n00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.275\nif you're not paying attention-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n101\n00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:22.250\n&gt;&gt; Which, I'm pretty good at doing.\n\n102\n00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.320\nBut I see people all the time.\n\n103\n00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.040\nNext, next, next, okay.\n\n104\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.490\nAnd who knows what they've just agreed to?\n\n105\n00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.580\nAnd it wasn't explicit.\n\n106\n00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, correct.\n\n107\n00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.180\nAnd to follow on that point cuz\nthat's an excellent point you raise.\n\n108\n00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.010\nThe purposes for\nwhich the consent is gained, right?\n\n109\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.830\nDoes need to be, again,\nquoting here, right.\n\n110\n00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.780\nDoes need to be collected for\n\n111\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.460\nspecified, explicit, there's where the\nword comes in, and legitimate purposes.\n\n112\n00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.490\nIn other words, right, you have to not\njust get the consent of the data subject,\n\n113\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.910\nbut they have to consent to something that\nthey understand and that they agree to.\n\n114\n00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.330\nNot a broad blanket,\nwe're taking all you're data and\n\n115\n00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.645\nwhatever we do with it will be ok, right?\n\n116\n00:06:00.645 --> 00:06:01.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n117\n00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.950\nWe're taking all your data, and\nwe're gonna use it these five ways.\n\n118\n00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.096\nAnd explicitly tell me\nwhat you are doing and\n\n119\n00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:11.926\nif it's not on that list that I consent,\nguess what you broke the law, right.\n\n120\n00:06:11.926 --> 00:06:15.548\nGet out your checkbook because\nit must be specific and\n\n121\n00:06:15.548 --> 00:06:20.379\nthe user of the data subject must\nunderstand what they are consenting to\n\n122\n00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:25.590\nwhen they give consent explicitly\nthrough their action, word or deed.\n\n123\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.580\nOtherwise, there's disconnect and\nwe're not doing this the right way.\n\n124\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.350\nBecause again, what you often see is\na blanket consent without specifity and\n\n125\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.220\nas a result, our data gets used in all\nsorts of ways we never understood or\n\n126\n00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.470\nopted in to.\n\n127\n00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.780\nOr it was so obtuse and\nthe obfuscation and the legalese and\n\n128\n00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.590\nthe terms of service was so\ndifficult that nobody could\n\n129\n00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.850\nrealistically be expected to understand\nwhat they were saying yes to, right.\n\n130\n00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.900\nAnd that is unfortunately been the case.\n\n131\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And so we're really\n\n132\n00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.330\ntrying to clean that up, clarify that and\nget rid of that behavior.\n\n133\n00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.380\nSo the idea is that it must be obvious\nat the point of data collection\n\n134\n00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.490\nas to what we are doing.\n\n135\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.876\nYou can't tack it on later and tell me\nthat now there is a requirement that\n\n136\n00:07:05.876 --> 00:07:10.200\nsays or rather an allowance that says,\nhey, we could change the needs, right?\n\n137\n00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.960\nWe may say, hey,\nin addition we need something else.\n\n138\n00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.160\nWell, we gotta go back and reconsent\nthe data subject and reinform them.\n\n139\n00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.270\nAnd if they opt out, remember,\nwe have a right to be forgotten, right?\n\n140\n00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.505\nIf they opt out,\nthen that data is no longer useable.\n\n141\n00:07:24.505 --> 00:07:27.725\nSo it is important, because now we\nhave this requirement to refresh and\n\n142\n00:07:27.725 --> 00:07:30.565\nupdate, when services or needs change, and\n\n143\n00:07:30.565 --> 00:07:33.565\nto re-opt the data subject,\nin order to do that.\n\n144\n00:07:33.565 --> 00:07:36.005\nConsent should be demonstrable,\nas I talked about, right?\n\n145\n00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:39.535\nWe need to be able to show\nclearly how consent was gained,\n\n146\n00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:41.685\nas the organization gathering the data.\n\n147\n00:07:41.685 --> 00:07:43.185\nConsent must be freely given,\n\n148\n00:07:43.185 --> 00:07:47.500\nno coercion on the part of\nthe organization against the data subject.\n\n149\n00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.451\nOffering chocolate is\nprobably still acceptable.\n\n150\n00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:52.477\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But no coercion of any kind, right?\n\n151\n00:07:52.477 --> 00:07:56.660\nSo in other words,\nyou can't insist that they opt in and\n\n152\n00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.940\ngive consent in order to be\na prerequisite of something.\n\n153\n00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.435\nAnd, hey, if you don't do this, wow, we're\ngonna Kill all of your other accounts and\n\n154\n00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:05.061\nget rid of you.\n\n155\n00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:07.285\nNo, this is something that you\ncan't coerce someone into.\n\n156\n00:08:07.285 --> 00:08:09.030\nSo it has to be freely given.\n\n157\n00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.220\nWithdrawing consent should\nalways be possible, right?\n\n158\n00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.170\nIn other words,\nyou should make it as easy for\n\n159\n00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.795\nthe data subject to withdraw their\nconsent as it was for them to opt in.\n\n160\n00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:19.925\nBecause again,\nwhat often happens is you opt in and\n\n161\n00:08:19.925 --> 00:08:24.405\nthen try to get a company to forget about\nyou or take you off that mailing list.\n\n162\n00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:25.395\nYeah, good luck, right?\n\n163\n00:08:25.395 --> 00:08:26.425\nI mean, that's never happening.\n\n164\n00:08:26.425 --> 00:08:30.435\nYou might as well change your name,\ncuz it'll be a lot easier, right?\n\n165\n00:08:30.435 --> 00:08:34.710\nSo the problem becomes that it's easy to\nget in, it's impossible to get out today.\n\n166\n00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:35.440\nIt is.\n\n167\n00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.410\nWe're leveling the playing field.\n\n168\n00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:39.500\nThe GDPR says look, you make it easy for\nthem to consent and\n\n169\n00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.860\nyou better make it easy for\nthem to opt out.\n\n170\n00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.610\nBecause they may want to do that and\nwhen they do, it better be as easy for\n\n171\n00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.280\nthem to do that- them being\nthe data subject, the customer,\n\n172\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.090\nwho owns the data- as it was for\nthem to opt in.\n\n173\n00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.490\nOr you're out of business, because you're\nobviously not operating the right way.\n\n174\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.850\nInformation provided at data collection\nmust be made freely available to the data\n\n175\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.420\nsubject when they are in need to see it.\n\n176\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.430\nSo, in other words,\nwe have to understand as data subjects\n\n177\n00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.010\nthat we not only have the right\nto opt in and opt out.\n\n178\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.135\nBut we have the right to understand what\ndata has been collected about us and\n\n179\n00:09:15.135 --> 00:09:18.678\nwhether there is integrity, whether there\nis accuracy associated with that data.\n\n180\n00:09:18.678 --> 00:09:22.250\nThe identity and the contact details\nof the controller and the DPO,\n\n181\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.340\nthe data protection officer,\nshould be made available.\n\n182\n00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.660\nSo the data protection\nofficer has to be registered.\n\n183\n00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.780\nWe, as the consumer, as the data subject,\nshould be able to contact.\n\n184\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.330\nRemember, they become\nthe point of contact,\n\n185\n00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.800\nas we talked about, for any grievances or\nconcerns that we may have.\n\n186\n00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.310\nWe should be able to freely and\neasily understand who they are and\n\n187\n00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.140\nbe in touch with them if necessary.\n\n188\n00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.690\nOf the purposes of the process in\nwhich personal data Is intended.\n\n189\n00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.990\nAgain that should have been\npart of the opt-in clause, but\n\n190\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.960\nwe should be able to be reminded\nof that at any point in time.\n\n191\n00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.850\nThe legal basis of the processing,\n\n192\n00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.980\nunder what law requirements are they\ngathering and processing the data.\n\n193\n00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.590\nWhere applicable, legal interest or\n\n194\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.270\nlegitimate interest pursued\nby the controller or\n\n195\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.170\nthe third party acting as the processor\nthat they have handed of to?\n\n196\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.510\nWhere applicable, recipients or\ncategories of recipients of this data.\n\n197\n00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.290\nAgain, who's gonna get my data?\n\n198\n00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.250\nWells Fargo, Citibank got it initially but\nwho are they sharing with, right?\n\n199\n00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.220\nI wanna know,\nthey're giving it to a mortgage company.\n\n200\n00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.280\nThey're giving it to\na financial services firm.\n\n201\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.310\nThey're giving it to an insurance\ncompany owned by them as a subsidiary or\n\n202\n00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.380\nthrough some sort of\ncontractual arrangement.\n\n203\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.750\nAnd I wanna know that, and I'm entitled\nto know that as the data subject.\n\n204\n00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.159\nAgain, I'm thinking about picking up and\nmoving to-\n\n205\n00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:33.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.980\n&gt;&gt; I'm going over there.\n\n207\n00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.840\nI'm-\n&gt;&gt; I'm sitting here the whole time\n\n208\n00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.700\nthinking, when are we getting this and\nif not, why, and what can I do about it?\n\n209\n00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.803\n&gt;&gt; Not with the political circus going\non right now, I can tell you that.\n\n210\n00:10:42.803 --> 00:10:43.372\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n211\n00:10:43.372 --> 00:10:46.630\nthe reality is the protections afforded,\nand I made this clear in the first\n\n212\n00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.900\nepisode, and I've said this in one form or\nanother in every episode so far.\n\n213\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:55.435\nThe protections afforded under\nthe EU's multigenerational,\n\n214\n00:10:55.435 --> 00:11:00.430\nmulti-decade-long march towards protection\nof the rights of the individual\n\n215\n00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:04.060\nin all the forms that they've taken up\nuntil now and including, and going forward\n\n216\n00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:09.020\nthrough the GDPR, are very far ahead\nin almost every case without exception.\n\n217\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.560\nVery far ahead of almost\nevery other area and\n\n218\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.960\ncountry's pursuit of this in those areas.\n\n219\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.790\nI mean this is really the gold standard.\n\n220\n00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.010\nWe don't often get to say that and\nreally mean it.\n\n221\n00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.260\nBut, these sets of rules and\n\n222\n00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.360\nlaws really set a bar that is not\nmatched anywhere in the world today.\n\n223\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.355\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; And that is important to know, right?\n\n224\n00:11:25.355 --> 00:11:29.730\nWhere applicable, if we do plan on\ntransferring data as the data control,\n\n225\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.280\nwe have to make the subject aware of that,\nas well.\n\n226\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.540\nThe period for\nwhich personal data will be stored.\n\n227\n00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.610\nOr if we can't definitively say that,\nthe criteria used to determine the period.\n\n228\n00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.070\nSo in other words, we may not be able\nto say definitively seven years,\n\n229\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.740\nbecause of tax requirements\nto keep business records.\n\n230\n00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.770\nSo we can say that, for\ninstance, in the US.\n\n231\n00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.680\nWe have a law, federal law in the US\nthat says, records, business-related\n\n232\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.770\nrecords must be kept for seven years\nafter tax filing on a rolling basis.\n\n233\n00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.580\nAt the end of seven years\nthey can be destroyed.\n\n234\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.191\nGermany has ten years, for instance.\n\n235\n00:11:58.191 --> 00:12:00.085\nIt varies by country.\n\n236\n00:12:00.085 --> 00:12:03.033\nSo we could say that under this law,\nor we could say,\n\n237\n00:12:03.033 --> 00:12:05.890\nwe're not sure of the data\nretention period.\n\n238\n00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.359\nIt will be based on the current laws in\nplace within the country of operation,\n\n239\n00:12:10.359 --> 00:12:11.611\nbecause it may vary.\n\n240\n00:12:11.611 --> 00:12:16.010\nWe're a global company and every country\nmay have different requirements.\n\n241\n00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.730\nIt will vary by country but we will adhere\nto whatever the requirements are based on\n\n242\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:24.330\nthe legality of operation or the feeder\nof operation, something to that effect.\n\n243\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.330\nAnd that would satisfy.\n\n244\n00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.550\nThat would be appropriate.\n\n245\n00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.490\nSo we do have an opt-in,\n\n246\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.330\nin that respect there,\nto be a little bit on the side of hedging.\n\n247\n00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.730\nNot because we purposely want to obfuscate\nthis information from the data subject,\n\n248\n00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.190\nbut rather, to make it easy for businesses\nto understand how to comply without being,\n\n249\n00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.780\nyou know producing a volume of\nregulatory explanation that's 1,000\n\n250\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.010\npages that nobody's\ngonna understand anyway.\n\n251\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.100\nYou mean, I'm in Uzbekistan.\n\n252\n00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.630\nLet me look that up in\ntable five in the back,\n\n253\n00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.888\nand let me see in five point\ntext what that looks like.\n\n254\n00:12:52.888 --> 00:12:54.613\nThat just doesn't work, right?\n\n255\n00:12:54.613 --> 00:12:58.030\nWe have to obviously make this\nburden realistic for both parties.\n\n256\n00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.230\nIt's kind of what the balancing\nthought process is.\n\n257\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.410\nIf possible, obviously, as we said,\n\n258\n00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.520\nfiguring out what the criteria would\nbe as opposed to the actual statement.\n\n259\n00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.900\nThe existence of the right to access,\nrectify, erase personal data.\n\n260\n00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.530\nI talked about this, very important.\n\n261\n00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.500\nThe right to data portability,\nthe right to withdraw consent,\n\n262\n00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.490\nas I suggested, at any time.\n\n263\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.680\nAnd the right to complain with a\nsupervisory authority, if something is not\n\n264\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.470\nright, and that proper channels have been\nfollowed but you have had no redress.\n\n265\n00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.279\nMeaning, you have the right and\nthe responsibility,\n\n266\n00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:28.660\nas a data subject,\nto maintain the integrity of your data.\n\n267\n00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.140\nAnd if the company doesn't do that,\nyou can call them on it.\n\n268\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.610\nAnd you can find out if that's the case.\n\n269\n00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.270\nYou can ask them to address it.\n\n270\n00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.320\nAnd they have a legal\nresponsibility to do so.\n\n271\n00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.160\nAnd there's a framework set up for that.\n\n272\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.490\nWe'll get into that in more detail\nas we talk about the eight specific\n\n273\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.390\nrights created for\nindividuals under the GDPR,\n\n274\n00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.110\nand examine each of them\nin upcoming conversations.\n\n275\n00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.210\nBut you have a right to do that.\n\n276\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.620\nThe company also has responsibilities and\nrights in that regard.\n\n277\n00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.490\nThey have 30 days on average, one month,\nto respond to a normal request.\n\n278\n00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.810\nNothing out of the ordinary.\n\n279\n00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.730\nIf it's a more complex request, they can\nextend that and say, you know, look,\n\n280\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.060\nwe need more time.\n\n281\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.350\nHere's notification\nthat we need more time.\n\n282\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.910\nAnd we can get up to another\ntwo months to deal with that.\n\n283\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.540\nBut then they have to respond.\n\n284\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.420\nUnder certain circumstances, they can\nactually choose to ignore that request.\n\n285\n00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.600\nI'm not saying that that would always\nbe appropriate, quite the opposite.\n\n286\n00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.050\nBut there are certain categories\nof requests where they actually,\n\n287\n00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.900\nas the processor and the controller,\nhave the legal right under the GDPR to\n\n288\n00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.200\nessentially ignore that request and\nsay, sorry we're not complying.\n\n289\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.040\nThey have to produce documentation to that\neffect if they're called up on a complaint\n\n290\n00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.670\nbefore the Supervisory Authority\nlike I'm suggesting,\n\n291\n00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.660\nbecause they could decide to ignore you,\nthat doesn't mean they're right.\n\n292\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.300\nAnd you could be pissed off\nat that they're ignoring you,\n\n293\n00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.460\nthat doesn't mean you're right.\n\n294\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.940\nAnd somebody who is impartial\nhas to decide that.\n\n295\n00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.340\nThat's what the supervisory\nauthority is for.\n\n296\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.740\nSo you have the ability\nto go escalate this and\n\n297\n00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.680\ncomplain to an impartial third party.\n\n298\n00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:56.270\nAnd then based on the circumstances and\nthe applicability of the GDPR regulations,\n\n299\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.280\nyou may or may not have the ability\nto get some sort of satisfaction.\n\n300\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.940\nBut very clear, and\nwe'll talk more about this later,\n\n301\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.490\nthere are specifically carved out\ncategories where the controller and\n\n302\n00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:10.000\nprocessor have the legal\nright to ignore a request.\n\n303\n00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.910\nAnd they can go to\nthe supervisory authority,\n\n304\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.540\nproduce documentation to that effect,\nand essentially be told,\n\n305\n00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.900\nit's okay, forget about it,\nyou don't have to respond.\n\n306\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.420\nBut under most circumstances,\n\n307\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.300\nthey have a legal requirement\nto respond in a timely fashion.\n\n308\n00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.740\nThat is the language used.\n\n309\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.570\nAnd a timely fashion is\ndefined as one month.\n\n310\n00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.670\nAnd then there's an extension period based\non complexity of request, including,\n\n311\n00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.410\nby the way,\ncomplexity is defined as many things.\n\n312\n00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.690\nBut repetition of the request\nis also considered complexity.\n\n313\n00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.630\nMeaning hey,\nthey didn't do it the first time,\n\n314\n00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.150\nlet me go slam them with\nfive other requests.\n\n315\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.890\nThat then becomes a more complex issue and\nthey can actually ask for\n\n316\n00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:46.990\nmore time to deal with it.\n\n317\n00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.920\nAnd make it to the point where under\nthe nuisance thought process they may\n\n318\n00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.970\nbe able to ignore it.\n\n319\n00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.530\nSo you have to understand\nwhere you stand here,\n\n320\n00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.183\nboth as the data subject as well as\nas a controller and or processor.\n\n321\n00:15:57.183 --> 00:15:58.373\nIt's very important to know that.\n\n322\n00:15:58.373 --> 00:16:02.691\nWhere the data's not been obtained\ndirectly from the data subject But rather,\n\n323\n00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:04.503\nmaybe from a third party entity.\n\n324\n00:16:04.503 --> 00:16:07.127\nSo if I come to you and\nI collect your data directly,\n\n325\n00:16:07.127 --> 00:16:11.218\nthere's a different set of rules and\nexpectations involved where I'm dealing\n\n326\n00:16:11.218 --> 00:16:14.160\nwith you as the processor\ndirectly as a data subject.\n\n327\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.035\nThan if I I inherit your\ndata from somewhere else and\n\n328\n00:16:17.035 --> 00:16:18.565\nI never talk to you directly.\n\n329\n00:16:18.565 --> 00:16:20.140\nI'm just getting it,\nthe company passed it to company B.\n\n330\n00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n331\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.545\n&gt;&gt; Or essentially, right?\n\n332\n00:16:22.545 --> 00:16:26.345\nSo then we have to understand and\nbe told, where we got the data,\n\n333\n00:16:26.345 --> 00:16:27.320\nwhere did it come from.\n\n334\n00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.242\nSo you have to tell me as a company\nthat I never talked to you,\n\n335\n00:16:30.242 --> 00:16:31.592\nhey how'd you get my phone number?\n\n336\n00:16:31.592 --> 00:16:33.052\nWho are you, why are you talking to me?\n\n337\n00:16:33.052 --> 00:16:34.692\nI got this from company x.\n\n338\n00:16:34.692 --> 00:16:39.102\nYou gave them your data and you gave them\nthe right to give it to a partner for\n\n339\n00:16:39.102 --> 00:16:40.172\nwhatever reasons.\n\n340\n00:16:40.172 --> 00:16:41.266\nThat's where I'm getting it from.\n\n341\n00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.926\nThey have to be able to tell you that.\n\n342\n00:16:42.926 --> 00:16:45.476\nAlso, the existence of any profiling and\n\n343\n00:16:47.676 --> 00:16:51.136\nmeaningful information and\nlogic about the information.\n\n344\n00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:52.536\nMeaning, essentially metadata, right?\n\n345\n00:16:52.536 --> 00:16:54.276\nSo we have to make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n346\n00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.740\nAnd that we do understand\nthat there may be times,\n\n347\n00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.030\nwhere there's other data that's\nbeen gathered and/or created.\n\n348\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.900\nAnd we have an ability to see and\nunderstand that as well.\n\n349\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.960\nThere are exceptions as I suggested\nwhere effort would be considered to be\n\n350\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.690\ndisproportionate and where\nthe information has already been provided\n\n351\n00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.530\nto the data subject,\nwe don't have this responsibility.\n\n352\n00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.810\nSo if this is something\nwe've already done for\n\n353\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.030\nyou, then we may not have to do it again.\n\n354\n00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.742\nIf the effort to do so\nis disproportionately large,\n\n355\n00:17:21.742 --> 00:17:24.960\ndefined disproportionately large,\nit's a sliding scale.\n\n356\n00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.600\nThere is no clear definition that\nif it took this amount of time,\n\n357\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.880\nit would be acceptable, but if it took\nthat amount of time, it would not.\n\n358\n00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.250\nAgain, a lot of this is vague.\n\n359\n00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.080\nI mean this is how laws are written,\nright?\n\n360\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.602\nThey're not step-by-step process\ncookbooks that tell you what to do.\n\n361\n00:17:37.602 --> 00:17:41.989\nThey're high level statements of intent\nthat direct us towards some sort of lofty,\n\n362\n00:17:41.989 --> 00:17:45.860\nand usually more often than not,\nhopefully important common goals.\n\n363\n00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.550\nAnd the implementation details\nare often dealt with separately, right?\n\n364\n00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.040\nThat's where we get into other things.\n\n365\n00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.610\nSo we just gotta understand,\n\n366\n00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.360\nthat when we say something\nlike disproportionate effort,\n\n367\n00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.340\nit's hard to say for sure what that\nwould really be categorized as, right?\n\n368\n00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.070\nBut we do know that there is\nsome language to that effect.\n\n369\n00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.660\nI just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n370\n00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.780\nWhat about profiling, right?\n\n371\n00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.820\nWe talked about consent, but the profiling\nis also called out and part of this.\n\n372\n00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.888\nAny automated processing of personal\ndata to determine certain criteria about\n\n373\n00:18:14.888 --> 00:18:17.250\na person is considered to be profiling.\n\n374\n00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.120\nQuoting, again quoting, right?\n\n375\n00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:24.430\nIn particular to analyze or predict\naspects concerning the natural persons\n\n376\n00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:29.525\nperformance at work, economic situation,\nhealth, personal preferences, interest,\n\n377\n00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:33.000\nreliability behavior,\nlocation or movements.\n\n378\n00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.640\nAny of that falls under the guise of and\ncategorized as profiling.\n\n379\n00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.100\nSo we just wanna make sure that\nwe're thinking about that.\n\n380\n00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.170\nIndividuals have the right not\nto be subject to the results\n\n381\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.460\nof automated decision making.\n\n382\n00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.760\nThat's one of the eight guaranteed rights\nunder the GDPR, including profiling.\n\n383\n00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.569\nSo essentially we can opt out, right?\n\n384\n00:18:50.569 --> 00:18:53.540\nWe do have the right as\na data subject to opt out.\n\n385\n00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.750\nAnd so we do need to be aware of that.\n\n386\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:55.770\nAgain, it's one of those eight rights.\n\n387\n00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.110\nWe'll talk more about those\nin upcoming conversations.\n\n388\n00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:02.686\nBut automated decision making can get\na company into trouble because they don't\n\n389\n00:19:02.686 --> 00:19:04.780\nhave the consent of the individual.\n\n390\n00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.587\nThey may not be able to use the data or\ntake those actions if they can not be\n\n391\n00:19:08.587 --> 00:19:12.610\nproven to have been derived from\nsome sort of consensual activity.\n\n392\n00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:17.460\nSo for instance here, just hypothetically,\nthink about how for instance today,\n\n393\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:22.920\nloans are gonna be granted or\ndenied at least in the United States and\n\n394\n00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.610\nmany other countries around the world\nbased on the variety of factors.\n\n395\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.340\nCredit rating, credit worthiness,\nyour ability to repay the loan,\n\n396\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.660\ncollateral you may be able to provide,\nall these things, right?\n\n397\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.360\nYou'll have your paid loans off in\nthe past, by the time you get a loan,\n\n398\n00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.530\nhave you essentially welched on it and\nnever paid it back.\n\n399\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.560\nSo but\nthere's a lot of automatic profile and\n\n400\n00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.930\ndecision making that goes into this,\nright?\n\n401\n00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.990\nNow it would still be legal to do all\nthis as a company as long as the data\n\n402\n00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.890\nyou're using has been consented\nto by the data subject upfront.\n\n403\n00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.940\nMeaning, hey, I consented for\nyou to have access to my bank records.\n\n404\n00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:58.000\nI consented for\nyou to keep track of my payment history\n\n405\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.640\nby agreeing to the terms of\nservice to use a credit card, and\n\n406\n00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.270\npaying back my car loan, and\nwhatever else you can think of.\n\n407\n00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.823\nAnd so as a result, we can then take that\ndata, run it through an algorithm or\n\n408\n00:20:07.823 --> 00:20:10.829\nwhatever magic we use behind the scenes,\nright?\n\n409\n00:20:10.829 --> 00:20:12.553\nLittle guys in room with darts\nthrowing stuff at a wall.\n\n410\n00:20:12.553 --> 00:20:13.963\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it may be.\n\n411\n00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:17.526\nAnd as a result, you know we can then\nderive, ding, ding, ding, right,\n\n412\n00:20:17.526 --> 00:20:21.225\nan answer that says yes, give Mike this\nmoney, or what, are you kidding me?\n\n413\n00:20:21.225 --> 00:20:23.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You never give him anything, right?\n\n414\n00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.950\nAnd we can do that because we have\nconsent for the use of that data.\n\n415\n00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:31.060\nBut if we don't have consent for\nall that, then it's no longer allowed.\n\n416\n00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:36.060\nSo there's a lot of subtle interpretation\nthat has to go on here because we have to\n\n417\n00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:41.270\nunderstand what automatic decision making\nand profiling may or not be classified as.\n\n418\n00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.440\nAnd that may not be very easy.\n\n419\n00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.710\nWe do have to also understand that\nmember states do have the ability\n\n420\n00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:53.360\nto potentially allow things like\nprofiling on an as needed per case basis.\n\n421\n00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.470\nSo the law may say hey no,\nbut then France may say,\n\n422\n00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.540\nno we're gonna do profiling\nunder these conditions.\n\n423\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.260\nAnd they have the right as\na member state to go out and\n\n424\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.170\ncarve out some exceptions\nin certain areas.\n\n425\n00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.510\nSo that also may happen and\nthat may be part of what goes on.\n\n426\n00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.210\nSo we just have to think about that.\n\n427\n00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.020\nThings like direct marketing and\nlegitimate interest have to be considered.\n\n428\n00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:17.740\nWe do recognize that the processing\nof data for direct marketing purposes\n\n429\n00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.490\nis considered to be a legitimate interest,\nsince I was hinting at it, suggesting.\n\n430\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.320\nWe're not trying to shoot business in\nthe foot and say you can't market,\n\n431\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.270\nyou can't do anything.\n\n432\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.720\nWe're just try to constrain activities so\nthat they happen in a way\n\n433\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.552\nthat is informed, consensual, and\ntherefore fair for both parties.\n\n434\n00:21:32.552 --> 00:21:34.665\nSo that's part of what\nwe think about here and\n\n435\n00:21:34.665 --> 00:21:36.845\nlegitimate interest is one\nof the grounds for consent.\n\n436\n00:21:36.845 --> 00:21:38.845\nMeaning company markets to you and\n\n437\n00:21:38.845 --> 00:21:42.355\nyou consent to the use of your\ndata under that particular guise.\n\n438\n00:21:42.355 --> 00:21:45.075\nThen essentially,\nthey're allowed to do these things,\n\n439\n00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:47.605\nbecause they've asked you and\nyou said yes.\n\n440\n00:21:47.605 --> 00:21:51.945\nBut if they send you an email or\nin the mail, hard mail,\n\n441\n00:21:51.945 --> 00:21:54.365\nsnail mail,\nthey send you a flyer or whatever.\n\n442\n00:21:54.365 --> 00:21:56.395\nAnd you call the phone number or\nyou go the website,\n\n443\n00:21:56.395 --> 00:22:00.090\nyou opt in,\nthen you can't blame them, right?\n\n444\n00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.770\nYou made an informed decision.\n\n445\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.840\nSo you gotta think about that,\nand just understand that.\n\n446\n00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.920\nBecause that is, again, as long as\nthey apply the principles of fair and\n\n447\n00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.870\nlawful data collection and\nprocessing and protection,\n\n448\n00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:15.090\nas defined under the GDPR, the business\nis operating according to the rules, and\n\n449\n00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.110\nthey are lawful, and\nthey are doing the right things.\n\n450\n00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.120\nso we do need and\n\n451\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.880\nspecifically define lawful processing as\nbeing criteria but that would be accepted.\n\n452\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.130\nNow, also keep in mind, there are some\noverrides for that as I suggested.\n\n453\n00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.030\nOne of them is this area of\ncollecting data on children,\n\n454\n00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.683\nwhich is a big area, big concern\naround the world without exception.\n\n455\n00:22:34.683 --> 00:22:37.776\nAnd so, we do need to be aware of that,\nbecause again, and\n\n456\n00:22:37.776 --> 00:22:42.199\nquoting the exact language, the access\nthat the process is considered lawful if,\n\n457\n00:22:42.199 --> 00:22:44.052\nquoting here, right, quoting.\n\n458\n00:22:44.052 --> 00:22:45.062\nWe need a light or something.\n\n459\n00:22:45.062 --> 00:22:46.628\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There has to\n\n460\n00:22:46.628 --> 00:22:49.285\nbe something over here that just comes\non that says, Adam is now quoting.\n\n461\n00:22:49.285 --> 00:22:51.438\nLike big flashing neon sign,\nsomething, work on that.\n\n462\n00:22:51.438 --> 00:22:52.405\n&gt;&gt; We'll get there.\n\n463\n00:22:52.405 --> 00:22:53.115\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n\n464\n00:22:53.115 --> 00:22:55.710\nAll right, so the access,\nrecording that, right?\n\n465\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:00.510\nProcessing is lawful if processing is\nnecessary for the purposes of legitimate\n\n466\n00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:04.010\ninterest pursued by the controller or by\na third party, we just established that.\n\n467\n00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.740\nExcept this is the part\nthat I was talking about,\n\n468\n00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.025\nexcept where such interests are overridden\nby the interests or fundamental rights and\n\n469\n00:23:10.025 --> 00:23:12.085\nfreedoms of the data subject.\n\n470\n00:23:12.085 --> 00:23:14.235\nWhich require protection of personal data,\n\n471\n00:23:14.235 --> 00:23:18.035\nin particular where the data subject\nis a child, as I was just suggesting.\n\n472\n00:23:18.035 --> 00:23:22.695\nSo, there are cases where, when we collect\ncertain kinds of data from certain\n\n473\n00:23:22.695 --> 00:23:27.005\ncategories that are protected individuals,\nthen the same rules may not apply.\n\n474\n00:23:27.005 --> 00:23:29.690\nChildren are definitely\na defined protected category.\n\n475\n00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.270\nAnd when we market to them, when we\ndeal with them, let's say, online for\n\n476\n00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:37.410\nonline services which, let's face it,\nlike it or not, is a reality today, right?\n\n477\n00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:42.480\nWe have to understand that there has to\nbe a minimum acceptable age for opt in.\n\n478\n00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.700\nCurrently, that age is\ndefined as being 16 or\n\n479\n00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.860\nolder, although there is the opportunity\nfor member states to go down\n\n480\n00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.430\nthrough their own overrides,\nas I suggested, to as low as 13.\n\n481\n00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.573\nSo a member state can opt out and\nsay, hey, we understand the bar and\n\n482\n00:23:56.573 --> 00:24:00.662\nGDPR is 16, but we're gonna say\nthat it's 13 in our country.\n\n483\n00:24:00.662 --> 00:24:04.311\nAnd they're allowed to do that as long as\nthey pass an exception legally through\n\n484\n00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:07.180\ntheir legislative process and\ndeclare that formally.\n\n485\n00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.501\nBut it cannot go below 13\naccording to the GDPR,\n\n486\n00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:12.833\nmeaning that if they wanna opt out of 16,\nthey can't say it's 12.\n\n487\n00:24:12.833 --> 00:24:16.881\nThat would be against EU law and\nthey would be not able to do that, but\n\n488\n00:24:16.881 --> 00:24:18.599\nthey can go down as low 13.\n\n489\n00:24:18.599 --> 00:24:23.040\nBut it has to be, unless they\ncreate an exception, 16 or older.\n\n490\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.090\nIf it's below 16, with no exception,\nthen a parent must opt in a consent for\n\n491\n00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:31.550\nthem, or the company cannot collect,\nhold, and use data on children.\n\n492\n00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.910\nWhich, again, is a a very very strong and\n\n493\n00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:37.610\nvery good protection that we don't\nnecessarily see in other countries, or\n\n494\n00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:39.720\nat least is not well\ndefined in other countries.\n\n495\n00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.492\nSo we just wanna make sure we're\naware of that, because that, again,\n\n496\n00:24:42.492 --> 00:24:44.726\nis one of those things that\nis pretty important, right?\n\n497\n00:24:44.726 --> 00:24:45.652\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n498\n00:24:45.652 --> 00:24:49.891\n&gt;&gt; I mean it is a huge, huge category that\nunfortunately has not been dealt with as\n\n499\n00:24:49.891 --> 00:24:53.889\nwell and as forthrightly as it should\nbe in many, many areas of the world.\n\n500\n00:24:53.889 --> 00:24:56.726\nAnd we've seen the horrible outcomes and\nresults of all sorts of behavior,\n\n501\n00:24:56.726 --> 00:24:57.490\nas a result of that.\n\n502\n00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.740\nSo that is encouraging,\nvery, very encouraging.\n\n503\n00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.500\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n504\n00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.780\nAll right, again,\ngreat information there, Adam.\n\n505\n00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.950\nReally getting a good look\nat what makes up the GDPR.\n\n506\n00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.410\nAs we said, we're doing our overview,\nwe're gonna get back and\n\n507\n00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.800\ndive into some more specifics as we go.\n\n508\n00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.660\nBut we thank you for\nyour time, your information.\n\n509\n00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.030\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n510\n00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.940\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n511\n00:25:18.940 -->

00:00:08.426\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:12.490\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.819\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:17.145\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\n\n7\n00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:20.720\ntoday we're discussing\nthe General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n8\n00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.970\nAnd here to continue on our\noverview of the regulation is Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.230\nAdam Gordon, welcome, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.370\n&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody, glad to be back,\n\n11\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.660\nI thought we would start our discussions\nrather, continue I was gonna say.\n\n12\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.445\nBut start or continue, essentially\nthe same thing, we're gonna do this,\n\n13\n00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:35.149\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n14\n00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.795\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I thought we would start talking about\n\n15\n00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:38.035\nbreeches and notifications.\n\n16\n00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:42.635\nWe left off in the last episode, just\nafter having talked about profiling, what\n\n17\n00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:47.240\nprofiling is, issues associated with the\nmanagement of data relating to children.\n\n18\n00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.450\nAnd just how we would address\nthat some of those concerns,\n\n19\n00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.140\nvery important things to consider.\n\n20\n00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.250\nBut then once we gather all that data\nwe even identify the kinds of data\n\n21\n00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.400\nthat potentially would be classified and\ncategorized and\n\n22\n00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.410\ncollected under a lawful collection\nmethod once we opt in and\n\n23\n00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.790\ntalk about the value of and\nimportance of consent.\n\n24\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.560\nAll that was done in the last episode,\n\n25\n00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.810\nquite a lot of stuff we\ndid in the last episode.\n\n26\n00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.130\nBut with all that in mind,\n\n27\n00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.550\nthat really brings us to the doorstep\nof the thought process of okay,\n\n28\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.030\nit's time we gave our permission as\nwell as [LAUGH] our data to somebody.\n\n29\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.400\nHanded it all to them and\nwere trusting them, the processor and\n\n30\n00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.070\nthe controller both.\n\n31\n00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.110\nTo oversee and\nto work with that data appropriately but\n\n32\n00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.450\nwhat happens if they make a mistake?\n\n33\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.280\nI mean let's be honest,\nwe know they're gonna do their best,\n\n34\n00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.430\nwe know they're gonna act\nhopefully with integrity.\n\n35\n00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760\nAnd they gonna act in\nan appropriate manner,\n\n36\n00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.920\nbut that doesn't mean everybody's\ngonna play nicely, right?\n\n37\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.500\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; There are bad actors out there,\n\n38\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.290\nthreat actors, threats sources that\nlook to do us and others harm.\n\n39\n00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.870\nAnd whether they target us directly or\nindirectly target an entity\n\n40\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.780\nthat may have access to our data,\nwe may get rolled up into that, right.\n\n41\n00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.610\nJust be an innocent bystander,\nunfortunately.\n\n42\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.810\nAnd as a result, we have to worry about\nbreach notification because these\n\n43\n00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.930\nare activities that although not often\nmay actually play a part in what we do.\n\n44\n00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.990\nBecause we may have to be notified\nthere's been an issue and\n\n45\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.650\nas a result how we are gonna then choose\nto go forward will become very important.\n\n46\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.993\nAccording to the regulation,\na personal data breach is, we are now,\n\n47\n00:02:12.993 --> 00:02:14.104\nin quoting mode.\n\n48\n00:02:14.104 --> 00:02:15.633\n&gt;&gt; all right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm still waiting on my flashing but\n\n49\n00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:17.558\nit's not there,\njust thought I'd point that out,\n\n50\n00:02:17.558 --> 00:02:18.926\njust in case anybody's listening.\n\n51\n00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:19.796\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Behind you.\n\n52\n00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:22.856\n&gt;&gt; I just you know it's perfect,\nbecause it could be right here,\n\n53\n00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:26.405\nit would be perfect anyway,\nI'm just off on a limb, right, all right.\n\n54\n00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:29.272\nSo let's get back to what we were\ntalking about, breach notification,\n\n55\n00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:31.160\nlet's quote the exact language here.\n\n56\n00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.310\nA breach of security leading to the\naccidental or unlawful destruction Loss,\n\n57\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.450\nalteration, unauthorized disclosure of or\naccess to personal data.\n\n58\n00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.700\nTransmit stored or\n\n59\n00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.850\notherwise process is considered a breach\naccording to the language in the GDPR.\n\n60\n00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.436\nAgain I often will quote as I\ntell you of the exact language so\n\n61\n00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:54.250\nthat you can understand,\nhear for yourself.\n\n62\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.320\nWhat the terms are, what we're describing,\nwhat we are supposed to be adhering to.\n\n63\n00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.190\nWhat that language says, and\nalso importantly what it does not say,\n\n64\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.040\nas we pointed out in some cases,\nis very important.\n\n65\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.000\nWillful destruction or\n\n66\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.490\nalteration of data is considered to\nbe as much a breach as theft, right.\n\n67\n00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.850\nSo if we purposefully as a processor or\na controller uncover activity or\n\n68\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.060\nindications of the fact that\nsomebody willfully modified data,\n\n69\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.760\nintegrity has been compromised.\n\n70\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.190\nThat impacts confidentiality and\navailability and\n\n71\n00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.160\nthat is considered to be a breach\nbecause the data has no longer or\n\n72\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160\nrather is no longer\nconsidered to be secured.\n\n73\n00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.250\nIt's not kept and managed, and indeed,\nis not in the same state it was when\n\n74\n00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.750\nwe consented, when we gave it\nto you as the data subject.\n\n75\n00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.400\nThat is considered a breach,\njust be aware of that.\n\n76\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.470\nIn the event of a personal breach, and\nwe took a look at this when we went in and\n\n77\n00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.200\nwe took a look at the articles\nin one of the previous episodes.\n\n78\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.486\nI shared some of the articles around data\nbreaches, and notification article 33,\n\n79\n00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:51.209\n34, 35.\n\n80\n00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.390\nWe went through some of them, talked about\nthem in the event of personal data breach.\n\n81\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.114\nI said that there is a clock that starts\nticking, we have to act in reasonable and\n\n82\n00:04:01.114 --> 00:04:03.311\nexpedited fashion as a controller.\n\n83\n00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:05.980\nThe data breach control or\nthe data breach controller,\n\n84\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.145\nthe guy in charge of the girl in\ncharge of the data breach, right?\n\n85\n00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:11.152\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In the event of personal data breach\n\n86\n00:04:11.152 --> 00:04:14.494\nthe controller has the responsibility,\noften through the GPO,\n\n87\n00:04:14.494 --> 00:04:16.086\nthe data protection officer.\n\n88\n00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:21.009\nBut they have the responsibility to notify\nthe appropriate supervisory authority,\n\n89\n00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.870\nwe've talked about this.\n\n90\n00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.180\nAgain quoting, without undue delay and\n\n91\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.010\nwhere feasible, not later than 72-hours\nafter having become aware of it.\n\n92\n00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.390\nSo they have a three-day span,\n72-hours to take appropriate action.\n\n93\n00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.690\nNobody's saying hey five minutes after\nyou figure this out, get on the phone.\n\n94\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.620\nBut within an expedited and reasonable\namount of time, without undue delay.\n\n95\n00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.760\nAnd where feasible, right so\nwe see the potential there may be a little\n\n96\n00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.410\nexception here, where feasible no\nlater than or not later than 72 hours.\n\n97\n00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.720\nIf notification is not\nmade within 72 hours,\n\n98\n00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.950\nthe controller must provide\na reasoned justification.\n\n99\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.540\nGet out of jail free explanation\nin other words for the delay.\n\n100\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.570\nMeaning that if you can't act within\n72 hours because it is not feasible,\n\n101\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.140\nthen you need to document what\nthe circumstances were and be prepared to\n\n102\n00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.450\nexplain those to the supervisory\nauthority as part of the disclosure.\n\n103\n00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.399\nSo that is important to consider as well.\n\n104\n00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.870\nAnd also interesting, again quoting,\nnotice is not required if, quoting here,\n\n105\n00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.740\nthe personal data breach is unlikely\nto result in a risk for the rights and\n\n106\n00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.250\nfreedoms of individuals.\n\n107\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.480\nHowever, how this translates into\nreal world action is not clear, Ryan,\n\n108\n00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.810\nin other words that is not a quote.\n\n109\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.160\nWe stopped it at the point\nwhere it individuals.\n\n110\n00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.830\nBut my point is you now there\nis some confidentiality\n\n111\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.680\nin the clause there that says hey,\nyou have to respond.\n\n112\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.590\nAnd you have to report within 72\nhours if there is a high value breach\n\n113\n00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.370\nthat will lead to risk and compromise.\n\n114\n00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.609\nBut if the breach is unlikely to\nresult in the risk of the rights and\n\n115\n00:05:52.609 --> 00:05:56.550\nfreedom of individuals, then you don't\nhave to necessarily disclose the breach.\n\n116\n00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.510\nWhich means, if they got, they being\nthe bad actor, the threat source.\n\n117\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.507\nIf they got data, but not data that's\ndirectly attributable to individuals and\n\n118\n00:06:04.507 --> 00:06:06.519\ntherefore potentially could violate.\n\n119\n00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:10.712\nAnd compromise the integrity,\nthe availability, and most importantly,\n\n120\n00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:14.060\nthe confidentiality of that individual and\ntheir data.\n\n121\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.680\nThere may not be a requirement,\nand indeed there is not\n\n122\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.200\na requirement at least not formally fully\nstated and defined in the GDPR currently,\n\n123\n00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.380\nthat says you must as a controller,\nas a processor, you must report.\n\n124\n00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.570\nThat doesn't mean that down the road\nwe may not reevaluate that breech and\n\n125\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.040\nthe impact and\nthat there may then be a requirement.\n\n126\n00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.900\nIt's very hard to say, it's very unclear,\na little bit ambiguous.\n\n127\n00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.240\nSo we just have to be aware of that.\n\n128\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.897\nBut is there is some sort of a breach, it\nis important for us to consider whether or\n\n129\n00:06:42.897 --> 00:06:47.073\nnot we a have a right and a responsibility\nin order to be able to do that so,\n\n130\n00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.598\nlet's keep that in mind.\n\n131\n00:06:48.598 --> 00:06:49.153\nAll right,\n\n132\n00:06:49.153 --> 00:06:52.817\nshould the control determine that the\npersonal data breach is likely to result\n\n133\n00:06:52.817 --> 00:06:56.710\nis higher risks to individual rights\nof freedom as I said of the individual.\n\n134\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.470\nWe also not only have to report\nto the supervisory agent\n\n135\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.690\nof the oversight supervisory\nrole within 72 hours.\n\n136\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.090\nBut we also have to communicate to the\nsubject or subjects that were affected.\n\n137\n00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.265\nSo we have to notify both\nthe supervisory agency as well as\n\n138\n00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:18.295\nthe individuals that are subjects that are\ngoing to have their data in that category.\n\n139\n00:07:18.295 --> 00:07:22.155\nSo, we also have to communicate to them,\nunder article 32,\n\n140\n00:07:22.155 --> 00:07:25.895\nthis has to be done without undue delay,\nyou would expect that would be the case.\n\n141\n00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:28.915\nSo just be aware of that but\nthere are exceptions as I noted, and\n\n142\n00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:31.125\nthere are three exceptions\nspecifically curved out.\n\n143\n00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:32.980\nLet me share with you what they're.\n\n144\n00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.100\nException one, the controller has\nimplemented appropriate technical and\n\n145\n00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.040\norganizational protection\nmeasures that render the data\n\n146\n00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.565\nunintelligible to any person who\nis not authorized to access it.\n\n147\n00:07:42.565 --> 00:07:47.420\nI.e., such as encryption, specifically\nquoting from the language in the GDPR.\n\n148\n00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.814\nMeaning that if encryption\nis used as a countermeasure,\n\n149\n00:07:50.814 --> 00:07:52.732\nto safeguard that data at rest.\n\n150\n00:07:52.732 --> 00:07:58.410\nIn use or on the wire, then there is not\na requirement for them to report a breach.\n\n151\n00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.423\nBecause even though the data\nmay have been taken.\n\n152\n00:08:00.423 --> 00:08:02.872\nIt's in a form that is\nunlikely to be accessed and\n\n153\n00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:05.921\ntherefore unlikely to qualify\nas a risk to the individual and\n\n154\n00:08:05.921 --> 00:08:08.814\nwith the rights in freedom,\nthey are supposed to enjoy.\n\n155\n00:08:08.814 --> 00:08:13.694\nWhich is interesting because I would\nlike to know that you have my data and\n\n156\n00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:17.621\nthat you inadvertently or\non purpose did something dumb.\n\n157\n00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:19.951\nAnd somebody got it\neven if it's encrypted.\n\n158\n00:08:19.951 --> 00:08:22.235\nI would still like to know\nthat as a data subject.\n\n159\n00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:26.656\nUnder the current GDPR requirements,\nI am not entitled to know that and\n\n160\n00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:28.056\nthe processor and, or\n\n161\n00:08:28.056 --> 00:08:32.330\nthe controller does not have\na responsibility to notify me of that.\n\n162\n00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.930\nThat doesn't mean they won't, right?\n\n163\n00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.270\nThey very likely will, but\nthey don't have to, right?\n\n164\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.030\nNumber two.\n\n165\n00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.010\nThe controller takes action subsequent\nto the personal data breach to ensure,\n\n166\n00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.270\nagain quoting, ensure that\nthe high risk for the rights and\n\n167\n00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.780\nfreedoms of data subjects\nis unlikely to materialize.\n\n168\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.950\nHard to say what that would be, right?\n\n169\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:57.835\nMaybe they take steps to change\nall account numbers and passwords.\n\n170\n00:08:57.835 --> 00:09:00.655\nHypothetically, I'm just thinking about\nthe logic of the kind of data that\n\n171\n00:09:00.655 --> 00:09:02.235\noften goes out on a breach, right?\n\n172\n00:09:02.235 --> 00:09:07.339\nOr they put multi factor authentication\nin place as a result of the breach,\n\n173\n00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:10.987\nrendering the single-factor\nidentifier useless,\n\n174\n00:09:10.987 --> 00:09:13.917\nwithout now a new improve secured regime.\n\n175\n00:09:13.917 --> 00:09:17.930\nSo the data is very unlikely to be\nuseful to compromise the system.\n\n176\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.715\nIf they rush to put those things in place,\n\n177\n00:09:20.715 --> 00:09:24.786\nthen they don't have to at least again,\naccording to GDPR.\n\n178\n00:09:24.786 --> 00:09:26.988\nThey don't have a responsibility and\n\n179\n00:09:26.988 --> 00:09:29.890\nan obligation under the law\nto report the breach.\n\n180\n00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.890\nThat doesn't mean they won't.\n\n181\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.480\nUsually you can read between the lines.\n\n182\n00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.930\nWhen someone knocks on your door and\nsays, by the way, funny story,\n\n183\n00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.000\nwe're reinventing the way we do\nauthentication around the world.\n\n184\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.480\nWe'd like you to do this.\n\n185\n00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.730\nWow, why are you doing that?\n\n186\n00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.670\nWell, we had nothing to do, lots of money.\n\n187\n00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:45.690\n&gt;&gt; They want to keep you safe.\n\n188\n00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.550\n&gt;&gt; Wanted to go ahead and spend it\nin a way that actually benefits you,\n\n189\n00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.254\nbecause that happens, right?\n\n190\n00:09:50.254 --> 00:09:52.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you may be able to tell,\n\n191\n00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.240\nsomething weird's going on but\nyou don't necessarily have to come clean.\n\n192\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.210\nAnd subsequently we say, by the way we\nwere doing it because, and this is why.\n\n193\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.150\n&gt;&gt; Although sometimes organizations\nare more willing to admit\n\n194\n00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.470\nthat a breach occurred when they can say\nsomething like, yes we got breached but\n\n195\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.690\nit was all encrypted, so\nyou got nothing to worry about,\n\n196\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.930\nbecause that does help with\nconfidence of their customers.\n\n197\n00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.640\nSo sometimes they're a little more willing\nto admit it when they know that it's\n\n198\n00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.080\nnot gonna cause risk to the data.\n\n199\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.730\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, right, hopefully, well,\nyou would hope, right, hopefully.\n\n200\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.190\nBut that's absolutely correct, right, as\nopposed to when they just screwed up and\n\n201\n00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.040\ndid something really dumb and\nwere negligent.\n\n202\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.860\n&gt;&gt; Then, they wait two years\nbefore they notify anybody.\n\n203\n00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.250\n&gt;&gt; Well, they sell the company, and then\ntell you after somebody buys it, right?\n\n204\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.720\nBy the way, we retired and guess what?\n\n205\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.850\nWe screwed up royally, right?\n\n206\n00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.820\nAll right, so number three.\n\n207\n00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.620\nWhen notification to each data\nsubject would, again quoting here,\n\n208\n00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.330\ninvolve disproportionate effort,\nthat phrase we've heard before.\n\n209\n00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.327\nIf it's just too hard, and I can't bring\nmyself to do that kind of work In which\n\n210\n00:10:48.327 --> 00:10:51.249\ncase alternative communications\nmeasures may be used.\n\n211\n00:10:51.249 --> 00:10:53.545\nAgain, they don't describe what\nalternative communications\n\n212\n00:10:53.545 --> 00:10:54.200\nmeasures may be.\n\n213\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.380\nThat's the most kind of whingey one of\nthe group there and still one that's like,\n\n214\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.440\nyeah, we are just gonna say if it's too\nhard you could just essentially have\n\n215\n00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.885\na free pass and\nnot bother to tell anybody.\n\n216\n00:11:02.885 --> 00:11:06.529\nI'm not sure how that one gets, ultimately\ngets interpreted and what that will mean.\n\n217\n00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:09.560\nYeah again, we're talking about\nstuff that is yet to go into force.\n\n218\n00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.760\nWe're ramping up towards that as we\nmade clear a couple of other episodes.\n\n219\n00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.099\nOur timeline around this is late in 2017.\n\n220\n00:11:16.099 --> 00:11:17.393\nWill the target go live?\n\n221\n00:11:17.393 --> 00:11:20.469\nThey'd fully upped the GDPR\nin the end of March of 2018,\n\n222\n00:11:20.469 --> 00:11:23.681\nroughly about an 8 month window,\n7 to 8 month window for us.\n\n223\n00:11:23.681 --> 00:11:26.537\nSo we're in some cases getting\nout our crystal balls and\n\n224\n00:11:26.537 --> 00:11:28.239\nforecasting ahead a little bit,\n\n225\n00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:31.530\nas to what the interpretation\nof some of these areas may be.\n\n226\n00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.125\nOthers are very clear, black and white.\n\n227\n00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:36.200\nHey, you didn't do this,\nthis is what has to happen or not happen,\n\n228\n00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.360\nso we do need to understand that.\n\n229\n00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.420\nBut there are some areas where there's\nstill some room for interpretation.\n\n230\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.690\nAnd it's not very clear, or at least\nnot equally clear what that would be,\n\n231\n00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.780\nand kind of how we would envision those.\n\n232\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.490\nSo we're doing our best to lay out\na foundation of understanding for you.\n\n233\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:57.079\nBut also keep in mind that a lot of what\nwe're discussing is open to and subject to\n\n234\n00:11:57.079 --> 00:12:01.751\ninterpretation and change based on\nthe rules enforced during implementation.\n\n235\n00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:05.735\nAnd as we pointed out in some cases\nshortly thereafter potentially, if for\n\n236\n00:12:05.735 --> 00:12:08.790\ninstance we come back around\nto that conversation.\n\n237\n00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.360\nAround the minimum threshold in terms\nof the number of employees to enforce\n\n238\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.350\ncertain rules.\n\n239\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.280\nThings like the requirement for\na data protection officer for instance.\n\n240\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.150\nThere may be a change.\n\n241\n00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.110\nIt's hard to say, right?\n\n242\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.260\nSo we always wanna be open to\nthe idea that things will and\n\n243\n00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.256\nindeed may often need to be changed.\n\n244\n00:12:23.256 --> 00:12:26.840\nWe want to be open to the idea in these\nconversations that the most up to date and\n\n245\n00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.740\naccurate information Is going\ndirectly to the source, right?\n\n246\n00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.926\nSo look at the EU legislative\nwebsite to keep up to date on what\n\n247\n00:12:34.926 --> 00:12:40.535\nis happening with GDPR and any and\nall laws that affect that area.\n\n248\n00:12:40.535 --> 00:12:45.518\nAnd any country's interpretation of those\nlaws Is always open to understanding based\n\n249\n00:12:45.518 --> 00:12:48.530\non the circumstances at\nthe moment in time, right?\n\n250\n00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:53.180\nData subject access requests, what we call\nDSARs, another area of interest to us.\n\n251\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.908\nIndividuals we'll have more information\non how their data is processed.\n\n252\n00:12:56.908 --> 00:12:59.151\nAnd it should be made available in\na clear and understandable way,\n\n253\n00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:00.060\nas we've made clear.\n\n254\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.200\nThat's one of the key takeaways and\nbenefits of the GDPR.\n\n255\n00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.020\nWe want you to have better\ninsight as the data subject.\n\n256\n00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:11.180\nAs the owner of the data, into the value,\nthe role and the ultimately availability,\n\n257\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.730\nconfidentiality and integrity of your\ndata when it is under management.\n\n258\n00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.550\nSo data subject access\nrequests are very important.\n\n259\n00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.740\nBecause they are the mechanism that\nallows a subject to validate, verify, and\n\n260\n00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.200\nessentially keep an eye on their data when\nthe processor and controller is using it.\n\n261\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.570\nIt's a very important mechanism.\n\n262\n00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.211\nThey should be executed quoting,\nwithout undo delay and at the latest,\n\n263\n00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:35.265\nwithin one month of\nthe receipt of the request.\n\n264\n00:13:35.265 --> 00:13:40.229\nSo there's a 30 day window, as I talked\nabout in the last episode, where when\n\n265\n00:13:40.229 --> 00:13:45.060\nwe make that request the controller\nprocessor has the ability to spend time.\n\n266\n00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.580\nBecause look, we have to be realistic.\n\n267\n00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.700\nJust because you need it doesn't mean\nthat we can go easily provide it.\n\n268\n00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.130\nAnd if we're a global company,\nit may take some time for\n\n269\n00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:56.600\nus to work through our processes to be\nable to generate that data accurately.\n\n270\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.960\nAnd to provide it to you in a secure\nmanner, which is very important.\n\n271\n00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.003\nWe're not just talking about\nprinting out a piece of paper,\n\n272\n00:14:02.003 --> 00:14:03.618\nputting it in an envelope and\nsending it to you.\n\n273\n00:14:03.618 --> 00:14:04.996\nI mean that maybe what they do.\n\n274\n00:14:04.996 --> 00:14:09.231\nBut if it's a request to see bank\nrecords going back 12 months to look for\n\n275\n00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:12.785\nfraudulent transactions and\nevidence of identity theft, or\n\n276\n00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:15.946\ncredit card statements, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n277\n00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:17.200\nYou can imagine all these things.\n\n278\n00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.910\nBut you can't just put all\nthat stuff in the mail.\n\n279\n00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.800\nI mean you could, but\nthat would be foolish, right?\n\n280\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.535\nAnd send it to somebody, its got all\nsorts of concerns associated with it.\n\n281\n00:14:24.535 --> 00:14:28.080\nIts got to be communicated in a secure\nfashion, and that requires time and\n\n282\n00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.390\neffort to figure it out.\n\n283\n00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.990\nAnd not every company has\nsystems that are equal.\n\n284\n00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.463\nAnd not every company has systems that are\nthe same and speak the same language and\n\n285\n00:14:35.463 --> 00:14:36.704\ngenerate data the same way.\n\n286\n00:14:36.704 --> 00:14:40.776\nAlthough there is now an equalization\nrequirement in the GDPR that stipulates\n\n287\n00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:43.182\nthat we have to use\ncommonly accepted forms for\n\n288\n00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:45.352\ntechnological systems to communicate.\n\n289\n00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:46.840\nMeaning in plain language,\n\n290\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.381\ncomputers have to essentially all\noperate at a bare minimum level.\n\n291\n00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:54.521\nSo a data standard for export, like CSV,\nis commonly acceptable to everybody and\n\n292\n00:14:54.521 --> 00:14:58.242\nis actually called out in the regulations\nbeing the standard that would be\n\n293\n00:14:58.242 --> 00:14:59.165\nacceptable.\n\n294\n00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:03.475\nBut noting also that many companies\nmaintain systems that are proprietary.\n\n295\n00:15:03.475 --> 00:15:07.905\nAnd are not gonna operate in anything\nlike the same kind of environment and\n\n296\n00:15:07.905 --> 00:15:10.560\nproduce data in the same functional ways.\n\n297\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.080\nBut we have to come down to a bare\nleast common denominator minimum\n\n298\n00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.380\nin order to make that\naccessible across the board for\n\n299\n00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.600\ndata subjects when they make requirements\nor requests of us in this way.\n\n300\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.740\nAnd so specifically interested in there\nto call out something like CSV as being\n\n301\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.100\none of the accepted ways.\n\n302\n00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.070\nComma separated value export which is so\nuniversal\n\n303\n00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.770\nthat everybody would be able to take that,\nput that in another system and use it.\n\n304\n00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:37.000\nSo it is interesting that they've gone\nto that length in the regulation.\n\n305\n00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.020\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; Kinda cool from a geeky perspective.\n\n306\n00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.086\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It is kinda neat.\n\n307\n00:15:40.086 --> 00:15:41.400\n&gt;&gt; All right so we do see that.\n\n308\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.967\nSo executed without undue delay,\nat least, at least,\n\n309\n00:15:43.967 --> 00:15:45.835\nright, has to be done within one month.\n\n310\n00:15:45.835 --> 00:15:48.694\nNow again there is an exception that\nlet's us push that out a little bit.\n\n311\n00:15:48.694 --> 00:15:50.693\nI talked about that.\n\n312\n00:15:50.693 --> 00:15:55.024\nAnd remember, we do have to give the data\nsubject information about the purposes for\n\n313\n00:15:55.024 --> 00:15:57.650\ncollection or\nduring collection when they opt in.\n\n314\n00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.430\nWe have to tell them what we're providing\nthat data and using it for, so we have to\n\n315\n00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.700\nremind them of that, but they do have\nthe right as a data subject to request it.\n\n316\n00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.577\nAlso the right to data portability\nfocused on helping drive\n\n317\n00:16:07.577 --> 00:16:11.086\ncompetition between providers,\nmoving data around makes it easier for\n\n318\n00:16:11.086 --> 00:16:14.537\nus to decide to take our business\nelsewhere, especially in the cloud,\n\n319\n00:16:14.537 --> 00:16:17.201\nvery important for\nus to see that and understand that.\n\n320\n00:16:17.201 --> 00:16:21.269\nBut we do have to understand that if we\nare looking at automated forms of data\n\n321\n00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:24.112\ntransmission, which we\noften are thinking about,\n\n322\n00:16:24.112 --> 00:16:28.246\nthere is the struggle to define common\nformats, as I talked about, between\n\n323\n00:16:28.246 --> 00:16:32.727\nservices which are really primarily used\nfor automated customer data movement.\n\n324\n00:16:32.727 --> 00:16:33.917\nIt's a little bit difficult, and\n\n325\n00:16:33.917 --> 00:16:36.010\nit's a little unclear what\nthat's gonna look like.\n\n326\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.970\nI mentioned things like CSV as a common\ndata file format for export, but\n\n327\n00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.360\nthat's not necessarily gonna work for\neverything.\n\n328\n00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.610\nTerabytes of data in the cloud for\n\n329\n00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.860\nvirtual infrastructure's not gonna\nget exported to a CSV format.\n\n330\n00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.199\nYou can't rehydrate a VM based on\na CSVX form, it just doesn't work.\n\n331\n00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:55.860\nWhere was that property again?\n\n332\n00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.100\nThat doesn't work that way, right?\n\n333\n00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.323\nThere are acceptable data formats for\ncertain kinds of data.\n\n334\n00:17:00.323 --> 00:17:05.600\nCSV is good for generic bulk user-specific\ndata that's of general kind but\n\n335\n00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.631\na system specific data, things like\nvirtual machine images, database\n\n336\n00:17:10.631 --> 00:17:16.660\ninformation could be exported to CSV, but\nvirtual machine images cannot be, right?\n\n337\n00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.100\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n338\n00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.210\nAnd so some of that is\nstill up in the air, right?\n\n339\n00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.210\nBecause, although we have\nindustry standards for\n\n340\n00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.500\nvirtual machines in terms of export and\n\n341\n00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.610\nOVA OVF kind of format, that may not\nbe universally acceptable to everybody.\n\n342\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.600\nAnd we may not be be able to declare\nthat as a universal solution.\n\n343\n00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.268\nSo we just have to think about that\nfact that some of that may be vague.\n\n344\n00:17:34.268 --> 00:17:36.550\nRetention and the right to be forgotten,\nwe talked about this.\n\n345\n00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.130\nThese are some of the rights that\nare outlined that we'll go into in\n\n346\n00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.130\nmore detail.\n\n347\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.330\nControllers must inform as we've talked\nabout subjects of the periods of time and\n\n348\n00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.080\nthe reasons why data will be\nretained upon collection.\n\n349\n00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.760\nRemember, we talked about\nthe opt-in concept.\n\n350\n00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.938\nIn fact, we have to secure that permission\nin an affirmative action oriented way.\n\n351\n00:17:53.938 --> 00:17:58.269\nWe can't just sit back and pre-populate\nand by somebody clicking somewhere else,\n\n352\n00:17:58.269 --> 00:18:01.685\nassuming that that means that they\naccept and we didn't say no, so\n\n353\n00:18:01.685 --> 00:18:02.855\nthought you said yes.\n\n354\n00:18:02.855 --> 00:18:06.160\nWell no, that's not how that works,\nright, so we gotta be aware of that.\n\n355\n00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:07.950\nAnd remember,\n\n356\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.160\nif we subsequently decide after we opt in,\nwe want our data to be removed,\n\n357\n00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.480\nwe have a legal right to claim for that to\nhappen and we do need to understand that.\n\n358\n00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.510\nThere's also a downstream\nresponsibility associated here for\n\n359\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.680\nthe controllers to take reasonable steps.\n\n360\n00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.710\nAgain, quoting language from the GDPR\ndirectly, to notify processors and\n\n361\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:30.110\nother downstream data recipients that\nthe user has requested to opt out and\n\n362\n00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.460\nto have data removed downstream.\n\n363\n00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.940\nSo the data processor, or\nexcuse me, data controller rather,\n\n364\n00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.870\nhas that responsibility when the user\nshows up and makes their request.\n\n365\n00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:44.180\nThey've gotta go to all the processors,\nright, in their chain and say, hey,\n\n366\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.140\nby the way,\nMike said we can't use his data anymore.\n\n367\n00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.810\nAnd it's not just this one\nrelationship right here.\n\n368\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.690\nBut it's this relationship and all\nthe levels that branch out are essentially\n\n369\n00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.960\ndependent on that, that the controller\nhas to do best effort to notify and\n\n370\n00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.740\nto ensure that they are made aware of it.\n\n371\n00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.298\nBut we call that the downstream\nresponsibility, and it's defined as such.\n\n372\n00:19:03.298 --> 00:19:06.398\nAnd we have to make sure we\nare aware of that, right,\n\n373\n00:19:06.398 --> 00:19:08.379\nbecause that is also important.\n\n374\n00:19:08.379 --> 00:19:11.474\nThere's also something known\nas the e-privacy regulation.\n\n375\n00:19:11.474 --> 00:19:15.390\nAnd the GDPR needs to be aware of this and\ndepend on this.\n\n376\n00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:20.624\nThere's many different names that the\ne-privacy regulations goes by e-privacy,\n\n377\n00:19:20.624 --> 00:19:22.303\ne-privacy two, PECR2.\n\n378\n00:19:22.303 --> 00:19:25.292\nIt's commonly called pecker, PECR2.\n\n379\n00:19:25.292 --> 00:19:26.125\nThat's always fun to say.\n\n380\n00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:30.858\nAnd ePR, small ePR, these are all names\nthat you may see bantered around and or\n\n381\n00:19:30.858 --> 00:19:35.684\nused to describe the e-privacy regulation,\nePR for e-privacy regulation.\n\n382\n00:19:35.684 --> 00:19:41.612\nAnd this is gonna replace and ultimately\nupdate the existing EU directives,\n\n383\n00:19:41.612 --> 00:19:46.459\ntrying to harmonize and\nreally work side by side with the GDPR.\n\n384\n00:19:46.459 --> 00:19:50.032\nIt has global reach and\nsignificant penalties associated with it,\n\n385\n00:19:50.032 --> 00:19:53.990\njust like the GDPR does for\nnon-compliance, so that is important.\n\n386\n00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:57.120\nAnd it's gonna be\nreplacing individual laws.\n\n387\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.640\nFor instance, in the UK, the equivalent\nof the e-privacy regulation is what I\n\n388\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.892\nmentioned, the PECR regime,\nPECR and PECR2, right?\n\n389\n00:20:04.892 --> 00:20:09.940\nAnd so it will replace, the e-privacy\nregulation will replace those laws.\n\n390\n00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.320\nBut it's interesting because, again,\nwe're looking at Brexit, right?\n\n391\n00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:18.470\nThe idea of the UK leaving the EU formally\nstructurally from a legality perspective,\n\n392\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.130\nseparating, but it's very unclear.\n\n393\n00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.740\nNobody knows what that's\ngonna look like ultimately.\n\n394\n00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:29.300\nWhat the UK will still adhere to and agree\nto in terms of the EU law and what it will\n\n395\n00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.720\nessentially ignore, opt out of or somehow\nfind a way around, nobody knows for sure.\n\n396\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.337\nAnd it's gonna be several years before we\nreally understand the full impact of that.\n\n397\n00:20:37.337 --> 00:20:40.505\nAnd so they are,\nthey being the UK, opting out and\n\n398\n00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:43.230\nhave made it clear they're on the way out.\n\n399\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.901\nBut at the same time, this law's coming\ninto effect before Brexit is fully\n\n400\n00:20:46.901 --> 00:20:49.130\nnegotiated and is gonna go into effect.\n\n401\n00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:49.670\nWhich means for\n\n402\n00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:53.160\na crossover period of time, these laws\nare gonna be in effect in the UK.\n\n403\n00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.830\nAnd the general consensus and\n\n404\n00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.034\nthought is that many of these laws may\nwind up staying in effect in one form or\n\n405\n00:20:59.034 --> 00:21:03.677\nanother, because once you go to implement\nthem, it's very hard to unwind them.\n\n406\n00:21:03.677 --> 00:21:05.891\nWe can think of the money and the time and\n\n407\n00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:09.251\nthe effort that goes into\nintegrating a regime like this and\n\n408\n00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:13.769\nchanging business practices, and\nregulatory compliance and all that stuff.\n\n409\n00:21:13.769 --> 00:21:16.135\nAnd if we don't deal with\nthat in a forthright way,\n\n410\n00:21:16.135 --> 00:21:17.575\nwe're held to be in contempt.\n\n411\n00:21:17.575 --> 00:21:19.687\nAnd if we do,\nyou know we may have a problem,\n\n412\n00:21:19.687 --> 00:21:21.640\nbecause now we have all this stuff done.\n\n413\n00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.410\nSo it's really kind of this\ncrazy tumultuous time,\n\n414\n00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.020\nat least in that little corner of the EU,\nright?\n\n415\n00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.250\nBut it's interesting because a lot\nof these things may wind up becoming\n\n416\n00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:37.090\nsome sort of basis for the standardized\npath forward in terms of the negotiation.\n\n417\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.560\nSo it'll be very interesting to\nsee how all that plays out, but\n\n418\n00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.840\njust something to consider.\n\n419\n00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.503\nThe e-privacy that we were talking about,\nthe regulation, the EPR,\n\n420\n00:21:46.503 --> 00:21:51.447\nis currently still in draft form as of\nlate September, rather late in 2017,\n\n421\n00:21:51.447 --> 00:21:56.173\nbut September, October, November,\nin this timeframe that we're putting\n\n422\n00:21:56.173 --> 00:22:01.069\nthis content together for you in 2017,\nthe legislation is still in draft.\n\n423\n00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:06.685\nThe latest issue or latest revision of\nthat was issued on 9th of September 2017,\n\n424\n00:22:06.685 --> 00:22:10.195\nso roughly just 35 days\nfrom before we filmed this,\n\n425\n00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:15.625\ncuz we're filming this right at the end\nof October, beginning of November.\n\n426\n00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:19.318\nSo roughly just about a month before\nthis content was put together for you.\n\n427\n00:22:19.318 --> 00:22:23.265\nThe latest version of that regulation\nwas put out in draft form.\n\n428\n00:22:23.265 --> 00:22:28.862\nIt is still on target to go live side by\nside with the GDPR at the end of May,\n\n429\n00:22:28.862 --> 00:22:30.172\n25th of May of 2018.\n\n430\n00:22:30.172 --> 00:22:31.662\nBut it's unclear whether or\n\n431\n00:22:31.662 --> 00:22:35.372\nnot that will happen just based on final\nnegotiations around the regulations.\n\n432\n00:22:35.372 --> 00:22:38.330\nSo just mentioning things that\nare happening in real time,\n\n433\n00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.540\nwe just have to be aware of that and\nunderstand that.\n\n434\n00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.690\nBut it is on track right now,\nin theory anyway,\n\n435\n00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.730\nto potentially still be going live\nsimultaneously in a parallel track.\n\n436\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.130\nAnd so it'll be interesting\nto keep our eyes on that and\n\n437\n00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:53.690\nsee what's going on with that, because\nthat will essentially reproduce the GDPR\n\n438\n00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:57.260\nin some other areas, and apply the same\nkind of forceful regime, regulation and\n\n439\n00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.540\ncompliance and fines for\nlack of compliance in those areas.\n\n440\n00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.130\nSo it's very important to keep in mind,\nbe aware of that.\n\n441\n00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:08.030\nThings like digital marketing activity and\n\n442\n00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.830\na lot of that kind of concern\nas we've been talking about,\n\n443\n00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.690\nare going to be really for us to think\nabout and continue to struggle with,\n\n444\n00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.060\nbecause there still has to be an allowance\nfor that opt-in, as we talked about.\n\n445\n00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:18.589\nAnd so,\n\n446\n00:23:18.589 --> 00:23:23.449\nas I think I talked about this idea of\nthis unambiguous action with opt-in.\n\n447\n00:23:23.449 --> 00:23:26.658\nBut I also noted that they're this soft\nopt-in that we often talk about or\n\n448\n00:23:26.658 --> 00:23:30.000\nwe've heard about, where they\npre-populate things, things like that.\n\n449\n00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.880\nIt's going away for the most part, but\n\n450\n00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.980\nthere may be some exceptions depending\non the kind of things we're looking at.\n\n451\n00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.835\nSo we do have to be aware of the fact that\nwe have to probably tighten up a lot of\n\n452\n00:23:38.835 --> 00:23:41.115\nthose activities from\na marketing perspective.\n\n453\n00:23:41.115 --> 00:23:45.124\nThings like cookies and tracking\ntechnologies are gonna be under review and\n\n454\n00:23:45.124 --> 00:23:47.565\nkind of under scrutiny here,\nbecause again,\n\n455\n00:23:47.565 --> 00:23:50.526\nwe now have to require prior consent for\nthem to be used.\n\n456\n00:23:50.526 --> 00:23:51.860\nYou've actually seen,\n\n457\n00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.550\nprobably all of us have seen evidence\nof this in the last 18 months.\n\n458\n00:23:55.550 --> 00:24:00.160\nIn advance of and an acknowledgement of\nthe GDPR coming online where websites,\n\n459\n00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.330\nespecially in Europe in the EU, but now\nkinda really back flying around the world.\n\n460\n00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.300\nBecause more and more companies outside\nof the EU knowing this is coming\n\n461\n00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.970\nhave started to adopt the practices\nof businesses in the EU.\n\n462\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:12.850\nTo be in the forefront and\n\n463\n00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.380\nreally be considered to be compliant\nwhen the GDPR comes online.\n\n464\n00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.640\nAnd I could still remember, it's about\n18 months ago, when we started to see\n\n465\n00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.070\nthis behavior on websites where we\nwould see the big banner that comes up.\n\n466\n00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.960\nOr you know what I'm talking about,\nthe big banner that comes up,\n\n467\n00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.320\nsomewhere on the screen, on the bottom,\non the side, or wherever it is.\n\n468\n00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.790\nBut a banner at some point that will pop\nup, especially if this is the first time\n\n469\n00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.300\nyou're visiting that site,\nyou haven't already acknowledged it.\n\n470\n00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.200\nThat now gives you a much more\nthorough an explanative or\n\n471\n00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.100\nexplanatory understanding of the policies\nfor privacy, for rights management\n\n472\n00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.790\ninformation protection, and\nmost importantly for the use of cookies.\n\n473\n00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.920\nBecause cookies is one of those\ntechnologies that is really being\n\n474\n00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.610\nscrutinized and we have to get the opt in.\n\n475\n00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.060\nAnd so you're now being given\nthat disclaimer that's gonna\n\n476\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.510\nput the burden of responsibility\nsquarely where it belongs.\n\n477\n00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.900\nProvider has to notify you that they're\ndoing this by providing new mechanisms to\n\n478\n00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.130\nessentially notify you.\n\n479\n00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.910\nAnd that's what's going on, and we have\nto lead with that and understand that,\n\n480\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:10.960\nand that's why you're seeing\nthis kinda stuff popping up.\n\n481\n00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:15.090\nReally kind of interesting to think\nabout that and just to understand that.\n\n482\n00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:19.310\nAll right, we've talked a lot about the\ninformation that the GDPR does apply to.\n\n483\n00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.450\nWe talked about personal data and\ndescribed that.\n\n484\n00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.910\nWe've talked about automated personal\ndata and manual data that is gathered,\n\n485\n00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.900\nyou know you providing your information.\n\n486\n00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.270\nYou know, this also leads to some\ninteresting things like Autofill, right?\n\n487\n00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.230\nIf you think about, for instance,\n\n488\n00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.700\njust thinking about the logic of\nsome technology and how stuff works.\n\n489\n00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.510\nWhen you Autofill, or\ncan potentially Autofill a form,\n\n490\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.180\nis it acceptable for\nthe company who owns the data now,\n\n491\n00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.450\nthe processor and/or controller\nController function?\n\n492\n00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.190\nI'm thinking for instance, when I go and\nrenew my subscriptions to magazines,\n\n493\n00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:51.420\nstuff like that online right.\n\n494\n00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.250\nA lot of times with those forms,\nwhere they'll pre-populate,\n\n495\n00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.666\nthey'll send me an email traditionally\nright, and it'll have a link.\n\n496\n00:25:57.666 --> 00:25:59.900\nLike okay if this is really you,\nclick here so\n\n497\n00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.820\nyou can complete the registration process.\n\n498\n00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.080\nYou'll go to the form, it's already\npre-populated with most information,\n\n499\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.750\nit's usually one or two fields they\npurposely leave out that you have to\n\n500\n00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.010\nselect, essentially\ncertify it's really you.\n\n501\n00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.880\nAnd so you'll do that and then you'll\nhave, at the bottom, whatever you like,\n\n502\n00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.410\nyeah, I wanna get these newsletters, click\nOK and whatever and then you're renew.\n\n503\n00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.160\nSo is that still acceptable because\ntheir pre populating the data?\n\n504\n00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.840\nAnd is the data gonna have accuracy and\nintegrity associated with it?\n\n505\n00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.145\nDo we have the right to see\nthat data throughout the year?\n\n506\n00:26:28.145 --> 00:26:32.780\nWell clearly we do, but does the processor\nhave the right to pre-populate it or\n\n507\n00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.600\ndo we have to provide it all again to\nensure accuracy and to opt in properly?\n\n508\n00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.170\nThese are areas that\nare interesting to think about and\n\n509\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:45.310\nto ponder and consider, because we've\ntaken a lot of this for granted.\n\n510\n00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:49.517\nBut the reality is, may not be as simple\nas it once was because we have personal\n\n511\n00:26:49.517 --> 00:26:54.073\ndata, of a general type, then we have\na category called sensitive personal data.\n\n512\n00:26:54.073 --> 00:26:58.799\nThe subcategory, sensitive personal data,\nfalls under special categories\n\n513\n00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:02.315\nof personal data,\nArticle 9 in the GDPR calls these out.\n\n514\n00:27:02.315 --> 00:27:07.487\nThey're broadly defined, although there\nare some updates and minor changes.\n\n515\n00:27:07.487 --> 00:27:12.530\nThe DPA, the Data Protection Act in\nthe UK defines these pretty clearly and\n\n516\n00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.705\nthe GDPR is aligned with just\nabout all of them in the same way.\n\n517\n00:27:16.705 --> 00:27:19.187\nThere's some minor updates and\nvariations, but in general.\n\n518\n00:27:19.187 --> 00:27:22.717\nAnd I mentioned this, I think back in\nepisode one, genetic data and biometric\n\n519\n00:27:22.717 --> 00:27:27.107\ndata is now called in and brought in as\nbeing a protected class and category of\n\n520\n00:27:27.107 --> 00:27:31.657\ndata, where it is processed in such a way\nthat uniquely identifies the individual.\n\n521\n00:27:31.657 --> 00:27:34.337\nAll companies that are doing\nmultifactoral authentication and\n\n522\n00:27:34.337 --> 00:27:38.117\nusing biometrics,\npotentially have now a liability here.\n\n523\n00:27:38.117 --> 00:27:39.747\nWhat about all those companies,\n23 and Me, and\n\n524\n00:27:39.747 --> 00:27:43.350\nall those other companies that\nare doing all the genetic testing and\n\n525\n00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:46.530\ntrying to build the genetic\ndata bank around the world?\n\n526\n00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:51.030\nThis scares just the bejesus out of me,\nI cannot even begin to describe\n\n527\n00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.470\nto you how terrified I am\nwhen I see these commercials.\n\n528\n00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.820\nAnd people just seem to\nthink this is a good idea.\n\n529\n00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.660\n&gt;&gt; Well, especially when you follow that\ncommercial up with an article about this\n\n530\n00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:04.560\norganization that can now generate DNA,\nor based on that,\n\n531\n00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:10.640\nthey can duplicate that stuff, and\ngive you a blood sample based on that.\n\n532\n00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.160\n&gt;&gt; We live in fascinating times,\nthe Chinese curse that you\n\n533\n00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.140\nshould live in interesting times\nrevisits us on a regular basis.\n\n534\n00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.860\nIt's interesting because\nwe have these capabilities.\n\n535\n00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.230\nThink about all the good that has come\nfrom that kind of understanding of\n\n536\n00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:26.230\nthe human genome.\n\n537\n00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.730\nInnovative treatments for all sorts of\ndiseases, people are living longer,\n\n538\n00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.130\nwe're saving people's lives,\nthat's all great stuff.\n\n539\n00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:36.340\nWhen I say it scares the bejesus out of\nme, not because that stuff scares me,\n\n540\n00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.960\nthat stuff is great,\nwe should do that, no doubt about it.\n\n541\n00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.490\nBut the problem you run\ninto with this stuff,\n\n542\n00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.740\nfrom my perspective as\na security professional,\n\n543\n00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:48.460\nas an IT focused individual who deals with\nsecurity and information security and\n\n544\n00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:54.740\nthe lack thereof in customers around\nthe world on a regular basis, and who has\n\n545\n00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:59.160\nfamily members who are genetic counselors,\nso I see this from multiple perspectives.\n\n546\n00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.960\nAnd understanding exactly\nwhat we can tell about you.\n\n547\n00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.960\nAnd when you think about the fact that\nyou're essentially giving this information\n\n548\n00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.230\nto an unknown third party, who has a great\njob, has done a great job of marketing.\n\n549\n00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:17.190\nBut I'm waiting, I'm waiting and you've\nheard it here first, replay this episode\n\n550\n00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.430\nwhen this does happen, and I want you\nto then get in touch with me, and\n\n551\n00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.660\ntell me whether you believe that\nwhat I told you is accurate.\n\n552\n00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:29.290\nI am waiting for the announcement that\none of these companies got hacked.\n\n553\n00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.110\nAnd that when they got hacked, and\n\n554\n00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.410\nall this information was exposed,\nwhat happens then?\n\n555\n00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:37.620\nBecause, I don't think\nanybody really truly gets\n\n556\n00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.100\nthe potential liabilities\nthat are involved here.\n\n557\n00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.200\nThis is not okay, they got my bank account\ninformation, they stole my money, and\n\n558\n00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.690\nnow insurance is gonna repay the bank and\nI'm gonna get my money back.\n\n559\n00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.320\nYeah that all happens, that's\nunfortunate for you, it's inconvenient,\n\n560\n00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.040\nit's unfortunate for the bank,\nit's inconvenient for them.\n\n561\n00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.900\nThe insurance company has\ngotta reach into their pocket,\n\n562\n00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.970\nLord knows they have enough money,\nso they should pay, so fine.\n\n563\n00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:02.580\nAll of that's absolutely horrible,\nshould not happen, it is illegal,\n\n564\n00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.340\nit's wrong,\nI don't disagree with any of that.\n\n565\n00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:04.870\nBut you know what?\n\n566\n00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.285\nIf you have end of the day,\n\n567\n00:30:06.285 --> 00:30:09.355\nwe're essentially talking about\na victimless crime, right?\n\n568\n00:30:09.355 --> 00:30:11.565\nBecause you're going to get\nyour money back, whether or\n\n569\n00:30:11.565 --> 00:30:14.125\nnot the bad person who did\nthis gets caught, fine.\n\n570\n00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:17.365\nYes, people are ultimately victims\nbecause insurance rates go up and all\n\n571\n00:30:17.365 --> 00:30:21.415\nthat other stuff, but nobody was really\nhurt in a meaningful way by that activity.\n\n572\n00:30:21.415 --> 00:30:26.015\nEven though it was illegal and\nit was wrong, but nobody really got hurt.\n\n573\n00:30:26.015 --> 00:30:30.350\nThis kind of stuff, we don't really\nknow what's in that Pandora's box.\n\n574\n00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:34.200\nAll we know is that somebody,\ntheoretically,\n\n575\n00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.882\nhas your genetic information,\nessentially can make another you.\n\n576\n00:30:37.882 --> 00:30:39.940\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was getting ready to say,\na second Adam over here.\n\n577\n00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.500\n&gt;&gt; And we don't really know from\na perspective of what that means,\n\n578\n00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.580\nwhat that information could be used to do.\n\n579\n00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.210\nI'm not suggesting that means you're gonna\nwalk down the street and see yourself,\n\n580\n00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.470\nright, that may happen in the future.\n\n581\n00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:55.125\nAnd Lord knows that's always\na possibility, but I'm more concerned\n\n582\n00:30:55.125 --> 00:30:58.985\nabout the immediate, next five to\nten years when these breaches occur.\n\n583\n00:30:58.985 --> 00:31:01.075\nSomebody takes that genetic data and\n\n584\n00:31:01.075 --> 00:31:03.855\nfigures out how to use\nit to blackmail you.\n\n585\n00:31:03.855 --> 00:31:08.060\nI'm gonna tell your employer that you are\npotentially suffering from this disease.\n\n586\n00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:12.150\nOr that you have the ability to\ngenerate and develop this disease, and\n\n587\n00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.620\nas a result I'm gonna go to your insurance\ncompany and I'm gonna blackmail you.\n\n588\n00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.450\nOr I'm gonna make it clear to\neverybody in your life around you\n\n589\n00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:20.540\nthat you have this issue.\n\n590\n00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:24.400\nI mean there's just unlimited chaos\nthat can derive from this, and yet\n\n591\n00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:30.010\nI see people lining up, I mean,\nit's like they're giving away free money.\n\n592\n00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.510\nPeople think this is\nthe best thing in the world.\n\n593\n00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.980\nI talked to people that have done this and\n\n594\n00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:36.420\nI just don't get,\nfrom their perspective, what is so\n\n595\n00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:41.460\nimportant about knowing this information\nthat common sense goes out the window.\n\n596\n00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.710\nI understand if you want to\nknow where you came from.\n\n597\n00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.600\nI understand if you have a burning\ndesire to figure out genetically\n\n598\n00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.890\nwhat parts of the world\nyou're coming from.\n\n599\n00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.220\nI get that, not that there's\nanything wrong with that, but\n\n600\n00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.500\ndo it in a secure way.\n\n601\n00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.940\nGo to a genetic counselor,\ndo it as a one on one activity.\n\n602\n00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.250\nHave it done in a way that will\nthen ensure your security,\n\n603\n00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.480\nyour privacy, your confidentiality.\n\n604\n00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.390\nDon't give it to a nameless,\nfaceless company on the web.\n\n605\n00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.680\n&gt;&gt; Put it in the mail.\n&gt;&gt; That is gonna market that data and\n\n606\n00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.960\ndo Lord knows what with it.\n\n607\n00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.010\nYet, people feel this is\na perfectly acceptable behavior.\n\n608\n00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.430\nI just I'm constantly amazed\nat just the seeming lack of\n\n609\n00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.510\nunderstanding with regards to\nsafeguards and confidentiality.\n\n610\n00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:24.040\nYet time and time again, I'm proven, when\nI think I've reached the absolute limit\n\n611\n00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.960\nwhere I say okay there is no way\nanybody else could be that dumb,\n\n612\n00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.560\nsomething else come up, and\nit's actually even worse.\n\n613\n00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.940\nAnd this has become a real issue\nin the last several years.\n\n614\n00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.900\nAgain, remember you heard it\nhere first when it happens.\n\n615\n00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.420\nAnd I'm not saying this because\nI want this to happen, but\n\n616\n00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.970\nI promise you it's only a matter of time.\n\n617\n00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:39.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I man that's [INAUDIBLE].\n\n618\n00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:43.210\n&gt;&gt; One or more of those companies is gonna\nget hacked, this data's gonna leak out\n\n619\n00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:46.130\nsomewhere, and there's gonna be\nabsolute chaos that results.\n\n620\n00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.780\n&gt;&gt; That is a juicy target\njust sitting there.\n\n621\n00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.010\n&gt;&gt; Because of this.\n\n622\n00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.900\nI mean, I'm surprised it\nhasn't happened until now.\n\n623\n00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.350\nYeah, because they say, well,\nwe're storing the data,\n\n624\n00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:52.330\nit's encrypted, everything else.\n\n625\n00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.150\nI'm sure it is, but\nencrypted data gets stolen all the time,\n\n626\n00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:58.250\nit still winds up on the web, and people\nfind a way to understand what it is.\n\n627\n00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.400\nSo because you encrypt it doesn't\nmean you're encrypting it strongly.\n\n628\n00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.860\nAnd because you're encrypting it strongly\ndoesn't mean it's strong enough.\n\n629\n00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.330\nAnd these are issues and\n\n630\n00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.140\nconcerns that security professionals\nhave to be involved in.\n\n631\n00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.900\nAnd unfortunately, more often than not,\nwe find in these situations that\n\n632\n00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.750\ncompanies don't employ those professionals\nproperly, early enough in the process\n\n633\n00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:20.540\nto ensure success, and\nthey pay the price after the fact.\n\n634\n00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:24.700\nI'm really hoping I'm wrong about this\none, but I have a sneaking suspicion and\n\n635\n00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.210\na burning suspicion that I'm\ngoing to be proved to be right.\n\n636\n00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.510\nIt's only a matter of time.\n\n637\n00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.950\nSo anyways, as I was saying,\nsensitive personal data.\n\n638\n00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:34.320\nArticles 9 and\n10 in the GDPR speak to this specifically.\n\n639\n00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.590\nThings like biometric and biomarker data\nof a variety of types is now included,\n\n640\n00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.250\nand rightly so\nis protected here under the GDPR.\n\n641\n00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:45.450\nHopefully this will extend out\nto other areas over time, but\n\n642\n00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.280\nsensitive personal data is a category.\n\n643\n00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.530\nVery important for us to consider and\nthink about as well.\n\n644\n00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, again,\ngreat conversation, great stuff.\n\n645\n00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:54.150\nAs we take our overview look at the GDPR,\n\n646\n00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:57.150\nthe General Data Protection Regulation\nof the EU.\n\n647\n00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.720\nWe appreciate your insight,\n\n648\n00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.220\nwe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n649\n00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.080\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n650\n00:34:04.080 -->

ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:17.603\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.603 --> 00:00:21.252\ntoday we are discussing the General\nData Protection Regulation in the EU.\n\n8\n00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:22.205\nIn this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:26.346\nwe're gonna be taking a look at some of\nthe core principles found in the GDPR.\n\n10\n00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:28.650\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.287\nWelcome, Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:30.457\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much,\n\n13\n00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:35.300\nglad to be here talking about data\nprotection principles underneath the GDPR.\n\n14\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.210\nThe GDPR sets out data protection\nprinciples to establish\n\n15\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.110\nthis framework we've been talking about\nthroughout our overview episodes.\n\n16\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.790\nIf you haven't seen those,\nit wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing for\n\n17\n00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.720\nyou to go back to take a look.\n\n18\n00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.000\nIt's not really necessarily pertinent and\n\n19\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.960\nspecific to this part of\nthe conversation in this one episode.\n\n20\n00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.470\nBut more broadly,\nit really does set the tone for\n\n21\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.890\nall the additional episodes that are gonna\ncome, both now and after this one.\n\n22\n00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.310\nBut the data protection principle set\nout the main responsibilities for\n\n23\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.080\norganizations under the GDPR\nthat we've been speaking to\n\n24\n00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.300\nin many of our episodes under\nthe overview topic area.\n\n25\n00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.070\nWe've talked about several articles,\nArticles 33 through 37 for\n\n26\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.220\ninstance, Articles 9 and 10.\n\n27\n00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.990\nWe're gonna do a little deeper dive\nhere on Article 5 of the GDPR.\n\n28\n00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.486\nThe requirements around how personal\ndata needs to be dealt with and\n\n29\n00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:21.520\nneeds to be monitored and maintained.\n\n30\n00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.990\nWe've spoken about that at length,\nwe'll continue to do that.\n\n31\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.510\nBut the interesting thing is that\nthe GDPR itself does not necessarily deal\n\n32\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.260\nwith these particular principles relating\nto individual's rights in the body.\n\n33\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.130\nThey're dealt with as these articles and\nadditional areas in the legislation\n\n34\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.480\nkind of the backend of the legislation\nas I was talking about.\n\n35\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.770\nYou will see the developed\nthought process here.\n\n36\n00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.572\nBut we have to look a little deeper and\ndig down into some of these areas.\n\n37\n00:01:48.572 --> 00:01:50.580\nGive me just one second,\nwhile we're talking.\n\n38\n00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.210\nI'm just gonna bring that up for\nus so we can take a look.\n\n39\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.770\nI've shown you this in\nsome of the other areas.\n\n40\n00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.720\nI just have to get to the right article\nthat we want to take a look at.\n\n41\n00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.550\nSo just bear with me one\nminute while we do that.\n\n42\n00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.350\nBut the idea here if you wanna join\nme here, it can show you right now.\n\n43\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.010\nSo at the, roughly about 35 to 40 page\n\n44\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.630\nmark in the document of 88 pages,\nwe see Chapter 1, General Provisions,\n\n45\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.170\nArticle 1, kinda starting and\ndeal with these articles being developed.\n\n46\n00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.680\nAnd as we go down, Material scope and\nTerritorial scope,\n\n47\n00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.930\nthese are just the basics,\nthen we have definitions.\n\n48\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.153\nUnder the regulation, you'll water\nthe elements we're starting to talk about,\n\n49\n00:02:29.153 --> 00:02:32.952\npersonal data for instance,\nprocessing, restriction of, profiling,\n\n50\n00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:35.504\npseudonominization, that\nterm you love to use.\n\n51\n00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:36.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And you can see the spelling,\n\n52\n00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.480\nas I talked about there.\n\n53\n00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.740\nAll the terms in the regulation, a lot of\nthem we've defined in the General Overview\n\n54\n00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.430\nepisodes, are all here in this area under\nArticle Four, and then as we go down,\n\n55\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.450\nthis is essentially just the vocabulary\nlist, right, for the GDPR.\n\n56\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.880\nVery important to take\na look at all of this,\n\n57\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.960\nthis supervisory authority, what it is,\nall right, how it's made up.\n\n58\n00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.180\nAnd then we get to article five,\n\n59\n00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.920\nprinciples relating to\nprocessing of personal data.\n\n60\n00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.340\nWhen we talk about about principles, we're\ngonna focus on Article 5 as one example,\n\n61\n00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.638\nwe're talking about the development of\nthese stock processes within the framework\n\n62\n00:03:08.638 --> 00:03:09.313\nof the GDPR.\n\n63\n00:03:09.313 --> 00:03:13.406\nBut they're laid out here as you\ncould see in Chapter 2 in this case,\n\n64\n00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:17.289\nin this principle lateral to\nthe actual legislation of the GDPR,\n\n65\n00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.420\nor the actual body of the document.\n\n66\n00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.320\nThese are all supporting elements that\nbring to life and add the capabilities and\n\n67\n00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.380\nthe deep protections\nthat we are looking at.\n\n68\n00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.430\nSo, the most significant one is\nprobably the accountability principle.\n\n69\n00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.600\nThe accountability principle\naround the idea that we as\n\n70\n00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.240\neither processors and/or controllers,\n\n71\n00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.200\nessentially the business end that is\ngathering the data from the data subjects.\n\n72\n00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.260\nMonitoring it, managing it,\nmaintaining it.\n\n73\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.050\nWe have to comply with\nthese principles and\n\n74\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.650\nshow documented irrefutable\nevidence of the fact, right?\n\n75\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.200\nThat we are doing.\n\n76\n00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.490\nSo, it's also very important for\nus to be thinking about that.\n\n77\n00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.010\nWe have to document the decisions we\ntake under processing activities and\n\n78\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.540\nvalidate them, and have them available\nshould we need to provide that proof.\n\n79\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.844\nAnd so, I wanted to go through and\njust talk about personal data,\n\n80\n00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:04.660\nhow it is defined under Article 5.\n\n81\n00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.760\nWe can take a look at it here certainly,\n\n82\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.220\nif you give me a second\nwe'll just blow this up.\n\n83\n00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.256\nProbably going into the source is just as\ngood as going to the Notepad file that I\n\n84\n00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:14.121\nhad where-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:14.854\n&gt;&gt; I just reproduced everything.\n\n86\n00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:17.944\n&gt;&gt; So, give me just a second,\nwe'll talk about it while I'm talking.\n\n87\n00:04:17.944 --> 00:04:21.357\nHere I'm just gonna zoom in a little bit,\nlet's make it a little bit bigger for you,\n\n88\n00:04:21.357 --> 00:04:22.236\njust so that you can.\n\n89\n00:04:22.236 --> 00:04:25.273\nYou'll see that just a little bit easier,\nand that way as we scroll down it's\n\n90\n00:04:25.273 --> 00:04:27.530\nprobably a little bit easier for\nyou to read, all right.\n\n91\n00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.118\nAll right, so under Article 5,\n\n92\n00:04:29.118 --> 00:04:31.917\nPrinciples relating to\nthe processing of personal data.\n\n93\n00:04:31.917 --> 00:04:35.379\nAs one of the examples of the articles\nthat really developed for\n\n94\n00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.449\nus to the principles rather,\nthat really developed for\n\n95\n00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.848\nus how we are protecting ourselves and\nthe protections we enjoy under the GDPR.\n\n96\n00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:45.516\nI thought it would be a good idea\nto look at the principles relating\n\n97\n00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:46.835\nthe processing personal data.\n\n98\n00:04:46.835 --> 00:04:51.275\nSo, Personal data shall be, right,\n(a) processed lawfully as you could\n\n99\n00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:55.390\nsee fairly and in a transparent matter\nin relation to the data subject.\n\n100\n00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.160\nSo we know the data subject is the user,\nright, the person who owns the data.\n\n101\n00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.000\nAnd process lawfully, fairly,\nand in a transparent matter.\n\n102\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.580\nAnd we've spoken about all of these,\nright?\n\n103\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.373\nEspecially transparency with\nthe requirement to opt in and to alert\n\n104\n00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:12.112\nthe data owner, the data subject, as to\nwhat the requirements for collection are.\n\n105\n00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:14.469\nWhat the needs are that\nwe are servicing and\n\n106\n00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:16.770\nwhat the usage of that\ndata is going to be.\n\n107\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.040\nSo we spoken to and talked about this.\n\n108\n00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.060\nCollected for specified explicit and\nlegitimate purposes and\n\n109\n00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.470\nnot further processed in a manner that\nis incompatible with these purposes.\n\n110\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.670\nWe have talked about this as well.\n\n111\n00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.982\nHey, you want my data for\nthese three reasons, if I opt in,\n\n112\n00:05:29.982 --> 00:05:33.140\nyou can have my data,\nuse it for those three reasons.\n\n113\n00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.900\nStop, period, end of sentence and\nthe processing.\n\n114\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.670\nNothing else goes on, no funny\nbusiness back over here with my data.\n\n115\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.834\nRight, you're not gonna sell it\nto another company or entity and\n\n116\n00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:46.286\nallow them to use it without my\npermission, without my knowledge, and\n\n117\n00:05:46.286 --> 00:05:50.020\nwithout a declared, specified agenda\nthat I have opted into up front.\n\n118\n00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.090\nBecause that's no longer\nacceptable under the GDPR.\n\n119\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.552\nFurther processing for archiving purposes\nin the public interest, scientific or\n\n120\n00:05:57.552 --> 00:06:00.995\nhistorical research purposes or\nstatistical purposes shall,\n\n121\n00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:03.690\nin accordance with side article,\nArticle 89.\n\n122\n00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.059\nYou obviously have to scroll down towards\nthe end of the document to find that,\n\n123\n00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:10.836\nsubset one, Article 89(1), so 89 subset\none, not be considered, shall not be\n\n124\n00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:14.600\nconsidered to be incompatible with the\ninitial purposes, (purpose limitation).\n\n125\n00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.400\nIn other words, there are certain\nadditional activities that the processor\n\n126\n00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.590\nand the entity perhaps that\nthe controller has outsourced to,\n\n127\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.340\nwhatever that is, we call them processors.\n\n128\n00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.990\nBut that direct or\nindirect relationship and\n\n129\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.910\nthen the use of the data by that processor\ncan be extended beyond the initial\n\n130\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.810\ngrant of opt-in from the user for\ncertain very well-defined purposes,\n\n131\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.500\narchiving information for\nthe public interest.\n\n132\n00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.150\nFor instance, census data,\nright, in the US anyway.\n\n133\n00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.440\nNot every country does it and\ncalls it the same thing.\n\n134\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.550\nBut in the US, every 10 years,\nhistorically going back several hundred\n\n135\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.540\nyears at this point, we have had the\nability, or at least over a hundred years,\n\n136\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.705\nwe've had the ability to be able\nto as a country, mandated by law.\n\n137\n00:07:00.705 --> 00:07:01.295\nRight?\n\n138\n00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:05.245\nWe go out and we collect data\non the growth of the population,\n\n139\n00:07:05.245 --> 00:07:09.345\nthe demographics, the ethnic makeup,\nthe religious makeup,\n\n140\n00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:13.085\nthe socioeconomic makeup of the people\nthat live in the United States.\n\n141\n00:07:13.085 --> 00:07:17.793\nThat's done on a rolling basis every\n10 years and it is used, that data,\n\n142\n00:07:17.793 --> 00:07:21.232\nto fund and\nto drive a variety of government programs,\n\n143\n00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.650\nand allocations for those programs.\n\n144\n00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.640\nAnd resources that are controlled by the\nfederal government, and then detailed and\n\n145\n00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.260\npushed down into the local and\nstate areas.\n\n146\n00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.240\nGathering data for that reason,\nunder the GDPR, and then archiving it for\n\n147\n00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.980\nfurther use would be acceptable, even\nthough perhaps we did not get everybody to\n\n148\n00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.260\nopt in to every one of those\nuses I just described.\n\n149\n00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.250\nSo that would be an acceptable additional\n\n150\n00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.150\nitem under the principles\nwe're defining here.\n\n151\n00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.670\nThings like scientific or\nhistorical research.\n\n152\n00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.800\nSo again, your stuff for\n\n153\n00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.370\nthe common good in public interest\ncan be serious being acceptable here.\n\n154\n00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.055\nSo, good to know that\nthat exception exist.\n\n155\n00:07:58.055 --> 00:08:00.640\n(c) adequate, relevant and\nlimited to, meaning data,\n\n156\n00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.930\npersonal data collected should be\nadequate, relevant and limited to\n\n157\n00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.980\nwhat's necessary in relation of purpose or\npurposes for which they are processed.\n\n158\n00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.260\nData minimization.\n\n159\n00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.670\nDon't gather more data\nthan what say we need and\n\n160\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.630\nwhat we actually need based on that.\n\n161\n00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.060\nIf you don't need my driver's license\nnumber, if you don't need my telephone\n\n162\n00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.150\nnumber, if you don't need my date\nof birth, then don't ask me for it.\n\n163\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.530\nBecause there's no reason\nwhy you should have it, and\n\n164\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:30.200\nno reason why you should be keeping it and\nI should have to worry as the data subject\n\n165\n00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.720\nabout you storing it securely,\ncuz you're not gonna use it.\n\n166\n00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.410\nSo what's the purpose of you\ncollecting it in the first place?\n\n167\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:40.410\nI love when I see these forms that are a\nmile long, and every question is required.\n\n168\n00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.230\nI mean, you don't have something\nthat worthwhile for me, I'm sorry.\n\n169\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.780\nI'm just not opting in, right.\n\n170\n00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.450\nYou don't need to know what I had for\nbreakfast five days ago.\n\n171\n00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.450\nThat's not part of\nthe data gathering regime.\n\n172\n00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.170\nSo when we do these things we got to\nbe smart and think about this, right?\n\n173\n00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.950\nAnd this is not just, hey, you shouldn't\nknow everything about everybody.\n\n174\n00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:57.890\nNow it's a business,\n\n175\n00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.375\nwe have to think the more data I gathered\nthe more liability I posses and the more\n\n176\n00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:07.195\nfinancial penalty and pain there may be if\nI don't live up to my end of the bargain.\n\n177\n00:09:07.195 --> 00:09:11.241\nData minimization in other words\nis a risk mitigation strategy for\n\n178\n00:09:11.241 --> 00:09:14.998\nthe data processor, and\ncollector, and overseer, right,\n\n179\n00:09:14.998 --> 00:09:19.782\nfunction as well as for, and on behalf\nof the data owner to safeguard our data.\n\n180\n00:09:19.782 --> 00:09:22.676\nIt works both ways, it's good for\neverybody, in other words, right,\n\n181\n00:09:22.676 --> 00:09:23.752\nwhen we think about that.\n\n182\n00:09:23.752 --> 00:09:26.867\n(d) accurate and,\nwhere necessary, kept up to date.\n\n183\n00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:28.607\nThat's the integrity piece\nwe keep talking about.\n\n184\n00:09:28.607 --> 00:09:32.177\nWe have to ensure that data is not\nmodified without knowledge and consent.\n\n185\n00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:34.649\nBut also the data is as accurate\nas possible, it's very important.\n\n186\n00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:41.660\nEvery reasonable step must be taken to\nensure that personal data is accurate and\n\n187\n00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.110\nthe fit is inaccurate.\n\n188\n00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.292\nHaving regard of the purposes for\nwhich they are processed are erased or\n\n189\n00:09:46.292 --> 00:09:47.870\nrectified without delay.\n\n190\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.670\nMeaning, if we come to know as\na processor or a controller is made\n\n191\n00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:57.290\naware through the process or relationship\nor from the Data Protection Officer app\n\n192\n00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.040\nas we are reporting, as we've\ntalked about on overview episodes.\n\n193\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.390\nAny or all of those, any one of them\npoints out the data is known to be error,\n\n194\n00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.430\nin error,\nin other words that data is not accurate.\n\n195\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.720\nThen we have a responsibility\nto erase the data or rectify it.\n\n196\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.020\nWe're not saying you have to\ndelete it because it's wrong.\n\n197\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.588\nWe're saying that you have to correct it.\n\n198\n00:10:16.588 --> 00:10:18.490\nIf you can't correct it, delete it.\n\n199\n00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.290\nRight, it's up to you to\ndecide how to deal with it.\n\n200\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.293\nBut the point is, you cannot leave\ndata that is known to be inaccurate in\n\n201\n00:10:24.293 --> 00:10:26.720\nthe system and just allow it to sit there.\n\n202\n00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.590\nThat is not appropriate, right.\n\n203\n00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:34.180\nAll right, so then we have form instrument\nidentification of data subjects for no\n\n204\n00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.510\nlonger that is necessary for the purposes\nfor which the personal data are process.\n\n205\n00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.600\nIn other words, think about data\nretention per we keeping it for,\n\n206\n00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.460\nwe have to be able to uniquely\nidentify the subject during that time.\n\n207\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.940\nBut after that time, we should not be able\nto because we no longer have the right and\n\n208\n00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.440\nthe ability to use that data.\n\n209\n00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.470\nPersonal data may be stored for\nlonger periods.\n\n210\n00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:57.070\nInsofar as the personal data will be\nprocessed solely for archiving purposes,\n\n211\n00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.870\nagain, and\nthe public interest things like that.\n\n212\n00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:03.930\nSo, in other words, do we have the right,\nunder the GDPR, to gather data?\n\n213\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.060\nClearly define the purpose,\nget consent, use it for that period and\n\n214\n00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.470\nthat purpose, but then keep it longer?\n\n215\n00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.580\nWell yes, if it's in the public interest,\nnarrowly defined, we can extend the usage\n\n216\n00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.063\nof and the storage of and the management\nof that data securely and properly.\n\n217\n00:11:20.063 --> 00:11:24.914\nAnd we can do so subject to Article 89\nsubsection one, and making sure that we\n\n218\n00:11:24.914 --> 00:11:29.563\nare applying the proper controls and\npermissions to safeguard that data.\n\n219\n00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:32.239\nSubject to implementation of\nthe appropriate technical and\n\n220\n00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:35.965\norganizational measures required by this\nregulation or to safeguard the rights and\n\n221\n00:11:35.965 --> 00:11:37.620\nfreedoms of the data subject.\n\n222\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.200\nIn other words, we should have\nwell-defined, as we talked about in\n\n223\n00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.800\nthe overview, storage policies and\nlimitations on time of use.\n\n224\n00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.170\nBut we can extend those in the public\ninterest in certain circumstances provided\n\n225\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.680\nwe are then assigning the appropriate\nprotections and rolling them forward.\n\n226\n00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.950\nAgain, good to know, right?\n\n227\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.930\nProceed in a manner that ensures\nappropriate security of the personal data.\n\n228\n00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:00.960\nWell, we know that.\n\n229\n00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.130\nIncluding protection against\nunauthorized or unlawful processing.\n\n230\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.700\nAnd against accidental loss, destruction,\nor damage, using appropriate,\n\n231\n00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.440\nagain, I talked about this, right?\n\n232\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.720\nAppropriate technical or\norganizational measures.\n\n233\n00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.590\nWhat does that mean?\n\n234\n00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.050\nWell, subset there,\nintegrity and confidentiality.\n\n235\n00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.710\nOkay, but\nthat doesn't really tell me, hey,\n\n236\n00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:20.540\nI should encrypt using\nRSA 2,048-bit protection.\n\n237\n00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.590\nIt says appropriate technical or\norganizational measures.\n\n238\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.190\nSo, again, open to interpretation\nof the entity, the controller,\n\n239\n00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.310\nthe processor that is doing this.\n\n240\n00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.250\nBut it's gonna meet the burden of proof,\nright?\n\n241\n00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.480\nIf we say we encrypted using WEP, right?\n\n242\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.751\nProbably not gonna meet\nthe burden of proof, right?\n\n243\n00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:41.260\nRC4, the 24-bit IV, right,\nis not gonna cut it.\n\n244\n00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.590\nYou gotta do something a little bit more\nstructurally sound and significant, right?\n\n245\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.070\n&gt;&gt; Also, it gives us a little\nbit of flexibility as well.\n\n246\n00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.420\nBecause what's secure today,\nwe know might not be secured next year.\n\n247\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.979\n&gt;&gt; Or may not be at some point in\nthe future during the retention period,\n\n248\n00:12:54.979 --> 00:12:56.273\nmaybe not necessarily next year.\n\n249\n00:12:56.273 --> 00:12:58.173\nBut within the life cycle of that data,\nvery,\n\n250\n00:12:58.173 --> 00:12:59.793\nvery important to think about as well.\n\n251\n00:12:59.793 --> 00:13:03.389\nAnd so you could see if we were\ntocontinue down lawfulness of processing.\n\n252\n00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:05.531\nHow do we define that Article 6,\nand so on.\n\n253\n00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:07.487\nThere's this general principles and\n\n254\n00:13:07.487 --> 00:13:11.825\nthen supporting elements that are built-in\nin the GDPR and we have to if we're gonna\n\n255\n00:13:11.825 --> 00:13:14.777\nbecome practitioners,\nwe're gonna behold into this.\n\n256\n00:13:14.777 --> 00:13:16.817\nOr we're gonna be IT script\nof professionals and\n\n257\n00:13:16.817 --> 00:13:19.400\nhave to help companies\nnavigate through these waters.\n\n258\n00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.310\nWe're gonna have to spend time\nreally digging into this document\n\n259\n00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.250\nunderstanding the language.\n\n260\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.507\nIt's not enough just to go through\nan overview and say, yeah, okay,\n\n261\n00:13:25.507 --> 00:13:26.664\nAdam said that we're good, right.\n\n262\n00:13:26.664 --> 00:13:28.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We know everything we need to know.\n\n263\n00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.100\nThere's a lot of subtlety that\ngoes on in these principles, and\n\n264\n00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.230\nthe principles are really\nwhere the magic happens.\n\n265\n00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.120\nIt's where our rights are enshrined.\n\n266\n00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.577\nIt's where our responsibilities\nare detailed and\n\n267\n00:13:38.577 --> 00:13:42.177\nit's where our focuses practitioners\nneeds to be in order to ensure we're\n\n268\n00:13:42.177 --> 00:13:44.933\ncomplying appropriately with\nthese particular items.\n\n269\n00:13:44.933 --> 00:13:47.803\nCuz we have to have knowledge of\nthem to do so in a significant and\n\n270\n00:13:47.803 --> 00:13:49.570\nappropriate way.\n\n271\n00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.340\nArticle 5 Subset 2 was just there.\n\n272\n00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.642\nWe can go back for just a second.\n\n273\n00:13:52.642 --> 00:13:55.740\nWe kinda left off, I didn't get\na chance to note that, but right here,\n\n274\n00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.470\ncontroller shall be responsible for and\n\n275\n00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.440\nbe able to demonstrate compliance with\nparagraph 1 accountability, right?\n\n276\n00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.060\nThat squarely as we talked about\nputs the burden, the regulatory and\n\n277\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.960\nthe financial penalty-based burden\nthat you and I talked about and\n\n278\n00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.840\nthat we described in the overviews\nin the lap of the controller.\n\n279\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.652\nRight, unequivocal there.\n\n280\n00:14:14.652 --> 00:14:16.347\nThe controller shall be responsible for\nand\n\n281\n00:14:16.347 --> 00:14:18.310\nbe able to demonstrate compliance with.\n\n282\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.170\nWe said the controller has to hold\nthe processors accountable and\n\n283\n00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.590\nis responsible for them.\n\n284\n00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.700\nThere's plenty of penalty to go around for\nboth, right, but\n\n285\n00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.700\nultimately we're gonna lay that\nburden at the feet of the controller.\n\n286\n00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.420\nSo we need again unequivocally understand\nthat as one of the principles here, and\n\n287\n00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.336\nwe tried to make that\nclear during your review.\n\n288\n00:14:35.336 --> 00:14:37.928\nBut one of the point that out and\nmake sure you're aware of it here as well.\n\n289\n00:14:37.928 --> 00:14:42.510\nSo Article 5 lays out the principles for\nthe rights and the protection\n\n290\n00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.830\nassociated with the usage of personal\ndata with regards to the data subject.\n\n291\n00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.695\nImportant to go through and\ntake a look at this.\n\n292\n00:14:48.695 --> 00:14:49.655\nJust one of the principles.\n\n293\n00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:51.295\nWe could drill down and\ndo this for any of them.\n\n294\n00:14:51.295 --> 00:14:54.785\nBut I thought this was a really good one\nto really kind of discuss and sample and\n\n295\n00:14:54.785 --> 00:14:56.295\ndemonstrate and walk-through with you.\n\n296\n00:14:56.295 --> 00:15:00.315\nBecause it lays out the foundation for\nall the other conversations either we have\n\n297\n00:15:00.315 --> 00:15:04.165\nhad, or will take a look at and\nhave around all the different rights.\n\n298\n00:15:04.165 --> 00:15:07.905\nThe eight rights that are declared and\ndefined in the GDPR specific for\n\n299\n00:15:07.905 --> 00:15:09.005\nus as individuals.\n\n300\n00:15:09.005 --> 00:15:11.480\nOr we're gonna drill down on each one and\nhave things to say about them.\n\n301\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.905\nThe right to be forgotten.\n\n302\n00:15:12.905 --> 00:15:14.270\nAll the kind of stuff\nthat we've talked about.\n\n303\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.670\nThe right to protection,\nlimitations from automated processing.\n\n304\n00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.470\nWe've called out a bunch of these rights.\n\n305\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.150\nWe'll go through and take a look at\neach one in turn, in upcoming episodes.\n\n306\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.114\nBut I thought it was a good idea to\ncall out the principles overall and\n\n307\n00:15:25.114 --> 00:15:28.191\nfocus on this one to give us a better\nsense of where we're coming from.\n\n308\n00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:32.172\nAnd really the importance of this document\nand the need to read through not just\n\n309\n00:15:32.172 --> 00:15:36.215\nthe first several pages, but really read\nthrough the entire document to see all\n\n310\n00:15:36.215 --> 00:15:39.377\nthe various pieces that are there and\nhow they come together.\n\n311\n00:15:39.377 --> 00:15:41.320\nIt's a very complicated mosaic.\n\n312\n00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.937\nAnd it requires a lot of time and\nattention to detail to really understand\n\n313\n00:15:44.937 --> 00:15:47.489\nour liabilities but\nalso our responsibilities and\n\n314\n00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:50.885\nour opportunities that exist under\nthe GDPR process individuals.\n\n315\n00:15:50.885 --> 00:15:53.742\nWhether we are in the processor,\nthe controller,\n\n316\n00:15:53.742 --> 00:15:57.540\nthe DPO, data protection officer or\ncertainly data subject role.\n\n317\n00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.639\nWe may be one or all of those at certain\npoints given our various roles and\n\n318\n00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:02.467\nthings we do.\n\n319\n00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:05.688\nAnd it's important for us to understand\nwhat the expectations are for any or\n\n320\n00:16:05.688 --> 00:16:06.360\nall of those.\n\n321\n00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.810\nAnd where they come and\nwhy they are stated the way they are.\n\n322\n00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.300\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, great stuff there.\n\n323\n00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.940\nReally good look at principles and\ndata protection principles, and\n\n324\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.480\nwe appreciate your insight and\ninterpretation.\n\n325\n00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.530\nI know I'm looking forward to it, I'm sure\nyou guys are as well, sitting out and\n\n326\n00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.990\nreading the 88 pages\nthat make up the GPDR.\n\n327\n00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.480\nBut we do appreciate it you interpreting\nthem for us and look forward to more\n\n328\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.880\nin-depth coverage as we work our way down\nthrough some of those other articles.\n\n329\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.630\nWe thank you for that,\nhope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n330\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.260\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Mike

00:00:07.328\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:12.130\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.520\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\ngentlemen to your GDPR series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.310\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.240\nIn this episode we will be taking\na look at special topics to focus on.\n\n8\n00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.400\nAnd with us today,\nback in studio we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.340\nHow's it going today Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.380\n&gt;&gt; Going well, going well.\n\n11\n00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.190\nAlways glad to be here with you.\n\n12\n00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.200\nAnd with you and, of course, with me.\n\n13\n00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.220\nCuz without me and all of you, well,\nthere would be nothing to talk about.\n\n14\n00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.792\nAll right, so well actually that's not\ntrue cuz Cherokee got plenty stuff to talk\n\n15\n00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:37.780\nabout, but it may not be pertinent\nto the GPDR, necessarily.\n\n16\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they don't want to hear\nwhat we have to talk about.\n\n17\n00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.126\n&gt;&gt; That's not always the case, you always\nhave interesting stuff to talk about.\n\n18\n00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:45.970\nSo let's talk about the GDPR a little bit,\nor a little bit more.\n\n19\n00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.041\nWe've been talking in prior\nepisodes about the overview.\n\n20\n00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:52.869\nDid a whole series of episode, five of\nthem specifically, really laying down\n\n21\n00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:56.068\nthe foundational thought processing\nelements around the GDPR.\n\n22\n00:00:56.068 --> 00:01:00.963\nMike and I did those, if you haven't\ntaken a look at those, it would be a good\n\n23\n00:01:00.963 --> 00:01:05.337\nidea for you just to go back,\nget a general sense of what the GDPR is.\n\n24\n00:01:05.337 --> 00:01:07.890\nSee I worked in the word general in there,\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.005\nGeneral sense of that, right?\n\n26\n00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:14.527\nThe data protection rights and legislation\nthat we're talking about with the GDPR,\n\n27\n00:01:14.527 --> 00:01:17.309\nreally laid them out start\nto finish there, right?\n\n28\n00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:20.762\nAnd now that we've done that,\nand we've gone through and\n\n29\n00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:25.273\nlaid out a thought process about\nthe concept of principles within the GDPR,\n\n30\n00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:30.066\nwe did that in the last episode, focused\nand drilled down on one of the principles\n\n31\n00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.190\naround data protection,\nand how we classify data.\n\n32\n00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.505\nTalked a bit about that.\n\n33\n00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:37.897\nWe'll have some other principles\nwe'll talk about as we go through and\n\n34\n00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.848\ndo some deeper dive focuses on\nthe rights that are specified.\n\n35\n00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:43.502\nWe talked about the eight rights that are\nlaid out, guaranteed to the individual.\n\n36\n00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:45.505\nWe'll be going through and\nbreaking those down.\n\n37\n00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:49.910\nAnd we'll bring some of the additional\nprinciples back in as a result of that.\n\n38\n00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.596\nBut we wanna shift gears here for just\na few minutes, at least in this episode\n\n39\n00:01:54.596 --> 00:01:58.983\nanyway, and take a look at some of\nthe special topics to consider.\n\n40\n00:01:58.983 --> 00:02:00.882\nWe air quote a lot in this series.\n\n41\n00:02:00.882 --> 00:02:02.735\nWhenever we're-\n&gt;&gt; I've gotta get my fingers ready and\n\n42\n00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:03.874\nexercise them and get ready?\n\n43\n00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:04.736\n&gt;&gt; You do, you do.\n\n44\n00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:08.417\nSo whenever we're quoting directly\nfrom the legislation, and\n\n45\n00:02:08.417 --> 00:02:11.689\nI often will have to do that\nto talk about certain things,\n\n46\n00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.793\nwe will air quote to signify that we\nactually are using exact language.\n\n47\n00:02:15.793 --> 00:02:18.600\nSo that way people actually have a sense\nof the fact that we're doing that.\n\n48\n00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.550\nAnd you get a little exercise while we're\ntalking so works out well for everybody.\n\n49\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.367\nAll right, this is where finger\npuppets would come in handy, right?\n\n50\n00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:24.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know!\n\n51\n00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.920\n&gt;&gt; So when we're talking about\nsome special topics to consider.\n\n52\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.214\nThings that, although we've mentioned them\nin the overview, are gonna be important,\n\n53\n00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:37.410\nboth as practitioners that are gonna be\nimplementing aspects of GDPR, potentially.\n\n54\n00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.081\nAs advisers to businesses that are gonna\nhave to give guidance or provide\n\n55\n00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:47.302\ninteractive assurance and understanding\naround roles, around definitions.\n\n56\n00:02:47.302 --> 00:02:51.380\nRemember, controller, processor,\ndata protection officer.\n\n57\n00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.805\nWe've talked about a lot of these\nareas already in things that may or\n\n58\n00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:59.380\nmay not have to happen, based on our\nbusiness and the focus the business has.\n\n59\n00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.774\nAnd so,\nwe wanna be thinking about this topic, so\n\n60\n00:03:01.774 --> 00:03:05.309\none of the most important ones that we\nneed to drill back down on a little bit\n\n61\n00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:08.958\nis this concept of lawful processing,\nand what it means to be able to process\n\n62\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.631\ninformation lawfully under the guidelines\nand the directives in the GDPR.\n\n63\n00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:17.622\nFor processing to be lawful, and to be\nconsidered lawful, we have to identify\n\n64\n00:03:17.622 --> 00:03:22.928\nthe need, or the lawful basis, that we're\ngonna process personal data against.\n\n65\n00:03:22.928 --> 00:03:26.869\nSo the controller would have to decide and\ndocument and\n\n66\n00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.447\ndeclare what that lawful basis is.\n\n67\n00:03:29.447 --> 00:03:32.500\nAnd there is guidance around\nwhat lawful basis may be.\n\n68\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.345\nWe'll take a look at\nthat in just in moment.\n\n69\n00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:38.030\nWe'll be looking at Article 6 and drilling\nthough some of the stuff there in Article\n\n70\n00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.325\n9, and\ntalk about some of the clauses there.\n\n71\n00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:43.382\nBut we have to determine\nthe lawful basis for\n\n72\n00:03:43.382 --> 00:03:47.275\npersonal data information gathering and\nprocessing.\n\n73\n00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:51.002\nWe have to document this clearly, talked\nabout the importance of documentation\n\n74\n00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:53.651\nbefore, why it has to be clear,\nwhy it has to be concise.\n\n75\n00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:57.149\nWhy it must be made available and\npotentially be auditable.\n\n76\n00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:01.883\nAnd we have to show that to supervisory\nagency, or provide that if we are going to\n\n77\n00:04:01.883 --> 00:04:06.266\nbe answering a complaint, because we\nperhaps have not been responsive to\n\n78\n00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:10.364\na request, or we have declared that\nwe're not gonna be responsive,\n\n79\n00:04:10.364 --> 00:04:12.680\nwe have to go and show reason why.\n\n80\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.202\nSo we have to have these\ndocumentation available and\n\n81\n00:04:15.202 --> 00:04:18.482\nit has to be in a form that will be\neasily accessible and understood.\n\n82\n00:04:18.482 --> 00:04:23.103\nThis is important because when we think\nabout lawful, and the lawful basis for\n\n83\n00:04:23.103 --> 00:04:27.970\nprocessing, it has an effect on\nthe individual's rights under the GDPR.\n\n84\n00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.487\nSo for instance,\nif we decide that the lawful basis for\n\n85\n00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:36.691\nus to process information is gonna be\nsomeone's consent to process their data.\n\n86\n00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:40.016\nAnd we spoke about consent in\none of the prior episodes,\n\n87\n00:04:40.016 --> 00:04:44.332\nreally went through the logic of why\nwe need consent, what consent is and\n\n88\n00:04:44.332 --> 00:04:47.050\nis not under the definitions in the GDPR.\n\n89\n00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.210\nRemember we need consent that is\ngoing to come from the data subject,\n\n90\n00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.330\nessentially the person who is\ngonna be giving us the data.\n\n91\n00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.210\nAnd it has to be active,\nmeaning the person has to opt in formally.\n\n92\n00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.010\nThey have to, essentially, through their\naction, word, or deed, provide consent.\n\n93\n00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.946\nIt cannot be passive in almost every case.\n\n94\n00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:09.020\nThere is an exception for passive opt in,\nwe talked about that as well.\n\n95\n00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.642\nPrimarily, things like\npre-filled in forms,\n\n96\n00:05:12.642 --> 00:05:16.716\nwhere the user clicks OK, and\nwe accept that as opt in.\n\n97\n00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:20.116\nWhere which we may have done in the past,\nand we often have talked about seeing and\n\n98\n00:05:20.116 --> 00:05:21.240\ndoing on the web.\n\n99\n00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.560\nThat's not an acceptable form\nin most cases these days.\n\n100\n00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.668\nWe would need to instead of prepopulating\nthat form, have that form available but\n\n101\n00:05:28.668 --> 00:05:30.882\nhave have the user fill\nthe information in.\n\n102\n00:05:30.882 --> 00:05:34.339\nAnd through doing that and\nchecking off the box, most importantly,\n\n103\n00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.676\nmost likely at the bottom, or\nyou know where ever the box would be,\n\n104\n00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:41.012\nthat says I acknowledge the terms\nof service, or I acknowledge and\n\n105\n00:05:41.012 --> 00:05:44.197\nconsent to the information being\nlaid out here and explained.\n\n106\n00:05:44.197 --> 00:05:46.060\nWhatever the language would be.\n\n107\n00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.437\nThe user has to actively opt in by\ndoing that and then clicking OK or\n\n108\n00:05:50.437 --> 00:05:55.869\nproviding the submission for that data for\nus to consider that to be acceptable.\n\n109\n00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:00.419\nAnd so when we think about something\nlike relying on the user's consent, or\n\n110\n00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.548\nthe data subject's consent\nto process their data,\n\n111\n00:06:03.548 --> 00:06:07.630\nthat's gonna give the user\nstronger rights under the GDPR.\n\n112\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.460\nRights to complain if things\nare not done a certain way.\n\n113\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.720\nRights to a speedy resolution of\nrequests to validate their data.\n\n114\n00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.050\nA right to be forgotten and\n\n115\n00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.740\nessentially to have their data removed,\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n116\n00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.852\nSo we have to think about that because if\nas the processor and as the controller,\n\n117\n00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:30.590\nwe are relying on that right to consent\nas our lawful right to process data.\n\n118\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.610\nWe now have bought into an additional\nseries of rights, accountability, and\n\n119\n00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.530\nresponsibilities, that as the provider and\nthe manager of that information,\n\n120\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.200\nwe actually, now are on the hook for.\n\n121\n00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.210\nSo we do need to be aware of that and\njust want to think about that and\n\n122\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.230\nunderstand that.\n\n123\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.313\nTo that end, if you wanna join me here,\n\n124\n00:06:47.313 --> 00:06:51.436\nlet's take a look at what lawfulness of\nprocessing is defined as in the GDPR.\n\n125\n00:06:51.436 --> 00:06:55.916\nWe're in Article 6 so\nwe're in the document, I'm on page 36,\n\n126\n00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.550\nif you're tracking through there.\n\n127\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.161\nRemember I said there's 88\npages to this legislation,\n\n128\n00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:05.901\nit's a rather lengthy document.\n\n129\n00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:09.739\nSo when we take a look in here, if you do\na quick search, as I did, for Article 6,\n\n130\n00:07:09.739 --> 00:07:12.449\nyou'll come to this and\nyou'll be able to follow along,\n\n131\n00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:14.942\nif you're interested in\nseeing what we're doing.\n\n132\n00:07:14.942 --> 00:07:16.755\nSo lawfulness in processing, right?\n\n133\n00:07:16.755 --> 00:07:19.355\nProcessing shall be lawful only if and\n\n134\n00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:22.067\nto the extent that at least\none of the following applies.\n\n135\n00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:25.458\nSo language stipulates while\nthere's a series of things there,\n\n136\n00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:27.627\nyou can see A through\nF down at the bottom.\n\n137\n00:07:27.627 --> 00:07:31.782\nWe have to have at least one of\nthese particular items applying for\n\n138\n00:07:31.782 --> 00:07:33.328\ndata to be lawful.\n\n139\n00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.308\nSo we have options,\nwhich is the good news.\n\n140\n00:07:35.308 --> 00:07:39.631\nBut along with options, of course, comes\nthe need to validate against at least one\n\n141\n00:07:39.631 --> 00:07:43.831\nof them, and to prove beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that that validation is sound and\n\n142\n00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:46.331\ncan be documented and\naudited, if necessary.\n\n143\n00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:47.989\nThe data subject has given consent,\n\n144\n00:07:47.989 --> 00:07:51.304\nI mentioned this would be one example\nwhere we could see this playing out,\n\n145\n00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.746\nto the processing of their personal\ndata for one or more specific purposes.\n\n146\n00:07:54.746 --> 00:07:56.256\nThey've opted in.\n\n147\n00:07:56.256 --> 00:08:00.228\nBased on our request to collect, and\ndefinition of what the standards for\n\n148\n00:08:00.228 --> 00:08:01.670\ncollection will be.\n\n149\n00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.050\nProcessing is necessary for\n\n150\n00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.790\nthe performance of a contract to\nwhich the data subject is a party.\n\n151\n00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.500\nOr in order to take steps at\nthe request of the data subject,\n\n152\n00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.180\nprior to entering into a contract.\n\n153\n00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.580\nSo again, you'll think about\nthe logic of what we're saying here.\n\n154\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:21.140\nMaybe the person who is the data\nsubject is taking on a loan,\n\n155\n00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.600\nmaybe they are signing up for\na credit card.\n\n156\n00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.050\nMaybe they are signing\na contract with an Internet or\n\n157\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.310\ncloud service provider In some sort of an,\nas a service scenario, right?\n\n158\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.570\nThere's all these things we could think\nof where some sort of contract would\n\n159\n00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.760\nbe executed.\n\n160\n00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.640\nAnd as a result, Cherokee's gonna have\na question cuz I see the wheels spinning.\n\n161\n00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.207\nBut as a result, right,\nwe would then be in a situation where it's\n\n162\n00:08:44.207 --> 00:08:47.074\nthe data subject,\nwe have to provide information for\n\n163\n00:08:47.074 --> 00:08:51.176\nthe contract to be dully processed and\nwe have to provide that information.\n\n164\n00:08:51.176 --> 00:08:54.483\nAnd in order to do that,\nwe would then have to have a processed and\n\n165\n00:08:54.483 --> 00:08:58.177\nit would have to be processed under\nthe concept of lawfulness, right.\n\n166\n00:08:58.177 --> 00:09:02.047\nMeaning, it has to be gathered correctly,\ndocumented correctly, processed correctly,\n\n167\n00:09:02.047 --> 00:09:03.195\nmanaged correctly.\n\n168\n00:09:03.195 --> 00:09:08.535\nSo signing up, or in some sense dealing\nwith a contractual requirement would\n\n169\n00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:12.795\nbe grounds for lawful processing as long\nas both parties have agreed to the terms.\n\n170\n00:09:12.795 --> 00:09:15.765\nAnd it's done under the guise\nof the GDPR correctly, yes?\n\n171\n00:09:15.765 --> 00:09:19.932\n&gt;&gt; Now Adam, I may be over\nthinking this just a little bit.\n\n172\n00:09:19.932 --> 00:09:21.884\nBut, is the regulation,\n\n173\n00:09:21.884 --> 00:09:26.600\ndo I have to comply if this process\nis happening within Europe?\n\n174\n00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.455\nOr what if the actual processing is\nhappening in a different legislation or\n\n175\n00:09:31.455 --> 00:09:35.550\ngeographical area and\nmaybe just the outcome of that process?\n\n176\n00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.450\nMaybe the data or\nforms whatever is stored.\n\n177\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.297\nSo does that have a bearing the actual\ngeographic location of where this contract\n\n178\n00:09:43.297 --> 00:09:45.304\nor the processing is happening?\n\n179\n00:09:45.304 --> 00:09:46.780\nDoes that have a bearing on this?\n\n180\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.850\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so it's a great question.\n\n181\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.976\nWe've actually spoken to\nthis in other episodes.\n\n182\n00:09:49.976 --> 00:09:51.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n183\n00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.240\n&gt;&gt; But it's good to review cuz it's\nnever a bad idea to remind people\n\n184\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.550\nof these particular\nissues from time to time.\n\n185\n00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.972\nSo when we think about this\nparticular legislation or\n\n186\n00:09:59.972 --> 00:10:04.924\neven legislations come before that we\npotentially are replacing with this.\n\n187\n00:10:04.924 --> 00:10:08.245\nSo things like Directive 95/46,\nfor instance,\n\n188\n00:10:08.245 --> 00:10:12.866\nthat we've talked about before which\nessentially is being retrofitted and\n\n189\n00:10:12.866 --> 00:10:17.290\nreplaced by GDPR as we move towards\nthe May 25th deadline in 2018.\n\n190\n00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:22.056\nSo both of those pieces of\nlegislation have been very clear.\n\n191\n00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:26.330\nAnd the EU itself has been very\nclear both in word and in deed.\n\n192\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.858\nThere have been court cases that have\nspoken to this, a very famous one with\n\n193\n00:10:29.858 --> 00:10:33.565\nGoogle and a Spanish citizen around\nthe right to be forgotten, for instance.\n\n194\n00:10:33.565 --> 00:10:37.470\nAnd there are many examples throughout\nother areas in the EU around this.\n\n195\n00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:44.037\nBut the short answer is that any time the\ndata is gathered on a citizen of the EU.\n\n196\n00:10:44.037 --> 00:10:47.103\nWhether it is a business that is\nbased in the geographic boundary or\n\n197\n00:10:47.103 --> 00:10:49.949\npolitical boundaries of the EU or\na business that is outside,\n\n198\n00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:52.250\nanywhere in the world as you suggested.\n\n199\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.260\nThat business has an obligation\nto follow the law or\n\n200\n00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.910\nfollow the regulations in play in this\ncase as we transition into the GDPR.\n\n201\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:07.375\nThey would be following either currently\n95/46 or GDPR as of May of 2018.\n\n202\n00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:12.122\nBut either way, they would have to follow\nthose requirements if they want to\n\n203\n00:11:12.122 --> 00:11:14.421\nhold that data, and safeguard it and\n\n204\n00:11:14.421 --> 00:11:18.810\nprocess it in their systems outside\nof the boundaries of the EU.\n\n205\n00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.030\nOr, if they're based in the EU either\nway they're still subject to that.\n\n206\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.770\nThere may be some exclusionary clauses and\nopt-outs opt-ins for businesses.\n\n207\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.300\nThings like safe harbor which you and\nI talked about in other episodes.\n\n208\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:36.543\nOr the new equivalence of safe harbor that\nmay be negotiated that will allow for\n\n209\n00:11:36.543 --> 00:11:41.663\nthe logic of a company under\nthe guys of the national agreement.\n\n210\n00:11:41.663 --> 00:11:43.942\nMeaning, a company based in the US and\n\n211\n00:11:43.942 --> 00:11:48.298\nthe United States government\nnegotiating this safe harbor exclusion.\n\n212\n00:11:48.298 --> 00:11:51.416\nOr safe harbor clause of\nsome nature would allow for\n\n213\n00:11:51.416 --> 00:11:55.983\nfollowing the spirit as opposed perhaps\nthe letter of the law because a safe\n\n214\n00:11:55.983 --> 00:11:59.130\nharbor clauses tend to\nallow a little more leeway.\n\n215\n00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.276\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; In terms of implementation and\n\n216\n00:12:01.276 --> 00:12:03.680\nunderstanding and guidance.\n\n217\n00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.490\nBecause many countries have said, look,\n\n218\n00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.000\nwe're not members of the EU politically,\nwe're not bound by these laws.\n\n219\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.360\nWe understand the need\nto ascribe to them and\n\n220\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.330\nfollow them-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n221\n00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.430\n&gt;&gt; And uphold them.\n\n222\n00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.123\nBut we're not at the same place,\n\n223\n00:12:16.123 --> 00:12:19.763\nwe don't have the ability to give\nthose same protections, in theory.\n\n224\n00:12:19.763 --> 00:12:22.218\nAnd so,\nwe find them to be too restrictive, right.\n\n225\n00:12:22.218 --> 00:12:26.130\nAnd so as result, we have a problem\nbecause essentially, you're telling us,\n\n226\n00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.330\nas a national entity,\nas a sovereign nation, we have to do this.\n\n227\n00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.750\nAnd maybe we're not comfortable with that.\n\n228\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And so there are some side negotiations\n\n229\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:38.390\nthat go on but we still would see some\nsort of binding to the agreement.\n\n230\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.300\nIt would just typically be a little\nbit looser perhaps than the business\n\n231\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.810\nits based directly in\none of the EU countries.\n\n232\n00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.395\n&gt;&gt; Right, I can see its far\noutreaching further than what I would\n\n233\n00:12:45.395 --> 00:12:46.046\nthink geographically.\n\n234\n00:12:46.046 --> 00:12:49.250\n&gt;&gt; It is, absolutely, and so\nthe short answer would be yes.\n\n235\n00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:54.090\nWe would expect that entities that\nare doing business with any EU nationals\n\n236\n00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.730\nof any substance and\n\n237\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:59.670\nholding that data are gonna be bound\nby these rules in one form or another.\n\n238\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.320\nCompanies that are based\nin any of the EU countries.\n\n239\n00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.145\nThere's really no two ways about it,\nyou have to follow those rules.\n\n240\n00:13:06.145 --> 00:13:09.512\nBut multinationals that have\noffices around the world do,\n\n241\n00:13:09.512 --> 00:13:14.088\nyou'll fall into this area where, yeah,\noverall we have data honor EU citizens\n\n242\n00:13:14.088 --> 00:13:18.869\nlet's say hypothetically maintained only\nwithin the EU, but often times that data\n\n243\n00:13:18.869 --> 00:13:21.867\nbecause of cloud based solutions right-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n244\n00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:23.166\n&gt;&gt; May transit, right?\n\n245\n00:13:23.166 --> 00:13:27.475\nThey may occasionally although we have\ngeographic preferences for hosting and\n\n246\n00:13:27.475 --> 00:13:31.640\nmost likely geographic board of\ndistinctions built into our data hosting.\n\n247\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.530\n&gt;&gt; That may change.\n\n248\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.143\n&gt;&gt; That could change during\na failover event, it could change for\n\n249\n00:13:36.143 --> 00:13:37.446\na variety of reasons.\n\n250\n00:13:37.446 --> 00:13:40.923\nAlthough many governments have become\nvery specific about the fact that\n\n251\n00:13:40.923 --> 00:13:45.090\nthey want data on their national stored\nwithin their borders because of legality.\n\n252\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.141\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And because of requirements around\n\n253\n00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:49.853\nthe implementation of law\nspecific to that data.\n\n254\n00:13:49.853 --> 00:13:54.475\nSo they're worried about the ability\nto authoritatively control the legal\n\n255\n00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:56.435\nenvironment around that data.\n\n256\n00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:59.828\nAnd as a result have, then it become in\nthe last few years very specific about\n\n257\n00:13:59.828 --> 00:14:03.330\nthe fact that they don't want\ndata moving beyond their borders.\n\n258\n00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.345\nBut the reality is,\ndespite everybody's best efforts,\n\n259\n00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:10.156\nthings are very translucent in the sense\nof things do move back and forth,\n\n260\n00:14:10.156 --> 00:14:13.800\nthere's a lot of transparency, but\nthere's also a lot of fluidity.\n\n261\n00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.260\nAnd so we have to just always have to\nbe aware of that and think about that.\n\n262\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.690\nBut it's a really good thought process for\nus to remind ourselves of,\n\n263\n00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.050\nbecause it's a very dynamic\nenvironment that we deal with today.\n\n264\n00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.579\nThis is not analog data on pieces-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n265\n00:14:24.579 --> 00:14:27.772\n&gt;&gt; Of paper in a filing cabinet\nthat somebody has to pick up and\n\n266\n00:14:27.772 --> 00:14:30.770\nphysically transport and\ncan be stopped at a border and\n\n267\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.265\ntake it out of a car in\na box that kind of thing.\n\n268\n00:14:33.265 --> 00:14:36.350\nI mean those days are gone, right, that's\njust not the way we deal with it these.\n\n269\n00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.565\nThese are ones and\n\n270\n00:14:37.565 --> 00:14:43.083\nzeros moving at literally lightning fast\nspeeds across wires around the world.\n\n271\n00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:46.055\nAnd as a result, it's very\ndifficult to stop them at a border,\n\n272\n00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:48.704\nbecause borders just don't\nreally exist the same way.\n\n273\n00:14:48.704 --> 00:14:49.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n274\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.883\n&gt;&gt; The same way that\nthey would physically.\n\n275\n00:14:50.883 --> 00:14:55.318\nInformation knows no boundaries, as we\noften think about in the digital world,\n\n276\n00:14:55.318 --> 00:14:58.665\nand the others know demarcation point and\na passport check.\n\n277\n00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:03.031\nThere's no immigration for cables coming\non and off the coast into the US,\n\n278\n00:15:03.031 --> 00:15:04.219\ninto Europe, etc.\n\n279\n00:15:04.219 --> 00:15:07.392\nYou don't have have some sort of border\npatrol sitting there looking at data\n\n280\n00:15:07.392 --> 00:15:09.517\ngoing through the cable,\nit just it floats.\n\n281\n00:15:09.517 --> 00:15:10.667\nWe don't really acknowledge\nthat [CROSSTALK].\n\n282\n00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:11.710\n&gt;&gt; I wonder what their\nuniforms would look like?\n\n283\n00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.977\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That would be interesting.\n\n284\n00:15:14.977 --> 00:15:19.027\nI would think that they would be shiny and\nshimmery just like all the data, right?\n\n285\n00:15:19.027 --> 00:15:20.094\nKinda like the matrix, right?\n\n286\n00:15:20.094 --> 00:15:21.766\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nMaybe the women in red or something?\n\n287\n00:15:21.766 --> 00:15:24.383\nAll right, so we are going\nthrough dealing with article 6,\n\n288\n00:15:24.383 --> 00:15:27.370\nlooking at lawful processing,\nsome of the stipulations here.\n\n289\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:31.320\nI wanted to call out specifically\nitem c and e in particular,\n\n290\n00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.341\nas we just kind of review this.\n\n291\n00:15:33.341 --> 00:15:38.288\nBecause c and e here, article 6 1,\nsub-article c, sub-article e,\n\n292\n00:15:38.288 --> 00:15:42.665\nare subpoints c and e allow for\na member countries to carve out and\n\n293\n00:15:42.665 --> 00:15:47.789\nintroduce more specific provisions\nin relation to these specific areas.\n\n294\n00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:51.548\nMeaning, it gives member countries\nthe right to ratchet down And\n\n295\n00:15:51.548 --> 00:15:55.939\ntighten these requirements, or\nperhaps deal with them in a different way.\n\n296\n00:15:55.939 --> 00:15:58.874\nAnd we have seen that flexibility in\nsome of the other areas we've been\n\n297\n00:15:58.874 --> 00:16:00.130\ndiscussing as well.\n\n298\n00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:02.650\nSo c, you see here,\nprocessing is necessary for\n\n299\n00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.420\ncompliance with the legal obligation\nto which the controller is subject.\n\n300\n00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.180\nSo the controller may be subject\nto the jurisdictional legal\n\n301\n00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.710\nrequirements of a certain member country.\n\n302\n00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:16.640\nWithin the EU, hypothetically let's\njust say Spain, or let's say France,\n\n303\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.350\nor Germany,\n\n304\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.980\nit doesn't really matter which of the 20\nsome odd member countries we choose.\n\n305\n00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:26.010\nIf one or more of them decide to\nmodify the base concepts here and\n\n306\n00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:30.210\nintroduce additional requirements, then\nthere may be a need to acknowledge and\n\n307\n00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.110\nto adhere to those,\nif we're dealing with a contract or\n\n308\n00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:37.330\ncontractual obligation that crosses\ninto that national territory.\n\n309\n00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.130\nSo we have to be aware of that\nas the controller, because if\n\n310\n00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.750\nthe controller is the subject, they may be\nbound by additional rules or requirements.\n\n311\n00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.717\nSo member states do have flexibility\nwithin the broader framework of the GDPR.\n\n312\n00:16:47.717 --> 00:16:50.930\nWe've made this point before,\nit's important to be aware of.\n\n313\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.530\nProtecting vital interests of the data\nsubject or another natural person.\n\n314\n00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.756\nSo obviously that's important\nsubsection or subitem e here.\n\n315\n00:16:58.756 --> 00:17:03.250\nLet me just scroll down and scroll up so\nyou could see that as well.\n\n316\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.294\nProcessing necessary for the forms of a\ntask carried out in the public interest or\n\n317\n00:17:07.294 --> 00:17:10.580\nin the exercise of official\nauthority vested in the controller.\n\n318\n00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.286\nAgain, by member state,\nthere may be additional distinctions and\n\n319\n00:17:14.286 --> 00:17:16.634\nclarifications that we have to adhere to.\n\n320\n00:17:16.634 --> 00:17:21.170\nAnd these two clauses, c and e, make it\nclear in the sense that when you read them\n\n321\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.642\nand understand them for what they are,\nit calls out that members states may add\n\n322\n00:17:25.642 --> 00:17:29.540\nadditional requirements here and\nwe have to comply with them.\n\n323\n00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.581\nSo it's not just hey, the GDPR says this.\n\n324\n00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:33.840\nThe GDPR says this is a baseline.\n\n325\n00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.999\nBut then if France happens to say,\nin addition we want this, and\n\n326\n00:17:36.999 --> 00:17:40.161\nyou're dealing with an issue\nspecific to the public interest or\n\n327\n00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:44.278\na contractual requirement for a controller\nwithin that particular member state.\n\n328\n00:17:44.278 --> 00:17:47.359\nThere will be additional requirements\nto be considered lawful for\n\n329\n00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:48.580\nprocessing, right?\n\n330\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.107\nSee my air quote there?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n331\n00:17:49.107 --> 00:17:50.655\n&gt;&gt; Lawful for process.\n\n332\n00:17:50.655 --> 00:17:51.964\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Lawfulness for processing.\n\n333\n00:17:51.964 --> 00:17:55.404\nSo we do wanna make sure\nthat we're aware of that and\n\n334\n00:17:55.404 --> 00:17:58.100\nit says down here in item number two.\n\n335\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.870\nSpeaking of what I was just talking about.\n\n336\n00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:03.320\nMember states may maintain or\nintroduce more specific provisions.\n\n337\n00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.346\nThe item I was just speaking to, right,\nadapt the application of the rules here\n\n338\n00:18:07.346 --> 00:18:10.487\nwith regard to processing for\ncompliance with points c and e.\n\n339\n00:18:10.487 --> 00:18:14.530\nThe exact point I was making,\nstated in point two here in paragraph one.\n\n340\n00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.934\nBut determining more precisely\nthe specific requirements,\n\n341\n00:18:17.934 --> 00:18:21.011\nand including other specific\nprocessing situations or\n\n342\n00:18:21.011 --> 00:18:23.835\nstipulations it's provided for\nin chapter nine.\n\n343\n00:18:23.835 --> 00:18:28.440\nYou would go look up chapter nine and see\nthe additional stipulations there, right?\n\n344\n00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.130\nSo if there's a union law or\n\n345\n00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.985\nmember state law to which\nthe controller may be subjected.\n\n346\n00:18:33.985 --> 00:18:36.485\nThat's already on the books\nin one of these countries.\n\n347\n00:18:36.485 --> 00:18:39.085\nThen that would be added as an addition\n\n348\n00:18:39.085 --> 00:18:41.925\non top of the baseline\nthat the GDPR provides.\n\n349\n00:18:41.925 --> 00:18:45.759\nTo be clear, what the GDPR is\nsaying here is not that we're gonna\n\n350\n00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:50.173\ntrump national law within a member\nstate that may already be on the books.\n\n351\n00:18:50.173 --> 00:18:54.055\nBut we're gonna provide a baseline that\nallows member states to then build upon-\n\n352\n00:18:54.055 --> 00:18:54.582\n&gt;&gt; Stack on it.\n\n353\n00:18:54.582 --> 00:18:57.711\n&gt;&gt; And essentially add,\ncumulatively too, provided that\n\n354\n00:18:57.711 --> 00:19:02.015\nit then creates the opportunity for\nlawfulness of processing to go forward but\n\n355\n00:19:02.015 --> 00:19:05.240\nsimply to be aligned with\nthe member state requirements.\n\n356\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.660\nSo it is important for us to be aware\nof that and just have a sense of that.\n\n357\n00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.940\nAll right, so\nwe do have all of those things here.\n\n358\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.590\nWhat about conditions for\nspecial categories of data?\n\n359\n00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:18.400\nWell let's take a look at that, so\nlet's take a look at number nine here,\n\n360\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.900\nso give me just a second.\n\n361\n00:19:21.711 --> 00:19:27.999\nAnd conditions for consent and-\n&gt;&gt; Where\n\n362\n00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:32.793\nprocessing is based on consent, the\ncontroller shall be able to demonstrate\n\n363\n00:19:32.793 --> 00:19:37.677\nthat the data subject has consented to\nprocessing of his or her personal data.\n\n364\n00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:38.960\nI was helping you out.\n\n365\n00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.476\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n366\n00:19:39.476 --> 00:19:40.964\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we got it right there,\n\n367\n00:19:40.964 --> 00:19:42.160\nI just had to search for it.\n\n368\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.880\nAll right, so Article IX,\nright, we just referenced that.\n\n369\n00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.990\nSo conditions for\nspecial categories of data.\n\n370\n00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.900\nWhat would be considered\nspecial categories of data?\n\n371\n00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.400\nHow are we doing to deal with them?\n\n372\n00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.710\nArticle IX deals with this, quite a number\nof these here, before we get to consent.\n\n373\n00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.990\nWe'll talk about consent here as\nanother special item in just a moment,\n\n374\n00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.479\nbut processing special\ncategories of personal data.\n\n375\n00:20:01.479 --> 00:20:03.290\nWe'll just scroll down here.\n\n376\n00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.474\nSo processing of personal data revealing\nracial or ethnic, political opinions,\n\n377\n00:20:06.474 --> 00:20:09.525\nethnic origin, religious philosophical\nbeliefs, trade union membership.\n\n378\n00:20:09.525 --> 00:20:13.980\nThere's all of this stuff\nthat's called out here.\n\n379\n00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:18.775\nData concerning health or natural\nperson sex life or sexual orientation.\n\n380\n00:20:18.775 --> 00:20:22.486\nAny of those things are going\nto be problematic for\n\n381\n00:20:22.486 --> 00:20:24.100\nus in a sense you can see here.\n\n382\n00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.590\nIt is prohibited to process personal data\nin such a way that reveals any of these\n\n383\n00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.312\nkinds of things,\nascribing them uniquely back\n\n384\n00:20:31.312 --> 00:20:35.615\nto the individual creating a mapping\nthat uniquely identifies somebody.\n\n385\n00:20:35.615 --> 00:20:39.199\nNot that information in these categories\nis considered to be a problem, but\n\n386\n00:20:39.199 --> 00:20:43.420\nyou can't hold this information in a way\nthat uniquely singles out an individual.\n\n387\n00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.986\nAnd saying John Smith is\nthis particular opinion or\n\n388\n00:20:47.986 --> 00:20:52.554\nholds this particular opinion\nabout race or religion or\n\n389\n00:20:52.554 --> 00:20:56.551\nhas this particular\npreference in these areas.\n\n390\n00:20:56.551 --> 00:20:59.925\nThat would not be considered lawful\nbecause we're not allowed to single\n\n391\n00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:03.243\nout an individual and make that apparent,\nright, in the gathering and\n\n392\n00:21:03.243 --> 00:21:04.680\nprocessing of our data.\n\n393\n00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.620\nSo we shall not, under paragraph one,\n\n394\n00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.190\napply that standard if one\nof the following applies.\n\n395\n00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.380\nAnd you can see that there's a whole bunch\nof additional items we have to consider.\n\n396\n00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.276\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n397\n00:21:14.276 --> 00:21:17.190\n&gt;&gt; It is pretty cool, but then there's\na lot of opt out or exceptions, right?\n\n398\n00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.840\nSo we just wanna be aware of them.\n\n399\n00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.527\nSo the baseline is yeah look,\nwe're not gonna take any of this kind of\n\n400\n00:21:22.527 --> 00:21:26.614\ndata that in anyway could bias you\nagainst an individual and identify them.\n\n401\n00:21:26.614 --> 00:21:30.931\nAnd put them into an area where they\nmay become the subject of information\n\n402\n00:21:30.931 --> 00:21:35.410\nblackmail, or the subject of perhaps\npersecution or anything like that.\n\n403\n00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:36.710\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And as a result,\n\n404\n00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.420\nwe're gonna safeguard their privacy,\nsafeguard that data, and make sure that\n\n405\n00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.555\nthose things that are unique to them\nthat really are nobody else's business.\n\n406\n00:21:43.555 --> 00:21:44.471\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; For the most part,\n\n407\n00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:47.945\nare not gonna come to light because of\nthe way we're handling information.\n\n408\n00:21:47.945 --> 00:21:51.005\nThat's a good thing but\nthen there are some exceptions, right, and\n\n409\n00:21:51.005 --> 00:21:52.495\nwe call out here a series of them.\n\n410\n00:21:52.495 --> 00:21:54.217\nYou can see underneath.\n\n411\n00:21:54.217 --> 00:21:57.227\nParagraph one shall not apply,\nright, to any of the following.\n\n412\n00:21:57.227 --> 00:22:01.627\nSo the data subject has explicitly given\nconsent for us to use that data in one or\n\n413\n00:22:01.627 --> 00:22:03.906\nmore well defined and documented ways.\n\n414\n00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:09.150\nSo if we go ahead and we're asking\npeople perhaps in some sort of a survey.\n\n415\n00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.680\nAgain, we can go back to the idea\nof maybe an educational institution\n\n416\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.080\ndoing surveying.\n\n417\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.110\nPerhaps, as I mentioned,\n\n418\n00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:20.080\nthe United States, the national census\nthat's done once every ten years.\n\n419\n00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.500\nWe talked about a lot of\nthese other concepts and\n\n420\n00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.950\nexceptional areas in other episodes.\n\n421\n00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:27.450\nJust giving you examples of how\nyou could wrap your head around\n\n422\n00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.500\nwhere some of these exceptions may apply.\n\n423\n00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.380\nMaybe we are doing a medical study, right,\nand as a result of the medical study\n\n424\n00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.670\nthere's a very broad questionnaire\nthat has to be given to people to\n\n425\n00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.270\nfind out a lot of information about\nthem so we know and profile them.\n\n426\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.310\nSo we know whether or not we can allow\nthem to participate in the study\n\n427\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.520\nbased on all sorts of factors\nwe may be looking for.\n\n428\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:51.380\nThere's a lot of reasons why you could\nsee the data on that paragraph one list,\n\n429\n00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.450\nelements of it may become very important\nin certain situations where we would have\n\n430\n00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.850\nto know about those things.\n\n431\n00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.610\nSo we have to create exceptions\nin order to deal with that.\n\n432\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.680\nSo if the subject has given\nexplicit consent, yeah,\n\n433\n00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.922\nI want to be a part of that study.\n\n434\n00:23:02.922 --> 00:23:05.193\nI'm gonna opt in or\nallow you to gather this data.\n\n435\n00:23:05.193 --> 00:23:09.872\nI understand you're asking data of a\npersonal nature that may uniquely identify\n\n436\n00:23:09.872 --> 00:23:11.950\nme but I'm okay with that, right?\n\n437\n00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.992\nWe've kind of negotiated the terms\nabout how you're going to manage that,\n\n438\n00:23:14.992 --> 00:23:17.620\nI've been made aware of the do's and\ndon'ts and I'm opting in.\n\n439\n00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.280\nIn that case the GDPR says okay,\nno problem, right?\n\n440\n00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.631\nWe can do that as long\nas we understand that.\n\n441\n00:23:23.631 --> 00:23:27.555\nAnd it says though except where a union or\nmember state law.\n\n442\n00:23:27.555 --> 00:23:30.385\nTraditionally what we're really thinking\nabout is more member state law.\n\n443\n00:23:30.385 --> 00:23:33.362\nProvides that the prohibition referred\nto in paragraph one may not be lifted.\n\n444\n00:23:33.362 --> 00:23:37.968\nMeaning, hey we can opt in,\nthe GDPR says, but if there's a law on\n\n445\n00:23:37.968 --> 00:23:43.090\nthe books that says there's no way\nthat we're gonna allow you to do this.\n\n446\n00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.718\nThat law trumps our ability\nto opt-in as a data subject.\n\n447\n00:23:45.718 --> 00:23:48.734\nSo it can be very complex as\nwe delve into the article.\n\n448\n00:23:48.734 --> 00:23:52.107\nThe master point and\nthen the sub points that exclude and\n\n449\n00:23:52.107 --> 00:23:56.289\ncreate protected classes around that\nsub point or set of sub points.\n\n450\n00:23:56.289 --> 00:24:00.460\nThere's a lot of winding and turning and\nkinda backing and forthing here, right?\n\n451\n00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.189\nBecause we have to really be on our game,\nwe have to pay\n\n452\n00:24:03.189 --> 00:24:07.254\nattention to every one of these line\nitems and understand the stipulation, but\n\n453\n00:24:07.254 --> 00:24:10.990\nthen understand the scenarios\nwhere they may or may not apply.\n\n454\n00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.010\nSo we've essentially created a series\nof protected classes of information.\n\n455\n00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.680\nWe've now gone ahead and said there\nare exclusions, but we've also said,\n\n456\n00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.160\nif there's already laws that prohibit\nexclusion, then those laws will apply and\n\n457\n00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.350\nopting in will not be allowed.\n\n458\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.980\nSo, it's a fairly complicated regulatory\nlandscape that we're starting to develop\n\n459\n00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.520\nand look at here, right?\n\n460\n00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.870\nB processing is necessary for\nthe purposes carrying out obligations and\n\n461\n00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:37.220\nexercises specific rights\nof the controller.\n\n462\n00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.050\nAgain, or the data subject, right?\n\n463\n00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.440\nIn the field of employment,\nSocial Security,\n\n464\n00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.590\nsocial protection law,\nthings of that nature.\n\n465\n00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.870\nAgain, as so far, insofar as authorized\nby union or member state law, or\n\n466\n00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.850\nsome sort of collective agreement for\nappropriate safeguards.\n\n467\n00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:55.250\nMeaning, if this becomes\nan issue where we have to\n\n468\n00:24:55.250 --> 00:25:00.620\nhave this information in order to be able\nto give you certain protections or rights.\n\n469\n00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.120\nThings like social security benefits,\nretirement benefits, health benefits,\n\n470\n00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.770\nyou can imagine any of those kind of\nthings that may be associated with this.\n\n471\n00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.660\nThen that is going to be allowed\nbecause the government's gonna\n\n472\n00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.950\nact in your best interests or\nthe group that's gonna gather this\n\n473\n00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.770\nis gonna act in your best interest\nto provide access to those benefits.\n\n474\n00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.165\nSo as a result we would\nwant to allow that, right?\n\n475\n00:25:20.165 --> 00:25:23.215\nProcessing necessary to protect vital\ninterests in the data subject or\n\n476\n00:25:23.215 --> 00:25:24.665\nanother natural person, item c,\n\n477\n00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:28.775\nwhere the data subject is physically or\nlegally incapable of giving consent.\n\n478\n00:25:28.775 --> 00:25:33.290\nSo again, maybe somebody is incapacitated,\nthey have somebody acting on their behalf.\n\n479\n00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.200\nMaybe you've been hurt\nhorribly in an accident.\n\n480\n00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.800\nWe never want that to happen of course.\n\n481\n00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.520\nBut let's just hypothetically say that\nyou're incapable of giving consent.\n\n482\n00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.680\nSomebody operating under your behalf,\nright?\n\n483\n00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.480\nWe may or may not have that.\n\n484\n00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.024\nSo we may have to be able to opt in to\ngive people this information to facilitate\n\n485\n00:25:49.024 --> 00:25:49.687\nhelping you.\n\n486\n00:25:49.687 --> 00:25:53.566\nSo we want these exceptions parked up\nbecause they make sense when you stop and\n\n487\n00:25:53.566 --> 00:25:54.530\nthink about them.\n\n488\n00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.059\nBut it's awareness of these\nexceptions as practitioners,\n\n489\n00:25:58.059 --> 00:26:02.419\nawareness of these exceptions as IT and\nsecurity professionals that maybe\n\n490\n00:26:02.419 --> 00:26:07.420\noperating in this world that hello, that's\ngonna be important for us to be aware of.\n\n491\n00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:07.930\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n492\n00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:12.330\nI'm just thinking, all right, would it,\nmaybe be a good example to say, hey,\n\n493\n00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.990\nif I were laying in the hospital and\nneeded a blood transfusion.\n\n494\n00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:19.550\nMaybe I had lost a lot of blood and they\ndon't know what kind of my blood type is.\n\n495\n00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.420\nSo do they have the authority\nto either look at my records or\n\n496\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.090\nobtain that information\nbefore providing that?\n\n497\n00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.378\n&gt;&gt; Would be a real good example.\n\n498\n00:26:27.378 --> 00:26:28.161\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, sure,\n\n499\n00:26:28.161 --> 00:26:29.905\nbecause they could kill you literally,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n500\n00:26:29.905 --> 00:26:30.486\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n501\n00:26:30.486 --> 00:26:31.466\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Number one,\n\n502\n00:26:31.466 --> 00:26:34.299\nif they don't give you the blood, but also\nthey give you the wrong type of blood,\n\n503\n00:26:34.299 --> 00:26:36.290\nwhich would potentially be equally bad.\n\n504\n00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:39.301\nSo there definitely going to be reasons,\nand if you're incapacitated,\n\n505\n00:26:39.301 --> 00:26:42.747\nlike you said, maybe you're unconscious,\nor we can't get information from you,\n\n506\n00:26:42.747 --> 00:26:44.854\nmaybe there's no one who can answer that,\nright?\n\n507\n00:26:44.854 --> 00:26:46.770\nWe have to have a way\nof figuring that out.\n\n508\n00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.980\nIs it okay to cross type match your blood,\nbecause you can't give us consent.\n\n509\n00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.770\nThose are some of the things that we\nwould have to worry about or think about.\n\n510\n00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.870\nAnd then, as a result, getting that\ninformation, putting it in your chart and\n\n511\n00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.860\nhaving it as part of the profile\non patient data record.\n\n512\n00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.560\nWould that be acceptable, and could we\nstore that, and how do we deal with that?\n\n513\n00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.250\nThose are all things that kind\nof cascade down the line, and so\n\n514\n00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.030\nwe have to make allowances for\nthose things.\n\n515\n00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:08.620\nIt's great example.\n\n516\n00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.788\nAll right, so\nwe can see there's a whole bunch of it,\n\n517\n00:27:10.788 --> 00:27:12.590\nI'm not going to go through\nthe entire list with you.\n\n518\n00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:17.170\nThere's about eight or nine items on this,\nbut you can see here processing related to\n\n519\n00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.710\npersonal data which are manifestly\nmade public by the data subject.\n\n520\n00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.090\nAnother great one to think about.\n\n521\n00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:26.076\nIn other words, if you out yourself\nessentially on one of these items,\n\n522\n00:27:26.076 --> 00:27:30.070\nyou say look I am a Republican,\nI am a Democrat, I am a Social Democrat.\n\n523\n00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.759\nI am a Conservative, or whatever is\non that list, whatever it is but\n\n524\n00:27:33.759 --> 00:27:38.100\nyou declare unequivocally in public and\nother forums that this is you already,\n\n525\n00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.558\nthen we have the ability\nto be able to now go and\n\n526\n00:27:40.558 --> 00:27:43.516\ngather data because you've\nalready made it public.\n\n527\n00:27:43.516 --> 00:27:44.777\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; There's no secret anymore,\n\n528\n00:27:44.777 --> 00:27:45.530\nit's not protected.\n\n529\n00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.211\n&gt;&gt; Especially with\nsocial media these days.\n\n530\n00:27:47.211 --> 00:27:50.884\n&gt;&gt; Right, you go on Facebook, or\nyou go on wherever and you say,\n\n531\n00:27:50.884 --> 00:27:54.145\nhey I love this thing and\nthis is me and this is what I want\n\n532\n00:27:54.145 --> 00:27:55.190\n&gt;&gt; Pizza!\n\n533\n00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:56.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whatever it is, right?\n\n534\n00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:57.450\nAnd now we know, right?\n\n535\n00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:59.290\nEverybody is no longer a secret.\n\n536\n00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.690\nYou've decided on your\nown as the data subject,\n\n537\n00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.490\nthe ultimate arbitrator\nof your own information.\n\n538\n00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.760\nYou've decided to make it public,\n\n539\n00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.390\nwhy would we at that point\nis overprotected, right?\n\n540\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.950\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; Because obviously that's been done.\n\n541\n00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.530\nNow this raises in the [INAUDIBLE]\ncounterpoint, right?\n\n542\n00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.600\nWhich is not addressed here,\n\n543\n00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.050\nwhich is what if somebody does that\nwithout your consent or knowledge.\n\n544\n00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it's not you going out and\n\n545\n00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.200\nsaying look I'm a raving fan for pizza.\n\n546\n00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.471\n&gt;&gt; If your account was hacked or\nsomething.\n\n547\n00:28:23.471 --> 00:28:25.317\n&gt;&gt; But, somebody hacked your account or\n\n548\n00:28:25.317 --> 00:28:28.959\njust somebody in a post without your\nknowledge without even hacking it.\n\n549\n00:28:28.959 --> 00:28:32.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay so just referencing me saying\nhey I know Cherokee loves pizza.\n\n550\n00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:35.310\n&gt;&gt; Of course yeah just I mean\nthink about the implications.\n\n551\n00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.990\nYou, whether it's right or\n\n552\n00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:39.730\nwrong by the way, maybe you do love pizza,\nbut maybe you absolutely hate pizza.\n\n553\n00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.370\nMaybe we're just trying to frame you as\na pizza girl when in fact you're not.\n\n554\n00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.380\nRight, and so either way right.\n\n555\n00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.040\nI'm more of an a--, right..\n\n556\n00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.804\nSomeone else would be just like\na huge [ remember this time.\n\n557\n00:28:48.804 --> 00:28:51.192\n&gt;&gt; I'm allergic to bananas,\nthat's why you said that.\n\n558\n00:28:51.192 --> 00:28:52.903\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I forgot that one time and\n\n559\n00:28:52.903 --> 00:28:55.770\nnow I\"m not allowed to\nforget that going forward.\n\n560\n00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.430\nBut you know it would be\nsomething like that, right?\n\n561\n00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:58.650\nIf you think about that,\n\n562\n00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.300\nit wouldn't just be that we've\ndecided it's the data subject.\n\n563\n00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.550\nThe owner, the arbitrator of our own\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n564\n00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.610\nBut if somebody forced our hand or\nincorrectly or\n\n565\n00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.680\ninappropriately put that information out\nthere, now we have to worry about that.\n\n566\n00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.390\nBecause now that may not be authoritative.\n\n567\n00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.210\nIt may not be allowed.\n\n568\n00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.560\nIt's not certainly coming from us and so\n\n569\n00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.180\nthere are gray areas that we would have\nto think about and consider here As well.\n\n570\n00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.710\nSo we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n571\n00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.370\nThere's also prohibition, or\nan allowance rather here for\n\n572\n00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:25.900\nprocessing in the public interest, right?\n\n573\n00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.100\nIf there's a substantial public interest,\nmaybe there's a health crisis.\n\n574\n00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:34.990\nMaybe you are patient zero, and you've\nstarted this epidemic, or who knows what.\n\n575\n00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.020\nOr you became sick, and it spread,\nand everybody is now sick.\n\n576\n00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.490\nThis is something that has\nto do with public interest.\n\n577\n00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.830\nMaybe we have to gather information about\nyour health status, and gather that\n\n578\n00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:47.450\ninformation in a way that would normally\nnot be permissible and lawfully\n\n579\n00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.910\nprovided for, but in order to serve\nthe public interest we have to do that.\n\n580\n00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:54.490\nSo there are health exceptions,\ngeneric public safety and public interest\n\n581\n00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:59.270\nexceptions, which shall be, as it says\nthere, proportionate to the aim pursued.\n\n582\n00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.020\nRespect the essence of the right\nto data protection, provide for\n\n583\n00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.640\nsuitable measure of safeguards but\nultimately, we're gonna go take the data\n\n584\n00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.620\nbecause it's in the interest of\nthe public to provide for it.\n\n585\n00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.360\nWe're gonna do our best to protect\nthe GDPR says, we shouldn't take it a nut,\n\n586\n00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.610\nsafeguard it but\n\n587\n00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:16.850\nthe interest of the public domain\nhas to be safeguarded, right?\n\n588\n00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.360\nSo we have to think about that as well.\n\n589\n00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.010\nNo, you may not asking me question.\n\n590\n00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.322\n&gt;&gt; I'm into just getting more crazy.\n\n591\n00:30:21.322 --> 00:30:23.160\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead\n&gt;&gt; So I may have to like limit myself but\n\n592\n00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.240\nmy mind go straight to like Brad Pitt\nWorld War Z like Apocalypse type thing.\n\n593\n00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.130\nSo if I have a specific genome these\npeople maybe spawning into zombies or\n\n594\n00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:33.990\nsomething like that.\n\n595\n00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.075\nSo is that what we we're\ntalking about here?\n\n596\n00:30:36.075 --> 00:30:40.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so just remember boys and\n\n597\n00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:41.495\ngirls, right?\n\n598\n00:30:41.495 --> 00:30:44.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not for\n\n599\n00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.050\nyou [INAUDIBLE] just so we're clear.\n\n600\n00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.550\nSo it's an interesting question.\n\n601\n00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.176\nMike and I actually with regards to\n\n602\n00:30:50.176 --> 00:30:51.300\nzombie [INAUDIBLE]-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n603\n00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.390\n&gt;&gt; Conversation but we did actually\nhave a discussion with similar and\n\n604\n00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.000\none of our prior episodes\naround genetic testing.\n\n605\n00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.950\nSo sites like, 23 and me,\nand some of these others.\n\n606\n00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.873\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; That are doing this catch all,\n\n607\n00:31:02.873 --> 00:31:07.810\nhey send us your information let,\nus [CROSSTALK] right?\n\n608\n00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:09.630\nAnd then we'll safeguard it, right?\n\n609\n00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:13.170\nSo, we were kinda just talking about\nthe whole logic of people opting in.\n\n610\n00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.250\nAnd what opting in to\nconsent really means,\n\n611\n00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:19.340\nand some of the crazy extents we can go\nto, giving somebody essentially your DNA.\n\n612\n00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And giving them the ability to manage\n\n613\n00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.255\nit, and not necessarily knowing\nsomething that I'm trusting them,\n\n614\n00:31:25.255 --> 00:31:28.920\nand what does that look like under\nthis kind of a regulatory environment?\n\n615\n00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.030\nSo, we actually talked about\nsomething similar, believe it or\n\n616\n00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:31.850\nnot, although it wasn't,\n\n617\n00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:36.410\nas I say, necessary having to do with\nthe zombie apocalypse, but let's go there.\n\n618\n00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:38.125\nI mean, it's a good conversation to have.\n\n619\n00:31:38.125 --> 00:31:43.262\nSo the issue really becomes that,\nwhen we're thinking about safeguarding\n\n620\n00:31:43.262 --> 00:31:47.850\nour information under a variety\nof circumstances and situations.\n\n621\n00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.303\nYeah, there's always gonna be\nexceptions one form or another, right?\n\n622\n00:31:50.303 --> 00:31:53.748\nWe have to be aware than We're talking\nthrough some of those things here as\n\n623\n00:31:53.748 --> 00:31:54.370\nan example.\n\n624\n00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.976\nWalking through article nine,\ntalking about what is protected, but\n\n625\n00:31:57.976 --> 00:32:01.275\nalso then carving out these\nexceptions that will override, and\n\n626\n00:32:01.275 --> 00:32:04.820\nwith certain safe guards,\nallow us to manipulate what is a protected\n\n627\n00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.460\npiece of information or protected class\nof individuals in some cases as a result.\n\n628\n00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.009\nSo, it is important to acknowledge that.\n\n629\n00:32:11.009 --> 00:32:15.590\nBut it's also important to understand\nthat the language here is kind of vague.\n\n630\n00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:18.936\nSo let's go back to this idea,\nsub topic G.\n\n631\n00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:21.640\nProcessing necessary for\nreasons of substantial public interest-\n\n632\n00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.325\n&gt;&gt; Public interest.\n\n633\n00:32:22.325 --> 00:32:23.872\n&gt;&gt; Let's just highlight that, so\n\n634\n00:32:23.872 --> 00:32:26.634\nwe can focus our attention\non what we're talking about.\n\n635\n00:32:26.634 --> 00:32:29.190\nDefine what substantial\npublic interest is?\n\n636\n00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:33.360\nIt's the question, and there's no guidance\nthat says, and by the way, substantial\n\n637\n00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.400\npublic interest will be when the zombie\napocalypse happens, or when Brad Pitt says\n\n638\n00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.960\nthat my genome could be modified to create\nzombies, or anything else, whatever it is.\n\n639\n00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.260\nMy point is the language\nis purposely vague,\n\n640\n00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:50.270\nbecause when you start narrowly defining\nthese exceptional circumstances,\n\n641\n00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.030\nyou exclude a variety of things\nyou can't anticipate or plan for\n\n642\n00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:57.250\nthat may have to fall into this category\nlater, which would now become a problem,\n\n643\n00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:01.720\nand you focus events and people's\nthought processes around things that\n\n644\n00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:06.320\nare going to be contentious as opposed to\nthings that may actually be beneficial.\n\n645\n00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.750\nSo we often see it in legislation,\nin general around the world,\n\n646\n00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.460\nnot just in this one example, but in many\nof these examples, that the language\n\n647\n00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.820\nis purposely vague, because it has\nto be elastic and interpretative.\n\n648\n00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.720\nNow that's a good thing in some respects,\nbut\n\n649\n00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.580\nit also leads to potentially\nlot of complications.\n\n650\n00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.306\n&gt;&gt; Interpretation.\n\n651\n00:33:22.306 --> 00:33:24.471\n&gt;&gt; The interpretation, who is arbiter or\n\n652\n00:33:24.471 --> 00:33:27.103\ninterpreter of substantial\npublic interest.\n\n653\n00:33:27.103 --> 00:33:30.349\nA lot of people will say, well I'm not\ncomfortable with that because somebody's\n\n654\n00:33:30.349 --> 00:33:32.244\ngonna make a decision that\nI may not agree with.\n\n655\n00:33:32.244 --> 00:33:32.920\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I mean this is\n\n656\n00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.320\nthe foundation of political\ndiscourse anywhere in the world.\n\n657\n00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.907\nSo it is a really interesting\ndiscussion or dichotomy,\n\n658\n00:33:39.907 --> 00:33:44.788\nin terms of the thought process, but\nwhat we see, whether we like it or not,\n\n659\n00:33:44.788 --> 00:33:48.907\njust to be clear, what we see is\nthat almost without exception,\n\n660\n00:33:48.907 --> 00:33:53.906\nthis kind of legislation is written to\nbe purposely broad and encompassing.\n\n661\n00:33:53.906 --> 00:33:58.475\nBecause as a result, it then becomes\neasier on a case-by-case basis to decide\n\n662\n00:33:58.475 --> 00:34:03.386\nand discuss What falls into a bucket like\nsubstantial public interest, versus a list\n\n663\n00:34:03.386 --> 00:34:07.882\nof ten things that, at the time made\na lot of sense, but I don't know, a year,\n\n664\n00:34:07.882 --> 00:34:12.553\na month, ten years later, whatever it is,\nmay or may not any longer be aligned.\n\n665\n00:34:12.553 --> 00:34:15.648\nAnd now we have all sorts of\nother things we have to do, and\n\n666\n00:34:15.648 --> 00:34:19.906\nit becomes harder to do them, because we\nhave not defined our ability to do them\n\n667\n00:34:19.906 --> 00:34:23.969\nin a way that allows for extension,\nas opposed to broadly defining it, and\n\n668\n00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:27.930\nthen allowing us to essentially feed\nthings in, on a case by case basis.\n\n669\n00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:30.493\nSo zombie apocalypse, I think,\nis definitely on the list, but\n\n670\n00:34:30.493 --> 00:34:33.150\nI don't know that it was necessarily\nin the minds of the drafters,\n\n671\n00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.379\nas they were thinking about-\n&gt;&gt; I know, and I don't envy their job,\n\n672\n00:34:36.379 --> 00:34:40.346\neither, to sit here and come up with\nthis extensive document, I mean-\n\n673\n00:34:40.346 --> 00:34:41.207\n&gt;&gt; It took years,\n\n674\n00:34:41.207 --> 00:34:45.914\nas we talked about in some of the overview\nepisodes, years to negotiate and went into\n\n675\n00:34:45.914 --> 00:34:50.684\neffect, in the sense that it was passed,\nas we talked about, in 2016, with a two\n\n676\n00:34:50.684 --> 00:34:55.840\nyear ramp, as we've made clear, targeting\nand moving towards 25th of May, 2018.\n\n677\n00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.330\nLooking ahead to where\nthat will go into effect.\n\n678\n00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:02.479\nSo, it's an interesting thought process,\nbecause it does take time.\n\n679\n00:35:02.479 --> 00:35:04.262\nThis is not something you sit down, and\n\n680\n00:35:04.262 --> 00:35:06.924\nin one evening hash out with\na bunch of people and agree to.\n\n681\n00:35:06.924 --> 00:35:08.472\nI mean,\nthis can in some cases take years to\n\n682\n00:35:08.472 --> 00:35:09.497\nnegotiate,-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n683\n00:35:09.497 --> 00:35:12.590\n&gt;&gt; Right, and agonize over individual\nwords, as is often the case.\n\n684\n00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.160\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad I have you here\nto help me through this process and\n\n685\n00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.338\nunderstand everything, Adam.\n\n686\n00:35:16.338 --> 00:35:17.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n687\n00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.233\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you guys are here,\ntoo, but we are out of time for\n\n688\n00:35:20.233 --> 00:35:21.590\nthis particular episode.\n\n689\n00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:23.420\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n690\n00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.125\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n691\n00:35:25.125 --> 00:35:26.260\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n692\n00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.293\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n693\n00:35:29.293 --> 00:35:35.230\n[MUSIC]\n\n694\n00:35:35.230 -->

00:00:10.270\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.360\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, ladies and\ngentlemen, to your GDPR series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.410\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.660\nIn this episode we'll continue to\ntake a look at special topics we need\n\n7\n00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.510\nto focus on.\n\n8\n00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590\nSo this is a part two if you haven't\nchecked out that first episode make sure\n\n9\n00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.810\nyou do that and of course we have with\nus today Mr. Adam Gordon back in studio.\n\n10\n00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.390\nThank you so much for joining us Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.210\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\nAlways a pleasure to come back and\n\n12\n00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.998\nspend more time talking about\ntopics associated with the GDPR.\n\n13\n00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:41.190\nWe're actually gonna turn, and talk about\nanother topic that's on that special list\n\n14\n00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.360\nof things we have to make\nsure we pay attention to.\n\n15\n00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.290\nWe spent our time in the last episode\ndelving into lawful processing,\n\n16\n00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.750\nand what lawfulness of\nprocessing looks like.\n\n17\n00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.433\nAnd the standards we have to meet, and\n\n18\n00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:55.500\nthe exceptions that may be carved\nout in order to address that.\n\n19\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.570\nSo I encourage you to remind yourselves\nof that, go back, take a look.\n\n20\n00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.892\nArticle 6 and Article 9,\nif we have some questions there,\n\n21\n00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:04.620\ncould delve into the document,\ntake a look.\n\n22\n00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.030\nWe're going to shift gears,\ngo to an article we've already looked at,\n\n23\n00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.290\nwhich is valuable in general.\n\n24\n00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.095\nCherokee and I were actually just\ntalking about it before we came on for\n\n25\n00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:15.999\nthis episode, which is Article 4,\nand Article 4,\n\n26\n00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:18.270\nin the document allows us to see overall.\n\n27\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.960\nGive me just a second,\nI just scrolled past where I need to be.\n\n28\n00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.890\nSo let me just scroll back down\nthere cuz I hit the wrong button.\n\n29\n00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.320\nJust while I'm talking, Article 4\nallows us, there we go, Article 5.\n\n30\n00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.189\nHold on one second,\nwent the wrong way, that's better.\n\n31\n00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.120\nSo, Article 4 is going\nto allow us in Chapter 1\n\n32\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.590\nto be able to get a series\nof definitional terms.\n\n33\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.550\nAnd essentially it's\nthe working vocabulary list for\n\n34\n00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.540\nall the things we have to understand and\n\n35\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.950\nmanage that may cause us to scratch our\nheads from time to time in the GDPR.\n\n36\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.350\nDefinitions that will be important, we've\ngone to this list to define things like\n\n37\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.330\npersonal data, and processing,\nrestrictions on processing are there.\n\n38\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.425\nA favorite of Mike's, pseudonymization,\nI made him spell that word.\n\n39\n00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:11.534\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And asked him if he could get the,\n\n40\n00:02:11.534 --> 00:02:13.307\nthe proper spelling correct.\n\n41\n00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:15.700\nAnd of course,\nhe did not cuz he missed the s.\n\n42\n00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.233\n&gt;&gt; And then there's like some five year\nold child that's whipping it out, yeah.\n\n43\n00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:20.380\n&gt;&gt; That's like,\nI know how to spell that, yeah.\n\n44\n00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.360\nSo we did that.\n\n45\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.500\nTerms that we were just\ntalking about a little bit,\n\n46\n00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.600\ncontroller and processor\n&gt;&gt; Just defining those terms and\n\n47\n00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.350\nunderstanding what they are,\nthose are listed there.\n\n48\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.421\nSo all of the meaningful vocabulary\nis in Article 4 so be a good idea for\n\n49\n00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:35.077\nyou to go back, take a look.\n\n50\n00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:37.669\nI'm just gonna scroll down\nto the next page here,\n\n51\n00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:41.480\ncuz what we're wanna focus on is term 11,\nor item 11 on this list.\n\n52\n00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.900\nIt is not alphabetized so you're just\njumping around right if you're looking at\n\n53\n00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.980\nit alphabetically, but\nI wanna focus on the concept of consent.\n\n54\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.460\nThis is another area that we have to\nthink about and really understand\n\n55\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.530\nthe terminology, the definition, and\nthe operationalization of this term.\n\n56\n00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.828\nIt's very very important.\n\n57\n00:02:57.828 --> 00:03:00.082\nSo consent as you could\nsee of the data subject,\n\n58\n00:03:00.082 --> 00:03:04.960\nwe talked extensively about consent,\nthe idea of me, of consent having to\n\n59\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.110\nbe unambiguous action oriented given,\nof free will and all those things.\n\n60\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.760\nSo, the data subject must consent\nby freely given specific, informed,\n\n61\n00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.470\nunambiguous indication of\nthe data subject's wishes.\n\n62\n00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.040\nBy which he or she, they,\nby a statement or by a clear,\n\n63\n00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.360\naffirmative action, with said things\nlike checking off the box yourself,\n\n64\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.440\nnot having it pre populated in a form,\nsignifies agreement to the processing of\n\n65\n00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.415\npersonal data relating to him,\nor her, or them.\n\n66\n00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:36.900\nSo, consent is defined as this action that\nmust come from the data subject freely,\n\n67\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.720\nunambiguously, and\nwith affirmative action.\n\n68\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.870\nIt's not enough for\nme to not do something, not say something,\n\n69\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.200\nnot be asked, and for\nyou to imply as the controller or\n\n70\n00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.910\nthe processor that I have consented.\n\n71\n00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.160\nBut rather, you must go out of\nyour way as the controller and or\n\n72\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.060\nprocessor to engage me, the data subject,\nand ensure, as a result,\n\n73\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.050\nright, that you are gaining my consent.\n\n74\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.828\nAnd if we go back up here for\njust a minute to controller and processor.\n\n75\n00:04:09.828 --> 00:04:11.950\nLet me just bring these\nterms up high enough so\n\n76\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.260\nthat you can see them right\nabove my box-in-box here.\n\n77\n00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.700\nSo when we look at controller and\nprocessor, I can never get the click ratio\n\n78\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.500\nexactly right, to get it right, I'm either\none click above or one click below.\n\n79\n00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.705\nI can never get it right.\n\n80\n00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:26.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'll keep practicing,\n\n81\n00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.670\nI'll give it another.\n\n82\n00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.130\n&gt;&gt; At least we don't have any\nslider windows in this show.\n\n83\n00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.030\nI mean, those are kind of a point\nof consternation for you as well.\n\n84\n00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.810\n&gt;&gt; They are, and\nthat was a big word on your behalf.\n\n85\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.350\n&gt;&gt; I learned it from Ronnie,\nI had to look it up.\n\n86\n00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.405\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, consternation, or point.\n\n87\n00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:42.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, let's talk big words and\n\n88\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.640\nvocabulary, right?\n\n89\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.910\nSo, when we're thinking about\ncontroller and processor,\n\n90\n00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.120\nthis is again, important for\nus to remember.\n\n91\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.760\nNow, one thing I just want to point out as\nwe define these terms, we'll go through\n\n92\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.950\nthem here in just a second,\n&gt;&gt; Keep in mind that in many cases,\n\n93\n00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.930\nmany businesses, probably any business\nthat's been in EU for sometime, or\n\n94\n00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.300\nis managing data on behalf of EU citizens\nboth inside and outside of the EU,\n\n95\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.310\nalready under Directive 95/46.\n\n96\n00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.140\nOr maybe in the UK,\nanother Data Protection Act, or\n\n97\n00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.090\nany of the other data rules that exist\nin and out of these member states.\n\n98\n00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.910\nIs gonna already,\n\n99\n00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.045\nmost likely, have consent on their\nbooks for data that they've gathered,\n\n100\n00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:24.620\nis gonna be dealing with consent\nexisting consent in one form or another.\n\n101\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.380\nIn other words, this is probably not\na new concept for many businesses because\n\n102\n00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.560\nthey've been dealing with the requirements\naround consent for some time now.\n\n103\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.370\nBut, what we're saying under GDPR is hey,\ndon't have to go re-invent the wheel.\n\n104\n00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.500\nDon't go refresh all those consents\nyou already have available.\n\n105\n00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.950\nAs long as they meet\nthe minimum requirements.\n\n106\n00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.600\nThey're perfectly acceptable, keep them in\nplace, and continue to operate as before.\n\n107\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.230\nBut in areas and entities and\n\n108\n00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.160\nor in situations where you either don't\nhave consent that meets the bar, right?\n\n109\n00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.890\nThat is positive,\n\n110\n00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.700\ngathered from the data subject\naffirmatively, that they have opted in and\n\n111\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.560\ndone so of their own free will, then you\nmay wanna go back and refresh those.\n\n112\n00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.690\nIn other words, you may wanna go back and\nexamine those to make sure\n\n113\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.790\nthat they are gonna stand up and do meet\nthe bar, or the burden of proof here.\n\n114\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.490\nSo, we're just giving you\nguidance around the fact that,\n\n115\n00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.510\nand I made this point\nbefore in other episodes.\n\n116\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.300\nA lot of what we already may be doing\nmay be 100% aligned and valid here.\n\n117\n00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.220\nThe data protection officer\nconversations in prior episodes was\n\n118\n00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.270\na good example of this.\n\n119\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.720\nMany companies, many entities, right,\nmay already have data protection officer\n\n120\n00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.380\nroles, quote unquote,\nin some form instantiated.\n\n121\n00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.630\nThey may not be called DPOs.\n\n122\n00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.800\nWe said there may be\ninformation assurance officers,\n\n123\n00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.890\nchief privacy officers,\nchief risk officers, risk managers.\n\n124\n00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.560\nThere's a whole bunch of\nrole defined terms today\n\n125\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.700\nthat are most likely broadly applicable to\nthe concept of a data protection officer.\n\n126\n00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.120\nAnd we made the case that you may be\nable to simply repurpose and or extend\n\n127\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.520\nthat existing role to encompass data\nprotection officer capabilities and needs.\n\n128\n00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.700\nIf you are gonna have to provide a data\nprotection officer role based on\n\n129\n00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.560\nthe criteria that you would have to meet\nin order to satisfy that requirement.\n\n130\n00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.270\nSo keep in mind that you may already\nbe doing a lot of these things.\n\n131\n00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:16.070\nYou just may simply have to acknowledge\nthat in procedure, in process, in policy.\n\n132\n00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.140\nIn other words in writing formally realign\nthe business with this new language and\n\n133\n00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.160\nthis focus.\n\n134\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.690\nAnd do so\n\n135\n00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.610\nin a meaningful, stated, and formal way to\nacknowledge that you are now complying.\n\n136\n00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.770\nAnd then you're in the right place, doing\nthe right thing, and you can verify and\n\n137\n00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.870\nvalidate that when necessary.\n\n138\n00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.910\nBut it may not mean that you have\nto reinvent and or recreate, or\n\n139\n00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.610\neven create content, structure, and\napproaches that may already exist.\n\n140\n00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.670\nYou just have to leverage what is there.\n\n141\n00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.620\nThe controller role versus\nthe processor role.\n\n142\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.380\nYou wanna help me work through these too?\n\n143\n00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.970\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; All right, outstanding.\n\n144\n00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.719\nSo Cherokee's gonna drive this discussion,\nI'm gonna go get a drink, no,\n\n145\n00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:50.450\nI'm only kidding.\n\n146\n00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.858\n&gt;&gt; Well, it'll be based on my-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n147\n00:07:51.858 --> 00:07:53.037\nlet's talk about the definition\nof these two, right?\n\n148\n00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:55.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, on my observation of it,\nor my understanding of it.\n\n149\n00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's start, you want\nto start with controller or processor?\n\n150\n00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.905\nJust remind everybody what they are.\n\n151\n00:07:58.905 --> 00:07:59.692\n&gt;&gt; Controller.\n\n152\n00:07:59.692 --> 00:08:01.016\n&gt;&gt; Controller, all right.\n\n153\n00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:03.040\nGoing for the first one.\n\n154\n00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.060\nWe can go full screen if you want.\n\n155\n00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.110\nJust put them up so everybody can see\nthem real nicely, while we're talking.\n\n156\n00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.900\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n157\n00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.970\nWe're focusing on Items 7 and\n8 on the list, right?\n\n158\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.050\nJust so everybody knows they're there.\n\n159\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.671\nI know you probably can't\nsee them necessarily.\n\n160\n00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:15.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But they are up on the screen.\n\n161\n00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.666\nAll right, but\nlet's talk about controllers first.\n\n162\n00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:19.176\nSo a controller, right?\n\n163\n00:08:19.176 --> 00:08:21.161\nWhat do we say a controller would be?\n\n164\n00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:26.921\n&gt;&gt; I would say it would be the entity\nthat is ultimately held responsible,\n\n165\n00:08:26.921 --> 00:08:32.877\nthe decision maker, the enforcer of\nthe particular action in question.\n\n166\n00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:35.734\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthat's definitely part of the definition.\n\n167\n00:08:35.734 --> 00:08:39.626\nBut let's remember that when we\nthink about control and processor,\n\n168\n00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:44.391\nwe're talking specifically around roles\nthat are dealing with gathering of data,\n\n169\n00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:48.100\nthe use of data, the requirements and\nneeds for that gathering-\n\n170\n00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:48.654\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n171\n00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:50.223\n&gt;&gt; As well as the execution\nof the gathering, right?\n\n172\n00:08:50.223 --> 00:08:51.852\nSo we want to just incorporate\nthat as part of the definition\n\n173\n00:08:51.852 --> 00:08:52.546\n[CROSSTALK] in some form.\n\n174\n00:08:52.546 --> 00:08:54.251\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nthen I'll enhance my definition here\n\n175\n00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:54.949\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n176\n00:08:54.949 --> 00:09:00.449\n&gt;&gt; If I have the opportunity, so\nthe controller is in charge of\n\n177\n00:09:00.449 --> 00:09:05.509\neither doing that,\ncreating the processing itself,\n\n178\n00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:09.368\nand so it could be two in one,\nas the role.\n\n179\n00:09:09.368 --> 00:09:14.656\nOr it could also,\nthe controller could also be procuring\n\n180\n00:09:14.656 --> 00:09:20.385\nthe processor to kind of delegate\nthat duty to the processor,\n\n181\n00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:26.705\nbut ultimately is the one responsible\nto adhere to the regulation.\n\n182\n00:09:26.705 --> 00:09:28.701\nSo that controller may audit or\n\n183\n00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:34.094\njust monitor the actions of the processor\nto make sure that they are in compliance.\n\n184\n00:09:34.094 --> 00:09:34.813\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n185\n00:09:34.813 --> 00:09:35.987\n&gt;&gt; Better?\n[LAUGH]\n\n186\n00:09:35.987 --> 00:09:36.967\n&gt;&gt; Let's go with that second part of\n\n187\n00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:37.494\nthe definition.\n\n188\n00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:39.756\nIt is possible that in theory,\n\n189\n00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:43.805\nthe controller and\nprocessor maybe essentially.\n\n190\n00:09:43.805 --> 00:09:46.741\nAlthough we wanna separate\nthem in name and function and\n\n191\n00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:49.925\nin reality, it could be one and\nthe same, in the sense that,\n\n192\n00:09:49.925 --> 00:09:54.431\none entity may have both controller and\nprocessor functions, let's say within it.\n\n193\n00:09:54.431 --> 00:09:56.719\nWhich is I know what you were\ntrying to suggest, right?\n\n194\n00:09:56.719 --> 00:09:59.491\nAnd so we definitely can see that,\nbut let's be,\n\n195\n00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:02.398\nlet's focus on the second\npart of your definition.\n\n196\n00:10:02.398 --> 00:10:03.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n197\n00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.515\n&gt;&gt; Which I like better because it's just\na little less, it's more unambiguous,\n\n198\n00:10:06.515 --> 00:10:07.298\nless ambiguous.\n\n199\n00:10:07.298 --> 00:10:09.957\nWhich is you made a very\nclear distinction for us,\n\n200\n00:10:09.957 --> 00:10:14.515\nthat the controller role is that entity\nsays, they're the natural or legal person,\n\n201\n00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:16.690\npublic authority, agency or the body.\n\n202\n00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.623\nIn other words it's the person or group,\nright, generically, whatever that is.\n\n203\n00:10:20.623 --> 00:10:24.372\nCuz it could be a person that says, I have\nthis need and I would like to go out and\n\n204\n00:10:24.372 --> 00:10:26.600\nfigure out how to service this need.\n\n205\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.132\nSo I have requirements around data\ngathering that I need to fulfill, or\n\n206\n00:10:30.132 --> 00:10:35.420\na business or an entity, a public\nentity like the health commission.\n\n207\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.424\nOr a public entity like\nthe IRS in the United States.\n\n208\n00:10:39.424 --> 00:10:44.321\nOr the Department of Public Safety, in any\ncountry in the world could come out and\n\n209\n00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:48.788\nsay, we have needs around data gathering\nor the management of personally\n\n210\n00:10:48.788 --> 00:10:53.380\nidentifiable information on behalf\nof people in this protected class.\n\n211\n00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.545\nAnd we need to now go pursue those,\nright, whatever that will be.\n\n212\n00:10:56.545 --> 00:10:59.685\nSo the controller will be that entity,\nwhich alone or\n\n213\n00:10:59.685 --> 00:11:02.335\njointly as we say there,\nwill determine the purposes and\n\n214\n00:11:02.335 --> 00:11:05.345\nmeans of processing of personal data,\nlike you were describing.\n\n215\n00:11:05.345 --> 00:11:08.461\nThey set up the requirements and\nspecify the need, and\n\n216\n00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:13.135\nthen they will typically go out, as we\nsuggested, as you rightly called out, and\n\n217\n00:11:13.135 --> 00:11:16.940\nengage a processor,\na secondary role, another function.\n\n218\n00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.254\nThat will go out again,\ntypically in natural or legal person.\n\n219\n00:11:20.254 --> 00:11:24.550\nMaybe in, again, an entity, an individual\nor combination of those, that will\n\n220\n00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:29.930\nprocess or, actually, operationalize the\npersonal data on behalf of the controller.\n\n221\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.080\nWe say the controller oversees,\nverifies, validates,\n\n222\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.960\nthe words you used,\nwhereas the processor does.\n\n223\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.160\nThey gather, they manage the data\nday to day, moment to moment all at\n\n224\n00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.408\nthe direction, at the behest and\non behalf of the controller.\n\n225\n00:11:43.408 --> 00:11:47.680\nSo we wanna make sure we understand\nthe differences in these two roles, and\n\n226\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.840\nhow we define them.\n\n227\n00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.570\nBecause this informs our conversation\nabout consent, right, and really helps us\n\n228\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.890\nto understand or refer back to the idea\nthat consent must be gathered.\n\n229\n00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:02.620\nAnd that consent must be can, obviously,\nfrom the individual the data subject\n\n230\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.910\ngathered authoritatively of their free\nwill, all those things we talked about.\n\n231\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.410\nBut it's the processor, more often than\nnot, that is gonna be doing the gathering\n\n232\n00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.967\nof the consent because they're\nat the point of engagement.\n\n233\n00:12:11.967 --> 00:12:16.059\nBut it's the controller, that is\nultimately responsible for ensuring, and\n\n234\n00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:19.270\nyou pull this out as well,\nabsolute correct to say it.\n\n235\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.095\nThat the controller is responsible for\nensuring the process or\n\n236\n00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:23.967\nacts in the appropriate manner, right?\n\n237\n00:12:23.967 --> 00:12:26.870\nSo it's very important to\nmake those distinctions, and\n\n238\n00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:31.030\nCherokee did a great job helping us to\nunderstand those two, so awesome job.\n\n239\n00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.330\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying I can't have\nsomeone sitting in the dark for\n\n240\n00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.990\nthe light shining on them, forcing them\nto answer all the questions I wanna know.\n\n241\n00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.165\n&gt;&gt; You can, you're just not allowed\nto tell anybody you do that.\n\n242\n00:12:39.165 --> 00:12:40.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; You could\n\n243\n00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.300\ncertainly do that as long as\nnobody is paying attention, right?\n\n244\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.227\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; No, you're not allowed to do that.\n\n245\n00:12:43.227 --> 00:12:44.902\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not appropriate.\n\n246\n00:12:44.902 --> 00:12:48.810\n&gt;&gt; Not good, not good, don't do that,\nthat's not gonna be appropriate.\n\n247\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.965\nUnless somebody consents,\nin which case, well, by all means.\n\n248\n00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:53.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All bets are off if they say yes.\n\n249\n00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.660\nAll right, so we've talked about consent,\ntied it back to the idea of controller and\n\n250\n00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.400\nprocessor.\n\n251\n00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.930\nThere's another protector here that\nwe have to, just pay attention to for\n\n252\n00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.060\na little bit here as well.\n\n253\n00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.580\nAnd I mentioned it in some other episodes.\n\n254\n00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.120\nWe'll mention again, coming up.\n\n255\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.470\nChildren, and\nspecifically children's personal data.\n\n256\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.090\nWe made a point of saying,\nthat when we gather data, and\n\n257\n00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.380\nwe talk about consent, and this is where\nI brought the idea of the management of\n\n258\n00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.345\nchildren's data as a protected class back\nin, in one of our prior conversations.\n\n259\n00:13:18.345 --> 00:13:21.620\nWill be reference consent,\nwhen we talk about the age of consent,\n\n260\n00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.830\nwhich is really what we talked about,\nwith children,\n\n261\n00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:28.110\nthat the GDPR is very prescriptive and\nspecific here.\n\n262\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:34.470\nThe age of consent for a child is at 16\nyears of age, in the language of the GDPR.\n\n263\n00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.628\nSo if a child is 16 or older, they can\ngive consent to gather data online,\n\n264\n00:13:38.628 --> 00:13:41.334\ntraditionally, is kinda\nwhat the framework and\n\n265\n00:13:41.334 --> 00:13:44.176\nconversation is about in\nthe language of the GDPR.\n\n266\n00:13:44.176 --> 00:13:49.202\nBut we also called out that member states\nhave the ability to override that, on\n\n267\n00:13:49.202 --> 00:13:54.550\nan as-needed basis, to go down as low as\n13, which may or may not be a good thing.\n\n268\n00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:58.250\nBut it is what is stated,\njust to be clear.\n\n269\n00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:03.140\nAnd as a result, if a member state says,\nhey, we understand the baseline is 16 for\n\n270\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.260\nage of consent, for let's say,\nonline information gathering for\n\n271\n00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.920\na child without an adult being involved,\nright?\n\n272\n00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.280\nSo they can give their own consent,\nis what we're suggesting.\n\n273\n00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.928\nBut country acts decides\nthey want that age to be 14.\n\n274\n00:14:14.928 --> 00:14:19.521\nThey can pass a law specific to their\nmember state that will say in a member\n\n275\n00:14:19.521 --> 00:14:23.830\nstate x it is 14, even though\nelsewhere in the union, it is 16.\n\n276\n00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.070\nAnd that would be acceptable and\nallowed under the GDPR.\n\n277\n00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.140\nBut that bottom baseline minimum is 13.\n\n278\n00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.661\n&gt;&gt; We cannot go below 13,\neven with a member state exception.\n\n279\n00:14:33.661 --> 00:14:34.450\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n280\n00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.869\n&gt;&gt; So the GDPR does call that and\nspecifically talks about this,\n\n281\n00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:42.736\nwith regards to online services offered to\nchildren and privacy notices for children,\n\n282\n00:14:42.736 --> 00:14:47.075\nand the gathering and offering of\nservices around gathering of information,\n\n283\n00:14:47.075 --> 00:14:48.610\nwith regards to children.\n\n284\n00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.920\nSo very strong protections called out.\n\n285\n00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.260\nVery good definition in that respect.\n\n286\n00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.360\nAdults must be involved,\n\n287\n00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.390\nif we fall below those age thresholds\nto give consent on behalf of the child.\n\n288\n00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.032\nOr consent is not considered valid, and\n\n289\n00:15:01.032 --> 00:15:03.312\ntherefore you cannot gather information,\nlawfully.\n\n290\n00:15:03.312 --> 00:15:07.160\nWe've talked about process,\nlawful processing of information already.\n\n291\n00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.100\nSo we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n292\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.812\nAnd it says that if, as I talked about,\nif the age of consent at these bars that\n\n293\n00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:16.942\nwe've talked about is met,\nthen we could do that.\n\n294\n00:15:16.942 --> 00:15:20.228\nIf not, we have this idea of what's\ncalled, parental responsibility,\n\n295\n00:15:20.228 --> 00:15:23.800\nwhere we have to make sure we bring\nan adult in, in order to deal with that.\n\n296\n00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.190\nSo just keep that in mind,\nArticle VIII, in particular,\n\n297\n00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.210\nwould be where we wanna go here for that.\n\n298\n00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.230\nSo let's just bring up Article VIII\nhere for just a minute.\n\n299\n00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.869\nPrinciples relating to processing of\npersonal data, as I've talked about.\n\n300\n00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:38.734\nAnd you could see,\nshall be in occurrence with Article VIII,\n\n301\n00:15:38.734 --> 00:15:42.050\nso they talked a bit about it in this\nfirst one here, this is Article V.\n\n302\n00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.440\nBut then if we keep going,\nArticle VIII specifically,\n\n303\n00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.750\nwhich is referencing the general article\naround the gathering to personal data.\n\n304\n00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.546\nThe one we wanna call out and look at\nconditions applicable to children's or\n\n305\n00:15:53.546 --> 00:15:56.943\nchild's consent, in relation to\ninformation society services.\n\n306\n00:15:56.943 --> 00:16:01.068\nInformation society services is the\nlanguage in the GDPR that is calling out\n\n307\n00:16:01.068 --> 00:16:02.104\nonline services.\n\n308\n00:16:02.104 --> 00:16:04.930\nSo anything online, right,\nsocial media, and things like that.\n\n309\n00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.819\nThat's what information society\nservices are referred to as.\n\n310\n00:16:07.819 --> 00:16:10.676\nThe first time I read that,\nI was scratching my head saying,\n\n311\n00:16:10.676 --> 00:16:11.690\nwhat does that mean?\n\n312\n00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.872\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI wouldn't have guessed that either.\n\n313\n00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:13.915\n&gt;&gt; But it's online services.\n\n314\n00:16:13.915 --> 00:16:15.190\nAnything having to do with the Internet,\nor\n\n315\n00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.850\nworld wide web specifically is\nwhat we're talking about there.\n\n316\n00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.558\nI called out the legal\nrequirement around the age.\n\n317\n00:16:21.558 --> 00:16:26.518\nYou can see it right here, at least 16\nyears of age and not to be below 13\n\n318\n00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:31.478\nyears of age as provided by exceptions\non a per member state basis as we call\n\n319\n00:16:31.478 --> 00:16:36.020\nthat under article eight subpoint\none is where you will see that.\n\n320\n00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.530\nSo just want to make sure we capture this\nadditional area of conversation around\n\n321\n00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:45.910\nconsent and specificity around the ability\nto gather child information and\n\n322\n00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.450\nconsent and\nthe age of consent for children.\n\n323\n00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.630\nBecause it is, again,\ngonna be important for\n\n324\n00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.375\nyou if you're operating in areas\nin businesses where more and\n\n325\n00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:59.715\nmore, as we have exposure on the web, we\nmay be dealing with children coming in and\n\n326\n00:16:59.715 --> 00:17:03.645\nattempting to consume services or\nbe involved in online platforms.\n\n327\n00:17:03.645 --> 00:17:06.665\nWhether we know it or not, not that you\nnecessarily would know they're there,\n\n328\n00:17:06.665 --> 00:17:08.980\nbecause the other name was\nfaceless in that respect.\n\n329\n00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.840\nBut we have to now figure out ways to\nestablish, within reasonable bounds and\n\n330\n00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.690\nauthoritatively, age as part of consent.\n\n331\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.970\nBecause now we have to make sure\nthat we are not inadvertently\n\n332\n00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.350\nallowing children to consume services\nthat may be considered to be underage.\n\n333\n00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:28.370\nAnd so this is often a big deal and\nyou see in many websites that there\n\n334\n00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:33.015\nis typically a requirement to specify your\nage or certify you are of a certain age.\n\n335\n00:17:33.015 --> 00:17:36.853\nEven you don't put your birthday in, maybe\nyou just have to click a box that says\n\n336\n00:17:36.853 --> 00:17:39.448\nyes, I certify I'm 18 or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n337\n00:17:39.448 --> 00:17:40.808\nBut you still have to do that.\n\n338\n00:17:40.808 --> 00:17:44.513\nAnd so again, we see many sites\npositioning themselves already for\n\n339\n00:17:44.513 --> 00:17:48.869\nseveral years running to deal with these\nissues in anticipation of the fact that\n\n340\n00:17:48.869 --> 00:17:50.930\nthis is coming online.\n\n341\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:56.354\n&gt;&gt; I think it's great that they're able to\nadvocate for young children in this way.\n\n342\n00:17:56.354 --> 00:18:00.386\nI haven't combed through this entire\ndocument Adam, but even just from my\n\n343\n00:18:00.386 --> 00:18:04.930\npersonal perspective, I've seen things\nonline where, in the previous episode we\n\n344\n00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:08.380\nwere kind of joking around\nabout me liking pizza, right?\n\n345\n00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.960\nAnd if I were to declare my\npersonal information publicly\n\n346\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.280\nthen it wouldn't have to be as protected\nor wouldn't have to be protected.\n\n347\n00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.690\n&gt;&gt; If you declared it publicly, as we\nsaid, it would not be considered, right,\n\n348\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.470\nto be protected in some cases because you\nwould essentially bypass requirement for\n\n349\n00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.750\nus to gain consent to\ngather that information.\n\n350\n00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.092\nNow, how it's processed,\nhow it's managed, what is done with it,\n\n351\n00:18:30.092 --> 00:18:32.030\nmay still classify as being protected.\n\n352\n00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.228\n&gt;&gt; Being protected.\n&gt;&gt; Because the business or entity,\n\n353\n00:18:34.228 --> 00:18:38.720\nthe controller and processor\nrelationship that uses that information.\n\n354\n00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.933\nIf they don't process it lawfully and\nmaintain it lawfully,\n\n355\n00:18:41.933 --> 00:18:46.269\nsome of the standards we've talked about,\nthey may still run afoul of that issue.\n\n356\n00:18:46.269 --> 00:18:49.923\nEven though they didn't have to gain\nconsent for you to give them the data,\n\n357\n00:18:49.923 --> 00:18:53.120\nbecause you publicly declared that\npizza was a passion of yours.\n\n358\n00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n359\n00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:58.070\nthey now still have a responsibility\nto safeguard that information.\n\n360\n00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; With certain bare minimum requirements.\n\n361\n00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.820\nSo it gets very complex.\n\n362\n00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.504\n&gt;&gt; Well I was gonna say,\nbecause I see sometimes and you know,\n\n363\n00:19:06.504 --> 00:19:08.950\nit's one of those gray areas.\n\n364\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:12.670\nBecause I see parents even sometimes,\nof children,\n\n365\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.700\ndeclaring information about their\nchildren that the children probably were\n\n366\n00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.300\nnever even consulted before, and\nit could potentially even harm children.\n\n367\n00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.994\nAnd it's just such an interesting idea\nbecause who's responsible in that\n\n368\n00:19:27.994 --> 00:19:29.566\nparticular situation?\n\n369\n00:19:29.566 --> 00:19:31.965\nIt's kind of one of those things,\nhey, it's the parent.\n\n370\n00:19:31.965 --> 00:19:34.090\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, it can.\n\n371\n00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:38.020\nParents that for instance allow their\nkids to be tagged in photographs and\n\n372\n00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.220\nthings of that nature without\neven thinking about it.\n\n373\n00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.710\nHey, my kid was there, my kid was\ndoing this, whatever the case may be.\n\n374\n00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.323\nI mean, all these things that\nhappen with social media, it's\n\n375\n00:19:47.323 --> 00:19:51.756\nvery hard to come up with a thousand words\nthat will speak to every scenario and\n\n376\n00:19:51.756 --> 00:19:54.779\nas a result,\nbe authoritative in every situation.\n\n377\n00:19:54.779 --> 00:19:58.244\nBut the idea we come back to,\nthis idea of very broad,\n\n378\n00:19:58.244 --> 00:20:02.562\ninterpretative protections that\ncan be applied in circumstances\n\n379\n00:20:02.562 --> 00:20:06.970\nas the need arises, gives us a better\nsense of how to approach this.\n\n380\n00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:11.231\nIf you wrote very narrowly defined\ncircumstances into legislation like this,\n\n381\n00:20:11.231 --> 00:20:14.666\nit would be highly effective for\na very small amount of things and\n\n382\n00:20:14.666 --> 00:20:18.691\nunfortunately very ineffective for\nvery large number of things, right?\n\n383\n00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:20.300\nTraditionally, if you think about it.\n\n384\n00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.390\nAnd so the opposite approach is,\ncreate the broad net and then let's try to\n\n385\n00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:29.360\ncapture as much as possible, and then\nlet's deal with situations as they arise.\n\n386\n00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.520\nHopefully having the support and\nelasticity, right,\n\n387\n00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.680\nwithin the framework to be able to\nunderstand how to interpret them.\n\n388\n00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.650\nOccasionally things fall to the wayside\nand may not fit neatly into a bucket and\n\n389\n00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.240\nmay be hard to deal with them,\nand that's why we have courts.\n\n390\n00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.505\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we go to, so to speak,\n\n391\n00:20:44.505 --> 00:20:47.972\nbefore the bench, to figure out\nwhat the right way to proceed is.\n\n392\n00:20:47.972 --> 00:20:51.478\nAnd we may have to pursue legal discourse\nin order to do that from time to time\n\n393\n00:20:51.478 --> 00:20:55.333\nbecause not everything is written in black\nand white and easily understandable.\n\n394\n00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:59.250\nBut this does apply to the majority\nsituations we often find ourselves in.\n\n395\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:04.218\nSo it is a good starting point,\nlet's put it that way,\n\n396\n00:21:04.218 --> 00:21:07.595\nit's a good way to build from there.\n\n397\n00:21:07.595 --> 00:21:11.175\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'll get off my soapbox, yeah.\n\n398\n00:21:11.175 --> 00:21:12.608\n&gt;&gt; All right, so does that make sense?\n\n399\n00:21:12.608 --> 00:21:13.392\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n400\n00:21:13.392 --> 00:21:15.219\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, I'm done.\n\n401\n00:21:15.219 --> 00:21:17.758\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't make me happy but\nit does make sense.\n\n402\n00:21:17.758 --> 00:21:18.525\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm sorry about that.\n\n403\n00:21:18.525 --> 00:21:19.164\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n404\n00:21:19.164 --> 00:21:21.255\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n405\n00:21:21.255 --> 00:21:23.402\n&gt;&gt; You can't make people\nhave common sense, though.\n\n406\n00:21:23.402 --> 00:21:25.062\nThat's the hard part.\n\n407\n00:21:25.062 --> 00:21:26.845\n&gt;&gt; You can, but it's a painful process.\n\n408\n00:21:26.845 --> 00:21:28.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n409\n00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Usually requires breaking laws.\n\n410\n00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.778\nAll right, so we are, I think, unless you\nhave any other questions or comments, and\n\n411\n00:21:35.778 --> 00:21:38.804\nI'm not sure you do, but\nif you do I'd be happy to entertain them.\n\n412\n00:21:38.804 --> 00:21:43.010\nIf not, I think we're out of discussion\ntopics on this particular area.\n\n413\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.260\nI wanted to just round this out,\nagain, walking through selectively,\n\n414\n00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.870\nareas within the document, showing\nyou the articles, how they interact.\n\n415\n00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.900\nMaking sure you have a sense of how\nto navigate through and see them.\n\n416\n00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.940\nReminding you about referring to article\nfour where a lot of those defined\n\n417\n00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.230\nterms will be, very helpful for us to\nunderstand how to use those in the context\n\n418\n00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.610\nof other conversations throughout\nthe remaining areas of the document.\n\n419\n00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.540\nWe're gonna continue delving\nthrough more of these areas.\n\n420\n00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.160\nOne of the upcoming episodes is gonna\nbe real interesting for you to watch.\n\n421\n00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.900\nWill be the overview on individual rights.\n\n422\n00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.632\nThere are eight rights called out\nspecifically within the framework\n\n423\n00:22:14.632 --> 00:22:15.155\nof the GDPR.\n\n424\n00:22:15.155 --> 00:22:17.788\nWe're gonna name them,\ngive you a high level overview of them.\n\n425\n00:22:17.788 --> 00:22:20.317\nWe've talked about a lot of them\nalready but we'll formalize them.\n\n426\n00:22:20.317 --> 00:22:23.552\nAnd then we're gonna have a series\nof episodes that drill into one or\n\n427\n00:22:23.552 --> 00:22:26.915\nmore of them and really do a little\nbit of a deeper dive around each one.\n\n428\n00:22:26.915 --> 00:22:30.013\nSo we're gonna lay them out for\nyou and then build some depth there for\n\n429\n00:22:30.013 --> 00:22:31.952\nyou to help you to understand them.\n\n430\n00:22:31.952 --> 00:22:35.390\nSo it'll be a good series of conversations\ncoming up to really help us to go\n\n431\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.850\na level deeper and really understand\nhow this is gonna apply to individuals.\n\n432\n00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.300\n&gt;&gt; All right, cool, well thank you so\nmuch Adam, and thank you guys for\n\n433\n00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.640\nbeing with us today.\n\n434\n00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.340\nBut we have more information headed\nyour

00:00:06.629\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.428\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.428 --> 00:00:11.966\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.849\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for joining us here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.400\nWelcome to your GDPR show.\n\n8\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.260\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.450\nIn this episode, we'll be specifically\nlooking at individual rights.\n\n10\n00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.550\nAnd with us today back in studio's\nwe have, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.920\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.970\n&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody.\n\n13\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.810\nAlways glad to see all of you.\n\n14\n00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.160\nWe are gonna talk about eight specific\nindividual rights that the GDRP\n\n15\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.470\nprovides for.\n\n16\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.810\nWithin the framework,\nwe're gonna name them for\n\n17\n00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.790\nyou just do a little high\nlevel summary on them.\n\n18\n00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.770\nAnd then, we'll actually have follow on\nepisodes that are drilled down a little\n\n19\n00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.170\ndeeper into specific points, or\nareas of interests around these right.\n\n20\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.510\nSo, wanna make sure you're\nthinking about this is kinda\n\n21\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.310\nlonger term thought process,\nin gathering up information.\n\n22\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.460\nFrom all these episode.\n\n23\n00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.820\nPut them together, to get a good sense\nof what these rights are, how they\n\n24\n00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.260\nare interpreted and not only the benefits\nthey accrue for us as individuals,\n\n25\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.160\nbut responsibilities and obligations, we\nmay have as IT practitioners or security\n\n26\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.150\nprofessionals, with regards to the GDPR\nand how these rights will be applied.\n\n27\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.260\nSo it's gonna be important information for\nus.\n\n28\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.150\nLet's start, and by the way, no particular\norder in terms or prioritizing,\n\n29\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.900\nmeaning, right number one is no less or\nmore important than right number eight.\n\n30\n00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.495\nBut we have to list them in some order.\n\n31\n00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:28.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So they are listed just based on how\n\n32\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.210\nwe will see them in the document, but I\njust wanna make sure you understand we're\n\n33\n00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.590\nnot prioritizing them by saying number\none versus number five, or number seven.\n\n34\n00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.490\nSo first one, the right to be informed.\n\n35\n00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.060\nWe've talked about this concept and\nthis right within the overview overall.\n\n36\n00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.430\nThe right to be inform and\nto be inform then obligation,\n\n37\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.946\nto provide fair processing of information.\n\n38\n00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:51.731\nQuoting.\n&gt;&gt; Air quoting.\n\n39\n00:01:51.731 --> 00:01:54.138\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fair processing of information,\n\n40\n00:01:54.138 --> 00:01:57.826\ntypically through a privacy notice,\nwe've talked about the impact of\n\n41\n00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:01.881\nprivacy notices with regards to the\nexample of the use of cookies on websites,\n\n42\n00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:04.390\non some of my comments and\nsome other episodes.\n\n43\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.601\nIn some episodes, I emphasize some of\nthe needs for transparency over how we\n\n44\n00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:09.970\nare using personal data,\nmeaning we have to make sure.\n\n45\n00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.380\nAs we think about the right to be\ninformed, both as the controller and\n\n46\n00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.265\nthe processor side of the conversation.\n\n47\n00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:20.925\nWho's doing the gathering, who's doing\nthe processing, who's overseeing that,\n\n48\n00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:24.525\nwhat data are we getting, how are we\ngonna manage it, lawfully processing.\n\n49\n00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:27.735\nAll things we've talked about,\nthat when we do that,\n\n50\n00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:31.920\nremember that the data subject has a right\nto be informed about the use of that data.\n\n51\n00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.057\nthe stipulated requirements around\ngathering through consent, and\n\n52\n00:02:35.057 --> 00:02:36.928\nall the things that we've talked about.\n\n53\n00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:40.168\nRight number two,\nthe right of access under the GDPR,\n\n54\n00:02:40.168 --> 00:02:42.706\nindividuals do have as we've talked about\n\n55\n00:02:42.706 --> 00:02:47.447\nthe right to obtain information about\nthemselves, about their information.\n\n56\n00:02:47.447 --> 00:02:51.763\nIn other words, if I maintain data\non a data subject under the GTPR,\n\n57\n00:02:51.763 --> 00:02:56.537\nthat data subject has the right of access\nto request from the controller and\n\n58\n00:02:56.537 --> 00:03:01.037\nprocessor, information about\nthe status of what we know about them.\n\n59\n00:03:01.037 --> 00:03:05.075\nAnd whether or not that information is\nup to date, accurate and consistent.\n\n60\n00:03:05.075 --> 00:03:08.365\nAnd remember, they have a right to claim\nthat they would like to have that removed.\n\n61\n00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:09.905\nThe right to be forgotten.\n\n62\n00:03:09.905 --> 00:03:11.869\nAnd we have this data processing,\n\n63\n00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.335\nthought processing capability\nby lawful processing.\n\n64\n00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:18.665\nBut also protection, with the role\nof the data protection officer.\n\n65\n00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.025\nWhich becomes the advocate,\nin many respects,\n\n66\n00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:25.230\nfor the rights of the individual, for\nthe data subject and their rights.\n\n67\n00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.620\nThe data protection officer, as we laid\nout in our conversation about that role.\n\n68\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.350\nIs the point person on\nbehalf of the controller and\n\n69\n00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.140\nprocessor function in the organization.\n\n70\n00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.160\nThey are the entity or the role that\nwould be dealing with data subjects,\n\n71\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.950\nif there is concern or\nneed for them to communicate.\n\n72\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.780\nThey are the conduit between the\norganization and the supervisory agency,\n\n73\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.560\nthat oversees and\nhandles complaints and concerns.\n\n74\n00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.430\nSo they become this middle ground so\nto speak, and this advocate on both sides.\n\n75\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.679\nThat is gonna control and\nprocess the flow of information.\n\n76\n00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:00.440\nSo right of access very important,\nright to confirm that their data is being\n\n77\n00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.203\nprocessed meaning the rights of the deaf\nsubject, rights to understand and\n\n78\n00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:06.880\naccess their personal\ndata on file to validate.\n\n79\n00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.890\nAnd verify that it is legitimate\nup-to-date and consistent.\n\n80\n00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.770\nAnd other supplementary information,\nreally around things in the Privacy.\n\n81\n00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.530\nNotice, meaning have the terms of\nservice in the terms of privacy\n\n82\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.320\nbeen applied properly if\nthey have been updated, or\n\n83\n00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.920\nneed of updating are we aware of that,\nwe see this for\n\n84\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.960\ninstance in the United States and in many\nother countries as well when, as of late.\n\n85\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.500\nWhen I say as of late, I mean,\nin the last several years.\n\n86\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.130\nAgain, anticipating the rolling\neffect of the implementation of\n\n87\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.950\nGDPR over the last couple of years,\nsince we've been ramping up.\n\n88\n00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.818\nYou see things like, we talked\nabout the now new notifications on\n\n89\n00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:47.139\nwebsites about the use of\nterms of privacy and cookies.\n\n90\n00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.801\nWe see those bars you and I have\ntalked about them in prior episodes.\n\n91\n00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:54.537\nAnd we saw them emerging in European\ncentric and European based businesses\n\n92\n00:04:54.537 --> 00:04:59.585\ninitially, and that has kind of rolled\nback into many other areas of the world.\n\n93\n00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:03.997\nAnd many companies regardless of\ngeography are using that now as a model,\n\n94\n00:05:03.997 --> 00:05:06.701\nbecause we know that that\ndoes meet the bar for\n\n95\n00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:11.199\nsatisfaction and verification under\nthe GDPR, so we see that happening.\n\n96\n00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.675\nBut also when you see credit card\ncompanies and vendors update their terms\n\n97\n00:05:14.675 --> 00:05:18.770\nof service, especially banks and credit\ncard companies cuz they tend to do this.\n\n98\n00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.350\nWhere they will send you maybe two to\nthree times per year depending on kind of\n\n99\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.760\ntheir cycle, they'll send you the updated\nterms of service in writing, so\n\n100\n00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.880\nthat you have a copy of them.\n\n101\n00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.770\nNot just post them online and\npoint you to them and\n\n102\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.060\nsay, by the way, read through ten page\nof stuff, there's been an update.\n\n103\n00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.740\nBut in the United States in particular,\nbecause of changes in the last several\n\n104\n00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.460\nyears to the rights of the consumer,\nunder the Obama administration.\n\n105\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.580\nAs that whole thought\nprocess went forward and\n\n106\n00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.742\nwas ultimately passed into law,\nat least as of now, anyway.\n\n107\n00:05:48.742 --> 00:05:51.534\nWe're waiting to see whether or not,\n[LAUGH] that will be modified under\n\n108\n00:05:51.534 --> 00:05:54.247\nthe current administration,\nwhat changes may be made ultimately.\n\n109\n00:05:54.247 --> 00:05:58.159\nBut currently anyway, banks have\na responsibility to notify you and\n\n110\n00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.802\nupdate you, when the terms of\nservice around your credit card or\n\n111\n00:06:01.802 --> 00:06:06.186\nyour bank usage changes, and the right\nto understand the rights of privacy,\n\n112\n00:06:06.186 --> 00:06:08.490\nand the rights of service overall.\n\n113\n00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.170\nAre enshrined there.\n\n114\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.960\nSo we do see a lot of this playing\nout in different geographies and\n\n115\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.430\ndifferent jurisdictions.\n\n116\n00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.300\nBut because of various and competitive\nneeds, we see generic behavior.\n\n117\n00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.115\nIt may not be specific in every entity.\n\n118\n00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:22.805\nBut in general,\nwe can lump them together and\n\n119\n00:06:22.805 --> 00:06:27.585\nsay these kinds of behaviors speak to this\nkind of a right, so just be aware of that.\n\n120\n00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:29.365\nSo right number two, the right of access.\n\n121\n00:06:29.365 --> 00:06:30.995\nRight number one,\nthe right to be informed.\n\n122\n00:06:30.995 --> 00:06:33.885\nRight number three,\nthe right to rectification.\n\n123\n00:06:33.885 --> 00:06:37.727\nThe right to rectification is the right to\nunderstand that if our data is inaccurate\n\n124\n00:06:37.727 --> 00:06:41.817\nfor some reason, we have the right to\npoint that out, to then seek redress and\n\n125\n00:06:41.817 --> 00:06:45.967\nhave that, assuming we can validate\nthat legitimately, have that updated.\n\n126\n00:06:45.967 --> 00:06:49.118\nAnd we have the right to have that\ndone in a timely fashion, right?\n\n127\n00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:52.257\nSo, we can think of this as integrity,\nif you wanna think about it around data.\n\n128\n00:06:52.257 --> 00:06:53.821\nWe've talked about it that way before.\n\n129\n00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:57.809\nIndividuals are entitled to have personal\ndata rectified, if it is inaccurate or\n\n130\n00:06:57.809 --> 00:06:59.788\nincomplete is what the GDPR says.\n\n131\n00:06:59.788 --> 00:07:02.478\nIf we have disclosed the personal\ndata in question to third parties,\n\n132\n00:07:02.478 --> 00:07:06.988\nmeaning you as the controller-processor\nhave disclosed that to third parties,\n\n133\n00:07:06.988 --> 00:07:10.640\nthen we, the controller-processor\nfunction, have a right and\n\n134\n00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.180\na responsibility to go and update that,\nis the downstream discussion that we had.\n\n135\n00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.840\nWe have to inform them of\nthe rectification where possible.\n\n136\n00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.229\nwe also have to inform individuals about\nthe third party's to whom data has been\n\n137\n00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:25.599\ndisclosed where appropriator's\npart of this right.\n\n138\n00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:29.830\nSo for instance, if we,\nlet's just say hypothetically,\n\n139\n00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.600\nas the controller processor entity,\nperhaps our Megacorp A.\n\n140\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.840\nWe'll call ourselves Megacorp A, Megabank\nA, whatever you wanna call yourself.\n\n141\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.410\nAnd if we are the global entity of this\nconglomerate set of financial service\n\n142\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.830\nbusinesses, and we own that data,\nand we then find out\n\n143\n00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.970\nbecause we have shared it downstream with\nthird parties, other lines of business.\n\n144\n00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.102\nThat are underneath our umbrella and\nperhaps partner with our organizations.\n\n145\n00:07:56.102 --> 00:07:59.702\nAnd then we found out through a submission\nfrom the user that the right to\n\n146\n00:07:59.702 --> 00:08:02.430\nrectification has been\ncalled in question and.\n\n147\n00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.860\nThere's an update to\nthe status of that data.\n\n148\n00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.038\nWe would have to push those updates down\nto those other lines of business and\n\n149\n00:08:08.038 --> 00:08:12.150\nbest effort, attempt to update them\nbecause we have that responsibility\n\n150\n00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.830\ndeclared under this right.\n\n151\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.520\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that and\nwe think about that.\n\n152\n00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.560\nBecause it's not enough just to say hey,\nI updated into the main database, but\n\n153\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.240\nall those other places, I know nothing\nabout, I'm not on the hook for.\n\n154\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.840\nQuite the opposite, GDPR says,\n\n155\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.080\nby the way, you need to make sure you pay\nattention that you are updating that.\n\n156\n00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.460\n&gt;&gt; Which kind of falls in line with\nthe next clause that we look at,\n\n157\n00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.580\nfor the erasure portion as well.\n\n158\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.700\nYou should also,\ncoming from an IT perspective,\n\n159\n00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.950\nyou know maybe I had a catastrophic\nsituation on a particular server,\n\n160\n00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.390\nthere was some kind of\nfail over implementation.\n\n161\n00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.220\nAnd you need to think about these things,\nlike hey, I might erase or change\n\n162\n00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.460\nsomething in one particular location, but\nif I ever have to pull those backups in or\n\n163\n00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.830\nwhatever, you have to\nmaintain those as well.\n\n164\n00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.670\n&gt;&gt; Not exactly,\n\n165\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.770\nthe right to erasure is more commonly\ncalled the right to be forgotten.\n\n166\n00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; To the right to be forgotten,\n\n167\n00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:04.570\nthe idea that we can claim as an\nindividual that we would like our data to\n\n168\n00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.700\nbe removed and\nno longer be referenced in the data set.\n\n169\n00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.540\nAnd that the exact opposite\nof what you're implying.\n\n170\n00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.870\nThat as a result the controller\nprocessor has the responsibility now,\n\n171\n00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.860\nto go through and remove our data from\nany and all places where it may reside.\n\n172\n00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:25.020\nAnd to certify to us that that data\nrequest for removal has been carried out.\n\n173\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.170\n&gt;&gt; For sure, that's what I'm saying.\n\n174\n00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.440\nIf I wanted to be removed from a do\nnot call list or something and\n\n175\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.320\nthen they pulled a backup with\nmy information still in and\n\n176\n00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.310\nI get a call next week,\nI'm not going to be too happy about that.\n\n177\n00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.660\n&gt;&gt; Right, my point is they would have to,\nthey being the controlled processor.\n\n178\n00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.912\nWould have to, under the GDPR, figure\nout a way to ensure that if they had\n\n179\n00:09:43.912 --> 00:09:48.375\nto restore a system to a certain point\nin time, that the rights that have been\n\n180\n00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:53.168\ncarried out with regards to erasure are\noverlapped as part of that restoration.\n\n181\n00:09:53.168 --> 00:09:55.040\nSo that they don't do what\nyou were describing, right?\n\n182\n00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.677\nIn other words, they don't say hey\nlet's put back on the list, right?\n\n183\n00:09:58.677 --> 00:10:01.550\nWhen you said you wanted to be off\nthe list, or whatever the case may be.\n\n184\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.890\nSo we do have to understand\nthat that happens but\n\n185\n00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.700\nin addition,\nthere is a right to have a speedy outcome.\n\n186\n00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.290\nIn other words,\nwe have talked about in some other areas\n\n187\n00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.010\nthe fact that we submit this request,\nand speedy is relative.\n\n188\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.320\nWe talked about the fact that it\nhas to happen within one month.\n\n189\n00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.120\nThat's the actual language and\n\n190\n00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.870\nthat the controller-processor function\nhas typically one month to respond.\n\n191\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.600\nWhich may seem like a lot of time to us,\nif we want our data removed,\n\n192\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.970\nbut is a realistic amount of time for\nan entity that may be a global entity,\n\n193\n00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.830\nthink Google, think Microsoft,\nthink Amazon, right?\n\n194\n00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.770\nTo have to figure out how to do that,\nand to respond in a timely fashion.\n\n195\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.833\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, if there's an influx, like\nwith Equifax here in the United States or\n\n196\n00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:45.600\nsomething, and they have thousands of\nrequests at one particular time and\n\n197\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.890\nmonth could be even cutting it\nclose in certain situations.\n\n198\n00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.720\n&gt;&gt; It could and so there's an opt\nout extension where you actually as\n\n199\n00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.200\na provider, if you can show undo burden.\n\n200\n00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Again, kind of generically defined.\n\n201\n00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.280\nMeaning the complexity of the request,\n\n202\n00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.770\nagain kind of an open ended\ndefinition of what that may mean.\n\n203\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.510\nRepetitive requests\nare considered complex.\n\n204\n00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.060\nRequests from and\n\n205\n00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.410\nor dealing with multiple, different areas\nof data could be considered complex.\n\n206\n00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.730\nThere's a list of categorization there but\n\n207\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:20.090\nultimately if we see something\nunder that header of complex and or\n\n208\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.370\nunrealistic or\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n209\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.510\nA lot of effort,\n\n210\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.440\nI can't just think of the proper term\nthat it's in the document right now.\n\n211\n00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.735\nBut essentially, if it requires a-\n&gt;&gt; Undue amount.\n\n212\n00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:34.353\n&gt;&gt; Super human effort, right.?\n\n213\n00:11:34.353 --> 00:11:36.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; To carry out, then we actually have\n\n214\n00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.650\nthe ability to go back and say we can't\nrespond within 30 days, one month.\n\n215\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.770\nWe can seek a two month extension\nas the controller process or\n\n216\n00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.260\nfunction to claim that\nwe need more time and\n\n217\n00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.380\nwe can then do that under certain\nstrictly controlled circumstances.\n\n218\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.030\nBut we then have to notify the data\nsubject that we are doing that and\n\n219\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.000\nwe are seeking that and\npushing it out another 60 days,\n\n220\n00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.370\nroughly another two months.\n\n221\n00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.620\nAnd we have to notify them within the one\nmonth period that we're not gonna meet\n\n222\n00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.660\nthe one month deadline and we're gonna\npush out for an additional two months.\n\n223\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.890\nSo there is some give and take there,\n\n224\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.950\nthere is some complexity\naround how we deal with this.\n\n225\n00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.030\nBut ultimately the right to erasure or\n\n226\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.930\nmore commonly called\nthe right to be forgotten.\n\n227\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.420\nEven though it is formally\ncalled the right to erasure,\n\n228\n00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.810\nthat's how it's defined in the GDPR.\n\n229\n00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.430\nIt's this idea of the ability for\nus to demand, politely of course, right.\n\n230\n00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That we have our data removed,\n\n231\n00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.240\nassuming that we have justifiable\nreason to do so as the data subjects.\n\n232\n00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.280\nJust wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n233\n00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.690\nNow, along with that we have\na right to restrict processing,\n\n234\n00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.990\nright number five as we\njust go down the list.\n\n235\n00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.265\nThe right to restrict processing\nwhen processing is restricted,\n\n236\n00:12:39.265 --> 00:12:43.592\nwe are still, as controller and processor,\npermitted to store the personal data, but\n\n237\n00:12:43.592 --> 00:12:45.247\nsimply just not for the process.\n\n238\n00:12:45.247 --> 00:12:49.360\nMeaning we can archive it,\nwe can save it, maintain it, but\n\n239\n00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.523\nwe're not able to then actively I use\nit for additional processing and there\n\n240\n00:12:54.523 --> 00:12:59.625\nare reasons why this may be necessary for\nexceptions like the public good.\n\n241\n00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:04.660\nFor exceptions where we are having to\ncomply with the contract obligation.\n\n242\n00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.604\nThere's a list of these exceptions that\nwe've talked about in other areas.\n\n243\n00:13:07.604 --> 00:13:11.425\nWe are allowed to retain just enough\ninformation about the individual to ensure\n\n244\n00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:14.110\nthat the restriction is\nrespected in the future.\n\n245\n00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.380\nMeaning Cherokee may say hey remove\nme from that call list like you\n\n246\n00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.190\nwere suggesting, right?\n\n247\n00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.475\nPut me on,\nrather put me on the do not call list.\n\n248\n00:13:20.475 --> 00:13:22.955\nRemove me, but\nput me on the Do Not Call list.\n\n249\n00:13:22.955 --> 00:13:25.165\nAnd we will say, okay, no problem.\n\n250\n00:13:25.165 --> 00:13:29.695\nAnd that means maybe we wipe out certain\ninformation from your record, but\n\n251\n00:13:29.695 --> 00:13:31.415\nwe could still maintain information.\n\n252\n00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:33.807\nSo we'll maintain your name, for instance.\n\n253\n00:13:33.807 --> 00:13:36.617\nWe may or may not retain\na reference to your phone number.\n\n254\n00:13:36.617 --> 00:13:38.077\nMaybe because you're on\nthe do not call list,\n\n255\n00:13:38.077 --> 00:13:40.297\nmaybe we wipe that piece of information.\n\n256\n00:13:40.297 --> 00:13:43.869\nBut we may maintain a reference\nto your address for instance, or\n\n257\n00:13:43.869 --> 00:13:48.236\nsomething like that to keep your record\nactive and valid in our data system, so\n\n258\n00:13:48.236 --> 00:13:51.694\nwe can maintain the integrity and\nthe validation of the data.\n\n259\n00:13:51.694 --> 00:13:55.366\nBut not enough to continue using it for\nprocessing going forward unless we were to\n\n260\n00:13:55.366 --> 00:13:58.980\ngo back to you, get you to opt back in and\nprovide additional information.\n\n261\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So it is important just to be\n\n262\n00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:00.970\naware of that.\n\n263\n00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.930\nSo we call that the right\nto restrict processing and\n\n264\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.050\nthen the right to data\nportability number six.\n\n265\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.320\nI'm thinking portobello mushroom when\nI'm saying portability in my head.\n\n266\n00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.840\n&gt;&gt; As long as you're not thinking\nportal potty, then we're good to go.\n\n267\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.316\n&gt;&gt; No, no,\nnot thinking portal portal potty.\n\n268\n00:14:15.316 --> 00:14:17.765\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the right to data portability.\n\n269\n00:14:17.765 --> 00:14:20.110\nPorter potties and\nPortobello mushrooms are optional.\n\n270\n00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.185\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the right to data portability allows\n\n271\n00:14:22.185 --> 00:14:25.305\nindividuals to obtain or\nreuse their personal data for\n\n272\n00:14:25.305 --> 00:14:27.525\ntheir own purposes across\ndifferent services.\n\n273\n00:14:27.525 --> 00:14:29.372\nThat's the language in the standard.\n\n274\n00:14:29.372 --> 00:14:34.512\nSo we think about potentially maybe be\nable to take our account information\n\n275\n00:14:34.512 --> 00:14:37.742\nfrom one end to the year one\ninternet service provider,\n\n276\n00:14:37.742 --> 00:14:42.056\none cloud service provider, one financial\nservice provider, one health provider,\n\n277\n00:14:42.056 --> 00:14:43.976\nthe list goes on and on potentially.\n\n278\n00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:47.896\nAnd be able to move it, copy it,\nand or transfer it to another.\n\n279\n00:14:47.896 --> 00:14:51.286\nThe goal here is to understand\nthat we have to do so in a safe,\n\n280\n00:14:51.286 --> 00:14:54.570\nsecure way without undue\nhindrance to usability.\n\n281\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:59.282\nMeaning if a vendor stores their data,\non you on a proprietary format that\n\n282\n00:14:59.282 --> 00:15:03.310\nonly that vendor can use, and\nthere's no ability to export and\n\n283\n00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:07.192\nmove that data into a standardized\nnon proprietary format.\n\n284\n00:15:07.192 --> 00:15:10.680\nThat other services can consume\nthen the controller process or\n\n285\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.010\nfunction is not living up to\nthe other end of the bargain.\n\n286\n00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.710\nAnd can actually be found to be in\nviolation of this particular regulation\n\n287\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.990\nwithin the GDPR, and we actually\ncall out technological standards.\n\n288\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.100\nI had this conversation with you in some\nof the overview areas, where Mike and\n\n289\n00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.490\nI were discussing this.\n\n290\n00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:32.180\nCSV comes separated value, as a file X4\nformat is actually formally called that.\n\n291\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.550\nIn a GDPR,\nas an example of an industry wide,\n\n292\n00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.810\nstandardized format that all vendors.\n\n293\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.890\nCan work against, as opposed to saying,\nall vendors must standardize only on this.\n\n294\n00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.180\nWhat we say is,\nyou maintain your own systems.\n\n295\n00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.160\nThe GDPR is clear.\n\n296\n00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.230\nYou don't have to standardize on X,\nY, or Z format.\n\n297\n00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.530\nWe're not being prescriptive in telling\nyou, change the way you do business.\n\n298\n00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.520\nWe are being prescriptive\nin the sense we're saying,\n\n299\n00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.530\nwe much reach a lowest common denominator,\nright?\n\n300\n00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.226\nAs a format, if you think of it that way.\n\n301\n00:15:57.226 --> 00:15:59.805\nAnd although,\nCSV is not the only one that exists.\n\n302\n00:15:59.805 --> 00:16:01.470\nIt is one that is pretty ubiquitous.\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty universal, yeah.\n\n303\n00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:02.620\n&gt;&gt; And pretty useful to anybody.\n\n304\n00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:07.365\nSo, it's an example of one that anybody\nand everybody, in theory, could shoot for,\n\n305\n00:16:07.365 --> 00:16:09.300\nand most likely align with.\n\n306\n00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.010\nEven though we may maintain\nproprietary data sets,\n\n307\n00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.220\nwe have to have the ability to\nthen export into a common format.\n\n308\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.440\nAs long as we meet that burden,\nthen we are considered to be aligned.\n\n309\n00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.530\nThe right to object.\n\n310\n00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.410\nSo the right to object is\nimportant here as well.\n\n311\n00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.095\nThe right to my keyboard\nworking is also important.\n\n312\n00:16:27.095 --> 00:16:27.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n313\n00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.720\n[LAUGH] All right, so the right to object.\n\n314\n00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.530\nIndividuals have the right to object,\nright, to certain things.\n\n315\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.030\nProcessing based on legitimate\ninterests of the performance of a task.\n\n316\n00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:41.400\nIn the public interest or exercise of\nofficial authority, including profiling.\n\n317\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.950\nMeaning, you have something that's done,\nnot to our liking.\n\n318\n00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.830\nWe have the right to say,\nI don't like that.\n\n319\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.910\nThe controller processor entity has\nthe right to come back and say well,\n\n320\n00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.980\nthese are the overriding circumstances.\n\n321\n00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.450\nAnd we have that conversation.\n\n322\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.380\nWell, we have the right to object when\nthings are not done in a certain way.\n\n323\n00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.820\nDirect marketing, and\n\n324\n00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.360\nincluding profiling of us as part of the\ndata set, may be an objectionable offense.\n\n325\n00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.330\nWe may not wanna be\nincluded in that data haul,\n\n326\n00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.860\nand we may have the right\nto object that we were.\n\n327\n00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:10.480\nAnd processing for purposes of scientific\nhistorical research and statistics, right?\n\n328\n00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.940\nSo we have the ideas here that data\nsubjects have the right to control\n\n329\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:15.920\ntheir data.\n\n330\n00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.260\nAnd may object to certain uses of\nit without opt in without consent,\n\n331\n00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.200\nyou may not be able to just\nautomatically go and use their data.\n\n332\n00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.370\nWhich takes us to right number eight,\n\n333\n00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:29.010\nright in relation to automated\ndecision making and profiling.\n\n334\n00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.630\nWhich is also an important right.\n\n335\n00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.390\nThe GDPR provides safeguards for\n\n336\n00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.810\nindividuals against the risks of decision\nbeing made in an automated fashion or\n\n337\n00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:40.260\nwith an automated system with no\nhuman oversight or intervention.\n\n338\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.740\nSo if you have these massive BI firms,\nBusiness Intelligence firms and\n\n339\n00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.880\ndata analytics systems that are trolling,\nlooking for\n\n340\n00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.590\nrecord matches among massive data leaks or\ndata sets.\n\n341\n00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.700\nAnd it's all automated,\nthere's no human intervention.\n\n342\n00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.340\nAnd we suddenly show up on match\nlists because we meet a bunch\n\n343\n00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.280\nof profile criteria, whatever that may be.\n\n344\n00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.450\nAnd we are not happy or\ncomfortable with that.\n\n345\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.900\nAnd we get wind of that for\nwhatever reason, we have the right,\n\n346\n00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.760\nunder the right to object,\nto object to that behavior.\n\n347\n00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.360\nAnd under the right to provide safeguards\nin relation to automated decision making\n\n348\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:19.940\nand profiling, we have the right to bring\nan objection to a supervisory agency.\n\n349\n00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.060\nProbably through a data protection\nofficer and as a result of that,\n\n350\n00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.790\ndepending on what happens, we may be\nable to be removed from that process and\n\n351\n00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.060\nhave our data wiped from that system.\n\n352\n00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.370\nBut we are guaranteed, as individuals,\nas data subjects, permissions\n\n353\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:37.180\nto be able to object to protections around\nthe use of our data without our knowledge,\n\n354\n00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.140\nwithout our consent,\nand without oversight.\n\n355\n00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.492\nWhich is very important, as I said,\nof framework rights within the GDPR.\n\n356\n00:18:43.492 --> 00:18:46.865\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying,\nif I were browsing on a dating site like,\n\n357\n00:18:46.865 --> 00:18:51.160\nfarmersmatch.com or something,\nand I see your profile,\n\n358\n00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.050\nthen I say, hey Adam, you are looking for\na farmer, or something.\n\n359\n00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.180\nAnd you say,\nokay we need to get this fixed.\n\n360\n00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.830\nYou would have the right to go ahead and\n\n361\n00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.750\nsay, I object to my information\nbeing stored in this capacity.\n\n362\n00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.690\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, it would depend.\n\n363\n00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.160\nWell let's maybe take\na different approach.\n\n364\n00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.330\nMaybe somebody set that profile up,\nwith or without my knowledge first of all,\n\n365\n00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.360\nand if I had set it up myself,\nand I knew it was there,\n\n366\n00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.570\nthen I really don't have a leg to stand\non, with regards to a right to object.\n\n367\n00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.440\nBecause I consented to put the profile in.\n\n368\n00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.800\n&gt;&gt; Forced that, in some aspect.\n\n369\n00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.970\n&gt;&gt; Right, so if something was\ndone without my knowledge which\n\n370\n00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.770\nwould be the case let's say hypothetically\nan example you gave me where you said,\n\n371\n00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.496\nhey I see you're looking for whatever.\n\n372\n00:19:33.496 --> 00:19:34.498\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n373\n00:19:34.498 --> 00:19:38.297\nI had a knowledge of that then I would\nsay well, we would probably both agree,\n\n374\n00:19:38.297 --> 00:19:42.039\nokay maybe somebody did that without\nmy knowledge, a masquerade or spoof or\n\n375\n00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:43.010\nwhatever.\n\n376\n00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.540\nI could then certainly under\nseveral of these rights go\n\n377\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.770\nto the controller processor function.\n\n378\n00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:52.030\nAnd lodge a complaint about the data\nbeing there, incorrectly, inaccurately,\n\n379\n00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.770\nunder a variety of guises.\n\n380\n00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.920\nAnd as a result, I could probably,\n\n381\n00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.960\nmost forthrightly under the right to\nbe forgotten, a right of erasure,\n\n382\n00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.745\nas we say said, I could simply claim,\nhey, I want that data removed.\n\n383\n00:20:02.745 --> 00:20:04.245\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That would probably be the quickest and\n\n384\n00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.325\nmost expedient path to get it done.\n\n385\n00:20:06.325 --> 00:20:11.135\nBut I do have as a subset of those rights,\nsurrounding them, the right to object.\n\n386\n00:20:11.135 --> 00:20:13.315\nSo it's a great way to think about it.\n\n387\n00:20:13.315 --> 00:20:17.115\nBut let's take it to a different\narea because obviously, clearly,\n\n388\n00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:20.605\nwhen somebody does something without your\nknowledge, even outside of the GDPR,\n\n389\n00:20:20.605 --> 00:20:22.345\nyou usually have recourse.\n\n390\n00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:23.255\n&gt;&gt; Entering other realms.\n\n391\n00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:24.750\n&gt;&gt; In some cases, right?\n\n392\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.520\nBut let's think about it as being\nthe fact that maybe I've opted in.\n\n393\n00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.020\nSo let's say something was not\ndone without my permission.\n\n394\n00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:31.710\nWithout my knowledge.\n\n395\n00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.160\nBut rather I've opted in to give my\ndata to a controller processor function\n\n396\n00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.760\nunder the guise of\ncertain collection rules.\n\n397\n00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:44.430\nSo you come to me Cherokee and say Adam\nI'm gonna run this set of questions for\n\n398\n00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.186\nresearch by a whole bunch of people.\n\n399\n00:20:47.186 --> 00:20:51.841\nAnd I'd like you to participate, here\nis the terms that I'm gonna essentially\n\n400\n00:20:51.841 --> 00:20:55.280\ngather the data under and\nwould you be willing to opt-in?\n\n401\n00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.120\nRight, and I say, okay, yeah,\nI read them, I'm gonna opt-in.\n\n402\n00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.000\nI'll let you use my data.\n\n403\n00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.350\nAnd the answers to your questions\naround my interpretation of that data,\n\n404\n00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.080\nprovided that we stick to these terms.\n\n405\n00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.990\nSo you and I agree,\n\n406\n00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.740\nwhich is essentially the spirit of\nthe GDPR that we've been talking about.\n\n407\n00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.850\nYou provide terms that are clear and\n\n408\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.990\nunequivocal as\nthe controller-processor function.\n\n409\n00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.210\nYou get me to opt-in unequivocably,\nand actively, and\n\n410\n00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.920\nof my own free will affirmatively,\nso we've done that.\n\n411\n00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.520\nAnd then you go off, gather your data,\nyou store it safely and securely, and\n\n412\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.780\nthen you use it for\nthe terms that have been specified.\n\n413\n00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.520\nSo that essentially the gist\nof what we're talking about.\n\n414\n00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.380\nSo let's say all that happened.\n\n415\n00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Everything's good, but then that data\n\n416\n00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:42.100\nsomehow makes it into a larger\nstream of data that maybe for\n\n417\n00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.500\nwhatever reason, I was not informed about-\n&gt;&gt; Used for another purpose?\n\n418\n00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.025\n&gt;&gt; Wasn't part of the terms,\nused for another purpose.\n\n419\n00:21:48.025 --> 00:21:50.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You may or may not as the controller or\n\n420\n00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.960\nprocessor have had\nknowledge of that happening\n\n421\n00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.650\nkind of irrelevant from where\nI stand as the data subject.\n\n422\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.100\nBecause it's data subject I opted in for\n\n423\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.260\na very specific on how we define set\nof terms and usage, I didn't opt in for\n\n424\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.970\nyou to,\n&gt;&gt; Free range.\n\n425\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.910\n&gt;&gt; Sell that list to a third party.\n\n426\n00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.400\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Or let it be borrowed or\n\n427\n00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.620\nhowever it got there whatever it was.\n\n428\n00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.690\nBut I didn't opt-in for, let's say,\nexercise number two, whatever that was.\n\n429\n00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:18.240\nAnd if that happens and then I get wind\nof that because maybe as a result of\n\n430\n00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.630\nthe automated flow of that data,\nthe analysis of it,\n\n431\n00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.490\nwhatever happened that suddenly I'm\ngetting all this new marketing mail.\n\n432\n00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:30.350\nAnd not just for farmers, but for\nfarm implements, farm animals, and for\n\n433\n00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:34.090\ntime shares and Fernando County or\nwhoever it may be, right?\n\n434\n00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.230\nOr Parkland or wherever.\n\n435\n00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:40.350\nAnd so as a result,\nI suddenly say what's going on here?\n\n436\n00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.520\nYou and I agreed Cherokee, what happened?\n\n437\n00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:46.450\nAnd it seems like whatever you and\nI agreed to, kind of went sideways.\n\n438\n00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So I don't really know.\n\n439\n00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.140\nI have no knowledge of it.\n\n440\n00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.720\nAnd I don't know what happened, but\nclearly, somehow, some way, right,\n\n441\n00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.830\nsomething happened.\n\n442\n00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.920\nThen at that point, again,\nthe right to erase,\n\n443\n00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.350\nyour right to be forgotten is probably\nthe most expedient way to go through this.\n\n444\n00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:05.150\nBut we just wanna be clear that we have\na right to object, which surrounds and\n\n445\n00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.060\nunderlies the right to erasure.\n\n446\n00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.420\nBecause you have the ability to lodge\na complaint to formally request,\n\n447\n00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.880\nright, that your data be removed and\nyou have protections under the rights\n\n448\n00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.740\nin relation to automated\ndecision making and profiling.\n\n449\n00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:23.460\nTo safeguard your data as the data\nsubject from non-human automated activity\n\n450\n00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.690\nthat will expose you unnecessarily,\nin ways that you are not comfortable with.\n\n451\n00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:28.240\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Sure\n\n452\n00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.980\n&gt;&gt; These are all interrelated.\n\n453\n00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.980\n&gt;&gt; Well it all makes sense and\n\n454\n00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:34.040\nwith the advent of AI I could see\nhow that's a very likely scenario.\n\n455\n00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.490\n&gt;&gt; It's becoming more and more likely.\n\n456\n00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.532\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And just even today without even really\n\n457\n00:23:37.532 --> 00:23:40.979\nthinking about all of the future stuff\nthat could happen we see more and more.\n\n458\n00:23:40.979 --> 00:23:44.949\nThese massive marketing engines that\nare spinning up on the Internet for\n\n459\n00:23:44.949 --> 00:23:47.140\na variety of things around just.\n\n460\n00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:47.789\nJust about anything\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n461\n00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:51.032\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you could look at Amazon not\npicking out anyone company by no mean\n\n462\n00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:54.330\nsaying they're guilty of this just\npointing out a company with the global\n\n463\n00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.622\nreach like Amazon, right?\n\n464\n00:23:55.622 --> 00:23:58.760\nFor instance where there are marketing.\n\n465\n00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.996\nHundreds of millions of items.\n\n466\n00:23:59.996 --> 00:24:04.064\nAlibaba would be essentially the\nequivalent in Asia, for instance, right.\n\n467\n00:24:04.064 --> 00:24:08.679\nAnd anyone or both of them, marketing\nthese items when you go to buy something\n\n468\n00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:11.803\nand having enough profiling\ncapabilities and BI and\n\n469\n00:24:11.803 --> 00:24:14.295\nanalytic capabilities in their system.\n\n470\n00:24:14.295 --> 00:24:16.082\nThat the minute you make a purchase Ebay,\n\n471\n00:24:16.082 --> 00:24:19.190\nwould probably essentially fall\ninto this category as well.\n\n472\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.387\nThat any or all of them can\nmake recommendations to you,\n\n473\n00:24:21.387 --> 00:24:22.620\nwe've all seen this, right.\n\n474\n00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; On websites and where, you bought this,\n\n475\n00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.790\nyou probably wanna see\nthese 5,000 other things,\n\n476\n00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:30.921\nthat are somehow tangentially related\nto people that buy this, right.\n\n477\n00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:33.383\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I wanna see your\nsuggestion list Adam,.\n\n478\n00:24:33.383 --> 00:24:36.100\n&gt;&gt; No, you don't wanna see my\nsuggestion list, right. &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n479\n00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.660\n&gt;&gt; Right, so the idea would be that it's\n\n480\n00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.050\nalready happening,\nit's been happening for some time.\n\n481\n00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.210\nAnd it's just an extension\nof what we already see.\n\n482\n00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:49.570\nBut what we're seeing is the GDPR stepping\nup and saying, guess what, right.\n\n483\n00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:53.410\nAs a user, as a data subject,\nas a projected individual,\n\n484\n00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.950\nyou have the ability to control\nhow your data will be consumed.\n\n485\n00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.260\nWhere it will be consumed,\nunder what circumstances, and to what end.\n\n486\n00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.810\nWithin narrowly,\n\n487\n00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.240\nin some cases, perhaps more broadly\nin other cases, to find parameters.\n\n488\n00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.370\nThis is not a blanket protection\nwhere you can say, I don't like you,\n\n489\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:09.790\nyou can't use my data.\n\n490\n00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.178\nIt's not like that,\nbecause that's unrealistic.\n\n491\n00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:15.190\nIf you opted in you've given people\nthe permission to use your data\n\n492\n00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:16.520\nunder controlled circumstances.\n\n493\n00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.440\nAs long as everybody plays fair and\nabove board and everybody\n\n494\n00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.950\npays attention to that, then the GDRP\nsays, look, you gotta go along, right.\n\n495\n00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:25.820\nYou do have the option to opt\nout if you choose to, but\n\n496\n00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.680\nunless you opt out, you've signed on and\nthis is what's going to happen.\n\n497\n00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.780\nIf the terms of search included\nprovisioning of data to third parties,\n\n498\n00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.221\nthen you have to understand\nthat that's gonna happen.\n\n499\n00:25:35.221 --> 00:25:37.841\nYou may not like that like that, and you\nmay choose to opt out at that point, and\n\n500\n00:25:37.841 --> 00:25:38.571\nyou have that right.\n\n501\n00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:41.480\nBut you have to understand that could\nbe part of the terms of service.\n\n502\n00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.360\nSo we have to really understand and\nwe have to really read and\n\n503\n00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.300\ncarefully interpret what information\nwe're being given through the controller\n\n504\n00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:53.900\nprocessor role in order to understand\nas a data subject, what will and\n\n505\n00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.040\nwill not be acceptable.\n\n506\n00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.510\nWhat will and will not be\nan expectation of what will and\n\n507\n00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.210\nwill not happen with our data.\n\n508\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.330\nBut both parties have to\nclearly communicate and\n\n509\n00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.410\nbe unequivocal about their expectations.\n\n510\n00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.470\nIt's very, very important and\nvery clear in the GDPR that,\n\n511\n00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.340\nthat is the expectation going forward.\n\n512\n00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.440\n&gt;&gt; Communication.\n\n513\n00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.950\n&gt;&gt; Communication broadly,\nwidely and with the proper intent.\n\n514\n00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:13.830\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n515\n00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking at the clock,\nwe're getting close on time.\n\n516\n00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.574\nAre we gonna go ahead and\nkinda put a bookmark here and\n\n517\n00:26:19.574 --> 00:26:22.707\nthen pick back up in the next show,\nor what do you think Adam?\n\n518\n00:26:22.707 --> 00:26:23.753\n&gt;&gt; You got any good jokes?\n\n519\n00:26:23.753 --> 00:26:24.888\n&gt;&gt; I don't.\n\n520\n00:26:24.888 --> 00:26:26.521\n&gt;&gt; No good privacy jokes?\n\n521\n00:26:26.521 --> 00:26:28.279\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No but.\n\n522\n00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:29.289\n&gt;&gt; Two privacy officers walk in to a bar.\n\n523\n00:26:29.289 --> 00:26:30.858\n&gt;&gt; They're too private to talk about that.\n\n524\n00:26:30.858 --> 00:26:33.120\n&gt;&gt; They're too private to talk about it,\nokay, then I guess we're gonna be done.\n\n525\n00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n526\n00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.490\n&gt;&gt; I guess we'll come back and we'll talk\nabout our deep dives into these rights.\n\n527\n00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.628\nRemember I said in some cases\nwe'll have a lot to say,\n\n528\n00:26:39.628 --> 00:26:41.900\nin some we'll maybe\ngroup a couple together.\n\n529\n00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.490\nJust to kinda coordinate their thought\nprocess cuz they're very similar.\n\n530\n00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:48.840\nBut we'll come back through and look at\neach one or groupings of these rights\n\n531\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.110\nwith a little bit more specificity, and\nthat'll be through the upcoming episode.\n\n532\n00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.500\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan,\nthank you for your time, and thank you for\n\n533\n00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.270\nyour time as well.\n\n534\n00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:58.700\nBut you don't wanna miss the second\nhalf of this information, stay tuned.\n\n535\n00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.380\nBut for this show, I'll go ahead and sign\nout, I've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n536\n00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.180\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n537\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.844\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro TV.\n\n538\n00:27:05.844 -->

00:00:07.145\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:12.070\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.100\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your GDPR series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.149\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.195\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat, well, the right to be informed.\n\n8\n00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:23.878\nAnd that's because you have\nthe right to be informed,\n\n9\n00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:27.435\nonly if you are a citizen of the EU,\nthough, right?\n\n10\n00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:29.090\n[LAUGH] I don't know, but\n\n11\n00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.640\nat least we have Adam Gordon here\ntoday to clarify this topic.\n\n12\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.348\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to wait to see how you\nwere gonna dig yourself out of that hole.\n\n13\n00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:37.229\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Keep digging.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n14\n00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:40.489\nJust thought it would be something I can,\nyou'll inform us as to whether or\n\n15\n00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.340\nnot we're supposed to be informed.\n\n16\n00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.043\nAll right, so we are gonna talk about,\n\n17\n00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.740\nwe never know what's gonna\nhappen when Cherokee is hosting.\n\n18\n00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.720\nIt's always, always a mystery usually\nright up until the moment it does happen\n\n19\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.720\nand then of course you see it\nhappen live just like we do.\n\n20\n00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.325\nAll right, we do love you Cherokee.\n\n21\n00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:57.769\nThank you for being here and\nwe always appreciate your time and\n\n22\n00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.185\nattention to right to be informed.\n\n23\n00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:01.120\nSo let's continue talking.\n\n24\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.830\nWe're actually doing the first\nof our deeper dive episodes.\n\n25\n00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.563\nWe talked about, if you remember,\nin our overview,\n\n26\n00:01:06.563 --> 00:01:10.840\nwhere we just did in the last episode,\nif you're watching us in sequential order.\n\n27\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.344\nWe did the overview episode for\nall the rights.\n\n28\n00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:16.010\nWe named the rights, you and\nI kind of talked through them.\n\n29\n00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.330\nDescribed at a high level\nwhat each right is.\n\n30\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.530\nTalked about some scenarios where\nwe may find those rights applied.\n\n31\n00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.622\nReasons, and or ways, in which we\nmay have to call them into effect.\n\n32\n00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:26.126\nAnd we said we would come back and\n\n33\n00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:29.155\ndo a little bit of a deeper\ndiscussion around each of the rights.\n\n34\n00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.535\nInform us a little bit more about\nthings we may want to know about.\n\n35\n00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:36.703\nWe'll take a look under the hood and look\ninside the GDPR text and actually look at\n\n36\n00:01:36.703 --> 00:01:40.895\nthe various articles that apply to these\nrights to see where they're declared.\n\n37\n00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:42.700\nJust so you know where to look for them.\n\n38\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.090\nAnd in some cases, have a little\nsupplementary information and/or\n\n39\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.420\ndiscussion about some of these supporting\nelements that have to be dealt with,\n\n40\n00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.480\nas a practitioner or\nfrom a security perspective.\n\n41\n00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.310\nOur controller processor,\ndata protection or\n\n42\n00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.000\ndata privacy officer perspective,\nhow do we deal with those?\n\n43\n00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.292\nSo we're gonna start with\nthe right to be informed.\n\n44\n00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:03.690\nMost said we just walk through the rights,\nas we numbered them presented them.\n\n45\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.810\nSo we'll just follow\nthat same order we had.\n\n46\n00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.640\nWithin the overview.\n\n47\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.020\nRemember we're not prioritizing rights.\n\n48\n00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.930\nNumber one is not any more or\nless important than number eight.\n\n49\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.458\nWe're simply just presenting them in the\nlogical order that they're listed in, and\n\n50\n00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:17.129\ncommonly referred to and talked about.\n\n51\n00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.277\nSo rights of the data subject,\ntransparency and\n\n52\n00:02:20.277 --> 00:02:24.515\nmodalities is where we are,\nWhere we will take a look in the GDPR.\n\n53\n00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:29.401\nWe're in article 12 if you wanna join me\nhere, you can take a look in article 12.\n\n54\n00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:32.800\nLet me just scroll down, so\nyou can see the beginning of that.\n\n55\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.930\nThere we go.\n\n56\n00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.620\nTransparent information communication and\nmodalities for\n\n57\n00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.170\nthe exercise of the rights\nof the data subject.\n\n58\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.220\nThat is a mouthful.\n\n59\n00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.790\nWhat that essentially comes down to\nis the right to be informed, and\n\n60\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.710\nthat's what we're talking about here.\n\n61\n00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.270\nThe controller shall take appropriate\nmeasures to provide any information\n\n62\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.130\nreferred to in articles 13 and 14.\n\n63\n00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.305\nAnd any communications under articles\nfifteen through twenty-two, and\n\n64\n00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:56.015\nthirty-four.\n\n65\n00:02:56.015 --> 00:02:58.290\nArticles that are flowing\nfurther down in the document.\n\n66\n00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.910\nSo go and refer to them.\n\n67\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.250\nRelating the processing to the data\nsubject in a concise, transparent,\n\n68\n00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.555\nintelligible and easily accessible\nform using clear and plain language\n\n69\n00:03:07.555 --> 00:03:10.365\nin particular for any information\naddressed specifically to child.\n\n70\n00:03:10.365 --> 00:03:13.175\nWe've type out the importance\nof focusing on child rights and\n\n71\n00:03:13.175 --> 00:03:14.605\ngathering of child data and\n\n72\n00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:18.445\nopt in, in terms of the age of consent in\nother the areas, please be aware of that.\n\n73\n00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:20.322\nInformation shall be\nprovided in writing or\n\n74\n00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:23.527\nby any other means including more\nappropriate through electronic means.\n\n75\n00:03:23.527 --> 00:03:25.025\nSo we have several modals,\n\n76\n00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:29.205\nwhen requested by the data subject\nthe information may be provided orally.\n\n77\n00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:33.009\nProvided that the identity of\nthe subject is proven by and or\n\n78\n00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.070\nprovided through other means.\n\n79\n00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.725\nIn other words, we have several\nmodalities for communication.\n\n80\n00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:41.190\nSo this gives us the ability to continue\ncommunicating with the customer\n\n81\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.615\nover the phone, the way many\nbusinesses will traditionally do today.\n\n82\n00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:46.613\nYou wanna call up and\ncheck on your account and\n\n83\n00:03:46.613 --> 00:03:50.251\ntalk about your account balance,\nlet's say, hypothetically, with a vendor.\n\n84\n00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:53.981\nYou still have the right under\nthe GDPR to do that as the vendor and\n\n85\n00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:55.165\ntalk to a customer.\n\n86\n00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:58.653\nThe customer, the data subject, has the\nright to expect that you will be able to\n\n87\n00:03:58.653 --> 00:04:02.085\nengage in that conversation if and\nwhen the identity data subject is proven.\n\n88\n00:04:02.085 --> 00:04:03.639\nMeaning just like we do normally.\n\n89\n00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:04.436\n&gt;&gt; Verification.\n\n90\n00:04:04.436 --> 00:04:05.910\n&gt;&gt; Let's verify, validate who you are.\n\n91\n00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.160\nAll right, your security questions.\n\n92\n00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.260\nDo you like pizza?\n\n93\n00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.480\nRight, things like that remember,\nCherokee likes pizza, right?\n\n94\n00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.950\nSo we know that, all right, so if that was\nthe case then, as long as we established\n\n95\n00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.390\nher identity with reasonable assuredness-\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n96\n00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.610\nnow everyone else can establish my\nidentity, because now they know.\n\n97\n00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.582\n&gt;&gt; They do but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n98\n00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:24.698\n&gt;&gt; Remember you publicly outed\nthe fact that you like pizza So\n\n99\n00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:28.840\nyou no longer now can claim that as\na piece of proprietary confidential data.\n\n100\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.892\nAll right,\nnow if you don't really like pizza,\n\n101\n00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:33.106\nthen maybe that's a whole\nseparate conversation.\n\n102\n00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.000\nBut you don't want to be a hater.\n\n103\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.700\n&gt;&gt; No, I'll just keep it a mystery.\n\n104\n00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.746\nKeep them guessing.\n\n105\n00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:40.870\n&gt;&gt; Just be the anti-pizza person,\nbut don't say anything.\n\n106\n00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.230\nAll right, so we do have that.\n\n107\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.200\nSo we want to make sure that we\nunderstand that users, data subjects,\n\n108\n00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.680\ndo have the right to be informed here.\n\n109\n00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.020\nThe information that we supply, right?\n\n110\n00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.480\nWhether it is or shall be determined here,\nwe have to think about the scope of this\n\n111\n00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.050\nbased on whether or not we obtained\nit directly from the individual.\n\n112\n00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.900\nRemember, we set up the individual\nconsents and opts-in.\n\n113\n00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.610\nThen there are additional requirements and\nrights and\n\n114\n00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.250\nresponsibilities that the controller\nprocessor function has to engage.\n\n115\n00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.070\nIn order to safeguard and use that data,\nso want to keep that in mind.\n\n116\n00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.940\nBut concise, transparent,\nintelligible, easily accessible,\n\n117\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.250\nalso free of charge when we go down and\nlook a little bit further down here.\n\n118\n00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.200\nJust scroll down.\n\n119\n00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.550\nYou'll see here.\n\n120\n00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.480\nController shall facilitate access to or\n\n121\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.060\nfacilitate the exercise of that of\nsubject's rights under these articles.\n\n122\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.660\nAnd the case is referred\nto in article 11 12,\n\n123\n00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.290\ncontroller shall not refuse to act on\nthe request of the subject for exercising.\n\n124\n00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.088\nHis or her rights, unless the controller\ndemonstrates that it is not in a position\n\n125\n00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.527\nto identify the data subject.\n\n126\n00:05:39.527 --> 00:05:44.061\nThis is an important one cuz this\nessentially says to us, as the controller.\n\n127\n00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:46.924\nYou've gotta act on these\nrequests unless you can prove,\n\n128\n00:05:46.924 --> 00:05:49.269\nthat you have no knowledge\nof the data subject.\n\n129\n00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:53.452\nIn other words, Cherokee comes and says,\nHey you've got my data, I want out,\n\n130\n00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:54.024\nfix this.\n\n131\n00:05:54.024 --> 00:05:57.092\nAnd we'd go back and say, We've looked,\nwe don't know who you are,\n\n132\n00:05:57.092 --> 00:05:58.249\nwe don't have your data.\n\n133\n00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.268\nWe essentially at that point are done,\nright,\n\n134\n00:06:00.268 --> 00:06:02.547\nas long as we can validate\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n135\n00:06:02.547 --> 00:06:04.170\nThat we don't have her data.\n\n136\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.550\nWe have no knowledge of\nher as a data subject.\n\n137\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.400\nThen we are not necessarily\nrequired to act.\n\n138\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.360\nSo we want to make sure we understand\nboth sides of the divide here.\n\n139\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.533\nAnd we do have to do so with undue\nwithout undue delay in a timely fashion.\n\n140\n00:06:16.533 --> 00:06:19.907\nSo article number three, there says\nbasically as we talked about within\n\n141\n00:06:19.907 --> 00:06:22.464\nthe 30 day period that we\nspoke about specifically.\n\n142\n00:06:22.464 --> 00:06:24.270\nI called it out as being one month.\n\n143\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.320\nThat's the exact language you\ncan see there is used, right?\n\n144\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.040\nSo just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n145\n00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.858\nWe also talked about the fact\nthat we do have to do so.\n\n146\n00:06:33.858 --> 00:06:36.430\nAnd again,\nthey kind of speak about this again,\n\n147\n00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.766\ngoing on down below in\narticle number four.\n\n148\n00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:43.442\nWhere you can lodge a complaint if the\ncontroller-processor does not behave in\n\n149\n00:06:43.442 --> 00:06:47.350\nessentially speed things up and\nget it done with in a month.\n\n150\n00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.000\nYou as the data subject have the right\nto go to a supervisory authority and\n\n151\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.520\nseek a judicial remedy.\n\n152\n00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.350\nI spoke about that.\n\n153\n00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.350\nThat is defined right here.\n\n154\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.630\nAnd we do want to make sure that we\nare understanding as I mentioned just\n\n155\n00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.590\na moment ago.\n\n156\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.948\nThat updates of this information and\nvalidation of this information shall be\n\n157\n00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:07.445\nprovided in sub article, or\nitem five here, free of charge.\n\n158\n00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:12.589\nRight, so again you can't say to a data\nsubject as a controller processor.\n\n159\n00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:17.240\nYeah we'll give you that information,\nbut fork over $50 before we do so.\n\n160\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.846\nNo, right?\n\n161\n00:07:17.846 --> 00:07:22.137\nIf you are holding my information and\nI'm making a request legitimately of you,\n\n162\n00:07:22.137 --> 00:07:24.101\nwhen I call up to check on my balance.\n\n163\n00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:26.780\nYou can't charge me every time I\nwant to check my balance, right?\n\n164\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.830\nYou've got get on the phone or\nprovide a facility for\n\n165\n00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.030\nme to do that provided I meet\nthe stipulations of the agreement.\n\n166\n00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.180\nMeaning I verify my\nidentity as we discussed.\n\n167\n00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.615\nAnd if I do that you have to do that\nin a reasonable and timely fashion,\n\n168\n00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:40.167\nyou can't charge me for that.\n\n169\n00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:44.519\nBut if I call up and\nI say I need the last 12 months worth of\n\n170\n00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:48.342\nstatements printed and\nEL and sent to me via post.\n\n171\n00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:50.281\nSo that I can submit them for XYZ,\n\n172\n00:07:50.281 --> 00:07:53.888\nthen yes the controller processor\nfunction may actually have\n\n173\n00:07:53.888 --> 00:07:58.570\nthe ability to charge a reasonable\nadministrative fee for me to get those.\n\n174\n00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.950\nBut if it's in the normal course\nof communication I understand,\n\n175\n00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:07.370\nit's not an undo as it says they\nwere manifestly unfounded or\n\n176\n00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.640\nexcessive then we actually\nhave to provide that for free.\n\n177\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.870\nSo there are opt outs for\nthe business to essentially cost so\n\n178\n00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.051\nit's gonna be this ridiculous request,\nright?\n\n179\n00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:21.330\nYou're requesting friends its a lot of\ntimes, if you go to a bank and said,\n\n180\n00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.670\nI need copies of my bank statements going\nback three years cuz Im being audited or\n\n181\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.810\nsomething like that.\n\n182\n00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.410\nThe banks probably don't have those\nreadily at hand and available\n\n183\n00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.780\nalthough today a lot of that information's\nelectronic and probably be found.\n\n184\n00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.319\nBut some of that may have to\nbe pulled from long term,\n\n185\n00:08:36.319 --> 00:08:39.574\narchival storage where it's not\nin the mainline system anymore.\n\n186\n00:08:39.574 --> 00:08:43.212\nMaybe they only go back 6 to 12\nmonths in their active system.\n\n187\n00:08:43.212 --> 00:08:45.426\nAnd as a result they have to\nincur an expense to go and\n\n188\n00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:46.920\npull that data out for you.\n\n189\n00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.270\nThe banks love to charge you\na reasonable fee in order to recoup that\n\n190\n00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.870\nexpense to get that done.\n\n191\n00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.460\nReasonable being a relative term, right?\n\n192\n00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:59.380\nBut if it is a normal request within\nthe normal bounds of operations\n\n193\n00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.270\nthat should be done with no fee and\nshould be done in an expedited fashion.\n\n194\n00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.150\nSo we want to make sure that\nunder the right to be informed.\n\n195\n00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.790\nThat we do have an understanding of that.\n\n196\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:12.760\nNow to that end, I have this nifty little\nword document I put together for you.\n\n197\n00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.630\nThe information that we should\nbe supplying to individuals and\n\n198\n00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.440\nat what stage.\n\n199\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.090\nMeaning what information must be supplied\nfrom the controller processor prospective.\n\n200\n00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.460\nIf the data is obtained\ndirectly from a data subject\n\n201\n00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.590\nversus data that was not obtained\ndirectly from a data subject.\n\n202\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.030\nWe may or may not have a need\nto provide certain information.\n\n203\n00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.610\nSo the black checks signifies,\nyes we should provide that.\n\n204\n00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.287\nAnd a blank white space, for instance\nright here, it's more like a grayish,\n\n205\n00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:38.964\nwhich color?\n\n206\n00:09:38.964 --> 00:09:43.455\nLike eggshell, probably a grayish\neggshell space, not really though.\n\n207\n00:09:43.455 --> 00:09:44.507\n&gt;&gt; It's slightly, yeah a different hue.\n\n208\n00:09:44.507 --> 00:09:47.758\n&gt;&gt; Yeah a lack of a black check,\nlet's just say.\n\n209\n00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:51.305\nMeans that we should not feel obligated or\ncompelled to provide that.\n\n210\n00:09:51.305 --> 00:09:53.970\nSo hopefully this chart will\nprove to be beneficial to you.\n\n211\n00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.170\nSo hypothetically, let's just take a look.\n\n212\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.480\nIdentity and contact details of\nthe controller and, where applicable,\n\n213\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.020\nthe controllers representative and\n\n214\n00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.810\nthe data protection officers name and\ninformation.\n\n215\n00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.280\nShould be considered information\nthat should be provided whether or\n\n216\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.862\nnot it got the data directly\nfrom the data subject.\n\n217\n00:10:09.862 --> 00:10:14.119\nBecause that is structural information\naround the management of the data within\n\n218\n00:10:14.119 --> 00:10:15.003\nthe framework.\n\n219\n00:10:15.003 --> 00:10:18.489\nAnd regardless of whether we got it\nthrough a third party or got it directly\n\n220\n00:10:18.489 --> 00:10:21.880\nfrom the subject, that information\nhas to be provided to the subject.\n\n221\n00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.265\nSo that's gonna be provided irrespective\nof origination source of the data.\n\n222\n00:10:26.265 --> 00:10:28.791\nPurpose of processing a lawful basis,\nsame idea,\n\n223\n00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:31.035\nwe've established that talked about that.\n\n224\n00:10:31.035 --> 00:10:32.881\nLegitimate interest of the controller or\n\n225\n00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:36.368\nthird party were applicable should be\nprovided irrespective of data source.\n\n226\n00:10:36.368 --> 00:10:40.672\nBut categorization and category is\na personal data should be provided,\n\n227\n00:10:40.672 --> 00:10:44.916\nbut as you can see not one the data\nsustain direct from the data subject.\n\n228\n00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:47.930\nBut rather one sustain not\ndirectly from the data subject.\n\n229\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.980\nSo here are some differences here\ndepending on what we look at and\n\n230\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.960\nyou can go through and\nobviously walk through this chart.\n\n231\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.570\nMajority of this information\nis provided in both instances.\n\n232\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.850\nBut there are a couple of places\nwhere we see that not being provided.\n\n233\n00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:05.400\nSource the personal data originates from\nwhether it came from public, excuse me,\n\n234\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.720\npublic accessible sources,\nis not pertinent.\n\n235\n00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.840\nIt would not be an appropriate thing to\nprovide when you get the data directly\n\n236\n00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.145\nfrom the data subject.\n\n237\n00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:16.490\nCuz where you got it from and, so do\nthey because they gave it to you, right.\n\n238\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.320\nBut if it's coming from\nan external third party source,\n\n239\n00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.230\nthen clearly we need to disclose and\nprovide that.\n\n240\n00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.815\nWhether the provision personal data\nis part of the statutory contractual\n\n241\n00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:27.274\nrequirement or obligation.\n\n242\n00:11:27.274 --> 00:11:29.909\nAnd possibly the consequence\nof failing to provide that.\n\n243\n00:11:29.909 --> 00:11:33.390\nWhen you get the data directly from\nthe subject, you should disclose that.\n\n244\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.830\nWhen it comes from other sources,\nyou don't have to disclose that.\n\n245\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.810\nSo again,\nthere are some small variations here.\n\n246\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.610\nBut it would be helpful for\nyou to walk through this kind of a list.\n\n247\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.861\nAnd get a sense of this, so that as we\ntalk about the right to be informed we\n\n248\n00:11:46.861 --> 00:11:50.719\nas processors, as controllers,\nas data protection officers.\n\n249\n00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:52.413\nIn these various oversight and\n\n250\n00:11:52.413 --> 00:11:55.968\nmanagement roles on the opposite\nside of the data subject.\n\n251\n00:11:55.968 --> 00:12:00.180\nWhere we are gathering data, managing it,\nand ultimately have the responsibility and\n\n252\n00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.850\nthe liability of doing so.\n\n253\n00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.003\nWe have to be well-informed about\nthe requirements around how we\n\n254\n00:12:05.003 --> 00:12:06.620\ninteract with the data subject.\n\n255\n00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.396\nWhat rights the data\nsubject will exercise, and\n\n256\n00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:12.447\nunder what conditions those\nrights can be called in.\n\n257\n00:12:12.447 --> 00:12:14.637\nAnd as a result, what are proper and\n\n258\n00:12:14.637 --> 00:12:18.510\nappropriate responses within\nthe framework of that, right?\n\n259\n00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.070\nSo it's okay to say no to a data\nsubject on certain things, but\n\n260\n00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.900\nonly if it's a clearly\nclassified exception.\n\n261\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.080\nOtherwise you more often than not have\na responsibility as a controller or\n\n262\n00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.915\nprocessor to provide that information.\n\n263\n00:12:31.915 --> 00:12:35.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay Adam, and you're going to put\nthis in with the notes, or at least\n\n264\n00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.370\ngive it to me, so I can, so we can look\nat this at a later time for reference?\n\n265\n00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.170\nPlease.\n[LAUGH]\n\n266\n00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:43.980\nYay!\n\n267\n00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.610\n&gt;&gt; As always, absolutely.\n\n268\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.820\nWe have that document made available and\nhopefully you'll take advantage of it.\n\n269\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.564\nDownload it, obviously use it\nas a handy reference guide.\n\n270\n00:12:51.564 --> 00:12:54.862\nAnd it can certainly be valuable for\nyou as you build,\n\n271\n00:12:54.862 --> 00:12:57.511\nwhat I would call a checklist or\na toolkit.\n\n272\n00:12:57.511 --> 00:13:01.076\nAround how you're going to implement and\nlook at other various areas around these\n\n273\n00:13:01.076 --> 00:13:03.828\nrights and understand what\nthe responsibility matrix maybe.\n\n274\n00:13:03.828 --> 00:13:05.680\nSo, absolutely, we'll make sure\nwe make this part of the show.\n\n275\n00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.470\nThat's no problem at all.\n\n276\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.110\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, very good.\n\n277\n00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:08.622\n&gt;&gt; All right!\n\n278\n00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:11.641\n&gt;&gt; Any questions about anything here?\n\n279\n00:13:11.641 --> 00:13:14.298\n&gt;&gt; Maybe about the automation, but yeah.\n\n280\n00:13:14.298 --> 00:13:16.641\n&gt;&gt; That would be right number eight so\nwe're gonna get there.\n\n281\n00:13:16.641 --> 00:13:17.633\nWe haven't got there yet.\n\n282\n00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:19.347\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go in sequential over, so\n\n283\n00:13:19.347 --> 00:13:20.492\ndefinitely we'll see that one.\n\n284\n00:13:20.492 --> 00:13:23.400\nBut if it's for that I'd rather\ndeal with questions specific.\n\n285\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.033\n&gt;&gt; This one's separate?\n\n286\n00:13:24.033 --> 00:13:26.552\n&gt;&gt; It's just some kind of keep them\nthematic and just kind of within\n\n287\n00:13:26.552 --> 00:13:29.547\nthe conversation, just so everybody's\nclear with what we're talking about here.\n\n288\n00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:30.173\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n289\n00:13:30.173 --> 00:13:32.639\n&gt;&gt; But anything specific to\nthe right to be informed?\n\n290\n00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:34.976\n&gt;&gt; Am I allowed to have a question here?\n\n291\n00:13:34.976 --> 00:13:37.311\nAm I allowed to make an informed question?\n\n292\n00:13:37.311 --> 00:13:39.170\n&gt;&gt; Of course, absolutely.\n\n293\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.700\nAs long as you have one.\n\n294\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.350\n&gt;&gt; I don't.\n\n295\n00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.440\nBut at least, thank you for\ngiving me that option.\n\n296\n00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.395\nI appreciate that.\n\n297\n00:13:44.395 --> 00:13:45.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're very welcome.\n\n298\n00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:46.860\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for joining us.\n\n299\n00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.580\nBut we're going to continue to look\nat our additional rights here in\n\n300\n00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.570\nthe subsequent shows.\n\n301\n00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.210\nYou don't want to miss that for\nthis show, we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n302\n00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.830\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n303\n00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:56.970\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n304\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.170\nRight to access, just so\nthat everybody knows.\n\n305\n00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.750\nRight of access rather, I'm sorry.\n\n306\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.390\nComing up next, so\n\n307\n00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.200\nthat way if you're watching this you\njust have a sense of where we go next.\n\n308\n00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.950\nThe right of access will be our next,\nright?\n\n309\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:06.830\nNumber two on the list.\n\n310\n00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:07.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, cool.\n\n311\n00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.553\nThank you.\n\n312\n00:14:12.600 -->

00:00:11.959\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.060\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your GDPR's theories.\n\n5\n00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.520\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.880\nIn this episode we'll be taking\na look at the right of access.\n\n7\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.420\nAnd with us today back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.710\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.560\n&gt;&gt; Hello everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.960\nHopefully you're all doing well.\n\n11\n00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.500\nAlways good to be back spending time\nwith Cherokee and with all of you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.370\nWe are discussing our\nrights under the GDPR.\n\n13\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.513\nWe have many of them as we've talked\nabout in our overview episode.\n\n14\n00:00:37.513 --> 00:00:41.408\nIf you're just joining us jumping in right\nhere, we're actually on right number two.\n\n15\n00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:44.543\nWe're going in sequential order\nbased on how we listed them and\n\n16\n00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:48.863\ndiscussed them within the overview episode\nof where we talk about individual rights,\n\n17\n00:00:48.863 --> 00:00:51.320\nkind of went through them top to bottom.\n\n18\n00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.160\nWe just finished talking about in our\nprior episode, the right to be informed.\n\n19\n00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.810\nAnd now that we are suitably informed,\nwe're gonna talk about the right of access\n\n20\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.730\nspecifically, actually more formally,\nthe right of access by the data subject.\n\n21\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.031\nThat's the actual full name to the right\ngranted to us under Article 15.\n\n22\n00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:11.523\nIf you wanna join me here,\ntake a quick look.\n\n23\n00:01:11.523 --> 00:01:13.560\nYou can see it right\nthere in the document.\n\n24\n00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.680\nThe purpose of the right of\naccess under the GDPR is listed\n\n25\n00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.596\nin statement number one.\n\n26\n00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:23.000\nThe data subject shall have the right\nto obtain from the controller\n\n27\n00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.510\nconfirmation as to whether or\nnot personal data concerning him or\n\n28\n00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.195\nher are being processed,\nand what that is the case.\n\n29\n00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:34.820\nAnd excuse me, where that is the case,\naccess to personal data and\n\n30\n00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.620\nthe following information, things like\npurpose of the processing, categories of\n\n31\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.600\npersonal data concern, recipients of,\ncategories to whom are recipients.\n\n32\n00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.530\nLet me try that again.\n\n33\n00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.550\nThe recipients or categories of recipient,\n\n34\n00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.740\nit's tough when you have to say that word\ntwice in a row, really quickly like that.\n\n35\n00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.280\nTo whom the personal data\nmay have been disclosed.\n\n36\n00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.210\nIn particular, if those recipients\nare in third countries,\n\n37\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.670\nor in international organizations,\nand on, and on, and on down the list.\n\n38\n00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.200\nSo in other words, we essentially\nare focused specifically here\n\n39\n00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.180\non right of access by the data\nsubject to ensure validity and\n\n40\n00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.430\nvalidation and properness of processing.\n\n41\n00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.330\nAnd specifically lawfulness of\nthe processing, which is the actual term,\n\n42\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.850\nthe language we've used from the GDPR.\n\n43\n00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.910\nThat is what we are being granted\nthe right of access by the data subject to\n\n44\n00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.625\nensure, that are data is being correctly\nprocessed, lawfully processed,\n\n45\n00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:28.390\naccurately managed, and is appropriate.\n\n46\n00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.550\nCan we charge as the processer,\nas the controller, a fee for\n\n47\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.430\ndealing with subject access requests?\n\n48\n00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.290\nWe've talked about this before as well,\nif you remember.\n\n49\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.370\nWe can and\nindeed do have have a responsibility,\n\n50\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.830\nwe pointed out in the last episode, as the\nprocess of controller to provide access to\n\n51\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.320\nthat data free of charge as long as\nit's not an unreasonable request,\n\n52\n00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.990\nright from the data access or\nfrom the data subject rather.\n\n53\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.920\nThe data subject says, hey I need five\nyears worth of business records printed,\n\n54\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.145\ncollated, sorted alphabetized,\nput into varies baskets and\n\n55\n00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:03.500\nthen sent to me via messenger.\n\n56\n00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.500\nThen we can say you know we\nare going to have to charge you for\n\n57\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.610\nthat right because that's what we\nwould classify as an unreasonable or\n\n58\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.500\nundue request under the law, or\nunder the language in the GDPR.\n\n59\n00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.540\nBut if it is just a normal request, we\nactually are supposed to do that for free.\n\n60\n00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've even seen that\nbefore like with public records,\n\n61\n00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.580\nfor police records or county records.\n\n62\n00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.980\nIf you ask, I think, it's at least in\nwhat I've seen, it's if you ask for\n\n63\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.920\nmore than about an hour's worth of\nwork they'll charge you on a per page\n\n64\n00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.340\nbasis kind of thing.\n\n65\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.870\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou have different ways of doing that.\n\n66\n00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We also can charge if the request is\n\n67\n00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.930\nrepetitive, meaning if I come back\nevery month like clockwork and\n\n68\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.650\nmake the same request, we can being to\nsay, hey, guess what, third, fourth,\n\n69\n00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.450\nfifth time in,\nwe're gonna start charging you for that.\n\n70\n00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.460\nWe have the flexibility as the controller\nprocessor to decide to do that.\n\n71\n00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.160\nWe don't have to do that by the way, but\n\n72\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.600\nwe have the option to\ndo that if we want to.\n\n73\n00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.370\nSo we do have to keep in mind that\nthe fee, as I said, must be reasonable.\n\n74\n00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.723\nIt can cover the administrative cost\nincurred with complying with your request,\n\n75\n00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:06.260\nbut it cannot be exorbitant.\n\n76\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.370\nWe can't charge $1,000 to go\nphotocopy one piece of paper.\n\n77\n00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.375\nThat is just not acceptable.\n\n78\n00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:15.590\nBut we could charge more than $0.10 to\ncover the cost of somebody having to go\n\n79\n00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.480\ntake their time out to go make that copy.\n\n80\n00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.880\nBut it has to be a reasonable fee,\nwhatever that may be.\n\n81\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.690\nWe talked about the fact that we do have\na timeline associated with compliance.\n\n82\n00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.850\nWe said we have to comply in a speedy,\ntimely, appropriate fashion.\n\n83\n00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.820\nSo just keep in mind that if the subject\nrequest, subject access request\n\n84\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.653\nunder the GDPR is gonna have to be dealt\nwith because of information that was\n\n85\n00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:42.700\nopted in that was consented to, and that\nyou've gathered directly from the subject,\n\n86\n00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.320\nwe have that one month that we've talked\nabout timeline that we have to apply and\n\n87\n00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.140\ndeal with this remediation within.\n\n88\n00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.110\nSo we have to respond within\na reasonable amount of time.\n\n89\n00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.210\nI think 30 days or 31 days,\nwhatever you classify a month as.\n\n90\n00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.580\nBut within one month is a reasonable\namount of time in most cases.\n\n91\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.850\nSo that's not unreasonable.\n\n92\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.760\nBut we said if there\nare extenuating circumstances,\n\n93\n00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.800\nas we've pointed out in other discussions,\nperhaps it's an excessive request.\n\n94\n00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.640\nPerhaps it's a complex request.\n\n95\n00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.180\nPerhaps, for\n\n96\n00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.650\nwhatever reason we have to go to long-term\narchival storage to retrieve data.\n\n97\n00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.380\nAnd maybe that requires\na whole process that will take\n\n98\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.240\nlonger than the 30 days\nto get the job done.\n\n99\n00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.840\nWe do have the ability as the controller\nprocessor to request an extension out for\n\n100\n00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.280\nan additional two months.\n\n101\n00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.148\nWe must explain why both to the data\nsubject and inform them of that.\n\n102\n00:05:29.148 --> 00:05:32.390\nThat has to happen within the 30 day,\ninitial 30 day window.\n\n103\n00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.300\nAnd we may have to explain that to\na supervisory agency to inform them\n\n104\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.399\nof the fact that we are seeking\nthis additional time.\n\n105\n00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:42.610\nAnd we are not responding within\nthe specified 30 day time window.\n\n106\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.560\nSo we do have to be aware\nof those things and\n\n107\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.100\njust make sure we're aware of\nthe reasons why we have to do that.\n\n108\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.990\nIf the request is what we call\nmanifestly unfounded or excessive,\n\n109\n00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.789\nthat is the language that is actually\nused, manifestly unfounded or excessive.\n\n110\n00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.610\n&gt;&gt; Can you break that for me, Adam?\n\n111\n00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.300\n&gt;&gt; Can I break down manifestly,\nunfounded, or excessive?\n\n112\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.412\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well, so\n\n113\n00:06:02.412 --> 00:06:07.110\nexcessive means that it is\nconsidered to be an unusual and\n\n114\n00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.480\na burdensome request, much like\nyou asking me to break this down,\n\n115\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.945\nwould traditionally fall\ninto the category of being.\n\n116\n00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:16.290\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Manifestly, though, I mean like-\n\n117\n00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.509\n&gt;&gt; Just merely pointing out, right?\n\n118\n00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.494\n&gt;&gt; Manifest, lots of information.\n\n119\n00:06:19.494 --> 00:06:24.226\n&gt;&gt; Probably a little bit harder to\nfigure out, right, manifestly unfounded.\n\n120\n00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:27.217\nSo I come to you as the controller\nprocessor hypothetically,\n\n121\n00:06:27.217 --> 00:06:29.140\nlet's just say in our exchange.\n\n122\n00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.790\nYou're the controller processor function.\n\n123\n00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.090\nSo you've gathered data.\n\n124\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.530\nYou're managing it on behalf of the\norganization, right, under whatever terms.\n\n125\n00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.410\nI'm the data subject.\n\n126\n00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.290\nJust so everybody knows which side\nof the divide we're talking about.\n\n127\n00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.050\nAs the data subject, I come to you and\nmake a request, right,\n\n128\n00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.430\nto access data, but not just my data, but\n\n129\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.650\nperhaps data on an entire range of\nindividuals over a very large timeline.\n\n130\n00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.258\nThat may be manifestly unfounded or\nexcessive, number one because I may not\n\n131\n00:06:57.258 --> 00:07:01.513\nhave the right to claim that I can\nsee their data, number one, right.\n\n132\n00:07:01.513 --> 00:07:04.457\nSo as an individual I have\nthe rights to my own data, but\n\n133\n00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:07.010\nI may not have the rights to their data.\n\n134\n00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.805\nSecond of all, it may be excessive,\nbecause maybe hypothetically,\n\n135\n00:07:11.805 --> 00:07:14.094\nlets say its a family situation.\n\n136\n00:07:14.094 --> 00:07:16.961\nLet's just say as the data subject,\n\n137\n00:07:16.961 --> 00:07:21.690\nperhaps I am asking about\ninformation regarding my family.\n\n138\n00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.000\nSo maybe there's four or five members\nof the family including myself and\n\n139\n00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.130\nI want information about all\nof the members of the family.\n\n140\n00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.000\nThat may or may not be excessive.\n\n141\n00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.110\nIt may or may not be manifestly unfounded.\n\n142\n00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.460\nIt depends on the terms of\nthe information that was gathered, and\n\n143\n00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.810\nhow it was gathered.\n\n144\n00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.485\nBecause if I'm the designated member\nof the family that has rights to\n\n145\n00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:44.225\nunderstand and manage all that,\nthen I may have rights to it.\n\n146\n00:07:44.225 --> 00:07:48.695\nBut if each data record, each data\nsubject is seen as being individual,\n\n147\n00:07:48.695 --> 00:07:49.995\nthen I don't have rights to it.\n\n148\n00:07:49.995 --> 00:07:54.235\nIt's manifestly unfounded because I\ndon't have permission to make a request.\n\n149\n00:07:54.235 --> 00:07:56.848\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and also like with that example-\n&gt;&gt; We're standing,\n\n150\n00:07:56.848 --> 00:07:58.269\nanother terminology that people say.\n\n151\n00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.898\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that example that I\ngave about the public records,\n\n152\n00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:06.059\nI know that there are exceptions\nlike you're referencing there.\n\n153\n00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:08.989\nManifestly, yeah,\nyou know the verbiage, here.\n\n154\n00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:12.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Manifestly unfounded or excessive.\n\n155\n00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.740\n&gt;&gt; So here for instance,\nvictims' rights in the United States.\n\n156\n00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.910\nSo if I wanted to obtain information\nabout my family members, but\n\n157\n00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.680\nmaybe I was the person causing\nharm to an individual.\n\n158\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.174\nOne of my family members the night\nwould be excluded from obtaining those\n\n159\n00:08:30.174 --> 00:08:32.542\nrecords for that specific incident.\n\n160\n00:08:32.542 --> 00:08:35.164\n&gt;&gt; They could be, you could,\nsay, for instance, hey,\n\n161\n00:08:35.164 --> 00:08:38.043\nI don't want to\n&gt;&gt; You'll give them access for\n\n162\n00:08:38.043 --> 00:08:38.840\nwhatever reason.\n\n163\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.168\nMaybe there's a child custody case,\nmaybe there's been a divorce.\n\n164\n00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:48.340\nMaybe there is all sorts of\npotential things that could go on,\n\n165\n00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.865\nscenarios and things you could think of.\n\n166\n00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:55.255\nAs a result, you may now no longer have\nrights, let's say, hypothetically,\n\n167\n00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:58.365\nto the certain information about certain\nindividuals where before maybe you did.\n\n168\n00:08:58.365 --> 00:08:59.835\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe a child has now become\n\n169\n00:08:59.835 --> 00:09:01.945\na major, where before they were a minor.\n\n170\n00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:04.555\nAnd as a minor, you were their custodian,\nessentially their guardian,\n\n171\n00:09:04.555 --> 00:09:08.395\nyou had rights to all information\nabout them, and to oversee that.\n\n172\n00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:11.610\nBut when they become a major,\nwhenever that age of consent,\n\n173\n00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.370\nage of majority is by law in\nthe geography, rights and\n\n174\n00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:21.590\npermission to control over that data\nreverts to them as opposed to now you on\n\n175\n00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.560\ntheir behalf, and you may no longer have\nthe ability, right, to go in, necessarily.\n\n176\n00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.950\nAnd say I wanna see Jane Doe,\nmy daughter's information because now,\n\n177\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.608\nJane Doe, your daughter is a majority or\nof a majority age,\n\n178\n00:09:33.608 --> 00:09:35.458\nshe's considered an adult.\n\n179\n00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:38.290\nAnd she has rights as\na data subject of her own.\n\n180\n00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.460\nAnd you no longer have\nthe ability to do that.\n\n181\n00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.838\nSo there are many situations, right,\nscenarios where that could happen.\n\n182\n00:09:43.838 --> 00:09:45.067\nAnd it could be excessive or\n\n183\n00:09:45.067 --> 00:09:49.020\nmanifestly unfounded because you no longer\nhave standing or permission to do so.\n\n184\n00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.700\nIt's just fun to say, sympathy.\n\n185\n00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.722\nManifestly unfounded.\n\n186\n00:09:51.722 --> 00:09:52.744\n&gt;&gt; Manifestly unfounded,\non the count of three.\n\n187\n00:09:52.744 --> 00:09:53.376\n&gt;&gt; Or excessive.\n\n188\n00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:54.446\n&gt;&gt; On the count of three.\n\n189\n00:09:54.446 --> 00:09:55.510\n&gt;&gt; Or excessive, okay.\n\n190\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.850\nOne, two, three.\n\n191\n00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:57.455\nManifest.\n\n192\n00:09:57.455 --> 00:10:00.205\n[LAUGH] You didn't say it!\n\n193\n00:10:00.205 --> 00:10:02.320\n&gt;&gt; I was, just in here.\n\n194\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.333\nI wasn't saying it out here.\n\n195\n00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:04.960\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; I wanted to hear you say it, right?\n\n196\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.657\nYou want me to say it with you?\n\n197\n00:10:05.657 --> 00:10:06.227\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n198\n00:10:06.227 --> 00:10:07.794\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you're ready?\n\n199\n00:10:07.794 --> 00:10:09.004\n&gt;&gt; I don't trust you now.\n\n200\n00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:10.347\n&gt;&gt; Come, come on,\ncome on I promise I will.\n\n201\n00:10:10.347 --> 00:10:12.012\n&gt;&gt; One, two- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, come on,\n\n202\n00:10:12.012 --> 00:10:12.628\nI'll pinky promise.\n\n203\n00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:15.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right ready one, two, three ready?\n\n204\n00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.440\n&gt;&gt; Manifestly unfounded or excessive.\n\n205\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.975\n&gt;&gt; See, see, it works out well.\n\n206\n00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:22.745\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we have all that.\n\n207\n00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:23.767\nNow, remember,\n\n208\n00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:27.932\nwe also have the ability as a controller\nprocessor to refuse to respond.\n\n209\n00:10:27.932 --> 00:10:29.010\nWe've talked about this.\n\n210\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.950\nMaybe because of the manifestly\nunfounded or excessive\n\n211\n00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.130\nthought process we just went through,\nwe're going to say, you know what, hey.\n\n212\n00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.890\nI can't give you that information.\n\n213\n00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.710\nAs the processor/controller,\nI'm saying no, essentially.\n\n214\n00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.780\nI'm opting out and\nsaying I cannot do that.\n\n215\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.250\nWe have the ability to refuse\nto respond to a request,\n\n216\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.350\nit's not that we must honor every request.\n\n217\n00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.810\nWe have to do our best in order\nto do some timely fashion,\n\n218\n00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.430\nif the request is legitimate.\n\n219\n00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.396\nAnd can be legitimately served.\n\n220\n00:10:53.396 --> 00:10:54.390\nBut if there are mitigating or\n\n221\n00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.070\nextenuating circumstances that we just\nestablished, we have the right and\n\n222\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.580\nindeed the responsibility to say no\nas a controller of the processes.\n\n223\n00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.400\nSo if we do that, we must and\n\n224\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.380\nwe do indeed owe the data subject\nan explanation either way.\n\n225\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:11.000\nWe can't just, in other words, say no and\nnot give you an explanation as to why.\n\n226\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.782\nSo when we say no,\n\n227\n00:11:11.782 --> 00:11:15.470\nwe do have to inform the data\nsubject we're refusing the request.\n\n228\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.620\nHere is why.\n\n229\n00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.920\nThat subject may not like that answer,\nmay not like that explanation, but\n\n230\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.720\nwe do have the requirement and\nobligation to do so\n\n231\n00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.940\ninforming them of their rights in\naddition to complain and lodge a form.\n\n232\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.776\nTo complain and to lodge a formal\ncomplaint with a supervisory agency,\n\n233\n00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:38.704\nessentially an external third party\nthat oversees this whole process.\n\n234\n00:11:38.704 --> 00:11:42.470\nAnd as a result we have to inform them\nthat they may not like the outcome.\n\n235\n00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.430\nIf they don't, here is where they\ncan go to lodge a complaint and\n\n236\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.180\nas a result of that perhaps seek\na judicial remedy which is language I also\n\n237\n00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.810\npointed out in other areas of the GDPR.\n\n238\n00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.460\nSo we do wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that and\n\n239\n00:11:54.460 --> 00:12:00.290\njust have that in our minds that\nas the controller processor,\n\n240\n00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:04.980\nwe do have a responsibility to\nsay no when it is an unfounded\n\n241\n00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.990\nrequest that we cannot honor because\nof other stipulations or constraints.\n\n242\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.360\nAnd we should not feel\nuncomfortable doing so,\n\n243\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.980\nprovided we legitimately\nfeel that we should say no.\n\n244\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.210\nBut we owe the data\nsubject an explanation and\n\n245\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.210\nwe owe them the right to then\nunderstand that they can go and\n\n246\n00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.528\nessentially appeal that no from\nus to a supervisory agency.\n\n247\n00:12:23.528 --> 00:12:26.820\nIf the supervisory agency comes back and\nsays, okay,\n\n248\n00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.690\nby the way,\nwe've been through this whole thing.\n\n249\n00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.670\nWe actually think you need to respond.\n\n250\n00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.190\nWe then may be compelled\nto give them information.\n\n251\n00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.980\nBut they also could come back and say, Mr.\ndata subject, Ms. data subject,\n\n252\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:42.780\nwe're sorry, but we've looked at all this,\nand controller processor function was\n\n253\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.680\nactually legitimately correct in saying\nthat they cannot honor this request.\n\n254\n00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.770\nSo, it could go either way.\n\n255\n00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.580\nBut, it's an impartial third party\nthat will give you a judicial remedy,\n\n256\n00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.760\nessentially a voice that you can go to and\n\n257\n00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.080\nsee if you can actually claim that\nperhaps this was an incorrect assumption.\n\n258\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.371\nAnd, you may want this to be reevaluated,\nand so as a result, you can go through\n\n259\n00:13:00.371 --> 00:13:03.488\nthat process, if you would like, so\njust make sure you're aware of that.\n\n260\n00:13:03.488 --> 00:13:07.225\nBut we do have to make sure that we\nthink about the logic of these things.\n\n261\n00:13:07.225 --> 00:13:10.005\nWe do have to understand that\nthere are mechanisms involved,\n\n262\n00:13:10.005 --> 00:13:11.120\nas we pointed out here.\n\n263\n00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.620\nWanna make sure we follow them.\n\n264\n00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.610\nRemember, keeping in mind that\ncommonly most of this is done\n\n265\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.430\nelectronically, right.\n\n266\n00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.700\nWe talk about the use of electronic\ndata formats that are standardized.\n\n267\n00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.720\nWe called out and made sure we\nwent through in a prior episode\n\n268\n00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.710\nthe fact that communication between data\nsubject controller and processor for\n\n269\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.660\ninformation requests like\nthis can be done orally.\n\n270\n00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.881\nWe talked about that, although commonly,\nit is usually done electronically.\n\n271\n00:13:32.881 --> 00:13:35.090\nAnd so we just wanna make\nsure we are aware of that.\n\n272\n00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:40.610\nBut we do recommend that there\nis secure thought process or\n\n273\n00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.770\nthe idea of architecture in\nsecuring is brought to bear here,\n\n274\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.760\nin confidentiality and availability\nhave to coexist along with integrity.\n\n275\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.920\nAnd the GDPR goes out of its way to call\nout, in an addendum called Recital 63,\n\n276\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.620\nat the bottom of the document\nthe fact that this level should be.\n\n277\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.710\nWe're not there,\nI'm just calling it out that it is there.\n\n278\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.465\nI haven't gone down to it.\n\n279\n00:13:59.465 --> 00:14:02.410\nI'm not gonna scroll down and show it\nyou now, but you'll be able to find it.\n\n280\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:07.390\nJust search for, in the find feature that\nI've been using to move between articles,\n\n281\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.921\nsearch for Recital 63.\n\n282\n00:14:08.921 --> 00:14:10.659\nIt is just the number of the recital or\n\n283\n00:14:10.659 --> 00:14:13.925\nthe additional addendum at the Bottom\nof the document you will find.\n\n284\n00:14:13.925 --> 00:14:18.525\nThat we call out that we should have\nautomated available self-service-like\n\n285\n00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:21.451\ninterfaces for\nusers to make these requests, but\n\n286\n00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:24.610\nthey must be remotely accessible and\nsecure.\n\n287\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.994\nSo we're thinking about things like maybe\nwebsites that can be accessed securely,\n\n288\n00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:32.700\nmaybe some dual factor kind of\nauthentication, security questions,\n\n289\n00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.953\nthings of that nature.\n\n290\n00:14:33.953 --> 00:14:37.460\nThat would then be implemented to\nallow you to make these requests and\n\n291\n00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.450\nperhaps even get back in\nan automated secure fashion.\n\n292\n00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.860\nThe output, maybe it comes back\nas a PDF or a Word file or\n\n293\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.630\nwhatever it may be when\nyou make the request.\n\n294\n00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.012\nBut a lot of this can be done\nthrough self-service and\n\n295\n00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:49.970\nautomated today using this technology.\n\n296\n00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.140\nAnd so, we call out the fact that\nwe should be able to provide\n\n297\n00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.290\nremote access in a secure\nfashion in order to drive this.\n\n298\n00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.440\nAnd so, again,\nwe're not being prescriptive and\n\n299\n00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.010\nsaying it must be done using this\ntechnology on this platform, this way.\n\n300\n00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.320\nBut rather, broadly saying we should\nenable the broadest possible level of\n\n301\n00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.920\naccess, but do so securely and remote\naccess through things like secure web\n\n302\n00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.810\ninterfaces would be an acceptable way\nas one example of perhaps doing that.\n\n303\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.330\nThat's me offering you an explanation\nas to how it could be done\n\n304\n00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.240\nnot say it's definitively gotta be\ndone this way, just to be clear.\n\n305\n00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.510\nClear.\n\n306\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:23.890\nJust make sure you're aware of that.\n\n307\n00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.810\nAlso, keep in mind that\nyou do have the ability to\n\n308\n00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.600\nbe able to request this information.\n\n309\n00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.170\nBut, not to do so and\nexpect to get it when it\n\n310\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.880\nwill negatively impact the freedom\nof the rights of others.\n\n311\n00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.723\nIn other words, as a data subject I can\nmake demands on the controller processor\n\n312\n00:15:38.723 --> 00:15:40.252\nfunction to see my data.\n\n313\n00:15:40.252 --> 00:15:44.326\nBut only to the extent and to the point\nthat it does not impact other's rights,\n\n314\n00:15:44.326 --> 00:15:47.450\nfreedoms and\ncapabilities within the system as well.\n\n315\n00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:48.971\nSo if I make an excessive or\n\n316\n00:15:48.971 --> 00:15:53.399\nunduly founded request that would\nimpact negatively the rights of others,\n\n317\n00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:57.498\nthe controller processor has the ability\nand the right to say no to me.\n\n318\n00:15:57.498 --> 00:15:58.592\nAs we've talked about,\n\n319\n00:15:58.592 --> 00:16:02.403\nbecause that may negatively impact other\npeople's ability to exercise their right.\n\n320\n00:16:02.403 --> 00:16:07.522\nIf I say I need every record On every\nperson in my family, going back 45,\n\n321\n00:16:07.522 --> 00:16:13.700\n50, 100 years or something crazy like\nthat, of a government entity, right.\n\n322\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.730\nThat maybe unduly excessive.\n\n323\n00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.067\nIt may not be an acceptable request\nto make because it may suck up so\n\n324\n00:16:19.067 --> 00:16:22.832\nmany resources, that other people may\nnot be able to make their request in\n\n325\n00:16:22.832 --> 00:16:24.310\nthe system at the same time.\n\n326\n00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.832\nAnd so the controller processor function\nhas the right to essentially say\n\n327\n00:16:27.832 --> 00:16:28.890\nno to that.\n\n328\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:33.600\nI may then, remember, go out and seek a\nsupervisory, advisory opinion about that,\n\n329\n00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.880\nbut I may be told, hey guess what?\n\n330\n00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.030\nThat is excessive.\n\n331\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.530\nUnless you're willing to\nspend this amount of money\n\n332\n00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.500\nto essentially get a dedicated\nresource to do this for you.\n\n333\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.012\nWe're not entertaining the idea.\n\n334\n00:16:43.012 --> 00:16:45.160\nAnd that may or may not be the outcome,\nit's hard to say.\n\n335\n00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.820\nBut it's very likely that that\nrequest would be turned down\n\n336\n00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.820\nmore often than not, yes?\n\n337\n00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can see how\nimportant that those terms are,\n\n338\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.190\nthe manifestly unfounded or excessive.\n\n339\n00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.830\nBecause I see here in your notes,\nthere's no limitation or\n\n340\n00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.240\ncap on the amount of data.\n\n341\n00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:04.550\nBut if it does exceed,\nif it's conflicting, that other clause\n\n342\n00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:10.102\nthe manifestly unfounded or excessive,\nthen that's the limitation, that hard.\n\n343\n00:17:10.102 --> 00:17:13.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, it do actually,\nit's a soft limitation-\n\n344\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.015\n&gt;&gt; Okay, a soft limitation.\n\n345\n00:17:14.015 --> 00:17:16.416\n&gt;&gt; Since we haven't defined,\nmanifestly unfounded or\n\n346\n00:17:16.416 --> 00:17:18.514\nexcessive equals this amount,-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n347\n00:17:18.514 --> 00:17:22.099\n&gt;&gt; But we are saying that we get to\na point where we're starting to consider\n\n348\n00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:25.326\nthat you may make requests that are so\ndifficult to comply with,\n\n349\n00:17:25.326 --> 00:17:27.540\nthat we're not gonna be able to comply.\n\n350\n00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.750\nRight, and that's what that clause, again,\nthat soft clause that's really extensible.\n\n351\n00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:37.600\nAnd is defined at a broad, high level,\nbut is not narrowly tailored in scope to\n\n352\n00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.770\nreally box us in a very\nnarrowly defined circumstances.\n\n353\n00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:46.010\nCan then be applied, interpreted according\nto perhaps different requirements and\n\n354\n00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:47.440\ndifferent specifications.\n\n355\n00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.262\nBased on maybe time of year,\nbusiness cycle,\n\n356\n00:17:49.262 --> 00:17:50.997\nthere's always things you could think of.\n\n357\n00:17:50.997 --> 00:17:51.521\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes sense.\n\n358\n00:17:51.521 --> 00:17:55.261\n&gt;&gt; With certain times of the year, would\nbe unrealistic if people are on vacation,\n\n359\n00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:57.296\nmaybe holiday seasons, things like that,\n\n360\n00:17:57.296 --> 00:18:00.490\nwill be hard to make a request that\nrequires a lot of additional work.\n\n361\n00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.520\nAnd maybe during normal business time,\nmaybe it's not such a big deal, right.\n\n362\n00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.866\nSo, there's all these things that would\nkind of tip us into that category so\n\n363\n00:18:06.866 --> 00:18:09.322\nwe do have to think about that and\njust be aware of that and\n\n364\n00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:12.916\nunderstand that that is something that\nyou may or may not play into this, right.\n\n365\n00:18:12.916 --> 00:18:17.101\nAnd we have to be just in our minds\nthinking about that because we can\n\n366\n00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:18.860\nactually be an issue.\n\n367\n00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.940\nNow, we have been talking about\nArticle 15 as I pointed out,\n\n368\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.960\nyou're gonna give me just one sec while I\nscroll back up, but I am scrolling back up\n\n369\n00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.810\nto Article 12 I just want to\npoint something out to you here.\n\n370\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.150\nSo let me just get to\nArticle 12 real quick.\n\n371\n00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:31.970\nAnd if you remember,\n\n372\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.660\nlet's take a look just to remind you of\nthis as we wrap up this conversation.\n\n373\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.130\nArticle 12, which we looked at in a prior\nepisode, transparent information,\n\n374\n00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.865\ncommunication modalities for the exercise\nof the rights of the data subject.\n\n375\n00:18:42.865 --> 00:18:43.675\nArticle 12 and\n\n376\n00:18:43.675 --> 00:18:48.260\nArticle 15 are really both being brought\nto bare here around the rights of access.\n\n377\n00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.745\nWe wanna keep that in mind.\n\n378\n00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:54.722\nArticle 15 gives us the specific grant\nof that right, named as such, but\n\n379\n00:18:54.722 --> 00:18:56.856\nit references to Article 12.\n\n380\n00:18:56.856 --> 00:19:01.077\nAnd talks about the fact that we have to\nthen pay attention to what Article 12 says\n\n381\n00:19:01.077 --> 00:19:05.174\nabout the structure, the nature, and\nthe relationship between controller,\n\n382\n00:19:05.174 --> 00:19:07.040\nprocessor, and data subject.\n\n383\n00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.752\nAnd the very first couple of lines\nof Article 12 references Article 15,\n\n384\n00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:12.613\nwhich is the Right of Access, right.\n\n385\n00:19:12.613 --> 00:19:16.331\nSo we see this cross-pollination as we\ntalked about it in the other episodes.\n\n386\n00:19:16.331 --> 00:19:19.292\nI just wanna make sure we're aware\nthen reminding you of it here.\n\n387\n00:19:19.292 --> 00:19:22.552\nBut we do need to follow the rules and\nthe stipulations layed out to really\n\n388\n00:19:22.552 --> 00:19:26.090\nunderstand how to apply these rights,\nor apply these rules in the proper way.\n\n389\n00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n390\n00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n391\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, I think that about\ncovers it up for our Right of Access,\n\n392\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.210\nbut you don't wanna go anywhere.\n\n393\n00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.940\nWe have, how many,\nsix more rights left to cover?\n\n394\n00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.324\n&gt;&gt; We have six more,\nour third one coming up.\n\n395\n00:19:37.324 --> 00:19:38.079\n&gt;&gt; For this topic.\n\n396\n00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:39.250\n&gt;&gt; For this group.\n\n397\n00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.330\nThe right to rectification\nis right number three.\n\n398\n00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.180\nWe're gonna,\nI think entertain that one next.\n\n399\n00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Adam.\n\n400\n00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.550\nThank you for joining us, and\nthank you for joining us as well.\n\n401\n00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.210\nWe're gonna sign out

[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\n\n14\n00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.706\nI would always have the ability to rectify\nmy introduction if I need to, right?\n\n15\n00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:43.536\nYeah, you're over reaching,\nbut that's okay.\n\n16\n00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:44.904\n&gt;&gt;

I like that.\n\n22\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.080\n&gt;&gt; So these little episodelets,\n\n23\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.480\nwe're just having quick kind\nof side conversation with you.\n\n24\n00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.390\nUsually much smaller amount of time\nthan our traditional episodes would run,\n\n25\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.650\nespecially when I'm talking.\n\n26\n00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.490\nWe're just going it through and revisiting\nthose rights that we laid out for\n\n27\n00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.620\nyou in the overview episode when we\ntalked about the individual rights.\n\n28\n00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.225\nWe laid out all eight rights that are as\nspecified in the GDPR for the individual,\n\n29\n00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:23.676\nfor the data subject to take advantage of.\n\n30\n00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:25.990\nWe're walking through them one at a time.\n\n31\n00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.430\nWe're doing right number three on our\nlist, the right to rectification.\n\n32\n00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.722\nThis comes to us from Article 16 and\nArticle 19.\n\n33\n00:01:32.722 --> 00:01:35.732\nWe're gonna take a look at it in just\na minute if you want to join me here.\n\n34\n00:01:35.732 --> 00:01:39.180\nArticle 16 is the right to rectification.\n\n35\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.770\nYou can see it right there in Section\n3 under rectification and erasure.\n\n36\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.410\nYou can probably surmise we'll be coming\nback and taking a look at the right to\n\n37\n00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.725\nerasure, right to be forgotten here\nunder Article 17 in our next episode,\n\n38\n00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:53.520\nin our next conversation around this.\n\n39\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.870\nBut for now let's focus on\nthe right to rectification.\n\n40\n00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.170\nSo, as we talked about this, we noted that\nas the data subject we have the right,\n\n41\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.520\nas it says there, to obtain from\nthe controller, without undue delay.\n\n42\n00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.450\nRemember we said without undue delay\ntypically means in a timely fashion,\n\n43\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.680\nspecified as a period of one month right?\n\n44\n00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.700\nFor the response, just so we know.\n\n45\n00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.030\nWith undo delay,\n\n46\n00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.910\nthe rectification of inaccurate\npersonal data concerning him or her.\n\n47\n00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.770\nMeaning, if we know something\nis just not correct, right?\n\n48\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.774\nMy name is Adam Gordon, and you spelled\nit instead of G-O-R-D-O-N, G-O-R-D-E-N.\n\n49\n00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:33.910\nOr you mislabeled it and\ncalled me Alan Gorden by mistake, or\n\n50\n00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.390\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n51\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.030\nAnd I know that that's the case,\nI'm almost scared to.\n\n52\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To look over\n\n53\n00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.990\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty funny, it's pretty funny.\n\n54\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we'll get to it in just\na second, let me finish the thought.\n\n55\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay I can wait.\n\n56\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.700\n&gt;&gt; So if that's the case, or\nwhatever the inconsistency is.\n\n57\n00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.700\nIt doesn't say there, hey if your name\nis spelled incorrectly, it's okay, but\n\n58\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.890\nif you're birthday is wrong it's not.\n\n59\n00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.455\nIt just says if the, if the data is\ninaccurate in some way concerning you,\n\n60\n00:02:58.455 --> 00:03:02.825\nyou have the right to an, without undue\ndelay, the right to see to rectify it.\n\n61\n00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:07.190\nSo, we're just establishing that the data\nsubject has the ability, the right, and\n\n62\n00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.290\nthe need to go back to the controller and\nexpect, in a reasonable timely fashion,\n\n63\n00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.390\nfor them to respond to this request\nto rectify the inaccurate data.\n\n64\n00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.630\nYes?\n\n65\n00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.820\n&gt;&gt; So my daughter actually has\na capital letter in her name.\n\n66\n00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.340\nSo on her desk and for young children,\nthey put their names on their desks.\n\n67\n00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.970\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, yeah, sure.\n\n68\n00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.950\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, her name is\nspelled incorrectly on her desk.\n\n69\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.630\nSo that may cause a little\nbit of concern [LAUGH].\n\n70\n00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.230\nIn a learning environment, right?\n\n71\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.460\nSo I can have that right to rectify to\n\n72\n00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.560\nhave my daughter's name spelled correctly\nso she knows what her name is, right?\n\n73\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.910\n&gt;&gt; You could if you lived inside the EU.\n\n74\n00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.070\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm out of luck.\n\n75\n00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.500\n&gt;&gt; You live in Gainesville,\nI just don't think that's.\n\n76\n00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.900\nUnfortunately, as far as I know,\nthey have not co-opted and\n\n77\n00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.930\nannexed Gainesville as of yet.\n\n78\n00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.350\nSo, you know, one can live in hope,\nyou never know.\n\n79\n00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You may wake up tomorrow and\n\n80\n00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.550\nfind out you're actually\nnow part of the EU, and\n\n81\n00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.140\nFrance has decided to take on Gainesville,\nwho knows?\n\n82\n00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.390\nBut, in the mean time,\n\n83\n00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.340\nwhich means football would mean\na whole different thing at that point.\n\n84\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.000\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n85\n00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.890\nWould no longer be football.\n\n86\n00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.690\n&gt;&gt; Futbol.\n&gt;&gt; It would be traditional,\n\n87\n00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.810\nreal, European football right\nwhich we like by the way right?\n\n88\n00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.330\n&gt;&gt; Of course we do.\n&gt;&gt; Soccer is cool, we like that.\n\n89\n00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.445\nSo for now, no you cannot.\n\n90\n00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:16.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n91\n00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.000\njust go in there where nobody's\nlooking with a sharpie or something.\n\n92\n00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.070\nTake care of it for\nher, and hook Capri up.\n\n93\n00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.710\nMake sure she's got that to spell great,\nso\n\n94\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.920\nyou actually, her name has capital A,\nyou spelled it that way on purpose.\n\n95\n00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.418\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and her last name.\n\n96\n00:04:27.418 --> 00:04:28.253\n&gt;&gt; Her last name.\n\n97\n00:04:28.253 --> 00:04:28.805\nSo it's like a,\none of those crazy last names?\n\n98\n00:04:28.805 --> 00:04:30.287\n&gt;&gt; Like a prefix yeah.\n\n99\n00:04:30.287 --> 00:04:32.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n100\n00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.870\nSo not the first name.\n\n101\n00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.740\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say that was probably\n\n102\n00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.375\na little unusual.\n\n103\n00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:38.105\n&gt;&gt; It would be unusual.\n\n104\n00:04:38.105 --> 00:04:39.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would be, okay.\n\n105\n00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:41.265\nAll right, so, but\nkeep in mind who I was talking to.\n\n106\n00:04:41.265 --> 00:04:42.774\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was going to say,\nyou should expect the unusual.\n\n107\n00:04:42.774 --> 00:04:44.185\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I would expect unusual,\n\n108\n00:04:44.185 --> 00:04:45.215\nthat's why I was wondering.\n\n109\n00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:46.385\nSo, the right to rectification,\n\n110\n00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:49.080\nif you're joining back on the screen\njust to finish our conversation.\n\n111\n00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.910\nThat was a random aside for\nour episodelet, by the way.\n\n112\n00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.420\nIn case you haven't seen us do that\nbefore, that's actually a very short one.\n\n113\n00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.302\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; Because normally we have ones\n\n114\n00:04:55.302 --> 00:04:55.880\nthat are more involved.\n\n115\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.550\n&gt;&gt; Have longer tangents, yeah.\n\n116\n00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.107\n&gt;&gt; But it's an episodelet,\n\n117\n00:04:58.107 --> 00:04:59.440\nso we have to keep it small\nbecause everything is shorter.\n\n118\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.510\n&gt;&gt; Shorter tangents, okay.\n\n119\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.205\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, taking into account the\npurposes for processing the data subject.\n\n120\n00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:09.750\nShall have the right to have this\nincomplete personal data completed,\n\n121\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.990\nincluding by means of providing\na supplementary state,\n\n122\n00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.850\nwhich means we have options\nto have this fixed.\n\n123\n00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.380\nWe may simply attach to the record\nadditional information that updates it.\n\n124\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.630\nWe may say to the processor or\nthe controller, hey, I need this fixed.\n\n125\n00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.660\nThey may say, okay, great, we'll redo it.\n\n126\n00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.960\nOr they may say, just send in this\nform and we'll update the record, so\n\n127\n00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.650\nthey have options.\n\n128\n00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.600\nSo do we.\n\n129\n00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.750\nWe need to understand that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n130\n00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.640\nNow, I've mention Article 19,\nso lets just scroll down here.\n\n131\n00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.940\nClosing your eyes, pretending for a minute\nthat you're not seeing Article 17 and\n\n132\n00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.180\nArticle 18 cause we'll be coming back and\ntalking about those.\n\n133\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.120\nBut Article 19, notification obligation\nregarding, [COUGH] excuse me, regarding\n\n134\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.430\nrectification or erasure of personal data,\nor restriction of processing.\n\n135\n00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.330\nSo, it says controller shall\ncommunicate any rectification or\n\n136\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.100\nerasure of personal data or restriction of\nprocessing carried out in accordance with\n\n137\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.330\nArticle 16, 17 and 18 as well,\nwhich bear on this also.\n\n138\n00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.660\nTo each recipient to whom\nthe personal data has been disclosed.\n\n139\n00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.670\n&gt;&gt; Unless this proves impossible or\ninvolves disproportionate effort.\n\n140\n00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.574\nThe controller shall inform the data\nsubject about those recipients of the data\n\n141\n00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:14.760\nsubject requested.\n\n142\n00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.710\nMeaning that, again if we have third\nparties downstream exposure for\n\n143\n00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.720\nthis data, we have to notify them,\n\n144\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.940\ncascading this change down to\ndo our best to update everybody.\n\n145\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.780\nWe talked about this in a prior episode.\n\n146\n00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.910\nAnd if the data subject wants\nto know who those parties are,\n\n147\n00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.350\nthey have the right to request that.\n\n148\n00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.140\nAnd the data then should\nbe provided to them.\n\n149\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.500\nSo the controller should then\nbe able to provide that.\n\n150\n00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.240\nNow, if we're not gonna take action,\nas the controller or\n\n151\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.940\nprocessor, in response to this request,\nwe have to be aware that we may not.\n\n152\n00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.610\nWe must explain, as we said, to the data\nsubject why we're not going to.\n\n153\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.900\nRemember, not every\nrequest has to be honored.\n\n154\n00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.440\nNot every request is gonna fall\nunder the category of doable and\n\n155\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.150\nnot excessive or not manifestly unfounded.\n\n156\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.730\nAnd as a result we may or\nmay not choose to honor that request for\n\n157\n00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.940\na variety of reasons.\n\n158\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.030\nIf we choose to opt out,\nwe must explain why to the individual,\n\n159\n00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.170\nto the data subject,\nthat we are not doing it.\n\n160\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.800\nAnd inform them, if you remember,\nof their right to go appeal that\n\n161\n00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.440\nwith a supervisory authority and\nto seek a judicial remedy.\n\n162\n00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.390\nThat doesn't mean they'll get one, doesn't\nmean they won't, doesn't mean that we will\n\n163\n00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.450\nnot then be compelled to respond\neven though we chose not to.\n\n164\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.530\nIt simply means that there are options at\nthat point, forks in the road if you will,\n\n165\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.740\nand we have to make everybody\naware of what their choices are.\n\n166\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.850\nAnd then sit back and leave it at that\npoint in the hands of the data subject\n\n167\n00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.097\nto decide on the next steps, right?\n\n168\n00:07:33.097 --> 00:07:35.490\nBecause then,\nessentially the next move is up to them.\n\n169\n00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.680\nIf they choose not to appeal,\nthen that's where we stop.\n\n170\n00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.190\nWe've said no, they've not appealed that.\n\n171\n00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.720\nAnd that's it, they can come back and\nrequest again, we can keep saying no.\n\n172\n00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.260\nBut unless they go to\nthe supervisory authority and\n\n173\n00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.460\nseek a judicial remedy,\nthat's not gonna change most likely.\n\n174\n00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.850\nBut if they do, and\nthe supervisory authority says,\n\n175\n00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.440\nno you have to comply within\na reasonable amount of time.\n\n176\n00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.230\nPerhaps giving us that two month extension\nlike we discussed maybe we need.\n\n177\n00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.570\nThen that may change.\n\n178\n00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.710\nSo it's up to us to think about that both\nfrom the controller-processor side, but\n\n179\n00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.222\nalso from the data-subject side.\n\n180\n00:08:07.222 --> 00:08:10.440\nSo, wanna just have that mind as we\ntalk about the right to rectify.\n\n181\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.910\nAll right well thank you for that tidbit.\n\n182\n00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.900\nDo you have any final thoughts\nbefore we move on to our next right?\n\n183\n00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.073\n&gt;&gt; I do not other than to say that our\nnext right is gonna be the right to\n\n184\n00:08:18.073 --> 00:08:18.730\nerasure.\n\n185\n00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.530\nI'm taking a quick peek at\nmy list of rights here, so\n\n186\n00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.060\nI can see which one comes up next.\n\n187\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.760\nKeep up in track and on order,\ngiven the way we did them in the overview.\n\n188\n00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.120\nBut the right to erasure as we talked\nabout, we're going to speak about next.\n\n189\n00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.610\nBut no, other than that, just to\nremind everybody about the right and\n\n190\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.680\nwhat we're going to be doing.\n\n191\n00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.590\nI think we're good, keeping in mind that\nyou actually got a sneak peak at the right\n\n192\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.090\nto erasure, right to be forgotten.\n\n193\n00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.960\nThat was Article 17, but we're going\nto pretend I didn't tell you that.\n\n194\n00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.690\nAnd when you come back, you're gonna\nact surprised when I show it to you and\n\n195\n00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.615\nexplain why it's there.\n\n196\n00:08:44.615 --> 00:08:46.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was not the right\n\n197\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.385\nthat you were looking for.\n\n198\n00:08:47.385 --> 00:08:49.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, thank you Adam.\n\n199\n00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:54.220\nAnd thank you joining us but stay tuned,\nyou don't wanna miss the right of erasure.\n\n200\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.265\nOr the the right to be forgotten, okay.\n\n201\n00:08:57.265 --> 00:08:59.992\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget the right to be forgotten.\n\n202\n00:08:59.992 --> 00:09:05.731\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you, see you, bye.\n\n203\n00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:11.470\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:06.775\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:08.310\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.923\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.923 --> 00:00:13.942\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your GDPR series.\n\n7\n00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:16.370\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.200\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at the right to erasure.\n\n9\n00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.655\nAnd with us today in studios we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:27.311\nBut the remainder of this episode\nwill be spoken only in our\n\n11\n00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:31.800\nbest Arnold Schwarzenegger voices,\nas he did in the movie The Eraser.\n\n12\n00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:36.081\nNo?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n13\n00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:38.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not opting into that.\n\n14\n00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.632\nYou did not receive my unequivocal-\n&gt;&gt; Consent?\n\n15\n00:00:41.632 --> 00:00:45.613\n&gt;&gt; And unambiguous and\nfreely given consent for that.\n\n16\n00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:46.876\nI'm gonna opt out and\nexercise my right to be forgotten.\n\n17\n00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:50.559\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can you erase me from this episode, so\n\n18\n00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:51.239\nwe could start over?\n\n19\n00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.905\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I'm not gonna do my best\n\n20\n00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:57.920\nArnold Schwarzenegger impersonation for\ntwo very good compelling reasons.\n\n21\n00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.460\nOne, I will not subject you to\nthat because it would be painful.\n\n22\n00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.286\nAnd number two, I'm afraid he'd come find\nme and beat me up after I made fun of him.\n\n23\n00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:07.801\nSo for those two reasons,\nI'm not gonna do that.\n\n24\n00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.840\nBut what I am gonna do for you,\nwhich is gonna be equally important.\n\n25\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.130\nAnd I am willing to wager and say,\nmore impactful is we're gonna talk about\n\n26\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.228\nthe right to erasure or what's commonly\nknown as the right to be forgotten.\n\n27\n00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:21.150\nBut we're gonna do so and make sure\nyou understand the following, cuz\n\n28\n00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.200\npeople often miss this particular thought\nprocess that I'm about to share with you.\n\n29\n00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.640\nFirst of all, let's take a look at it.\n\n30\n00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.160\nYou saw this in the last episode, right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.170\nThis is not a surprise to\nyou if you watched us.\n\n32\n00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.210\nWe previewed it on Article 17, the right\nto erasure and the right to be forgotten.\n\n33\n00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.840\nSo if you read carefully the statement\nthere under Article 17, line\n\n34\n00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.120\nitem number 1, it says, the data subject\nshall have the right to obtain from\n\n35\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.720\nthe controller erasure of their personal\ndata concerning them without undue delay.\n\n36\n00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.260\nWe've already talked about that.\n\n37\n00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.240\nAnd the controller shall have\nthe obligation to erase personal data\n\n38\n00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.150\nwithout undue delay.\n\n39\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.550\nWe've talked about that, where one\nof the following grounds applies.\n\n40\n00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.110\nAnd this is where it gets\na little interesting,\n\n41\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.150\nbecause we often hear people talk about\nthe fact that the right to erasure or\n\n42\n00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.420\nright to be forgotten is essentially\na standing universal right.\n\n43\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.660\nMeaning, you just make the request as\nthe data subject and that has to happen.\n\n44\n00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.860\nAnd that's not the case.\n\n45\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.660\nThere are many exceptions\nwhere you do not need, or\n\n46\n00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.750\nhave the ability to have your data erased.\n\n47\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.100\nBut there are many exceptions or\nsituations where you should, and\n\n48\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.060\nlegitimately do,\nhave the right to have your data erased.\n\n49\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.035\nSo we need to understand that.\n\n50\n00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:21.138\nSo we're gonna go take a look.\n\n51\n00:02:21.138 --> 00:02:25.057\nSo they need to respond, the controller\nneeds to respond in a timely fashion\n\n52\n00:02:25.057 --> 00:02:28.870\nwithout undue delay, where one or\nmore of the following grounds apply.\n\n53\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.880\nSo let's just take a look here and\nlet me just scroll down.\n\n54\n00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.530\nWe have a listing of them.\n\n55\n00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.260\nThere's a total of six items here.\n\n56\n00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260\nYou could see almost all of them,\nkind of the bottom one poking out at\n\n57\n00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.020\nthe bottom there,\nwe'll take a look in a minute.\n\n58\n00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.490\nSo starting with item number 8.\n\n59\n00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.055\nPersonal data are no longer necessary\nin relation to the purposes for\n\n60\n00:02:45.055 --> 00:02:47.860\nwhich they were collected\norotherwise processed.\n\n61\n00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.670\nMeaning, the data is no longer needed\nbased on the terms of service and\n\n62\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.850\nthe terms of collection.\n\n63\n00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.300\nAnd we are requesting to have it removed,\nbecause it is just no longer valid.\n\n64\n00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.372\nSo that is a legitimate and\ncompelling reason to have that done.\n\n65\n00:02:59.372 --> 00:03:06.398\nItem B, the data subject withdraws consent\non which the processing has been based.\n\n66\n00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:08.864\nMeaning, I come back to you and say,\nhey, guess what, you know what?\n\n67\n00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:11.118\nI rethought this.\n\n68\n00:03:11.118 --> 00:03:15.425\nI'm no longer interested in having\nmy opt-in, my consent be there.\n\n69\n00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:19.480\nPlease remove me as a result me deciding\nto say no instead of saying yes, right?\n\n70\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.751\nBuyer's remorse is what we\noften refer to this as.\n\n71\n00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:23.800\n&gt;&gt; All the time.\n&gt;&gt; So we can think about that.\n\n72\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.710\nAnd so,\nif we base this on a point in Article 6 or\n\n73\n00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.320\nArticle 9, as you can see,\nwe are then able to do that.\n\n74\n00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.640\nItem C, the data subject objects to\nthe processing pursuant to Article 21,\n\n75\n00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.400\nwhich is down below.\n\n76\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.520\nWe haven't seen that yet, but\nwe can take a look quickly and we will.\n\n77\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.900\nAnd there are no overriding\nlegitimate grounds for processing.\n\n78\n00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.890\nOr the data subject objects\n\n79\n00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.280\nto the processing pursuant to Article 21,\neither subclause (1) or (2).\n\n80\n00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.358\nLet's take a look at Article 21 for\njust a moment.\n\n81\n00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:56.502\nWe'll come back up here in just a second.\n\n82\n00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.830\nI'll just get rid of this real quick,\nso we could see where we are.\n\n83\n00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.160\nAll right, so let's go down to Article 21.\n\n84\n00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.300\nAnd Article 21, right here,\nRight to Object, right?\n\n85\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.960\nSo obviously important to reference this.\n\n86\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.810\nAnd again,\none of the rights we'll come back to and\n\n87\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.310\ntake a look at here in\na subsequent episode.\n\n88\n00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.045\nBut our episode-lette, right?\n\n89\n00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:17.815\nBut items 1 and 2, the data subject\nshall have the right to object,\n\n90\n00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:20.935\non grounds relating to his or\nher particular situation,\n\n91\n00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:24.315\nat any time to processing\nthe personal data concerning them,\n\n92\n00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:27.249\nwhich is based on points (e) or\n(f) of Article 6.\n\n93\n00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:29.627\nSo meaning, you're going back and\nforth doing these crazy things.\n\n94\n00:04:29.627 --> 00:04:31.557\nCan you imagine the mind map that\nactually [INAUDIBLE] all this?\n\n95\n00:04:31.557 --> 00:04:33.872\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n[LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:04:33.872 --> 00:04:34.867\n&gt;&gt; Get a headache just trying to\n\n97\n00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:36.115\nkeep track of everything.\n\n98\n00:04:36.115 --> 00:04:39.945\nBut including things like profiling, which\nwe talked about, which is another right,\n\n99\n00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:43.185\nwhich when we have automated profiling,\nwe have the option and\n\n100\n00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:45.287\nthe rights of the subject\nto potentially opt out.\n\n101\n00:04:45.287 --> 00:04:48.135\nBecause if there's no human intervention,\nwe may object to that.\n\n102\n00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:50.925\nSo we've talked about this, and\nthis is what we're talking about.\n\n103\n00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:54.005\nAlso the controller shall no longer\nprocess personal data unless\n\n104\n00:04:54.005 --> 00:04:57.757\nthe controller demonstrates compelling\nlegitimate grounds for processing,\n\n105\n00:04:57.757 --> 00:05:01.412\nwhich overrides the interests, rights,\nand freedoms of the data subject.\n\n106\n00:05:01.412 --> 00:05:04.829\nSo remember, unless we can prove\ncompelling evidence to the contrary,\n\n107\n00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:07.473\nwe usually have to stop when\nthe data subject says stop.\n\n108\n00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:08.909\nThat's a very important right.\n\n109\n00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:13.130\nAnd where personal data are processed for\ndirect marketing purposes, item number 2\n\n110\n00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.999\nthat was called out, the data subject\nshall have the right to object at anytime\n\n111\n00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:20.399\nto processing of personal data\nconcerning them for such marketing,\n\n112\n00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:24.470\nwhich includes profiling to the extent\nthat is related to such direct marketing.\n\n113\n00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.748\nIn other words, when we give your\ninformation to a vendor that goes off and\n\n114\n00:05:28.748 --> 00:05:33.440\nstart to spam you, we have the ability as\na data subject to go back and complain and\n\n115\n00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.035\nask for that to be removed.\n\n116\n00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:38.192\nAnd that has to be complied with if\nthat is really the main goal and\n\n117\n00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:42.410\neffort that the vendor, or the controller\nprocessor is putting in around that data.\n\n118\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.660\nSo we do just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that and\n\n119\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.750\nthinking through the logic\nof that as well.\n\n120\n00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.790\nSo let's go back up here to\nour Article 17 conversation.\n\n121\n00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.910\nLet's see where we are,\nRight to Erasure or Right to be Forgotten.\n\n122\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.140\nWe've just gone through and\nlooked at item number (c).\n\n123\n00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.960\nItem (d), the personal data\nhave been unlawfully processed.\n\n124\n00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.228\nRemember, we talked about\nlawful processing and\n\n125\n00:06:08.228 --> 00:06:09.634\nhow that would be stipulated.\n\n126\n00:06:09.634 --> 00:06:13.895\nIf we have unlawfully processed this data,\nthen the data subject does\n\n127\n00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:17.300\nhave a legitimate claim to ask for\nthe data to be erased.\n\n128\n00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.849\nI said, no, I don't want you to do that,\nand you did it anyway,\n\n129\n00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.390\nI have the right to come back and\nrequest that you cease.\n\n130\n00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.016\nAlso (e), the personal data\nhave to be erased in compliance\n\n131\n00:06:26.016 --> 00:06:29.224\nwith a legal obligation\nsomewhere in a member state and\n\n132\n00:06:29.224 --> 00:06:33.005\nor with the overarching EU law\nwhere the controller is subject.\n\n133\n00:06:33.005 --> 00:06:37.475\nMeaning, controller's offices promise\nto sit within the boundaries of the EU.\n\n134\n00:06:37.475 --> 00:06:39.165\nThe EU law says, you must do this.\n\n135\n00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:42.335\nWe must then do it, so just be aware\nof that as a legal obligation.\n\n136\n00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.805\nAnd the personal data has\nbeen collected in relation\n\n137\n00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:48.475\nto the offer of information and society\nservices referred to in Article 81.\n\n138\n00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:52.023\nRemember, we talked about information\nsociety services being online services,\n\n139\n00:06:52.023 --> 00:06:53.655\nthe services that we provide online.\n\n140\n00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:56.189\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n141\n00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:00.609\nAnd so as a result, we do lay out\nstipulations here around the specific or\n\n142\n00:07:00.609 --> 00:07:04.885\nspecificity of the conditions,\nspecific conditions specificity,\n\n143\n00:07:04.885 --> 00:07:09.749\nwhere we can see that we do have the right\nto erasure and this data can be removed.\n\n144\n00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:14.070\nNow there's been a lot of interesting\ncases that have come about either around\n\n145\n00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.754\nthis lateral to\nthe implementation of the GDPR,\n\n146\n00:07:16.754 --> 00:07:19.584\nperhaps separate from or\nin the early stages of it.\n\n147\n00:07:19.584 --> 00:07:23.118\nI've referenced one,\nthe case in Spain where Google and\n\n148\n00:07:23.118 --> 00:07:27.460\na Spanish national, or national of Spain,\nwent to court, because he\n\n149\n00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.896\nwas seeking to have his information\nremoved through Google searches.\n\n150\n00:07:31.896 --> 00:07:35.646\nAnd ultimately Google denied\nthe request initially.\n\n151\n00:07:35.646 --> 00:07:42.931\nBut then the claimant, the defendant in\nthe case, yeah, the person or individual.\n\n152\n00:07:42.931 --> 00:07:46.701\nWhen it made a supervisory request\nessentially when it complained to\n\n153\n00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:50.991\nthe supervisory agency, they came back and\nsaid as a judicial remedy, yeah,\n\n154\n00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:52.050\nyou should.\n\n155\n00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.340\nGoogle then went to court and sued,\nin Spanish court, and actually lost.\n\n156\n00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.560\nAnd they ultimately had\nto remove the data.\n\n157\n00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.199\nAnd this set the precedent for\nwhat many people point to as being kind of\n\n158\n00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:06.269\nthe breakwater event that has really led\nto this idea of right to be forgotten or\n\n159\n00:08:06.269 --> 00:08:08.447\nright to erasure becoming very popular.\n\n160\n00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:11.068\nBut there's been a lot of other cases\nin other countries, by the way, yeah.\n\n161\n00:08:11.068 --> 00:08:15.051\n&gt;&gt; Were they suing the supervisory\nentity or the individual?\n\n162\n00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:18.406\nThe counter-\n&gt;&gt; Well, the individual made the claim, so\n\n163\n00:08:18.406 --> 00:08:20.876\nthey essentially wound\nup being part of this.\n\n164\n00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:22.501\nBut Google went to court\nto essentially say,\n\n165\n00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:24.482\nwe're not gonna comply with\nthe supervisory agency.\n\n166\n00:08:24.482 --> 00:08:25.359\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n167\n00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:27.419\n&gt;&gt; Not that we're not gonna\ncomply with the individual,\n\n168\n00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:29.316\ncuz Google originally said\nno to the individual.\n\n169\n00:08:29.316 --> 00:08:30.624\nThe individual complained.\n\n170\n00:08:30.624 --> 00:08:35.060\nThe supervisory agency essentially\nnow represented them and said, no,\n\n171\n00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:35.855\nyou have to.\n\n172\n00:08:35.855 --> 00:08:37.076\nAnd they both wound up in court.\n\n173\n00:08:37.076 --> 00:08:38.510\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; And Google ultimately lost,\n\n174\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.869\nin Spanish court anyway, they lost.\n\n175\n00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:43.965\nSo Google Spain was seen as being\nan entity of Google, because Google's\n\n176\n00:08:43.965 --> 00:08:48.614\nargument was, well, we don't have to\ndo that, because we're a global entity.\n\n177\n00:08:48.614 --> 00:08:50.392\nAnd they said, well no,\nyou have offices here.\n\n178\n00:08:50.392 --> 00:08:52.910\nAnd Google Spain is essentially\na part of Google, right?\n\n179\n00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.903\nIt's not a separate country, a separate\nentity, and or a separate company.\n\n180\n00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:58.293\nAnd as a result, guess what?\n\n181\n00:08:58.293 --> 00:09:00.823\n[LAUGH] It applies to you because\nyou set foot in the EU and\n\n182\n00:09:00.823 --> 00:09:02.094\nyou're doing it this way.\n\n183\n00:09:02.094 --> 00:09:03.711\nAnd as a result, they actually had to.\n\n184\n00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:06.771\nBut there have been some interesting\ncases if you read up on this.\n\n185\n00:09:06.771 --> 00:09:09.291\nIn many countries,\nnot just the EU countries,\n\n186\n00:09:09.291 --> 00:09:12.504\nthere's actually cases that go\nback decades in some cases,\n\n187\n00:09:12.504 --> 00:09:15.665\nin the United States and\nother areas, that deal with this.\n\n188\n00:09:15.665 --> 00:09:18.368\nThere was a case, a very interesting and\n\n189\n00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:23.297\nfamous case from the 1920s in\nthe United States around somebody who,\n\n190\n00:09:23.297 --> 00:09:29.127\ndecades before, close to now 100 years\nbefore this all took place, sued and went.\n\n191\n00:09:29.127 --> 00:09:33.812\nAnd essentially the legitimacy of the case\nor the details of the case were that\n\n192\n00:09:33.812 --> 00:09:37.417\nyou had this woman who initially\nwas making her living as a,\n\n193\n00:09:37.417 --> 00:09:39.529\nlet's say a person of ill repute.\n\n194\n00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:42.590\nShe was a lady of the evening.\n\n195\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.740\nSo she was making her living doing that.\n\n196\n00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.370\nShe decided to stop that, and\nwent off and tried to clean her act up.\n\n197\n00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.613\nEssentially, lead a more what we would\nsay, would be a more just upstanding,\n\n198\n00:09:53.613 --> 00:09:55.840\nright, at that point in time life.\n\n199\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.270\nSo she changed her vocation, if you will.\n\n200\n00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:02.020\nAnd was living a normal quiet\nkind of nominal existence,\n\n201\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.295\njust faded from that background.\n\n202\n00:10:04.295 --> 00:10:07.016\nAnd nobody really knew who she was or\nwhat she had done in her prior life.\n\n203\n00:10:07.016 --> 00:10:10.484\nAnd then there was a movie that\nwas made that exposed her,\n\n204\n00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:14.386\nbecause she was a fairly famous\ncharacter at that point in time,\n\n205\n00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:18.017\nexposed her endless life and\nlinked it to her new identity.\n\n206\n00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:19.970\nAnd she sued.\n\n207\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.107\n&gt;&gt; And this was back in the 20s?\n\n208\n00:10:21.107 --> 00:10:22.782\n&gt;&gt; And this was back in the 20s,\nback in the 1920s in the US.\n\n209\n00:10:22.782 --> 00:10:24.170\nShe sued in the US court and\n\n210\n00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.337\nbrought the person who wrote the book that\nthe movie was based on and the movie,\n\n211\n00:10:28.337 --> 00:10:32.658\nwho made the movie to court to claim that\nthey had done this in an illegal fashion.\n\n212\n00:10:32.658 --> 00:10:33.895\nIt was a very interesting case.\n\n213\n00:10:33.895 --> 00:10:36.855\nBut essentially, played off what would\nbecome this idea of the right to be\n\n214\n00:10:36.855 --> 00:10:38.402\nforgotten, the right to erasure.\n\n215\n00:10:38.402 --> 00:10:43.152\nSo we've seen there's a pattern here that\nin many countries goes back decades.\n\n216\n00:10:43.152 --> 00:10:44.172\nThis is not just a new thing,\n\n217\n00:10:44.172 --> 00:10:47.162\nwhere in the last five or ten years\nthis has suddenly become an issue.\n\n218\n00:10:47.162 --> 00:10:49.222\nWhen you read up on the case law,\nit's actually fascinating,\n\n219\n00:10:49.222 --> 00:10:52.526\nbecause there's examples from all\nover the world in various places\n\n220\n00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:54.576\naround aspects of this law in one form or\nanother.\n\n221\n00:10:54.576 --> 00:10:55.625\nKind of interesting stuff.\n\n222\n00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:57.301\n&gt;&gt; Was she awarded anything\nin that particular case?\n\n223\n00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:58.704\n&gt;&gt; You'd have to go\nlook it up to find out.\n\n224\n00:10:58.704 --> 00:11:00.173\n&gt;&gt; Cliffhanger, Adam.\n\n225\n00:11:00.173 --> 00:11:01.913\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna tell you everything.\n\n226\n00:11:01.913 --> 00:11:04.972\nThen you'll have no reason to go out and\nto find out for yourself.\n\n227\n00:11:04.972 --> 00:11:05.662\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n228\n00:11:05.662 --> 00:11:07.995\n&gt;&gt; But it is kind of interesting,\nif you look at the case actually,\n\n229\n00:11:07.995 --> 00:11:09.042\na really fascinating case.\n\n230\n00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:11.498\nPretty cool actually,\nbecause it took place, I think,\n\n231\n00:11:11.498 --> 00:11:15.092\nin the late 1920s if I remember correctly,\n25, 27, somewhere in there.\n\n232\n00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:18.665\nSo the late 1920s, when if you think about\nwhat was going on in the United States\n\n233\n00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:22.035\naround that time, right around the\nDepression, women had just been recently\n\n234\n00:11:22.035 --> 00:11:24.870\ngiven additional rights,\nthe right to vote, things like that.\n\n235\n00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.590\nThe suffrage movement was\nreally just happening.\n\n236\n00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.120\nAnd it was a very different time,\n\n237\n00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.440\nand yet, she was able to go and\ncreate a lawsuit and drag them into court.\n\n238\n00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.598\nKind of interesting when\nyou think about that.\n\n239\n00:11:34.598 --> 00:11:37.692\nSo you may wanna be checking out,\nI don't know, Wikipedia,\n\n240\n00:11:37.692 --> 00:11:40.024\nI'm thinking may give\nyou some information.\n\n241\n00:11:40.024 --> 00:11:40.576\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Among other\n\n242\n00:11:40.576 --> 00:11:41.147\nplaces you could take a look there.\n\n243\n00:11:41.147 --> 00:11:43.646\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're being very vague\nabout all the details here, so\n\n244\n00:11:43.646 --> 00:11:44.927\nI'll have to do some homework.\n\n245\n00:11:44.927 --> 00:11:45.494\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n246\n00:11:45.494 --> 00:11:47.860\nit's not pertinent specifically\nto the GDPR conversation.\n\n247\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.156\nI'm just giving you a little\nflavor in historical content.\n\n248\n00:11:50.156 --> 00:11:51.035\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate it.\n\n249\n00:11:51.035 --> 00:11:54.555\n&gt;&gt; If you go out and actually do a search,\nall kidding aside, do a search for\n\n250\n00:11:54.555 --> 00:11:57.380\nright to be forgotten or right of erasure.\n\n251\n00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.593\nAnd you look up case law to see if you\ncan find the case that I'm talking about\n\n252\n00:12:00.593 --> 00:12:03.463\namong many others those in various\ncountries, believe it or not.\n\n253\n00:12:03.463 --> 00:12:06.085\nWe did talk about the fact that we can\n\n254\n00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:08.405\nrefuse to comply with a request for\nerasure.\n\n255\n00:12:08.405 --> 00:12:13.195\nI spoke about the fact that there\nare reasons why a processor or\n\n256\n00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:17.910\ncontroller function may choose to do that,\nto exercise the right of freedom, or\n\n257\n00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.540\nrather, excuse me, let me try that again.\n\n258\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.901\nI did say there are reasons\nwhy we could do that, so\n\n259\n00:12:21.901 --> 00:12:24.220\nI just wanna make sure\nthat we're aware of that.\n\n260\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.805\nBut if we refuse to comply, we have to\nstand on certain bedrock assumptions.\n\n261\n00:12:28.805 --> 00:12:32.257\nJoin me back here, this is item\nnumber number 2 as we continue down.\n\n262\n00:12:32.257 --> 00:12:36.165\nSo you'll see here where the controller\nhas made the personal data public, and\n\n263\n00:12:36.165 --> 00:12:39.489\nis obliged, as you can see here,\nto paragraph are obliged pursuant\n\n264\n00:12:39.489 --> 00:12:42.376\nto paragraph 1 of the above,\nto erase the personal data.\n\n265\n00:12:42.376 --> 00:12:45.000\nSo we've made it public,\nnow we're being obliged to erase it.\n\n266\n00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.419\nThe controller taking account of available\ntechnology, cost of implementation, etc.,\n\n267\n00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:53.340\ntakes reasonable steps in order to do\nthis, and make sure that that happens.\n\n268\n00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:58.360\nParagraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to\nthe extent that processing is necessary.\n\n269\n00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.370\n(a), for exercising the right of freedom\nor of expression and or information.\n\n270\n00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.855\n(b), for\ncompliance with a legal obligation,\n\n271\n00:13:04.855 --> 00:13:08.701\nwhich requires processing under state\nlaw to which a controller is subject or\n\n272\n00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:12.546\nthe performance of a task carried out in\nthe pursuant of the public interest or\n\n273\n00:13:12.546 --> 00:13:15.826\nin the exercise of official\nauthority vested in the controller.\n\n274\n00:13:15.826 --> 00:13:18.865\nMeaning, if they're a public entity,\na government entity, all right?\n\n275\n00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:22.246\nFor reasons of public interest in the area\nof public health in accordance with\n\n276\n00:13:22.246 --> 00:13:23.764\nvarious points in some articles.\n\n277\n00:13:23.764 --> 00:13:27.780\nMeaning, there are reasons why we\nmay not grant a right of erasure and\n\n278\n00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.000\npursue that, right?\n\n279\n00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.340\nSo we do need to be aware of that.\n\n280\n00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.358\nFor instance, for the establishment,\nexercise, or defense of legal claims.\n\n281\n00:13:34.358 --> 00:13:37.167\nYou can't just go erase data if\nit's gonna impact somebody's\n\n282\n00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:38.601\nability to bring suit, right?\n\n283\n00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:41.834\nYou may have to keep that data in\nplay in order for them to prove or\n\n284\n00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:44.948\nto provide evidence for\nthat case until that is figured out,\n\n285\n00:13:44.948 --> 00:13:48.510\nfor reasons of public health,\nfor reasons of public safety.\n\n286\n00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.520\nSo there have been cases again,\n\n287\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.930\nwhere depending on the interpretation\nof jurisdiction and\n\n288\n00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.860\nlaw by country, certain countries\ninterpret certain things certain ways.\n\n289\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.910\nFor instance, in both Great Britain and\nFrance, when you have been convicted of\n\n290\n00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:06.040\na crime and served your sentence,\nthey historically, both countries,\n\n291\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.980\nhave viewed that as essentially\ninformation that is no longer pertinent or\n\n292\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.290\nrelevant to your history.\n\n293\n00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.080\nShould be scrubbed or\nremoved to allow you to move forward.\n\n294\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.242\nThings like applying for a job and things\nof that nature become easier if you're not\n\n295\n00:14:18.242 --> 00:14:21.638\ncarrying around potentially baggage\nfrom a criminal enterprise.\n\n296\n00:14:21.638 --> 00:14:24.971\nAnd so they view, at least those\ntwo countries do historically,\n\n297\n00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:28.788\nthe fact that if you've served your\nsentence and done so under the terms and\n\n298\n00:14:28.788 --> 00:14:32.725\nconditions that you were given, that you\nshould then no longer have that data\n\n299\n00:14:32.725 --> 00:14:36.812\nreferenced for purposes, like I said,\nemployment and things of that nature.\n\n300\n00:14:36.812 --> 00:14:39.925\nSo they will expunge those records and\nremove it traditionally.\n\n301\n00:14:39.925 --> 00:14:42.176\nSo there are reasons why\nwe may keep that data, but\n\n302\n00:14:42.176 --> 00:14:44.385\nthere are reasons why we\nmay choose to remove it.\n\n303\n00:14:44.385 --> 00:14:47.474\nA lot of that depends on legal\ninterpretation by country.\n\n304\n00:14:47.474 --> 00:14:51.848\nWhat the GDPR is saying is, let's\nstandardize the reasons we do and don't,\n\n305\n00:14:51.848 --> 00:14:55.031\nand let's keep this essentially\nthe same everywhere.\n\n306\n00:14:55.031 --> 00:14:57.331\nLet's create these broad categories so\nwe understand that.\n\n307\n00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:59.810\nAnd as a result,\nthen let's act accordingly.\n\n308\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.554\nNow what about the rights to apply\nerasure to children's personal data?\n\n309\n00:15:03.554 --> 00:15:07.731\nAgain, we think about this, and have to\nunderstand and think through the logic of\n\n310\n00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:11.605\nthe fact that children have really been\ngiven this protected class status of\n\n311\n00:15:11.605 --> 00:15:15.197\nthe special status, carved out in\nmany respects in areas of the GDPR.\n\n312\n00:15:15.197 --> 00:15:18.751\nAnd we just wanna acknowledge and\nbe aware of the fact that that's the case.\n\n313\n00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:21.936\nWe have to pay special attention\nto existing situations,\n\n314\n00:15:21.936 --> 00:15:24.539\nwhere a child has given\nconsent to processing.\n\n315\n00:15:24.539 --> 00:15:25.466\nWe talked about that.\n\n316\n00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:30.874\nRemember, age of consent, 16 by definition\nin GDPR, perhaps as low as 13 based on\n\n317\n00:15:30.874 --> 00:15:36.750\nmember state opt-in, opt-out, but no lower\nthan 13, unless we have a parent involved.\n\n318\n00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.050\nSo we have to just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n319\n00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.784\nAnd this is really especially\nimportant with Internet services,\n\n320\n00:15:42.784 --> 00:15:45.190\nthings like social networking\nas you were talking about.\n\n321\n00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.696\nWhere if they've been for or if they've\nconsent, or they have informed consent\n\n322\n00:15:48.696 --> 00:15:51.799\nthat we have to think about whether or\nnot that was done appropriately.\n\n323\n00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:56.009\nAnd whether or not as a result of the\nchild understood fully the risks involved\n\n324\n00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:57.515\nwith consenting, right?\n\n325\n00:15:57.515 --> 00:16:02.510\nBecause a 14-year-old child may not be\nable to say yes to the risks associated\n\n326\n00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.030\nwith using, and again,\nnot maligning any company.\n\n327\n00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.293\nNot saying in any way, good or bad,\nthat this or that company does or\n\n328\n00:16:09.293 --> 00:16:12.123\ndoesn't do a good job with this,\nwe'll keep it generic.\n\n329\n00:16:12.123 --> 00:16:18.239\nThat using Company X's web service,\nright, is a good or a bad idea.\n\n330\n00:16:18.239 --> 00:16:21.315\nA 14-year-old opting in to get onto one\nof these web services may not truly\n\n331\n00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:23.587\nunderstand the risks involved\nwith creating a profile,\n\n332\n00:16:23.587 --> 00:16:25.919\nperhaps sharing information\nabout themselves, right?\n\n333\n00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:29.258\n&gt;&gt; Right, especially if it's more,\nI don't wanna say peer pressure,\n\n334\n00:16:29.258 --> 00:16:32.667\nbut if it's more of the trendy thing\nto do and other people are doing it.\n\n335\n00:16:32.667 --> 00:16:33.515\n&gt;&gt; There could be an issue.\n\n336\n00:16:33.515 --> 00:16:35.409\n&gt;&gt; Or just not educated to\nthose risks associated.\n\n337\n00:16:35.409 --> 00:16:39.377\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so we have to understand\nthat as the controller or processor,\n\n338\n00:16:39.377 --> 00:16:43.283\nwe have to take extra special care here\nwhere we deal with right of erasure or\n\n339\n00:16:43.283 --> 00:16:46.636\nright to be forgotten around this\nprotected class of children.\n\n340\n00:16:46.636 --> 00:16:49.261\nBecause they may have opted in\nwithout truly understanding the risks\n\n341\n00:16:49.261 --> 00:16:50.175\nassociated with this.\n\n342\n00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:53.515\nAnd we have to give them,\nessentially, what the GDRP is saying,\n\n343\n00:16:53.515 --> 00:16:57.646\nthe benefit of that doubt and be sensitive\nto that fact that we probably have to act\n\n344\n00:16:57.646 --> 00:17:01.153\nerror on the side of caution there,\nright, is what we're saying.\n\n345\n00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:05.090\nAnd give them extra consideration for\nlack of better way of putting that.\n\n346\n00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.530\nWe just have to understand that.\n\n347\n00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.870\nSo we do have to keep that in mind, and\nalso keep in mind obviously the timeline\n\n348\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:12.650\nassociated with responding\nto these particular events.\n\n349\n00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:17.320\nDo we have to tell other organizations\nabout the erasure of personal data?\n\n350\n00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:21.000\nWe did say that there is a requirement to\npay attention to downstream reporting.\n\n351\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.750\nWe called that out and\ntalked about that in the statute.\n\n352\n00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.780\nSo you just wanna keep in mind that these\nthings are all part of the right of\n\n353\n00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.300\nerasure, right to be forgotten, as we've\nbeen talking through in many respects.\n\n354\n00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.580\nAnd we do have this ability and\n\n355\n00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:36.240\nthis need to inform the entire information\nmanagement chain of the desire to do this,\n\n356\n00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.970\nbecause those downstream parties\nhave to also remove that data.\n\n357\n00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.100\nOtherwise, it's gonna stay in\nthe public domain or wherever it is.\n\n358\n00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.149\nAnd that will potentially not fully\nsatisfy the request from the data subject\n\n359\n00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:50.087\nto remove that data,\nwhich would then cause a problem.\n\n360\n00:17:50.087 --> 00:17:55.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, so do you have any final\nthoughts here for our right to erasure?\n\n361\n00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.368\n&gt;&gt; I could say that I'll\nbe back with another-\n\n362\n00:17:57.368 --> 00:18:00.311\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say I'll be back,\n\n363\n00:18:00.311 --> 00:18:01.286\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; With another\n\n364\n00:18:01.286 --> 00:18:01.831\nright, but-\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n365\n00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:02.646\nyou have to say it like, I'll be back.\n\n366\n00:18:02.646 --> 00:18:04.114\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm not gonna say it like that.\n\n367\n00:18:04.114 --> 00:18:05.390\nI'll leave that one to you.\n\n368\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.630\nBut I will say,\n\n369\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.590\nthat we are gonna come back continuing\nour discussion with rights.\n\n370\n00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.310\nThis one will be the right\nto restrict processing,\n\n371\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.230\nwhich is actually Article 18 right\nbelow where we were in the document.\n\n372\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.050\nWe're gonna continue\nwalking through there.\n\n373\n00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.669\nBut if you join us for\nthe next episode or episode-lette,\n\n374\n00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:22.619\nwe will be talking about the right\nto restriction of processing.\n\n375\n00:18:22.619 --> 00:18:23.548\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you, Adam.\n\n376\n00:18:23.548 --> 00:18:25.166\nAnd thank you for joining us as well.\n\n377\n00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:29.896\nWe'll see you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n378\n00:18:29.896 --> 00:18:35.877\n[MUSIC]\n\n379\n00:18:35.877 --> 00:18:38.672\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:11.219\nYou're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.732\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your GDPR Series.\n\n5\n00:00:13.732 --> 00:00:16.310\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.360\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat the right to restrict processing.\n\n7\n00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.420\nAnd back with us in the studios\ntoday we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.790\nThank you for joining us, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.110\n&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.070\nI am hopefully in the next couple of\nminutes in our little episode-lette here\n\n11\n00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.660\ngonna help you walk through\nthe thought process around right to\n\n12\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.790\nrestriction to processing.\n\n13\n00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.470\nNow, we've been talking a lot about\nthe different rights and the articles and\n\n14\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.540\nwe've kind of been going in order.\n\n15\n00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.400\nYou could see as we walked\nthrough the articles, article 17,\n\n16\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.330\nthe right to erasure, article 18,\nright to restriction and processing, etc.\n\n17\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.580\nThat we're using the document to our\nadvantage, really dissecting those\n\n18\n00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.960\nsections that pertain to\nthe individual discussion on rights.\n\n19\n00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.690\nWe're gonna continue that\nthought process here.\n\n20\n00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.890\nJoin me if you will,\nthe right to restriction of processing.\n\n21\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.027\nSo what we're talking about here is the\ndata subject's ability to go to the data\n\n22\n00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:03.606\ncontroller or processor function and\nsay hey, i need you to stop what\n\n23\n00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:07.334\nyou're doing because something is\nnot right and here's why, right?\n\n24\n00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.800\nIt's not the same thing as forget my data,\nremove it, and never look at it.\n\n25\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.780\nBut rather, let's put a hold on\nwhat we're doing, let's validate,\n\n26\n00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.890\nlet's make sure things are good and\nlet's decide whether or\n\n27\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.060\nnot we're going to resume and go forward.\n\n28\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.110\nSo slightly different approach.\n\n29\n00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.410\nSo the data subject, item one, shall have\nthe right to obtain from the controller\n\n30\n00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.610\nrestriction of processing where one or\nmore of the following applies.\n\n31\n00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.320\nLet me just scroll down so\nthat we can clearly see.\n\n32\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.560\nWe have four items here, A through D.\n\n33\n00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.180\nAccuracy of personal data is\ncontested by the data subject.\n\n34\n00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.150\nWe claimed something is not accurate or\nvalid.\n\n35\n00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.630\nFour period enabling the controller to\nverify the accuracy of the personal data\n\n36\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.390\nmeaning, hey stop,\nI don't think that that's right, right?\n\n37\n00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.880\nBut let me give you time to go figure\nwhether or not it is and let's correct it.\n\n38\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.510\nAgain, not the same thing as erase my data\nand no longer wanna play in the game.\n\n39\n00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.970\nI no longer want you to have my\ninformation but rather, it's incorrect.\n\n40\n00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.160\nLet's try to fix it.\n\n41\n00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160\nLet's put a hold on\nprocessing until we do.\n\n42\n00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.200\nAnd let's work together,\nessentially, to figure that out.\n\n43\n00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.040\nThe processing is unlawfully done, and\nthe data is subject opposes the erasure\n\n44\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.660\nof their data, and\nrequests restriction of their use instead.\n\n45\n00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.540\nSo instead of saying I\nwant you to remove it,\n\n46\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.010\nI'm going to restrict\nyour ability to use it.\n\n47\n00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.390\nThat is what we're saying\nif it's done unlawfully.\n\n48\n00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.120\nRemember we talked about lawful\nprocessing standards and requirements,\n\n49\n00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.670\nvery important to be aware of that.\n\n50\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.020\nThe controller no longer\nneeds the personal data for\n\n51\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.550\nthe purposes of the processing, item C.\n\n52\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.070\nBut they are required by the data subject\nfor the establishment exercise or\n\n53\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.250\ndefense of legal claims.\n\n54\n00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.620\nAgain, we said that the right to erasure\ndoes not apply for instance, right?\n\n55\n00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.850\nIn situations where we may\nendanger the public good.\n\n56\n00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.940\nOr we may seek to remove data but we\ncannot do that because the establishment\n\n57\n00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.680\nof the legal claim is\nresting on that data, and\n\n58\n00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.000\nas a result we cannot remove\nthat until that's satisfied.\n\n59\n00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.100\nSo the legitimation of that legal claim or\nthe defense of legal claim may have to\n\n60\n00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.530\nstay here, or the data may have\nto stay there rather as a result.\n\n61\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.390\nAnd or D, the data subject to subjected to\nprocessing pursuant to Article 21 we look\n\n62\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.320\nat Article 21, pending\nthe verification whether legitimate\n\n63\n00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.530\ngrounds of the controller override\nthose of the data subject.\n\n64\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.020\nRemember again, we stipulated that\nthere are certain situations where\n\n65\n00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.460\nthe controller may be able to\noverride the wish of the subject.\n\n66\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.100\nAgain for things like the public good,\nthe pursuance of statistical\n\n67\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.938\ndata gathering because of health statistic\nrequirements, defensive illegal claim.\n\n68\n00:03:26.938 --> 00:03:30.390\nThere are all these exceptions that\nessentially allow us to override the wish\n\n69\n00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.065\nof the subject for a very narrowly\ndefined purpose and period of time.\n\n70\n00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:37.015\nBut we have to play according to\nthose rules and be aware of them, so\n\n71\n00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:38.995\nwe do need to make sure\nwe are aware of that.\n\n72\n00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:42.965\nSo the data subject here,\nthere's some burden and responsibility.\n\n73\n00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:48.915\nWe as data subjects have to be clear on\nwhen we can go to the data processor or\n\n74\n00:03:48.915 --> 00:03:53.740\ncontroller and\nrequest that they go ahead and\n\n75\n00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.690\nessentially restrict\nprocessing in some way.\n\n76\n00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.410\nSo we have to educate ourselves in other\nwords, right, as data subjects and\n\n77\n00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.890\nunderstand this, but\nthe data subject is not the only party\n\n78\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.210\nthat has to be educated here,\nas we often say.\n\n79\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.760\nThe data controller and processor has to\nmake sure they're aware of the stand or\n\n80\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.840\nstandards as well and understand\nthe potentiality of the fact that the data\n\n81\n00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.100\nsubject may make this request, and\nif they do, under what circumstances.\n\n82\n00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.738\nSo item number 2, when processing has been\nrestricted under paragraph 1 the results\n\n83\n00:04:21.738 --> 00:04:26.121\nwe just talked about, such personal data\nshall, with the exception of storage,\n\n84\n00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:29.170\nonly be processed with the data\nsubject's consent or for\n\n85\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.663\nthe establishment, exercise or\ndefense of legal claims, or for\n\n86\n00:04:32.663 --> 00:04:35.356\nthe protection of rights\nof another individual.\n\n87\n00:04:35.356 --> 00:04:39.136\nAnd or for reasons of import to\nthe public interest, as we talked about.\n\n88\n00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:43.751\nAgain, stipulating that once we put\na freeze on this data, the only time we go\n\n89\n00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:48.153\ntouch without the consent and\nknowledge of the owner, the data subject,\n\n90\n00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:52.572\nis when we have to, as it says there,\nonly with the exception of storage.\n\n91\n00:04:52.572 --> 00:04:55.350\nMeaning that you put it in storage,\nyou have to maintain it in storage.\n\n92\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.910\nYou're backing it up, maybe you're doing\na sample restore to validate data,\n\n93\n00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:59.790\nthings like that.\n\n94\n00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.660\nYou may inadvertently play\nwith this data to do that.\n\n95\n00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.270\nThat's okay, you're not\npurposely setting out to use it.\n\n96\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.500\nIt's just part of the normal\noperation of the system.\n\n97\n00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.670\nThat's interpretative here and\nthat's okay.\n\n98\n00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.870\nBut in addition, anything that's required\nto satisfy the public good, public safety,\n\n99\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.100\nand or the defense of a legal claim,\nwill meet with an exception here.\n\n100\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.410\nAnd the data subject's essentially\ngonna have to opt in and say,\n\n101\n00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.920\nyeah I guess you can use the data\nbecause of these reasons.\n\n102\n00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.780\nSo for instance, we're a cloud service\nprovider, an internet service provider.\n\n103\n00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.000\nThe customer comes to us and\n\n104\n00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.510\nsays hey, right to restrict processing,\nstop processing my data.\n\n105\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.590\nAnd we freeze the data.\n\n106\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.320\nAnd then we get sued by another customer.\n\n107\n00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.160\nAnd through discovery, this customer's\ndata along with the customer's data that\n\n108\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.750\nwas frozen, becomes part of a discovery\norder that goes back to the court.\n\n109\n00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.940\nWell that data has to be given to\nthe court under the discovery,\n\n110\n00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.430\nthe discovery process.\n\n111\n00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.530\nWe have to notify the data subject cuz\nwe do have that requirement, we have\n\n112\n00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.670\nto notify them unless the court tells us\nwe're not allowed to through a discovery,\n\n113\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.900\nwhich they may do depending\non the circumstances.\n\n114\n00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.330\nBut assuming the court doesn't\nspecify that we cannot notify parties\n\n115\n00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.750\ndiscovery through the discovery motion, we\nhave to notify the data subject their data\n\n116\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.000\nis now in the hands of the court because\nof the defense of a legal claim and\n\n117\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.020\nwe do have that responsibility.\n\n118\n00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.060\nBut the data subject, while they may go\nto the court and seek judicial remedy\n\n119\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.280\nto have their data removed from the broad\ndiscovery net that was cast by the court\n\n120\n00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.232\ninitially, and if they can prove\njust cause, they may be able to.\n\n121\n00:06:26.232 --> 00:06:28.330\nIf they're not party to the suit,\n\n122\n00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.970\nif they just happen to be in\nthe wrong place at the wrong time,\n\n123\n00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.720\non the wrong server, but were not involved\nwith any of the activities that, maybe,\n\n124\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.400\nthe lawsuit is speaking to, they may be\nable to seek to have their data removed.\n\n125\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.910\nBut unless they are successful, their\ndata sits as part of that dataset and\n\n126\n00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.870\nis discoverable and as a result is\nusable in a court to defend the claim or\n\n127\n00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.590\nto prove that it is not founded.\n\n128\n00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.900\nBut either way, the request to restrict\nprocessing is not honored as a result.\n\n129\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.470\nSo we do need to be aware of that and\njust understand the logic of that.\n\n130\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.510\nAlso data subject to\nobtain restrictions and\n\n131\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.610\nprocessing pursuant to paragraph one,\nitem number three there,\n\n132\n00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.170\nshall be informed by the controller before\nthe restriction of processing is lifted.\n\n133\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.160\nAs I said, we have a responsibility\nto tell the data subject\n\n134\n00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.830\nthat we've done something with the data.\n\n135\n00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.100\nBut remember the court may come in and\ntrump that,\n\n136\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.390\nas I suggested, during the discovery,\ndepending on the nature of the case, there\n\n137\n00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.770\nare gag orders that may be issued and you\nmay not be able to tell subjects in these\n\n138\n00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.390\nkinds of environments that their data has\nbeen hauled into court as being examined.\n\n139\n00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.760\nBecause you may be restricted\nfrom doing so by the court.\n\n140\n00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.040\nBecause of national security reasons or\nother reasons.\n\n141\n00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.710\nThere's a whole litany of things\nthat may go on there these days.\n\n142\n00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.690\nWe do just need to be aware of that and\nmake sure that we are thinking about that.\n\n143\n00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.870\nAnd that we do have this responsibility\nto inform that data subject.\n\n144\n00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.990\nBut that we may not always\nbe able to act on that.\n\n145\n00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.170\nKind of a little turn or twist,\nif you will, that goes on there.\n\n146\n00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.119\nAny questions?\n\n147\n00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:53.104\n&gt;&gt; No, that's a lot, but\nit's definitely a deep dive here.\n\n148\n00:07:53.104 --> 00:07:56.137\nAnd that's what we were looking to do\nin our episode lit, so thank you for\n\n149\n00:07:56.137 --> 00:07:57.440\nthat, Adam.\n\n150\n00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.070\nDo you have any final thoughts or\nanything you'd like to add to that?\n\n151\n00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.273\n&gt;&gt; No, I think we're good for that.\n\n152\n00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:04.291\nWhen we're gonna come back and\ntalk about the right to data portability,\n\n153\n00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:06.393\njust continuing down our\nlist of the next episode.\n\n154\n00:08:06.393 --> 00:08:10.014\nSo let's invite you to come back and take\na listen and look to that with us, and\n\n155\n00:08:10.014 --> 00:08:13.079\nthen we'll be wrapping up, I think,\nwith the right to object and\n\n156\n00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:16.024\nthen ultimately the rights\naround automated provisioning.\n\n157\n00:08:16.024 --> 00:08:19.830\nSo we got one, two, three more,\nwe're gonna talk about going forward.\n\n158\n00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.780\nBut we'll wrap those up in short order, so\nplease come back and join us for one or\n\n159\n00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.460\nmore of those.\n\n160\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.540\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, I don't object to that, so\nwe'll go ahead and sign out for this show.\n\n161\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.870\nI'm sure you guys are sick\nof my little jokes [LAUGH].\n\n162\n00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.500\nI've been your host Cherokee Boost.\n\n163\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.480\n&gt;&gt; We never get sick of you Cherokee.\n\n164\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.860\nI'm Adam Gordon.\n\n165\n00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.613\n&gt;&gt; See you next time\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n166\n00:08:39.613 --> 00:08:45.351\n[MUSIC]\n\n167\n00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:48.210\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",
