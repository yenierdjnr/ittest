          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,072\n[SOUND] Welcome everybody to our\n\n2\n00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:11,906\ndigital forensic investigator series.\n\n3\n00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:13,901\nI'm Mike Rodrick and with me today is Mr.\n\n4\n00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:17,606\nSean Oriyano, and we wanna give you\na heads up on what we're gonna be covering\n\n5\n00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:20,230\nin our digital forensic\ninvestigator series.\n\n6\n00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,330\nAnd probably, Sean, the first thing we\nneed to talk about is who the heck is\n\n7\n00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,762\na digital forensic investigator?\n\n8\n00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:28,622\nWho's gonna be interested in taking or\nwatching these episodes?\n\n9\n00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:29,493\n>> That's a great question.\n\n10\n00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:32,043\nBecause we wanna really kinda\npin down who the audience is and\n\n11\n00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:34,240\ntalk about what a forensic\ninvestigator is.\n\n12\n00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,110\nSo, briefly, a forensic investigator is\ngonna be someone who's doing corporate or\n\n13\n00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,360\ncriminal investigations, collecting,\npreserving and analyzing evidence, and\n\n14\n00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,650\ngetting it ready to be presented in court,\nif need be.\n\n15\n00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,600\nThey may be presenting it or someone\nelse may be presenting it, who will\n\n16\n00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,690\nserve as the expert witness, but either\nway, it's gonna kind of address that.\n\n17\n00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,210\nYou are gonna be running processes,\nprocedures for one of those two areas.\n\n18\n00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,635\n>> So, we're gonna be like\nCSI in the digital world,\n\n19\n00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:03,310\nthat's what you're telling me.\n\n20\n00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,755\nWe're gonna be going out there and\ninvestigating these crime scenes, where\n\n21\n00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:10,359\npeople have used computers to make some\nkind of attack against other computers or\n\n22\n00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,320\nto forge something or something like that.\n\n23\n00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,189\nAnd it's gonna be up to us, the digital\nforensic investigator to capture that\n\n24\n00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:20,055\ninformation, find all that evidence\nthey've done so much to try to hide, and\n\n25\n00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:22,714\nthen bring it into court and\nprosecute those people.\n\n26\n00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:26,172\n>> Yeah, once we get into the real\nmeat of this whole thing,\n\n27\n00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:31,210\nyou'll see how varied the crime is that\nyou could be expected to investigate.\n\n28\n00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,820\nIt could be denial of service type stuff,\nit could actually be terrorism,\n\n29\n00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,850\nit could be something as mundane, maybe,\n\n30\n00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,820\nas violating corporate policy,\nit could be someone creating malware.\n\n31\n00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,060\nForensics, for example,\n\n32\n00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,890\nplayed a big role in catching the author\nof the Melissa virus years ago.\n\n33\n00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,653\nThat was a big part of that, so there's\nsome big cases that have this has played\n\n34\n00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:53,204\na big role in, and there's a whole\nbunch of other ones behind the scenes.\n\n35\n00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:57,120\nBut, this is a really exciting and\ndeveloping field, kind of being able to\n\n36\n00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,015\nlift the lid and peek in, and\nsee what's hidden underneath the surface.\n\n37\n00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:01,650\n>> Heck, yeah.\n\n38\n00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,000\nThis is the cool part of security.\n\n39\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,300\nSo, in our course, we're going\nto cover a gamut of information.\n\n40\n00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,520\nAll the way from going to the crime scene,\ncollecting the evidence,\n\n41\n00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,480\npreserving the evidence,\nprocessing that evidence.\n\n42\n00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,090\nAnd then, turn it into some kind of\ndeliverable, that we can take in the end,\n\n43\n00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,655\neither us or whoever has to go to court.\n\n44\n00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:25,117\nSo, what kind of information are we\ngonna learn watching these episodes?\n\n45\n00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:28,145\n>> We've got tons for you in this course.\n\n46\n00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:30,535\nWe'll be learning technical information,\n\n47\n00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:33,570\nprobably deeper technical\ninformation than you've had before.\n\n48\n00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,800\nWe'll be doing some things that you\nprobably didn't think were possible,\n\n49\n00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,320\njust to recover evidence.\n\n50\n00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,980\nWe'll figure those ones out.\n\n51\n00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,520\nWe'll be doing that in the hardware,\nwe'll be doing that in software.\n\n52\n00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,280\nThen, we'll be figuring out,\nonce we learn those procedures,\n\n53\n00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,820\nalso be talking about\nhow you can collect it.\n\n54\n00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,650\nCuz you just can't go through and scoop\nsomething up and say here, it's evidence.\n\n55\n00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,470\nIt has to be collected a certain way.\n\n56\n00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,620\nAnd has to be documented a certain way.\n\n57\n00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,610\nAnd then,\nwhen we put that on the table and\n\n58\n00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,760\nwe sprinkle some other stuff on\ntop of it which has to go there,\n\n59\n00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,590\nthat's the legal procedures which may not\nbe the most exciting things, granted.\n\n60\n00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,210\nBut it's something that you\ndo have to also address.\n\n61\n00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,710\nSomething like federal rules of evidence,\nand local and\n\n62\n00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,598\nstate laws wherever possible.\n\n63\n00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't worry we're not going to turn you\n\n64\n00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,772\ninto a lawyer.\n\n65\n00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:18,606\nBut there's gonna be a lot of\nneat stuff here to cover and\n\n66\n00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:20,850\nsome stuff that you'll find interesting.\n\n67\n00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,011\nWarrants, stuff like that.\n\n68\n00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:23,830\n>> It really is fascinating.\n\n69\n00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,290\nAnd it's extremely important.\n\n70\n00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,080\nBecause when we talk about cyber crimes,\nor if somebody is doing something illegal\n\n71\n00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,860\nusing computers, as you said, we wanna\nbe able to prosecute them in the end.\n\n72\n00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,160\nThat's the whole goal.\n\n73\n00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,120\nAnd I can't just go in there blindly,\nlike you said, and go, oh,\n\n74\n00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,950\nhere's their computer.\n\n75\n00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,960\nAnd I'm gonna start opening up Windows and\n\n76\n00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,780\nlooking at log files and searching their\nhard drive for files and things like that.\n\n77\n00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,125\nAnd at that point,\nI have pretty much ruined everything, and\n\n78\n00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,530\nwe're probably never gonna be\nable to prosecute that person.\n\n79\n00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,100\n>> Here, let me just kind of build on\nsomething he said here and kinda show you.\n\n80\n00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,803\nOne of the things that, it's not to\npick on you or anything about it.\n\n81\n00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:00,870\n>> It's okay, you can pick on me.\n\n82\n00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,438\n>> I'm going to pick on him.\n\n83\n00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we got two weeks of that.\n\n84\n00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,580\n>> It's a good thing I\ngot thick skin [LAUGH].\n\n85\n00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,200\n>> So,\nwe're just going to work up from here.\n\n86\n00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,730\nBut one of the things that is a common\nthing to think about forensics\n\n87\n00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,130\nwhich we're gonna learn differently is\nyou may not take it to actual court,\n\n88\n00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,200\nyou may not be prosecuting someone.\n\n89\n00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,020\nYou may actually be working\ninside a corporation that may be\n\n90\n00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,000\ncollecting evidence because they need to\nsay, hey, this person violated policy,\n\n91\n00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,510\nwe've got the paperwork to back it up and\nyou're outta here.\n\n92\n00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,290\nAnd maybe, just for that, but\nit doesn't mean because you're\n\n93\n00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,520\njust letting someone go out of a company\ndoesn't mean there's a lesser standard.\n\n94\n00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,210\nThat person that you let go could say,\nwell, heck with you, I didn't do that,\n\n95\n00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,240\nI'm gonna sue you.\n\n96\n00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,280\nNow, you're going to court.\n\n97\n00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,660\nSo, you still have to collect it,\nand along the same lines but\n\n98\n00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,510\nyou may not be prosecuting it.\n\n99\n00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,040\n>> Gotcha.\n>> Just to kind of give you a peek of some\n\n100\n00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,090\nof the things that might actually\nchange your way of thinking.\n\n101\n00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,555\n>> And\nthat's why we've got the expert here.\n\n102\n00:04:58,555 --> 00:04:59,483\n[LAUGH]\n>> Bam!\n\n103\n00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:00,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n104\n00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,539\nSean we've got a bunch\nof great information,\n\n105\n00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,870\nwe're gonna be going\nover in these episodes.\n\n106\n00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,910\nIn the end,\nwe might wanna get certified as well.\n\n107\n00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,730\nWe might wanna be able to prove what we\nknow so that we can go out and get a job,\n\n108\n00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,350\nif we're not already employed.\n\n109\n00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,720\nMaybe, we wanna go get a job or\nmaybe you wanna change fields and\n\n110\n00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,705\nget into this really exciting forensic\ninvestigator's type lifestyle.\n\n111\n00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:23,165\nSo, there's a couple certifications\nwe might be able to obtain with\n\n112\n00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:25,825\na little setting and\nwatching these episodes.\n\n113\n00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,475\n>> Yes, there are a couple of\ncertifications that really just kind of\n\n114\n00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,865\njump out at you,\n\n115\n00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:33,530\nbecause there's a whole kind of a sea\nof forensic certifications really.\n\n116\n00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,955\nThere are different specialties and\nall it in there.\n\n117\n00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:39,940\nBut the two that come to mind for\ntaking this particular course\n\n118\n00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,510\nare EC-Council Computer Hacking\nForensic Investigator and then,\n\n119\n00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,070\nthere's also ISC squared,\nthe people that do the CISSP.\n\n120\n00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,464\nThey also have one called CCFP, which\nis some alphabet soup which stands for,\n\n121\n00:05:52,464 --> 00:05:54,137\nputting Mike on the spot now.\n\n122\n00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:56,996\n>> Certified Cyber Forensic Professional.\n\n123\n00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:59,480\nCertified Cyber Forensic Professional.\n\n124\n00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,310\nIf I can say that one word.\n\n125\n00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,680\nSo, yeah,\na couple of great certifications.\n\n126\n00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,520\nThink that,\nyou can watch these episodes and\n\n127\n00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520\nyou could walk out of here\nwith two certifications.\n\n128\n00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,060\nMany letters to put behind your name.\n\n129\n00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,940\nI've got some information pulled up here\non my screen, if we wanna look at it.\n\n130\n00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:18,425\nThe EC Council, again, puts on the\nComputer Hacking Forensic Investigator.\n\n131\n00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:22,722\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's their exam number, 312-49.\n\n132\n00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:25,393\nThey're currently on\nversion 8 of that exam.\n\n133\n00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:29,900\nAnd you can see here on my screen, it's\ngonna be a test of about 150 questions.\n\n134\n00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,310\nIt's primarily multiple choice and\nyou're gonna need to get a 70% or\n\n135\n00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,672\ngreater to pass that exam and\nget that certification.\n\n136\n00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:38,970\nThey're gonna give you four\nhours to take that exam.\n\n137\n00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,702\nSo, plenty of time to get through there.\n\n138\n00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:44,240\nAnd there's several different vendors\nyou can go through to take that exam.\n\n139\n00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,380\nYou've got Prometric Prime,\nwhich is there online.\n\n140\n00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,420\nSo, if I don't have an authorized testing\ncenter, I might be able to take it through\n\n141\n00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,930\nPrometric Prime, where I've got just,\nwhat do you call it, proctor.\n\n142\n00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,370\nSomebody that's gonna proctor the exam,\nand I can take it on any computer.\n\n143\n00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,720\nThey also offer it, of course,\nthrough their authorized test centers.\n\n144\n00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,630\nWith the Prometric test\ncenters as well as VUE, so\n\n145\n00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,650\nif the test center in your area is Pearson\nVUE, you can take it through there.\n\n146\n00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,530\nThe cost for the exam is a little steep.\n\n147\n00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,996\nIt's gonna be $500 for that exam,\n\n148\n00:07:13,996 --> 00:07:18,080\nplus you're gonna have to\npay a $100 application fee.\n\n149\n00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,360\nSo, once you're ready, you've studied,\n\n150\n00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,760\nyou've got the information you need,\nyou go to EC Council's website,\n\n151\n00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,859\nyou fill out an application,\nyou send them in 100 bucks,\n\n152\n00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:32,060\nthey're gonna send you back a voucher that\nyou can then go use and take that exam.\n\n153\n00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,240\nSo, that's the EC council,\n\n154\n00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,710\nthat's the computer hacking forensic\ninvestigator certification.\n\n155\n00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,700\nAlso, you might be interested\nin taking the ISC squared exam\n\n156\n00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,550\nwhich is their brand new one,\nthe Certified Cyber Forensic Professional.\n\n157\n00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,390\nVery similar,\nas far as the test breakdown goes.\n\n158\n00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,400\nAnother four hours for that exam,\nabout 125 questions on this one.\n\n159\n00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,060\nAgain, multiple choice type questions.\n\n160\n00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,220\nYou need to get a 700 or a 70% out\nof 1000 points to pass that exam.\n\n161\n00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,140\nAnd what else?\n\n162\n00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,612\nOh, the cost for that one is $549.\n\n163\n00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:06,438\nSo, you can see, there pretty comparable.\n\n164\n00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:08,900\n>> Imagine, two four hour exams.\n\n165\n00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,020\n>> I know, you can spend all day.\n\n166\n00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,360\n>> Get the kids a baby sitter.\n\n167\n00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,912\nYou're gonna be busy.\n\n168\n00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:15,020\n>> [LAUGH] You can definitely\nspend all day in that booth, so\n\n169\n00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,150\nyou might wanna break that up to\nseparate days if you're gonna do it.\n\n170\n00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,180\nOr heck, go all for it.\n\n171\n00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,590\nGet in there and take them both.\n\n172\n00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,230\n>> No, don't do that.\n\n173\n00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,350\n>> Don't do that,\nI'm just kidding with you.\n\n174\n00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,430\nSo, ladies and gentlemen,\nI hope you guys are as excited as we are.\n\n175\n00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,635\nStay tuned, we've got our digital forensic\ninvestigator series coming your way.\n\n176\n00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:37,334\n[SOUND]\n\n",

Easily. Yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,046\nJust like putting flames\non the car makes it faster.\n\n36\n00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:52,140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Forensics has a\n\n37\n00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,470\n>> But as a science it's pretty long lag.\n\n38\n00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,440\nCuz it's been around for quite a while.\n\n39\n00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,900\nMost people they think of forensics they\nthink of stuff like you're getting blood\n\n40\n00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,020\nfrom crime scenes and bodies, and\nwhat have you, stuff like that.\n\n41\n00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,130\nThen you have things like forensic\naccounting, and forensic this and\n\n42\n00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,490\nforensic that.\n\n43\n00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,650\nSo we have various things.\n\n44\n00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,320\nIt wasn't till about the last 50,\n60 years,\n\n45\n00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,330\nmaybe a little bit longer,\nthat we started getting digital forensics.\n\n46\n00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,000\nAnd that's kind of a tricky term, digital.\n\n47\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,110\nIf you think digital, it sounds like well\nwe are talking digital computers right.\n\n48\n00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,760\n>> Right.\n>> You remember those venn\n\n49\n00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,720\ndiagram they have.\n\n50\n00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,950\nWhere it's like a circle here and\na circle inside of it.\n\n51\n00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,150\nI think it's a venn diagram.\n\n52\n00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,090\nIf not just play along.\n\n53\n00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,930\n[LAUGH] What you have is\nyou have digital forensics,\n\n54\n00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,650\nwhich covers a much broader\narea than computer forensics.\n\n55\n00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,520\nSo we're, for the most part, talking\nspecifically about computer forensics,\n\n56\n00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,910\nfocusing on networks and the host systems.\n\n57\n00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,640\nWe're not focusing on a much\nlarger area of digital forensics.\n\n58\n00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,040\nThere will be some times\nwe kind of touch on it, but\n\n59\n00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,600\nit's not going to be covering\nthat field as a whole.\n\n60\n00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,340\nSo just so we can kind of put\nit in the proper context.\n\n61\n00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,030\n>> Okay.\nVery good.\n\n62\n00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,710\nSo we're going to be focusing in primarily\non dealing with computers and networks.\n\n63\n00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,150\nGoing in and figuring out, after somebody\nhad perpetrated some kind of crime,\n\n64\n00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,600\ngoing in there and trying to recover\nevidence that we might use against them,\n\n65\n00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,550\neither in a court of law or\njust in a corporate environment.\n\n66\n00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,190\nWe're trying to make sure that\nwe've got our bases covered.\n\n67\n00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,750\nWhen we need to let somebody go.\n\n68\n00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,630\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and there could be\nseveral places where you use forensics in.\n\n69\n00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,340\nForensics just is a process\nof uncovering the truth.\n\n70\n00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,340\nWe're not necessarily going to say we're\ngoing to use it to prove a case or\n\n71\n00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,490\nto go against a case.\n\n72\n00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,970\nWe can be doing either.\n\n73\n00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,130\nWe're just finding out what\nthe truth is of the matter and\n\n74\n00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,990\nwe're doing it objectively.\n\n75\n00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,680\nDoing the documentation,\nfollowing the numbers and then just and\n\n76\n00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,190\ntaking everything in to\nwhoever needs to present it or\n\n77\n00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,680\nanalyze it, and\nfigure out if we need to go further.\n\n78\n00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,460\nNow when you look at forensics,\nthere's just so\n\n79\n00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,140\nmany details in there It's not\nsomething that's for everybody.\n\n80\n00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,090\nIf you're not someone\nthat's detail-oriented,\n\n81\n00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,890\nyou're not someone that's very patient and\nwilling to be very meticulous.\n\n82\n00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:29,450\nIf you don't like a good mystery,\nthen this may not\n\n83\n00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,540\nbe entirely a field for you go into,\nbut before you kind say oh,\n\n84\n00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,490\nwell that's not me,\ngo through the course and take a look.\n\n85\n00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,140\nThere's a lot of neat stuff that'll\nprobably open your eyes and\n\n86\n00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,120\nget really excited.\n\n87\n00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,770\nThere's a lot of people that\nhave gotten into this field\n\n88\n00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,410\nbecause there was that one thing\nthat they were asked to do at work.\n\n89\n00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,450\nThere was, I've heard individuals\nhad to trace an email, single email.\n\n90\n00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,795\nGot him into it.\n\n91\n00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,024\nOr they read a book about something.\n\n92\n00:04:57,024 --> 00:04:59,710\nAnd it opened up to something big.\n\n93\n00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,510\nI mean and there's one that\nreferenced in many places is, and\n\n94\n00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,770\nyou can get a book on it\ncalled The Cuckoo's Egg.\n\n95\n00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,580\nWhere a person found a few\ncents error on a phone bill.\n\n96\n00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,910\nAnd that lead to, I believe, uncovering\na huge Cold War national security thing.\n\n97\n00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,930\n>> Wow.\n>> Yeah, you can get it.\n\n98\n00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,580\nIt's just like what,\nwhat just happened there?\n\n99\n00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,430\nSo, yeah, it's pretty amazing.\n\n100\n00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,940\nReally.\n>> So you're saying we might get\n\n101\n00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,660\nthe bug, right?\n\n102\n00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,140\nWe might get bitten by\nthe forensic investigator bug.\n\n103\n00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,260\nAnd I think most people will, honestly.\n\n104\n00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,220\nI mean we're all geeks here.\n\n105\n00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,400\nThat's why we're here.\n\n106\n00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,720\nWe wanna learn about computers and\n\n107\n00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,890\nwe especially wanna learn about\nthe forensic investigator process.\n\n108\n00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,070\nAnd Sean's right.\n\n109\n00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,700\nOnce you drive into this stuff,\nonce you start getting in there,\n\n110\n00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,540\nit is a fascinating world and\nthere's just so much you can do, and\n\n111\n00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,430\nit's something that, is not something\nwe see everyday, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,100\nThis is a side of things that\nmost people don't deal with.\n\n113\n00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,860\nMost people deal with computers to\nperform their job or do whatever.\n\n114\n00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,820\nNow we're gonna take a look at\nwhat's going on behind, and\n\n115\n00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,430\nwhat the traces they leave,\nand things like that.\n\n116\n00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,810\nAnd I really did like your point too,\n\n117\n00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,040\nyou made earlier, remember this is\nalways about prosecuting the bad guy.\n\n118\n00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,920\nIt could very well be\nproving somebody innocent.\n\n119\n00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,890\nWhen we're talking about investigating, a\nbasic concept we have to remember is that,\n\n120\n00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,290\nwe're not trying to prove anything,\nwe're trying to discover the truth.\n\n121\n00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,970\nThat truth could prove\nthat someone's guilty or\n\n122\n00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,410\njust as well,\nproving somebody is innocent.\n\n123\n00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,870\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n124\n00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,200\nThe evidence that you collect and\nthe processes you go through,\n\n125\n00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,540\ncan be provided both to\nthe person you're working for.\n\n126\n00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,990\nIf you go to a court scenario, it could be\nprovided to the person you're working for,\n\n127\n00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,850\nbut it also could be provided\nto the opposing lawyers.\n\n128\n00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:46,300\nThey can request what you provided\non your site so they can analyze it.\n\n129\n00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,480\nSo, it may not be, actually,\nyou may have been contracted or brought in\n\n130\n00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,070\nto help support your sides,\nyour sides, part of the story.\n\n131\n00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,330\nAnd you may uncover the truth and\n\n132\n00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,610\nfind out that actually crashes the whole\ncase and kills it right there.\n\n133\n00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,310\nAnd it has happened,\nit definitely has happened.\n\n134\n00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,780\n>> We could be working for the prosecutor.\n\n135\n00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,770\nWe could just as well find\nourselves working for the defense.\n\n136\n00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,460\nWe're working for that employee that's\ntrying to maintain their innocence and\n\n137\n00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,740\nprove that they shouldn't be\nterminated from a company or\n\n138\n00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,940\nthat they've been set up or\nsomething like that.\n\n139\n00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,000\nDon't want you guys to think it's always\nabout trying to prove somebody's guilt or\n\n140\n00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,590\nanything like that.\n\n141\n00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,130\nWe have to have an open mind\nwhen we go into this and\n\n142\n00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,070\nwe have to be able to look\nat it from all angles and\n\n143\n00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,210\nnot have any kind of preconceptions\nof guilt or innocence.\n\n144\n00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,330\nIt's a very part of that\ninvestigative process.\n\n145\n00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,290\nForensic science has been around for\na while.\n\n146\n00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,384\nWe're gonna drag it into\nthe digital age and\n\n147\n00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:45,072\nwe're gonna take a look closely at\ncomputers and networks, specifically.\n\n148\n00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:50,830\nAnd talk about how we can do forensic\ninvestigations in that digital world.\n\n149\n00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,408\nSo, who is this forensic technician?\n\n150\n00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:55,045\nWho is this person?\n\n151\n00:07:55,045 --> 00:07:57,548\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n152\n00:07:57,548 --> 00:07:59,550\n>> Any questions?\nYou'll be tested.\n\n153\n00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,210\n>> There we go.\n\n154\n00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,631\n[LAUGH]\n>> So in the exam,\n\n155\n00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:05,595\nwe're gonna give you a multiple-Choice\nquestion, and one of the answer is gonna\n\n156\n00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:09,516\nbe a picture Shawn Oriano in a lab coat,\nand make sure you get that one right guys.\n\n157\n00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:14,712\n>> As Leo Laporte said,\nI'm the guy [LAUGH] Any case,\n\n158\n00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:18,330\nwho's a forensic technician?\n\n159\n00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,394\nWell, just to reiterate some of the things\nthat we were talking about here is,\n\n160\n00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:25,677\nit's gonna be someone that's\ngot a good technical aptitude.\n\n161\n00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:29,285\nSomeone that knows hardware and software.\n\n162\n00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:32,735\nAnd we're talking way\nbeyond just normal stuff.\n\n163\n00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:34,362\nIt's not like, oh look,\nit's a computer, and\n\n164\n00:08:34,362 --> 00:08:35,721\nthere's a hard drive in it and all that.\n\n165\n00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:38,615\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a lot different than that.\n\n166\n00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:43,383\nYou've got to understand, for\nexample, a really good example that\n\n167\n00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:47,904\nwe're gonna investigate a little\nfurther here down the line is,\n\n168\n00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:52,752\nthat hard drive that you have in\nthat computer, it's fine if you, for\n\n169\n00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:56,858\nthe most part, if you're just\nan IT person and you say, and\n\n170\n00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:59,851\nI don't mean that in a derogatory person.\n\n171\n00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:02,619\nIf you're an IT person saying\nthat you have a hard drive and\n\n172\n00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,610\nthen you're storing information on it.\n\n173\n00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,230\nThat's fine.\n\n174\n00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,130\nThat's all well and\n\n175\n00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,500\ngood, how much space does it have and\nwe don't need to worry about anything.\n\n176\n00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,960\nMaybe you'll worry about some details but\n\n177\n00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,320\nyou don't have to get\nmuch more beyond that.\n\n178\n00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,120\nFor us, we have to know,\nfor example, if that's\n\n179\n00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,060\na traditional drive with a platter in it,\nif it's a solid state drive.\n\n180\n00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,210\nJust those two things right there,\ncan ruin your day if your versus one over\n\n181\n00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,500\nthe other, because that will impact\ndramatically your investigative process.\n\n182\n00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,390\nThen you have to worry if it's encrypted.\n\n183\n00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,740\nMost people won't have to\nworry about that necessarily.\n\n184\n00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,340\nOnce it's encrypted it's transparent.\n\n185\n00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,260\nYou have to worry about that.\n\n186\n00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:48,800\nThen we bring in things like,\nwe bring in things such as, RAID systems.\n\n187\n00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,690\nAnd there's not just one flavor of RAID,\nfor\n\n188\n00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,990\nthose of you that have\nbeen down that road.\n\n189\n00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,510\nThere's not just one flavor of that.\n\n190\n00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,050\nSo there's many flavors\nof the month on that.\n\n191\n00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,020\nAnd then we can go one step further.\n\n192\n00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,760\nThey may not even be storing\nstuff in the hard drive,\n\n193\n00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,460\nit may be out in the cloud some place.\n\n194\n00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,558\nThat's a whole nother level on that.\n\n195\n00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:07,922\nSo you're gonna have to be really\nfamiliar with your things, and\n\n196\n00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:10,809\nyou're gonna have to be willing\nto work on a team, too.\n\n197\n00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:12,817\nCuz you can't know it all, you can't.\n\n198\n00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:16,478\nWe're gonna go over a whole\nton of stuff in here.\n\n199\n00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:22,310\nBut in practice,\nyou're gonna focus on a specific area.\n\n200\n00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,750\nIf Mike and I were a team,\none of us might focus,\n\n201\n00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,220\none of us will focus on a specific area,\nthe other one will focus on another one.\n\n202\n00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,800\nWe will work together to get the\nresolution to whatever that process is.\n\n203\n00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,940\n>> So you might develop\na team of experts that have\n\n204\n00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,070\nexpertise in different areas\nof the investigation or\n\n205\n00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,590\ndifferent technologies that\nthey're gonna be investigating and\n\n206\n00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:47,320\ntie all that together to actually\nperform the forensic investigation.\n\n207\n00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,220\n>> Yeah, forensic technician has to know\nthose things, has to understand the laws\n\n208\n00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,825\ninvolved, has to understand that\nthere is a specific procedure,\n\n209\n00:10:55,825 --> 00:11:00,885\nthere have been in the past cases\nlost because someone said, oh,\n\n210\n00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:04,115\nwell heck,\nthat computer's part of evidence,\n\n211\n00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:08,640\njust turn it of and\nshut it down, and take it.\n\n212\n00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,329\nThat's a case killer right there.\n\n213\n00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:13,300\n>> Yeah.\n\n214\n00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,270\n>> First of all, there's a certain\nway to shut down a computer,\n\n215\n00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,460\na certain way to approach a crime scene.\n\n216\n00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,160\nThere's certain ways you have to\ncollect that evidence, preserve it.\n\n217\n00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,110\nAny one of those things\nyou screw up big enough,\n\n218\n00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,690\nand that case is just down the tubes.\n\n219\n00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,910\n>> Yeah, we've probably all watched a few\nepisodes of some of our great TV shows,\n\n220\n00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,700\nCSI and Law & Order and things like that.\n\n221\n00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,380\nSo you might have an understanding, or\n\n222\n00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,780\na basic concept, of that chain\nof custody and things like that.\n\n223\n00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,880\nAnd we're gonna dive into all of\nthese topics in later episodes so\n\n224\n00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800\nmake sure you stayed tuned for those.\n\n225\n00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,580\nSo Sean, when we talk about cyber crime,\nlet's first I guess define\n\n226\n00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,250\ncomputer forensics again,\njust to make sure we've got that.\n\n227\n00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,640\nWhen we talk about computer forensics,\nwe're talking about examining\n\n228\n00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,725\nthe computers and the networks and trying\nto find evidence either supporting or\n\n229\n00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:02,755\ncontradicting some claim of a crime.\n\n230\n00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:06,275\n>> Yes, when you're doing forensics,\nit's actually, and\n\n231\n00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:10,145\nactually you can throw into the mix\nthere because I was kind of lax on\n\n232\n00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:13,830\nduly mentioning that before,\nIt's also mobile devices too.\n\n233\n00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:19,050\nAnd we will be talking about mobile device\nduring the run of this course because,\n\n234\n00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,217\nthey're there.\n\n235\n00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:20,744\nPeriod.\nDone.\n\n236\n00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:21,550\nRight?\n\n237\n00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,177\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, absolutely,\n\n238\n00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:26,206\nI mean we can't have a good discussion\nabout computer forensics without including\n\n239\n00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:28,760\nmobile devices because we all\nhave them we all use them.\n\n240\n00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,030\nAnd a surprising need of information we\ncan get from one of those mobile devices,\n\n241\n00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,350\ncuz people don't think about\nit as a computer sometimes.\n\n242\n00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,500\nThey forget that those things have memory,\nand they retain information and\n\n243\n00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,220\nthere's records of that\ninformation that we can get.\n\n244\n00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,173\nA whole another world in our\ndigital forensic investigator,\n\n245\n00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:48,700\nis that mobile device.\n\n246\n00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,930\nAnd we got a whole episode,\nthat we're gonna discuss that stuff, so\n\n247\n00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,700\nwe'll\n>> And you don't think about it.\n\n248\n00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,330\nHow many people do you know Mike that\nstore basically their whole lives on\n\n249\n00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:56,985\na mobile device?\n\n250\n00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,230\n>> Oh absolutely.\n\n251\n00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,150\nI've seen people just have\nincredible panic attacks\n\n252\n00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,030\nbecause they've lost their phone.\n\n253\n00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,070\nEither left it in a cab,\nleft it at a bar, something like that.\n\n254\n00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,640\nAnd their whole world is\nabout to crumble because\n\n255\n00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,470\nof all the stuff that\nthey've got on those phones.\n\n256\n00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,180\nSo definitely a big part of it.\n\n257\n00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,490\n>> Like someone called me a mad scientist.\n\n258\n00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,822\nYeah, I'm kinda melancholy.\n\n259\n00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:20,880\n>> [LAUGH] He doesn't\nseem too angry to me.\n\n260\n00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,310\nBut he's definitely playing\nthe mad scientist role here.\n\n261\n00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,590\nAll right, so\nlet's talk about on the exam,\n\n262\n00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,320\nthey're not gonna be super heavy on\nthe history of computer forensics.\n\n263\n00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,240\nBut we do need to have an idea of\nsome past cases or some milestones,\n\n264\n00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,230\nI guess,\nin the world of computer forensics.\n\n265\n00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,490\n>> Yes, you do, it's important to\nkind of understand some of these.\n\n266\n00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,050\nSome of these points along the way\nthat were significant to us.\n\n267\n00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,080\nAnd those come in the forms of crimes and\nthey also come in the forms\n\n268\n00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,390\nof ways of collecting evidence and\nways of interacting with the crime scene.\n\n269\n00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,604\nThere's, for example, fingerprints.\n\n270\n00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:05,240\nFingerprints, the technology for\nthat was in the early 1900's.\n\n271\n00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,545\nDNA evidence was a little\nbit later than that.\n\n272\n00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:14,133\nBut in heck, if you go back to,\nI believe it was, yeah, it was the French.\n\n273\n00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,780\nI forget the year but it's not important.\n\n274\n00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,410\nIt was the early 1900s, they came up\nwith something that's significant now,\n\n275\n00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,730\nis something called Locard's Principle.\n\n276\n00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:29,330\nAnd that's a principle, and heck they've\nactually quoted this on some CSI shows,\n\n277\n00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,540\nthey did get that right.\n\n278\n00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,840\nLocard's Principle says,\nis a principle that states that If\n\n279\n00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,030\nyou go into a crime scene, or\ninto a scene period, you are, even if\n\n280\n00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:48,410\nyou don't touch anything, you are leaving\na mark, you're leaving trace stuff there.\n\n281\n00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,620\nFor example, when I walked into\nthe studio this morning, and just if I\n\n282\n00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,780\ntook one step in the door and didn't touch\nanything, I am breathing Into the room.\n\n283\n00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,500\nI've got dust on my shoes or debris\non my shoes, whatever that might be.\n\n284\n00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,550\nThose are impacting that crime scene.\n\n285\n00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,520\nAnd why that was that, Locard's Principle\nwas developed back when we were\n\n286\n00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,330\ntalking about the forensic days\nof doing physical crime and\n\n287\n00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,350\nmurders and stuff like that,\nit still is very relevant now.\n\n288\n00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,320\nRemember, everything you do on that\nsystem to collect evidence is going to\n\n289\n00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,580\nhave an impact and you need to know that\nimpact, and that's one of the things we're\n\n290\n00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,710\ntalking about here for forensics,\nwhen we talk about that process.\n\n291\n00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:36,874\nThat process is critical because it's\ndesigned to get you through a certain\n\n292\n00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:41,725\nmethodology and process to make sure\nthat you minimize those impacts.\n\n293\n00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:43,810\nBecause you don't want to impact or\n\n294\n00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,925\nalter evidence in any way if you can\navoid it because that is your case.\n\n295\n00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:52,851\n>> Exactly, and that's really a key to\nforensics in general as you said Was\n\n296\n00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:57,940\nthe concept that you're always gonna\nleave some kind of trace, right.\n\n297\n00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,200\nEither you're gonna,\n\n298\n00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,350\nI think what he said was the criminal\nis gonna be leaving something.\n\n299\n00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,130\nHe's also gonna take something with him.\n\n300\n00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,285\nAnd And then the goal is\nto mash that back together,\n\n301\n00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:10,495\nright, to prove that somebody was there.\n\n302\n00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,255\nNot just that somebody was there, but,\nthat's the whole idea behind forensics.\n\n303\n00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:16,535\nIt's that principle.\n\n304\n00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:17,865\nIt really did start the whole thing.\n\n305\n00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:21,840\nAnd then we bring in the computer age, and\nthat same thing holds true as you said.\n\n306\n00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,620\nIf I log on to a machine,\nI'm leaving evidence.\n\n307\n00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,700\nIf I open a file, I'm modifying that file,\nthe last access date or what have you.\n\n308\n00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,440\nSo we're always leaving\nsome kind of trace.\n\n309\n00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,290\nAnd one of the things that we're gonna\nstress, and that we're gonna talk\n\n310\n00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,470\nabout in future episodes is how do\nI go about trying to minimize that.\n\n311\n00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,140\nBecause that's one of the things we've\ngotta do is if I'm gonna use this\n\n312\n00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,400\nevidence, to prosecute or defend somebody\n\n313\n00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,660\nI've gotta make sure that the other\nside can't say we'll you did that.\n\n314\n00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,050\nSo I've gotta make sure that I can prove\nthat I haven't modified anything or\n\n315\n00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,940\nintroduced any new trace\ninto that crime scene.\n\n316\n00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,485\n>> Yeah.\nThat is a huge, huge, huge part of this.\n\n317\n00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:02,390\nAnd and as Mike said,\n\n318\n00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,610\nit could, the criminal could be\ntaking something out of there.\n\n319\n00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,550\nNow if someone, let's say if Mike and\n\n320\n00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,580\nI are the investigators called\nto check out that crime scene,\n\n321\n00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,890\ndon't forget, it's us, as well,\nare making an impact on that crime scene.\n\n322\n00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,550\nIt's not just the criminal.\n\n323\n00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,620\nThat criminal did it with an intent,\nof stealing something or\n\n324\n00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,360\ncarrying out some action.\n\n325\n00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,860\nWe're coming to do the investigation,\nbut our actions leave stuff behind,\n\n326\n00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,110\nso we need to remember those.\n\n327\n00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,940\nPicking up something with your\nbare hands leaves marks on there.\n\n328\n00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,230\nTurning off a computer, a certain\nway will just obliterate evidence.\n\n329\n00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,410\nAll those things can work against you.\n\n330\n00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:49,410\nThat's why when I said earlier here,\nthat you need to know hardware and\n\n331\n00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,460\nsoftware, at a very intimate level.\n\n332\n00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,230\nWe want to understand cause and effect.\n\n333\n00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,140\nYou really really need to understand that,\nthe cold cause and effect and\n\n334\n00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,760\nbe willing to test things out and\ndo all that, and\n\n335\n00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,870\nunderstand what's happening\nprior to going in there.\n\n336\n00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,310\nIn fact, you'll see stuff\nlike the scientific method.\n\n337\n00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,435\nIf you remember that from school.\n\n338\n00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:10,370\nMm-hm, biology.\n\n339\n00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,508\n>> Yeah.\n>> Absolutely.\n\n340\n00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,230\n>> The hypothesis and come and\ntesting it, and checking the results,\n\n341\n00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,395\nand going back and around and all that.\n\n342\n00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,614\nThat's alive and\nwell in here in this course.\n\n343\n00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:20,251\n>> Absolutely.\n\n344\n00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,481\nAbsolutely.\n\n345\n00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:27,522\nSo, let's take a look as we really discuss\nwhat a forensic investigator is all about,\n\n346\n00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:30,760\nand what cyber or computer forensics is.\n\n347\n00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,220\nLet's take a look at some\nof those big famous cases,\n\n348\n00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:39,080\nsome of those cases in\nthe past that we've seen.\n\n349\n00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,590\nSo I've got a page here you recommend to\nme Shawn it's a forensicswiki.org, and\n\n350\n00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,290\nI'll post a link for\n\n351\n00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,970\nyou guys in the chat-room,\nI'll make sure I put it in the show-notes.\n\n352\n00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,804\nAnd so Shawn these are some of my famous\ncases involving, digital forensics.\n\n353\n00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:56,905\nSo, some examples of where digital\nforensics was used to either help or\n\n354\n00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,188\nhinder the case?\n\n355\n00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:01,586\n>> Yes, these are some,\nthese aren't the only ones, but\n\n356\n00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:05,580\nthese are some really kind\nof interesting milestones.\n\n357\n00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,640\nOr maybe not milestones, but\nmaybe things that, caught the news and\n\n358\n00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,700\ncaught the attention of the media.\n\n359\n00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,410\nIf you see on here, one of them was that,\nyou I were talking about,\n\n360\n00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,170\nthere's Dennis Rader, the bind,\ntorture, Kill serial killer.\n\n361\n00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,850\nIf I remember, does it say it there?\n\n362\n00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,610\n>> Found a deleted Microsoft Word file,\nand\n\n363\n00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,480\ninside the metadata it had the name Dennis\nas the last person that deleted the file\n\n364\n00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,290\nand linked to the Lutheran\nchurch where Rader was a deacon.\n\n365\n00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,990\n>> Yeah, remember that one?\n\n366\n00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,580\nThat guy actually,\nhe was doing that for years and\n\n367\n00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,070\neveryone knew him as, he was\nthe person they always say oh not him,\n\n368\n00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,920\nhe's always such a quiet guy,\nnever does any of those things.\n\n369\n00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,610\nYeah, a deacon in his church,\nno one actually ever realize that it was\n\n370\n00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:02,160\na slip-up that came about and\nthey caught him.\n\n371\n00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,820\nThe guy, I don't think they'd\nexecuted him; I may be wrong on that.\n\n372\n00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,280\nBut, yeah,\nhe was caught off of computer forensics.\n\n373\n00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,090\n>> I like that if you,\nif you guys can read that article though.\n\n374\n00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,670\nIt does say that, he actually sent the\nfloppy disk to the police because he had\n\n375\n00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,621\nbeen told, that there was no way\nthey could trace that back to him.\n\n376\n00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,258\n>> Oh yeah, I remember that.\n\n377\n00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,232\n>> Yeah,\nRader sent the floppy disk to the police,\n\n378\n00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:29,883\nbecause he had been previously told,\nby the police themselves,\n\n379\n00:20:29,883 --> 00:20:31,878\nthat letters on floppy\ndisk could not be traced.\n\n380\n00:20:31,878 --> 00:20:36,278\n[LAUGH] Silly Rader [LAUGH].\n\n381\n00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,350\n>> Brings back memories of CEH courses.\n\n382\n00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,850\nNo patch for stupidity.\n\n383\n00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,390\n>> That's right.\n\n384\n00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,970\nNo patch for stupidity, human stupidity.\n\n385\n00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,360\nAs you can see here, there's lots of cases\nhere that we could sit here and go over.\n\n386\n00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,240\nLike I said, I'll give you guys those\nlinks so you can read up on some of these.\n\n387\n00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,590\nAnother interesting one that I found\nout was the, where is it down here?\n\n388\n00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:59,060\nThis guy Brad Cooper, arrested for\nthe murder of his wife Nancy Cooper.\n\n389\n00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,120\nAnd what happened is the police were\ntrying to get information off of his phone\n\n390\n00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,330\nand they repeatedly tried to get in.\n\n391\n00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,550\nHe had it protected with a PIN,\nit was probably a little four digit PIN or\n\n392\n00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,270\nsomething like that and\n\n393\n00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,290\nthey thought they'd just try to guess it\nand eventually get into that information.\n\n394\n00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,850\nEnded up wiping the phone.\n\n395\n00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,840\nAnd so lost evidence,\ndestroyed all of that.\n\n396\n00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,960\nAnd then the problem was, that was\nevidence that could have been used.\n\n397\n00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,590\nAccording to the defense team,\nthere was evidence on that\n\n398\n00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,520\nphone that might have been\nused to prove his innocence.\n\n399\n00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,240\nAnd through sloppy\ninvestigation techniques,\n\n400\n00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,840\nnot following proper techniques\nof securing that data.\n\n401\n00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,389\nAnd making sure that we got copies of,\nand things like that.\n\n402\n00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:40,660\nThey ended up losing the data, and\nit couldn't be used in court at all for\n\n403\n00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,510\neither side.\n\n404\n00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:46,363\n>> Yeah, that's the procedure right\nthere biting you in the butt.\n\n405\n00:21:46,363 --> 00:21:49,662\nAgain, for you to go in and\npick up a cell phone, or\n\n406\n00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:54,691\nsomeone to pick up a cell phone and\nsay let's punch in stuff like the movies,\n\n407\n00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:59,250\nit always works on TV and the movies,\nand think that's gonna work and\n\n408\n00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,730\nhold water, that's ridiculous,\nthat really is.\n\n409\n00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,620\nAnybody that has that knowledge that I'm\ntalking about would sit there and go,\n\n410\n00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,335\nwell that's just stupid.\n\n411\n00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:13,359\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And maybe I'm gonna try some things,\n\n412\n00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,180\nbut I'm not gonna go ahead and just but\nit was hey close my eyes and try,\n\n413\n00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,790\nthat's about what that is,\nand look what happened.\n\n414\n00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,350\nWho knows,\nthat guy could've gone to prison for\n\n415\n00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,800\nthat, for something that he didn't do.\n\n416\n00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,790\nHe's a member of the A-Team now,\ncrime didn't [INAUDIBLE].\n\n417\n00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that type of stuff happens.\n\n418\n00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,320\nThey've even done, recently there's other\ncases where they're very, very new and\n\n419\n00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,600\nfresh, where they've gone after ISIS,\na terrorist group.\n\n420\n00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,430\nThey've caught plans by doing\nforensic examinations of that.\n\n421\n00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,050\nThe military has done that.\n\n422\n00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:51,360\nThey've got special groups that do that or\ncleared to do that level of forensics, and\n\n423\n00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,730\nthey've caught plans doing that,\ncaught Taliban doing plans like that.\n\n424\n00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,610\nSo this plays a very, very important role.\n\n425\n00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,930\nThen you look at stuff like\neven the Target breach.\n\n426\n00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,030\nForensics were there to see what happened.\n\n427\n00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,820\nSomeone had to dissect that and\nfigure out, how the heck did this happen?\n\n428\n00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,270\nThere's malware on here.\n\n429\n00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,440\nThat's what caused it, malware was there.\n\n430\n00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,160\nSomeone had to figure out\nthat malware was there and\n\n431\n00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,920\nhad to figure out how it was phoning home,\nand dissect that.\n\n432\n00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,050\nSo they could figure out how it worked,\nwhy it got there, blahbity blah and then\n\n433\n00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:27,939\nfix it, so was forensics necessarily used\nfor a legal issues initially in that case?\n\n434\n00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,715\nIt wasn't there, they were just\nconcerned of doing incident response and\n\n435\n00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:35,185\nfiguring out what happened.\n\n436\n00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:38,744\nBut later on it's probably shown up in\na court case because Target's gotten\n\n437\n00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:40,033\nthe pants sued off of them.\n\n438\n00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:41,345\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n439\n00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:45,547\nBut somehow that same evidence that\nthey used to just fix their systems and\n\n440\n00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:48,664\nprevent any Further leaks and\nget rid of that malware,\n\n441\n00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:52,454\ncan now be taken into a court of law\nif they can figure out who did it,\n\n442\n00:23:52,454 --> 00:23:56,820\nthey can now prosecute against them,\nor whoever the case may be.\n\n443\n00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,200\nAnd you know,\nanother one that we want to mention,\n\n444\n00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,010\nwe talked about the Locard's principle,\nwhere he talks about\n\n445\n00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,140\nevery contact leaves some type of trace,\nwhether you leave or take it with you.\n\n446\n00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:14,030\nAnd the FBI, they had a pretty big part in\nintroducing cyber crime as well, right.\n\n447\n00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,070\nBack in the, I think it was the 30s\nwhen they opened up their first lab.\n\n448\n00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,880\n>> Yeah.\nIt was back then.\n\n449\n00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,930\n>> And started working with cyber crimes,\nbecause again,\n\n450\n00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,210\ncomputers were starting to be something,\nnot computers necessarily, but, this\n\n451\n00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:29,500\ndigital world was different, from what\nwe were used to dealing with forensics.\n\n452\n00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,040\nBlood, and fingerprints and\nthings like that.\n\n453\n00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,550\nThis opened up a whole new world, so\n\n454\n00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,910\nthe FBI had a big part in kind\nof developing that as well.\n\n455\n00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:40,380\n>> Oh, yeah in fact number\nthe procedures they developed for\n\n456\n00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,010\nthat are still valid today.\n\n457\n00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:46,370\nYou know those processes that\nthey followed they're still here.\n\n458\n00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,790\nYou know they've kind of\nmetamorphisized over the years and\n\n459\n00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,390\nbeen enhanced to account for new things.\n\n460\n00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,090\nBut, they would still be\nrecognizable to someone that was\n\n461\n00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,770\nworking in the labs at that time.\n\n462\n00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,010\nNow you actually see where the FBI\nset up a lab all those years ago.\n\n463\n00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,110\nOne of the things we're going\nto talk about here is what if\n\n464\n00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,250\nyou have to set up a lab?\n\n465\n00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,550\nThat's not uncommon to\nhave to set up a lab.\n\n466\n00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,230\nThere's people that have\nforensic labs in their house.\n\n467\n00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,331\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n468\n00:25:11,331 --> 00:25:11,974\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No.\n\n469\n00:25:11,974 --> 00:25:13,788\nBut there are people that do have, yeah.\n\n470\n00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:15,367\n>> He just doesn't want you to know.\n\n471\n00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:16,300\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n472\n00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,690\nI don't want my stuff compromised.\n\n473\n00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,560\nBut yeah.\n\n474\n00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,240\nYou can have companies\nthat set those things up.\n\n475\n00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,020\nYou definitely have law enforcement\nsetting it up you are seeing a lot of\n\n476\n00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,630\nthose things carry on through.\n\n477\n00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,490\nAnd also, to kind of add something else\nto that, we are talking about computer\n\n478\n00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,970\nforensics in the context of digital\nforensics, and then forensics as a whole.\n\n479\n00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:45,660\n>> The stuff, the fingerprints,\nthe blood spatter's on it.\n\n480\n00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,810\nYou may actually be working\nwith teams that do that.\n\n481\n00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,290\nThere's nothing saying that that\ncomputer isn't present at a crime scene\n\n482\n00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,110\nwhere someone was doing wire transactions,\nand\n\n483\n00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,210\nhis business partner came in and\nblew his head off.\n\n484\n00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:57,930\n>> Yeah.\n>> You could be\n\n485\n00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,260\npart of that crime scene in there.\n\n486\n00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,110\nSo you might be working with that.\n\n487\n00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,280\n>> Absolutely.\nThere was a case here in the Gainesville,\n\n488\n00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,180\nFlorida area,\nwithout getting to many specifics,\n\n489\n00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,660\nbut there was a case of a missing person.\n\n490\n00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,810\nI think they eventually\nfound the person dead.\n\n491\n00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,950\nBut they had found a laptop and\none of the persons,\n\n492\n00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,770\none of the people that\nthey were investigating.\n\n493\n00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,710\nThey found a laptop shoved up into like\nan AC vent or something like that.\n\n494\n00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,800\nAnd there was trace blood on it.\n\n495\n00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,000\nThat's what started the whole thing.\n\n496\n00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,560\nNow we've got trace blood on this.\n\n497\n00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,540\nThe blood can be typed back to the victim.\n\n498\n00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,030\nThat now gives me the right and\nthe ability to in and\n\n499\n00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:35,460\nget a warrant to take that investigation\nfurther and dive into that computer and\n\n500\n00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,860\nstart doing the computer forensics.\n\n501\n00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,110\nSo you definitely see a combination of,\nit's not gonna be just computer forensics.\n\n502\n00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,780\nIt's not gonna be just physical\ncrime scene forensics.\n\n503\n00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,193\nIt's typically both nowadays.\n\n504\n00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:48,067\nAnd one can lead to the other and\nthey're gonna tie in together.\n\n505\n00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:52,746\n>> Yeah that's teamwork,\nteamwork, teamwork.\n\n506\n00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:57,599\nYou may just have a computer to work on.\n\n507\n00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,127\nBut then again, there may be\na whole ecosystem you're living in,\n\n508\n00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:04,971\na whole team coming in where they're\ninvestigating different parts and\n\n509\n00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:07,250\nyou all have to coordinate your evidence.\n\n510\n00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:12,740\nSo, and the way you're doing things and\nprocessing stuff so\n\n511\n00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,820\nyou're going to have to learn how\nto work on a team and expect it.\n\n512\n00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,820\nYou may go into some unpleasant scenes.\n\n513\n00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,120\nThat's something you've got to be prepared\nfor if you're going to be in this field.\n\n514\n00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,280\nI certainly am not going to, it's not\nthe first place I'd want to walk into,\n\n515\n00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,590\nsome scene where someone's doing a wire\ntransfer or something and they got their\n\n516\n00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:37,945\nhead blown off and I have to work on a\ncomputer for that had brain matter on it.\n\n517\n00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:39,585\nBut, you might have to.\n\n518\n00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:41,425\n>> Hopefully not.\n\n519\n00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:42,905\nBut you definitely might have to.\n\n520\n00:27:42,905 --> 00:27:45,505\n>> Oh,\nI've only done it a couple of times.\n\n521\n00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:46,450\nNot that big of a deal.\n\n522\n00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Tastes like chicken.\n\n523\n00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,730\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Don't want to go there.\n\n524\n00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,250\nAll right.\nSo, a lot of good information there.\n\n525\n00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,620\nSome basics of what we need to\nunderstand about digital forensics and\n\n526\n00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,910\ncomputer forensics.\n\n527\n00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,800\nKind of an idea about where we're heading\nwith the rest of our episodes, but\n\n528\n00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,690\nwe're not done yet.\n\n529\n00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,910\nWe've got some more but\nlooking at the clock, it's about time for\n\n530\n00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,950\nus to take a break.\n\n531\n00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:08,242\nSo we're gonna come back, we're gonna hit,\nwe're gonna talk about cyber crime,\n\n532\n00:28:08,242 --> 00:28:11,628\ndifferent types of cyber crimes,\nsome kind of categories there,\n\n533\n00:28:11,628 --> 00:28:15,515\nas well as some different types of\ninvestigations those crimes may lead to.\n\n534\n00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:17,419\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n535\n00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:24,639\n[SOUND].\n\n536\n00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:26,311\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n537\n00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:30,884\nSo Sean, I think the next thing we want to\ntalk about is cyber crime in general, and\n\n538\n00:28:30,884 --> 00:28:33,090\nwe can kind of categorize cyber crime.\n\n539\n00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,660\nI mean, not everything falls neatly\ninto one of these categories.\n\n540\n00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,010\nBut when we're discussing it, when we're\ntalking about it, when you're studying up\n\n541\n00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,320\non it, sometimes it helps to\nkind of create these categories.\n\n542\n00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,510\nSo let's talk about those.\n\n543\n00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,960\nOne of the first ones I think I'm going\nto talk about is person to person via\n\n544\n00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,030\ncomputer, yes, that's an interesting one.\n\n545\n00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,660\nAnd let me just kind\nof back up a bit here,\n\n546\n00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,310\nwhen we're getting to the categories,\njust to make it clear,\n\n547\n00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:07,540\nwe're talking about different\nways interactions are occurring.\n\n548\n00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,370\nThis doesn't mean that we're\nexcluding stuff like denial services,\n\n549\n00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,860\nand potential social engineering,\nstuff like that.\n\n550\n00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,380\nWe're not excluding those.\n\n551\n00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,470\nThose would fit into these categories.\n\n552\n00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,450\nSo these will be high level things\non the whole organizational chart.\n\n553\n00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,890\nAnd then the other tacks would fall\nunderneath things and like you say, Mike,\n\n554\n00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,290\nthey could be something that covers more\nthan one category, it's entirely possible.\n\n555\n00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,900\n>> Yeah, a lot of times a crime doesn't\ninvolve just one type of attack.\n\n556\n00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,920\nIt might be several types of\nattacks that they've used to,\n\n557\n00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,080\nin the end, reach their goals.\n\n558\n00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,170\nSo you might fall into, or\nmight find yourself in a scenario where\n\n559\n00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,090\nmore than one of these taken place and\nthat you're investigating.\n\n560\n00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,350\n>> Alright, so let's break it down then.\n\n561\n00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,470\nWhen's the last time\na category of cyber crime.\n\n562\n00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,150\nI can't say category this morning!\n\n563\n00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,900\nWhat is the first category\nwe want to discuss?\n\n564\n00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,660\n>> Well,\nyou're saying the person-to-person, so\n\n565\n00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,390\nwe'll look at that one first\n>> First,\n\n566\n00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:10,450\nthe person to person is a very interesting\none because it's like it sounds, it's\n\n567\n00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:16,570\nsomeone taking advantage of or targeting\nsomeone else by using a computer.\n\n568\n00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,830\nAnd that could be through things, you\nknow, such as fishing emails, you know,\n\n569\n00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,500\nand that's something that kind of\nsurprises people, they're like,\n\n570\n00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:31,560\nwhy would a forensic technician even care\na little bit about a phishing email.\n\n571\n00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,390\nThat's how identity theft happens,\nthat's how malware happens, and\n\n572\n00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:41,050\nthat's how a lot of things happen,\nso yeah, it's a crime,\n\n573\n00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,872\ntherefore forensic tech could be involved\nwith that, it's entirely possible.\n\n574\n00:30:45,872 --> 00:30:50,120\nCyber bullying there's one,\nI can't remember the unfortunate\n\n575\n00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:56,680\nteenager's name, and\nit's one of many sad stories and\n\n576\n00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,090\nthat got cyber bullied by\npeople at her highschool.\n\n577\n00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,280\nShe came over from Ireland, went to a high\nschool here in the U.S., with her family.\n\n578\n00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,050\nAnd got cyber bullied.\n\n579\n00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,650\nAnd she committed suicide and\nso they went through and\n\n580\n00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:14,910\ndid a whole investigation on it and\nthey took that thing, went to court.\n\n581\n00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,280\nIt absolutely went to court.\n\n582\n00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,680\n>> Yeah, there was a movie, I don't know\nhow old it was, but my girlfriend just\n\n583\n00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,720\nhappened to be watching it the other day,\nI thought it was appropriate.\n\n584\n00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,070\nIt was called Cyber Bully.\n\n585\n00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,590\nAnd it was about that very thing where\nthe child was being bullied by other kids.\n\n586\n00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,660\nAnd it was all.\n\n587\n00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,851\nThrough social media type sites and\nthings like that.\n\n588\n00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:33,823\nSo when we talk about a person\nto person via computer, what\n\n589\n00:31:33,823 --> 00:31:38,324\nwe're really talking about, in this case,\nthe computer's not the intended target.\n\n590\n00:31:38,324 --> 00:31:43,651\nThe person is the target, the computer's\njust used to facilitate that attack.\n\n591\n00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,890\nSo instead of me coming up to you and\npointing a gun at you and\n\n592\n00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,947\ntrying to rob you,\n\n593\n00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:52,620\nI'm using a computer to somehow perpetrate\nsome type of attack against you.\n\n594\n00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,490\nSo, again, the computer's not\nthe actual intended target,\n\n595\n00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,750\nthe computer's just a tool I'm\nusing to attack this other person.\n\n596\n00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,735\n>> Yes, exactly right and\nthat's not too foreign of a concept.\n\n597\n00:32:05,735 --> 00:32:12,400\nIt's, to use an example,\nsomeone shooting another person,\n\n598\n00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,920\nthat gun is a tool, and that's all it is,\nin the commission of that crime.\n\n599\n00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,500\nYeah, that person killed\nanother person using a gun, but\n\n600\n00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,220\nit could have been a knife,\ncould have been anything else.\n\n601\n00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,850\nSo that is what they're gonna,\nin the case of a gun,\n\n602\n00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,010\nthat's what they're gonna investigate.\n\n603\n00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,070\nBecause they're gonna need to look at it\nand say, okay we pulled a slug from this\n\n604\n00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:33,710\nperson and we can see certain markings\non it and you tie it back to that gun.\n\n605\n00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,930\nSame way with a knife, there's blood and\nfingerprints and all that on it.\n\n606\n00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,800\nSo it's not a foreign concept.\n\n607\n00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,360\nWe're just adapting that to the computer\nand digital side of things.\n\n608\n00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,453\n>> And I know in the US we've got our\njustice codes, and they've actually break\n\n609\n00:32:48,453 --> 00:32:51,450\nthat out, and I can't remember the durn\nnumbers, I don't know if you can, Sean.\n\n610\n00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,000\n>> Effectiveness of evidence.\n\n611\n00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,400\n>> Yeah, there's like ten 30 and\nthen there's another one.\n\n612\n00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,820\n>> Oh yeah, those are different.\n\n613\n00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,590\n>> Yeah, one of them.\n\n614\n00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,930\n>> There's like 1029, 1030.\n\n615\n00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:04,000\n>> Exactly, and one of them is when\nthe computer is the target of the attack,\n\n616\n00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,210\nI\"m trying to steal data off the computer,\nor something like that.\n\n617\n00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,860\nThe other one covers what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n618\n00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,680\nWhere the computer's just used as\na means to facilitate the attack\n\n619\n00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,800\nagainst another person.\n\n620\n00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,600\nSo they actually do break this down into\nseparate categories in our U.S. code.\n\n621\n00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,270\nIn our U.S. laws, and I'm sure it's\nvery similar throughout the world.\n\n622\n00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:28,120\nSo one type then will be\nperson to person via computer.\n\n623\n00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:33,290\n>> If I could, let me throw something in\nthere because you did mention there and\n\n624\n00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,670\nI want to emphasize a point\nyou just put out there.\n\n625\n00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:40,220\nThat is the laws,we will\nbe talking about laws as we\n\n626\n00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,959\ngo through our whole examination forensics\nto familiarize you with the field.\n\n627\n00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,680\nBut pay attention to what Mike said here.\n\n628\n00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:55,290\nHe said in the U.S. any laws that we talk\nabout are only gonna be here in the U.S.\n\n629\n00:33:55,290 --> 00:34:01,970\nYou might hear stuff emphasized in some\nspecific areas about stuff overseas.\n\n630\n00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,900\nSo if you're in the U.K, or\nSome other place in Europe,\n\n631\n00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,350\nyou're in Canada, wherever.\n\n632\n00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,140\nThese laws that we say in\nhere may be similar, but\n\n633\n00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,320\nit's up to you to figure out what\nthose are for your specific region.\n\n634\n00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,560\nSo we're not gonna make any claim\nthat when you look at the laws here,\n\n635\n00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,520\nwe just wanna get that right\nout of the point out front.\n\n636\n00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,093\nWe call that disclaimer in the business,\nright?\n\n637\n00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:26,894\n>> Yes we do.\n\n638\n00:34:26,894 --> 00:34:28,640\n>> Yeah.\n\n639\n00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,690\nYou're responsible for\nfiguring out what these are.\n\n640\n00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,860\nAnd that would be the same thing\nhere by the way in the U.S.\n\n641\n00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,850\nIt's not to pick on\nanybody internationally.\n\n642\n00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:40,250\nHere in the U.S., I'm from California,\n\n643\n00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,230\nwhere I was born and\nraised and I still live there.\n\n644\n00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,430\nIf I'm doing a forensic investigation,\nthere's local laws there and\n\n645\n00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,060\nthere's local laws here.\n\n646\n00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,970\nAnd on the East coast there's\ncertain local districts.\n\n647\n00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:55,000\nYou go through, I'm sure.\n\n648\n00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,250\nIn Florida, where we're at right now, I'm\nsure if you go to different counties and\n\n649\n00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,420\ncities, there could be\ndifferent laws there.\n\n650\n00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,400\nIt's something that we do have to\nvery clearly pay attention to.\n\n651\n00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,780\n>> In fact, Phillip in our chat room\njust mentioned that same point,\n\n652\n00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,680\nit can vary from state to state.\n\n653\n00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,340\nSo as part of being a forensic\ninvestigator, you've got to make sure that\n\n654\n00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,010\nyou're aware of those laws and\nthat you're not violating any.\n\n655\n00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,610\nDifferent courts in different countries\nmight handle evidence differently.\n\n656\n00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,570\nSo as Sean says, Artis Neighbor,\n\n657\n00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:32,420\nthey were talking primarily about what we\nfind here in the US as far as our laws go.\n\n658\n00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,900\nBut you do have to be aware that\ndifferent states within the US might have\n\n659\n00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900\ndifferent laws.\n\n660\n00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,590\nEven different local areas\nmight have different laws.\n\n661\n00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,330\nDifferent countries,\n\n662\n00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:44,190\ndefinitely going to have different laws\nthat we have to follow and be aware of.\n\n663\n00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,620\nEven within industries we can find\ndifferent regulations that have\n\n664\n00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,340\nto followed, like HIPPA and SOX.\n\n665\n00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,180\nAnd things like that.\n\n666\n00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,070\nSo we've got to make sure that we do our\ndue diligence whatever field we're going\n\n667\n00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,000\nin to and whatever area we're\nworking as far as geographically.\n\n668\n00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,550\nThat we are paying attention to\nthat because it does vary and\n\n669\n00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,270\nit changes, right?\n\n670\n00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,960\nIt's not like what I learned last\nyear might be the same this year.\n\n671\n00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,030\nBecause this is a whole new field,\n\n672\n00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,420\nreally, I mean it's not new\nas in like from yesterday.\n\n673\n00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,980\nBut the laws are taking some time\nto catch up with the technology.\n\n674\n00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:21,630\nSo some of these laws are being\nmodified to fit the digital world.\n\n675\n00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,660\nSome of them they're just\ntrying to shoe horn others,\n\n676\n00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,350\nthey're trying to pass new laws but\nthat can take time, kind of exciting.\n\n677\n00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,910\nYou might be in a case where your case\nactually is one of the case they use to\n\n678\n00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,830\ngenerate a new law.\n\n679\n00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:39,240\n>> Yeah, it has happened that there\nhave been cases that absolutely,\n\n680\n00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,760\nyou'll see cases cited to some of\nthese laws that were based on it.\n\n681\n00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,270\nMany of the books that you'll purchase on\nforensics or research of things online.\n\n682\n00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,470\nWhen you see a law,\nif you investigate the law.\n\n683\n00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,970\nThat law came into action because\nsomething happened that necessitated that\n\n684\n00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,800\nlaw coming into effect.\n\n685\n00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,410\nSo this kind of also cuts back to,\nis the fact that when you,\n\n686\n00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:12,180\nof working on a team, I'm not a lawyer,\nI don't wanna be a lawyer.\n\n687\n00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:16,590\nNo offense to lawyers or anything else,\nbut I know that that's what my limit is.\n\n688\n00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:21,220\nI'm gonna concentrate on the technical and\nthe computer forensic side,\n\n689\n00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,040\ndigital forensic side, that's what I know.\n\n690\n00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,540\nI'm going to stick with that.\n\n691\n00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,270\nI'd rather do that really well\nthan do that and that poorly.\n\n692\n00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,480\nAnd I kid you not.\n\n693\n00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,510\nI actually had a conversation\nwith a friend of mine last night,\n\n694\n00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:41,820\nback in California that he is a lawyer.\n\n695\n00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,180\nHe goes through when I ask about\nchanges to some of these things,\n\n696\n00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,050\nhe looks it up and\nwill explain it to me in layman's terms.\n\n697\n00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:53,260\nIf he doesn't know it, he works for\nthe state of California and\n\n698\n00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,665\nknows people up the federal level.\n\n699\n00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:58,660\nHe can get the stuff or research, so\n\n700\n00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,760\nI rely on having those connections,\nand you should too.\n\n701\n00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,210\n>> And going back to the whole thing,\nyou can't be a master of everything,\n\n702\n00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,300\nyou gotta understand where\nyour limitations are.\n\n703\n00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,060\nAnd make sure that you have people,\n\n704\n00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,470\npart of your team, that can help you in\nthose areas that you're not the expert in.\n\n705\n00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,600\nAnd I know we got a whole episode\nwe're gonna discuss laws.\n\n706\n00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,410\nSo I don't wanna spend too much time here.\n\n707\n00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,960\nBut we might as well, while we're here,\ntalk about the fact that\n\n708\n00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,050\ncyber crime does lend itself\ntowards far reaching.\n\n709\n00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,210\nI don't have a good way to say that.\n\n710\n00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,240\nJust because the-\n>> No boundaries.\n\n711\n00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,830\n>> Yeah.\nThe victim might be here in Florida, but\n\n712\n00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,405\nthat doesn't mean the attacker is\nhere in Florida or even in the US.\n\n713\n00:38:37,405 --> 00:38:40,515\nSo all of a sudden we've got to worry\nabout the international laws and\n\n714\n00:38:40,515 --> 00:38:41,085\nthings like that.\n\n715\n00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:45,565\nThat's why it's really important to bring\nin experts that understand that part of it\n\n716\n00:38:45,565 --> 00:38:47,400\nwhen we're doing these investigations.\n\n717\n00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,500\n>> Yeah.\nYou're going to be, and more than likely,\n\n718\n00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,020\nmost of you that are going\nto be watching this course,\n\n719\n00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,680\nyou're more than likely going\nto be on the technical side.\n\n720\n00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,350\nIt's kind of the nature of the audience.\n\n721\n00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:05,030\nIt's not to say that,\nif you're a lawyer or\n\n722\n00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,770\nsomething, you are more than\nwelcome to watch this too.\n\n723\n00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,870\nWe're not saying this isn't for you.\n\n724\n00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:13,840\nBut we're saying that,\nyou're gonna see a different,\n\n725\n00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,940\nwhole different perspective on it.\n\n726\n00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,410\nMaybe you don't get all\nthe technical stuff,\n\n727\n00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:22,040\nmaybe you'll have to ask somebody\nlike myself or someone like Mike, or\n\n728\n00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,080\nany one of a number of people\nthat know technical details.\n\n729\n00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,590\nTo explain it in a way you understand.\n\n730\n00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,538\nBut typically the audience\nhere is gonna be IT people and\n\n731\n00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,811\nyou're not gonna know the law.\n\n732\n00:39:33,811 --> 00:39:35,754\nThe lawyers that sit in this\none would know that, but\n\n733\n00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:38,771\nthere's probably not too many lawyers\nout there who are administrative staff.\n\n734\n00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:40,071\nYou could be.\n\n735\n00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:44,480\nI'm not saying you couldn't, but you know,\nbe prepared to know your limitations.\n\n736\n00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,920\nAnd that a good point for\nMike to bring up there.\n\n737\n00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,610\nOne of the things that they will\nemphasize in every course you take and\n\n738\n00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:56,940\nevery place you go to,\nis don't exceed your scope of knowledge.\n\n739\n00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,040\nDon't do that.\n\n740\n00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:04,090\nThis is one of those areas\nwhere I'm not against anybody\n\n741\n00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:10,540\ngoing outside the lines that are trying\nto learn new things or do new things.\n\n742\n00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,400\nThat's how you grow as an individual.\n\n743\n00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,060\nAnd I'm not saying here that you\nshould never do that in forensics.\n\n744\n00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,750\nBut, on a live case where\nyou go to a crime scene,\n\n745\n00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,520\ndon't start flying blind and making it up.\n\n746\n00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,220\nBecause that's how you lose a case,\nbecause their gonna ask you well,\n\n747\n00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,300\nwere did you come up with that?\n\n748\n00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,420\nDid you make it up?\n\n749\n00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,080\nThat may be a completely sound forensic\nprocess that you came up with.\n\n750\n00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,190\nBut they are going to ask you,\nwell how many times that has been used?\n\n751\n00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,436\nWell, I just made it up.\n\n752\n00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,304\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can have whiteboard the whole thing\n\n753\n00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,340\nout and prove it.\n\n754\n00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,600\nEvery process started somewhere,\n\n755\n00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,410\nbut the turning the other side,\nthat's their job to poke holes on it.\n\n756\n00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,280\nThey're gonna say well, what's,\nokay, it worked in this case, but\n\n757\n00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,030\nhow many other cases that can prove\nthat this is a reliable way of gaining\n\n758\n00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,820\nthis evidence and preserving it.\n\n759\n00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,190\nYou don't have it.\n\n760\n00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,460\nYou still may be able to push your case\nthrough and your evidence through.\n\n761\n00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,630\nWith the right care, it does happen.\n\n762\n00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,610\nBut, it makes, you gotta higher burden\non you, you're pushing a rock uphill.\n\n763\n00:41:14,502 --> 00:41:18,520\n>> All right, so back to our types\nof cyber crimes are categories.\n\n764\n00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,898\nYou have person-to-person\nvia computer well,\n\n765\n00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:24,130\nwe're really using the computer as\na way to facilitate the attack.\n\n766\n00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:27,290\nThe computer itself is\nnot the intended target.\n\n767\n00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:31,220\nWhat's another category we might run\ninto or we need to be familiar with.\n\n768\n00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,680\n>> You've got another category,\nperson on computer crime.\n\n769\n00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,860\nThat's typically one of the ones\nthat people think about is,\n\n770\n00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,400\nis that it could be someone\nwith a mobile device or\n\n771\n00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,650\nsomeone with a computer\nstriking out another computer.\n\n772\n00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,790\nSo someone's driving that computer attack,\nanother one.\n\n773\n00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:54,402\nI mean, just go view the CEH course that\nMike and I did here about a month ago,\n\n774\n00:41:54,402 --> 00:41:58,288\nand you should view it cuz\nthe hosts are really good.\n\n775\n00:41:58,288 --> 00:41:59,335\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In that so,\n\n776\n00:41:59,335 --> 00:42:02,425\nplease we get paid-per-viewing.\n\n777\n00:42:02,425 --> 00:42:04,410\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n778\n00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,198\nWe're not- [CROSSTALK]\n>> For a nickel a day, Mike can.\n\n779\n00:42:07,198 --> 00:42:14,795\n[LAUGH] But yeah, you can,\nif you think the stuff we did with CEH,\n\n780\n00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:22,010\nthat's prime examples of\nperson on computer crime.\n\n781\n00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,540\nWe were using in that CEH course,\n\n782\n00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,859\nwe were using the computer as\nan instrument to strike out\n\n783\n00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,020\nother individuals, which we already\ntalked about, or other computer systems.\n\n784\n00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,610\n>> Right,\nlike maybe hacking a database and\n\n785\n00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,760\ntrying to mine personal\ninformation on their customers.\n\n786\n00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,500\nOr a web server trying to do a denial\nof service against a web server or\n\n787\n00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,560\nsomething like that.\n\n788\n00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,360\nSo really we're talking about I'm\ngoing to attack another computer,\n\n789\n00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,446\nnot an individual.\n\n790\n00:42:47,446 --> 00:42:49,950\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n791\n00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:53,920\nWe could be, like you said, stealing\ncredit card information, social security\n\n792\n00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,890\nnumbers, trade secrets, national\nsecurity secrets, intellectual property.\n\n793\n00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,040\nAll those things would fall in this.\n\n794\n00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,580\nIt would fall into that category\nof person on computer crime.\n\n795\n00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,510\nI mean you look at the RAAA and the MPA\nthe people that do the record industry and\n\n796\n00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:14,510\nmovie industry here at\nleast in the states.\n\n797\n00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,790\nThey have forensic technicians and\n\n798\n00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,770\nlawyers that they work with that\ninvestigate how did this movie get out.\n\n799\n00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:24,130\nThey look for watermarks and\nfingerprints and look at meta data,\n\n800\n00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,660\nwhich we'll talk about and\nlook at all those things and see, okay,\n\n801\n00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,550\nwhere can they trace this back too?\n\n802\n00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,490\nSo there's a lot of areas where you may\nnot initially expect this to be in, but\n\n803\n00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,040\nit is there.\n\n804\n00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,470\nBut that is what person\non computer crime is.\n\n805\n00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:40,892\nIt's someone targeting, no the individual\nin this side of the terminal, but\n\n806\n00:43:40,892 --> 00:43:42,240\nthat terminal itself.\n\n807\n00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,770\n>> The terminal itself.\nVery good, very good.\n\n808\n00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,580\nAll right then and\n\n809\n00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,157\nthat brings us to our last category which\nwould be computer against computer.\n\n810\n00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:49,503\nComputer on computer.\n\n811\n00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:52,265\nSounds like some kind of digital,\nwe probably shouldn't go there.\n\n812\n00:43:52,265 --> 00:43:53,459\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n813\n00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:55,326\n>> So, what do we mean by we've got person\n\n814\n00:43:55,326 --> 00:43:57,823\non person or\nperson attacking person via computer.\n\n815\n00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,535\nWe've got person against the computer.\n\n816\n00:43:59,535 --> 00:44:01,403\nAnd then you got computer on computer.\n\n817\n00:44:01,403 --> 00:44:02,950\nWhat do we mean by that?\n\n818\n00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,790\n>> Well, to best understand that, it's a,\n\n819\n00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:08,029\nkind of give it a little\nbackground story to this.\n\n820\n00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,111\n>> On the first day, IBM created the PC,\nand then Steve Jobs came and\n\n821\n00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:16,696\njacked it all up by creating Apple-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n822\n00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:17,536\n>> And that was computer on\n\n823\n00:44:17,536 --> 00:44:18,169\ncomputer crime.\n\n824\n00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:20,141\nIt's gone on ever since.\n\n825\n00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:21,990\nSo see?\n\n826\n00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,027\nYou guys were like, where's this going?\n\n827\n00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:25,036\nWhere's he going with that?\n\n828\n00:44:25,036 --> 00:44:25,847\nAnd then, boom!\n\n829\n00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:26,693\nGotcha!\n\n830\n00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:28,120\nAll right.\n\n831\n00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,959\nLet's just wait for a minute and\nwatch the discussion group and\n\n832\n00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:34,432\nsee how many angry Apple people we made.\n\n833\n00:44:34,432 --> 00:44:39,530\n[LAUGH] So, in any case,\ncomputer on computer crime.\n\n834\n00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:44,330\nOne of the best examples,\nif you watch the CEH course or\n\n835\n00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:47,860\nthe Security+ course, you're\nfamiliar with something called DDOS.\n\n836\n00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:54,190\nBut just in case you're not\nfamiliar with that, what you have,\n\n837\n00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:58,040\nis you have someone initially\ncompromising the system, and\n\n838\n00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,160\nthen compromising some\nother victims' systems.\n\n839\n00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,770\nAnd then they're using those\nto target something else.\n\n840\n00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,485\nAnd those can be automated,\nto target something.\n\n841\n00:45:06,485 --> 00:45:10,645\nAnd so at that point when you have\na system attacking another one,\n\n842\n00:45:10,645 --> 00:45:13,015\nyou have computer on computer crime.\n\n843\n00:45:13,015 --> 00:45:14,605\nAnd that can even be in the case of,\n\n844\n00:45:14,605 --> 00:45:18,640\nit doesn't necessarily literally have\nto be a computer attacking another.\n\n845\n00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,810\nIt could be an actual worm that's\nspreading from one computer to another.\n\n846\n00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,460\nSo that would fit into\nthat category as well.\n\n847\n00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,370\nYes.\nSomeone gave rise to that worm, but\n\n848\n00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:33,180\nthat worm is actually being,\nit's autonomous.\n\n849\n00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,020\nOnce it's out there, it's gonna go boom,\nboom, boom, boom, boom and go around and\n\n850\n00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,750\nstart hitting different systems out\nthere on the internet or whatever.\n\n851\n00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,410\n>> So it might have started with\na person-to-computer type attack, where I\n\n852\n00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:49,060\nhad to develop my bot farm so I could do\nthis distributed denial service attack.\n\n853\n00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,120\nSo I had to attack several\nmachines to build that up, but\n\n854\n00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:57,520\nthen the actual attack was my botnet,\nmy zombie farm,\n\n855\n00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,100\nattacking some site trying to\nduo denial service against it.\n\n856\n00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,849\nSo in the end,\nit's a computer to computer type attack.\n\n857\n00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:05,462\nVery interesting.\n>> Yeah.\n\n858\n00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:09,547\nIt can absolutely be that.\n\n859\n00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:14,409\nThink about how many zombies or drones you\nhave out there, think about systems that\n\n860\n00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:18,300\nare pinging other systems that\nare doing various interactions.\n\n861\n00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:25,100\nRight now, as we stand here or sit in some\nplace watching this a computer monitor,\n\n862\n00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,870\nhow many systems are actually\nworking with one another and\n\n863\n00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,230\nthere's no human interaction?\n\n864\n00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:37,800\nSo this is a very real possibility and\nits more than possibility, it does happen.\n\n865\n00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,250\nIt absolutely happens that you have one,\none system doing something to another.\n\n866\n00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:45,540\nSaying you can as a person\nbe held responsible for\n\n867\n00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:50,130\nsomething that was under, supposed to be\nunder your control, that you bought and\n\n868\n00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,470\npaid for and configured that system and\nwere supposed to be monitoring it.\n\n869\n00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,881\nEven though that system did that,\nyou can still be held responsible for it.\n\n870\n00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:57,527\n>> So yeah.\n\n871\n00:46:57,527 --> 00:47:02,073\nMy PC becomes a part of this botnet and\nthen that botnet goes out and launches\n\n872\n00:47:02,073 --> 00:47:07,610\nan attack and does some major financial\ndamage or other things to some company.\n\n873\n00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:11,717\nI can potentially be held responsible\nbecause it was my PC that was taking part\n\n874\n00:47:11,717 --> 00:47:12,613\nin that attack.\n\n875\n00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:13,188\nNot good.\n\n876\n00:47:13,188 --> 00:47:18,884\n>> Well, think of this, if we look at some\nof the stuff that's happened in the past,\n\n877\n00:47:18,884 --> 00:47:24,168\nwe have some good examples even though\nthey may not have thought about that,\n\n878\n00:47:24,168 --> 00:47:28,483\ngo back a few moments where I\ntalked about it, about the RAAA.\n\n879\n00:47:28,483 --> 00:47:33,329\nAnd suing people that were\ndownloading MP3s off of BitTorn,\n\n880\n00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:36,042\nLimewire, or Napster years ago.\n\n881\n00:47:36,042 --> 00:47:40,649\nWhen you had people downloading those\nthere were several cases where they came\n\n882\n00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,620\nin hard and heavy on someone.\n\n883\n00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:47,210\nThat was maybe like a 70 or\n80-year-old grandmother that just paid for\n\n884\n00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:51,750\nthe internet access to go and\nsend emails to her kids or something.\n\n885\n00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:57,870\nAnd her grandson came over and\nwas downloading MP3s.\n\n886\n00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:58,830\nWho got sued?\n\n887\n00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,440\nThe person on the bill.\n\n888\n00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,510\nThat was something that they were held\nresponsible for, it was their access.\n\n889\n00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,181\n>> No more checks for\nthat grandkid on Christmas.\n\n890\n00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:06,690\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n891\n00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,110\nNo more checks.\n\n892\n00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:12,195\nAnd they're getting fruitcakes for\nChristmas,which is punishment enough.\n\n893\n00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:13,195\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, they are.\n\n894\n00:48:13,195 --> 00:48:14,124\n>> Check out,there we go.\n\n895\n00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,390\nI didn't even expect that one.\n\n896\n00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:17,860\nA CPN machine, someone brought that up.\n\n897\n00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,400\nWell.\nYou are old.\n\n898\n00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:21,975\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n899\n00:48:21,975 --> 00:48:25,010\n>> [LAUGH] So\nwe've got different categories of text.\n\n900\n00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,320\nWe've got the person to\nperson via computer.\n\n901\n00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,920\nWe've got the person to computer, and\nthen we've got the computer to computer.\n\n902\n00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,440\nSo we can categorize these attacks.\n\n903\n00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,870\nMight be a little easier to work with, or\n\n904\n00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,630\ndecide what our methodology might be\nas going through our investigation.\n\n905\n00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,230\nAnother thing we're gonna talk about\nis the different types of cyber crimes.\n\n906\n00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,400\nAll right, because there's not just one,\none flavor,\n\n907\n00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,420\nwe can categorize that as well, right.\n\n908\n00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,760\n>> Oh absolutely and\nthere's one more thing we can add on to\n\n909\n00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,318\nthose three categories by the way,\njust wanna add on as like a footnote.\n\n910\n00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:57,930\nThat will change, I can't tell you\nwhat's gonna be added to those level of\n\n911\n00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:01,790\ncategories, but technology\nobviously is evolving so rapidly.\n\n912\n00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:07,200\nThat you might see in another decade, you\nmight see another categories added onto\n\n913\n00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,730\nthere as you get better artificial\nintelligence and stuff like that.\n\n914\n00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:15,320\nThat absolutely out of the categories\ncan change the picture again.\n\n915\n00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,770\nSo, yeah, absolutely.\n\n916\n00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,090\n>> That's what we love about\nthe security industry right?\n\n917\n00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,770\nIt's that it's always changing,\nwe gotta stay on top of our game.\n\n918\n00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:24,590\nWe've gotta get out there.\n\n919\n00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,580\nWe've gotta pay attention to whats going\non and it keeps it fresh and exciting.\n\n920\n00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,040\nWe don't get bored with it.\n\n921\n00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,340\n>> Yeah.\nThat's one of the ways I look at it and\n\n922\n00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:35,210\nin fact I saw someone here in\nthe discussion groups I don't know\n\n923\n00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,050\nif you caught it Mike someone said about.\n\n924\n00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,640\nThat they think of this as a puzzle.\n\n925\n00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,140\n>> Yes.\n\n926\n00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,450\n>> A forensics puzzle to solve.\n\n927\n00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,040\nIt's a cool way to look at it.\n\n928\n00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,900\nIt's very mentally stimulating\nto look at these things and\n\n929\n00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,250\nthink of new ways to attack a problem.\n\n930\n00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,350\nWe're going to do a lot of demos\nduring the next two weeks.\n\n931\n00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,940\nTrust me.\n\n932\n00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,730\nAnd so, we're really going to kind\nof stretch your brain out and\n\n933\n00:49:58,730 --> 00:49:59,980\ndo all different things with it.\n\n934\n00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:04,220\nAll of you are gonna see those tools,\n\n935\n00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:08,220\nand why you might think their\nreally cool and exciting.\n\n936\n00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:13,750\nYou're gonna at some point develop your\nown techniques as well, and you have to.\n\n937\n00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:18,530\nYou have to be criminals and\npeople get smarter.\n\n938\n00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,860\nThey find ways to get around them.\n\n939\n00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,230\n>> Yeah, it's always a big cat and\nmouse game.\n\n940\n00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,280\nWe build something,\nthey figure out ways to break it.\n\n941\n00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,850\nWe build a better mouse trap and\nthey build better mice or\n\n942\n00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,820\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n943\n00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,714\nSo it's always a back and\nforth, back and forth.\n\n944\n00:50:30,714 --> 00:50:33,320\n>> Yeah.\n\n945\n00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,070\nIt's gonna be that.\n\n946\n00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,500\nYou're stepping into that world.\n\n947\n00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,150\nIt's an exciting world but\nit's a very challenging world.\n\n948\n00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:43,810\nYou've already got, [INAUDIBLE] enough, a\nlot of you already got some of this done,\n\n949\n00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:47,930\nsince we have a lot of\nveterans of our CEH campaign.\n\n950\n00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:49,290\n>> Yes.\n\n951\n00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,990\n>> A lot of that stuff kind of carries\nover to here, but we're adding onto it.\n\n952\n00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:52,490\n>> Absolutely.\n\n953\n00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,030\nAll right.\nSo we alluded to this earlier in\n\n954\n00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:56,890\nan earlier segment.\n\n955\n00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,291\nWe talked about different types\nof cyber crime investigations.\n\n956\n00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:03,530\nThis is not always as cut and\ndry or like we might think of it.\n\n957\n00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,540\nThat we can actually might not end up\nprosecuting the person in a court of law,\n\n958\n00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,710\nbut the investigation is just important,\nright?\n\n959\n00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:12,820\nSo we got those two\ndifferent categories there.\n\n960\n00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,980\n>> Yeah, there's, literally,\ntwo different types.\n\n961\n00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:19,590\nThere's the corporate type and\nthe criminal type.\n\n962\n00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:24,290\nThe corporate type, yeah it could\nbe a policy that was violated.\n\n963\n00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:29,310\nYou need to investigate someone\nthat you think is doing something\n\n964\n00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,780\nis kind of out of the ordinary and\n\n965\n00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,750\nthey need to be more closely\ninvestigated to see what's going on.\n\n966\n00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,190\nIt could be that you have your corporate\nsecurity departments see some anomalous\n\n967\n00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:41,170\nbehavior, and they call in the forensics\nguys to take a look at it.\n\n968\n00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,340\nYou could be doing any of those things.\n\n969\n00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:47,370\nIn fact, in some corporations,\nyou have your instant response team and\n\n970\n00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,030\nyour security team working\nwith your IT guys.\n\n971\n00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,440\nAnd when the initial\ninstant response comes in,\n\n972\n00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,270\nthe forensics guys are part\nof that team that is called\n\n973\n00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:01,580\nin to see if there is anything that\nneeds to be collected and preserved.\n\n974\n00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:05,700\nSo we can analyze it later\nbefore anything's done here.\n\n975\n00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,110\n>> When we think about that,\n\n976\n00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:10,710\nwe always think about cyber-crimes as\nbeing somebody attacking the bank.\n\n977\n00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,670\nOr doing some identity theft or\n\n978\n00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,790\ndoing a denial of service on a web\nserver or something like that.\n\n979\n00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,430\nBut not always going to be the case.\n\n980\n00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,040\nSometimes the digital\nforensics that we're doing,\n\n981\n00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,220\nthe cyber crime investigation if you will,\nit doesn't involve the courts at all.\n\n982\n00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,010\nIt's more about a company trying\nto do their due diligence and\n\n983\n00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:33,600\nif they've got to let somebody go or\nsomebody has violated corporate policy.\n\n984\n00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,870\nWhat they're allowed to\nuse those computers for.\n\n985\n00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:38,910\nTaking information home\nthat shouldn't have been\n\n986\n00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:42,030\nremoved from the corporate network or\nthings like that.\n\n987\n00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,870\nWe've got to investigate that as well.\n\n988\n00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:48,780\nEven if there isn't an end goal of\nprosecuting them in a court of law.\n\n989\n00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,630\nAnd in that case we've really got to be\nfamiliar with the company itself, right?\n\n990\n00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,520\nBecause different companies\ndifferent policies.\n\n991\n00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,620\nSo, we've gotta make sure we understand\nwhat their corporate policy is,\n\n992\n00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,550\nwhat their security policy is.\n\n993\n00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:04,560\nAnd have a really good understanding of\nthat before we can really do that type of\n\n994\n00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,360\ninvestigation.\n\n995\n00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,060\n>> Yeah.\nIt's that whole cross-disciplinary teams,\n\n996\n00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,600\nyou have to be aware of the big picture.\n\n997\n00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,990\nYou may very well be thrown into\na situation where you may be a corporate\n\n998\n00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,150\nperson that's working on this stuff and\n\n999\n00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,820\nthen all of the sudden it turns\ninto a criminal investigation.\n\n1000\n00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,100\nFor example, I get to give a really\ngood example in the area I used to\n\n1001\n00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:33,700\nwork in California Lucas Arts\nwas right down the road.\n\n1002\n00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,390\nGeorge Lucas lived like ten\nmiles from my old work.\n\n1003\n00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:40,405\nI used to go steal plants for\nthe Deathstar on my days off.\n\n1004\n00:53:40,405 --> 00:53:42,260\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1005\n00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,670\n>> The good old days.\n\n1006\n00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:45,790\nShooting womp rats in my T60.\n\n1007\n00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:46,705\n>> That's right.\n\n1008\n00:53:46,705 --> 00:53:49,450\n[LAUGH]\n>> Someone out there's looking us up stuff\n\n1009\n00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,610\non Wookipedia right now.\n\n1010\n00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:53,240\nSee, I know the lingo.\n\n1011\n00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:58,430\nSo, but there was someone in that area\n[LAUGH] It's actually kind of funny.\n\n1012\n00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:05,000\nThis person was caught\ntaking stuff from his work.\n\n1013\n00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,860\nThis was way back when Lukas\nstill owned the whole Star Wars\n\n1014\n00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,530\nfranchise and everything.\n\n1015\n00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:14,710\nThe guy was working there and\nhe got caught taking stuff out so\n\n1016\n00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,820\nthey canned him.\n\n1017\n00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,050\nBut then they found when they\ndid an investigation on it,\n\n1018\n00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:23,120\nthey found the guy had actually, that\nthere was more evidence there that was\n\n1019\n00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,240\ncreeping up that this guy\nwas up to some more stuff.\n\n1020\n00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,810\nSo a corporate investigation now became\na criminal investigation because\n\n1021\n00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:34,810\nnow they wanted to see okay what's\nhe taking home, out of here?\n\n1022\n00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:38,000\nA corporation cannot go search your house.\n\n1023\n00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,060\nThey can't go do that.\n\n1024\n00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:43,460\nThey have to, at that point,\ngo through the whole process\n\n1025\n00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:49,020\nof the court system, obtain a warrant,\nand that being served and all that.\n\n1026\n00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,540\nAnd in that case,\nthey had enough evidence,\n\n1027\n00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,950\nand enough leading to that,\nthat they can get a warrant.\n\n1028\n00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,950\nThey went to the person's house and\n\n1029\n00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:01,940\nthey found that the guy had like a ton\nof Star Wars memorabilia in there.\n\n1030\n00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:05,020\n>> [LAUGH] All up on Ebay,\nor hanging on his walls.\n\n1031\n00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,156\n>> Yeah\n>> Yeah,\n\n1032\n00:55:06,156 --> 00:55:10,205\nthey found a whole bunch of stuff there,\nit was kind of funny.\n\n1033\n00:55:10,205 --> 00:55:14,020\nThe guy lived on Yavin 4.\n\n1034\n00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,760\nSo, yeah, I know my stuff dude.\n\n1035\n00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,325\nI can do this all day.\n\n1036\n00:55:18,325 --> 00:55:21,630\n>> [LAUGH] Looks like some of our chatroom\nmembers are appreciative of that.\n\n1037\n00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:23,710\nThey're like, we know what\nyou're referring to there Shawn.\n\n1038\n00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:25,037\nWe've all seen that one.\n\n1039\n00:55:25,037 --> 00:55:27,420\n[LAUGH] But that a really good story.\n\n1040\n00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:32,510\nSo that's an example of where they've\nstarted off as a corporate investigation.\n\n1041\n00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,408\nI just want to know we're\nterminating this guy.\n\n1042\n00:55:34,408 --> 00:55:36,656\nI need to make sure that I\nhave my ducks in a row so\n\n1043\n00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:40,775\nwe can say why we're terminated this guy,\nand have all that to protect the company.\n\n1044\n00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:45,602\nBut then through that investigation,\nsome of the evidence that was turned up\n\n1045\n00:55:45,602 --> 00:55:50,440\nactually led to a criminal investigation\nand took you to that next category.\n\n1046\n00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,460\nSo great segue into our\ncriminal investigations,\n\n1047\n00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,390\nwhich is where we start taking\nit to the court of law.\n\n1048\n00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:59,670\nYeah, and\nthat's where it does enter that system.\n\n1049\n00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:03,950\nI mean, you may initially do something\nlike a corporate investigation and\n\n1050\n00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,310\nfind out that someone, and I remember this\nhappening, you probably heard of this too,\n\n1051\n00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:09,860\npeople running like their eBay\nstores from their company.\n\n1052\n00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,580\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1053\n00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,247\n>> And installing stuff there, you know,\n\n1054\n00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:14,410\nand they were like, really, seriously?\n\n1055\n00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:18,450\nActually, strange enough, heard about\nsomeone doing that on a military base.\n\n1056\n00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:23,360\nThey said that they were a eBay store,\nyou know, while they were on duty.\n\n1057\n00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,640\nYeah, that didn't turn out well for\nthat person.\n\n1058\n00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,550\n>> I've gotta be able to monitor\nmy sales while I'm at work,\n\n1059\n00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:31,200\nand I really wanna take advantage\nof that company bandwidth so\n\n1060\n00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,210\nthat I can do my\n>> My eBay sniping and\n\n1061\n00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:35,450\nall that good stuff, right?\n\n1062\n00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:39,170\n>> Yeah, and they did an investigation and\nthey found, and\n\n1063\n00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:44,770\nthey did an investigation and that case\nand another case too, where someone's been\n\n1064\n00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:50,000\nusing services inappropriately\n>> And they were terminating them.\n\n1065\n00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,340\nBut sometimes just inside a company,\n\n1066\n00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:56,120\nyou'll find it gets to a criminal part,\nyou better be dotting all your I's and\n\n1067\n00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,770\ncrossing all your T's, or that case\ncould go in the toilet really quick.\n\n1068\n00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:02,800\nBut you may start with\na criminal investigation too.\n\n1069\n00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,080\n>> So with that, yeah,\nit could just start off as a criminal.\n\n1070\n00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,570\nSo when we're doing that\ncorporate investigation,\n\n1071\n00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:07,780\nwe've really got to be careful, don't we.\n\n1072\n00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:11,580\nBecause we might think,\nthis is just an internal investigation.\n\n1073\n00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:14,440\nI don't have to follow all\nthose same procedures.\n\n1074\n00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,030\nIt'd be a lot easier if I'd just use the\nactual hard drive or something like that.\n\n1075\n00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:20,670\nAnd just to get it and be done.\n\n1076\n00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,730\nBut then what happens if it does\nescalate into a criminal investigation?\n\n1077\n00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:28,300\nAll of a sudden everything you've done\nhas actually hampered the criminal case.\n\n1078\n00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,520\nSo we've got to make sure we understand\nthe difference between the two, because\n\n1079\n00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,310\nthere are going to be some slightly\ndifferent techniques, maybe that we use.\n\n1080\n00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:35,650\nBut for the most part,\n\n1081\n00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:39,060\nyou've got to be aware that it could\nalways transition to the other type.\n\n1082\n00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,090\nAnd so, we have to be ready for that.\n\n1083\n00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:45,330\nAnd something else'll add into that\nyou may not initially think of with\n\n1084\n00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,610\ncorporate cases.\n\n1085\n00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:50,710\nIf you're a corporate\nforensic investigator, and\n\n1086\n00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:56,080\nyou have to investigate someone in that\ncompany, one of the basic tenets of\n\n1087\n00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,900\nbeing a forensic investigator is\nbasically, don't get emotionally involved.\n\n1088\n00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,620\nDon't influence that evidence.\n\n1089\n00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,810\nWhat happens, happens.\n\n1090\n00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,970\nYou do the procedures.\n\n1091\n00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:10,760\nYou follow everything by the numbers and\nwhat you get is that's the truth.\n\n1092\n00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,450\nYou don't try to manipulate stuff.\n\n1093\n00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:18,430\nThat not only is just bad form, will get\nyou out of the industry really quickly,\n\n1094\n00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:20,810\nbut it could also land you in\na lot of legal hot water, too.\n\n1095\n00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,530\nAnd that has happened to\nforensic technicians.\n\n1096\n00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:27,450\nYou know, and\nto kind of add a little thing to that for\n\n1097\n00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,670\nthe corporate side,\nwhy might someone do that?\n\n1098\n00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:34,790\nWell they may If I want a result and\nthey want that result because, guess what?\n\n1099\n00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:37,880\nI know Joe from accounting,\nI've worked with him for years.\n\n1100\n00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,050\nI don't wanna believe he'd do that.\n\n1101\n00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,830\nI don't wanna see him lose his job.\n\n1102\n00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:45,190\nHe's got kids and whatever to feed and\nhe's got a wife and all that.\n\n1103\n00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,790\nI don't wanna do that to him.\n\n1104\n00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:49,290\nThat could be quite hard.\n\n1105\n00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:52,460\nSome companies though, the larger\nones that do employ forensic techs,\n\n1106\n00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,220\nthey will compartmentalize that.\n\n1107\n00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,960\nSo it's just a case of\nyou everything everyone\n\n1108\n00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,790\nstuff maybe sanitized out all that so\nyou don't have an opportunity to do that.\n\n1109\n00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:06,160\n>> All right and the last thing we want to\ntalk about in this episode is going to be\n\n1110\n00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,960\nreporting a cyber crime and I know we've\ngot an entire episode we're going to\n\n1111\n00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,180\nreally dive in to reporting\n>> But at this point we want to mention it\n\n1112\n00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:19,000\nbecause it is part of the process and\nan outcome of our investigation, right?\n\n1113\n00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,190\n>> Yes.\nRemember at the end of the day everything\n\n1114\n00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,920\nhas to be reported to someone.\n\n1115\n00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:29,980\nYou just can't say, well hey I did it and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n1116\n00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:35,180\nNo and this is one of the things\nwhere IT people that come into it\n\n1117\n00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,400\nhave to kind of relearn things.\n\n1118\n00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,870\nI'll be just completely dead honest here,\n\n1119\n00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:46,170\nmost IT people at work in enterprises or\nhelp desks or anything.\n\n1120\n00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:50,440\nThere's probably a lot of you if I asked\nyou to raise your hands that are in that.\n\n1121\n00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,660\nThey may be doing that job right now.\n\n1122\n00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:56,890\nAnd we can just throw a blanket out or\ncast a wide net and\n\n1123\n00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,885\nsay you all suck at writing notes, okay?\n\n1124\n00:59:58,885 --> 01:00:01,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can say that because\n\n1125\n01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,560\nI sucked at writing notes.\n\n1126\n01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,030\nMike sucked at writing\nnotes when he did it.\n\n1127\n01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:07,115\nWe all did it.\n\n1128\n01:00:07,115 --> 01:00:09,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Ask them to reboot the system.\n\n1129\n01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,670\nAnd save.\n\n1130\n01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:12,180\nYou know, that was it.\n\n1131\n01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,730\nIt's like what about those 12\nother things you had him do?\n\n1132\n01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:17,310\nYou know you never documented that.\n\n1133\n01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:21,110\nSo that's what a thing is.\n\n1134\n01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:24,210\nThat doesn't hold water anymore.\n\n1135\n01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:25,570\nYou know you can get away.\n\n1136\n01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:29,510\nIt's actually an inside\njoke just how bad and\n\n1137\n01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:32,000\nIT and help desk people are taking notes.\n\n1138\n01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,650\nSometimes you see people that are very\ndetailed, but then you see people who just\n\n1139\n01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:43,420\nplain suck, that's unfortunately about\n99% of the people out there, but\n\n1140\n01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,180\nyou can't do that in forensics.\n\n1141\n01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:50,070\nYou don't document something that little\nhole that you leave is enough for\n\n1142\n01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:54,850\na lawyer to just punch right through and\ndestroy your whole case.\n\n1143\n01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:57,560\nIt has to be clearly documented.\n\n1144\n01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,230\nAnd think about how challenging that is.\n\n1145\n01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:06,640\nWhen you're pulling files off of a system,\nwhen you are engaging a system.\n\n1146\n01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,760\nWhen you're doing any activity,\n\n1147\n01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,600\nyou have to figure out a way to\nverify that you did something.\n\n1148\n01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:17,410\nI can't go and investigate if this\nnotebook was a crime scene here,\n\n1149\n01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:21,460\nI can't go and investigate this notebook\nand say over here in my log, just go oh,\n\n1150\n01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:24,360\nat such and such a time,\nthis is what I was doing.\n\n1151\n01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:29,090\nOkay, you know, I may be trustworthy and\nhonest as far as you guys know.\n\n1152\n01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:34,880\nYou know, I may be all cool with that,\nbut they are gonna need more than that\n\n1153\n01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,730\nbecause right now,\nthe stuff I put on a log file,\n\n1154\n01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:45,290\nthat really kind of takes the form of\nhearsay evidence, kind of sort of.\n\n1155\n01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:48,120\nAnd we'll talk about that,\nif you're not clear on that.\n\n1156\n01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,240\nBut it kinda takes the format,\nit's kinda weak.\n\n1157\n01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,630\nWhat we need to do is figure out a way\nof collecting data off that system to\n\n1158\n01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:57,060\nverify that on that system itself\nthat this was the date and time.\n\n1159\n01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:01,350\nAnd remember touching said in certain\noperating systems in certain conditions,\n\n1160\n01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,810\ntouching the file changes\nthe date automatically.\n\n1161\n01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:06,850\n>> Yeah and who's to say that I\ndidn't just write these notes out.\n\n1162\n01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:09,190\nJust before the case opened or\nwhatever, right?\n\n1163\n01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:09,950\n>> Yeah.\n>> There's no way to\n\n1164\n01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:14,320\nprove that I took those notes while I was\ndoing the investigation or those steps,\n\n1165\n01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,720\nso that's what he's saying, is that\n\n1166\n01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,160\nit might not be seen as the strongest\ntype of evidence in a court of law.\n\n1167\n01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:20,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n1168\n01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,510\n>> So\nreporting is definitely a big part of it,\n\n1169\n01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:24,470\nit's something that we've got to focus on.\n\n1170\n01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:28,290\nIt's like the wrapper, I mean, it ties\nour entire investigation together and\n\n1171\n01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:29,510\nmakes it presentable.\n\n1172\n01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:30,600\n>> It's like the force.\n\n1173\n01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,410\n>> Yeah [laughter] and\nyou've gotta use the force, right?\n\n1174\n01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:37,900\nSo we've got to make sure we've got\na good understanding of reporting and\n\n1175\n01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,465\nwhat's required, how we go about it,\ntools we can use to do that.\n\n1176\n01:02:41,465 --> 01:02:42,475\nThere are a lot of cool tools.\n\n1177\n01:02:42,475 --> 01:02:46,945\nI know Sean's going to show us one or\ntwo that can assist us with that for\n\n1178\n01:02:46,945 --> 01:02:50,765\nus IT peeps that might not be so\ngood at taking notes ourselves.\n\n1179\n01:02:50,765 --> 01:02:55,260\nSo got a lot of good stuff coming\nup in our future episodes.\n\n1180\n01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:59,350\nSo, Sean, anything we want to add to\nour modern computer forensics episode?\n\n1181\n01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:03,350\n>> I don't think we have\nany more right now.\n\n1182\n01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,970\nHopefully I didn't scare anybody off or\n\n1183\n01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:08,740\nanything by saying any of\nthe stuff I did in here.\n\n1184\n01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,352\nAnd hopefully a lot of you\nare improving your note taking skills.\n\n1185\n01:03:11,352 --> 01:03:13,555\n[CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE] Once that I suck,\nand then they took it personal.\n\n1186\n01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:16,759\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which you should.\n\n1187\n01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:19,040\n>> You are just making me a better person.\n\n1188\n01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:24,000\n>> Especially you people sitting\nin the back of the class.\n\n1189\n01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> .\n\n1190\n01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,830\nJust one more thing to add on the note\n\n1191\n01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:31,310\nstuff, really quickly, all kidding aside,\nabout scaring people aside.\n\n1192\n01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:34,710\nI do hate taking notes.\n\n1193\n01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,990\nI hate documentation,\nI think like most people do.\n\n1194\n01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:41,940\nFortunately, I've got a bunch of stuff\n\n1195\n01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,450\nplanned to show you over\nthe next couple weeks.\n\n1196\n01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:48,280\nAt least a half a dozen\nof those tools actually\n\n1197\n01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,330\nhelp create the documentation for you.\n\n1198\n01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:54,070\nAnd it's forensically sound, so\n\n1199\n01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:59,520\nwhile you may not catch everything even\nif you are a good note taker, it will.\n\n1200\n01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,580\nAnd it will do it in such a way\nthat you've got a dead to\n\n1201\n01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,485\nrights that it's the correct stuff.\n\n1202\n01:04:04,485 --> 01:04:05,275\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n1203\n01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:06,615\nAll right.\n\n1204\n01:04:06,615 --> 01:04:09,315\nWell, ladies and gentleman that's\ngoing to do it for this episode.\n\n1205\n01:04:09,315 -->

in our\nDigital Forensic Investigator episodes.\n\n1208\n01:04:16,555 --> 01:04:19,565\nIn this intro we started\ntalking about just\n\n1209\n01:04:19,565 --> 01:04:23,055\nwhat a digital forensic investigator is,\nwhat it's all about.\n\n1210\n01:04:23,055 --> 01:04:28,220\nDifferent types of forensic categories and\ncyber crime categories.\n\n1211\n01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:31,090\nAnd we really gave you\nthe high level overview\n\n1212\n01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:34,570\nof where we're gonna go with\nthe rest of our episodes.\n\n1213\n01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,740\nSo again, thanks for tuning

00:00:37,520\nwelcome to another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,470\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,610\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,410\n>> Doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,410\n>> Fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,310\nGot another exciting episode for\neverybody out there.\n\n9\n00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,520\nWe're continuing on with our digital\nforensic investigator episodes and\n\n10\n00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,920\nthe next one we're gonna do is,\n\n11\n00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,850\nor the next topic we're gonna\nbe covering is digital evidence.\n\n12\n00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,400\nSo lot of good information here,\ninformation that we need in\n\n13\n00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,210\norder to become a good digital\nforensic investigator.\n\n14\n00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,070\nWe've got to understand the different\ntypes of evidence that we might run into,\n\n15\n00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,640\ndeal with.\n\n16\n00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,350\nBecause different evidence has\ndifferent ways of dealing with it,\n\n17\n00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,600\nkeeping it keeping it safe,\npresenting it, etc., etc.\n\n18\n00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,640\nSo let's just dive right in and\n\n19\n00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,380\ntalk about good old digital evidence and\ndigital data.\n\n20\n00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,157\n>> Yes, digital data,\nwe count our data period.\n\n21\n00:01:23,157 --> 00:01:27,859\nWe've been around computers,\nwe understand what that actually is.\n\n22\n00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:32,520\nIt's stuff that we did,\nit's stuff that we generate during our\n\n23\n00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,560\nnormal usage of a computing system or\na network.\n\n24\n00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,730\n>> Could be files we've generated, could\nbe log files we didn't know were being\n\n25\n00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,430\ngenerated or\ndid know were being generated.\n\n26\n00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,270\nAll kinds of things that\nwe can leave behind.\n\n27\n00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,510\n>> Absolutely, it's literally kinda\nstaggering when you think about the amount\n\n28\n00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,180\nof stuff that gets generated during\nthe operation of the system.\n\n29\n00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,800\nJust by for example, turning on a Windows\nsystem, you don't touch the keyboard.\n\n30\n00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,590\nHow much stuff is getting\nmanipulated on there.\n\n31\n00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,610\nAnd it's something that now all\nof you have to think about.\n\n32\n00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,940\nBecause that is going to affect\nyour evidence gathering,\n\n33\n00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,810\nand the quality and\nreliability of your evidence.\n\n34\n00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,998\nI mean, substantially.\n\n35\n00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:18,980\nI also throw in to this\nwhole mix the idea of\n\n36\n00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,790\ncomputer generated and\nuser generated data.\n\n37\n00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,450\nThere is a difference between those\ntwo types that you may not have ever\n\n38\n00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,460\nthought about.\n\n39\n00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,285\nThat they're literally if you\nhave computer generated stuff,\n\n40\n00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:37,410\nthat stuff that the computer itself\ncreates during its operation when it's\n\n41\n00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,660\neither running an application,\nwhen it's starting up and logging stuff.\n\n42\n00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,150\nYou don't have to type stuff into a log.\n\n43\n00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,610\nFor example in windows, in the event\nviewer, you don't it creates that.\n\n44\n00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,080\nSo that's very clearly computer\ngenerated information.\n\n45\n00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,350\nPage file that is something\nthat is computer generated and\n\n46\n00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,860\nthere is stuff in it, that is another one.\n\n47\n00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,360\nUser generated stuff would be things that\nfor example, you had direct influence put\n\n48\n00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,600\non creating that,\ntype it in to a database or what have you.\n\n49\n00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,130\nThat's what that sort is so it kind of\nadds interesting rub to this whole thing\n\n50\n00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,310\nbecause we would normally think about\nthe latter and not the former type.\n\n51\n00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,290\nUser generated, not computer generated.\n\n52\n00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,210\n>> Right.\n\n53\n00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,360\nAnd all that can be affected by\npolicies in the systems that\n\n54\n00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,400\nthe bad guy was using whether\nit was set up to do auditing and\n\n55\n00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,540\nhow detailed of auditing that it was\ndoing, what service you attacked it is.\n\n56\n00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,720\nIt really is surprising.\n\n57\n00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,120\nAnd I do some teaching, I think you\ndo as well, some Microsoft classes.\n\n58\n00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,600\nAnd we talk about auditing.\n\n59\n00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,530\nAs one of the examples we turn on auditing\non a file and then we log on as this\n\n60\n00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,210\nuser and go double click on it or what\nhave you, and the number of entries that\n\n61\n00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,130\nget created from one user clicking\non one file is mind boggling.\n\n62\n00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,490\nSo there's all kinds of places that we\ncan look to find this evidence, and\n\n63\n00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,710\nhopefully that the bad guy, the criminal\nisn't aware of all of these places and\n\n64\n00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,200\nleaves some of that around for us to find.\n\n65\n00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,220\nThey're gonna be trying, obviously,\nto not do that, to not leave evidence.\n\n66\n00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,750\nWe've covered it.\n\n67\n00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,390\nIf you guys have not\nwatched our CEH episode,\n\n68\n00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,650\nyou should definitely go check those out.\n\n69\n00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,990\nThey're gonna be doing different\ntypes of techniques to try and\n\n70\n00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,930\navoid leaving any evidence.\n\n71\n00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,060\nBut, we go back to Lockheed I think is\n\n72\n00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,850\nthe guy,\n>> Lockherd.\n\n73\n00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,190\n>> Any contact is going to\nleave some type of trace, and\n\n74\n00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,630\nthat's what we're counting\non when it comes to this.\n\n75\n00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,440\nSo in our investigation we\ngotta deal with digital data,\n\n76\n00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,870\nbut digital data's a little different than\nwhat we might think of with physical data.\n\n77\n00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,390\nWe've all seen the different crime shows\nand things like that and finger prints and\n\n78\n00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,710\nblood stains and weapons and the such.\n\n79\n00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,046\nBut when it comes to digital data.\n\n80\n00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:47,056\n>> Well lets not talk\nabout my parties [LAUGH].\n\n81\n00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:49,278\n>> [LAUGH] That was a good one last week.\n\n82\n00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:54,220\n[LAUGH] But\ndigital data a little bit different.\n\n83\n00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,230\nWe got to handle it a different way,\nwe got to treat it a different way.\n\n84\n00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,880\nI would talk as much as some of the issues\nthat we have with digital evidence.\n\n85\n00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,050\n>> Yes, digital evidence.\n\n86\n00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,920\nReason why we're going through\nthis whole lengthy discussion\n\n87\n00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,680\nof digital evidence is because it's the\nway we're looking at things now is a lot\n\n88\n00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,530\ndifferent than you've\nlooked at in the past.\n\n89\n00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,990\nWe're no longer just looking at,\nthat doc file or\n\n90\n00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,960\nthat database or anything like that.\n\n91\n00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,490\nWe're going way beyond that.\n\n92\n00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:31,350\nAnd as we both said, there's a staggering\namount of information that's on a system.\n\n93\n00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,250\nAnd then you throw in to\nthe fact that you get someone\n\n94\n00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,360\nthat's trying to keep stuff\nfrom being left behind.\n\n95\n00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,840\nYou throw in Locard's exchange principle,\nthere's stuff there.\n\n96\n00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,760\nYou just have to know how to look for it.\n\n97\n00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,610\nBut then there's also on top of that is,\n\n98\n00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,780\nthe stuff you collect is it something\nthat you can take to a court room?\n\n99\n00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,030\nThat's the thing, it's really tough to\nsay if there's any sort of perfect crime.\n\n100\n00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,820\nThey say that there's no perfect\ncrime in the physical world.\n\n101\n00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,580\nIt's really tough to say if it's\nthat way in the digital world,\n\n102\n00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,640\nit just depends on if\nyou know what's there.\n\n103\n00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,430\nIn fact, I've got a really good friend\nback in Sacramento that works for\n\n104\n00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,730\none of the financial institutions.\n\n105\n00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,611\nPerfect, he really crystallized up this\nwhole thing really well, forensics,\n\n106\n00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:21,561\nthat's what he does by the way.\n\n107\n00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,926\nHe said, leave no trail see no jails.\n\n108\n00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:27,550\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's nice.\n\n109\n00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,800\n>> He's been doing it for years.\n\n110\n00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,140\nI was like, I don't know if\nI can sum it up any better.\n\n111\n00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,140\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n112\n00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,860\nMaybe not as easy to do, but\n\n113\n00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,645\ndefiantly a good strategy to follow if\nyou're trying to avoid being detected.\n\n114\n00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:44,400\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, if you can slide under the radar\n\n115\n00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,680\nand not leave any really overt clues.\n\n116\n00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,700\nYou still are leaving stuff behind.\n\n117\n00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,940\nYou might be able to prevent or\nslow down someone's examination of it.\n\n118\n00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,470\n>> Right.\n\n119\n00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,510\nAnd one of the first things we probably\nneed to talk about with digital evidence\n\n120\n00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,870\nis, is it a little different than\na lot of our physical evidence?\n\n121\n00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,780\nIf I find a weapon, and\nI put in an evidence bag and I seal it up.\n\n122\n00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,890\nAnd I put it in a box, put it in a car,\nput it on a shelf at work, what have you.\n\n123\n00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,360\nThat weapon is still gonna be a weapon and\nI didn't really change anything about it.\n\n124\n00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,140\nBut with digital evidence,\na little bit different.\n\n125\n00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,590\nI mean, it's so\neasy to accidentally modify this evidence.\n\n126\n00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,400\nCuz it's not like a physical piece\nof hardware that I'm touching.\n\n127\n00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,970\nWe're talking about\nthings on a hard drive.\n\n128\n00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,240\nWe're talking about metadata for\nthese documents.\n\n129\n00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,790\nWe're talking about things\nthat are stored in ram or\n\n130\n00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,230\nin page files and we all know there's\ngonna be some issues trying to capture.\n\n131\n00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,270\nOr it's very easy to\ndestroy that type of data.\n\n132\n00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n133\n00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,530\nAbsolutely.\n\n134\n00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,250\nVolatility.\n\n135\n00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:43,900\nVolatility.\n\n136\n00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,584\nVolatility.\n\n137\n00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:49,243\nIs probably the biggest thing that\nyou're gonna have that's gonna impact,\n\n138\n00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:54,046\nor one of the biggest things you're gonna\nhave that impacts how good evidence is\n\n139\n00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:56,567\ngonna be, or when you should collect it.\n\n140\n00:07:56,567 --> 00:08:00,878\nWe actually have three criteria we're\ngonna talk about as we get further\n\n141\n00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:01,720\ninto it.\n\n142\n00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,600\nThere's a certain way to collect evidence.\n\n143\n00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,730\nLet's talk about going back\nto something we had when\n\n144\n00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,400\nwe talked about modern forensics and\nforensic science.\n\n145\n00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,350\nWe talked about what forensics does.\n\n146\n00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,020\nWe talked about we talked\nabout the first part of it,\n\n147\n00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,070\ncuz it's really responsible for\na couple of things.\n\n148\n00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,690\nIf you focus on the first part,\nthat was collect and preserve.\n\n149\n00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,910\nSo, when we talk about digital evidence,\n\n150\n00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:33,375\nwe got to figure out a way to collect it,\nand preserve it at the same time.\n\n151\n00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,105\nBoth those things have to be accomplished.\n\n152\n00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:37,655\nIt can definitely be,\n\n153\n00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:41,765\nto borrow something from one of our\nviewers out there, it can be a puzzle.\n\n154\n00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:42,505\nIt really can.\n\n155\n00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:46,375\nSometimes you may even be faced with hey,\nI have to sacrifice this,\n\n156\n00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:50,425\nto get this, cuz this is more reliable\nevidence, you might very well have that.\n\n157\n00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,060\nThere are certain things.\n\n158\n00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,310\nIn fact, some of the ways we collect\nevidence due to it's volatility and\n\n159\n00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,960\nreliability will fly counter to some of\nthe things that you have seen done in\n\n160\n00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,630\nthe past.\n\n161\n00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,850\nLike I have said a couple of times\nalready, today how you shut down\n\n162\n00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:11,640\na computer, that can definitely\nimpact how you collect evidence or\n\n163\n00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,210\nwhat evidence your gonna have\nto collect in the first place.\n\n164\n00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:14,760\n>> Right.\n\n165\n00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,500\nWe've got a whole episode about being\nthe first res-ponder and things like that.\n\n166\n00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,480\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n167\n00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,580\nIf you come up to a gear,\n\n168\n00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,240\nyour boss calls you in oh my gosh I\nthink this machine's been hacked.\n\n169\n00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,870\nSomething's going on,\nI need you to gather evidence.\n\n170\n00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,720\nIf you're not trained properly or\nyou panic or\n\n171\n00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,100\nwhat have you, you go in there unplugging\nthat machine, or powering it down and\n\n172\n00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,030\nyou've just lost a good chunk\nof your evidence, right,\n\n173\n00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,830\nbecause we know that a lot of information\nis stored in RAM, which is volatile.\n\n174\n00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,340\nPower that machine down.\n\n175\n00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,740\nThat information is gone.\n\n176\n00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,490\nA lot of it's stored in my page file.\n\n177\n00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,340\nThat could be valuable\ninformation there and\n\n178\n00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,280\nif I power that machine down I\ncould lose that information.\n\n179\n00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,460\nSo we've gotta make sure we\nunderstand the types of evidence.\n\n180\n00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,784\nWhere we can look, and what their\nvalidity or Where their volatility is so\n\n181\n00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:59,029\nwe can process it in the proper order.\n\n182\n00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:05,020\nYou wanna go for the highly volatile\nstuff first before it goes away.\n\n183\n00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,770\n>> And\nwhat we should do is talk just to kinda,\n\n184\n00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:14,850\nadd to that volatility\npart,is the idea of the three\n\n185\n00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,330\ncriteria is we're talking about evidence,\nwe're talking about how fragile it is,\n\n186\n00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:26,730\nsome evidence, just by doing a little\nbit of stuff, it can be obliterated.\n\n187\n00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,480\nSome stuff has a very short lifespan.\n\n188\n00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,920\nFor example, the stuff in memory.\n\n189\n00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,450\nStuff in memory would definitely\nhave a short live span.\n\n190\n00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:41,030\nIf you turn that computer off\nyou will lose that information.\n\n191\n00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:47,320\nSo, in terms of volatility, that's way up\nnear the top, it's very highly volatile so\n\n192\n00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,540\nyou need to figure out if that computer\nis on, how are you gonna collect it?\n\n193\n00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,450\nIf the computer's off, then clearly\nthere's not anything in memory, but\n\n194\n00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,000\nif there was a crime\ncommitted with that system,\n\n195\n00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,390\nthen turning it on can do something else.\n\n196\n00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,860\nYou could have stuff on the hard drive\nwhich as far as volatility is very\n\n197\n00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,460\nlow down on the scale, but\nturning on the computer can actually,\n\n198\n00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,230\nwhen you're starting up Windows or\nLinux or what-have-you, it will do\n\n199\n00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,050\nthings that work and start tampering with\nthe drive as part of it's normal thing.\n\n200\n00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:23,370\nIt can be re-sizing the paging file, clean\nthe temp files or running scripts, any\n\n201\n00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,330\nof those things could literally obliterate\nthe evidence and then it's gone.\n\n202\n00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,200\nAnd then the other thing we have\nwhen we talk about evidence is\n\n203\n00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,850\nwhen we talk about different types of\nevidence, the actual importance of it.\n\n204\n00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,050\nYou have many types of evidence and\nyou may not be able to get it all.\n\n205\n00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,900\nIn fact, it may be too time consuming and\njust impractical to get it all.\n\n206\n00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,280\nIf that's the case,\nyou will have to make a decision,\n\n207\n00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,170\nnot only in those first two criteria,\nbut is it important to you to gather it.\n\n208\n00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,550\nThe stuff that's in memory\nmay not be useful to you.\n\n209\n00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,470\n>> You spend a lot of time,\ntry spending effort and\n\n210\n00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,430\ntime gathering that information and come\nto find out, it really wasn't worth it.\n\n211\n00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,055\nI didn't need it or something like that.\n\n212\n00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:07,079\nMaybe I could have focused\nmy time somewhere else and\n\n213\n00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,281\ngot more important evidence.\n\n214\n00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:10,760\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n215\n00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,190\nIf you collect certain evidence and\ninvest too much time it may be\n\n216\n00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,520\nsomething that has so little significance\nor impact on a potential case.\n\n217\n00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,974\nThat you wasted your time, and you may\nhave let something else just slip through\n\n218\n00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:27,512\nyour fingers while you\nwere focused on here.\n\n219\n00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:32,592\nSo it also kind of when we talk about\nthis, about the way digital evidence is,\n\n220\n00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:37,122\nthe volatility and the nature of it,\nit also goes to show you why one of\n\n221\n00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:41,891\nthe core concepts of, or core things\nthat they talk about in forensics,\n\n222\n00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:47,590\nforensic technicians, is don't let this\nbe done by people that are amateurs.\n\n223\n00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,491\nIt's, everyone's gotta start somewhere,\nI started somewhere,\n\n224\n00:12:52,491 --> 00:12:56,219\nI wasn't always a super uber genius,\nlike I am now.\n\n225\n00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:58,144\n>> [LAUGH] You're so\nmodest, I love this guy.\n\n226\n00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:02,021\n>> Yeah, I am, I'm the most modest person\nand humble person you'll ever meet.\n\n227\n00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:06,220\nSo, yeah, so don't get over myself.\n\n228\n00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,820\n>> But yeah, you've got to make sure that-\n>> It's the glasses\n\n229\n00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,008\n>> It is what it is, it makes you look so\n\n230\n00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:10,531\nintelligent.\n\n231\n00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:12,815\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I know, and the coat.\n\n232\n00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:16,610\n>> Yeah, but you're saying if you're new\nto this or you want to get in field,\n\n233\n00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,390\na lot of times we might start off\nas an intern, or a helper, or\n\n234\n00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,520\nsomething like that,\nwhere we're learning the ropes.\n\n235\n00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,240\nBecause you can't have somebody that's,\nwe've got to learn.\n\n236\n00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,190\nWe've got to start somewhere, but\n\n237\n00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,800\nat the same time,\nthink about the victim of the crime.\n\n238\n00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,260\nThey wanna prosecute this guy,\nthey don't want to\n\n239\n00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,370\nhave the case thrown out because they've\ngot somebody new collecting the evidence.\n\n240\n00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,310\nYou don't wanna be that person, right?\n\n241\n00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,090\nSo you've gotta make sure\nthat you not only study, but\n\n242\n00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,730\nyou and they know what you're doing.\n\n243\n00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,610\nAnd if you don't,\nI think you said it in an earlier episode.\n\n244\n00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,160\nThere's nothing wrong with saying you know\nhey, this isn't my area of expertise.\n\n245\n00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,380\nWe should maybe call somebody in, or\nask somebody before I go touching this.\n\n246\n00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,680\nYou don't wanna get all, arrogant and\njust say, oh yeah I can do it!\n\n247\n00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,980\nThat kind of thing,\nbecause you're gonna destroy evidence and\n\n248\n00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,780\nyou can't prosecute, or\nif it's a corporate-type case,\n\n249\n00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:12,500\nyou can't do anything against that\nemployee, and it's gonna be a bad day.\n\n250\n00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,009\n>> Expect reasonably to\nmaybe intern with somebody\n\n251\n00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:21,810\nthat's an experienced forensic person.\n\n252\n00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:27,170\nIf you are someone that's experienced in\nforensics, then you still may need to get\n\n253\n00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,100\nthe certification to show that you have\nthat standard of training and you're aware\n\n254\n00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,010\nof how evidence should be handled and\nprocessed and preserved and analyzed.\n\n255\n00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,990\nYou'll need to show that.\n\n256\n00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,976\nI can tell you from my own experience,\n\n257\n00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:47,260\nI had someone in one of my\ntraining sessions from the Army,\n\n258\n00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,620\nfrom last year, and\nthat person was a police officer.\n\n259\n00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,090\nHad used a lot of the tools that I\ntalked about in courses like this,\n\n260\n00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,950\nand they clearly had a command of it.\n\n261\n00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,630\nThey had done things, but\nonce they moved out of that,\n\n262\n00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,440\nand went to war as a civilian to work\nwith the army, the army said no,\n\n263\n00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,000\nwe need to have the paper to show that you\nunderstand that to validate those skills.\n\n264\n00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,920\nAnd so it was just that thing.\n\n265\n00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,450\n>> Absolutely.\n\n266\n00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,240\nIt could be very well for the organization\nto do the old CYA for themselves.\n\n267\n00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,241\nI mean if they bring somebody\nin that's not experienced and\n\n268\n00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:28,781\nends up losing the case because\nthe evidence was handled improperly,\n\n269\n00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:30,593\nthat's not gonna be good for them.\n\n270\n00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:34,408\nSo they're gonna verify that you have\nthe skills, have a good resume or\n\n271\n00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:37,409\nsome experience you can show them and\nthings like that.\n\n272\n00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:41,730\n>> It's interesting, do you know\nhow they say the rule of thumb for\n\n273\n00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,620\nforensic technician to be fully cooked and\nbe considered a full expert?\n\n274\n00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,164\n>> No.\n\n275\n00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:48,160\n>> Seven years.\n\n276\n00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,010\n>> Seven years.\n\n277\n00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:49,530\n>> Yeah.\n\n278\n00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,679\n>> Seven years.\n\n279\n00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,317\nBy the time I'm 60 I can, no.\n\n280\n00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:55,206\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n281\n00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:55,954\n>> We can just lie.\n\n282\n00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:56,523\nWhat the hell.\n\n283\n00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:57,394\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n284\n00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:58,543\nRight?\n>> Who cares about integrity?\n\n285\n00:15:58,543 --> 00:15:59,181\n>> A little white out on my resume.\n\n286\n00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:00,876\n>> Yeah, no problem.\n\n287\n00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,420\n>> White out!?\n\n288\n00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,800\n>> Yeah,\n[LAUGH] there I'm showing my age, right?\n\n289\n00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,125\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> There was actually, yeah.\n\n290\n00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's that stuff that some of\n\n291\n00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,730\nyou, no, I'm kidding.\n\n292\n00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,257\n>> It's what leaves those white\nmarks across your monitor there.\n\n293\n00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:14,725\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:15,491\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:16,056\n>> All right,\n\n296\n00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:17,740\nso issues with digital evidence.\n\n297\n00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,590\nWe've got the fact that it's volatile,\nor a lot of it can be volatile.\n\n298\n00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,690\nSo we have to worry about that.\n\n299\n00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,520\nWe have to make sure that we\ncollect it in the right order, and\n\n300\n00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,610\nthat we know how to collect\nit before it gets destroyed.\n\n301\n00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,530\nIt is very fragile.\n\n302\n00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,449\nAnd as you said I think, just touching,\n\n303\n00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:37,020\nopening a document changes\na lot about that document.\n\n304\n00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,491\nAgain, I think you mentioned earlier,\nwe think about the document, right.\n\n305\n00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:43,019\nAs a non-forensics person we're\nlooking at this Word document,\n\n306\n00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,130\nand I didn't modify any paragraphs.\n\n307\n00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,980\nI didn't delete anything\nout of that document.\n\n308\n00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,730\nThe document is exactly the way it\nwas when this bad guy left it there.\n\n309\n00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,310\nBut what we're not thinking about is\nall the meta data, the last access.\n\n310\n00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,780\nYou're now the person that\nlast accessed the file, right?\n\n311\n00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,580\nSo when the defense attorney takes that,\n\n312\n00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,200\nwhen you take that into court, he can just\npull that out and say well, wait a second.\n\n313\n00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,910\nYou accessed this file\nafter my defendant did, so\n\n314\n00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,750\nwho's to say you didn't put that in there?\n\n315\n00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,880\nSo you gotta think about things like that.\n\n316\n00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,400\nGotta understand the importance\nof the information.\n\n317\n00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,560\n>> And remember, if it comes down to it,\nand I don't know, there may be somebody\n\n318\n00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,610\nthat's been through this and\nbeen to court with it.\n\n319\n00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:30,900\nBut generally, if it comes down to that\nthere's even a little bit of a question,\n\n320\n00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,660\nthat's all that a defense attorney\nreally has to make is a little bit of\n\n321\n00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,320\na question on whether or not something's\nreliable and true and correct.\n\n322\n00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,145\nThat's enough to open enough doubt\nwith a jury to say, hey, we're not\n\n323\n00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:47,720\ngonna convict in this case, and we're not\ngonna rule in the prosecution's favor.\n\n324\n00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,287\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\nI mean, here in the US,\n\n325\n00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:52,395\nwe've got the whole thing,\ninnocent until proven guilty and\n\n326\n00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:54,740\nyou gotta be beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n327\n00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,770\nAnd so it just takes a little\nbit of doubt in one juror's mind\n\n328\n00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,920\nto let that defendant go.\n\n329\n00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,390\nSo we've got to do our job\n\n330\n00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,300\nto make sure that we're not\nthe ones that allow that to happen.\n\n331\n00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,350\n>> Yeah, but if it's a civil case\nrather than a criminal case,\n\n332\n00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,671\nyou might actually get away\nwith a lower standard.\n\n333\n00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:18,912\nI mean that was one, to pick out a famous\ncase, I mean it's not digital, but\n\n334\n00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:21,249\nto pick out a famous case, the OJ trials.\n\n335\n00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:22,360\n>> Yeah.\n>> Remember,\n\n336\n00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,520\nthey couldn't convict him of murder\ncuz there was enough of a doubt,\n\n337\n00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,251\neven though there was public opinion and\nall that otherwise,\n\n338\n00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:34,875\nthe legal system says you couldn't\nprove it beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n339\n00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,375\nThat's why he walked on that one.\n\n340\n00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,975\nBut, if you look just\na while down the road,\n\n341\n00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:44,612\nhe got a civil judgement cuz\nthe burden of proof was lower.\n\n342\n00:18:44,612 --> 00:18:46,535\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n343\n00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:51,910\nAll right, so we got the idea\nabout what digital evidence is.\n\n344\n00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,952\nWhat about anti-evidence?\n\n345\n00:18:53,952 --> 00:18:57,778\nI mean is there techniques we\ncan use to not allow this, or\n\n346\n00:18:57,778 --> 00:19:00,660\nwhat they call anti-forensics?\n\n347\n00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:09,300\n>> Yes, there is a whole area of this and\nit's actually really, really fascinating.\n\n348\n00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,810\nDuring the run of this course,\nwe're gonna start encountering\n\n349\n00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,677\nsome more of these techniques,\nrather than just talking about them.\n\n350\n00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:20,130\nBut anti-forensics,\n\n351\n00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,200\nwe have stuff like, Metasploit has\nanti-forensics technology in it.\n\n352\n00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,280\nIt has stuff that can actually\nmodify the file attributes\n\n353\n00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,180\nthat you were talking about.\n\n354\n00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,810\nIt can do those things that can modify\nit to something that you choose.\n\n355\n00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,125\nSo, it might be a little\nmore difficult for\n\n356\n00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:41,950\nyou to look at that metadata and find it,\nor find something you believe is true.\n\n357\n00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,220\nSo that's kind of something\nthat's interesting,\n\n358\n00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,230\nbut anti-forensics just deals with,\nlike the name implies, someone's trying to\n\n359\n00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,600\ncounter your forensic techniques\nbecause they don't wanna be discovered.\n\n360\n00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,962\nOr they really wanna conceal\nthe evidence of what ever they're doing\n\n361\n00:19:57,962 --> 00:19:59,774\nas long as the possibly can.\n\n362\n00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:02,928\nNow, how can someone do that?\n\n363\n00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:08,575\nWell, amazingly it seems like and endless\namount of ways that someone can do it.\n\n364\n00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,167\n>> Yeah, we're talking about as simple\nas just wearing a pair of gloves and\n\n365\n00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,707\nI don't leave fingerprints, all right.\n\n366\n00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:16,046\nSo I mean that's just one type [CROSSTALK]\n>> If the glove doesn't fit,\n\n367\n00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:16,799\nyou must acquit.\n\n368\n00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,518\n>> See, I was trying to set him up for\nthat the whole time.\n\n369\n00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,493\nI finally got it out there.\n\n370\n00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:20,735\n>> Yeah, see, we're a team right here.\n\n371\n00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:24,657\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's called chemistry, people.\n\n372\n00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:30,655\n>> [LAUGH] But things that would maybe\nprevent log entries from being generated,\n\n373\n00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:34,405\nor write blockers on hard drives and\nthings like that maybe.\n\n374\n00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:38,475\n>> Well, remember we talked about,\nin the CEH we talked about\n\n375\n00:20:38,475 --> 00:20:42,850\ndoing things to modify log\nfiles to actually stop that.\n\n376\n00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:47,590\nBut here's the thing, if you remember\nfrom the CEH, when we stopped a log file,\n\n377\n00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,977\nwe can tell that we stopped the log file.\n\n378\n00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:51,968\n>> There's a three hour\ngap in my log file here.\n\n379\n00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:53,910\n>> Yeah.\nSomething happened.\n\n380\n00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:58,930\n>> Yeah, so it would it would work,\nbut someone that's on our side looking\n\n381\n00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,472\nat that is gonna say,\nsomething's conspicuous by its absence.\n\n382\n00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,782\nNow then you get into that whole thing,\n\n383\n00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:10,340\nabsence of evidence is not evidence of\nabsence, or whatever they call it is.\n\n384\n00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,340\nYou rearrange those however\nmakes more sense to you.\n\n385\n00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:22,383\nSo that's something that could cause a\nfurther, deeper investigation to be taken.\n\n386\n00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:27,510\nSomeone wiping a drive is\nconsidered anti-forensics,\n\n387\n00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,370\nand in fact in some cases,\njust wiping a drive,\n\n388\n00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,600\nwith a few other things mixed in,\ncould be enough to convict you.\n\n389\n00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,110\nBecause they can say that, heck, you don't\nundertake that under normal conditions.\n\n390\n00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,161\nIt's way too aggressive for\nsomeone just to do just because, oh well,\n\n391\n00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:47,190\nI'm disposing of this.\n\n392\n00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,510\nSo there's stuff like that.\n\n393\n00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,350\nBut then there's people that\nreally are up to speed.\n\n394\n00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,360\nWiping hard drives is something that,\nwhile it used to be kind\n\n395\n00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,510\nof way up there as far as people that had\nit as a technical skill in their toolbox,\n\n396\n00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,430\nit's moved down the food chain.\n\n397\n00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:09,090\nSo more people are aware of how to do\nthat, and more utilities include that.\n\n398\n00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,800\nWhen you get rid of a computer they\ntell people how to do that and\n\n399\n00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,570\nmake it real easy.\n\n400\n00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,490\nYou can go into USA today and\nread, hey here's a link,\n\n401\n00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,580\ndownload this, run it, and get rid of\nyour computer, sell it to whoever.\n\n402\n00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,576\nSo you do have that.\n\n403\n00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:25,120\nBut then to go one step further,\nyou may or\n\n404\n00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,372\nmay not be aware of,\nmost people are who are in IT,\n\n405\n00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:34,059\nyou probably have it on your computer,\nMike like I do.\n\n406\n00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:37,536\nThat little section of the drive that\nthe vendor keeps their stuff in that\n\n407\n00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:39,476\ndoesn't get reformatted or anything.\n\n408\n00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:40,254\n>> Yup, mm-hm.\n\n409\n00:22:40,254 --> 00:22:43,184\n>> They store stuff like images and\napplications so\n\n410\n00:22:43,184 --> 00:22:44,903\nyou can reset the computer.\n\n411\n00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:47,086\n>> It lets them develop the recovery\npartition or something like that.\n\n412\n00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:48,694\n>> Yeah.\n>> Whatever it might be, but yeah,\n\n413\n00:22:48,694 --> 00:22:49,268\nabsolutely.\n\n414\n00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,191\n>> Yeah, something that gets preserved.\n\n415\n00:22:50,191 --> 00:22:51,131\nYou can hide stuff in there.\n\n416\n00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:51,833\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n417\n00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:55,734\n>> And so\nthere's ways to hide stuff in there and\n\n418\n00:22:55,734 --> 00:23:00,760\nit can be very,\nvery difficult go directly to to find it.\n\n419\n00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,370\nYes, you can find it, absolutely.\n\n420\n00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,110\nBut it's not something you typically\nwould think about, looking for something.\n\n421\n00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,000\nI guarantee you when someone is saying oh,\ndo a file recovery on the system,\n\n422\n00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,440\nthey're not looking at that partition.\n\n423\n00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,075\nSo it just doesn't make sense.\n\n424\n00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:21,449\nTo a forensic person, we understand\nthat that could be a anti-forensic\n\n425\n00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:23,870\ntechnique that someone could use.\n\n426\n00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,205\nThey could hide little things like that.\n\n427\n00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:28,605\nAnd then you can go even\nsteps further beyond that,\n\n428\n00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:32,581\nencryption is definitely\nan anti-forensic technology.\n\n429\n00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:35,722\nSteganography, which we\nsaw in the CEH course,\n\n430\n00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:40,326\nwe're gonna see again here,\nthat's an anti-forensic technology.\n\n431\n00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:44,099\nAnd it's fascinating how\nmany ways they can do it.\n\n432\n00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:47,446\nNow the thing is, some of these things,\n\n433\n00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:52,281\ngetting access to it could pose\na lot of challenges to you.\n\n434\n00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,624\nIt might be easy to get that information,\nbut\n\n435\n00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,913\nprocessing it could be\na whole other story.\n\n436\n00:23:56,913 --> 00:24:03,030\nOne really good case is\nwith encrypted files.\n\n437\n00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:08,230\nWhen you talk about encrypted files, they\nactually had a case like this where a lady\n\n438\n00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:14,240\nthat was involved in a drug case, a big\none, had encrypted her whole hard drive.\n\n439\n00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,880\nAnd the whole thing went to court,\n\n440\n00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,730\nobviously, it goes to court and\nthey said well, the evidence is there.\n\n441\n00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,640\nWe know its there.\n\n442\n00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,480\nWe can't just go ahead and wave a magic\nwand and decrypt this all that easily,\n\n443\n00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,520\nso we need the ladies\ndecryption key to do this.\n\n444\n00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,860\nAnd she because she's gonna incriminate\nherself if she provides it.\n\n445\n00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,980\n>> Right.\n>> So, there's ways that the courts have\n\n446\n00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,390\nfound to get around that.\n\n447\n00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:51,400\nIn her case, it said she was in contempt,\nand said it didn't apply in that one.\n\n448\n00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,110\nIt was actually quite fascinating\nwhen you looked at it.\n\n449\n00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,730\nAnother little, just a kinda little piece\nof trivia to throw into the whole mix.\n\n450\n00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,740\nWell, not really trivia,\n\n451\n00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:05,250\nit does actually have does actually\nhave baring on what we do.\n\n452\n00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,300\nThis was actually surprising to me.\n\n453\n00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:13,220\nSome courts have actually ruled that\nif you have a password in your head,\n\n454\n00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,720\nyou could plead the fifth for that.\n\n455\n00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,540\nIf it's written down some place,\nany place, you can't.\n\n456\n00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,540\n>> Interesting, right.\n\n457\n00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,040\n>> So they can work\n>> They could say,\n\n458\n00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,470\nyes, you have to provide that\nbecause we know it's written down.\n\n459\n00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,470\n>> Because it's written down somewhere.\n\n460\n00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,900\n>> Even though you'd be\nincriminating yourself.\n\n461\n00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,690\nYou could have it locked in a safe,\nand you're like,\n\n462\n00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,470\nI'm not going to give it to you.\n\n463\n00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,660\nThey'd say you have to.\n\n464\n00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,610\nBut because it's in your head,\nthey've ruled that no,\n\n465\n00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,200\nyou can't incriminate yourself.\n\n466\n00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,910\n>> Another reason we should never\nwrite our passwords down, right?\n\n467\n00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,350\n>> Yeah!\n>> Now they can't make me give\n\n468\n00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,160\nthem my password.\n\n469\n00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,530\n>> Yeah, so the moral of the story\nhere is if you're dealing ecstasy or\n\n470\n00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:50,260\ncrack, memorize your formulas and\npasswords.\n\n471\n00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480\nI can't say it enough, people.\n\n472\n00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,990\n>> Oh shoot.\n>> We're going to get in so much trouble.\n\n473\n00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,830\n>> I know we are.\n\n474\n00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,366\nWe're going to get in a lot of trouble.\n\n475\n00:25:57,366 --> 00:26:03,630\n>> People watching in the next\nroom are calling the Feds.\n\n476\n00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,880\n>> So\nwe we're talking about digital evidence.\n\n477\n00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,770\nWe understand what it is fragile, it has\nboth volatility that we have to deal with.\n\n478\n00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:15,580\nYou have think about our processing order,\nmake sure we're capturing all we can.\n\n479\n00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,190\nDeciding what bit of that is important or\nwhere I need to spend my most time kinda\n\n480\n00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:26,360\ncategorizing it or prioritizing might\nbe a better term for listing out\n\n481\n00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,540\nthe importance of the different types of\ndata or the evidence that I wanna collect.\n\n482\n00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,840\nAnd we also talked a little about the anti\nforensics there, so any method really,\n\n483\n00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,010\ncomes down to it any method\nthat we'll hopefully circumvent\n\n484\n00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:43,260\nany forensic investigation, or tying\nthat evidence back to me for example.\n\n485\n00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,930\nIncluding encryption, steganography,\nall kinds of things there.\n\n486\n00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,050\n>> And remember by the way,\nwe didn't mention it quite yet, but\n\n487\n00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,300\njust to give you a peek\naround the corner here.\n\n488\n00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:59,200\nYeah, if you have a volatile evidence,\nyou've non-volatile evidence, too.\n\n489\n00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,800\nWe just haven't talked about that yet.\n\n490\n00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,990\nSo there's two sides to that coin,\nwe just haven't got there yet\n\n491\n00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:10,090\nbecause that's another topic that needs\nto be flushed out more fully than we have\n\n492\n00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,380\ntime to squeeze in here.\n\n493\n00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,980\n>> Yeah, and that's probably a good segue.\n\n494\n00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,690\nSpeaking of time, it's about time for\nus to take a break.\n\n495\n00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,740\nSo why don't we stop here.\n\n496\n00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,250\nWhen we come back, we're going to\ntalk about types of digital evidence.\n\n497\n00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,147\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n498\n00:27:22,147 --> 00:27:29,238\n[MUSIC]\n\n499\n00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:31,390\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n500\n00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,720\nSo this segment, we are going to\ntalk about digital evidence, and\n\n501\n00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,280\nall the different types of digital\nevidence that we are going to have to\n\n502\n00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,480\ndeal with as a digital\nforensic investigator.\n\n503\n00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,430\nSo Sean, where do we start?\n\n504\n00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,580\nLots of different types of\n\n505\n00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,770\ndigital evidence that we're\ngonna have to deal with, right?\n\n506\n00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,580\n>> Yeah,\nit's definitely not all created equal.\n\n507\n00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,620\nAs far as the type of information,\n\n508\n00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,870\nvolatile, nonvolatile you've been through,\nyeah, we have that.\n\n509\n00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,055\nBut, now we have to talk about it's\nreally a kind of admissibility.\n\n510\n00:27:59,055 --> 00:28:00,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n511\n00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,930\n>> That's a big part of it, just because\nyou've got it doesn't mean any way, shape,\n\n512\n00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,940\nor form, it's gonna be admissible.\n\n513\n00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,550\nIt may not be even be reliable, so\n\n514\n00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:13,400\nthere's a number of factors that\ncan impact that as we're gonna see.\n\n515\n00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,510\nThe reason why we're\ntalking about it now is,\n\n516\n00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,040\nwe are gonna start collecting\nsome of this evidence.\n\n517\n00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,370\nI mean, that's what's coming up.\n\n518\n00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,460\nBut we need to know what\nthe different types are,\n\n519\n00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,680\nso we could be prepared when we see them.\n\n520\n00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,720\nYeah, so that's what we have.\n\n521\n00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,000\nAnd this can get kind of sticky really\nquick, I'm gonna tell you that.\n\n522\n00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,100\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n523\n00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,400\nOne, it's not the most exciting part of\nour episodes that we have coming up, but\n\n524\n00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,350\nother than that, you get into court and\nyou're going to fight over the evidence.\n\n525\n00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:46,140\nAnd whether it's best evidence or\nhearsay or whatever the case may be.\n\n526\n00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,740\nSo it's not kind of cut and\ndry definitions sometimes, right?\n\n527\n00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,640\n>> Yeah, it's not.\n\n528\n00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,880\nThis is legalese in the purest\nform is what we're seeing here.\n\n529\n00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,240\nAnd we've done our best here\nto kind of distill it down.\n\n530\n00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,000\nSo it's something that we can\nall be on a level playing field.\n\n531\n00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,960\nSome of you will probably\nbe more proficient\n\n532\n00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,340\nat understanding these evidence types, and\nthat's totally cool that you have that.\n\n533\n00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,825\nI mean heck, if we have a lawyer\nin here you can leave night now.\n\n534\n00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:19,040\n>> [LAUGHTER].\n\n535\n00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,180\n>> No, but if we have a lawyer\nhere he might go way out\n\n536\n00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,960\non all different sorts of things,\nand that's fine too.\n\n537\n00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,390\nYou know, but, we do at least need to know\nthat there's different categories that\n\n538\n00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:36,200\nare going to impact how we do things,\nwhy we do things in the first place.\n\n539\n00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,210\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n540\n00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,920\nSo really, I think one of the biggest\nclassifications probably is just\n\n541\n00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,800\nadmissible evidence, right?\n\n542\n00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,035\nAnd I think of admissible evidence\nas that all evidence, or no?\n\n543\n00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,235\n>> No, it's not.\n\n544\n00:29:48,235 --> 00:29:49,425\nIt really isn't.\n\n545\n00:29:49,425 --> 00:29:53,465\nIf you kind of look at it,\nyeah, you have all evidence,\n\n546\n00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:56,705\nthen you've got kind of your reliable\nevidence and then you have stuff that can\n\n547\n00:29:56,705 --> 00:30:01,065\neven be admissible, you can collect\nsomething and be 100% correct and\n\n548\n00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:06,940\naccurate in how you did things, preserved\nit and everything, but you may not have\n\n549\n00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,450\ncollected it within the guidelines\nof what you were mandated to do.\n\n550\n00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,930\nIt could be one of the things we're gonna\nget into more in detail as we go through\n\n551\n00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,560\nis talking about search warrants.\n\n552\n00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,490\nSearch warrants,\nthey are pretty specifically written.\n\n553\n00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,610\nThat stuff that you see is like, oh,\nI'm just going to go and search a house.\n\n554\n00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,400\nThat isn't, that isn't going to fly.\n\n555\n00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,900\nThat doesn't happen.\n\n556\n00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,260\nYou have to when you write a search\nwarrant has to be written in such a way\n\n557\n00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,220\nin most cases.\n\n558\n00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,930\nI know there's always that\nlittle asterisk south there.\n\n559\n00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,170\nBut in most cases,\nit has to be something that says\n\n560\n00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,230\nthat you can clearly identify what you're\nlooking for, something related to it.\n\n561\n00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:52,620\nIt's kind of like looking at my\nnotebook and Mike's notebook up here.\n\n562\n00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,310\nWe have these two systems up here.\n\n563\n00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,870\nIf you say you're looking for\na notebook, how do you know?\n\n564\n00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,870\nHow do you know?\n\n565\n00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,330\nI mean this could be the one you're\nlooking for and you grab that one.\n\n566\n00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,860\nThat's gonna be a problem.\n\n567\n00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,730\n>> Yeah, it's not a notebook.\n\n568\n00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,900\nWait a second.\n\n569\n00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,584\n>> Yeah.\nIf you collect that one,\n\n570\n00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:12,921\nhe's not involved and\nmaybe I'm the one that did something.\n\n571\n00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:14,860\nI am the one that did something.\n\n572\n00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:20,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so they collect his notebook.\n\n573\n00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,710\nThey've violated his rights.\n\n574\n00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,460\nThey've taken something in there.\n\n575\n00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,610\nThat will not be admissible in court.\n\n576\n00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,390\nSo, even though they've collected and\n\n577\n00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,630\npreserved stuff in there, anything they've\ngot is gonna be deemed inadmissible.\n\n578\n00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,894\nNow, if by the same token, if they collect\nmy notebook here and then they see, oh,\n\n579\n00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:44,180\nwell while we're here, there's something\nelse that might be worth collecting.\n\n580\n00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,278\nThat, and if they go ahead and\ndecide to do that,\n\n581\n00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,747\nthat's going to be something that\ncauses it to be admissible as well.\n\n582\n00:31:51,747 --> 00:31:57,533\nYeah, that's, you got something that\nshows clearly that He did such and\n\n583\n00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:01,172\nsuch, but\nbecause you didn't collect it, or\n\n584\n00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:06,440\nyou collected it without permission,\nits inadmissible.\n\n585\n00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,730\nYes, there's different\nshades of gray in here.\n\n586\n00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,911\nI do know that.\n\n587\n00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:12,597\nThere's probably some of you\nout here going, oh, well.\n\n588\n00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:17,312\nHold on, I looked this up,\nI'm well aware of that.\n\n589\n00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:21,941\n>> When we talk about admissible evidence\nthis is really any evidence that's\n\n590\n00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:25,980\npresented in front of the,\nI think Cornell University defines it\n\n591\n00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,320\nas any evidence presented,\ndid it in front of the trier of fact.\n\n592\n00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,080\nIn US, we're talking about our judges.\n\n593\n00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,430\n>> That sounds awesome.\n\n594\n00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,190\n>> I know, right?\n\n595\n00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,185\n>> Trier of fact, sounds like Dungeons and\nDragons, or something like that.\n\n596\n00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:40,130\n>> But, it's really anything that's\naccepted by the court of law.\n\n597\n00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,400\nRight?\nAnd that could vary from region to region,\n\n598\n00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,000\nfrom different country, to country what\nthey accept as immiscible evidence.\n\n599\n00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,240\nWhen we say immiscible.\n\n600\n00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,440\nIt's really not a particular type, like\na file versus a photo versus whatever.\n\n601\n00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,890\nIt's is the court going to\naccept that type of evidence?\n\n602\n00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,620\nLike me writing down something\nthat I saw on a piece of paper.\n\n603\n00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,275\nMight be a fact, might be true, but it\nmight not be admissible in a court of law.\n\n604\n00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:04,895\nSo that's what we're talking about here.\n\n605\n00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:09,315\nAdmissible evidence is evidence\nthat's accepted by whoever it is,\n\n606\n00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:10,895\nthe trying body.\n\n607\n00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:15,019\nWhether that's in a corporation with\na group of people that gets together and\n\n608\n00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:18,698\ndecides the fate of you as an employee,\nor whether that's a judge and\n\n609\n00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:19,913\na jury in a court room.\n\n610\n00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:22,951\nIs that evidence something that\nthey're gonna take into consideration,\n\n611\n00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:25,561\nI think is really what admissible\nevidence is really all about.\n\n612\n00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:28,430\n>> Yeah, that's exactly what it means.\n\n613\n00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,300\nJust because you have something doesn't\nmean it's something that's allowed to be\n\n614\n00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,850\nadmitted in that situation.\n\n615\n00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,870\nFor example, something that we're\ngonna talk about in a few moments is,\n\n616\n00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,400\ncan you present an original or\na copy, in a lot of situations,\n\n617\n00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,080\neven though your copy has been\nproven mathematically, forensically,\n\n618\n00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,350\neverything as being identical\nto the original, you cannot,\n\n619\n00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,320\nif you have possession to the original,\npresent the copy.\n\n620\n00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,250\nIt's gonna be inadmissible.\n\n621\n00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,730\n>> Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n622\n00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,630\nSo we've got admissible evidence.\n\n623\n00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,700\nAnd then, another term that you're gonna\nhear that we need to be familiar with,\n\n624\n00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,420\nis relative evidence.\n\n625\n00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,473\nAnd we can probably, for\nthose who know English word relevant.\n\n626\n00:34:10,473 --> 00:34:14,606\nIs that evidence relevant to this\nparticular case, I might have evidence of\n\n627\n00:34:14,606 --> 00:34:18,884\nsomething, but it has no bearing on\nwhat we're trying to decide, all right.\n\n628\n00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:22,930\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right as well.\n\n629\n00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:29,030\nYou may have, you collect\nevidence as part of your process.\n\n630\n00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,100\nYou collect evidence off of a computer,\nlet's say.\n\n631\n00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,540\nAnd you're harvesting files, and\n\n632\n00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:39,355\nyou find something that's\nevidence of a specific Crime.\n\n633\n00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:43,825\nIn addition or up and above what\nyou've been tasked to look for, and\n\n634\n00:34:43,825 --> 00:34:48,505\nwhat they're trying to prosecute or\ndefend whichever side you're on.\n\n635\n00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:53,645\nWell, the thing is is that when, is that\nif it's not relevant to that situation,\n\n636\n00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:57,215\ndoesn't do anything to support or\nsupport that case or\n\n637\n00:34:57,215 --> 00:35:00,560\nhave any bearing on that case,\nthat's probably gonna get tossed out.\n\n638\n00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,530\nThe judge can very well toss that out.\n\n639\n00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:07,700\nAnd it could also be done, interestingly\nenough, well not surprisingly really when\n\n640\n00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:14,190\nyou think about it, they may throw out\nevidence that's not, relevant to a case,\n\n641\n00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:20,220\nnot just because it's not relevant\nbecause it can also taint the jury pool.\n\n642\n00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,070\nI mean, they can say for\n\n643\n00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:29,570\nexample you may have seen or\nheard this type of stuff happen,\n\n644\n00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:34,710\nwhen you read about court cases, or\nthey've even dramatized it on TV,\n\n645\n00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:40,130\none of the attorneys will say,\nhey your honor, this person did this and\n\n646\n00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:45,270\nthis at such a couple years ago\nat such and such a date and time.\n\n647\n00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,180\nSo that they have evidence that\nshows this pattern of behavior.\n\n648\n00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,260\nWell, that case was solved,\n\n649\n00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,660\nwas negotiated, settled out of court,\neverything else.\n\n650\n00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,640\nIt's a done thing, but by the fact\nthat someone's thrown that into you,\n\n651\n00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,550\nthrown that into your head as a jury,\nthey've influenced your thinking,\n\n652\n00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:10,570\nso a judge can toss that out and\nsay no, I'm not gonna allow it, and\n\n653\n00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,080\nthen you hear the sayings where,\nhey, the jury will disregard that.\n\n654\n00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,620\nIt's because someone may been\ntrying to influence that.\n\n655\n00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,925\nThat's why you'll see, at least some of my\nfriends tell me, you'll see a lawyer throw\n\n656\n00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:24,882\nsomething out there, even though they\nknow it's not gonna get accepted because\n\n657\n00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:28,805\nthey know if they just get it in the air,\nit might be able to influence somebody.\n\n658\n00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:30,106\n>> We're gunning for a mistrial right?\n\n659\n00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:31,162\nWe're gunning for a mistrial.\n\n660\n00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:32,430\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, do something.\n\n661\n00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,610\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n662\n00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:39,440\nSo we got, we've got admissible evidence,\nevidence that can be used in, whether\n\n663\n00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,060\nit's a court of law or something else, but\nany type of evidence that's acceptable.\n\n664\n00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,650\nWe've got our relevant evidence,\n\n665\n00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:49,570\nwhich just means it's evidence that\npertains to this particular case,\n\n666\n00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,660\nit's not something that has something\nto do with another case or even, okay,\n\n667\n00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:58,230\nI found a picture of the defendant.\n\n668\n00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,210\nOn a boat and he just caught a fish.\n\n669\n00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,020\nWell great.\n\n670\n00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,640\nAnd it has nothing to do\nwith the case at hand.\n\n671\n00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,020\nSo it's not gonna be\nconsidered relative evidence.\n\n672\n00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,920\nAnd then something we touched on earlier,\n\n673\n00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,640\nwe need to talk about computer\ngenerated verses computer stored.\n\n674\n00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,820\nWhen it comes to digital evidence as well,\nright?\n\n675\n00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,730\n>> Yeah, we've tweaked that just a bit.\n\n676\n00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,480\nWe were talking earlier,\nit's in the same lines though, so\n\n677\n00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,350\nit's not like we're covering brand new\nground here trying to confuse you.\n\n678\n00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:31,460\nWe talk about computer generated and\nhuman generated.\n\n679\n00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,363\nBut we also have computer generated and\n\n680\n00:37:35,363 --> 00:37:40,520\ncomputer stored, so\nthere's a little bit of difference there.\n\n681\n00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,310\nBut it's along the same\nlines that we talked about,\n\n682\n00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,180\nand they do consider\nevidence in these terms.\n\n683\n00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,090\nComputer generate is obviously, well,\nthe computer's running an application or\n\n684\n00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:52,080\nsomething, and\nit generates as part of that functioning.\n\n685\n00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,140\nIt doesn't require you to do\nanything to initiate that creation.\n\n686\n00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,280\nComputer stored means, heck we'll use\nthe photos you were talking about.\n\n687\n00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,980\nYou just threw them up\non a server some place.\n\n688\n00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,780\nThat server didn't create that data,\nyou just stuck it up there and\n\n689\n00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,050\nused it as a container to hold it.\n\n690\n00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,420\n>> Okay, so our computer generated\nmight be things like log files,\n\n691\n00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,870\nmetadata that gets modified.\n\n692\n00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:18,320\nOr something like that, so the computer\nis actually generating that information,\n\n693\n00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,180\nthat we want to try to use as evidence.\n\n694\n00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:25,580\nComputer stored then, would just be\nthe fact that maybe it's my plans for\n\n695\n00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,960\nthe attack or something like that.\n\n696\n00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,440\nI wrote up a Word document and\nstored it onto the computer.\n\n697\n00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,810\nSo it wasn't generated by the computer,\n\n698\n00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,710\nbut it was stored and\nfound on a computers.\n\n699\n00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,510\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n700\n00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:38,630\nThat's exactly what it would mean is\nthat either the computer generated it or\n\n701\n00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,030\nyou just stuck it up there.\n\n702\n00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,910\nThe data's there.\n\n703\n00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,060\nIt's just what was the mechanism\nof action of how it got there.\n\n704\n00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:45,950\n>> All right.\n\n705\n00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,570\nWhat about this best evidence.\n\n706\n00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,010\nI heard that term before.\n\n707\n00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,780\nBest evidence.\n\n708\n00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,470\nWhat do we mean by that?\n\n709\n00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,440\n>> Best evidence.\n\n710\n00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,220\nIt's kinda a funny term.\n\n711\n00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,560\nI've always found this kind of a really\nfunny term, best evidence, it's like,\n\n712\n00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,690\nbest evidence, well,\nisn't it all the best evidence?\n\n713\n00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,410\nIf it's relevant to the case and\nadmissible,\n\n714\n00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,210\nthat's the best evidence you can have,\nright?\n\n715\n00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:11,430\nThe smoking gun, no it's not really that,\nunfortunately it's not that easy.\n\n716\n00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:17,570\nBest evidence means it's something, in\njust about every case means it's original,\n\n717\n00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:23,130\nit's the original data,\nor whatever you got.\n\n718\n00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,262\nI want to say original copy,\nbut that just sounds\n\n719\n00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:28,240\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n720\n00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,920\n>> It's basically if I've got, my computer\nhere and I take the hard drive out of it.\n\n721\n00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,940\nThat hard drive, as part of my analysis,\n\n722\n00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,470\nI am never gonna work, ever,\never work on an original.\n\n723\n00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:46,900\nAnd that's something that's coming up for\nus is that you never,\n\n724\n00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,610\never do your analysis on your originals.\n\n725\n00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,700\nWhat you will do is you'll make, for\n\n726\n00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,910\nexample, this hard drive situation,\nI would make two copies of it.\n\n727\n00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,976\nAnd then I would work off the copies.\n\n728\n00:39:57,976 --> 00:39:59,967\nIf I destroyed one copy, what do I do?\n\n729\n00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,643\nI go to the other copy that I verified and\nmake another one.\n\n730\n00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:04,094\nI never touch the original.\n\n731\n00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:08,094\nNow when time comes that I go to court,\nI'm going to bring out\n\n732\n00:40:08,094 --> 00:40:13,300\nthis hard drive that's got all\nthe documentation to show where it was.\n\n733\n00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,100\nThe chain of custody is\nwhat they call that.\n\n734\n00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,540\nWe're gonna show where it was,\nwho had it, and all that good stuff.\n\n735\n00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:25,390\nThat's something that is going to\nbe presented with that evidence.\n\n736\n00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,420\nAnd so that's considered to be best\nevidence is when it's the original,\n\n737\n00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,100\nit's documented and everything else.\n\n738\n00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,257\nThe results, you can show have\nbeen done off of copies but\n\n739\n00:40:35,257 --> 00:40:38,213\nyou can't with the copies of the court.\n\n740\n00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:43,880\nUnless, and there's always an unless\nin these situations right?\n\n741\n00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,330\nUnless they specifically say you're\nallowed to bring in the copy or\n\n742\n00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:53,360\nfrom some reason, the original got\ndestroyed or what have you in the,\n\n743\n00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,200\nand through whatever means I mean,\nyou better show why it was destroyed.\n\n744\n00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,335\nI'm not talking hey, someone shoved some\npaperwork through a shredder or something.\n\n745\n00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:05,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It could be, and we've done this.\n\n746\n00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,690\nWe have different types of data.\n\n747\n00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,570\nWe talk about different types\nof data we can collect.\n\n748\n00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,940\nWhat's one case where you would\nhave copies not the original?\n\n749\n00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,920\nWe talked about this, right?\n\n750\n00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,830\n>> Oh, yeah.\nWith our, hm no.\n\n751\n00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,000\nMy short term memory is iffy.\n\n752\n00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,650\n>> Okay.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n753\n00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,190\n>> I told you no carbohydrates at lunch.\n\n754\n00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,880\nWell, it's memory.\n\n755\n00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,153\n>> Oh yes, thank you.\n\n756\n00:41:32,153 --> 00:41:35,000\n[LAUGH] I was doing that intentionally.\n\n757\n00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,200\n>> That was skillful.\n\n758\n00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,940\nThat was like a ninja.\n\n759\n00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,920\n>> My original memory is gone but we could\nuse Sean's recollection of the fact.\n\n760\n00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,670\n>> Exactly.\n\n761\n00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,110\n>> That would be best\nevidence in this case, right?\n\n762\n00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:51,590\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so if we want to put the\nlegal definition of best evidence, like,\n\n763\n00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,965\nagain I'll give you guys the link to\nthe Cornell University Law school, but\n\n764\n00:41:55,965 --> 00:41:57,885\nyou can find it in any legal book.\n\n765\n00:41:57,885 --> 00:42:01,445\nMy brother would be proud of me, cuz my\nbrother is a lawyer by the way so, I know.\n\n766\n00:42:01,445 --> 00:42:02,825\n>> I'll need his number.\n\n767\n00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:05,815\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] You know when somebody wants\n\n768\n00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,095\nto admit evidence and\n\n769\n00:42:07,095 --> 00:42:11,725\nthe original is not available,\nthen we go with this best evidence.\n\n770\n00:42:11,725 --> 00:42:13,830\nAnd so really it's not saying,\ncuz I am with you,\n\n771\n00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:18,210\nI always thought best evidence that's\nthe best kind of evidence I can have.\n\n772\n00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,320\nNo it's actually not.\n\n773\n00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,920\nBest evidence means I don't\nhave the original but\n\n774\n00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,838\nI've got something that's just as good as,\nor it's the best I can do at this point.\n\n775\n00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:30,730\nAnd as Sean says, your going to have to\nhave a very good reason for not being able\n\n776\n00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:35,650\nto produce the original and to have\nthat best evidence accepted, I think.\n\n777\n00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:42,640\n>> And to be fair, some jurisdictions,\nyou actually are allowed to admit\n\n778\n00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,740\nthat evidence but\nyou have to know if that's the case.\n\n779\n00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,900\nBut you know,\nmemory is a prime example of it.\n\n780\n00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,470\nWhen that computer is turned off,\nthat goes bye bye.\n\n781\n00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,310\nSo all you have is the memory dump.\n\n782\n00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:00,410\nSo that could be, and that's something\nwhere you don't have best evidence.\n\n783\n00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,280\nBut that's something that's been\naccounted for, the memory issue.\n\n784\n00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,330\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n785\n00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,970\nAll right ladies and gentlemen,\nlooking at the clock it's about time for\n\n786\n00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:08,690\nus to take a break.\n\n787\n00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,970\nSo we're gonna step away for a second, and\n\n788\n00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,010\nwhen we come back,\nmore types of digital evidence.\n\n789\n00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:22,351\nSo stay tuned.\n[MUSIC]\n\n790\n00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:23,100\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n791\n00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,320\nContinuing on with talking\nabout digital evidence and\n\n792\n00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,700\ndifferent types of digital evidence\nthat we're gonna have to deal with.\n\n793\n00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,450\nI think the next one on our list was,\nwe talked about computers,\n\n794\n00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,510\nwe talked about best.\n\n795\n00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,890\nHearsay maybe.\n\n796\n00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,215\n>> Yeah, hearsay is another-\n>> Or so he said.\n\n797\n00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:39,715\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n798\n00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:40,355\nOr so I\n\n799\n00:43:40,355 --> 00:43:41,000\nsaid.\nNice.\n\n800\n00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,208\n>> You like that?\n\n801\n00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:44,570\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah say.\n\n802\n00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:46,590\nWe're doing our best with this\npeople to make it exciting.\n\n803\n00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,410\n>> We are trying, we really are.\n\n804\n00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,135\n>> Yeah, you should see the look of\nexcitement of the people back here.\n\n805\n00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:53,020\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's if you could pick it with\n\n806\n00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,750\na stick\n>> Right?\n\n807\n00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:54,946\n>> And then they fall over.\n\n808\n00:43:54,946 --> 00:44:00,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But what hearsay evidence is,\n\n809\n00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:06,170\nit means that you've heard it kind\nof secondhand, or got it secondhand.\n\n810\n00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,080\nYou weren't there to witness the event.\n\n811\n00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:14,420\nYou heard it from someone who\nthemselves witnessed the event.\n\n812\n00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,030\nThat's a really good way\nto kinda look at it.\n\n813\n00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,400\nIt's kinda like when you talk\nto your buddy, or whatever,\n\n814\n00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,390\nand they tell you something\nthat happened that day to them.\n\n815\n00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:29,760\nWell, you weren't there to see that\npresumably, so they tell you that.\n\n816\n00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,530\nIf you repeat it to someone else,\nwell that's hearsay.\n\n817\n00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:38,510\nYou didn't see it with your own eyes,\nit's considered that.\n\n818\n00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:46,340\nAs far as evidence goes, it can be kind of\ntricky to get that admitted as evidence.\n\n819\n00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,970\nIt is admitted as evidence but\n\n820\n00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:51,650\nit's also not admitted as\nevidence to In the situation.\n\n821\n00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:56,660\nAnd if it is admitted,\nit almost always carries a low priority.\n\n822\n00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:02,210\nIf you're relying on hearsay\nto prove your case, you know,\n\n823\n00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:03,750\nthose are some pretty long odds.\n\n824\n00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,180\nYou might do it but don't count on it.\n\n825\n00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,876\nYou might have a better chance to win\nthe lottery a couple dozen times in a row.\n\n826\n00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know.\n\n827\n00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:15,130\nSo but, not to say it hasn't happened.\n\n828\n00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,830\nBut it's tough.\n\n829\n00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,910\nNow, how does that translate\ninto the digital world?\n\n830\n00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,810\nIt's kind of an interesting one.\n\n831\n00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,990\nYou have a lot of evidence\nin the digital world\n\n832\n00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:32,000\nthat you may not realize\nis hearsay on the surface.\n\n833\n00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,860\nOne of the really good\nexamples of it is log files.\n\n834\n00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,630\nLog files,\nthink about what a log file's doing.\n\n835\n00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,490\nA log file very clearly is fitting\n\n836\n00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,700\nthe same situation I talked about where\nI told you something to them that day.\n\n837\n00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,720\nA log file's telling you\nsomething on that system.\n\n838\n00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,405\nYou weren't there to witness it,\nit just told you.\n\n839\n00:45:53,405 --> 00:45:54,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n840\n00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,050\n>> I never looked at it that way.\n\n841\n00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:00,700\nYeah, it's one of those little details,\nand most people wouldn't, you know,\n\n842\n00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,480\nthe first time I heard that,\nsame reaction.\n\n843\n00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,200\nI'm like, oh cut the b.s.,\n\n844\n00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,470\nthat's direct evidence right\nthere of something happening.\n\n845\n00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,440\nThat is your best evidence.\n\n846\n00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,970\nAnd like no it's not.\n\n847\n00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,860\nYou know, because it's hearsay,\ncuz you didn't witness it.\n\n848\n00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,440\nIt's something that you reviewed that\ntold you when such and such a time and\n\n849\n00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,550\ndate it happened.\n\n850\n00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:25,629\n>> Interesting.\n>> So, but it can transition\n\n851\n00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:30,260\ninto best evidence, and\nsometimes they also call it,\n\n852\n00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,540\nthey don't necessarily\nclassified as best evidence.\n\n853\n00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,960\nThey may call it direct evidence which\nis a little slightly in the legal\n\n854\n00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,630\nterm and different.\n\n855\n00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,430\nA little different\ncharacterization than best.\n\n856\n00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,115\nBest is still better than.\n\n857\n00:46:41,115 --> 00:46:42,845\n[LAUGH] Best is still better.\n\n858\n00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:44,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Best is still considered to carry more\n\n859\n00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,590\nweight than direct evidence.\n\n860\n00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:51,430\nBut the way you would convert\na log file from hearsay\n\n861\n00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:57,190\nto a more stronger form of evidence,\nis techniques like hashing.\n\n862\n00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,920\nCuz hashing will tell you that it hasn't\nchanged, and yes, indeed it did happen.\n\n863\n00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,390\nBecause you've got here,\n\n864\n00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:06,530\none of the things, remember that\nthing they gave you in grade school?\n\n865\n00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,840\nWhere they would have\nyou sit in a circle or\n\n866\n00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:15,090\na line and the teacher would\ntell someone on one end a story.\n\n867\n00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,920\nThen you turned and told the next person\nin line, going right down the line.\n\n868\n00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,600\nBy the end, someone's got some really\noff the wall thing and it's like,\n\n869\n00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,685\nthat's not what I said.\n\n870\n00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:22,390\n>> [LAUGH] True.\n\n871\n00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:25,800\nThat's the concern with hearsay.\n\n872\n00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,060\nAs it passes through,\nits reliability is already in question.\n\n873\n00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,140\nAs is it passes through,\nthere may be alterations done.\n\n874\n00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,300\nSo we have to do something to maintain and\n\n875\n00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,550\nprove the credibility of the evidence,\nthe reliability of it.\n\n876\n00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,160\nSo hashing would definitely do that.\n\n877\n00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,416\nIf you understand hashing,\n\n878\n00:47:42,416 --> 00:47:48,058\nit's you know that it's a way of\nverifying the state of a piece of data.\n\n879\n00:47:48,058 --> 00:47:53,008\nAnd once you've done that with the file,\nthen it's really,\n\n880\n00:47:53,008 --> 00:47:55,491\nthere's no getting out of it.\n\n881\n00:47:55,491 --> 00:47:57,883\nIf someone says, well,\nhow do I know you didn't change that?\n\n882\n00:47:57,883 --> 00:48:01,326\nWell, here's the hash it was before,\nand I recovered it off the system and\n\n883\n00:48:01,326 --> 00:48:02,045\npreserved it.\n\n884\n00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:07,210\nHere is what I hashed over there,\nit's the same hash.\n\n885\n00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:11,080\nI mean you're a [INAUDIBLE] you've gotta\ngo and explain hashing to somebody.\n\n886\n00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,390\nOr, you can play my cryptography course\nwith a premium membership in court\n\n887\n00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,990\ncoming up in two weeks.\n\n888\n00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,763\n>> Yeah.\n>> Exactly, it's called marketing.\n\n889\n00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,150\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n890\n00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,280\nSo.\n\n891\n00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,520\nSo here the evidence, in general, is out\nof court statements about something or\n\n892\n00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,210\na statement provided to prove something.\n\n893\n00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:36,290\nBut generally not accepted as evidence\nunless you've got a really good case for\n\n894\n00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:40,270\nwhy it should be accepted and\nit's gonna be on a per case scenario.\n\n895\n00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,800\nIt's not like there's a rule that says\nthis is always gonna be accepted.\n\n896\n00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,980\nSo here's a not generally accepted as\nevidence, could be used I think to\n\n897\n00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,350\nend up proving other things, but I was\nlaughing earlier on, I don't know if we\n\n898\n00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,039\ncaught me on camera here, I was reading\nthrough some of the Cornell stuff.\n\n899\n00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:00,890\nThey give an example of a car crash,\nand a passerby of the car crash,\n\n900\n00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:06,900\nthe victim in the car crash gets out and\nhollers out, Martians caused the accident.\n\n901\n00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,310\nAnd so if that person was brought in to\ncourt to say what did that driver say when\n\n902\n00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:14,320\nyou got out of the car, but that's\nhearsay, it's not gonna be admissible.\n\n903\n00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,770\nBut it would prove the fact that\ndriver was able to get out and\n\n904\n00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,500\ntalk after the accident.\n\n905\n00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,930\nSo the-\n>> Yeah.\n\n906\n00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,900\n>> That's the way the hearsay works,\n\n907\n00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,010\nhearsay is not generally accepted\nunless you got a good reason for it.\n\n908\n00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:29,670\nBut it can be used to prove\nother things as well.\n\n909\n00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,420\n>> Interesting.\n\n910\n00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:36,480\n>> Yeah, it's again, we can't say\nit enough here, stress it enough.\n\n911\n00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,540\nThis is where the lawyers actually\nare earn their pay here is that\n\n912\n00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:45,700\nthey've got to straighten\nthis whole spaghetti out.\n\n913\n00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:52,130\nThis is something that's I had to look at\nfor a while to get straight in my head.\n\n914\n00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:55,920\nTalk to a lawyer first they\nhad those resources to it.\n\n915\n00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,865\nThere is something Mike\nis looking at here.\n\n916\n00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:01,456\nThat's-\n>> I'm cheating folks I'm not a lawyer and\n\n917\n00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:05,818\nI don't know these definitions by heart\nI'm definitely cheating here [LAUGH].\n\n918\n00:50:05,818 --> 00:50:07,431\n>> You shouldn't tell them that.\n\n919\n00:50:07,431 --> 00:50:08,655\n>> I know right [LAUGH].\n\n920\n00:50:08,655 --> 00:50:09,823\n>> Let it not matter so.\n\n921\n00:50:09,823 --> 00:50:13,050\nThat's something that does take\na while to straighten out.\n\n922\n00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,199\nAnd then you can add other\nlittle rubs into it I saw that\n\n923\n00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:19,510\nMckaylin here said she was surprised that,\n\n924\n00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:23,707\nI guess she was referring to the fact that\n[CROSSTALK] log files would be hearsay.\n\n925\n00:50:23,707 --> 00:50:24,608\nYou're not the [CROSSTALK] only\none that was surprised by that.\n\n926\n00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:26,570\n>> I was too.\n\n927\n00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:29,710\n>> We were both surprised\nat that situation.\n\n928\n00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:34,020\nThat that would be the case with that.\n\n929\n00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:38,160\nCuz we've been taught as IT people, that's\ndocumentation that something happened.\n\n930\n00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,220\nIn a court of law,\nit doesn't hold that same type of weight.\n\n931\n00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,960\nFor IT and resolving problems and\nall that, that's fine.\n\n932\n00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,680\nNot when a case hangs in the balance.\n\n933\n00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,530\nBut then again, you move,\nas you move from place to place.\n\n934\n00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,900\nThat is very definitely\n\n935\n00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:03,340\ngoing to have an impact on whether\nit's hearsay or something else.\n\n936\n00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,270\nI mean I don't know,\n\n937\n00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:09,650\nI mean I since Mckaley brought up\nto you were surprised at that.\n\n938\n00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,542\nI believe she is in the UK.\n\n939\n00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:12,173\n>> UK, yeah.\n\n940\n00:51:12,173 --> 00:51:15,326\n>> That could be different\nover there in the UK.\n\n941\n00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:18,485\n>> Right.\n>> That's why you have to be familiar with\n\n942\n00:51:18,485 --> 00:51:20,840\nwhat the laws are there.\n\n943\n00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,790\nSo it's tricky.\n\n944\n00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:28,520\nThere's other cases of things that\nare hearsay which you may not realize.\n\n945\n00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,650\nIf you do a bitstream\ncopy of a hard drive,\n\n946\n00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:37,260\nthat would seem that it's an identical\ncopy of that, not unless you hash it.\n\n947\n00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,190\nYou have to do that same thing.\n\n948\n00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:41,680\nBecause how do I know you\ndidn't manipulate that image?\n\n949\n00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,240\nAnd we know as IT people,\nthere's ways to manipulate images.\n\n950\n00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,630\nSo you have to kinda protect\nyourself against that situation.\n\n951\n00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:51,780\nIt's a little, yeah.\n\n952\n00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,740\nIt's a lot crazy.\n\n953\n00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,750\n>> [LAUGH] I like the term legalese.\n\n954\n00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:01,990\nThis is language that's just not used\nanywhere else, and sometimes I think they\n\n955\n00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:05,850\nmake it this complex, just so that you'd\nhave to go through eight years of school,\n\n956\n00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:08,630\nor whatever it is, and\nmake it difficult for us to work with.\n\n957\n00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:12,740\nBut again, for this exam or\nany of the exam we're talking about,\n\n958\n00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:17,510\nif you're looking to taking the CHFI,\nor the CCFP, or something like that.\n\n959\n00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,120\nThey don't expect you to be a lawyer,\nright.\n\n960\n00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,160\nI mean, they expect you to have\nsome basic understanding though,\n\n961\n00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,170\nbecause as that Digital Forensic\nInvestigator, you on the front lines.\n\n962\n00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,950\nYou're dealing with evidence.\n\n963\n00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:28,980\nYou've got to capture it.\n\n964\n00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,820\nYou've got to understand what\nit is that you need to get,\n\n965\n00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,330\nwhat you don't need to get,\nhow we need to handle it.\n\n966\n00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:37,480\nAnd things like that, so that we can\nturn it over to that legal thing, and\n\n967\n00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,680\nlet them do their thing in court.\n\n968\n00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,480\nSo we're not saying you gotta be a lawyer\nand go study everything like that,\n\n969\n00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,810\nbut you do have to have some basic\nunderstanding of this terminology and\n\n970\n00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,650\nhow it plays in our field.\n\n971\n00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:51,490\n>> Yeah to borrow something from earlier,\nor not from earlier,\n\n972\n00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:54,200\nwe had this discussion with CEH,\n\n973\n00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,400\nremember on the first day of that,\n>> Remember the discussion we had about\n\n974\n00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,870\ndefining security?\n\n975\n00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:03,240\nThat we said that, everyone's got\ntheir own idea, you can go out and\n\n976\n00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,240\nask people what security is, and\nallow their own things on it, but\n\n977\n00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,280\nyeah, it's one of those things where, hey,\n\n978\n00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:15,885\nall of us kinda have our vigilant\nsecurity is and all that good stuff.\n\n979\n00:53:15,885 --> 00:53:18,785\nIt's basically like hey I don't\nknow what security is but\n\n980\n00:53:18,785 --> 00:53:21,255\nI'll know it when I see it\nthat's why we have to define it.\n\n981\n00:53:21,255 --> 00:53:26,295\nThat data make sure we are all brought\ninto that all encompassing one page.\n\n982\n00:53:27,925 --> 00:53:32,870\nThe same thing here with all this legal\nease not trying to turn you into lawyers,\n\n983\n00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:36,880\nbut we're trying to make you\nacquainted with this so you know enough\n\n984\n00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,070\nwhen you see those type of things,\nthat you know you should consult a lawyer.\n\n985\n00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:41,570\n>> Exactly.\n\n986\n00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,020\nAnother couple terms we need to\ndefine when it comes to evidence.\n\n987\n00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,910\nI don't know if I can\nsay these guys right.\n\n988\n00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:52,170\nExculpatory and Inculpatory.\n\n989\n00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,325\nI got him.\nI think I nailed him, right?\n\n990\n00:53:53,325 --> 00:53:53,905\n>> Bingo.\n\n991\n00:53:53,905 --> 00:53:55,274\nWe're done.\n>> Exculpatory.\n\n992\n00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:58,145\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we'll say them again, but\n\n993\n00:53:58,145 --> 00:53:59,060\nthat's it.\n\n994\n00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,200\nBut pretty straightforward\nterminology here, all right.\n\n995\n00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,710\nOne of them is going to\neither help the defense, or\n\n996\n00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,100\nthe other one is going to\nhurt the defense, right.\n\n997\n00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,560\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n998\n00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,370\nIt's evidence that when you get it, and\n\n999\n00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:15,620\nreally, if you look at any of\nthese categories we talked about.\n\n1000\n00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:20,940\nThey can be inculpatory,\nwhich provides further strength\n\n1001\n00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:25,510\nto that such and such, or\nwhatever entity committed this act, or\n\n1002\n00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:28,930\nit can be exculpatory,\nwhich weakens that case or\n\n1003\n00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:33,980\ncompletely absolves someone or\nsomething of committing that specific act.\n\n1004\n00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,280\nSo you will hear those two terms, and\nyou can expect to encounter both.\n\n1005\n00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,310\nYou may very well in and\nyou're hired by the defense\n\n1006\n00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:47,470\nto bolster their case, and\nyou may find something that's exculpatory.\n\n1007\n00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:51,891\nNow the thing is is that if you find\nsomething that's exculpatory, yeah,\n\n1008\n00:54:51,891 --> 00:54:55,962\nyou've been hired by The Defense,\nlet's just say that situation,\n\n1009\n00:54:55,962 --> 00:54:57,808\nyou were hired by the defense.\n\n1010\n00:54:57,808 --> 00:55:02,201\nTo exonerate their person or get them\nout keep them from going to jail or\n\n1011\n00:55:02,201 --> 00:55:03,930\nfined or whatever.\n\n1012\n00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:06,870\nSo you get something in your investigation\n\n1013\n00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:10,780\nyou find something that's exculpatory\nsounds like well that goes against\n\n1014\n00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:14,000\nwhat I was supposed to be done\nlets just get rid of that.\n\n1015\n00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000\nYou can't.\n\n1016\n00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,680\nYou can't.\nEven though it's exculpatory,\n\n1017\n00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,450\nyour investigation's uncovered it.\n\n1018\n00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:24,000\nAt that point,\nyou are obligated to present it, period.\n\n1019\n00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,800\n>> And that kinda goes back to\nwhat we were saying earlier.\n\n1020\n00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,920\nAs a Digital Forensic Investigator,\n\n1021\n00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,350\nwe can't presume innocence or\nguilt, or anything like that.\n\n1022\n00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:36,740\nWe're not going in with a preconception\nof whether this person did it or not.\n\n1023\n00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,170\nWe've gotta try to keep that open mind.\n\n1024\n00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,630\nAnd that evidence that we\nfind might be inculpatory.\n\n1025\n00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:44,794\nIt might prove guilt or\nhelp assist prove guilt in some case, but\n\n1026\n00:55:44,794 --> 00:55:47,800\nit very well could turn\nout to be exculpatory,\n\n1027\n00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:53,043\nwhere it's actually proving innocence,\nor proving that it was somebody else,\n\n1028\n00:55:53,043 --> 00:55:57,154\nand not the one that we're charging,\nor trying to go against.\n\n1029\n00:55:57,154 --> 00:55:59,633\nSo, just knowing what those terms mean.\n\n1030\n00:55:59,633 --> 00:56:03,653\nWhen you find that evidence,\nyou've got to- Obviously turn it over to\n\n1031\n00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:06,936\nthe appropriate people, and\nthey'll decide, I guess,\n\n1032\n00:56:06,936 --> 00:56:10,219\nwhat to do with it as far as,\nbut we've seen the law shows,\n\n1033\n00:56:10,219 --> 00:56:14,641\nthe one legal team is obligated to turn\nthat evidence over to the other side, or\n\n1034\n00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:18,150\nwhat have you, and again,\nwe don't have to go there.\n\n1035\n00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:21,530\nWe just have to know that\nsome evidence is inculpatory,\n\n1036\n00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:26,520\nmeaning that it's going to provide\nevidence to the guilt of someone.\n\n1037\n00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,610\nOr it could be exculpatory,\nmeaning it's going to aid in or\n\n1038\n00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:35,260\nprove innocence or\nremove the guilt from somebody.\n\n1039\n00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:40,270\n>> Yeah, that's the situation, and you're\n\n1040\n00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:45,550\ngonna try to be as close to Diogenes\nwith his lamp, searching for truth.\n\n1041\n00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:50,040\nYou're gonna try to be that, or justice\nis blind, try to be that type of stuff.\n\n1042\n00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:55,230\nYou're gonna try to be close to that\nas possible and who you're hired by.\n\n1043\n00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:59,776\nNow, once you've collected it,\npreserved it, analyzed it, and\n\n1044\n00:56:59,776 --> 00:57:03,621\nwritten your documentation and\ngiven it to your client.\n\n1045\n00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:07,571\nAnd, you may be asked to be\nan expert witness at this point,\n\n1046\n00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:10,820\nyou're committed to\npresenting what you have.\n\n1047\n00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:15,820\nNow, the attorneys may coach you to say,\nwell, downplay this, or word it this way,\n\n1048\n00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:19,820\nand there's always that little\nword play that comes in.\n\n1049\n00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,060\nBut, you are obligated to do that.\n\n1050\n00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:26,030\nThere have been cases, by the way,\nwhere, that were, the court,\n\n1051\n00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:29,150\nwhere a forensics technician\nhas been excluded.\n\n1052\n00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:33,197\nThat collect the evidence has been\nexcluded as an expert witness, or\n\n1053\n00:57:33,197 --> 00:57:35,720\nany witness has been brought to the court.\n\n1054\n00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:40,590\nThe attorney brought in someone else\nto actually look at the evidence or\n\n1055\n00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,952\nlook at the report and present it.\n\n1056\n00:57:42,952 --> 00:57:46,805\nAnd there have been cases\nwhere they did that process,\n\n1057\n00:57:46,805 --> 00:57:49,755\nthey left stuff out because it hurt them.\n\n1058\n00:57:49,755 --> 00:57:54,960\nAnd yeah, when the court found\nout that that's what happened.\n\n1059\n00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,360\nYeah, things got really bad for\nsomebody at that point.\n\n1060\n00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,900\n>> You might get hired as an expert for\n\n1061\n00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:07,470\nthe prosecutors, but because of some\nof the evidence that you've turned up,\n\n1062\n00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:11,480\nyou turn out being a witness for\nthe defense side instead, right?\n\n1063\n00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,620\nSo again, basically, we keep an open mind.\n\n1064\n00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:16,633\nWe have to find the evidence\nto present what we found and\n\n1065\n00:58:16,633 --> 00:58:21,362\nit's up for the legal teams to make sense,\nand the courts, to make sense of all that.\n\n1066\n00:58:21,362 --> 00:58:24,165\nAll right, so lots of different types\nof evidence we really dealt with there.\n\n1067\n00:58:24,165 --> 00:58:26,295\nWe talked about admissible and\nrelevant evidence.\n\n1068\n00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:28,635\nWe talked about best evidence,\n\n1069\n00:58:28,635 --> 00:58:32,165\ncomputer generated evidence\nversus computer stored evidence.\n\n1070\n00:58:32,165 --> 00:58:34,385\nWhat else did we talk about, hearsay.\n\n1071\n00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:38,305\nAnd then inculpatory and\nexculpatory type of evidence so\n\n1072\n00:58:38,305 --> 00:58:41,325\njust a lot of terms that we\nneed to be familiar with there.\n\n1073\n00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,680\nNext thing we ought to talk about then\nmight be the federal rules of evidence.\n\n1074\n00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,210\nIn the US we've got our federal\ngovernment rules of evidence, and\n\n1075\n00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:52,740\nthey've got a set of\ndefinitions that they follow.\n\n1076\n00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:58,183\n>> Yes there are a whole group of FREs\nhere for the federal rules of evidence.\n\n1077\n00:58:58,183 --> 00:59:00,192\nThey usually shorten it, FREs.\n\n1078\n00:59:00,192 --> 00:59:05,424\nThat the Feds actually adopted\nsome years ago to standardize\n\n1079\n00:59:05,424 --> 00:59:12,685\nevidence collection procedures and\nboundaries and different things like that.\n\n1080\n00:59:12,685 --> 00:59:14,195\nRelating to evidence.\n\n1081\n00:59:14,195 --> 00:59:19,125\nNow, they established those,\nand the Feds use those, but\n\n1082\n00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:23,925\nit's up to the individual states and\nmunicipalities if they want to do that.\n\n1083\n00:59:23,925 --> 00:59:28,007\nThey're not bound to use to use\nthe federal rules of evidence.\n\n1084\n00:59:28,007 --> 00:59:32,567\nThey can deviate from them as much as\nthey want, or discard them totally.\n\n1085\n00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:38,736\nHowever with that being said,\nthe majority of courts out there,\n\n1086\n00:59:38,736 --> 00:59:44,007\nand jurisdictions,\ndo adhere pretty well to the FREs,\n\n1087\n00:59:44,007 --> 00:59:47,163\nif not wholly adhere to the FREs.\n\n1088\n00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:50,830\nAnd don't worry,\nI know probably a lot of you are like,\n\n1089\n00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:56,148\nif they talk one more thing about is about\nspecifics of law I'll slash my wrists.\n\n1090\n00:59:56,148 --> 00:59:59,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Calm down, we're not gonna do that.\n\n1091\n00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,588\nBut we can kinda mention a couple.\n\n1092\n01:00:04,588 --> 01:00:10,364\nThere's a few here on the list, and\nwe're not to get into any specifics\n\n1093\n01:00:10,364 --> 01:00:15,466\nreally detailed specifics of it but\nthey have things you know,\n\n1094\n01:00:15,466 --> 01:00:21,643\nhow to exclude and including relevant\nevidence, collection of evidence.\n\n1095\n01:00:21,643 --> 01:00:26,426\nIt's got things like definitions\nof different types of evidence.\n\n1096\n01:00:26,426 --> 01:00:28,945\nHeck I should have given\nyou guys the link.\n\n1097\n01:00:28,945 --> 01:00:30,460\n>> We'll make sure to throw that in there.\n\n1098\n01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,660\n>> I'm not talking about that.\n\n1099\n01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,860\nI'm certified.\n\n1100\n01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:33,848\nI don't have to do anything.\n\n1101\n01:00:33,848 --> 01:00:41,760\n[LAUGH] So, there a whole, needless to\nsay there's a bunch of them out there.\n\n1102\n01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,610\nAnd the FRE's obviously are only\ngonna apply here in the US,\n\n1103\n01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:51,320\nif you are in some place\nelse in the world.\n\n1104\n01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,290\nThere's presumably gonna be\nsomething equivalent to that,\n\n1105\n01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:59,130\nsomething that is kind of like a standard\nthat's either provided as a guideline or\n\n1106\n01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,460\nit's directly applied to it.\n\n1107\n01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,923\nEveryone has to do it, or\nmandated everyone has to do that.\n\n1108\n01:01:03,923 --> 01:01:08,064\n>> Right, and even if it's a great\nresource to use, I know they've\n\n1109\n01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:12,680\ngot things in there like test for\nadmissibility, and things like that.\n\n1110\n01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,610\nSo good guidelines that the federal\ngovernment here in the US has put out\n\n1111\n01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,980\nthat we can use.\n\n1112\n01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:20,761\nIt might or might not be enforced upon us,\n\n1113\n01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:25,621\nbut it doesn't mean that we can't\nuse it in our investigation process.\n\n1114\n01:01:25,621 --> 01:01:26,481\n>> Yeah.\n\n1115\n01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:27,375\nAbsolutely.\n\n1116\n01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,790\n>> All right.\nSo we've got our federal rules of evidence\n\n1117\n01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:33,482\nto go along with all our types of\ndigital evidence, all that terminology,\n\n1118\n01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:34,490\nall that fun stuff.\n\n1119\n01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,470\nAnd you should go read every\nsingle one of those rules.\n\n1120\n01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:38,040\nJust kidding.\n\n1121\n01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:38,577\n>> You'll be tested.\n\n1122\n01:01:38,577 --> 01:01:43,505\n>> Yeah, so let's move our attention\nnow away from the legal side and\n\n1123\n01:01:43,505 --> 01:01:47,830\nlet's talk about collecting\npotential evidence.\n\n1124\n01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:50,010\nBecause that's a whole topic there, right?\n\n1125\n01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:54,440\n>> Yeah, that's the can of worms\nthat's getting ready to open.\n\n1126\n01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,230\nThis whole thing of us just talking about\n\n1127\n01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:02,010\nthese different laws,\nthat's coming to its end.\n\n1128\n01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:06,040\nI know a lot of you are throwing\nyour popcorn all around right now.\n\n1129\n01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,920\nIt's coming to an end.\n\n1130\n01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,572\nBecause we have to establish the,\n\n1131\n01:02:10,572 --> 01:02:14,783\ndid you just quote the friendly\nrules of acquisition.\n\n1132\n01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,639\nSo that-\n>> Bravo.\n\n1133\n01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:23,371\nSo we have to talk about these\nthings basically because it\n\n1134\n01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:26,950\nall builds towards what you can collect.\n\n1135\n01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:30,450\nHow you can collect, and as well as I mean\n\n1136\n01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:34,640\nthat the hearsay would be a prime\nexample of collection procedures.\n\n1137\n01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:39,090\nI could tell each and\nevery one of you to go to your system and\n\n1138\n01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:42,630\nlet's just say all other things aside hey.\n\n1139\n01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:46,475\nGrab the lock off your system and\nsend it to me.\n\n1140\n01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:47,346\nOkay?\n\n1141\n01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:50,620\nEveryone of you here would\nknow how to do that.\n\n1142\n01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:53,450\nI don't have any doubt that\nbased on the audience we've had,\n\n1143\n01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:59,650\nyou guys are a very knowledgeable bunch in\nhere, that you would be able to do that.\n\n1144\n01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:04,030\nHowever, with what we just learned,\n\n1145\n01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:08,570\nif it was a case of well I was trying\nto prove something in a court case.\n\n1146\n01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:11,150\nAnd all of you had been impacted\nby a worm or something.\n\n1147\n01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:15,055\nWell that's not good enough just to\nemail it to me cuz someone's gonna say,\n\n1148\n01:03:15,055 --> 01:03:17,740\na judge very well could say or\nan attorney could say,\n\n1149\n01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:21,380\nwell that my client didn't do that,\nyou could not prove it.\n\n1150\n01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,450\nI got prove or disprove off of that.\n\n1151\n01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:26,370\nThat's enough of a question mark that\nnothing's going to move forward from\n\n1152\n01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,450\nthat point.\n\n1153\n01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,152\nSo you would know now at this point,\n\n1154\n01:03:29,152 --> 01:03:33,810\nhey well Sean is trying to prove\nsomething here and take it to court.\n\n1155\n01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,730\nI'm going to help him out by grabbing\nthat log file, hashing it, and\n\n1156\n01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:41,410\nsend the stuff to him so\nthat is verifiable and written in stone.\n\n1157\n01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:43,890\n>> Right, cuz that log file could\nhave been modified in transit,\n\n1158\n01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,550\neither accidentally or maliciously.\n\n1159\n01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:48,468\nBut if you hashed it first, then sent\nit to him and then he gets it and\n\n1160\n01:03:48,468 --> 01:03:49,108\nhe hashes it.\n\n1161\n01:03:49,108 --> 01:03:51,799\nAnd those hash values match,\nnow we can say for\n\n1162\n01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:56,149\nsure that that log file hasn't been\ntampered with or modified in any way and\n\n1163\n01:03:56,149 --> 01:03:59,066\nthen maybe we can get that\nentered in as evidence.\n\n1164\n01:03:59,066 --> 01:04:03,947\nSo a big part of getting the evidence\nis How we go about collecting it,\n\n1165\n01:04:03,947 --> 01:04:08,510\nand using the proper techniques for\ncollecting that evidence.\n\n1166\n01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:15,130\n>> This one I want to interpret this one\nwhat's being said here with David saying\n\n1167\n01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:17,950\nyou're on a system that does log or\nset up for logging.\n\n1168\n01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:23,820\nI'm not sure how you're trying to qualify\nthat, if you have a system that's\n\n1169\n01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:29,660\nset up for logging, is that gonna take\nit from hearsay to something else?\n\n1170\n01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:35,470\nIf that's what you're asking and\nDavid if I'm wrong, please clarify for me.\n\n1171\n01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:39,890\nBut if you're saying a system has\nbeen specifically set up to clear\n\n1172\n01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:43,410\nharvest log files and\nstore them there on that specific box,\n\n1173\n01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:48,680\nis that good enough to convert\nfrom hearsay to something else?\n\n1174\n01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,770\nI'm gonna say no, it's not good enough.\n\n1175\n01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:55,940\nAgain, you know my standing position on\nit is you have to check for yourself.\n\n1176\n01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,270\nBut, I'm gonna say, based on that,\n\n1177\n01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:02,910\nthat is not enough because you just moved\nit from a local system to something else.\n\n1178\n01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:06,970\nYou still haven't closed the gap\non that last bit to make it so\n\n1179\n01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:09,140\nI know it's reliable.\n\n1180\n01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:12,530\n>> We still need to prove that it's\nnot modified whether it comes from\n\n1181\n01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:17,920\nthe system that was the intended attack\nvictim or a system dedicated to logging,\n\n1182\n01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,980\nthe log files are still an issue as far\nas, have they been modified or not?\n\n1183\n01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,455\nI have to be able to prove\nthat they're accurate.\n\n1184\n01:05:24,455 --> 01:05:28,930\nBut, we might even introduce, I'm not a\nlegal person, but we might even introduce\n\n1185\n01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:31,900\nmore trouble if we started moving log\nfiles from one system to another,\n\n1186\n01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:36,950\nthat could introduce the possibility for\ncontamination.\n\n1187\n01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:37,560\nSo-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1188\n01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:43,200\nIf you look at the,\ngood example, the A plus courses.\n\n1189\n01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,920\nIf you know about sectors and\nclusters on a drive and different sizing,\n\n1190\n01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:47,729\nstuff like that.\n\n1191\n01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,800\nYeah, there's theoretically\na standard size\n\n1192\n01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:56,080\nof those things that they typically use.\n\n1193\n01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,810\nAnd I'm kind of painting with a pretty\nbroad brush here just to kind\n\n1194\n01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:02,540\nof prove a point, but those can be\na different size on a different drive,\n\n1195\n01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:06,500\nand if that's the case,\na file could have little change in\n\n1196\n01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,900\nits size reporting on one\nsystem as it does on another.\n\n1197\n01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,420\nAnd if that's the case,\neven though you copied\n\n1198\n01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:17,330\na good pristine copy over to other system,\nit's a different size.\n\n1199\n01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,990\nIt's gonna appear to be a different size.\n\n1200\n01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:22,880\nSo, it could call into question\nif someone sees that saying,\n\n1201\n01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,865\nwell, it's not the same size\nhere as it is over here.\n\n1202\n01:06:25,865 --> 01:06:29,865\nThat's enough of a question that you may\nbe able to explain your way out of it and\n\n1203\n01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:31,415\ndo the mathematics of it.\n\n1204\n01:06:31,415 --> 01:06:32,935\nImagine doing that in front of a jury.\n\n1205\n01:06:32,935 --> 01:06:34,215\n>> Right.\n>> Of laypeople.\n\n1206\n01:06:34,215 --> 01:06:37,310\n>> How can you explain to the jury\nthat these are the exact same files?\n\n1207\n01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:40,480\nJust don't look at the fact\nthat they're not the same size.\n\n1208\n01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,900\nJust ignore that, right?\n\n1209\n01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,020\nI think that means we have\nanother chatroom question,\n\n1210\n01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,730\nin the chatroom from McKayla.\n\n1211\n01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:46,750\nThe seam system,\n\n1212\n01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:50,120\ncollating log from multiple systems,\nprobably along the same lines, right?\n\n1213\n01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,580\nProbably something you're\ngonna have to look into.\n\n1214\n01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,660\nWe do local court systems or\n\n1215\n01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:58,760\nwherever your trying to use this evidence,\nof whether or not they accept it.\n\n1216\n01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,500\nBut I would assume they\nwould have the same issues.\n\n1217\n01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,180\nThey might have built in ways for signing\nthose and making sure that I'm modified,\n\n1218\n01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:07,450\nI don't know, but\nthey're gonna fall under the same logic.\n\n1219\n01:07:08,452 --> 01:07:12,080\n>> Yeah and\n\n1220\n01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:16,780\nit's an interesting enough situation\nwith what you're bringing up, McKayla,\n\n1221\n01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:22,140\nis that having logs for multiple systems,\nwhat that brings into my head\n\n1222\n01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:26,820\nis that even though you haven't hashed it,\nyou've got one log file here and\n\n1223\n01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:29,740\nyou've got an identical log file here and\nhere and here.\n\n1224\n01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:35,410\nThey all are kind of cross validating\nthen in a way, so I still wanna say\n\n1225\n01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:42,390\nit's completely hearsay evidence at that\npoint because that's what my gut tells me.\n\n1226\n01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:45,010\nBut there's something in\nthe back of my head that said,\n\n1227\n01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:48,890\nit might carry a little more weight\nthan just plain old hearsay.\n\n1228\n01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:54,230\nIt may not be considered as being best or\ndirect evidence, but\n\n1229\n01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:58,920\nit makes a little more weight because you\ncan say, well there's isn't just one copy.\n\n1230\n01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,385\nSo you might be able to have a little\nbit of wiggle room there and\n\n1231\n01:08:03,385 --> 01:08:05,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1232\n01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:08,850\n>> That's the way the game is played.\n\n1233\n01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:11,670\n>> Yeah.\n>> But again, if you're presenting in\n\n1234\n01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:17,510\nfront of a jury trial, and\nyou have to talk to the jury about this.\n\n1235\n01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,460\nImagine if I told those of you,\n\n1236\n01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:25,680\nlike if it was a lot of you that were\nin there we're in the CEH course.\n\n1237\n01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,130\nImagine if I told you,\n\n1238\n01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:33,046\ngo grab 12 of your friends and\nexplain to them what session hijacking is.\n\n1239\n01:08:33,046 --> 01:08:36,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Go do it.\n\n1240\n01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,990\nJust pick them at random.\n\n1241\n01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:40,970\nDo the thing with the hat and\nhave them pick stuff out of it.\n\n1242\n01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:43,260\nThen set them in a room and\nexplain session hijack.\n\n1243\n01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:45,100\nWatch how many of them,\ntheir eyes will glaze over.\n\n1244\n01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:49,612\nThat's what's going to happen to a jury\nif you start talking stuff to them.\n\n1245\n01:08:49,612 --> 01:08:52,440\nYou're gonna start talking about stuff,\nabout the stuff and\n\n1246\n01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,330\ntheir eyes will glaze over and\nthey start tuning out,\n\n1247\n01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:59,250\neven though they're not supposed\nto do that, they do that.\n\n1248\n01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:01,740\nSo baffle them with BS,\nas the saying goes, right?\n\n1249\n01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,450\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n1250\n01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,800\nAll right ladies and\ngentlemen, tell you what.\n\n1251\n01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,530\nIt is about time for us to take our break.\n\n1252\n01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:11,620\nStay tuned though, when we come back\nwe're gonna go into a little bit more of\n\n1253\n01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,360\ncollecting potential evidence\nas well as documenting,\n\n1254\n01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,240\nand talk about, like some chain\nof custody and things like that.\n\n1255\n01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,565\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1256\n01:09:20,565 --> 01:09:25,163\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back,\n\n1257\n01:09:25,163 --> 01:09:28,455\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n1258\n01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:30,970\nSo continuing on with our\nearlier line of thought.\n\n1259\n01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:35,340\nWe were talking about that collecting\nevidence and some procedures, or\n\n1260\n01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,800\npotential evidence, I guess.\n\n1261\n01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,500\nThat was really what we were talking about\nthere, And we talked about how we've got\n\n1262\n01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:44,180\nto make sure that we follow the proper\nprocedures for collecting that evidence.\n\n1263\n01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:49,800\nThat really ties into a whole set of,\ntrying to say it without giving it away.\n\n1264\n01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,600\nWe've got to make sure that we're tracking\nthat evidence all the way through\n\n1265\n01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,150\nfrom when it was collected to when it gets\nreturned back to the owner at some point.\n\n1266\n01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:00,170\nWhat are we talking about here Sean?\n\n1267\n01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:04,130\n>> Well, what we have when we're\ncollecting evidence during this\n\n1268\n01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:08,530\nwhole process, we've talked\nabout documentation quite a bit\n\n1269\n01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:13,030\nalready, both directly and indirectly.\n\n1270\n01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:16,510\nDocumentation is kind of the lubrication\nthat makes this whole thing work.\n\n1271\n01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:20,650\nIf you don't have it,\nthis thing falls apart I\n\n1272\n01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:24,980\nwill tell you its better to over-document\nthan it is to under-document.\n\n1273\n01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,740\nI'd rather have someone say,\nI don't need that,\n\n1274\n01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,890\nthan someone say, where the heck is it?\n\n1275\n01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,850\nBecause that's not a good thing to hear.\n\n1276\n01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:32,260\nOkay?\n\n1277\n01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:34,575\nSo one of those big,\n\n1278\n01:10:34,575 --> 01:10:39,940\nhigh-dollar items to have,\nas part of this documentation process,\n\n1279\n01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:45,240\nis this chain of custody capability or\nprocess that needs to be done.\n\n1280\n01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,869\nIt's incredibly important,\nI can't stress that enough.\n\n1281\n01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:53,870\nIt's, and what it's supposed to do,\nand it needs to do is it needs\n\n1282\n01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:59,078\nto say from when you collect\nsomething from a crime scene,\n\n1283\n01:10:59,078 --> 01:11:03,830\nwhere that incidence happened,\nyou can count for\n\n1284\n01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:09,950\nthat evidence for every moment of its\nlife and depending on where you are,\n\n1285\n01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:13,710\nit's either every moment of life\nuntil you present it in court, or\n\n1286\n01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:18,840\nit's every moment in life until you\npresent it back to its original owner.\n\n1287\n01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,220\nOr, this is actually an interesting one,\nthere's always an or.\n\n1288\n01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:24,960\n>> Of course.\nAlways.\n\n1289\n01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,140\n>> If you knew that was coming,\nscore yourself five points.\n\n1290\n01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:32,780\nWhat you have with the chain of custody is\n\n1291\n01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:37,430\nwhat happens if it gets destroyed\nas part of the analysis process?\n\n1292\n01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:39,430\nThat does happen.\n\n1293\n01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:44,070\nYou're probably not gonna\nreturn to someone or\n\n1294\n01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:46,710\nit's something that can't\nbe returned period.\n\n1295\n01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:50,912\nI You're not gonna say, here you go.\n\n1296\n01:11:50,912 --> 01:11:54,690\nYou're gonna have to give them either\nsomething that says, hey, this\n\n1297\n01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:59,440\nis what happened to it, or it's just going\nto be in the closing documentation for\n\n1298\n01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,260\nthe case saying, this is the status\nof that and to heck with that person.\n\n1299\n01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,140\nThey're not getting it.\nIt may not\n\n1300\n01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,185\nbe a case if it is destroyed either.\n\n1301\n01:12:06,185 --> 01:12:12,027\nSometimes it is destroyed during\nprocessing or during normal Cases,\n\n1302\n01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:17,571\nit could be that volatile, but\nit also could be a situation where,\n\n1303\n01:12:17,571 --> 01:12:23,770\nwhat if you were called in to be\na forensic tech on a case that wasn't.\n\n1304\n01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:28,260\nHopefully you never ever ever ever have\nto participate in a case like this where\n\n1305\n01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:34,940\nsomeone went to court and got convicted\nof possessing child pornography.\n\n1306\n01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:37,310\nYou can't possess that, period.\n\n1307\n01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:41,840\nYou're not getting it back,\nit's done, that's destroyed.\n\n1308\n01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,290\nSo, the chain of custody has to account\nfor the fact that it was destroyed and\n\n1309\n01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:49,010\ndisposed of, and that's the end of it.\n\n1310\n01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:53,250\n>> Yeah, I was think like a list of credit\ncard numbers and their owners as well.\n\n1311\n01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:57,600\nOne, you're not gonna return it to\nthe bad guy, obviously, it's not his.\n\n1312\n01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,420\nProbably not gonna return\nit back to the company,\n\n1313\n01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:04,810\nwe're just going to take that evidence and\ndestroy it and make sure that it's not and\n\n1314\n01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:09,310\nwe have to document that, the fact\nthat that evidence has been destroyed.\n\n1315\n01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:12,280\n>> Yes, and that's the name of the game.\n\n1316\n01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:17,105\nNow if we move earlier in\nthe process to where it's actually\n\n1317\n01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:21,505\nto where it's going through its whole\nlifecycle of analysis and all that.\n\n1318\n01:13:21,505 --> 01:13:26,455\nRemember, when we collect this stuff,\nit's collected from a system and\n\n1319\n01:13:26,455 --> 01:13:31,590\nit's documented, it's tagged and\nbagged and throw it into a vault,\n\n1320\n01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:35,790\nand that's where it stays\nuntil it's presented in court.\n\n1321\n01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:37,410\nYou're working off the copies.\n\n1322\n01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:39,850\nYou have to be able to account for\nthat original list.\n\n1323\n01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:43,120\nThat's crucially important.\n\n1324\n01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:48,110\nDepending on the lab situation you may\nwork in, you may work in a shared lab.\n\n1325\n01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:52,430\nThere are situations where you'll\nhave kinda like an arrangement like\n\n1326\n01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:57,610\nI immediately think like a sports\nlocker room or one of the.\n\n1327\n01:13:57,610 --> 01:14:02,660\nOr like a police locker room or something\nwhere you maybe assigned an evidence\n\n1328\n01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:05,840\nlocker that you are the only\none that has access to it.\n\n1329\n01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,770\nOr really technically you and\n\n1330\n01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:11,340\nthe person that is in charge\nof managing that facility.\n\n1331\n01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:13,520\nSo it's very, very tightly controlled.\n\n1332\n01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,320\nThey're not just all laying out there\nin a vault for anyone just to grab\n\n1333\n01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,690\ntheir stuff and no one else's,\nbecause that does call into question.\n\n1334\n01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:23,520\nIf the two of us were working\non different cases and\n\n1335\n01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,360\nwe're both going into a shared locker,\nwho knows?\n\n1336\n01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:31,020\nNeither one of us had a malicious intent\nto mess with the other person's stuff, but\n\n1337\n01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:34,410\nthat indeed may have happened because hey,\nwe made a mistake.\n\n1338\n01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:39,000\nIt happens to the best of us,\nthat does happen.\n\n1339\n01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,800\nSo you want to eliminate that, you may\nhave a locker that's assigned just to you.\n\n1340\n01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,460\nAnd you have a key,\nsomeone else has a key, and that's it.\n\n1341\n01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:48,210\nBut you have to say it was there,\n\n1342\n01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:53,380\nif that person that manages that facility\ngoes into that, that has to be documented,\n\n1343\n01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:56,350\nand typically, they will have those\nthings highly secured and restricted.\n\n1344\n01:14:56,350 --> 01:15:00,450\nThey will have cameras on them,\nall sorts of logs and biometric locks.\n\n1345\n01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:05,780\nIn some cases,\nthey are pretty well locked down,\n\n1346\n01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:09,490\nand because it can blow a whole\nin the case pretty quickly.\n\n1347\n01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:15,930\nNow, the philosophy used to be before\nthat when you have a system and\n\n1348\n01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:21,700\nyou was in your possession,\nyou couldn't have any gaps.\n\n1349\n01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:27,350\nBecause that gave enough of a crack that\na savvy defense attorney could kind of,\n\n1350\n01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:30,320\nwiggle in and start breaking things up.\n\n1351\n01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,790\nNow a days they say,\n\n1352\n01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:38,400\nthey can say minor gaps are not gonna\nsound the death nail of your case.\n\n1353\n01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,400\nBut it's not like, oh well,\nyou have a gap and\n\n1354\n01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,859\nthat gap is five minutes\nversus five hours.\n\n1355\n01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:49,150\nThat's a wild amount of difference.\n\n1356\n01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:52,710\nYou can say for five minutes,\nwell, that's not long enough for\n\n1357\n01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:55,280\nsomeone to compromise that evidence, but\n\n1358\n01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,790\nfive hours is definitely enough time for\nsomeone to compromise that.\n\n1359\n01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:03,130\nSo, that's something\nelse that fits into it.\n\n1360\n01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:08,110\nBut that document will, very easily,\nmake or break your case.\n\n1361\n01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:09,320\nPeople have messed up on that,\n\n1362\n01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:13,170\nand have lost cases that were as\nclose to airtight as you could get.\n\n1363\n01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:15,180\n>> And it's a relatively simple form.\n\n1364\n01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:19,450\nIt's just a matter of making sure that\nyou are entering this information and\n\n1365\n01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:20,250\nkeeping it accurate.\n\n1366\n01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,690\nAnd if I can just pull up the screen.\n\n1367\n01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:25,950\nI went and did a quick Google search I\nthink I got this one from NIST, you can\n\n1368\n01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:30,580\nalso get it from SANS, but it's just an\nevidence chain of custody tracking form.\n\n1369\n01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:33,960\nAnd you can see where I've got\nplaces to fill in case number and\n\n1370\n01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,375\nmaybe who submitting officer or\nperson was.\n\n1371\n01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:37,535\nIs the victim.\n>> It's probably the way.\n\n1372\n01:16:37,535 --> 01:16:38,845\n>> So information about the case.\n\n1373\n01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:40,095\nIf I could interrupt here for a second.\n\n1374\n01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:41,015\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1375\n01:16:41,015 --> 01:16:43,985\n>> The case number that\nyou just talked about.\n\n1376\n01:16:43,985 --> 01:16:49,707\nThat's something that should also be\nbrought up here is that those case numbers\n\n1377\n01:16:49,707 --> 01:16:52,747\nIn organizations they\nare typically standardized.\n\n1378\n01:16:54,057 --> 01:16:56,207\nI will give you kind of a heads up.\n\n1379\n01:16:56,207 --> 01:17:01,017\nDepending on which vendor certification\nyou take, they recommend certain formats.\n\n1380\n01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:04,487\nSo that's kind of like a little gotcha\nthat you may want to research if you're\n\n1381\n01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:07,497\ngonna take a certain, if you're\ngoing after a certain credential.\n\n1382\n01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:13,417\nBut outside of that, there's usually\nsome sort of format that says date,\n\n1383\n01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:16,110\ntime technician.\n\n1384\n01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:19,140\nAnd then could have things like,\nexhibit included as part of that.\n\n1385\n01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:23,280\nAnd if it's an exhibit, like let's\nsay we've got a tower system here,\n\n1386\n01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,290\nwhere a chain of custody\nis being filled out for\n\n1387\n01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:29,090\na server or a tower system\nthat we collected from a site.\n\n1388\n01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:30,660\nThat's not one thing.\n\n1389\n01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:34,000\nWe can't just put on there,\none tower system and blah blah blah.\n\n1390\n01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,090\nYou can't do that.\n\n1391\n01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:37,320\nYou have to say,\nyou have to fully explain that.\n\n1392\n01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,390\nYou have to say well there's the tower,\nThis many cables.\n\n1393\n01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:41,890\nThere was 2 USB cables.\n\n1394\n01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,210\nThere was a digital whatever cable.\n\n1395\n01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:46,130\nYou have to explain that.\n\n1396\n01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:49,830\nAnd that all has to be tagged and\nbagged and stored with it.\n\n1397\n01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:52,720\nYou might have something that says\nexhibit A and then A1, A2, A3,\n\n1398\n01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,830\nand then it could be aa,\nbb, cc, stuff like that,\n\n1399\n01:17:55,830 --> 01:18:01,400\ndepending on how complex it was gonna be.\n\n1400\n01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,480\nSo those things are standardized and\n\n1401\n01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:09,370\nthat shows, that standardization also\nshows organization too, which is key.\n\n1402\n01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:11,340\n>> Yeah, and\nas you can see on this form there,\n\n1403\n01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:14,720\nwe're sort of describing the evidence,\nsays, hey, get conditions,\n\n1404\n01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,920\nmark scratches, so\na way of identifying it.\n\n1405\n01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,050\nYou can't just say western digital hard\ndrive, you might want to give some type of\n\n1406\n01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:24,370\nidentifying marks about that hard drive to\nlet you prove that that was the actual.\n\n1407\n01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:24,870\n>> Serial numbers.\n\n1408\n01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:25,600\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1409\n01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,800\nAnything that we can document about that.\n\n1410\n01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,370\nAnd so once you've got a description\nof the evidence then you come down to\n\n1411\n01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:34,650\nthe chain of custody part and\nthat's what Sean was describing earlier.\n\n1412\n01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:39,280\nIt's just documentation of who\nwas responsible for that evidence\n\n1413\n01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,820\nfrom the time it was collected, all the\nway to the end of its usefulness whether.\n\n1414\n01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:48,280\nThat's used up in the testing process, or\ndestroyed, or returned to the owner, or\n\n1415\n01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:52,390\nreturned to the court system, or presented\nin court, we've gotta document that.\n\n1416\n01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:56,340\nSo if I collect it, but I'm not the one\nthat's transporting it back to the lab,\n\n1417\n01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:00,440\nI'm gonna most likely sign the fact\nthat I have collected this evidence,\n\n1418\n01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,280\nbagged and tagged it.\n\n1419\n01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,640\nHere's my information.\n\n1420\n01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,810\nBut then it's gonna be signed off by\nthe guy that's driving that stuff\n\n1421\n01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:07,150\nback to the lab, and\n\n1422\n01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:10,770\nhe's gonna have it signed off when they\nplaced it in that evidence locker.\n\n1423\n01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:14,300\nAnd then if I'm gonna be the one that\nwants to do a test on that hard drive\n\n1424\n01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,160\nI've gotta sign for\n\n1425\n01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:18,800\nthe fact that I'm removing it from that\nevidence locker, what I'm doing with it.\n\n1426\n01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,990\nI've gotta perform my examinations and\n\n1427\n01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:24,270\nthen the guy is gonna have me sign\nit back into that evidence locker.\n\n1428\n01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:25,590\nSo as you said, it's a timeline.\n\n1429\n01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:28,620\nIt's where that evidence\nhas been the entire time.\n\n1430\n01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:31,990\nBecause if the defense attorney can\npoke holes in that, they can say look,\n\n1431\n01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:33,090\nfor 24 hours.\n\n1432\n01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:34,480\nYou guys don't even know\nwhere this evidence was,\n\n1433\n01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,880\nthere's no record of\nwhere this evidence was.\n\n1434\n01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,740\nThat's when they can start poking\nholes in your theories and\n\n1435\n01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:45,070\nmaybe getting that person\noff on a technicality.\n\n1436\n01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:50,720\n>> And notice something about this\nform that we have up here, it maybe.\n\n1437\n01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:54,060\nIt may be subtle,\nsome of you may be actually picking it up.\n\n1438\n01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,360\nNotice what we've got in there.\n\n1439\n01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:02,170\nYou have a description of evidence and\na chain of custody.\n\n1440\n01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:07,110\nIn most situations those are separate\nthings just like you have here.\n\n1441\n01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:09,077\nYou have the description of evidence,\n\n1442\n01:20:09,077 --> 01:20:11,347\nsometimes they call\nthat chain of evidence.\n\n1443\n01:20:11,347 --> 01:20:18,530\nThat explains where the evidence was and\nwhat its disposition was,\n\n1444\n01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:23,250\nhow long it was there,\nall that good stuff.\n\n1445\n01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:28,220\nChain of custody,\nin this case, describes who did\n\n1446\n01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:32,020\nwhat and their position, all that.\n\n1447\n01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:35,020\nSo, it can be very well\n\n1448\n01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:39,970\nbroken into separate pieces like that to\nsay what was there and who received it.\n\n1449\n01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:43,720\nAnd then, you could get a situation where\n\n1450\n01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:48,510\nI have someone that hands the stuff\nto me and I sign a line on that form.\n\n1451\n01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,960\nAnd then, I hand it to Mike, and\nhe goes there and signs the next one.\n\n1452\n01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,000\nIt's going to show two entries for me.\n\n1453\n01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,230\nOne as the person that's receiving and\none as the person that's delivering.\n\n1454\n01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:01,120\nSo we'll have those two things there.\n\n1455\n01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:06,270\nThat may sound like it's overkill but\nthere is two sides to every transaction.\n\n1456\n01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:10,320\nSo when it leaves one facility and\ngoes to another one when it left,\n\n1457\n01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,410\nwho signed it out, and who signed it in,\ntook possession of it.\n\n1458\n01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,130\n>> Absolutely.\nThat's you releasing.\n\n1459\n01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:17,680\nIf you're the one that's giving\nthat evidence to somebody else or\n\n1460\n01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:22,210\nturning it over to somebody else,\nthat's releasing your responsibility for\n\n1461\n01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,800\nthat particular piece of evidence.\n\n1462\n01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,570\nBut then somebody else, at that point,\nhas to claim responsibility for it.\n\n1463\n01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:29,649\nAnd that's what he's talking about,\nno gap in there.\n\n1464\n01:21:29,649 --> 01:21:32,667\nSo, once I have turned it over,\nI sign out, and\n\n1465\n01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:36,002\nthe next person basically\nclaims responsibility.\n\n1466\n01:21:36,002 --> 01:21:39,030\nAnd I'm no longer responsible for\nanything that happens to that evidence.\n\n1467\n01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:39,550\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1468\n01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:42,450\n>> And I think photos, we had a question\nin the chatroom, better we add photos too?\n\n1469\n01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:45,610\nAnd can't hurt right, extra documentation.\n\n1470\n01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:49,530\n>> And not only should it not hurt,\nit's something you better have,\n\n1471\n01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,770\nyou absolutely better have.\n\n1472\n01:21:51,770 --> 01:21:56,670\nWe haven't gotten that far yet, but\nsince it was brought up here in chat,\n\n1473\n01:21:56,670 --> 01:22:01,250\nwhen we put together a kit\nto go out in the field.\n\n1474\n01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:05,300\nThat kit should include a digital camera,\n\n1475\n01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:09,200\na video camera,\nplus a bunch of other things.\n\n1476\n01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,870\nFor the photos things,\nthose should be there.\n\n1477\n01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:15,935\nThey will expect take as\nmany photos as you have,\n\n1478\n01:22:15,935 --> 01:22:18,395\nin fact, nowadays,\nit's not like it was before.\n\n1479\n01:22:18,395 --> 01:22:23,625\nWell, I've got to change the film and, no,\nit's not that, take as many as you want.\n\n1480\n01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:24,725\nMemory cards are cheap.\n\n1481\n01:22:24,725 --> 01:22:30,947\nTake as many as you need and\njust storm a storm with everything.\n\n1482\n01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:34,827\nAnnotate it, store it,\nand then boom we're good.\n\n1483\n01:22:34,827 --> 01:22:36,067\nThat's critical.\n\n1484\n01:22:36,067 --> 01:22:37,197\nThey do expect that.\n\n1485\n01:22:37,197 --> 01:22:43,400\nSome cases you will actually see them even\ninclude on top of the photos and video.\n\n1486\n01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:49,700\nWhat's gonna happen with that is someone\nmight be doing a crime scene animation or\n\n1487\n01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:53,740\nreenactment, and they may be using\nthose things as a basis for that.\n\n1488\n01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:57,770\nSo if you're not showing things from all\nangles and show where it positioned in\n\n1489\n01:22:57,770 --> 01:23:02,870\nthe room and all that,\nthat could be enough to skew\n\n1490\n01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:08,980\nthose results in that.\n\n1491\n01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:12,490\nAnd yeah,\nmaybe indirectly manipulating the results.\n\n1492\n01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:15,280\nI mean think about it,\nif you think about it.\n\n1493\n01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,870\nIf you kinda close one eye and\n\n1494\n01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:20,090\nthe other, it's kinda the same\ntype of concept more or less.\n\n1495\n01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:22,780\nIs that you close one eye or\nthe other, stuff shifts a little bit.\n\n1496\n01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,830\nIt's kinda the same thing\nwith taking a picture.\n\n1497\n01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:26,730\nIf you don't get all the angles,\n\n1498\n01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:30,130\nthen you could very well be not\nportraying something accurately.\n\n1499\n01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:33,342\nThat's why a lot of technicians\nwill snap tons of pictures and\n\n1500\n01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:34,899\nthey'll have them overlap.\n\n1501\n01:23:34,899 --> 01:23:38,430\nAnd they'll do a complete\n360 going around the thing.\n\n1502\n01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,030\nAnd then they'll do it the other way too,\n\n1503\n01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:43,660\nlooking out, to get a whole picture of\nthat thing living in its environment.\n\n1504\n01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:47,660\nAnd they will document everything\nas they take it apart, if need be.\n\n1505\n01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:50,130\nAll that is getting videoed and cleared.\n\n1506\n01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:51,260\nYou open up the case.\n\n1507\n01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,110\nClick.\n\n1508\n01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:56,240\nYou should have specialized equipment for\nthat, and\n\n1509\n01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,280\nI mean its own digital camera thing for\nthat.\n\n1510\n01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:04,230\nBut all else fails you can in\na pinch use your cell phone camera.\n\n1511\n01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:09,950\nSo it's probably not the best, but you\ncan use it and those have been accepted.\n\n1512\n01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:12,670\n>> If you are a first responder maybe and\nweren't prepared for\n\n1513\n01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:14,605\nthat maybe you do go ahead and\ngrab some pictures.\n\n1514\n01:24:14,605 --> 01:24:17,860\nCuz we got volatile information,\ninformation that's on the screen,\n\n1515\n01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:20,995\ninformation or articles laying around\nthe crime scene and things like that.\n\n1516\n01:24:20,995 --> 01:24:24,300\nThat we might want to capture\nbefore everyone comes in and\n\n1517\n01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,190\nstarts corrupting that crime scene.\n\n1518\n01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:28,660\nI've got another good question in\nthe chat room there from Michaela.\n\n1519\n01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,818\nDo you also maintain a chain of custody\non any copies that have been created?\n\n1520\n01:24:31,818 --> 01:24:36,550\nSo we had talked about not working\nwith the orignal piece of evidence.\n\n1521\n01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:41,500\nMaking a duplicate of that do I\nhave to follow that same level of\n\n1522\n01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,010\nchain of custody on that as well?\n\n1523\n01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:45,150\n>> It's not a bad idea.\n\n1524\n01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:49,140\nIt's not a bad idea to document that yes,\nyou have had a copy and\n\n1525\n01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:54,030\nthat's were you performed your analysis\nand give your results for that.\n\n1526\n01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:58,290\nIt's much more critical to do that\non the originals than the copies.\n\n1527\n01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:01,180\nBut it's not a bad idea.\n\n1528\n01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,520\nAnd some places, they don't even care.\n\n1529\n01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:07,817\nAs long as we know when you were done,\nthat it was destroyed and\n\n1530\n01:25:07,817 --> 01:25:12,255\nno confidential information was getting\nleaked or what have you, they don't care.\n\n1531\n01:25:12,255 --> 01:25:14,659\n>> And in the end,\nI can still match with our hashes,\n\n1532\n01:25:14,659 --> 01:25:17,064\nI can still match that copy\nback to the original and\n\n1533\n01:25:17,064 --> 01:25:20,460\nverify that it hasn't been modified\nin any way or anything like that.\n\n1534\n01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:24,560\nSo as long as that original hasn't been\nmodified and has an accurate chain of\n\n1535\n01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:30,460\ncustody on it, the duplicate is not\nquite as important, but it can't hurt.\n\n1536\n01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:31,070\nRight?\n\n1537\n01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:34,640\nI mean it's just one less thing that\nthey can try to throw in your face\n\n1538\n01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:38,413\nin a court of law or something\nlike that so it's not a bad idea.\n\n1539\n01:25:38,413 --> 01:25:42,090\n>> And\njust to add another thing to the mix here,\n\n1540\n01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:47,730\ndepending on I see your jokes and\ncomments about magnetic media.\n\n1541\n01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:53,100\nBut you could also throw CDs,\nDVDs, flash drives all into that.\n\n1542\n01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,230\nWe've got a lot.\n\n1543\n01:25:55,230 --> 01:26:00,970\nWhen you create a copy, you may in fact\nhave a hard drive that you plug in,\n\n1544\n01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:02,610\nespecially set up for this.\n\n1545\n01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:07,570\nThat you plug in and dump an image\nfrom the original, using some special\n\n1546\n01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:13,770\ntechniques we're going to discuss,\nover to your own hard drive.\n\n1547\n01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:16,130\nAnd you do the analysis there\nlike we've talked about.\n\n1548\n01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:20,200\nThere can be a separate\nset of documentation for\n\n1549\n01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:26,070\nthat that's not a chain of custody, but\nit does document that after I did my\n\n1550\n01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:32,510\nanalysis that this drive was wiped\nclean from a forensic standpoint.\n\n1551\n01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:35,421\nThey document that because\nyou reuse those drives.\n\n1552\n01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:38,172\nThe last thing to wanna do\nis work on this case, and\n\n1553\n01:26:38,172 --> 01:26:41,130\ndump it over here and\nforget to do it or not do it right.\n\n1554\n01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:43,700\nAnd you take it over to another case and\nyou start mixing stuff,\n\n1555\n01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:46,730\nthere's remnants left behind.\n\n1556\n01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:48,430\nThat could screw up that case.\n\n1557\n01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:50,790\n>> Absolutely.\nAbsolutely.\n\n1558\n01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:51,810\nSomething we got to think about.\n\n1559\n01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:54,340\nAll right.\nWell, Sean,\n\n1560\n01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,760\nwe've covered a lot of information.\n\n1561\n01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,871\nAnything else we need to throw in with our\ndigital evidence and our chain of custody?\n\n1562\n01:27:00,871 --> 01:27:02,740\n>> Yeah, not right now.\n\n1563\n01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:06,185\nI think we've pretty much beaten\nthat horse to death at this point.\n\n1564\n01:27:06,185 --> 01:27:09,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah, we don't need to burden,\n\n1565\n01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:14,090\nwe don't have to give anyone else with\nanymore documentation stuff at this point.\n\n1566\n01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:18,470\nI know, no job's done until the paper\nwork's completed, but don't worry,\n\n1567\n01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:20,650\nwe will talk a little\nmore about documentation.\n\n1568\n01:27:20,650 --> 01:27:25,210\nBut it's not gonna be as painful cuz we\nare gonna talk about the software, and\n\n1569\n01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:26,770\nactually show you software.\n\n1570\n01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:29,620\nI know,\nyou wanna see demos of this type of stuff.\n\n1571\n01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:32,660\nAnd you should see demos, and\nwe're gonna do a lot of those,\n\n1572\n01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,630\nas those are all coming up.\n\n1573\n01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:39,347\nSo we're gonna show how this\ndocumentation is generated in\n\n1574\n01:27:39,347 --> 01:27:42,755\naddition to forms like what Mike had here.\n\n1575\n01:27:42,755 --> 01:27:45,860\nWe'll show some of the software\npackages how you create a case and\n\n1576\n01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:48,960\ndocument the whole thing and\ntrack what's going on.\n\n1577\n01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:54,070\nSo, we've got a lot of exciting things\nthat build on what we have now.\n\n1578\n01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:56,571\nSo yeah, we're in good shape I think.\n\n1579\n01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:58,012\n>> All right, well sounds good.\n\n1580\n01:27:58,012 --> 01:28:00,430\nAll right ladies and gentlemen,\nthat is going to do it on this episode.\n\n1581\n01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:02,800\nI

a little bit about\nthat chain of custody.\n\n1586\n01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:17,390\nWe've got much more to go\nover that in future episodes.\n\n1587\n01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:19,920\nSo again, appreciate

episodes, and\n\n12\n00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,240\ntoday we're gonna be covering\nthe where'd we leave off yesterday?\n\n13\n00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,170\nComputer forensic investigation process.\n\n14\n00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,550\nThere's a lot of cool things to talk about\nhere as we go through, how it is to go\n\n15\n00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,670\nabout gathering up the evidence and\nbeginning that process, right, Sean?\n\n16\n00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,330\n>> Yes.\n\n17\n00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,550\nWe're going to be talking about\nthe process this morning.\n\n18\n00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,650\nBut we're not just going to\nbe talking about the process.\n\n19\n00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,730\nWe've got a surprise here for you.\n\n20\n00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,400\nIt may be a special treat if you\nwant to be dramatic about it.\n\n21\n00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,560\nWhat the plans are,\nare we're going to in this first segment,\n\n22\n00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,800\nwe are going to talk and give you\nan overview of what the process is.\n\n23\n00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,290\nAnd we're going to need you to pay\nclose attention to this because we have\n\n24\n00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,490\na job for you.\n\n25\n00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,280\nAfter we talk about what this process\nis and kind of fill in some stuff for\n\n26\n00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,080\nyou as much as we can, what we're\ngoing to do in our next segment,\n\n27\n00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,070\nwe are actually gonna simulate kinda\nsort of a crime scene in here and\n\n28\n00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,490\nwe're gonna go through this process, and\n\n29\n00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,990\nit's like yeah, together as we collect\nevidence and start to examine the scene.\n\n30\n00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,830\nWe're gonna start looking towards\nhow you do that, procedures that\n\n31\n00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,240\nneed to be followed, and getting it\nready for technical analysis later.\n\n32\n00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,910\nBut this is something you will be doing,\nand we're gonna\n\n33\n00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,580\nspin a little bit of a scenario here for\nyou and see how well you do.\n\n34\n00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,500\nIf you make mistakes, fine.\n\n35\n00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,860\nIt's going to be really cool.\n\n36\n00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,821\nI'll act as the lead investigator,\n\n37\n00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:17,800\nMike's going to act as\na co-investigator on the case.\n\n38\n00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,874\n>> Yeah, I'm going to be that underling,\nthe trainee that comes in and\n\n39\n00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,470\ndoes all the labor and everything.\n\n40\n00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,872\nReally excited, guys, you guys\nare actually, we're gonna try this out,\n\n41\n00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:26,680\nsee how it works.\n\n42\n00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,183\nWe're gonna lecture,\nwe're gonna talk about what it is,\n\n43\n00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:32,087\nwhat this process is so you've got\nthe information for the exam, but\n\n44\n00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,260\nthen we're actually gonna\ndo it up here on screen.\n\n45\n00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,739\nAnd we're gonna try to get you guys to\nparticipate, help us, coach us along,\n\n46\n00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,550\ntell us maybe what we should do next or\ntalk about that process.\n\n47\n00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,651\nTry to make it a little more fun for\nyou guys out there, so hopefully,\n\n48\n00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:44,520\nthis will go well.\n\n49\n00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,770\nWe'll see what happens.\n\n50\n00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,800\n>> Exactly.\n\n51\n00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,420\nI'm sure we're fine.\n\n52\n00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,160\n>> I like it.\n\n53\n00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,680\nI'm excited.\n\n54\n00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,290\nI hope you guys are too.\n\n55\n00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,360\nSo let's get started then.\n\n56\n00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,920\nLet's get the lecture part out of the way,\n\n57\n00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,150\nbecause we can't really do anything unless\nwe know what the heck we're doing, right?\n\n58\n00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,170\nSo, Sean, this computer\nforensic investigation process,\n\n59\n00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,140\nthey're all about\ninvestigating computer crimes.\n\n60\n00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,210\nThere's been an incident,\nsome kind of security breach.\n\n61\n00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:13,310\nOr we suspect something has taken\nplace on a machine, or what have you.\n\n62\n00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,320\nSo where do we start?\n\n63\n00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,460\nWhat do we do first?\n\n64\n00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,680\n>> It seems overwhelming when you first\nget into it, and I know that's probably\n\n65\n00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,620\nwhat a lot of you might see, and\nthat's kind of the thing here.\n\n66\n00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,380\nI don't know how much anxiety\nyou're feeling right now going oh,\n\n67\n00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,480\nwe're gonna be doing that obviously\nyou know it's simulated, but\n\n68\n00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,980\nin the real world,\nyou could have something,\n\n69\n00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,890\nyou could have a situation like this,\nwhere they're saying get out there.\n\n70\n00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,460\nI don't know what the get out there,\nfigure it out in the field.\n\n71\n00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,720\nYou could very well do that, and\nyou're gonna have a lead investigator,\n\n72\n00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,610\nsomeone that's acting as a mentor.\n\n73\n00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,040\nYou know, and in this case,\nI'm going to let you guys make mistakes.\n\n74\n00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,920\nI'm going to let you guys do that and\nsee how well you do and, kind of,\n\n75\n00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680\ntune things where I need to.\n\n76\n00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,735\nSo-\n>> I do have to point out the chat room\n\n77\n00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,638\njust for a minute, because we've got this\nreally cool idea going on where we're\n\n78\n00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,720\ngoing to set up a crime scene.\n\n79\n00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,830\nFor those of you in the US, And maybe\noutside the US I think it's indicated,\n\n80\n00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,330\nNCIS, great show.\n\n81\n00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,780\nYou're now going to be called Abby,\n\n82\n00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,730\nbecause your going to be\nwearing the lab coat.\n\n83\n00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,780\nAnd I'm going to be Probie.\n\n84\n00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,920\nYou know I'm going to be McGee.\n\n85\n00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,075\nSo we've got our new names for\nthe episode.\n\n86\n00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:15,950\n[LAUGH]\n>> See most people would be insulted by\n\n87\n00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,555\nbeing called a girl, I am that good\nof an actor that I can pull it off.\n\n88\n00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:22,890\n[LAUGH]\n>> Alright.\n\n89\n00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,470\nSo yeah, definitely overwhelming, and I\ncan see there might be a time where you're\n\n90\n00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,510\nnew or you haven't been doing this\nthat long and, but you got the job.\n\n91\n00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,680\nAnd all of a sudden here's your first\nincident, and it starts somewhere, right?\n\n92\n00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,466\n>> Oh my gosh.\n[LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:34,927\n>> Yeah what the heck am I gonna do.\n\n94\n00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:35,727\nWhere do I start?\n\n95\n00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:38,701\nAnd I would be so worried that I'm\ngoing to mess something up, or\n\n96\n00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:40,490\nnot do something incorrectly.\n\n97\n00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,980\nOr do something incorrectly that could end\nup leading to the evidence getting thrown\n\n98\n00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,940\nout, or not getting enough evidence\nto successfully prosecute, or\n\n99\n00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,610\nsomething like that.\n\n100\n00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,730\nSo we really gotta make sure we\npay attention and we understand.\n\n101\n00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,290\nAnd if we get the knowledge,\nthen it shouldn't be that bad.\n\n102\n00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,030\nWe might be nervous, but as long as we've\ngot our procedures laid out, we document,\n\n103\n00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,720\nwe follow through,\nwe should be okay right?\n\n104\n00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,980\n>> Yes, you should be fine.\n\n105\n00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,080\nIt will take a couple times to get\na least to get this, that is being easy,\n\n106\n00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,650\nit takes a couple times to get this\nprocess down, but you will find out that\n\n107\n00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:19,140\nyou will start developing a feel for\nthe operational tempo that's going on.\n\n108\n00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,580\nAnd hey, you know why it's not gonna be\na full blown crime scene and all that.\n\n109\n00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,320\nIt's gonna start giving you\na taste of what to expect.\n\n110\n00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,180\nSo you can start ironing out some of those\nthings, and getting used to taking notes,\n\n111\n00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,635\nand see what's happening.\n\n112\n00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:34,630\n>> Right, very good, very good.\n\n113\n00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,960\nAll right, so where do we start?\n\n114\n00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,540\nWhat's the first thing we got to do?\n\n115\n00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,250\n>> What we got to do to kinda you\nknow sort through all this and\n\n116\n00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,180\nto get things rolling, it's important\nto really kinda set your direction.\n\n117\n00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,810\nOkay, and we're gonna do today in our\nsimulations is we're gonna assume it's\n\n118\n00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,630\na corporate investigation and\n\n119\n00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,650\nwhen we set our goals, we're gonna\nsay it's in a corporate context.\n\n120\n00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,920\nSo we have to figure out what actually\ndrove this investigation to happen.\n\n121\n00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,760\nReason why I'm not choosing\nto do a criminal one in this\n\n122\n00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,340\nsituation is because a criminal case,\nan attorney or\n\n123\n00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,710\nsomebody's gonna come to you and\nsay, this is what's happened.\n\n124\n00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,970\nThey've called you in, so you've already\ngot those parameters pretty much set.\n\n125\n00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,940\nYou may have to nail them down a bit more.\n\n126\n00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,990\nBut you do have to know what\nyour goals are going in.\n\n127\n00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,600\nIf you don't know what your goals are,\nhow do you know you've reached it?\n\n128\n00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,950\nHow do you know what to collect?\n\n129\n00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,350\nCuz there's so much stuff.\n\n130\n00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,980\nBy the end of this course,\nyou're gonna see wow,\n\n131\n00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,580\nI did not know there was that\nmuch stuff being generated.\n\n132\n00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,590\n>> So, in a criminal investigation then,\n\n133\n00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,720\nI might have a good idea of\nwhat I should be looking for.\n\n134\n00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,800\nThe people have called me in, whether\nit's the defense or the prosecution,\n\n135\n00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,970\nare gonna say, hey we got this\ndefendant's or victim's laptop and\n\n136\n00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,070\nwe want you to look for this, or\nanalyze this hard drive for blablabla.\n\n137\n00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,080\nWhereas in a corporate type situation,\nthey might suspect somebody of something\n\n138\n00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,220\nbut not know exactly what they did or how\nthey did it, and so it's a little bit more\n\n139\n00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,930\nvague at the beginning,\nis that what I'm getting from that?\n\n140\n00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,950\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n141\n00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,510\nyou might have some idea what\ndirection it's going initially but\n\n142\n00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,500\nyou're still going to need to take\nall that and really nail it down.\n\n143\n00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,880\nBecause you can't say\ngo find some evidence.\n\n144\n00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,210\nWhat type of evidence?\n\n145\n00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,180\nWhat actually happened\nthat made you call me?\n\n146\n00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,330\nTo do this and then we can, kind of,\nstart hammering it out from there.\n\n147\n00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,310\n>> Because in a criminal case,\nI've got other detectives,\n\n148\n00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,700\npeople that aren't doing the computer\nthings, they're working the case,\n\n149\n00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,770\nand they've got a good\nidea of what happened.\n\n150\n00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,530\nIn a corporate situation, I might be it.\n\n151\n00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,800\nI might be, me and my team might\nbe the only ones investigating it.\n\n152\n00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,270\nSo, there's nobody to tell me, well,\nwe've found this or we did that.\n\n153\n00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,750\nWe've got to examine it from\nall angles at that point.\n\n154\n00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,330\n>> Absolutely.\n\n155\n00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,830\n>> We've got a system goals,\nwe've got an idea of\n\n156\n00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,920\nwhat it is we are going to try to do,\n>> Let's\n\n157\n00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,541\ntalk about some of those goals\n>> Yes, let's do.\n\n158\n00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:54,326\n>> This is just to give you a high\nlevel idea type of things you might be\n\n159\n00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:59,375\ncalled into for corporate investigation\nIt's not the only things.\n\n160\n00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:03,792\nI went through here and\nyou can see after a lot yesterday and\n\n161\n00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:09,762\ntoday I'm going over here looking at my\nnotes a lot more than I did with the CEH.\n\n162\n00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:17,380\nProbably the reason for\nthis is I've done forensics for a while.\n\n163\n00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,067\nWhen I get in that mindset, I'm so\n\n164\n00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,800\ntouchy about making sure I'm\nfollowing the process and\n\n165\n00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,210\ngetting everything that I'm still trained\nto go back and go okay, what are my notes.\n\n166\n00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:25,970\nGot through, boom.\n\n167\n00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,070\nRight there.\n\n168\n00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,830\nSo when you see me doing that,\nthat's part of that mindset in there.\n\n169\n00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,850\n>> Nice, so that training pays off.\n\n170\n00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,660\n>> That was the best cover up for\nnot studying ever.\n\n171\n00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I bought it, I bought it.\n\n172\n00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,660\nBut anyway.\n\n173\n00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,121\n>> No it's really cuz I've been trained\nto go through a checklist and you'll have\n\n174\n00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:47,260\na checklist built off this process,\nso if you don't remember it, fine.\n\n175\n00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,600\nIf you don't have the best memory and\n\n176\n00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,790\nyou're starting to get overwhelmed,\ntake notes.\n\n177\n00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,490\nI've got sitting right here.\n\n178\n00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,900\nI don't have anything in this one,\nbut it's just to show you.\n\n179\n00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,730\nGet something like this.\n\n180\n00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:09,120\nNow you're asking why don't I have\na tablet or something like that?\n\n181\n00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,070\nYou can use that if you want, and\nI have nothing against that, but\n\n182\n00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,000\nthose things do have a little\ntendency to kind of have issues.\n\n183\n00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,610\n>> Oh yeah, yeah.\n>> Battery life.\n\n184\n00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,190\nThese things-\n>> They don't go bad, right?\n\n185\n00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,140\n>> Yeah.\n>> I don't have to recharge that thing.\n\n186\n00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,550\nI can always find it.\n\n187\n00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,350\nI buy those little three by or\n\n188\n00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,440\nfour by six notepads by the ten pack\nwhen I go into Office Max or whatever.\n\n189\n00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,480\nBecause you just can't have too\nmany of those things around.\n\n190\n00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,810\n>> And I still feel that if you're\non a scene, going through and\n\n191\n00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,730\npulling this out, and getting a pen,\nand sketching stuff, and all that.\n\n192\n00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,880\nIt's still quicker for most parts then\nhaving someone pull out their iPad or\n\n193\n00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,790\ntablet and doing all this stuff in there.\n\n194\n00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,250\nIt takes too long.\n\n195\n00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,490\nI want to get the stuff down.\n\n196\n00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,610\nI'll convert to digital format\nlater if that's the need be.\n\n197\n00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,840\nBut you'll develop your own shorthand,\nyou'll do all those things.\n\n198\n00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,450\nGet something during this process.\n\n199\n00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,220\nAnd start getting your notes going.\n\n200\n00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,120\n>> Yeah and,\n\n201\n00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,830\nto me those, whereas I can't do this\nwith my iPad when that case is over.\n\n202\n00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,067\nOr when I need to ship it off or\nbox it up or what have you,\n\n203\n00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,135\nI can toss my notepads in there and\nbe done with it.\n\n204\n00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:08,672\n>> There you go.\n>> My iPad I can't, so\n\n205\n00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:11,936\nat some point I'm still gonna\nhave to transfer it to paper so\n\n206\n00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:15,610\nthat it can be cataloged, or sent,\nor put away, or what have you.\n\n207\n00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,570\n>> Yeah I'm with you on that one,\nall for pen and paper.\n\n208\n00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,410\n>> David in there you and\nI can relate to that too.\n\n209\n00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's part of the uniform.\n\n210\n00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,463\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're not allowed to have those out in\n\n211\n00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:30,198\nthe field, but anyway, so\nlet's talk about four potential types of\n\n212\n00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:33,560\ncases in the corporate\nfield you might run into.\n\n213\n00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,890\nThe human resources ones.\n\n214\n00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,230\nThat's actually quite common one\nof the first ones you'll run into\n\n215\n00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,960\nin a human resources centric case.\n\n216\n00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,920\nAnd those type of cases revolve around\npeople typically violating company policy,\n\n217\n00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,010\nmisusing company resources.\n\n218\n00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:54,040\nAnd you'll some really interesting\nthings as far as what people will do.\n\n219\n00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,140\nTrust me, you can sit here and\nsay oh well, I've seen it all.\n\n220\n00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,314\nNo you haven't.\n\n221\n00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:02,196\nNo, I'm just saying.\n\n222\n00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,410\n[LAUGH]\n>> I remember when photocopiers\n\n223\n00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,115\nfirst came out.\n\n224\n00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:06,188\n[LAUGH] Just kidding.\n\n225\n00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:09,077\n>> [LAUGH] That's right you\nhad to test it out somehow.\n\n226\n00:11:09,077 --> 00:11:15,080\nBut nowadays you will see everything.\n\n227\n00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,150\nYou'll see, and\nsome of the stuff is unbelievable.\n\n228\n00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,800\nYou really think it's like,\nyou thought that was appropriate?\n\n229\n00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,730\nYou'll see everything from email abuse,\nto people\n\n230\n00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,068\nrunning businesses out of the business.\n\n231\n00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:38,140\nThere's a very common one,\ninteresting enough one of the first cases\n\n232\n00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,590\na lot of people work on is where someone\nin the company is downloaded pornography.\n\n233\n00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,070\n>> Yes, I can see that.\n\n234\n00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,530\nIt's just a mind boggler to me.\n\n235\n00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,350\nI can't imagine somebody being so\n\n236\n00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,600\nhard up to get to porn they've got to\ndo it on their work computer at work.\n\n237\n00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,550\nYou know, that kinda thing.\n\n238\n00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,630\nYou see that, you see people as\nyou were saying, run an eBay.\n\n239\n00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,385\n>> You've got your way of doing things,\nI've got mine.\n\n240\n00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:03,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Running eBay auctions from work\n\n241\n00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,620\nto the really bizarre stuff,\nwhere actually, like you said,\n\n242\n00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,780\nrunning full businesses out of their,\nor as we talked about HR,\n\n243\n00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,510\ngetting in other people's personal\nrecords and things like that.\n\n244\n00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,050\n>> Well, we're gonna talk about that one.\n\n245\n00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,700\nYou're right on with that.\n\n246\n00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,189\nOne of the ones I think of to kinda\ncombine a couple of things here on\n\n247\n00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:24,760\nthe human resources side.\n\n248\n00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,300\nThere's literally been cases, and these\nstill pop up now and then, where people,\n\n249\n00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:36,068\nthe business they've chosen to host\nfrom their work is an adult website.\n\n250\n00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:38,577\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm like man, really?\n\n251\n00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:39,301\n>> Wow.\n\n252\n00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,280\n>> I'm like how-\n>> They got the bandwidth right?\n\n253\n00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,980\n>> Yeah, they got the bandwidth.\n\n254\n00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,780\n>> It's just jaw dropping\nwhen you run into that.\n\n255\n00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,485\nThe first time I ran into something\nlike that, they told me I was fired.\n\n256\n00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:53,010\nNo.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n257\n00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,100\n>> No, the first time I ran into something\n\n258\n00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,065\nlike that, it was just mind boggling\nthat someone went through and\n\n259\n00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:00,805\nconsciously made that decision to do that.\n\n260\n00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:03,680\nThat's not a minor amount\nof set-up business wise.\n\n261\n00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,520\nPeriod.\n\n262\n00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,210\nAnd then to put that stuff into the mix?\n\n263\n00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,290\nWhatever.\n\n264\n00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,520\n>> It's crazy.\nIt's crazy.\n\n265\n00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,220\n>> And then we've got,\nkinda to bump onto the next one.\n\n266\n00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,350\nCuz you started creeping\ninto that area Mike,\n\n267\n00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,700\nwith looking at other people's stuff.\n\n268\n00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,230\nIt could be done on an employee level.\n\n269\n00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,010\nBut administrator abuse is something that\ndoes pop up and maybe more than you think.\n\n270\n00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,130\nAnd you actually may be\nguilty of it yourself.\n\n271\n00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,989\nI think every administrator has\nsometimes crossed the lines,\n\n272\n00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:38,042\nit's just a question of how far.\n\n273\n00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:45,600\nOne is looking at other people's email,\nis a very common one.\n\n274\n00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,670\nAnd they start looking at other\npeople's email, see what's happening.\n\n275\n00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,410\nYou see people that are looking at\ndocuments and stuff, like that,\n\n276\n00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,190\nthat shouldn't.\n\n277\n00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,988\nThey have administrative access, so, they\ndefinitely have the ability to do it, but\n\n278\n00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:58,820\nit wasn't given to them for that reason.\n\n279\n00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,700\nSo they'll start creeping\ninto those areas.\n\n280\n00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,015\nSo you might be actually called in to do\nany of those things where someone has that\n\n281\n00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:09,870\nGod-like privileges and they will go\nin and start looking at things and\n\n282\n00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,990\ndoing things they shouldn't.\n\n283\n00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:14,955\n>> And\nwe know that can creep up because either\n\n284\n00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:17,815\nwe haven't assigned permissions properly,\n\n285\n00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,555\nyet and the organizations sometimes\nare little free with permissions.\n\n286\n00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:22,825\nThey don't follow that principle\nof the least privileged, so\n\n287\n00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:25,245\nthey want somebody to\naccomplish a certain task.\n\n288\n00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:28,105\nAnd instead of figuring out what\npermission they need to do that task,\n\n289\n00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:30,425\nthey give them blanket admin rights or\nsomething like that.\n\n290\n00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:34,015\nAnd then that extra power gives them and\nthe curiosity and\n\n291\n00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:36,100\nthey start poking around and\ngetting in places they don't.\n\n292\n00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,994\nOr it could be just a straight\nup administrator that,\n\n293\n00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:40,280\nI've seen cases where they're\nusing that to their advantage.\n\n294\n00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,508\nWhere they're trying to get some personal\ninformation on an employee to maybe\n\n295\n00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:48,830\ncoerce information or favors out of\nthat employee, or things like that.\n\n296\n00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,940\nSo it can get pretty nasty really quick.\n\n297\n00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,110\nAnd the problem is a lot of times it's\nyour higher ups and it becomes a little,\n\n298\n00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,470\ndon't want to say awkward, but difficult\nwithin the organization to do that.\n\n299\n00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,991\nMake sure you have backing from the other\nC officers and things like that.\n\n300\n00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:07,060\n>> Yeah,\nyou'll stuff with administrator abuse.\n\n301\n00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,300\nIt's even developed beyond just\nseeing what someone else is doing,\n\n302\n00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,510\nthat human curiosity to see\nwhat the other guy's doing.\n\n303\n00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,090\nBut you see it actually evolve\ninto some cases, cyberstalking.\n\n304\n00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,360\nI've definitely seen ones like that\nwhere somebody's got the hots for\n\n305\n00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,420\nsomebody else in the business,\nthey say no, and they keep pushing it.\n\n306\n00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,350\nAnd they just start figuring out\nby reading this person's email and\n\n307\n00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,480\nlooking at phone calls.\n\n308\n00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,110\nWe have Voice over IPs now that\ncan tap into those systems and\n\n309\n00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:40,540\nlook at all these things to\nsee what's this person doing.\n\n310\n00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,610\nI remember hearing one about someone\nthat asked a woman out repeatedly, and\n\n311\n00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,440\nthen he started showing up every\nplace she was outside of work.\n\n312\n00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,590\nAnd they said, yeah,\nwe know what's going on here,\n\n313\n00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,150\nwe just got to find out where he's\ngetting the information from.\n\n314\n00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,840\nWe'll talk more about that case.\n\n315\n00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,080\nThat's an interesting one.\n\n316\n00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,984\nSo, there's a couple.\n\n317\n00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:02,884\nAnd then just the two more to kinda bump\nthose out of the way, information theft.\n\n318\n00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:04,545\nMm-hm.\n\n319\n00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:08,760\n>> Yeah, that's pretty straight forward,\nwhen you think about it.\n\n320\n00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,140\nBut there's many ways, you know,\nto get information out, now a days,\n\n321\n00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,330\nit's got to be incredibly easy for\nsomeone to get information out.\n\n322\n00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,950\nWith all the removable media, and\nways to hide, you know, to hide things.\n\n323\n00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,250\nMost businesses, for\nexample, aren't aware, well,\n\n324\n00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,950\nthey get more aware of what people plug,\nyou know, music players and\n\n325\n00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,795\nUSB devices in, because those\nthings are just a big hard drive.\n\n326\n00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:34,410\n>> Right.\n\n327\n00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,330\n>> So, those are very easy to get across.\n\n328\n00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,100\nAnd then,\nthe other one would be internal leaks.\n\n329\n00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,060\nSomeone letting information out that\nthey shouldn't be, and they're doing it.\n\n330\n00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,790\nAnd that one can become very interesting\ntoo, because once that information's\n\n331\n00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,900\nleaking, why are they leaking that\ninformation to some on the outside?\n\n332\n00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,720\nIs it because they've got an axe to grind,\nbecause once you figure out\n\n333\n00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,870\nthey've got an axe to grind, that kind of\nchanges the scope of things, just a bit.\n\n334\n00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,920\nYou're gonna have to kind of figure out,\nokay,\n\n335\n00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,950\nwell this person has an axe to grind.\n\n336\n00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,970\nAnd that person may have other things out\nthat they've done that's more malicious.\n\n337\n00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,780\nThey could have malware planted and\nstuff like that.\n\n338\n00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,000\nIt's not uncommon to see that, at all.\n\n339\n00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,235\nAnd another one would be, for information\nleaks, would be that someone has,\n\n340\n00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:28,151\nwhen you have an information leaks is\nthat someone has, is getting paid,\n\n341\n00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:31,170\nis getting paid by an outside party.\n\n342\n00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,140\n>> Yes.\nSomebody says, okay,\n\n343\n00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,060\nI'm gonna find that employee, they maybe\na little vulnerable, maybe in debt or\n\n344\n00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,800\nsomething like that.\n\n345\n00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,670\nWe've seen the movies.\n\n346\n00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,050\nBut this stuff really happens.\n\n347\n00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,120\nRight.\nI mean, yes, they use it in movies, but\n\n348\n00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,260\nit does happen.\n\n349\n00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,240\nYou find that guy that's vulnerable,\nthat's down on his luck, or\n\n350\n00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,480\nis having issues.\n\n351\n00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,030\nAnd you slip him a few bills.\n\n352\n00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,690\nTo pull some, hey just give me\na copy of some of these files,\n\n353\n00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,850\nor emails, or whatever.\n\n354\n00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,180\nJust carbon copy, you know,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n355\n00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,730\nAnd yeah, it happens.\n\n356\n00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,403\nWe've got those leaks that\nwe've got to be able to find.\n\n357\n00:17:56,403 --> 00:17:58,676\nWe've got to be able to discover them,\nand stop them.\n\n358\n00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:03,821\n>> Yeah, it can be easy,\nif you go back and look at the stuff we\n\n359\n00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:09,450\ntalked about in the CEH social\nengineering and hacking.\n\n360\n00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,700\nSomeone was using that for Black hat stuff\nand gets the right information on someone,\n\n361\n00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,115\nif they're lucky enough to get something\nthat that person is trying to hide,\n\n362\n00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:18,240\nthey leading the double life or\n\n363\n00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,520\nsomething, then that opens a door to\nsomeone to leaking information and\n\n364\n00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,530\nbeing told, hey, you do this or\nthat's the end of your career.\n\n365\n00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,040\nAnd that has definitely\nbeen known to happen.\n\n366\n00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,620\nSo, it's something to kind of think about.\n\n367\n00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,720\nAnd that does also change the scope,\nonce again.\n\n368\n00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,770\nSomeone you do an investigation, and that\nperson, during the investigation process,\n\n369\n00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,290\nyou interview them,\nwhich you will have to.\n\n370\n00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:52,030\nYou interview them, that's presumably\ngonna come out during your investigation,\n\n371\n00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,760\nif they were getting black mailed.\n\n372\n00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,450\nNow you gotta,\nnow you might have to say, okay,\n\n373\n00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,780\nwhat were they black mailing you with?\n\n374\n00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,430\nAnd, you know, where did they get that?\n\n375\n00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,780\nBecause that may be something else\nthat they hacked in some other way\n\n376\n00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,290\nand got that.\n\n377\n00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,840\nThat leads to something,\n\n378\n00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,800\nso it could be a lot of rabbit holes\nthat you're going down with this.\n\n379\n00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,932\n>> And start creeping towards\na criminal case at that point as well.\n\n380\n00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:11,490\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n381\n00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,950\n>> Start calling in law enforcement and\nthings like that.\n\n382\n00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,240\n>> And that kinda cuts to\nwhat we talked yesterday,\n\n383\n00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,360\nabout going from a corporate case to all\nof a sudden, you've hit a point where,\n\n384\n00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,890\nyes, you do have to go criminal case.\n\n385\n00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:29,620\nAnd now, if that happens,\nwhat would happen in that case is that,\n\n386\n00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,345\nyou now have to get search warrants,\n\n387\n00:19:31,345 --> 00:19:36,520\ncuz you wanna kinda protect yourself, cuz\nyou're gonna have to go a little deeper,\n\n388\n00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,670\neven though that stuff is\nowned by your corporation.\n\n389\n00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,960\nNow you gotta dig deeper into certain\nthings and you wanna get a search warrant,\n\n390\n00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,440\neven though it's inside your company,\n\n391\n00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,630\nyou may have to search that\nperson's personal stuff, too.\n\n392\n00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,220\n>> And you might be the forensic\ninvestigator inside\n\n393\n00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,670\nthe corporation that's handling that.\n\n394\n00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,950\nThe law enforcement might have their\nown people that are gonna come in,\n\n395\n00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,680\nand all of a sudden you\ngotta work with them, and\n\n396\n00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,100\nyou gotta turn over a lot of your stuff\nto them, so having that procedure,\n\n397\n00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,810\ntaking those notes the right way,\nsecuring evidence the proper way,\n\n398\n00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,565\nwill definitely make that a smoother\nprocess and make the outcome a lot better.\n\n399\n00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:05,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n400\n00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,710\n>> So now, we've got a lot of different\ntypes of cases, and they're not always so\n\n401\n00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,770\nneat and tidy, right?\n\n402\n00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,795\nThey sometimes don't fall-\n>> Never.\n\n403\n00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:13,020\n[LAUGH]\n>> We want to be able to categorize them.\n\n404\n00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,890\nThat would be really nice if we could,\nbut sometimes, not so much, right?\n\n405\n00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,890\n>> No, they're definitely not.\n\n406\n00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,370\nYou do have cases all\nthe time that are multi goal,\n\n407\n00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,320\nthat they're gonna bring together one or\nall these things, plus other stuff.\n\n408\n00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,855\nI mean, heck, you mentioned it where,\njust a moment ago was,\n\n409\n00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,690\nit's gone from a corporate to a criminal.\n\n410\n00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,620\nAnd that's bringing in a lot\nof threads together and\n\n411\n00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,595\nso it's just not gonna be that clean.\n\n412\n00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:40,800\n>> Right.\n\n413\n00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,670\nAnd in other times, we have to worry\nabout how we go about the investigation.\n\n414\n00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,694\nWhether or not we can be forthcoming\nwith our investigation, right?\n\n415\n00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:47,484\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n416\n00:20:47,484 --> 00:20:49,655\nThat's the good one.\n\n417\n00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:54,635\nThat's the one that you're probably\ngonna like more than anything.\n\n418\n00:20:54,635 --> 00:20:56,870\n>> That you hope you get.\n\n419\n00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,715\n>> Yeah,\nyou're getting all the ninja stuff.\n\n420\n00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,530\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n421\n00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:04,530\n>> What we're alluding to is something\ncalled the Black bag operation.\n\n422\n00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,370\nAnd that's what they call it sometimes.\n\n423\n00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,460\nThey'll call it a covert operation.\n\n424\n00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,063\nI don't care what they call it.\n\n425\n00:21:09,063 --> 00:21:11,027\nBut those two are really cool in my books.\n\n426\n00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:12,363\n>> If you change to accept this mission.\n\n427\n00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:16,750\n[LAUGH]\n>> It pretty much comes down to that.\n\n428\n00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:22,264\nIs that they give you a situation where,\nif you're investigating someone.\n\n429\n00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:25,020\nI might be, for example,\nlet's just say in this business.\n\n430\n00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,110\nI was called into do a forensic\ninvestigation on someone here.\n\n431\n00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,500\nWell, what could have\nhappened during that.\n\n432\n00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,171\nAs I said, well,\nwe don't want to notify that person and\n\n433\n00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:38,066\nwe don't want it being disruptive, because\neither one of those things could cause\n\n434\n00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,975\nthe person to stop what they're doing.\n\n435\n00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:44,090\nNow is not the time to kind of,\nto kind of trip things, right?\n\n436\n00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,690\nBecause we want to see how far they've\ntaken things, how far's it going.\n\n437\n00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,850\nMaybe for example, to go to our previous\nexample, someone's being blackmailed,\n\n438\n00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,300\nyou wanna wait a little longer\nto see just how big this is.\n\n439\n00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,160\nSo you want to get information, but\nyou want to without them knowing.\n\n440\n00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,970\nThat's the covert operation.\n\n441\n00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,500\n>> We do things like, you know, because\nDaniel Lowrie is on our radar here.\n\n442\n00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,530\nSo what we did was, we bring in\nSean under the pretense of doing\n\n443\n00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,160\na security show,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n444\n00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,050\n>> But what he's really here to do\n\n445\n00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,315\nis investigate Daniel.\n\n446\n00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:18,730\n[LAUGH] No, but that would be\nan example of a clandestine operation.\n\n447\n00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,908\nWe get in here another pretense, and\n\n448\n00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:23,784\nnow he doesn't even know he is [CROSSTALK]\n>> I feel something\n\n449\n00:22:23,784 --> 00:22:24,472\nburning on my neck now.\n\n450\n00:22:24,472 --> 00:22:25,550\n>> [LAUGH] I know, right?\n\n451\n00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,023\nDaniel's over there,\ngiving me this evil look.\n\n452\n00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:29,995\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think I just got a hole in the,\n\n453\n00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:31,430\nI got a red dot on my head.\n\n454\n00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,222\nDoes anybody see a red?\n\n455\n00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:34,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He is armed and\n\n456\n00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,000\ndangerous, I can tell you that.\n\n457\n00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so yes, sometimes we gotta\n\n458\n00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,200\ndo these black bag operations\nwhere we can't let the intended.\n\n459\n00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,910\nI don't even know a good way to say it.\n\n460\n00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,090\nThe intent of our investigation,\nthe target of our investigation.\n\n461\n00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,130\nAnd we can't make them\naware of the investigation.\n\n462\n00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,970\nBecause then all of a sudden they start\ndestroying evidence, they start covering\n\n463\n00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:01,020\ntheir tracks, they cease their operations,\nand that all makes it more difficult to\n\n464\n00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,650\ndiscover what was going on and gather\nevidence that I can use to prosecute them,\n\n465\n00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,870\nif we take it that far or\nwhat have you, so.\n\n466\n00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,495\nSometimes, we've gotta do\nthe whole covert thing or and\n\n467\n00:23:09,495 --> 00:23:13,030\nsomebody with James with it there in\nthe chat room, the clandestine operations.\n\n468\n00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,910\nI like it.\n\n469\n00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,980\nLet's synchronize our watches then, go.\n\n470\n00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,140\n>> It is that way.\n\n471\n00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:24,110\nTo give you a kinda of the taste of\nthe real world here and how that works.\n\n472\n00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:28,820\nI mean, you can kinda get an idea of\ndifferent ways you could pull that off.\n\n473\n00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:34,620\nBut, I had a colleague of mine,\nback home in the Sacramento area,\n\n474\n00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,440\nthat what he does, if they have to\ndo this type of covert operation,\n\n475\n00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,120\nhe goes in with two other people and they\nwill go in like at 9 o'clock at night,\n\n476\n00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,610\npull the computer out, image the hard\ndrive and put it right back into place.\n\n477\n00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,030\nYou know, so, they may do that even later\nthan that, when no one's in that building.\n\n478\n00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,321\nIt's just, they are told early on the day,\nthey need to investigate such and such.\n\n479\n00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:01,551\nAnd then, what they will do is,\nthey will image that system.\n\n480\n00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:03,289\nThey may come in at two in the morning,\nthree in the morning.\n\n481\n00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:05,958\nHe says,\nhe's come in at all times of the day,\n\n482\n00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:09,450\nthe weekends,\nHe's done all sorts of interesting things,\n\n483\n00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,440\nhe's had to get warrants to check\nall different sorts of things out.\n\n484\n00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,178\nAnd to do it all behind the scenes.\n\n485\n00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:16,958\n>> Fascinating.\n\n486\n00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,164\n>> It can get really interesting,\n\n487\n00:24:19,164 --> 00:24:24,813\nbecause what your essence doing to put\nit another way, it's like playing chess.\n\n488\n00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:28,789\nYou're trying to get that person into\na position where they're checkmated before\n\n489\n00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:29,363\nthey know.\n\n490\n00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:30,340\n>> Right.\n\n491\n00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,710\nNice, nice.\n\n492\n00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,256\nAll right, well I tell you what,\nlooking at our time, it's about time for\n\n493\n00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:36,240\nus to take a break.\n\n494\n00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,230\nSo, why don't we stop here.\n\n495\n00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,443\nAnd when we come back,\nwe're gonna dive into the beginning of\n\n496\n00:24:41,443 --> 00:24:45,830\nthe process of how we start this\ninvestigation, so stay tuned.\n\n497\n00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,083\nWe'll be right back.\n\n498\n00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:50,895\n[SOUND] [LAUGH] All right,\n\n499\n00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:56,812\nwelcome back ladies and gentleman.\n\n500\n00:24:56,812 --> 00:25:01,130\nSo we left off talking about some of the,\nwhere did we leave off talking about?\n\n501\n00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,105\nLet's start that one again Jason, sorry.\n\n502\n00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:06,630\nYeah, I completely forget\nthe name of that last one there.\n\n503\n00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,636\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> I just blanked too on that one.\n\n504\n00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:11,781\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n505\n00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:12,934\n>> What the heck did we just talk about?\n\n506\n00:25:12,934 --> 00:25:14,080\nThe investigation process.\n\n507\n00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,195\nOkay.\n\n508\n00:25:15,195 --> 00:25:17,365\nSorry.\n\n509\n00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:20,733\n>> We talked about setting,\n>> Setting goals.\n\n510\n00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:21,233\n>> Yeah.\n\n511\n00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:25,162\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n512\n00:25:25,162 --> 00:25:27,114\n>> Oh, shit.\n\n513\n00:25:27,114 --> 00:25:30,736\nWow.\n\n514\n00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:33,547\nOkay.\n\n515\n00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:36,819\nSo we started talking about some of the\ndifferent types of computer or crimes that\n\n516\n00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:39,170\nwere crimes that we might have to\n>> Yeah, there were types, yeah.\n\n517\n00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,745\nWe talked about the black bag.\n\n518\n00:25:40,745 --> 00:25:43,619\n>> Yeah.\nNow we're gonna talk about actually,\n\n519\n00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:44,805\nget in the scene.\n\n520\n00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:45,771\nOkay.\n\n521\n00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:48,029\n[COUGH] Let's try that again.\n\n522\n00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:49,473\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Take two.\n\n523\n00:25:49,473 --> 00:25:52,704\n[LAUGH]\n>> Stand by.\n\n524\n00:25:52,704 --> 00:26:00,903\n[SOUND]\n>> All right,\n\n525\n00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:02,790\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n526\n00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,680\nSo we left of talking about some of\nthe different types of crimes that\n\n527\n00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,780\nwe might have to be\ncalled into investigate.\n\n528\n00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,340\nI think now, we're gonna start talking\nabout the actual investigation process.\n\n529\n00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,940\nWhat happens next?\n\n530\n00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,560\nWe've been told this\nis what we need to do.\n\n531\n00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,160\n>> Okay.\n>> Now what?\n\n532\n00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,900\nHow do they even get\nstarted with this Shaun?\n\n533\n00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,540\nYeah, as Mike's said,\nwe've already kinda set a focus.\n\n534\n00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,060\nNow, the rubber's hitting the road, and\n\n535\n00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:30,630\nwe are really starting to get down\nto interacting with the scene.\n\n536\n00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,760\nWith goal's set, the reason why we're\ncalled out there being determined,\n\n537\n00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,200\nyou know now we can start stepping in,\nand start to get our process going.\n\n538\n00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,170\nSo, one of the first things\nyou're gonna do presumably,\n\n539\n00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,150\nis you're gonna evaluate and\nsecure the scene.\n\n540\n00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,130\nThat sounds pretty straightforward.\n\n541\n00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,000\nYou're gonna take a look at the scene,\nand then lock it down\n\n542\n00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,890\nuntil you're done with your whole\nprocess of getting what you need and\n\n543\n00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,260\npreserving it and tagging, bagging,\nand getting it out of there.\n\n544\n00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,710\nReason why I say presumably\nyou're gonna do that is,\n\n545\n00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,310\nyou may not be the first\nperson on the scene.\n\n546\n00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,070\nYou may be the person\nthat's getting the call.\n\n547\n00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,640\nIt's not likely that,\nas a Forensic Examiner,\n\n548\n00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,350\nyou're gonna walk around a corner and go,\noh my god, a crime scene, and tape it off.\n\n549\n00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,410\nIt's probably not gonna happen.\n\n550\n00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,640\nYou're gonna be on call.\n\n551\n00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,330\nI mean heck, you may even be a contractor\non the outside for a company.\n\n552\n00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,560\nA lot of companies to contract\nwith outside agencies\n\n553\n00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,350\nto do the forensics for them.\n\n554\n00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:30,564\nBecause they don't see it necessary\nto have that person on full-time.\n\n555\n00:27:30,564 --> 00:27:32,590\nBut some companies do that,\n\n556\n00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,990\nit's definitely not unheard of\nin enterprise organizations.\n\n557\n00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,610\nBut, what you'll have is you'll have a\nfirst responder and the first responder is\n\n558\n00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,260\nthe one who gets reported to and\nshows up on the scene first.\n\n559\n00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:51,300\nUsually what happens is, is that\nsomeone says that somethings happened,\n\n560\n00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,930\nthere's been a disruption,\nsome sort of security incident and\n\n561\n00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,540\nthere's a section security manager,\nsomething like that, that gets a call.\n\n562\n00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,670\nThat person comes out and says yes, there\nhas been whatever's been committed, and\n\n563\n00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:07,000\nthey will lock the area down and\nmake notes of who's there.\n\n564\n00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,710\nEither keep the people in the area,\nor cuz those are witnesses now,\n\n565\n00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,110\nor they will get names and\nphone numbers and stuff like that.\n\n566\n00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,390\nAnd they just make sure that\nnothing is tampered with or\n\n567\n00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:23,200\nmessed with until the forensic\nperson gets there, which is you.\n\n568\n00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,380\nNow you may be a first responder, but\n\n569\n00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,345\nmore than likely you're gonna\nget the former than a latter.\n\n570\n00:28:28,345 --> 00:28:29,954\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n571\n00:28:29,954 --> 00:28:33,205\nSo when we arrive, things might have\nalready been moved or touched, and\n\n572\n00:28:33,205 --> 00:28:34,928\nwe gotta kinda process that, right?\n\n573\n00:28:34,928 --> 00:28:40,810\nWe gotta figure out what was moved not\nby the target of my investigation.\n\n574\n00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,280\nBut people you know trying\nto do the right thing, and\n\n575\n00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,430\nthose first responders maybe got\na little over anxious or wanted to help,\n\n576\n00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:51,358\nbut they started unplugging computers,\nGod forbid or something crazy like that.\n\n577\n00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:54,120\nSo we gotta make sure we evaluate\nthe scene and see what's going on and\n\n578\n00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,990\ndocument everything the way it is\nbefore we start touching things right.\n\n579\n00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,260\nYet, you will see it's,\nyou bring up a very good point.\n\n580\n00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,750\nIn some companies, what they'll do,\nand this is the way it should be done,\n\n581\n00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,890\nis that there should be the general\nguidance out there that if\n\n582\n00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,990\nyou find something that you\nthink is a security incident or\n\n583\n00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,110\nsomething had happened,\nthey tell you, don't touch anything.\n\n584\n00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,680\nCall so and so and that's the first\nresponder we talked about and\n\n585\n00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,690\nthat person's gonna determine if it needs\nto be reported to a forensic staff.\n\n586\n00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,880\nOnce that first responder calls his\nforensic staff like we said yourself,\n\n587\n00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,890\nwhen they call you, you are gonna give\nthem instructions on what they should and\n\n588\n00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,230\nshouldn't be doing prior to your arrival.\n\n589\n00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,963\nSo, you will be instructing them,\nokay, what happened?\n\n590\n00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:45,865\nWhat's the nature of the incident?\n\n591\n00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:50,129\nTell them all, I wouldn't tell you all\nthat, and you're gonna tell them okay,\n\n592\n00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:54,810\nwell keep everybody on scene, or start\ngetting names and phone numbers for me.\n\n593\n00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:59,560\nTake your cell phone out and start taking\npictures of the state of the scene is.\n\n594\n00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,780\nAll that stuff.\n\n595\n00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,310\nYou will really do that thoroughly,\nwhen you get there though.\n\n596\n00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,820\nYou will thoroughly be evaluating\nthe scene to see what the state of it is,\n\n597\n00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,450\nwhat the state of the computers are there,\nthe physical environment.\n\n598\n00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,530\nYou'll be taking, for an example,\nif the screen is on on the computer,\n\n599\n00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,900\ntake a picture of what's on the screen.\n\n600\n00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,360\nIf the computer is asleep,\nyou'll be trying to wake\n\n601\n00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,830\nit up to get a picture of what's on there\nand making a note that it was asleep.\n\n602\n00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,200\nStuff like that.\n\n603\n00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,070\n>> So we need to know who\nreported the information,\n\n604\n00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,970\nwe want to make sure to track that.\n\n605\n00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:38,010\nWhat about any legal requirements we gonna\nworry about at this point in the game or?\n\n606\n00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:43,940\n>> The legal requirements, so that's one\nthat could very well pop into play here.\n\n607\n00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,310\nLet's just kinda take things\nout of a generic context and\n\n608\n00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:52,940\nput it in context of this is a company\nthat does Healthcare or Finance.\n\n609\n00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,290\nOr heck, you know,\nanything that's got a regulation.\n\n610\n00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,170\nSome sort of regulatory body or\nsomething on it.\n\n611\n00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,570\nThat does change it.\n\n612\n00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,080\nThat definitely changes it and\nCalifornia, believe it or not,\n\n613\n00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,620\nif you are a state agency, and\nthis is specific to that environment.\n\n614\n00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,460\nIf you're a state agency, you actually\nhave to be a, once you have a security\n\n615\n00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:20,880\nincident you have to contact\nthe California Highway Patrol.\n\n616\n00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,500\nAnd they're the ones that will take\na report, get it their database and\n\n617\n00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,240\nthen they'll tell you, yes go ahead and\nproceed with your clean up or\n\n618\n00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,730\nhold on we're gonna send some other people\nout there to investigate the scene.\n\n619\n00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,180\nThat's you handles it.\n\n620\n00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,810\n>> So as a Digital Forensic Investigator,\nI have to be aware of any type of\n\n621\n00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,500\nregulations like that, I might say look,\nif there's a crime that involves this,\n\n622\n00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,060\nyou need to contact this person, this\nperson, this person, and this agency, this\n\n623\n00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,750\nagency and then I can definitely change,\nas you said that's a California thing,\n\n624\n00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,380\ncould be different in Florida, could be\ndifferent in other countries as well.\n\n625\n00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,955\nSo, make sure you're aware of who it\nis I'm supposed to notify, before I\n\n626\n00:31:55,955 --> 00:32:00,011\nstart my investigation, or let people know\nthere is going to be an investigation.\n\n627\n00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:03,899\nAnd then collecting the evidence, would\nbe by the next phase we move into once we\n\n628\n00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,745\ngot that scene secured,\nwe've documented everything,\n\n629\n00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:10,019\nwe've dealt with our legal requirements,\nthen we go in to start.\n\n630\n00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:11,134\nTouching stuff?\n\n631\n00:32:11,134 --> 00:32:16,729\n>> Yes, you're going to be more or less be\nlike a kid on Christmas morning the first\n\n632\n00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:21,822\ntime you come into a crime, the first\nfew times you come to a crime scene,\n\n633\n00:32:21,822 --> 00:32:25,450\nyou're gonna want to get in it's like,\noh look.\n\n634\n00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,640\nI'm gonna start touching and\n\n635\n00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,180\nputting your tackle box down it has\nyour equipment in it or whatever.\n\n636\n00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,300\nYou're gonna put that down and\nstart doing it.\n\n637\n00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,310\nAnd that's not the time to do that.\n\n638\n00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,190\nWhat you do is you do the whole\nthing of evaluating a scene and\n\n639\n00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,470\ntaking the pictures.\n\n640\n00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,910\nThen, once you've got that, and\nI hope you've taken a lot of pictures.\n\n641\n00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,800\nYou've gotten your sketchbook out and\nsketched things.\n\n642\n00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,820\nAnd thoroughly, you've done all that.\n\n643\n00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,090\nOnce you've got that and\n\n644\n00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:53,020\ntaken very close note of what's there,\nthen start collecting.\n\n645\n00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:58,690\nThen start saying, okay, once I know\nthat's here, let me start removing cables,\n\n646\n00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:03,040\nlet me start taping over ports on\nthe front and making my annotations,\n\n647\n00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,400\nstuff like that.\n\n648\n00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,630\nThat's where we know where\nyou're going to handle that.\n\n649\n00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:12,370\nIt could even be at that point you could\nbe starting to build your images and\n\n650\n00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,120\nstuff like that.\n\n651\n00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,350\n>> Okay, and then dealing with whether\nthe computers turned on, whether\n\n652\n00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,750\nthe computers turned off, things like\nthat because remember we talked yesterday\n\n653\n00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,920\nabout volatility, having that order that\nwe wanna collect that information in.\n\n654\n00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,990\nWanna get that most volatile information\nfirst because that's the stuff we run\n\n655\n00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,470\nthe biggest chance of\nlosing as time goes on.\n\n656\n00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,880\nSo then once we've gathered that evidence,\nand guys, remember, we're going over kind\n\n657\n00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,060\nof a high level here because we've got\nthat really exciting demo coming up,\n\n658\n00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,940\nwhere we're going to go into\ndetail about this process.\n\n659\n00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,310\nSo we gather up our evidence\nbe it physical evidence,\n\n660\n00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,800\nbe it electronic evidence.\n\n661\n00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,060\nWe started again,\ncontinuing to secure the scene.\n\n662\n00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,320\nSecuring the evidence at this point.\n\n663\n00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,610\nMaking sure that as we collected that,\n\n664\n00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,430\nwe follow the proper procedures and\ndo what we need to do.\n\n665\n00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,410\nSo that falls into preserving\nthat evidence, right?\n\n666\n00:33:59,410 --> 00:33:59,910\n>> Yes.\n\n667\n00:34:01,085 --> 00:34:01,725\n>> And then what?\n\n668\n00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:07,135\nAnd so if we-\n>> Preserving the evidence, that would be,\n\n669\n00:34:07,135 --> 00:34:10,335\nlike you said the next step after\ncollecting, after collecting you need to\n\n670\n00:34:10,335 --> 00:34:13,505\nfigure out a way, once you've harvested,\nto make sure it stays preserved.\n\n671\n00:34:13,505 --> 00:34:16,655\nYou know there's one thing to say I'm\ngoing to reach inside a computer and\n\n672\n00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,875\nrip out the hard drive,\nI've collected, right?\n\n673\n00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,740\nTechnically you've completed that step.\n\n674\n00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,247\n>> [CROSSTALK] good to go right?\n\n675\n00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:23,310\n>> Yeah right, I'm done.\n\n676\n00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,360\nWho said this is so easy?\n\n677\n00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,770\nWho says this is difficult now?\n\n678\n00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,738\n[CROSSTALK] Frank up the soundtrack so\nthat's what the tendency,\n\n679\n00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:38,465\nor that's what, you would fulfill\nour requirement rather by pulling\n\n680\n00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:42,488\na hard drive out, but\nthat's not what we're looking for.\n\n681\n00:34:42,488 --> 00:34:47,340\nYou not only have to, yes,\npull that drive out, image it.\n\n682\n00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,470\nOnce you image it, you have to make\nsure that image is forensically sound.\n\n683\n00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:55,090\nNow, granted,\nwe haven't gotten to that point yet.\n\n684\n00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,770\nWe are still at the initial point\nwhere we're getting that so\n\n685\n00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:03,140\nwe can take it back to the lab,\nand do our evaluation there.\n\n686\n00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,190\n>> So in most cases we do,\na lot of that drive imaging.\n\n687\n00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,600\nBack at the lab not at the scene.\n\n688\n00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,450\nAt the scene we just preserve\nthe evidence, get it ready for\n\n689\n00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,770\ntransport and take it back?\n\n690\n00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,386\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay.\n\n691\n00:35:13,386 --> 00:35:17,365\nAll right, and will read\nthe question in the chat room asks,\n\n692\n00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,574\nam I allowed to open locked drawers,\net cetera?\n\n693\n00:35:20,574 --> 00:35:25,498\nAnd I think that one you're probably\nbetter at this than me what\n\n694\n00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,230\ndo you think on that one?\n\n695\n00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,770\n>> Yeah,\nyou probably saw me kinda like, hum.\n\n696\n00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:34,760\nYeah my feeling is,\nask your legal department.\n\n697\n00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,440\n>> Yeah, because that's gonna vary\nbetween different businesses and\n\n698\n00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,680\nwhat their company policy is.\n\n699\n00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,320\nSome public companies might give you that\nright to privacy, and if it's documented,\n\n700\n00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,940\nyour employee jacket or your handbook or\nwhat have you, that one locked drawer that\n\n701\n00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,230\nyou get is just private, and I might\nneed a warrant to go into that drawer.\n\n702\n00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,990\n>> There you go.\n\n703\n00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,320\n>> Or other organizations might,\nin their employee hiring process,\n\n704\n00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,810\nsay look, everything is company property,\nand there is no expectation of privacy.\n\n705\n00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,250\nAnd in that phase, with that company,\nmaybe I don't need it.\n\n706\n00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,330\nBut I can't tell you, right?\n\n707\n00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,190\nThat's something that I don't think\neither one of us can really say,\n\n708\n00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,310\nyou're going to have to talk to\nthe organization to be sure on that.\n\n709\n00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,495\nWe don't want to give you any\nlegal advice at this point.\n\n710\n00:36:12,495 --> 00:36:13,330\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n711\n00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,630\nWhen in doubt, check it out.\n\n712\n00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,042\n>> Exactly.\n\n713\n00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:21,360\n>> I can effectively if I\nneed to as a forensic person,\n\n714\n00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,600\nif I need to have something checked out,\nI can say, hey this scene is secured and\n\n715\n00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,940\nlocked down until I get\nclearance to go in there.\n\n716\n00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,200\nI would not have a problem doing that,\nI would not have a problem saying if\n\n717\n00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,520\nit's locking off that room and\nsaying, done, no one enters that room\n\n718\n00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,700\nuntil I've got clearance to figure out\nif I am allowed to do such and such.\n\n719\n00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,950\nAlways, always think about that,\nthat's a great question\n\n720\n00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,570\neven though we're not going to get into\nsaying oh, this is the answer to it.\n\n721\n00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,120\nThat's what you should be asking,\n\n722\n00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,700\nbecause yeah, you're going to\nsay I don't know what to do.\n\n723\n00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,530\nWell, what do you do at that point?\n\n724\n00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,510\nStop what you're doing and\nmake some calls.\n\n725\n00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:09,340\nYou know that's a legal issue, call legal\nand let them tell you how to proceed.\n\n726\n00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,210\n>> We talked about that yesterday, having\ndifferent people on your team that have\n\n727\n00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,400\ndifferent areas of expertise because\neven if I'm in that sales department and\n\n728\n00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,570\nthat sales manager says yeah,\ngo into the desk, get whatever you need.\n\n729\n00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,680\nDoes that guy really have the authority\nto give me that permission?\n\n730\n00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,430\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n731\n00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,120\nI'm not gonna take that chance because\nif I do, we've seen the shows right?\n\n732\n00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,219\nIf I do go in there and find evidence\nthat I'd really need to use in this case,\n\n733\n00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:34,450\nthat defense attorney turns around and\ngets it all thrown out because I didn't\n\n734\n00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,592\nuse proper legal procedures\nto collect the evidence, and\n\n735\n00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:40,730\nnow the guy goes free because\nof some mistake that we made,\n\n736\n00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:44,962\nso you definitely want to cover your\nbases, check with the legal department,\n\n737\n00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:48,794\nsee what is necessary to get into\nlocked areas, and things like that.\n\n738\n00:37:48,794 --> 00:37:49,824\n>> Absolutely.\n\n739\n00:37:49,824 --> 00:37:53,720\n>> All right, so we've preserved\nthat evidence, we acquire our data.\n\n740\n00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,670\nNow that was acquiring the data from\nthe scene, or back at the crime lab?\n\n741\n00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,100\nFor our forensics lab.\n\n742\n00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,710\n>> It could be mixture of both.\n\n743\n00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,480\nIt could definitely be a mixture of both.\n\n744\n00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,040\nIf part of your crime scene\nincludes a printer that's got hard\n\n745\n00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,840\ncopy sitting on it, well,\nyou're gonna acquire that right there.\n\n746\n00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,520\nYou're gonna take those things and\nslip it in a bag and seal it up,\n\n747\n00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,320\nand sign off on it and everything.\n\n748\n00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,450\nAnd that's the end of it.\n\n749\n00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:24,090\nIn imaging equipment,\nthat to be a different story.\n\n750\n00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,780\nYou may not have the stuff\nright there to do imaging.\n\n751\n00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,370\nYou should.\n\n752\n00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:33,600\nBut that stuff is pricy and so sometimes\ncompanies aren't going to spring for it.\n\n753\n00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,880\nBut you can have a forensic\nwork station back in your lab,\n\n754\n00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,970\nso you can collect it, preserve it,\nmake sure it's not touched.\n\n755\n00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,020\nAnd then get it back to the lab.\n\n756\n00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,670\nSo that would be a very important thing.\n\n757\n00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:53,190\nNow something I would throw into this,\nis when we're going through this process,\n\n758\n00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,290\nwe're talking about evaluating,\ncollecting, preserving,\n\n759\n00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,910\nacquiring, you know, going through that.\n\n760\n00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,670\nSomething to think about is,\nwhen you take this stuff back to the lab,\n\n761\n00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,750\ndo you have that equipment\nthere to evaluate it?\n\n762\n00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:10,320\nSo, they joke around about\nthings all the time about well,\n\n763\n00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,940\nwhat if someone's got a work station\nwith eight inch floppy in it?\n\n764\n00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,208\nI'm going to say they're\nguilty of being old, and so.\n\n765\n00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,820\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n766\n00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,630\nOr do I have an 8-inch floppy back in\nthe lab that I can throw that drive in or\n\n767\n00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,050\nsomething like that.\n\n768\n00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,620\nBack to our earlier theme that we\nwere doing with the NCIS, I remember,\n\n769\n00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,530\nI think it was NCIS.\n\n770\n00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:33,930\nWell one of the cases, the guy had\nused an old looking laptop, right?\n\n771\n00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,410\nAnd they didn't think anything of it,\nbut when they got it back to the lab,\n\n772\n00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:43,020\nthey started poking around, and\nthey're like, wait, when did USB come out?\n\n773\n00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:48,320\nThey had carved out this old laptop\ncase and put a modern motherboard and\n\n774\n00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,060\nit was a great place to hide stuff because\nnobody ever thought to look there.\n\n775\n00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,930\nSo you have to keep\nthe technology into consideration.\n\n776\n00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,126\nAnother great question from the chatroom,\n\n777\n00:39:58,126 --> 00:40:01,161\nDeborah asks what about\nthe computer skills of the suspect?\n\n778\n00:40:01,161 --> 00:40:04,101\nIs that something that's going\nto come into our process or\n\n779\n00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,084\ndecision making process or anything?\n\n780\n00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:10,507\n>> Absolutely,\nit's going to be part of it.\n\n781\n00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:17,200\nIn fact,\nwe referenced this a little bit yesterday.\n\n782\n00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,771\nIf you recall we were talking about hiding\nstuff in that vendor's partition on\n\n783\n00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:22,750\nthe drive.\n\n784\n00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,820\nThat's not something that a normal\nperson's gonna know how to do.\n\n785\n00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,280\n>> Bob in sales might not\nbe able to do that but\n\n786\n00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,400\nif I'm investigating one of my sys admins\nor one of my programmers that might\n\n787\n00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,960\nchange how I go about the investigation\nthen and where I look for information.\n\n788\n00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,580\n>> Yeah, you do need to consider that\nbecause that opens up a lot more\n\n789\n00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,830\npossibilities.\n\n790\n00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,500\nThose of you who have been\nthrough the CEH class,\n\n791\n00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:50,540\nyou know there's a lot of ways that\nwe talked about covering your tracks.\n\n792\n00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:55,050\nThose things for covering your tracks, a\nlot of them are things that people aren't\n\n793\n00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:00,910\naware of, and\nthe average Joe isn't aware of.\n\n794\n00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:06,210\nI can tell you for example something that,\neven the high level\n\n795\n00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:11,735\npeople would not be aware of, or I should\nsay a lot of high level people don't\n\n796\n00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:15,885\ntake into account is, that they go through\na drive and instead of wiping the drive or\n\n797\n00:41:15,885 --> 00:41:18,855\nanything, they start deleting all\ntheir information off of it and\n\n798\n00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:22,395\nblanking and trying to get rid of\ncertain things off the computer.\n\n799\n00:41:22,395 --> 00:41:26,775\nAnd they're like okay, good,\nI took out all those harmful files and\n\n800\n00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,765\nI wiped those spots on\nthe drive where they were.\n\n801\n00:41:28,765 --> 00:41:29,295\nHey, we're good.\n\n802\n00:41:29,295 --> 00:41:32,030\nThey didn't do a whole drive wipe,\nbut they just went through and\n\n803\n00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,198\nwiped those spots on the drive.\n\n804\n00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:39,180\nWell, I dunno,\nwe'll kinda put it out there.\n\n805\n00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,170\nHow many people know what an LNK file is,\n\n806\n00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,195\nright off the top of your head,\nwithout looking for it?\n\n807\n00:41:46,195 --> 00:41:48,115\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just ask yourself that, and\n\n808\n00:41:48,115 --> 00:41:50,170\nyou know what LNK file is?\n\n809\n00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:50,760\n>> I'm assuming no.\n\n810\n00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,790\nActually I don't think I do.\n\n811\n00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,490\nUnless you're talking\nabout like a link file.\n\n812\n00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,000\n>> It's, yeah.\n\n813\n00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,530\n>> Is it like a symbolic link or\na directory link type thing?\n\n814\n00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,120\n>> Yeah, you're right there with it.\n\n815\n00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,850\nYeah, if you're still grinding\non what an LNK file is,\n\n816\n00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:08,140\nan LNK file is something\nthat is in Windows.\n\n817\n00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:12,780\nWhen you open a file, it actually\nis a symbolic link to that file.\n\n818\n00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,140\nIt's what shows up in\nthe shortcut menu and everything.\n\n819\n00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,100\nThey get cleaned out of there all the time\nwhen you start doing things that hold\n\n820\n00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,560\nmost recently used stuff.\n\n821\n00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,060\nThey get cleaned out, and\nwhen they get cleaned out and\n\n822\n00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,860\nfloat, they get deleted by the system.\n\n823\n00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:31,040\nBut I can do a file recovery on\nthose things and find out where\n\n824\n00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,370\nfrom that link itself, where the file\nactually was on that system.\n\n825\n00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,880\nAnd that may be enough metadata\nto give me the evidence I need.\n\n826\n00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,460\n>> Wow, crazy.\n\n827\n00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,830\n>> Yeah, like I said, that's something\nthat you know, you're talking about\n\n828\n00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:52,270\na situation where, you have the average\nJoe is not gonna figure out.\n\n829\n00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,990\nI was waiting for you here to say,\nnot picking on you,\n\n830\n00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:58,170\nI was waiting for you Mike to say when I\nasked you if you knew what a link file is,\n\n831\n00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,216\nwhen you said oh, URL, LNK file you said,\nit's a link sometimes,\n\n832\n00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:04,335\nyou're getting it off the extension and\nstart describing it.\n\n833\n00:43:04,335 --> 00:43:06,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, fair enough.\n\n834\n00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,710\n>> LNK link, I'm gonna assume,\nI can play it off pretty well.\n\n835\n00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,580\n>> Yeah, it's cool.\n\n836\n00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:17,236\nI was looking for, to be fair,\nyou're also not an average computer\n\n837\n00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:23,500\nuser that's just clicking on stuff\naround so that kinda proves the point.\n\n838\n00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,562\nBut if I hadn't brought up LNK file you\nmay have gone the rest of your career,\n\n839\n00:43:27,562 --> 00:43:30,750\nwho knows, without ever knowing\nwhat that is, or caring.\n\n840\n00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:31,700\n>> Absolutely.\n\n841\n00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,210\n>> So you need to be thinking\nabout those type of things.\n\n842\n00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:39,844\nSo, I don't know how many of you that's\nyour first time hearing about it,\n\n843\n00:43:39,844 --> 00:43:43,154\nlooks like in the chat room\nsome of you are aware of it,\n\n844\n00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:46,585\nyou know, I don't know if\nyou Googled it or whatever.\n\n845\n00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:48,490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or just knew it, but\n\n846\n00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,200\nthat's something to think about,\n\n847\n00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,080\ndo consider the skill level of\nthe person who committed the crime.\n\n848\n00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,990\n>> Absolutely.\nAll right, so we gather all this data up,\n\n849\n00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,400\nwe secure it,\nwe've done our process there.\n\n850\n00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,030\nWe get it back to our forensics lab.\n\n851\n00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,740\nNow it's time to actually look at this\ninformation and start breaking down,\n\n852\n00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,750\nanalyzing our data, right?\n\n853\n00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:10,330\nAnd hopefully, we've got all\nkinds of information to look at.\n\n854\n00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,440\n>> Yeah, there's all sorts of toys\nyou can have that can do this.\n\n855\n00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,450\nAnd let me just kind of\nthrow something in here,\n\n856\n00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:24,246\nit's not mentioned in here in the process\nwe're talking about directly,\n\n857\n00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:27,910\nyou know, but it is something\nthat you'll have to deal with.\n\n858\n00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:34,890\nIf I'm sitting here, and this is\nthe crime scene, I collect the stuff.\n\n859\n00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:39,670\nAnd you know, I'm preserving it,\nand getting it ready for transport.\n\n860\n00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:45,100\nYou gotta figure out, you know, how you're\ngoing to safely get it back to your lab.\n\n861\n00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,400\nAnd safe does not just mean that\nit's gotta be locked down and\n\n862\n00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,560\nyou've gotta maintain that chain of\ncustody from the time it leaves here 'til\n\n863\n00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:56,222\nit goes back to the lab, you gotta think\nabout when you put it in your car.\n\n864\n00:44:56,222 --> 00:45:00,400\nYou're gonna have to\nstrap the stuff down and\n\n865\n00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,170\nmake sure you have cases\nto put the stuff in.\n\n866\n00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:08,820\nOn top of that, on some cars you can\n\n867\n00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,680\nput a computer there that may be sensitive\nto it, like tapes, you may actually have\n\n868\n00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,110\ntapes and stuff like that, that there\nmay be a big enough magnetic field or\n\n869\n00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:22,150\nsomething in some spot in your car that\ncan wipe those things on the way back.\n\n870\n00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,250\n>> Yeah [LAUGH]\n>> You do not want to have to explain\n\n871\n00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,440\nthat one.\n\n872\n00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,700\nNow I know some of you car guys that\nare more knowledgeable than me might say,\n\n873\n00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,250\nwell that's unlikely.\n\n874\n00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,930\nYeah, unlikely, it's not impossible.\n\n875\n00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,340\nIt has happened.\n\n876\n00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,500\n>> Have you seen John's car?\n\n877\n00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,480\nHe's got like 22 inch woofers back there.\n\n878\n00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,952\nThese magnets are the size of my face.\n\n879\n00:45:39,952 --> 00:45:42,005\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n880\n00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:45,650\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nwe get all that back.\n\n881\n00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,270\nWe start analyzing that data,\n\n882\n00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:52,250\nlooking for evidence obviously of whatever\nwe determine in our goals earlier, right?\n\n883\n00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,130\nWe had our goals set up before\nwe started this process, so\n\n884\n00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,990\nwe've got a good idea of what we're\ntrying to find or what we're looking for.\n\n885\n00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:03,325\nAnd so now it's a matter of getting all\nthat out and starting to break it down,\n\n886\n00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:07,785\nright, and looking at it and\nanalysing or assessing that evidence.\n\n887\n00:46:07,785 --> 00:46:09,385\n>> Yeah, you may be reassembling stuff.\n\n888\n00:46:09,385 --> 00:46:12,335\nYou may be setting stuff back up.\n\n889\n00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:16,070\nYou may actually have the system\nitself brought with you,\n\n890\n00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:17,990\nthat has been known to happen.\n\n891\n00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:24,160\nLet's say you go on scene and there's\nRAID drive in that system, that's a more,\n\n892\n00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,100\nnot incredibly exotic, but it's a more\nexotic setup with a hardware-based array.\n\n893\n00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,710\nSo, you may just say,\nseize the computer, okay.\n\n894\n00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,100\nAnother interesting one,\ntalk about the transport and\n\n895\n00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,900\ntaking it back to the lab and analyzing\nit is, how urgent that's gonna be.\n\n896\n00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,170\nYeah, there is that volatility, you know,\nwhat happens if that computer you have\n\n897\n00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:50,970\nsitting there on that crime scene,\nif that computer is on, and you can't\n\n898\n00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,640\ndo the imaging and do all that recovery\nthere and you need to preserve that,\n\n899\n00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,940\nthe guidance here is, if it's off,\nleave it off, if it's on, leave it on.\n\n900\n00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,150\nOkay, but I gotta take it back to the lab,\nhow do I get it back there?\n\n901\n00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,930\nWell, if it's a tower or a desktop system,\n\n902\n00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:13,430\nsomething like that other than a laptop,\nwhat you're gonna do is, you are going to,\n\n903\n00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:18,700\nyou need to figure out a way to either\nbring your stuff there to preserve it.\n\n904\n00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,760\nOr they actually sell devices where\nyou can go into the wall socket and\n\n905\n00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,640\nactually unhook the wall socket and\npull it out and\n\n906\n00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,300\nclip alligator clips into the power stuff\nand just cut the wires and take it out.\n\n907\n00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,290\nAnd then you just take the thing and\nput it in,\n\n908\n00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,480\nit's got its own little\npelican style case.\n\n909\n00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,360\nYou put everything in there, it's got\na battery that lasts for several hours.\n\n910\n00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,450\nYou could even plug it into your car or\nvehicle and\n\n911\n00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:47,140\ntransport it and take it with you and\nstay on it all the way to whatever it is.\n\n912\n00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,750\n>> I've never seen one of those,\nI'm gonna look for that.\n\n913\n00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,040\n>> Yeah, they're pretty neat, yeah.\n\n914\n00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,620\nThey're a pretty neat thing to see.\n\n915\n00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,291\nThey're gonna be kind of pricey but,\nyou know,\n\n916\n00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,898\nif you're doing that\ntype of investigation and\n\n917\n00:47:58,898 --> 00:48:03,470\nthis is your staple that's an investment\nthat you basically have to have.\n\n918\n00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:06,158\nNow if it's a notebook\nthat you gotta take back,\n\n919\n00:48:06,158 --> 00:48:09,249\nwell you got the battery\nthere it's a different story.\n\n920\n00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:12,952\nI would say, still make sure you have\na charger and everything on it, and\n\n921\n00:48:12,952 --> 00:48:15,459\nstuff available for\nit that kind of makes sense.\n\n922\n00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,792\nBut, also, something else you\nshould do is just a safety measure.\n\n923\n00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:21,730\nIf this things off,\nI'm pulling the battery out.\n\n924\n00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:24,377\nI do not want to take a chance\nof that coming back on.\n\n925\n00:48:24,377 --> 00:48:25,073\n>> That's a good idea.\n\n926\n00:48:25,073 --> 00:48:28,450\n>> So, that's kind of the stuff in there.\n\n927\n00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,169\nWe can't really talk too\nmuch about that in here,\n\n928\n00:48:31,169 --> 00:48:35,590\nbecause there's too many specifics and\nthings that could happen in transport.\n\n929\n00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:38,457\nI don't know, you could be a forensic\ninvestigator in Alaska, and\n\n930\n00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,233\nyou gotta load it on a plane I don't know.\n\n931\n00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:41,930\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n932\n00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:45,405\n>> It's just all sorts of situations.\n\n933\n00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:48,330\n>> [LAUGH] And\nthen the last phase of it's gonna be, and\n\n934\n00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:52,440\nwe're going to go into much more detail\non this later on, but so we cover it now,\n\n935\n00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,620\nis the preparing that final report.\n\n936\n00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,360\nOnce we've gone through and\n\n937\n00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,280\ndone all of our analysis\n>> Yeah the final report's gonna be a big,\n\n938\n00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,890\nbig thing you gotta do and\nit's gonna have to be very, very detailed,\n\n939\n00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:10,690\nit's gonna have to provide what you found,\nthe pictures, the sketches.\n\n940\n00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,570\nLike I said, do sketches on site.\n\n941\n00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,020\nSee what's there, make notes,\neven the most insignificant thing\n\n942\n00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,660\ncould be that one detail you need,\nso don't just shine something off.\n\n943\n00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,300\nGet a good sketch of it.\n\n944\n00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,970\nMake sure you got those photos.\n\n945\n00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,110\nThat should all be put together and\nlabeled clearly when you\n\n946\n00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:34,720\ntake the pictures, labeled clearly on the\npicture itself and then, you know, with\n\n947\n00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,000\nthe date and time and everything on it and\nthen should all be included in the report.\n\n948\n00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,910\nAnd, that report will even,\nmay even have stuff like\n\n949\n00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:48,690\nSD cards with it and things like\nthat are included as part of it.\n\n950\n00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,690\nIt could be going off to someone\nelse after you do that, but\n\n951\n00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:55,440\nyou'll have to do that report, and\nfigure out the level of detail.\n\n952\n00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,490\nThat and well you're gonna have\na good amount of detail in there.\n\n953\n00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:00,420\nJust how it's gonna be organized cuz\nyou're gonna have to figure out.\n\n954\n00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,850\nSomeone's gonna be reading it, and-\n>> Right and\n\n955\n00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:05,030\nyou gotta determine who that audience is.\n\n956\n00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,160\nHow technical are they?\n\n957\n00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,280\nIt might make a difference in the version\nof the report they get, possibly,\n\n958\n00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,760\nwhether it's going to a lawyer or another\ninvestigator, whether it's going to\n\n959\n00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:20,650\nthe CEO in a corporate case, they might\nnot need the breakdown on the sectors and\n\n960\n00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:25,250\nthings like that on a hard drive, so\nwe can curtail the report to our audience.\n\n961\n00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:28,780\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nlooking at our clock, it's about time for\n\n962\n00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,610\nus to take a break, so\nwe're gonna stop here but don't go away.\n\n963\n00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:34,180\nWhen we come back,\nwe're going to have some fun stuff for\n\n964\n00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,820\nyou guys to participate in so stay tuned.\n\n965\n00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,252\n>> We gotta get the body\nout of the fridge.\n\n966\n00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:40,418\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n967\n00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:42,031\nHang up the pigs.\n\n968\n00:50:42,031 --> 00:50:44,478\nWe'll be right back.\n[SOUND]\n\n969\n00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:48,626\nAll right.\n\n970\n00:50:48,626 --> 00:50:50,240\nWelcome back, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n971\n00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,270\nSo we have a surprise for you guys here.\n\n972\n00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:56,200\nWell, maybe not quite a surprise\nsince we gave you a hint, right?\n\n973\n00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,290\nIt's demo time.\n\n974\n00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:00,030\nWe're gonna take a look at putting\nsome of the stuff that we've learned\n\n975\n00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,790\nalready into action.\n\n976\n00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:02,290\nRight?\n\n977\n00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,300\nSo Shawn has set up a little area here for\nus.\n\n978\n00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,788\nAnd we're gonna play crime scene or\ndigital forensic investigator.\n\n979\n00:51:11,788 --> 00:51:16,663\nRight?\n>> Yeah, we're gonna kinda go through\n\n980\n00:51:16,663 --> 00:51:19,775\na suspected crime scene.\n\n981\n00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:22,255\nThat's the key word, suspected,\n\n982\n00:51:22,255 --> 00:51:26,472\nwhen we trace some unusual\nactivity back to this system, and\n\n983\n00:51:26,472 --> 00:51:31,730\nwe have an employee that uses a system\nthat happens to be on vacation.\n\n984\n00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:37,410\nAnd so what we're gonna do is we did\nsome initial checks, and our IT staff,\n\n985\n00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:41,530\nand with our other forensic staff has\ntraced things back to this system.\n\n986\n00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:44,680\nSo what we need to do is we need to,\nwhile this employees gone.\n\n987\n00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,540\nGet this out of here.\n\n988\n00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,430\nTake it to our lab to image it and\ndo some checks on it.\n\n989\n00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:52,260\nAnd then presuming later on\nwe're going to put it back.\n\n990\n00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:56,150\nWe won't do that here, but we'll just\ngonna worry about acquiring the evidence.\n\n991\n00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,880\nAnd going through the process\nwe just talked about.\n\n992\n00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,945\nSo that's our goal right here\nis to accomplish that task and\n\n993\n00:52:02,945 --> 00:52:08,210\nget this thing out of here and get it\nprepped to be imaged back in our lab.\n\n994\n00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,100\n>> Nice, nice all right.\n\n995\n00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,936\nSo I am Maghee James, those out there\nask who is Maghee I'm the probee,\n\n996\n00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:19,774\nI'm the one that's gonna, you know\nhelping out my senior partner here\n\n997\n00:52:19,774 --> 00:52:24,955\nAgent Gibbs in the field, and then he can\nbe Abby when he gets back to the lab.\n\n998\n00:52:24,955 --> 00:52:28,183\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let me go get you your coffee and\n\n999\n00:52:28,183 --> 00:52:30,894\nI'll be right back [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah there you go\n\n1000\n00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:32,720\n>> Alright so here we are,\n\n1001\n00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,170\nwe've been called in.\n\n1002\n00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:38,970\nThis employee,\nthere's some suspicious activity\n\n1003\n00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:43,220\nthat seems to be coming from\nthis one employee's workstation.\n\n1004\n00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,960\nSo that employee's on vacation so the\ncompany's decided that now's a great time\n\n1005\n00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,840\nto call us in and have us investigate\nto see what we can find out.\n\n1006\n00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:56,083\nSo here we are, we're at the scene,\nthe employee himself is not here,\n\n1007\n00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:57,730\nwhere the heck do we start?\n\n1008\n00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:01,358\nWell, we went through our process and\nso we talked about what,\n\n1009\n00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:05,807\nwhen we went through that process we\ntalked about the first thing being that we\n\n1010\n00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,650\ndetermine what our goals are gonna be.\n\n1011\n00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:15,280\nSo that's what we're gonna get clear,\nas the forensic team,\n\n1012\n00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,580\nand based on the situation here,\nit's gonna be a human resources case.\n\n1013\n00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,290\nSomeone's misusing or\nsuspected of misusing\n\n1014\n00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:27,480\ncompany resources there's been\na reason why we were called out here.\n\n1015\n00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,640\nAnd the reason why left it kinda vague is\nmaybe human resources didn't decide to\n\n1016\n00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:36,060\ntell us specifically what it was for\nlegal reasons, it could come down to,\n\n1017\n00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,330\nthey're just gonna say,\nit's been activity traced down to here.\n\n1018\n00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:42,500\nWe need an image of that, we need to\npreserve an image of that system and\n\n1019\n00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,810\nsee what state it's in\nwhile this employees away.\n\n1020\n00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:48,580\nAnd then we need you to\ntell us what's there.\n\n1021\n00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,180\nAnd then we'll go from there.\n\n1022\n00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,170\nSo it's something like that.\n\n1023\n00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:55,800\nSo we've got our goals.\n\n1024\n00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:02,470\nAnd, by the way, just to kinda step\noutside the scenario for a bit, you know,\n\n1025\n00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:07,380\nthe way to make sure this is clear is\nI'll play the role of being kind of\n\n1026\n00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,680\na pseudo lead here, I'm not just gonna\ngo ahead and run the thing myself.\n\n1027\n00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,685\nI'll start talking about the process\ngiving suggestions and things like that.\n\n1028\n00:54:17,685 --> 00:54:21,920\nBut, Mike here's acting,\noh sorry probie is here and-\n\n1029\n00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,021\n>> [LAUGH] There ya go.\n\n1030\n00:54:24,021 --> 00:54:28,815\n>> And is doing his thing, so if you have\n\n1031\n00:54:28,815 --> 00:54:34,305\nthings you suggest or you think should\nbe done, go ahead and chime in.\n\n1032\n00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:37,150\nHe's checking at that and\nI'm glancing over at it too.\n\n1033\n00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:40,283\nYou know, we're all on this together, so\nyou know there is always a bit of a delay\n\n1034\n00:54:40,283 --> 00:54:43,480\n[CROSSTALK] but yeah, Brit, just go ahead\nand start putting your suggestions up.\n\n1035\n00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,693\n>> Yeah, you guys help us out, tell us\nwhat the next step of the phase is or\n\n1036\n00:54:46,693 --> 00:54:48,817\nwhat you might do next and\nwe'll either do it or\n\n1037\n00:54:48,817 --> 00:54:51,440\ntalk about why we wouldn't do that next or\nwhat have you.\n\n1038\n00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,940\nSo, let's make this interactive.\n\n1039\n00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,630\nSo, we've set our goal first, right?\n\n1040\n00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,640\nWe talked about our procedure.\n\n1041\n00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,250\nThe first thing is we had to decide\nwhat it is we're trying to do,\n\n1042\n00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,660\nwhat our goals were.\n\n1043\n00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,040\nAnd as Shawn pointed out, the HR\npeople said that something suspicious,\n\n1044\n00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,310\nthey haven't given us a lot of detail,\nbut something's been going on and\n\n1045\n00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,420\nit's suspected that it's\ncoming from this device.\n\n1046\n00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,060\nSo we've been called in,\nwe're at the scene.\n\n1047\n00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,640\nAnd I think somebody in the chatroom\nhas already put out there.\n\n1048\n00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,650\nBen said preserve the scene?\n\n1049\n00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:20,030\nDeverin says yep and\ndocument what's on the screen.\n\n1050\n00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:22,610\nAnd take pictures.\n\n1051\n00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,320\nThat sound like a good start point?\n\n1052\n00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,110\n>> Yeah,\nwe're starting at a good spot where\n\n1053\n00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,600\nwe've got several things\nhappening that are suggestions.\n\n1054\n00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,960\nWhich is great.\n\n1055\n00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,970\nBut if you were looking at\nthe process we went through,\n\n1056\n00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:39,030\nwe said we were evaluating\nsecurity on the scene.\n\n1057\n00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,690\nThat was the first thing we're doing.\n\n1058\n00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:45,690\nSo when we look at our scene here,\nwe're gonna see what we have.\n\n1059\n00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,310\nAnd it I'm gonna kind of you know,\n\n1060\n00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,440\ngive you a kind of idea cuz we\ngotta kind of paint some stuff in.\n\n1061\n00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,740\nThe scene we have here,\nyou know, we're looking at it.\n\n1062\n00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,920\nWe're saying this is the employee's\noffice and he's on vacation.\n\n1063\n00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,870\n>> It's a mess.\n\n1064\n00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:02,520\n>> Yeah,\nthere's a lot of stuff happening here.\n\n1065\n00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,320\nWe can see a document here.\n\n1066\n00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,708\nLooks like there's some\nother items laying out here.\n\n1067\n00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:12,969\nWe can see that there's,\nwe didn't put a monitor up here.\n\n1068\n00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,340\nBut just assume there's one there.\n\n1069\n00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,067\nWe do have a monitor cable in here,\njust to kinda give you that.\n\n1070\n00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:20,929\nWe didn't wanna clutter too\nmuch stuff up here, but\n\n1071\n00:56:20,929 --> 00:56:24,720\nanything you wanna add to that\nMike that we're seeing or?\n\n1072\n00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,726\n>> Let's see.\nI've got.\n\n1073\n00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:30,415\nI got some hardware laying out on\nthe desk here, I don't know what\n\n1074\n00:56:30,415 --> 00:56:35,540\nhe's been doing with that,\nlooks like a fire ware card of some kind.\n\n1075\n00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,510\n>> Let me talk about something here.\n\n1076\n00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,450\nAgain.\n\n1077\n00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,390\nAgain, this isn't to pick on anybody.\n\n1078\n00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:42,650\nThe stuff that's happening here is great.\n\n1079\n00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:43,594\n>> I touched it.\n\n1080\n00:56:43,594 --> 00:56:44,174\n>> Yeah, you touched it.\n\n1081\n00:56:44,174 --> 00:56:45,022\n>> Oh my gosh.\n\n1082\n00:56:45,022 --> 00:56:45,939\n>> You disturbed the scene.\n\n1083\n00:56:45,939 --> 00:56:48,075\n>> This is why I'm a probie.\n\n1084\n00:56:48,075 --> 00:56:50,362\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Damn it, probie!\n\n1085\n00:56:50,362 --> 00:56:55,557\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's the thing is that yeah,\n\n1086\n00:56:55,557 --> 00:56:56,850\nyou do see it.\n\n1087\n00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:00,030\nYou're suppose to be observing, right now.\n\n1088\n00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:02,960\nSo, what you've got is\nwhat you should be having.\n\n1089\n00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,620\nIt's just some things to add into it.\n\n1090\n00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,380\n>> I'm just gonna take\na picture of that card there.\n\n1091\n00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,410\n>> There you go.\n\n1092\n00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,790\n>> And maybe take a picture\nof the whole scene here.\n\n1093\n00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:14,010\nAnd how about a picture of\nthe backside of the computer?\n\n1094\n00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,560\n>> That would be awesome.\n\n1095\n00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,750\nIn fact, if I was gonna do it,\nI would take it straight on.\n\n1096\n00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,786\n[CROSSTALK] We're not doing that here.\n\n1097\n00:57:19,786 --> 00:57:20,390\nWell, okay.\n\n1098\n00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:23,649\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We can kinda do it here in the real\n\n1099\n00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:24,700\nworld.\n\n1100\n00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,100\nYeah, you'd be looking dead on.\n\n1101\n00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,530\nAnd, if you have to take\nmultiple pictures of that,\n\n1102\n00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,050\nto capture the whole thing, do so.\n\n1103\n00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:36,028\nAgain, it's better to\noverdocument than underdocument.\n\n1104\n00:57:36,028 --> 00:57:41,230\nI'd rather discard those things later,\nthan not have it and have a gap.\n\n1105\n00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:44,570\nSo, just make sure you get\na good picture of that.\n\n1106\n00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:47,302\nYou should also, you know,\nI've got my notebook in here.\n\n1107\n00:57:47,302 --> 00:57:50,498\nI've got, and\nthis is something I make sure is in my,\n\n1108\n00:57:50,498 --> 00:57:52,991\nwhen I'm doing my stuff, I always have.\n\n1109\n00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:56,530\nYou know,\nI've got two writing instruments here.\n\n1110\n00:57:56,530 --> 00:58:01,720\nI've got a black pen here on me, but\nI've also got a mechanic pencil.\n\n1111\n00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,860\nWho knows what environment\nyou're gonna be in?\n\n1112\n00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,690\nInk runs out, ink dries out,\nyou should have more than one in here,\n\n1113\n00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:11,720\nbut I always got a pencil with me to\nhelp do my sketches, to do other things,\n\n1114\n00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,480\njust in case.\n\n1115\n00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,060\nYou never know.\n\n1116\n00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,976\nPencils seem to always work, right?\n\n1117\n00:58:14,976 --> 00:58:17,680\nSo just FYI.\n\n1118\n00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,288\n[LAUGH]\n>> Just for\n\n1119\n00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:21,875\nJames out there,\nthat was my probie mistake.\n\n1120\n00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:25,710\n[LAUGH]\n>> So that's the thing, as I was curious.\n\n1121\n00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,760\nNow, I know I and\nthe military use this stuff.\n\n1122\n00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,320\nYou might consider doing this.\n\n1123\n00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,950\nIt costs a little more, is you can get\nthe write anywhere books that, if they're\n\n1124\n00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:40,960\nwet or whatever, the paper doesn't get\ndestroyed, and then you have the pens.\n\n1125\n00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,750\nFischer makes these little space pens,\nthe pressurized ones,\n\n1126\n00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:48,820\nthat will write on anything wherever,\nunderwater, anything like that.\n\n1127\n00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,620\nThat's not a bad idea, if you think\nyou're gonna be doing fieldwork.\n\n1128\n00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,750\n>> Okay.\n>> You know, so just FYI.\n\n1129\n00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,587\nSo, that would be the first thing.\n\n1130\n00:58:55,587 --> 00:58:58,698\nAnd I'm just gonna lay those back here for\nright now.\n\n1131\n00:58:58,698 --> 00:59:02,551\nBut, yeah,\nthey also saw something else in here.\n\n1132\n00:59:02,551 --> 00:59:05,516\nJames brought up,\nwe're taking pictures and all that,\n\n1133\n00:59:05,516 --> 00:59:08,046\nand we're gonna get ready\nto go to the next step,\n\n1134\n00:59:08,046 --> 00:59:11,870\nwhich is actually when we know\nwe're gonna be interacting with it.\n\n1135\n00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:16,210\nIf we got to the step where you were gonna\ntag and bag that network card, yeah,\n\n1136\n00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:18,750\nwe would definitely wanna have gloves on.\n\n1137\n00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:24,190\nBut right now, yeah, we're going through\nand we are assessing what the scene is.\n\n1138\n00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:29,510\nMaking sure what's going on here,\ngetting a good idea of that.\n\n1139\n00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:33,340\nAnd like I said, you know what we\nhave right now is we've got and\n\n1140\n00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,290\nwe can go into kinda get you\nsome of it in a top shot,\n\n1141\n00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:40,400\njust kinda give you\na different angle on it.\n\n1142\n00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,060\nThe back of the computer is over here,\nyou know where the ports are so\n\n1143\n00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,980\nwe've got that.\n\n1144\n00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:52,440\nBut if we look from the top down, you\ncan actually leave it that way, Probie.\n\n1145\n00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,305\n>> Okay [LAUGH]\n>> What the hell.\n\n1146\n00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:59,298\n>> [LAUGH] Well,\nthat is the line of Probie.\n\n1147\n00:59:59,298 --> 01:00:01,249\n>> What'd I just say about being\na kid on Christmas morning?\n\n1148\n01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:02,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But yeah,\n\n1149\n01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:07,655\nif we look at the top down we can see,\nyou've got a keyboard laying there,\n\n1150\n01:00:07,655 --> 01:00:11,210\nthe keyboard it just\nhappens to be laying there.\n\n1151\n01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:16,320\nBut if we look around on the scene,\nthere's other stuff here that I can see.\n\n1152\n01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:22,205\nAnd I'll point it out for you, since\nit may not be entirely visible to you.\n\n1153\n01:00:22,205 --> 01:00:22,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1154\n01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:26,348\n>> We see that there is\nsomething over here.\n\n1155\n01:00:26,348 --> 01:00:31,733\nA little orange deal from from my what\nI see on here just to make it clear.\n\n1156\n01:00:31,733 --> 01:00:35,530\nThat's a USB cap for USB drive.\n\n1157\n01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:37,220\nPresumably for a USB drive.\n\n1158\n01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,390\nWe don't know.\n\n1159\n01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:41,770\nBut then we also have,\nyou know, obviously a pen here.\n\n1160\n01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:43,990\nBut then you've got\nhidden under the wires.\n\n1161\n01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:47,410\nWell, it's kind of off screen a bit but\nhidden under wires.\n\n1162\n01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,017\nI'll move it over.\n\n1163\n01:00:48,017 --> 01:00:54,237\nI'll just, you know,\noutside the scenario here.\n\n1164\n01:00:54,237 --> 01:00:55,640\nI'll move it here so\nyou can see a little bit better.\n\n1165\n01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,970\nI had, there was hidden over here in\none of these cables line up outside of\n\n1166\n01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:02,740\nthe shot, but I'll leave that right here.\n\n1167\n01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:09,040\nThere's a little blue device here,\nthat is just hanging out.\n\n1168\n01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,420\nSo, what you would be doing at this point,\n\n1169\n01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:15,230\nwhat you should be doing\nis sketching things out.\n\n1170\n01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:18,400\nNow, I know the way\nthings are laid out here,\n\n1171\n01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,930\nif we look at from our front shot here,\nyou can kinda see from this.\n\n1172\n01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:30,470\nIt's kinda limited, top view is kinda\nlimited, but we can kinda see things here.\n\n1173\n01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:33,900\nWhat you wanna do is you wanna sketch\nit out completely as possible.\n\n1174\n01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,150\nNo details insignificant.\n\n1175\n01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:40,608\nWhat I would want you to be doing, is I'd\nwant you to take photographs of this,\n\n1176\n01:01:40,608 --> 01:01:42,516\nas we did, as Mike over here did.\n\n1177\n01:01:42,516 --> 01:01:46,538\nBut also go ahead and sketch things out,\nget your notebook out,\n\n1178\n01:01:46,538 --> 01:01:50,355\nif you have a clipboard,\nwhatever sketch these things out.\n\n1179\n01:01:50,355 --> 01:01:55,033\nYou know, and nothing is insignificant.\n\n1180\n01:01:55,033 --> 01:01:58,475\nSee here, you know,\none of our team here said you know,\n\n1181\n01:01:58,475 --> 01:02:01,190\nhe said Ubique with a question mark.\n\n1182\n01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:03,160\nWell, we'd have to look that up.\n\n1183\n01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,978\nWe're not touching it yet.\n\n1184\n01:02:04,978 --> 01:02:07,931\nBut, you know, it's [CROSSTALK] you're\nalready starting to think about it.\n\n1185\n01:02:07,931 --> 01:02:09,753\n>> First assessment, isn't it?\n\n1186\n01:02:09,753 --> 01:02:10,857\n>> Yeah.\n\n1187\n01:02:10,857 --> 01:02:14,219\nYou could actually put that on your\nnotes when you go through it, going.\n\n1188\n01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:19,502\nA take a picture of that and\nput in your note saying\n\n1189\n01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:24,800\nblah blah blah at this location,\nit looks like.\n\n1190\n01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,390\nThat's your initial impression.\n\n1191\n01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:31,040\nWrite your initial impression down,\nand you know, you're good.\n\n1192\n01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,240\nAnd there, and there's just to kind of\nmove it for, or kinda show it to you.\n\n1193\n01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,020\nI'll, I'll pick it up here.\n\n1194\n01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:39,350\nIt's laying on the corner of the papers\nyou see, you see at the wide shot.\n\n1195\n01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,450\nIt's just the documents out here.\n\n1196\n01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:44,410\nThat had been laying\non this person's desk.\n\n1197\n01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:51,090\nSo we've evaluated the scene\nat this point, I think.\n\n1198\n01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:54,740\nIf anyone wants to kinda throw anything\nelse in there they think worth evaluating\n\n1199\n01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,490\nor adding at this point,\nyeah, go right ahead.\n\n1200\n01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:59,250\nYou know, you\n>> Hey,\n\n1201\n01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:03,610\nboss, I got a cable here that comes out\nand it doesn't go to anything over there.\n\n1202\n01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:04,990\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n1203\n01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,330\nIs that important?\n\n1204\n01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:07,330\n>> It might be.\n\n1205\n01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:13,750\nOnce we look at that a bit more, and\nthis is a good thing to note is that,\n\n1206\n01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:17,170\nthis thing is coming out\nof the back of the device.\n\n1207\n01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:19,670\nWe have this white cable\ncoming out of the device.\n\n1208\n01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,930\nIt doesn't go anywhere,\nit's just a loose plug.\n\n1209\n01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:24,010\nI can see the mouse.\n\n1210\n01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:27,570\nI can see at least we're imagining\nit plugged into the network,\n\n1211\n01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,820\nso that network cables plugged in.\n\n1212\n01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,420\nYou know we see a power cable, we know\nthere's we said there's a monitor plugged\n\n1213\n01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:37,800\nin a keyboard but low and behold, there's\nsomething out there that there's nothing\n\n1214\n01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:44,055\nplugged into it so, that's something that\nshould be, well is going to be noted.\n\n1215\n01:03:44,055 --> 01:03:45,105\nIs gonna be noted so, yeah.\n\n1216\n01:03:45,105 --> 01:03:47,755\n>> While we're taking a picture of that\nand know what a document of the fact that\n\n1217\n01:03:47,755 --> 01:03:52,065\nthis cable's here, but not plugged\ninto anything or something like that.\n\n1218\n01:03:52,065 --> 01:03:53,275\n>> Yeah, it's a good catch.\n\n1219\n01:03:53,275 --> 01:03:54,115\nSo absolutely, yeah, yeah.\n\n1220\n01:03:54,115 --> 01:03:57,078\n>> Probie's trying to make up for\nhis early mistakes.\n\n1221\n01:03:57,078 --> 01:03:57,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1222\n01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:59,250\n>> But yeah.\n\n1223\n01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:02,382\nSo we've got some good\nstuff like I said and\n\n1224\n01:04:02,382 --> 01:04:06,908\nif you have anything else you\nguys wanna add in go right ahead.\n\n1225\n01:04:06,908 --> 01:04:11,220\nAny distinguishing marks or anything,\nyou should be noting that, okay?\n\n1226\n01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,800\n>> The size of the dust\nbunnies on this thing.\n\n1227\n01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,983\n>> Yeah,\nthe size of the dust bunnies on it.\n\n1228\n01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:17,546\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All of that so.\n\n1229\n01:04:17,546 --> 01:04:20,717\nWe've got some good stuff at this point.\n\n1230\n01:04:20,717 --> 01:04:22,730\nNow, just wanna go through.\n\n1231\n01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:27,610\nI'm gonna grab it back from\nmy evidence kit back here.\n\n1232\n01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:31,690\nI'm gonna go through and\ngo through my check list.\n\n1233\n01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:34,930\nI'm gonna say okay, so\nwe evaluate and secure the scene.\n\n1234\n01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:36,580\nI'm checking that off the list.\n\n1235\n01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,280\nNext thing is collecting the evidence,\nokay?\n\n1236\n01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,960\nSo, we're gonna start, once we document\neverything, we've gotta get it saying,\n\n1237\n01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:48,270\nwe said our goal is to get\nthis thing out of here, so.\n\n1238\n01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:52,730\nThis evidence has to be documented,\nwhich, you know, we'll say,\n\n1239\n01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:56,210\nwe'll cross off our listing we've done\nby evaluating the scene and securing it.\n\n1240\n01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,740\n>> Okay.\n>> Now, we have to collect things and\n\n1241\n01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,340\nthat's a really kind of, good thing to do.\n\n1242\n01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:08,940\nOkay, so to collect our evidence,\nit's procedure, procedure, procedure.\n\n1243\n01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:14,050\nSo first thing you kind of got\nto do in this is you have to get\n\n1244\n01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:19,070\nthe good old rubber gloves on,\nand put these things on.\n\n1245\n01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:23,178\nYou should always have, always glove\nup to avoid any cross contamination.\n\n1246\n01:05:23,178 --> 01:05:26,048\n>> [SOUND]\n>> Or anything like that, so,\n\n1247\n01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:29,402\nyou should always go ahead and do this.\n\n1248\n01:05:29,402 --> 01:05:32,119\nAnd men remember if you're over\n50 then get annual check ups.\n\n1249\n01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:34,557\n>> [LAUGH] We're not going there.\n\n1250\n01:05:34,557 --> 01:05:39,130\n[LAUGH]\n>> What, come on?\n\n1251\n01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:40,454\nI care.\n\n1252\n01:05:40,454 --> 01:05:42,010\n>> It is nice that he cares.\n\n1253\n01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,364\n>> FYI,\nthis is something that they advised me,\n\n1254\n01:05:45,364 --> 01:05:50,610\nthis is from another area I've done\nwork in, when I did my EMT training,\n\n1255\n01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:54,480\nit kind of helps out here when you doing,\nwhen you do,\n\n1256\n01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:59,038\nin EMT they tell you're gonna be\nusing gloves for that too, for\n\n1257\n01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:04,026\nblood, and contamination,\nstuff like that, to keep the fluids and\n\n1258\n01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:10,232\nall that stuff off of you but here, we're\nnot doing it specifically for that reason.\n\n1259\n01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:14,020\n[LAUGH] Hopefully, but something I would\n\n1260\n01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:20,165\ntell you is that these things, latex\ngloves come in many different colors.\n\n1261\n01:06:20,165 --> 01:06:23,437\nYou can get them,\nthey had them at Home Depot in in blue.\n\n1262\n01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,921\n>> Yeah, in greens and blues.\n\n1263\n01:06:25,921 --> 01:06:31,202\n>> I would tell you to avoid the dark\ncolors because the darker colors,\n\n1264\n01:06:31,202 --> 01:06:36,947\nwhen you get those, what will happen\nis when you put your hands in there and\n\n1265\n01:06:36,947 --> 01:06:43,360\na mark gets on there you won't see it, and\nmaybe you wanna see it touch something.\n\n1266\n01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,600\nWhen you put your hands in something,\nmaybe you want to see what you left there\n\n1267\n01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,235\nbecause that might be a clue,\nthat might be whatever.\n\n1268\n01:06:49,235 --> 01:06:52,530\nSo, you can use them but\nyou don't have to and\n\n1269\n01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:55,330\nI would get,\nbased on what you're doing in here.\n\n1270\n01:06:55,330 --> 01:07:00,270\nGet something that's made for heavier use\nthen to use for something like EMT or\n\n1271\n01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:03,850\nmedical those things they are made for\nheavy use.\n\n1272\n01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:07,230\nIf they are poking out of case,\nsharp edges and\n\n1273\n01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,920\nstuff like that are gonna break them.\n\n1274\n01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:15,900\nAnd then, yeah, there's non latex too\nif you want, but you know whatever.\n\n1275\n01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,920\nRemember, it's gotta be something that\nwe're not going to leave fingerprints on\n\n1276\n01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,660\nthere it should be something that\nyou can feel stuff through it.\n\n1277\n01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,050\nWe went to Home Depot this morning and\n\n1278\n01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:25,220\nsaid you want mechanics gloves,\nit wouldn't work.\n\n1279\n01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,850\nIt's just not helpful for us.\n\n1280\n01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:31,680\n>> You're gonna lose your sense of feel\nand not be able to be as accurate.\n\n1281\n01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,650\n>> Exactly, so we're gonna be, you know,\n\n1282\n01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:40,750\nyou guys are out there on the Internet,\nbut you're still part of the team.\n\n1283\n01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:43,880\nWe're gonna be, you know, your hands here.\n\n1284\n01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:48,730\nWell, Mike's gonna be, so [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I feel like one of\n\n1285\n01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:51,170\nthose remote control robots.\n\n1286\n01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:54,215\nTell me what to do, guys.\n\n1287\n01:07:54,215 --> 01:07:58,765\n>> Yeah,it's a North Korean remote drone.\n\n1288\n01:07:58,765 --> 01:08:01,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All of the sudden,\n\n1289\n01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:03,635\nMike starts doing a dance.\n\n1290\n01:08:03,635 --> 01:08:09,350\n>> [LAUGH] But what we're gonna\ndo is was looking at this,\n\n1291\n01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:14,830\nor we're looking at this thing here and\nwhat do we wanna do?\n\n1292\n01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:19,510\nWe're taking notes and\nat the same time what we should be doing\n\n1293\n01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:23,430\nis when we're gonna take\nsome more pictures here.\n\n1294\n01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:24,980\nWe're taking stuff off, and\n\n1295\n01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:30,180\nanything significant, you should\nhave a scale as part of your ruler,\n\n1296\n01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:35,050\nas part of your evidence kit, or\npart of your examination kit.\n\n1297\n01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:38,990\nSo if I need to take a picture of\nsomething to get an idea of scale,\n\n1298\n01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,970\nI can go ahead and lay that there.\n\n1299\n01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:47,460\nWhen Mike was taking pictures earlier\nI can go ahead and say, okay well,\n\n1300\n01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:51,950\nI would check to make sure I've got\nthe right scale up and I'd lay it up here.\n\n1301\n01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:54,970\nAnd he could take a picture of that so\nif this went to court,\n\n1302\n01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:57,870\nthey'd have an idea of relative\npositioning and all that on there.\n\n1303\n01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:01,580\nYou know, so that would not be a bad idea.\n\n1304\n01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:04,910\nYou know, it should absolutely be part,\na part of stuff.\n\n1305\n01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:09,170\nLittle objects like, you know, we were\nshowing the overhead shot of these little\n\n1306\n01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:12,190\nitems that were sitting\nhere on the table top.\n\n1307\n01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,230\nWe shared that again,\nthe documentation by the way,\n\n1308\n01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:17,900\nyou just gotta have something to\nnote it there and say okay, I'll lay\n\n1309\n01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:22,150\nthis right here in our shop, we should\nsay, okay, well the sunlight position.\n\n1310\n01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:26,540\nBut then we can also put labels,\nposted notes, whatever on there.\n\n1311\n01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:28,900\n>> But not all of you need to\ndocument the evidence itself,\n\n1312\n01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:33,150\nlike that cap but where that cap\nwas in relation to everything else\n\n1313\n01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:36,430\ncould make a difference and we need to\nmake sure we understand that as well.\n\n1314\n01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:39,680\n>> Yeah it could,\ncuz then they as where'd you find it?\n\n1315\n01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,150\nWhat size was that?\n\n1316\n01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:45,260\nJust things to actually know and\n\n1317\n01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:48,770\ngive an idea and who knows,\nyou may need to explain that to a jury.\n\n1318\n01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:52,560\nThey need it explained to a jury and\nyou need to kind of, we could say, we know\n\n1319\n01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,780\nwhat a cap for a USB drive is or something\nbut that's, what if its someone who's\n\n1320\n01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:01,550\nnot in IT or is elderly or something that\nmay not use these things all the time.\n\n1321\n01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,120\nWhat are they gonna think?\n\n1322\n01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,930\nThey don't know,\nthey haven't seen that but\n\n1323\n01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:08,930\nthey can visualize the size and\npositioning stuff like that.\n\n1324\n01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:11,730\nSo that's what the purpose of that is for.\n\n1325\n01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:19,270\nSo, what we're gonna do is,\nwe've gotta move to like I said we're\n\n1326\n01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:24,250\ndoing a collection, I'm gonna look here\nat the back of this machine here so\n\n1327\n01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,980\nthat's where we've gotta start.\n\n1328\n01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:30,870\nSo you know, we were saying you know, you\nknow Mike about all the cables out here\n\n1329\n01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:35,150\nyou know we see the back of the system you\nknow what else are we seeing back there?\n\n1330\n01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:37,530\nYou know we can what else\ndo we see that's open?\n\n1331\n01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,550\n>> Let's see.\n\n1332\n01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:43,510\nI've got some ports that are being used.\n\n1333\n01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:45,220\nWhat else?\n\n1334\n01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:46,910\nCase has got thumb screws on it.\n\n1335\n01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:49,750\nWe could probably get\nthose out pretty easily.\n\n1336\n01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:54,725\nI'm ready to dive in, but\nI know we're not ready for that yet.\n\n1337\n01:10:54,725 --> 01:10:57,090\n[LAUGHTER] And\na good question there from Brian.\n\n1338\n01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:00,620\nThe computer is not on, so the current\nstate we talked about If it's off,\n\n1339\n01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:03,200\nleave it off if it's on, leave it on.\n\n1340\n01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,700\nCurrent state is off.\n\n1341\n01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:05,330\nRight.\n>> There you go.\n\n1342\n01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:06,300\n>> So we can tell that.\n\n1343\n01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,660\nI can see that it's not on.\n\n1344\n01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,940\nI can see that the power supply's\nnot kicking in, fan's not on,\n\n1345\n01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,150\nthings like that.\n\n1346\n01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:16,088\nSo really, I wanna start maybe\npulling some of these cables out.\n\n1347\n01:11:16,088 --> 01:11:19,070\nBut I wanna make sure I know where\nthey were, what they were, and\n\n1348\n01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:19,760\nall that good stuff.\n\n1349\n01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,000\n>> There you go.\n>> Cause I don't want\n\n1350\n01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,270\nto just pull them out.\n\n1351\n01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:24,360\nBecause then I'm not gonna remember\nwhere the heck they were and\n\n1352\n01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,140\nI won't be able to prove\nto anybody where they were.\n\n1353\n01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:31,440\n>> There you go, you need to be able to\nknow what the state of that case was and\n\n1354\n01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,270\nbe able to re-crate it.\n\n1355\n01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:36,020\nNow, granted if you yanked them out and\nmade that mistake,\n\n1356\n01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:41,700\nthen you if you've got the pictures, you\ncould put them back in the right spot, but\n\n1357\n01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:45,010\nthen someone's going to ask, how do I know\nthat cable is the one that's in there.\n\n1358\n01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:47,650\nThey will do that in the court,\ngoing yeah, well,\n\n1359\n01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:49,880\nhow do I know it was that network cable?\n\n1360\n01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,050\nOh, well, because I said so.\n\n1361\n01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:52,700\nAren't there other\nnetwork cables like that?\n\n1362\n01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,090\nIs that the only one in the world?\n\n1363\n01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:58,994\nAnd you just wanna get up and\nchoke him, but don't do it, so\n\n1364\n01:11:58,994 --> 01:12:04,905\nyou have to do that and Bryan by the way,\nthat's a very good to bring up.\n\n1365\n01:12:04,905 --> 01:12:09,888\nLike I said, I wasn't gonna do too much,\nI'm going to do lead here, but\n\n1366\n01:12:09,888 --> 01:12:12,115\nnot gonna give you everything.\n\n1367\n01:12:12,115 --> 01:12:15,354\nThat's the type of thinking you gotta\nhave, was it on or not, didn't say.\n\n1368\n01:12:15,354 --> 01:12:17,080\nSo, good call.\n\n1369\n01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:21,350\nSo, the labels in here,\nwe've gotta do labeling, okay?\n\n1370\n01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:24,680\nSo, let's just go ahead,\nyou can pick a color if you want.\n\n1371\n01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:28,992\n>> Oh, let's go with gray [LAUGH]\n[CROSSTALK] I'm gonna be writing this\n\n1372\n01:12:28,992 --> 01:12:30,080\nstuff down.\n\n1373\n01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,500\n>> Yeah, and I'll go ahead and\nstick with black, what the heck?\n\n1374\n01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,490\nAnd this isn't the only thing you can use.\n\n1375\n01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:38,890\nWere going to use masking tape for this.\n\n1376\n01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:44,950\nSo just plain old simple masking tape\nworks great, but you can use other things.\n\n1377\n01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:48,180\nBen here's saying label makers.\n\n1378\n01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,660\nYou can get fancy if you want.\n\n1379\n01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,510\nIt's all up to you.\n\n1380\n01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:57,210\nJust as long as you capture\nthe positioning of where things were.\n\n1381\n01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:02,040\nBut let's go ahead and start talking\nabout how the labeling process works.\n\n1382\n01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,750\nAnd Mike, you can start\nlabeling stuff while I'm doing-\n\n1383\n01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,570\n>> As soon as I get my tape open.\n\n1384\n01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:12,835\n>> I'll let you label while I'm talking\nabout this since you're, you know.\n\n1385\n01:13:12,835 --> 01:13:14,440\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm doing the probie job,\n\n1386\n01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,048\nI'm fighting the freaking' roll of tape.\n\n1387\n01:13:16,048 --> 01:13:21,490\n[LAUGH]\n>> What you have here,\n\n1388\n01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:24,780\nis okay, so\nwe've got the power cable up here.\n\n1389\n01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,390\nLet's just use that as our example.\n\n1390\n01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:30,370\nWhen we pull this power cable out,\n\n1391\n01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:34,310\nwhat we would do is we would,\nbefore we pull it out,\n\n1392\n01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:40,870\nput a label around the base of this cable\nand to note this is the computer side, and\n\n1393\n01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:46,780\nthen we'd put some distinctive marking or\nlabeling on it.\n\n1394\n01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:50,710\nIn this case, we'd say,\nwe'll just say, this is A, and\n\n1395\n01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:55,980\nthen we'd put a piece on the back of the\ncase right next to this port, and say, or\n\n1396\n01:13:55,980 --> 01:14:02,120\nput something over the port that says\nthat's port A, so we know that cable\n\n1397\n01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:07,410\nA goes into port A, and we could basically\nrinse and repeat for those things.\n\n1398\n01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:13,070\nNow, It may look like, well,\nwhy even bother labeling that?\n\n1399\n01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:16,280\nWell, it's power cables, so what?\n\n1400\n01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:16,980\nWell, we don't know.\n\n1401\n01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,810\nWe're just doing by the numbers.\n\n1402\n01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,100\nPower cable's universal and\n\n1403\n01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:27,220\nis it probably gonna be a part of\nthe actual evidence that buries this guy.\n\n1404\n01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,840\nProbably not, but whatever.\n\n1405\n01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,150\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nlabel it anyway, cuz we wanna make sure,\n\n1406\n01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:34,930\nwe wanna show that we're being thorough,\ntoo.\n\n1407\n01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:35,870\nThat's something else.\n\n1408\n01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:40,170\nIf you have every little thing documented,\nand you're very meticulous with it.\n\n1409\n01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:44,220\nIt also goes a long way towards people\nquestioning you, cuz they're like hey,\n\n1410\n01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,390\nthis guy's pretty meticulous.\n\n1411\n01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:50,560\nEvery time we've challenge him,\nit's been documented, so you know,\n\n1412\n01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,920\nI'm gonna really kinda pick and\nchoose what I wanna do.\n\n1413\n01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,560\nIt happens.\n\n1414\n01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,480\nOkay, so you know,\nyou can see we have A on here,\n\n1415\n01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,920\nand we've got A over to the side in here.\n\n1416\n01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,270\nThis would actually be\ncompletely fine to do this way.\n\n1417\n01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:10,430\nYou could also, after you've labeled the A\non the cable, you could pull this out, and\n\n1418\n01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:13,900\nyou could actually put that label right\non top of that port if you wanted.\n\n1419\n01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,340\nIt works.\n\n1420\n01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,220\nBen brings up a good point here,\nwouldn't you initial all the labels?\n\n1421\n01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:23,190\nYeah, that would be part of the labelling,\n\n1422\n01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:26,860\nI said some distinctive stuff in there,\nyeah.\n\n1423\n01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:31,730\nI didn't mention that but yes,\nthat would be part of it, is that yes,\n\n1424\n01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:35,970\nyou would go ahead and\nlabel who did it or put it in your report.\n\n1425\n01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:43,140\nI would say, for example, I said, well,\nhere now Mike's labeling all the stuff.\n\n1426\n01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:48,100\nIf he is labeling it and pulling the\ncables out and bagging it as Brian says,\n\n1427\n01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,860\nwhich we would be doing.\n\n1428\n01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,990\nYou know we would be going through and\ntaking this stuff, and\n\n1429\n01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:56,010\nwe do have bags back here that we would\ngo through and toss these things in.\n\n1430\n01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:59,130\nAnd they would all travel together;\nthey would all stay together until\n\n1431\n01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:02,120\nthey are returned to the person.\n\n1432\n01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,090\nOr if that's the objective.\n\n1433\n01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:07,800\nSo we have that laying out here,\nand we put that in an actual bag.\n\n1434\n01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:15,120\nNow, where the starts can\nget kind of tricky is\n\n1435\n01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:20,590\nwe can have, we've got a USB cable there.\n\n1436\n01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:24,840\nYou've got another USB\ncable underneath it.\n\n1437\n01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,895\nIt looks like we've got\nthree USB cables there.\n\n1438\n01:16:26,895 --> 01:16:31,520\nOkay, so we've got three USB\ncables sitting out there.\n\n1439\n01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,140\nYou'd want to, this can be kind of tricky\nsince they're so close proximity to one\n\n1440\n01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:39,790\nanother, but make sure that you've got\nsomething that shows how they're laid out,\n\n1441\n01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:42,640\nyou could actually put a piece\nof tape on the side or\n\n1442\n01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,070\nsomething like that to kind of say,\nokay, draw,\n\n1443\n01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:51,330\nin this case it looks like we got\na four by four or two by two thing.\n\n1444\n01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:54,090\nJust kinda draw across on there and show,\n\n1445\n01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:59,140\nhey, this is the side of the case and this\nside of the case, and this is A, B, C, D.\n\n1446\n01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:02,060\nSomething like that,\njust to show where those are and\n\n1447\n01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:07,000\nthen you would label\nthe cables accordingly.\n\n1448\n01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,410\nIf the cables can go in\nmore than one direction,\n\n1449\n01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:15,700\nthen what you want to do is make\nsure they know what side is what.\n\n1450\n01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,450\nIn this case,\n\n1451\n01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:23,550\nwe've got one of these USB devices is\na mouse so we don't have that problem.\n\n1452\n01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:27,010\nThe other one we've got is a keyboard.\n\n1453\n01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:32,470\nAnd then we have something that's\ngot that similar USB cable and\n\n1454\n01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:35,030\nit does have a different\nconnector on the other end of it.\n\n1455\n01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:38,000\nBut there's nothing out\nhere connected to it.\n\n1456\n01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,390\nAnd Mike was pointing that out.\n\n1457\n01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:40,230\nThere's nothing there.\n\n1458\n01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:45,920\nSo that's something we\nwould putting there.\n\n1459\n01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,430\nWe could actually put some label on the\nend of this cable saying that nothing's\n\n1460\n01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:53,580\nhere, if there's a cable that something\nwas at the end of it like if this was\n\n1461\n01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:58,750\na printer, which we look at this and\nI think my\n\n1462\n01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:03,530\nsuspicion is that this is a printer\n>> That's a printer cable\n\n1463\n01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:06,510\n>> Yeah, I don't have anything here to\n\n1464\n01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:11,960\nindicate it, you know I never\nsaid there was a printer here.\n\n1465\n01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,360\nI said there was a monitor into that\ncable just to make sure we knew,\n\n1466\n01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,380\nbut I don't have a printer here.\n\n1467\n01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:22,350\nI don't have anything plugged into this,\n\n1468\n01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:26,420\nI don't see anything obviously in this\nperson's office that's plugged to this, so\n\n1469\n01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,110\nlabel it as such, and then we will tag it,\nand bag it, and get it out of here.\n\n1470\n01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:37,050\n>> I don't know if there's a technique\nto working with tape in gloves?\n\n1471\n01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:37,680\n>> It's not easy.\n\n1472\n01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,322\nWhy do you think I had you do it?\n\n1473\n01:18:39,322 --> 01:18:42,157\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now I see why the probie's doing\n\n1474\n01:18:42,157 --> 01:18:42,865\nthis stuff.\n\n1475\n01:18:42,865 --> 01:18:43,586\nGood golly.\n\n1476\n01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:44,440\n>> If you can-\n>>

01:18:50,570\nJust for the show because I know\nyou guys are getting tired of\n\n1480\n01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:53,960\nthe popping noises that\nI keep making here.\n\n1481\n01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,670\n>> Yeah.\nIf you wanna take the gloves off,\n\n1482\n01:18:55,670 --> 01:19:00,490\nI think you guys kind got the point that\nslow's posted on, so we're good with that.\n\n1483\n01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:04,380\n>> All right, so I've made a little, I\ndon't know if they can see this out there.\n\n1484\n01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:10,030\nAnd made a little,\na little diagram of basically the ports.\n\n1485\n01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:12,010\nAnd I put the B, C, and D.\n\n1486\n01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:15,030\nAnd then I labeled each cable B, C, and D.\n\n1487\n01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:18,690\nAnd so now,\nI'm assuming I can pull these cables out?\n\n1488\n01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:20,800\n>> You can pull them, but the question is,\nwhere would you put the label?\n\n1489\n01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,590\n>> I'm gonna label it right\non top of the ports there.\n\n1490\n01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:24,140\n>> Perfect.\n\n1491\n01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:27,370\n>> Otherwise, I would wanna mark\nmaybe a direction like top and\n\n1492\n01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:29,070\nleft or something like that.\n\n1493\n01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:33,480\n>> Something, you could even say, put\na little fan in there to represent where\n\n1494\n01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:38,900\nthis is, something to let them know\nthat this is how it's oriented.\n\n1495\n01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,270\n>> All right, so we can pull that out.\n\n1496\n01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:43,720\n>> And so you've got all that.\n\n1497\n01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:48,110\nOne thing you'll let me add in here is\nthat we said we have four USB ports.\n\n1498\n01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:52,400\nAnd you have one and you labelled\nit as A up here in the upper right.\n\n1499\n01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,040\nSo it's A and then B and then C.\n\n1500\n01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,070\n>> Well I did B because\nA was our power cable.\n\n1501\n01:19:57,070 --> 01:20:00,743\n>> Okay so cool, you've got BC, so\n\n1502\n01:20:00,743 --> 01:20:03,684\nyou've got BC or-\n>> Is it B, C, and D and\n\n1503\n01:20:03,684 --> 01:20:04,813\nthere's left open blank.\n\n1504\n01:20:04,813 --> 01:20:05,777\n>> Okay.\nThere you go.\n\n1505\n01:20:05,777 --> 01:20:07,018\n>> So that's a probie mistake isn't it?\n\n1506\n01:20:07,018 --> 01:20:12,858\n>> No, it's I know what you're going for.\n\n1507\n01:20:12,858 --> 01:20:14,194\nWe know what you're going for.\n\n1508\n01:20:14,194 --> 01:20:22,050\nBut, again, you need to be thorough to\nmake sure that everything is clear.\n\n1509\n01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:29,180\nSo you have to put something there\nthat say, hey, there's nothing there.\n\n1510\n01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:31,870\n>> So we should assign\na letter to that empty port,\n\n1511\n01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:35,540\nthen in our notes that\nhey port E is empty.\n\n1512\n01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:36,920\n>> You could do it that way.\n\n1513\n01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,640\nThat actually is entirely\nacceptable to use.\n\n1514\n01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:44,380\nSometimes some people just use the\ninitials EMT or M and then T for empty.\n\n1515\n01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:49,780\nYou got to keep it short just something\n\n1516\n01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:53,720\nto let people know that, yeah, I didn't\nmiss anything, there is nothing there.\n\n1517\n01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:57,520\n>> Somebody could be wondering what\nwas in that port at some point, then.\n\n1518\n01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,174\n>> They could very well remember,\nin a court setting,\n\n1519\n01:21:01,174 --> 01:21:04,172\nthey could say well heck, what happened?\n\n1520\n01:21:04,172 --> 01:21:05,739\nWhat'd you miss here?\n\n1521\n01:21:05,739 --> 01:21:07,020\nWell, there's nothing there.\n\n1522\n01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,490\nAre you sure?\n\n1523\n01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:12,850\nYou don't have any documentation\nthat says otherwise, so\n\n1524\n01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:15,583\nit seems like over documenting.\n\n1525\n01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:16,450\nIt's not.\n\n1526\n01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:19,200\nAs James says, don't leave room for error.\n\n1527\n01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:23,610\nIt's better to over document.\n\n1528\n01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:25,680\nSo just we're looking through.\n\n1529\n01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:31,730\nWe've got our network cable in there,\nso we've got that plugged in,\n\n1530\n01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:38,910\nwe've got our monitor cable,\nwe've got another video output here.\n\n1531\n01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:44,740\nSo, we've got a bunch of other\nports sitting out there.\n\n1532\n01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:47,300\nSo, once we're doing these,\n\n1533\n01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:51,710\nwe can just pull these things out\noff to the side and we're good.\n\n1534\n01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:56,061\nWe're good,\nwe can just put the rest [CROSSTALK]\n\n1535\n01:21:56,061 --> 01:21:58,102\n>> They get the idea, right?\n\n1536\n01:21:58,102 --> 01:21:58,706\n>> Yeah.\n\n1537\n01:21:58,706 --> 01:22:04,060\nYou can kinda see what we're going\nthrough here, so, all right.\n\n1538\n01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:07,090\n>> Well, I'll tell you what,\nlet's get all this bagged here.\n\n1539\n01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:10,610\nSo we've got our cables all tagged and\nbagged.\n\n1540\n01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:13,190\nOur keyboard will not fit in\nmy bag unfortunately, but\n\n1541\n01:22:13,190 --> 01:22:15,610\nwe're gonna pretend it'll\nfit in that bag there.\n\n1542\n01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:16,480\n>> Yep.\nLet me add,\n\n1543\n01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,690\nby the way really quickly,\njust in case there's some tie you\n\n1544\n01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:24,890\nshould always have anti-static\nin your in your kit.\n\n1545\n01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:28,250\nIf you may, you may pull something off a\nkit that's exotic equipment or something.\n\n1546\n01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:31,620\nThis is where your IT knowledge and\ncomputer and hardware knowledge comes in.\n\n1547\n01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:36,650\nYou don't want to go, for example,\nyou know, you've got this card sitting out\n\n1548\n01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:39,595\nhere, I don't wanna go through and\njust pick this up,\n\n1549\n01:22:39,595 --> 01:22:43,940\nthrow it in an bag, and if something\nhappens ESD wise or something.\n\n1550\n01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:47,265\nAnd it gets tested by someone else in the\nother side, cuz there may be a forensic\n\n1551\n01:22:47,265 --> 01:22:50,480\nexaminer on the other side looking\nat your results and your findings.\n\n1552\n01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,930\nYou blew this thing out with ESD damage.\n\n1553\n01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:56,030\nThat looks really bad and-\n>> [LAUGHS]\n\n1554\n01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:58,590\n>> It could be a hole in your case.\n\n1555\n01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:01,510\nSo Benos,\ndid you also bag that cable over here?\n\n1556\n01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:02,610\n>> Which one?\nThe printer cable?\n\n1557\n01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:03,750\nOr-\n>> Well any of em.\n\n1558\n01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:04,930\n>> Yep.\n\n1559\n01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,740\n>> Okay so we got stuff in here.\n\n1560\n01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:11,250\nWe just keep it easy we\nstuck everything in one bag.\n\n1561\n01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:15,320\nTypically what you would do is\nyou'd have an item per bag.\n\n1562\n01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,530\nBut what we would do,\nand we won't do it, but\n\n1563\n01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:22,750\njust to kind of give you an idea to\ncomplete the collection process here.\n\n1564\n01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,650\nWhat we do is we go ahead,\nziplock bag, seal it up and\n\n1565\n01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:29,580\nnow what you do is you put tape or\nsomething over it to close it.\n\n1566\n01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:34,020\nSo I put take a piece of masking tape or\nduct tape or whatever and, you know,\n\n1567\n01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:35,356\nclose this.\n\n1568\n01:23:35,356 --> 01:23:41,650\nAnd since Mike was the person that did\nthe collection of this he would put you\n\n1569\n01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:46,590\nknow maybe a letter of what's supposed to\nbe in the bag, put the standard annotation\n\n1570\n01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:51,700\non it and then put his initials,\ndate and time would be part of that\n\n1571\n01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:56,820\nstandard labeling as we talked in that\ncollected the chain of custody letter.\n\n1572\n01:23:56,820 --> 01:24:03,810\nStuff we just stick that on here, and\nthen, once that's done, hey, we're good.\n\n1573\n01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:08,130\nBy the way, it doesn't have to\nbe a zip lock bag like this.\n\n1574\n01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:12,957\nThis is commonly done but\nit can also be, there's also\n\n1575\n01:24:12,957 --> 01:24:18,720\nanti-tamper bags that are used\nthat are a little more fancy.\n\n1576\n01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,200\nAnd then, some guys, when you're\ngoing to pull out a hard drive,\n\n1577\n01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,580\nsome guys will actually get\nthose little Rubbermaid\n\n1578\n01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:30,080\ncontainers and they'll take the hard\ndrive out and throw it in there.\n\n1579\n01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:37,330\nAnd just put the tape around it somehow,\nand just initial it, and there it goes.\n\n1580\n01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:38,370\nIt's done.\n\n1581\n01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:43,570\nSo, again, as long as you maintain that,\nin this case, Mike collected it,\n\n1582\n01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:46,140\nstuck it in the back, and\nI can prove that it hasn't been\n\n1583\n01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,820\nopened by having that seal on it,\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1584\n01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:49,670\n>> You're good.\n\n1585\n01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:52,960\nIf that can be called into question,\nthen that's where your problems start.\n\n1586\n01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:55,190\n>> All right.\nVery good.\n\n1587\n01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:59,200\nWell, I'll tell you what Sean,\nthis looks like we're got all of our\n\n1588\n01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,710\nexternal stuff bagged and tagged and\nready to be shipped back to our lab.\n\n1589\n01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:06,630\nProbably a good point for\nus to go ahead and take a break.\n\n1590\n01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:09,010\nAnd when we come back we'll continue on.\n\n1591\n01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:12,370\nWe'll crack this thing open and\ncontinue gathering our evidence so\n\n1592\n01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:16,798\nstay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1593\n01:25:16,798 --> 01:25:22,923\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1594\n01:25:22,923 --> 01:25:26,040\nSo, we've got a lot of the scene.\n\n1595\n01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,450\nWe started off by securing the scene,\nright?\n\n1596\n01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:31,750\nWe took our pictures and\nwe documented everything.\n\n1597\n01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:36,230\nAnd then we bagged and tagged a lot of\nthe evidence and we found on the outside,\n\n1598\n01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:41,250\nthe cables, and we made sure that we\nmarked all of our ports on the computer.\n\n1599\n01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:45,000\nIncluding we labeled the cables we\nunplugged from the different ports.\n\n1600\n01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,570\nWe also made sure we marked the empty\nports so that we could, in the future,\n\n1601\n01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:50,550\nrealize that no,\nthere was nothing plugged into there.\n\n1602\n01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:53,710\nA couple more things we want to\ndo to the computer, right Sean?\n\n1603\n01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:56,770\nDeal with the front of it,\nand then the inside.\n\n1604\n01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:59,710\n>> Yes,\nthere's still a little bit of ways.\n\n1605\n01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:02,200\nA few more things to do,\nat least in our scenario here,\n\n1606\n01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,850\nthere's a few more things want to do.\n\n1607\n01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:08,300\nSo we can go ahead and\nturn the thing around.\n\n1608\n01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:10,088\nFor here we can get away with doing this.\n\n1609\n01:26:10,088 --> 01:26:13,150\nWe're fine, but\n\n1610\n01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:18,710\nif we look at the system here on\nthe front, we'd have stuff happening here.\n\n1611\n01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:22,450\nWhat we wanna do, ideally, is we\ndon't wanna forget any of this stuff,\n\n1612\n01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:26,500\nthe state it was in, so, yes, clearly\nthere should be a picture taken of this,\n\n1613\n01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:31,040\nbut we should also tape over\n\n1614\n01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:35,920\nthe different openings on here,\nin this case the doors.\n\n1615\n01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,200\nYou might even, are these,\ndo all these doors open, or-\n\n1616\n01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,860\n>> Yeah, some of them do or something.\n\n1617\n01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:43,860\nI can't remember this computer.\n\n1618\n01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:44,970\nMaybe not.\nMaybe just this one.\n\n1619\n01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:48,410\n>> Yeah.\n\n1620\n01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:49,440\nSo, old school game.\n\n1621\n01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,737\nIt's got Quake one on it.\n\n1622\n01:26:51,737 --> 01:26:52,895\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1623\n01:26:52,895 --> 01:26:55,615\n>> But what we would want to do is we'd\n\n1624\n01:26:55,615 --> 01:26:56,645\nwanna tape these things up.\n\n1625\n01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:59,615\nBut these one's don't open,\nwe'll just say they don't open.\n\n1626\n01:26:59,615 --> 01:27:04,570\nWe would tape them appropriately and say,\nthese don't open or anything like that.\n\n1627\n01:27:04,570 --> 01:27:10,040\nYou know we might even, you could do this\nas well, you don't have to in this case.\n\n1628\n01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:14,518\nSince there is a hatch there, you could\nput the state of this in here, and\n\n1629\n01:27:14,518 --> 01:27:19,130\nput that there was no media or\nanything in it and just keep this closed.\n\n1630\n01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:20,090\nAnything else.\n\n1631\n01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:22,730\nYou need to label appropriately.\n\n1632\n01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:26,640\nIf there was like a USB port up here or\nanything, you'd wanna go ahead and\n\n1633\n01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,640\ncheck those things out and\nget those labeled.\n\n1634\n01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:33,500\nAnd then, we've got the outside\npretty much taken care of.\n\n1635\n01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:37,760\n>> Yeah, especially now days, you get\nthose little tiny micro USB things they\n\n1636\n01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:42,000\ncould slip in there, and you might miss\nit if you do a nice inspection on there.\n\n1637\n01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,400\n>> Yeah, and this is exactly where that,\nsomething like that.\n\n1638\n01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,640\nThat's not something that the average\nperson is really gonna think about.\n\n1639\n01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,980\nThis is where,\ngoing back again to that theme,\n\n1640\n01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:57,750\nyou have to have really good experience\nin hardware and software to do that and\n\n1641\n01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:00,920\nhave you understand that these\nlittle things like that can happen.\n\n1642\n01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:04,496\nI can't help but think of those\nlittle Dells that used to have them,\n\n1643\n01:28:04,496 --> 01:28:06,130\nwhoever designed that-\n>> Yeah,\n\n1644\n01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:07,602\nI wanna punch that guy in the nose.\n\n1645\n01:28:07,602 --> 01:28:08,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean I dealt\n\n1646\n01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:09,147\nwith so many of those that.\n\n1647\n01:28:09,147 --> 01:28:09,739\n>> Oh look, a Dell.\n\n1648\n01:28:09,739 --> 01:28:13,302\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, or that Port was in.\n\n1649\n01:28:13,302 --> 01:28:15,284\nIt was up at an angle from the bottom, so\n\n1650\n01:28:15,284 --> 01:28:18,300\nyou actually had to tilt your\ncomputer forward basically.\n\n1651\n01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,675\n>> That was a mess.\n>> To get a good shot at that.\n\n1652\n01:28:19,675 --> 01:28:22,356\nAnd if your thumb drive was too long,\nyou'd snap it off in there.\n\n1653\n01:28:22,356 --> 01:28:25,609\n>> It was a poor design,\nbut was the route there so\n\n1654\n01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:29,042\nit's something that you\nmight not see at first.\n\n1655\n01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:29,786\n>> You need to check.\n\n1656\n01:28:29,786 --> 01:28:32,723\n>> Yeah, they could definitely hide\none of those small ones in there.\n\n1657\n01:28:32,723 --> 01:28:33,628\n>> Devil's in the details.\n\n1658\n01:28:33,628 --> 01:28:34,278\n>> Yep.\n\n1659\n01:28:34,278 --> 01:28:36,949\nAnd then inside the case,\nSean, we need to worry about.\n\n1660\n01:28:36,949 --> 01:28:40,804\nDo we just leave everything in here, or\ndo you normally take some of this out?\n\n1661\n01:28:40,804 --> 01:28:43,273\n>> If you're going to take\nthe whole unit with you,\n\n1662\n01:28:43,273 --> 01:28:47,386\nyou probably could just wrap a piece of\ntape or something around it, and seal it.\n\n1663\n01:28:47,386 --> 01:28:49,811\nIf you're gonna do that here,\nwe actually do have some stuff.\n\n1664\n01:28:49,811 --> 01:28:53,277\nI'm gonna show you guys\nsomething once we've clear\n\n1665\n01:28:53,277 --> 01:28:55,885\nsome of the mess out here off the table.\n\n1666\n01:28:55,885 --> 01:29:01,161\nYou might be able to actually image drive\non scene if you're doing a covert or\n\n1667\n01:29:01,161 --> 01:29:02,405\nblack bag thing.\n\n1668\n01:29:02,405 --> 01:29:05,321\nYou might actually be imaging\nthe system right there.\n\n1669\n01:29:05,321 --> 01:29:11,200\nAnd if that's the case,\nyou would just pull, open up the system.\n\n1670\n01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,348\nAnd when you open up the system.\n\n1671\n01:29:14,348 --> 01:29:19,305\nAnd we're not going to do the same level\nof stuff necessarily here that we did\n\n1672\n01:29:19,305 --> 01:29:20,397\non the outside.\n\n1673\n01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:25,515\nWe're not going to pull every cable out of\nthere, that's just completely unnecessary.\n\n1674\n01:29:25,515 --> 01:29:26,887\nYou'll cause yourself more work.\n\n1675\n01:29:26,887 --> 01:29:31,409\nBut, what you would do in here is\nwhen you look inside this thing,\n\n1676\n01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:33,724\nyou want to first take a picture.\n\n1677\n01:29:33,724 --> 01:29:37,197\nMake sure you see which slots are open,\nand\n\n1678\n01:29:37,197 --> 01:29:41,260\nhow much memory is in there,\nall that good stuff.\n\n1679\n01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:46,830\nIf you can, take a picture from this\nangle, see what's sitting in here.\n\n1680\n01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:48,450\nSo get that all noted.\n\n1681\n01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:53,415\nAnd then, if you are going to\nremove the hard drive out of\n\n1682\n01:29:53,415 --> 01:29:56,912\nthe system, you would pull the cable.\n\n1683\n01:29:56,912 --> 01:30:01,243\nAgain, a plus type stuff that\nyou may have done already.\n\n1684\n01:30:01,243 --> 01:30:02,682\nHopefully, you have.\n\n1685\n01:30:02,682 --> 01:30:03,796\n>> Labelling when it's appropriate.\n\n1686\n01:30:03,796 --> 01:30:06,722\nJust like we did on the outside,\nwe label either another cable.\n\n1687\n01:30:06,722 --> 01:30:08,255\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or little stickers, or what have you.\n\n1688\n01:30:08,255 --> 01:30:09,358\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1689\n01:30:09,358 --> 01:30:15,314\nAnd then, your bags, your Rubbermaid\ncases, whatever you want to do.\n\n1690\n01:30:15,314 --> 01:30:20,061\nPut them in there, and tape them shut.\n\n1691\n01:30:20,061 --> 01:30:26,401\nMake your note on your logs, and\nyou should be good at that point.\n\n1692\n01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:29,272\nIf you're not taking the whole system,\nyou may just take the hard drive.\n\n1693\n01:30:29,272 --> 01:30:31,537\nThat does happen,\nwhere they'll rip out the hard drive.\n\n1694\n01:30:31,537 --> 01:30:33,150\nBut again, it's kind of funny.\n\n1695\n01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:36,770\nI saw on the groups people mentioning\nbefore lunch, MFM drives and\n\n1696\n01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:37,748\nstuff like that.\n\n1697\n01:30:37,748 --> 01:30:42,392\nAnd after I was done with the flashbacks,\nI was thinking.\n\n1698\n01:30:42,392 --> 01:30:45,561\nWhen you look in this,\nsome of these technologies,\n\n1699\n01:30:45,561 --> 01:30:50,682\nif you haven't seen them in a while, you\nmight actually forget what they look like.\n\n1700\n01:30:50,682 --> 01:30:51,378\n>> Right.\n\n1701\n01:30:51,378 --> 01:30:55,755\n>> So one of the things is\nidentify what that technology is.\n\n1702\n01:30:55,755 --> 01:30:59,388\nYou're gonna take that hard drive,\nidentify what technology's in use there.\n\n1703\n01:30:59,388 --> 01:31:03,626\nBecause now, you have to make sure\nthat you have that back at your lab.\n\n1704\n01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:07,591\nIf you don't have an MFN connection and\nthat needs to be done right away,\n\n1705\n01:31:07,591 --> 01:31:09,026\nthis whole thumbs going.\n\n1706\n01:31:09,026 --> 01:31:10,766\nI am taking it, it's mine now.\n\n1707\n01:31:10,766 --> 01:31:14,360\nThose type of things.\n\n1708\n01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:18,817\nIf this was a server, and\nthis had a RAID configuration in it.\n\n1709\n01:31:18,817 --> 01:31:20,974\nI'm probably taking it with me,\n\n1710\n01:31:20,974 --> 01:31:23,594\nbecause I just-\n>> Too hard to duplicate that exact same\n\n1711\n01:31:23,594 --> 01:31:24,842\nenvironment back in the lab.\n\n1712\n01:31:24,842 --> 01:31:27,591\nAnd you've got access to it right here,\nso you might as,\n\n1713\n01:31:27,591 --> 01:31:29,325\njust take the whole thing as a unit.\n\n1714\n01:31:29,325 --> 01:31:30,984\nAnd then, analyze it back at the lab.\n\n1715\n01:31:30,984 --> 01:31:35,080\n>> Yeah, if you've got the bucks to do\nsomething like that, then by all means.\n\n1716\n01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,395\nf you've got the bucks back at the,\nyou can get the stuff [INAUDIBLE]\n\n1717\n01:31:38,395 --> 01:31:39,870\n>> If we're at the naval base and\n\n1718\n01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:43,419\nwe have full access to your lab,\nwe would have had no problems.\n\n1719\n01:31:43,419 --> 01:31:44,397\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1720\n01:31:44,397 --> 01:31:45,239\n>> But since we're here,\n\n1721\n01:31:45,239 --> 01:31:46,381\nwe better take the whole thing.\n\n1722\n01:31:46,381 --> 01:31:52,453\n>> Yeah, so make the judgement\nthere on what you've got in there.\n\n1723\n01:31:52,453 --> 01:31:55,848\nUse your knowledge and see well,\ndo I need to take more,\n\n1724\n01:31:55,848 --> 01:31:58,140\nor do even take the whole computer?\n\n1725\n01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:01,643\nLike I said, you may not have that luxury\nof just taking that hard drive out.\n\n1726\n01:32:01,643 --> 01:32:06,425\nSo be prepared, I guess,\nis what we're getting at.\n\n1727\n01:32:06,425 --> 01:32:09,143\nBut yeah, you may be able\nto just image this on site.\n\n1728\n01:32:09,143 --> 01:32:10,976\nIf you can do that, hey, that's great.\n\n1729\n01:32:10,976 --> 01:32:13,984\nGo ahead, and image it right on site.\n\n1730\n01:32:13,984 --> 01:32:18,720\nJust FYI, if you're gonna image something\nlike this, one of the things you\n\n1731\n01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:22,505\nwanna do is remember,\nyou do have evidence sitting in here.\n\n1732\n01:32:22,505 --> 01:32:24,084\nAnd something we're gonna talk about.\n\n1733\n01:32:24,084 --> 01:32:25,384\nAnd we'll just bring it up now.\n\n1734\n01:32:25,384 --> 01:32:29,045\nIf you have a system here and\nyou're going to rip this out,\n\n1735\n01:32:29,045 --> 01:32:31,979\nand do an image right there,\nwrite blockers.\n\n1736\n01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:35,136\nThere is a device called a write\nblocker that you can pop in there.\n\n1737\n01:32:35,136 --> 01:32:39,083\nAnd it will be between the interface and\nthe actual hard drive, and\n\n1738\n01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:41,636\nit will prevent writes going to the drive.\n\n1739\n01:32:41,636 --> 01:32:43,993\nIf you wanna call it that,\nit intercepts all those.\n\n1740\n01:32:43,993 --> 01:32:49,270\nSo the drive immediately becomes\na hardware enabled read only device.\n\n1741\n01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:49,770\n>> Right.\n\n1742\n01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:52,830\nI know that we're gonna talk about\nthat later in a future episode.\n\n1743\n01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:56,278\nBut even when your market is read only\non some of your operating systems,\n\n1744\n01:32:56,278 --> 01:32:59,170\nthey can still end up changing some\nof the metadata and things like that.\n\n1745\n01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:02,214\nThose files just by reading it or\nlooking at it.\n\n1746\n01:33:02,214 --> 01:33:03,724\nSo you gotta be real careful with that.\n\n1747\n01:33:03,724 --> 01:33:04,338\n>> Yeah.\n\n1748\n01:33:04,338 --> 01:33:08,855\nBe aware of all these little details.\n\n1749\n01:33:08,855 --> 01:33:11,036\nSo something else.\n\n1750\n01:33:11,036 --> 01:33:15,078\nLet me point out,\nis if you're gonna be doing imaging and\n\n1751\n01:33:15,078 --> 01:33:17,870\ndoing things on the system, be aware.\n\n1752\n01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:20,831\nI did see it.\nYou guys are on your game when you plug\n\n1753\n01:33:20,831 --> 01:33:25,410\nstuff into it, if there were\nUSB ports in the front of this.\n\n1754\n01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:28,900\nIf you plug something into a USB port,\nwell anywhere on here, you plug a USB\n\n1755\n01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:33,530\ncord in, they're gonna intend to dump\nan image to that or boot off of that.\n\n1756\n01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:34,151\nBe prepared.\n\n1757\n01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:36,115\nSome of those things,\nespecially if you have Windows running.\n\n1758\n01:33:36,115 --> 01:33:41,199\nIf this computer was on,\nwhen we encountered it.\n\n1759\n01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:45,507\nAnd we want to dump stuff out of memory,\ndo a live memory acquisition,\n\n1760\n01:33:45,507 --> 01:33:47,851\nwhich you definitely will have to do.\n\n1761\n01:33:47,851 --> 01:33:50,908\nThat plugging something into\nthe a windows box, USB,\n\n1762\n01:33:50,908 --> 01:33:52,910\nwill do something to the registry.\n\n1763\n01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:57,048\nIt will actually leave what they call\na shell bag n the registry with a whole\n\n1764\n01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:59,533\nbunch of setting identifying that device.\n\n1765\n01:33:59,533 --> 01:34:04,014\nAnd so, you've just tainted evidence,\nand you may not have thought about that.\n\n1766\n01:34:04,014 --> 01:34:06,533\nMost people don't when you plug\na USB device in that, it does that.\n\n1767\n01:34:06,533 --> 01:34:08,164\n>> Right.\n\n1768\n01:34:08,164 --> 01:34:11,294\n>> Yeah, the whole auto adding\nthe drivers, recognizing the devices,\n\n1769\n01:34:11,294 --> 01:34:14,488\nassigning it a letter, adding it to\nyour file system, stuff lke that.\n\n1770\n01:34:14,488 --> 01:34:16,148\nWhich now, you've changed it.\n\n1771\n01:34:16,148 --> 01:34:18,608\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1772\n01:34:18,608 --> 01:34:21,302\nAnd also, by the way,\nthat's also worth mentioning.\n\n1773\n01:34:21,302 --> 01:34:23,705\nNotice what I put out there\nto get you guys thinking.\n\n1774\n01:34:23,705 --> 01:34:27,559\nI had a little orange cap\non our scene here earlier.\n\n1775\n01:34:27,559 --> 01:34:29,128\nAnd I was pointing it out.\n\n1776\n01:34:29,128 --> 01:34:33,283\nAnd then,\nI also have this YubiKey up here.\n\n1777\n01:34:33,283 --> 01:34:35,108\n>> This one's kind of a give away.\n\n1778\n01:34:35,108 --> 01:34:39,460\nThere's something sitting there,\nand you were identified as a U key.\n\n1779\n01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:42,280\nWell, okay, fine it's sitting there,\nyou know I can see it,\n\n1780\n01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,900\nmaybe it was used on the system.\n\n1781\n01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:47,110\nChances are, it probably was\nif it was sitting right here.\n\n1782\n01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:52,456\nSo I may very well make a note of that,\nand take it with me just in case.\n\n1783\n01:34:52,456 --> 01:34:57,217\nOr it's still going to be secured,\nI may just leave it where it is.\n\n1784\n01:34:57,217 --> 01:34:58,599\nIt all really depends.\n\n1785\n01:34:58,599 --> 01:35:02,036\nSo, but if that orange cap was there.\n\n1786\n01:35:02,036 --> 01:35:07,303\nMaybe when this dude went on his vacation,\nthat's where he kept the secret documents,\n\n1787\n01:35:07,303 --> 01:35:11,160\nor whatever he was taking and\nselling, or something like that.\n\n1788\n01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:15,392\nWell, if that was there, that's something\nthat hey, maybe I wanna examine\n\n1789\n01:35:15,392 --> 01:35:19,036\nthe registry more closely to see\nwhat USB devices are in there, and\n\n1790\n01:35:19,036 --> 01:35:20,620\nsee if I can find those ones.\n\n1791\n01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:24,420\nAnd the one that's missing may\nvery well be what the evidence is.\n\n1792\n01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:25,889\n>> Right, get a list of which\nones were plugged in, or\n\n1793\n01:35:25,889 --> 01:35:27,300\nthe last one that was plugged in,\nor something.\n\n1794\n01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:28,541\nAnd you definitely don't\nwant that to be yours.\n\n1795\n01:35:28,541 --> 01:35:29,515\nThe one you plugged in.\n\n1796\n01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:30,981\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1797\n01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:34,336\nthe devices now have device IDs in them.\n\n1798\n01:35:34,336 --> 01:35:34,893\nIt's a mess.\n\n1799\n01:35:34,893 --> 01:35:39,857\nEven though you can distinguish\nif it's yours or theirs,\n\n1800\n01:35:39,857 --> 01:35:44,530\nit doesn't look nice and\npolish, so be aware of that.\n\n1801\n01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:45,663\n>> Yep.\nAbsolutely\n\n1802\n01:35:45,663 --> 01:35:46,740\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1803\n01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:47,308\n>> All right.\n\n1804\n01:35:47,308 --> 01:35:49,788\nSo now, we've done our job at the scene.\n\n1805\n01:35:49,788 --> 01:35:52,740\nDo we got anything else to do at\nthe scene itself, and we've bagged and\n\n1806\n01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:53,530\ntagged everything.\n\n1807\n01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:55,140\nWe've documented everything.\n\n1808\n01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:57,465\nSo now, do we throw it all in the car and\nwe head back to the lab?\n\n1809\n01:35:57,465 --> 01:35:57,993\n>> Yeah.\n\n1810\n01:35:57,993 --> 01:36:00,925\n>> At that point, if we're not doing\nany further analysis at the scene.\n\n1811\n01:36:00,925 --> 01:36:02,960\n>> Bagged and tagged,\nI just wanted to say it one more time.\n\n1812\n01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:03,560\nI just like that.\n\n1813\n01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,683\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sounds so cool.\n\n1814\n01:36:05,683 --> 01:36:08,144\nI need my sunglasses when I say that.\n\n1815\n01:36:08,144 --> 01:36:09,631\nTag it.\nBag it.\n\n1816\n01:36:09,631 --> 01:36:10,200\n>> Right?\n\n1817\n01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,800\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> All right.\n\n1818\n01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,371\nSo, now what do we do?\n\n1819\n01:36:14,371 --> 01:36:17,071\n>> Once we've get it all back to our lab.\n\n1820\n01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:23,071\n>> Once you get this system or the drive,\nback to when and we said in our scenario.\n\n1821\n01:36:23,071 --> 01:36:27,472\nThis system's gonna go back to our lab,\nyou know the next thing just figure out,\n\n1822\n01:36:27,472 --> 01:36:30,320\nhow you're gonna acquire that information.\n\n1823\n01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:30,820\nImaging.\n\n1824\n01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,020\nMemory analysis.\n\n1825\n01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,350\nThe system, like I said,\ncould have been on.\n\n1826\n01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:38,400\nIt wasn't, but\nwe didn't say it was in the scenario.\n\n1827\n01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:42,770\nBut if it was on, and we took the thing\nin one of those special crates over and\n\n1828\n01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:47,440\nall that, now it becomes time to\nstart extracting that information.\n\n1829\n01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,870\nRemember, order of volatility.\n\n1830\n01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:50,530\nYou've got a drive in here.\n\n1831\n01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:51,780\nBut you've got the system running.\n\n1832\n01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:52,790\nYou took it to the lab.\n\n1833\n01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:54,630\nWell, you'd better get\nthat stuff off of there.\n\n1834\n01:36:55,630 --> 01:37:00,730\nIt's also worth mentioning,\nyou know when we're doing this,\n\n1835\n01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:04,400\nsomething that you wanna keep in\nmind that's gonna come into play,\n\n1836\n01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:08,980\nis the crime scene just this computer,\nor does it actually extend outside that?\n\n1837\n01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,240\nWe didn't really address that.\n\n1838\n01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,325\nWe said, yeah,\nthere's a network cable in there but\n\n1839\n01:37:13,325 --> 01:37:15,530\nwe didn't really bring it into play.\n\n1840\n01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:20,710\nSo if you have, if it was determined that\nthe stuff was going over the network, and\n\n1841\n01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:26,120\nthis guy was doing something, accessing it\nfrom a database or something someplace,\n\n1842\n01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:30,998\nthen in that case, you're gonna want to\nsee if you need to get images of that,\n\n1843\n01:37:30,998 --> 01:37:35,202\nor anything in logs or anything like that,\nthat might be of worth,\n\n1844\n01:37:35,202 --> 01:37:38,230\nwhich they would be in and\nproving your case.\n\n1845\n01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:41,600\n>> Now would we,\nif we weren't sure on something like that,\n\n1846\n01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,890\nwould we secure the scene do what we did,\ntake it all back, analyze it.\n\n1847\n01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:48,480\nBut the scene itself remains secured,\nso that if we decide, oh you know\n\n1848\n01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:51,520\nwe need to go back and analyze the network\na little better or something like that.\n\n1849\n01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,160\nWe go back and do that?\n\n1850\n01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,170\n>> You might very well.\n\n1851\n01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:57,020\nIt depends on the situation, but\nyou might very well say, well yeah,\n\n1852\n01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:00,640\nI need to keep this secured for\nsuch and such period of time.\n\n1853\n01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:04,385\nYou can't keep it secured indefinitely\nof course, but you can say okay,\n\n1854\n01:38:04,385 --> 01:38:08,796\nI need to secure this for\nthe next 24, 48 hours or whatever.\n\n1855\n01:38:08,796 --> 01:38:11,650\nThey might,\nthey know actually have someone\n\n1856\n01:38:11,650 --> 01:38:16,460\nposted there to make sure that that\nroom isn't messed with or anything.\n\n1857\n01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:19,060\nThey might put a special lock\non the door to lock it down.\n\n1858\n01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:21,680\nThere's a number of techniques,\nbut they could actually do that.\n\n1859\n01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:24,830\nTypically you try to get it,\n\n1860\n01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:29,900\nyou take a longer time on seeing to\nmake sure you got everything you need.\n\n1861\n01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:32,927\nSo, if you do have network\nhardware then you try to get that.\n\n1862\n01:38:32,927 --> 01:38:35,030\n[CROSSTALK] Might as well, yeah.\n\n1863\n01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:38,558\n>> Before anything else gets tainted or\ncorrupted by something accidentally or\n\n1864\n01:38:38,558 --> 01:38:39,270\nmaliciously.\n\n1865\n01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:43,432\n>> Yeah or at least to, you know,\ntry to get as many logs,\n\n1866\n01:38:43,432 --> 01:38:46,700\nsomething like off the network as you can.\n\n1867\n01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,222\nYou may not able to,\nif the network is involved,\n\n1868\n01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:49,611\nyou may not be able to\nshut down the network.\n\n1869\n01:38:49,611 --> 01:38:51,792\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\nI can't take the network with me,\n\n1870\n01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:52,429\nreally so.\n\n1871\n01:38:52,429 --> 01:38:53,654\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1872\n01:38:53,654 --> 01:38:54,404\n>> Alright, so good.\n\n1873\n01:38:54,404 --> 01:38:57,536\nNow, we've got it all back at the system,\nwe're gonna start analyzing our data,\n\n1874\n01:38:57,536 --> 01:39:00,714\nall of the stuff that we've gathered, and\nI know we're gonna do some other episodes\n\n1875\n01:39:00,714 --> 01:39:03,664\nwhere we take a look at, maybe how we pull\nsome of that data off the hard drive and\n\n1876\n01:39:03,664 --> 01:39:05,450\nthings like that, so don't, don't panic.\n\n1877\n01:39:05,450 --> 01:39:06,750\nWe are gonna get back into that.\n\n1878\n01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,830\nBut we gotta,\nkeep going through objectives here.\n\n1879\n01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:10,880\nAnd so, we get it back there.\n\n1880\n01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,340\nWe gotta analyze the data, and there's all\nkinds of places we need to look, right?\n\n1881\n01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:16,496\n>> Yeah, when you're analyzing data,\n\n1882\n01:39:16,496 --> 01:39:21,010\nthere's like I said,\nthere's a lot of stuff to go through.\n\n1883\n01:39:21,010 --> 01:39:25,121\nAnd that's what's gonna be,\nwhen we move into our Lab Phase,\n\n1884\n01:39:25,121 --> 01:39:27,534\nwe haven't got to our Lab Phase yet.\n\n1885\n01:39:27,534 --> 01:39:31,477\nWe're still on scene,\nwe've got our system here and\n\n1886\n01:39:31,477 --> 01:39:37,434\nwe just haven't put it on our, through all\nwe have actually put it on our stuff and\n\n1887\n01:39:37,434 --> 01:39:39,990\nwe're carting it back to the lab.\n\n1888\n01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:43,576\nThose are the steps that are gonna start\ntaking place at the lab is the acquisition\n\n1889\n01:39:43,576 --> 01:39:44,840\nand analysis.\n\n1890\n01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:50,780\nSo we've got the stuff, it's been\naccounted for, and we take it over there.\n\n1891\n01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:53,890\nRemember, when you get the stuff to the\nlab, though, when you start going through\n\n1892\n01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:57,815\nand acquiring, analyzing and all that,\nremember when you are in between that,\n\n1893\n01:39:57,815 --> 01:40:01,495\nnot only do you have transportation,\nwhen it gets to the other side,\n\n1894\n01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:05,747\nyou're going to account for every little\nthing for the chain of Custody Law, and\n\n1895\n01:40:05,747 --> 01:40:10,547\nyou're gonna say you received it and\nthe actual.\n\n1896\n01:40:10,547 --> 01:40:14,377\nWhat evidence locker it's in and then\nyou're good about making your copies and\n\n1897\n01:40:14,377 --> 01:40:15,727\nstuff like that.\n\n1898\n01:40:15,727 --> 01:40:16,357\n>> All right, nice, nice.\n\n1899\n01:40:17,509 --> 01:40:20,307\nAll right, well, let's see,\nis there anything else we wanna\n\n1900\n01:40:20,307 --> 01:40:22,329\ndo with our machine while we\ngot this guy up here you think?\n\n1901\n01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:27,562\n>> Right now, I think, for\nall intents and purposes,\n\n1902\n01:40:27,562 --> 01:40:31,120\nthis is a simplified crime scene,\nso to speak.\n\n1903\n01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:34,128\nThe real crime scene is back,\nno, no, it's not.\n\n1904\n01:40:34,128 --> 01:40:35,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a simplified crime scene,\n\n1905\n01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:40,560\nso in this situation we'll\nsay that we're good.\n\n1906\n01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:44,530\nYeah we kind of did a very\nkind of short thing here, and\n\n1907\n01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:47,990\ndid a little kind of role playing and\nall that here, with it.\n\n1908\n01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:52,180\nBut to just kind of a show you\na little taste of what would happen.\n\n1909\n01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:54,678\nAnd so we're going to add\nsome more stuff onto it.\n\n1910\n01:40:54,678 --> 01:40:56,340\nMore stuff's gonna be, once we do this,\n\n1911\n01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:59,620\nmore bigger stuff is gonna come in,\nin the lab.\n\n1912\n01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:00,452\n>> Yeah.\n\n1913\n01:41:00,452 --> 01:41:03,520\nSo kinda gives you an idea of what you\nmight need out there in the field,\n\n1914\n01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,590\nthat you're gonna have to bring\nwith you and have at the ready.\n\n1915\n01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:10,220\nAnd getting that procedure\nkind of ingrained into your\n\n1916\n01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:13,420\nhead of what you need to do, the steps\nyou need to go through to get this done.\n\n1917\n01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:15,230\nAll right, Well, I'll tell you what.\n\n1918\n01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:16,340\nWhy don't we take a quick little break?\n\n1919\n01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:16,880\nAnd when we come back,\n\n1920\n01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,340\nwe're gonna wrap this up talking about\nhow we need to summarize all this.\n\n1921\n01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:22,030\nAnd get it ready for delivery.\n\n1922\n01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:23,080\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n1923\n01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:28,580\nWe'll be right back.\n\n1924\n01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:31,120\n[SOUND].\n\n1925\n01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:33,100\nAll right, welcome back,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n1926\n01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:36,573\nSo, continuing on our computer\ninvestigation process here,\n\n1927\n01:41:36,573 --> 01:41:39,070\nwe've kinda gone through the entire phase.\n\n1928\n01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:40,530\nRight?\nWe started with a,\n\n1929\n01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:41,660\nwe started talking about it first,\n\n1930\n01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:44,360\nwe outlined that the procedure\nthat we were gonna develop.\n\n1931\n01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:49,380\nAnd then we actually showed you guy, what\nit would be like to walk into a scene, and\n\n1932\n01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:51,440\nbag and tag the evidence the proper way.\n\n1933\n01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:55,890\nAnd I showed you a couple improper ways,\nand we got all that done.\n\n1934\n01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:57,820\nThen we've got it all back at the lab.\n\n1935\n01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,760\nWe talked about the Analysis Phase, and\n\n1936\n01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:02,270\nwe're gonna go a little bit\ndeeper into that later on.\n\n1937\n01:42:02,270 --> 01:42:04,850\nBut now to finish up the actual process,\n\n1938\n01:42:04,850 --> 01:42:09,520\nthe last phase we talked about in our\nfirst segment was, that Reporting Phase.\n\n1939\n01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:12,120\nAnd so that's where we need\nto wrap this thing up with.\n\n1940\n01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:16,030\n>> Yes, we need to talk about what\ndo you do with all this stuff?\n\n1941\n01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:20,840\nWell, ultimately yeah,\nyou are putting together a report and\n\n1942\n01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:22,810\ngetting it right to be presented.\n\n1943\n01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:28,950\nReporting is not the same as saying,\nyou are presenting that in any way,\n\n1944\n01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:31,660\nshape or form in front of a court or\nanything else like that.\n\n1945\n01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:34,950\nYou are preparing a report\non your findings.\n\n1946\n01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:37,355\nAnd be prepared for a lot of paperwork.\n\n1947\n01:42:37,355 --> 01:42:40,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's just the long and short of it.\n\n1948\n01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:43,940\nYou could invest a very,\nvery small case, you know.\n\n1949\n01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:49,300\nOne of the ones I used this morning was,\nlet's say the typical\n\n1950\n01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:54,350\nHR one where someone's violated\npolicy by they were caught\n\n1951\n01:42:54,350 --> 01:42:58,110\ndownloading a couple of pornographic\nimages or something like that.\n\n1952\n01:42:58,110 --> 01:43:01,430\nThat's something that's, you know,\nyou talk about two images.\n\n1953\n01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:02,730\nSomething that's violating policy,\n\n1954\n01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:06,710\nyou wouldn't expect that\nmuch of paper to go with it.\n\n1955\n01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:08,960\nYou could be talking something\nthat might be like 30,\n\n1956\n01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:13,310\n40 pages on that\ndocumenting your findings.\n\n1957\n01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:14,460\nIt could very well be that.\n\n1958\n01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,900\nThat doesn't even sound like\nclose to what it would be.\n\n1959\n01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:21,430\nIf I told you a couple pages,\nyou might be, that sounds about right.\n\n1960\n01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:22,720\nThere's been people I've had to take,\n\n1961\n01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,790\nthat have written reports for\nstuff like that that've been like 30,\n\n1962\n01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:29,590\n40 pages because they have to\ndocument all the stuff that we did.\n\n1963\n01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:32,472\n>> And let me guess who's\ngonna be doing that, Probie..\n\n1964\n01:43:32,472 --> 01:43:32,987\n>> Yeah.\n\n1965\n01:43:32,987 --> 01:43:34,641\nI kinda guessed.\n\n1966\n01:43:34,641 --> 01:43:38,210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm more on the supply side of\n\n1967\n01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:39,065\ncrime myself.\n\n1968\n01:43:39,065 --> 01:43:41,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I don't really do paper work.\n\n1969\n01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:41,890\n>> There you go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1970\n01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:42,730\n>> So.\n\n1971\n01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:46,270\n>> So anything, when we're talking about\nreporting, we're not talking about\n\n1972\n01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:49,940\nactually reporting to the courts or\ndelivering evidence or anything like that.\n\n1973\n01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:53,130\nWe've gotta report our findings, so\nthat people can make a decision on\n\n1974\n01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:56,200\ndo we let this employee go,\ndo we not, was he guilty, was he not?\n\n1975\n01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,660\nIf it's a criminal case\ndo we take this to court?\n\n1976\n01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:02,430\nDo we deny that kinda thing, so\nthis isn't the, the actual trial or\n\n1977\n01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:06,796\nthis isn't the final proof, burden of\nproof, but it's what we have found and\n\n1978\n01:44:06,796 --> 01:44:09,895\nthen they can use that\ninformation to make a decision.\n\n1979\n01:44:09,895 --> 01:44:10,563\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1980\n01:44:10,563 --> 01:44:11,565\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah,\n\n1981\n01:44:11,565 --> 01:44:15,972\nit's gonna be something that\nshows all your findings.\n\n1982\n01:44:15,972 --> 01:44:20,241\nBased on your research and your expert and\nyou are going to include your expert\n\n1983\n01:44:20,241 --> 01:44:24,574\nopinion on there at some point, you will\ncall it out as being your opinion too so\n\n1984\n01:44:24,574 --> 01:44:26,760\nit's not given as a statement of fact.\n\n1985\n01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:29,900\nEven though they may look at\nyou as an expert witness.\n\n1986\n01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:34,790\nAn expert on the field and say, yeah,\nyeah you're recognized as expert so\n\n1987\n01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:38,910\nwe will accept your statement,\nyour opinions as fact.\n\n1988\n01:44:38,910 --> 01:44:44,120\nBut you will clearly note what's fact,\n\n1989\n01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:48,880\nwhat your findings are, and what your\nconclusions are, basically your opinion.\n\n1990\n01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,939\nAnd so, it will also include snapshots, or\n\n1991\n01:44:52,939 --> 01:44:57,561\nmaybe gray-scale images\nof the photos you have.\n\n1992\n01:44:57,561 --> 01:45:01,980\nYou'll obviously still keep the photos you\ntook on site, preserved someplace else.\n\n1993\n01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:05,730\nThat will be locked in\na safe some place or\n\n1994\n01:45:05,730 --> 01:45:09,412\nsecurely sent to whoever\nthe client happens to be.\n\n1995\n01:45:09,412 --> 01:45:13,710\nAnd they'll look at it at that point.\n\n1996\n01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:19,730\nAnd it sounds quite simple but,\nyeah, I told you it's like 30,\n\n1997\n01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:22,270\n40 pages for something small.\n\n1998\n01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:25,390\nBut even then it sounds like,\nwell how hard can it be.\n\n1999\n01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:26,990\nI generate all this documentation.\n\n2000\n01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:30,400\nJust go through and write it so\nit sounds better and\n\n2001\n01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,530\nit's very clinical and all that.\n\n2002\n01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:35,320\nBut-\n>> It sounds tedious and time consuming.\n\n2003\n01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,280\n>> It is-\n>> It's not the most exciting phase of\n\n2004\n01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,080\nthe activity either.\n\n2005\n01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:38,610\nRight?\n\n2006\n01:45:38,610 --> 01:45:42,660\n>> Yeah, I can think of a lot better\nstuff I'd wanna do than write something\n\n2007\n01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:44,540\nlike that all by hand.\n\n2008\n01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:50,119\nFortunately software has come a long way\ntowards helping you with a lot of that,\n\n2009\n01:45:50,119 --> 01:45:53,710\nso that's the good thing but\nit can only do so much.\n\n2010\n01:45:53,710 --> 01:45:57,031\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n2011\n01:45:57,031 --> 01:46:00,372\nAll right, I know we talked about it\nearlier in our first segment of this\n\n2012\n01:46:00,372 --> 01:46:03,992\nepisode where we went through the entire\nprocess before we started the demo,\n\n2013\n01:46:03,992 --> 01:46:06,610\nbut this is the part where we\nhave to take that evidence,\n\n2014\n01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:08,470\nput it back in those evidence lockers.\n\n2015\n01:46:08,470 --> 01:46:12,350\nMake sure our chain of custody Is properly\nfilled out saying we're done with our\n\n2016\n01:46:12,350 --> 01:46:13,470\ninvestigation.\n\n2017\n01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:17,440\nWe've put it back cuz it might need to\nbe retrieved again either additional\n\n2018\n01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:21,580\ninvestigation or for presentation\nin a trial or something like that.\n\n2019\n01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:24,100\nSo we've gotta make sure\nthat's secured and put away.\n\n2020\n01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:25,210\n>> Yeah, you bring up a good point.\n\n2021\n01:46:25,210 --> 01:46:29,490\nUntil that case has reached\nits ultimate conclusion,\n\n2022\n01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:33,780\nthat evidence is gonna\nstay locked up some place.\n\n2023\n01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:38,402\nOnce the case has reached it's\nconclusion and everything's done,\n\n2024\n01:46:38,402 --> 01:46:43,590\nthen you'll be given instructions or\nwhoever's possessing the evidence.\n\n2025\n01:46:43,590 --> 01:46:47,350\nYou may be working for an organization.\n\n2026\n01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:52,490\nAnd the person that's in charge of the\nevidence room and all that may be told,\n\n2027\n01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:57,970\nhey, go ahead and destroy that or\nreturn it back to its owner or whatever.\n\n2028\n01:46:57,970 --> 01:47:01,059\nBut, yeah,\nit will absolutely stay where it is.\n\n2029\n01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:05,450\nUntil it's been told\nthat yes you can do it.\n\n2030\n01:47:05,450 --> 01:47:08,330\nDon't ever say, well they are not\ngoing to come back for it.\n\n2031\n01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:09,720\nThey will come back for it.\n\n2032\n01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,352\nProbably right after you destroy it.\n\n2033\n01:47:11,352 --> 01:47:14,440\n>> [LAUGH] Probably, man I really\nneeded and extra hard drive for\n\n2034\n01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:17,560\nmy computer at home we are not\nusing this one anymore.\n\n2035\n01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:18,739\nWhat the heck right?\n\n2036\n01:47:18,739 --> 01:47:20,020\n[LAUGH].\n\n2037\n01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:21,893\nYou try to get this big\nold suitcase out here,\n\n2038\n01:47:21,893 --> 01:47:24,800\nI'm assuming you've got something\nelse you wanna show us.\n\n2039\n01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,420\n>> Yeah.\nAs we're going through this we talked\n\n2040\n01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:30,350\nabout collecting and\nacquiring evidence and all that.\n\n2041\n01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:35,610\nWell one of the points I was bringing\nout during that was you might be able to\n\n2042\n01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:40,280\ndo that on scene if you\nhave the right equipment.\n\n2043\n01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:44,640\nAnd in the case lends, a case or\nsituation lends itself to that.\n\n2044\n01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:49,690\nNow when I was talking about\nthat I couldn't get my\n\n2045\n01:47:49,690 --> 01:47:54,680\ncase up there on the table with this but,\n>> We need a bigger area to do our\n\n2046\n01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:55,390\ndemonstrations.\n\n2047\n01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:56,873\nYeah, exactly.\n\n2048\n01:47:56,873 --> 01:47:58,150\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n2049\n01:47:58,150 --> 01:48:01,090\nthat's why we have to build four\nmore studios for our shenanigans.\n\n2050\n01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:01,925\n>> That's right.\n\n2051\n01:48:01,925 --> 01:48:03,230\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n2052\n01:48:03,230 --> 01:48:08,530\nwhat I've got here is my\ncase I've got sitting here.\n\n2053\n01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:13,948\nThis is one type of forensic kit\nyou can have made by Delta, okay.\n\n2054\n01:48:13,948 --> 01:48:19,300\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I had to carry this on\nthe plane out here from Sacramento, that's\n\n2055\n01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:24,220\nwhy it's all labeled, and got everything,\nit's passport stamped and everything.\n\n2056\n01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:26,120\nYeah, you ever wanna have fun,\n\n2057\n01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:30,695\nsay you're carrying forensic equipment\nthrough an airport and watch what they do.\n\n2058\n01:48:30,695 --> 01:48:33,210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyway, just to kind of give you\n\n2059\n01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:39,600\nthe top down view, what you're seeing in\nhere is it's a typical DO desktop case.\n\n2060\n01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:42,410\nWe got a decent amount of RAM in there.\n\n2061\n01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:44,190\nThere's a hard drive in there.\n\n2062\n01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:47,130\nWe've got our power cord and all that.\n\n2063\n01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:51,560\nWhat we also have is you'll notice we have\na bunch of ribbon cables over here for\n\n2064\n01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:54,470\ndifferent types of drives, interfaces.\n\n2065\n01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:57,600\nThis is a little bit older one, so\nit doesn't have all the newer stuff on it.\n\n2066\n01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,560\nBut it's got these things on here.\n\n2067\n01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:02,780\nAnd you can actually use it\nto start imaging and driving.\n\n2068\n01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:04,510\nPlug your write blocker in there.\n\n2069\n01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:08,550\nSlop your hard drive in there, and\ngo ahead and start imaging the system.\n\n2070\n01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:11,850\nNow, to kind of show you\nanother angle on this,\n\n2071\n01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:16,440\nto give you another idea of what's\ninside this case, if we look at it,\n\n2072\n01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:19,460\nwe can't see everything from the top down,\nso if we look at it from the front,\n\n2073\n01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:23,050\nwhat we'll see is that we\nhave an LCD screen on here.\n\n2074\n01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:24,890\nYou can, kind of, see me looking at it.\n\n2075\n01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:26,820\nAnd it also,\nit doesn't show up too well on camera.\n\n2076\n01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:30,356\nThis is actually a floppy drive,\na three and a half inch floppy drive.\n\n2077\n01:49:30,356 --> 01:49:36,752\nSo yeah, this is,\n>> Any advantage to this,\n\n2078\n01:49:36,752 --> 01:49:42,010\nover to say,\na normal notebook that I use or something?\n\n2079\n01:49:42,010 --> 01:49:46,022\nIs it running any special hardware,\nsoftware or anything like that, or\n\n2080\n01:49:46,022 --> 01:49:47,157\nis it just Windows?\n\n2081\n01:49:47,157 --> 01:49:49,014\n>> Not something like this.\n\n2082\n01:49:49,014 --> 01:49:52,026\nIt's not running that.\nThis can actually be adapted to run Linux,\n\n2083\n01:49:52,026 --> 01:49:54,350\nWindows, stuff like that if you want.\n\n2084\n01:49:54,350 --> 01:49:55,890\nNo big deal.\n\n2085\n01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:58,590\nThe advantage of this would be\nmaybe it's not practical to carry\n\n2086\n01:49:58,590 --> 01:50:00,950\nall that equipment with you, and-\n>> And it's all included.\n\n2087\n01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:02,940\nIt's got a nice case that covers it,\nprotects it,\n\n2088\n01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:04,650\neverything like that and-\n>> Yeah,\n\n2089\n01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:09,330\nthis is made definitely for field use.\n\n2090\n01:50:09,330 --> 01:50:13,850\nLet's say you're imaging, you have to\ndo an investigation on a system, and\n\n2091\n01:50:13,850 --> 01:50:18,410\nthat system is far enough away from\nyour lab where it's gonna take\n\n2092\n01:50:18,410 --> 01:50:23,120\na good amount of time to round trip it.\n\n2093\n01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:28,780\nAnd something like this is gonna\nbe helpful to have with you.\n\n2094\n01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:30,150\n>> And I'm looking at the number of ports.\n\n2095\n01:50:30,150 --> 01:50:31,310\nYou guys can't see over here.\n\n2096\n01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:33,390\nI can see all kinds of\ndifferent video ports,\n\n2097\n01:50:33,390 --> 01:50:37,695\nyou got the floppy, you've got your IDE,\nI think I see a SATA over here.\n\n2098\n01:50:37,695 --> 01:50:40,770\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So like my laptop might not have\n\n2099\n01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:45,110\nall those ports, so that means bringing\nother bags of external floppy drives,\n\n2100\n01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:46,640\nexternal DVD drives and things like that.\n\n2101\n01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,150\nAdaptors and everything.\n\n2102\n01:50:48,150 --> 01:50:51,200\nThis thing's got everything\nI need right in one case.\n\n2103\n01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,120\nThat's pretty sweet.\n\n2104\n01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:56,490\n>> Yeah, I mean it's not the easiest\nthing to lug around, but-\n\n2105\n01:50:56,490 --> 01:50:58,187\n>> It's a little hefty, but\n\n2106\n01:50:58,187 --> 01:51:00,660\nthat's what you've got probie for.\n\n2107\n01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:01,832\nNo that's me, wait.\n\n2108\n01:51:01,832 --> 01:51:04,140\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so it's a nice device.\n\n2109\n01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:10,600\nNow the thing is that you may not\nget access to something like this.\n\n2110\n01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:17,850\nThe main barrier for\nthis for people is cost.\n\n2111\n01:51:17,850 --> 01:51:22,060\nSomething like this, brand new,\nyou could be talking about $5,500 for\n\n2112\n01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:23,750\nsomething like this.\n\n2113\n01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:28,840\nFor the newer ones, I was showing\nyou one yesterday, it was 12 grand.\n\n2114\n01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:30,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> That\n\n2115\n01:51:30,610 --> 01:51:32,140\nwas a forensic,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2116\n01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:34,340\n>> A fully forensic station.\n\n2117\n01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:36,330\nIt had three 17-inch screens.\n\n2118\n01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:38,160\n>> Right.\n>> And it was designed to be portable, but\n\n2119\n01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:41,429\nit was designed to help you\ncollect all this evidence.\n\n2120\n01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:44,398\nDepends on how much I'm\nmaking doing this job.\n\n2121\n01:51:44,398 --> 01:51:46,850\nI\"m thinking motorcycle,\n\n2122\n01:51:46,850 --> 01:51:51,580\nportable forensics unit, [LAUGH]\n>> It's\n\n2123\n01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:55,510\nall perspective on this when you\nsay something like that at people,\n\n2124\n01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:59,330\njust as an aside,\nabout the dollars and cents of this.\n\n2125\n01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:00,460\nYeah.\n\n2126\n01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:02,410\nA lot of the forensic\nequipment is expensive.\n\n2127\n01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:04,520\nWrite blockers, duplicators.\n\n2128\n01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:06,627\nAll these little toys you can get.\n\n2129\n01:52:06,627 --> 01:52:10,423\nAnd there's a lot of toys you can get,\njust about anything for forensics.\n\n2130\n01:52:10,423 --> 01:52:12,988\nMuch like there is for ethical hacking.\n\n2131\n01:52:12,988 --> 01:52:15,125\nWe have all these things.\n\n2132\n01:52:15,125 --> 01:52:16,448\nI know.\n\n2133\n01:52:16,448 --> 01:52:19,575\nI remember hearing about\nthe person still does this.\n\n2134\n01:52:19,575 --> 01:52:24,653\nIt was two people that covered\nthe southern part of Nevada at one point.\n\n2135\n01:52:24,653 --> 01:52:26,730\nThey were private investigators for years.\n\n2136\n01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:28,983\nAnd then they did this as\npart of their business.\n\n2137\n01:52:28,983 --> 01:52:30,945\nThey got more and\nmore into it and got seasoned.\n\n2138\n01:52:30,945 --> 01:52:34,795\nThey'd already testified in court, so\nthey met a lot of stuff already to be\n\n2139\n01:52:34,795 --> 01:52:37,190\ntrustworthy and\nreliable and be meticulous.\n\n2140\n01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:40,003\nThey got so good at this that they\ndumped the rest of their business for\n\n2141\n01:52:40,003 --> 01:52:41,957\ndoing investigations and\njust did forensics.\n\n2142\n01:52:41,957 --> 01:52:42,572\n>> Wow.\n\n2143\n01:52:42,572 --> 01:52:47,308\n>> One of them, they're two separate\noffices run by one person at one office,\n\n2144\n01:52:47,308 --> 01:52:49,236\none person runs the other one.\n\n2145\n01:52:49,236 --> 01:52:51,522\nIndividually, they're both\nmaking seven figures.\n\n2146\n01:52:51,522 --> 01:52:53,218\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n2147\n01:52:53,218 --> 01:52:54,761\n>> A year.\n\n2148\n01:52:54,761 --> 01:52:56,736\n>> I'm with Philip now,\nforget the Widowmaker.\n\n2149\n01:52:56,736 --> 01:52:58,373\nI'm going for the forensics unit.\n\n2150\n01:52:58,373 --> 01:53:00,299\nI can buy a whole bunch of\nWidowmakers after that.\n\n2151\n01:53:00,299 --> 01:53:05,161\n[LAUGH]\n>> You can make money pretty quick with\n\n2152\n01:53:05,161 --> 01:53:06,731\nsomething like this.\n\n2153\n01:53:06,731 --> 01:53:13,441\nYou know so, but that, again,\nfirst step, getting certified of course.\n\n2154\n01:53:13,441 --> 01:53:20,094\nAnd then, you're gonna have to get used\nto working in the trenches for a bit.\n\n2155\n01:53:20,094 --> 01:53:22,938\nAnd not making that\ninitial amount of money.\n\n2156\n01:53:22,938 --> 01:53:24,157\nYou'll still do well.\n\n2157\n01:53:24,157 --> 01:53:25,898\nI will not kid yourself.\n\n2158\n01:53:25,898 --> 01:53:28,499\nThere's a demand for forensics people.\n\n2159\n01:53:28,499 --> 01:53:34,014\nA big, big demand, that is a huge hole for\nit if you look at the news.\n\n2160\n01:53:34,014 --> 01:53:39,188\nAnd, even the ones that are new to it\nare going to make a pretty good amount,\n\n2161\n01:53:39,188 --> 01:53:43,231\nbut then down the road, yeah,\nyou're making a lot more.\n\n2162\n01:53:43,231 --> 01:53:45,251\nSo, just FYI.\n\n2163\n01:53:45,251 --> 01:53:45,878\n>> All right.\n\n2164\n01:53:45,878 --> 01:53:46,818\nI like it.\nI like it.\n\n2165\n01:53:46,818 --> 01:53:47,546\nYou guys are in the right place.\n\n2166\n01:53:47,546 --> 01:53:48,742\n>> Yep.\n>> You're gonna be making some good money.\n\n2167\n01:53:48,742 --> 01:53:51,145\n>> I base my conclusions on no\nfactual evidence, whatsoever.\n\n2168\n01:53:51,145 --> 01:53:52,422\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No.\n\n2169\n01:53:52,422 --> 01:53:56,658\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well Sean, we have\npretty much covered the entire computer\n\n2170\n01:53:56,658 --> 01:53:59,864\nforensics investigation process\nin these last few segs.\n\n2171\n01:53:59,864 --> 01:54:02,000\nWhat else do we need to throw in here?\n\n2172\n01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:07,224\n>> Well, to kind of talk a couple\nof extra things about the report.\n\n2173\n01:54:07,224 --> 01:54:12,411\nI mean, I want to throw in on\nthat why we've got talking about\n\n2174\n01:54:12,411 --> 01:54:17,192\nwhat the actual report does,\nis the report has a [LAUGH],\n\n2175\n01:54:17,192 --> 01:54:21,262\nyou may be doing it\ncompletely by yourself, but\n\n2176\n01:54:21,262 --> 01:54:28,231\nyou could also be doing it with, what\nI would call, multi-disciplinary team.\n\n2177\n01:54:28,231 --> 01:54:31,542\nI eluded to that yesterday that\nyou could very well have someone,\n\n2178\n01:54:31,542 --> 01:54:35,572\nyou could be the person that's coming in\nand doing the digital side, but then,\n\n2179\n01:54:35,572 --> 01:54:38,906\nthere's going to be a legal guy\nthat could be doing stuff with it.\n\n2180\n01:54:38,906 --> 01:54:43,210\nYou could be pulling, extracting stuff\noff this notebook, and find out,\n\n2181\n01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:45,070\noh, that's financial stuff.\n\n2182\n01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:48,844\nWell, there's forensic accountants too,\nfind out where the money went.\n\n2183\n01:54:48,844 --> 01:54:52,258\nYou might be now working with\nthat person including that and\n\n2184\n01:54:52,258 --> 01:54:55,682\nconsolidating their report,\nor coordinating with them.\n\n2185\n01:54:55,682 --> 01:55:01,225\nYou may have an active crime scene where\nsomeone, they found that device on someone\n\n2186\n01:55:01,225 --> 01:55:06,629\nthat just got murdered, or there was\na terrorist attack or something like that.\n\n2187\n01:55:06,629 --> 01:55:10,270\nYou may have to put your stuff in with\nsomething like that, in which case,\n\n2188\n01:55:10,270 --> 01:55:13,797\nnow, you've really got to coordinate\nthings and sift through stuff,\n\n2189\n01:55:13,797 --> 01:55:16,185\nand be really in good\ncommunication with that.\n\n2190\n01:55:16,185 --> 01:55:18,007\nThat's the reality.\n\n2191\n01:55:18,007 --> 01:55:19,418\n>> So,\nwhen we're generating these reports,\n\n2192\n01:55:19,418 --> 01:55:21,431\nwe've really got to think about\nwho the audience is going to be.\n\n2193\n01:55:21,431 --> 01:55:24,184\nWho are we generating\nthis information for?\n\n2194\n01:55:24,184 --> 01:55:28,420\nIt could change how we lay it out,\nor what information I include.\n\n2195\n01:55:28,420 --> 01:55:30,927\n>> Yeah, always be thinking about that.\n\n2196\n01:55:30,927 --> 01:55:36,210\nThink about who you're working\nwith as well as who's reading it.\n\n2197\n01:55:36,210 --> 01:55:42,053\nYou can't present something that's overly\ntechnical and expect a CEO to get it,\n\n2198\n01:55:42,053 --> 01:55:47,402\nunless, it's a small company and\nthat CEO is very technical-oriented.\n\n2199\n01:55:47,402 --> 01:55:49,005\nBut that still gonna have a limit.\n\n2200\n01:55:49,005 --> 01:55:53,574\nIf it goes into court, you present\nsomething that's overly technical,\n\n2201\n01:55:53,574 --> 01:55:55,645\nit's just not gonna hold water.\n\n2202\n01:55:55,645 --> 01:55:58,345\nAnd I know that one is\npretty much a fact as far as\n\n2203\n01:55:58,345 --> 01:56:01,821\npresenting something that's\noverly technical in court.\n\n2204\n01:56:01,821 --> 01:56:05,722\nIt could very well turn out bad for\nyou and in a lot of cases it will.\n\n2205\n01:56:05,722 --> 01:56:10,645\nThe legal system is still learning the\ncyber stuff as much as they want to say,\n\n2206\n01:56:10,645 --> 01:56:12,559\noh yeah, we've got it down.\n\n2207\n01:56:12,559 --> 01:56:17,474\nYeah, they're writing new laws on this\nall the time, and the law lawyers\n\n2208\n01:56:17,474 --> 01:56:22,466\nthat are going to court now, the ones\nthat are redoing high profile cases,\n\n2209\n01:56:22,466 --> 01:56:25,341\nand the judges who've gone in the system.\n\n2210\n01:56:25,341 --> 01:56:28,997\nWhen they were in law school,\nthey were using pad and paper, and\n\n2211\n01:56:28,997 --> 01:56:31,785\nthey're still accustomed\nto that a lot of them.\n\n2212\n01:56:31,785 --> 01:56:36,927\nAnd so, they whatever the new stuff,\nI'm gonna retire in a few years.\n\n2213\n01:56:36,927 --> 01:56:40,490\nThey don't really care, or\nI shouldn't say don't care,\n\n2214\n01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:42,779\nI'm gonna get ticketed so bad today.\n\n2215\n01:56:42,779 --> 01:56:45,084\nSo,\n>> [LAUGH] We're looking for that Sean.\n\n2216\n01:56:45,084 --> 01:56:46,361\n[CROSSTALK] You see,\n>> Yeah\n\n2217\n01:56:46,361 --> 01:56:48,369\n>> He's driving a black Ferrari [LAUGH]\n\n2218\n01:56:48,369 --> 01:56:53,206\n>> Yeah, why don't you just give\n\n2219\n01:56:53,206 --> 01:56:56,004\nme a nice red car?\n\n2220\n01:56:56,004 --> 01:57:00,968\nThat's what's gonna happen and it very\nwell could happen if you mix up too overly\n\n2221\n01:57:00,968 --> 01:57:03,828\ntechnical, it could very well, impede you.\n\n2222\n01:57:03,828 --> 01:57:06,699\nAnd, like I said, I know for a fact,\n\n2223\n01:57:06,699 --> 01:57:12,724\nI know someone I can think of right off\nthe top of my head, that went to court and\n\n2224\n01:57:12,724 --> 01:57:17,453\nI have no doubt that they were\npretty versed in the field, but\n\n2225\n01:57:17,453 --> 01:57:22,368\nthat they did is they told both\nlawyers and the judge they said,\n\n2226\n01:57:22,368 --> 01:57:26,983\nI will explain the technical\ndetails to you if you need to.\n\n2227\n01:57:26,983 --> 01:57:31,244\nAnd both of them,\nall parties were, nah, whatever.\n\n2228\n01:57:31,244 --> 01:57:36,097\nOne of the lawyers actually wrote\nthe stuff down and screwed it all up.\n\n2229\n01:57:36,097 --> 01:57:36,827\n>> Oh, no.\n\n2230\n01:57:36,827 --> 01:57:38,941\n>> Yeah, so,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2231\n01:57:38,941 --> 01:57:40,624\n>> Be prepared for that.\n\n2232\n01:57:40,624 --> 01:57:45,386\nTry to make stuff that is factual, have\nyour evidence there in your report, but\n\n2233\n01:57:45,386 --> 01:57:48,156\nalso try to as much as\npossible to stow that down\n\n2234\n01:57:48,156 --> 01:57:51,665\ninto something that's a little\nmore easy to understand.\n\n2235\n01:57:51,665 --> 01:57:55,020\nAnd then they have the other\nstuff there as needed.\n\n2236\n01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:55,577\n>> Got you.\n\n2237\n01:57:55,577 --> 01:57:58,386\nSo, you can fill it in if they need a\nlittle lot more detail, I've got it there.\n\n2238\n01:57:58,386 --> 01:58:01,103\nBut maybe not to provide it all up front.\n\n2239\n01:58:01,103 --> 01:58:05,085\n>> Yeah, and make yourself\navailable to interpret stuff, too.\n\n2240\n01:58:05,085 --> 01:58:09,961\n>> All right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat is going to do it for our show today.\n\n2241\n01:58:09,961 --> 01:58:11,482\nWent through a lot of information there.\n\n2242\n01:58:11,482 --> 01:58:14,105\nWe did our computer forensics\ninvestigation process.\n\n2243\n01:58:14,105 --> 01:58:18,754\nWe just, basically, walked through\nthe entire phase starting with what our\n\n2244\n01:58:18,754 --> 01:58:23,619\ngoals were, different types of computer\ncrimes that we might have to deal with,\n\n2245\n01:58:23,619 --> 01:58:27,143\nand then, we moved in to making\nsure we secured the scene.\n\n2246\n01:58:27,143 --> 01:58:29,023\nAnd we, actually, did a nice little demo.\n\n2247\n01:58:29,023 --> 01:58:33,264\nWe showed you guys what it might be like,\nwalking into a place, securing the scene,\n\n2248\n01:58:33,264 --> 01:58:37,388\ncollecting that evidence, bagging and\ntagging it and getting it back to the lab,\n\n2249\n01:58:37,388 --> 01:58:39,402\nso that we can do our further analysis.\n\n2250\n01:58:39,402 --> 01:58:42,645\nI would take a look at some\nof those analytical processes\n\n2251\n01:58:42,645 --> 01:58:45,475\nhere in just a little bit,\nor in our future show.\n\n2252\n01:58:45,475 --> 01:58:49,201\nWe also talked about what we might be\ndoing once we got that evidence back.\n\n2253\n01:58:49,201 --> 01:58:53,938\nWe gotta analyze that data,

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,330\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,830\nI'm your host Mike Broderick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriano.\n\n7\n00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,800\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,090\n>> Pretty good, how are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,260\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,680\nLooking forward to\nanother exciting episode\n\n11\n00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,730\nin our digital forensic\ninvestigator series.\n\n12\n00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,210\nIn this episode in particular,\n\n13\n00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,050\nwe're going to be going over\nthe first responder procedures.\n\n14\n00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:59,040\nSo talking about what it is to be that\nfirst responder that first person to\n\n15\n00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,790\nbe at the scene of the crime or\nwherever the incident has occurred, and\n\n16\n00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,510\nwhat we need to do.\n\n17\n00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,330\nWhat we need to be aware of.\n\n18\n00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,150\nTechniques we might use,\nbeing that first on the scene,\n\n19\n00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,780\nbecause that first person is\na little bit special, right?\n\n20\n00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,770\n>> Yes!\n\n21\n00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,477\nThey do have a very special\nrole in the whole process.\n\n22\n00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,930\nIt's very important to\nunderstand who that person is,\n\n23\n00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,850\nwhat that person's expected to do,\ngive them their responsibilities.\n\n24\n00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,060\nThere are just a lot of things,\na lot of details.\n\n25\n00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,710\nKeep in mind you as\na forensic investigator\n\n26\n00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,490\nmay not be the first responder.\n\n27\n00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,440\nYou may not have that luxury.\n\n28\n00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,930\nSo it very well could be someone else I\nthink it would be important for us to kind\n\n29\n00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,880\nof really state who a first responder is\nto kinda clear up any confusion with that.\n\n30\n00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,750\nSo a first responder, by definition,\nis the first person on the scene.\n\n31\n00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,050\nI know it sounds kind of like.\n\n32\n00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,903\nBut they really are the first\nperson on the scene.\n\n33\n00:01:57,903 --> 00:01:58,533\n>> [LAUGH] Wait?\n\n34\n00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,345\nWhat?\n>> Yeah, it's like, write that down,\n\n35\n00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:01,110\nwhat did you say?\n\n36\n00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,730\nYeah.\n\n37\n00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,550\nIt is the first person on the scene, but\n\n38\n00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,620\nit's typically if\nan incident has happened and\n\n39\n00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,970\nit gets reported, this is the person\nthat does show up at that point.\n\n40\n00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,930\nAnd if that person happen to be you,\nthen you are the first responder, and\n\n41\n00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,110\nyou can determine how best\nto proceed from that point.\n\n42\n00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,630\nIf it's not you, then you have to give\nguidance to someone on how to handle that.\n\n43\n00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,940\nI mean, if you work in a company that's\nlarge enough or a situation that's large\n\n44\n00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,800\nenough, that office that has the security\nincident may be on the other side of town.\n\n45\n00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,410\nIt's gonna take you time to grab your kit.\n\n46\n00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,570\nAnd drive over there.\n\n47\n00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,520\nSo you've really gotta\ntake that into account.\n\n48\n00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,750\nSo a first responder is kinda be\nyour eyes and ears on the ground.\n\n49\n00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,551\nAnd it's gonna be the person\nthat is responsible for\n\n50\n00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:55,280\ncontrolling that scene\nuntil you get there.\n\n51\n00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,690\n>> Yeah, exactly, so\nwhether we're the first responder or not,\n\n52\n00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,530\nwe need to be aware of what\nthe expectations really are of that first\n\n53\n00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,150\nresponder and be able to potentially train\npeople to be that first responder or.\n\n54\n00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,530\nTalk somebody through being\nthat first responder.\n\n55\n00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,770\nIf it is just another\nemployee at the company, and\n\n56\n00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,700\nwe've got to be able to\ntell them what to do.\n\n57\n00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,980\nAnd what we expect of them.\n\n58\n00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,240\nSo that's why it's important for\nus to know.\n\n59\n00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,974\nNot to mention it could be on your exams\ndepending on which one you are taking.\n\n60\n00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:31,580\n>> It will definitely be in those\nsituations because the first responder\n\n61\n00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,680\nis part of your team.\n\n62\n00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,900\nI would also throw into this when\nwe talk about a first responder,\n\n63\n00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,189\ntechnically anybody that shows up\nthere first is the first responder.\n\n64\n00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,900\nSo you could beat virgin\nEric in that sense, but\n\n65\n00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,460\nthe first responder we're looking for\n\n66\n00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,430\nis someone who has a little bit of\na higher standard of familiarity with it.\n\n67\n00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,460\nThey are probably not going\nto be a laboratory staff,\n\n68\n00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,020\nthey're going to be non laboratory staff.\n\n69\n00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,240\nWith us being laboratory and them not.\n\n70\n00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,700\nSo, that's the kind of situation.\n\n71\n00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,060\nWe see them as on that side of the fence.\n\n72\n00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,050\nOne thing I like to do is when we're\ntalking about this process, one of\n\n73\n00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,750\nthe things I think is not a bad idea for\nyou to consider doing in your environment.\n\n74\n00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,770\nIs if you have people in different\nlocations that are first responders,\n\n75\n00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:22,700\nyou guys should get to know one another,\nbefore an incident happens.\n\n76\n00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,640\nYou don't want to be like,\nwho the heck is this.\n\n77\n00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,810\nYou want to have that familiarity.\n\n78\n00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,880\nYou also want to, if you can,\n\n79\n00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,360\nkind of let them in on the type of things\nthat, how your side of things work.\n\n80\n00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,720\nI mean, your the one that's\ngonna be writing procedures or\n\n81\n00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,170\nhaving input on procedures\non how they're gonna react.\n\n82\n00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,660\nYou should let them know a little\nbit more, as much as you can.\n\n83\n00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,450\nAbout why you're asking for\nthis, and what you do, so\n\n84\n00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,470\nyou can kinda get a more closer fit and\nget what you need.\n\n85\n00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,285\nIt's just the best for everybody.\n\n86\n00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n87\n00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,570\nAll right.\n\n88\n00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,110\nSo what do we do as a first responder?\n\n89\n00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,780\nWhat should we be telling\nthem to do first?\n\n90\n00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,910\nThere are a few things that hop to mind.\n\n91\n00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,200\nSecuring [INAUDIBLE] and a few of you\nin the chat room have already said,\n\n92\n00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,200\npaying attention,\nwatching our previous episodes.\n\n93\n00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,730\nThey've already started throwing\nout lots of good ideas.\n\n94\n00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,290\nLock down the area.\n\n95\n00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,990\nLock down any personnel\nthat might be in the area,\n\n96\n00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,960\nany devices that might be in the area.\n\n97\n00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,570\nMake sure that they're not removed and\nthings like that.\n\n98\n00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,050\nBut where is a good place to start?\n\n99\n00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,710\nI know you've got like electronic\nevidence in our list of\n\n100\n00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,080\nthings we need to talk about.\n\n101\n00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,670\n>> Yes, there is electronic evidence.\n\n102\n00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,350\nWe talked about some of the various forms\nof electronic evidence yesterday, and\n\n103\n00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,260\nthe way evidence works.\n\n104\n00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,170\nWe're more concerned with the physical\nstuff that's there, as well as,\n\n105\n00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,820\nwe can talk about the physical stuff,\nbut the electronic evidence as well.\n\n106\n00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,480\nPeople need to know how, or\nthe first responder need to know,\n\n107\n00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,878\nabout the nature of electronic evidence\nand things they should and shouldn't do.\n\n108\n00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:57,365\nThere been some really goofy things that\npeople have done over the years that have,\n\n109\n00:05:57,365 --> 00:06:00,265\nscrewed things up royally\nbecause they don't know\n\n110\n00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:01,835\nhow to handle electronic evidence.\n\n111\n00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:04,785\nThey might have the best\nintentions they're just there,\n\n112\n00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:08,645\non the scene, they're just not\ntrained in it they don't know.\n\n113\n00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:11,575\nSo, we have to kind of guide them.\n\n114\n00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:15,649\nAnd maybe we're a private firm like\na security firm that does this forensics.\n\n115\n00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,680\nSo if we're getting contracted\nby some business to be their\n\n116\n00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,680\nforensic investigators, they might have\nindividuals on staff at the company,\n\n117\n00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,310\nsay we need one of your employees to come\nand talk to us so we can kind of train\n\n118\n00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,560\nenough to be that first responder, or\nthat first response incident team that can\n\n119\n00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,870\nget things ready for us to get there or\nsomething like that.\n\n120\n00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,550\n>> Yeah, it's definitely not a bad idea,\nand I would always kind of,\n\n121\n00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:45,835\nto coin a phrase, have that rule of two\nat every site where you've got a primary.\n\n122\n00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:46,955\nAnd you got a secondary so\n\n123\n00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:49,675\nthere's always someone there to\ncover if there is an incident.\n\n124\n00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,625\nSo whatever happens\nyou've got that coverage.\n\n125\n00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,895\nYeah, let them know what\nthey're supposed to do,\n\n126\n00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:59,545\nand what they're not supposed to do.\n\n127\n00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,055\nIf you don't do that you're\ngoing to end up with\n\n128\n00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:06,150\nsome real kind of bad things happening.\n\n129\n00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,260\nOne that I can think of that we're\ngonna follow up on here in a bit\n\n130\n00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,200\nthat's not uncommon is if you put\na scenario out there to someone\n\n131\n00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,850\nsaying a crime was committed, and\nyou painted some scenario where they had,\n\n132\n00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,620\nthe layperson had to secure that scene.\n\n133\n00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,220\nAnd our situation, they might very\nwell secure the scene by saying okay,\n\n134\n00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,470\nI'm gonna turn off all the computers and\nshoo everyone away.\n\n135\n00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,730\nThat's what they're gonna do.\n\n136\n00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,280\nAnd the thing is that's\njust totally wrong.\n\n137\n00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,780\nI saw in our chat room, you know, put up,\nyou know, leave it how you found it or,\n\n138\n00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,750\nyou know, Deborah is in the room, nicely\nwas right on the ball there with it.\n\n139\n00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,310\nYou know, leave it how you find it.\n\n140\n00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,980\nOff, leave it off, if it's on.\n\n141\n00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,420\nLeave it on you know that's gonna be\none of the top things on our list.\n\n142\n00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,050\nYou know it's making\nthem familiar with that.\n\n143\n00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,130\nThe average person doesn't understand That\nand it's not to put anybody down here.\n\n144\n00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,590\nThey'd understand how that\nimpacts our evidence you do.\n\n145\n00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,690\nYou don't need to explain\nthe technical stuff to them.\n\n146\n00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,537\nBut you can very well say just don't\ntouch, hands off, whatever you find,\n\n147\n00:08:09,537 --> 00:08:10,615\nleave it there.\n\n148\n00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,365\nWrap a tape around it or whatever.\n\n149\n00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:14,925\nAnd call me.\n\n150\n00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:17,705\n>> Yeah, cuz they don't understand\nthe validity of some of the data.\n\n151\n00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:21,455\nOr the volatility, excuse me,\nof some of that data and things like that.\n\n152\n00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:23,855\nThey think, like I said,\nthey're doing the right thing.\n\n153\n00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:25,035\nTurn it off.\nTurn everything down.\n\n154\n00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:25,545\nShut it down.\n\n155\n00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:28,275\nThat way it'll be just like\nit was when I found it.\n\n156\n00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,355\nBut they don't realize is that they're\nchanging the state of all of that.\n\n157\n00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:32,855\nAnd that's not gonna be a good thing.\n\n158\n00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:33,445\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n159\n00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:37,638\nAll right, so the role of the first\nresponder then is really to I guess\n\n160\n00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:39,605\nprimarily to secure the scene.\n\n161\n00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:41,326\nSince they're the first ones there,\n\n162\n00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:44,130\nthey wanna make sure that\nthey're securing that area.\n\n163\n00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,570\n>> Yeah, that's really their job.\n\n164\n00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,150\nLike I was saying earlier.\n\n165\n00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,560\nThey're your eyes and ears, your boots\non the ground, to use that phrase.\n\n166\n00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,730\nThat's who they are.\n\n167\n00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,270\nAnd so, like I said, we're talking here\nabout someone that's other than us.\n\n168\n00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,090\nWe're assuming that first responder\nis another individual for\n\n169\n00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,340\nthis section we're talking about here.\n\n170\n00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,310\nIf it was you, I hope you know.\n\n171\n00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What to do in all that there.\n\n172\n00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,480\n>> Right.\n\n173\n00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,270\n>> That's why we're here.\n\n174\n00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,991\nBut if that first responder\nis acting on your behalf,\n\n175\n00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:17,480\nthey should be in contact with you.\n\n176\n00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,900\nAnd say what to do.\n\n177\n00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,820\nAnd you can tell them what to do and\nwhat not to do.\n\n178\n00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,619\nYou should be providing\nthem checklists and\n\n179\n00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:29,244\nthings like that how to properly\nsecure an area, saying secure an area.\n\n180\n00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:32,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Doesn't tell me anything.\n\n181\n00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,960\n>> It's like telling my end users, hey,\nwe need you to use a strong password.\n\n182\n00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,520\nAnd so their password is strong1, right?\n\n183\n00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,100\nAnd strong2.\n\n184\n00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,850\nSo yeah, we've gotta make sure\nwe spell it out for them.\n\n185\n00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,690\nCan't make any assumptions on\nthe knowledge that they have,\n\n186\n00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,230\nmight or might not have.\n\n187\n00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,890\n>> Yeah, you can't.\n\n188\n00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,770\nI mean, it sounds like oh,\nsecure the area.\n\n189\n00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,160\nIt sounds like people would\nknow what that means.\n\n190\n00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,860\nThey don't.\n\n191\n00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,860\nIt could mean anything.\n\n192\n00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,940\nAnd I'm not kidding.\n\n193\n00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you know I-\n\n194\n00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,431\n>> They start decking fellow employees,\n\n195\n00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:03,940\ntaking them down.\n\n196\n00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,650\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I'll tell you something funny.\n\n197\n00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:16,570\nYou can probably appreciate something like\nthis, since you've got the background too.\n\n198\n00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,858\nThey said that they had\nan incident in LA when one of the,\n\n199\n00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:26,882\nif there's anything that was a little\nfunny about when these riots happened,\n\n200\n00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:32,174\nthey had a situation where they had\na bunch of reservists backing up,\n\n201\n00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:37,820\nor national guard guys backing up\na police unit during one of the riots.\n\n202\n00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,042\nAnd apparently someone came out\nof the store with something,\n\n203\n00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,640\nand was being belligerent\nduring this thing.\n\n204\n00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,430\nAnd ran into a house.\n\n205\n00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,815\nSo the police went and chased him.\n\n206\n00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:48,395\nAnd get the guy who ran into a house.\n\n207\n00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:51,695\nAnd so they were trying to\nget the guy to come out.\n\n208\n00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:53,065\nAnd so the police were there.\n\n209\n00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:54,446\nThey're the ones that are in charge,\n\n210\n00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,355\nthe civil authorities in\ncharge of the whole thing.\n\n211\n00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,525\nThey have a squad of these guard guys.\n\n212\n00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,280\nAnd the police just assume everyone\nknows and everyone's on the same page.\n\n213\n00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,750\nThese guys, the police officers,\nsaid cover me.\n\n214\n00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,830\nAnd we're like okay.\n\n215\n00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,200\nAnd they're thinking, down there\nwith their pistols going cover me,\n\n216\n00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,810\nthey're expecting them just if\nanyone pops their heads out.\n\n217\n00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,061\nNo, these guard guys come out [SOUND] and\n\n218\n00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:20,440\nthey start spraying bullets all over\nthe house, and just going all over it.\n\n219\n00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,480\nAnd it was just, [LAUGH] that's\nwhat cover the means to them.\n\n220\n00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,353\n>> Just a complete miscommunication, the\nsame term meaning two completely different\n\n221\n00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:33,640\nthings to these two different agencies,\nand that can cause a problem.\n\n222\n00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,110\nSo the same thing can occur here.\n\n223\n00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,085\nWhen we tell them to secure the area,\n\n224\n00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:41,520\ntheir idea of securing the area might not\nbe what we think of as securing the area.\n\n225\n00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,210\nSo we gotta make sure we walk\nthem through the process.\n\n226\n00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,660\nIf they haven't been trained at all,\nthen we're on the phone with them.\n\n227\n00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,410\nAnd we're talking to them.\n\n228\n00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,770\nAnd we're walking them through and\ntelling them what to do.\n\n229\n00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,560\n>> Yeah, be available, make sure,\nI would not be adverse to,\n\n230\n00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,420\nwhen you put together a guide.\n\n231\n00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,240\nIt sounds dumb to us to do this initially.\n\n232\n00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,720\nBut when you put it in context of\nwhen you put a guide together,\n\n233\n00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,380\nput a list of terminology.\n\n234\n00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,980\nYeah, we've seen it in books and\n\n235\n00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,820\nother places where terminology are like,\nwell, duh, I know what that term means.\n\n236\n00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,580\nWho wrote this stuff?\n\n237\n00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,210\nIt's because so\nyou know what our definition is.\n\n238\n00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,710\nIf you understand what it is and it's\nthe same thing we are, hey, it's great.\n\n239\n00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,470\nIf it's not,\nit's right there in black and white.\n\n240\n00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,710\nSo you understand, in this case,\nwhat secure the area actually means.\n\n241\n00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,674\nAnd secure could mean you just,\nin this case,\n\n242\n00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:30,190\ncould mean you just seal off a cubical.\n\n243\n00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,940\nIt could mean that you push\npeople out of the area.\n\n244\n00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,190\nIt could be that you\nkeep the people nearby.\n\n245\n00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,430\nIt all depends, but\neveryone's gonna have to agree upon that.\n\n246\n00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,850\nAnd the first responders need to know.\n\n247\n00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,770\n>> Very good, very good, all right,\n\n248\n00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,690\nso what else do we wanna talk about\nour first responder procedures here?\n\n249\n00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,110\nI'll think.\n\n250\n00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,650\nLet's see,\nwe'll talk about electronic devices?\n\n251\n00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,665\n>> Yeah, that's a very big one,\nespecially nowadays.\n\n252\n00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,450\nThe electronic devices,\npeople have so many of these.\n\n253\n00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,550\nMy gut thing is to just say that,\nif there's an incident happening,\n\n254\n00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:11,770\nthey are not allowed to leave\nthe area if they're still there.\n\n255\n00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,070\nAnd they're definitely not allowed to\ngo in there and collect devices or\n\n256\n00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,730\nanything like that because all it\ntakes is them touching a keyboard or\n\n257\n00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:26,160\nsomething like that and they could start\nwiping stuff or destroying a crime scene.\n\n258\n00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,990\nOr, heck, if they're out of your sight for\nlong enough, out of that first responder's\n\n259\n00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,890\nsight for long enough,\nthere's enough of a question there.\n\n260\n00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,510\nThat person may have gone around the\ncorner and waited there for a second and\n\n261\n00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,940\ncame back.\n\n262\n00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,550\nIf they're out of your sight long enough,\nyou didn't see them.\n\n263\n00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,390\nWhat did they do?\n\n264\n00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,660\nThat could be enough for someone to\nsay hey, the person's not guilty.\n\n265\n00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,840\nSomeone else put it there.\n\n266\n00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,940\nIt's happened.\n\n267\n00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,970\n>> Or they could have thrown\nevidence away or destroyed evidence,\n\n268\n00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,020\nthrowing stuff down the bathroom.\n\n269\n00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,360\nWho knows, right?\n\n270\n00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,610\nSo the first responder then, do we want\nthem to start gathering this stuff up or\n\n271\n00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,500\nis it more about just making\nsure that nothing changes?\n\n272\n00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,628\nI mean should they take this\nguys phone from him or?\n\n273\n00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:04,950\n>> Typically you wanna say no.\n\n274\n00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,030\nBut there are always\nexceptions to a rule so\n\n275\n00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,020\nit very well could be that\nthat's what it comes down to.\n\n276\n00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,030\nThat you might have to take it.\n\n277\n00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,560\nI would tell you and\n\n278\n00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,700\nthis is what they say with search warrants\nwhen we talked more in depth about those.\n\n279\n00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,050\nWith search warrants, we've been taught,\nmostly lay person and\n\n280\n00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:28,620\na lot of the public thinks of it this way\nis that you wanna grab someone's stuff,\n\n281\n00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,130\ndo a search and seizure of it.\n\n282\n00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,340\nYou have to have that magical piece\nof paper from the judge saying\n\n283\n00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,460\nthat you've been blessed with doing that.\n\n284\n00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,180\nNo you don't need a warrant always.\n\n285\n00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,310\nThere can be exceptions to the rule.\n\n286\n00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:48,720\nTo kinda put it in context, it's like\nsaying if an officer shows up at a house,\n\n287\n00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,580\nand he knows there's someone about to be\nmurdered in there, and he's screaming and\n\n288\n00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,660\nall that, he doesn't sit there going, hey,\nI hope that judge gets the piece of paper.\n\n289\n00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,940\nNo, he's going in.\n\n290\n00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,000\nThat's the way it works.\n\n291\n00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,310\nSo, if there's an eminent\n\n292\n00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,620\nthreat there of something walking out or\nthat scene being destroyed or\n\n293\n00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,850\nsome sort of harm occurring,\nthen that's an exception to a rule.\n\n294\n00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,000\nBut they're pretty narrow\nwhen you get to that, and\n\n295\n00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,640\nyou'd better be aware of\nwhat that exception is.\n\n296\n00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,470\n>> Right, so it could extenuating\ncircumstances, or something like that.\n\n297\n00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,140\n>> Exactly.\n\n298\n00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,440\n>> That maybe give you\nthe ability to see something, or\n\n299\n00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,210\nat least stop somebody from destroying\npotential evidence, and things like that.\n\n300\n00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,397\nBut again it's one of those things where\nwe really can't give you straight-up legal\n\n301\n00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:37,070\nadvice, right?\n\n302\n00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,340\nThat's gonna vary from region to region,\ncountry to country, things like that.\n\n303\n00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,710\nSo make sure you're doing your due\ndiligence, as far as the local laws go.\n\n304\n00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,050\nAll right, so What else?\n\n305\n00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,096\nDo they, does this first responder get\nany cool tools like we do as a forensic\n\n306\n00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:53,840\ninvestigator?\n\n307\n00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,540\n>> Yeah!\nThey actually can get some of that.\n\n308\n00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,990\nIt really depends how much\nleeway you wanna give them.\n\n309\n00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,090\nSometimes you give people all those toys\nand it's just, just sit back and wait for\n\n310\n00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,012\nthe fireworks because it's gonna happen.\n\n311\n00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:08,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's just gonna be what does this do.\n\n312\n00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's just gonna be bad.\n\n313\n00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,650\nLet's talk about it.\n\n314\n00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,270\nLet's talk about what's\ngonna be in that tool kit.\n\n315\n00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,360\nThis is actually, can be a pretty big\ntopic, so let's make sure we've got that\n\n316\n00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,160\ncovered, what there gonna be in their\ntool kit if you've so empowered them.\n\n317\n00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,990\nThe toolkit, the one of the big\nthings that's going to be in there,\n\n318\n00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,570\nit's an intangible, is the training.\n\n319\n00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:35,290\nThat needs to be part of their on board,\nbuilt in toolkit.\n\n320\n00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,510\nIt needs to be in their own firmware.\n\n321\n00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,250\nSo, we've got that.\n\n322\n00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,010\nAnd if you have to take them out on\na scene with you to see the initial steps,\n\n323\n00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,220\nand you can do that.\n\n324\n00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,780\nI'm all for that.\n\n325\n00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,560\nThey can relate to it a bit better.\n\n326\n00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,130\nBut, as far as the physical type\nof toolkit, again, we're saying\n\n327\n00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,390\nthat these people are not the laboratory\nstaff and not the forensic staff.\n\n328\n00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,710\nThe things that are gonna be\nthere are limited to stuff that,\n\n329\n00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,660\nit's the things they have to do,\n\n330\n00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,080\nand stuff they have to have to complete\nthat mission that we're giving them.\n\n331\n00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,340\nAnd it's gonna be for example,\ncameras are gonna be in there.\n\n332\n00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,920\nAnd typically, it's gonna be a camera\nthat we're gonna have, if we can do it,\n\n333\n00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,300\nboth a still camera and\na video camera if we can get them both.\n\n334\n00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,360\nWe really want them both.\n\n335\n00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,820\nAnd nowadays, most cameras like\nthe DSLR's, and stuff like that.\n\n336\n00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,390\nMost of them have both functions.\n\n337\n00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:41,490\nBut you do wanna have them to\nphotographically detail the scene.\n\n338\n00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,690\n>> Right.\n>> Okay, so that would be the first thing.\n\n339\n00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,980\nMake sure they've got appropriate\nmemory cards and the like in there.\n\n340\n00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,395\nSo we have that one filed away,\nmake sure they have extra batteries too.\n\n341\n00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:55,310\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> And\n\n342\n00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,715\nmake sure that's checked\non a regular thing.\n\n343\n00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:59,720\n>> [LAUGHS] Right,\n>> How often that is-\n\n344\n00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,470\n>> Let's take\n\n345\n00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,049\na whole bunch of pictures and\nnone of them came out.\n\n346\n00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,795\n>> Yeah pictures are black.\n\n347\n00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:06,670\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> Make sure they\n\n348\n00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,020\nknow how to use the camera too.\n\n349\n00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,115\nThat sounds stupid, but trust me,\n\n350\n00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:15,700\nnowadays, unless you're someone's\nphotographer, you're taking pictures with\n\n351\n00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,300\nyour cell phone more often than\nhaving the whole click type thing.\n\n352\n00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,170\nSo you don't want someone\nleaving their lens cap on, or\n\n353\n00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,330\nnot knowing how to use it and getting\njust a bunch of weird blurry photos.\n\n354\n00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,190\nLook like an acid trip or\nsomething like that.\n\n355\n00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,809\nIt's like,\nno I need good photos all right.\n\n356\n00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,090\nSo, with that stuff.\n\n357\n00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,600\nSo, they will need a camera with\nvideo documenting abilities.\n\n358\n00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,480\nSo, we've got that.\n\n359\n00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,690\nThey will need to take pictures of\nthe scene and the areas around it,\n\n360\n00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:50,950\nkinda what we did in our scenario, but\nnot with the eye so much of taking every\n\n361\n00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,400\nlittle detail of that, of the box itself,\nbut what the state of everything is.\n\n362\n00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,650\nI wanna know what was sitting on their\ndesktop, what their desk looked like.\n\n363\n00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,130\nI wanna know if they had a backpack\nsitting over in the corner\n\n364\n00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,530\nof their cubicle.\n\n365\n00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,610\nI wanna know what was there.\n\n366\n00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,852\nI wanna know who was in the area.\n\n367\n00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:12,090\nAnd what time of day\nwhen those were taken.\n\n368\n00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,170\nI wanna see all those things.\n\n369\n00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,860\nAnd a video camera tends also to\nbe one of the better ones, too,\n\n370\n00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,896\nbecause video camera, of course,\nyou can really kind of just go around.\n\n371\n00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:23,010\n>> Pan around and see.\n\n372\n00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,980\nSo, this guy, this first responder comes\nup and really is documenting the scene\n\n373\n00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,000\nitself more so than anything that\nmight be considered evidence.\n\n374\n00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,480\nThere coming in and from that wide\nperspective, getting the entire area\n\n375\n00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,340\nthat surround that scene and\neverything that might be going on.\n\n376\n00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,220\nBecause that might turn out to be\nimportant to our evidence later on.\n\n377\n00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,820\nSo we got to get that document and\nget everything set up.\n\n378\n00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,630\nAnd as you were talking in\none of our earlier episodes.\n\n379\n00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,800\nA lot of this is leading to\nthis incredible new field of\n\n380\n00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,280\n3D recreation of these scenes, right?\n\n381\n00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,120\nPretty cool technology there.\n\n382\n00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,800\n>> Yeah, and\nthat's where that's gonna come in.\n\n383\n00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,340\nThat's also, by the way,\none of the things they'll do is, and\n\n384\n00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,660\nyou're gonna have to figure out how\nto best deal with this, is that.\n\n385\n00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,650\nThere should be in their kit,\nthere should also be a pad of paper and\n\n386\n00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,960\nstuff for them to sketch out the scene.\n\n387\n00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,670\nAnd I've been there before,\nwhere individuals say, well, I can't draw.\n\n388\n00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,800\nYou can draw a line.\n\n389\n00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,865\nOkay?\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n390\n00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:25,945\n>> Can you draw a stick figure?\n\n391\n00:20:25,945 --> 00:20:28,055\nGood, you're qualified,\nPicasso, get out there.\n\n392\n00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:29,275\nThat's what I want to see.\n\n393\n00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,005\n>> So we're not looking for\nportraits or anything like that?\n\n394\n00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,885\n>> Yeah.\nI don't want to see a big nice watercolor,\n\n395\n00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:33,665\nI'm like nice.\n\n396\n00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,165\nYeah, I don't wanna see that.\n\n397\n00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:38,650\nAll I'm looking for\nis that it was cubicle.\n\n398\n00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,830\nOkay, yeah, here's, there's the walls.\n\n399\n00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,660\nHere's the box.\n\n400\n00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,440\nHere's me.\n\n401\n00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,200\nFine.\n\n402\n00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,220\nThat's good.\nAs long as it's labeled,\n\n403\n00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,260\nyou can sign your, write something on\nthere, what everything is and all that.\n\n404\n00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,560\nI'm fine with it.\n\n405\n00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,290\nSo, you've got the photos.\n\n406\n00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,590\nYou've got where everything's laid out,\nso I can get perspective.\n\n407\n00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,360\nMark where North is, so\nthey know how to orient everything.\n\n408\n00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,420\nGet those types of details,\nthat's what I want,\n\n409\n00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,640\nI don't need artistry, but\nthat needs to be in there.\n\n410\n00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,150\n>> Yeah.\n\n411\n00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:10,050\n>> Photos and videos are not\na replacement to the sketch,\n\n412\n00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,865\nthey supplement or compliment the sketch.\n\n413\n00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:14,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n414\n00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,740\nIs there a reason for that?\n\n415\n00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,070\nIs it just that we still like\nto have those photos, or I mean,\n\n416\n00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,930\nthose actual drawings?\n\n417\n00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,790\nJust a little more detail oriented or\n\n418\n00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,840\nmore-\n>> Drawings tend to just lay stuff out.\n\n419\n00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,590\nReally nicely in black and\nwhite where things are.\n\n420\n00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,220\nIt's kind of like I did years ago,\nI worked with mechanical engineers and\n\n421\n00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,040\nstuff like that.\n\n422\n00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,260\nAnd so if you look at,\nif I showed you what a 3D rendering or\n\n423\n00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,450\na photo of an engine block,\nyou look at that and\n\n424\n00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,890\nit's like you can understand it's\nan engine block, and see it.\n\n425\n00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,710\nBut if you have a drawing that shows,\nit's a front on one, here's a side view,\n\n426\n00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,590\nand all that.\n\n427\n00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,370\nThat's going to help you re-create it.\n\n428\n00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,730\n>> Detail available and labeling things.\n\n429\n00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:03,990\n>> The photo should be something\nto make you kind of see\n\n430\n00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,020\n>> In the real world, what it looks like.\n\n431\n00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,910\nSo, it's just like the 3D\nrendering of that engine-block.\n\n432\n00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,850\nIt helps you see okay,\nthose are just a bunch of lines, but oh,\n\n433\n00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,160\nthat's how they all come together.\n\n434\n00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,060\n>> So the drawing really helps you\nfocus on what's important in a scene\n\n435\n00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,740\nand rule out.\n\n436\n00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,160\nCause you're not gonna draw every\nblade of grass and things like that.\n\n437\n00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,630\nSo you're drawing just\nthat important stuff.\n\n438\n00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,950\nThe table, the computers on the table.\n\n439\n00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,670\nThere was a picture hanging on the wall.\n\n440\n00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,450\nYou're really focusing on\nthe details we need, not so\n\n441\n00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,740\nmuch the fluff around it, I guess.\n\n442\n00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,280\n>> Yeah, I wanna see layouts and\nthings like that.\n\n443\n00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,440\nThat's what needs to be captured there.\n\n444\n00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,780\nLet all the colors and\nall that stuff show up.\n\n445\n00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,900\nLike the blades of grass or\nwhere the sun is and all that.\n\n446\n00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,300\nLet that show up in the photos and\nthe videos.\n\n447\n00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,860\nThat's what that's for.\n\n448\n00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,820\n>> Gotcha, gotcha.\n\n449\n00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,690\nWell, what's next in our first\nresponder procedure list?\n\n450\n00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,730\nWe've talked about the devices\nthat they might or might not have.\n\n451\n00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,650\nAnd they're two and a quarter [CROSSTALK]\n>> Okay, good.\n\n452\n00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,780\nSo, we got our toolkit.\n\n453\n00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,770\nSo far in our toolkit then, we've got\nour camera, hopefully camera and video,\n\n454\n00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,780\nwe've got our sketchpad,\nour pencils, extra batteries.\n\n455\n00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,990\nChargers for the phone,\ntape to secure off the scene.\n\n456\n00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,740\n>> There you go.\n\n457\n00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,230\n>> Maybe some crime scene tape or\nsomething like that.\n\n458\n00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,070\nWhat else do we need to throw in there?\n\n459\n00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,440\n>> Those are some of the big ones.\n\n460\n00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,760\nI want them to also have\na note pad to take notes.\n\n461\n00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,150\nYou know, on for anything they have,\nI want them to use that note pad.\n\n462\n00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:36,394\nTo not only tell me additional\ninformation about the scene was, but\n\n463\n00:23:36,394 --> 00:23:41,550\nI also want them to use that to get\ninformation about who was there.\n\n464\n00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,063\nYou know, who was present at that,\nwho's present at that scene,\n\n465\n00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:47,460\nwhen that happened and\nwhen they were there?\n\n466\n00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,775\nAnd, if you are so empowered,\nsomething we're going to talk about,\n\n467\n00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:56,530\nYou're going to use that same notepad\nto gather information at interviews,\n\n468\n00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,287\nbecause that very well could be something\nthat you're requested to do during\n\n469\n00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:03,210\nan initial interview with it.\n\n470\n00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,740\nIf you can't do an interview,\nor they figure,\n\n471\n00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,480\nhey you're not they type of\nperson we want doing that.\n\n472\n00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,920\nAnd it sound like interviewing,\noh that's an easy thing to do,\n\n473\n00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,900\nit's not because you could influence that\nperson, you could put stuff in their head\n\n474\n00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:22,060\nand that's now gonna say, okay,\nwell you made him think that way.\n\n475\n00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,490\nAnd there's been numerous cases of that\nin the courts over the years where under\n\n476\n00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:32,050\nquestioning, they basically\nwhen they talk or question,\n\n477\n00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,530\nthey start mentioning stuff and suggesting\nstuff that bended that person's thinking\n\n478\n00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,565\na certain way, and all of the sudden they\ncan say well, you planned it in your head.\n\n479\n00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:45,275\n>> Those leading questions to try to fish\nout the answer that I want to get, right?\n\n480\n00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:45,805\n>> Yeah.\n\n481\n00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:48,845\n>> So I can hopefully guide them\nto what I want them to say.\n\n482\n00:24:48,845 --> 00:24:50,725\nAnd I might not even do it intentionally,\n\n483\n00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:53,595\nit might end up being more\nof a subconscious thing.\n\n484\n00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:57,275\nBecause I know the answer I want and\nso the questions I'm asking\n\n485\n00:24:57,275 --> 00:25:00,695\ncould lead you that way, and I need to\nmake sure that I'm staying objective in\n\n486\n00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:04,500\nthat interview process, and\nnot leading the witness in any way.\n\n487\n00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,480\n>> They actually had a pretty famous\ncase where that happened where,\n\n488\n00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,940\nI mean I'm not gonna get into the details\nof the case, but they had a preschool\n\n489\n00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,530\ndown in Southern California that,\nwas it the Buckley's?\n\n490\n00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,150\nIt's a while back.\n\n491\n00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,960\nBut the preschool, they were\n\n492\n00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,450\nsaying that supposedly at the preschool\nthat there was child abuse there.\n\n493\n00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,330\nAnd all sorts of things happening.\n\n494\n00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,030\nAnd the preschool got closed.\n\n495\n00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,890\nAnd the people got arrested for it,\nwent through a big, long trial.\n\n496\n00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,330\nAnd it came out during the trial that,\noh there was a dungeon, the kids claiming\n\n497\n00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:47,490\nthere was a dungeon under the school, and\nthat they were getting tortured there.\n\n498\n00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,110\nAnd there was all sort of sexual\nstuff going on there, and all that.\n\n499\n00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:55,250\nThat all these things came out in there,\nand the people that owned all that stuff,\n\n500\n00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,620\nof course, is terrible if it happened.\n\n501\n00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,900\nAnd the thing is that when it went to\ncourt and all the stuff was coming out,\n\n502\n00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,520\nit was getting more sensationalized\nin the paper all the time.\n\n503\n00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,360\nAnd none of it was real,\nnone of it was true.\n\n504\n00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,860\nNot a single one of it was true.\n\n505\n00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,590\nThey've never, no one had, there was\nabsolutely zero evidence that they had\n\n506\n00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,390\never mistreated any of those kids,\nthat they'd done anything wrong.\n\n507\n00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,970\nWhat happened was that during\nthe interview process, the detectives that\n\n508\n00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,410\nwere questioning this, I forget\nwhat actually triggered the initial\n\n509\n00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,790\ninvestigation, but during the questioning\nprocess when they questioned more kids,\n\n510\n00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,370\nthey were actually talking to them in\nsuch a way that when they were saying,\n\n511\n00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,440\ndid you notice anything like a dungeon?\n\n512\n00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,760\nStuff like that.\n\n513\n00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,570\nThe kid, I mean,\nyou're not dealing with that situation,\n\n514\n00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,790\nbut a kid, it's a preschooler.\n\n515\n00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,720\nThat's the type of things they\nhave very vivid imaginations on,\n\n516\n00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,440\nyou just gotta give them a little seed,\nand\n\n517\n00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,710\nthey can just go wonderful places or\nbad places with their imagination.\n\n518\n00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,690\nAnd that's what happened.\n\n519\n00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,040\nSo the preschool did\nget permanently closed,\n\n520\n00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,050\nand they even demolished it years later.\n\n521\n00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,910\nAnd they said, yeah, the ground hasn't\neven been disturbed underneath this.\n\n522\n00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:13,810\nThey said, so there's the final, the case\nhas long since been dismissed, but\n\n523\n00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:18,500\nthat was the final nail in the coffin for\nthat one, so.\n\n524\n00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,790\n>> All right, well I'll tell you what,\nlooking at our clock, Sean, it's time for\n\n525\n00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,700\nus to step away, take a break.\n\n526\n00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,580\nSo we're gonna do that,\nand when we come back,\n\n527\n00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,110\nwe're gonna continue on with\nthe first responders, so stay tuned!\n\n528\n00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,625\nWe'll be right back.\n\n529\n00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:37,550\n[SOUND]\n>> All right,\n\n530\n00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,600\nwelcome back, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n531\n00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,930\nSo continuing on with our\nfirst responder procedures.\n\n532\n00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,540\nAnd a little more about that tool kit that\nthat first responder might have with them\n\n533\n00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,730\nto help them secure that scene and\n\n534\n00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:55,200\nstart the not really the collection\nof the evidence maybe, or do they?\n\n535\n00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,890\n>> You know, they're gonna have,\nthey could collect evidence.\n\n536\n00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,060\nThey could do some of the initial stuff.\n\n537\n00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,761\nThe thing is-\n>> Who it is, right?\n\n538\n00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:08,678\nIf it's somebody from their company\nwhile we're trying to get there, or\n\n539\n00:28:08,678 --> 00:28:10,650\nwe're the first responder, yeah.\n\n540\n00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,440\n>> Yeah, it depends on how much\nthe company wants to empower them with and\n\n541\n00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,640\nhow much the situation requires or the\nsituation you expect them to encounter,\n\n542\n00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,510\nyou know to deal with those appropriately.\n\n543\n00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:30,040\nI can conceivably give my\nfirst responders up to and\n\n544\n00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,220\nincluding everything that I have.\n\n545\n00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,980\nNow, I don't know if that's gonna\nbe a good idea in every case.\n\n546\n00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,730\nI'm gonna say.\n\n547\n00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,340\nno, it's not an every case situation.\n\n548\n00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:45,750\nIf someone's not forensically trained,\nthat's gonna be a disaster.\n\n549\n00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,670\nYou might as well go over there\nwith a gas can and a match and\n\n550\n00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,370\njust take it out because\nit's gonna be a mess.\n\n551\n00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,760\nI mean, even if they collect it correctly,\ncuz you know what's happened\n\n552\n00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,630\nif it ever goes to court,\nthat person wasn't properly trained,\n\n553\n00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,600\nand even though you can show they did it\nthe right way, they're like, well, okay.\n\n554\n00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,380\n>> Amazing.\n\n555\n00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,280\n>> Yeah.\n>> Somehow they can do it exactly right,\n\n556\n00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,700\nthey could have everything documented,\neverything,\n\n557\n00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,890\nbut because they didn't\nhave that formal training,\n\n558\n00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,455\nthey can pull in that question of doubt,\nright?\n\n559\n00:29:13,455 --> 00:29:14,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If we'd introduced\n\n560\n00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,590\na little doubt that's typically all\nwe need in our U.S. court systems.\n\n561\n00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,370\n>> Yeah.\n>> In the criminal court\n\n562\n00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,960\nsystems anyway, so.\n\n563\n00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,770\nBut they still are gonna be\nresponsible for some things, so\n\n564\n00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,150\nwe talked about their toolkit.\n\n565\n00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,410\nWe said they're gonna have the camera and\nthe video camera, crime scene, not crime\n\n566\n00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,820\nscene tape, but ways to cordon off the-\n>> You could.\n\n567\n00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,070\n>> Could be crime scene tape, right?\n\n568\n00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,090\n>> Could be whatever you feel\nis necessary to secure it.\n\n569\n00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,730\nCrime scene tape could be a part of it.\n\n570\n00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,110\n>> So taping off that area.\n\n571\n00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,560\nWe talked a little bit about\npersonnel that might be in the area,\n\n572\n00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,580\nmaking sure that they're detained or\nstay and not allowed to leave.\n\n573\n00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,750\nMaking sure that nobody else\nmesses with the evidence, right?\n\n574\n00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,370\nMaking sure that you're there\nto preserve that scene and\n\n575\n00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:56,220\nyou wanna make sure that nobody else\naccidentally or maliciously does that.\n\n576\n00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,960\n>> Yeah, you have to be prepared to\nkeep that sealed off and preserved.\n\n577\n00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,000\nAs is for someone that's\na forensic personnel to get there.\n\n578\n00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,620\nBut I think, this is a good\npoint also to mention something\n\n579\n00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:16,860\nabout first responders that\nmay not be readily obvious,\n\n580\n00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,230\nis a first responder\nmay not be one person.\n\n581\n00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:27,200\nIt may not be able to be one\nperson that responds to something.\n\n582\n00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,290\nLet's just say for kicks,\n\n583\n00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:36,390\nthis person was doing something that\nhad an incident reported against him,\n\n584\n00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:42,180\ndid something that indicated they were\naccessing different things on the network,\n\n585\n00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,660\nor doing what have you,\nlet's say it's an administrator.\n\n586\n00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,470\nIt's somebody that's doing\nadministrator reviews,\n\n587\n00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,740\nsomething we talked about earlier on.\n\n588\n00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:55,940\nWell if they're exercising that,\nthat's a much more far reaching scenario.\n\n589\n00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,050\nSo if they're doing things that\nindicates administrator reviews, yeah,\n\n590\n00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,480\nwe're going to walk then out of that area.\n\n591\n00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,380\nThat's a typical thing to do that\nwalk out with personnel like that.\n\n592\n00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,400\nAnd either hold them some place or\n\n593\n00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:16,640\njust kick them out of\nthe building until whatever.\n\n594\n00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,100\nYou know, we've got that you can do that.\n\n595\n00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,290\nNow you got that thing of first responder.\n\n596\n00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,380\nThat person that far reaching influence.\n\n597\n00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,190\nNow, what do we gotta do?\n\n598\n00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,280\nWe have to enlist other people\nhave network access and\n\n599\n00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,680\nother administrators to lock things\ndown to start containing that.\n\n600\n00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,000\n>> Or else he might have been\naccessing remote systems.\n\n601\n00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,890\nSystems somewhere else on the network,\nand things like that.\n\n602\n00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,690\nWhich is now part of my crime scene.\n\n603\n00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,290\n>> Yeah, and so\nthose people have other tool kits.\n\n604\n00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,050\nThey're not gonna need to take\nphotographs and stuff like that.\n\n605\n00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,939\nThey're your ID or your system\nadministrator, is gonna have other\n\n606\n00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:55,670\nthings that are gonna log what he\nHe is doing and preserving that.\n\n607\n00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,540\nSo, now we've got a whole\ndifferent set of tools.\n\n608\n00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,970\nAnd those ones,\nwe won't discuss those right now.\n\n609\n00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,520\nWe'll worry about the first responder\nthat's actually showing up on site.\n\n610\n00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,020\nBut, it's just kind of to let you know\nthat it's not just that person you may\n\n611\n00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,750\nneed to contain other activities and\ndo other stuff.\n\n612\n00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:20,240\nI even say one mention here,\npotential first responder.\n\n613\n00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,960\nIt brings up a specter of legal issues.\n\n614\n00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,655\nIf someone, when we were talking, we were\ndoing our crime scene reenactment here, if\n\n615\n00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:33,975\nsomeone plugged a USB device in and it's\nnot there, which indicated in our scene,\n\n616\n00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:37,765\nwe could have made that conclusion that\nthere's not something that's not here.\n\n617\n00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:41,065\nIf it's a big enough scenario, like\nsomething related to national security,\n\n618\n00:32:41,065 --> 00:32:44,085\nsomething like that,\nthey may very well say,\n\n619\n00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:48,045\nhey we want to get a search warrant for\nthis person's place because it's not here.\n\n620\n00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:50,595\nWe want to search that person's place for\nthis.\n\n621\n00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:52,540\nWe want to search the person's car.\n\n622\n00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,340\nWant to search the girlfriends house or\n\n623\n00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,000\nwhatever you can actually open it\nup pretty far in certain cases.\n\n624\n00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,920\nSo that would bring a legal\ndepartment in a zap.\n\n625\n00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:07,688\nSo there could be several\nheads in play here.\n\n626\n00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:09,940\nThe multiple point investigation,\n\n627\n00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,850\nI might need more than one first\nresponder at each location.\n\n628\n00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,470\n>> I might have more than one location\nwhere I need first responders, so,\n\n629\n00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:20,530\nnot just a single individual, but\nusually a team of people as you said,\n\n630\n00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,960\nat least two trained,\ntwo per site I think you said.\n\n631\n00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,340\nBut making sure you've got more people\navailable so that if that scene does grow,\n\n632\n00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,640\nI've got the personnel that\ncan at least secure the scene\n\n633\n00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,350\nuntil we can get there as\nthe forensic investigator.\n\n634\n00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:38,870\n>> Yeah, and if this sounds like\nit's getting a little confusing or\n\n635\n00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,930\na little bit crazy,\npossibly for maybe yourself,\n\n636\n00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,520\nmaybe even the person on site\nthat's being a first responder.\n\n637\n00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,410\nThat's why another part of their\nkit's gonna be a check list.\n\n638\n00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,400\nI don't want you making this\nstuff up as you go along.\n\n639\n00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,770\nI don't want you going, okay,\nI got my car keys and my phone.\n\n640\n00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,450\nI don't want that old thing you\ndo in the morning when you leave.\n\n641\n00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,490\n[LAUGHTER] I want that boom, boom, boom.\n\n642\n00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,600\nYeah, that's what I want to have.\n\n643\n00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,830\nPull out a laminated list and boom,\nboom, boom right on down the list.\n\n644\n00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,610\nThis is who you call.\n\n645\n00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,515\nIs this the situation?\n\n646\n00:34:08,515 --> 00:34:09,920\nBoom: Call this one.\n\n647\n00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,150\nIf you're not sure, call this person.\n\n648\n00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,710\nI want that whole thing happening.\n\n649\n00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,260\nYou know, and in play.\n\n650\n00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,100\n>> Right.\n\n651\n00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,760\nVery good, very good.\n\n652\n00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,140\nSo what are some other basics we\ncan talk about first response here?\n\n653\n00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:23,990\nI'm trying to think of.\n\n654\n00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,760\nWell, we covered.\n\n655\n00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,240\nSecuring and\nevaluating the electronic crime scene.\n\n656\n00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,420\nWe kinda covered that a little bit, but-\n>> There's a little more to\n\n657\n00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,430\nit than that, yeah.\n\n658\n00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,840\nWe've definitely got securing the scene\nthat we are gonna go through and\n\n659\n00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,040\nstart locking or locking stuff down.\n\n660\n00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,630\nBut there are other things,\n\n661\n00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:47,540\nlike we said, don't have them\ninterfere with these devices.\n\n662\n00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:55,234\nI saw people here taking equipment like\nphones I saw in there, things like that.\n\n663\n00:34:55,234 --> 00:35:00,185\nDefinitely part of the process.\n\n664\n00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:04,710\nBut making sure that\nthe basic thing they know,\n\n665\n00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,090\nlike I said, is left at how you found.\n\n666\n00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:11,596\nDon't enter the crime scene, don't\nstart playing the amateur detective, or\n\n667\n00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:12,276\nwhatever.\n\n668\n00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,343\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n669\n00:35:14,343 --> 00:35:17,073\n>> You see it, people see stuff on-\n>> It's the Hardy Boys, come on!\n\n670\n00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,492\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah!\n\n671\n00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:24,170\n[LAUGH] You know, it's kind of funny\nwhen you mention something like that,\n\n672\n00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,330\nit's kind of funny because one of\nthe problems they had for years, and\n\n673\n00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,590\nthey actually still do have it now,\nwhere people that,\n\n674\n00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:34,470\npeople that are going on juries,\nI mean how many CSI programs do we have?\n\n675\n00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,368\nThere's like, you know,\nthere's like 20 or 30.\n\n676\n00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:38,770\nThere's like CSI Idaho.\n\n677\n00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,620\nI don't know.\n\n678\n00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,580\n>> Yeah, there's four or\nfive different CSI's.\n\n679\n00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,800\nYou got three or four,\nfive different offshoots of Law & Order.\n\n680\n00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,760\nSo everybody out there is\na criminal investigator and\n\n681\n00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,330\na-\n>> Yeah.\n\n682\n00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,020\n>> What you call them?\n\n683\n00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,390\nThey have backroom detectives or whatever.\n\n684\n00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,150\n>> Yeah, you've got all these things,\nall these people out there.\n\n685\n00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,130\nYou've got people that are,\nyou know, armchair quarterbacks.\n\n686\n00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,100\n>> Yeah, that's what I was looking for.\n\n687\n00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,180\n>> You've got the same thing with, yeah,\nthat's what I thought it was, just joking.\n\n688\n00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,610\nBut you get people that are same\nthing with doing forensics.\n\n689\n00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,990\nThey actually have a term for it.\n\n690\n00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,770\nThey call it CSI, in fact.\n\n691\n00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,000\nThat's literally a term, cause you have\npeople that go on juries and are used to\n\n692\n00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,370\nwatching, especially when CSI was at its\nreal big height, when it first came on.\n\n693\n00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:28,840\nYou know, you see people that would\nwatch that and go onto a jury, and then\n\n694\n00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,370\nthey'd start saying, why aren't we seeing\nthis recreation, or why aren't we that?\n\n695\n00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:37,410\nAnd you had lawyers and forensic\npeople going cause you don't need it.\n\n696\n00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,040\nYou don't need it to prove this.\n\n697\n00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,620\nAnd they're like, well I wanna see some\nanimation in there, and it was literally\n\n698\n00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:50,070\na real thing and there were situations\nwhere they said it got substantially more\n\n699\n00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,530\ndifficult to work with the case because\npeople were expecting those things.\n\n700\n00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,030\n>> I'll be darned.\n>> They were like they do it on TV,\n\n701\n00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,260\nwhy can't you do it?\n\n702\n00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,340\nYou know, they don't understand that hey,\n\n703\n00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,125\nthere's stuff that happens\nthat we call fictional.\n\n704\n00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:04,860\n>> [LAUGH] If it's on TV,\nit's got to be true.\n\n705\n00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,590\nI can push one button on my computer, and\nall this stuff just magically happens and\n\n706\n00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:12,150\nit traces it right back to the bad guy,\nand boom, we're done.\n\n707\n00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:15,090\nAnd a couple more clicks and\nI can recreate the entire crime scene and\n\n708\n00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,560\nrotate it in three dimensions.\n\n709\n00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,185\n>> Yeah, it's just-\n>> It's just fantastic.\n\n710\n00:37:18,185 --> 00:37:21,500\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's the one I think I\n\n711\n00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,880\nrecall that they disproved it, but people\nwere asking about it for a long time.\n\n712\n00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,670\nIt was when they had this episode of\nthe X-Files where they were doing\n\n713\n00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,640\nforensics with acoustics stuff,\n\n714\n00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,720\nand they said that they could\nthat they could take a pot.\n\n715\n00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,840\nThe theory was, in the show, was that\nsomeone had been spinning this piece of\n\n716\n00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,060\npottery on a spinning wheel, and they were\nusing the straw and all that to shape it.\n\n717\n00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,030\nThat sounds in the area would\ncause the straw to vibrate and\n\n718\n00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,100\nactually do like a record.\n\n719\n00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,030\nSo they said-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n720\n00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,353\n>> If you replayed it the same way,\n\n721\n00:37:54,353 --> 00:37:57,055\nyou could hear what some were\nsaying a couple thousand years ago.\n\n722\n00:37:57,055 --> 00:38:02,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they did the show.\n\n723\n00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,740\nIt's a show about aliens, so.\n\n724\n00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,990\nThey put that in there, okay.\n\n725\n00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,940\nI can accept that and all the other stuff.\n\n726\n00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,570\nThere's a special disbelief\nthat goes with that.\n\n727\n00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,660\nThere's people that actually\nbelieve that and tried it.\n\n728\n00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,200\n>> Wow.\n>> And\n\n729\n00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,630\nthey, hey, they were like like, oh,\nwell, I could hear all this stuff.\n\n730\n00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,140\n>> Yeah.\n\n731\n00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,030\n>> That's your common sense\ntelling you you're an idiot.\n\n732\n00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,570\n>> Absolutely.\n\n733\n00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,900\nSo we gotta try to avoid that.\n\n734\n00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,120\nWe gotta make sure these people understand\nthat just because you've seen it on CSI,\n\n735\n00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,222\ndoes not mean we want you to do this.\n\n736\n00:38:30,222 --> 00:38:33,854\n[LAUGH].\n>> Yeah, they don't understand the science\n\n737\n00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:38,140\nbehind it, don't get all that,\nso but whatever.\n\n738\n00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,415\nA discussion for\nprobably another time, but\n\n739\n00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:45,605\nthat's an interesting thing that\nyou may find yourself dealing with.\n\n740\n00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:48,345\n>> Something else that they might help\nus with, when they go in and they're\n\n741\n00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:52,055\nthe first ones there, they're walking in\nto the scene, we're presumably getting\n\n742\n00:38:52,055 --> 00:38:55,680\nready to come out there, maybe packing\nup our gear, getting our team ready.\n\n743\n00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,780\nCall it in whoever talk about\nevaluating the electronic crime scene.\n\n744\n00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780\nThey might be able to tell us, hey,\n\n745\n00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,490\noh by the way, I see floppy disks laying\non there, right, or something like that.\n\n746\n00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,742\nSome kind of equipment that's kinda\nspecialized or not normal or dated,\n\n747\n00:39:08,742 --> 00:39:12,098\nthey can be the ones who give us a heads\nup when we make sure we've got the right\n\n748\n00:39:12,098 --> 00:39:13,579\nequipment when we show up, too.\n\n749\n00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:14,346\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n750\n00:39:14,346 --> 00:39:16,969\nYeah, that's a big one.\n\n751\n00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:20,338\nAs the laboratory staff,\n\n752\n00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:24,632\nyou should always be ready to go.\n\n753\n00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:28,090\nYou should have what they call your\njump kit or something like that.\n\n754\n00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,970\nThat you just, you can just grab and\n\n755\n00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,870\ngo where you have something\npacked that you can grab and go.\n\n756\n00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,530\nIt should always be ready that way.\n\n757\n00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,860\nIn fact, if you're doing things\nthe proper way, when you build that kit,\n\n758\n00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,630\nyou've got the whole kit built and\nstocked up.\n\n759\n00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,086\nOnce you're done with your\ninvestigating a case and\n\n760\n00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:49,420\nhave come back from a scene All\nthat stuff should be replenished.\n\n761\n00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,790\nAnything used should be\nreplenished right there.\n\n762\n00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,401\nYou know, for example,\nwhen we were doing our set up here,\n\n763\n00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:57,290\nwe had rubber gloves back here,\nwe opened it up and were using it.\n\n764\n00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,700\nWell, we should see,\ndo we have enough rubber gloves?\n\n765\n00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,060\nDo we need to put more in to\nreplace the ones we left?\n\n766\n00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,610\nAnd that's just a small thing.\n\n767\n00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:09,460\nOther thing you want to do is to make sure\nthings like you media using a copy if\n\n768\n00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,540\nthat's the case, that that's been you\nknow cleaned to forensic standards, yeah.\n\n769\n00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,680\n>> Batteries, fresh batteries and\nbackup in there,\n\n770\n00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,780\nyou don't wanna do it on\nyour way to the scene,\n\n771\n00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,790\nbecause that's when you're going to\nforget something, miss something.\n\n772\n00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,710\nSo, you definitely want to make sure that,\nas soon as we're done processing a scene,\n\n773\n00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,250\nthat's when we restock all that,\nall those items.\n\n774\n00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:34,700\n>> But, it very well could be that there's\nstuff that you may not typically bring,\n\n775\n00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,770\nthat, yeah, a person could be telling you,\nthis is what I have, and so\n\n776\n00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:43,516\nyou might make extra,\n\n777\n00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:47,290\nor might bring extra stuff with\nyou because it's just necessary.\n\n778\n00:40:48,895 --> 00:40:52,305\nAnd trust me, for\nevery piece of technology,\n\n779\n00:40:52,305 --> 00:40:56,525\nthere's some forensic way,\na special forensic way of dealing with it.\n\n780\n00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:57,155\nYou know?\n\n781\n00:40:57,155 --> 00:41:00,545\nI see people and\nhear about the first responders,\n\n782\n00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:04,075\none of the things you should do, seems\nlike, it reminds me of elementary school.\n\n783\n00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:06,535\nIt's been mentioned so\nmany times people are like, me, me, me!\n\n784\n00:41:06,535 --> 00:41:10,835\nI see you, calm down,\nit'll be recess in enough.\n\n785\n00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,370\nIt's what you've got is the phones,\ndo you take the phones?\n\n786\n00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,470\nYou may be allowed to.\n\n787\n00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,780\nAgain, you've got to check.\n\n788\n00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,970\nIf it's a personal device,\n\n789\n00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,270\nyou may be allowed to take\nit under certain conditions.\n\n790\n00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,030\nIt all depends.\n\n791\n00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:29,000\nI can't answer 100% accuracy for\nthat, but if it's a company one,\n\n792\n00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,980\nyou probably are very likely\nto be able to take it.\n\n793\n00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,900\nIn a lot of companies, if someone's using\nthat phone to touch the company network,\n\n794\n00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,440\nthey typically have to sign.\n\n795\n00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,980\nNowadays, they're doing\nit to cover their butts.\n\n796\n00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,900\nCompanies are making people sign stuff.\n\n797\n00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,960\nIf that's the case it may include that\nyes we can, if something happens we can\n\n798\n00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,390\ntake that phone you're consenting\nto that if that's the case,\n\n799\n00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:59,970\nthen, boom go ahead you\nknow take the device.\n\n800\n00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,300\nIf you know that's the case take\nthe device, but let me tell you something.\n\n801\n00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,520\nThat's where the first responder\nthings in the first responder kit, and\n\n802\n00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,920\nthe first responders should be aware\nof is that when you take a cell phone\n\n803\n00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,030\nyou need to throwing it in a special,\nwhat they call a Faraday bag.\n\n804\n00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,290\nThey have other names for them too.\n\n805\n00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,380\nWhat it is, it's a bag,\nthat if you know how Faraday cages work,\n\n806\n00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,260\nit seals the whole, it seals it off\nfrom electrical signals completely.\n\n807\n00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,890\nAnd so, what your,\n\n808\n00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:35,390\nwhat the idea here is that you're keeping\nanything from touching that device.\n\n809\n00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,870\nAnd it's important to realize, if you\nhaven't already, to realize what someone\n\n810\n00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:43,340\ncould do with a cell phone,\neven if they're not in possession of it.\n\n811\n00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,930\nYou know we all, a lot of people,\nnot just myself,\n\n812\n00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,370\nI have this feature on my plan too,\n\n813\n00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:54,680\nif I lose my phone I can call up really\nquickly and have it wiped anywhere it is.\n\n814\n00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,860\n>> So they order the phone,\n\n815\n00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,150\nthen you've taken it's and\nyou think you've got it all security,\n\n816\n00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,310\nhe walks around the corner calls somebody\nand says, hey I lost my phone, wipe it.\n\n817\n00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:01,870\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so\n\n818\n00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,480\nyou hand it over to your\nforensic investigator,\n\n819\n00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,480\nlook I got their phone, it's been wiped.\n\n820\n00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,662\n>> Yeah it's been lobotomized it's\na blank device so you know, there's that.\n\n821\n00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:15,840\nSo you don't want them touching\nthat device or walking with it,\n\n822\n00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,760\nyou want to make sure that they can't\ndo anything inadvertently with that.\n\n823\n00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,060\n>> And that's nothing special, right.\n\n824\n00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,190\nI mean half of us have Apple devices\nthat have that find my phone,\n\n825\n00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,170\nand I can remotely WiFI\ndevice from any PC.\n\n826\n00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,970\nAndroid I know has some very similar\napps on theirs that they can do it with,\n\n827\n00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:35,220\nso relatively, that's not even\na very difficult technique to do,\n\n828\n00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:40,300\nso, gotta make sure we're educating those\nfirst responders on things like that.\n\n829\n00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,650\n>> Yeah.\nIt's absolutely the case,\n\n830\n00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,610\nand then there is something else that\ngoes with cell phones by the way, and\n\n831\n00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:47,700\nwe are gonna talk more about those\nwhen we get into mobile forensics.\n\n832\n00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,480\nBut they're sealing in bag,\nin just sealing it in a bag and\n\n833\n00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,190\nthen there is bags that\nwhat if the forensic person\n\n834\n00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,880\nis going to be further out and you don't\nwant that thing plugged into anything.\n\n835\n00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,830\nYou don't want to plug a power cord\ninto it or touch it in any way.\n\n836\n00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,284\nSo you're putting that bag for\nthat purpose, but\n\n837\n00:44:04,284 --> 00:44:05,986\nwhat about the battery life on it?\n\n838\n00:44:05,986 --> 00:44:11,200\nWe all know how modern phones run.\n\n839\n00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,420\nBattery life can be less than Stellar.\n\n840\n00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,880\niPhone's up to a whopping half hour now.\n\n841\n00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,780\n>> Especially if you put it in a bag\nthat now it can't get any reception so\n\n842\n00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,910\nit's just sitting there,\nsearching and searching for\n\n843\n00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:28,900\nsome kind of WiFi signal\n>> Until it dies.\n\n844\n00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:34,200\nYeah, but here's the thing, those little\nFaraday bags, you see them on eBay and\n\n845\n00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,310\nstuff like that, they have ones\nthat when you slide the phone and\n\n846\n00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,260\nthey have a connector,\nit's a power connector inside of it.\n\n847\n00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,810\nYou slide it in, it either has\na battery on the outside of it or\n\n848\n00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:45,670\nit's got something that you can plug\nthe thing and then keep it charged up, and\n\n849\n00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,810\nit's still sealed in\nits own little bubble.\n\n850\n00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,640\n>> So no signal but\nstill getting power, then.\n\n851\n00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:56,460\n>> Yes, but someone has to be\naware that that is the situation.\n\n852\n00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,570\nSo there's little tricks like that too.\n\n853\n00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,000\nBut that's one of the basics.\n\n854\n00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,250\nOther basics would be when you get them,\n\n855\n00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,390\ntell them you do see\nthis as a screw up a lot.\n\n856\n00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:13,130\nPeople log in to a system\nto see what was going on.\n\n857\n00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,890\nA proper first responder should not be\ndoing that and one of the reasons is\n\n858\n00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:23,000\nperhaps, there have been people have\nbeen known to set basically a booby trap\n\n859\n00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,470\non the system that if you log into it and\nyou don't do a special key combination or\n\n860\n00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:31,290\nsomething, it executes a script and\nlobotomizes the system.\n\n861\n00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,230\nSo-\n>> Yeah, I think somebody had\n\n862\n00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:33,740\nmentioned, yeah.\n\n863\n00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,410\nAnd I've heard this, I don't know how true\nit is, but I've heard the stories about\n\n864\n00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:41,410\npeople that will build the, oh gosh,\nnow I can't think of the name of it.\n\n865\n00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,210\nThey put the cabling around their\ndoor frame so they can de-magnetize.\n\n866\n00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,920\nThey take it through, if somebody carries\nthat computer out through the doorway.\n\n867\n00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,950\nHad somebody tell me one time, now again\nthis is another one, not sure if it's\n\n868\n00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:55,150\ntrue or not, but they had it set up where\nthe power button was actually reversed.\n\n869\n00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:59,420\nWhere if you went to turn the computer on,\nyou hit the power button, but\n\n870\n00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,430\nthat wasn't the power button.\n\n871\n00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,130\nThat was a wipe button, so.\n\n872\n00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,850\nThere is things like that and wether those\nare true or not, it's more to the point\n\n873\n00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,860\nthat we just don't need to touch anything\nbecause we don't know what's going on.\n\n874\n00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,030\nWe don't know what this person has set up.\n\n875\n00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,400\nIf they were afraid they\nwere going to get caught,\n\n876\n00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,580\nthey could have done some\ncrazy things to their system.\n\n877\n00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,350\nAnd those first responders\nhave to be really careful.\n\n878\n00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,540\nHave to make sure they're trained,\nthey know what they're doing and\n\n879\n00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,990\nthey're not messing with things.\n\n880\n00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,098\nAnd as we've said a few times,\nleave it as it is.\n\n881\n00:46:26,098 --> 00:46:26,847\n>> Yeah.\n\n882\n00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:32,550\nJust absolutely do not take\nthe chance when you do these things.\n\n883\n00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,280\nDon't unplug a network cable\nunless it's absolutely necessary.\n\n884\n00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,380\nDon't touch the system.\n\n885\n00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,160\nDon't do any of those things.\n\n886\n00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,450\nThat's what the forensic\nguidance is gonna be for you.\n\n887\n00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:48,530\nRemember my friend I talked\nabout in Sacramento,\n\n888\n00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,130\nthat guy's a very experienced\nforensic technician.\n\n889\n00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:51,930\nHe's got it cold.\n\n890\n00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:57,650\nHe's considered a big expert\nin the field out there.\n\n891\n00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:05,190\nHe has to call the CHP every time\nhe has to investigate something,\n\n892\n00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:09,830\nbecause they're going to tell him\nhow he's gonna proceed, you know,\n\n893\n00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,770\nthat could also be put in there as part\nof that check list and everything.\n\n894\n00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,080\nLike I was gonna tell you, that, you know,\nit's to keep a first responder, and\n\n895\n00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,690\neven though he's the forensic investigator\nhimself, it's a double check to\n\n896\n00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:25,660\nmake sure that nothing's being screwed\nup or anything else needs to be done.\n\n897\n00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,130\n>> Wow, wow.\n\n898\n00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:29,160\nAll right, well I tell you what, ladies\nand gentlemen, looking at our clock,\n\n899\n00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,640\nit's getting pretty\nclose to our break time.\n\n900\n00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,250\nSo why don't we stop here.\n\n901\n00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:36,550\nWhen we come back, more about our\nfirst responder, so stay tuned.\n\n902\n00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:43,300\n[SOUND].\n\n903\n00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,630\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentleman.\n\n904\n00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:49,360\nSo continuing on with our\nfirst responder procedures.\n\n905\n00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:55,100\nNext thing we want to talk about Shawn\nis conducting preliminary interviews.\n\n906\n00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,070\nSo we had talked a little bit earlier\nabout the fact that they might,\n\n907\n00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:02,390\nfirst responder might be called on to do\nsome of these preliminary interviews.\n\n908\n00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:07,610\n>> Yes, you very well might be\nasked to do this sort of thing,\n\n909\n00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,460\nagain, as a first responder.\n\n910\n00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,790\nBut then again, you may not.\n\n911\n00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:18,020\nIt really all depends on how much rope,\nor how much they wanna give you.\n\n912\n00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,410\nYou know, they can give you a lot\nof rope and to do whatever,\n\n913\n00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:21,870\nthey give enough rope to hang yourself.\n\n914\n00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:27,560\nBut you know, I would say,\nas I said with a lot of stuff so far.\n\n915\n00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,460\nOr it all depends on the situation and\n\n916\n00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,810\nif they wanna empower you as\na first responder to do that.\n\n917\n00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:41,015\nAnd the reason why it's a touchy situation\nis because of something we already.\n\n918\n00:48:41,015 --> 00:48:47,245\nTalked about you could influence\nthe target of the investigation.\n\n919\n00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:52,035\nIf that's the person you could also be,\n\n920\n00:48:52,035 --> 00:48:56,355\nnot only could you steer them\nthe wrong way, it could be that you're\n\n921\n00:48:56,355 --> 00:49:01,035\nnot trained to tell this\nperson what their rights are.\n\n922\n00:49:01,035 --> 00:49:03,200\nYou may be in that situation.\n\n923\n00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,200\nWhere you could be entering a situation,\n\n924\n00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,030\nrather, that you could be\nviolating the person's rights.\n\n925\n00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:13,250\nThey may incriminating themselves.\n\n926\n00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:18,510\nThat would be the case in a criminal\nsituation, so you can't do that.\n\n927\n00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:24,370\nSo, you may just be a case of, well hey,\nI'm gonna have to keep you here,\n\n928\n00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:28,960\nat least get your name and\nphone number until such\n\n929\n00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,980\ntime as someone else gets here\nthat's qualified to question you.\n\n930\n00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,250\n>> So as a first responder, it might\nnot be a full blown interview where I'm\n\n931\n00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,760\nsitting down with this person or\nthe witnesses or whoever's in the area.\n\n932\n00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,990\nBut it might just be to determine whether\nit's worth holding this person around or\n\n933\n00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:46,750\nnot cuz we've gotta secure that scene.\n\n934\n00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,910\nIf this person was just happened to be\nwalking by, maybe we don't have to hold\n\n935\n00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:55,160\nthem, so maybe that's our job is to start\ngetting that initial contact information,\n\n936\n00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,785\nlet them know what's going on, and decide\nwhether or not they need to be detained or\n\n937\n00:49:59,785 --> 00:50:04,585\nnot, but not actually proceed\nwith the completed investigation.\n\n938\n00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,325\n>> Yeah.\nIt really, like I said,\n\n939\n00:50:06,325 --> 00:50:10,895\nall depends on that situation and\nthat company and\n\n940\n00:50:10,895 --> 00:50:15,890\nwhat they feel, like doing or what\nthe law says that they're allowed to do.\n\n941\n00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,070\nSo, you just don't wanna run foul of that.\n\n942\n00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:24,550\nErr on the side of caution and as far on\nthe side of caution as you possibly can\n\n943\n00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:28,810\nto make sure that nothing is\nscrewed up inadvertently.\n\n944\n00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:29,470\nAnd remember,\n\n945\n00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:34,080\nyou're not just interviewing the person\nthat is the subject of the investigation.\n\n946\n00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,860\nThere were other people in the area.\n\n947\n00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:41,220\nYou may be interviewing them, but\nthen again you might be just name and\n\n948\n00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,960\nphone number, name and phone number,\nname and phone number, whatever.\n\n949\n00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,060\nAddress, stuff like that.\n\n950\n00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,310\nYou may be putting all\nthose things together.\n\n951\n00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:50,100\nAnd let whoever talk to those people.\n\n952\n00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,400\nSo they may decide okay,\nyou got phone numbers?\n\n953\n00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,200\nWho is this person?\n\n954\n00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,690\nCuz you documented that.\n\n955\n00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,610\nThey talk to that person and say, okay,\n\n956\n00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:01,220\nthat person is not something\nwe need to pursue any further.\n\n957\n00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,380\nThat's not a lead.\n\n958\n00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,790\nIt really all depends,\n\n959\n00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:08,270\nbut you need to at least a very\ncursory questioning with people.\n\n960\n00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:14,030\nWhat do you do here,\nwhat's your name, stuff like that.\n\n961\n00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:14,660\nBasic stuff.\n\n962\n00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:19,490\nBeyond that,\nyou may not be allowed to actually do.\n\n963\n00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:23,580\nAnd don't get the idea that you're\ngoing to be an interrogator either.\n\n964\n00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,610\nSome people think that.\n\n965\n00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:25,640\n>> Break out the bright light.\n\n966\n00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,790\n>> Yea.\n>> And starts doing good cop bad cop on\n\n967\n00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,460\nthem or things like that.\n\n968\n00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n969\n00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:35,550\nIf you think you're gonna do that,\nyou're probably mistaken.\n\n970\n00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,400\n>> And I've got my light bulb that\ndoes the whole flicker thing.\n\n971\n00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,440\nI've got my chair that has the one\nleg that's just a hair shorter so\n\n972\n00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,970\nthey can't get comfortable.\n\n973\n00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:43,990\n>> Exactly, see.\n\n974\n00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:47,910\n>> Dang it, I got it all lined up.\n\n975\n00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:51,105\n[LAUGH] Then all he get to do is ask\nher for her phone number, come on.\n\n976\n00:51:51,105 --> 00:51:55,830\n[LAUGH] But it does make me think of,\nyou seen on of Law and\n\n977\n00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:00,600\nOrder, that police officer that arrives\nfirst, he's just a beat cop and\n\n978\n00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,260\nhe gets everybody's name and phone number,\n\n979\n00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:06,380\nand maybe a little bit about where\nthey're withstanding or what have you.\n\n980\n00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,870\nAnd then it's when the detective\nshow up and they go to the B cop and\n\n981\n00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,141\nthen they can say, okay,\n\n982\n00:52:10,141 --> 00:52:13,430\nwhere's the person and they could say,okay\nthis is so and so, and they're over there.\n\n983\n00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,100\nAnd then it's that detective that comes\nin and actually does the investigation.\n\n984\n00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,700\nSo very similar here, that first responder\nmight come it and assess the scene,\n\n985\n00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,900\ncoordinate everything off, and\ndetain people if necessary and\n\n986\n00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:28,770\nget their contact information or find out\ntheir name and where they were standing,\n\n987\n00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,620\nor what they saw, blah, blah, blah.\n\n988\n00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,140\nAnd it'll get hold tight.\n\n989\n00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,550\nAnd me have questions for you.\n\n990\n00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:37,240\nAnd then when that forensic investigator\ncomes in, they make that determination,\n\n991\n00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,510\nwe have to take this further and\n\n992\n00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:41,400\nask them questions, or\nwhat have you, interview them.\n\n993\n00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:47,760\n>> Yeah, this kind of fits into part\nof what we're talking about here,\n\n994\n00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,688\nwhere Brian says, does a company have\na legal right to detain an employee?\n\n995\n00:52:50,688 --> 00:52:53,620\nTypically not [LAUGH].\n\n996\n00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,360\nYou can't.\n\n997\n00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:01,060\nThat would be, I forget the exact term for\nit, but no, no.\n\n998\n00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,280\nYou'd have to,\nif you think someone needs to be detained.\n\n999\n00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,300\nTypically you're saying that\nif you're detaining them,\n\n1000\n00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,290\nyou could do it within reason, you know.\n\n1001\n00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,550\nAnd it's very limited.\n\n1002\n00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,140\nIf someone needs to be detained,\n\n1003\n00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:18,630\nit's gonna have to be law enforcement\nthemselves that does that.\n\n1004\n00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,290\n>> Right.\n>> Someone that's been in power to\n\n1005\n00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,060\ndo that.\n\n1006\n00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,090\nSecurity even.\n\n1007\n00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:27,550\nSecurity's gonna be limited on how\nmuch they can detain somebody.\n\n1008\n00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:30,350\nIf thy suspect them of a crime.\n\n1009\n00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:34,490\nIf they have committed a crime, then that\nbecomes different if they've witnessed it\n\n1010\n00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:40,330\nand have enough to say that that\nperson did it, but don't count on it.\n\n1011\n00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:44,090\n>> I think when we say detain, we don't\nmean detained as in like put them in cuffs\n\n1012\n00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:45,900\nand put them in a room or\nanything like that.\n\n1013\n00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,590\nIf I'm at a company and I'm investigating\nthis scene where this computer is, or\n\n1014\n00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:51,680\nwhat have you.\n\n1015\n00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,930\nThe people around, the ones that\nthe other company employees, well,\n\n1016\n00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:57,730\nthey're not gonna quit.\n\n1017\n00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:01,180\nIt's not like they're the target\nof the investigation.\n\n1018\n00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:04,440\nSo, we're gonna make sure that they stay\naround, and they don't leave for lunch,\n\n1019\n00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,300\nand they don't go home for\nthe day or anything like that, but\n\n1020\n00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,270\nwe definitely can't put them in cuffs or\nzip ties, or anything like that, right?\n\n1021\n00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:11,770\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1022\n00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,400\n>> You're not going to be doing that.\n\n1023\n00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,370\nIf you want to do it on\n\n1024\n00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:17,045\nyour personal time, that's fine.\nYou're not doing it at work.\n\n1025\n00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:17,620\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1026\n00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,800\nif he's the target of the investigation,\nand he wants to run, I don't think I\n\n1027\n00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,100\nhave the legal right to tackle him or\nanything like that, or detain him so.\n\n1028\n00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:31,780\n>> Yeah, and you know like anything\nthere's, there could be things that say,\n\n1029\n00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,878\nor could be situations and\nlaws that allow you to do that.\n\n1030\n00:54:35,878 --> 00:54:38,890\n>> Mm-hm\n>> I know, for\n\n1031\n00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:43,020\nexample, this is an unusual environment.\n\n1032\n00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,460\nBut it does kinda illustrate the point,\nwhich is what I'm looking for.\n\n1033\n00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:51,330\nIf you're in Las Vegas,\nyou commit a crime in a casino.\n\n1034\n00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,630\nCasino does have the right to detain you.\n\n1035\n00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,642\nAnd they will do so, too.\n\n1036\n00:54:56,642 --> 00:54:57,580\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1037\n00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,560\n>> But their basic rule is,\n\n1038\n00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,860\nat the casinos, there is if you\ncommit a crime against the casino.\n\n1039\n00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:07,810\nGame cheating, stuff like that, yeah\nthey'll detain you and hold you there, and\n\n1040\n00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:12,170\ntake care of whatever they need to at\nthat point, have the police get you.\n\n1041\n00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:15,900\nBut if it's something that is just you\npickpocket or something like that.\n\n1042\n00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,180\nThat's a crime, that's a crime anywhere.\n\n1043\n00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,490\nAnd then they will just hold\nyou until the police get there.\n\n1044\n00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:25,300\nBut they do have the right to detain you.\n\n1045\n00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:32,640\nSo, you try to run they're gonna hold you\nthere and they will use force to do it.\n\n1046\n00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,272\n>> All right.\nSo\n\n1047\n00:55:33,272 --> 00:55:37,920\nwe talked about conducting\nthose preliminary interviews.\n\n1048\n00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,590\nWhat about documenting our\nelectronic crime scene?\n\n1049\n00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,840\nTalking about like what types of\ndevices we found, and things like that.\n\n1050\n00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,721\n>> That would be as about as\nfar is I would be willing to\n\n1051\n00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:51,160\nlet someone take it in\nthis situation myself.\n\n1052\n00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,540\nThis is one of the ones\nwhere I would tell you that.\n\n1053\n00:55:54,540 --> 00:56:00,390\nDepending on who's credentials you get,\nthere could be some argument here.\n\n1054\n00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:06,320\nI think the correct answer would be,\nas far as documenting the electronic\n\n1055\n00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:12,370\ncrime scene, is it goes back to what's\nthe standard train that individual has.\n\n1056\n00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:16,840\nWhat tools can we get them so\nmake sure that's done correctly.\n\n1057\n00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,960\nAnd is that something that we even\nrealistically want to give them?\n\n1058\n00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,260\nOkay?\nThat would be, and\n\n1059\n00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,850\nis it legal to give them that?\n\n1060\n00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,000\nSo there's that side of it.\n\n1061\n00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,038\nIf you go to, for example,\nyou decide to go to EC-Council's CHFI\n\n1062\n00:56:30,038 --> 00:56:34,160\ncertification, a first responder they say,\nwell that person, yeah,\n\n1063\n00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,060\nshould be prepared to do memory dumps, and\nimaging, and all this other type of stuff\n\n1064\n00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,730\nI'm not comfortable saying that\nthat's what it's gonna be,\n\n1065\n00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:45,120\nbecause I don't know the first\nresponder's gonna be the type of person.\n\n1066\n00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:50,030\nI hand that suitcase I showed you earlier\nwith stuff in it to someone that is\n\n1067\n00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:52,350\na first responder,\nthey're gonna go, oh, look.\n\n1068\n00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,580\nThis is the craziest\nnotebook I've ever seen.\n\n1069\n00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,958\nThat's what they're gonna think you know,\nit's like look how old this thing is.\n\n1070\n00:56:58,958 --> 00:56:59,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They don't know that,\n\n1071\n00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,280\nwhat it's supposed to be doing.\n\n1072\n00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:08,410\nSo as a first responder,\nwe're limited to non-laboratory staff.\n\n1073\n00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:13,730\nBut EC Council says hey,\nit's laboratory and non-laboratory.\n\n1074\n00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,770\nThey include them both in there.\n\n1075\n00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:17,110\nI'm not comfortable doing that.\n\n1076\n00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:19,930\nAnd if you go to other credentials,\nlike we said, CCFP, and\n\n1077\n00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:25,530\nother stuff like that they will say,\nwell, first responder pictures,\n\n1078\n00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:30,890\ninterviews, sketches,\nstuff like that and then.\n\n1079\n00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:32,400\nThat's where we gotta cut it.\n\n1080\n00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,430\nSo, you make that determination, but we're\nacquainting with that could be there.\n\n1081\n00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:39,070\n>> Yeah, so important distinction verify,\nyou know, make sure you understand\n\n1082\n00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:42,860\na little difference in\nthe depending on which exam or\n\n1083\n00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,180\nwhich vendor you are going with.\n\n1084\n00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:49,520\nThey might make a difference in\nwhat a first responder's actually\n\n1085\n00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,530\nsupposed to be doing or what that normal\nprocedure for that first responder is.\n\n1086\n00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:55,810\nSo pay attention to that.\n\n1087\n00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,770\nCollecting and preserving electronic\nevidence, again probably another one that\n\n1088\n00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,130\nkind of falls along those same lines\n>> Yeah, but\n\n1089\n00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:04,860\nwe're putting these things in\nhere to let you know that.\n\n1090\n00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,810\nJust to make sure we've got our bases\ncovered to let you know that this\n\n1091\n00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:09,480\nis a possibility.\n\n1092\n00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,760\nYou know, and this course was designed to\nbe something that could qualify you for\n\n1093\n00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,780\nmultiple credentials with a little,\njust a little extra effort.\n\n1094\n00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,260\nAnd so this is one of the cases where\nthere's different schools of thought.\n\n1095\n00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:27,670\nYou may be preserving evidence and\ntaking care of that,\n\n1096\n00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:31,930\nor you might just be sitting back and\nwatching.\n\n1097\n00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:35,630\nI would say the limit of preserving\nevidence is preserving that\n\n1098\n00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:39,930\ncrime scene as is and you've done\nthat if you've secured the site and\n\n1099\n00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:42,960\nkept anybody from going around.\n\n1100\n00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,640\nProbably one of the further things\noutside of that is the cellphones\n\n1101\n00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,430\nthat we talked about.\n\n1102\n00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:49,900\nCellphones, tablets, stuff like that.\n\n1103\n00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:55,480\nPutting those things locked in Faraday\ncages, or stuff like that, shielded.\n\n1104\n00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,230\nAgain, those are unique cases.\n\n1105\n00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:04,300\n>> Right, so, it's more like the CEH,\nthe EC Councils seems to be\n\n1106\n00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:09,570\ngeared more towards that first responder\nbeing a trained forensic investigator,\n\n1107\n00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:14,330\nwhereas some of the other vendors,\nthe ISC squared,\n\n1108\n00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:19,060\nthe first responder is probably not gonna\nbe the trained, forensic investigator,\n\n1109\n00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,948\nwhich is why we differentiate between\nthe forensic investigator and\n\n1110\n00:59:21,948 --> 00:59:25,910\nthat first responder.\n\n1111\n00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,420\nAll right, and\n\n1112\n00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,950\nreally we can almost kinda keep going\nthrough these things like packaging and\n\n1113\n00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,605\ntransporting electronic evidence.\n\n1114\n00:59:30,605 --> 00:59:32,975\nYeah, we've talked about this, right,\nwe've talked about how to do that,\n\n1115\n00:59:32,975 --> 00:59:34,555\nhow to secure that crime scene.\n\n1116\n00:59:34,555 --> 00:59:39,675\nAs far as every first responder goes,\nif he's allowed to do that,\n\n1117\n00:59:39,675 --> 00:59:43,150\nor like you say if he has enough rope or\nif he has the authority to do that\n\n1118\n00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,700\nIt's not gonna be any different than\nwhat we talked about before, right?\n\n1119\n00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:46,730\nWe're gonna label it,\n\n1120\n00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:50,835\npackage it up, making sure it's\nfollow our chain of custody, right?\n\n1121\n00:59:50,835 --> 00:59:51,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1122\n00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,650\n>> I can't think of anything else to say.\n\n1123\n00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:57,900\n>> There's not really too much, except for\n\n1124\n00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,960\nsome unique stuff that we\nalready talked about a couple.\n\n1125\n01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,640\nIt's probably not gonna be too much\nyou know deviation from that, and\n\n1126\n01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,930\nin fact, some of the stuff\nyou may not be able to do.\n\n1127\n01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:16,310\nThe difference might be if you\nare non laboratory personnel.\n\n1128\n01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:20,580\nOne of the big differences might\nbe if the company says, you know,\n\n1129\n01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:26,490\nas part of your kit, I'm going to give you\na stack of forms that are consent forms.\n\n1130\n01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:30,940\nConsent forms are if the person that\nyou're investigating is still there,\n\n1131\n01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,620\nyou can say, okay, you know,\n\n1132\n01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:35,900\nyou're signing your basically\nyour life away if you do this.\n\n1133\n01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,190\nThen I can go ahead and\nI can start looking a bit more.\n\n1134\n01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:44,230\nThat's gonna depend on you know,\nif you want the first responder\n\n1135\n01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:48,840\ndoing that type of thing, and\nif you think that's necessary or\n\n1136\n01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,800\nthink that's something that you\nare okay with them doing, then CYA.\n\n1137\n01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,230\nGet the documentation,\nget the form for someone who can.\n\n1138\n01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:01,570\nTo see if they want to consent to it or\nnot.\n\n1139\n01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:03,500\n>> Yeah sure, I got you.\n\n1140\n01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,930\nSo collecting, observing electronic\nevidence, really same idea,\n\n1141\n01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:09,300\nif they have that authority.\n\n1142\n01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,210\nPackaging and\ntransporting electronic evidence?\n\n1143\n01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,970\nProbably right along those same lines?\n\n1144\n01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,930\n>> Yeah if that's the situation,\nthen yeah.\n\n1145\n01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:23,340\nAt the transporting evidence I might\nadd to that If it's that cell phone,\n\n1146\n01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:29,070\nand tablet, and notebook situation,\nI mean anything that mobile and portable.\n\n1147\n01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:31,960\nAnd you are concerned with\ncontrolling that scene.\n\n1148\n01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:34,050\nTake a picture.\n\n1149\n01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:35,230\nShow where it is.\n\n1150\n01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:40,820\nAnd then you can put it in a case or\na box.\n\n1151\n01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:44,830\nAnd lock it in your office or something,\nif you have a supply closet, whatever.\n\n1152\n01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:50,260\nAnd keep everyone out of there until\nsomeone arrives to look at it.\n\n1153\n01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,660\nBy doing that,\nyou've shown that it's there.\n\n1154\n01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,130\nYou've taken a picture\nof where you've put it.\n\n1155\n01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:57,530\nAnd you know, and\nyou've maintained a very crude\n\n1156\n01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:01,080\nchain of custody to say this has\nbeen locked, and blah blah blah.\n\n1157\n01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:06,930\nAnd that way,\nyou are reasonably covered at that point.\n\n1158\n01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:11,030\nAnd if you're asked why\nyou moved something,\n\n1159\n01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:14,090\nlike if it came up in a report later on,\nwell,\n\n1160\n01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:19,270\nbecause I believe there's a way that you\ncould easily, under the right conditions,\n\n1161\n01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:23,810\nsay that there was a more than reasonable\nchance that I think that may have been\n\n1162\n01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:28,140\ncompromised or walked off with, so\nI sealed them up and put them in here,\n\n1163\n01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:31,990\nbut here's a sworn statement\nsaying I didn't tamper with this.\n\n1164\n01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:36,820\nAnd here's pictures that show the same,\nand here's a witness.\n\n1165\n01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:37,830\nYou can do that.\n\n1166\n01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,270\n>> All right, good.\n\n1167\n01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:42,620\nAnd then you've mentioned on more\nthan one occasion, note taking.\n\n1168\n01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:46,910\nSo, this is something that I really\nwant that first responder to do,\n\n1169\n01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:50,620\nbecause they may not be trained and\nable to do some of the other stuff, but\n\n1170\n01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,520\nthey can definitely take notes, right?\n\n1171\n01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,240\nThey can start sketching things,\nthey could.\n\n1172\n01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:55,838\n>> You hope.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1173\n01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:56,346\n>> Hopefully.\n\n1174\n01:02:56,346 --> 01:02:59,468\n[LAUGH] >> You hope, anyway, I may be\nsound like I'm being a bit of a jerk on\n\n1175\n01:02:59,468 --> 01:03:02,400\nthat going you hope that they\ngot at least one brain cell.\n\n1176\n01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,600\nNow, here's the thing.\n\n1177\n01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:08,440\nOnce you once you,\nyou know will hopefully.\n\n1178\n01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:14,650\nOnce you go through forensics training and\nkind of cut your teeth and gnawing on it.\n\n1179\n01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:18,000\nAnd you're out and you're actually\ndoing this role of investigation.\n\n1180\n01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:22,635\nYou kind of know where\nto put your opinion.\n\n1181\n01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:26,253\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where to put your opinion and\n\n1182\n01:03:26,253 --> 01:03:27,965\nwhere to put the facts.\n\n1183\n01:03:27,965 --> 01:03:29,425\n>> There's somewhere you\ncan put your opinion.\n\n1184\n01:03:29,425 --> 01:03:30,585\n>> Yeah, I'll tell you where.\n\n1185\n01:03:30,585 --> 01:03:36,112\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, but you know how to separate\n\n1186\n01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:41,745\nthose two, or you're more conscious of it.\n\n1187\n01:03:41,745 --> 01:03:45,540\nSee, people that are first responders,\nthey don't have that type of training so\n\n1188\n01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:49,170\nthey may get out their notepad or the\naudio recorder or their iPad, whatever,\n\n1189\n01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:52,965\nand start writing stuff down and making\njust wild guesses and stuff like that, and\n\n1190\n01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:54,590\nputting opinions in there.\n\n1191\n01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:59,260\nBecause they've seen one too many\nepisodes of CSI or whatever, and\n\n1192\n01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:03,850\nthey think that hey they're awesome and\nthey're gonna be the person on the spot,\n\n1193\n01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:07,700\nand they're gonna tell you how they\nGoogle stuff and everything else.\n\n1194\n01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,570\nThat's the thing,\nwe see it in other areas,\n\n1195\n01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:13,070\nit's not like I'm making something\ncrazy up or anything here.\n\n1196\n01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:16,935\nThat's actually a fact, I mean,\nhow many Google doctors do you know?\n\n1197\n01:04:16,935 --> 01:04:19,430\n>> [LAUGH] Several, actually.\n\n1198\n01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:22,910\n>> Yeah, it's like,\noh look at this, I got leprosy.\n\n1199\n01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:24,450\nNo you don't, you don't.\n\n1200\n01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:26,575\nJust, you know.\n\n1201\n01:04:26,575 --> 01:04:30,405\nDude I got a problem with my ovaries.\n\n1202\n01:04:30,405 --> 01:04:32,175\nDude, you don't have those.\n\n1203\n01:04:32,175 --> 01:04:34,015\n>> That's not what google says.\n\n1204\n01:04:34,015 --> 01:04:35,815\n>> Google says you can.\n\n1205\n01:04:35,815 --> 01:04:40,855\nBecause there's one out of every\nfive billion people and, yeah.\n\n1206\n01:04:40,855 --> 01:04:46,055\nBut you'll get those types of situations,\nor we see those.\n\n1207\n01:04:46,055 --> 01:04:49,240\nI mean we see it with doctors.\n\n1208\n01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:53,370\nWe see it with other cases.\n\n1209\n01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:58,223\nAll of us know people that are experts on\nstuff because they've looked at Wikipedia\n\n1210\n01:04:58,223 --> 01:05:02,330\na whole bunch of times and decide\nthat they're an expert on that area.\n\n1211\n01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:05,040\nIt's like, no, no you're not.\n\n1212\n01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:14,377\nRemember in school,\nthey used to teach you years ago,\n\n1213\n01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,830\ncuz we're both the same age range.\n\n1214\n01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,310\nThey used to teach this is how you\nread a sentence and that sentence,\n\n1215\n01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:22,710\nis this an opinion, or is that a fact?\n\n1216\n01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,790\nThey would tell you how to read it.\n\n1217\n01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:29,510\nNow days they don't teach that type of\nstuff nearly as much if at all anymore.\n\n1218\n01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:32,490\nSo people are kind of like,\noh that's a fact.\n\n1219\n01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:34,550\nThey go to one news source, that's a fact.\n\n1220\n01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:40,345\nIt's like, no,\nyou gotta look at multiple sources,\n\n1221\n01:05:40,345 --> 01:05:42,705\nyou know, that's just the way it is.\n\n1222\n01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:45,895\n>> It's really a sad state today, but\nI know that when people talk to me,\n\n1223\n01:05:45,895 --> 01:05:49,465\nusually when they tell me some kind\nof fact, that I wasn't aware of,\n\n1224\n01:05:49,465 --> 01:05:52,512\none of the first things they say is,\nwhere did you read that?\n\n1225\n01:05:52,512 --> 01:05:54,822\nBecause I know it's\ngoing to be Facebook or\n\n1226\n01:05:54,822 --> 01:05:59,642\nWikipedia, nobody bothers to\ndouble check anything anymore.\n\n1227\n01:05:59,642 --> 01:06:01,352\nJust take it on faith.\n\n1228\n01:06:01,352 --> 01:06:05,531\nBut anyway back to the point here,\nlots of things about this first responder.\n\n1229\n01:06:05,531 --> 01:06:09,551\nNow, we've kind of joked around\na few things here and there, but\n\n1230\n01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:13,737\nthere are some common mistakes that these\nfirst responders are gonna make, right?\n\n1231\n01:06:13,737 --> 01:06:16,751\n>> Yup.\n>> Like, me playing Magee earlier, and\n\n1232\n01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:19,220\nthe first thing that Sean\nsays is what do you see here?\n\n1233\n01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:22,330\nAnd do I see with my eyes or\ndo I see with my hands?\n\n1234\n01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:25,010\nAnd I went, and\nI picked that thing up, right?\n\n1235\n01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:25,750\n>> It's human nature.\n\n1236\n01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,430\n>> It's just a very common mistake.\n\n1237\n01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:29,270\nAnd there's many others, right?\n\n1238\n01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:32,210\n>> It's human nature, you know?\n\n1239\n01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:36,000\nWhat you did was not like,\nanything unusual.\n\n1240\n01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,170\n>> As a human I wanna\nbring in all my senses so\n\n1241\n01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:41,730\nthat I can see what this is, right.\n\n1242\n01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:44,810\nPart of that is feeling it, touching it,\nturning it, looking at the other side of\n\n1243\n01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:49,027\nit, things like that, and we've gotta\ntrain these people to not do that.\n\n1244\n01:06:49,027 --> 01:06:51,885\nYou gotta stand back and look at it and\n\n1245\n01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:55,905\nobserve what you can without\ndisturbing anything.\n\n1246\n01:06:55,905 --> 01:06:57,655\n>> Yeah, and guess what?\n\n1247\n01:06:57,655 --> 01:07:02,157\nSome of the stuff that I talked\nabout earlier during this whole\n\n1248\n01:07:02,157 --> 01:07:04,928\nfirst responder stuff was, oh yeah,\n\n1249\n01:07:04,928 --> 01:07:10,340\nyou gotta try the password on the system,\nunplug stuff, you know.\n\n1250\n01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:13,050\nNo, we have procedures for\nthat as forensic personal.\n\n1251\n01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:18,095\nThey as a first responder is making sure\neverything stays in order, however we say,\n\n1252\n01:07:18,095 --> 01:07:19,940\ntil' we get there.\n\n1253\n01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:22,850\nThat's the long and the short of it.\n\n1254\n01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:26,180\nI don't want them going through and\nplaying amateur detective.\n\n1255\n01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:29,670\nI don't want them googling stuff or\nanything else, cuz they will do it.\n\n1256\n01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:32,200\nThey will google all the stuff and\n\n1257\n01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:36,080\nget guidance from the internet\nto tell them how to handle this.\n\n1258\n01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,410\nIt's like, I could care less what\nthe internet says, it's what I say,\n\n1259\n01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:40,630\nI'm the person in charge here.\n\n1260\n01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,710\n>> But Shawn you're on your\nway I want to impress you so\n\n1261\n01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,660\nbad get some of this\ndone before you get here.\n\n1262\n01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:48,220\n[LAUGH]\n>> I will burn down your house\n\n1263\n01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:51,860\nif you touch anything.\n\n1264\n01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,980\nHey you gotta keep them in line.\n\n1265\n01:07:55,050 --> 01:08:00,110\nAnd another mistake to kind of\nput it on that previous point\n\n1266\n01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:04,274\nof the note taking one,\nyou're gonna have to tell people,\n\n1267\n01:08:04,274 --> 01:08:08,750\nit's like you say in the Dragnet show,\njust the facts.\n\n1268\n01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,870\nThat's what it is, just the facts.\n\n1269\n01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:12,110\nBut I think, and whatever,\n\n1270\n01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:14,440\nit's fascinating what you think,\nwhat are the facts?\n\n1271\n01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,800\nIf you want to tell me,\n\n1272\n01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,560\nonce you handed me the notes, what you may\nthink, that may give me some more insight.\n\n1273\n01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,930\nI'm not gonna say, hey,\nI don't wanna hear anything from you.\n\n1274\n01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:27,670\nI wanna have the notes there.\n\n1275\n01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,440\nIf you want to include your opinion,\n\n1276\n01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,520\nI want to see it clearly\ndefined as an opinion.\n\n1277\n01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,271\nI don't want to see everything\nput there as a statement of fact.\n\n1278\n01:08:34,271 --> 01:08:37,190\nI wanna see, okay, what did you see.\n\n1279\n01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:40,646\nOkay well, is that you actually\nsaying you saw it that way, or\n\n1280\n01:08:40,646 --> 01:08:43,300\nis that what you think you saw?\n\n1281\n01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:49,180\nWhat you think you saw\ncarries some weight to it,\n\n1282\n01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:52,380\nbut it's not as important\nas what you really saw.\n\n1283\n01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,300\nJust saying you saw someone go around\nthe corner, did you see them go around\n\n1284\n01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:03,419\nthe corner, or did you just see\na knee down goin in there, or\n\n1285\n01:09:03,419 --> 01:09:05,990\ndid you see enough of that person\nto actually know it was them?\n\n1286\n01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:07,070\nWell, I didn't see the whole person.\n\n1287\n01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:09,660\nWell that's different,\nyou're making an assumptions, so.\n\n1288\n01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,420\n>> They went around the corner and\nwent into that doorway.\n\n1289\n01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:14,920\nWait a second, what should I do?\n\n1290\n01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:19,910\nIf they walked around the corner,\nhow did you see them going in the doorway?\n\n1291\n01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,140\n>> There you go.\n\n1292\n01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:24,450\nAnd that's the type of thing,\nit would sound stupid.\n\n1293\n01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:27,760\nCould you make a logical\nassumption if no one was there?\n\n1294\n01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,530\nAnd that person was in that room,\nthen yeah, you could probably make\n\n1295\n01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:32,920\nan assumption, a correct one\nthat that person went in there.\n\n1296\n01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,610\nIt's logical to assume that\ngotta take the next level.\n\n1297\n01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:39,640\nBut, I wanna try to kind of you know,\nseparate,\n\n1298\n01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:44,265\nyou know the stuff that's opinion from\nfact, because that's what I have to go on.\n\n1299\n01:09:44,265 --> 01:09:48,295\nI will interview them as a forensics\nperson to see okay, what about this,\n\n1300\n01:09:48,295 --> 01:09:48,955\nwhat about this?\n\n1301\n01:09:48,955 --> 01:09:51,805\nI see you thought this is what you saw,\nwhy did you think that?\n\n1302\n01:09:51,805 --> 01:09:53,715\nI'll get inside their head.\n\n1303\n01:09:53,715 --> 01:09:57,275\nIf that first responder puts that down\nthere, the reason why I'm not gonna say,\n\n1304\n01:09:57,275 --> 01:10:01,175\ncompletely eliminate opinion, just kinda\nseparate it, is because if they write\n\n1305\n01:10:01,175 --> 01:10:05,880\ntheir opinion down there with the other\nstuff I can look at the facts there.\n\n1306\n01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,520\nI can talk about the facts,\nthen see their opinion, and\n\n1307\n01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,700\nit can some of the gears\nmoving in their head.\n\n1308\n01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:15,840\nAnd hopefully, I can start seeing okay,\nwhy did you do that?\n\n1309\n01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,330\nMaybe they have a valid point.\n\n1310\n01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:20,050\nThey were there,\nmaybe they didn't see the whole thing but,\n\n1311\n01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,970\nthey saw other things that\nmight be of use to me.\n\n1312\n01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:22,640\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1313\n01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,150\nIt's not that we don't want their opinion,\n\n1314\n01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:26,910\nwe just want to make sure that\nit's separated out, right.\n\n1315\n01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:30,410\nIt has its place but\nnot along side our facts.\n\n1316\n01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:35,470\nAll right, well Shawn, we have covered\nfirst responder procedures pretty heavily.\n\n1317\n01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:37,080\nAnything else we want to\nadd while we're here?\n\n1318\n01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,230\n>> Just remember,\nwhen we're talking first responders,\n\n1319\n01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:46,230\nif you're somebody that's going for\nthe credentials here.\n\n1320\n01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:49,170\nRemember, the definition of\na first responder can change.\n\n1321\n01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:53,330\nThis is one where, like I said, we didn't\ndesign the course with any one credential\n\n1322\n01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:58,787\nin mind, but, and there's several books\nout there on all the different credential.\n\n1323\n01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:03,330\nWhichever credential you see yourself\ngetting, make sure you're familiar with\n\n1324\n01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:07,440\nwhat their definition, what their\nexpectations of a first responder are.\n\n1325\n01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:11,930\nThis is just one of the areas\nthat could be a snag for you.\n\n1326\n01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:15,236\n>> Yeah, there is a lot of commonalty\nobviously between the different vendors\n\n1327\n01:11:15,236 --> 01:11:19,112\nand certifications, but there's also some\ndissimilarities that we gotta be aware of,\n\n1328\n01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:21,540\nand we'll try and\nmake sure we point those out for you and\n\n1329\n01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,160\nfirst responders being one of them.\n\n1330\n01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,120\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1331\n01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,970\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen\nthat is gonna do it for today's show.\n\n1332\n01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:28,610\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n1333\n01:11:28,610 -->

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:37,107\nAnd welcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,107 --> 00:00:40,786\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:41,843\nHow you doing today, Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:42,981\n>> I'm doing great, how bout you?\n\n9\n00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:46,824\n>> I'm doing fantastic, looking\nforward to today's episode, cuz today,\n\n10\n00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:50,667\nwe're continuing on with our digital\nforensic investigator episodes and\n\n11\n00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:53,662\ntoday's episode is my,\nis our computer forensics labs.\n\n12\n00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:56,796\nSo, we're gonna take a look at\nsetting up a forensics lab.\n\n13\n00:00:56,796 --> 00:01:00,294\nTaking a look at all the equipment\ninvolved in setting up a lab,\n\n14\n00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:03,462\nas well as taking a look at\nsome of the software involved,\n\n15\n00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:06,246\nwhere that you might need\nto run one of these labs.\n\n16\n00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:07,941\nSo, really exciting show, I can't wait.\n\n17\n00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:12,085\nIn fact, let's just dive in and\nget started, right?\n\n18\n00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:15,166\nFirst, I think the first thing\nwe need to talk about is why\n\n19\n00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,849\nwe would want a forensics lab.\n\n20\n00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:20,571\nWhat is the point of setting\nup this forensics lab, Sean?\n\n21\n00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:25,431\n>> The point to set the whole thing up\nis to, you know, that system we had,\n\n22\n00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:29,894\nfor example, yesterday,\nwhen that simulated scenario we had.\n\n23\n00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:33,531\nWe're gonna be taking it somewhere for\nprocessing, at least in our show,\n\n24\n00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:35,899\nwe're taking it some place for\nprocessing and so\n\n25\n00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,495\nthat place we're taking it for\nprocessing isn't just a normal cubicle.\n\n26\n00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:43,988\n>> Just take it back to my basement or\nmy garage or something like that.\n\n27\n00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:46,368\n>> Not without a lot of work, you know.\n\n28\n00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:49,677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But people can do that sort of thing,\n\n29\n00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:53,266\nbut it's still prep work,\nit's not the same thing you would go and\n\n30\n00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:55,074\nbuild your regular computer on.\n\n31\n00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:58,540\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah, you don't take this\nto the kitchen table and lay it out and\n\n32\n00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,854\nstart doing this stuff with breakfast\nnext to you and all that, right?\n\n33\n00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:02,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n34\n00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,613\nYeah, you definitely want to have\ncertain standards that are followed.\n\n35\n00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:11,732\nAgain, it's that thing of being\ncalled into question, and\n\n36\n00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,253\nyou're gonna see that a lot in here.\n\n37\n00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:18,846\nWhen we talk about, how you choose\na location and how you construct it and\n\n38\n00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:20,813\nwhat hardware you have there.\n\n39\n00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:23,596\nAll those things go a long\nway towards,you know,\n\n40\n00:02:23,596 --> 00:02:26,114\nsaying that we have a nice\nsecure facility and\n\n41\n00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:30,634\nwe can make sure things are being followed\nand the right procedures are in place.\n\n42\n00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:35,202\nAnd that way when we process the stuff and\nstore it and move it out and all that,\n\n43\n00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:40,351\nthere's no question that there's any funny\nbusiness or anything going on, not all.\n\n44\n00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:44,113\n>> Yeah, cuz credibility is gonna be\na very important part, if we're doing this\n\n45\n00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:47,875\nas a company for myself, or if we're\nworking with an organization, if we're\n\n46\n00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,194\nhired by an in house organization,\ncredibility is very important.\n\n47\n00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:55,300\nIf I'm gonna take this to the court of\nlaw, those defense attorneys are going to\n\n48\n00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,670\nbe doing everything they can to\npoke holes in that, and I can't,\n\n49\n00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,388\nI don't want to give them\nany easy ways out, right.\n\n50\n00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:04,998\nAnd, so, even if we do things right,\nand we do things correctly,\n\n51\n00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:06,809\nas you were saying the other day.\n\n52\n00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:08,668\nIf they can stand up in a court of law and\nsay,\n\n53\n00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:10,490\ndidn't you do this on your kitchen table?\n\n54\n00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,671\nThat's gonna put some doubt\nin the jurors minds, right.\n\n55\n00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:17,895\nIt doesn't mean that your work is any\nless correct or right or whatever, but,\n\n56\n00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:20,845\nit introduces doubt or\nissues with your credibility.\n\n57\n00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,509\nSo, you wanna have a good lab set up and\n\n58\n00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:25,369\nyou wanna follow the standards that\nare accepted by the courts and\n\n59\n00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:28,229\nthe other systems, that way you\ndon't have to worry about that.\n\n60\n00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:29,123\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n61\n00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:32,849\nThat's one of the key things here.\n\n62\n00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:36,361\nSo, just keep that in mind\nas we're going through this,\n\n63\n00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:41,482\nthat we're trying to make it, so we have\nsomething that, you know, holds water,\n\n64\n00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:46,531\nstands up to scrutiny, and that there's\nliterally no question about the state of\n\n65\n00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:51,749\nhow we're processing stuff, where it's\nbeing stored, you know, who's there.\n\n66\n00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,862\nYou know, all that good stuff.\n\n67\n00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:56,072\n>> That's another thing I didn't think\nabout, if your kids are running in and\n\n68\n00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:58,471\nout of your little area, that's probably\nnot good for your credibility either.\n\n69\n00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:03,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n70\n00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,400\nSo let's start, I guess one of the first\nthings we probably wanna talk about,\n\n71\n00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,329\nif we're gonna set up a forensics lab is,\n\n72\n00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,551\nI've gotta decide how\nmuch I've got to spend.\n\n73\n00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,314\nBecause that's really gonna change.\n\n74\n00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:15,941\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's gonna\n\n75\n00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:17,170\nbe the underlying determining factor,\nI guess.\n\n76\n00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,081\nWhat type of equipment, what type of\nfacility and things like that is,\n\n77\n00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,034\nhow much money do I really\nhave to put into this?\n\n78\n00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:25,134\n>> Yeah, that's the thing.\n\n79\n00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,424\nYou're gonna have,\nyour eyeballs will gonna be a lot and\n\n80\n00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:29,917\nyour desire's gonna be a lot\nbigger than what your budget is.\n\n81\n00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:35,536\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's just face it.\n\n82\n00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:39,170\nNone of us are, you know,\nnone of us has a new concept to.\n\n83\n00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,271\nWe've all been in IT and\nwe know how it is.\n\n84\n00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:42,652\nIt's like, we'd like this.\n\n85\n00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,835\nYeah, but you're getting that, so.\n\n86\n00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:47,911\n>> Every toy you've shown so far, I've\ngone, oh, I'm gonna go get one of those.\n\n87\n00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:50,976\nI get home, I look it up and\noh, well yeah.\n\n88\n00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:51,812\nNever mind.\n\n89\n00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:57,036\n[LAUGH]\n>> That happens.\n\n90\n00:04:57,036 --> 00:05:02,407\nThere's gonna be a lot of candy and\ntoys, that's what you see here and\n\n91\n00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:07,960\nif you have a budget at the company,\nyou're gonna have to make a choice,\n\n92\n00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,239\ncuz unless you got just a really\nmassive budget, which does happen,\n\n93\n00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:17,817\nthen you're probably not gonna\nget all these little toys.\n\n94\n00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,930\nBut there's other ways to acquire it.\n\n95\n00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,289\nAnd I'll just put that out there.\n\n96\n00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:24,110\nThere are other ways\nto acquire this stuff.\n\n97\n00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,893\nWithout having to spend tons and\ntons of money and still get good stuff.\n\n98\n00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:32,167\nDon't lose heart yet.\n\n99\n00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:32,987\nWe'll talk about what that is.\n\n100\n00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:37,642\n>> And it might be some basic equipment\nthat I really need to get started in, and\n\n101\n00:05:37,642 --> 00:05:40,841\nothers that would be nice to have,\nthat I can maybe,\n\n102\n00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,630\nadd to my collection as\nI start making money.\n\n103\n00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,262\nOr we've got a budget, and\nif that budget rolls around next year,\n\n104\n00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,132\nthen I can pick up some more equipment and\nsome more equipment each time.\n\n105\n00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:52,510\nSo it's not like I have to dump it in,\nall this money at once.\n\n106\n00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,207\nRight.\n\n107\n00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:53,995\nWe can start with some basics.\n\n108\n00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:54,785\n>> Yes.\n\n109\n00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:55,993\n>> And then kinda build up as we go.\n\n110\n00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:56,689\n>> Yes.\n\n111\n00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,291\nThere's things that are must haves.\n\n112\n00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,416\nAnd there's things that\nwould be nice to have.\n\n113\n00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n114\n00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,315\n>> You'll kinda have to figure\nout what those categories are.\n\n115\n00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:09,974\nBut, when you're figuring that out and\nyou're starting to figure out what your\n\n116\n00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:13,194\nbudget's gonna be,\ncuz you may be in a position where,\n\n117\n00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:17,331\nyou're gonna be asked to say,\nwhat type of budget are you looking for.\n\n118\n00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:21,049\nThere's probably a lot of people out here,\nin the chat room,\n\n119\n00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:23,565\nthat have been through that themselves.\n\n120\n00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:27,791\nWhere, you know, what do you need and\nyou put together whatever as a budget.\n\n121\n00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,762\nWell, things that are gonna help you\nput together a budget for this and\n\n122\n00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:35,546\ngonna determine what type of\nequipment you have is types of cases.\n\n123\n00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:39,980\nYou're expected to process crime\nstatistics for your area, or\n\n124\n00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,068\nif you work for a corporation,\nincidents that that company has had over,\n\n125\n00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:47,712\nmaybe the past year or past two years.\n\n126\n00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:49,512\nSo you have that part of it.\n\n127\n00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:54,313\nAnd then you even have scope of authority,\nas maybe they don't expect you to\n\n128\n00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:59,206\ninvestigate certain cases, so\nyou don't need certain types of equipment.\n\n129\n00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:00,111\nThat's all gonna fit in.\n\n130\n00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:00,773\n>> Right.\n\n131\n00:07:00,773 --> 00:07:04,000\nIf we're not travelling out to remote\nsites or to people's houses or\n\n132\n00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,891\nsomething like that, maybe I don't need\nthat fancy generator that allows me to cut\n\n133\n00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:11,670\nthat outlet out of the wall and bring that\npower with me, or something like that,\n\n134\n00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,449\nif everything's in [CROSSTALK]\n>> You really want\n\n135\n00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:13,985\none of those, don't you?\n\n136\n00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:14,832\n>> I do.\n\n137\n00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:16,609\nI really want one.\n\n138\n00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:19,650\n[LAUGH] I think that's just\nthe coolest thing ever.\n\n139\n00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,259\n[LAUGH] You can see all of\nthe outlets from my house,\n\n140\n00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,191\nthey're going to be all hanging\nout of the wall and cut off.\n\n141\n00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:27,208\nI'm just practicing moving stuff from one\nroom to another and keeping it powered on.\n\n142\n00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:31,863\nSo, we're gonna have a budget, it's gonna\ncontrol what types of equipment to have.\n\n143\n00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:36,122\nSo, the main thing is, to get an idea of\nhow much we need for what I have to have,\n\n144\n00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,575\nand as Sean says,\nwe do that by determining,\n\n145\n00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:41,506\nlooking at the types of\nthings we're gonna be doing.\n\n146\n00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:46,371\nIf I'm working in-house and I'm working\nfor a company, none of my machines,\n\n147\n00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:48,344\nin-house have a floppy drive.\n\n148\n00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:51,863\nSo maybe I don't need to go and\nbuy an eight inch, or a five and\n\n149\n00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:55,866\na quarter floppy drive or anything\nlike that, I can hold off on that.\n\n150\n00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:59,140\nAgain, so you just have to look at it as,\nwhat do I really need, and\n\n151\n00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,259\nprioritize, right?\n\n152\n00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:02,896\nThat's probably the best word to say,\nis just prioritize.\n\n153\n00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:06,236\nAnd also remember there's also other\nthings besides the equipment too.\n\n154\n00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:12,450\nThere is also where you're\nactually gonna have that lab.\n\n155\n00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,050\nBecause if this is a first time for you,\nit's pretty much assured that you just\n\n156\n00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,060\ncan't go into a room in your facility and\nsay, well that's our forensics lab.\n\n157\n00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,780\nThere's gonna be more to it than that,\nthere's gonna be upgrading the locks and\n\n158\n00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,290\nthe access to it,\ndoing just a whole bunch of things.\n\n159\n00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,630\nWe talked about some of\nthis stuff in CEH classes,\n\n160\n00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,580\nit was also, I know they talked\nabout this in the CISSP and\n\n161\n00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,619\nthe Security Plus,\nif you've been through those.\n\n162\n00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,982\nIf you have it, you can take a look at the\nphysical security sections of those, and\n\n163\n00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:49,850\nsee, kinda, some of the details.\n\n164\n00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,820\nBut there's things like, to upgrade a\nroom, you would have to check to see well,\n\n165\n00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,270\ndo you have any false ceilings, or\ndropped ceilings in there that need\n\n166\n00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:03,129\nto be addressed so someone can't come\ninto the room by bypassing locks?\n\n167\n00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,900\nThat's one issue that comes up.\n\n168\n00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,670\nThere's environmental controls.\n\n169\n00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,950\nYou know, someone had actually mentioned,\nyesterday, about, is there any concerns\n\n170\n00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,790\nwith moving a system from the environment\nthat it's in to another one?\n\n171\n00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,140\nTalking, presumably, about temperature,\nhumidity and all that.\n\n172\n00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,600\nThere absolutely is.\n\n173\n00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,155\nIf the temperature\ndifference is too great,\n\n174\n00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:32,920\nthen you very well could get\ncondensation or anything inside a case.\n\n175\n00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,060\nAnd that's gonna be the same\nthing inside a lab, too.\n\n176\n00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,280\nWhen you take it in there it could very\nwell cause problems with the equipment.\n\n177\n00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,410\nSo you're gonna have to be\nmindful of a lot of things.\n\n178\n00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,590\nYou know, so, like I said,\n\n179\n00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:50,770\nit's the equipment,\nit's the environment you're putting it in.\n\n180\n00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,350\nYou're gonna have to also be prepared for\n\n181\n00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,150\nthe fact that people\nthat work in forensics,\n\n182\n00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,385\nif they're doing a lot of cases, they\ncan be spending a lot of hours in there.\n\n183\n00:09:57,385 --> 00:10:01,615\nSo now it's more than just a regular room,\nit's something that's basically\n\n184\n00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:04,455\na living space, so\nyou have to upgrade it accordingly.\n\n185\n00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:08,165\nAnd then they have to have their own\nmeeting rooms, and their own networks, and\n\n186\n00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:08,945\nstuff like that.\n\n187\n00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:13,115\nSo it can be pretty substantial and\nyou're talking, and all those things.\n\n188\n00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:17,325\nWe'll get more into that, but you're\ntalking about a pretty good budget there,\n\n189\n00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,470\njust to get started.\n\n190\n00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,390\nEven in addition to the fact\nthat of all your equipment,\n\n191\n00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,270\neven if you get just the basics,\n\n192\n00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:30,360\nyou're still talking a reasonable\namount under a number of circumstances.\n\n193\n00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,860\n>> Yeah, so\nwhen we think about that budget,\n\n194\n00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,902\nwe wanna make sure we're not just\nthinking about the toys and gadgets.\n\n195\n00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:38,990\nWe've gotta think about the facilities,\nthe toys and gadgets, the software,\n\n196\n00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,400\nthe licensing for that,\nthe equipment, even just,\n\n197\n00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,280\nlike you say, in the office itself,\nthe chairs and things like that.\n\n198\n00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,280\nSo a lot goes into the setting\nup of that forensics lab.\n\n199\n00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,760\nSome of the stuff that we might\nnot have thought of initially, but\n\n200\n00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,910\nit's gotta be included in our budget.\n\n201\n00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,780\nAll right, so\n\n202\n00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,310\nwhat are some of the requirements\nthat we're gonna have to have?\n\n203\n00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,890\nWhat are some of the must haves, I guess?\n\n204\n00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,550\n>> The requirements,\nthey are gonna vary quite a bit but\n\n205\n00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,770\nsome of the core stuff of\ncourse is imaging equipment,\n\n206\n00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,270\nstuff to do memory dumps, you're gonna\nhave forensic workstations there.\n\n207\n00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,980\nYou need to have those.\n\n208\n00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,070\nSo, there's basics like that.\n\n209\n00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:26,100\nThe thing you wanna get on requirements\nthough is how far you're expected to go.\n\n210\n00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,770\nThat's probably the biggest\nthing you're gonna have is that.\n\n211\n00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,195\nAre you expected to do everything on site,\n\n212\n00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:34,905\nor are you gonna be able to\ndo some basic processing, and\n\n213\n00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:39,475\nthen hold it until it goes to, maybe,\nan outsourcer that gets further into it?\n\n214\n00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:41,135\nIt really gonna all depend, so\n\n215\n00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:44,065\nyou're gonna have to\ndetermine the types of cases.\n\n216\n00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:47,200\nIf you don't already know, you're gonna to\nhave to nail down the types of cases that\n\n217\n00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,580\nyou're gonna be expected to handle.\n\n218\n00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,632\nWhere your scope of authority is and\ncapabilities are, and\n\n219\n00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:54,010\nthen build accordingly to that.\n\n220\n00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,280\n>> So were doing strictly corporate or\nin house type of investigations.\n\n221\n00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,195\nThat might change, versus doing\nthose criminal investigations,\n\n222\n00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:05,235\nmight change the requirements for my\nroom or for my forensic lab if I have to\n\n223\n00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:08,345\nactually end up presenting this\nin court or something like that.\n\n224\n00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:09,465\n>> Oh yeah absolutely.\n\n225\n00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:15,043\nIt's all really gonna depend\non what you're expected to do.\n\n226\n00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:19,745\nNow you could even have\nsituations where you're in\n\n227\n00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:24,120\na regulated industry that also requires\nadditional things on top of that.\n\n228\n00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,900\nThey're not going to let you say, hey,\nI'm gonna just get this equipment.\n\n229\n00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,690\nThey're gonna say, no,\nyou're gonna have all this stuff.\n\n230\n00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,970\nWhether you like it or not, these are our\nrules, so you've gotta have this stuff.\n\n231\n00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,570\nSo that's a requirement that\ncould also impact other things.\n\n232\n00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,350\n>> Do we have to go as far as\nsay setting up almost like\n\n233\n00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,150\na clean room where we're wearing\nbunny suits and things like that?\n\n234\n00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,870\n>> Typically, no.\n\n235\n00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,837\nIt's not unheard of to have to\ndo something like that, but\n\n236\n00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,791\nit's It's not common.\n\n237\n00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,860\n>> Okay.\n\n238\n00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,640\nAll right, so we plan out our budget.\n\n239\n00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,225\nYou know we have to stop and think about\nhow much money do we really have to spend?\n\n240\n00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:02,210\nWe've gotta plan this\nout ahead of time right?\n\n241\n00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,270\nYou're gonna get together with all the\npeople, all the decision making people,\n\n242\n00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,860\nthe people that are in\ncharge of the money.\n\n243\n00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,080\nBring them all in, sit down,\ncome up with some kind of game plan, and\n\n244\n00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,550\nmake sure we're meeting those requirements\nfor whatever it is we plan to do.\n\n245\n00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,960\nWhether that's strictly corporate,\nor both corporate and\n\n246\n00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,150\ncriminal type investigations, or just\ncriminal, and whether or not we're taking\n\n247\n00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,620\nit to a certain point and then sending it\noff to somebody else for the rest of it.\n\n248\n00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,970\nWhat about our physical location?\n\n249\n00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,962\nThat's obviously gonna be part\nof our decision making process.\n\n250\n00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:36,260\n>> Yeah, the physical location\nis really one of the big ones.\n\n251\n00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,880\nYou look at the stuff that we have in IT,\n\n252\n00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,830\nif they're moving a help desk or\nIT people around, what normally happens?\n\n253\n00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,900\nWell, put some network hookups in there,\nif they're not already there and\n\n254\n00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,994\nmove all of our desks over.\n\n255\n00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:54,989\nAnd okay we're done, and\nthen whatever happens from there.\n\n256\n00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:01,940\nThat's the type of thinking we see with\nany office location for the most part.\n\n257\n00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,380\n>> Yeah, if I want to move an employee or\nsomebody, I just pick up their computer,\n\n258\n00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,040\ntake it somewhere else.\n\n259\n00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,195\nAs long as there's a wall jack\nthere I can plug them in.\n\n260\n00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:10,430\nCan't do that with our forensics lab.?\n\n261\n00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,630\n>> Yeah,\nit's a lot more complicated than that.\n\n262\n00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,600\nYes, you can move a forensics lab around\nlike that, but no matter where you move it\n\n263\n00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,740\nto, there are certain requirements\nthat you just need to have.\n\n264\n00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,690\nYou need to make sure that we\nhave good solid construction.\n\n265\n00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,830\nYou've gotta figure out if it's\ngoing to be freestanding or\n\n266\n00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,050\nif it's gonna be integrated\ninto a facility.\n\n267\n00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,200\nAnd then is that facility wholly\nowned by you as a company?\n\n268\n00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,720\nOr is it something that\nis a shared facility?\n\n269\n00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,886\nAnd if it's a shared facility, is your\nforensics lab gonna share wall space,\n\n270\n00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:44,900\nor share a wall with that other company?\n\n271\n00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,570\nBecause those all bring out concerns.\n\n272\n00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,870\nAnd that's just tip of the iceberg,\n\n273\n00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,400\nwe're gonna kinda delve into\nthe physical location just a bit more.\n\n274\n00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,762\nBut there's definitely a lot of things\nthat come into the physical location.\n\n275\n00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:02,663\nAnd you just can't say, hey,\nthat room, flip a coin,\n\n276\n00:15:02,663 --> 00:15:07,592\nit can't be that way,\nit's gonna be a lot more precise.\n\n277\n00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:10,240\nAnd you could be talking\nconsiderable amount of upgrades\n\n278\n00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,590\nwhen you pick a location.\n\n279\n00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,933\n>> So once, we wanna make sure we take\nour time in picking that location because\n\n280\n00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:20,087\nonce we do it it's gonna be a lot more\ndifficult to change in the future.\n\n281\n00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:25,380\n>> Yeah you could very well have a lot of\nthings that need to be done to that too.\n\n282\n00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,980\nIf you did need to move it, yeah,\nthat may be a very costly mistake.\n\n283\n00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,970\nAnd heck, if you really go all out on it,\nyou could have a situation where you\n\n284\n00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,185\nput so much effort and so much equipment\nin it that it would be prohibitive.\n\n285\n00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:43,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To move it, so.\n\n286\n00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,079\n>> The rest of the company is\nmoving to the other side of town,\n\n287\n00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,421\nthe forensics lab is staying here.\n\n288\n00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:48,225\n>> Yeah.\n\n289\n00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:51,134\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n290\n00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:54,403\nother things we need to think about when\nwe're setting up this forensics lab,\n\n291\n00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:56,098\nhuman resource requirements, right?\n\n292\n00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:56,888\nOur people.\n\n293\n00:15:56,888 --> 00:16:00,924\nYes, we haven't really mentioned\nthat too much is, as you know,\n\n294\n00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:04,120\nwhat the Human Resources\nsituation would be.\n\n295\n00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,720\nBut just to kind of touch upon it,\nit's not just the Forensic Technician\n\n296\n00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,430\ngoing it alone, there's gonna be\nother people involved on that team.\n\n297\n00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,540\nSo, who are those people?\n\n298\n00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,800\nWell, they're lawyers, there could be law\nenforcement personnel as part of that.\n\n299\n00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,580\nThere's gonna be someone that's gonna\nbe managing a team, if that's the case,\n\n300\n00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,560\nthere could be multiple\nforensic investigators.\n\n301\n00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,810\nAnd with different skills, there's just\na lot of people that could be involved.\n\n302\n00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,710\nAnd then, Human Resources\n\n303\n00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,680\nis gonna have to get involved because\nthey're gonna have to screen.\n\n304\n00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,690\nAnd vent these people.\n\n305\n00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,240\nAnd all that.\n\n306\n00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,670\nSo we've got a lot of things\nthat could be happening there.\n\n307\n00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,140\nSo there's one more thing you've got to\nlook at when you're setting up a lab.\n\n308\n00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,240\n>> Yeah, because they're like,\nsay for example, my cleaning crew.\n\n309\n00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,500\nIt's pretty easy to find a cleaning\ncrew to come in and clean my offices, or\n\n310\n00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,340\nsomething like that.\n\n311\n00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,520\nBut now all of a sudden,\n\n312\n00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,130\nI've got a forensics lab and\nthere's a lot more to think about.\n\n313\n00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,120\nAm I letting that cleaning crew in there?\n\n314\n00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,660\nThings like that.\n\n315\n00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,270\nSo we really got to pay attention to that.\n\n316\n00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,180\nAnd that's gonna change,\ncould change our hiring process.\n\n317\n00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,380\nOr maybe,\nwe have a separate staff that cleans that.\n\n318\n00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,670\nOr provi here can go in there and\nclean it, I suppose.\n\n319\n00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,240\nI don't know.\n[LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,625\n>> That's the initiation, man.\n\n321\n00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,390\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n322\n00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,110\nSo we've got human\nresource considerations.\n\n323\n00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,665\nEquipment would be another\nthing that we gotta\n\n324\n00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,330\nthink about when we're setting up our lab.\n\n325\n00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,570\n>> Oh yeah. [LAUGH] >> And I can't wait\nto get to that section, cuz you know me,\n\n326\n00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,375\nI like my toys.\n\n327\n00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:29,180\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of toys\n\n328\n00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,160\nthat we have and we're going to show\nsome images of the hardware you saw.\n\n329\n00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,310\nOne piece of hardware here\nthat's going to make it, so\n\n330\n00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,710\nyou've got to come back a little later.\n\n331\n00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:44,030\nYou saw stuff like that but there's\na lot of the other toys you can get,\n\n332\n00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,790\nif you wanna go all out on it.\n\n333\n00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,722\nWe were looking at that one this morning.\n\n334\n00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:50,770\n[LAUGH]\n>> WiebeTech HotPlug,\n\n335\n00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,648\nif you want to take a quick\nglance at that one.\n\n336\n00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:54,132\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n337\n00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:58,310\nthere's an endless sea of\nhardware toys out there.\n\n338\n00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:04,110\nAnd there's a probably even larger\nses of software toys out there.\n\n339\n00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,480\nSo, all those software packages and\n\n340\n00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,540\nhardware things, you're gonna have\nto decide what you actually need.\n\n341\n00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,980\nAnd we're gonna go through\na good number of them.\n\n342\n00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,800\nThere's no way we could go through\nall of them, it's just impossible.\n\n343\n00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,550\nAnd so, while we show you this things,\nkeep in mind, it's not limited to that.\n\n344\n00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,130\nYou're gonna have to do\nsome more investigation.\n\n345\n00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:32,810\nThe software are just the ones that I\nhave found that are gonna best represent.\n\n346\n00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,070\nAnd lend themselves to being demonstrated\nin an environment like this.\n\n347\n00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:43,920\nAnd the ones that you'll more likely have,\nthat you'll more likely have access to.\n\n348\n00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,704\nIt wouldn't make any sense for\nme to compare something like N-case,\n\n349\n00:18:46,704 --> 00:18:50,100\ncuz probably 90% of you aren't\ngonna have access to that.\n\n350\n00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,370\nBecause that is a very pricey software.\n\n351\n00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,010\n>> It is.\n\n352\n00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,140\nThat is some great software but they\nkeep it limited to the professionals by\n\n353\n00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,450\ntaking that price so out of range,\nI think, of a lot of us.\n\n354\n00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,440\nSo, we've got budgeting.\n\n355\n00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,370\nWe've got our requirements for\nour lab itself.\n\n356\n00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,520\nWe've got our physical location.\n\n357\n00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,730\nWe've got human resource considerations.\n\n358\n00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,410\nWe've got equipment that\nwe're going to talk about.\n\n359\n00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,400\nAnother thing that we're going to have to\nhit on, is communications requirements.\n\n360\n00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,910\n>> Yes.\n\n361\n00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:18,160\nThat is one I wanted to give\nit's own bullet item here,\n\n362\n00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,090\njust to kind of make you aware of it.\n\n363\n00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,760\nBecause you're gonna have the\ncommunication requirements we have means,\n\n364\n00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,070\nthat gonna have to have\nyour own secure lines,\n\n365\n00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,650\npresumably, for what your business is.\n\n366\n00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,790\nYou're also going to have stuff.\n\n367\n00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,720\nYou have to consider the fact that you\nmight be having meeting with people at\n\n368\n00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,520\nother locations.\n\n369\n00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,940\nSo that's a communication line\nyou've got to figure out.\n\n370\n00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,510\nHow you're gonna protect that.\n\n371\n00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,940\nSecure that.\n\n372\n00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,640\nWe also have a situation where\nwe have stuff in the lab.\n\n373\n00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,560\nAnd we also have the forensic\nwork stations in the lab.\n\n374\n00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,030\nPlus we have the work stations\nbecause people will have offices.\n\n375\n00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,190\nIn a lot of cases in that forensics lab,\nyour technicians have to take notes,\n\n376\n00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,840\nand respond to emails.\n\n377\n00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,110\nAnd carry out other business\nrelating to investigations but\n\n378\n00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,080\nnot the investigation itself.\n\n379\n00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,370\nIf that's the case,\n\n380\n00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,990\nwhich it will be, there's gonna be\na network that used for the other stuff.\n\n381\n00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,450\nAnd then, there's gonna be a network\nthat's used exclusively for\n\n382\n00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,080\nthe forensic end of things for the lab.\n\n383\n00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,660\nAnd they have to be isolated.\n\n384\n00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,060\n>> So in other words,\nI'm not gonna be checking my email or\n\n385\n00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,890\nordering products off Amazon\nfrom my forensics work station.\n\n386\n00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,400\nYou need a separate device.\n\n387\n00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,370\nA separate computer.\n\n388\n00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,130\nA separate network.\n\n389\n00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,150\nEverything separated out\nfrom my day-to-day business.\n\n390\n00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,320\nAnd keep that completely segregated\nfrom that forensics lab.\n\n391\n00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n392\n00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,020\n>> All right.\nSo lots of good things we're gonna\n\n393\n00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,660\ntalk about.\n\n394\n00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,280\nHope you guys are as excited as I am.\n\n395\n00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,100\nThis is gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n396\n00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,840\nSo, Sean, where do we start?\n\n397\n00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,120\nWe've talked about all the different\nthings we're gonna hit here in the show.\n\n398\n00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,790\nAnd let's go back over to budget,\nand start there.\n\n399\n00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,490\n>> Let's just give a talk just\n\n400\n00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,380\nquickly about budget because it's\nobviously not the most exciting topic.\n\n401\n00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,310\nBut there's only so\n\n402\n00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,000\nmuch we can do without having you\nguys pull out excel or something.\n\n403\n00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,240\nAnd start doing a line item, and all that.\n\n404\n00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,180\nAnd we're definitely not going to\n\n405\n00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,296\nmake this an accounting and budgeting\nclass, I know you're disappointed.\n\n406\n00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:16,993\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just relax.\n\n407\n00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:19,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Must add numbers.\n\n408\n00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:25,810\nSo I'm just going to, you know, give you\nsome things that could drive your budget.\n\n409\n00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,490\nAnd this is outside of\nthings like equipment.\n\n410\n00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,430\nThe hardware and software requirements.\n\n411\n00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,810\nAnd hiring people.\n\n412\n00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,530\nAnd making them better through training.\n\n413\n00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,120\nStuff like that.\n\n414\n00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,880\nThose are definitely something\nthat would be in your budget.\n\n415\n00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,970\nYou absolutely need to have those things.\n\n416\n00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,820\n>> A lot of those are standard\nbudget items that any business,\n\n417\n00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,555\nno matter what they're doing,\nare going to have to face.\n\n418\n00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:49,260\nI have equipment to do it.\n\n419\n00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,620\nWhatever the job is, or\nit just might be a little more fun.\n\n420\n00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,890\nOr a little more expensive.\n\n421\n00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,740\nWe're going to have personnel, we're\ngoing to pay them, so that makes sense.\n\n422\n00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,760\nWe've got office space,\nwe've got to pay for.\n\n423\n00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,976\nA lot of those are right along the same\nlines as doing any other type of business.\n\n424\n00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:06,400\n>> But, there are maybe some additional\nthings on top of that, like the training,\n\n425\n00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,070\nso we've gotta talk about\nthe training stuff.\n\n426\n00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,309\nOne of the things that is worth\nmentioning is Licensing Requirements.\n\n427\n00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,660\nYou have to have these things licensed\nin a good number of cases especially if\n\n428\n00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,210\nyou're doing certain\ntypes of investigations.\n\n429\n00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,730\nIt's mandatory that you get\na certain type of license.\n\n430\n00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,810\n>> When you say license, you're referring\nto the personnel being trained and\n\n431\n00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,320\nlicensed.\n\n432\n00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,284\nOr the lab itself being licensed as\nsome kind of investigation entity.\n\n433\n00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:35,886\n>> Yes.\n\n434\n00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:39,287\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, both.\n\n435\n00:22:39,287 --> 00:22:44,570\n[LAUGH]\n>> But it could be either, or both.\n\n436\n00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,600\nAnd depending on what those licensing\nrequirements say, it could very well,\n\n437\n00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,770\nit's going to be money that you\nhave to spend there to retain that.\n\n438\n00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:01,890\nAnd you may have a situation where\nthe organization takes care of the lab.\n\n439\n00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,670\nAnd the individuals take care of their own\nlicensing, you know that's not unheard of.\n\n440\n00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,230\n>> Kind of like contractors, maybe.\n\n441\n00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,670\n>> Yeah, could be contracting and\neven there's some cases where employees\n\n442\n00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,140\nare expected to do that on\ntheir own as part of the thing.\n\n443\n00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,090\nIt just really all depends on\nthe situation but you'll know.\n\n444\n00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:25,720\nAnd we'll know what the situation is,\nin your particular spot.\n\n445\n00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,170\nSo licensing will add\nsomething to the bottom line,\n\n446\n00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,770\nit's just a question of how much.\n\n447\n00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,671\nIf you're doing forensics for\nany specific industry,\n\n448\n00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:42,828\nthey're gonna dictate all\nthese things you gotta follow.\n\n449\n00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:46,477\nThey're also gonna dictate things like,\nhow many conferences and\n\n450\n00:23:46,477 --> 00:23:48,086\ntraining you have to attend.\n\n451\n00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:50,006\nTo keep your skills current.\n\n452\n00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:52,991\n>> Almost like a continuing\neducation type situation.\n\n453\n00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:57,154\n>> Yeah, they will implement something\nthat we are very familiar with a lot of\n\n454\n00:23:57,154 --> 00:23:58,951\nthe other credentials in here.\n\n455\n00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:00,310\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n456\n00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,550\n>> CEH has it, CISSP has it.\n\n457\n00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,150\nThe Comptia ones are getting them or\nhave them.\n\n458\n00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,690\nSo we've got, already got that credentials\nthat have those sorts of things.\n\n459\n00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,440\nIt's the same thing here.\n\n460\n00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,370\nBut some licensing outside of\nthe certifications that go on top of this,\n\n461\n00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,280\nthey also require you\nto attend conferences,\n\n462\n00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,900\nand specific types of training every\nyear or within a certain amount of time.\n\n463\n00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,090\nThey tell you these need to be done.\n\n464\n00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:36,120\nAnd if you don't, you could actually have\nyour license suspended until you do that.\n\n465\n00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,960\n>> Another reason for Don and\nTim to send me to Hak5 this year.\n\n466\n00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,795\n>> I'll write you a note man.\n\n467\n00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:44,330\n[LAUGH] I'll see everybody there.\n\n468\n00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,120\nI'm going.\nI'm gonna try to get there.\n\n469\n00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,530\nSo we gotta deal with licensing, both for\nour personnel, they've gotta be certified\n\n470\n00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,660\nmaybe in the software, the equipment,\nyou know, depending on what it is.\n\n471\n00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,740\nThe lab itself might have to be certified,\nespecially if we're doing some type of\n\n472\n00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,640\ncriminal investigation,\nthere might be certain certifications that\n\n473\n00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,670\nwe need to prove that our lab does meet\ncertain requirements by the courts.\n\n474\n00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,350\nAnd again, that's another thing\nthat's going to vary widely between\n\n475\n00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,090\ndifferent countries,\ndifferent regions even within countries.\n\n476\n00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,770\nSo make sure you're checking on\nwhatever your local requirements are.\n\n477\n00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,830\n>> That's awesome to throw in\nsomething on the licensing.\n\n478\n00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:21,360\nIt's not It's not specifically\na forensics license,\n\n479\n00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,980\nbut in some situations\nyou actually have to be\n\n480\n00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,400\nqualified as a private\ninvestigator to do that.\n\n481\n00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,720\nSo that's something outside of that\nyou have to do for some locations.\n\n482\n00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,640\nAnd I believe, I may be mistaken, but\n\n483\n00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,010\nI believe there's a couple\nstates that require it.\n\n484\n00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:41,870\nAnd then there's states even talking\nabout mandating a forensics,\n\n485\n00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,290\na standard for\nforensics personnel in the state.\n\n486\n00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:48,410\nThat you have to be licensed in that\nstate, not as a PI, but as a technician in\n\n487\n00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,810\nthat state, so they can be sure that\ncertain standards are being adhered to so,\n\n488\n00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:57,030\nthat's not across the board,\nbut it's expected.\n\n489\n00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,830\n>> So it's coming, probably.\n\n490\n00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,480\n>> Yeah.\n\n491\n00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,200\n>> I can see it now.\n\n492\n00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,440\nOriano, PI.\n\n493\n00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,395\n>> That's the TV show.\n\n494\n00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:07,990\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so, lots of\nthings to think about with licensing.\n\n495\n00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,700\nWe also have crime statistics\nin our budgeting section.\n\n496\n00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,920\nYeah, and the reason why crime statistics\nis being mentioned is, if you are running\n\n497\n00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,020\na forensics lab that's investigating\nany criminal cases as an outsourcer.\n\n498\n00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,530\nOr you're actually working for something\nlike that, working for a state or\n\n499\n00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,310\ngovernment agency that does that.\n\n500\n00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:35,650\nIn those situations when you're building\nyour budget you're gonna have to look\n\n501\n00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:40,750\nat crime statistics, number of cases you\ninvestigated, what you're investigating,\n\n502\n00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,070\nand what you see trending to figure out\nwhat your budget's gonna be coming up.\n\n503\n00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,420\n>> Oh so we can use this information\nto help us plan that budget then.\n\n504\n00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,470\n>> Yeah.\nGotcha.\n\n505\n00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,860\nVery good, very good.\n\n506\n00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,890\nAll right, and\nthen extend the forensics capabilities.\n\n507\n00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,250\nThat's basically what we\nwere talking about earlier.\n\n508\n00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,200\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n509\n00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,960\n>> What do we plan on doing?\n\n510\n00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,330\nWhat is our role gonna be, I guess.\n\n511\n00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,160\n>> Yeah.\nIt's that whole scope of authority.\n\n512\n00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,070\nAre you gonna be expected to\ninvestigate mobile devices?\n\n513\n00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,488\nOr are you expected to be,\n\n514\n00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:16,960\nto go out to a facility, and\nlike the equipment we were looking at.\n\n515\n00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,730\nBe able to have to grab that equipment and\nmove it back in, and\n\n516\n00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,350\nget one of those hot-plug devices or\nsomething, do you need that?\n\n517\n00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:30,981\nThose things, while nice to have may\nnot be something that you need, so.\n\n518\n00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:31,960\n>> Okay.\n\n519\n00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,900\nThere's a lot of things that are going\ninto deciding what our budget's gonna be,\n\n520\n00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,795\nor what we wanna ask for if we're\ninside a corporate corporation, or\n\n521\n00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:44,915\nwhat we need to plan on or borrow if\nwe're starting up an organization.\n\n522\n00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,965\nOr starting up our own company or\nsomething like that.\n\n523\n00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,035\nSo, a lot of different things.\n\n524\n00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:50,125\nSome of those which I probably\nwouldn't have thought of at first.\n\n525\n00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:53,065\nSo, gotta take all of\nthat into consideration.\n\n526\n00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:57,125\nAll right so let's say we're,\nactually we're running out of time,\n\n527\n00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,815\nso hold that thought.\n\n528\n00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:03,720\nWhen we come back, we're gonna move\non into location and facility but.\n\n529\n00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,240\nLooking at the clock.\n\n530\n00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,760\nIt's about time for\nus to take a quick break.\n\n531\n00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,206\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n532\n00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:08,343\nWe'll be right back.\n\n533\n00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:09,424\n>> Nice cliff hanger.\n\n534\n00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:15,740\n[MUSIC].\n\n535\n00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,525\nAll right.\n\n536\n00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:17,715\nWelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n537\n00:28:17,715 --> 00:28:21,465\nSo continuing on with our\ncomputer forensics lab.\n\n538\n00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:24,045\nThe next topic we wanna go into, and\nit'll break it down a little more,\n\n539\n00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:26,105\nis the location and facility.\n\n540\n00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,555\nRight?\nBecause one of the first things,\n\n541\n00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:31,695\nafter we've decided our budget and\nwe know how much we've got to spend and\n\n542\n00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:35,805\nwhere we can spend those dollars, and\nthen we have to pick a facility, right?\n\n543\n00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:38,800\n>> Yes,\nyou do have to get that facility going.\n\n544\n00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,310\nNow, we're gonna kinda talk about\nsomewhat generically, because\n\n545\n00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,770\nthis could be a case of where you have\nan existing place that your upgrading to.\n\n546\n00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:53,445\nYour forensics facility, or it could be a\nlocation that you are Selecting brand new.\n\n547\n00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:57,535\nIt really all depends on what's best for\nyou, but\n\n548\n00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,415\nyou do have to meet certain requirements,\nor\n\n549\n00:28:59,415 --> 00:29:04,925\ncertain things that are desirable to\nmake sure you have a good location.\n\n550\n00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:08,965\nSo, that's what we're looking\nat when we get into this.\n\n551\n00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:12,745\n>> So, if we're within a company, or\nsomething like that, they might tell us\n\n552\n00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:16,410\nyou've got to design something here\nin the building that we already own.\n\n553\n00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:20,220\nThat we had had for years and what have\nyou, or it might be a case of, wow,\n\n554\n00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,230\nwe got the budget, or\nyou're starting up your own company and\n\n555\n00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,620\nwe're gonna go find a facility that we\nwant to use to setup our forensics lab.\n\n556\n00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,340\n>> Yes, that's what we're looking at.\n\n557\n00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,250\nIt could be any of those situations,\nor even you know something else and\n\n558\n00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:39,110\nthere's always variations of themes so\nthat could be the situations as well.\n\n559\n00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,760\nSo we're going to have to\nfigure out what location.\n\n560\n00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,060\nMore than likely in most cases you're\nprobably gonna have an existing facility\n\n561\n00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,860\nthat needs to have some room in it\nupgraded to handle that forensic ability.\n\n562\n00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,560\nAnd that's fine.\n\n563\n00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,240\nThat's not something that's a bad thing.\n\n564\n00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,870\nIt just means that you know you have\nsome constraints to work within, and\n\n565\n00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:04,460\nyou'd better be aware of what needs\nto be there to see if the room they\n\n566\n00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,480\npoint you to is suitable, and if maybe\nanother room in that facility's better.\n\n567\n00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,380\n>> Yeah, and\n\n568\n00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,010\nwe've probably all dealt with situations\nlike that kind of in our own world.\n\n569\n00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,790\nI know like if you're building\na house from the ground up.\n\n570\n00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,280\nWell, I've got to go ahead and\nlay in my cat 6 cable or\n\n571\n00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,850\nfiber optics in the wall right\nbefore the sheet rock goes up.\n\n572\n00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,200\nNice and easy,\nI can think about where I want my porch,\n\n573\n00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,320\nwhere I'm putting my TV's,\nthings like that.\n\n574\n00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,230\nIf I bought a house, now I've got to go\nand do that after construction type thing\n\n575\n00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,740\nwhere I've got to go back and remodel it,\nand a lot more work involved, but\n\n576\n00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,640\nnot that it's undoable Just means\nmaybe a little more planning.\n\n577\n00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,450\nWe might have to change some of our,\n\n578\n00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,770\nmaybe we can't be as perfect as\nwe want but still do it right?\n\n579\n00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,050\nAnd probably the most common\nscenario as you said.\n\n580\n00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:51,160\n>> Yeah, someone's decided,\ntheir company's decided\n\n581\n00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,870\nthat they need to have this capability,\n>> They're choosing something at their own\n\n582\n00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:01,430\nlocation, chasing whoever the current\ntenant out of that room is and\n\n583\n00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,930\nputting you in there.\n\n584\n00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,010\nSo it's.\n\n585\n00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,890\nAnd for IT that sounds.\n\n586\n00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,510\nLike I said it's not\na uncommon situation for us.\n\n587\n00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,330\nIt's not a common situation.\n\n588\n00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,410\n>> And businesses anyway.\n\n589\n00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,300\n>> I know.\nWe've seen the server closets that\n\n590\n00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,680\nare in a stall in a bathroom.\n\n591\n00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,900\nI mean, IT does typically get\nthe shaft sometimes [LAUGH] when\n\n592\n00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,820\nit comes to that kind of thing.\n\n593\n00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,023\nBut the forensics lab we are gonna have to\nput our foot down and really make sure,\n\n594\n00:31:27,023 --> 00:31:29,214\nbecause\n>> There are a lot of requirements and\n\n595\n00:31:29,214 --> 00:31:32,635\nwe're doing a lot of things that\nhave special considerations and so\n\n596\n00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:36,415\nwe can't just put it in an extra room off\nto the side, or the old mop closet or\n\n597\n00:31:36,415 --> 00:31:37,506\nanything like that.\n\n598\n00:31:37,506 --> 00:31:38,447\n>> And they'll try.\n\n599\n00:31:38,447 --> 00:31:39,944\nThey'll definitely try and.\n\n600\n00:31:39,944 --> 00:31:41,152\nI've seen places that have done it.\n\n601\n00:31:41,152 --> 00:31:44,889\nAnd I hope you never have to go to court-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n602\n00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:46,471\n>> And someone takes a picture of your\n\n603\n00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,280\nfacility and goes, there you go.\n\n604\n00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,100\n>> That's all the Defense Attorney\nwould have to do, right?\n\n605\n00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,490\nHe'd just take a picture of your lab and\nshow the court.\n\n606\n00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,880\nAnd everybody goes, oh, yeah.\n\n607\n00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,540\nSo much.\n\n608\n00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,642\nThat looks like my kids' room.\n\n609\n00:31:57,642 --> 00:31:58,720\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n610\n00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,170\n>> So yeah, think about the location,\n\n611\n00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,840\nyou know, you're feeling out\nthe requirements already.\n\n612\n00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,480\nThink about what you're\ngonna have to do in there.\n\n613\n00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480\nAre you gonna have to upgrade the walls?\n\n614\n00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,420\nAre you gonna have to upgrade\nthe electrical system?\n\n615\n00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,470\nYou know, what type of communication\nstuff are you gonna have to run in there?\n\n616\n00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,440\nAll those things are gonna impact it,\nplus even more.\n\n617\n00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,527\nOne of the things that's also gonna be\nin there, is Fire Suppression Systems.\n\n618\n00:32:20,527 --> 00:32:24,744\n>> Fire Suppression, HVAC, things like\nthat, we've got to consider right.\n\n619\n00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:31,170\n>> So a lot of things going into picking\nthat location and then environmentally.\n\n620\n00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,640\nI was just mentioning,\nwe gotta have that HVAC.\n\n621\n00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,840\nAnd it might be that, it has to be\nseparate from the rest of the facilities\n\n622\n00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,670\nbecause we have to keep certain\nenvironmental conditions in that lab,\n\n623\n00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,210\nwhich might not be feasible to do for\nthe entire building.\n\n624\n00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,490\n>> Yes, that's at least part of it,\nis you might have to do that.\n\n625\n00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,240\nIt really all depends.\n\n626\n00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,450\nIt's not as big of a deal but\nit is something that factors in.\n\n627\n00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:01,210\nWhen we talk about environment for\na lab, one of the biggest things we have\n\n628\n00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,120\nthere is to consider the fact\nthat it's not unheard of.\n\n629\n00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,840\nFor a Forensics Lab, in fact it's\nusually a preferable location to put it,\n\n630\n00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,740\nis in the interior of the building.\n\n631\n00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,470\nThere's no windows or\nanything else into it,\n\n632\n00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,130\nso it kind of unofficially\nbecomes the bat cave.\n\n633\n00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,660\nIt's dark, it's all sealed in.\n\n634\n00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,650\nYou know, a lot of you, if not all of you,\nat some point in your career,\n\n635\n00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,680\nmaybe that's today, have been in a room\nwith no windows or anything else.\n\n636\n00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:34,806\nIt's like a dungeon and you really feel\nclaustrophobic, you know, after a while.\n\n637\n00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:39,420\nWell, with forensic people,it's\ngonna be the same thing.\n\n638\n00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,500\nAnd considering the pressure\nof what they're doing,\n\n639\n00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,890\nthe situation of what they're doing.\n\n640\n00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,400\nAnd that's their whole thing.\n\n641\n00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,890\nIt's a secured area,\nit's not gonna be in and out.\n\n642\n00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,710\nIt's gonna be the same team\nin there a lot of the time.\n\n643\n00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:55,590\nSo what you've got to consider is,\nwhat the overall.\n\n644\n00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,800\nYou know, they will say,\ninstead of environment,\n\n645\n00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,170\na lot of times it will change it to\nmake it a little more understandable.\n\n646\n00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:06,270\nWhat we're talking about, the ambiance\nin there, it becomes a living space.\n\n647\n00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,000\nIs really what's happening.\n\n648\n00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,020\nThat is a living space for\nall intents and purposes.\n\n649\n00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,400\nSo you need to consider that,\nin such a way that,\n\n650\n00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,740\nyou know, that hey,\npeople are going to be working there.\n\n651\n00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,250\nThey're going to be, you know,\ninteracting with a small group of people.\n\n652\n00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,470\nIt's probably going to have\na dungeon-like atmosphere if\n\n653\n00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:29,410\nyou don't take care to avoid that.\n\n654\n00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,990\nSo that, and when you look at it, in that\ncontext, it goes even beyond ventilation.\n\n655\n00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,777\nIt goes to lighting.\n\n656\n00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:39,610\nIt goes to circulation of air.\n\n657\n00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,460\nIt goes to, you know, things like\n\n658\n00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,600\nplants and\nhaving nice coffee meeting areas.\n\n659\n00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,335\nThings like that.\n\n660\n00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,420\nThat all goes in there.\n\n661\n00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,760\nAnd trying to make it as\ncomfortable as possibly can be,\n\n662\n00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,390\nto let them focus on what their doing and\nbe comfortable in their.\n\n663\n00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,850\nIt's something to think about.\n\n664\n00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,690\nYou're going to be upgrading this for\na lot of things forensically but\n\n665\n00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,230\nthere's also the personnel part of it too,\n\n666\n00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,500\nthat you have to make sure\nthat they are taken care of.\n\n667\n00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,250\n>> So when we say, we want it in\nan inside room where I've got no outside.\n\n668\n00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,590\nOr none of my walls are maybe, to\nthe exterior of the building which means,\n\n669\n00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,770\nI'm probably not gonna have windows,\nat least not windows to the outside,\n\n670\n00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,660\nthings like that.\n\n671\n00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,430\nWhat's the benefit or\nwhat's the thought process behind that?\n\n672\n00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,110\n>> Well, if you don't have\nany windows to the outside.\n\n673\n00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,840\nWell first of all,\nif you have a room on the exterior and\n\n674\n00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,690\nyou have a window to the outside.\n\n675\n00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:41,350\nNow you got to secure that, and then\nthere's a lot of things that go with that.\n\n676\n00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,450\nYou have to upgrade the window,\nthen you got to put alarms on it.\n\n677\n00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:50,800\nThen you gotta worry about the outside,\nstuff like,\n\n678\n00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,490\nbushes and trees, all that has to\nbe cleared out a certain distance.\n\n679\n00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:58,100\nThere's just a lot can go with that.\n\n680\n00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,280\nAnd then,\nyou still run the risk of someone,\n\n681\n00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,100\nmaybe, breaking in and\ntampering with something.\n\n682\n00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,550\nWith a window out there,\nit's just too easy to compromise that.\n\n683\n00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,710\nSo, without a lot of significant upgrades,\nit's too easy to compromise that.\n\n684\n00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,840\nSo while it sounds like well,\n\n685\n00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,170\njust move to the exterior to get\nsome natural light and all that in.\n\n686\n00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:22,390\nIt's usually better to find that interior\nroom and just invest the extra dollars in\n\n687\n00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:27,230\ngetting some nice incandescent lighting\nand get rid of fluorescent stuff.\n\n688\n00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,100\n>> Get him a monitor that has a beach\nscene that kind of loops on there or\n\n689\n00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,340\nsomething, and\nthey can feel like they're outside.\n\n690\n00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:38,360\n>> I have seen stuff like that, where\nthey put the LCD monitors on there that\n\n691\n00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:43,020\ndisplay type of scenes like that, to make\nthem feel like they're see to the outside.\n\n692\n00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,310\nI've seen stuff like that.\n\n693\n00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:49,330\nI've see this lighting that's kind\nof like mood lighting in there and\n\n694\n00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,990\ntheir offices are all real nice.\n\n695\n00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,680\nAnd got nice music playing.\n\n696\n00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,310\nAnd you got those nice couches\nin the media rooms and all that.\n\n697\n00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:00,950\nIt really looks kind of like,\nhey I'd love to work here.\n\n698\n00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,064\nI could crash here.\n\n699\n00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:03,770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I could move in here.\n\n700\n00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,700\nAnd they'll have like their own\nkitchens and stuff in there.\n\n701\n00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,020\nSeparate from everyone else.\n\n702\n00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:16,610\nSo they do that to make sure that, these\nguys can focus on what they need to and\n\n703\n00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,500\ntake away as much of\nthe stress that they have,\n\n704\n00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,290\nthat's gonna be involved in that position.\n\n705\n00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,470\n>> And so,\nby moving that room into the middle or\n\n706\n00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,380\nusing one that doesn't have\nany exterior facing walls.\n\n707\n00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,910\nWe're almost using the rest of\nour facility as a physical DMZ\n\n708\n00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,080\naround our room there.\n\n709\n00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,730\nBecause now,\nI've got an extra layer of security\n\n710\n00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:40,490\nbefore they ever make it\ninto that forensics room.\n\n711\n00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,750\n>> Yeah, you can look at it that way.\n\n712\n00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,450\nYou can definitely look at it\nthat way because they have to\n\n713\n00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,700\npenetrate the outer facility.\n\n714\n00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,110\nAnd then get into that,\nwhich is even a higher.\n\n715\n00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:52,500\nLittle security and there could be\na guard on the outside of the facility,\n\n716\n00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,570\nmanning the entry points for that.\n\n717\n00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:58,940\nAnd then, there could even be a guard\nin some cases on that room for\n\n718\n00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,850\ndoing forensics for the lab.\n\n719\n00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,520\nSo yeah, that would be exactly right.\n\n720\n00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,270\nYou have, even though,\nwe don't directly mention that,\n\n721\n00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,390\nhere it is, it acts as another layer.\n\n722\n00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,482\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n723\n00:38:14,482 --> 00:38:17,210\nAs of location wise,\nwe've got a lot to think about there.\n\n724\n00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,750\nEnvironment wise, I mean, we've already\nhit on a few different things, we've\n\n725\n00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:25,700\ntalked about, making sure that the room\nis the proper temperature and humidity.\n\n726\n00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,170\nAs well as environment for employees and\nfor the forensic investigators.\n\n727\n00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,710\nMaking sure that they're comfortable,\n\n728\n00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,920\nhave a good comfortable workspace cuz\nthat's gonna make them more productive.\n\n729\n00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,950\nAnd allow them to focus on\ntheir job without distractions.\n\n730\n00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,070\nAnd things like that.\n\n731\n00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:43,880\nElectrical needs, is another thing, we've\ngotta think about for our Forensic Lab.\n\n732\n00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,720\n>> Yes, indeed.\n\n733\n00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,640\nElectrical is a concern there.\n\n734\n00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,620\nWhat we're looking at for electrical,\nis making sure, first of all,\n\n735\n00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,590\nthe Electrical System can handle\neverything we're putting in there.\n\n736\n00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,370\nAnd I can attest to the fact, and\nI know there's probably a lot of you.\n\n737\n00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,420\nI'm sure you've seen it too, Mike,\nwhere they put equipment in a room.\n\n738\n00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,990\nIt's like oh there's outlets\nwe can plug all the stuff in.\n\n739\n00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,470\nNot enough outlets, plug some-\n>> Daisy chain some power strips.\n\n740\n00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,242\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's all okay,\n\n741\n00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:12,530\nthe Fire Marshall doesn't care\nabout that kind of thing.\n\n742\n00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,705\n>> Yeah.\nThere's no problem.\n\n743\n00:39:13,705 --> 00:39:15,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Every outlet is this new\n\n744\n00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,900\nsource of energy that comes from-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n745\n00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,660\n>> They look at that and\n\n746\n00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,560\n>> It's-\n\n747\n00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,500\n>> I love it when they add though.\n\n748\n00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,480\nThey'll have somebody come in.\n\n749\n00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,060\nAnd they'll put extra outlets on the wall.\n\n750\n00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,590\nIt's like, oh, I've got plenty of outlets,\n\n751\n00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,402\nbut they all tie back to\nthe same damn breaker.\n\n752\n00:39:28,402 --> 00:39:30,650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's like, wait a second here.\n\n753\n00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,506\nWe're gonna have to split this off or\nsomething, so.\n\n754\n00:39:33,506 --> 00:39:35,851\nAnd yes, Mountain Dew cup holders,\nDavid, is.\n\n755\n00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:39,148\nThis is definitely a must,\nat least at my desk, and\n\n756\n00:39:39,148 --> 00:39:42,460\nI think that most of my\ncoworkers would enjoy that.\n\n757\n00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,442\n>> We were thinking an IV.\n\n758\n00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:46,720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we need good electricity.\n\n759\n00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,960\nWe need, one, we need enough\nelectricity to power all the equipment.\n\n760\n00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,750\nAnd we've got to make sure we've\ngot a little bit extra, right?\n\n761\n00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,880\nBecause we never know what we're going to\nbe plugging in when we bring things back\n\n762\n00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,820\nfrom our crime scene, if we have\nto go out and bring things back.\n\n763\n00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,720\nAlso probably, the power itself needs\nto be clean and things like that.\n\n764\n00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,670\nWe don't want any sags or spikes.\n\n765\n00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,510\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n766\n00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,336\nRight on with that is,\nyou have that power conditioning.\n\n767\n00:40:11,336 --> 00:40:16,665\nThere has to be uninterruptible\npower supplies in there.\n\n768\n00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,825\nSo you're looking at that.\n\n769\n00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:21,565\nAnd you may even in some cases,\n\n770\n00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:27,350\nI've seen it where that whole facility\nhas its own circuit, its own breakers.\n\n771\n00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,310\nThat's isolated from everything else,\njust in case a power disruption or\n\n772\n00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,970\nanything hits the rest of the facility.\n\n773\n00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,690\nIt doesn't impact the forensics area.\n\n774\n00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:40,510\n>> Yeah, cuz the last thing you want is to\nbe in the middle of, say, a drive image or\n\n775\n00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,110\nsomething like that, or a memory dump.\n\n776\n00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,010\nAnd all of a sudden, a power flicker\noccurs or the power goes out in\n\n777\n00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,580\nthe middle of that operation,\nand you could very well corrupt.\n\n778\n00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,960\nYou're trying to make your safe\ncopy that you can work with, and\n\n779\n00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,560\nall of a sudden you've had\na power failure middle of that.\n\n780\n00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,300\nNow, what do you do?\n\n781\n00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,330\nYou're kind of SOL at that point.\n\n782\n00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,730\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n783\n00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,810\nIt's just a safety net to have.\n\n784\n00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,830\nAlso, James mentions a good one also,\nlightning arresters,\n\n785\n00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:07,260\nif you've got that being a concern,\nthen yeah.\n\n786\n00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:07,820\n>> Absolutely.\n\n787\n00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:12,152\nI know here in Florida and in many\nplaces where lightning's a big concern,\n\n788\n00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:16,368\nso I've gotta make sure we can handle\nthose surges and things like that.\n\n789\n00:41:16,368 --> 00:41:22,081\n>> And that's a good one that James\nhere's also bringing up, shielding.\n\n790\n00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:26,610\nYeah, that's a great comment, James.\n\n791\n00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,760\nWhat about shielding?\n\n792\n00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,190\nYeah, in a lot of these labs,\nthey'll also put in.\n\n793\n00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,750\nWhen they upgrade the outer walls,\n\n794\n00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:39,798\none of the things to look at is\ncan we install a faraday cage,\n\n795\n00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:43,385\nsomething to make it a dead zone.\n\n796\n00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:45,445\nSo people can't see that.\n\n797\n00:41:45,445 --> 00:41:48,105\nSo yeah, that's right on.\n\n798\n00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,415\nSo good catch there.\n\n799\n00:41:50,415 --> 00:41:51,100\n>> Very good.\n\n800\n00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,470\nAll right.\nSo we've got our location,\n\n801\n00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,070\nour environment we've gotta worry about.\n\n802\n00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:57,290\nWe got electricity,\nour electrical needs have to be met.\n\n803\n00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,960\nAnd then, some of this equipment\nI guess can draw a lot of\n\n804\n00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,720\npower depending on what it is.\n\n805\n00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,760\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> So we've\n\n806\n00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,660\ngotta make sure we're covered there,\nand again we've got room to spare.\n\n807\n00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,460\nWe're not blowing any fuses every\ntime we plug something else in.\n\n808\n00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:11,130\nMeeting space is another thing\nthat we've got to think about.\n\n809\n00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:14,810\n>> Yeah, it is going to have to\nhave it's own meeting space.\n\n810\n00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,020\nAnd you don't have to think about\nit too hard to think about why.\n\n811\n00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,220\nWhat they're discussing,\nthey need their own meeting space.\n\n812\n00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,680\nSo, not really much\nmore to say about that.\n\n813\n00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,560\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n814\n00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,360\nWe don't want to have people, if we need\nsomeone to come in, the higher ups in\n\n815\n00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,680\nthe corporation, or investigators or\nwhoever we're working with on a thing.\n\n816\n00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,230\nWe're not gonna have them come in and\nsit in one of our lab stools,\n\n817\n00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,150\nand be resting or anything like that.\n\n818\n00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,080\nWe want a nice, comfortable meeting space\nwhere we can talk about what it is, or\n\n819\n00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,340\ngenerally talk about reports and\nthings like that.\n\n820\n00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,650\nSo comfy couches, always a plus.\n\n821\n00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,980\nAlways a plus.\n\n822\n00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,622\nPlus, when it's nap time,\nI gotta have somewhere to go, right?\n\n823\n00:42:49,622 --> 00:42:50,437\n>> Oh, totally.\n>> Gotta have somewhere to go.\n\n824\n00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:53,361\n[LAUGH] And I know you got your little\nhippo that, when you squeeze, it farts.\n\n825\n00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:54,507\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n826\n00:42:54,507 --> 00:42:58,894\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] To refer back to our\n\n827\n00:42:58,894 --> 00:43:03,240\nNCIS theme we had going\nhere on the other episode.\n\n828\n00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,390\nSo meeting space important.\n\n829\n00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,730\nComfortable, I think we\nkinda covered that as well.\n\n830\n00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,220\nWe want it to be comfortable.\n\n831\n00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,370\nBoth the meeting space, and\nnot just the meeting space though, right?\n\n832\n00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:14,460\nOur lab as well because you\ncould be spending hours in here\n\n833\n00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,670\ndoing this forensics work.\n\n834\n00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,660\nRemember, it's not something\nthat you just start up,\n\n835\n00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,615\nwalk away, or do it for\nten minutes and you're done.\n\n836\n00:43:20,615 --> 00:43:23,555\nA lot of this is very time consuming,\nvery tedious work.\n\n837\n00:43:23,555 --> 00:43:27,165\nSo I wanna make sure I'm\ncomfortable working.\n\n838\n00:43:27,165 --> 00:43:29,325\nAre you a big ergonomics kinda guy?\n\n839\n00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:33,394\nDo you like sitting on the bouncy ball or\nthe fancy chairs that have you all bent in\n\n840\n00:43:33,394 --> 00:43:36,208\nthese different positions so\nyou can be comfortable?\n\n841\n00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:40,803\n>> Yeah, it's good that you\nbring that up because that's\n\n842\n00:43:40,803 --> 00:43:45,320\nsomething that is huge here\nis the ergonomics factor.\n\n843\n00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:50,730\nEverything, the way people\ninteract with the stations.\n\n844\n00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,160\nDo you wanna have the normal\nheight desks where they're kind of\n\n845\n00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,880\nhunching over doing stuff cuz that's not\ngreat in your lower back, and all that?\n\n846\n00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,910\nSo standing desks are another good one,\nor adjustable ones.\n\n847\n00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:06,990\nThat's starting to pop\nup in a lot of places.\n\n848\n00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:10,710\n>> We've got one of our higher ups here\nactually has one of those mechanical,\n\n849\n00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,700\nwith the moving desks.\n\n850\n00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,440\nSo hydraulically,\nhe can sit there and hit a button.\n\n851\n00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,520\nActually, I don't think it's hydraulics,\nbut the whole desk raises up, and\n\n852\n00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,670\nhe can stand up.\n\n853\n00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,760\nAnd then, he wants to sit down,\nhe can just hit a button,\n\n854\n00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,240\nand that thing lowers down.\n\n855\n00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,113\nIn fact, Rob, our design guy's\nback there on a stand-up desk.\n\n856\n00:44:27,113 --> 00:44:30,780\nSo, a very common thing we're seeing is\nthat we're learning that after years of\n\n857\n00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,770\nforcing people to sit at a normal desk,\n\n858\n00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:37,100\nin one of these little rolling chairs,\nand work at a computer screen.\n\n859\n00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,250\nThat that's not ideal for\nthe human body and\n\n860\n00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,130\nit puts stress on your body,\nwhich then makes you uncomfortable.\n\n861\n00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,320\nYou get aches and pains,\nyou don't sleep well.\n\n862\n00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,480\nYou're not as productive.\n\n863\n00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,760\nIt just leads to all kinds of things,\nand it's a pretty simple fix.\n\n864\n00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,550\nGetting the right kind of chairs,\n\n865\n00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:54,820\ngetting soft mats to stand on\nif you're at a lab counter.\n\n866\n00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,000\nRaising monitors up so\n\n867\n00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,650\nthey're more at eye level,\nthan having to look down at something.\n\n868\n00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:04,210\nAll these little things can make your\nwork environment a lot more enjoyable.\n\n869\n00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,640\nAnd you can be more productive.\n\n870\n00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,790\n>> Yeah, I can attest to\nthe fact with the standing desks.\n\n871\n00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,990\nI just upgraded my desk at home to that.\n\n872\n00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:12,680\n>> Did you?\n\n873\n00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,730\n>> Yeah, I spent the extra money and\nsaid, you know what?\n\n874\n00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:19,170\nI can spend the money now on\nthis which is little expensive.\n\n875\n00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,830\nBut, what's more expensive\nbuying the desk or\n\n876\n00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,570\nhaving to have my back worked on and\nall that stuff.\n\n877\n00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,681\n>> Paying a chiropractor, yeah.\n\n878\n00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:29,984\n[LAUGH]\n>> And I noticed almost immediately from\n\n879\n00:45:29,984 --> 00:45:35,500\nusing something like that that my back\nstarted feeling a little less stiff.\n\n880\n00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,910\nI don't have chronic back problems or\nanything.\n\n881\n00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,760\nBut, I started noticing that felt better.\n\n882\n00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,410\nI noticed I had more energy.\n\n883\n00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:46,900\nI noticed that I was more\nalert when I was doing things.\n\n884\n00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,840\nSo, it's great.\n\n885\n00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,920\nAnd the thing is,\nif you get these standing desks,\n\n886\n00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,450\nyou can get the ones that are adjustable.\n\n887\n00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,980\nMine has four.\n\n888\n00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:59,140\nFor presets in it that I can set where I\nwant and just hit the button and it moves.\n\n889\n00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,560\n>> So if you're on your bouncy chair,\nyou've got the perfect level for that.\n\n890\n00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,100\nIf you wanna stand up that day,\nyou got the perfect level for that.\n\n891\n00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,020\nIf you want a stool that day,\nso nice, nice.\n\n892\n00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,130\nYou're gonna spend a little more money\non some of those ergonomic furniture and\n\n893\n00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,710\nthings like that, but in the end,\nprobably worth it to keep you or\n\n894\n00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,580\nyour employees healthy,\nproductive, out of the hospital.\n\n895\n00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,430\nAway from the chiropractors and\nthings like that.\n\n896\n00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:23,470\n>> I'll tell you,\none of the things I admit.\n\n897\n00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:27,970\nAnd I know,\nit's a little childish or whatever,\n\n898\n00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,300\nI don't know, but I still love it.\n\n899\n00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,940\nI'm doing it at home,\n\n900\n00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,955\nI set my desk all the way to the bottom\nafter I'm done working for the day.\n\n901\n00:46:34,955 --> 00:46:38,295\nSo every morning,\nbecause they start standing up.\n\n902\n00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:42,877\nI can hit the button to move up and\nthey go [NOISE] and do that, I love that.\n\n903\n00:46:42,877 --> 00:46:46,427\n>> So, you don't leave it at that level,\nyou lower it down every day.\n\n904\n00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:48,996\nSo in the morning you can come in and go\n>> Time to go to work.\n\n905\n00:46:48,996 --> 00:46:50,061\n[SOUND]\n>> Yeah.\n\n906\n00:46:50,061 --> 00:46:51,614\nRise.\n\n907\n00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:53,635\n>> [LAUGH] Come to me.\n\n908\n00:46:53,635 --> 00:46:56,710\n>> [LAUGH] Work must commence.\n\n909\n00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:00,970\n>> See, it makes you healthier and\nit's more fun.\n\n910\n00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,538\nI mean, you can't go wrong with that.\n\n911\n00:47:02,538 --> 00:47:04,100\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n912\n00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,700\nSo you gotta be comfortable.\n\n913\n00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,500\nAnother big part of our location and\n\n914\n00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,260\nfacility is gonna be evidence lockers,\nright?\n\n915\n00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:10,960\n>> Yes.\n\n916\n00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,380\nThat did get alluded to yesterday, is\nthat you gotta have stuff to lock it up.\n\n917\n00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,670\nYou can't just have a forensics room and\nsay, okay.\n\n918\n00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,370\nWell, it's secure from the outside,\nso just leave all the stuff.\n\n919\n00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:24,160\n>> No,\nyou are still mixing different cases.\n\n920\n00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,498\nYou're not gonna have just\none case in there, usually.\n\n921\n00:47:27,498 --> 00:47:32,078\nSo what you're gonna have to do is\nhave either an evidence that has\n\n922\n00:47:32,078 --> 00:47:33,843\nevidence lockers in it.\n\n923\n00:47:33,843 --> 00:47:35,896\nOr something similar.\n\n924\n00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:39,977\nAnd if the lab's big enough,\nyou will have an evidence room that has\n\n925\n00:47:39,977 --> 00:47:44,710\nindividual lockers, and they are assigned\nto people randomly per case.\n\n926\n00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:48,740\nAnd they have access to it by themselves,\nand\n\n927\n00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,530\nthen also, the person that runs\nthe room has access to it.\n\n928\n00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,110\nAnd it's as simple as that.\n\n929\n00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,570\nSo you will need to have that.\n\n930\n00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,850\n>> Yeah, if you're in a larger environment\nyou might be working on multiple cases and\n\n931\n00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,690\nyou have one person that's\nbeen assigned to this case.\n\n932\n00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,766\nYou don't want other people\naccidentally or intentionally,\n\n933\n00:48:06,766 --> 00:48:10,486\nmaliciously, getting the wrong evidence\nand trying to get access to that.\n\n934\n00:48:10,486 --> 00:48:13,347\nI can't just leave it laying on my desk\nand walk away, I mean, I signed for\n\n935\n00:48:13,347 --> 00:48:13,959\nthat, right?\n\n936\n00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:19,030\nI'm on that chain of custody, I'm\nresponsible for that piece of evidence.\n\n937\n00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,530\nI'm not gonna leave it on my\ndesk while I go to lunch.\n\n938\n00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:25,020\nI need to put that somewhere\nwhere it's secure.\n\n939\n00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,480\nSo the facilities itself,\nthe lab is secure, but\n\n940\n00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,240\nI need to make sure that the evidence is\none more layer of security, for that.\n\n941\n00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,340\nSo we need those lockers.\n\n942\n00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,270\nWhether it's a room that's\ndedicated to storing evidence and\n\n943\n00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,800\nyou've got somebody in charge\nof checking in and checking out.\n\n944\n00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,340\nLike you see that sometimes,\nwhere I have to go down to the clerk and\n\n945\n00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,010\nsay I wanna check out this\nparticular piece of evidence.\n\n946\n00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:49,500\nOr it could be individual lockers\nlike the old gym lockers,\n\n947\n00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,720\nwhere each case gets assigned a locker or\nsomething like that.\n\n948\n00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,730\nGotta have our evidence lockers.\n\n949\n00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,980\nAnd then we gotta worry about what we\ndo with this when we're done, right?\n\n950\n00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,750\nBecause we talked about it\nin our episode yesterday.\n\n951\n00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:05,150\nDepending on what it is,\nsometimes that evidence\n\n952\n00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:09,760\ngets returned back to the original owner,\nsometimes it remains secured for\n\n953\n00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,400\nfuture use, and\nthen other times it's gotta be destroyed.\n\n954\n00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,580\n>> Yes, depending on the situation,\n\n955\n00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,510\nyes you do have stuff that\nneeds to be destroyed.\n\n956\n00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:22,690\nIt could be hardware itself, so\nyou may need that type of equipment.\n\n957\n00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:27,930\nOr it may just be paperwork and\nyou could choose to have a secure,\n\n958\n00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:32,220\none of those secure outsourcers that's\ngot the locked thing that you drop it in.\n\n959\n00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,980\nYou could do one of those, or\nyou could have the shredders in there.\n\n960\n00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:39,240\nIt just has to be something to make sure\nit doesn't fall into anyone else's hands.\n\n961\n00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,570\nSo that's what we're talking about there,\n\n962\n00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:46,710\nis having a way get rid of things that,\nfor example,\n\n963\n00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:50,330\ncan't be returned to somebody, you were\ntalking about identity theft stuff.\n\n964\n00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:55,300\nWell if we were going to shred\nthe paperwork and the drives at the end,\n\n965\n00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,595\nwe've got to have that equipment for it.\n\n966\n00:49:56,595 --> 00:49:57,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n967\n00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:00,040\n>> So just something to be aware of.\n\n968\n00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,470\n>> I still love going and watching the\nhard drive shredders in action, go out and\n\n969\n00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,890\ndo a YouTube video search\non a hard drive shredders.\n\n970\n00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,560\nIt's just fun to watch.\n\n971\n00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,380\n[LAUGH] To see that drive\njust mangled into bits, and\n\n972\n00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,841\nit's never gonna get any data off there.\n\n973\n00:50:12,841 --> 00:50:15,144\n[LAUGH] But yeah,\ndifferent ways you could have like,\n\n974\n00:50:15,144 --> 00:50:17,050\nI know in our facility\nhere we pay a company.\n\n975\n00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:21,050\nWe have a locked trash can that we put\nanything that's sensitive in there.\n\n976\n00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,880\nAnd then, they come every so\noften, pick up that trash can, and\n\n977\n00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,010\nshred it here on site in their truck\nwhere we can watch them shred it.\n\n978\n00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,580\nTo make sure that they're\nnot taking it somewhere and\n\n979\n00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,510\nselling it to somebody or\njust dumping it in the normal dump.\n\n980\n00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,050\nYou might have your own incinerators,\nor your own drive shredders,\n\n981\n00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:38,920\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n982\n00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,710\nGotta have some way to securely\ndestroy that evidence.\n\n983\n00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,780\nAll right, well I'll tell you what,\nladies and gentlemen, it's about time for\n\n984\n00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,910\nus to take a break so\nwe're gonna stop here.\n\n985\n00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:52,574\nWe come back, we're gonna continue\non with our computer forensics lab,\n\n986\n00:50:52,574 --> 00:50:54,655\nwe're gonna dive into communications.\n\n987\n00:50:54,655 --> 00:50:56,698\nSo stay tuned we'll be right back.\n\n988\n00:50:56,698 --> 00:51:02,157\n[MUSIC]\n\n989\n00:51:02,157 --> 00:51:06,104\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n990\n00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,278\nSo next on the list for\n\n991\n00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:10,550\nour computer forensics lab is\ngoing to be communications.\n\n992\n00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:14,380\nWe're gonna talk about some of our\nneeds and things we gotta consider\n\n993\n00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,690\nwhen we're laying out this lab, or\nremodeling for, to build a lab.\n\n994\n00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,170\nWe've got to deal with\nour communications lines.\n\n995\n00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,340\nAnd several different types of lines\nwe've got to deal with as well.\n\n996\n00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,110\nRight?\n\n997\n00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,230\n>> Yes.\n\n998\n00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,170\nAnd we kind of touched on this a bit.\n\n999\n00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:32,480\nIn kind of our intro segment in this,\nthat yeah,\n\n1000\n00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,610\nthat's, this lab needs to have,\nit has its own communication requirements.\n\n1001\n00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:42,952\nThat means it's gonna have to have its own\nphone system or a secured phone system.\n\n1002\n00:51:42,952 --> 00:51:48,400\nIt's gonna need to have its\nown networks setup as needed,\n\n1003\n00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,270\nand we know we have at least\ntwo networks in there.\n\n1004\n00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:56,750\nIt's gonna be at least that, because we're\ngonna have the network for the lab and\n\n1005\n00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:01,240\nthe network for daily use, for\nbusiness operations, to support it.\n\n1006\n00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:07,020\nAnd to go with that, just in case you\nhaven't kind of picked up on this yet,\n\n1007\n00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,650\nis that you've got\nthe forensic end of the house,\n\n1008\n00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:12,990\nwhere the forensic workstations\ngot their own network, and\n\n1009\n00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:16,700\nthen everyone has their regular\nworkstations where they do their business.\n\n1010\n00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,720\nSo that's the two different\ntypes of networks.\n\n1011\n00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,410\nThere's no situation,\nlike you're alluding to Mike,\n\n1012\n00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:27,210\nthere's no situation where someone's\nusing a forensics workstation for both.\n\n1013\n00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,880\nIf you do that, that's gonna be\na huge problem down the road.\n\n1014\n00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,190\n>> In fact some of our forensics\nworkstations might not even have Internet\n\n1015\n00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:34,750\naccess, right.\n\n1016\n00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,390\nI mean this is a segregated\npart of the network that's\n\n1017\n00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,680\ncompletely chopped off\non the outside world.\n\n1018\n00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,490\n>> It would not be unlikely for\n\n1019\n00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:48,280\nthem to have them completely\nclipped off from the outside world.\n\n1020\n00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:54,440\nThat would be a very good idea\nunless you had a very specific case.\n\n1021\n00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,560\nThen it's probably going to be isolated.\n\n1022\n00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,600\nI can't really think of a ton of\nsituations where you would wanna have that\n\n1023\n00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,850\nas being the default.\n\n1024\n00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:06,092\n>> All right, so we've got to worry about\nour phone lines, we've gotta make sure\n\n1025\n00:53:06,092 --> 00:53:09,009\nthat those are, obviously, we've got\nto communicate with the outside world.\n\n1026\n00:53:10,222 --> 00:53:14,190\nWe have got to have, a fax is something\nelse maybe, that we might need.\n\n1027\n00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,875\nI know we don't see them much anymore.\n\n1028\n00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:16,617\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n1029\n00:53:16,617 --> 00:53:20,100\nif we need a hardcopy\nof a file sent to us.\n\n1030\n00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,720\n>> Oh my God, yeah.\n\n1031\n00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,880\nThat is, I can't.\n\n1032\n00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,130\nI can't tell you how many times, when you\ntalk about something like this and say,\n\n1033\n00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:30,660\nthere has to be a fax machine there.\n\n1034\n00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,830\nWhat?\nPeople look like they're horrified.\n\n1035\n00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,440\nLike, what are you doing?\n\n1036\n00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,650\nNow it's like they question\nyour abilities and all that.\n\n1037\n00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,840\nIt's like, well they've got a fax machine.\n\n1038\n00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,030\nYeah, whatever.\n\n1039\n00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,365\nAnd I've also got my pager\nclip on to my belt [CROSSTALK]\n\n1040\n00:53:45,365 --> 00:53:45,897\n>> Yeah,\n\n1041\n00:53:45,897 --> 00:53:49,570\nmight as well just go\nthe whole nine on that.\n\n1042\n00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:52,980\nYou'll hear about that type of situation,\nbut\n\n1043\n00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,156\nthe way the world really works\nis that there still is a lot of\n\n1044\n00:53:57,156 --> 00:54:02,250\nfax machines out there,\nthere are a ton of fax machines out there.\n\n1045\n00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:06,379\nAnd, if you happen to ever have to\ninteract with the federal government,\n\n1046\n00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:08,520\nthey've got them all over the place.\n\n1047\n00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,860\n>> They're big on faxing in.\n\n1048\n00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,490\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1049\n00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:16,160\nIt's, you're not getting around it, and\nwe're not talking eFax stuff, either.\n\n1050\n00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:22,130\nWe're talking, we're literally talking,\nreal, physical fax machine.\n\n1051\n00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,080\n>> Phone line dedicated\nto the fax machine,\n\n1052\n00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,610\na physical device that sits there,\nreceives that call,\n\n1053\n00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:29,490\nyou get to listen to the great sounds\nthat they make, things like that.\n\n1054\n00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,800\nAnd then spits out that hard copy.\n\n1055\n00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,530\nAnd so like we said, we can make fun\nof it, we can say who uses fax anymore?\n\n1056\n00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:39,500\nBut you've gotta be ready to\nhandle that in case somebody does.\n\n1057\n00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,421\n>> Yeah you may, if you're working\na criminal case you may have to talk\n\n1058\n00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:44,983\nto another agency and\nthe other agency is gonna have to say,\n\n1059\n00:54:44,983 --> 00:54:47,150\nwell, I'm gonna fax you\nover this information.\n\n1060\n00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:54,880\nJust as a side thing this,\nto build on it a bit, government\n\n1061\n00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,870\nagencies, a lot of them, if you say,\nyeah here's my fax number.\n\n1062\n00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:04,730\nIf you happen to mention at any\npoint that that's an electronic fax,\n\n1063\n00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:07,530\nthey will not send it to you.\n\n1064\n00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,310\nI know, for example, the IRS,\n\n1065\n00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:14,290\nyou ask them to fax you a record,\nthey're willing to do that.\n\n1066\n00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:19,440\nI've had it from personal experience where\nI had them have to fax me some paperwork,\n\n1067\n00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:25,130\nand after they had faxed it, says, oh,\nyeah, I've got it right here in my email.\n\n1068\n00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,848\nAnd the lady was,\ndid I send you electronic fax?\n\n1069\n00:55:27,848 --> 00:55:33,802\nShe's like, and yeah,\nshe made that nervous laugh on it.\n\n1070\n00:55:33,802 --> 00:55:35,693\nAnd I made sure I told her, I says, hey,\n\n1071\n00:55:35,693 --> 00:55:38,656\nI didn't tell you that Cuz I knew\nthey were recording the call.\n\n1072\n00:55:38,656 --> 00:55:40,680\nOkay, I didn't tell you\nthat until after the fact.\n\n1073\n00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,474\nBut that's-\n>> That's a security risk involved, right?\n\n1074\n00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:45,030\nBecause now all of a sudden,\n\n1075\n00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,640\nwe're using some third-party service\nthat we're bouncing this fax off of,\n\n1076\n00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,920\nthere could very well be\na copy left on their servers.\n\n1077\n00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,520\nThings like that.\n\n1078\n00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,055\nChances for other people to intercept it.\n\n1079\n00:55:53,055 --> 00:55:55,490\nWe don't know what kind of\nsecurity they're handling.\n\n1080\n00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:56,900\nSo with that dedicated fax line,\n\n1081\n00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,060\nwe know that it's going\nfrom source to destination.\n\n1082\n00:55:59,060 --> 00:55:59,730\nIt's a phone call.\n\n1083\n00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:03,090\nIt's a point to point connection\nthat is gonna be more difficult for\n\n1084\n00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,425\nsomebody to try to get in the middle of.\n\n1085\n00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:08,160\nWhereas, if I send it to and E-Service,\nnow I'm going onto the internet, right?\n\n1086\n00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,670\nAnd so, I've got all kinds\nof security concerns there.\n\n1087\n00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:12,940\nSo faxes are still used.\n\n1088\n00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,610\nAnd in some of these smaller places,\nwe think about here,\n\n1089\n00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,630\nwe've got the big Biz Hub.\n\n1090\n00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:21,420\nWhere I can go and scan that document,\nand then email that off or what have you.\n\n1091\n00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,310\nNot everybody has that capability.\n\n1092\n00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,430\nThose are expensive.\n\n1093\n00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,350\nYou gotta have the room for\nthem, what have you.\n\n1094\n00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:31,540\nWhereas, a simple fax machine is a matter\nof having a phone line installed,\n\n1095\n00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,890\nwhich I've probably already\ngot at whatever location I am.\n\n1096\n00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,780\n>> Yep.\n>> And a physical device that I sit on my\n\n1097\n00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,930\ndesk, and it's not that expensive.\n\n1098\n00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:40,720\nSo while we laugh at it\nbeing an older technology,\n\n1099\n00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,220\nthere's some advantages\nto the faxing of things.\n\n1100\n00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,250\n>> Yeah, so count on having one of\nthose or being prepared to have one.\n\n1101\n00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,760\nIt's a simple investment, and\n\n1102\n00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,400\nit's something that you're just gonna\nneed to have for faxing record.\n\n1103\n00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,390\nLike I said, especially if you're\nworking with law enforcement,\n\n1104\n00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,590\nfederal agencies, stuff like that.\n\n1105\n00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,400\nIt's going to be a big part.\n\n1106\n00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,285\nDon't forget, you can do some\ngreat pranks on fax machines.\n\n1107\n00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:04,050\n>> [LAUGH] Uh-oh, do we wanna know?\n\n1108\n00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,280\n>> Oh yeah, you guys totally wanna know.\n\n1109\n00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,850\n>> Come on, give us one example.\n\n1110\n00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:12,840\n>> My favorite is to tape four to five\nsheets of paper together, end to end.\n\n1111\n00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,360\nAnd then, run through the fax machine,\n\n1112\n00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,500\nand then when you get it halfway through,\ntape it to the last one.\n\n1113\n00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,120\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, no.\n\n1114\n00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:19,870\nIt just keeps going.\n\n1115\n00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:20,650\n>> Just looping around?\n\n1116\n00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:21,720\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, no.\n\n1117\n00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,980\n>> So, it's especially funny if you\nknow that person's got a roll fed\n\n1118\n00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,250\nfax at their end.\n\n1119\n00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,330\nThey will come to their\ncubicle in the morning and\n\n1120\n00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:30,500\nbe like, what the hell just happened?\n\n1121\n00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,690\nAnd they'd all be filled up.\n\n1122\n00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,293\nIt's pretty sweet, yeah.\n\n1123\n00:57:34,293 --> 00:57:37,420\n>> [LAUGH] I like it, I like it.\n\n1124\n00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:42,330\nSo communication wise, we've got our phone\nlines for obvious communication needs.\n\n1125\n00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:45,150\nPossibly segregated out from\nthe rest of the business.\n\n1126\n00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:48,420\nWe've got our fax lines\nbecause we know that\n\n1127\n00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,280\nsome facilities are gonna require that.\n\n1128\n00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,660\nIt's something that we need.\n\n1129\n00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,620\nWe can't be using those e-services for\nthings like that.\n\n1130\n00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,450\nToo big of a security risk there.\n\n1131\n00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:01,905\nJust to kinda touch on something,\ncuz you had mentioned it in passing\n\n1132\n00:58:01,905 --> 00:58:07,060\nabout having the phone lines when\nwe were talking about the fax.\n\n1133\n00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,940\nAnd how you probably already have those.\n\n1134\n00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,460\nIf you don't, you really should\nhave some form of dial-up there,\n\n1135\n00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,019\nwhich obviously is gonna\nneed phone lines to do it.\n\n1136\n00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:23,240\nMost forensics labs will have\ndial up capability in there for\n\n1137\n00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,310\nsome of the stuff that they're doing.\n\n1138\n00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,920\n>> That's a good point,\nwe're talking about networking.\n\n1139\n00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,755\nWe might need some other means of,\nif the ISP's are down.\n\n1140\n00:58:32,755 --> 00:58:35,575\nOr again, it's one of those\nthings where sometimes it's\n\n1141\n00:58:35,575 --> 00:58:38,002\nreally easy to forget about\nthe rest of the world.\n\n1142\n00:58:38,002 --> 00:58:42,764\nAnd not everybody has high speed\ninternet access into the office, and\n\n1143\n00:58:42,764 --> 00:58:44,062\nthings like that.\n\n1144\n00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,663\nDial up may be the only\nmeans of communications.\n\n1145\n00:58:46,663 --> 00:58:52,282\nA lot of times, we see after incidents\nwhere it involves natural disasters and\n\n1146\n00:58:52,282 --> 00:58:53,652\nthings like that.\n\n1147\n00:58:53,652 --> 00:58:57,300\nThe ISPs, these cable services,\nthose are not a priority.\n\n1148\n00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,500\nSo phone lines, power, water.\n\n1149\n00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:04,080\nThese are the things that these emergency\nservices get back on line first,\n\n1150\n00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,230\nwhich is another reason\nmaybe we need to have that.\n\n1151\n00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:10,110\nSo dial-ups again, you might not use\nit all the time, but we need it.\n\n1152\n00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:13,210\nJust like we need that five and\na quarter floppy drive, or that three and\n\n1153\n00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:14,090\na half floppy drive.\n\n1154\n00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:17,510\nWe don't use it very often, but\nwhen I need it, it's good to have it.\n\n1155\n00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,540\nSo get yourself a phone line put in there.\n\n1156\n00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,750\nGet you some modems put in there, so\nthat you can have those available.\n\n1157\n00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,520\nSo, phones, fax, dedicated network,\n\n1158\n00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,645\npretty much covers communication needs for\nour lab?\n\n1159\n00:59:29,645 --> 00:59:32,060\n>> Yeah.\nYou're just gonna need to be up for\n\n1160\n00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:35,950\nthe appropriate communication\ninfrastructure for that.\n\n1161\n00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:39,040\nRemember, you could be talking\nabout with a dedicated network.\n\n1162\n00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,090\nIt's not something directly addressed.\n\n1163\n00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:45,610\nBut we'll just kind of leave\nit as something that you can\n\n1164\n00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,310\ndeal with once you set it up.\n\n1165\n00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:52,680\nBut, you're gonna need your\nown servers in there to store\n\n1166\n00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,190\ninformation, stuff like that.\n\n1167\n00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,320\n>> My forensics machines then,\n\n1168\n00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,498\nare probably not gonna be\npart of the corporate domain?\n\n1169\n00:59:59,498 --> 01:00:00,380\n>> Never.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1170\n01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,270\n>> Never. Never. Never.\n\n1171\n01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:04,620\nYeah, they may all be stand\nalones as a matter of fact.\n\n1172\n01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:07,193\n>> Get a group policy applied to them,\nand all that good stuff.\n\n1173\n01:00:07,193 --> 01:00:07,800\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1174\n01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,014\nThat shouldn't hurt anything.\n\n1175\n01:00:09,014 --> 01:00:10,620\n>> [LAUGH] Keeps us nice and secure.\n\n1176\n01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,870\nYou know how Windows is.\n\n1177\n01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:12,490\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1178\n01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:16,558\nAbsolutely.\n[LAUGH] So, communications we've got down.\n\n1179\n01:00:16,558 --> 01:00:20,270\nNext, we're gonna talk about\nhuman resources and staffing.\n\n1180\n01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:23,130\nWho is it that we need\nto have on our team.\n\n1181\n01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:28,800\nI know we've illuted to a few\ntimes in previous episodes,\n\n1182\n01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,590\nhaving this, I won't say multi-fasted, but\npool of people from different skill sets.\n\n1183\n01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:37,770\n>> Yeah, human resources is gonna\nhave to get involved in this.\n\n1184\n01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:41,120\nExpect to have a legal liaison,\n\n1185\n01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:46,840\nif not a fully dedicated\nlawyer to your cause.\n\n1186\n01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:50,020\nAgain, depends on the size and\nhow many cases you're getting.\n\n1187\n01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:52,070\nSo that's gonna be a requirement.\n\n1188\n01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:55,940\nYou need to have a lab director,\nput in there.\n\n1189\n01:00:55,940 --> 01:01:00,450\nThat's gonna be usually a senior\nperson that's got a lot of experience,\n\n1190\n01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:06,000\nthat may work cases, but is gonna be\nhandling more of that management roll,\n\n1191\n01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,980\nand resources roll, and\nall that part of it.\n\n1192\n01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,120\nThat's a big thing.\n\n1193\n01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:16,590\nOutside of that,\noutside of just the people,\n\n1194\n01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,650\nit's keeping those people up to date.\n\n1195\n01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:22,190\nThat's where checking,\nkeeping track of licensing.\n\n1196\n01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,570\nAnd are they doing continued education?\n\n1197\n01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:28,650\nThat's where all of that comes in because\nyou need to keep these people sharp.\n\n1198\n01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:29,680\nYou just can't say, okay.\n\n1199\n01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,000\nWell, you've got or had some\nforensics training at one point, and\n\n1200\n01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,780\nwe're just gonna call it even.\n\n1201\n01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:39,870\nNo, they do have to do\nongoing continuing education.\n\n1202\n01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:44,530\nBut, you can't devalue or\n\n1203\n01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:49,240\nunderestimate how much that is\nactually gonna help people.\n\n1204\n01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,930\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n1205\n01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,360\nThings change so fast.\n\n1206\n01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,350\nWe see it all the time.\n\n1207\n01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:56,080\nNew tools,\nnew technology becomes available.\n\n1208\n01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:00,990\nI might have gotten certified a few years\nago, but those tools weren't even around\n\n1209\n01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:03,490\nat the point, or those techniques\nweren't around at that point.\n\n1210\n01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:07,310\nSo I need to make sure that I am or\n\n1211\n01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:10,740\nthe rest of my staff is staying on top\nof my game, and being the best I can be.\n\n1212\n01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,570\nAnd that means continuing education.\n\n1213\n01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,650\nWe just can't forget and\nrest on our laurels,\n\n1214\n01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:18,195\nwe've got to stay up with the times.\n\n1215\n01:02:18,195 --> 01:02:22,135\n>> Yeah, think of it like a doctor would.\n\n1216\n01:02:22,135 --> 01:02:23,615\nDoctor, do you wanna?\n\n1217\n01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:29,215\nYou may have a great doctor, but do you\nwant a doctor that came out of medical\n\n1218\n01:02:29,215 --> 01:02:35,370\nschool 30 year ago, and has never gone\nto any conferences or any update stuff?\n\n1219\n01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:35,895\nNo.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1220\n01:02:35,895 --> 01:02:37,175\n>> You don't want that.\n\n1221\n01:02:37,175 --> 01:02:39,430\nThat could be a very bad situation.\n\n1222\n01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:42,850\n>> You walk in and they break out the\nbottle of leaches, and things like that.\n\n1223\n01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:43,479\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n1224\n01:02:43,479 --> 01:02:47,509\n>> And security is like no, let's find\nsomebody who might have done a little\n\n1225\n01:02:47,509 --> 01:02:49,873\nmore training within this decade, yeah.\n\n1226\n01:02:49,873 --> 01:02:50,373\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1227\n01:02:50,373 --> 01:02:52,510\nMeasuring the bumps on your skull, and\n\n1228\n01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:53,710\nbleeding you, and stuff like that.\n\n1229\n01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,150\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, it's\n\n1230\n01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:56,570\nnot something that's practical.\n\n1231\n01:02:56,570 --> 01:03:01,320\nI mean, the field of forensics\nhas developed quite a bit, and\n\n1232\n01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,330\nit's rapidly developing.\n\n1233\n01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:07,790\nNow, I mean technology seems to\nbe coming out even faster now.\n\n1234\n01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:09,560\n>> Look at solid state drives, right?\n\n1235\n01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,670\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> I mean we analyze those completely\n\n1236\n01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:14,100\ndifferently than we handle\nour old mechanical drives.\n\n1237\n01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,840\nAnd if I am a forensic investigator that\nhasn't done any training in the last five\n\n1238\n01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,420\nyears, I'm not gonna be\nfamiliar with those techniques.\n\n1239\n01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,728\nCloud technologies, right?\n\n1240\n01:03:21,728 --> 01:03:23,780\nBringing that in,\nsomething that's relatively new.\n\n1241\n01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:26,854\nAnd if I'm not continuing my education and\nstaying up on this,\n\n1242\n01:03:26,854 --> 01:03:29,002\nI'm not gonna be able\nto do that kinda work.\n\n1243\n01:03:29,002 --> 01:03:33,618\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of\nbiggies that can potentially\n\n1244\n01:03:33,618 --> 01:03:38,551\nbe lost if you don't do\ncontinuing education training.\n\n1245\n01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:43,340\nI can tell you, I mean, there's one\ngroup that's really good for that.\n\n1246\n01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:46,420\nThere may be some of you out here\nthat are already members of it.\n\n1247\n01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:51,385\nIt's the HTCIA, the High Tech\nCrime Investigators Association.\n\n1248\n01:03:51,385 --> 01:03:56,020\nThey should be at htcia.org.\n\n1249\n01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,870\nAnd you can become part of that group.\n\n1250\n01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:01,700\nI believe you've gotta either\nknow somebody that's in there,\n\n1251\n01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:05,110\nor there might be some\npaperwork to fill out.\n\n1252\n01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:09,490\nBut I've been to a handful\nof their conferences,\n\n1253\n01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:13,950\nit's amazing, the stuff that's in there.\n\n1254\n01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:18,870\nAnd you can interact with a tremendous\namount of people in this industry,\n\n1255\n01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:23,820\nso not only do they have little break out\nsessions in there, where they talk about,\n\n1256\n01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:27,490\nyou know, different things and\ndifferent situations.\n\n1257\n01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:32,540\nI mean, you're getting lectures and\nyou are getting interactions with people\n\n1258\n01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:37,540\nthat are really like, really some of\nthe biggest experts in their field,\n\n1259\n01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,880\nor people who have worked actual\ncases are telling you, okay,\n\n1260\n01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,200\nhere's a case I worked on,\nthey're walking you through the processes,\n\n1261\n01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,500\nbringing new developments,\nit's pretty sweet.\n\n1262\n01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,090\nA lot of the times I went there, I was\nsitting next to, at lunch I was sitting\n\n1263\n01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:59,710\nnext to four or five police officers\nthat they did this sort of thing and\n\n1264\n01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:08,290\nwe're talking and kinda shooting the\nbreeze on how they carried out their jobs.\n\n1265\n01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:10,090\n>> Nice.\n>> And so yeah,\n\n1266\n01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:14,660\nI would highly recommend that,\nto do something like that.\n\n1267\n01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,460\nThey're a good organization,\nthere are other ones.\n\n1268\n01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:20,150\nBut that's just one.\n\n1269\n01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:23,190\n>> Yeah, I mean, this just goes on\nto that continuing education, right?\n\n1270\n01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:26,620\nI mean, not only can I get trained\nup in the latest techniques,\n\n1271\n01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:28,700\nthe latest software, the latest hardware.\n\n1272\n01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,680\nBut talking to other people\nthat are in the industry, and\n\n1273\n01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:34,310\nlearning some tips and\ntricks that maybe they've developed or\n\n1274\n01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:38,630\nwhat their best practices are can\ndefinitely help me, cuz I can take some of\n\n1275\n01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:43,680\ntheir experience, we can share experiences\nand that just spreads that knowledge,\n\n1276\n01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,320\nand in the end makes you\na better forensic investigator.\n\n1277\n01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,820\n>> Yeah, and\nto add just another thing onto that.\n\n1278\n01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,940\nOne of the most important things you need\nto do when you move into the position of\n\n1279\n01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:57,890\na forensic investigator, and\ncontinue to do, is to build contacts and\n\n1280\n01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:03,930\nwhen you build those contacts and\nliaisons with different agencies,\n\n1281\n01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:08,950\ndon't wait till the excrement hits the fan\n\n1282\n01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:14,450\nto start going out and making contacts.\n\n1283\n01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:18,260\nThat's the wrong time to do it,\nI mean you can do it, but\n\n1284\n01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,870\nit just makes things more difficult.\n\n1285\n01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:24,100\nThe recommendation is,\nis that when you move into the position\n\n1286\n01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,220\nof being a forensic investigator and\nthey give you that lab,\n\n1287\n01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:30,520\none of the first actions you take\nis you start calling up people.\n\n1288\n01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,630\nYou start calling up local law\nenforcement, FBI, stuff like that, and\n\n1289\n01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,750\nsaying hey, we just set this up.\n\n1290\n01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:40,660\nI wanna know who's in charge of this and\ntell them the specific area\n\n1291\n01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:45,890\nand introduce yourself and\nget their number and all that stuff, and\n\n1292\n01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:50,720\nso they're aware of who you are, so\nif you do need to ask them for assistance,\n\n1293\n01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,420\nit's not like, well, who are you again?\n\n1294\n01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:54,430\nThey have to check a bunch of stuff.\n\n1295\n01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:57,100\nDo it ahead of time, whatever you need to.\n\n1296\n01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:04,200\nSomething like the HTCIA,\nyou'll make a ton of contacts there,\n\n1297\n01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:08,590\nthat will be extremely helpful for\nyou, professionally.\n\n1298\n01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:13,920\nAgain, I'm not sitting here to\nendorse that one agency, or one group.\n\n1299\n01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,670\nI'm talking about them cuz,\nit's one of the ones I've been to, and\n\n1300\n01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:22,980\nI saw it had a tremendous\namount of people going there.\n\n1301\n01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,840\nI went to one in San Diego.\n\n1302\n01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,610\nThere was like 5 or 6,000 people there.\n\n1303\n01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,950\n>> Wow.\n>> Yeah, it was mind boggling.\n\n1304\n01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:31,620\nIt was like three or four days.\n\n1305\n01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:35,730\n>> And you'll find, if you look in\nyour area, there's most likely some\n\n1306\n01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:38,990\ngroups that already meet that you\ncan probably get involved with.\n\n1307\n01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:40,520\nIf not, heck, start your own.\n\n1308\n01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,080\nGet in touch with some people then say,\nhey look, how about we meet once a month,\n\n1309\n01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:44,920\nevery thursday.\n\n1310\n01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,340\nThe third thursday of the month or\nwhatever, and have some little meeting,\n\n1311\n01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:48,480\nget it started.\n\n1312\n01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,530\nIf there's nothing locally and\n\n1313\n01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:52,340\nnot enough people in your area\nthat might be interested in that.\n\n1314\n01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:54,950\nMaybe you do it in an online format.\n\n1315\n01:07:54,950 --> 01:08:00,490\nBut just some way to get people together\nfrom different disciplines that we can\n\n1316\n01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:05,560\ntalk about stuff and talk about techniques\nand just do social networking in general.\n\n1317\n01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:10,610\n>> Oh, yeah, there's even other ones\nlike InfraGard, if the FBI has that one,\n\n1318\n01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:12,030\nand those are all over the place.\n\n1319\n01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:15,660\nSo, you could look at\nsomething like that too.\n\n1320\n01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:20,970\nSo yeah,\nthere's a lot of groups you can talk to,\n\n1321\n01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:26,690\nto build those contacts, as well as,\ndo that continuing education, so.\n\n1322\n01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,240\nThere you go.\nThat's a Human Resources issue.\n\n1323\n01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,082\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1324\n01:08:32,082 --> 01:08:36,250\nAll right, so I tell you what Sean, we are\ngetting ready to dive into equipment, but\n\n1325\n01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,490\nI'm thinking that might be a large topic.\n\n1326\n01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:40,630\nYou want to go ahead and\ntake a break here?\n\n1327\n01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:43,102\nOr do you want to get started\nwith a little bit of equipment,\n\n1328\n01:08:43,102 --> 01:08:43,898\nwhat do you think?\n\n1329\n01:08:43,898 --> 01:08:48,760\n>> We can just mention,\nyou know it's coming up here.\n\n1330\n01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,920\nJust take a moment.\n\n1331\n01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:55,515\nWe've, we're gonna be talking later on,\nlooks like after lunch,\n\n1332\n01:08:55,515 --> 01:09:00,830\nwe're gonna be talking about hardware and\nsoftware, but we are gonna talk\n\n1333\n01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:06,020\nabout equipment that supports all of\nthat stuff that you have to have around.\n\n1334\n01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:14,510\nYou guys probably already know what we're\ngetting at here, at least a little bit.\n\n1335\n01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:20,680\nYou can set up a network, and your\nserver rooms, and all that good stuff.\n\n1336\n01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:26,700\nBut there's those other things that\nyou need around to replace components,\n\n1337\n01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:32,100\nto support things, to do all sorts\nof stuff, that's the stuff that we\n\n1338\n01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,260\nneed to talk about that you need to have,\nbecause it's gonna be stuff that's up and\n\n1339\n01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:39,122\nabove what you would normally have for\nIT, so you should have that.\n\n1340\n01:09:39,122 --> 01:09:41,720\n>> So you should be around other servers\nand things like that there's gonna be,\n\n1341\n01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,260\nof course all my toys,\nwe're gonna get to that, I'm sure.\n\n1342\n01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:45,920\n>> Oh we will.\n>> [LAUGH] But\n\n1343\n01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,840\nwe do have to have certain\nequipment in place.\n\n1344\n01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:51,290\nAs you said,\nthat's a little bit different maybe.\n\n1345\n01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:54,260\nA lot of it's similar to what we're used\nto working with in our normal LANs and\n\n1346\n01:09:54,260 --> 01:10:00,020\nWANs, but then there's that stuff that's\nspecial to being a forensic investigator,\n\n1347\n01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,835\nand being in a forensics lab.\n\n1348\n01:10:02,835 --> 01:10:06,175\n>> Well, you mentioned it today, and\nwe were also mentioned it yesterday,\n\n1349\n01:10:06,175 --> 01:10:11,045\nan example that we could use in here\nthat you wouldn't have in normal IT,\n\n1350\n01:10:11,045 --> 01:10:14,025\nwell, I hope you don't\nhave in normal IT anymore,\n\n1351\n01:10:14,025 --> 01:10:19,797\nis eight inch or five and\na quarter floppies.\n\n1352\n01:10:19,797 --> 01:10:20,897\nYou know?\n\n1353\n01:10:20,897 --> 01:10:25,147\nIf you think you're in a situation that\nyou're gonna run into eight inch ones,\n\n1354\n01:10:25,147 --> 01:10:28,527\nyou either better have one or\nknow where to get one.\n\n1355\n01:10:28,527 --> 01:10:31,357\nSame with five and a quarter,\nyou better have access to a drive or\n\n1356\n01:10:31,357 --> 01:10:33,950\nyou better know where to get one.\n\n1357\n01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:37,850\nYou know, hopefully if you deal\nwith enough cases like that,\n\n1358\n01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:42,110\nyou just get one and\nkeep it in your inventory.\n\n1359\n01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:43,574\nYou probably got one in your garage right?\n\n1360\n01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:46,010\n>> You know, I was just trying to think.\n\n1361\n01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:49,915\n[LAUGH] I do have a, the five and\na quarter, I do not have the old eight,\n\n1362\n01:10:49,915 --> 01:10:52,995\nI have an old eight floppy disk and\nnothing to plug it into,\n\n1363\n01:10:52,995 --> 01:10:55,505\nso I'm gonna have to\nwork on getting my drive.\n\n1364\n01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:56,295\nWe'll talk to Dave and\n\n1365\n01:10:56,295 --> 01:11:00,830\nsee if he has got any spares at the IBM\nmuseum that I can purchase or something.\n\n1366\n01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:04,372\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I watched a guy at one of\n\n1367\n01:11:04,372 --> 01:11:09,582\nthe bases I taught at when I\nwas teaching the Air Force.\n\n1368\n01:11:09,582 --> 01:11:13,530\nI remember going to one base and\nthis guy tells a, these people find out,\n\n1369\n01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:17,190\nthey were doing a class on how to repair\ncomputer hardware and stuff like that.\n\n1370\n01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,650\nAnd so he's like, oh great,\nyour students are doing that.\n\n1371\n01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:23,255\nWe're in the chow hall, and we're doing\nall this, and the guy says, yeah,\n\n1372\n01:11:23,255 --> 01:11:26,934\nI remember I built my first computer\nback in the 80s with 8-inch floppies.\n\n1373\n01:11:26,934 --> 01:11:31,032\nAnd this young airman, I mean, come on,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1374\n01:11:31,032 --> 01:11:32,669\n>> Young airman, looking there, says,\n\n1375\n01:11:32,669 --> 01:11:33,817\noh no, sir you're wrong.\n\n1376\n01:11:33,817 --> 01:11:35,258\nHe's telling a Master Chief this.\n\n1377\n01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:40,490\nHe's like, sir you're wrong,\nthey don't have eight inch floppies,\n\n1378\n01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:44,140\nit's five and a quarter and\nthree and a half.\n\n1379\n01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,764\nI look at the the guy and\nI'm like, they did have those and\n\n1380\n01:11:46,764 --> 01:11:48,631\nremember who you're talking to [LAUGH].\n\n1381\n01:11:48,631 --> 01:11:52,240\n>> Right, [LAUGH] did he end up\ndoing some pushups out of that one?\n\n1382\n01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:56,292\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> No, the Master Chief got a laugh out of\n\n1383\n01:11:56,292 --> 01:11:58,467\nit he was like,\nwell I'm retiring anyways what do I care.\n\n1384\n01:11:58,467 --> 01:12:00,737\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE] thought it was hilarious.\n\n1385\n01:12:00,737 --> 01:12:02,560\n>> That's good.\n\n1386\n01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,398\nAll right, well looking at our clock\nladies and gentlemen, it's about time for\n\n1387\n01:12:05,398 --> 01:12:06,075\nus to take a break.\n\n1388\n01:12:06,075 --> 01:12:09,533\nWhen we come back, we're gonna\ndive into the world of equipment,\n\n1389\n01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:12,438\ncontinuing on again with our\ncomputer forensics lab and\n\n1390\n01:12:12,438 --> 01:12:16,169\nthe equipment that we might need, or\nwill need to set that up properly.\n\n1391\n01:12:16,169 --> 01:12:17,920\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1392\n01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:25,972\n[SOUND] All right welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n1393\n01:12:25,972 --> 01:12:29,704\nSo continuing on with our\ncomputer forensics lab episodes,\n\n1394\n01:12:29,704 --> 01:12:32,199\nwe're gonna dive into equipment next.\n\n1395\n01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:34,179\nSo, Sean,\nwhere do we start with our equipment?\n\n1396\n01:12:34,179 --> 01:12:37,193\nI know there's all kinds of really\ncool tools we can get out there, but\n\n1397\n01:12:37,193 --> 01:12:40,103\nwe really need to focus on what type\nof equipment I need in that lab and\n\n1398\n01:12:40,103 --> 01:12:42,300\nkind of getting that all set up, right?\n\n1399\n01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:46,470\n>> Yes, in most circles,\nthis would be just supporting equipment.\n\n1400\n01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:51,420\nIf we're talking just regular IT,\nthis would just be\n\n1401\n01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:57,970\nextras that we try to have some of\nthe more common things around and\n\n1402\n01:12:57,970 --> 01:13:02,670\nthat's it, we're talking stuff like extra\nnetwork cables and maybe power cords that\n\n1403\n01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:07,070\nwe've yanked out of other stuff that's no\nlonger around, you know things like that.\n\n1404\n01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:11,480\nSo it's not an unusual concept to think\nthat we would have extra things around\n\n1405\n01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,258\nbut, what we are talking about\nwith forensics actually,\n\n1406\n01:13:14,258 --> 01:13:16,580\nextends out quite a bit more than that.\n\n1407\n01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:23,080\nBecause as they say, you have to be\nprepared for really any situation.\n\n1408\n01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:30,410\nSo it means that we are having things like\nextra adapter cards for different setups.\n\n1409\n01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:35,590\nWe have things to account for, maybe\ndifferent types of RAID we might see,\n\n1410\n01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:37,741\nwe have all sorts of whatever.\n\n1411\n01:13:37,741 --> 01:13:41,841\nI mean we've already gone through and\nmessed with the three-and-a-half inch and\n\n1412\n01:13:41,841 --> 01:13:46,519\nfive-and-a-quarter, eight-inch floppy, the\nchances are you're probably not gonna see\n\n1413\n01:13:46,519 --> 01:13:49,390\nan eight inch floppy,\nat least not all that often.\n\n1414\n01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:54,450\nBut, it's just to illustrate\nthe point that something that if\n\n1415\n01:13:54,450 --> 01:14:00,230\nyou think you're out there, you should\neither have it in your equipment,\n\n1416\n01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:02,660\nor you should know where to get it.\n\n1417\n01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:04,370\nSo we're talking here,\n\n1418\n01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:08,680\nprimarily about those things\nthat you should consider having.\n\n1419\n01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,510\nAnd you should have\nquite a good library or\n\n1420\n01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:16,040\nequipment lab to make sure you've got\nwhat you need so you can just go over and\n\n1421\n01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:20,980\ngrab it, instead of having to say well,\nI have to order that and wait for\n\n1422\n01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:23,950\na few days while your\ninvestigation's getting held up.\n\n1423\n01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,510\nTime is of the essence.\n\n1424\n01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:28,570\n>> Yeah, one of the first things\nI think about is, above and\n\n1425\n01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:32,520\nbeyond our networking equipment and things\nlike that, like hard guys, for example.\n\n1426\n01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,460\nCuz we always talk about, and we're\ngonna talk about in a future episode,\n\n1427\n01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:39,580\nwhen we gather that evidence we\ndon't work with the actual evidence,\n\n1428\n01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,915\nlike the hard drive,\nunless we make a copy of it.\n\n1429\n01:14:41,915 --> 01:14:43,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Which means,\n\n1430\n01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:45,410\nI need extra hard drives laying around.\n\n1431\n01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:50,575\n>> Yeah, absolutely you do need\nextra hard drives hanging around for\n\n1432\n01:14:50,575 --> 01:14:51,595\nreasons such as that.\n\n1433\n01:14:51,595 --> 01:14:56,925\nAnd you'd need to have quite a few of\nthem and they need to be maintained\n\n1434\n01:14:56,925 --> 01:15:01,825\nas being forensically wiped and\ncleaned after each use.\n\n1435\n01:15:01,825 --> 01:15:05,460\nSo there needs to be something\nto actually log that too.\n\n1436\n01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:10,670\nThat's very, very important,\nespecially with media like that.\n\n1437\n01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:13,140\nLeave something behind,\nit hasn't been cleaned,\n\n1438\n01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:17,570\nthat can be rather embarrassing if you\nstart mixing data from one case or\n\n1439\n01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:19,040\nanother,\n>> Oops.\n\n1440\n01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,160\n>> Yeah, that's not gonna look good for\nyou, that shows carelessness.\n\n1441\n01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,020\n>> Right.\n\n1442\n01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,010\nAnd you talked earlier about\nnot only making one copy but\n\n1443\n01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:29,670\nmaking two copies,\nmaking a copy of the copy.\n\n1444\n01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:32,170\nAnd then I might have multiple\ncases that I'm working on, or\n\n1445\n01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:35,370\na single case might involve\nmore than one computer.\n\n1446\n01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:38,220\nSo I'm talking about\nimaging multiple drives.\n\n1447\n01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:41,440\nIf that system had a RAID array in there,\nI've got to set up that RAID array, right,\n\n1448\n01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,780\nand copy that whole thing.\n\n1449\n01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:48,119\nSo, you're gonna need a good stack of hard\ndrives laying around of various sizes and\n\n1450\n01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:49,102\nthings like that.\n\n1451\n01:15:49,102 --> 01:15:54,264\n>> In fact, what you were just\nmentioning here is that, yeah, when you\n\n1452\n01:15:54,264 --> 01:16:00,316\nsay about making a copy of a drive, when\nyou initially hear that it's like okay,\n\n1453\n01:16:00,316 --> 01:16:06,220\nhave the drive work on the copy and\nno ones kind of having issues with that.\n\n1454\n01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:09,930\nBut, yeah, if you damage the copy,\nyou know, go make another copy.\n\n1455\n01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:12,020\nWell, you don't want to [CROSSTALK]\n>> Time consuming.\n\n1456\n01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:15,174\n>> It's time consuming, but\neven if we push the side thing aside,\n\n1457\n01:16:15,174 --> 01:16:18,880\ncuz we do have a lot of hardware devices,\nstuff that we have yet\n\n1458\n01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:24,380\nto talk about,\nthat can copy stuff pretty quickly.\n\n1459\n01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:29,860\nThe thing is is that,\nevery time you engage that original,\n\n1460\n01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:32,800\nwe're getting back to that\nexchange principle again.\n\n1461\n01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,940\nYou're taking a chance that something bad\ncould happen, you could fry that drive or\n\n1462\n01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:42,060\nwhatever, so let's just kind of\nmake a copy or a couple copies and\n\n1463\n01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:46,244\nthen one goes bad,\nyou get a copy of the other copy.\n\n1464\n01:16:46,244 --> 01:16:48,140\n>> Every contact leaves trace, right?\n\n1465\n01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:50,930\nYeah, so we wanna touch it\nas few times as possible.\n\n1466\n01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:53,440\nMaybe knock it all out at the beginning\nthere, make a couple copies and\n\n1467\n01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,230\nthen we've got a safe backup\nif we mess up our first copy.\n\n1468\n01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:00,970\n>> Yeah, play it safe and\nthat's why those hard drives come in,\n\n1469\n01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:06,130\njust for\nhaving the multiple copy situation.\n\n1470\n01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:10,400\nBut I'd also throw in there's unique\nsituations that have happened where\n\n1471\n01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:15,419\na system, during normal usage or\nwhat have you,\n\n1472\n01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:21,130\nwho knows, maybe when this was part of a\ncrime scene or being investigated, it was\n\n1473\n01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:26,010\nbeing transported someplace and there was,\nI don't know, I'll just throw it in there,\n\n1474\n01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:30,060\na car accident, and\nthat caused damage to the system.\n\n1475\n01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:33,610\nAnd the hard drive's still intact but\nmaybe it's jammed or\n\n1476\n01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:37,260\nsomething like that from having an impact.\n\n1477\n01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:39,800\nYou aren't gonna be able\nto use that drive as it is.\n\n1478\n01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,650\nWho knows, maybe you've gotta\nperform surgery and open up one and\n\n1479\n01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:50,410\ndrop the platters in that new one, and\nhopefully that will work, it's been done.\n\n1480\n01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:53,145\nThe thing is you have to find a solution.\n\n1481\n01:17:53,145 --> 01:17:59,163\nWhen you're a technician and you're being\nasked to investigate something unusual,\n\n1482\n01:17:59,163 --> 01:18:03,840\nand different, and\nchallenging situations are gonna pop up.\n\n1483\n01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:09,420\nThat's why that knowledge that you have\nof hardware software comes into play.\n\n1484\n01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:12,080\nYou gotta have that,\nthen you also have to be creative.\n\n1485\n01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:16,584\nAnd so, having equipment around allows you\nthat flexibility is always a great thing,\n\n1486\n01:18:16,584 --> 01:18:18,720\nthe tools and all that other good stuff.\n\n1487\n01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,795\n>> Now, a question for you, and I don't\nknow if we know the answer to this.\n\n1488\n01:18:21,795 --> 01:18:25,535\nBut if you've got let's say that\nthere was a RAID array in the server.\n\n1489\n01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:29,615\nDo I necessarily have to set up\na RAID array to duplicate that, or\n\n1490\n01:18:29,615 --> 01:18:33,410\ndo I just need something big\nenough to capture that data on?\n\n1491\n01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:36,253\n>> It's typically, you're gonna\nprobably be setting up the RAID array.\n\n1492\n01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:40,151\n>> Try to mirror it exactly how it's\nset up so if there's any quirks or\n\n1493\n01:18:40,151 --> 01:18:41,687\ntwists to it or whatever.\n\n1494\n01:18:41,687 --> 01:18:48,047\n>> Yeah you wanna have a like for\nlike as much as possible and\n\n1495\n01:18:48,047 --> 01:18:50,447\nthat also brings up another\nthing that relates to equipment,\n\n1496\n01:18:50,447 --> 01:18:55,990\nis that, do you have RAID controllers and\nstuff like that on hand to do that?\n\n1497\n01:18:55,990 --> 01:19:01,060\nOr do you just, if you need to,\nseize that equipment,\n\n1498\n01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:06,480\nor do a search on that equipment,\nand get your information off of it.\n\n1499\n01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:11,110\nDo you just take out the drives and\ntransport them to the lab and plug\n\n1500\n01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:14,880\nthem into your own RAID configuration,\nor do you take the whole system?\n\n1501\n01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:19,120\nA lot of cases they may decide,\nyou know, I'm taking a RAID system.\n\n1502\n01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:23,220\n>> Unless it's something that I know\nI have and know I can set up easily,\n\n1503\n01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:26,552\nI'm taking the whole RAID system,\nso it's not your computer anymore.\n\n1504\n01:19:26,552 --> 01:19:27,404\n>> Very good.\n\n1505\n01:19:27,404 --> 01:19:31,523\nAll right so we got lots of hard drives\nlaying around, so we can duplicate that.\n\n1506\n01:19:31,523 --> 01:19:32,861\nCabling would come next probably,\n\n1507\n01:19:32,861 --> 01:19:35,862\nI'm thinking all of these hard drives\nDifferent connectivity types, right?\n\n1508\n01:19:35,862 --> 01:19:36,675\nSATA, PATA.\n\n1509\n01:19:36,675 --> 01:19:38,010\n>> You got it.\n\n1510\n01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:41,360\n>> SCSI, whatever the case may be, eSATA.\n\n1511\n01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,560\nAgain, if we're trying to\nduplicate that environment,\n\n1512\n01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,360\nwe gotta make sure that we've\ngot the same cabling, right?\n\n1513\n01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,310\n>> Yeah,\nit's duplicating the environment, but\n\n1514\n01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:52,390\nif you also recall, cuz you had\nvery nicely pointed out yesterday,\n\n1515\n01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:57,700\nwhen I had that case up here that\nallows me to duplicate the drives,\n\n1516\n01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:01,710\nyou pointed out that there was SATA\nstuff and other connections on there.\n\n1517\n01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:04,280\nYou gotta have the cables to\nbe able to connect to that,\n\n1518\n01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:08,400\nso if you're imaging drives-\n>> Yeah, you gotta be prepared for\n\n1519\n01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,760\nwhatever you might run into.\n\n1520\n01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,790\nSo lots of cables, for\nall your different connectivities.\n\n1521\n01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:17,198\nYou know, USB, for some maybe USB\nexternal drives, external SATA.\n\n1522\n01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:23,700\nInternally, you got your IDE or\nEIDE, and your SATA, and your SCSI.\n\n1523\n01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,520\nAnd things like that.\n\n1524\n01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,450\nSo, lots of different\ncables we've got to have.\n\n1525\n01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:28,730\nGot to do that.\n\n1526\n01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:32,360\nOptical media would be another\nthing that we might need, right.\n\n1527\n01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:32,950\n>> That one.\n\n1528\n01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:33,980\nPretty straight forward.\n\n1529\n01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:38,754\nYou've got optical media,\nif you need to duplicate one or\n\n1530\n01:20:38,754 --> 01:20:43,340\ndo testing on it,\nyou need to have extra optical media.\n\n1531\n01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,649\nAnd that includes the whole gamut of them.\n\n1532\n01:20:44,649 --> 01:20:48,634\n>> CDs, DVDs and all that different thing,\nBlu-ray, double-density,\n\n1533\n01:20:48,634 --> 01:20:50,480\ndouble-sides or whatever.\n\n1534\n01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:54,683\n>> Yeah, those ones, the plus and\nthe minus and, you know, whatever, you may\n\n1535\n01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:59,980\nconsider getting those types, probably\nget the most popular ones to be honest.\n\n1536\n01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:04,270\nAnd then, if you need the other ones,\nhey, you're gonna have to order them,\n\n1537\n01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:07,940\nbut most of the time, you're gonna\nrun to a few common formats there.\n\n1538\n01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:09,030\n>> Right.\nVery good.\n\n1539\n01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:12,640\nAll right, so, lots of different optical\nmedia that we can have available and\n\n1540\n01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,840\nof course, the readers or\nwriters that go with that.\n\n1541\n01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,050\nThen we dive into this mobile lab,\nforensics workstation.\n\n1542\n01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:28,180\n>> Yeah, that's kinda, that's another kind\nof sorta, are you gonna need that or not?\n\n1543\n01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:35,220\nWe can look at mobile, actually,\ntwo ways, are you going\n\n1544\n01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:40,470\nto be taking stuff, are you going to be\ngoing on sight and doing stuff there.\n\n1545\n01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:44,090\nIn that case, then you're going to need\nto get stuff like I brought in here.\n\n1546\n01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:47,330\nYou're going to need to get\nthe equipment that's portable that you\n\n1547\n01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:48,480\ncan take out to a site.\n\n1548\n01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,570\nAnd do whatever with.\n\n1549\n01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:56,980\nAnd there's a seemingly almost\nendless amount of options there.\n\n1550\n01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:02,200\nYou could have stuff that's just\na USB drive that you plug in and\n\n1551\n01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:07,120\nwill scan a drive for things like\ninstant messages and things like that.\n\n1552\n01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,160\nThey literally do have those,\nyou boot off of it,\n\n1553\n01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,140\nit'll sweep the drive looking for that.\n\n1554\n01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:17,670\nYou know then you have the systems\nlike I have, you have duplicators.\n\n1555\n01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:20,170\nActually, Logicube is known for this.\n\n1556\n01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:23,842\nThey have duplicators,\nyou can just plug the drive in and\n\n1557\n01:22:23,842 --> 01:22:29,580\nit will duplicate the drive in\na reasonable amount of time for you.\n\n1558\n01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:32,410\nSome of these things do like,\nthree gigs a minute.\n\n1559\n01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:35,950\nYou know the duplicate, so\nyou're gonna be on site for a while,\n\n1560\n01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:40,160\nbut it's still not bad\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1561\n01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,900\n>> How fast it goes\n\n1562\n01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:42,880\n>> Could be a lot worse,\n\n1563\n01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,700\nespecially as large as today's drives are.\n\n1564\n01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,570\nWe used to have a pretty sweet one,\nwhere you'd throw one drive in,\n\n1565\n01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:49,500\nyou could put like ten\ndrives underneath that and\n\n1566\n01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,722\nit would basically make ten copies of\nthat, you wouldn't need ten maybe,\n\n1567\n01:22:53,722 --> 01:22:56,590\nbut being able to duplicate a drive\nreally quick or in the field.\n\n1568\n01:22:56,590 --> 01:22:57,740\nDefinitely, something I've gotta do.\n\n1569\n01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,980\n>> They actually still\nhave those by the way.\n\n1570\n01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:00,520\n>> Do they?\n\n1571\n01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:01,150\n>> That you can bring.\n\n1572\n01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:04,220\nThat case.\n\n1573\n01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:06,541\nI think they look kinda\nlike a mini fridge.\n\n1574\n01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:09,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Take a grab and bring it with you.\n\n1575\n01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:14,130\nBut yeah, they have those and they\neven have special containers that look\n\n1576\n01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:18,010\nsomewhat the same that are used\nto transport those drives,\n\n1577\n01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:21,630\nbecause remember we were talking\nabout transportation needs and\n\n1578\n01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:25,220\nmaking sure that equipment doesn't\nget bounced around and all that.\n\n1579\n01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:29,490\nWell, they have these things that\ncan carry 10 to 15 drives and\n\n1580\n01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:32,530\neach one has their own little\npadded thing inside of it,\n\n1581\n01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:35,990\nand then you can lock it up, and\nthere are while you're transporting it.\n\n1582\n01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:39,950\nSo, they've got old toys like that, if\nyou're gonna be putting this in the back\n\n1583\n01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:45,110\nof your car, or\na specifically setup vehicle for this.\n\n1584\n01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:45,810\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1585\n01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:48,140\nI know you don't want to\njust tape them all together.\n\n1586\n01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,870\nThrow it in a box or something.\n\n1587\n01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:51,590\n>> You''re gonna do it.\n\n1588\n01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:55,050\nSometimes, you gotta\nwork with what you have.\n\n1589\n01:23:55,050 --> 01:24:00,910\nBut you know, but they do have this\nfancier stuff, if you want it.\n\n1590\n01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:03,180\nBut heck, who knows.\n\n1591\n01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:05,690\nSome people might just go out and\ngrab a pelican case.\n\n1592\n01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:08,880\nThrow some padding at it and say,\nthat's my transporter stuff.\n\n1593\n01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,390\nTotally fine.\n\n1594\n01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:10,890\nAs long as you keep saying save.\n\n1595\n01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:14,130\n>> As long as that drive remains intact\nand you get it back to the shop and it's\n\n1596\n01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:17,410\nstill readable and everything's working,\nthen your transport method is okay.\n\n1597\n01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,230\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n1598\n01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:22,120\n>> I notice, you mentioned\nsomething called a Paraben, and\n\n1599\n01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,512\nI was wondering, not familiar with that.\n\n1600\n01:24:24,512 --> 01:24:29,460\n>> Paraben is actually a company that\nmakes a lot of different things.\n\n1601\n01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:35,350\nSome of you, I've seen already\nmention that, in the chat room.\n\n1602\n01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:38,190\nYou mentioned Paraben.\n\n1603\n01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:41,260\nParaben makes a lot of\ndifferent equipment and\n\n1604\n01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:46,460\nwe're gonna actually take a look at some\nof those pieces of equipment in here.\n\n1605\n01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:51,190\nThey have stuff for going mobile,\nthey have stuff for,\n\n1606\n01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:53,370\nyou have a lot of different requirements.\n\n1607\n01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:56,650\nDrive duplicators,\nthings to isolate devices.\n\n1608\n01:24:56,650 --> 01:25:00,290\nThey even have something that looks\nlike you're working with radio isotopes.\n\n1609\n01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:02,200\nI swear it does.\n\n1610\n01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:10,270\nThey've got one, that's got a case that's\ngot the big holes in the side, like this.\n\n1611\n01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:12,780\nAnd they've got the gloves on it.\n\n1612\n01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:16,100\nYou put it in and\nyou can work with the stuff through there.\n\n1613\n01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,450\n>> Okay.\n>> It's designed to shield everything.\n\n1614\n01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:19,510\nThe case shields everything,\n\n1615\n01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:23,860\nso it keeps you from having to work out\nwith stuff in the open, especially if\n\n1616\n01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:26,840\nyou can't take it back to the lab where\nyou do have all the shielding built in.\n\n1617\n01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:31,970\nYou can do this in the field,\nit's kinda funny.\n\n1618\n01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:34,240\n>> I can see the needs for\na very large van.\n\n1619\n01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:39,720\n>> Yeah, you could very well\nhave one of those vans,\n\n1620\n01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:42,846\nhave it decked out like the ectomobile\nlike that driving around.\n\n1621\n01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:47,580\nYou can do that and it's not unheard of,\n\n1622\n01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:54,360\nit had to have for companies that do\nthis professionally, as an outsourcer.\n\n1623\n01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,380\nOr to have an enterprise organization just\n\n1624\n01:25:57,380 --> 01:26:00,620\nstock up a van with all\nthe stuff they need.\n\n1625\n01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:03,340\nAnd so,\nit's basically an instant response team.\n\n1626\n01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:04,890\nThat they get the call, and they're going.\n\n1627\n01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:07,920\nHeck, some of these things,\nthey can actually load onto aircraft.\n\n1628\n01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,670\nThey can just shove it in there and go.\n\n1629\n01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:15,180\n>> We're off to where we need to, drop it\noff, roll it out and get it to the field.\n\n1630\n01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,300\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n1631\n01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:19,770\n>> That's where we'll need all\nkinds of hard drives, cables.\n\n1632\n01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:22,340\nWe've got our optical media\nthat we gotta worry about.\n\n1633\n01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:26,000\nIf we're gonna be mobile,\nthat adds another twist to it.\n\n1634\n01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,880\nWe gotta think about what\ndo I need in the field?\n\n1635\n01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,860\nFor transporting stuff back to the lab, or\n\n1636\n01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:34,920\npossibly trying to do some\nanalysis out there in the field.\n\n1637\n01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,460\nOther things we might worry about, cards,\n\n1638\n01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,620\ndifferent types of cards that\nwe could have in our computer.\n\n1639\n01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:41,380\n>> Yeah,\nthat's another pretty straightforward one,\n\n1640\n01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:44,160\nwhen you look at it,\nis different adapter cards.\n\n1641\n01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:47,870\nRAID controllers you mentioned,\nthat would fit in that category.\n\n1642\n01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:53,600\nJust having things that you would need\nto either replace stuff or to be able to\n\n1643\n01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,090\nplug a drive or peripheral into what you\nhave back at the lab that needs testing.\n\n1644\n01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:03,960\nIt's also, by the way, something I\nsaw you post Harbin up there and\n\n1645\n01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,090\nI know probably a lot of\nyou are looking at it.\n\n1646\n01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:08,700\nSomething else to mention for\n\n1647\n01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:13,140\nmobile is there's another company\ncalled Digital Intelligence, out there.\n\n1648\n01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:18,258\nAnd Digital Intelligence makes\nforensic workstations as well\n\n1649\n01:27:18,258 --> 01:27:24,542\nboth ones that are designed for fixed\nlocations, plus ones that are mobile.\n\n1650\n01:27:24,542 --> 01:27:28,863\nYou can,\nyou can find these workstations out there,\n\n1651\n01:27:28,863 --> 01:27:32,895\nthere actually pretty nice,\nyou know, you saw,\n\n1652\n01:27:32,895 --> 01:27:37,791\nyou saw the one that I had that's\nIt's a pretty decent size,\n\n1653\n01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:43,110\nand I know you can't tell\nthe weight by seeing it on a video.\n\n1654\n01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:50,650\nBut it's probably clocking in at around\n40 pounds, maybe a little bit more.\n\n1655\n01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:52,997\nSo portability is, it's a question.\n\n1656\n01:27:52,997 --> 01:27:53,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes,\n\n1657\n01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:56,350\nit has a handle on it,\nthat's what they mean.\n\n1658\n01:27:56,350 --> 01:28:01,040\nWhich was great in Sacramento, when I\ngave it to the lady, she's like you're\n\n1659\n01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,410\ngoing to have to check that at\nthe ticket counter, or at the gate.\n\n1660\n01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:07,000\nAnd, I'm like okay, do you want\nme to put it over there for you?\n\n1661\n01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,660\nAnd she's like no, no, I got it.\n\n1662\n01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:12,546\nAnd she takes off the counter,\n\n1663\n01:28:12,546 --> 01:28:16,969\n[NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah, and-\n>> Deceptively heavy.\n\n1664\n01:28:16,969 --> 01:28:20,805\n>> Yeah, she was like,\nwhat do you got in here?\n\n1665\n01:28:20,805 --> 01:28:26,235\nSo those things aren't really all\nthat light, but Digital Intelligence\n\n1666\n01:28:26,235 --> 01:28:32,130\nis just one of the companies that has\nthese FRED line of systems that they got.\n\n1667\n01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:36,930\nBut they've got like I said\nthe standard desktop and\n\n1668\n01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:40,420\ntower systems then they\nhave these laptop systems.\n\n1669\n01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:43,100\nAnd the laptop systems\nare pretty capable and\n\n1670\n01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:48,890\nthey can do a lot of the stuff that\nthe kit, that I had showed, I can do.\n\n1671\n01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:52,710\n>> A lot of different specs depending\non how much you wanna spend and\n\n1672\n01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:54,500\nwhat you're going to need it for.\n\n1673\n01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,600\n>> Yeah, and that's the thing,\nthe stuff is expensive.\n\n1674\n01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,200\nBut you can look it up I don't have\na link in front of me right now,\n\n1675\n01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,030\nbut you can also look it up.\n\n1676\n01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:10,000\nSans has a guide on creating\nforensic work stations, so\n\n1677\n01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:16,860\nif you want to create your own,\nif you feel so inclined and, go for it.\n\n1678\n01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,430\nEspecially if you know your hardware and\nall that,\n\n1679\n01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:22,060\nit shouldn't be too hard for you,\nyou are gonna be able to build it,\n\n1680\n01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:27,240\ncheaper than you would be able\nto purchase something outright.\n\n1681\n01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:30,518\n>> Yeah, I'll give you guys that link,\nI downloaded that last night,\n\n1682\n01:29:30,518 --> 01:29:34,606\nI haven't had a chance to fire it up yet,\nbut it's pretty sweet from what I've seen.\n\n1683\n01:29:34,606 --> 01:29:36,100\nSans obviously very trusted.\n\n1684\n01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:38,170\nAnd it's basically, you install Ubuntu,\n\n1685\n01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:41,920\nI think they said Ubuntu 14 I\nthink is what they're on now.\n\n1686\n01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,330\nYou install that on a workstation,\nand then you download this,\n\n1687\n01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:48,170\nthey call it SIFT, their SANS institute.\n\n1688\n01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:52,190\nForensic tool kit and\nyou run that on top of that Ubuntu and\n\n1689\n01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:56,000\nit brings in all the packages and all\nthe things for the the different tools we\n\n1690\n01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,710\nmight be using in forensic so pretty sweet\ntake a look at that guys because that's\n\n1691\n01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:03,260\nsomething you can get for\nfree right and free is always good.\n\n1692\n01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:05,940\nYou don't have to create an account you\ndon't have to give them an email address,\n\n1693\n01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:07,720\nor something like that before\nyou can download it, and\n\n1694\n01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:10,700\nthat's all it takes and\ndownload that and see what you've got.\n\n1695\n01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:15,190\n>> Yeah, it's neat that you can\ncreate your own station that easily.\n\n1696\n01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:18,360\nWell, being a relative term create\nthat easily, you're going to\n\n1697\n01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:22,640\nhave to get the hardware and put it\ntogether and do the testing, and all that.\n\n1698\n01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:26,790\nBut one of the things that we\nare looking for is when you look at\n\n1699\n01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:30,280\nsolutions like Paraben's,\nDigital Intelligence, plus there's others.\n\n1700\n01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:33,290\nThere's like ImageMaster and\na whole bunch of Logicube.\n\n1701\n01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:36,580\nA whole bunch of hardware systems\nthat are sitting out there.\n\n1702\n01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:42,290\nOne of the reasons why they cost so much\nis not just how well they do their jobs.\n\n1703\n01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:47,130\nBut also because they're considered to be\ntrusted systems, and so that's important.\n\n1704\n01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:51,640\nWe don't have that reliability and that\ntrustability with that stuff we use for\n\n1705\n01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:55,770\nforensics because we know what that\nmeans in the bottom line on our case.\n\n1706\n01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:58,830\nThe Sans one,\nwhat's good about that one is, is yeah,\n\n1707\n01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:02,205\nlike you said, stands as trusted and\nknown organization.\n\n1708\n01:31:02,205 --> 01:31:06,270\nSans, if you use their stuff, well,\nheck, if it comes down to it, and\n\n1709\n01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:09,180\nsomeone asks where did you come\nup with that configuration.\n\n1710\n01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:11,800\nSans, configuration.\n\n1711\n01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,870\nYou can spec it out right now.\n\n1712\n01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:14,700\nYou can rip it apart and\nlook to see what's in there.\n\n1713\n01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,220\nI used exactly what they said.\n\n1714\n01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:18,210\n>> Not too much you can say about that,\nright.\n\n1715\n01:31:18,210 --> 01:31:19,540\nAnd that's always what we're looking for.\n\n1716\n01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:22,840\nThere are lots of tools out there that\nwe could get that could do the job.\n\n1717\n01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:25,470\nThere's a lot of free forensic tools and\nthings like that.\n\n1718\n01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:28,720\nAnd they might do the job just fine but\nthe problem comes down to,\n\n1719\n01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:31,810\nis it accepted by the court systems,\nif we're doing criminal cases?\n\n1720\n01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:35,840\nAnd if they can't accept it, if that's\nnot something that's been proven and\n\n1721\n01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:39,990\ntested and trusted,\nthey're not gonna accept or\n\n1722\n01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:42,350\nvalidate that evidence\nthat you're presenting.\n\n1723\n01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:43,700\nAnd it's not gonna work.\n\n1724\n01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:46,610\nAnd that's what makes\nit sometimes difficult.\n\n1725\n01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:50,600\nCuz you've got to have things like\nin case or these other places,\n\n1726\n01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,820\nbecause Sans is free that's pretty sweet,\nand like you said everybody knows Sans, so\n\n1727\n01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:56,400\nit's gonna be a trusted\nin a course most likely.\n\n1728\n01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,070\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1729\n01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:00,270\n>> All right.\n\n1730\n01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:03,160\nSo we've got our laptops.\n\n1731\n01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,580\nThat's another thing\nwe want to talk about.\n\n1732\n01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:08,580\nAnd really, we've kind of been\ntalking about that the whole time.\n\n1733\n01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:11,850\nBut having that global workstation because\nyou've got your workstation back at\n\n1734\n01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:16,060\nthe forensics lab, but\nwhat if I've gotta work in the field?\n\n1735\n01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:19,310\nI've gotta be able to work out there, so\n\n1736\n01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:22,190\nsame kind of consideration,\nSean, as far as laptops.\n\n1737\n01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:24,920\nMaking sure I've got lots of ports and\nthings like that?\n\n1738\n01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,250\n>> Yeah, same type of thing,\n\n1739\n01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,510\nthe additional thing you'd\nthrow in in the field is.\n\n1740\n01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:32,640\n>> Look at the environment\nyou're working in.\n\n1741\n01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,500\nDepending on the environment you're\nworking in, getting something.\n\n1742\n01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:40,800\nI have this computer set up here to be\nkind of like forensic stuff for this week.\n\n1743\n01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,370\nAnd it actually would work in a lot\nof cases as a forensic stations.\n\n1744\n01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:49,080\nBecause all I do on here is my\nsecurity work and stuff like that.\n\n1745\n01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:50,627\nSo, I don't do any web browser.\n\n1746\n01:32:50,627 --> 01:32:52,161\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Or surf the Internet, or\n\n1747\n01:32:52,161 --> 01:32:55,520\ncheck your emails or\nanything like that on there.\n\n1748\n01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,280\n>> Yeah, that doesn't happen here.\n\n1749\n01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:02,040\nSo this could technically be used for\nthat and\n\n1750\n01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:07,280\nthe results would say, well if they audit\nit in a court of law they say well yeah.\n\n1751\n01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,900\nNothing else's been done on it's\nbeen held strictly for that.\n\n1752\n01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:14,420\nNow, the reason why this one may\nnot be good out in the field\n\n1753\n01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:17,360\nversus another one is\nthe environment you're working in.\n\n1754\n01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:21,670\nIf the environment you're working\nin is a rougher environment, or\n\n1755\n01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:26,120\nthe way you're transporting stuff in or\nmoving it.\n\n1756\n01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:29,110\nWhat if you do have to move stuff by\n>> By pointing out in the field\n\n1757\n01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:31,260\nsomeplace to check things out.\n\n1758\n01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:33,598\nYou probably want to get\nsome ruggedized equipment.\n\n1759\n01:33:33,598 --> 01:33:36,980\nAnd that 's where something\nlike maybe getting laptops,\n\n1760\n01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:41,640\nlike, Panasonic Toughbooks or\nsomething equivalent to that.\n\n1761\n01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,770\nI'm not saying,\nendorsing anything while we're up here.\n\n1762\n01:33:44,770 --> 01:33:47,990\nBut you kind of get the idea is that\nsomething like a Panasonic one.\n\n1763\n01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:51,130\nI mean you can run over those things and\nthey'll still run.\n\n1764\n01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:55,930\n>> They recently, the local enforcement\nagents for the county here recently\n\n1765\n01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:59,680\nput those out in all of their cruisers,\nand they're pretty impressive.\n\n1766\n01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,940\nYou go out and\nlook at some of the results.\n\n1767\n01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:02,424\nSome of the tests they've done.\n\n1768\n01:34:02,424 --> 01:34:03,690\nFire weapons at them.\n\n1769\n01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:05,890\n>> Things like that and\nthey're pretty dang rigged.\n\n1770\n01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:08,650\nThey're gonna cost you a pretty penny,\nthey're gonna double your\n\n1771\n01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:11,890\nprices of that laptop but\nif you work in that kind of environments,\n\n1772\n01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:13,750\nyou're gonna need something\nthat's gonna hold up.\n\n1773\n01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:18,973\nYou can't have your laptop crapping out\nbecause it got or something like that.\n\n1774\n01:34:18,973 --> 01:34:23,160\n>> I actually saw people drive\na military grade Humvee over one.\n\n1775\n01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:24,120\n>> Really?\n\n1776\n01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:24,940\n>> It still worked.\n\n1777\n01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:28,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just kinda like, okay.\n\n1778\n01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:29,760\n>> That's impressive stuff there.\n\n1779\n01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,545\n>> Get the tank out here,\nlet's try it again.\n\n1780\n01:34:31,545 --> 01:34:35,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, and then mobile device\n\n1781\n01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:39,430\nequipment, we kind of hit most of that,\nanything else we want to throw in there?\n\n1782\n01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:42,710\n>> This would be a little\ndifferent than we had before.\n\n1783\n01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,560\nWe were talking about mobile equipment\nbefore as kind of something you would have\n\n1784\n01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,490\nto transport that makes\nit easy to transport.\n\n1785\n01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:50,133\nThis is for\nactually checking multiple devices.\n\n1786\n01:34:50,133 --> 01:34:53,230\n>> For like cellphones and\nthings like that.\n\n1787\n01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:57,200\n>> If those are part of your environment\nand become part of your investigation.\n\n1788\n01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,830\nThen you need the actual bags for\n\n1789\n01:34:59,830 --> 01:35:03,580\nthat that you can throw it in there and\nkeep it isolated.\n\n1790\n01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:07,070\nStuff for tablets too, those type\nof things are gonna come into play.\n\n1791\n01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:11,660\nAnd there's stuff to read sim cards,\nand what have you.\n\n1792\n01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:16,560\nYou could find lots of those things, but\nthe thing is, is a lot of those things for\n\n1793\n01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,640\nextracting devices off mobile phones,\na lot of them can be specialized.\n\n1794\n01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:26,391\nYou do have some that are universal\n>> And depending on the device you have,\n\n1795\n01:35:26,391 --> 01:35:30,559\nit will dictate how much\ninformation you get out of it.\n\n1796\n01:35:30,559 --> 01:35:33,818\nHow easily you can get out of it.\n\n1797\n01:35:33,818 --> 01:35:38,438\nFor example,\niPhones are notoriously chatty and\n\n1798\n01:35:38,438 --> 01:35:41,730\ninsecure as far as forensics go.\n\n1799\n01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:44,805\nForensics, you can extract so\nmuch stuff off of them.\n\n1800\n01:35:44,805 --> 01:35:46,040\n>> [LAUGH] It's Apple!\n\n1801\n01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:46,920\nIt just works.\n\n1802\n01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:48,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> Including for the bad guys, or\n\n1803\n01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:51,160\nthe forensic guys,\nwhen they wanna get the information off.\n\n1804\n01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,159\nHere!\nHere you go [LAUGH].\n\n1805\n01:35:53,159 --> 01:35:56,210\n>> Yeah, it was designed for convenience.\n\n1806\n01:35:56,210 --> 01:36:00,140\nWe've had the discussion in the CEH\nclass about security versus convenience,\n\n1807\n01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:01,828\nyou sacrifice one for the other.\n\n1808\n01:36:01,828 --> 01:36:05,960\nSo, Apple makes a great phone but\n\n1809\n01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:09,560\nsecurity is kind of, at least,\na little bit to be desired.\n\n1810\n01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,600\nSo, yeah, and that's not me.\n\n1811\n01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,500\nThat's not opinion, that's fact.\n\n1812\n01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,845\nJust to kinda go back\nto yesterday's stuff.\n\n1813\n01:36:16,845 --> 01:36:18,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can look it up.\n\n1814\n01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:22,070\n>> [LAUGH] So,\na lot of different types of equipment.\n\n1815\n01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:25,960\nAnd I can see where that mobile device\nequipment could eat up a large chunk of my\n\n1816\n01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:32,400\nbudget because like you said, it's not\nlike I got Windows or Apple, or Linux.\n\n1817\n01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,740\nI've got all kinds of brands.\n\n1818\n01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,160\nDifferent charging units required.\n\n1819\n01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,280\nDifferent ways to access them,\nthings like that.\n\n1820\n01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:39,500\nDifferent operation systems to work with.\n\n1821\n01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:40,920\nSo-\n>> Maybe, different models of\n\n1822\n01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:41,490\nthe same thing.\n\n1823\n01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:42,930\n>> Absolutely.\n>> That's one\n\n1824\n01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,330\nof the crazy things about it.\n\n1825\n01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:49,900\n>> So, a lot of good info there,\nwhat about auditing,\n\n1826\n01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:52,700\nis another thing we probably wanna\ntalk about here, at this point.\n\n1827\n01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:56,612\n>> Yeah, this is just a quick\nline item on this thing so far,\n\n1828\n01:36:56,612 --> 01:37:01,746\nis that we've talked about getting all\nthe equipment, setting up a lab and\n\n1829\n01:37:01,746 --> 01:37:06,006\nall those good things,\nyou have to be prepared to be audited.\n\n1830\n01:37:06,006 --> 01:37:09,541\nThat very well could happen and\nshould happen that you should\n\n1831\n01:37:09,541 --> 01:37:13,075\nbe periodically checked at least\nby your internal people and\n\n1832\n01:37:13,075 --> 01:37:17,786\nhopefully get someone externally now and\nthen to kind of take a good look at things\n\n1833\n01:37:17,786 --> 01:37:22,540\nto make sure the standards are still\nbeing upheld and we have any problems.\n\n1834\n01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:27,190\nThat we have it initially set up a lab\nwith all these great intentions, and\n\n1835\n01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:31,540\nit was forensically sound, and secure and\nall that, and then just normal wear and\n\n1836\n01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:35,780\ntear and operational use,\nit busts out of that.\n\n1837\n01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:39,110\nWe wanna know that before an attorney or\n\n1838\n01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:41,780\nsomething that's trying to\nchallenge a result finds it.\n\n1839\n01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:43,360\nWe can't have that.\n\n1840\n01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:47,740\nSo, you're gonna have to have\nsome from of auditing in place.\n\n1841\n01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:48,910\nWhere they're checking logs,\n\n1842\n01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:52,640\nwhere they're checking the location,\nchecking the equipment.\n\n1843\n01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,170\nAll those things gonna be done.\n\n1844\n01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:56,890\nI've already talked about checklists and\n\n1845\n01:37:56,890 --> 01:38:00,880\nstuff like that in here to make sure\nthat you're doing things, specific ways.\n\n1846\n01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:04,930\nThere should be checklists and\nschedules for doing audits.\n\n1847\n01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:07,850\n>> And we're not talking\nabout us auditing ourselves.\n\n1848\n01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:10,690\nWe're typically talking about a third\nparty that comes in, somebody\n\n1849\n01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:14,030\nthat's neutral, somebody that can give\na good honest opinion about everything.\n\n1850\n01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:16,670\nOr possibly somebody that everybody knows.\n\n1851\n01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:20,450\nSo, that when you can say, I was audited\nby these people, cuz if I go out there and\n\n1852\n01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:21,670\nthen go to that courtroom, I say, well,\n\n1853\n01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:24,475\nI was audited by Mike Rodrick,\nthey're like, who?\n\n1854\n01:38:24,475 --> 01:38:26,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, Mike says we're good.\n\n1855\n01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:30,770\nIt does need to be somebody that\ncan give you that certification for\n\n1856\n01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:32,580\nmaking sure everything-\n>> Dude, you're a TV star.\n\n1857\n01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:33,550\nWe can trust you.\n\n1858\n01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:34,400\n>> Yeah.\n\n1859\n01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,350\n>> Look at that face.\n\n1860\n01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:36,473\nLook at that you can trust that.\n\n1861\n01:38:36,473 --> 01:38:40,710\n>> [LAUGH] Well,\nSean a lot of great information.\n\n1862\n01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:42,780\nWe've still got more to go but\n\n1863\n01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:46,260\nwe are going to break this up under two\nparts because setting up a forensics lab,\n\n1864\n01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,840\nthere's a lot of things that\nwe've gotta understand.\n\n1865\n01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:53,651\nSo, anything else we wanna\nthrow in this first part?\n\n1866\n01:38:53,651 --> 01:38:58,240\n>> No I don't wanna say anything else,\nwe can throw in this first part.\n\n1867\n01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,700\nWe're gonna have a lot of good\nstuff in our second part two.\n\n1868\n01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:07,130\nWe did a lot of neat stuff\nhere to quench you with it.\n\n1869\n01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:09,650\nThe second part,\nif you're kinda wondering what's ahead,\n\n1870\n01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:13,530\nwe are gonna be introducing the hardware\nand taking a look at some of it.\n\n1871\n01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:18,360\nAnd then, we're talking about and\nlooking at some of the software, and\n\n1872\n01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:20,860\nso you could start\ngetting your hands on it.\n\n1873\n01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:22,280\nSo, that's our goal.\n\n1874\n01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:25,440\nSo, if you wanna route what's coming\nahead in part two, that's kinda it.\n\n1875\n01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,630\n>> Yeah, so\nmake sure you check back in with that.\n\n1876\n01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:28,990\nThat's gonna be a great episode.\n\n1877\n01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:29,588\n>> Stay tuned.\n\n1878\n01:39:29,588 --> 01:39:30,320\n>> That's right.\n\n1879\n01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:31,751\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's our cliffhanger for\n\n1880\n01:39:31,751 --> 01:39:32,746\nthe end of this episode.\n\n1881\n01:39:32,746 --> 01:39:34,928\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\nthanks for tuning in.\n\n1882\n01:39:34,928 --> 01:39:37,430\nWe appreciate you guys joining us and\nwatching.\n\n1883\n01:39:37,430 -->

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,300\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV,\nI'm your hose Mike Broderick, and\n\n6\n00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,400\nwith me today is Mr.\nSean Oriyano, how are you doing Sean?\n\n7\n00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,790\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n8\n00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,370\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,020\nWe are doing our digital forensic\ninvestigator episodes and\n\n10\n00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,920\nin this one we're going\nto be doing our computer,\n\n11\n00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,220\nif I can say that,\ncomputer forensics lab part two.\n\n12\n00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,080\nSo if you missed part one,\nmake sure you go back and watch that.\n\n13\n00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,590\nWe've already discussed a lot of things\nlike the hardware side of things.\n\n14\n00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,340\nWhat we would need to set up that lab.\n\n15\n00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,260\nFacilities, HR, you know,\nyour Human Resources and things like that.\n\n16\n00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,855\nIn part two, we're gonna start off talking\nabout some of the software that we might\n\n17\n00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:17,545\nneed or would like to have available\nin our computer forensics lab.\n\n18\n00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:21,485\nSo sit back and relax and\nlet's enjoy this ride.\n\n19\n00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:22,395\nSo where are we starting,\n\n20\n00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:25,880\nSean, I know there's a lot of really\ncool software out there that we're\n\n21\n00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,470\ngonna want to have available so\nwe can do our proper investigation.\n\n22\n00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,870\nAnd where do we even start?\n\n23\n00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,950\n>> You know there's really as far as\nsoftware goes no one place to start,\n\n24\n00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,285\nso we're just gonna start in\nan order that seemed good to me.\n\n25\n00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:45,250\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n26\n00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,800\n>> You know, that's the way it is.\n\n27\n00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,675\nThis is favorite to least favorite or?\n\n28\n00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,940\n[LAUGH] We're just doing it alphabetical.\n\n29\n00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,670\nAll this stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,980\nNo particular order then.\n\n31\n00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,760\nWe're just gonna kind of go and\ntalk about all the different stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,580\n>> Yeah.\nThat's pretty much the way it is.\n\n33\n00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,880\nThe thing I think is important to\npreface this whole thing with,\n\n34\n00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,760\nis that we're going to talk about\na lot of software in here, we\n\n35\n00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,680\nare gonna start investigating hardware\nas well in a bit, but what we have,\n\n36\n00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,080\nthe stuff we have here,\nyou may not ever need to get it all.\n\n37\n00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,260\nYou could potentially\noutsource a lot of this stuff,\n\n38\n00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,240\nit all depends on what your expectations\nare, what your scope of authority and\n\n39\n00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,020\nall that is, but the stuff here\nthat we're talking about is fairly\n\n40\n00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,540\nstandard that you would be expected to\nhave something like this in some way,\n\n41\n00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,920\nshape or form in your environment,\nin your lab.\n\n42\n00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,580\n>> Yeah and so a lot of these things\nyou're gonna see we've got a lot of\n\n43\n00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,690\ndifferent types of software,\n\n44\n00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,450\nsome of this software does the same thing,\nlike for imaging,\n\n45\n00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,130\nthere's several different types of\nsoftware I can use to image a hard drive.\n\n46\n00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,060\nWhich one you use might depend on several\nfactors, like what some of the features,\n\n47\n00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,520\nwhat some of the extra features are.\n\n48\n00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,620\nThey probably all image a hard drive.\n\n49\n00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,420\nBut some of them might have additional\nbells and whistles that you want.\n\n50\n00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,220\nOr maybe some of them don't have those and\nthat's what you want.\n\n51\n00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,930\nAnother thing that could come into\nplay is gonna be price, right?\n\n52\n00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,100\nBecause some of them might be\nmore expensive than others.\n\n53\n00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,004\nAnd then a big one that's going to come\ninto play most likely is whether or\n\n54\n00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:13,100\nnot it's trusted.\n\n55\n00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,083\n>> There you go.\n>> Whether or\n\n56\n00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:18,190\nnot it's recognized as\na sound forensics tool.\n\n57\n00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,720\nI think it's probably one of\nthe biggest things that we\n\n58\n00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,430\nalways have to keep in mind.\n\n59\n00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,490\n>> Yeah definitely, that would be a key\n\n60\n00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,689\nthing in this is this improvable\ntechnology doesn't have a track record.\n\n61\n00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,840\nAs showing that it can get the job done,\nis it accepted by the community?\n\n62\n00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,600\nThose are good things and it's become\nespecially important when you're talking\n\n63\n00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,700\nabout images, I see Deborah here\ntalking about F T K autopsy and\n\n64\n00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,160\nthere's a bunch of those, that's stuff\nwe're gonna talk about in a bit.\n\n65\n00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,470\nBut stuff like that, yeah,\ndefinitely they've got a track record.\n\n66\n00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,000\n>> We could go out and\n\n67\n00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,010\nI could get ImageX, for Microsoft and\nI could make an image of a hard drive.\n\n68\n00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,820\nNow, whether that's forensically sound,\nand\n\n69\n00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,800\nI can use that in a court of\nlaw is a different story.\n\n70\n00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,950\nSo, there's an example of where you've\ngot something that can do the job, but\n\n71\n00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,700\nyou probably don't want to use it\nbecause if it ends up going criminal,\n\n72\n00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,658\nI might not be able to present that now.\n\n73\n00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:20,000\n>> Yeah, that's 100% correct is\nthat this stuff has to be trusted\n\n74\n00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,690\nbecause the end result is that you may\nvery well have to present this in court.\n\n75\n00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,910\nYou may very well need to just have this\nprepared for that eventuality In any case.\n\n76\n00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,950\nSo you need to have trusted tools or tools\nthat results are provable and verifiable.\n\n77\n00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,230\nSo those are key things.\n\n78\n00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,100\nI mean some of these disc imaging\ntechnologies that you have on the market.\n\n79\n00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,750\nThey're designed to, well,\n\n80\n00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,320\nthey're designed to image a drive and\nclone it to another one.\n\n81\n00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,440\nThey're not designed to do to make it so\n\n82\n00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,420\nthey can verify it and\nall that good stuff.\n\n83\n00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,510\nThat's another level, and they don't\nnecessarily need to have something\n\n84\n00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,390\nforensically verifiable in a normal\nIT department to do an imaging.\n\n85\n00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,620\n>> Some of these tools create great logs\nand notes for us of the process that's\n\n86\n00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,020\ngoing on, and like you say,\nif I'm just imaging a computer so\n\n87\n00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,240\nI can deploy that out to another 500\nclients, I don't really need that.\n\n88\n00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,220\nBut if I'm doing forensics,\nI gotta take it to the next level.\n\n89\n00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,470\nSo that was probably a good segue,\nsince we started talking about imaging,\n\n90\n00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,090\nlet's start there with software.\n\n91\n00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,820\nAll kinds of different\nsoftware we can use to image.\n\n92\n00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,100\nWhat do we got on our list?\n\n93\n00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,280\n>> For imaging,\nthere's a lot of players in this category.\n\n94\n00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:40,900\nNow, I should say,\nas we're starting to get into software,\n\n95\n00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,200\nI am going to both show you some\nsites that have the software.\n\n96\n00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,005\nI already have the software downloaded\non mine in a lot of cases, and\n\n97\n00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:54,900\nwe're gonna be actually using\nthose from here on out.\n\n98\n00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,010\nSo this is also an opportunity for me not\njust to tell you the different categories\n\n99\n00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,220\nof tools and what's in there, but also to\ngive you a chance to maybe download or\n\n100\n00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,240\nget a hold of some of these tools.\n\n101\n00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,140\nSo you can even play along while I'm\ntalking about this stuff if that's\n\n102\n00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,350\nyour choice or you want to experiment\nlater on, you'll have some of\n\n103\n00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,190\nthe tools that we showed here so\nyou can kinda look at a video and\n\n104\n00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,030\nsee what I did and then go ahead and\ntry it on your own.\n\n105\n00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,870\nThat was my kind of intention here.\n\n106\n00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,850\nBut don't take the tools, by any means,\n\n107\n00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,010\nthe stuff that we're talking about,\nas the only option in town.\n\n108\n00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:33,490\nYou could find, for imaging for example,\nthere's a lot of tools that do imaging.\n\n109\n00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,280\nThere's a lot of those tools\nthat do forensic level imaging.\n\n110\n00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,120\nBut I do not have them all on my list,\nI'm not even gonna attempt that.\n\n111\n00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,360\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n112\n00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,800\nSo-\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n113\n00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,650\nThere, then again, it's all about\nfinding the one that, first of all,\n\n114\n00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,590\nsolves whatever your needs are.\n\n115\n00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,720\nMaking sure that it's forensically sound,\nand then price, and\n\n116\n00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,560\nthen, you might have a preference\nwith one vendor or the other.\n\n117\n00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,000\nOr your company might have a contract\nwith one vendor or the other.\n\n118\n00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,700\nLike if you're already buying Symantec as\na company for your anti-virus solution,\n\n119\n00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,630\nthat maybe it makes sense to go with\nGhost as an imaging solution for that.\n\n120\n00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,170\nBut if you're not with Symantec already,\nmaybe you choose to go another route.\n\n121\n00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,240\nAnd as Sean said,\ndefinitively not an all inclusive list.\n\n122\n00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,260\nYou just have to try them,\nsee which one works best for\n\n123\n00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,540\nyou and which one fits your scenario.\n\n124\n00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,790\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n125\n00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,699\nKick the tires of some of these things and\nsee what you think.\n\n126\n00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,612\nSomething else I'd also put in there,\nwhen you look at the software,\n\n127\n00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:36,459\nI try to choose as much as possible\nstuff that was free but well known.\n\n128\n00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:40,912\nThat would be another cool thing about\nforensics is that you can find a lot\n\n129\n00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:45,365\nof tools that are free, so that budget\nwe talked about in the first part,\n\n130\n00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:49,964\nand trying to get the stuff you need,\nbut never having quite enough money,\n\n131\n00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:55,001\nif you can get a free option it's just as\ngood as the paid option and it's trusted,\n\n132\n00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:59,673\nthen you might as well just go with\nthe free version, is my feeling on it, but\n\n133\n00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:04,564\nIt's up to you, if you want to spend\nthe extra money on something that's paid,\n\n134\n00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:09,750\nhas a nice shiny sticker on it, says it's\nfrom whatever, then who am I to say that?\n\n135\n00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,480\n>> If you're one of those brand snobs.\n\n136\n00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,690\nYou've got to have it.\n\n137\n00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,815\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] All right so,\n\n138\n00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:20,555\nfor imaging, one of the first ones that\nobviously comes to my mind is ghost\n\n139\n00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:22,835\nnot that I'm a huge fan of it,\nI'll be honest.\n\n140\n00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:28,115\nBut, it is a popular one out there and\nwe know semantic from some of the other\n\n141\n00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:32,320\nproducts that they make, and it could\nbe why we don't know, I'm just teasing.\n\n142\n00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,290\n[LAUGH].\n>> I know where you're going with that.\n\n143\n00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,340\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, but\na ghost might be a good one.\n\n144\n00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,690\nWhen it comes to imaging we need something\nthat's gonna make that forensically sound\n\n145\n00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,530\ncopy of that data.\n\n146\n00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,810\nAnd remember we're\ntalking about verifiable.\n\n147\n00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,620\nRight.\nThat's the thing.\n\n148\n00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,590\nI need to make a verifiable copy.\n\n149\n00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,550\nSo whatever it is that I'm using\nneeds to make an exact copy.\n\n150\n00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,590\nWe can't have any bits here or\n\n151\n00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,570\nthere that didn't get copied or\nare not the same as the original.\n\n152\n00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,300\nWhat's some others, semantic, I'll throw\nsome links out there for these guys and\n\n153\n00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300\nI'll make sure they're\ndefinitely in the show notes.\n\n154\n00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,190\nI know I you guys are good at posting some\nlinks there as well, in our chat room.\n\n155\n00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:16,810\nSo Symantec,\nwhat else besides Symantec can we do here?\n\n156\n00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,090\n>> We've got Ghost out there\nif you wanna use that, but\n\n157\n00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,770\nwe also have there's on the Linux side,\nthe DD, the disc duplicator command.\n\n158\n00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,970\nBut then we have also have\nanother one just to mention\n\n159\n00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,160\nthe DCFLDD command in there.\n\n160\n00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,540\nWhich is, can produce forensically sound\nimages so that's a little variation of it.\n\n161\n00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,480\nYou can use DD and a lot of people do\nuse it in forensics as a Linux tool but\n\n162\n00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,590\nyou can use this other one as another,\n\n163\n00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,660\nas a forensically sound\ntool to create images.\n\n164\n00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,710\nNow these are commands that\nare available within Linux, or\n\n165\n00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,610\nthese are packages that\nhave to add to Linux?\n\n166\n00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,100\n>> They're either going to be built in or\nyou are going to have to add them.\n\n167\n00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,510\nOne of the two.\nIt depends on the distro you get.\n\n168\n00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,770\n>> Got you.\n\n169\n00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,650\n>> But they are usually available,\nin some way,\n\n170\n00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,530\nshape, or form,\nacross the board on those guys.\n\n171\n00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,390\nSo, other ones, I had mentioned a few.\n\n172\n00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,970\nSome other ones in here,\nthere's also hash cat.\n\n173\n00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,280\nHash cat, the reason why I mentioned that,\nthat's not really an imaging tool,\n\n174\n00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,210\nper say.\n\n175\n00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,020\nBut, it is something that comes\nin useful for imaging and\n\n176\n00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,420\nother areas because it can\ncreate hashes of files.\n\n177\n00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,240\nSo, you can hash a drive,\nhash the image, and you know,\n\n178\n00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,290\nhash individuals files, and\nhave a verifiable copy of a file.\n\n179\n00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,860\nSo that becomes critical.\n\n180\n00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,180\nWe know about the importance\nof integrity and\n\n181\n00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,450\nall that from all our security classes,\nintegrity plays a part here.\n\n182\n00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,270\nThis is a way of ensuring the integrity\nof an image, in this case.\n\n183\n00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,920\nSo you could very well\nuse that if you want.\n\n184\n00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,463\nAnd as Brian mentioned is that\nthere's tool that hash as they copy,\n\n185\n00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,200\nyeah, there are.\n\n186\n00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,090\nThis is just a hash just another\nthing that you can use if you want\n\n187\n00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,320\nsome of these tools don't\nhash as they copy or\n\n188\n00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,630\nthey don't hash in a way that's not\nsomething we wanna use forensically or\n\n189\n00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,610\nit's not as common there, so\nyou have another level you can use.\n\n190\n00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,270\nSo that's what that one would be.\n\n191\n00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,100\n>> Okay.\n>> There's another interesting\n\n192\n00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,430\nthing here I've put on my list,\njust to kinda put it out there.\n\n193\n00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,570\nI can put it in imaging, and I can also\nput it in an operating system utility.\n\n194\n00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:43,630\nAnd I put it in here because it's,\na standout.\n\n195\n00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,100\nIt's something that\nmight be useful to you.\n\n196\n00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:52,841\nIt's something called DriveSpy by\ndigital intelligence and it's not free.\n\n197\n00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:54,095\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n198\n00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:58,284\n>> What's [INAUDIBLE] the price on there\nis [CROSSTALK] $249 for commercial.\n\n199\n00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,960\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n200\n00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,040\nIf you're law enforcement, 199.\n\n201\n00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,480\n>> There we go, I get a discount.\n\n202\n00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,065\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n203\n00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:04,630\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n204\n00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,500\n>> Just claim you're law enforcement.\n\n205\n00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,630\n>> I'm sure they won't try to verify that.\n\n206\n00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,145\n>> Yeah, they'll never verify that.\n\n207\n00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,030\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n208\n00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,924\n>> And so, yeah.\n\n209\n00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:14,430\n>> [LAUGH] And what's so\nnice about DriveSpy?\n\n210\n00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,298\n>> Just tell you're part of the KISS Army,\nthat'll work.\n\n211\n00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:16,833\nYeah.\n\n212\n00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,027\n[LAUGH].\n\n213\n00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:19,610\n>> So, that was a real army.\n\n214\n00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,090\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH].\n\n215\n00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,770\n>> But, yeah, what DriveSpy, is DriveSpy,\n\n216\n00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:30,030\njust in case you've never encountered it,\nthat is a DOS utility.\n\n217\n00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,420\n>> Okay.\n>> And it's new.\n\n218\n00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,070\nIt actually goes in, and\nits starts doing stuff at the DOS level.\n\n219\n00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,850\nAnd you might ask why are we even\ntalking about stuff with DOS.\n\n220\n00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,040\nBecause DOS is still out there.\n\n221\n00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,890\nThat's why.\n\n222\n00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,700\nThat's about as far as\nI have to take that.\n\n223\n00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,548\nAnd DOS is showing up again in some\nplaces where it had disappeared before.\n\n224\n00:12:51,548 --> 00:12:56,630\nSo chances are you might\nrun into it if you're doing\n\n225\n00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,920\ninvestigations in certain spaces.\n\n226\n00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,330\nSo there's a utility that helps\nyou deal with that just in case.\n\n227\n00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,590\nI mean, it's no longer just Windows,\n\n228\n00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,980\na whole bunch of Lennox, the Mac OS and\nand UNIX and all that good stuff.\n\n229\n00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,460\nDOS is out there.\n\n230\n00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,720\nDOS is definitely being\nused in even new products.\n\n231\n00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,530\n>> Right.\n>> So, that's that.\n\n232\n00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,540\nAnd you could run imaging stuff on there,\nor\n\n233\n00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,770\nyou could run other commands in there, so.\n\n234\n00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,390\n>> Okay.\n\n235\n00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:26,970\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n236\n00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,260\na lot of good imaging software, then.\n\n237\n00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,000\nAgain, the main thing we're worried about\nwith that imaging software is Is one,\n\n238\n00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,120\nmaking sure that it's accepted by whatever\n\n239\n00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,580\nthe law enforcement agency\nis that you're dealing with.\n\n240\n00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,580\nAnd two, making sure that it makes\na good forensically sound copy\n\n241\n00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,330\nof that information.\n\n242\n00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,550\nAnd as we said earlier,\n\n243\n00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,300\nthere's choices Other than what\nwe're providing on this list.\n\n244\n00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,440\nAnother thing is that we've\ngot our imaging, right?\n\n245\n00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,800\nWe can image the drives, we can work\nwith the copy, files themselves.\n\n246\n00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,520\nSometimes we need to analyze those files,\nlooking at meta data for those files.\n\n247\n00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,440\n>> There ya go.\n>> And things like that.\n\n248\n00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,780\nYeah, once you have the image there's\nalso the stuff inside the image.\n\n249\n00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,560\nIf you have to deploy the image\nsomeplace else to do an analysis of it.\n\n250\n00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,760\nWhich, presumably, you are.\n\n251\n00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,380\nYou're not just gonna image it and\nsay okay I got it, you're gonna wanna\n\n252\n00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,620\ndig inside that image, deploy it and\ncheck to see what's going on.\n\n253\n00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,060\nWell, you've got all of\nthose files on there and\n\n254\n00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,230\nnow you have to look at the files\nthemselves as part of this process.\n\n255\n00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,760\nSo, there are some tools in here that\nI do think are worth mentioning.\n\n256\n00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,930\nOne of them is a utility called mediguful,\nit is available in Kaleigh.\n\n257\n00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,810\nIt's something that's out there.\n\n258\n00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,580\nIt's really good at viewing data.\n\n259\n00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,630\nYou know it's inside a file it's something\nthat we will be taking a look at and\n\n260\n00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,010\nhere a little later on we\nneed to view that neta data.\n\n261\n00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:03,790\nSo we want to grab that or\nhave a copy so you have it.\n\n262\n00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,496\nThat's something that's put on homework.\n\n263\n00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:07,392\nSo to speak.\n\n264\n00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:08,540\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n265\n00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,050\n>> As stuff to do.\n\n266\n00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:17,430\nSo we have that out there, and by the way,\nas far as the imaging stuff goes and\n\n267\n00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,920\nwhat you want to download in\nthere I'm not really big on\n\n268\n00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,130\ntelling you any one of those\nto download for the course.\n\n269\n00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,960\nThey're all fine options.\n\n270\n00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,480\nIt has nothing to do on that side of it.\n\n271\n00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,450\nI'm not gonna worry about sitting\nhere having you watch an image\n\n272\n00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,070\nactually take place.\n\n273\n00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,090\nThe documentation for\nall those is fairly straight forward.\n\n274\n00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,840\nMost people have used Ghost.\n\n275\n00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,831\nMost people have gone through\nthe imaging process, a handful of times.\n\n276\n00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:53,491\nAs long as you know what it is, or and\nhave even done it maybe a few times,\n\n277\n00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:54,102\nI'm good.\n\n278\n00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:57,795\nI'm not gonna go through\nthe whole imaging process here.\n\n279\n00:15:57,795 --> 00:15:59,954\nWe can spend.\n\n280\n00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:01,765\nTime during something else.\n\n281\n00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:05,443\n>> For you guys who are premium members,\nyou can always check out some of\n\n282\n00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:09,390\nthe other shows where we talk about\ncreating images and things like that.\n\n283\n00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,998\nSo make sure you look at your\nlibraries and find those.\n\n284\n00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:14,790\nAnd then come back and\nwatch our show again.\n\n285\n00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,440\n>> Good point.\n\n286\n00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,780\nThere are other resources\nthat ITProTV has too,\n\n287\n00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,640\nthat covers that much\nbetter than I could here.\n\n288\n00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,120\nSo we'll just focus on\nthe forensics part of it and\n\n289\n00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,890\ngo ahead and\ntake a look at that if you need to, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,400\nSo the file analysis, we have Metagoofil.\n\n291\n00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,950\nThere's also another one called\nPE Viewer that can dig into files.\n\n292\n00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:51,140\nThere are several PDF file viewers that\nyou can dig inside the PDF file and\n\n293\n00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:57,010\nsee information about it, and\nthere's other viewers out there that will\n\n294\n00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,700\nactually allow you to dig inside the file\nand tell you where it was created and all\n\n295\n00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,260\nthis other good stuff on it that doesn't\nnecessarily get pulled out of the file.\n\n296\n00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,550\nSo, it can tell you even\nwhere it was located.\n\n297\n00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,050\n>> Right.\n\n298\n00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,220\nSometimes these files can include\nGeo-tracking information, pictures,and\n\n299\n00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,220\nthings like that as we need to be\nable to extract that information out.\n\n300\n00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,321\n>> Which, by the way,\nyou mentioned the Geo-tracking stuff.\n\n301\n00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:23,240\nThe Geo-tracking is something that\nas far as hardware equipment goes,\n\n302\n00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,270\nsome labs are now starting to have\nspecialized GPS-enabled systems that\n\n303\n00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,530\nyou can analyze a file, and then those\ncords go right to the GPS and tell you\n\n304\n00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,270\nexactly the spot where it was created and\ndesigned specifically for that purpose.\n\n305\n00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,260\nI know it sounds like you can punch a cord\nand it's into a GPS and find a location on\n\n306\n00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,490\nthe face of the earth, oh big deal,\nwe've been doing that for years.\n\n307\n00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:52,000\nNo, yes, it's doing that, but\nit's doing it with a mind toward hey,\n\n308\n00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,970\nthis is the spot in the map right here\nin this building where this was created.\n\n309\n00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,100\n>> Nice.\n\n310\n00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,890\nYeah, that GPS is gonna get more and\nmore accurate as we get access to.\n\n311\n00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,790\nThey're just refining it,\ngetting it down to a meter or so, I think,\n\n312\n00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,400\neven with the publicly\navailable satellites,\n\n313\n00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,565\nnot that military stuff who\ncan access that unfortunately.\n\n314\n00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:12,255\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so\n\n315\n00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:13,255\nwe've gotta lot of other things.\n\n316\n00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:16,065\nOne of the things we might have\nto deal with, with file analysis,\n\n317\n00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:18,135\nproprietary file issues.\n\n318\n00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:22,542\nWhere we've got some file type that's\nproprietary to a single vendor.\n\n319\n00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:29,422\n>> Yeah, that's something you could very\nwell run into is this proprietary issue.\n\n320\n00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:33,362\nThere's a lot of vendors that make all\nsorts of software that does all sorts of\n\n321\n00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,222\ngreat things and\n\n322\n00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:39,662\nthat software creates a file type that\nthere's really not a open source viewer or\n\n323\n00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:43,500\na good open source or free viewer that\ncan get you the information you need.\n\n324\n00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,040\nSo if that's the case, if you're going\nto be examining situations like that,\n\n325\n00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,070\nyou may need to get some\nadditional viewers, or\n\n326\n00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,420\npay for\nsome additional viewers to do that.\n\n327\n00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,360\nOne that I think that's been, I don't know\nwhy, if it's just the luck of the draw,\n\n328\n00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,060\nwhatever, is mentioned as\na proprietary format in lot of\n\n329\n00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,830\nbooks is DWG format.\n\n330\n00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,020\nFor Auto Cat.\n\n331\n00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,160\nIt's an old A file type.\n\n332\n00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,270\nIt's still being used.\n\n333\n00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,313\nIt's been around since 84.\n\n334\n00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:25,920\nSo there is really not a good open\nsource viewer for that format.\n\n335\n00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,943\nThat gives you all the information that\nis being carried inside that file.\n\n336\n00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:37,840\nEven though several companies claim\n\n337\n00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,680\nthat they have one's that are pretty good\nat digging inside of them, they don't.\n\n338\n00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,650\nI can say with that file type, I worked\nfor Autodesk for about five years and\n\n339\n00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,970\nI worked with all those guys [LAUGH].\n\n340\n00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,170\n>> Google SketchUp, I think,\nmight access the dwg file but\n\n341\n00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,170\nnot give me access to everything that's\nin that file if I'm not mistaken.\n\n342\n00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:58,420\n>> They don't know and\nno one does it 100% like Autodesk does.\n\n343\n00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,215\nThey get close but not entirely, so\n\n344\n00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:06,430\nthat could be an issue for you.\n\n345\n00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,980\nNow Autodesk does release\nstuff that can do that.\n\n346\n00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,160\nThere are APIs available for that product,\n\n347\n00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,580\nthat you could technically do what\nyou could do with other products.\n\n348\n00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,260\nWhere you could write your own viewer,\n\n349\n00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,880\nif you've got somebody on\nstaff that can do that.\n\n350\n00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,568\nOr I can outsource it,\nmaybe you can pull that off but\n\n351\n00:20:25,568 --> 00:20:30,190\nthen again it comes back to the issue\nbefore, is it a trusted tool?\n\n352\n00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,440\nIs it something you just\nkinda grew yourself?\n\n353\n00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,500\nDo we have any way of verifying that?\n\n354\n00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,900\nYou can find a way to verify it but that's\nan extra step you gotta jump through.\n\n355\n00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,760\n>> Yeah, and it's not gonna happen\nduring that case, most likely.\n\n356\n00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,030\nIn the court of law or\n\n357\n00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,080\nwhere ever you might be because it has\nto be checked out, tested and approved.\n\n358\n00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,845\nTrusted by that court system so\nyou might be able to get it done,\n\n359\n00:20:51,845 --> 00:20:55,205\nprobably not gonna be forensically\nsound and accepted as evidence.\n\n360\n00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,385\nBut maybe over time,\nwith enough of it, you could.\n\n361\n00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,730\nSo if we're having these\nproprietary file issues,\n\n362\n00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:09,020\nwhat's someway I might if I can't get the\nactual software I could go buy Autocat.\n\n363\n00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,940\nIf it's a big case,\n\n364\n00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,500\nif I'm making money on this I need\nto open up these Autocat files.\n\n365\n00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,420\nI go to Autodesk and I buy it\n>> You could do that.\n\n366\n00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,700\n>> Is one way to do it.\n\n367\n00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,650\nWhat's something else we could\nmaybe do with these files?\n\n368\n00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,230\n>> There are ways you could open them and\njust simple binary viewers and\n\n369\n00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,040\nhex viewers that could\nlook at those files and\n\n370\n00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,760\nthe problem with that is the big downside\nwith it is it doesn't make it as easy,\n\n371\n00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,820\nbecause now you've got to really dig\nthrough stuff that's not as clear.\n\n372\n00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,030\nAnd see what you see.\n\n373\n00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,010\nYou can open DWG files\n\n374\n00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,430\nin different text viewers if you know the\nright way to do it, you can open it up,\n\n375\n00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:54,058\nbut it just looks just a bunch of\ncrap you gonna get up on your screen.\n\n376\n00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:54,895\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, you'll have,\n\n377\n00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:59,035\nif you look at the sequences and stuff and\nall of that, you can start telling things.\n\n378\n00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:04,255\nBut, you could that with probably\nany proprietary format out there.\n\n379\n00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:06,505\nBut it becomes tougher.\n\n380\n00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:10,760\nAnd who knows, in a case of a DWG file.\n\n381\n00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,890\nI never had anyone ask it when I was at\nthat company, or asked it that I knew of.\n\n382\n00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,450\nBut call the company and\ntell them what you're doing, and\n\n383\n00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,640\ntell them this is the type\nof information you look for,\n\n384\n00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,700\ncan they do an analysis of that if you\nbring it down, or something like that.\n\n385\n00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,060\nThey might do that for you.\n\n386\n00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,730\n>> Right.\n\n387\n00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,560\nSo call the vendor and see if there's\nsomething you can work out with them.\n\n388\n00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,730\nWhat about trying to change a file or\n\n389\n00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,560\nconvert a file from one type to another,\nis that something we can consider?\n\n390\n00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,400\n>> That's something you can\nconsider in some situations.\n\n391\n00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,620\nConverting it,\nmoving it from format to format, and\n\n392\n00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,580\nthere's different reasons\nwe might do that.\n\n393\n00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,450\nMaybe a different application\nwe can use to open it up, or\n\n394\n00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,569\nwe can transform it in some way\nto manipulate someplace else.\n\n395\n00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,530\nMy feeling with file conversions is\n\n396\n00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,870\nthat old saying that you lose\nsomething in translation.\n\n397\n00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:09,150\nThat's kind of what I've noticed\nwith every file conversion there is,\n\n398\n00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,090\nis that you tend to lose something.\n\n399\n00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,730\nIt's never 100%.\n\n400\n00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:17,010\nIt's like converting these viewers\nthat can convert a JPEG to a GIF.\n\n401\n00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,020\nOh, it converts it over here and\nmakes it sounds like, oh it's perfect.\n\n402\n00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,620\nIf you understand the limitations\nof those two formats, you've just\n\n403\n00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,850\ncaused some major downgrade of the quality\nof that image just by doing that.\n\n404\n00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,440\n>> Absolutely.\n\n405\n00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,970\nI've worked with some converters that can\nconvert PPTs, Powerpoint presentations\n\n406\n00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:39,180\nfrom Microsoft Office over to a flash\nsimulator or a flash thing, and it works.\n\n407\n00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,880\nI can still see the slides but\nall the animations are gone.\n\n408\n00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,760\nThings like that.\n\n409\n00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,378\nSo those are the kind of things, maybe\nwe don't care about the animations but,\n\n410\n00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:47,838\nnow it's a big what if, right?\n\n411\n00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:52,876\nIt's a big question mark now over that\nfile, which is what we're trying to avoid.\n\n412\n00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:55,198\nI want exact copies, I want duplicates.\n\n413\n00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:58,768\nIf I have to convert it from one file\ntype to another All of the sudden,\n\n414\n00:23:58,768 --> 00:24:02,048\nthe defense can start poking holes\nin that or trying to anyway.\n\n415\n00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,865\nAnd remember in a criminal,\nit's just a reasonable doubt, so\n\n416\n00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:07,890\nprobably not the best solution.\n\n417\n00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,380\nThis is probably something that\nneeds to be addressed here.\n\n418\n00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,880\nI see that Dave and\nBen are on the ball here saying.\n\n419\n00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:22,810\nDavid says DWG Viewer from Autodesk is\nfree, and Ben gives the link for it.\n\n420\n00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:27,950\nGood job, guys, that you know those and\nfound it so quickly.\n\n421\n00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,070\nYeah, that's true.\n\n422\n00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,650\nThat is available, and it's free.\n\n423\n00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,770\nBut it's not gonna pull information\nfrom deep inside the file.\n\n424\n00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,210\nThose are not meant for forensics.\n\n425\n00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,360\nThat's meant to view the graphical\ninformation in the file,\n\n426\n00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,440\nwhich if I need to find information about.\n\n427\n00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,210\nPotentially, where it was created and\nother stuff,\n\n428\n00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,063\nthat's not gonna show up in there.\n\n429\n00:24:48,063 --> 00:24:51,337\n>> Gotcha.\n>> So yeah, that's great that you bring\n\n430\n00:24:51,337 --> 00:24:56,286\nthat up, because it shows that yeah,\nthere's viewers.\n\n431\n00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:00,430\nAnd then there's viewers for\nanother purpose out here.\n\n432\n00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,870\nSo it's a good catch.\n\n433\n00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,900\nI still would if I was gonna\nbe investigating DOBG's,\n\n434\n00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,130\nI still would have that viewer on hand.\n\n435\n00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,700\nThere's no reason I\nwouldn't have that on hand.\n\n436\n00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,500\n>> It's free, and you at least wanna open\nup the file and see what the image is.\n\n437\n00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,220\nAnd then, the question is do I need to\ndive deeper into the file what can I use?\n\n438\n00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,460\nAnd there's all kinds of,\nspeaking of yours, another great segue,\n\n439\n00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,530\nthere are all kinds of viewers\nthat we can get out there.\n\n440\n00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,890\nI think of Office right away, because as\nwe've gone through the different flavors\n\n441\n00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,830\nof office, they've always\nmade free viewers available.\n\n442\n00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,870\nSo that if I create a spreadsheet,\nI wanna send it to somebody,\n\n443\n00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,810\nand they don't have Office Excel.\n\n444\n00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,050\nThey can open up these viewers,\n\n445\n00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,427\nand most applications have\nsome kind of viewer for them.\n\n446\n00:25:41,427 --> 00:25:42,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n447\n00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,060\n>> So possibly, potentially for free.\n\n448\n00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,500\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, that's always good.\n\n449\n00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,680\n>> Absolutely.\n\n450\n00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,810\n>> But the problem is, like Sean says,\n\n451\n00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:54,700\nsome of those viewers might help me open\nup that file and look at the file itself.\n\n452\n00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,890\nBut, can I dive into it forensically and\nget deeper into that, and get some of\n\n453\n00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,598\nthe other information and metadata,\nand things like that out of there?\n\n454\n00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:03,860\nSo all right.\n\n455\n00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,450\nWell, tell you what?\n\n456\n00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,850\nLadies and gentlemen,\nit is time for us to take a break.\n\n457\n00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,560\nSo why don't we stop here, when we come\nback we're gonna continue on with setting\n\n458\n00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,255\nup our computer forensics lab and\nthe software that we need.\n\n459\n00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:16,850\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n460\n00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:24,163\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n461\n00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:28,991\nSo continuing on into the world of our\ncomputer forensics lab, and specifically\n\n462\n00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:33,322\ndiving into some of the different\nsoftware options that are available or\n\n463\n00:26:33,322 --> 00:26:38,580\nout there that we're gonna find necessary,\nor desirable to have in our forensics lab.\n\n464\n00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,701\nAs we've gone through a few\ndifferent types of imaging software,\n\n465\n00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:48,160\nsome file analysis software, talked about\nthe different viewers that are available.\n\n466\n00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,900\nThere's a lot of free viewers out\nthere that we could get ahold of.\n\n467\n00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,610\nWe just need to open up a file and\nsee what's in there.\n\n468\n00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,840\nAnd we talked about\nconversion on the notes.\n\n469\n00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,930\nI think Chris had put in the show notes,\nor n the chatroom.\n\n470\n00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,370\nAmsar was the one we were thinking of or\nwanted to talk about as well,\n\n471\n00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,710\nor mention anyway.\n\n472\n00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,820\n>> Yeah,\nit's one of the tools that's out there.\n\n473\n00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,190\nSince our link's already up there,\n\n474\n00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,930\nall of you may wanna bookmark that\ncuz that one's gonna come in handy.\n\n475\n00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:20,480\nBut, it's one of many tools that\nare available for doing file conversions.\n\n476\n00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,800\nSo just keep that in mind if\nyou ever need to do that.\n\n477\n00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,320\nWe'll do a little bit of\nthat in here later on.\n\n478\n00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,910\nBut, there you go.\n\n479\n00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,980\nThat should be only online if I recall,\n\n480\n00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,773\nso-\n>> I do believe so.\n\n481\n00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:40,785\n>> So, if you need to go mobile at\nsome place where there's not internet,\n\n482\n00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,525\nwhich is possible.\n\n483\n00:27:42,525 --> 00:27:43,625\nIt's very possible.\n\n484\n00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:51,555\nIf you are doing mobile investigations,\nthen be prepared for that.\n\n485\n00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:52,768\nSo, all right.\n\n486\n00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:53,442\n>> All right.\n\n487\n00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:58,272\n[LAUGH] So another thing that we're gonna\nhave to deal with is various operating\n\n488\n00:27:58,272 --> 00:27:59,770\nsystems, right?\n\n489\n00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,690\nWe're gonna run into\ndifferent systems out there\n\n490\n00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,370\nthat we're gonna have to investigate.\n\n491\n00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:09,170\nAnd not everything, I know, believe it or\nnot, not everything runs Windows.\n\n492\n00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,590\nIt's crazy.\n>> Wow, hold on.\n\n493\n00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,090\n>> I know.\n>> Really?\n\n494\n00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,087\n>> There's like three systems out there.\n\n495\n00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:14,860\nI know there's at least one, Apple and\n\n496\n00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,125\ntwo, Linux I think, no.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n497\n00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,815\n>> I'm kidding, there's lots of them out\n\n498\n00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:18,455\nthere, right?\n\n499\n00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:24,045\nSo sometimes, we do start thinking that\neverything's Windows cuz it's a lot of\n\n500\n00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:28,350\ntimes what we see on the desktops of\na lot of our employees at our companies.\n\n501\n00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,960\nBecause Microsoft definitely has\nthe majority of the enterprise desktop\n\n502\n00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,140\nmarketplace.\n\n503\n00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,420\nBut, when it comes to our servers and\noutside that corporate network,\n\n504\n00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,280\neven my users that use Windows at work.\n\n505\n00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,730\nTheir laptops could very\nwell be running Linux, or\n\n506\n00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,600\na good majority of them\nhave Apple laptops.\n\n507\n00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,440\nSo we need to be prepared for\nall that, right?\n\n508\n00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,880\n>> Yeah, you definitely need to be\nprepared to be anytime, anywhere.\n\n509\n00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,250\nLinux is a great example.\n\n510\n00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:04,380\nIt's in a ton of places outside\nthe desktop environment.\n\n511\n00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:12,410\nLennox hasn't had the penetration on\nthe desktop that Windows has had.\n\n512\n00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,905\nNeither has the Mac OS.\n\n513\n00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:17,991\nSo yeah, Windows is probably,\n\n514\n00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:22,215\njust by necessity,\nis gonna be part of your tool kit.\n\n515\n00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:26,255\nThat's something that should be in there,\nbut stuff like Linux.\n\n516\n00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:29,812\nIt's gonna have to be in there as well.\n\n517\n00:29:29,812 --> 00:29:33,722\nLinux is in so many places,\ndifferent devices.\n\n518\n00:29:33,722 --> 00:29:38,132\nI mean, we talked about collecting\nevidence from the site,\n\n519\n00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:40,230\nnetwork stuff, and things like that.\n\n520\n00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:43,257\nA lot of those things\nare running a version of Linux.\n\n521\n00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:47,630\nt may be customized, but\nits a version of Linux.\n\n522\n00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,440\nSo, just be prepared.\n\n523\n00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,950\nHeck, even something that I'd throw\nin on a side note to that with Linux\n\n524\n00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,420\nbeing every place.\n\n525\n00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,460\nYou might actually, as far as equipment\ngoes, have to get prepared to do forensic\n\n526\n00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,190\nexamination on cars, and stuff like that.\n\n527\n00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,490\nThose things have computers in them now.\n\n528\n00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,380\n>> Was gonna say, we've got our\ncar-puters now, so definitely something.\n\n529\n00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,210\nYou might have to analyze GPS data from\nnavigation systems and things like that.\n\n530\n00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,340\nWhich could be running\nsome proprietary system,\n\n531\n00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,450\nor could be some kind of a manipulation\nof Linux or something like that.\n\n532\n00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,440\nSo gonna have to deal with all of that.\n\n533\n00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,375\nNot only do we have to recognize, we have\nto understand the operating system and\n\n534\n00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:30,590\nhow to function in it,\nbut we might have to have\n\n535\n00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,190\ntools that operate on these\ndifferent operating systems as well.\n\n536\n00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,889\nRight?\nSome of\n\n537\n00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:37,587\nthese tools might run on Windows and\nnot run on Linux, or visa versa.\n\n538\n00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:41,177\nAnd especiallywhen it comes to that\nApple platform, very proprietary there.\n\n539\n00:30:41,177 --> 00:30:43,281\nSo, yep.\n>> That's the thing,\n\n540\n00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:46,424\nyou've got to be prepared for that.\n\n541\n00:30:46,424 --> 00:30:49,825\nSo, you need to think about what operating\nsystems that you're most likely to\n\n542\n00:30:49,825 --> 00:30:51,040\nencounter.\n\n543\n00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,210\nIf you work in a corporate environment,\nit makes it a little easier on you.\n\n544\n00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,860\nYou're probably going to be running\ninto mostly Microsoft operating systems.\n\n545\n00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,980\nOf course,\nit sounds simple on the surface, and\n\n546\n00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,489\nit never really is all that simple.\n\n547\n00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,460\nIf I just said, oh, you're lucky.\n\n548\n00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,750\nYou work for a corporate environment.\n\n549\n00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,110\nAll you have is Windows.\n\n550\n00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,395\nWhat versions of Windows do you have?\n\n551\n00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:16,110\n>> Yep.\n\n552\n00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,300\n>> That opens up a huge can of worms.\n\n553\n00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,000\nYou very well could have systems\nall the way back to Windows XP.\n\n554\n00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,450\nAnd I know of places that still\ngo further back than that.\n\n555\n00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,475\nI know places that run 98 and 95.\n\n556\n00:31:29,475 --> 00:31:31,172\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n557\n00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:35,430\n>> And so, we could say all\nthat stuff about oh, well.\n\n558\n00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,730\nWhat the heck are they doing?\n\n559\n00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,650\nDon't care.\n\n560\n00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,270\nI really don't care what they're doing.\n\n561\n00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,310\nI'm not there to make a judgement.\n\n562\n00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,190\nI'm there to extract the evidence.\n\n563\n00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,360\nIf it's there.\n\n564\n00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,170\nSo the challenge comes for you,\nwhere do you get that stuff?\n\n565\n00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,250\nIn the case of Microsoft,\nthey've made it relatively easy.\n\n566\n00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,755\nYou're just gonna have to put it\nin your budget to get something\n\n567\n00:31:52,755 --> 00:31:54,801\nlike an MSDN subscription\nthat has all that stuff.\n\n568\n00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:59,505\nAnd the really cool thing about that\nis they have All their products and\n\n569\n00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:04,686\neverything there so you can analyze that\ndata if you need to no matter what data\n\n570\n00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:09,620\nyou have, or what operating system\nyou need to look at and test against.\n\n571\n00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,090\nSo that's a cool option.\n\n572\n00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:15,310\nFor Linux there's really no collection\nyou can just go and download.\n\n573\n00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,540\nYou can go to sites and\nsee collections of all the distro or\n\n574\n00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,170\na lot of the distros that are out there,\nbut you still have go and\n\n575\n00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,480\ndownload them all and\ngo to different sites and all that.\n\n576\n00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,610\nSo it's a little more messy, but you still\ncould get at least the most popular ones.\n\n577\n00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,804\nMac OS you can't really\nget any easier with that.\n\n578\n00:32:33,804 --> 00:32:38,609\nI mean, you buy a piece of hardware,\nkeep it upgraded with the latest one,\n\n579\n00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:40,410\nand that's kind of it.\n\n580\n00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,700\nYou may need to keep different pieces of\nhardware with different OSs on there, but\n\n581\n00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,300\nthat's something else entirely.\n\n582\n00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:52,880\nAnd then Unix, well, you're not gonna\nrun into too many flavors of Unix.\n\n583\n00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,110\nSo if you're gonna use that, probably\nonly a couple that you really need to\n\n584\n00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,860\nworry about, like OpenBSD, for example.\n\n585\n00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,440\nBut you do need to have different\noperating systems on hand that\n\n586\n00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,980\nyou will test against and run images of,\nor what have you, so there you go.\n\n587\n00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,130\n>> And to be able to access some\nof those file systems, right?\n\n588\n00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,900\nBecause, they're going to have\ndifferent file systems so\n\n589\n00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,890\nI might need a different OS on mine.\n\n590\n00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,460\nLike, for our technician computer,\n\n591\n00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:24,116\nwhat we call our forensics station,\ndifferent operating systems,\n\n592\n00:33:24,116 --> 00:33:28,630\ndifferent forensic stations with\ndifferent OS's on them maybe?\n\n593\n00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,464\n>> Yep, yes, you could do those.\n\n594\n00:33:30,464 --> 00:33:34,755\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It used to be that it was really those\n\n595\n00:33:34,755 --> 00:33:39,922\ntwo, you either had a multiboot system or\nyou had multiple physical systems.\n\n596\n00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:44,372\nNowadays with virtualization,\nyou can run so many on one system,\n\n597\n00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:48,354\nyou don't need to worry about\nall this craziness anymore.\n\n598\n00:33:48,354 --> 00:33:49,539\n>> Thank god.\n>> Yeah.\n\n599\n00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,390\n>> Right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n600\n00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:55,180\n>> So a lot of times you can just get\n\n601\n00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:00,460\none system and put all that stuff on it,\nwithin reason.\n\n602\n00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,731\nIt's one of the reasons also, by the way,\n\n603\n00:34:02,731 --> 00:34:06,710\nif you look at SANS documentation on\nhow to create a forensic workstation,\n\n604\n00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,455\nit's one of the reasons why it'll say,\nhey, invest all this money.\n\n605\n00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:14,665\nInvest whatever money you can in hard\ndrive space and RAM, because you're gonna\n\n606\n00:34:14,665 --> 00:34:17,105\nneed it, because we're gonna build\na bunch of virtual machines.\n\n607\n00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:20,329\nThat's where that comes in, wherever\nyou get the most bang for the buck,\n\n608\n00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:21,893\nthat's what you're looking for.\n\n609\n00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,263\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n610\n00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:26,845\nAll right, so we gotta be able to do\nit with various operating systems.\n\n611\n00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:32,147\nAnother category we want\nto dive into is these OS or\n\n612\n00:34:32,147 --> 00:34:35,847\nnetwork level tools that\nwe have to deal with.\n\n613\n00:34:35,847 --> 00:34:39,565\n>> Yes,\nthat definitely becomes another area now.\n\n614\n00:34:39,565 --> 00:34:48,210\nI put a list together of tools that\nwork both at the OS and network level.\n\n615\n00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,960\nThey're kind of like\na mixed bag of things.\n\n616\n00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,690\nSo some of these things you may not\nentirely expect them to be there but\n\n617\n00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,830\nI found this was the best fit.\n\n618\n00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,890\nI didn't want to give you a whole ton\nof different categories out there and\n\n619\n00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:04,940\nmake it crazy, I wanted to keep\nit simple as much as possible.\n\n620\n00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,037\nThe cool thing about it is some of\nthe stuff we've already seen in the past,\n\n621\n00:35:09,037 --> 00:35:13,890\nsome of it's gonna be new, some of it's\njust gonna be the old stuff in a new form.\n\n622\n00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,893\nSo just to kind of show you one of these,\nI've brought up on\n\n623\n00:35:17,893 --> 00:35:23,680\nmy computer here to give you a quick look,\nsomething called the WSCC.\n\n624\n00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,974\nThe WSCC is a product\nthat we have out there,\n\n625\n00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:29,833\nI always forget what WSCC stands for.\n\n626\n00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:32,411\n>> It's the Windows System-\n>> Windows System Control Center.\n\n627\n00:35:32,411 --> 00:35:33,246\n>> There you go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n628\n00:35:33,246 --> 00:35:34,268\n>> There we go.\n\n629\n00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:36,920\nSo, we're good, we got it.\n\n630\n00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,960\nBut what this does is,\nyou should remember,\n\n631\n00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,660\nif you were in my CEH class,\nI mentioned about the Sysinternals Suite.\n\n632\n00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,690\nOkay, so, you've got that,\n\n633\n00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,330\nand I mentioned that there was\na whole bunch of neat tools with that.\n\n634\n00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:56,027\nThose tools are trusted utilities\nthat are also useful in the forensics\n\n635\n00:35:56,027 --> 00:36:00,575\nspace because you can view process lists,\nusers that are logged in.\n\n636\n00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,995\nYou can view just a whole\nbunch of stuff with it and\n\n637\n00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,700\nwe will be using those utilities.\n\n638\n00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:13,370\nSo this is one that you probably want\nto go ahead and download at some point.\n\n639\n00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:17,892\nSo the Windows System Control Center,\nwhat it will do is it's really just a,\n\n640\n00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:21,243\nwhen you download it,\nit's just a very small download.\n\n641\n00:36:21,243 --> 00:36:24,460\nAnd you're like, well, how the heck\ndoes it have all those things in it?\n\n642\n00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,820\nWell, the reason how it has all those\nthings in it is when you download it,\n\n643\n00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,390\nit's really just a shell.\n\n644\n00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,986\nThis WSCC is just\na presentation environment.\n\n645\n00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:39,217\nWhat happens is, is that it will tell you,\ndo you want me to download Sysinternals?\n\n646\n00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:42,920\nDo you want me to download another\nset of tools called NirSoft?\n\n647\n00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,960\nYou can see those right here.\n\n648\n00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,290\nAnd if you choose to do those it will\ngo out to the site and download them.\n\n649\n00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,960\nIt also will keep them updated for\nyou too.\n\n650\n00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,930\nSo if there's a new version of\nsomething that's been released,\n\n651\n00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,055\nit will have it in here automatically.\n\n652\n00:36:57,055 --> 00:37:02,350\nNow, I'm just gonna go ahead instead\nof poking through all of it,\n\n653\n00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:08,570\nand I'm not going to show you all\nthe tools right now and how they work.\n\n654\n00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:12,741\nWe're showing the tool and\nkinda poking through so\n\n655\n00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:15,361\nyou can see what the things are.\n\n656\n00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:19,490\nBut we will be using a portion of these.\n\n657\n00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,491\nWe're not gonna be using them all,\nwe just can't use them all.\n\n658\n00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:26,591\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But trust me, once you get\n\n659\n00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:31,780\nit you're gonna try everything in there.\n\n660\n00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,470\n>> Absolutely.\n\n661\n00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,494\n>> Yeah, I recommend you\ntry everything on Friday so\n\n662\n00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:39,535\nif you bust your system doing this\nstuff you've got time to fix it.\n\n663\n00:37:39,535 --> 00:37:42,159\n>> [LAUGH] There you go, right.\n\n664\n00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,202\n>> Not that I think that's gonna happen.\n\n665\n00:37:44,202 --> 00:37:49,674\nSo what we have is the All Items,\nwhen I click on All Items\n\n666\n00:37:49,674 --> 00:37:55,050\nit shows all the Sysinternals tools,\nNirSoft tools.\n\n667\n00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,520\nAnd it shows stuff that's\nbuilt into Windows already.\n\n668\n00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,506\nYou can see if you go through my list of\nstuff here, you can see Disk Cleanup and\n\n669\n00:38:03,506 --> 00:38:05,180\nDisk Defragmenter.\n\n670\n00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,351\nThose aren't tools that downloaded,\n\n671\n00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:12,010\nit just stuck a shortcut in there to\nmake it easier for you to access.\n\n672\n00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,370\nSo you've got all sorts of things.\n\n673\n00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,910\nYou've got stuff to view\nthe history of Chrome, of Firefox,\n\n674\n00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,620\nof IE, those are in there.\n\n675\n00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:25,690\nSo it can actually read the history out,\nit can read the cookies for it.\n\n676\n00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,790\nWe have stuff that can punch into\nActive Directory here, if we needed that.\n\n677\n00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,270\nSo, you can have stuff that actually\nviews the connections back and forth,\n\n678\n00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,490\nand shows the connections\nthat may be happening.\n\n679\n00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,220\nIt may be great if you suspect\nthere's malware on a system and\n\n680\n00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,800\nyou're doing an investigation,\nto see who it's phoning home to.\n\n681\n00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,300\nWell, you can do that through here.\n\n682\n00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,450\nSo it's just a really neat set of stuff,\n\n683\n00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,380\nprocesses are running,\nusers that are logged in.\n\n684\n00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:58,700\nI mean you name, its pretty much got\nit in here in some way, shape or form.\n\n685\n00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,630\nIf I got to, for example, the web\nbrowser stuff in here specifically,\n\n686\n00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,350\nI mean yeah there's my Chrome stuff.\n\n687\n00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,630\nIts even got stuff for Safari, Opera.\n\n688\n00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,230\n>> Your favorite browser.\n\n689\n00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,286\n>> Yeah, one of my favorites.\n\n690\n00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:14,157\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's got these things to look at\n\n691\n00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:19,150\ncookies and everything else in there,\nso just so much.\n\n692\n00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,706\nWhen I first found this tool, yeah,\n\n693\n00:39:22,706 --> 00:39:26,854\nI was just going well\nthis is pretty sweet.\n\n694\n00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:31,410\nIt's like I don't have to go there and\ngrab everything and put them together.\n\n695\n00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,760\nAnd I don't have to go out to the command\nline to run every little thing.\n\n696\n00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,381\nI mean I don't have any aversion to\nwriting a command line, I love it, but\n\n697\n00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:44,854\nit's not as fast as being able to click\non it, have it open up a window and\n\n698\n00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:45,993\nrun the results.\n\n699\n00:39:45,993 --> 00:39:49,946\nThat's really neat, so, and yeah,\nChris has also mentioned, and thanks for\n\n700\n00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:52,955\nbringing this up, Chris,\nthey do have a portable version,\n\n701\n00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:54,561\none you don't have to install.\n\n702\n00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:58,439\nYou can put it on a flash drive and plug\nin and run right from From a flash drive.\n\n703\n00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:58,996\nSo- Very nice.\n\n704\n00:39:58,996 --> 00:39:59,739\nVery nice.\n\n705\n00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:02,440\nI mean that's a nice\ncollection of utilities there.\n\n706\n00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,310\nAnd like you said the cool thing\nis that it;s all in one spot.\n\n707\n00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,420\nIt kind of reminds me\nof getting Kali Linux.\n\n708\n00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,820\nAnd how it already has most of\nthose tools combined in there.\n\n709\n00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,990\nAnd I don't really have\nto do a whole lot more.\n\n710\n00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,000\nSo- Yeah.\nIt's simplicity.\n\n711\n00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,380\nSo, I put it on this one to recreate an\nenvironment that I would do forensics with\n\n712\n00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,120\na lot of the tools that I'm\ntelling you about here.\n\n713\n00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,130\nPlus some other ones I've\nalready got loaded on here.\n\n714\n00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:31,175\nSo this one I've gotten\nloaded on here if you're\n\n715\n00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:35,375\nbuilding a forensic station, this might\nbe one that you choose to put on there.\n\n716\n00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:38,365\nYou might also choose to put on\na flash drive too, just in case.\n\n717\n00:40:38,365 --> 00:40:41,860\nI didn't put on a flash drive because\nit's not really, got an off or\n\n718\n00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:47,300\nanything additional to the course if I do\nthat in the field, it very well might.\n\n719\n00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,500\nSo there you go.\n\n720\n00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,620\nNice, nice.\n\n721\n00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,330\nAll right, so great tool there.\n\n722\n00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:58,140\nSome others ones, some of these I think\nwe've actually seen in other shows.\n\n723\n00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,760\nBut Wireshark is one,\nI need something to be able to,\n\n724\n00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,080\nif I'm talking about a networking\ntype investigation, or\n\n725\n00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,150\nit involves data travelling\nacross the network.\n\n726\n00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,460\nI need something to capture those packets,\nor see what that machine is spitting out.\n\n727\n00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,800\nWhat it's chattering about.\n\n728\n00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,010\nYeah, you may very well have\nto do network forensics.\n\n729\n00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:20,290\nAnd if you recall yesterday when we had\nkind of our crime scene set up out here,\n\n730\n00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:24,980\nI was talking later on about well, it may\nnot have been restricted to that machine,\n\n731\n00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,240\nwhat if this was an administrator system,\nand\n\n732\n00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,440\nthey were engaged in administrative\nreviews in that category of incident?\n\n733\n00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,710\nIf that's the case, then you might be\nbringing Wireshark into play to see\n\n734\n00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,160\nwhat type of stuff was happening.\n\n735\n00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,320\nThat may be how you initially found out\nthat this person was up to no good.\n\n736\n00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,310\nYou start seeing different way and funny\nwaves of traffic going through an ids and\n\n737\n00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,540\nthen you pop the Wireshark on there and\nfilter out the trap for\n\n738\n00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,280\nthat station and said,\nyeah I narrowed it down.\n\n739\n00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,110\nI can see what's going on.\n\n740\n00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,080\nSo, it's useful.\n\n741\n00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,680\nSo the Wireshark skills you have.\n\n742\n00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:06,050\nIf I didn't stress it to you\nenough in the CEH class..\n\n743\n00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,340\nI'll stress it here.\n\n744\n00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:11,540\nWireshark is one of those universal\nthings that's used across several areas\n\n745\n00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,620\nand I've done two courses so\nfar and it's in both of them.\n\n746\n00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,665\nOf course they do in the future,\nit's gonna be there too.\n\n747\n00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:22,485\nAnd it's gonna be another\ncourses at ITProTV does.\n\n748\n00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:25,485\nSo I would just be aware of that.\n\n749\n00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:26,205\nYeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n750\n00:42:26,205 --> 00:42:26,725\nAll right.\n\n751\n00:42:26,725 --> 00:42:29,065\nAgain, there's others again available or\nI've gotten another monitor and\n\n752\n00:42:29,065 --> 00:42:29,715\nthings like that.\n\n753\n00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:34,360\nBut Wireshark is one of those that's\na It's accepted, it's known, and\n\n754\n00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,540\nwe trust it, and things like that.\n\n755\n00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,780\nSo it's a good one to get.\n\n756\n00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,190\nWhat's another one that we\nmight want to use out there?\n\n757\n00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,940\nOne of the ones I put on my list\nto push out there that we've\n\n758\n00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,350\nseen in other cases is Netcat.\n\n759\n00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:53,100\nNetcat's a way of opening\nup a shell on a system and\n\n760\n00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,170\npiping commands over to it remotely.\n\n761\n00:42:55,170 --> 00:43:00,611\nWell it does have some use here for\ndoing it for forensic applications that\n\n762\n00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:06,418\nyou could connect to a port on a system\nand see what's responding on that port.\n\n763\n00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:07,907\nYou could use it to push and\n\n764\n00:43:07,907 --> 00:43:11,978\nextract stuff from that system\nwithout interacting with it directly.\n\n765\n00:43:11,978 --> 00:43:16,957\nSee how it responds to certain things to\nkinda analyze what the system might be\n\n766\n00:43:16,957 --> 00:43:17,501\ndoing.\n\n767\n00:43:17,501 --> 00:43:22,181\nAnd we're gonna address more of that\nas we get to that point but Netcat,\n\n768\n00:43:22,181 --> 00:43:27,332\nyes it opens up remote shells, allows\nyou to pipe commands to a remote system.\n\n769\n00:43:27,332 --> 00:43:30,461\nAnd you can do banner grabbing\nstuff like that with it,\n\n770\n00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:34,717\nwhich is very useful for trying to get\na feel for what the scene looks like.\n\n771\n00:43:34,717 --> 00:43:36,262\nMm-hm.\n\n772\n00:43:36,262 --> 00:43:40,602\nSo Netcat and another one that I\nremember from our last time together,\n\n773\n00:43:40,602 --> 00:43:44,950\nanother good one we can use\nhere is that Log Parser Lizard.\n\n774\n00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:50,430\nYeah, this is one that I really,\nreally, really like.\n\n775\n00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,920\nWe talked last time.\n\n776\n00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,330\nWe were doing stuff about\nlog files in general.\n\n777\n00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:04,990\nAbout going through and examining them,\nand stuff like that, well, yeah.\n\n778\n00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:10,050\nYou have log files for\nthe CEH that we looked through to see.\n\n779\n00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,380\nWe could stop and modify.\n\n780\n00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:16,820\nOn the forensic side we're\ninvestigating those log files to see\n\n781\n00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:23,030\nwhat specifically may be happening.\n\n782\n00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,020\nOne of the challenges\nwith log files though,\n\n783\n00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,540\nis sorting through that sea of\ninformation that can be in there.\n\n784\n00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,970\nAnd all of you know that there's\na sea of information that could be in\n\n785\n00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:35,580\na log file, okay?\n\n786\n00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,000\nIt just comes at you,\nit can bowl you over.\n\n787\n00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,960\nLet me show you really quickly\nhere on my screen, I've got,\n\n788\n00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,500\nI'm just going to give\nyou a little peek at it.\n\n789\n00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,480\nThis is Log Parser Lizard.\n\n790\n00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,090\nLog Parser Lizard is free, but\n\n791\n00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,480\nyou need something else with\nit to make it fully work.\n\n792\n00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,900\nFortunately that is free as well, that is\nthe Log Parser Utility from Microsoft.\n\n793\n00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,127\nAnd it will tell you how to go and\ngrab it.\n\n794\n00:45:06,127 --> 00:45:09,160\nSo once you get those two\nthings together you get this.\n\n795\n00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,180\nWhat you're seeing here,\n\n796\n00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:15,610\nthis Log Parser Lizard, it's actually got\ndifferent types of queries it can run.\n\n797\n00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,620\nIt's got a lot of them\njust stacked up in here.\n\n798\n00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,715\nWe can actually see, I mean,\nwe could probably zoom it up a bit for\n\n799\n00:45:22,715 --> 00:45:26,560\nyou to give you a closer\nlook at that screen.\n\n800\n00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,280\nBut if you'll look in this query section,\nyeah, you can make it out.\n\n801\n00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,770\nYou could see that query section's\ngot sequel statements in there.\n\n802\n00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,680\nYou can actually, yeah,\nthat's how powerful this thing is.\n\n803\n00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,440\nIs that you can go through and\nlook at this thing and\n\n804\n00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,240\nuse a standard query out of it.\n\n805\n00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,510\nOr if you got your SQL hat on,\nyou're a ninja with that stuff, you could\n\n806\n00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:55,180\nreally start querying your own events out\nof this in any specific way that you want.\n\n807\n00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,540\nNice.\nSo you've got that all open for you.\n\n808\n00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,970\nSo very neat.\n\n809\n00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,640\nIt's got its own stuff built in but\nyou can go ahead and do other stuff.\n\n810\n00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,520\nAnd it doesn't just query\nthe Windows event viewer,\n\n811\n00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,900\nif you look at it closely,\n\n812\n00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,720\nyou can see that it has stuff\nlike IES it can look at.\n\n813\n00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,010\nAnd it can do file system queries.\n\n814\n00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,380\nSo it can do some pretty neat stuff.\n\n815\n00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,240\nWe're gonna talk about\nportions of this as we go\n\n816\n00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:33,660\nfurther on, but you may wanna start\ntaking a look at this already.\n\n817\n00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,540\nI'm sure a lot of you are kinda\nwriting this stuff down feverishly and\n\n818\n00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,170\ntyping it out as much as you can.\n\n819\n00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,793\nYou might take a look at it.\n\n820\n00:46:44,793 --> 00:46:49,844\nI can guarantee even outside the forensics\nside of things it's probably\n\n821\n00:46:49,844 --> 00:46:55,410\ngonna be something that you are going to\nfind use in your own IT stuff If you have.\n\n822\n00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,253\nAs part of your regular duties,\n\n823\n00:46:57,253 --> 00:47:01,352\njust the standard IT stuff and\nyou have the forensics as an extra thing,\n\n824\n00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:05,200\nthis could be something I could see\nbe very useful outside of that.\n\n825\n00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:05,990\nNice.\n\n826\n00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,410\nNice.\nAnd it's not the same as\n\n827\n00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:10,330\na Sysinternals Log Parser, Michael.\n\n828\n00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,220\nThat's a separate tool.\n\n829\n00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:18,150\nDoes similar things, but\nnot as much as this one does.\n\n830\n00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,700\nLittle more full featured.\n\n831\n00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,530\nLittle more capabilities here and there.\n\n832\n00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:25,360\nYeah.\nIt's got a lot of features in it for\n\n833\n00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,050\nthis, for what it is, for free.\n\n834\n00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,190\nIt's got a lot.\n\n835\n00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,510\nNice. Nice. All right.\n\n836\n00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,540\nWell ladies and gentlemen looking\nat the clock, it's about time for\n\n837\n00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,530\nus to take a quick break.\n\n838\n00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:37,830\nSo we're gonna step away and when we come\nback we're gonna dive back into some\n\n839\n00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:42,670\nof the software we might want to\nsetup in our computer forensics labs.\n\n840\n00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:45,305\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n841\n00:47:45,305 --> 00:47:52,626\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n842\n00:47:52,626 --> 00:47:57,058\nSo continuing on, we're talking about some\nof the software that we might want to\n\n843\n00:47:57,058 --> 00:48:00,004\ninclude when setting up our\ncomputer forensics lab.\n\n844\n00:48:00,004 --> 00:48:01,643\nI think next on the list,\n\n845\n00:48:01,643 --> 00:48:06,574\nwe've talked about things like\nthe Windows system center control panel.\n\n846\n00:48:06,574 --> 00:48:09,709\nWireshark, Netcat,\nsome couple log utilities.\n\n847\n00:48:09,709 --> 00:48:11,296\nLike Log Lizard.\n\n848\n00:48:11,296 --> 00:48:14,581\nIf I say, oh, LogParser Lizard,\nsorry I didn't get that name right.\n\n849\n00:48:14,581 --> 00:48:18,951\nNext on the list,\nmaybe something like channelizer.\n\n850\n00:48:18,951 --> 00:48:26,240\n>> Yeah, channelizer was something\nthat was mentioned in our CEH course.\n\n851\n00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,652\nI won't bother bringing it up now, but\nchannelizer is one that you could do.\n\n852\n00:48:31,652 --> 00:48:35,170\nYou could look for\nwireless devices in the area and\n\n853\n00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:40,630\nsee who's emitting signals and you could\neven do spectrum analysis with it.\n\n854\n00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:45,120\nSo, for our uses, it could be,\n\n855\n00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:50,020\nif we went to a crime scene,\nwe could take a look to see\n\n856\n00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,340\nwhere there's wireless access points,\nor maybe there's one hidden.\n\n857\n00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,170\nMaybe someone's got something\nhidden under a desk.\n\n858\n00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:00,140\nMaybe someone's done the stuff\nthat I showed you in the CEH\n\n859\n00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,962\ncourse with one of those Mini Owners or\nsomething like that.\n\n860\n00:49:02,962 --> 00:49:06,340\nThey've popped it up underneath\nthe desk or what have you.\n\n861\n00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:12,520\nWell, we can use something like\nchannelizer with a GPS and\n\n862\n00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:18,380\ntarget it and figure out where it is,\nand take it out and take it as evidence.\n\n863\n00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:18,960\n>> Absolutely.\n\n864\n00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,325\nIf people have a camera set up, and it's\nsending that wireless signal somewhere and\n\n865\n00:49:23,325 --> 00:49:27,455\nyou need to figure out where's\nthe receiving unit on that thing.\n\n866\n00:49:27,455 --> 00:49:29,805\nOr vice versa, you're at the crime scene,\nand you get the receiving unit,\n\n867\n00:49:29,805 --> 00:49:31,707\nwhere are those cameras planted,\nthings like that.\n\n868\n00:49:31,707 --> 00:49:36,084\nSo, gotta be able analyze our\nwireless spectrums as well.\n\n869\n00:49:36,084 --> 00:49:39,276\nSo we've got our, something like\nchannelizer is a good one to do.\n\n870\n00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:43,757\nAnd then one of my favorites,\nNmap is another one that makes the list.\n\n871\n00:49:43,757 --> 00:49:49,260\n>> Yeah, Nmap, there's not really\ntoo much to add at this point on it.\n\n872\n00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:57,100\nNmap's something that if you were\nin the CEH course, you saw it.\n\n873\n00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,520\nIf you haven't seen it,\nwe are gonna see it in here.\n\n874\n00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,520\nIt is a port scanner, so\n\n875\n00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:10,200\nyou can use that to kind of see processes,\nor see ports open on a system.\n\n876\n00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,800\nMaybe some process information.\n\n877\n00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,420\nAnd you can identify an operating system\nor a range of operating systems, so\n\n878\n00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,620\nit is very useful in a number of ways.\n\n879\n00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,520\nIt's useful as a forensic tac,\nit's a trusted utility.\n\n880\n00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,090\nIt's got by how long it's been out, how\nwidely used it is, it's a trusted utility.\n\n881\n00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,100\nThat's just the long and short of it.\n\n882\n00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,480\n>> Absolutely, and then, again,\nas we've stressed with all of this,\n\n883\n00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,310\nthat's one of our main concerns, is, I can\nfind several tools that can do the job,\n\n884\n00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:41,140\nbut am I going to be able to take\nthat information and use it?\n\n885\n00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,970\nAnd that comes down to, is that software\nrecognized and trusted by whatever\n\n886\n00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:51,240\nlaw enforcement agency or court system\nyou happen to be going through.\n\n887\n00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:55,790\nSo, another thing we've got to do, we're\nexamining these machines forensically,\n\n888\n00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,690\nI need to see what's\ngoing on in that machine.\n\n889\n00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:01,140\nNot everything's gonna be a nice\nopen window sitting on the desktop.\n\n890\n00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,030\n>> It will not.\n\n891\n00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:05,250\n>> [LAUGH] So\nwe really need to be able to dive in and\n\n892\n00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,930\nsee what's running on this machine.\n\n893\n00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:09,800\nWhat apps do they have going.\n\n894\n00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,765\nHidden apps, apps in the background,\nthings like that.\n\n895\n00:51:11,765 --> 00:51:12,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n896\n00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:15,050\nYeah, and if we have that situation,\n\n897\n00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:19,920\nwhich, think about it, you know,\nto use what's called a process dumper or\n\n898\n00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,130\nprocess viewer, they're very,\nvery closely related.\n\n899\n00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:27,234\nThe viewer will do just what it says,\nit'll allow you to view what's currently\n\n900\n00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:30,490\nrunning on the system, and\nsome utilities do only that.\n\n901\n00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:36,710\nOther ones will let you view and dump what\nit is to a file for later examination.\n\n902\n00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:41,479\nAnd so forensically, we are concerned\nwith both aspects of it, viewing and\n\n903\n00:51:41,479 --> 00:51:42,683\ndumping to a file.\n\n904\n00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:46,256\nWe can do a system that is live,\nmeaning it's on,\n\n905\n00:51:46,256 --> 00:51:49,586\nwe need to do a live\ncollection off of that box.\n\n906\n00:51:49,586 --> 00:51:54,121\nOne of the things we are going to do\nbecause it is volatile is grab process\n\n907\n00:51:54,121 --> 00:51:55,111\ninformation.\n\n908\n00:51:55,111 --> 00:52:01,552\nFortunately, what our utilities are,\nif you have WSCC,\n\n909\n00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:08,590\nI believe it's part of\nthe Sysinternals part of things.\n\n910\n00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:16,390\nI've got up on my screen here,\nthis is just a process list for my system.\n\n911\n00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:21,440\nYou could see on here,\nI've got some processes running.\n\n912\n00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,320\nBut it's not the only look at it.\n\n913\n00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,090\nThis also a process explorer\nthat's part of Sysinternals.\n\n914\n00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:31,750\nYou can see, this one is much more\ndetailed in what it can grab.\n\n915\n00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:36,880\nThis can also, by the way, you can see\nsitting up here in the left corner,\n\n916\n00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,580\nit has the ability to save that to a file.\n\n917\n00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,662\nSo we can save it to a file,\nhash it, and we've got evidence.\n\n918\n00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:47,520\nSo that's just what we have in here,\ntwo different views.\n\n919\n00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,654\nThe first one I showed you, the current\nprocess view, that's a high-level view.\n\n920\n00:52:51,654 --> 00:52:54,230\nJust so you noticed,\nit showed you a few things.\n\n921\n00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:59,078\nThis one shows you each thing\nhierarchically laid out showing you which\n\n922\n00:52:59,078 --> 00:53:01,839\nones are child processes of other ones.\n\n923\n00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,219\nSo it's a great utility.\n\n924\n00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:09,210\nIt's giving you really, really good\nin-depth info, which is what we need.\n\n925\n00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,690\nWe need to have this.\n\n926\n00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:11,350\n>> Absolutely.\n\n927\n00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,586\nAnd that's one of my favorites.\n\n928\n00:53:12,586 --> 00:53:16,134\nIt was the Sysinternals for a while,\nthen Microsoft took them over, but\n\n929\n00:53:16,134 --> 00:53:18,820\nstill make that available,\nso a fantastic one there.\n\n930\n00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,720\nAnd then I gave you guys the link\nin the show notes, I'll make\n\n931\n00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,380\nsure there's a link for the other one,\nthe CurrProcess by NirSoft as well.\n\n932\n00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:31,326\nAnd then not only do we need to see what\nprocesses are going on in these machines\n\n933\n00:53:31,326 --> 00:53:35,700\nthat we're investigating, we might need to\nget a look at what drivers they're using.\n\n934\n00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,416\n>> Yes, you do need to get a look at\nwhat drivers are running on a system.\n\n935\n00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:42,541\nAnd you could do the standard thing on,\n\n936\n00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:46,709\ngo through Device Manager and\npop that thing open and\n\n937\n00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:52,010\nstart seeing what's running or\nwhat's installed on that box.\n\n938\n00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:55,490\nThere's even that Show Hidden Devices\noption in Device Manager.\n\n939\n00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:59,676\nAnd I know I'm just talking Windows right\nnow, I know there's equivalent options in\n\n940\n00:53:59,676 --> 00:54:06,700\nLinux, but the majority of you are on the\nWindows side, so we'll just keep it there.\n\n941\n00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,240\nBut there are equivalent on\nthe other operating systems.\n\n942\n00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,895\nBut, you know, so you go in Device Manager\nand pull some of that stuff.\n\n943\n00:54:13,895 --> 00:54:17,199\nAnd you can show hidden devices and\nit'll pull some of that stuff as well,\n\n944\n00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:17,796\nmore stuff.\n\n945\n00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:21,148\nBut what I'm seeing\nhere with this utility,\n\n946\n00:54:21,148 --> 00:54:26,120\nthis is the Device Manager view,\nor what they call DevManView.\n\n947\n00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,360\nAnd, what is it,\nyou've got the NirSoft utilities in there?\n\n948\n00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:30,940\nYeah.\n\n949\n00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:37,020\nYou could see that that one\nis showing me stuff that was\n\n950\n00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:43,040\ninstalled on the system and\nis still there, and stuff that isn't.\n\n951\n00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,800\nIf I look at this list,\nmaybe we can zoom up a bit here for\n\n952\n00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,460\nyou so you can see it a little closer.\n\n953\n00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,570\nYou can see, on my screen,\n\n954\n00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:57,778\nyou can see right there in the kind\nof the middle, the AirPcap stuff.\n\n955\n00:54:58,948 --> 00:55:04,360\nThere's no AirPcap plugged into\nthe system right now, you can ask Mike.\n\n956\n00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,337\nHe's trustworthy.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n957\n00:55:05,337 --> 00:55:07,253\n>> There's nothing plugged into it.\n\n958\n00:55:07,253 --> 00:55:09,705\n>> So it's showing you things\nthat have been plugged in,\n\n959\n00:55:09,705 --> 00:55:11,688\nnot necessarily currently on your system.\n\n960\n00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:12,488\n>> Yeah.\n\n961\n00:55:12,488 --> 00:55:13,522\nYeah, the drivers were loaded.\n\n962\n00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:18,943\nIt's reading the entry for it, saying,\nyeah, that was here at some point.\n\n963\n00:55:18,943 --> 00:55:25,561\nSo I think we kinda understand what\nthe value of that at that point.\n\n964\n00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:29,358\nI mean, we looked at that scenario\nwe talked about yesterday,\n\n965\n00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:31,877\nthat this guy hit the bricks and was gone.\n\n966\n00:55:31,877 --> 00:55:34,498\n>> Had a thumb drive in there\nmaybe at some point, we think, or\n\n967\n00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:37,720\nwho knows what else plugged into there,\nand we need to see what it was.\n\n968\n00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:42,142\n>> Yeah, we weren't sure, we saw the\nlittle orange cap over there, and we said,\n\n969\n00:55:42,142 --> 00:55:46,432\nthat might be, that orange cap that was\nsitting over here, that may have been\n\n970\n00:55:46,432 --> 00:55:51,011\nthe cap to the flash drive he plugged in,\npulled out, and took away with his data.\n\n971\n00:55:51,011 --> 00:55:54,958\nWe also saw that YubiKey\nsitting over here.\n\n972\n00:55:54,958 --> 00:56:02,481\nWe said it was probably safe to assume\nthat it was plugged into that box, but.\n\n973\n00:56:02,481 --> 00:56:06,312\nWhere we didn't say we did assume it,\nwe'd have to do more examination.\n\n974\n00:56:06,312 --> 00:56:09,171\nI can look at this list and say, yes,\n\n975\n00:56:09,171 --> 00:56:13,565\nit was plugged into that\nsystem at some point.\n\n976\n00:56:13,565 --> 00:56:19,865\nSo, very cool, and this,\nof course, can be saved as well.\n\n977\n00:56:19,865 --> 00:56:20,615\n>> Nice.\n\n978\n00:56:20,615 --> 00:56:24,980\nAll right, so we've got our process\nviewers, our driver viewers,\n\n979\n00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:29,355\nanother thing we might need to see\nis that good old registry, right?\n\n980\n00:56:29,355 --> 00:56:33,025\nWhere we hide all those configurations and\nsettings and things like that?\n\n981\n00:56:33,025 --> 00:56:38,790\n>> Yeah, there's plenty of\nways to get into the registry.\n\n982\n00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:42,380\nThere's a few in WSCC that you\ncan go through and examine and\n\n983\n00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,550\nlook for\ndifferent strings in the registry.\n\n984\n00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:45,861\nI think there's about four or\n\n985\n00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:49,980\nfive utilities in there that you can use\nto go through and examine the registry.\n\n986\n00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,590\nYou can use Regedit if you want.\n\n987\n00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:54,800\nSo you've got plenty of options there, but\n\n988\n00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:00,860\nyou should be prepared to have those\nutilities handy so you can go and\n\n989\n00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,170\nexamine a registry and look for changes.\n\n990\n00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:09,998\nSome utilities that we have in WSCC\nthat go and look at the registry,\n\n991\n00:57:09,998 --> 00:57:14,907\nyou can run special queries to look for\nvery specific, or\n\n992\n00:57:14,907 --> 00:57:21,070\ncast a wider net by making a more\ngeneric query to see what's returned.\n\n993\n00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:27,950\nAnd that's a pretty good thing to have.\n\n994\n00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:31,447\n>> Absolutely, I'll throw a link for\none of them I've used before is\n\n995\n00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:34,100\nthe SourceForge of course again-\n>> Another good one.\n\n996\n00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,770\n>> Has one,\nthey've got their RegViewer there.\n\n997\n00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:40,058\nMicrosoft, of course, has their\nbuilt-in stuff and there's several out\n\n998\n00:57:40,058 --> 00:57:44,150\nthere that can do it and take a look\nat that registry at a forensics level.\n\n999\n00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:48,227\nSo we get a-\n>> Well, James' question up here, he says\n\n1000\n00:57:48,227 --> 00:57:53,340\nto what can be used to examine rootkits\nwhich may hide from the operating system?\n\n1001\n00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:57,580\nWell, Sysinternals does have\nthe RootkitRevealer if you wanna go\n\n1002\n00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:01,150\nwith that and there's not really\nanything all that wrong with it.\n\n1003\n00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:05,030\nI'm not gonna bash it, but\nit's just one spin on it.\n\n1004\n00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:08,170\nThere's plenty of other\nutilities that do that as well.\n\n1005\n00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:11,930\nThe utilities that are really\nreliable as far as\n\n1006\n00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:15,390\nexamining rootkits are the ones\nthat you boot off of live.\n\n1007\n00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:18,280\nAnd they don't even use the Windows API,\nor anything, or\n\n1008\n00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,300\nthat system's API period\nto find a rootkit.\n\n1009\n00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:26,280\nBecause if you're relying on that system's\nAPI to tell you if there's a rootkit\n\n1010\n00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,410\nof not, you're gonna have to really do\nyour homeowner and really be careful.\n\n1011\n00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,680\nBecause those APIs may\nhave been compromised and\n\n1012\n00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,390\ntherefore, it may be giving\nyou bogus information.\n\n1013\n00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,920\n>> That's the whole point of a rootkit,\nright?\n\n1014\n00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,920\nIs it's in between me and the kernel, so\n\n1015\n00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,300\nI can't trust anything that I'm running\non top of that operating system.\n\n1016\n00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,360\nSo I need to come in at it\nfrom a different angle.\n\n1017\n00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,870\nIf I'm worried there's a rootkit on there\nI've gotta boot it to something else,\n\n1018\n00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,490\nsomething that's not running\nwhatever's on that hard drive.\n\n1019\n00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:54,143\nOtherwise I can't trust\nthe information I'm getting back,\n\n1020\n00:58:54,143 --> 00:58:57,060\nI don't know if the rootkit is\nfeeding me bogus information or not.\n\n1021\n00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:02,340\n>> Yeah, and cuz there's James saying\nright there, detection before the OS load.\n\n1022\n00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,760\nIt's kind of in the same zip code\nas what we're talking about.\n\n1023\n00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,657\nBoot off a live distro of Linux or\nwhatever utility you can find for this,\n\n1024\n00:59:10,657 --> 00:59:15,329\nand have it sweep the system to see\nif a rootkit's actually running.\n\n1025\n00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,959\nBecause it's staying outside of\nthe environment it can examine stuff a bit\n\n1026\n00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:20,650\nmore closely.\n\n1027\n00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:22,850\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1028\n00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,996\nSo, that takes care of a lot of\nthe internals on our OS, the drivers,\n\n1029\n00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:29,940\nthe registry,\nthe processes that are going on.\n\n1030\n00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:35,267\nThe next thing I think we mentioned is,\nI've got a system, but unfortunately\n\n1031\n00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:40,610\nthe bad guy didn't stay logged on,\nhe didn't leave himself logged on for me.\n\n1032\n00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,777\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1033\n00:59:41,777 --> 00:59:44,320\nnow I can't get anything on this machine,\nright?\n\n1034\n00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,910\n>> Yeah, that's gonna happen.\n\n1035\n00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:50,559\nThey may have just done whatever\nthey wanted, and left and\n\n1036\n00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:54,520\nhad left it logged in, but\nthe screen locked, and that's it.\n\n1037\n00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,311\nBattery power could have\nrun out in that laptop and\n\n1038\n00:59:58,311 --> 01:00:02,020\nthat way you're gonna have\nto put a password in.\n\n1039\n01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:09,060\nSo password crackers are definitely\ngonna be part of your toolkit.\n\n1040\n01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:14,391\nAnd I'm not gonna focus on\nspecific password crackers,\n\n1041\n01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:21,400\nbut there's a lot of them out there,\na whole heck of a lot of them out there.\n\n1042\n01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,922\nHeck, I'd recommend that if you want to\nlook for suggestions on password crackers,\n\n1043\n01:00:26,922 --> 01:00:31,310\nunderstand the technologies a bit more,\nthe CEH has that covered.\n\n1044\n01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,590\n>> Right.\n>> So I would strongly\n\n1045\n01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:36,090\nrecommend doing that cuz we cover\nthat pretty thoroughly in there.\n\n1046\n01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,770\nSo take a look at that.\n\n1047\n01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:43,650\nAll the utilities that we have there would\nbe useful over here, plus other ones.\n\n1048\n01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:47,577\nHowever, there's one thing just to\nkind of put as a footnote to this,\n\n1049\n01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:50,905\nis if you're using a password\ncracker to get into a system,\n\n1050\n01:00:50,905 --> 01:00:53,850\nbe aware that some people\nbooby trap their systems.\n\n1051\n01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:57,911\nSo, if you log in with the wrong account,\nit will self destruct the system\n\n1052\n01:00:57,911 --> 01:01:02,140\nbasically, lobotomize and\ndestroy stuff and wipe it or whatever.\n\n1053\n01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:06,440\nSo, cracking a password doesn't mean,\noh, I can get in and play around.\n\n1054\n01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,570\nMake sure that you've done\nyour due diligence to\n\n1055\n01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:11,440\nsee if that may be the possibility there.\n\n1056\n01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,940\n>> Copies upon copies upon copies, right?\n\n1057\n01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:14,990\nJust in case you destroy something.\n\n1058\n01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,390\n>> There you go.\n\n1059\n01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:20,110\n>> So, definitely don't want to\nplay with the actual hard drive.\n\n1060\n01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,709\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n1061\n01:01:21,709 --> 01:01:24,600\nthat's a lot of good software there,\nwe went through a lot of different things.\n\n1062\n01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,036\nAnd as Sean said at\nthe beginning of this episode,\n\n1063\n01:01:27,036 --> 01:01:29,790\nit's really not an all\ninclusive list by no means.\n\n1064\n01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,570\nBut that's just an example of\nsome of the different categories.\n\n1065\n01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:35,710\nAnd then in each one of those categories,\nan example of a piece of software or\n\n1066\n01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,773\na couple of pieces of\nsoftware that might do that.\n\n1067\n01:01:37,773 --> 01:01:42,530\nAgain, it's up to you, your budget,\nwhat's acceptable in your area as far as,\n\n1068\n01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:47,110\nforensically being able to produce\nsomething that I can take into a court of\n\n1069\n01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,188\nlaw, and things like that.\n\n1070\n01:01:48,188 --> 01:01:52,546\nSo, as Sean said, do your due diligence\nand make sure you're checking it out,\n\n1071\n01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:56,840\nmaking sure that what you're getting\nready, you don't want to spend hours,\n\n1072\n01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:01,457\ndays, weeks, on something, and then come\nto find out, the tool you used to produce\n\n1073\n01:02:01,457 --> 01:02:05,588\nthat information is not trusted, and\nso your information is not trusted.\n\n1074\n01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:13,898\n>> Yeah, the tools I'm presenting in this\ncourse are considered to be trusted tools.\n\n1075\n01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:16,189\nSo, you could take my word for\n\n1076\n01:02:16,189 --> 01:02:20,139\nit, I wouldn't recommend\nyou take my word for it.\n\n1077\n01:02:20,139 --> 01:02:22,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In all honesty.\n\n1078\n01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:27,860\nYeah, you know me from here and\nmy popular series of books.\n\n1079\n01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, you know me from here.\n\n1080\n01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:32,870\nYou know me from here,\nyou know I'm writing books.\n\n1081\n01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:35,700\nSome of you even linked to me on\nLinkedIn or looked at it at least so\n\n1082\n01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,560\nyou kinda know a bit about me.\n\n1083\n01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:42,810\nBut it still comes down to you\nto evaluate if these things\n\n1084\n01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:46,600\nare the proper thing for you to be using,\nif they're okay for your environment.\n\n1085\n01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:51,990\nWhat may be okay for me and for me to say,\nyeah it's great, may not be great for you.\n\n1086\n01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:56,910\nSo, you should be testing these\nthings out on sample cases, or\n\n1087\n01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,750\nolder cases that may have been closed.\n\n1088\n01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,620\nIf you still have those, try them against\n\n1089\n01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:06,670\nthose cases to see if they give you\nresults and do what they need to.\n\n1090\n01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:09,150\nSo, always test no matter what it is.\n\n1091\n01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,515\nTrust no one, as they say, right?\n\n1092\n01:03:11,515 --> 01:03:13,940\n>> Trust no one, exactly.\n\n1093\n01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:17,680\nAll right, so lots of different software\nthat we're gonna want to make part of,\n\n1094\n01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,590\nor possibly include into\nmy computer forensics lab.\n\n1095\n01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:25,825\nAnother thing that we might have to\ndeal with as a forensic investigator is\n\n1096\n01:03:25,825 --> 01:03:27,820\nprogramming languages, right.\n\n1097\n01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:32,280\n>> Yeah, you will have to at some point.\n\n1098\n01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,305\n>> And not so\nmuch that we're writing code, but\n\n1099\n01:03:34,305 --> 01:03:37,190\nwe've gotta analyze what\nsomebody else is writing?\n\n1100\n01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:40,054\n>> Yeah, not necessarily writing it but,\n\n1101\n01:03:40,054 --> 01:03:45,108\nit doesn't mean it's off the table,\nbut not necessarily writing it,\n\n1102\n01:03:45,108 --> 01:03:49,844\nbut being able to look at uncompiled\ncode would be the first thing.\n\n1103\n01:03:49,844 --> 01:03:54,674\nAnd we've got plenty of options\nthere all over the place.\n\n1104\n01:03:54,674 --> 01:03:58,993\nBut there tend to be,\nwe can narrow it down a bit.\n\n1105\n01:03:58,993 --> 01:04:03,873\n>> The ones I got here listed just for\nyou, Perl,\n\n1106\n01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:09,129\nPerl would be one,\nwe do have a small free sweep for\n\n1107\n01:04:09,129 --> 01:04:15,510\nthat that you can download,\nyou can do look for that.\n\n1108\n01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:16,960\nPython is another one.\n\n1109\n01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:22,528\nPython, of all the languages and\nsweeps that I'm\n\n1110\n01:04:22,528 --> 01:04:27,800\ngoing to mention, Python is probably\nthe big ticket item for you.\n\n1111\n01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,388\nSo you probably wanna grab that and\nmaster that at some point.\n\n1112\n01:04:31,388 --> 01:04:34,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I would strongly recommend it.\n\n1113\n01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:37,560\nLook at that, I almost had ESP going.\n\n1114\n01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,930\nChris asked the question,\nI was already on it.\n\n1115\n01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:46,250\n>> Nice.\n>> So, all right so, and yeah James,\n\n1116\n01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:50,430\nIncident Response in Investigating\nComputer Crime is a book I found useful.\n\n1117\n01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,710\nYeah there's another useful book.\n\n1118\n01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:53,926\nIt's listed under my name on that so.\n\n1119\n01:04:53,926 --> 01:04:56,676\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm going to have to disagree\n\n1120\n01:04:56,676 --> 01:04:57,363\nwith you there.\n\n1121\n01:04:57,363 --> 01:05:00,126\nSo anyway.\n\n1122\n01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:03,550\nSo, yeah, that's called a plug.\n\n1123\n01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:04,990\n>> Yes it is.\n\n1124\n01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:06,672\nYes it is.\nAnd we're okay with that.\n\n1125\n01:05:06,672 --> 01:05:07,290\nWe are okay with that.\n\n1126\n01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:13,985\n>> [LAUGH] So in any case,\nwe've got a PowerShell.\n\n1127\n01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:19,300\nPower Shell has already come into its own.\n\n1128\n01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:24,150\nIt's going to be more powerful, there's\na lot of stuff you can do with it, and\n\n1129\n01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,550\nit is useful forensically.\n\n1130\n01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:28,980\nSo if you have PowerShell skills,\nhey, good for you.\n\n1131\n01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:33,865\nIf you guys are IT people already which\nI know a good number of them of us\n\n1132\n01:05:33,865 --> 01:05:39,510\nout here already are, then you may\nalready have PowerShell skills.\n\n1133\n01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:41,210\nThat's a plus, for you.\n\n1134\n01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:46,090\nYou're ahead of the curve in\nthat area at the very least.\n\n1135\n01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:47,110\nSo we like to see that.\n\n1136\n01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:51,320\nBut you know, other suites, Visual Studio.\n\n1137\n01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:57,260\nVisual Studio is something\nthat you can get.\n\n1138\n01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:01,410\nThe cool thing about it is there's\nVisual Studio Express, which is free.\n\n1139\n01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:05,570\nSo, you can get that if you\nthink you're gonna be analyzing\n\n1140\n01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,950\nany sort of source files or\nanything like that.\n\n1141\n01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:13,646\nSo, you know, you do have that available\nto you, I think it's got VB and\n\n1142\n01:06:13,646 --> 01:06:15,930\nC++ another free one.\n\n1143\n01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:19,600\n>> Yeah, it does a couple of the\nlanguages, it might be a little limited I\n\n1144\n01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:24,120\nthink in the collaboration part and\nthings like that, but as far as access and\n\n1145\n01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,760\nlanguages goes,\nyou're good to go with that, can use that.\n\n1146\n01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:33,410\n>> Yeah so you got that and at the very\nleast, Visual Studios guy if you have to,\n\n1147\n01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:37,940\nhave questions about code you may have\nfound or little hiccups in the operating\n\n1148\n01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:44,250\nsystem or an application,\nit's got the documentation there.\n\n1149\n01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:50,110\nI've used Visual Studio, I have it loaded\non my system over here that I've been\n\n1150\n01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:55,180\nshowing you a few things on,\nI've used it a lot of times just for\n\n1151\n01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:58,330\nthe documentation, to look up various\nthings that I have a question about.\n\n1152\n01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:00,380\nIt's very useful for that, you know?\n\n1153\n01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,260\nYes, I have looked at source code now and\nthen,\n\n1154\n01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,460\nbut I also look at documentation, too.\n\n1155\n01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:05,295\nI find it useful.\n\n1156\n01:07:05,295 --> 01:07:08,990\n>> Mm-hm, very true, very true.\n\n1157\n01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:09,520\nWhat else?\n\n1158\n01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,260\nMetasploit.\n\n1159\n01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,420\nWe always mention Metasploit, I think\nin everything you and I do together.\n\n1160\n01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:16,260\n>> Yeah.\n>> It seems to come up [LAUGH]\n\n1161\n01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:18,190\n>> We just gotta say the heck with it and\n\n1162\n01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:19,410\ndo a Metasploit course.\n\n1163\n01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,469\n>> I know [CROSSTALK]\n>> I think we're about due for that.\n\n1164\n01:07:21,469 --> 01:07:23,387\nWe gotta put that on the list.\n\n1165\n01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:24,360\nSomebody make a note.\n\n1166\n01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,440\nMichaela, make a note.\n\n1167\n01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,076\nWe know you're good at that.\n\n1168\n01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:31,354\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we've got Metasploit,\n\n1169\n01:07:31,354 --> 01:07:35,220\nMetasploit really isn't\na programming tool per se,\n\n1170\n01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:38,570\nit's something that would be more\nakin to a vulnerability scanner.\n\n1171\n01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:42,500\nEnter and\nallowing you to probe things in software.\n\n1172\n01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:49,680\nIt's here because it is very it's gonna\nbe very useful to do analysis of stuff.\n\n1173\n01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,300\nLike i said, if your looking at\nsource code it will be useful to test\n\n1174\n01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:58,299\napplications, so i felt it was kind\nof useful to put that in here.\n\n1175\n01:07:58,299 --> 01:07:59,445\n>> For sure, for sure.\n\n1176\n01:07:59,445 --> 01:08:04,660\nAnd another, I'm not sure if\nyou could do this one IDA Pro.\n\n1177\n01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:08,670\n>> Yeah, it's actually called IDA Pro.\n\n1178\n01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:10,990\nI know it's easy to.\n>> Oh okay.\n\n1179\n01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:14,190\n>> [LAUGH] I did that too, the first\ntime I saw it man, so don't feel bad.\n\n1180\n01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:14,790\n>> Good.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1181\n01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:15,560\n>> I think it's\n\n1182\n01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:21,080\nnamed after the first female programmer,\none of the first well known ones or\n\n1183\n01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:21,820\nsomething-\n>> Oh okay.\n\n1184\n01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:23,700\n>> Computer scientist or engineers.\n\n1185\n01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,240\n>> Nice.\n\n1186\n01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:28,080\n>> I may be wrong, but I think\nthat's where it gets its name from.\n\n1187\n01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:33,400\nIt's not the only utility that does this.\n\n1188\n01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:39,314\nBut IDA Pro is one of many that can be\nused for reverse engineering software.\n\n1189\n01:08:39,314 --> 01:08:41,070\n>> Okay.\n\n1190\n01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:48,180\n>> And so, you can use this to look inside\nsoftware that's already been compiled.\n\n1191\n01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:54,330\nAnd maybe look for those telltale signs\nof mischief and all that in there.\n\n1192\n01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:58,889\nAnd you can do pretty advanced\nstuff with that to reverse\n\n1193\n01:08:58,889 --> 01:09:03,361\nengineer code if you're\nreally feeling determined.\n\n1194\n01:09:03,361 --> 01:09:06,463\nAnd like I said,\nthere's plenty of these things out there\n\n1195\n01:09:06,463 --> 01:09:10,830\nif you want to use something like\nthis to do reverse engineering.\n\n1196\n01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:13,150\nThere's actually,\nIda Lovelace, there you go.\n\n1197\n01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,250\n>> Oh, very good.\n\n1198\n01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,100\n>> Yeah, thanks for that, Ben.\n\n1199\n01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:21,077\nShe was very influential from I recall,\nbut\n\n1200\n01:09:21,077 --> 01:09:26,815\nyeah, that's do it being able to reverse\nengineer software is a good skill.\n\n1201\n01:09:26,815 --> 01:09:30,779\nI know one\n\n1202\n01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:35,930\nof the books on forensics\nthat's very popular.\n\n1203\n01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:38,250\nFile System Forensics.\n\n1204\n01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,790\nI forget the guy's name.\n\n1205\n01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:44,020\nI wanna say Ben Carver,\nI wanna say is the guy that wrote it.\n\n1206\n01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:47,200\nBut there's this book that's\nkinda a little older,\n\n1207\n01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:52,760\nthat's called File System Forensics, and\nthey use that tool extensively, in there.\n\n1208\n01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:57,722\nThey also use another one that you\nmay recognize from the CEH course\n\n1209\n01:09:57,722 --> 01:10:00,680\nthat we called all ED bug.\n\n1210\n01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,510\nSame type of utility.\n\n1211\n01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:06,080\n>> Okay.\n\n1212\n01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:11,320\n>> I will tell you though that reverse\nengineering code, there's only so\n\n1213\n01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:16,370\nmuch you can do before you've got to be a\nreally, really good programmer to get it.\n\n1214\n01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:18,160\nDownside.\n\n1215\n01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,790\n>> Gotta be familiar whatever particular\nlanguage that is and well enough to,\n\n1216\n01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:26,090\nas you say, be able to read\nit backwards basically try to\n\n1217\n01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:30,610\nfigure out where this is coming from\ninstead of where it's going to.\n\n1218\n01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:32,310\nNow lots of good software there.\n\n1219\n01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:36,560\nAs far as programming suites go, Perl,\nPython PowerShell, of course, and\n\n1220\n01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,950\nWindows, Visual Studio,\nMetasploit's always cool, IDA Pro.\n\n1221\n01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:47,560\nWhat about, we haven't really\nhit on any graphic type tools.\n\n1222\n01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,560\nWorking with images or\npictures and things like that.\n\n1223\n01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:55,330\n>> Yeah, the two ones that just\ncome to mind are Photoshop and\n\n1224\n01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,920\nthe other one was Paintshop Pro Coral.\n\n1225\n01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,600\nThere's those.\n\n1226\n01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,680\n>> Wow,\nI haven't heard that one in a long time.\n\n1227\n01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,675\n>> Yeah, I want to say that's what it is.\n\n1228\n01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:06,545\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I want to say it's Paintshop Pro,\n\n1229\n01:11:06,545 --> 01:11:11,090\n[INAUDIBLE] it might be late in\nthe day and I'm getting messed up.\n\n1230\n01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:14,088\nBut that's, I wanna say it's\nCoral's Paintshop Pro [CROSSTALK]\n\n1231\n01:11:14,088 --> 01:11:15,401\n>> They are still creating that,\n\n1232\n01:11:15,401 --> 01:11:16,163\nI'll be darned.\n\n1233\n01:11:16,163 --> 01:11:16,721\n>> It's still there, right?\nThat's the right one?\n\n1234\n01:11:16,721 --> 01:11:19,880\n>> Yes, it is, they're on X7.\n\n1235\n01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,716\n>> So it's still, I should know\nI've got it installed on there.\n\n1236\n01:11:23,716 --> 01:11:24,903\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I always,\n\n1237\n01:11:24,903 --> 01:11:27,617\nfor some reason I always have a problem\nwith that PaintShop and Paint,\n\n1238\n01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:28,680\nyou know Microsoft Paint.\n\n1239\n01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,055\nLike, it ain't that, so.\n\n1240\n01:11:30,055 --> 01:11:35,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's these utilities,\n\n1241\n01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:39,200\nPaintShop, Photoshop.\n\n1242\n01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:45,390\nThese other tools that do image\nediting and manipulation.\n\n1243\n01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:50,300\nThey could be useful for\nyou to take a closer look at images and\n\n1244\n01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,560\nview properties of it and\nthings like that.\n\n1245\n01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,293\nThey could be useful for it.\n\n1246\n01:11:55,293 --> 01:12:00,058\nIt may not be something that you're\ncalled upon to do all that much but\n\n1247\n01:12:00,058 --> 01:12:02,701\nyou are going to need an image viewer.\n\n1248\n01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:05,968\nAn image editor that has\nediting capabilities,\n\n1249\n01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:10,031\nnot that you're going to be\nnecessarily editing the image,\n\n1250\n01:12:10,031 --> 01:12:14,606\nbut those tools contain analysis\nstuff that allows us to do things.\n\n1251\n01:12:14,606 --> 01:12:18,720\nThat we're gonna get into a little bit so\n\n1252\n01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:24,820\nthere is a whole area doing forensic\n\n1253\n01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:29,690\nanalysis of images, and it's pretty\nadvanced it's some pretty neat stuff.\n\n1254\n01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:34,568\nPeople can look at an image and analyze\nfew pixels and discolorations in there and\n\n1255\n01:12:34,568 --> 01:12:37,019\ntell you a whole bunch of stuff about it.\n\n1256\n01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:41,950\nIt's actually quite fascinating and\nmaybe we'll get into that at some point.\n\n1257\n01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:44,114\nWe won't get into that depth here, but\n\n1258\n01:12:44,114 --> 01:12:46,812\nmaybe we can do a show in\nthe future I have no idea.\n\n1259\n01:12:46,812 --> 01:12:47,891\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1260\n01:12:47,891 --> 01:12:53,256\n>> But that's when it's actually\nout there for doing graphics\n\n1261\n01:12:53,256 --> 01:13:00,000\njust get a tool that has editing\ncapabilities has filtering capabilities.\n\n1262\n01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,430\nNot to do stuff and\nyou're probably in good shape.\n\n1263\n01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:04,960\n>> Oh yeah.\nVery good.\n\n1264\n01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,460\nAll right.\n\n1265\n01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:09,600\nWell again, our list of software that\nwe're gonna need, or possibly want to have\n\n1266\n01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:15,410\navailable in our computer\nforensics lab continues to grow.\n\n1267\n01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:17,620\nWe've got more software\nthat we're gonna go over.\n\n1268\n01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,230\nSo we're gonna take a quick break and\n\n1269\n01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:21,460\nwhen we come back,\nwe'll continue on with our list.\n\n1270\n01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,382\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1271\n01:13:22,382 --> 01:13:23,264\nWe'll be right back.\n\n1272\n01:13:23,264 --> 01:13:29,271\n[SOUND] Welcome back ladies and\n\n1273\n01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:31,916\ngentlemen.\n\n1274\n01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:34,880\nContinuing on with our list of\nsoftware we wanna include or\n\n1275\n01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,170\nmight possibly want in our\ncomputer forensics lab.\n\n1276\n01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:42,884\nNext category of software we're gonna\ndive into Sean, I believe is web-base or\n\n1277\n01:13:42,884 --> 01:13:46,260\nnot web-based but\nit has to do with viewing web?\n\n1278\n01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:51,970\n>> Yeah, these are utilities that\nwe would use to either analyze\n\n1279\n01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:56,710\nwebsites and\nthe first two are ones that you saw\n\n1280\n01:13:56,710 --> 01:14:01,650\nalready mentioned and\ncovered a bit in the CEH course.\n\n1281\n01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:05,540\nIn fact, all three of the ones I'm gonna\nmention are covered in the CEH course.\n\n1282\n01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:10,415\nBut well one of them we didn't get\na chance to see in that course and\n\n1283\n01:14:10,415 --> 01:14:13,820\nwe're actually gonna take\na look at it in here.\n\n1284\n01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:19,470\nSo we have a whip toe, which you may\nrecall it lets you scan through a site and\n\n1285\n01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:21,710\nwhat we're gonna be doing in there is if\n\n1286\n01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:28,790\nwe're analyzing a server for evidence,\nwe could use this to find out\n\n1287\n01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:33,670\nwhere evidence might be heading\nto take a good look at that.\n\n1288\n01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:37,020\nBlack Widow would be another one\nto download a website if you need\n\n1289\n01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,020\na copy of it.\n\n1290\n01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:43,430\nNeither one of these are gonna be\nnecessarily used in a forensic\n\n1291\n01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,390\nmanner specifically to prove it.\n\n1292\n01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:49,450\nIt could be used to find things and\nthen you can go out to that system and\n\n1293\n01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:50,400\ngrab them yourself.\n\n1294\n01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:55,190\nAnd then the last one, Burp Suite.\n\n1295\n01:14:55,190 --> 01:15:01,080\nBurp Suite is a utility that what it does\nis allows you to view stuff back and\n\n1296\n01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,938\nforth between a couple of systems.\n\n1297\n01:15:03,938 --> 01:15:09,603\nJust FYI, I have it up here on my system,\n\n1298\n01:15:09,603 --> 01:15:12,610\nso I have Burp Suite.\n\n1299\n01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:13,678\n>> It's a tough one to say.\n\n1300\n01:15:13,678 --> 01:15:15,374\n>> I'm gonna say Burp.\n\n1301\n01:15:15,374 --> 01:15:16,013\nOkay.\n\n1302\n01:15:16,013 --> 01:15:16,655\n>> There you go.\n\n1303\n01:15:16,655 --> 01:15:18,920\n[LAUGH]\n>> And if you don't like it,\n\n1304\n01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,730\nput it on mute.\n\n1305\n01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:20,230\nAll right.\n\n1306\n01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:26,705\nSo, but\nall I did here in my browser was I went to\n\n1307\n01:15:26,705 --> 01:15:32,330\nGoogle and\nwhat's happening is my browser is actually\n\n1308\n01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:37,810\nrouting its requests through Burp,\n\n1309\n01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:43,180\nout to the Internet to Google in\nthis case, or to a server period.\n\n1310\n01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:47,480\nThat server responds and\nit comes back through Burp, and\n\n1311\n01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:52,870\nit's gonna wait before it\nactually gets to my browser.\n\n1312\n01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:58,030\nSo what would happen is that in this\ncase the information I'm seeing up here\n\n1313\n01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:03,330\nis just that request and\nresponse information going back and forth.\n\n1314\n01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:07,670\nI can actually view each one in turn and\ndecide if I wanna forward it or\n\n1315\n01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:10,040\ndrop it forward it or drop it.\n\n1316\n01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:15,960\nAnd since it allows this interactions,\nfrom an application\n\n1317\n01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,610\ndeveloper standpoint I got a better\nidea of how my application's working and\n\n1318\n01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:24,460\nif there's any aberrant\ntype of activity in here.\n\n1319\n01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:28,410\nFor forensic investigations it could be if\nsomeone attacked or altered a header or\n\n1320\n01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:31,480\ndid something to cause things to happen.\n\n1321\n01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,310\nWe could use this to actually\n\n1322\n01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:37,910\nprove that there was that type of\nactivity cuz we can see the responses.\n\n1323\n01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:41,250\nIf we went from one browser to another\nbrowser to another browser that could\n\n1324\n01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,320\nbe useful for this.\n\n1325\n01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,807\nSo that's what Burp Suite is and\nit's actually free.\n\n1326\n01:16:45,807 --> 01:16:51,010\nVery, very,very cool to setup.\n\n1327\n01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:51,570\n>> All right, so\n\n1328\n01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:55,149\nwe got a few different things we can work\nwith if we're looking at web content.\n\n1329\n01:16:56,650 --> 01:17:01,960\nThen we get into our applications\nthat we might need to be able to\n\n1330\n01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,320\nwork with documents that we find,\nbe able to manipulate those\n\n1331\n01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,180\nnot to necessarily to make changes, but\nto be able to open documents up and\n\n1332\n01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,330\nto look at them and\nget information out of them.\n\n1333\n01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:12,280\n>> Yeah, these are other ones\nthat you could either have in\n\n1334\n01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:16,590\nyour lab on your general machines, or\nthey can be on employees desktops,\n\n1335\n01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,250\nat least some of them could.\n\n1336\n01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:22,010\nThings like security suites,\nyou're talking stuff like Norton Semantic,\n\n1337\n01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:30,080\nMcAffee, stuff like that, those\nwouldn't be out of place in your lab.\n\n1338\n01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,200\nWe're not talking about\nthe employee system specifically.\n\n1339\n01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,480\nWe're talking about actually\nhaving them in the lab.\n\n1340\n01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,640\nIf you're doing malware analysis and\nstuff like that.\n\n1341\n01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,750\nYou're working with malware,\n\n1342\n01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:44,450\nyou might wanna test to see how\nthese different suites react to it.\n\n1343\n01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:48,940\nSo you could use the security\nsuites to see how they indeed react\n\n1344\n01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,820\nto this piece of malware.\n\n1345\n01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:54,820\nOther ones you go and hear of,\nthere's also another type of suite,\n\n1346\n01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:59,830\nthe Office suites and that I don't care\nwhat Office sites you use personally.\n\n1347\n01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:06,490\nYou can use Microsoft, you use LibreOffice\nor any one of the other ones out there.\n\n1348\n01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:11,160\nSo those are two of the more common things\nyou expect to see, even in the lab.\n\n1349\n01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,680\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1350\n01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,110\nSo we've got our office suites and\n\n1351\n01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:18,700\nthen another one we've seen\nin a couple of other shows,\n\n1352\n01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:24,440\nbut definitely has its place here in our\ndigital forensic investigator is Maltego.\n\n1353\n01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:27,020\n>> Yes.\nMaltego would have a place in this\n\n1354\n01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:29,480\nespecially if you're trying\n\n1355\n01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:33,970\nto determine all the things that\na potential attack could have touched.\n\n1356\n01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:38,890\nYou can use Maltego to go through and\n\n1357\n01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:43,900\nsweep an area to find out these\nare the different IP ranges,\n\n1358\n01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:47,770\nthese are the mail servers and all that so\nyou can start doing investigations.\n\n1359\n01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:50,520\nSee, okay,\nthis attack may have hit all these, so\n\n1360\n01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:54,290\nI may wanna do an investigation of\nthe log files and all that on there.\n\n1361\n01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:59,496\nAnd its cousin, by the way,\nI have listed here is Case File.\n\n1362\n01:18:59,496 --> 01:19:02,219\nIt's by the same company, by Miterva,\n\n1363\n01:19:02,219 --> 01:19:07,840\nit does essentially the same thing that\nMaltego does except it does it offline.\n\n1364\n01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,525\n>> So it's for offline analysis and stuff.\n\n1365\n01:19:09,525 --> 01:19:14,146\n>> Okay, we have our Maltego and\nCase File,\n\n1366\n01:19:14,146 --> 01:19:17,984\nthere's another one, Nexpose.\n\n1367\n01:19:17,984 --> 01:19:23,920\n>> Yeah, Nexpose and\nwe'll just throw Nessus in there too.\n\n1368\n01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,788\nThey are both vulnerability scanners.\n\n1369\n01:19:26,788 --> 01:19:32,320\nAnd those could be another way to\nanalyze a system to get more information\n\n1370\n01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:36,520\noff of it to see you know what state it's\nin how it may have been compromised or\n\n1371\n01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,000\nwhere it's compromised.\n\n1372\n01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,561\nThat could be useful for doing that\nagainst your image of your system that\n\n1373\n01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:44,669\nyou're trying to take a look at.\n\n1374\n01:19:44,669 --> 01:19:48,670\nThat's where that would come in and\nfortunately both those are free and\n\n1375\n01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:51,078\nyou can also get paid\nversions of them too.\n\n1376\n01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:51,983\n>> Okay.\n\n1377\n01:19:51,983 --> 01:19:55,397\nMore features, more capabilities\nprobably in the paid versions I guess?\n\n1378\n01:19:55,397 --> 01:20:01,608\nYeah, they may add support or more IP\naddresses, I think with the Nessus,\n\n1379\n01:20:01,608 --> 01:20:08,014\nthey limit you to like 16 addresses, so\nif you want to do more than that, you\n\n1380\n01:20:08,014 --> 01:20:11,590\nwould have to scan them at different times\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1381\n01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:13,200\n>> Telling you how to bypass the-\n\n1382\n01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:13,860\n>> I like it.\n\n1383\n01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:18,520\nJust break it down into smaller blocks and\nyou're fine, you're good to go.\n\n1384\n01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,840\n>> Yeah, yeah, you'd be fine.\n\n1385\n01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,440\n>> It might take a little more time,\nbut, hey, you get paid by the hour.\n\n1386\n01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:22,980\nRight?\n\n1387\n01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:24,695\n>> Yeah.\nthat's exactly right.\n\n1388\n01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:28,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you want ethics, go to the CEA.\n\n1389\n01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:31,285\n>> That's right.\n\n1390\n01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:32,800\n[LAUGH]\n>> Still got an expose,\n\n1391\n01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,090\nNessus has a couple of\nvulnerability-type scanners.\n\n1392\n01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:37,950\nThey're gonna, again, help us to analyze\nthat system see what's going on.\n\n1393\n01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:43,080\nWhat about notepad plus plus\nis on your list, I like it.\n\n1394\n01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:47,680\n>> Yeah notepad plus plus is the tool that\nallows you to view things like code and\n\n1395\n01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,780\nstuff like that you can\nget in a lot deeper\n\n1396\n01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:51,690\n>> And it's free.\n\n1397\n01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:56,020\nIt allows you to look at things.\n\n1398\n01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:00,310\nSo it's another really good one to\nhave on your forensic systems, and\n\n1399\n01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:02,340\none that we'll be taking a look at.\n\n1400\n01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:06,400\nSo we do have that coming up in here so\nyou might wanna download that one and\n\n1401\n01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:11,190\nhave it at the ready when the time comes.\n\n1402\n01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:12,110\n>> Good.\nOkay.\n\n1403\n01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:14,910\nSo again, just a huge list of software.\n\n1404\n01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:20,270\nAnd that was not by any means considered\nall inclusive or anything like that.\n\n1405\n01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:25,590\nJust some of the ones that Sean uses and\nwould maybe recommend putting on or\n\n1406\n01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:30,230\nhaving available in your\ncomputer forensics lab.\n\n1407\n01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:31,930\nSo got a lot of this software.\n\n1408\n01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,930\nOther things we've gotta think about.\n\n1409\n01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,560\nVirtualization might be\na really good thing to have.\n\n1410\n01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,910\nI mean that's something that'd\n\n1411\n01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:42,565\nmake my setting up of my computer\nforensics lab a lot easier, right?\n\n1412\n01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:47,400\n>> Yes, so\ndefinitely offer you all the benefits of\n\n1413\n01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:51,150\nthat virtualization normally\nnested in an IT environment.\n\n1414\n01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:56,650\nIt also offers us the ability to, since we\ncan virtualize several operating systems,\n\n1415\n01:21:56,650 --> 01:22:00,580\nwe can run all those various\noperating systems on one system.\n\n1416\n01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:03,580\nWell, within reason we could\nrun them all on one system.\n\n1417\n01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:07,890\nWe can also run tools like KLEE,\n\n1418\n01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:12,212\nif I want to go some place and\nI'm doing an analysis and\n\n1419\n01:22:12,212 --> 01:22:16,450\nthen I need to run the tools in KLEE,\nI don't have to bring another system.\n\n1420\n01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:19,550\nI don't have to reboot the system,\nboot a different environment,\n\n1421\n01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:20,960\nflip back and forth.\n\n1422\n01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:25,490\nI've got it where i can open up that\nvirtual environment, that VM and\n\n1423\n01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:29,240\nstart doing some probes and\nstuff like that with those tools.\n\n1424\n01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:34,530\nSo virtualization is a very,\nvery handy tool to have.\n\n1425\n01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:36,770\nAlso if we're doing analysis\ntoo with certain things,\n\n1426\n01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:40,870\nyou can isolate stuff to the VM and\ndo analysis right in there.\n\n1427\n01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:43,300\nAnd then with what you\ndetermine what's going on,\n\n1428\n01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,850\nif there's a piece of malware\nof something in there.\n\n1429\n01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:47,610\nSince it's contained within that sandbox,\n\n1430\n01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:52,640\nyou could just wipe out that sandbox\nnot to worry about redoing things.\n\n1431\n01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,040\nSo you've got that option.\n\n1432\n01:22:55,040 --> 01:23:01,370\nAs far as virtualization options,\nI use Oracle's VirtualBox.\n\n1433\n01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:03,540\nI don't care what you use.\n\n1434\n01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,520\nThere are so many packages out there.\n\n1435\n01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,970\nIf you have access to VMware, use VMware.\n\n1436\n01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:13,177\nYou have access to something else,\nuse that.\n\n1437\n01:23:13,177 --> 01:23:16,920\nWhatever works for you,\n\n1438\n01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,280\nuse it, because they pretty much,\nas far as the virtualization process, for\n\n1439\n01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:25,350\nus and what we're talking about, they're\nall pretty much equal in that respect.\n\n1440\n01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:26,990\n>> Yeah.\nCuz we really just need something to be\n\n1441\n01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:32,340\nable to virtualize a different operating\nsystem that we're running on our platform.\n\n1442\n01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,440\nMaybe there's a tool that\ndoesn't have a Windows port.\n\n1443\n01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,570\nIt's only available in Linux.\n\n1444\n01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:39,290\nI really need what that tool does for me.\n\n1445\n01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:43,499\nSo I can get that virtual machine, run\nLinux inside it and load up those tools.\n\n1446\n01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,250\nSo very key, and as you said,\neasy to build these things up.\n\n1447\n01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,950\nIn the virtual environment, you guys,\nif you haven't taken any of our\n\n1448\n01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:52,110\nvirtualization classes,\nmake sure you check those out.\n\n1449\n01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:56,565\nReally easy to build up that sandbox\nenvironment, do what you gotta do.\n\n1450\n01:23:56,565 --> 01:24:00,025\nTear it down if you need to,\nin relatively short order.\n\n1451\n01:24:00,025 --> 01:24:02,275\nVirtualBox is still free,\nright, I'm pretty sure?\n\n1452\n01:24:02,275 --> 01:24:03,135\n>> Yes, it is still free.\n\n1453\n01:24:03,135 --> 01:24:04,685\n>> So that's a free one.\n\n1454\n01:24:04,685 --> 01:24:09,890\nYou know, Hyper-V, VMware,\nI think VMware has a free version though.\n\n1455\n01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:11,287\n>> Yeah I believe it does.\n\n1456\n01:24:11,287 --> 01:24:12,350\n>> Any one of the work stations.\n\n1457\n01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:15,400\nOne of those is free and\nthen they got their paid version ESX.\n\n1458\n01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:19,410\nAnd then we've got Hyper-V as\nwell as Microsoft which you\n\n1459\n01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:23,900\nalready have a license for\nyour Windows operating system 8.1.\n\n1460\n01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:28,120\nI think Windows 8 and 8.1,\nit's just a feature you can install.\n\n1461\n01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:31,940\nYou can actually run Hyper-V client side,\nHyper-V on your Windows machine.\n\n1462\n01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:35,900\nSo lots of options there when\nit comes to virtualization.\n\n1463\n01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:39,420\nThen we got our big bad boys\nof the products, right?\n\n1464\n01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:43,560\nWe've got what we would think\nof as our forensics suites.\n\n1465\n01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:50,190\n>> Yeah, I've noted these as\nforensics suits cause they do\n\n1466\n01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:55,240\nmore than just a function or\ntwo they do a whole host of functions.\n\n1467\n01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:00,770\nSome of these also tend to be very pricey,\ntoo.\n\n1468\n01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:06,390\nThe one I have on my\nlist is EnCase's product.\n\n1469\n01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:10,070\nEnCase's product is known\nas being very capable.\n\n1470\n01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:16,370\nIt can cut your response time and\ninvestigation time down dramatically.\n\n1471\n01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:20,770\nIf you have access to it but\nit is very pricey and\n\n1472\n01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:25,870\ntypically you need a lot of specialized\ntraining to be able to use it\n\n1473\n01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:29,470\nto do what it needs to be done with it.\n\n1474\n01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:35,150\nSo that's the deal with\nthat piece of software,\n\n1475\n01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:41,040\nthey're tight on the wraps and\nso expensive and so powerful.\n\n1476\n01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:45,750\nThat they keep it controlled by\neven giving you a dongle that\n\n1477\n01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:48,730\nyou have to plug into\nthe system to even run it.\n\n1478\n01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:52,470\nSo it's one of those few that you\nstill see employ that technology.\n\n1479\n01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:53,310\n>> Yeah, it is.\n\n1480\n01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:56,317\nI have seen some people using EnCase and\nit's an amazing suite.\n\n1481\n01:25:56,317 --> 01:26:02,610\nBut yeah, it is not something\nthat we can just go out and buy.\n\n1482\n01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:04,520\nRelatively expensive.\n\n1483\n01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,830\nIt's not easy to get training and\neverything like that but\n\n1484\n01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:12,080\nif you were in the business of\nbeing a forensic investigator,\n\n1485\n01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,690\na tool like this could really, as you\nwere saying, save you a lot of time.\n\n1486\n01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:17,630\nBecause as you're doing this analysis and\n\n1487\n01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:22,590\nstuff it keeps track of generating\nlogs of what you're doing and\n\n1488\n01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:27,930\nthings like that so it could be worth\nthe money if you're doing a lot of this.\n\n1489\n01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:28,570\n>> Mm-hm, yes.\n>> And\n\n1490\n01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:32,340\nit's not the only one in\nthe basket out there right?\n\n1491\n01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:37,330\n>> Yeah far from,\nthere's other players in this space.\n\n1492\n01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:42,330\nI wanna mention Autopsy's another one.\n\n1493\n01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,450\nThere's Sleuth Kit.\n\n1494\n01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,930\nI think someone mentioned\nAccess FTK earlier.\n\n1495\n01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,550\nThere's bunches of them out there.\n\n1496\n01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:57,170\nAnd I'm not even scratching\nthe surface on it.\n\n1497\n01:26:57,170 --> 01:27:02,670\nWe're going to look at\nAutopsy within this course.\n\n1498\n01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:09,323\nWe're not gonna see anything on EnCase at\nall because I don't have a license of it.\n\n1499\n01:27:09,323 --> 01:27:13,228\nAnd we're not gonna buy\na license [LAUGH] just for\n\n1500\n01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:16,750\ndoing that because of how expensive it is.\n\n1501\n01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,500\nAnd you know the reality is,\n\n1502\n01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,250\nprobably a lot of you aren't\ngoing to have access to it.\n\n1503\n01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:25,910\nSo even if we did wanna demo it here,\nit's kind of like, well,\n\n1504\n01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:28,900\nwe demoed it and showed you how to do it,\nbut there's no way you can\n\n1505\n01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:33,860\nactually do any hands-on at all for\nyourself unless you've got that tool.\n\n1506\n01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:36,240\nAnd I don't even want to say\nhow much a license cost,\n\n1507\n01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,810\ncuz I [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1508\n01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:39,870\n>> I know we're talking thousands and\nthousands,\n\n1509\n01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:41,820\nI just don't know how many zeros.\n\n1510\n01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:43,910\n>> I think there's\ndefinitely a comma in there.\n\n1511\n01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:47,543\nThere's probably a couple of digits in\nfront of the comma last time I looked.\n\n1512\n01:27:47,543 --> 01:27:49,367\nThe only time I've ever even seen it,\n\n1513\n01:27:49,367 --> 01:27:53,023\nit was through a law enforcement agency\nbecause they had the license for it.\n\n1514\n01:27:53,023 --> 01:27:54,648\nAnd they're very strict on\nwho they'll actually sell to.\n\n1515\n01:27:54,648 --> 01:27:58,771\nNot only do you need the money but,\nI don't think, me as a private citizen,\n\n1516\n01:27:58,771 --> 01:28:02,509\ncan even walk up even if I've got\nthe $20 grand to throw down on it or\n\n1517\n01:28:02,509 --> 01:28:04,650\nsomething like that, I can't buy it.\n\n1518\n01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:05,832\nThey're very particular, so\n\n1519\n01:28:05,832 --> 01:28:11,450\nthey wanna keep it out of the bad\nguys' hands and things like that.\n\n1520\n01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:13,940\nSo, it makes sense I suppose.\n\n1521\n01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:16,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I really want it, dang it.\n\n1522\n01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:16,950\nI wanna copy of that.\n\n1523\n01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:20,450\nSo anyway, we have lots of different\nsuites as you've mentioned in case\n\n1524\n01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:22,110\nAutospy, or Autopsy, sorry.\n\n1525\n01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,900\nGood software there.\n\n1526\n01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:29,580\nLast on our list of software\nthat we might wanna include,\n\n1527\n01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:33,240\nin our forensics lab is those\ngood old dry scrubbers.\n\n1528\n01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:37,040\n>> Yeah, that's something\nthat should be in your kit,\n\n1529\n01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,870\nsomeplace is having a drive scrubber.\n\n1530\n01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:44,140\nWhat a drive scrubber's gonna do, or drive\nwiper utility, is it's gonna do just that.\n\n1531\n01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,430\nIt's gonna clean off\nstuff after you're done.\n\n1532\n01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:53,250\nYou should always be prepared to do that,\nwipe off what's left behind\n\n1533\n01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:58,000\nafter your done, so you can get\nthat media ready for other use.\n\n1534\n01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,480\nThat's the whole long and short of that.\n\n1535\n01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,890\nAnd that's just one of those\nother kind of general utilities.\n\n1536\n01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:10,330\nYou could probably, all of you could\nprobably think of other tools that you\n\n1537\n01:29:10,330 --> 01:29:16,160\ncould include, as part of your lab,\nand see those being useful.\n\n1538\n01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:19,640\nI can see that a lot of guys\nhave experience in some way,\n\n1539\n01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,780\nshape, or form with this, or\nif you're not already doing it,\n\n1540\n01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:26,380\nyou probably would have solutions\nto add to the list too.\n\n1541\n01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:30,584\nBut these are the ones that, these are\njust some of the ones that we're either\n\n1542\n01:29:30,584 --> 01:29:34,982\ngonna see in here, or something that you\nshould go ahead and examine yourself and\n\n1543\n01:29:34,982 --> 01:29:37,135\nto be aware of and start adding them in.\n\n1544\n01:29:37,135 --> 01:29:38,283\n>> Nice.\n\n1545\n01:29:38,283 --> 01:29:40,059\nLet me make one quick correction.\n\n1546\n01:29:40,059 --> 01:29:42,423\nI was checking out incase's website there,\nits only about three grand for\n\n1547\n01:29:42,423 --> 01:29:43,599\na single license of their software.\n\n1548\n01:29:43,599 --> 01:29:47,896\n>> Well that's a bargain.\n\n1549\n01:29:47,896 --> 01:29:49,137\n>> That's a deal.\n\n1550\n01:29:49,137 --> 01:29:51,193\n>> That's different.\n\n1551\n01:29:51,193 --> 01:29:54,930\n>> [LAUGH] In that case, let me get two.\n\n1552\n01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:58,693\nOr as the joke we used to say, that the\nsoftware's free, the dongle's three grand.\n\n1553\n01:29:58,693 --> 01:30:00,669\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what it is, and\n\n1554\n01:30:00,669 --> 01:30:03,452\nI do mention that you cannot\nbuy the dongle online.\n\n1555\n01:30:03,452 --> 01:30:06,050\nYou have to call them for that, so.\n\n1556\n01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:10,290\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nwe talked about our drive scrubbers.\n\n1557\n01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:13,770\nI didn't throw up any handy links,\nsorry, I was looking up in case,\n\n1558\n01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:15,840\ndid you mention any\nparticular products there?\n\n1559\n01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,200\n>> I don't have any particular\nproducts for doing drive scrubbing,\n\n1560\n01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:24,100\nI'll let you guys just go ahead and\nchoose that for yourself.\n\n1561\n01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:27,630\nThere's so\nmany different of those ones out there.\n\n1562\n01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:31,250\nThere's ones that do the DOD three pass,\nand seven pass, and\n\n1563\n01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:33,210\nthen even higher than that.\n\n1564\n01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:37,730\nSome people even say nowadays you don't\neven need to do that many passes for it,\n\n1565\n01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:40,190\nyou can do one pass and be fine.\n\n1566\n01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:42,677\nAnd then we have drives,\n\n1567\n01:30:42,677 --> 01:30:47,190\nthat's a whole different ballgame,\nthat we haven't got to.\n\n1568\n01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:48,500\nYeah.\n\n1569\n01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:54,180\nSo you just mentioned the category of\ndrive scrubber, you pick your own.\n\n1570\n01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:58,480\nWhatever one you feel comfortable with and\nyou like, go ahead.\n\n1571\n01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,530\nI don't got a problem with it.\n\n1572\n01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:02,660\n>> As long as it's getting of\nall the data on that drive, and\n\n1573\n01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:06,460\ndo it in a sound manner that's\naccepted and we should be good to go.\n\n1574\n01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,720\n>> Yeah.\nTest the results, and test the results so\n\n1575\n01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:09,678\nyou can trust it.\n\n1576\n01:31:09,678 --> 01:31:12,400\n>> Cuz you're gonna have\nsoftware that recovers files, so\n\n1577\n01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,810\nyou could wipe your drive and\nsee if you can recover any files,\n\n1578\n01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:17,430\nand let you know how that\nwiping software is doing.\n\n1579\n01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,030\nAll right, well very good.\n\n1580\n01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:21,030\nWell, anything else Shawn,\n\n1581\n01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:25,220\nthat we can add in here to our\npretty long list of software?\n\n1582\n01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:29,870\n>> That's kind of a loaded question,\nthough, right?\n\n1583\n01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:31,041\n>> I know.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1584\n01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:32,585\n>> Had a law down there.\n\n1585\n01:31:32,585 --> 01:31:38,470\nAnd there's a lot of stuff,\nthat we could definitely add to this list,\n\n1586\n01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:42,410\nwe could sit here for the next\ncouple days at least if not longer.\n\n1587\n01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:45,430\nAnd talk about different\ntypes of software, but\n\n1588\n01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:51,170\nthese are the ones that are of\nmost value to us at this point.\n\n1589\n01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:53,400\nIf you know some of these tools, great.\n\n1590\n01:31:54,610 --> 01:32:00,230\nIf not, you're gonna see a good number\nof them in use during this course.\n\n1591\n01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:05,290\nSo some pretty exciting stuff, but\nlike I said once you see the type of\n\n1592\n01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:10,320\nthings you have to do for investigation\nand understand it, you can use tools or.\n\n1593\n01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,360\nBias just talking about it.\n\n1594\n01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:16,045\nYou'll kind of get an idea what\ntools you need to take a look for.\n\n1595\n01:32:16,045 --> 01:32:22,630\nSo to add one more thing to put into that,\nis these tools,\n\n1596\n01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:27,840\nhopefully, with the links we're flying,\nhot and heavy through the chat room.\n\n1597\n01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,710\nHopefully, you guys are gonna\ntake some time to start\n\n1598\n01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:32,189\ndownloading some of this stuff.\n\n1599\n01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:36,600\nIt's great that this is coming\nup at the end of the session,\n\n1600\n01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:41,180\nat the end of the day on this because,\nnow you've got some time to go ahead and\n\n1601\n01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:42,840\nstart grabbing some of these tools.\n\n1602\n01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,140\nWhich some of them are big.\n\n1603\n01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:46,105\nThey may take some time.\n\n1604\n01:32:46,105 --> 01:32:48,805\n>> Yeah, so download some of those and\nmaybe you'll get a chance to kinda play\n\n1605\n01:32:48,805 --> 01:32:53,565\nalong with us, or once you see us doing\nsome of the demos in the future episodes.\n\n1606\n01:32:53,565 --> 01:32:57,365\nYou can try it yourself on your own little\nvirtual sandbox or something like that.\n\n1607\n01:32:57,365 --> 01:33:00,100\nSo, go out there and\nstart getting some of that together.\n\n1608\n01:33:01,602 --> 01:33:04,650\nAll right ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode,\n\n1609\n01:33:04,650 --> 01:33:07,240\nsetting up our computer forensics lab.\n\n1610\n01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,510\nWe appreciate everyone for tuning in.\n\n1611\n01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:11,950\nRemember if you've got\na question during the

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,070\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,290\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,470\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,740\n>> Doing great, how about you?\n\n9\n00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,850\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,040\nLooking forward to another exciting\nepisode in our digital forensic\n\n11\n00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,810\ninvestigator series.\n\n12\n00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,920\nToday, in this episode, we're gonna\nbe talking about search and seizure,\n\n13\n00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,900\nprimarily searching and seizing computers.\n\n14\n00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,917\nSo sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.\n\n15\n00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,310\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n16\n00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,740\nSo where do we start?\n\n17\n00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,610\nWe talked about search and seizing.\n\n18\n00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,226\nSearch and seizures, if I can say that.\n\n19\n00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:07,364\nIf I slow down a little bit.\n\n20\n00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:09,772\nYeah, we we're talking,\nin a previous episode,\n\n21\n00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:12,310\nwe talked a lot about\npreserving a crime scene.\n\n22\n00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,960\n>> Yes.\n>> Gathering evidence, and\n\n23\n00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,040\nthings like that.\n\n24\n00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,270\nSo, when we're talking about searching and\nseizing computers here,\n\n25\n00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,640\nwhat are we really trying to get into?\n\n26\n00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,410\n>> Well, this kinda goes back towards\nthe process that we were talking about.\n\n27\n00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,620\nPulling stuff out of a crime scene.\n\n28\n00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,730\nWe did our whole deal here,\nour simulated crime scene yesterday.\n\n29\n00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,840\nWe didn't really pay too\nmuch attention to that.\n\n30\n00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,390\nIt wasn't something that that was the\nright time to really take that head-on.\n\n31\n00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,000\nThe reality is, is that,\nit is something that you absolutely\n\n32\n00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,629\nneed to take into account, because,\nwithout doing proper search and seizure,\n\n33\n00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,830\nprocedures, without having warrants,\nif that's necessary.\n\n34\n00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,180\nNo matter what you collect will\nbe automatically inadmissible.\n\n35\n00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,580\nSo that's what we're looking at.\n\n36\n00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,930\n>> Yeah.\nSo when we talk about,\n\n37\n00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,960\nwe saw the proper procedures for\ngathering this evidence and\n\n38\n00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,490\nhow to bag it, tag it, keep my chain\nof custody and things like that.\n\n39\n00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,910\nAnd that was a good place to start, but we\nreally need to back up for a second, and\n\n40\n00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,930\nbefore we start at any of that, we need to\nmake sure that we've got permissions to do\n\n41\n00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,850\nthis, that we've got the authority to go\nin there and bag and tag that computer and\n\n42\n00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,990\nall of that evidence.\n\n43\n00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,440\nWe can't just walk into somebody's house\nand do this and if you're in a corporate\n\n44\n00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,220\nenvironment, there are certain laws that\nprotect the rights of the individuals\n\n45\n00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,560\nwithin that organization that I've got\nto make sure that I'm not violating.\n\n46\n00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,440\nCuz, as Sean said,\n\n47\n00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,550\nif we do any of that, it's very easy to\nget that evidence tossed out of court.\n\n48\n00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,610\nAnd not only that, but\nanything gained from.\n\n49\n00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,440\nLike if we had seized\nthat computer illegal.\n\n50\n00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,880\nIf we hadn't followed proper procedure,\nand then we go look at information,\n\n51\n00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,270\nwe get evidence.\n\n52\n00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,250\nThere's child pornography\non this computer.\n\n53\n00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,910\nWe could end up getting that thrown out\nbecause we have obtained that evidence\n\n54\n00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,840\nillegally.\n\n55\n00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,800\nAnd so now, we can't use that evidence.\n\n56\n00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,580\nAnd we know,\nwe'd have to try to go about finding\n\n57\n00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,630\nthat same evidence in some other way,\nor something like that.\n\n58\n00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,940\nBut it can cause huge problems, if not,\nget the case thrown out altogether.\n\n59\n00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,800\n>> Yes. Yeah. I mean, you could have\nscenarios where evidence is thrown out and\n\n60\n00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,460\nthat may be just a part of your case, but\nyou still may have enough without it.\n\n61\n00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,460\nYou could have a major part of your\ncase thrown out, and everything\n\n62\n00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,810\nelse you have is not enough,\nand that has happened.\n\n63\n00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,340\nAll these scenarios have happened, where\nyou get a big chunk of your case gets\n\n64\n00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,250\nthrown out, and now you no longer\nhave that element you need to prove,\n\n65\n00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,510\nto prove your point, and the thing is,\nis that you don't get a second chance.\n\n66\n00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,860\nYou can't, well at least here in the US,\n\n67\n00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,860\nI can't attest to all\nthe laws around the world.\n\n68\n00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,725\nI can't attest to the laws here, you know,\nand all of them in here in the US, either.\n\n69\n00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:01,935\nThat's not my specialty.\n\n70\n00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:05,805\nBut, you know, one of the things\nwe do have here in the US is that,\n\n71\n00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:09,395\nif you screw up and collect it the wrong\nway, you don't get a second chance.\n\n72\n00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:10,615\nYou can't retry that.\n\n73\n00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:16,400\nYou can't do double jeopardy in there,\nthat's the way it works, so\n\n74\n00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,790\nyou're done, and people have walked that\neveryone knew was guilty, they've walked\n\n75\n00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,990\nbecause of little technical details and\nyou don't want that in your conscience.\n\n76\n00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,800\nSecond of all, that very well could be\nthe end of your career, right there.\n\n77\n00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,380\n>> Absolutely,\n\n78\n00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,690\nI'm not going to hire a forensic\ninvestigator that has a track record of\n\n79\n00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,810\nnot following procedures or getting cases\nthrown out of court or things like that.\n\n80\n00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,410\nSo yeah, it could definitely\nend my career really quickly.\n\n81\n00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,090\nYeah [LAUGH].\n\n82\n00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,360\nTheir shortest career ever.\n\n83\n00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,700\n>> So one of the first things, I guess,\n\n84\n00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,570\nwe talk about searching and seizing\ncomputers, without a warrant, all right.\n\n85\n00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:56,228\nBecause most of the time,\nwe're gonna need a warrant.\n\n86\n00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:59,640\n>> That's a tricky one,\nyou may need a warrant.\n\n87\n00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,680\nAnd this is where, and\nto kinda back it up a bit,\n\n88\n00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,410\nto make sure that we put this in\nthe proper context here of how you\n\n89\n00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,130\nwould determine this, and who might\nbe around to help you determine this.\n\n90\n00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:18,720\nIt's not uncommon, for example, at a\ncorporate level, to have a forensic person\n\n91\n00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,680\nas part of your Instant Response Team and\nthe Instant Response Team isn't just you,\n\n92\n00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,630\nyou have your IT people,\nthat's someone representing IT,\n\n93\n00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,170\nyou have someone representing a security\ndepartment, if you have that.\n\n94\n00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,320\nAnd then you have human resources,\nand you have spokespeople.\n\n95\n00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,440\nYou have somebody that's at\nthe C-level of the company.\n\n96\n00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,120\nAnd then somewhere in there,\nyou usually have a lawyer.\n\n97\n00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,390\nYou have a representative\nfrom the legal department,\n\n98\n00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,280\nthat's a designated point of contact.\n\n99\n00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,250\nSo, if an instance reported that they feel\nthat you need to come in and investigate.\n\n100\n00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,640\nYou're gonna be consulting or some of\nthe teams are going to be consulting with\n\n101\n00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,660\nthat lawyer,\nto see what's the best way to proceed.\n\n102\n00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,740\nSo that, that's one thing\nthat acts as a safety net.\n\n103\n00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,068\nYou know, at least in the corporate\nside on, you know, on the criminal side,\n\n104\n00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,741\nyou know, you're gonna be called\nin with the police department or\n\n105\n00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:15,758\nyou're gonna called in, your sources\nis gonna be called in by a lawyer.\n\n106\n00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:19,195\nYou still wanna see to the best\nof your knowledge and ability,\n\n107\n00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:21,170\nmake sure everything's done.\n\n108\n00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,310\nBut they're gonna have done\na lot of that for you.\n\n109\n00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,570\nBut you don't always need the warrant and\nthat's what we're talking about here.\n\n110\n00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,769\nIt might be that you, it might be that.\n\n111\n00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,270\nYou already think that you need\na warrant for every specific case.\n\n112\n00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,410\nBut you don't need it for every case,\nand kind of need to know the difference.\n\n113\n00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,200\n>> All right.\n\n114\n00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,940\nSo we're talking about without a warrant.\n\n115\n00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,110\nHere in the US,\nwe've got our US Constitution.\n\n116\n00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,040\nAnd we've got something called\nthe Fourth Amendment, right.\n\n117\n00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,623\n>> Yes.\n>> And\n\n118\n00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:54,112\nthat gives individuals in our country,\nin the US here,\n\n119\n00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:58,357\na lot of protection against unlawful\nsearch and seizures, right.\n\n120\n00:06:58,357 --> 00:07:03,675\n>> Yes, the Fourth Amendment does\ngive you protection in that,\n\n121\n00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:07,160\nso law enforcement is not allowed to do.\n\n122\n00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,120\nUnreasonable search and seizures,\nthey can do certain things, yes.\n\n123\n00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,732\nAnd there are certain ways that they\n\n124\n00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:23,370\ndon't need to follow the Fourth Amendment.\n\n125\n00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,220\nBut those are very specific, you know,\n\n126\n00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,880\nthat's one of the things\nwith search warrants.\n\n127\n00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,840\nSearch warrants, when they issue you one.\n\n128\n00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,860\nWhen you get one,\nit's very narrow and focused.\n\n129\n00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,222\nOne of the things I was talking about with\nthis crime scene we had simulated here,\n\n130\n00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:43,263\nis that crime scene I said, if you're\ngonna be getting a warrant for that,\n\n131\n00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:47,693\nyou know, make note of anything that would\ndistinguish that system from any other\n\n132\n00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:49,000\nsystem in that office.\n\n133\n00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,769\nBecause I want to make sure,\nif I'm asking for\n\n134\n00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:55,038\na search warrant to search\nany further on that system.\n\n135\n00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,850\nIt will specifically be that system,\nnot the one next to it.\n\n136\n00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,136\nAnd it may be tough, I mean,\nif you're an organization that runs,\n\n137\n00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:07,711\nlet's just say a bunch of Dell computers\nand they're all the same model,\n\n138\n00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:10,478\nyou're gonna have to find something,\na serial number or\n\n139\n00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,613\nsomething on there that distinguishes\nit from something else.\n\n140\n00:08:13,613 --> 00:08:17,038\nOtherwise, if it's too generic,\nthey're not gonna issue it.\n\n141\n00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,334\nThose things, those ideas that they put\nout in the movies and all that saying,\n\n142\n00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,267\nhere's a blanket search warrant,\ngo in and do a rotor rooter job on it.\n\n143\n00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:26,809\nIt ain't going to happen.\n\n144\n00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:30,941\nIt's just not going to happen.\n\n145\n00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:36,096\nIf you're issued a search warrant, and\nyou find something that is in addition\n\n146\n00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:41,014\nto what you were looking for, you may\nactually have to ask for an adjustment\n\n147\n00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:45,570\nto your existing search warrant to\nbe able to collect that evidence.\n\n148\n00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,854\nBut you can seal off the scene.\n\n149\n00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:50,573\n>> Absolutely, if you think\nthat you might be going outside\n\n150\n00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:53,974\nthe bounds of that warrant,\nthat's when you need to stop, step back,\n\n151\n00:08:53,974 --> 00:08:56,655\ndon't touch anything,\ndon't do anything with that.\n\n152\n00:08:56,655 --> 00:09:01,274\nAnd go talk to the judge or whoever it\nis about getting a different warrant, or\n\n153\n00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,810\nadding or\namending the existing warrant, right.\n\n154\n00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,798\nBecause we need probable cause.\n\n155\n00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:11,000\nI mean, that's really what it comes down\nto is law enforcement in the US here.\n\n156\n00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,694\nWe need probable cause, or they need\nprobable cause before they can go and\n\n157\n00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:16,974\nexecute these types of search and\nseizures.\n\n158\n00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:20,874\nAnd they've gotta take that cause to\na judge and get that warrant signed, and\n\n159\n00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:24,894\nthat's what gives them then the permission\nto come inside my home for example,\n\n160\n00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:26,545\nand start gathering evidence.\n\n161\n00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:27,878\n>> Yeah, and that's the thing.\n\n162\n00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:28,806\nProbable cause.\n\n163\n00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:32,991\nYou might think that just being one of\n\n164\n00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:37,852\nthe situations that some\nof us have run into\n\n165\n00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:42,982\nis that if you get pulled\nover by the police for\n\n166\n00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:47,120\nspeeding or running a stop sign.\n\n167\n00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,125\nAnd they say, hey, can I search your car?\n\n168\n00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,574\nYou can say no.\n\n169\n00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:53,918\nYou can say no at that point for\nsomething like that,\n\n170\n00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:58,706\nbecause a speeding ticket, or running\na stop sign or something like that is\n\n171\n00:09:58,706 --> 00:10:02,820\nnot considered probable cause\nto search that whole vehicle.\n\n172\n00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,359\nIt's just not, well you know.\n\n173\n00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:07,924\n>> If you say no, that's gonna give\nthat officer a little bit of like,\n\n174\n00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:10,130\nwhat the heck,\nwhy didn't he want me to search his car?\n\n175\n00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,909\nHe might go and try to obtain\na warrant to search your car.\n\n176\n00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:17,019\nBut I know here in the US if the officer\nis not in any type of a perceived danger\n\n177\n00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:21,259\nor anything like that, he doesn't see\na weapon laying out there on the seat,\n\n178\n00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:25,080\nthey don't have the right to come in and\nsearch that car.\n\n179\n00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,750\nA good question we had in\nthe chat room there from Deborah.\n\n180\n00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,806\nComputer is considered a closed container,\nso you'd need to seize the computer but\n\n181\n00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:35,260\nwould still need a warrant to search\nthe contents of the computer?\n\n182\n00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,141\n>> Yeah, you're right on with that\nDeborah, is that a computer is considered\n\n183\n00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:44,872\nor there's this closed container\ndoctrine that if it's not something,\n\n184\n00:10:44,872 --> 00:10:48,301\nif it is a file cabinet,\na box, something like that,\n\n185\n00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:53,186\nsomething that you can't actually\nsee what's in there, it's considered\n\n186\n00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:58,106\na closed container, not something\nyou'd actually have direct access to.\n\n187\n00:10:58,106 --> 00:10:59,941\nSo, you need a search warrant.\n\n188\n00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:03,053\nHere in the US,\nthe Supreme Court already decided that was\n\n189\n00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:06,303\nthe way it was going to work,\nthat it's a closed container.\n\n190\n00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:08,393\nIf it's a closed container,\nyou have to search it.\n\n191\n00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:13,409\nThe closed container doctrine's\nbeen around for quite a while.\n\n192\n00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:17,773\nAnd that was something that had to be\nre-assessed for the digital world.\n\n193\n00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:22,717\nIs that, the digital world,\nthis device, it's not a container,\n\n194\n00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:26,184\nin a traditional sense,\nper se, but you know,\n\n195\n00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:29,900\nit's kind of difficult\nto look at it that way.\n\n196\n00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:35,920\nBut it has been determined that a computer\nis considered to be a closed case,\n\n197\n00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,334\nso yes you can potentially seize it, but\nyou can't search it without a warrant.\n\n198\n00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,260\nBut again, we're going to talk\nabout some exceptions to that.\n\n199\n00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,907\nYou know, because there\nare some specific exceptions.\n\n200\n00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:52,353\nEven to the one some of you might be\nshaking your head, saying, oh, well,\n\n201\n00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:56,970\nthe police can, I don't know,\nI might have some police officers in here.\n\n202\n00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,488\nWe don't know that.\n\n203\n00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:00,820\nThey might be saying, yeah, I can.\n\n204\n00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,681\nYeah, there's exceptions that would allow\nthem in that case to search your vehicle,\n\n205\n00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:09,343\nand there's cases that would allow\nthem to go inside a computer,\n\n206\n00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,032\nbut we are gonna get to those.\n\n207\n00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:13,122\nBut that's a very good catch.\n\n208\n00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:16,190\nI think you also mentioned the one\nthat Scott has on here too.\n\n209\n00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:21,238\nI think, Scott, you're referring to\nthe MAC address about the specific system,\n\n210\n00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:26,226\nof identifying a specific system for a\nsearch warrant, would a MAC address work?\n\n211\n00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:29,587\nIt very well could, as long as you,\n\n212\n00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:35,303\nprobably the easiest way to use\na MAC address is if the network\n\n213\n00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:41,000\ncard is on that board,\nas a unit, you can't remove it.\n\n214\n00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,250\nIf it's a card that can be bolted in and\nremoved, an expansion card, you probably\n\n215\n00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,437\ncould still do it, but then you're going\nto have to prove a little bit more that,\n\n216\n00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:51,245\nyeah, that one wasn't swapped.\n\n217\n00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:54,443\nIt's hard to prove that\na whole motherboard, or\n\n218\n00:12:54,443 --> 00:12:59,357\nit's easier to prove that a whole\nmotherboard hasn't been swapped out and\n\n219\n00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:01,865\nall that, versus pulling a card out.\n\n220\n00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,028\nSo,\n>> So, we've got this Fourth Amendment\n\n221\n00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:09,250\nthere in the US that protects us against\nunreasonable search and seizure.\n\n222\n00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,920\nWe've got our probable cause\nthat's going to be necessary\n\n223\n00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,860\nto obtain that warrant, and we've got\nto make sure that if we are obtaining\n\n224\n00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,700\na warrant that it covers everything that\nwe're going to be searching and seizing.\n\n225\n00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,090\nBut to go back to a little\nbit more without a warrant,\n\n226\n00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,200\nand we got a good segue question in there.\n\n227\n00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,980\nWe talked about reasonable privacy or\nexpectation of privacy.\n\n228\n00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,100\nAnd this is a big concern when we're\ndoing these types of investigations.\n\n229\n00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,820\nAnd especially in the corporate world,\nI think maybe even more,\n\n230\n00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:45,040\nbecause we've got laws that specify\nthat right to privacy in the US.\n\n231\n00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,835\nBut, we get into the corporate side of\nthings, that changes it up a little bit.\n\n232\n00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:51,947\nI know, we've got a question from Chris.\n\n233\n00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:56,000\nIsn't a computer in an office\nconsidered company property, and\n\n234\n00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,482\nthe user has no rights?\n\n235\n00:13:57,482 --> 00:13:59,021\nYou know, it's a tough one right?\n\n236\n00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:00,785\n>> Yeah, we're going to have some\ninteresting discussions here.\n\n237\n00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:03,116\n>> Yeah.\n>> You guys are on the ball though.\n\n238\n00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:05,612\nThese are all great things, so\n\n239\n00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:10,316\nkeep the questions coming\nbecause these are things that,\n\n240\n00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:16,080\nI've been doing this for a while,\nand I've had discussions on it.\n\n241\n00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,550\nAnd so, it's a common thing, and\n\n242\n00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,914\nit's been around that these questions\nhave been around the field for a while.\n\n243\n00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:22,980\nIt's good to kind of\nmake sure we're clear.\n\n244\n00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,706\nThat one as far as a company owning\na computer sounds like, well yeah,\n\n245\n00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:27,345\nyou own it.\n\n246\n00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:28,196\nYou should be allowed to search it, right?\n\n247\n00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:30,147\n>> Sounds like a no brainer.\n\n248\n00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:34,395\n>> You can't necessarily in every case.\n\n249\n00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:39,851\nThere are situations where if the company\ncrafts their paperwork correctly and\n\n250\n00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:44,900\nwhen you are oriented into the company and\nsigning in, all your stuff, or\n\n251\n00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,951\nlater on, they have everyone sign\npaperwork telling them that we're now\n\n252\n00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:54,855\nchanging the policy to do this and\nmaking them aware of it ahead of time.\n\n253\n00:14:54,855 --> 00:15:00,645\nThen, yeah, but\nit's very tough to do after the fact.\n\n254\n00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:06,719\nIf I was gonna be doing forensic\ninvestigations here at this site,\n\n255\n00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:11,817\nI'm somewhat limited in going\nto someone's system and\n\n256\n00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:15,840\nsaying, I'm gonna start investigating.\n\n257\n00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,764\nEven though it's owned by the company,\n\n258\n00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:24,760\nI'm very limited because they do have\na reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\n259\n00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,365\n>> Absolutely.\n\n260\n00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:28,408\nAnd that's what, and again you guys\nare on top of it in our chat room here.\n\n261\n00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:31,286\nWe see a bunch of comments about,\nyou sign that away.\n\n262\n00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,517\nAnd that's exactly what you're doing.\n\n263\n00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:35,410\nWhen you get hired on by a company,\nas Sean says,\n\n264\n00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:40,354\nif they've got the proper paperwork in\nplace, your signing agreements that say,\n\n265\n00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:43,125\nyou're losing that expectation of privacy.\n\n266\n00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,923\nThat paperwork, that hire packet is\ngonna have clauses in there that say,\n\n267\n00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:49,458\nthe computer is considered\na company property and\n\n268\n00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,009\ncan be searched at any\ntime without your consent.\n\n269\n00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:55,981\nThe same thing could apply to your desk,\nbut it does have to be spelled out And\n\n270\n00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:56,739\nagreed upon.\n\n271\n00:15:56,739 --> 00:16:00,633\nThat employee has to sign\nthat when they get hired or\n\n272\n00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:05,010\nwhat have you to provide\nthat right to the company.\n\n273\n00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,250\nIf the company doesn't,\nright, if they don't,\n\n274\n00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,820\na small company typically they don't\neven have a new hire package, right?\n\n275\n00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,650\nThey're just gonna say hey,\nwelcome to the team, slap you on the back.\n\n276\n00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,240\nThere's your desk.\n\n277\n00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,330\nThere's your chair.\n\n278\n00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,630\nYeah, and there's your computer.\n\n279\n00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,240\nHere's your password and let's go.\n\n280\n00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,520\nIn that case now I can start\nbringing in my lawyer.\n\n281\n00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,960\nIf I was the intended victim or\nthe one that was being investigated,\n\n282\n00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,180\nI should say, I could pull that back up,\nand throw it back at them, right?\n\n283\n00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,670\nAnd I could say, oh, wait I have\nan expectation of privacy on this PC.\n\n284\n00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:37,045\nAnd another very good point is,\nwe see a lot of BYOD nowadays, all right?\n\n285\n00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:38,251\n>> Oh, boy.\n\n286\n00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:40,700\n>> This is changing the game completely.\n\n287\n00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,307\n>> I knew that was\ncoming up at some point.\n\n288\n00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:45,745\n>> Yeah, all the sudden now we've got\nsituations where people are bringing their\n\n289\n00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:47,265\nown laptops in.\n\n290\n00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:51,025\nOr they're doing remote desktop or\naccessing resources on their organization\n\n291\n00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:53,990\nfrom their tablets and from their\nsmart phones and things like that.\n\n292\n00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:59,280\nHow as a company,\nthat's gonna be very difficult, right?\n\n293\n00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,690\n>> It's unless you get\nthe paperwork in place.\n\n294\n00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:08,110\nThat's the thing, is that if you're\ngonna be allowing that you need to get\n\n295\n00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:13,220\nthe paperwork in place to say, okay,\nthis is how things are gonna be handled.\n\n296\n00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,980\nSo they're aware of it.\n\n297\n00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,750\nIf that device gets attached to our\nnetwork, this is what you're adhering to.\n\n298\n00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:26,560\nSo yeah, it can be really an interesting\nthing to kinda go through.\n\n299\n00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,010\n>> It really is gonna be tough, and the\nlaws are just definitely not there yet.\n\n300\n00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,877\nI think it's gonna take\nsome time to catch up.\n\n301\n00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:37,015\nI know that some of these systems will\nseparate corporate data from work data,\n\n302\n00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,216\nand I can remote wipe the corporate data.\n\n303\n00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:42,392\nI would imagine at some\npoint they're gonna say, and\n\n304\n00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:47,050\nthis is just me kinda talking, but we can\nsearch your tablet but we have to limit\n\n305\n00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,660\nthe scope of our search to company\ninformation maybe or something like that.\n\n306\n00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,420\nBut is there a way you can do that?\n\n307\n00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,310\nWhat if I put my company information in\nmy pictures folder, my private folder so\n\n308\n00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,860\nI don't know, it is interesting.\n\n309\n00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,450\nIt is something that we're\ngonna have to deal with.\n\n310\n00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,150\nBut for the most part, yeah.\n\n311\n00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,000\nIt's really gonna be on a per\norganization basis depending on\n\n312\n00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,780\nwhat was laid out in the beginning,\nall right?\n\n313\n00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,950\nWe're gonna know what the company said,\nbecause then if I've signed that document,\n\n314\n00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,972\nI can't go back and say that I had some\nexpectation of privacy on this laptop,\n\n315\n00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:21,468\nright?\n\n316\n00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:25,555\n>> Yeah, you can already see a little bit\n\n317\n00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,365\nof the starting of some rumblings\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n318\n00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:28,153\n>> Here.\n\n319\n00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:30,165\n>> Yeah, well,\nwe'll get the whole debate going here.\n\n320\n00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:34,115\nSo I see things like exercise\nyour Fourth Amendment rights,\n\n321\n00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:36,310\nI don't consent to searches.\n\n322\n00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,500\nSorry, you don't own my device, so\nI don't use it for work purposes.\n\n323\n00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,070\nProve that to me.\n\n324\n00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,410\nProve to me that you haven't used\nthat thing for work purposes.\n\n325\n00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,940\nAnd I'm just playing\ndevil's advocate here.\n\n326\n00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,020\nI'm not siding one way or the other.\n\n327\n00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,099\nBut in an investigation you're going\nto tell me you didn't use that for\n\n328\n00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,140\nwork purposes, but how do I know\nthat you wouldn't lie to me, right?\n\n329\n00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,589\nAs being the target of my investigation,\nyou would never lie.\n\n330\n00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:00,498\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n331\n00:19:00,498 --> 00:19:05,287\nit's a question of what\nthe situation would necessitate.\n\n332\n00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:10,717\nIf you own a device and\nsay you don't use it for work purposes,\n\n333\n00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:16,669\nthen, and I suspect that there may\nbe a little lying going on there,\n\n334\n00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:20,972\nthen I'll just see if I\ncan get a warrant issued.\n\n335\n00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:23,807\nI'll go through law enforcement, say yeah,\nI think they've got something I'll talk to\n\n336\n00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:26,172\nmy legal department and I'll see if I\ncan get a hold of that device that way.\n\n337\n00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,830\n>> Yeah and I'm still gonna have\nto show probable cause, right?\n\n338\n00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,450\nI can't just say I think he's lying,\ngive me his phone.\n\n339\n00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,400\nI'm gonna have to show probable cause\nthat maybe I saw you using it at work,\n\n340\n00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,500\nor somebody can, blah-blah.\n\n341\n00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,670\nThe judges are just gonna say, oh, sure,\ncuz you think you might have used it,\n\n342\n00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,950\nhere's a warrant,\ngo grab his phone or his tablet.\n\n343\n00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,680\nSo there's definitely\nsome protection there.\n\n344\n00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,970\n>> And the other one in\nhere that's interesting is\n\n345\n00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,080\nsaying you don't consent to searches.\n\n346\n00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,020\nYou are definitely welcome to say that\n\n347\n00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,670\nas someone that might be the target\ninvestigation inside a company.\n\n348\n00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,430\nLet's say we're gonna\nput it in that context,\n\n349\n00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,500\nwell, then you don't work for\nthat company.\n\n350\n00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,940\nMost companies will say that you have\nsuch and such a time to review, discuss,\n\n351\n00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,700\nwhatever, this new policy.\n\n352\n00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,640\nAnd if you don't like it, well,\n\n353\n00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,760\nand you can't sign it within 72 hours,\nthen your employment is terminated.\n\n354\n00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,240\n>> Right, and remember,\nthe Fourth Amendment in the US here\n\n355\n00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,500\nprotects me against unreasonable\nsearch and seizure.\n\n356\n00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,380\nIt doesn't say they can't do search and\nseizures.\n\n357\n00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,140\nIf they've got reason to and\nthey can prove that to a judge,\n\n358\n00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,200\nthat judge is gonna sign a warrant and you\ndon't have a choice, you've got to comply.\n\n359\n00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,740\nOr they can arrest you, right?\n\n360\n00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,456\nSo we can say we don't\nwanna be searched but\n\n361\n00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:51,230\nif there's reason they have the right to.\n\n362\n00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,339\n>> It goes to kinda the next\npoint in this list,\n\n363\n00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,600\nthe reasonable privacy part because\nwe can tie those two together.\n\n364\n00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,757\nYou can still do a search even if\nsomeone says they don't consent to\n\n365\n00:21:02,757 --> 00:21:06,088\na search cuz of\nthe Fourth Amendment rights.\n\n366\n00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:10,132\nAs long as you say, yeah, here in the US,\n\n367\n00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:14,870\nas long as that search does\nnot in some way shape or\n\n368\n00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,276\nform, violate your privacy in the process.\n\n369\n00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:20,506\nThey can still do it without a warrant.\n\n370\n00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:24,222\nSo, just gotcha there.\n\n371\n00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:28,431\nSo if your device, if you say, well,\nI don't use my device for this, or\n\n372\n00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:30,984\nI don't consent to\na search of this device,\n\n373\n00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:35,124\nif I can find a way to search that\ndevice without any way, shape or form,\n\n374\n00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:40,053\ngoing into your personal information I\ndon't necessarily need a warrant anymore.\n\n375\n00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:42,400\n>> Right, absolutely.\n\n376\n00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,057\nAnd, the other one you should probably\nthrow out there is the whole abandoned\n\n377\n00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:47,020\nproperty, right?\n\n378\n00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,847\nWhen it comes to that expectation of\nprivacy any kind of abandoned property is\n\n379\n00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:54,309\nyou lose that expectation of privacy.\n\n380\n00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:55,840\nYou've seen the cop shows, right?\n\n381\n00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,810\nThey wait around for the guy.\n\n382\n00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,257\nHere, have a drink of water, right?\n\n383\n00:21:58,257 --> 00:22:01,981\nAnd you take a drink and then they leave\nthe cup or throw it out or whatever, and\n\n384\n00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:05,000\nthen they go grab it and\nget fingerprints off of it.\n\n385\n00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,860\nThat they've lost their expectation of\nprivacy because they have disposed or\n\n386\n00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,690\nabandoned that piece of property.\n\n387\n00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,930\nAnd it would be the same thing in\nour digital forensics as well.\n\n388\n00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,050\nAnd you toss that phone out\nthe window of your car,\n\n389\n00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,655\nit's to try to lose the evidence.\n\n390\n00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:20,234\nWell, you just abandoned that.\nSo\n\n391\n00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:23,874\nnow you have no expectation of\nprivacy on that device, all right?\n\n392\n00:22:23,874 --> 00:22:27,367\n>> Yeah, that's already been tested, too.\n\n393\n00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:29,195\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, there's certain things like\n\n394\n00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:34,380\nthat that has been tried and\njust doesn't turn\n\n395\n00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,130\nout the way you may expect,\nif that was you.\n\n396\n00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,882\n>> You're better off keeping that phone\nin your car, rather than throwing it out,\n\n397\n00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:45,597\nbecause you could still say I have some\nright to privacy on that device, right?\n\n398\n00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,191\n>> Yeah, if you're gonna commit a crime,\nyou better be taking notes right now,\n\n399\n00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:48,694\nso\n>> Yeah,\n\n400\n00:22:48,694 --> 00:22:52,296\ncriminals have never been the smart\nones in the bunch either.\n\n401\n00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:56,644\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's been true sometimes,\n\n402\n00:22:56,644 --> 00:23:00,692\nsince you mentioned\nthe abandoned property one,\n\n403\n00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:06,469\nanother one that could come up in this\ncase or in these situations is what\n\n404\n00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:12,940\nif someone has paperwork that shows\nthat they're doing some bad stuff?\n\n405\n00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,442\nIf they throw those papers in the trash\nand they go to some place that's\n\n406\n00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:21,716\nreasonably public, and\nthat includes if it's behind a company,\n\n407\n00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:26,292\nin that area behind the company,\nin that dumpster, isn't fenced in or\n\n408\n00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:31,556\nsome way kept from having any sort of foot\ntraffic or otherwise go through it, they\n\n409\n00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:36,566\ncan still say it's public and therefore\nthey can sort of go ahead and grab it.\n\n410\n00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,482\nBecause you've, in essence, abandoned it.\n\n411\n00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:39,260\nSo, yeah.\n\n412\n00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,990\nNow, deleted files are not\nthe same as abandoned as\n\n413\n00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,060\nwe're talking here, not in that context.\n\n414\n00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,091\n>> All right, so some other things you\nmentioned in here, third party position.\n\n415\n00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:57,422\nWhat if I give my evidence to you?\n\n416\n00:23:57,422 --> 00:23:58,537\nI'm the target of the investigation.\n\n417\n00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I say, hey, Sean, hold this for me.\n\n418\n00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,527\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's one of the really, really,\n\n419\n00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:13,590\nones that kind of just seems to stick\npeople and just bother them so much.\n\n420\n00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,340\nBut it's been proven time and time again,\nno matter how much you argue it,\n\n421\n00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,930\nthat this is the case.\n\n422\n00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,060\nThird party possession means that,\nyou know let's say,\n\n423\n00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:28,960\nyou have an individual that has\na notebook, that has something on it.\n\n424\n00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,330\nAnd then, they decide,\nor something happens.\n\n425\n00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,060\nAnd you have that computer worked on.\n\n426\n00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,450\nAnd they take it down to\nthe local computer shop.\n\n427\n00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,820\nThat computer shop is going through,\nand is working on the system.\n\n428\n00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,580\nAnd in the course of doing that,\nthey find some sort of illegal or\n\n429\n00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,190\nquestionable activity\ngoing on with that device.\n\n430\n00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,370\nThey can call law enforcement since\nthey've been delegated control of it,\n\n431\n00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,480\nin essence, they are allowed to do that.\n\n432\n00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,840\nAnd they can bring it in.\n\n433\n00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,830\nAnd they can.\n\n434\n00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,980\nThere can be certain types of\nsearches done on that device,\n\n435\n00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,790\nit happened, you know.\n\n436\n00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,260\nAnd if you think it hasn't,\njust look at the number of\n\n437\n00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:12,430\npeople that have been arrested,\nyou know, here, just folks in the U.S..\n\n438\n00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,680\nLook at the number of people\nthat have been arrested for\n\n439\n00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,700\nthings like child pornography,\nfor example.\n\n440\n00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700\nThat took their stuff down to Best Buy\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n441\n00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,620\n>> The computer store here,\n\n442\n00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,990\nand they were like here, can you fix this?\n\n443\n00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,770\nAnd those guys.\n\n444\n00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,340\nThose techs do look at things whether or\nnot we think they do.\n\n445\n00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,700\nA lot of them do poke.\n\n446\n00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,920\nHey, let's see what this\nperson has got on here.\n\n447\n00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,910\nAnd they're not bound by government rules.\n\n448\n00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,120\nSo, if you're not the government.\n\n449\n00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,190\nOr acting on behalf of the government.\n\n450\n00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,565\nOr law enforcement, search warrants\ntend to be a little less necessary.\n\n451\n00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:51,565\nOr a lot less necessary at that point.\n\n452\n00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:56,035\nSo, if that person goes to your computer,\nfinds something questionable.\n\n453\n00:25:56,035 --> 00:25:58,145\nLike that has happened in those cases.\n\n454\n00:25:58,145 --> 00:26:00,875\nLike they found child molesters and\npornographies.\n\n455\n00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,490\nThey found the content on there.\n\n456\n00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,540\nThey called law enforcement.\n\n457\n00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,240\nLaw enforcement looked at it and said,\nokay, yeah, they seized the system.\n\n458\n00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,940\nThey did get warrants to do\nadditional stuff and they went, and\n\n459\n00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,640\npicked up the person.\n\n460\n00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,950\nAnd the person said, well I didn't\nconsent to having you do this.\n\n461\n00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,952\nDoesn't matter.\n\n462\n00:26:15,952 --> 00:26:17,669\n>> You do, you drop it off at Best Buy.\n\n463\n00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:19,286\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Doesn't matter.\n\n464\n00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,330\n>> And then as you said,\nthe police would have to get the warrant.\n\n465\n00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,550\nBut the fact that the guy that told\nthe police the evidence was there,\n\n466\n00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,590\nyou didn't need that warrant.\n\n467\n00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,100\nAll right.\nAnd so\n\n468\n00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,400\nthe police are going to come\ndown there with a warrant.\n\n469\n00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,740\nAnd do an official search.\n\n470\n00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,830\nAnd find it themselves but\n\n471\n00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,030\nit all got exposed because somebody\nwas working on your computer.\n\n472\n00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,280\nIn our systems,\nhere in the US have said, that's okay.\n\n473\n00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,410\n>> We're gonna allow that.\n\n474\n00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:47,250\nThat person at Best Buy, I'm not saying\nanything bad about Best Buy, by the way.\n\n475\n00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,280\nI'm just saying, as an example,\n\n476\n00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,972\nbecause they're one of the places\nthat has the named cases.\n\n477\n00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:53,697\n>> Mm-hm.\n[CROSSTALK] Been in the news a couple of\n\n478\n00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:54,491\ntimes because of similar things like that.\n\n479\n00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:55,686\n>> Yeah.\n\n480\n00:26:55,686 --> 00:26:56,963\nIn addition to, no, no.\n\n481\n00:26:56,963 --> 00:26:58,538\n[LAUGH]\n\n482\n00:26:58,538 --> 00:26:59,150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n483\n00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:04,000\n>> But they have had situations here where\n\n484\n00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,520\nsomeone at Best Buy and\n\n485\n00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:12,150\nother retailers that do computer\nrepair found that type of content.\n\n486\n00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,650\nAnd when they call law enforcement in,\n\n487\n00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:19,080\nthey'll show law enforcement saying,\nthis is what we found.\n\n488\n00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,410\nAnd that's enough.\n\n489\n00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,920\nLaw enforcement then go search for it.\n\n490\n00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,625\nThey're not bound by those rules\nsince someone else showed it.\n\n491\n00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,710\nAnd\n>> And.\n\n492\n00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,310\n>> I fix friend's PCs all the time.\n\n493\n00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,510\nThey bring their stuff to me and\nthey let me work on it or what have you.\n\n494\n00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:36,250\nAnd if I find something like that, you can\nbelieve I'm gonna be calling the police,\n\n495\n00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,590\nif I find something like that on there.\n\n496\n00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,364\nSo All right.\n\n497\n00:27:40,364 --> 00:27:41,400\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n498\n00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,540\nSo third party possession,\nprobable cause and search warrants.\n\n499\n00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,700\nWe've kind of talk\na little bit about that.\n\n500\n00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,410\nWhat about where we don't need warrants?\n\n501\n00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,700\nThere are some times when\nwe really don't need one.\n\n502\n00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,820\n>> Yeah you don't always need\nto have a search warrant.\n\n503\n00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,820\nWe kind of eluded to some of that.\n\n504\n00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,795\nThere are situations where as Debra,\n\n505\n00:28:02,795 --> 00:28:07,028\nlook at her spit off the circumstances.\n\n506\n00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:07,799\n>> Nice.\n\n507\n00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,152\n>> Oh she's on it.\n\n508\n00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:12,188\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Are you googling that?\n\n509\n00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:16,324\nSo, that's exactly it,\nthough our exigent circumstances that\n\n510\n00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:20,430\nan allow you to proceed\nwithout a search warrant.\n\n511\n00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:26,980\nOne of them is private\nsearches within a company.\n\n512\n00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,580\nTypically, it's been decided as long\nas you are not acting on the behalf of\n\n513\n00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,500\nlaw enforcement or the government,\nyou don't need to have a search warrant.\n\n514\n00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:42,880\nHowever, if during the course of your\npoking around, even at a corporate level,\n\n515\n00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,470\nyou find something that indicates or\ndefinitely is criminal activity.\n\n516\n00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,740\nThen, you have to go to the next step and\nbring in law enforcement.\n\n517\n00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,470\nAnd search warrants start getting issued.\n\n518\n00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,760\nSo you just can't go ahead,\nand go from there and say,\n\n519\n00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,380\nhey, you know,\nI'm gonna start doing whatever.\n\n520\n00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,810\nNo, you have to have a search warrant\nif criminal activity is brought in.\n\n521\n00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,530\nBut if it's just a private\nsearch outside a company,\n\n522\n00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,660\nyou probably don't need it in most cases.\n\n523\n00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,880\nSome lawyers still might.\n\n524\n00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,420\nYour sub-legal departments might say,\n\n525\n00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,270\nhey, let us do some additional\nwork before we do this but, yeah.\n\n526\n00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,720\n>> Another one would be plain view.\n\n527\n00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,540\nRight?\nIf it's in plain view, then,\n\n528\n00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,300\nthere's no expectation to privacy.\n\n529\n00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,260\nAnd I don't need a warrant.\n\n530\n00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,685\n>> Yeah, that's something else.\n\n531\n00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:38,280\nIf it can be seen\n>> Leave it up on your screen.\n\n532\n00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,085\nMaybe I walk by and\nI see it on your monitor there.\n\n533\n00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:45,910\n>> Yeah, that's literally one\nof the things that can happen.\n\n534\n00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,240\nIf someone can actually,\nwithout doing anything that any\n\n535\n00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,190\nreasonable person could be\nable to do without any effort.\n\n536\n00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,250\nAnd see what's on your screen, then done.\n\n537\n00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,980\nI mean, if you happen to be in your\ncar browsing on your notebook.\n\n538\n00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:06,040\nAnd you're looking at something\nillegal on that screen and\n\n539\n00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,960\na cop walks up, and sees that.\n\n540\n00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,920\nNo matter what it is,\n\n541\n00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,080\nif it's something that's illegal,\nyou not only knows it's there now.\n\n542\n00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,920\nHe doesn't need a search warrant.\n\n543\n00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,300\nHe's even, in a lot of cases,\n\n544\n00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,850\nmay have probable cause to\nsearch other stuff in the car.\n\n545\n00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,070\nSo that's on the premises.\n\n546\n00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,740\nThat's all it takes, is for\nhim to have an open, in plain view.\n\n547\n00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,710\nYou know?\n\n548\n00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:38,510\nSo, that's mostly,\na law enforcement type thing,\n\n549\n00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:41,550\nbut I could see it applying\nto some private individuals.\n\n550\n00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,600\nBut mostly, we're talking in\nthis situation, war or no war,\n\n551\n00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,880\nthat's the law enforcement\ngovernment side.\n\n552\n00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,840\nSo yeah, if it's in plain view, that\neliminates at least the initial need for\n\n553\n00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,700\na search warrant.\n\n554\n00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,040\nYou can go in and start doing\nadditional things in that location,\n\n555\n00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,840\nto see what else you might find.\n\n556\n00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,780\n>> All right.\n\n557\n00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,075\nWe got more to talk\nabout with the warrants.\n\n558\n00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:03,005\nWhether we need one.\n\n559\n00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:04,575\nWhen we don't need one.\n\n560\n00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:07,395\nBut looking at our clock,\nit's time for us to take a break.\n\n561\n00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:10,895\nSo we're going to step away for a minute.\n\n562\n00:31:10,895 --> 00:31:12,006\nStay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n563\n00:31:12,006 --> 00:31:17,693\n[SOUND]\nAll right.\n\n564\n00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:19,320\nWelcome back, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n565\n00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,570\nSo, continuing on with our Searching and\nSeizing Computers.\n\n566\n00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,640\nWe left off talking about,\nwhere warrants are not required.\n\n567\n00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,420\nWhen it comes to doing the,\nThe Searching and\n\n568\n00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,050\nSeizing of our Computers in\nour Forensic Investigation.\n\n569\n00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,640\nWe talked about Exigent Circumstances.\n\n570\n00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,810\nWe talked about Plain View.\n\n571\n00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,060\nAnother one might be,\nwhat they call Lawful Arrest.\n\n572\n00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,100\n>> All right.\n\n573\n00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,270\n>> Where as if somebody has been arrested,\nthat kind of opens the door,\n\n574\n00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,160\nto not needing a warrant for\nsearching some of that.\n\n575\n00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,889\nThey get arrested for one thing and\n\n576\n00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:53,456\nthat leads us to be allowed\nto search other things?\n\n577\n00:31:53,456 --> 00:32:00,130\n>> Yes, it does within reason, most of the\nstuff within reason It's kind of obvious,\n\n578\n00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,830\nit's like if you,\nif an officer pulled somebody over, for\n\n579\n00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:10,810\nspeeding, okay they can't search\nthat vehicle like we already said.\n\n580\n00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:16,310\nIf that person happened\nto have a little baggie\n\n581\n00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:20,490\nof whatever sitting on the seat, then that\ntends to change stuff a bit, then they can\n\n582\n00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,400\nstart doing additional levels of searches,\nbecause they're gonna arrest you, and\n\n583\n00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:31,370\nthen there's gonna be other stuff\nthat happens as part of that.\n\n584\n00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,160\nBut again, there's limits.\n\n585\n00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,075\nThey can't.\n\n586\n00:32:34,075 --> 00:32:38,345\n>> By the same token that officer can't\nsay I'm gonna go search your house either\n\n587\n00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:43,195\nbut can search that scene\nif they've arrested you and\n\n588\n00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:46,780\nthe stuff they've arrested you for\nfits within context of that.\n\n589\n00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,190\nThey still may ask for\napproval though in some cases.\n\n590\n00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:55,130\nThey can actually, in some cases,\narrest you, detain you, and\n\n591\n00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:59,820\nthen ask to see if they need to see\na warrant or something like that.\n\n592\n00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,780\n>> Okay.\nAnd then we've got border searches.\n\n593\n00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,935\nWhat's a border search?\n\n594\n00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:10,700\n>> [LAUGH] This is one of the ones that,\nman, just really causes people some grief.\n\n595\n00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,660\nIs, and makes them worry.\n\n596\n00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,850\nBecause if you're within\na certain distance of the border\n\n597\n00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:21,720\nyou can actually still be\nsearched without a warrant.\n\n598\n00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,670\nAnd most people tend to be unaware of it.\n\n599\n00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:28,630\nBut the rule is, or\nthe law is very clear on that matter.\n\n600\n00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:32,900\nIt's not exercised in this way,\nbut thing is it could be.\n\n601\n00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:38,850\nI believe it's if you're within, I want\nto say it's 100 miles of the border,\n\n602\n00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,230\nyou know the border of the U.S.\n\n603\n00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:46,300\nIf you're within 100 miles inside that\nborder technically you could still\n\n604\n00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:52,110\nbe searched without a warrant\nif they really wanted to.\n\n605\n00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,390\nI Yeah.\n\n606\n00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,260\nI think they still require\na little bit of reason, right?\n\n607\n00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,990\nRequire some kind of reasonable suspicion,\nbut it's a little relaxed.\n\n608\n00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:04,480\n>> Well what you'd actually be\ndoing if you think about it,\n\n609\n00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,210\nif you've done international travel and\n\n610\n00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,550\nyou come back and they say they're gonna\ntake your bag and they're gonna search it.\n\n611\n00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,240\nThey don't need to ask you.\n\n612\n00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,360\nThey actually tell you\nthey're going to search it.\n\n613\n00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,400\nThey can do the exact\nsame thing in this case.\n\n614\n00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,560\nThey're exercising, you know, that right.\n\n615\n00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,210\nThey could search your\ncar if they wanted to.\n\n616\n00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,850\n>> So that same search that they can do\nwhen I come through the airport or through\n\n617\n00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,440\ncustoms or across the border, like between\nus and Mexico or something like that.\n\n618\n00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,630\nThey can search me then.\n\n619\n00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,810\nAnd if I'm still within\na certain range of that border,\n\n620\n00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,124\nthey can still execute that search.\n\n621\n00:34:35,124 --> 00:34:35,810\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n622\n00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,690\nYeah, they still have\nthe ability to do that.\n\n623\n00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:44,830\nIt's not exercised, but\ntechnically the way it's written,\n\n624\n00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,240\nit could be done that way.\n\n625\n00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,780\nI know David's saying no,\nthat you can't do it.\n\n626\n00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:57,140\nLook at the way it's actually written, it\ncould be done that way, it could be done,\n\n627\n00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:03,550\nbut it's never really been exercised,\nand it doesn't have to be a checkpoint.\n\n628\n00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:07,030\n>> Yeah, it gives the law\nenforcement a little bit of.\n\n629\n00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,220\n>> I don't know if I would say\nflexibility, but somebody bypasses\n\n630\n00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,720\nthe checkpoint somehow gets around\nthis checkpoint that we've established\n\n631\n00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,960\nthat they're coming through just because\nyou went around the checkpoint and\n\n632\n00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,140\nnow you're not at the checkpoint doesn't\nmean I can't stop and search you, right?\n\n633\n00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n634\n00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,800\n>> So I think that's really\nwhere that comes in to play is,\n\n635\n00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,300\nit gives us that capability to\nexecute the same search we would have.\n\n636\n00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,920\n>> Had you come through the checkpoint\nlike you were supposed to.\n\n637\n00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,460\n>> Yeah,\nthere's some things that they could do.\n\n638\n00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:40,330\nIt would be like if you came in,\nif you didn't come over a checkpoint but\n\n639\n00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:48,290\nyou came across the border from Canada\ninto the US or Mexico into the US.\n\n640\n00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:52,430\nYou're crossing the border but\nnot going over a checkpoint\n\n641\n00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,140\nIf they see you they can\nsearch you at that point.\n\n642\n00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:05,160\nNow, if it's just in the case of\nus here and we're driving around,\n\n643\n00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,026\nif I'm driving down the coastline in\nCalifornia, I'm within a 100 miles of.\n\n644\n00:36:10,026 --> 00:36:13,651\nThat international border.\n\n645\n00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:17,540\nBut for them to say, okay,\nyeah, here you're driving down\n\n646\n00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,770\nHighway 1 in California, we're gonna\ndo a customs and border search, that's.\n\n647\n00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,540\n>> It's not reasonable\nto assume that you just.\n\n648\n00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,710\n>> Drove your car across the Pacific and\njumped on the highway, right, or\n\n649\n00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,120\nanything like that.\n\n650\n00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,610\nAnd this is the US Supreme Court\nthat's saying this.\n\n651\n00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,310\nAnd I'll read you.\n\n652\n00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:36,340\nThe Supreme Court says that routine\nsearches at the border or its functional\n\n653\n00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:41,440\nequivalent, is how they state that, does\nnot require a warrant, probable cause or\n\n654\n00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,730\neven reasonable suspicion that a search\nmay uncover contraband or evidence.\n\n655\n00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,570\nThat's what gives them that right there.\n\n656\n00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:54,420\nAnd they say that if it's going to go\nany further, if the initial search\n\n657\n00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,590\nleads to something or a much more\nextensive search, then they might have to\n\n658\n00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:04,680\nstop and get a warrant to continue.\n\n659\n00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,100\n>> The point that David's\nbringing up is the way.\n\n660\n00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,230\n>> That they use in the real world,\n\n661\n00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:18,380\nthere's the way the law's written and\nthere's the intent of the law.\n\n662\n00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,350\nSo the law can be written a certain way,\n\n663\n00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,330\nthe judge can say well that's not\nthe intent of the actual law,\n\n664\n00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,890\nso that might be where\nthe confusion Is coming in.\n\n665\n00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,730\nThey're saying,\nyou have to have a reasonable cause.\n\n666\n00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:39,230\nYou have to have a permit check point.\n\n667\n00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,350\nYeah, that's the type of stuff\nthey're really looking for.\n\n668\n00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,700\nBut the way they've written it, that\nit could be exercised in the other way.\n\n669\n00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,310\nAnd you know,\nthere are cases where they could do that.\n\n670\n00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:55,310\nYou know, I believe they've done it with\na couple of drones that came from Mexico,\n\n671\n00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,660\nbeing used to deliver drugs.\n\n672\n00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,700\nThey're starting to do that.\n\n673\n00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,820\nYou know, so it can be used, it's just.\n\n674\n00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,140\nPretty much not gonna be used.\n\n675\n00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,920\nDon't expect to be driving somewhere\nin California or somewhere\n\n676\n00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,870\non the East Coast someplace and\nhave the border patrol Border patrol or\n\n677\n00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,430\ncustoms stop you and say,\nhey we're going to search you.\n\n678\n00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,270\nThat's going to get thrown out so\nquickly it will make their head spin.\n\n679\n00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,660\n>> All right, absolutely.\n\n680\n00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,940\nAll right, there are some\ncircumstances then as we've seen.\n\n681\n00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,970\nWhere I might not need a warrant\nto execute this search.\n\n682\n00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,750\nBut then we do have times where\nwe do need a warrant, right?\n\n683\n00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,450\nAnything that doesn't fall into those\nother, and we're not saying that was\n\n684\n00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,570\nan inclusive list, or an all inclusive\nlist, but that sometimes when I might be\n\n685\n00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,680\nable to get away of doing a search\nwithout requiring a warrant.\n\n686\n00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,500\nThere are times of course\nthat I do require more.\n\n687\n00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,520\nThat I'm gonna have to go\nthrough the proper channels and\n\n688\n00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,650\nget a judge to sign a warrant to give\nme permission to execute this search.\n\n689\n00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,550\nWe get into our successful warrants.\n\n690\n00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:04,380\n>> Yes, there's ways to\nsuccessfully execute a warrant.\n\n691\n00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,131\nFirst of all, the Just to reiterate,\n\n692\n00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:13,288\nreasons to execute or\nto issue a warrant is if you're\n\n693\n00:39:13,288 --> 00:39:18,916\nworking on behalf of the government or\nlaw enforcement,\n\n694\n00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:24,096\nthen you pretty much always\nneed a warrant for that.\n\n695\n00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:28,855\nNow just to, kind of,\ncross the line a bit here between\n\n696\n00:39:28,855 --> 00:39:33,305\nthe not needing a warrant,\nand needing a warrant,\n\n697\n00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:40,238\nthere's one little area right between\nthose, to make sure we're clear on it,\n\n698\n00:39:40,238 --> 00:39:46,239\nthere could be situations where you\nwould typically need a warrant,\n\n699\n00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:51,693\nbut because of the situation at hand,\nthey're gonna waive.\n\n700\n00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:55,622\nWill waive it, at least temporarily,\nyour need for that.\n\n701\n00:39:55,622 --> 00:40:00,732\nAnd that is if you have a situation\nwhere a person's going to,\n\n702\n00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,188\nperhaps, flee the scene, or\n\n703\n00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:09,650\nif the scene is in danger of being\ndestroyed or damaged in some way.\n\n704\n00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:16,104\nThen, you can go in and stop it, and\ndo a search without any of that.\n\n705\n00:40:16,104 --> 00:40:19,661\n>> So if I see a guy pouring lighter\nfluid across his computer and\n\n706\n00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:24,286\ngetting ready to light this up, I can\nprobably grab that computer, seize it.\n\n707\n00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:27,577\nBut then I would still have to go back and\nget a warrant before I proceeded, but\n\n708\n00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:30,530\nI'm was protecting the evidence\nthat he was attempting to destroy?\n\n709\n00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:33,100\n>> Yes it could definitely\nbe a situation like that.\n\n710\n00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,420\nYou can just envision a situation\nwhere evidence is in danger,\n\n711\n00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,030\nimminent danger of being destroyed or\nlost, then yes,\n\n712\n00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:49,290\nyou can get in and\ncollect that without a search warrant.\n\n713\n00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:54,430\nAnd there's kind of a narrow window\non that, but it has to be imminent\n\n714\n00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:59,890\ndanger that you definitely know\nthat that's gonna be the situation.\n\n715\n00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,440\n>> You probably would have to\nhave a pretty good expect,\n\n716\n00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,908\na reasonable expectation that there\nis evidence on that computer as well.\n\n717\n00:41:05,908 --> 00:41:10,030\nI can't just say, oh, there might be,\nor have no reason to think there was.\n\n718\n00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,210\nBecause you have a right to destroy\nyour computer if you want to.\n\n719\n00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:12,710\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n720\n00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,151\nIf you want to burn it up,\n\n721\n00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:15,596\na thermite experiment,\n\n722\n00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:18,188\nmaybe that's what you're doing.\n>> In fact,\n\n723\n00:41:18,188 --> 00:41:21,366\nif you're a Mac user I encourage it.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n724\n00:41:21,366 --> 00:41:22,954\n>> I couldn't help it.\n\n725\n00:41:22,954 --> 00:41:24,486\nI couldn't help it, it was too easy.\n\n726\n00:41:24,486 --> 00:41:28,015\n>> I just digged in\n\n727\n00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:29,917\nthere.\n\n728\n00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:30,487\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n729\n00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:31,006\n>> I figured.\n\n730\n00:41:31,006 --> 00:41:34,618\nDavid just explained something to us in\n\n731\n00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:37,090\nhere.\nLives in New Mexico with a Mexican wife\n\n732\n00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,480\nand stepchildren.\n\n733\n00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,600\nI knew there was more to the situation,\nthat he knew, he was living in someplace\n\n734\n00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,330\nor had some unique life situation,\nthat he knew this type of stuff.\n\n735\n00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:52,410\nSo, I was like, okay, I can,\nI'm seeing something here.\n\n736\n00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:56,102\nBecause he's got his\nstuff down pretty well.\n\n737\n00:41:56,102 --> 00:41:58,026\n>> [LAUGH] Yep.\n>> So good on you, I mean,\n\n738\n00:41:58,026 --> 00:42:02,668\nlife experience does quite frequently\nplay a role here, so good on you.\n\n739\n00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:04,827\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n740\n00:42:04,827 --> 00:42:08,439\nAll right, so when do we go\nabout seizing the computers and\n\n741\n00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:12,659\nthere's probably times when I\nshouldn't seize a computer right?\n\n742\n00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:18,110\n>> Yeah, there's gonna be situations for,\nthere are gonna be situations for both.\n\n743\n00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,010\nIf we're talking about\njust getting a warrant\n\n744\n00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,723\nif you know that that asset has been,\nor probably has been,\n\n745\n00:42:24,723 --> 00:42:28,684\nused the commission of a crime,\nor has evidence that you need.\n\n746\n00:42:28,684 --> 00:42:32,213\nThen you're, then that's gonna be\nsomething that if you're doing a criminal\n\n747\n00:42:32,213 --> 00:42:35,542\nsituation, you're gonna need a search\nwarrant, you're just gonna be.\n\n748\n00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:41,830\nUnless it's in plain view, or it's gonna\nbe destroyed or something like that.\n\n749\n00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:46,650\nThere's also another one in there as well,\nthat could waive your right for\n\n750\n00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,390\na search warrant, or\nwaive your need for a search warrant.\n\n751\n00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:54,880\nIs if the person that's there says okay,\nyeah, go ahead, search it.\n\n752\n00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,690\n>> If they consent.\n\n753\n00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,000\n>> Yeah.\n>> If they consent,\n\n754\n00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,728\nthen I don't need a search warrant.\n\n755\n00:42:58,728 --> 00:43:03,250\nYou told me, acting on that behalf,\n\n756\n00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,820\nyou told me that,\nthat I can search it, we're done.\n\n757\n00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:13,090\nThe thing with that would be\n,is it has to be very clear\n\n758\n00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,260\nthat the person knew that that's\nwhat they were consenting to.\n\n759\n00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:23,800\nThey can't just say, oh well, yeah,\nI'm giving, yeah I'll let you do it.\n\n760\n00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:30,160\nTo use an example would be,\nif an officer, for an example,\n\n761\n00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,380\npulled over someone that\nwas that was drunk.\n\n762\n00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,750\nThey pulled over someone for\ndrunk driving.\n\n763\n00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,910\nThat person's clearly drunk.\n\n764\n00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,607\nAnd that person says, yeah,\nyou can search my car.\n\n765\n00:43:40,607 --> 00:43:44,818\nIt may very well come in later saying,\nthat that person was so\n\n766\n00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:49,460\nsloshed that they didn't even know\nwhat they were consenting to.\n\n767\n00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:56,521\nSo yeah, we're not gonna accept that,\nso, their judgment was impaired.\n\n768\n00:43:56,521 --> 00:43:59,103\nSo you need to be pretty clear about it,\n\n769\n00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:03,175\nand if you're the forensic tech\nbeing called in for this, and\n\n770\n00:44:03,175 --> 00:44:09,090\nyou're doing a criminal type situation,\nyou may very well have an officer there.\n\n771\n00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:13,790\nThat can talk,\nthat can also talk the situation with.\n\n772\n00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,830\nSo you are consenting to us doing this.\n\n773\n00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,290\nSo make sure they're clear on it, in fact,\n\n774\n00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:25,635\nit may be where you have\npaperwork with you in your kit.\n\n775\n00:44:25,635 --> 00:44:29,205\nThat's not unheard of, to have those\nthings in your kit that say, okay,\n\n776\n00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:34,115\nwell here sign this in triplicate and\nyou peel off one and\n\n777\n00:44:34,115 --> 00:44:36,656\nhand it to them, and there you go.\n\n778\n00:44:36,656 --> 00:44:43,250\n>> So you got that consent form with you,\nso that if they're gonna give you consent,\n\n779\n00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,360\nyou can prove that they can't go back and\nsay, oh, I never gave you permission\n\n780\n00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,040\nto search my car, search my computer,\nor come into my home or whatever.\n\n781\n00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,270\nAnd it all starts tying together, right?\n\n782\n00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,550\nIf I, say,\ninvite that officer into my house.\n\n783\n00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:01,190\nIf he knocks on my door and I allow him\nto come in, that doesn't mean I'm giving\n\n784\n00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:05,480\nhim permission to search my computer, but\nit does bring in that plain view thing.\n\n785\n00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:10,250\nCuz now he's inside my house, and\nif my laptop is laying there and\n\n786\n00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:15,080\nthe screens up and you can see something\non that screen, that's plain view, right?\n\n787\n00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,800\nSo it starts kinda tying\nall back together here.\n\n788\n00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,377\n>> Yeah, it's,\nthis is one of the reasons why on\n\n789\n00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:31,672\nyour cellphone [SOUND] you\ngot those contacts ready.\n\n790\n00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:34,990\n>> My lawyer, is ready to go.\n\n791\n00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:38,720\n>> Don't kind of guess at this,\nor anything else,\n\n792\n00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,860\nbecause there's so many little loopholes\nin here and things that can happen.\n\n793\n00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,791\nYou can see with David's case,\n\n794\n00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:51,640\nhe's got, he's,\nyou're still going, look at him.\n\n795\n00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,390\n>> 25 miles of the border, the border\npatrol can check private property, but\n\n796\n00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,770\nnot inside known residences.\n\n797\n00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,970\nSo if I build a house that's close to the\nborder, that doesn't give them the right\n\n798\n00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:07,505\nto come into my house at any time day or\nnight and do this type of search so.\n\n799\n00:46:07,505 --> 00:46:11,737\n[CROSSTALK] I almost feel like we need\na lawyer on staff here just to make sure\n\n800\n00:46:11,737 --> 00:46:13,184\nthat we're, you know.\n\n801\n00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:16,086\n>> It's-\n>> To explain some of this stuff to\n\n802\n00:46:16,086 --> 00:46:16,670\nyou guys.\n\n803\n00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:24,640\n>> Yeah it can be,\nthis stuff with laws can be a mess.\n\n804\n00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,230\n>> But this is why we need the training,\nright.\n\n805\n00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,080\nThis is why we go through this training.\n\n806\n00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,880\nThis is why we get certified.\n\n807\n00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,030\nBecause it is very complex.\n\n808\n00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:35,010\nAs you guys are seeing, there's lots\nof twists and turns to the law.\n\n809\n00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:38,060\nAnd if I do things incorrectly,\nif I don't follow the proper procedures,\n\n810\n00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,130\nif I don't get the warrants when\nnecessary, and things like that,\n\n811\n00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:45,480\nthe evidence becomes unusable, and I could\nthen potentially blow the entire case.\n\n812\n00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,780\nSo it's good that we see\nhow complex it is and\n\n813\n00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:54,885\nhow easy it is to argue both\nsides of the situation, right.\n\n814\n00:46:54,885 --> 00:46:57,719\nThat's why we have laws,\nthat's why we have lawyers,\n\n815\n00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:00,610\nthat's why we have judges\nto straighten all this out.\n\n816\n00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:05,580\n>> And I gotta say, I like the way that\nthings are going in this chat room\n\n817\n00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:12,430\nright now, because with these things,\nwith them bringing up issues,\n\n818\n00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:16,430\nand we're getting friendly discussions and\narguments about this.\n\n819\n00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,530\nThis is actually really awesome.\n\n820\n00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,050\nI like to see this sort\nof thing because it\n\n821\n00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:25,450\nillustrates the type of stuff that\nyou're gonna have to go through.\n\n822\n00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,190\nYou may very well have people\nout there going can we do this?\n\n823\n00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,865\nCan we do that?\nAnd it It also shows you the questions\n\n824\n00:47:31,865 --> 00:47:37,235\nthat may go through your head when\nyou're there, so this is great.\n\n825\n00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:41,662\nYou guys should all be paying\nattention to this type of discussion.\n\n826\n00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:45,836\nI mean, even if you disagree with\nanother point or something in there,\n\n827\n00:47:45,836 --> 00:47:48,175\nother things gonna pop into your head.\n\n828\n00:47:48,175 --> 00:47:52,772\nJust because it's written in black and\nwhite on a piece of paper doesn't mean\n\n829\n00:47:52,772 --> 00:47:55,611\nsomeone can't With a lot of savvy or\nwhatever.\n\n830\n00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:59,980\nGet around it or\ncause something else to happen.\n\n831\n00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,953\nYou see it, do it all the time.\n\n832\n00:48:01,953 --> 00:48:07,450\nHeck, I was talking to one of my\nlawyer friends that said that,\n\n833\n00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:14,095\nthe fifth amendment situations,\nthe fourth being unreasonable search and\n\n834\n00:48:14,095 --> 00:48:21,370\nseizure, the fifth being, keeps you\nfrom having to incriminate yourself.\n\n835\n00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:26,554\nRemember we were talking about the key,\nthe encryption keys that we need to,\n\n836\n00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:29,587\nwe're talking about decryption keys that,\n\n837\n00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:33,448\nif it's written down versus in your head,\nand all that.\n\n838\n00:48:33,448 --> 00:48:39,144\nThey tested that in a case that I\nsaw in Colorado, where they were,\n\n839\n00:48:39,144 --> 00:48:44,710\nthey held the woman in contempt and\ncompelled her to do that.\n\n840\n00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:47,777\nI was talking with to my friend, and\n\n841\n00:48:47,777 --> 00:48:53,824\nthat's really kind of crazy because\nshe's incriminating herself.\n\n842\n00:48:53,824 --> 00:48:59,250\nMy buddy says that fifth amendment\nstuff never really seems to hold water.\n\n843\n00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:03,145\nThey overturn it all the time in cases\nwhere they find some way to do it.\n\n844\n00:49:03,145 --> 00:49:07,969\nNow, I know he's being a little bit\npessimistic about it, but he says, yeah,\n\n845\n00:49:07,969 --> 00:49:12,640\nthey can quite frequently find ways\nto get around those type of things.\n\n846\n00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,075\nSo, yeah,\njust cuz it's written in black and\n\n847\n00:49:16,075 --> 00:49:19,424\nwhite, we're gonna do\nour due diligence and\n\n848\n00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:24,198\ncover our butts as much as possible,\nbut that's all you can do.\n\n849\n00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:26,630\nConsult with the proper stuff.\n\n850\n00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,450\nMake sure your butt's protected and done\nwhat you're supposed to and there you go.\n\n851\n00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,542\n>> There you go.\n\n852\n00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:34,333\nAll right, now,\nwhen we take a look at these cases,\n\n853\n00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:37,062\nwhen we're doing this\nforensics investigation,\n\n854\n00:49:37,062 --> 00:49:40,817\nwe talk about when we need a warrant,\nwhen we might not need a warrant.\n\n855\n00:49:40,817 --> 00:49:43,697\nAnd we keep saying,\nwhen I need a warrant but sometimes,\n\n856\n00:49:43,697 --> 00:49:45,922\nI might need more than one warrant, right?\n\n857\n00:49:45,922 --> 00:49:47,231\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.\n\n858\n00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:48,230\nOh, yeah.\n\n859\n00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:52,799\nLike when the situations alluded\nto earlier is that, you can have\n\n860\n00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:57,950\na warrant to initially go into a place and\nlook for a piece of evidence, but\n\n861\n00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:03,290\nthen you suspect that there is other\nthings there that might be of use to you.\n\n862\n00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,826\nWell, you can't just go and collect it.\n\n863\n00:50:05,826 --> 00:50:10,587\nWhat you'll have to do is get\nan additional warrant, or let's say,\n\n864\n00:50:10,587 --> 00:50:13,460\nyou go into a residence to do a search,\nand\n\n865\n00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,482\nduring your time in that residence,\nyou find receipts and\n\n866\n00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:22,410\nstuff like that that show that\nperson has a storage unit someplace.\n\n867\n00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,553\nAnd it's got the address and\neverything on there.\n\n868\n00:50:24,553 --> 00:50:27,011\nYou can't go over there or\njust because you found that receipt there,\n\n869\n00:50:27,011 --> 00:50:28,687\nyou can't go to the storage unit and\nsearch it.\n\n870\n00:50:28,687 --> 00:50:33,590\nNow, that's an additional search or\nan additional warrant.\n\n871\n00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:38,134\nSo, you may have additional\nwarrants that need to be issued and\n\n872\n00:50:38,134 --> 00:50:43,879\nthat also can be a very, very tricky\nsituation, because especially if you're\n\n873\n00:50:43,879 --> 00:50:48,962\ngonna be hunting or are gonna be\nsearching many different locations.\n\n874\n00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:56,150\nIt becomes this whole kind of\ninterweaving stuff and really tricky.\n\n875\n00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:00,142\nI guess, there's also something else\nto kind of mention, if you're searching\n\n876\n00:51:00,142 --> 00:51:03,561\na residence, too, that can also\nmake a need for multiple warrants.\n\n877\n00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,400\nSearch warrants aren't good, ad infinitum.\n\n878\n00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,107\nThey're not good forever.\n\n879\n00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,730\nThey're usually good for around 72 hours.\n\n880\n00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:17,512\nIf you aren't able to execute\nthat search within 72 hours,\n\n881\n00:51:17,512 --> 00:51:20,633\nthen you have to get it reissued.\n\n882\n00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:21,165\n>> Go get another warrant.\n\n883\n00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:21,979\n>> Yeah.\n\n884\n00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:25,864\n>> And we've got Deborah out there in\nthe chat room says, network locations and\n\n885\n00:51:25,864 --> 00:51:30,287\nyeah, absolutely, if we had gone into this\nresidence, or to this person's workplace\n\n886\n00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:34,351\nand found evidence on a computer, and then\nsuspect that that might tie to another\n\n887\n00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:38,529\nlocation, then yeah, we would need a\nseparate warrant for that other location.\n\n888\n00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:41,758\nCould be specific the warrant is as well.\n\n889\n00:51:41,758 --> 00:51:46,651\nWe might have got a warrant to look for\na laptop that's owned by this person.\n\n890\n00:51:46,651 --> 00:51:48,952\nWe go in and\nwe find two more desktops in there,\n\n891\n00:51:48,952 --> 00:51:52,440\nit might be that that warrant\ndoesn't cover those desktops, right?\n\n892\n00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,228\nAnd now, we see them,\nthey're in plain view.\n\n893\n00:51:54,228 --> 00:51:56,660\nI can go back, and\nget another warrant to come back and\n\n894\n00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,130\nsearch those other computers.\n\n895\n00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:01,764\nOr, maybe I have a roommate that\nwe suspect is also part of this.\n\n896\n00:52:01,764 --> 00:52:03,280\nI can't go search his laptop, right?\n\n897\n00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,092\nSo, I might need another warrant for that.\n\n898\n00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:05,733\n>> Yeah.\n\n899\n00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:08,720\nIt can be very tricky.\n\n900\n00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,725\nAnd then, you also see it being brought\nup in here that Deborah's bringing up,\n\n901\n00:52:13,725 --> 00:52:16,351\nwhat if the data is stored outside the US?\n\n902\n00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:17,244\n>> I'd cry.\n\n903\n00:52:17,244 --> 00:52:20,732\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, back and back,\n\n904\n00:52:20,732 --> 00:52:25,344\nit's really, really,\nreally messy, real quick.\n\n905\n00:52:25,344 --> 00:52:27,654\nThat's the reality of that situation.\n\n906\n00:52:27,654 --> 00:52:34,833\nI think it's really, really messy to\nsearch those types of situations.\n\n907\n00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:39,665\nYou're going to have to talk to\nsomebody in those other countries,\n\n908\n00:52:39,665 --> 00:52:41,540\nwhoever your contact is.\n\n909\n00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,620\nGo through the proper channels to get\nthat to see if they can search it for\n\n910\n00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,595\nyou, or get those type of things.\n\n911\n00:52:47,595 --> 00:52:48,358\n[CROSSTALK] So-\n>> Absolutely,\n\n912\n00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:49,845\ncuz we see that all the time.\n\n913\n00:52:49,845 --> 00:52:53,220\nWell, one, you need lawyers that\ndeal with international law.\n\n914\n00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:57,841\nYou might need them to contact their\nlawyer contacts in these other countries.\n\n915\n00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,036\nTheir laws are going to be different,\n\n916\n00:53:00,036 --> 00:53:02,580\nwhether they play along\nnicely with the US.\n\n917\n00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,902\nI mean, a lot of these criminals do\nthis stuff intentionally, right?\n\n918\n00:53:05,902 --> 00:53:10,890\nThey might have their stuff stored on\na server somewhere that they're accessing\n\n919\n00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:15,654\nremotely, but that server could be in\na country that does not play nicely with\n\n920\n00:53:15,654 --> 00:53:19,490\nthe US or whatever country\nthe targeted investigation is in.\n\n921\n00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:24,887\nAnd I'm gonna have a very difficult time\ngetting in the right to go search that.\n\n922\n00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:28,796\nAnd they do that on purpose because\nthey know that those international laws\n\n923\n00:53:28,796 --> 00:53:30,657\nare gonna make it very difficult for\n\n924\n00:53:30,657 --> 00:53:33,870\nus to continue that investigation\noutside our borders.\n\n925\n00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:38,554\n>> Yeah, to confound, confuse,\nthwart, slow down, whatever,\n\n926\n00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:42,216\nthat's, those are techniques\nthat will be used,\n\n927\n00:53:42,216 --> 00:53:45,892\neither consciously or\nunconsciously, you know.\n\n928\n00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:50,556\nAnd then the Cloud storage one,\nwe are gonna definitely have to\n\n929\n00:53:50,556 --> 00:53:54,470\ntalk about the Cloud technology and\nhow they fit in.\n\n930\n00:53:54,470 --> 00:54:00,520\nThat's a can of worms that we just don't\nwanna open right at this exact second,\n\n931\n00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,963\nbut yeah, you're ahead of\nthe game thinking about that.\n\n932\n00:54:04,963 --> 00:54:08,475\nAnd yes, we already have planned a\ndiscussion of that because that's going to\n\n933\n00:54:08,475 --> 00:54:10,454\nbe part of your life, if it's not already.\n\n934\n00:54:10,454 --> 00:54:12,428\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n935\n00:54:12,428 --> 00:54:15,046\nAll right, well, I tell you what ladies\nand gentleman, looking at the clock,\n\n936\n00:54:15,046 --> 00:54:16,350\nit's about time for us to take a break.\n\n937\n00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,155\nSo, we're gonna stop here.\n\n938\n00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:21,571\nWhen we come back, we're gonna continue\non talking about searching and\n\n939\n00:54:21,571 --> 00:54:22,580\nseizing computers.\n\n940\n00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,471\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n941\n00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:24,654\nWe'll be right back.\n\n942\n00:54:24,654 --> 00:54:27,452\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n943\n00:54:27,452 --> 00:54:33,240\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n944\n00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:38,163\nSo, continuing on with our\ncomputer's search and seizure.\n\n945\n00:54:38,163 --> 00:54:42,438\nAnd we left off talking about some of\nthe different types of situations where I\n\n946\n00:54:42,438 --> 00:54:44,754\nwould need a warrant, or I had a warrant.\n\n947\n00:54:44,754 --> 00:54:47,770\nNext up on the list was\nour no-knock warrants.\n\n948\n00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:48,429\nI like the way that sounds.\n\n949\n00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:48,940\nThat sounds cool.\n\n950\n00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,872\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n951\n00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:52,907\n[LAUGH] That's actually\na fairly interesting one.\n\n952\n00:54:52,907 --> 00:54:56,133\nThere's actually two that we\ncould throw in here, the same, or\n\n953\n00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:57,665\ntwo of them we can talk about.\n\n954\n00:54:57,665 --> 00:55:00,398\nNo-knock warrants and there's other one\nthat's called sneak and peek warrants.\n\n955\n00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:01,114\n>> Sneak and peek?\nEven better!\n\n956\n00:55:01,114 --> 00:55:09,538\n>> Yeah, so, they're both ones that\nare employed in certain situations.\n\n957\n00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:14,076\nThe no-knock warrants\nis just like it sounds.\n\n958\n00:55:14,076 --> 00:55:18,200\nYou are not [SOUND] search warrant,\nthat type of stuff.\n\n959\n00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:24,446\nWhat you are doing is that you've got a\nwarrant where you can just go right on in.\n\n960\n00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:29,026\nTypically, you're only going to see those\ntypes of works in situations where letting\n\n961\n00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:33,667\nthe person that's being searched, or the\npremises that's being searched, given any\n\n962\n00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:37,537\nsort of a warning that you're coming in-\n>> Worried they might\n\n963\n00:55:37,537 --> 00:55:41,698\nbe destroying evidence or [CROSSTALK]\n>> Could be destroying evidence or\n\n964\n00:55:41,698 --> 00:55:46,065\ncould be cause harm to somebody coming in,\nthat could be a part of it.\n\n965\n00:55:46,065 --> 00:55:51,460\nIf you're gonna be ask to do a part\nof an investigation where you're\n\n966\n00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:56,686\ninvestigating evidence on,\nlike Let's say, like a drug deal.\n\n967\n00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,884\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, those persons could be armed,\n\n968\n00:55:59,884 --> 00:56:04,408\nso [LAUGH] you may not wanna be just\ngoing, hey, can we come in, and\n\n969\n00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:07,830\nthat's when everything starts flying.\n\n970\n00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,690\n>> At least when we see\nit in the TV shows,\n\n971\n00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,780\nwhen they come in with that battering\nram and just take the door down and\n\n972\n00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,980\nyou come right in, there is no,\npolice, we have a warrant.\n\n973\n00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,340\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n974\n00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:22,580\nSo you get that one, and the other one you\nget a sneak and peek, is what they call\n\n975\n00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:28,456\nit, which is where you will get a warrant,\nallows to go into the premises typically,\n\n976\n00:56:28,456 --> 00:56:32,680\nwhen someone isn't there.\n\n977\n00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:38,190\nThey do that,\nsome of the agencies make use of those for\n\n978\n00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:40,800\nvarious purposes,\nthey're doing an ongoing investigation.\n\n979\n00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,330\nYou know,\nI've heard of investigations, in fact,\n\n980\n00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:49,150\nI heard this from someone firsthand\nthat had participated in one,\n\n981\n00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:53,840\nwhere they were investigating somebody for\nsuspected national security violations.\n\n982\n00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:59,900\nAnd they wanted to check to see if there\nwas a pattern of evidence or behavior.\n\n983\n00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,230\nAnd so what they did is they were\ngoing in when this person was at work,\n\n984\n00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:09,390\nthey were actually going into their\nhouse and imaging their system.\n\n985\n00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,070\nAnd they were doing that for\nabout, I think maybe,\n\n986\n00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:15,240\nsix months to a year they were doing that.\n\n987\n00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,750\n>> Oh, so over a period of time,\nthey're going in and\n\n988\n00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,960\ngetting little bits of evidence and\nlittle bits of evidence and\n\n989\n00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,900\ntrying not to leave any trace that they\nwere there to let this person know.\n\n990\n00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,410\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n991\n00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:28,830\nAnd they had to do a lot of planning and\nstuff like that to not leave a trace,\n\n992\n00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:31,520\nbut they were able to pull it off.\n\n993\n00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,730\nIt got to the point where apparently\nsomeone said the guy that was going\n\n994\n00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:36,560\nin even knew the dog really well.\n\n995\n00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,090\nThe dog came up to him and\nhe was gonna pet the dog and\n\n996\n00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:41,145\nthe dog was friends with him and\neverything.\n\n997\n00:57:41,145 --> 00:57:44,310\n>> [LAUGH]\nThanks dog,\n\n998\n00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:45,760\nyou're really helping me\nprotect my house there.\n\n999\n00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,955\n>> Yeah, that's a guard dog for you.\n\n1000\n00:57:46,955 --> 00:57:48,110\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's my dog,\n\n1001\n00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:50,540\nthey just come up and lick you and\nsay hey, what do you want?\n\n1002\n00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:54,056\nOh the TV's over in this room and the good\nstuff's in this drawer over here, so yeah.\n\n1003\n00:57:54,056 --> 00:57:55,976\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1004\n00:57:55,976 --> 00:58:00,202\nBut anyway that's what\nthose two things are for.\n\n1005\n00:58:00,202 --> 00:58:02,950\n>> All right, so we've got our no-knock\nwarrants, we've got our sneak and\n\n1006\n00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,140\npeek warrants.\n\n1007\n00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:08,690\nWe talked a little bit,\nwhat about for property and custody?\n\n1008\n00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:11,190\nWhat are we referring to there?\n\n1009\n00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,250\n>> That one brings up\nanother interesting point.\n\n1010\n00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:17,340\nYou would think if you seize evidence or\n\n1011\n00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:21,300\nseize something that you suspect has\nevidence on it, that you've basically got\n\n1012\n00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,500\na blank check at that point to search it,\nhowever you see fit.\n\n1013\n00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,560\nThe answer is kind of in\nthe negative on that.\n\n1014\n00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:36,160\nYou do have a right to search it within\nthe parameters of what you've been given.\n\n1015\n00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,620\nBut, if it turns out that you're\ngoing to need to go further, or\n\n1016\n00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:43,360\nsearch deeper in to other\nareas of that equipment,\n\n1017\n00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:48,950\nthen you may need to obtain\nother warrants to do that.\n\n1018\n00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:51,670\nRemember, warrants are very\nclearly defined, or\n\n1019\n00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:56,010\nsupposed to be clearly defined,\non what it is you are looking for.\n\n1020\n00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,160\nSo you are only allowed to go so\n\n1021\n00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,750\nfar without getting additional\nclarification or what have you.\n\n1022\n00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,570\nEvidence may have to\nactually sit there for\n\n1023\n00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:09,720\na while while you're getting\nthe search warrants done.\n\n1024\n00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,490\nNow, the question is that when\nyou have property in custody,\n\n1025\n00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:16,190\nhow long can it sit there\nwhile you are doing searches?\n\n1026\n00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:20,040\nI mean, if the case is ongoing, and you\nneed to search for additional stuff and\n\n1027\n00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:24,110\nthen additional stuff and\nadditional stuff, that may not fly.\n\n1028\n00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:28,200\nIn fact, it's probably not cuz if I-\n>> Starts turning into like a fishing\n\n1029\n00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:33,210\nexpedition and\nthe judges aren't gonna let that happen.\n\n1030\n00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:37,860\n>> Yeah, it would look like you\nare on a fishing expedition.\n\n1031\n00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:44,020\nYou'd also have to explain to the judge\nthat's presiding that case or\n\n1032\n00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:49,342\ninvolved in it, you know, why you had to\nwait so long to collect that evidence.\n\n1033\n00:59:49,342 --> 00:59:53,930\nUsually there's a reasonable window\nthat lets you wait, after that,\n\n1034\n00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:57,780\nyou better come up with\ngood justification for it.\n\n1035\n00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,730\nIf you're searching for evidence\nafter you've had it in possession,\n\n1036\n01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:06,850\nyou're searching the evidence,\n30 days later, why did you wait so long?\n\n1037\n01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:09,640\nIs there some specific reason for it?\n\n1038\n01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,690\n>> And that kind of segues\nright into our next topic\n\n1039\n01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:14,660\nwhich is something we've\nmentioned already.\n\n1040\n01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,980\nOur time warrants on our warrants.\n\n1041\n01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,980\nOur time warrats, did I say time warrants?\n\n1042\n01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:22,430\nOur time limits on our warrants,\nright, they're not good forever.\n\n1043\n01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:27,530\nI can't get one today and executed\nyears from now or anything like that.\n\n1044\n01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:29,330\n>> No, you can't,\nsearch warrants don't work that way.\n\n1045\n01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:34,370\nSearch warrants,\nthey do have a limited lifetime.\n\n1046\n01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:39,050\nYou do, in most cases,\nhave to serve a search warrant within\n\n1047\n01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:44,330\nabout 72 hours of the signature or\nauthorization being placed on it.\n\n1048\n01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:47,442\nIf you haven't done it,\nyou have to go through the process again.\n\n1049\n01:00:47,442 --> 01:00:52,044\nOkay, yeah and that just makes sure\nthat we're keeping that current, and\n\n1050\n01:00:52,044 --> 01:00:54,615\nsituations change and things like that.\n\n1051\n01:00:54,615 --> 01:00:56,565\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1052\n01:00:56,565 --> 01:01:01,717\n>> We've talked about different\ntypes of warrants we might obtain or\n\n1053\n01:01:01,717 --> 01:01:04,760\nwhen we might need to obtain them.\n\n1054\n01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,910\nWe also talked about some search and\n\n1055\n01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,790\nseizures where I didn't need a warrant,\nright.\n\n1056\n01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:11,383\nThere are some cases where I don't\nneed a warrant I can go ahead and\n\n1057\n01:01:11,383 --> 01:01:15,691\ngrab that property, and it all comes back\nto the laws in your particular area so\n\n1058\n01:01:15,691 --> 01:01:19,412\nyou've got to be really careful with that,\ndo your due diligence,\n\n1059\n01:01:19,412 --> 01:01:23,133\nhave your person on your staff that\nis familiar with the local laws or\n\n1060\n01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:26,113\nhave somebody on call that\nyou can talk to about that.\n\n1061\n01:01:26,113 --> 01:01:30,291\nYou gotta make sure you're doing that\nproperly, because as we said a few times,\n\n1062\n01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:33,930\nif I do this part improperly,\nit can cause everything else to go away.\n\n1063\n01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:37,690\nIt's gonna make that case so much more\ndifficult to prosecute, if we can at all,\n\n1064\n01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:42,072\nbecause all of our evidence\nmight get thrown out.\n\n1065\n01:01:42,072 --> 01:01:48,800\n>> Yeah, when we started this journey\nwith this forensic course, one\n\n1066\n01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:53,620\nof the things that's mentioned, a lot of\nit's just procedure, procedure, procedure.\n\n1067\n01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:58,620\nI know we've done a lot of talking about\ndifferent procedures and haven't been able\n\n1068\n01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:03,120\nto do as many demos so far, because a lot\nof this has procedure setting us up for\n\n1069\n01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,060\ndoing that and\nbeing very meticulous with what we do.\n\n1070\n01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,000\nBecause that's the make or break deal.\n\n1071\n01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,190\nAnd I'd add to something here, by the way,\nthe field knows it's important.\n\n1072\n01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,000\nThe certification bodies\nknows it's important.\n\n1073\n01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,330\nSo pretty much no matter what\ncertification you're gonna take in\n\n1074\n01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:25,320\nforensics, they are gonna ask you know,\nthings about warrants, so\n\n1075\n01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,230\nyou understand that because that\nis gonna be a part of what you do.\n\n1076\n01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:32,410\nUnder what conditions do you need one,\ndo you not need one?\n\n1077\n01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:38,970\nWhat are the exceptions to the rule, what\ntype of exigent circumstances can exist?\n\n1078\n01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:40,250\nAll those things are gonna pop up.\n\n1079\n01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,220\nThey're not as black and\n\n1080\n01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,990\nwhite as you have a search warrant you go\nin, no search warrant you don't go in.\n\n1081\n01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:48,170\nYou know we've already\nbeen through that here and\n\n1082\n01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:51,730\nyou need to be aware of that\nout in the field, you know.\n\n1083\n01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,590\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1084\n01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,980\nAll right, so another topic we probably\nneed to touch while we're talking about\n\n1085\n01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,090\nall this legal stuff.\n\n1086\n01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:01,790\nWe're talking about what's okay to do and\nwhat's not okay to do\n\n1087\n01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:06,060\nwhen we're searching and seizing\nevidence in a computer related crime.\n\n1088\n01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,260\nThe Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\n\n1089\n01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:15,130\n>> Yes, that's one that had to\ncome out in the internet age.\n\n1090\n01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:20,100\nIt had to be modified, or existing\nlaws had to be adapted, modified, and\n\n1091\n01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:24,490\nthis one had to be created to\ncover stuff in the internet age.\n\n1092\n01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,863\nWhat this is going after is,\nwhat if you are doing an investigation and\n\n1093\n01:03:31,863 --> 01:03:36,622\nyou need to search something\nlike an ISP situation, or\n\n1094\n01:03:36,622 --> 01:03:42,830\nwe'll just keep it simple, we'll say\nyou have to search a business and\n\n1095\n01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:49,880\nyou are searching customer records or\nsomething as part of your investigation.\n\n1096\n01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:55,363\nYou are searching their databases\nlooking for a specific suspect or\n\n1097\n01:03:55,363 --> 01:04:00,365\nsuspects, Well if you capture\nany accounts in that process,\n\n1098\n01:04:00,365 --> 01:04:06,521\nwhich you will, any accounts that you\ncapture that says that you have to take\n\n1099\n01:04:06,521 --> 01:04:12,118\nthe proper procedures to ensure\nthe privacy of those accounts.\n\n1100\n01:04:12,118 --> 01:04:16,020\nYou go and do an investigation and\nyou get my account as part of it and\n\n1101\n01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,760\nI have nothing to do with it, but\n\n1102\n01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:23,090\nyou just happen to get mine as\npart of your extraction effort.\n\n1103\n01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:26,900\nMaybe you can't be that\nprecise when you're extracting\n\n1104\n01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,250\nthat data as an investigator.\n\n1105\n01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:32,280\nYou grab mine with it and\nother individuals that are with it.\n\n1106\n01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,300\nI'm not part of the investigation so\nyou have to,\n\n1107\n01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:39,430\nnow you have the responsibility to\nmaintain the privacy of that information.\n\n1108\n01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:43,670\nIf you don't, it opens you up\nto a whole bunch of other legal,\n\n1109\n01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:47,010\na whole big legal can\nof worms at that point.\n\n1110\n01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:51,400\nAll of us know, we see what\nhappens when privacy is violated,\n\n1111\n01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,070\nthe lawsuits that go flying and\nall these other things.\n\n1112\n01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:57,940\nThat's pretty much the same thing\nthat's gonna happen in this case\n\n1113\n01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:02,512\nis that someone's gonna,\nif someone grabs records and\n\n1114\n01:05:02,512 --> 01:05:07,380\nthey mishandle, and they shouldn't be\ndoing it anyway, but they don't ensure\n\n1115\n01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,690\nthe privacy of the ones that they're not\ninvestigating, there's gonna be a problem.\n\n1116\n01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:15,270\n>> So if I seize a computer, and\nI'm analyzing that hard drive, and\n\n1117\n01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:19,200\nI find a database, or a bunch of files,\nthat this person has stolen,\n\n1118\n01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,620\nthat's healthcare information, that\nhas some private information in there.\n\n1119\n01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:27,250\nI've gotta make sure that I do my due\ndiligence and protect that information.\n\n1120\n01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,980\nI wanna prosecute this person for\nstealing that information.\n\n1121\n01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:33,100\nBut I also have to make sure that I'm not\nthe one that lets that information out,\n\n1122\n01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,660\ncuz then I'm guilty of violating law.\n\n1123\n01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:39,310\n>> Yeah, you've just stumbled\ninto a big thing there.\n\n1124\n01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,404\nYou've stepped in it at that point.\n\n1125\n01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:43,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Put it that way, so be careful.\n\n1126\n01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:45,370\n>> All right.\n\n1127\n01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,100\nSo we got\nthe Electronic Communication Privacy Act,\n\n1128\n01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,920\nanother one that we're\ngonna have to deal with.\n\n1129\n01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,070\nI would read the electronic surveillance\nand communications networks.\n\n1130\n01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:56,080\nNot really an act or anything but\njust a concept more than anything.\n\n1131\n01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:00,510\n>> Yeah, this is another interesting one,\nit pertains to how you\n\n1132\n01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:05,570\nacquire evidence and how you talk to and\ncommunicate with ISPs.\n\n1133\n01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:10,880\nThat's where this one comes down to.\n\n1134\n01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:17,190\nSo how ISPs can provide information to and\nunder what conditions.\n\n1135\n01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:21,731\nThere's been a lot of\nthese over the years when\n\n1136\n01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:26,750\nISPs have evolved, become more capable.\n\n1137\n01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:31,060\nYou've seen situations\nwhere they've had to say,\n\n1138\n01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:35,610\nwell you need to keep this many\nrecords around for this long.\n\n1139\n01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:42,140\nAnd there's been all these discussions\nespecially since the Internet came live.\n\n1140\n01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:46,540\nSo this saying how you can\naccess that evidence, or\n\n1141\n01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,290\nhow you can access those things.\n\n1142\n01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:50,950\nCan they volunteer it if you\nhave your information there?\n\n1143\n01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:55,490\nCan they volunteer to give your stuff to\nlaw enforcement without your permission?\n\n1144\n01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:57,160\nIf you look at some of the EULAs for\n\n1145\n01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,650\nsome of these services\na lot of them can do that.\n\n1146\n01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:05,320\nA lot of them will say we'll never reveal\nyour stuff unless law enforcement asks for\n\n1147\n01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,010\nit, then we don't even have to ask you.\n\n1148\n01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:08,710\nWe'll just give it to them.\n\n1149\n01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:09,340\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1150\n01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,400\nAnd they're doing that for a few reasons.\n\n1151\n01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,650\nI mean, mainly because you\ncould be breaking the law and\n\n1152\n01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:16,150\nthey don't want to be held accountable or\n\n1153\n01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:21,760\nbe what's a good word again,\nnot sympathetic but be a part of that.\n\n1154\n01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,340\nAs well as they don't want to ruffle the\nfeathers of law enforcement because they\n\n1155\n01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,410\ncan make their life\npretty miserable as well.\n\n1156\n01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:27,970\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n1157\n01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:28,550\nThat can hurt.\n\n1158\n01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:30,990\n>> You can say, no we're not gonna\ngive you that information but\n\n1159\n01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:34,950\nnow, that's gonna open up\nthem to investigation.\n\n1160\n01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,850\nWhy are you not willing\nto give this information?\n\n1161\n01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,890\nWhy would you not want to help the police?\n\n1162\n01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:40,140\nAre you hiding something?\n\n1163\n01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,452\n>> That kind of thing?\n\n1164\n01:07:41,452 --> 01:07:45,620\n>> Yeah, there has been situations\nlike that in the wake of\n\n1165\n01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:54,460\nall of Snowden's issues,\nthere were a lot of people were going over\n\n1166\n01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:59,650\nto these services that encrypted email and\ndid all that special stuff for it.\n\n1167\n01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:02,010\nAnd the government put more\npressure on those things.\n\n1168\n01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:05,122\nThey started scrutinizing\nthose a bit more.\n\n1169\n01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:08,450\nTo wonder, yeah was a surge of people,\n\n1170\n01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:11,920\nwe're not gonna argue the politics\nover here, so everyone just calm down.\n\n1171\n01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,180\nWe're not gonna do that.\n\n1172\n01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,190\nBut that whole thing came up.\n\n1173\n01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:20,420\nAnd there were a couple cases where,\nwell I know of at least one situation\n\n1174\n01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:26,363\nwhere ISP that just they felt they were\ngetting bullied and pressured to do stuff.\n\n1175\n01:08:26,363 --> 01:08:29,761\nAnd they felt that they had\na responsibility to the customers not to\n\n1176\n01:08:29,761 --> 01:08:31,703\nreveal their personal information or\n\n1177\n01:08:31,703 --> 01:08:35,280\ndo anything that it would make\nit easier to get access to that.\n\n1178\n01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:38,230\nSo they just shut down completely.\n\n1179\n01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:42,320\nSo I do know of at least one\nsituation where that happened.\n\n1180\n01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:46,560\n>> Yeah, I remember reading about another\none where it was, I am trying to think of,\n\n1181\n01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,550\nI probably shouldn't say\nwho the ISP was anyways but\n\n1182\n01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:53,530\nthis person was being tried in a court\ncase and they wanted to bring in\n\n1183\n01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:58,000\nemail as some evidence in the court case\nand he said I deleted all my emails.\n\n1184\n01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,440\nSo they of course go to the ISP and\nthey want those emails and\n\n1185\n01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,390\nthe ISP is like, well he deleted them.\n\n1186\n01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,545\nBut they told him, he said, well we know\nyou keep backups of all your information.\n\n1187\n01:09:07,545 --> 01:09:10,140\nLet' s go back to a backup\nbefore he deleted them.\n\n1188\n01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:10,810\nAnd they did.\n\n1189\n01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:11,900\nThey gave them to me.\n\n1190\n01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,350\nThey were just like,\nall right, you're right.\n\n1191\n01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:14,010\nWe can go get them.\n\n1192\n01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,670\nWe recovered them, and\nwe gave them to you.\n\n1193\n01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:18,220\nAgain, same thing, they're going to\ncomply with law enforcement, and\n\n1194\n01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,140\nI'm sure it's in the ELA.\n\n1195\n01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:23,340\nThere's no expectancy of privacy\nin that kind of scenario.\n\n1196\n01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:27,790\nYou know your mail is bouncing off several\nmail servers out there on the Internet.\n\n1197\n01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:31,730\n>> Yeah, interestingly enough,\nwhen you mention a scenario like that.\n\n1198\n01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:37,972\nThey had one with Conrad Murray,\nMichael Jackson's doctor,\n\n1199\n01:09:37,972 --> 01:09:43,270\nthe one they said actually\ngave him this medication,\n\n1200\n01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:46,345\ndrugs, whatever killed him.\n\n1201\n01:09:46,345 --> 01:09:51,645\nWhenever they seized his records or\nseized his computers,\n\n1202\n01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:58,090\nall that had this information on this,\nthey found that they didn't find\n\n1203\n01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:01,730\nany emails pertaining to this and they\nhad a feeling that something was missing.\n\n1204\n01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,890\nWhen they looked back at things,\n\n1205\n01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:06,880\nthey found out that he\nhad deleted these things.\n\n1206\n01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,410\nAnd those were most likely,\nthey showed that there was and\n\n1207\n01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:13,290\na definite attempt to\ncover up his actions.\n\n1208\n01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:17,970\nAnd that was one thing that was\nused to actually show that yeah,\n\n1209\n01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,390\nhe knew he was guilty.\n\n1210\n01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:23,150\nAnd he knew he had done something\nwrong because he had gone through\n\n1211\n01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:27,790\nthe extra effort to delete all these\nemails and they were able to go and\n\n1212\n01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,830\nrecover them from someplace else.\n\n1213\n01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:30,440\nThat was enough for\n\n1214\n01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:35,285\nthem to say that it was basically an\nanti-forensics move, to get back to that.\n\n1215\n01:10:35,285 --> 01:10:37,110\nAnti-forensics itself.\n\n1216\n01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:42,940\nAny type of, any type of situation or\nactions where you're trying to get rid of\n\n1217\n01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:47,330\nthings or remove them can show that there\nwas intent there to cover your tracks.\n\n1218\n01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:50,200\nOr try to keep yourself from being caught.\n\n1219\n01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,390\nIn his case, yes.\n\n1220\n01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:53,380\nIt was enough to show that.\n\n1221\n01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:57,270\nAlmost like a lack of evidence in this\ncase actually became the evidence that we\n\n1222\n01:10:57,270 --> 01:11:00,040\nneeded to take the case to the next step.\n\n1223\n01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:04,720\n>> Yeah, exactly, they were able to push\nthat case further by going and asking for\n\n1224\n01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,550\nother stuff, yeah.\n\n1225\n01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:06,520\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1226\n01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:09,250\nAll right, there's a couple of things\nthat we gotta be familiar with,\n\n1227\n01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:11,131\nthe Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\n\n1228\n01:11:11,131 --> 01:11:18,280\nWhich controls, got a brain cramp there,\nwhen we're talking about.\n\n1229\n01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,020\nHelp me out there with that one Sean.\n\n1230\n01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:20,992\nI forgot already.\n\n1231\n01:11:20,992 --> 01:11:21,720\n>> Which one?\n\n1232\n01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,091\n>> The Electronic\nCommunications Privacy Act.\n\n1233\n01:11:24,091 --> 01:11:28,149\n>> That's the one for ISPs for going after\nISP, asking information from ISPs or\n\n1234\n01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:29,250\nrequesting it.\n\n1235\n01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:31,060\n>> All right, and\nthen our electronic surveillance and\n\n1236\n01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:32,720\nour communications networks.\n\n1237\n01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,670\nLast thing we got on our list there is,\nevidence.\n\n1238\n01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,390\nWhat do we got there?\n\n1239\n01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:40,785\n>> Yeah, that's just to remind you\n\n1240\n01:11:40,785 --> 01:11:44,580\nthat we're not gonna through all\nthe electronic evidence again.\n\n1241\n01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:49,989\nBut remember all the evidence\nrules we talked about yesterday.\n\n1242\n01:11:49,989 --> 01:11:53,139\nWe're definitely not going to drag you\nthrough all of those things again,\n\n1243\n01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:54,650\nwe've been down that road.\n\n1244\n01:11:54,650 --> 01:12:00,785\nWe're assuming that you've got your list\nand your notes and everything on that.\n\n1245\n01:12:00,785 --> 01:12:01,523\nBut that's the type of stuff\nthat's also coming in here.\n\n1246\n01:12:01,523 --> 01:12:06,463\nRemember when you're going in and\nexecuting search warrants, and going and\n\n1247\n01:12:06,463 --> 01:12:11,176\ngrabbing information, you also have\nto remember is this best evidence,\n\n1248\n01:12:11,176 --> 01:12:12,710\nis it direct evidence.\n\n1249\n01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:14,135\nWhat type of evidence do you have?\n\n1250\n01:12:14,135 --> 01:12:16,355\nRemember heresay, stuff like that.\n\n1251\n01:12:16,355 --> 01:12:19,965\nYou don't want to waste your time\nwith a search warrant collecting\n\n1252\n01:12:19,965 --> 01:12:21,685\nevidence that isn't gonna help you.\n\n1253\n01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:22,185\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah and\n\n1254\n01:12:22,185 --> 01:12:24,595\nmake sure you get the right types.\n\n1255\n01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:25,605\n>> So we're doing our search and\n\n1256\n01:12:25,605 --> 01:12:28,305\nseizures where you have to be familiar\nwith what it is we're looking for.\n\n1257\n01:12:28,305 --> 01:12:31,710\nMaking sure it's worth going through the\ntrouble of getting the warrant, executing\n\n1258\n01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:37,040\nthat warrant, doing the search, whatever\nit is we're retrieving needs to be useful.\n\n1259\n01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,020\nAnd that probably goes\nback to our goals right?\n\n1260\n01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,380\nInitially, we talked\nabout setting our goals,\n\n1261\n01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,240\ndeciding what it is we're\ntrying to go after.\n\n1262\n01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:46,210\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1263\n01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:50,480\n>> All right well, we've got a lot on\nsearching and seizing computers, Sean.\n\n1264\n01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,470\nAnything else we wanna toss in here?\n\n1265\n01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,215\n>> No, just review.\n\n1266\n01:12:55,215 --> 01:12:57,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just review that stuff,\n\n1267\n01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,470\nit's some of the trickiest\nstuff you'll get.\n\n1268\n01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:02,240\nCompared to the technical\nstuff we're looking at,\n\n1269\n01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:05,350\nthe technical stuff is\neasier compared to this.\n\n1270\n01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:07,460\nAt least is was for\nme looking at all these different\n\n1271\n01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:11,930\nsearch warrants were one of the big\nones that were kinda you know.\n\n1272\n01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:15,340\n>> There's a lot of intricacies\nthere in those laws,\n\n1273\n01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,430\nin obtaining those warrants and\nexecuting those warrants.\n\n1274\n01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:19,075\nWhen I don't need a warrant,\nthings like that.\n\n1275\n01:13:19,075 --> 01:13:21,653\nAnd as Sean has alluded to several times,\n\n1276\n01:13:21,653 --> 01:13:25,557\nwe've got to make sure that we\nhave the proper people on staff or\n\n1277\n01:13:25,557 --> 01:13:29,626\ncontacts that we can bounce ideas\noff of or get information from.\n\n1278\n01:13:29,626 --> 01:13:33,888\nSo that we make sure that we're following\nthe law, wherever that might be, so\n\n1279\n01:13:33,888 --> 01:13:36,680\nthat in the end,\nour investigation is fruitful.\n\n1280\n01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:42,195\nAnd we get evidence that we can actually\nuse to deal with this employee or,\n\n1281\n01:13:42,195 --> 01:13:46,515\nin a criminal case, take it to court and\nactually prosecute somebody.\n\n1282\n01:13:46,515 --> 01:13:47,755\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1283\n01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:49,105\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1284\n01:13:49,105 --> 01:13:50,957\nAll right, well, ladies and\ngentlemen, thanks for tuning

Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:42,977\n>> Doing pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:44,827\n>> All right, glad you're here with us.\n\n8\n00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:46,931\nWe got some more exciting\nepisodes coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:51,801\nWe are in the middle of doing our\nDigital Forensic Investigator series, and\n\n10\n00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:57,371\nin this episode we're going to talk about\nunderstanding hard disks and file systems.\n\n11\n00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:59,199\nIt's gonna be a good one.\n\n12\n00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,884\nIt's gonna be a little bit short, because\nthis is some information that really\n\n13\n00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:05,420\nshould be, at this point,\nassumed knowledge.\n\n14\n00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,886\nAnd, we've got some other episodes we're\ngoing to dive into, recovering files and\n\n15\n00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:14,043\nfolders and things like that and actually\ndoing the forensics, but we do want to\n\n16\n00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:18,075\nspend a little time just making sure\nthat you're familiar with the basics and\n\n17\n00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:20,957\nif you've got any, well,\nI'll let you know as we go.\n\n18\n00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:25,940\nSo, Sean, we talk about understanding\nfile, a hard disk and file systems.\n\n19\n00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,077\nReally, the problem is, we've got lots of\ndifferent file systems out there, right?\n\n20\n00:01:30,077 --> 00:01:33,190\n>> Yes, and we actually have a few\ndifferent types of hard drive\n\n21\n00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,050\ntechnologies too,\nwhich make the issue more interesting.\n\n22\n00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,183\nSo, it's something that does\nrequire a good amount of attention,\n\n23\n00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:44,662\nbecause you very well could\nencounter some of these, and\n\n24\n00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:47,502\nsome of these you\ndefinitely will encounter.\n\n25\n00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:51,168\nBut you could encounter any of\nthese out there in the field, so\n\n26\n00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:52,940\nyou gotta be prepared for it.\n\n27\n00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,315\nYou also have to be prepared for\nthe hardware end of it as well cuz\n\n28\n00:01:56,315 --> 00:02:00,600\nthe hardware end can greatly impact how\nyou're going to collect information.\n\n29\n00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,540\nSo, yeah, there's some stuff here now.\n\n30\n00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:09,084\nWe're gonna give you an overview of stuff\nhere, and as Mike was saying it's assumed\n\n31\n00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:12,988\nknowledge, but that doesn't let you\noff the hook if you're like, oh,\n\n32\n00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:17,538\ngreat short and assumed knowledge, I don't\nhave to study, or anything like that.\n\n33\n00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,114\nNow, make sure you do know or\n\n34\n00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:23,550\nunderstand what it is we're talking about\ncuz this is gonna come up later on.\n\n35\n00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,885\nWe're talking about digging\ninto the system a bit more.\n\n36\n00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,162\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n37\n00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:32,393\nThe first thing we wanna do is a brief\nhard disk drive overview, and again,\n\n38\n00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:37,180\nat this point, we should be familiar with\na hard drive and its basic functionality.\n\n39\n00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,500\nLet's start with just mechanical drives,\nwhich is what we've been used to for\n\n40\n00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,993\nyears and years and years.\n\n41\n00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:45,054\nThat's what we've always had, and\n\n42\n00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:48,120\nwe understand the way\na mechanical drive works.\n\n43\n00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,528\nInside that drive,\nif you were to crack that thing open,\n\n44\n00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:54,652\nyou're gonna have a spindle,\nand on that spindle,\n\n45\n00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:59,489\nthat spinning point there, you're gonna\nhave a stack of what we call platters.\n\n46\n00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:05,414\nAnd each one of those platters is then\ndivided up into what we call tracks,\n\n47\n00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:09,907\nwhich is basically one lap or\nso around that hard drive,\n\n48\n00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:13,130\nI'm sorry, around that platter.\n\n49\n00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,770\nAnd then, that is divided up even\nfurther into sectors which are chunks\n\n50\n00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,767\nof that track, and\nthat's the physical layout of that drive.\n\n51\n00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:27,897\nAnother term we should be familiar with\nis if we have multiple platters stacked\n\n52\n00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:31,570\non top of each other, you can think\nof that track on one platter.\n\n53\n00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,422\nWhat if I was to take a slice\ndown through all of those stacks?\n\n54\n00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,530\nThat same track all the way down\nthrough that stack of platters.\n\n55\n00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,468\nThat will be what we call a cylinder,\nall right?\n\n56\n00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:45,684\nSo, some different terminology we\nshould be familiar with how these hard\n\n57\n00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,900\ndrives work.\n\n58\n00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,362\nWe've got a read/write head, that floats\nacross the surface of those platters.\n\n59\n00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:56,990\nIf you got a stack of platters, you'll\nactually have multiple read/write heads.\n\n60\n00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,035\nAnd then, you've got your extenuator,\n\n61\n00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:05,955\nthe motor that drives that read/write\nhead back and forth across that platter.\n\n62\n00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,463\nAnd it's just reading that magnetic data,\nright?\n\n63\n00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:12,841\nWhen we talked about mechanical hard\ndrives, they're storing mechanical,\n\n64\n00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:16,289\nor, I'm sorry,\nmagnetic information on those platters and\n\n65\n00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,622\nthat read/write head is picking that up,\nthose ones and zeroes from there.\n\n66\n00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:24,140\nSo, there are times, Sean, when I might\nhave a hard drive that's inoperable.\n\n67\n00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,051\nRight?\n\n68\n00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:29,077\nAnd we could go in and possibly,\nnot necessarily repair that drive, but\n\n69\n00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:30,595\nget it functioning again.\n\n70\n00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:31,593\nRight?\n\n71\n00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:35,470\nMaybe the motor has worn out.\n\n72\n00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,836\nMaybe they've tried to do something to\nthat drive to prevent us from getting data\n\n73\n00:04:39,836 --> 00:04:40,615\noff of there.\n\n74\n00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:43,495\nThey've taken a drill and drilled\na hole down through those platters-\n\n75\n00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:44,231\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> It'll happen.\n\n76\n00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:45,650\n>> Or something like that.\n\n77\n00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,624\nThey'll try whatever they can if they're\ntrying to hide that information.\n\n78\n00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:53,130\nAnd I might need to disassemble that drive\nand that's pretty specialized work though.\n\n79\n00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,675\nI don't know if that's something\nwe'd do as a forensic investigator,\n\n80\n00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:58,602\nmight be something that we outsource?\n\n81\n00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:03,118\n>> Yeah, you could technically to\na certain level do some of that stuff\n\n82\n00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:04,840\nyourself.\n\n83\n00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,766\nThere's been the old school\nstuff that they've said for\n\n84\n00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:13,670\nyears where you have two drives,\nthe same type and one fails, you could\n\n85\n00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:19,186\nactually get another one of the same type\nand do surgery and move the stuff over.\n\n86\n00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,900\nYou could probably still do something\nlike that if you really wanted to, but\n\n87\n00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,787\nif you get something to the point where\nsomeone has drilled holes through it, or\n\n88\n00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:30,734\ndone something like that, then they may\nhave to go to a specialized data recovery\n\n89\n00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,965\nservice cuz you may not\nhave that equipment.\n\n90\n00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,876\nTherefore, more than likely,\nyou just don't have that equipment there.\n\n91\n00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:39,423\nYou need to go to somebody\nthat specializes in that.\n\n92\n00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:44,503\n>> Yeah and typically, we're talking about\nhaving an extremely clean environment to\n\n93\n00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:49,439\nwork in because we're talking about very\nfine tolerances between the platter and\n\n94\n00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,260\nthat read/write head.\n\n95\n00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,401\nI heard an analogy once, and I probably\nshouldn't say this because I don't\n\n96\n00:05:56,401 --> 00:06:01,859\nknow that it's true, but just to give\nan idea, it's probably in the ballpark,\n\n97\n00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:06,151\nand what these people were saying\nwas a smoke is a particulate.\n\n98\n00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:07,812\nIt's not gas.\n\n99\n00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:11,731\nIt's a particulate and if a particulate\nof smoke lands on a platter,\n\n100\n00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:13,624\nand that platter's spinning and\n\n101\n00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:18,355\nthe read/write head is coming up to where\nthat particulate is, they say that'd be\n\n102\n00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:22,850\nlike you driving down the road in your\ncar and coming up to a ten-foot boulder.\n\n103\n00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,329\nAnd that's the kind of\ntolerances we're talking about.\n\n104\n00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:31,711\nI imagine, if I cracked open a hard drive\nin here, there's gonna be some dust,\n\n105\n00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,905\nsome environmental factors that could\nprevent me from getting that data.\n\n106\n00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:37,766\nI've actually made it worse by\ncracking that thing open and\n\n107\n00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,035\ntrying to do this myself.\n\n108\n00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:43,492\nSo, it very well could be if you don't\nhave the specialized equipment required to\n\n109\n00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:46,845\nget into that hard drive and\ntry to rebuild that drive.\n\n110\n00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:49,815\nYou might want to send it off to\nsomebody else that's licensed or\n\n111\n00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:52,627\nhas the equipment,\nthe facilities to do that kind of thing.\n\n112\n00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:53,138\nAll right?\n\n113\n00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:54,135\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n114\n00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:57,386\nI mean, you might get lucky.\n\n115\n00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,742\nI mean, and\nprobably nine times out of ten,\n\n116\n00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:02,430\nyou'll get lucky if you\nopen up a drive like that.\n\n117\n00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,734\nBut that tenth time is the one that\nyou're gonna need that for a case and\n\n118\n00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:07,306\nthe whole thing centers on that.\n\n119\n00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:08,479\nThat's when that happens.\n\n120\n00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,114\nSo-\n>> It's like wearing your static\n\n121\n00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:12,510\nwristband, right?\n\n122\n00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,359\nWe all know we're supposed to, we never\ndo when we're cracking that case open.\n\n123\n00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:18,630\nAnd 90% of the time, nothing happens.\n\n124\n00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,116\n>> I don't even know what\none of those looks like.\n\n125\n00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:20,999\nI've heard about them.\n\n126\n00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,415\n>> Those anti-static wrist wraps.\n\n127\n00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:24,818\nYeah, those birth control for us geeks.\n\n128\n00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,923\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the problem is,\n\n129\n00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:30,124\nas you said the one time it does go\nwrong is probably going to be that\n\n130\n00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:33,812\nreally important time when the case is\nriding on this and things like that.\n\n131\n00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:37,535\nSo, make sure if you don't\nhave the facilities and\n\n132\n00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:43,434\nyou're going to need to do that, that you\ndo your research and maybe send it off.\n\n133\n00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:46,859\nAnd then, as the people in the chat room\nwere saying, image, image, image, but\n\n134\n00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:50,034\nthe problem is, if I can't spin that\ndrive up, I can't take an image of it,\n\n135\n00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:51,148\nuntil I repair the drive.\n\n136\n00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:54,410\nThat's my problem there, right?\n\n137\n00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,105\nSo, that's your mechanical drives.\n\n138\n00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:58,287\nA solid state drive's\na little bit different.\n\n139\n00:07:58,287 --> 00:07:59,029\nAll right.\n\n140\n00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,273\n>> Yes.\n\n141\n00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:03,895\n>> With solid-state drives we're talking\nabout storing it much like we would with\n\n142\n00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:04,970\nflash memory, right?\n\n143\n00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,490\nWe're storing it electronically\ninstead of magnetically.\n\n144\n00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,650\nAnd they have their own issues\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n145\n00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,430\n>> Yeah, because of the way\nsolid-state drives work,\n\n146\n00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,730\nthe way they spread out writes across\nthe drive and reallocate space.\n\n147\n00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,410\nAnd then you have things like TRIM\noperations and all that happen in it, they\n\n148\n00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,715\njust cause a whole other ton of headaches\nas far as how we do file recovery.\n\n149\n00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:32,870\nAnd all that good stuff.\n\n150\n00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,130\nAnd we're gonna see some of that.\n\n151\n00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,690\nBut yeah, you're gonna have to know\nwhat type of drive is in there.\n\n152\n00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,520\nTraditional ones with the platters and\neverything,\n\n153\n00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,360\nthat are spinning around,\nthose ones we know how to deal with.\n\n154\n00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,530\nWe've been dealing with them for years.\n\n155\n00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,700\nSSDs, well, you can't use the same\ntechniques there, as far as the logical\n\n156\n00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,990\nlayer, where you're actually storing\nstuff and laying it out to file system.\n\n157\n00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,920\nThat's the same.\n\n158\n00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000\nWe don't have to worry\nabout that too much.\n\n159\n00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,550\nIt's the actual mechanical that can\ndramatically impact how we're gonna\n\n160\n00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,934\ndo imaging and how we're gonna\nextract information out of there.\n\n161\n00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:09,190\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n162\n00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,000\nAnd as you say with our mechanical drives,\nand again,\n\n163\n00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,980\nsomething we should be familiar with,\nthe way it stores that data logically.\n\n164\n00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,420\nWe talked physically, tracks,\nsectors, cylinders, platters.\n\n165\n00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,560\nLogically, right, it's writing that data,\nand it's keeping information about those\n\n166\n00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,660\nfiles in its file allocation table, where\nthe file starts, where the file ends.\n\n167\n00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,676\nIf it becomes fragmented,\n\n168\n00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:32,930\nright, we gotta have multiple starting and\nending points for that file.\n\n169\n00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,230\nWhen you delete a file on a mechanical\ndrive like that, it doesn't go out and\n\n170\n00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,840\nerase the ones and\nzeros from that sector, right?\n\n171\n00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,510\nIt's just going to mark that space as\navailable for the next write operation.\n\n172\n00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,410\nAnd, the next write operation might or\nmight not overwrite that information.\n\n173\n00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,110\nSo, if there have been a lot of writes,\nif there's been a lot of deletes, and\n\n174\n00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,010\nnot a lot of writes,\nactually have the opportunity to go in,\n\n175\n00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,640\nrecover some of that data,\nwhich we're gonna do in another segment.\n\n176\n00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,901\nWith our solid-state drives though,\nit doesn't work that way.\n\n177\n00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,656\nWith solid-states we're\ntalking about addresses and\n\n178\n00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:07,183\nregisters where their\nstoring this information.\n\n179\n00:10:07,183 --> 00:10:13,608\nAnd when you delete a file it\nmarks that space as available.\n\n180\n00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:18,210\nAnd as Shaun said most of these now\nhave TRIM features built into them.\n\n181\n00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,795\nAnd so what it'll do is it'll go back and\nactually erase those registers,\n\n182\n00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:26,695\nclear those registers before\nthe next write operation occurs.\n\n183\n00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:31,145\nAnd, as you said, it actually will move\nthings now and again to try because one of\n\n184\n00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:36,035\nthe issues we have with solid state,\nsuppose we have finite number of writes\n\n185\n00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,470\nthat I can do this, and\nI've seen both sides of this argument.\n\n186\n00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,840\nHow many writes we can do to something\nbefore it stops being able to store that.\n\n187\n00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:50,270\nSo what it'll do is it'll try to\nmove files around occasionally\n\n188\n00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,070\nto even out the wear,\n\n189\n00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,960\nif you will, one way to put it, on\nthe different areas of that drive, right?\n\n190\n00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,880\nIf you're never filling that drive up,\nthe end of that, the end, right,\n\n191\n00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,310\nis not a platter here, we're just talking\nabout address range within this memory,\n\n192\n00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,140\ndoesn't use as much, all right?\n\n193\n00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,770\nSo the front part of that drive or\nthe early addresses,\n\n194\n00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,220\nI guess would be a better way to say it,\nmight have had a lot of reads and\n\n195\n00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,360\nwrites going to it and erases and\nwrites again, erases and writes again.\n\n196\n00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,342\nBut those ending addresses,\nmight not have any to it, right?\n\n197\n00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:22,120\nSo it'll actually move stuff around,\nbecause you can do that.\n\n198\n00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,040\nCuz it doesn't matter.\n\n199\n00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,560\nIt's just an addressing system.\n\n200\n00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,146\nSo, it's a little different.\n\n201\n00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:30,380\nRecovering the data becomes\na little bit different there.\n\n202\n00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,980\nAnd so really it's understanding\nhow these drives are functioning\n\n203\n00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,770\nbecause that's gonna determine or\n\n204\n00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:41,150\nchange the method we use maybe to\nrecover data off of those drives, right?\n\n205\n00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,620\nWe've got flash drives as well.\n\n206\n00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,410\nWe've got the little SD cards\nthat we gotta deal with.\n\n207\n00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,280\nWe got USB drives we've gotta deal with.\n\n208\n00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,350\nOptical media that we've gotta deal with.\n\n209\n00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,580\nSo, lots of different types of drives.\n\n210\n00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,298\nAnd then we've got file systems\nthat go on those drives.\n\n211\n00:11:57,298 --> 00:12:00,400\n>> Yeah, and\nyou layer those on top of that physically.\n\n212\n00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,710\n>> And those are all different too, right?\n\n213\n00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,300\nFor our different operating systems\nuse different file systems.\n\n214\n00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,580\nAnd that could definitely change how\nwe go about accessing that drive and\n\n215\n00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,615\ngetting that information as well.\n\n216\n00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:17,800\n>> Yeah, the amount of file systems\nout there may or may not surprise you.\n\n217\n00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,770\nWe know about the usual suspects,\nstuff like FAT and NTFS.\n\n218\n00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,186\nBut then there are other\nones out there for CDs and\n\n219\n00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:30,670\nDVDs, you have those.\n\n220\n00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:35,360\nYou have ones for the Mac OS.\n\n221\n00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,026\nYou have ones for Linux.\n\n222\n00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:41,265\n>> [CROSSTALK] You got your Linux your,\nyep, exactly.\n\n223\n00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:46,245\n>> There's a whole alphabet soup of\ndifferent file systems out there.\n\n224\n00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:47,406\n>> Windows has their new one, ReFS.\n\n225\n00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:53,280\nThat I don't even think is\ncovered in a lot of books yet.\n\n226\n00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,450\n>> Yeah.\nIt's still pretty new.\n\n227\n00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,565\nIt's probably not gonna make a tremendous\ndifference on the forensic side.\n\n228\n00:12:59,565 --> 00:13:01,315\nBut you're right.\n\n229\n00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:02,675\nIt's something new.\n\n230\n00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:04,877\nThe coverage is there,\nbut it's all spread out.\n\n231\n00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:08,335\nIt hasn't really been\nconsolidated all that well.\n\n232\n00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:13,832\nAs a forensics person you're gonna have\nto probably look that up at some point.\n\n233\n00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:16,992\nIf not right now,\nyou'll have to look it up at some point.\n\n234\n00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:21,892\nAs far as the different file systems and\nknowing the real mechanics of each\n\n235\n00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:27,020\none of them and knowing how the little\nindividual bits and all that tick,\n\n236\n00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,020\nI would say that you don't need\nto memorize it at that level.\n\n237\n00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,540\nBut you should know where to find that\ninformation just in case it comes out or\n\n238\n00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,450\nyou're using a tool to\nanalyze that information.\n\n239\n00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,892\nYou know what it is that you're seeing.\n\n240\n00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:43,642\n>> Yeah, cuz we like to think that oh,\nI'm gonna do this data recovery and\n\n241\n00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:45,902\nI'm going to recover data off this drive.\n\n242\n00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:48,730\nAnd I'm gonna open up a Windows Explorer.\n\n243\n00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,940\nAnd I was gonna click on that file and\nbe able to read it.\n\n244\n00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,830\nTruth of the matter is, we're probably\ngetting back a bunch what looks like\n\n245\n00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,310\ngobbledygook, x values, or what have you.\n\n246\n00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,210\nAnd we've gotta be able to read\nthat information, understanding\n\n247\n00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,430\nhow the file system stores that data can\nhelp me decipher and interpret that.\n\n248\n00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,470\nBut there's also tools we can use that\ncan help us with that as well, right?\n\n249\n00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:16,250\n>> Yeah, there's tools that can help\nyou view and access and even extract\n\n250\n00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,150\nthat information off of a system or out\nof an image that you may have collected.\n\n251\n00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:26,540\nOne of them is Autopsy that uses\nThe Sleuth Kit underneath the hood.\n\n252\n00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,140\nAnd you can get The Sleuth Kit\nby itself if you want.\n\n253\n00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,670\nAutopsy just acts as a front end and\nincludes other tools.\n\n254\n00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,290\nAnd will generate other things for you.\n\n255\n00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,690\nBut there's other tools on top of\nthat that are better specialized.\n\n256\n00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,610\nThey have stuff that do things like\nfile carving is a term that you may or\n\n257\n00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,620\nmay not have heard of.\n\n258\n00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,780\nProbably some of you have done it.\n\n259\n00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,490\nWhat file carving is is it's\nwhere you have a situation\n\n260\n00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,400\nwhere a part of a section on\nthe disc was actually used.\n\n261\n00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,060\nAnd then what happened\nis as it was deleted and\n\n262\n00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,120\nthen something else was put there\nwhen the space was made available,\n\n263\n00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,740\nwell if that section of the drive held\na certain amount of data, and you deleted\n\n264\n00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,220\nwhat was in there, and then you put\nsomething else that was only half the size\n\n265\n00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,770\nof the file that was in there prior,\nwell, that's still sitting out there.\n\n266\n00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,062\nSo the rest of that file even though\nit was deleted, if you didn't overwrite\n\n267\n00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:26,218\nit all you can do file carving to pull\nout that piece that was left behind and\n\n268\n00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,517\nmaybe reconstruct something out of it.\n\n269\n00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:30,491\n>> Nice, yeah,\nI never even thought about that.\n\n270\n00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:33,982\nWhen we talk about the file system,\nremember,\n\n271\n00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:37,050\nhere we talked about tracks and sectors.\n\n272\n00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,440\nThat's physically how it's laid out.\n\n273\n00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,490\nBut the operating system\ndoesn't deal with sectors.\n\n274\n00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,413\nIt deals with what we call clusters,\nright?\n\n275\n00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:46,967\nThe cluster is the smallest portion of the\nhard drive that the operating system can\n\n276\n00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:49,743\nrecognize, and\nthat might be multiple sectors.\n\n277\n00:15:49,743 --> 00:15:51,621\nAnd so if I wipe us a cluster and\n\n278\n00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:55,532\nthen I write a file that doesn't\ntake up that entire cluster,\n\n279\n00:15:55,532 --> 00:16:00,961\nthe cluster's considered used, but it only\nended up taking up half of that cluster.\n\n280\n00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,096\nSo the other half of that\ncluster is technically.\n\n281\n00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,742\nThe old file that we deleted,\nit hasn't been overwritten yet.\n\n282\n00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:08,860\nIt's not accessible through\nthe operating system, but the ones and\n\n283\n00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,944\nzeros are still there.\n\n284\n00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:13,485\nSo, I could look at potentially\nrebuilding maybe part of that file.\n\n285\n00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:14,344\n>> Fantastic.\n\n286\n00:16:14,344 --> 00:16:20,395\nYeah, that could be enough to recover\nthe evidence you need to push your case,\n\n287\n00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:23,247\nor to support the case even further.\n\n288\n00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:28,405\nSo, yeah, that's absolutely\na different possibility for you,\n\n289\n00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:34,312\nand it's something that requires that\nyou know how the files system works.\n\n290\n00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:37,213\nYou know how it deletes and manages files,\n\n291\n00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:42,532\nbecause if you don't know about how it\nworks, understanding file carving and\n\n292\n00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:47,385\neven realize that's a possibility\nis not even possible at that point.\n\n293\n00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:51,515\nYou would think that if it deletes this\nand puts something else new on top of it,\n\n294\n00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:54,907\nwell, then hey, that was there,\nsomething else is there now.\n\n295\n00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:56,394\nThe other stuff went bye bye.\n\n296\n00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:58,367\nNo, it doesn't have to go bye bye.\n\n297\n00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,745\nIf it's not using that whole cluster,\nthere's other stuff still left behind that\n\n298\n00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:06,745\nmay be enough, and in fact, if you use\nsome of these viewing utilities which\n\n299\n00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:11,086\nwe're going to be getting to some of the\nstuff that I introduced to you yesterday.\n\n300\n00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:15,811\nIf you look at some of those utilities, if\nyou can view enough of the file that maybe\n\n301\n00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:20,263\nyou still have some garbage in it, but\nthat stuff you carved out and you view,\n\n302\n00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:23,823\nyou may be able to ascertain enough\nfrom the pattern of bits and\n\n303\n00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:27,421\nother stuff that's in there and\ntell what type of file it was.\n\n304\n00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,521\nAnd you may be able to graph the header or\nsomething onto it to make it readable by\n\n305\n00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:34,586\nthe original application,\nand then, see what you have.\n\n306\n00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:38,994\n>> And then, if we were gonna mention\nany anti forensic type operations,\n\n307\n00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:43,254\nthere are programs that we have\nmentioned already a couple of times,\n\n308\n00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:44,583\nthat can go through.\n\n309\n00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:49,432\nAnd what we would call wipe that disk or\nsanitize that disk, where obviously,\n\n310\n00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:51,713\njust deleting it is not good enough.\n\n311\n00:17:51,713 --> 00:17:55,297\nSo, these sanitizers, what they're\ndoing is they're writing ones or\n\n312\n00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:58,116\nzeroes all the way across to\nevery part of that drive, and\n\n313\n00:17:58,116 --> 00:18:01,604\nthen possibly going back and\ndoing it again, and then doing it again.\n\n314\n00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:06,643\nAnd what we're really trying to do is\nensure that every bit of that drive has\n\n315\n00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:11,767\nbeen overwritten with some useless\ninformation, right, which is zeros,\n\n316\n00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:17,450\nor whatever the case may be and that is\nhow we can try to get rid of that data.\n\n317\n00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,938\nSo, Sean, I think you've got something you\nwant to show us here that might help us\n\n318\n00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:22,213\nanalyze these file systems.\n\n319\n00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:25,681\nAgain, we're not spending a lot of time\non the file systems themselves and\n\n320\n00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:29,481\nthe mechanics of the hard drives, cuz\nthat's covered in our different classes,\n\n321\n00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:32,639\nin our A plus, in our server,\nwe talk about the file systems there.\n\n322\n00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:36,748\nI know Don has gone over some of the Apple\nfile systems and then we've got our Linux\n\n323\n00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:41,054\nclasses that are coming out, that we'll\nlearn all about those Linux file systems.\n\n324\n00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:45,545\nIn this particular set of episodes,\nwe really wanna focus on recovering\n\n325\n00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:49,887\nthat data off of those, which we're\ngonna do in future episodes, but\n\n326\n00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:53,217\nI think right now,\nyou've got something to show us.\n\n327\n00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,842\n>> What I'm showing here is\nsomething called Autopsy and\n\n328\n00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:59,768\nwe're gonna see more of Autopsy right now.\n\n329\n00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:03,408\nThis is kinda just about\nto be a cursory look at it,\n\n330\n00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:08,101\nkind of give you some insight into\nsome of the tools that we have.\n\n331\n00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:10,990\nWhat we're seeing here\nis I have mounted a,\n\n332\n00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,373\nopened up a case is what they call\nit here and put my information in.\n\n333\n00:19:15,373 --> 00:19:20,259\nAnd then, I told it to open up\na data source which, in this case,\n\n334\n00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,441\nis an ISO file of Kali Linux.\n\n335\n00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:25,548\nNothing really all that exciting, but\n\n336\n00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:30,253\nwhat I have is, I can look at it,\nand I've opened it up, and\n\n337\n00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:35,165\nyou could see over here,\nI'm actually browsing that image.\n\n338\n00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:39,900\nI can click inside here and see\nindividual files and details on a file,\n\n339\n00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,435\nwhen it was accessed.\n\n340\n00:19:41,435 --> 00:19:46,090\nI can see rights on some of these files,\nif you go through it, and\n\n341\n00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:51,176\nlike I said, we're gonna get more\ninto depth on this as we go through,\n\n342\n00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:54,711\nbut this is just kind of\ntelling you what we have,\n\n343\n00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:58,532\nwhat we would see if we were\nlooking at a file system.\n\n344\n00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,958\nWe've even been seeing hashes\nof individual files in here.\n\n345\n00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:06,057\nIf stuff had been deleted,\nI would actually see that too,\n\n346\n00:20:06,057 --> 00:20:10,158\nthat it had been deallocated or\nwhatever, appropriate,\n\n347\n00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:14,358\naccordingly depending on what\nthat actual situation was.\n\n348\n00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:18,269\nThe cool thing about this is that you can\ntag files in here for later analysis.\n\n349\n00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:21,853\nYou can export it as CSV or\nHTML or even an excel file and\n\n350\n00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:25,198\nhave it all brought up in\na spreadsheet in there and\n\n351\n00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:29,440\nmake it easy to search or\neasy to stick into your evidence pile.\n\n352\n00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,215\nSo, this is just an example of it.\n\n353\n00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:35,279\nIt will tell you all\nthe little details about it.\n\n354\n00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:41,261\nIf we kind of zoom that up a bit,\nmaybe give you a little more detail there,\n\n355\n00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:46,376\nyou can kind of see some of\nthe information that's popping up,\n\n356\n00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:50,938\nbut that's on the overall file,\nthe overall ISO file.\n\n357\n00:20:50,938 --> 00:20:53,772\nAnd then you can see I have three\ndifferent volumes inside of it.\n\n358\n00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:58,415\nIt's Linux volume, so that represents\nthe different pieces within Linux.\n\n359\n00:20:58,415 --> 00:21:01,955\nAnd then, these are different files and\nall that themselves inside of it.\n\n360\n00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:05,111\nSo, it's-\n>> It's a lot more than say\n\n361\n00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:09,164\nWindows Explorer or some kind of file\nexplorer where I'm just seeing the files.\n\n362\n00:21:09,164 --> 00:21:13,720\nThis is actually giving me the breakdown\nof how those files are stored on that file\n\n363\n00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,262\nsystem.\n\n364\n00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:17,699\nI can see beginning points and\nending points, change,\n\n365\n00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:22,104\nmodification dates, all kinds of\ninformation we can get out of there.\n\n366\n00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:24,889\n>> Yes, it would allow you to\npreview some types of files.\n\n367\n00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:31,172\nI have a thumbnail button up there that\nI can preview some sorts of things and\n\n368\n00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:35,175\nsome sorts of files right\nhere in this product.\n\n369\n00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:39,715\nWhat's really neat about it is, it's\nreally geared towards the investigator.\n\n370\n00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,593\nAn investigator can use this tool and\nit can generate the reports and\n\n371\n00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:48,573\nput the investigator's name, initials,\nand date and time, and stamp everything.\n\n372\n00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:53,044\nAnd it can even build hashes of files, and\ncompare those hashes to other things on\n\n373\n00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:55,689\nthe system to see, oh,\nwell, we have a match.\n\n374\n00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,604\nThese two files are actually the same,\n\n375\n00:21:57,604 --> 00:22:01,621\neven though they may look different on\nthe outside, they're actually the same.\n\n376\n00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,294\nIt'll look at the fingerprints on it.\n\n377\n00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:06,587\nSo, it can do quite a bit for\nyou, and it can analyze any of\n\n378\n00:22:06,587 --> 00:22:11,405\nthe file systems that you, probably any\nof the file systems that you've run into.\n\n379\n00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:15,085\nBut we'll visit more of that later on.\n\n380\n00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:19,650\nI just kinda wanted to show how you\ncould start to examine some of these\n\n381\n00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,682\nfile systems.\n\n382\n00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:24,464\nAnd I could actually punch this in so\nit views a actual,\n\n383\n00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:27,520\nI'm looking at a logical file system here.\n\n384\n00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,991\nI could view an actual physical\nhard drive through this, too.\n\n385\n00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:34,576\nSo, I could pop something in,\nor use this utility on a drive\n\n386\n00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:38,617\nthat's been connected to the system and\nhas a write blocker on it.\n\n387\n00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:41,026\nI can use this to examine it to see\nif there's been anything that's been\n\n388\n00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:41,677\ndeleted on there.\n\n389\n00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:44,312\nLike I would with the kit\nI had in here yesterday.\n\n390\n00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:45,334\n>> All right, okay.\n\n391\n00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:48,274\nSo, this is gonna allow me to\nanalyze those hard drives or\n\n392\n00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:51,413\nCD-ROMs that we've done here,\nor DVDs, or what have you.\n\n393\n00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:54,317\nMaking sure I throw a write\nblocker around there, so\n\n394\n00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:58,818\nno possible chance of making any change\nto that data that's on that file system.\n\n395\n00:22:58,818 --> 00:23:02,182\nIt'll really give me a pretty low,\nI don't wanna say low level, but\n\n396\n00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:05,836\na pretty relatively low level look at\nwhat's going on in that file system.\n\n397\n00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:08,517\n>> Yeah, this can get, I mean,\nthis can easily, when you look through it,\n\n398\n00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,355\nyou see the stuff that\nit's actually providing.\n\n399\n00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:14,361\nIt's got, there's, I mean, we haven't\neven gone through all the files and\n\n400\n00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:15,645\npossibilities in here.\n\n401\n00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,737\nBut it's giving you so much, and\n\n402\n00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:21,864\nmost of this stuff you can pull out\neven more info on it if you want.\n\n403\n00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:25,685\n>> So, this is the Sleuth Kit,\nwhich can be part of Autopsy, but\n\n404\n00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:28,272\nI can also obtain Sleuth Kit on it's own?\n\n405\n00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:28,923\n>> Yes.\n\n406\n00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:30,248\nIt's cross-platform.\n\n407\n00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:35,256\nIf you just want the Sleuth Kit,\nyou can get it entirely on its own,\n\n408\n00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:39,549\nbut Autopsy actually acts as\na nice graphical front end,\n\n409\n00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:42,243\nwhich is what you're seeing here.\n\n410\n00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:44,436\nAnd it bring in other tools to the table,\ntoo.\n\n411\n00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:48,837\nSo, it's probably better if\nyou're gonna use a Sleuth Kit.\n\n412\n00:23:48,837 --> 00:23:51,762\nJust get Autopsy,\nmake your life a little easier.\n\n413\n00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:54,025\nSo, there you go.\n\n414\n00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:55,973\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n415\n00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:56,751\nWell, good deal, Sean.\n\n416\n00:23:56,751 --> 00:24:00,106\nLot of information about our hard drives\nand our file systems again And it was\n\n417\n00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:03,893\npretty high level overview of this, this\nshould be assumed knowledge at this point.\n\n418\n00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:08,330\nLike we didn't talk about RAID levels,\nwe didn't talk about the different files,\n\n419\n00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,580\nwe didn't break down each one of those\nfile systems or anything like that.\n\n420\n00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,550\nAt this point, we just wanna\nfamiliarize ourselves with the concept,\n\n421\n00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:20,830\nthe hardware,\nlater on we're gonna dive in depth into\n\n422\n00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:25,020\nhow we actually go about recovering data\noff of those different file systems.\n\n423\n00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,290\nSo anything else we wanna\nthrow in at this point?\n\n424\n00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,890\n>> I would just tell you if you\nfeel a little kind of sideways or\n\n425\n00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,390\na little rusty on\nthe different file systems.\n\n426\n00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:42,230\nJust take a quick either read on it or\nwe've\n\n427\n00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,780\ngot some great episodes already posted\nup there for you to look at and review.\n\n428\n00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,557\n>> How about a little ITVproTV plug right.\n\n429\n00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:50,218\n>> Yeah.\n\n430\n00:24:50,218 --> 00:24:54,027\n>> You guys know we've got lots of\nepisodes in that libraries that you have\n\n431\n00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:58,152\naccess to, so go check out the A plus\nlevel to get that hardware information,\n\n432\n00:24:58,152 --> 00:24:59,660\ntalking about raid.\n\n433\n00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,700\nAnd then look at some of the different\noperating system episodes to learn about\n\n434\n00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:08,300\nthe specific file systems for\nthose individual operating systems.\n\n435\n00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,160\n>> Yeah.\nThat knowledge is gonna pay off a lot when\n\n436\n00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,730\nyou get in and look at this type of stuff\n\n437\n00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,000\nI would tend to go after\nthe big ones probably first.\n\n438\n00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,620\nI'd go after the FAT file systems, NTFS.\n\n439\n00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,530\nAnd then the Linux ones,\nthe X, the X2, X3,\n\n440\n00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,010\nall those ones, get familiar with those.\n\n441\n00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,898\nAnd make those your targets,\nand then after that,\n\n442\n00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,695\nthen you go to the MAC ones and-\n>> Maybe Apple and HFS or something.\n\n443\n00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:37,330\n>> Yeah.\n\n444\n00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,500\nThose ones would depend on whether\nyou have those in your environment.\n\n445\n00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,030\nIf you have those in your\nenvironment then yeah,\n\n446\n00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:45,920\nyou know what your job is,\nit is to go through that.\n\n447\n00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,935\nSome of these credentials actually mention\nZFS, the ones that they use for Solaris.\n\n448\n00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:54,119\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah so,\nI mean if you've got those or\n\n449\n00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:59,492\nhave those still around then yeah, I guess\nyou're gonna have to learn those too.\n\n450\n00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:04,489\nSo you'll need to figure it out but\nfamiliar yourself at a very intimate\n\n451\n00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:09,090\nlevel, how these file systems work and\nany specifics about it.\n\n452\n00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,930\nFor NTFS, know that there's something\ncalled an MFT in there, for\n\n453\n00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,160\nexample, and\nknow the significance of that.\n\n454\n00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,205\nKnow that it supports EFS and\nsupports compression and stuff like that,\n\n455\n00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:23,796\ncuz those are things that will\ncome into play definitely later.\n\n456\n00:26:23,796 --> 00:26:25,360\nAll right, well very good.\n\n457\n00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,700\nGreat information.\n\n458\n00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,460\nI want to thank everybody for tuning in.\n\n459\n00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,030\nRemember, if you guys have a question\nduring

morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:37,760\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,840\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriano.\n\n7\n00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,890\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,430\n>> Pretty good.\n\n9\n00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,050\nHow about you?\n\n10\n00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,070\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,150\nLooking forward to today.\n\n12\n00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,700\nWe've got a couple of great\nepisodes coming your way.\n\n13\n00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,190\nIn this episode we're continuing on with\nour digital forensic investigator series.\n\n14\n00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,670\nAnd in this episode we're doing data\nacquisition and duplication, which is\n\n15\n00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,276\nreally one of the big part of that\nforensic investigation process right Sean?\n\n16\n00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:04,670\n>> Yes,\nwe've progressed pretty far at this point.\n\n17\n00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,670\nWe've gone through the laws and\nstuff like that.\n\n18\n00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,050\nSo we kind of know what we've got\nto obey and the ground rules.\n\n19\n00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,310\nStuff like that.\n\n20\n00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,820\nAnd we have collected and\npreserved evidence.\n\n21\n00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,320\nNow it's time to start learning\nabout how we're gonna dig\n\n22\n00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,310\nthrough some of that stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,490\nSo some of those utilities that\nwe talked about the other day and\n\n24\n00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,050\ntold you guys that you should\nmaybe start downloading.\n\n25\n00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,430\nThat's stuff that we're\ngetting into using today.\n\n26\n00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,450\nSo, good news on that front.\n\n27\n00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,510\nWe're gonna see how to acquire\nstuff off of live systems and\n\n28\n00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,770\ntalk about some of the stuff off\nof acquire it off a dead system,\n\n29\n00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,640\nas they call it, and then a lot of\nother stuff revolving around that.\n\n30\n00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,800\n>> Nice, sounds like a lot of fun.\n\n31\n00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,010\nYeah, because at this point,\n\n32\n00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,790\nas Sean said we've got through\nthe stuff we have to know, right.\n\n33\n00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,320\nAs a forensic investigator we've got\nto be familiar with the laws and\n\n34\n00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,400\nmake sure that we're doing this properly,\nbecause the end result, we might want to\n\n35\n00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,750\nterminate an employee, or do some kind\nof reprimand against an employee, or\n\n36\n00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,960\nwe want to prosecute it in criminal court.\n\n37\n00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,860\nSo we've got everything collected,\nmaybe we're back at the lab,\n\n38\n00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,680\ndepending on what the scenario is, right.\n\n39\n00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,350\nBut now we want to start digging through\nthat evidence, and so we get to play.\n\n40\n00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,560\nWe get to take it.\n\n41\n00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,220\nThis is the part that as a forensic\ninvestigator I think we find\n\n42\n00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,810\nexciting, right.\n\n43\n00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,720\nThis is why we do it.\n\n44\n00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,630\nBecause now we actually get to dive in\nthere and try to see what we can find and\n\n45\n00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,870\ndo the investigation part.\n\n46\n00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,940\n>> Yeah.\nWe're starting to dig in and\n\n47\n00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,970\nsee what's actually there.\n\n48\n00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:29,290\nWe've done presumably a lot at this point\nwith all the collection techniques and\n\n49\n00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,400\nall that we've done and\nfollowed the procedure.\n\n50\n00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,630\nThey said now we gotta see what's actually\nthere to see what type of information\n\n51\n00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,280\nthat may actually exist or may not exist,\nand just keep going right on through.\n\n52\n00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,130\nAnd so it's kind of an exciting process.\n\n53\n00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,650\nIt can be meticulous, but\nit's kind of an exciting process to do.\n\n54\n00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,490\n>> Absolutely.\n\n55\n00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,750\nYeah, hopefully you guys are, if you're\nlike me, and I'm sure most of you are,\n\n56\n00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,220\nI mean Sean and I here.\n\n57\n00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,670\nWe're geeks right, and\nthis is the part we find exciting.\n\n58\n00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,550\nYes, it might be boring to some people,\nor too detailed, but I love it.\n\n59\n00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,420\nAll right.\n\n60\n00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,160\nSo Sean, first thing we wanna\ntalk about is just some concepts,\n\n61\n00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,320\nbecause when we talk about acquisition,\nwe really have two different\n\n62\n00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,250\ntypes that we do, or two different,\nI don't know if I wanna call them types,\n\n63\n00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,660\nbut categories would\nmaybe be a better term.\n\n64\n00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,420\n>> Yeah, or you could say two different\nenvironments that you possibly could\n\n65\n00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,470\nencounter.\n\n66\n00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,590\nYou could, if you go into an environment,\n\n67\n00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,675\nit's possible that the system is\ngonna exist in one of two states\n\n68\n00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:28,665\nin what they call the static,\nor I also call it a dead state.\n\n69\n00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:30,525\nIt's not on.\n\n70\n00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:33,465\nOkay?\nSo, that's pretty straightforward.\n\n71\n00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:36,940\nThat just means you're gonna\nmove right into imaging.\n\n72\n00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,460\nAnd grabbing the stuff, and then analyze\nthat image later on down the road which we\n\n73\n00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,610\nactually looked at the one of the tools\nfor doing that yesterday, the Sleuth Kit.\n\n74\n00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,830\nIt's one of the tools that we\nwould use to analyze images.\n\n75\n00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,580\nBut then you also have the other one that\ngets to be a little more tricky which is\n\n76\n00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,610\nthe live system,\nwhich is the system that's on.\n\n77\n00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,050\nAnd you only have one\nchance to get that right.\n\n78\n00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,510\nOnce that system's been powered\noff that environment's gone.\n\n79\n00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,350\n>> Yeah, we've talked about\nthis in previous episodes.\n\n80\n00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,180\nWe've gotta worry about volatility, right?\n\n81\n00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,080\nSo if I've got a dead or static system.\n\n82\n00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,370\nAll that's gone already.\n\n83\n00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,290\nSomebody's powered the system down or\nsomething has happened, or\n\n84\n00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,160\nit was down when we got there.\n\n85\n00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,040\nSo there is no volatile stuff to gather,\nso we just get right in to, as you said,\n\n86\n00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,545\nthe disk duplication or\nwhatever our next step is.\n\n87\n00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:24,275\nAnd start getting that evidence, but\n\n88\n00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:26,825\nif it's live,\nthat makes a big difference, right?\n\n89\n00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:30,405\nNow I've gotta take it all into\nconsideration, the order of volatility.\n\n90\n00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:33,870\nWe've gotta have our procedure in place,\nand think about what order do we\n\n91\n00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,505\nwanna try to get this information,\nprioritizing, and things like that.\n\n92\n00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:39,936\nSo it does change the game completely,\ndoesn't it?\n\n93\n00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:41,351\n>> Yes.\n\n94\n00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:45,100\nIf one of them does have active\nprocesses and connections and\n\n95\n00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,585\nthings like that, that we're trying\nto capture before we do anything,\n\n96\n00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:54,145\nthe other one has stuff just written\nto the disc and stored there.\n\n97\n00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:56,970\nAnd, even though the system's dead,\nby the way,\n\n98\n00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,260\nit doesn't necessarily mean that\nall the stuff that I want is gone.\n\n99\n00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,320\nIt just means that any active processes or\nmemory, that's gone.\n\n100\n00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,692\nYou're not doing anything\nwith that anymore,\n\n101\n00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:13,770\nnow even by saying\nthe system's turned off,\n\n102\n00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,140\nyou lost the stuff in memory, even then\nthere's like an asterisk next to it.\n\n103\n00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,790\nDid you really lose the stuff in memory?\n\n104\n00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,490\nThere are still places to look that you're\nnot going to get everything that was still\n\n105\n00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,250\nthere but you still could get something or\nfind ways to do it.\n\n106\n00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,275\nIt's actually kind of fascinating and\nwe're going to talk about that today too.\n\n107\n00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:28,950\n>> Nice.\n\n108\n00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,660\n>> So, that's,\nit's kind of an exciting thing.\n\n109\n00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,850\n>> Absolutely, I love it.\n\n110\n00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,040\nAll right, so,\ndata acquisition types right,\n\n111\n00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,660\nwe gotta kind of set types of the data\nthat we're trying to acquire?\n\n112\n00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,200\n>> Yes, when we talk about acquiring data\nwe're kind of talking about the imaging\n\n113\n00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,150\ntype that we're gonna be looking at\nthe formats or the image can come out as.\n\n114\n00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,340\nWe have three raw propriety, and\n\n115\n00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,060\none that's called the AFF\nadvanced forensics format.\n\n116\n00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,870\nEach one has their own pros and\ncons, like anything.\n\n117\n00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,310\nSo just kind of go through it.\n\n118\n00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,930\nThe raw one is just like it sounds.\n\n119\n00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,820\nYou're getting the dump of what's there.\n\n120\n00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,780\nIt's not doing any special\nprocessing of that image.\n\n121\n00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,200\nIt's just boom, it's dumped out and\nthat's what you get.\n\n122\n00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,280\nAnd a lot of applications do support that.\n\n123\n00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,640\nIn fact, again,\n\n124\n00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,190\nto go back to yesterday the autopsy\nkit does actually support that.\n\n125\n00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,902\nYou can view a raw image.\n\n126\n00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:35,860\nIt may, and since it's raw, it's gonna\nrequire some additional manipulations and\n\n127\n00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,070\nstuff like that for you to go through it.\n\n128\n00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:43,070\nJust like if you want to view\nsome other temporary files,\n\n129\n00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,800\nstuff like that in the system, those\nare probably gonna be in raw format too.\n\n130\n00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,730\nSo, you will see it again and again.\n\n131\n00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,130\nJust cuz you're getting a raw format and\nhave to do additional manipulations\n\n132\n00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,090\ndoesn't mean you should\nkind of shy away from it.\n\n133\n00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,510\nSometimes that's only going to\nbe the only viable solution or\n\n134\n00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,910\nonly way of getting in period\nto get anything at all.\n\n135\n00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,980\n>> So we're talking about raw data.\n\n136\n00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,250\nWe're talking about data that's not\nformatted anyways like a straight dump out\n\n137\n00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,390\nof memory or something like that.\n\n138\n00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,680\nOr from an application, temp files.\n\n139\n00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,850\nAnd so it might not be human readable\nright away, or it might be something that\n\n140\n00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,010\nwe gotta do a little deciphering\nto figure out what it is?\n\n141\n00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,860\n>> Yeah, in fact it may not even be,\nwell as we're gonna find out as we explore\n\n142\n00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,610\nthrough this, you're gonna find out\nthat some of that raw data isn't\n\n143\n00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,021\nreally what you would consider anything\neven close to being human readable.\n\n144\n00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:33,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You'll have to do string searches\n\n145\n00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,807\nthrough it to look for\ncertain sequences and yeah,\n\n146\n00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:41,213\nthis is where you get those tools and\nif we didn't say it before, you're\n\n147\n00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:45,909\ngonna have to be really patient, really\nmeticulous, and get used to the fact\n\n148\n00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:50,560\nthat you may be kind of sorting through\nstuff that just looks really boring.\n\n149\n00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,340\nI don't know about you guys.\n\n150\n00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,985\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't like looking at a string of\n\n151\n00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:54,160\nbits going across the screen.\n\n152\n00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,220\nIt's not the most exciting.\n\n153\n00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,749\nThing in the world to look at but-\n>> You're saying\n\n154\n00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:01,660\nwe're gonna disprove\nthe CSI effect right here.\n\n155\n00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,310\n>> Yeah.\n>> This is not gonna happen\n\n156\n00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,470\nin the commercial break.\n\n157\n00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> You're not gonna come back from getting\n\n158\n00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,310\na cup of coffee and it's done already.\n\n159\n00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,502\n>> Yeah, it's not going to be like that.\n\n160\n00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:11,976\nIt'll be like a season of 24.\n\n161\n00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:14,065\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's more like what it's gonna be.\n\n162\n00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:14,703\n>> That's good, I like that.\n\n163\n00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,280\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's gonna go on for a while.\n\n164\n00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,150\n>> An hour later and\nthey've only made it through five minutes.\n\n165\n00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,484\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n166\n00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:23,220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's exactly what we got going on\n\n167\n00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,030\nhere, so.\n\n168\n00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,300\nOne of the things, like I said,\n\n169\n00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,735\nyou're gonna learn here is that you're\ngonna have to use what's given you.\n\n170\n00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:38,282\nAnd searching through bits of data,\nlike I said, not the most exciting thing.\n\n171\n00:08:38,282 --> 00:08:41,439\nBut if that's the only way\nto get the information or\n\n172\n00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:45,780\nsee if the information even exists,\nthen you're gonna have to do it.\n\n173\n00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:51,617\nAlso, it's a good point to also warn you,\nor give you a little tip that,\n\n174\n00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:55,448\nlearn to take breaks when\nyou're doing this and\n\n175\n00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:58,940\nmanage your time when you're doing this.\n\n176\n00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,970\nYou can be dead on and\n\n177\n00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,510\nalert when you're looking at something\nonscreen when you initially start.\n\n178\n00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,390\nBut they've already proven that\nthe way the human brain works,\n\n179\n00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,820\nif you take a period of time\nthat you're doing a task,\n\n180\n00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,600\nyou're really alert at the beginning and\nyou're really alert at the end.\n\n181\n00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,406\nCuz you just started it here, and here\nyou're watching the clock, and oh look,\n\n182\n00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:18,700\nit's almost over.\n\n183\n00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,130\nSo you get this little, that dip in there.\n\n184\n00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,830\nAnd when you're looking at some of this\nstuff, these bits and this evidence,\n\n185\n00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,290\nit is possible when you're\ndoing all this processing\n\n186\n00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,740\nthat you may miss something\nin the middle of that.\n\n187\n00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,320\nIt becomes more likely.\n\n188\n00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,670\nSo what you try to do is you try to kinda\nshorten it or change tasks a little bit.\n\n189\n00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,830\nIt can be kinda healthy for some people.\n\n190\n00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,860\n>> You know what you do?\n\n191\n00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,166\nYou look at pictures of baby animals.\n\n192\n00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:43,921\n>> If that works.\n\n193\n00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,839\n[LAUGH]\n>> I was reading this the other day.\n\n194\n00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,740\nNow I haven't done a lot of research into\nit to see what group did this study.\n\n195\n00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,810\nBut they were talking about\nwhere if you stop and\n\n196\n00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,510\ntake a look at pictures of baby animals,\nproductivity actually increases.\n\n197\n00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,084\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Your like, awww.\n\n198\n00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:01,388\n>> I don't know, you get this\nwarm fuzzy feeling inside, and\n\n199\n00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:04,630\nnow you're happy again and you go back to\nwork and you're a little more efficient.\n\n200\n00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,170\nBut yeah,\n\n201\n00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,170\nthe point is whatever you do, you gotta\nmake sure that you're mentally alert.\n\n202\n00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,480\nAnd staring at that screen,\nwe've all done it, we're computer people.\n\n203\n00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,800\nYou stare at the screen for\nan hour, two hours, three hours,\n\n204\n00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,170\nthe brain starts getting a little cloudy,\nthe eyes start getting a little watery.\n\n205\n00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,460\nAnd you gotta get up, stretch,\nget that blood flowing again.\n\n206\n00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,480\nWe've talked about our rooms typically\ndon't have windows to the outside and\n\n207\n00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,370\nthings like that, so\nmaybe you go for a walk.\n\n208\n00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,960\nYou gotta think about securing\nall your evidence and\n\n209\n00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,490\nthings like that, but get up and\ndo some jumping jacks or something.\n\n210\n00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,340\nSomething to get that brain off\nof what you're doing just for\n\n211\n00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,420\na few minutes to revitalize.\n\n212\n00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,966\n>> Time to do the leaning rest.\n\n213\n00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:47,844\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:48,720\n>> Some of you\n\n215\n00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,278\nare Googling that right now.\n\n216\n00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:55,340\nBut yeah,\nthat's a good side discussion to get into,\n\n217\n00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,870\nthat kind of learn that you\nare processing evidence,\n\n218\n00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,160\nyou're trying to look for\nthose things that are very important.\n\n219\n00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,360\nYou don't wanna miss it when you\nare just staring and staring and\n\n220\n00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,310\nstaring and staring at that screen.\n\n221\n00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,330\nIt does happen and though we may\nnot realize it, it does happen.\n\n222\n00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,610\n>> I know I do some coding and\n\n223\n00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,660\nyou can be staring at your code trying\nto figure out where this error is.\n\n224\n00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,210\nAnd you're going and just staring at it,\nand staring at it, and somebody will walk\n\n225\n00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,970\nby and go oh, you're missing a comma\nat the end of that line of code there.\n\n226\n00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,180\nBut it's because I've been staring at it\nso long that my brain is just not focused.\n\n227\n00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,780\nThey walk by and they spot it immediately.\n\n228\n00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so\n\n229\n00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,630\nwe've got raw data that we're gonna have\nto deal with, where we've dumped it right\n\n230\n00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,110\nout of, say, memory or something like\nthat or from application's temp file.\n\n231\n00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,016\nThat we might have to do some deciphering\nof because it's not going to be something\n\n232\n00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:46,590\nI can just read.\n\n233\n00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,620\nOther data acquisition types,\nproprietary data types.\n\n234\n00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,210\n>> Yes,\nthere are a lot of propriety data types.\n\n235\n00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:59,000\nThe one that comes right to mind is, if\nyou are lucky and fortunate enough to have\n\n236\n00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,330\nsomething like EnCase,\nsomething that has all the bells and\n\n237\n00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,190\nwhistles, it does have a propriety\nformat available in it.\n\n238\n00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,320\nAnd so that,\nwhy it's great because a propriety format,\n\n239\n00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,590\nit's great from the sense that usually\nwhen you got those packages like that,\n\n240\n00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,770\nthey have all these features and\nstuff in there that go with it.\n\n241\n00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,580\nAnd they have to have a special format\nto do that because they can't use\n\n242\n00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,770\na generic format to accomplish all that,\nusually.\n\n243\n00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,130\nHowever, you get that situation where\nyou could be locked to that format,\n\n244\n00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,810\nthat's the first thing.\n\n245\n00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:40,030\nThe other thing is that you may not be\nable to analyze it outside that tool.\n\n246\n00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,520\nFortunately something like EnCase is if\nsomeone does give you a file out of that\n\n247\n00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,860\nformat, again, Autopsy is something\nthat will be able to mount that and\n\n248\n00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,990\nbe able to browse that for you.\n\n249\n00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,510\nSo, that's-\n>> So some of these tools we're using,\n\n250\n00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,240\nwe might be able to acquire that data,\nbut then the problem that data is\n\n251\n00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,550\nonly useful within that\nparticular application or tool.\n\n252\n00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,540\nAnd if it doesn't have all my bells and\nwhistles,\n\n253\n00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,760\nif I have more than one suite that I like\nto use, maybe I prefer EnCase for this,\n\n254\n00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,260\nbut I prefer some other suite for\nthis other process.\n\n255\n00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,940\nI might have trouble getting that data\nfrom one of those applications to\n\n256\n00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,580\nthe other because it uses\nthat proprietary format.\n\n257\n00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,660\n>> Yeah, that's definitely something\nthat could come into play.\n\n258\n00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,240\nSo do remember that\nwhen you select a tool.\n\n259\n00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,980\nWe're not gonna worry about it\ntoo much in here because we're\n\n260\n00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,520\njumping between different tools.\n\n261\n00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,444\nBut when you do go out in the field then,\nand\n\n262\n00:13:29,444 --> 00:13:34,331\nyou start setting up your own lab,\nconsider little details like that.\n\n263\n00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:39,295\nIf you're gonna need to move it between\ndifferent systems or different labs, or\n\n264\n00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:44,040\ngonna need to exchange that data with\na wholly different lab that's not under\n\n265\n00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,600\nyour control, you might have to do that.\n\n266\n00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,810\nSo, if that's the case,\n\n267\n00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,010\nyou definitely need to be thinking\nabout those types of things.\n\n268\n00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,380\n>> Another advantage of staying with\nthese standardized tools as well,\n\n269\n00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,070\nrecognized tools, might be that if I do\nhave to share data between facilities or\n\n270\n00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,340\nsomething like that, they could\nvery well be using the same tools.\n\n271\n00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,940\nWhere if I use some off the wall,\nlittle known product, one,\n\n272\n00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,530\nI could have trouble with\nthat in a court of law.\n\n273\n00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,572\nAnd two, nobody else might be\nable to work with that data, huh?\n\n274\n00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:16,460\n>> Yeah, the tools we are gonna be using\ntoday to do our live system analysis and\n\n275\n00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,852\nlook at things off of a system,\n\n276\n00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:23,500\nthose tools are far from being\nthe only ones that do it.\n\n277\n00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,270\nI chose the ones that are easiest\nto get access to, and\n\n278\n00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,425\nalso they're free, and\n\n279\n00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:36,705\nthey do have a track record\nof doing what we want.\n\n280\n00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:38,625\nSo, that's the deal there.\n\n281\n00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,555\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n282\n00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:43,750\nAll right, and then our third data type,\nor data acquisition type that we've gotta\n\n283\n00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,010\ndeal with is\nthe Advanced Forensics Format.\n\n284\n00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,820\nAnd I'll tell you, this was a new one on\nme, Sean, what are we talking about here?\n\n285\n00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,117\n>> [LAUGH] It still is somewhat new,\nactually.\n\n286\n00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:56,278\nThe way I look at this,\nthis is like those open document formats.\n\n287\n00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:02,150\nIt's designed to be something where\nthese companies that are all creating\n\n288\n00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,680\nthese proprietary formats are kinda trying\nto move away from those shenanigans and\n\n289\n00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,860\nsay, let's make something\nthat's universal,\n\n290\n00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,090\nthat can be moved from\nplace to place to place.\n\n291\n00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,740\nSo that's the idea of\nhaving something like this.\n\n292\n00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,520\n>> So if a tool is using AFF, or\nthat Advanced Forensics Format,\n\n293\n00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,100\nthat's a standard, or\nsomething they're trying to standardize\n\n294\n00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,810\namongst all the different forensic\ntools and things like that.\n\n295\n00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,450\n>> Yeah, so if you use that, you should\nbe able to share data pretty readily.\n\n296\n00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,880\nI can tell you from experience,\nI haven't run into this type of stuff yet,\n\n297\n00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,690\nbut I'm always a little leery\nof those universal formats.\n\n298\n00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,844\nIt's not like I'm trying to badmouth it or\nanything, but it's always,\n\n299\n00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:45,534\nyou kinda want to exercise some caution\nand be familiar with what's happening when\n\n300\n00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:50,111\nyou move something between applications\nusing the universal format like this.\n\n301\n00:15:50,111 --> 00:15:55,820\nBecause that saying, you lose something in\nthe translation, seems to come into play.\n\n302\n00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,440\n>> Absolutely.\n\n303\n00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,680\n>> And so, do be aware of that.\n\n304\n00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,420\n>> Yeah.\n\n305\n00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,320\nOkay, yeah, something we gotta consider.\n\n306\n00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,934\nAll right, so\n\n307\n00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:05,170\nwe've got our different data acquisition\ntypes that we have to deal with.\n\n308\n00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,890\nWe've got raw data that\nwe might be capturing.\n\n309\n00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,090\nWe've got proprietary information that we.\n\n310\n00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,640\nAnd I know, I shouldn't say it like that.\n\n311\n00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,770\nWe're not capturing proprietary\ninformation or raw information.\n\n312\n00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,713\nWe're talking the tool that I'm using to\nget this information is dumping it out\n\n313\n00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,831\neither in a RAW format or\nin a proprietary format.\n\n314\n00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:25,736\nOr now we've got this new move\ntowards a standardization,\n\n315\n00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,646\nwhich is the advanced forensics format\nthat some of these tools might support.\n\n316\n00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,810\nSo not talking about\nthe data I'm collecting.\n\n317\n00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,120\nI'm talking about the output of the tool.\n\n318\n00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,738\n>> Yeah, the data would be\nsomething entirely different.\n\n319\n00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:42,723\nI mean, there could be proprietary\ndata on that system but\n\n320\n00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:47,514\nthat's not really playing\ninto this discussion here.\n\n321\n00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,010\n>> That's not what we're\nreferring to here.\n\n322\n00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,470\n>> It's something to be aware of but\n\n323\n00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,090\nwhat you wanna do is always keep\nthese different formats in mind.\n\n324\n00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,460\nYou'll probably at some point in\nyour career as a forensic analyst,\n\n325\n00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,460\nyou will play with all three of them.\n\n326\n00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,270\nIt's just the way it's gonna happen.\n\n327\n00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,300\nI can tell you probably right\nnow that you're at some point,\n\n328\n00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,050\nif you haven't already,\nyou're gonna work with the RAW format.\n\n329\n00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,309\nBecause sometimes that's the only way you\ncan get the information that you need is\n\n330\n00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:14,775\nthat you have to do it,\ndump into a RAW format and\n\n331\n00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:17,350\ncrawl through that to get what you want.\n\n332\n00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,750\nBecause there's nothing that reads it,\npart of a file's missing.\n\n333\n00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,610\nAnd all you have is just\nwithout the header and\n\n334\n00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,950\nstuff like that describing how\nthe file's supposed to be structured.\n\n335\n00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,458\nYou've got a bunch of\nbits just dumped on you.\n\n336\n00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,499\nSo, if that's the case,\nthen what are you gonna do?\n\n337\n00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:34,540\nSay, up, I'm outta here,\nI can't do anything with it.\n\n338\n00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,450\nNo, you're gonna have to work with it.\n\n339\n00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,800\nYou're job just got a little more tedious,\nand a little tougher.\n\n340\n00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,770\nBut you guys'll be able to handle that.\n\n341\n00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,780\n>> In fact,\nit's something that we're kinda used to.\n\n342\n00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,350\nWe've seen it already, like we've talked\nabout Wireshark and packet captures.\n\n343\n00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,910\nThat's exactly what we're doing there,\nright?\n\n344\n00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,780\nWe're using this utility Wireshark and\nWinPcap or something like that to\n\n345\n00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,020\ngrab those raw packets,\nopen them up and look at that, right?\n\n346\n00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,230\nAnd you guys,\nwe've done entire episodes on this.\n\n347\n00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,970\nIf you haven't seen them,\ngo check them out.\n\n348\n00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,560\nYou open up that TCP packet, and\nyou're seeing that raw data in there.\n\n349\n00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,750\nYou see that hex information.\n\n350\n00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,060\nIt does nicely format that data for\nus, like in Wireshark,\n\n351\n00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,340\nwhere I can kinda expand out the different\nheader fields and things like that.\n\n352\n00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,470\nBut, we're working with raw data.\n\n353\n00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,435\nAnd that's where having some kinda\ntool that can interpret that data and\n\n354\n00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:22,589\nhelp me figure out what it is will help.\n\n355\n00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:23,698\nIt will make it a little bit easier.\n\n356\n00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:27,870\n>> Yeah, you're gonna be able\nto make some choices in here.\n\n357\n00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,335\nBut you are gonna pretty\nmuch be working with these\n\n358\n00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:34,485\ndifferent main categories of it.\n\n359\n00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:37,925\nAs far as proprietary one goes,\nI mean there's plenty of\n\n360\n00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:44,375\nsuites that will generate their own\nproprietary formats that are trusted.\n\n361\n00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,515\nI just mentioned EnCase but\nthere are other ones out there.\n\n362\n00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:51,455\nSo you can find other ones that\nalso have the capability or\n\n363\n00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:54,290\nby default generate their\nown proprietary format.\n\n364\n00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,810\nYou've gotta decide if that's something\nthat you're willing to deal with.\n\n365\n00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,150\nIt will do raw stuff as well but\n\n366\n00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,340\nthey will also have their own proprietary\nstuff that if you're just going ahead and\n\n367\n00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,210\nchugging along, saving stuff to it all\nthe time, you gotta take into account\n\n368\n00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,840\nis it something that's gonna\nbe able to be exchanged.\n\n369\n00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,141\nIf you stick with the major tools then,\neven with proprietary one,\n\n370\n00:19:14,141 --> 00:19:17,324\nyou'll probably get\nbringing pretty good luck.\n\n371\n00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,207\n>> That's what they're there for you.\n\n372\n00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:22,327\n>> Yeah, I mentioned and\nkeep mentioning EnCase for a reason.\n\n373\n00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,140\nI'm not endorsing them or anything else.\n\n374\n00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,590\n>> He's getting a check every\ntime he says the word EnCase.\n\n375\n00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,120\nYou know that?\n>> Unless they're gonna give me one for\n\n376\n00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,510\nfree, then it's the best thing out there.\n\n377\n00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,840\n>> I would sell my chain for\nit if I had one.\n\n378\n00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,940\nI mentioned it just\nbecause every time I do\n\n379\n00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,370\na lecture on forensics or\nI'm doing a class on forensics,\n\n380\n00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,700\nI definitely hear end cases being\nbrought up just constantly.\n\n381\n00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,913\n>> It was one of the first big ones that\nwas widely accepted by the court systems\n\n382\n00:19:54,913 --> 00:19:55,580\nhere in the US.\n\n383\n00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,854\nMost of the law enforcement\nagencies in the US rely on it.\n\n384\n00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:00,815\nSo it is definitely got a name out there.\n\n385\n00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:02,498\nIt's one of the more popular ones.\n\n386\n00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:05,237\n>> Yeah,\nit's definitely got a long history.\n\n387\n00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:11,027\nAnd if you look at any of the stuff\nthat's, just kind of an FYI,\n\n388\n00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:17,148\nif you're ever looking at,\nif you're ever picked up the stuff for\n\n389\n00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:21,990\nEC-Council CHFI,\nit's plastered all over that.\n\n390\n00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:28,156\nI mean, that has its, they have\nthe reasons for doing that I suppose.\n\n391\n00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:30,966\nNot to kinda criticize their decision or\nanything, but\n\n392\n00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:33,640\njust remember, it's not the only one.\n\n393\n00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,970\nThey have a few products\nthat they kinda push.\n\n394\n00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,420\nIt's like EnCase and then all the parabin\ntools, they push in there as well.\n\n395\n00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,120\nI just want you to be aware\nthere are options out there.\n\n396\n00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,970\nAnd they do generate these things.\n\n397\n00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:48,810\nRead up on them.\n\n398\n00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,600\nEvaluate it.\n\n399\n00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,480\nTalk and see which ones are best for you.\n\n400\n00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,550\nIf you decide EnCase is the best and the\nformats and all that work for you, then,\n\n401\n00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,500\nby all means, I'm not anybody that can\nsit there and say, you're an idiot for\n\n402\n00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,650\nchoosing that.\n\n403\n00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,728\nWell, I can say that-\n>> He probably, but he won't say it live.\n\n404\n00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,842\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He just won't do it live on camera.\n\n405\n00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:05,108\n>> Yeah, you'll never see that on tape.\n\n406\n00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:09,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, yeah, there you go.\n\n407\n00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,850\nRight there.\n\n408\n00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,380\n>> All right, so we've got our\ndifferent data acquisition types, or\n\n409\n00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,520\noutput from these products.\n\n410\n00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,950\nWe also have to worry one of the other\nthings we wanna talk about is backing up,\n\n411\n00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,390\nor we got back up versus\nbit stream images.\n\n412\n00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,510\n>> Yeah, and that's one of the things\nyou're gonna have to worry about.\n\n413\n00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:31,060\nBefore we talk about the actual format\nyou're getting stuff off the drive,\n\n414\n00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,210\nyou need to think about what's best for\nyou.\n\n415\n00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,430\nIs it best just to\nselect individual files,\n\n416\n00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,060\nor grab other items from it,\nor grab the whole thing?\n\n417\n00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,560\nWe need to be figuring out how we're gonna\nattack that problem of grabbing stuff\n\n418\n00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,360\noff that actual device.\n\n419\n00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,260\nAnd at this point we don't even,\nwe talked about, at the end of yesterday,\n\n420\n00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,130\nwe talked about whether we had\na platter spinning around in there,\n\n421\n00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,780\nor you had a bunch of chips\nthat bits were moving around.\n\n422\n00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,820\nWe've moved away from that.\n\n423\n00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,970\nWe're talking about capturing\nwhat's on that drive.\n\n424\n00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,446\nKnowing the limitations of various things\nare, and file systems are important\n\n425\n00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:15,410\nin a logical structure cuz that's gonna\ndictate how your image is gonna work.\n\n426\n00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,665\nBut, what we need to be thinking\nabout ahead is what we need and\n\n427\n00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:23,477\nthen that will dictate if we're gonna\ndo backup, what type of imaging,\n\n428\n00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:25,485\ncuz it's not just one type of imaging.\n\n429\n00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:29,510\nThere's actually multiple types\nof imaging that we can use.\n\n430\n00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,900\nSo that becomes a very\ninteresting discussion.\n\n431\n00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,790\nA very, very interesting discussion.\n\n432\n00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,902\nWe've been talking, and most people\nthat come from IT have been taught for\n\n433\n00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:41,260\na long time, an image is an image, right?\n\n434\n00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,910\n>> Right.\n>> And it's only when you get in later you\n\n435\n00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,970\nstart learning, oh,\nthere's some differences in there.\n\n436\n00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,810\nFor us, we can't be oh,\nthere's some differences.\n\n437\n00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,900\nThere are differences.\n\n438\n00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,928\nYou'd better know them,\nbecause that's gonna impact what you get,\n\n439\n00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:55,438\nand as well as what you don't get.\n\n440\n00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:57,720\n>> Right, very good, very good.\n\n441\n00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,530\nAnd then, we were talking about logical\nversus sparse image collection,\n\n442\n00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,760\nwhat are we referring to there?\n\n443\n00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,076\n>> That's the amount of\ndata that you're gonna get.\n\n444\n00:23:07,076 --> 00:23:11,940\nAnd that kind of fits in\nwith the discussion of\n\n445\n00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,600\nwhen you grab a backup versus an image.\n\n446\n00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,470\nThose two topics kind of interlock.\n\n447\n00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,560\nWhen you do a backup you\ncan easily do a backup.\n\n448\n00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,390\nWe all know how to do a backup,\npresumably.\n\n449\n00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,926\nYou guys know.\nYou're doing it every day in your home\n\n450\n00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:26,510\nsystems, right?\n\n451\n00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,149\n>> Of course.\n\n452\n00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:29,287\n>> Liars.\n\n453\n00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:34,630\n>> I back up my system every night.\n\n454\n00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,200\n>> In some cases yes you could\ndo a backup of a system.\n\n455\n00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,450\nThat may be entirely appropriate to do.\n\n456\n00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:46,141\n>> But, remember if you do a backup\nof a system, what are you getting?\n\n457\n00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:48,281\nJust the files that are on that system.\n\n458\n00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:50,881\nYou're not getting anything\nthat someone may have deleted.\n\n459\n00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:53,789\nYour not going to get into that stuff\nwhere you can do file carving on,\n\n460\n00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:56,850\nwhich we talked about yesterday and\nwe've got coming up again.\n\n461\n00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,720\nThat's not coming with that backup.\n\n462\n00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,040\nSo if that's where your evidence is,\nyou don't have it.\n\n463\n00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,440\nSo part of your case could be compromised.\n\n464\n00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,470\nYou'll have to go back and\nget it and hopefully that system is\n\n465\n00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,060\nstill available to you and is still in\na state where you can extract that.\n\n466\n00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,480\n>> Right.\n>> But don't let that shy you away.\n\n467\n00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,130\nIf you're gonna do a backup\nyou definitely can do it.\n\n468\n00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:27,270\nThe other ones we have for images, there's\nsuch thing when we talk about images,\n\n469\n00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,561\nthe big one that we use a lot in here\nis what they call a bit stream image.\n\n470\n00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:35,350\nA bit stream image is a very\nfinely detailed image of a drive.\n\n471\n00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,560\nIt's literally,\nit says right in the title, bit stream,\n\n472\n00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,580\nit's getting the individual\nbits off the drive.\n\n473\n00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,460\nIt's going down to that level which\nmeans it will capture everything.\n\n474\n00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,940\nThose deleted files,\nthe files that are obviously still there,\n\n475\n00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,320\nplus any other things that are on there.\n\n476\n00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,020\nSo, it means it's possible to do some\nof those file recovery and carving and\n\n477\n00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,360\nstuff like that with it.\n\n478\n00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,400\n>> It's kind of funny cuz in the IT world,\n\n479\n00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,140\nwe've actually kind of moved\naway from that, right?\n\n480\n00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,692\nAnd when we talk about doing\nbackups in the IT world,\n\n481\n00:25:03,692 --> 00:25:07,810\nwe had our bit stream images that they got\neverything, but they took forever to get.\n\n482\n00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,450\nWe moved towards backups that\nwere more file oriented,\n\n483\n00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,860\nlike Windows has their Windows\nimaging format, and things like that.\n\n484\n00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,440\nIt sped everything up,\nmade it a lot faster.\n\n485\n00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,710\nThe forensics will lead that that's\nnot a good thing because we're\n\n486\n00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,090\nmissing a lot of the data\nthat's on that drive, right?\n\n487\n00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,890\nThe operating system\ndoesn't care about it.\n\n488\n00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,360\nIt's been deleted or\nremoved or what have you.\n\n489\n00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,040\nSo that's fine if I'm just doing a backup\nto restore a system but if I'm doing this\n\n490\n00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,460\nforensically, I need every single one and\nzero on that drive that I can get.\n\n491\n00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,330\nAnd that's where that bit stream\ntechnology comes in, right?\n\n492\n00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,230\nIt's just streaming out ones and\nzeroes right off the drive.\n\n493\n00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,340\nIt doesn't care where one file starts and\nthe next file ends or anything like that.\n\n494\n00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,880\nIf it's deleted, or what have you,\nyou're getting everything.\n\n495\n00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,500\n>> Yeah, it all depends.\n\n496\n00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,300\nYou remember way back,\nwe talked about setting goals.\n\n497\n00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,964\nThat's going to be a part of this,\n\n498\n00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:57,109\ndetermining which imaging\nformat you can use.\n\n499\n00:25:57,109 --> 00:26:00,970\nAnd then it's also going to be, what\nyou would expect to get off that system\n\n500\n00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,463\nknowing what the person was doing,\nwhat the nature of the crime is or\n\n501\n00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:08,103\nthe incident is then, it's going to\ndetermine which one may be best.\n\n502\n00:26:08,103 --> 00:26:12,660\nIt may be totally fine to\ndo a file level image.\n\n503\n00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,880\nThere may be nothing wrong\nwith that whatsoever, but,\n\n504\n00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,235\nyou know, know the limitations that,\nyes, you're not going to get\n\n505\n00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:22,955\nthose little remnants that have\nbeen flagged for deletion.\n\n506\n00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:27,865\nThose are outside the vision\nof that imaging format where\n\n507\n00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:32,298\na bit stream will take longer,\nwill capture that information.\n\n508\n00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:39,185\nNow unfortunately also by the way,\nwe're familiar with stuff like Ghost.\n\n509\n00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:42,310\nDoes bit stream images.\n\n510\n00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,600\nIt has for a long time.\n\n511\n00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,880\nIn fact, it has since the beginning.\n\n512\n00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,790\n>> It's one of the reasons I moved away\nfrom it was because it did that bit\n\n513\n00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,795\nstream imaging and I didn't want that.\n\n514\n00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:52,540\n[LAUGH] But\nforensically it's a much better option.\n\n515\n00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,410\n>> It could be one option to at least I\nmean there's other ones, there's D D and\n\n516\n00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:04,760\nthen the other one, D D I got the other\nalphabet soup right now that we have for\n\n517\n00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,610\nLinux, that's another\noption that's out there.\n\n518\n00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,530\nThere are plenty of imaging formats,\nthere's free disc imagers and\n\n519\n00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:16,920\na lot of them use that bit by bit format,\nbut.\n\n520\n00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,610\n>> Paragon.\n\n521\n00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,940\nWe use paragon around here a lot of\ntimes when we need to get that level\n\n522\n00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,450\nof an image as well.\n\n523\n00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:27,080\n>> Yeah, you have those but\nyou also those things have a certain\n\n524\n00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,890\nlimitations on speed that's\n>> One of the frustrating\n\n525\n00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,556\nthings, like you said.\n\n526\n00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:32,860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're sitting there going,\n\n527\n00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,640\nis it ready.\n\n528\n00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,430\nThe new version of the system's come out,\nthat type of thing in IT, and\n\n529\n00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,900\nwe looked at it.\n\n530\n00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,700\nFor forensics, fortunately they've\nkind of cut us some slack.\n\n531\n00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,240\nThey have tools that you can,\nby Logic Cube and stuff like that,\n\n532\n00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,110\nyou can plug the drive into.\n\n533\n00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:52,920\nAnd it will do it faster, don't expect\nit to be you know, like that but\n\n534\n00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,680\nit will be faster and if you're fortunate\nenough to get something like that,\n\n535\n00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,380\nhey you know, cool.\n\n536\n00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,270\nIf you're processing a lot of drives,\nand you're doing a lot of cases\n\n537\n00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,650\nthat's gonna be a time saver,\neven though those devices like that,\n\n538\n00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,540\nthose hardware devices,\nare expensive to invest in.\n\n539\n00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:14,520\nThey are definitely worth it in the time\nthat you'll save making images and\n\n540\n00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,600\nduplicating images.\n\n541\n00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,820\n>> Especially with today's machines and\ntoday's hard drives.\n\n542\n00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,020\nWe're not talking about 500 megabyte\ndrives anymore or anything like that.\n\n543\n00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,390\nWe're talking about Terabytes of drive\nspace typically that we have to image.\n\n544\n00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:30,640\n>> Some of these things are talking that\nthey can transfer three gigs a minute.\n\n545\n00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,450\nIt's a pretty good speed but then you put\nit in the context of what you just said,\n\n546\n00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,410\nthat's not something that's\ngonna be done In a few minutes.\n\n547\n00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,890\nWe're gonna come back in a couple hours,\n\n548\n00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:44,520\nand if you're lucky it's gonna be done\n>> Or the next day.\n\n549\n00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,220\n>> Yeah, there's the one.\n\n550\n00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,230\nDebra.\nDCF LDD.\n\n551\n00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,820\nThat's the other one.\n\n552\n00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,400\nThat's DD's companion.\n\n553\n00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,960\nYou can use DD or you can use DCFLDD.\n\n554\n00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,770\nThe one that Debra's put\nup there is the one that's\n\n555\n00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,720\nactually accepted as\nbeing forensically sound.\n\n556\n00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,580\nSo you can use either, but\n\n557\n00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,310\nthat's the one that gives you\nlittle more of a safety net.\n\n558\n00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:07,940\n>> Very good.\n\n559\n00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,790\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen\nlooking at our clock it's about time for\n\n560\n00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,350\nus to step away and take a break.\n\n561\n00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,590\nSo stay tuned.\n\n562\n00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,661\nWe'll be right back with more\ndigital forensic investigator.\n\n563\n00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:25,200\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n564\n00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,740\nSo we left off talking about backup types.\n\n565\n00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,540\nWe talked about a backup\nversus a bit stream image.\n\n566\n00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,660\nNext thing we wanna dive into we\nhinted at a little bit earlier,\n\n567\n00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:39,610\nwhat is the difference between a logical\nversus a sparse image collection?\n\n568\n00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,810\nWhat are we talking about there Sean?\n\n569\n00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,690\n>> Yeah, that's the thing, is that\nyou are going to at some point also\n\n570\n00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,980\nhave to make another decision on top of\nwhether you're going to do a backup or\n\n571\n00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,120\na bit stream image, or\na file based image for that matter.\n\n572\n00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,600\nYou can do the logical versus sparse.\n\n573\n00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,540\nA logical more likely is gonna be\nsomething along the lines of a file-based\n\n574\n00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,910\nimage where you're just grabbing\nthe file structure and all that, so\n\n575\n00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,980\nit kinda makes sense.\n\n576\n00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,660\nA sparse image collection means you're\ngetting a little bit less than that.\n\n577\n00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,080\nYou're not even getting the whole drive.\n\n578\n00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,330\nReason why you might see that, is if\nyou're going off of shared storage or\n\n579\n00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,150\nsomething, you're not going\nto grab all the data.\n\n580\n00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,480\nYou don't have a warrant for\nthat presumably if you're talking that.\n\n581\n00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,000\nIf it's something like a, let's just\nsay for kicks, it's like an ISP.\n\n582\n00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,380\nAnd they've got the target of your or\n\n583\n00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,520\nthe subject of your investigation,\nthey have their investigation there, but\n\n584\n00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,860\nthen there's also other\ntenants in that same place.\n\n585\n00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,625\nYou can't grab that and if you do,\n\n586\n00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,945\nyou already know that there's other\nguidelines you gotta adhere to.\n\n587\n00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:51,225\nIf you accidentally happen to grab too\nmuch and grab someone else's stuff,\n\n588\n00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:56,310\nthen you have all these privacy things\nthat you have to adhere to, but,\n\n589\n00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:00,160\nin any case, a sparse image means\nyour grabbing something less.\n\n590\n00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,540\nYou're grabbing selected files or selected\nchunk of data out of a larger whole.\n\n591\n00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,450\n>> Okay.\n\n592\n00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,570\nSometimes we have to do that then.\n\n593\n00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,060\nEspecially in the case of,\nyou know, cloud changes a lot.\n\n594\n00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,790\nWe gotta worry about\nmulti-tenant scenarios.\n\n595\n00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:19,000\nEven in house, like you said,\nwith the file server, maybe we\n\n596\n00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,360\ncan't access all of the information, or\nshouldn't be grabbing all the information,\n\n597\n00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,985\nwe have to do more of\na sparse image capture.\n\n598\n00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:29,800\n>> Yeah, it's gonna be a choice that\nyou're gonna have to make not a choice,\n\n599\n00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:35,223\nbut you'll know going in\n>> Based on the parameters you've been\n\n600\n00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:41,107\ngiven, the goals that you've set,\nyou'll know if you only have, or\n\n601\n00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:46,310\nare only allowed to grab a small\nportion of that information.\n\n602\n00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:51,311\nSo, that's where sparse image comes in,\nis that you're\n\n603\n00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:56,630\ngrabbing a chunk, but\nnot the whole portion of information.\n\n604\n00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,039\n>> So a few a different tool or\n\n605\n00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:02,264\nmethodologies that we have to think about\nwhen we are doing our, what we call,\n\n606\n00:32:02,264 --> 00:32:06,489\nstatic data acquisition or as Shawn puts\nit, you know, off of a dense system,\n\n607\n00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:10,350\nsomething like that, well we're just\ntrying to grab an image of this.\n\n608\n00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,100\n>> Now we get to dive into\nlive data acquisition.\n\n609\n00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,330\nNow we are talking about\na system that's up and running.\n\n610\n00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,660\nSo we've got to change our procedures,\nwe've got to change the tools we use\n\n611\n00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,850\nbecause as live,\nthat makes a big difference right?\n\n612\n00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:30,670\n>> Yeah, when a system's live you\ndon't just dive right into an image.\n\n613\n00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,020\nIf you remember when you, you know,\n\n614\n00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:37,130\nearlier on we talked about\norders of volatility.\n\n615\n00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,470\nIf you've got a live system,\n\n616\n00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,530\nyou don't just turn it off and\nstart running your imaging tools.\n\n617\n00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,250\nThat would be a really bad\ndecision on your part.\n\n618\n00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:45,800\n>> Foolish.\n\n619\n00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,545\n>> Yes.\n\n620\n00:32:46,545 --> 00:32:49,940\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nyou don't just start doing that.\n\n621\n00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,670\nWhat you wanna do is you wanna start\nconsidering your orders of volatility, and\n\n622\n00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,600\nthen you also wanna\nconsider the importance and\n\n623\n00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,760\nreliability of that information.\n\n624\n00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,810\nSo, you know, when you consider those,\n\n625\n00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,630\nit's more than likely that you're\nimaging is gonna be in there.\n\n626\n00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,790\nBut it's gonna be lower down in the stack\nthen, say, looking at what processes\n\n627\n00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:16,010\nare running or you know, what users and\nconnections you might have to assist them.\n\n628\n00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,950\nSo that's kinda what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n629\n00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:24,140\nAnd there's a wealth of information\nyou can capture live off a system.\n\n630\n00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,920\nA lot of it.\n\n631\n00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,250\nIs gonna be stuff that's in memory but\nthen we're also looking at network\n\n632\n00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:35,060\nconnections and people that\nare currently connected to that system.\n\n633\n00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:40,770\nWe're trying to capture all that as\nmuch as possible or as we need to.\n\n634\n00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,130\nFormation, caches, stuff like that.\n\n635\n00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,520\n>> Oh yeah, that stuff could be lost,\nyou know, those temp files and\n\n636\n00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,070\nstuff like that.\n\n637\n00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,140\nYeah, some of those\nthings do get cleaned up.\n\n638\n00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,160\nYou know, not all of it and\n\n639\n00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,220\none of the ones we should start\nthinking about is, the page file.\n\n640\n00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,830\nThe page file doesn't always\nget cleaned up in Windows.\n\n641\n00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,620\nYou have to actually set that\nup to be to be purged or\n\n642\n00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:12,260\nnot to be resized, or it's all right to be\nrewritten, it doesn't blank a page file.\n\n643\n00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,480\nSo, you, so, that gives it\ninteresting possibility there.\n\n644\n00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,750\n>> And we should at this point\nremember what a page file is,\n\n645\n00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,090\njust in case we'll refresh, right.\n\n646\n00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,300\nThe page file,\nthe swap file that temporary memory.\n\n647\n00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,155\nThis is where the operating system, if\nI've got too much, you know, I'm trying to\n\n648\n00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:31,070\nmultitask too much and I don't have\nenough memory, it can temporarily boost\n\n649\n00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,270\nup out of memory into that page, free up\nsome memory space for something else.\n\n650\n00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,750\nAnd then, it has to swap that data back\nand forth between RAM and that hard drive.\n\n651\n00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,230\nAnd so when I shut that system down\nthere could be some stuff left.\n\n652\n00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,880\nI'm sorry,\nI don't want to shut that system down.\n\n653\n00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,180\nBut, well even on a system that's shut\ndown is what we're talking about too.\n\n654\n00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,600\nThere still could be some data in that\npage file because, as Shawn said,\n\n655\n00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,810\nit doesn't automatically just wipe the\npage file when you shut the system down.\n\n656\n00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,120\nIts temp memory will override it the next\ntime you power the system up and\n\n657\n00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,920\nturn it back on.\n\n658\n00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,410\nSo definitely there could\nbe some information there.\n\n659\n00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:07,300\nYeah, the paging file, yeah doesn't by\ndefault get purged when the system's\n\n660\n00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,830\nturned off, because if it did the system's\ngonna take a lot longer to turn off.\n\n661\n00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,710\nSo they typically don't do that,\n\n662\n00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:18,560\nwell people typically don't do that\njust because they don't wanna have that.\n\n663\n00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,020\nNow if you're working in an environment\nthat considers security more of an issue\n\n664\n00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,960\nthan how fast it takes to shut a system\ndown then you might go ahead and\n\n665\n00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,540\nset that little switch\nin Windows that says\n\n666\n00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,660\nclean out the page file but that's not the\nnorm, that's the exception to the rule.\n\n667\n00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,720\n>> We've talked about\nthis several episodes and\n\n668\n00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,810\nthese classes, and some of our\nother episodes for certifications.\n\n669\n00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,270\n>> Security convenience, right?\n\n670\n00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,010\nIt's a sliding system.\n\n671\n00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,860\nI move towards that convenience, I wanna\nbe able to shut that system down fast,\n\n672\n00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,740\nclose it up, walk away, versus security.\n\n673\n00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,420\nRight?\nThey don't mix.\n\n674\n00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,170\nSo, we got a few things.\n\n675\n00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,010\nSo, with live data acquisition now,\nas you said, our hard drive or\n\n676\n00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,250\nour imaging moves down on\nour list of priorities.\n\n677\n00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,600\nBecause on a static system it's up\nat the top because it's all I have.\n\n678\n00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,740\nWhereas with a live system theres other\nstuff that's more volatile that's going\n\n679\n00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,940\nto be higher up on my list of priorities\nso it doesn't mean that we're not\n\n680\n00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,550\ngoing to do the hard drive imaging\nit's just moved down on our list.\n\n681\n00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,210\nYes.\n\n682\n00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,451\nIt's been bumped down a bit, so\n\n683\n00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:27,640\nwe're typically gonna focus on\nother things ahead of that.\n\n684\n00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,950\nYou might decide that there's nothing in\nmemory or whatever you actually need,\n\n685\n00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:35,150\nbut don't just assume that oh, well I'm\ngonna go dive right into this other stuff.\n\n686\n00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,550\nOrders of volatility.\n\n687\n00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,950\nIf you don't consider that,\n\n688\n00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:43,050\nyou're gonna do something like run into\na system that's part of an incident.\n\n689\n00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,710\nAnd turn it off and start doing the stuff\nand you're going to realize that,\n\n690\n00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,510\noops, there was something I wanted.\n\n691\n00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,090\n>> Too late now.\n\n692\n00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,670\n>> Yes, too late, it's gone.\n\n693\n00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,510\n>> Alright, so\n\n694\n00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:57,450\nwhat are some of the things we can\nuse to do our live data acquisition.\n\n695\n00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,380\n>> Okay, we've got a lot of tools.\n\n696\n00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,320\nAll the tools here if you\nguys have downloaded WSCC\n\n697\n00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,290\nthe Windows system control center.\n\n698\n00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,560\nI think I got that right.\n\n699\n00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,685\nIf not, just play along.\n\n700\n00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:14,140\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> What we're doing is we're gonna look at\n\n701\n00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:18,180\nsome live data at this point and\nI'm gonna.\n\n702\n00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,530\nI'm gonna do it on a Windows box.\n\n703\n00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:24,950\nThere are equivalents on the Linux side of\nthe house, and on the Mac OS and all that.\n\n704\n00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,120\nSo I'm just gonna keep it simple and\nuse some of these, and\n\n705\n00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,560\nuse the tools that are on the Windows\nside, since more than likely we all have\n\n706\n00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,090\naccess to that, or the majority of\nus will have access to Windows.\n\n707\n00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:34,780\nBut again,\n\n708\n00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,740\nyou're not left out in the cold if you're\nin one of the other operating systems.\n\n709\n00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,620\nThey are, you know, out there.\n\n710\n00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,020\nAs a good forensic investigator\nwe should play with all of them.\n\n711\n00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,100\n>> Yes you should be\nfamiliar with all of them or\n\n712\n00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:52,930\nthe ones that are relevant\nto you at the very least.\n\n713\n00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,600\nSo when you're collecting live data though\nlet's talk about something that is going\n\n714\n00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,610\nto be universal across the board.\n\n715\n00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,460\nOne of the things that's gonna be\nuniversal is when you're collecting live\n\n716\n00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:09,690\ndata you have to have to get an idea,\nor should say beyond get an idea.\n\n717\n00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,780\nYou have to verify what the current\ndate and time in the system is.\n\n718\n00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,550\nAnd the reason for\n\n719\n00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,925\nthat is because we have to have something\nto verify when that data was collected.\n\n720\n00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:21,615\nSo you can say this is\nthe date of the system and\n\n721\n00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:25,375\nthen this is something I collected and\nlook it's the same date and\n\n722\n00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:29,097\nit was taken only a few seconds after\nthat date was run so it wasn't.\n\n723\n00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:30,427\nBecause of something\nthat I did down the road,\n\n724\n00:38:30,427 --> 00:38:32,617\nthere was something that\nI did right at that time.\n\n725\n00:38:32,617 --> 00:38:34,967\nSo any time you run an operation,\n\n726\n00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:39,717\nyou should perform an operation before it\nthat says, here's the time on the system.\n\n727\n00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:43,928\nAnd get that verified, so it's not\nnot question when you collected it.\n\n728\n00:38:43,928 --> 00:38:44,758\n>> Yeah, okay.\n\n729\n00:38:44,758 --> 00:38:46,618\n>> Now how do you do that?\n\n730\n00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:48,808\nIt's gonna vary on the operating system.\n\n731\n00:38:48,808 --> 00:38:52,038\nI'm not even gonna worry about\nshowing that step here, cuz I'll,\n\n732\n00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,328\nIt's a very simple command, you could look\nat how to do it on any operating system,\n\n733\n00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:58,718\nso I won't worry about that.\n\n734\n00:38:58,718 --> 00:39:03,418\nBut once you've done that then you\ngotta decide which tools to run\n\n735\n00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,240\nto collect the information you need.\n\n736\n00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,760\nNow the WSCC has some of those tools for\nus.\n\n737\n00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,400\nYou know things you might want to collect\nfor example a configuration of the system.\n\n738\n00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,700\nThe configuration of the system that\nwill tell us the obvious stuff.\n\n739\n00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,480\nTell us how the system's actually set up.\n\n740\n00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,920\nBut we do have other things\nlike a process list.\n\n741\n00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:36,260\nIf we, I've got running on my desktop\nhere, I've got the WESC up now.\n\n742\n00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,450\nYou can see on the Sysinternals suite,\nwhich is actually great for\n\n743\n00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,770\nwhat we're doing.\n\n744\n00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,830\nSysinternals suite has so\nmany different tools in it.\n\n745\n00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,070\nBut also Nearsoft has it as well.\n\n746\n00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,110\nBut like I showed you the other day,\n\n747\n00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,721\nsince both these suites have\ngreat tools with some crossover.\n\n748\n00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:55,641\nJust get this, it keeps it nice and\nsimple for you.\n\n749\n00:39:55,641 --> 00:39:58,632\nSo, what you have is you can do the tools,\n\n750\n00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:04,290\nthis is one of the ones that internals\nactually makes available to us.\n\n751\n00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,210\nWe can run it and it should be\ndoing a quick process dump for me.\n\n752\n00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,180\nDid it do it?\nThere we go around the background,\n\n753\n00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,300\noh then do with that one.\n\n754\n00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,610\nWhere is it?\nDid it bring it?\n\n755\n00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:25,390\nOkay it wants me to run the switches for\nthat and I don't want to type stuff in.\n\n756\n00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,740\nI don't want to show you guys\nhow bad of a typist I am.\n\n757\n00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,655\nI'll run this other one.\n\n758\n00:40:28,655 --> 00:40:29,240\n[LAUGH].\n\n759\n00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,490\n>> That looks a little nicer anyway.\n\n760\n00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,205\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n761\n00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:33,907\n[CROSSTALK] Graphical alpha and\nI like that one.\n\n762\n00:40:33,907 --> 00:40:36,150\n>> Yeah.\n\n763\n00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,150\nThe other one does the same thing,\njust in a command line stuff.\n\n764\n00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,290\nBut yeah.\n\n765\n00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,125\nI'm, for someone that writes books,\nI'm incredibly bad at typing.\n\n766\n00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,850\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So anyway.\n\n767\n00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,470\n>> That's why it takes you\n2 years to put out a book.\n\n768\n00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:51,490\n>> Yeah, I'm writing version 10 of the CH\nright now because it take that long\n\n769\n00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,088\nto do it.\n\n770\n00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:54,248\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n771\n00:40:54,248 --> 00:40:58,480\n>> So, but if you look at what I've\ngot here, I mean this is a live.\n\n772\n00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,990\nSnapshot, which is also kinda cool too.\n\n773\n00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,480\nThis didn't install\nanything on the system.\n\n774\n00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,930\nWell in this case, let me back up,\nI did install the WSCC on this system.\n\n775\n00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,830\nBut remember,\n\n776\n00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:12,610\nwith the the other day, that we said\nthe WSCC can be run off a flash drive.\n\n777\n00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:17,840\nSo you have a portable version of\nit you can just pop right in there.\n\n778\n00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,180\n>> Yeah, probably good to mention that.\n\n779\n00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,950\nI'm sure you guys know, and\nwe talked about it several times, but\n\n780\n00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,590\nwe're not installing anything.\n\n781\n00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,970\nOn the target of our investigation.\n\n782\n00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,250\nWe're not installing these programs and\nrunning them.\n\n783\n00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,990\nWe're doing it through a live disc row or\nsomething like that,\n\n784\n00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,520\nlike off a thumb drive or something.\n\n785\n00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,865\nAnd then we need something we\ncan capture this information,\n\n786\n00:41:36,865 --> 00:41:38,515\ntry to save it for us or.\n\n787\n00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:40,835\n>> Yeah.\nYou do need something that captures this.\n\n788\n00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:43,385\nNow, the command line,\nyou're going to have to get used\n\n789\n00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,035\nto your old DOS commands where you\nrun the thing with switches and\n\n790\n00:41:47,035 --> 00:41:49,695\nthen the little switch and\nall that to output it to a file.\n\n791\n00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:51,095\nYou're going to have to do that.\n\n792\n00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:55,955\nSo the benefit of something like this\nis why this does show you this nice\n\n793\n00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:57,210\ngraphical format.\n\n794\n00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,130\nIt also has,\nover here it has an icon available.\n\n795\n00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,360\nWe can actually save\nwhat we see on screen.\n\n796\n00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,370\nWe can save that to a text file.\n\n797\n00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:08,780\nAnd so we've got it saved anyway.\n\n798\n00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,080\nSo this is one thing\nyou're gonna wanna get.\n\n799\n00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,440\nSo it tells you what specifically\nrunning a memory at this point and time.\n\n800\n00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,630\nSo if I just had just walked up to\nthe system I pop in my flash drive and\n\n801\n00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:25,900\nI take a snapshot of the time and\ndate on the system and then run this.\n\n802\n00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,790\nAnd boom, I've got the stuff that's\nrunning at this point and time.\n\n803\n00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:34,891\nSo I've got one task taken care of.\n\n804\n00:42:34,891 --> 00:42:35,713\n>> Right.\n\n805\n00:42:35,713 --> 00:42:36,890\nWe're going down our check list.\n\n806\n00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:37,630\nWe're checking that one off.\n\n807\n00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,500\nAll right.\nI got my current processes running on\n\n808\n00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,840\nthis system.\n\n809\n00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,370\n>> Yes.\nYeah.\n\n810\n00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:44,130\nSo that's definitely one\nof the first things.\n\n811\n00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,840\nAnd you might take a quick\nglance through this list.\n\n812\n00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,450\nWhy you are here,\n\n813\n00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:57,420\njust to see if it tips you off on\nany next steps you might wanna take.\n\n814\n00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,170\nYou might already have a checklist, and\n\n815\n00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,610\nyou should have a checklist of\nstuff you're going through, or\n\n816\n00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:05,380\nat least have a good idea in your mind the\norder you're gonna run these things in.\n\n817\n00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:11,200\nBut you may look at this and decide,\nwell there's something I see,\n\n818\n00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,420\na process I see running here that,\n\n819\n00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:19,000\nindicates to me that there may be some\nnetwork connections I need to examine or\n\n820\n00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,890\nother things loaded in that\nI need to take a look at.\n\n821\n00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,810\nI see there James brings up a question,\nhe says,\n\n822\n00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,475\nwill installing a flash drive\nalter the integrity of the system.\n\n823\n00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:28,408\nYeah.\n\n824\n00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:30,304\nWhat of it?\n\n825\n00:43:30,304 --> 00:43:35,940\n[LAUGH]\nIn all seriousness\n\n826\n00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:41,000\nit does alter the system yes\nthe drivers do have to get\n\n827\n00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,100\nloaded onto there and it does do stuff to\nthe registry so it is making changes but\n\n828\n00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:50,990\nyou can just for safeties sake\nahead of time have plugged that\n\n829\n00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:54,450\nflash drive into a known system and\nget a record of the serial number and\n\n830\n00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:58,160\nstuff like that to verify\nthat's the device you have.\n\n831\n00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,330\nSo you can plug it in, and\nwhen you plug into that system and\n\n832\n00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:04,860\nyou're doing a registry analysis of it,\nyou can show that hey, that's my device.\n\n833\n00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:08,050\nHere's a record on another\nsystem showing that same device.\n\n834\n00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,970\nSo now you've kind of singled that out.\n\n835\n00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,300\n>> So that way you can prove that yes\nthis is when I took this capture and\n\n836\n00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,140\nthis is the driver that got installed and\nthis is me doing that so that I can\n\n837\n00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,390\nhopefully eliminate any question\nthat may come up in a court of law.\n\n838\n00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,050\nYeah exactly.\n\n839\n00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:32,060\nSo you wanna make sure that, yeah,\nthere's no ambiguity there whatsoever.\n\n840\n00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,630\nSo, yeah, you can do that by,\nrunning it someplace else,\n\n841\n00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,950\nthen you can go ahead and eliminate it.\n\n842\n00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:44,250\nOkay, now once we've done\nsomething like a process list.\n\n843\n00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:50,760\nSomething else we can do is to list,\nin the Windows system, we can list DLL's.\n\n844\n00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,180\nAnd DLL's, dynamic link libraries,\nare something to get loaded and\n\n845\n00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,510\nrun with applications on the system.\n\n846\n00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:02,810\nSo what's happening here is I just\nran part of the Sysinternals kit\n\n847\n00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,930\nthat's called list DLL's.\n\n848\n00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,992\nI know, catchy name right?\n\n849\n00:45:06,992 --> 00:45:07,644\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n850\n00:45:07,644 --> 00:45:10,188\n>> Really kind of narrows\nit down what it does.\n\n851\n00:45:10,188 --> 00:45:13,100\n>> Yes.\n>> But what list DLL does just does\n\n852\n00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,360\na process I just told you about.\n\n853\n00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,060\nIt lists the DLL's that\nare currently loaded into memory.\n\n854\n00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,130\nRight now it's doing the quick.\n\n855\n00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,550\nI shouldn't say quick.\n\n856\n00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:26,730\nBut it's doing a check of what's in\nmemory and it will eventually spit\n\n857\n00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:31,970\nout a list of DLL's that\nare currently loaded in there.\n\n858\n00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,380\nSo, again same process.\n\n859\n00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,220\nYou might want to,\n\n860\n00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:38,740\nif you have had enough of a lapse in time,\nyou're gonna want to run a date check.\n\n861\n00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:43,630\nAnd then go ahead and\nrun this so you can see exactly,\n\n862\n00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:47,250\nyou know, what is being captured there.\n\n863\n00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,070\nSo yeah, this is taking a little more time\n\n864\n00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,590\nthan I typically expect but\n>> You got a lot of DLL's\n\n865\n00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,410\nin there don't ya?\n\n866\n00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> I'm just kidding.\n\n867\n00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,640\n>> I've been doing a lot of stuff man.\n\n868\n00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,290\nSo and that's the thing you never know.\n\n869\n00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,610\nI mean something like this.\n\n870\n00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:06,800\nI mean we're doing this live that could\n\n871\n00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,840\nbe the same way when your going into a and\na crime scene or a scene to investigate.\n\n872\n00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,680\nIt may not spit back the stuff right away.\n\n873\n00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,300\nThat system may have been running for\na while.\n\n874\n00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,330\nYou may have been doing\ndifferent things on there.\n\n875\n00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:22,720\nMaybe some big DLL's loaded up\nthere that has to enumerate and\n\n876\n00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,270\nfind out what's going on.\n\n877\n00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:27,770\nSo this will, when you leave this running,\nit will go ahead and\n\n878\n00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,510\nspit out a list of DLL's that\nare right on the system.\n\n879\n00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,080\n>> Yeah,\nthat's what you said several times,\n\n880\n00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,710\nthis is not for\nthe impatient person, right?\n\n881\n00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,490\nThis is time consuming stuff.\n\n882\n00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,590\nWe can't rush it,\nwe've gotta take our time, get it right.\n\n883\n00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:43,380\nAnd processes like this, imaging that\ndrive, can take a little while, and\n\n884\n00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,980\nthere's just nothing we\ncan really do about it.\n\n885\n00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,430\n>> Yeah, the forensics is one of those\nprofessions that yeah, it's not for\n\n886\n00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,640\nsomeone that's got an impatient nature,\nand needs stuff right away.\n\n887\n00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,080\nYeah.\nThere's a few jobs like that,\n\n888\n00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:54,880\nforensics is one.\n\n889\n00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,582\nI guess farming's another one.\n\n890\n00:46:56,582 --> 00:46:57,755\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> If you're in a rush,\n\n891\n00:46:57,755 --> 00:46:58,645\nfarming ain't for you.\n\n892\n00:46:58,645 --> 00:47:01,020\n>> [LAUGH] You know,\nI planted those tomatoes yesterday, and\n\n893\n00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,105\nI still have no tomatoes.\n\n894\n00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:03,430\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I wanted tomatoes with my\n\n895\n00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,250\nbreakfast this morning.\n\n896\n00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,210\nI don't get it.\n>> [LAUGH] You're sitting there smoking,\n\n897\n00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,030\ngrow, grow.\n\n898\n00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:07,549\nCome on, do it.\n\n899\n00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:08,064\n[LAUGH].\n\n900\n00:47:08,064 --> 00:47:08,580\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n901\n00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,970\n>> So, you can't have that, so.\n\n902\n00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:15,840\n>> Yeah you kind of get the idea of this\nis what’s happening here now this one.\n\n903\n00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,530\nIt’s still going ahead\ncranking away on this thing.\n\n904\n00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:20,350\nLet me.\n\n905\n00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,200\nWell.\n\n906\n00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,260\n>> Move on to a, let it run in the back\nground and we'll come check on it.\n\n907\n00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,430\n>> Yeah well come back and\nsee what’s its doing and\n\n908\n00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,620\nsee if it's actually finished or whatever.\n\n909\n00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,260\nBut.\n\n910\n00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,460\n>> So at this point we've\ndone a lot already, right.\n\n911\n00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,310\nWe've got the configuration off the,\nmaybe using system info or\n\n912\n00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,090\nsystem info on a Windows system.\n\n913\n00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:40,090\nOr whatever's available,\non a Linux or a Mac.\n\n914\n00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,340\nYou know getting that basic configuration,\nwhat does it have, what processes,\n\n915\n00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,270\nwhat memory.\n\n916\n00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:47,597\nHard drive space, drivers maybe\nthat are loaded up, other hardware,\n\n917\n00:47:47,597 --> 00:47:49,770\nadapters that are plugged\ninto that machine.\n\n918\n00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:53,830\nCapturing all that,\nkind of getting the state of that device.\n\n919\n00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,290\nListing out all of the processes\nusing something like.\n\n920\n00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:00,548\nWhat we've got there in the WSCC or\nany other tool that can go in and\n\n921\n00:48:00,548 --> 00:48:03,950\nlist the current processes that\nare running on that machine.\n\n922\n00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:07,680\nAnd remember, I saw a question I think in\nthe chat room, we're talking about live\n\n923\n00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,175\nsystems here so we can't yank out\nthat hard drive and do our image.\n\n924\n00:48:11,175 --> 00:48:14,280\nWe've got to deal with our\nvolatile evidence first,\n\n925\n00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,750\nanything that we might lose\nif we shut that system down.\n\n926\n00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,540\nAs we're listing out those processes,\n\n927\n00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,940\nmaybe ListDLL, which we got running now,\nto go through memory and\n\n928\n00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:29,060\nlist out all the DLLs that have been\nloaded up to see what we've got there.\n\n929\n00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:32,290\nOther things we might want to do or\nwe're gonna need to do when we do our\n\n930\n00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:35,980\nlive data acquisitions is, see what\nuser accounts are logged on, right?\n\n931\n00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,370\n>> Yeah, that would be another one\nthat you'd wanna take a look at is\n\n932\n00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:41,360\nwho may be currently\nlogged on that system.\n\n933\n00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,576\nRemember, we have operating\nsystems that are multiple user so\n\n934\n00:48:45,576 --> 00:48:48,210\nyou could have other people logged in.\n\n935\n00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:52,240\nAnd that's something that you're\ngonna wanna capture just in case.\n\n936\n00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,869\nAnd so we do have that sort of information\n\n937\n00:48:56,869 --> 00:49:02,187\nsitting in the WSCC and\nSysinternals as well.\n\n938\n00:49:02,187 --> 00:49:10,081\nAnd I'll do that for you kind of just\nto show you what's going on here.\n\n939\n00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:14,555\nDid I go through, oh I guess maybe,\nis it asking me for my license for\n\n940\n00:49:14,555 --> 00:49:17,020\nmy ListDLL, did I do that?\n\n941\n00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,483\nDid I not click on that?\n\n942\n00:49:18,483 --> 00:49:19,910\n>> Oh, good old Sysinternals.\n\n943\n00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,652\nClick that Accept button.\n\n944\n00:49:21,652 --> 00:49:22,767\n>> Psych-\n>> You like them,\n\n945\n00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:24,717\nI know you trust Sysinternals,\nyou can do it.\n\n946\n00:49:24,717 --> 00:49:26,554\n[LAUGH]\n>> Come on, we're Microsoft,\n\n947\n00:49:26,554 --> 00:49:27,132\nyou can trust us.\n\n948\n00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:28,154\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n949\n00:49:28,154 --> 00:49:33,670\n>> [LAUGH] Oh look, well,\nspeaking of something previous.\n\n950\n00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:41,500\nWell I didn't notice,\nI was too busy yacking away here.\n\n951\n00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,490\nLet me kind of scroll up.\n\n952\n00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,090\nBut it's still going, okay, there's-\n\n953\n00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:45,830\n>> It's chugging, yeah,\nit's thinking about it.\n\n954\n00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:46,920\n>> Yeah, it's still doing its thing.\n\n955\n00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,928\nYou can see it scrolled by here though.\n\n956\n00:49:49,928 --> 00:49:53,322\nYou can see as it's scrolling\nby it's showing DLLs,\n\n957\n00:49:53,322 --> 00:49:56,197\nstuff like that that\nare loaded into memory.\n\n958\n00:49:56,197 --> 00:50:02,373\nThat's about the extent of what this does,\nit's all it's suppose to do.\n\n959\n00:50:02,373 --> 00:50:06,221\nYou could see the DLLs actually loaded and\nsitting there, and\n\n960\n00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:09,050\nyou'd be capturing this to a file.\n\n961\n00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,680\nAnd so, once that's captured to a file,\nyou're good,\n\n962\n00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,990\nyou're done with that, you've got\nthe DLLs that are currently loaded.\n\n963\n00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:17,930\n>> Cuz those DLLs that are loaded up,\nthe information I can gather from that,\n\n964\n00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,200\nlike maybe what application they're using,\n\n965\n00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,560\nis the applications will call these DLLs,\nthings like that.\n\n966\n00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,530\nThey might have some custom\nDLLs that they've done\n\n967\n00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,780\nthat we want to take a peek at, and\nsee what they've done in there, right.\n\n968\n00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:34,060\n>> Well, here's another one to look at,\nyou're gonna talk about the DLL issue is,\n\n969\n00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:38,430\nwhat if you're doing something\nthat you suspect involves malware?\n\n970\n00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,950\nSo you could be going\nthrough that list and\n\n971\n00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:45,242\nyou might see stuff in there\nthat just doesn't belong.\n\n972\n00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:49,496\nBecause what you're going to go through\nis you're gonna go through that list and\n\n973\n00:50:49,496 --> 00:50:51,511\nlook at all the DLLs that are in there.\n\n974\n00:50:51,511 --> 00:50:53,738\nAnd you're gonna see if\nanything kinda stands out or\n\n975\n00:50:53,738 --> 00:50:57,200\ndo additional research on those\nthings to figure out what's what.\n\n976\n00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,130\nAnd then, if something just stands out,\ndoesn't belong there, or isn't the right\n\n977\n00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:05,460\nsize, or is doing something, then you\ncan do further investigation on it.\n\n978\n00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,925\nThat's where our reverse engineering and\nall that comes in,\n\n979\n00:51:07,925 --> 00:51:12,320\nis we have the system in hand,\ntake the image that we get later on.\n\n980\n00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:17,450\nRun it through something like IDA Pro or\nOllyDbg or something like that, and\n\n981\n00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:21,540\nsee if you can pull any strings or\nanything like that and\n\n982\n00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:26,020\ndetermine what's going on and\nwhat the nature of that specific DLL is.\n\n983\n00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:30,711\nBut, we can't do that without starting\nsomething like this, or it's a lot\n\n984\n00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:35,424\nharder to do that type of investigation\nwithout doing something like this.\n\n985\n00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:36,701\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n986\n00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:40,422\n>> I did see in here, by the way,\nwas it someone that says about,\n\n987\n00:51:40,422 --> 00:51:42,436\nI guess I just scroll off the top.\n\n988\n00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:46,244\nSomeone asking about would doing any\nof this alert an attacker to what\n\n989\n00:51:46,244 --> 00:51:47,620\nyou're doing?\n\n990\n00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:52,137\nYeah, if you did it when they were there,\nand presumably you're not.\n\n991\n00:51:52,137 --> 00:51:53,240\nYou've gotten to-\n>> Yeah,\n\n992\n00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,850\nit kinda depends on the scenario, right.\n\n993\n00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:57,660\nAt this point we're thinking\nprobably the most common\n\n994\n00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,580\nis I'm at this person's cubicle, we've\nalready moved them out of the way, or\n\n995\n00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,720\nthey're on vacation if it's\na corporate type thing.\n\n996\n00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,380\nIf it's a criminal investigation,\nwe've been called in after, remember,\n\n997\n00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,120\nwe're not CSI,\nwe're not busting down the doors.\n\n998\n00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,568\nWe've been called in after\nthe cops have cleared the scene,\n\n999\n00:52:12,568 --> 00:52:15,630\nthey've found a computer,\nthey've brought us in.\n\n1000\n00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,985\nIf they were connecting remotely\nmaybe from somewhere else,\n\n1001\n00:52:18,985 --> 00:52:23,790\nthat could potentially alert them\nthat they were being investigated.\n\n1002\n00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,890\nBut I think that's probably a chance\nthat we've got to take at this point,\n\n1003\n00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,810\ngather as much information before, cuz if\nthey're connecting remotely they might be\n\n1004\n00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,830\ntrying to wipe evidence, remove evidence.\n\n1005\n00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:33,410\nWe've got to get in there and\ncapture that.\n\n1006\n00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:37,260\n>> Yeah, they might very well be\ntrying to do something like that.\n\n1007\n00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,310\nThat's why one of the things\nthat we've got to look\n\n1008\n00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:45,890\nat there on the system is who's logged in\nas well as what connections are active.\n\n1009\n00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:48,435\nAnd you should be,\nif someone could log in remotely,\n\n1010\n00:52:48,435 --> 00:52:52,165\nyou should be doing whatever you can to\nshut down that connection if you suspect\n\n1011\n00:52:52,165 --> 00:52:56,385\nthat that's the case, that someone's\ntrying to pull that type of nonsense.\n\n1012\n00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:57,605\n>> Not shut the machine down, right?\n\n1013\n00:52:57,605 --> 00:53:00,288\nWe talked about if it's on,\nleave it on, if it's off, leave it off.\n\n1014\n00:53:00,288 --> 00:53:03,714\nBut maybe somehow stop that connection\nthat they've got into the machine so\n\n1015\n00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:05,651\nwe can prevent them from doing any damage.\n\n1016\n00:53:05,651 --> 00:53:09,620\n>> Yeah and remember, something else\nyou can do, you've got this stuff like\n\n1017\n00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:13,720\nthe Sysinternals Suite that a lot\nof these things are command line.\n\n1018\n00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,540\nYeah, they're command line,\nso guess what you can do?\n\n1019\n00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:19,660\nYou can script them so you could,\nin theory, plug a flash drive\n\n1020\n00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:23,040\ninto a system when someone goes down to\nthe restroom or goes to get coffee or\n\n1021\n00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,010\nsomething, plug the thing in, and have\nit extract the information very quickly.\n\n1022\n00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:34,130\nOr you could do it right there if\nyou can play it off well enough,\n\n1023\n00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:37,690\nsay you need to install new drivers on\nthe system or something like that when\n\n1024\n00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:42,500\nthe person's there, and plug the thing\nin and act you're loading drivers.\n\n1025\n00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,980\nHave this running in the background, just\ngrabbing the stuff and dumping it back.\n\n1026\n00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,150\nI mean,\nyou could do those sorts of things.\n\n1027\n00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:49,900\nSometimes you're gonna\nhave to get creative,\n\n1028\n00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,030\nand that may be how you get creative.\n\n1029\n00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,700\n>> All right, well, ladies and\ngentlemen, looking at the clock,\n\n1030\n00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,950\nit's about time for us to step away and\ntake another break.\n\n1031\n00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:00,747\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back with\nmore Digital Forensic Investigator.\n\n1032\n00:54:00,747 --> 00:54:07,481\n[SOUND].\n\n1033\n00:54:07,481 --> 00:54:09,663\nAll right welcome back ladies and\ngentleman.\n\n1034\n00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:14,505\nSo we left off talking about\nacquiring data off of a live system.\n\n1035\n00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:17,257\nAnd we went through and listed,\nwe got our system configuration for\n\n1036\n00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:18,560\nusing something like SysInfo,\n\n1037\n00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,310\nand of course, there's many other\ntools for different operating systems.\n\n1038\n00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:25,420\nWe took a look at listing all the\nprocesses that were currently running on\n\n1039\n00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,290\nthat system,\n\n1040\n00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:30,202\nas well as looking at the DLLs that\nwere currently loaded up on that system.\n\n1041\n00:54:30,202 --> 00:54:34,450\nSo the next thing we want to do, Sean,\nstart listing out maybe who's accessing\n\n1042\n00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:37,030\nthat system, who's currently using it or\nwho has been using it?\n\n1043\n00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:41,430\n>> Yes, that's one of the next steps\nthat we can go ahead and take.\n\n1044\n00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:47,768\nWhat I've done to make this a little\neasier here for us is I've gone ahead and\n\n1045\n00:54:47,768 --> 00:54:53,670\nalready ran one of the Sysinternals tools,\nthe PsLoggedOn tool.\n\n1046\n00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:57,260\nAnd what it does, it's telling me that no,\nthis is my system here so\n\n1047\n00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,600\nI'm the only one logged into it.\n\n1048\n00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:03,340\nAnd you can see the system name and\nmy username on there,\n\n1049\n00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,330\nso it very quickly and\neasily tells me that.\n\n1050\n00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,650\nIf there were multiple people logged in\nhere, let's say I had Fast User Switching\n\n1051\n00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:13,990\nor something like that,\nI'd see a list of those users logged in.\n\n1052\n00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:17,490\nI could even see them if they were\nusing shares and stuff like that,\n\n1053\n00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:19,120\nI would possibly see that.\n\n1054\n00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,160\nIn fact, you should see that.\n\n1055\n00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,299\n>> I kinda see that one line that says\nno one is logged on via resource shares.\n\n1056\n00:55:26,299 --> 00:55:29,280\nSo at this point nobody's connecting\nto any shares on your system?\n\n1057\n00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,870\n>> Yeah, I don't have any evidence,\nat least through this I don't have any\n\n1058\n00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,790\nevidence of anyone\nactually engaging in that.\n\n1059\n00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:38,980\nSo this would be, again,\nsomething else I would\n\n1060\n00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:43,670\nshuffle off to a file and get stored.\n\n1061\n00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:47,410\nAnd keep in mind, we had a break-in there.\n\n1062\n00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,506\nIf you were doing this and\nyou had that sort of break, again,\n\n1063\n00:55:50,506 --> 00:55:54,090\nyou are running another date check\nbefore you do this to show that yes,\n\n1064\n00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:57,978\nwe've done a We're running this tool\nwhere this was the time in the system,\n\n1065\n00:55:57,978 --> 00:56:00,580\nthis is where we're running the tool.\n\n1066\n00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:06,260\nYou can see here even on the tool itself,\nthe tool itself will tell\n\n1067\n00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:11,810\nyou when it was run,\nright up there on the top line.\n\n1068\n00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,918\nSo we've got the tool verifying it,\n\n1069\n00:56:13,918 --> 00:56:18,616\nlet's correlate that with the system to\nmake sure that there's not much of a gap.\n\n1070\n00:56:18,616 --> 00:56:20,510\nWhen there are any gaps.\n\n1071\n00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,560\nAnd you gotta kinda use your best\njudgment on that too, by the way,\n\n1072\n00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,110\non when you should be taking that\nsnapshot, or that capture of the time,\n\n1073\n00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:31,070\nand then capture of when you ran the tool.\n\n1074\n00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,020\nso I...\n\n1075\n00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,750\n>> Right more is better in this case.\n\n1076\n00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,960\nI mean I can always throw some\nof them out if I need to but\n\n1077\n00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,840\nit's better to check the time\nmore often than less often.\n\n1078\n00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,450\n>> Yeah, you might just make it a habit\nof doing it before you run every tool.\n\n1079\n00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:48,710\nIt's a simple thing just run\nit maybe do a script and\n\n1080\n00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:53,480\njust boom boom run it have it make\nit out to a file and your done so,\n\n1081\n00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,790\nbut just remember there is a requirement\nthere to go ahead and do that.\n\n1082\n00:56:58,992 --> 00:57:02,690\n>> All right, so we list out all the users\nthat are either logged on to that system\n\n1083\n00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:06,530\nor possibly connecting to that system\nvia shares or some other method or\n\n1084\n00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:09,350\nat least what the operating system\nis showing me at this point.\n\n1085\n00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:11,940\nDepending on what tools I'm using, and\n\n1086\n00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,920\nwe also wanna take a look at what's\nrunning on that machine, right.\n\n1087\n00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,670\nMaybe what ports are open,\n\n1088\n00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:22,925\nwhat's it listening for, what services\nare actively listening with reports\n\n1089\n00:57:22,925 --> 00:57:26,585\nas well as applications that could\nbe running on those systems.\n\n1090\n00:57:26,585 --> 00:57:30,435\n>> Yeah, this is some exciting\nstuff we have here, is that,\n\n1091\n00:57:30,435 --> 00:57:35,605\nfirst of all we wanna see what's listening\nand what's connecting to the system.\n\n1092\n00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:37,705\nThat's where something\nlike Netstat comes in.\n\n1093\n00:57:37,705 --> 00:57:41,070\nRemember, Netstat is capturing a static\n\n1094\n00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:44,320\nview of what happened\nat that point in time.\n\n1095\n00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,260\nIf you think connection states have\nchanged or anything like that,\n\n1096\n00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,340\nthen you may have to rerun this.\n\n1097\n00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:54,100\nSo you could also, if you think you\ncan get away with it in your specific\n\n1098\n00:57:54,100 --> 00:58:01,210\nsituation, you can use TCPView as well,\nsomething that we saw in the CEH course.\n\n1099\n00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:05,164\nThat will show you a dynamic view and\na little more detailed view than this.\n\n1100\n00:58:05,164 --> 00:58:05,803\n>> I like that.\n\n1101\n00:58:05,803 --> 00:58:06,600\nThat's a good one.\n\n1102\n00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,780\n>> So you've got that kind\nof in your Toolkit as well.\n\n1103\n00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,470\nSo, I just ran this a few moments ago, so\n\n1104\n00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:18,240\nit doesn't necessarily reflect\nthe current state of the connections.\n\n1105\n00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,760\nIt might, but\nthen again it just as easily might not.\n\n1106\n00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,320\nI'm looking through this and\n\n1107\n00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,730\nI can see connections being made and\nI would just record this.\n\n1108\n00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,560\nThis is something for analysis.\n\n1109\n00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,810\nWho knows, maybe I'm gonna track down\nthe systems that had these at some\n\n1110\n00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,465\nof the addresses and\nsee what's going on there.\n\n1111\n00:58:35,465 --> 00:58:39,685\n>> Yeah you might see some remote access\nsome program, some backdoor utility that's\n\n1112\n00:58:39,685 --> 00:58:43,605\nsitting there waiting for the guy to\ncall back in or something like that.\n\n1113\n00:58:43,605 --> 00:58:45,785\nSo we gotta get a list of those.\n\n1114\n00:58:45,785 --> 00:58:48,445\nNetstat TCPView,\nthings like that we can use.\n\n1115\n00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:50,229\nAnd what about for\nour programs that are running on there?\n\n1116\n00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,914\n>> This is actually a really cool one.\n\n1117\n00:58:52,914 --> 00:58:55,780\nIt one of the ones that I tend to like.\n\n1118\n00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:02,516\nCuz what you can do is,\nyou can look at what programs are running.\n\n1119\n00:59:02,516 --> 00:59:05,730\nWe did that through the process,\nwe saw that there.\n\n1120\n00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:10,417\nBut, what if you wanna take a snoop\naround and see was this person was doing?\n\n1121\n00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:12,890\nIs there a way to do that?\n\n1122\n00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,980\nOn most systems,\nthere is a way to do that.\n\n1123\n00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:19,630\nIt's recorded what's\ndone on my system here,\n\n1124\n00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:25,430\nwhat I've done is I've ran this tool at\na WSCC called the last activity view.\n\n1125\n00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:29,670\nAnd what this does is this is\nshowing me everything that's\n\n1126\n00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,770\nran over a period of time.\n\n1127\n00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,390\nI'm going back quite a bit in here,\n\n1128\n00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:39,250\nyou can see I've got stuff from today,\nI've got stuff from yesterday.\n\n1129\n00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:42,430\n>> Don't scroll back too far you might\nget yourself in trouble here on live TV.\n\n1130\n00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:45,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] I'm thinking about kids, man.\n\n1131\n00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:47,316\nThis would be great just to monitor\nwhat your kids ran that day.\n\n1132\n00:59:47,316 --> 00:59:53,030\n[LAUGH]\n>> You could do a lot of course with this.\n\n1133\n00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:56,290\nFor a forensic sense this could be\nsomething that you browse through and\n\n1134\n00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,390\nyou can see it's like, well yes,\n\n1135\n00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:00,490\nwe saw that you ran that utility\nthat you claimed you didn't.\n\n1136\n01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:04,100\nWe can see it right there in black and\nwhite that you were running it.\n\n1137\n01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,660\n>> Yeah, our company policy\nprobably says something like, hey,\n\n1138\n01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:10,080\nyou're not allowed to run packet capture\nutilities on our corporate network because\n\n1139\n01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,980\nyou could capture information that\nyou don't normally have access to.\n\n1140\n01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,740\nAnd they say, well,\nI don't run any of that.\n\n1141\n01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,460\nWell, here I go.\n\n1142\n01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:22,610\nNow I've got the evidence that I can, yes,\nI can see where you did run Wire Shark.\n\n1143\n01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:24,170\nIn fact you've ran it several times.\n\n1144\n01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,390\nSo getting a history\nof those applications,\n\n1145\n01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,470\ncuz they're probably not\ncurrently running on the system,\n\n1146\n01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:31,550\nbut I need to know what they've been\ndoing, what they've been up to.\n\n1147\n01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:33,050\n>> Yeah.\nThis is direct evidence, and\n\n1148\n01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:37,680\nthis is save-able right out of this\nproduct, so you can just go ahead and\n\n1149\n01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:42,550\nsave it, and boom that goes in the pile\nof data that you've been collecting for\n\n1150\n01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:45,120\nthis specific situation.\n\n1151\n01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,140\nSo this is just a really neat thing.\n\n1152\n01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:50,900\n>> We got a lot of data already and we\nhaven't even touched the hard drive yet.\n\n1153\n01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,020\nI mean,\nwe're just running these processes or\n\n1154\n01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:56,260\nthese different utilities to gather\ninformation off this live system.\n\n1155\n01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,456\nWe haven't even started to dump\nany of the other stuff out yet,\n\n1156\n01:00:58,456 --> 01:01:00,520\nwe got a lot of information already.\n\n1157\n01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,950\n>> There's a lot of information\nthat has been gathered, and\n\n1158\n01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:05,910\nwe could go way deeper than this.\n\n1159\n01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:06,897\nAnd we're going to.\n\n1160\n01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:11,065\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is just, we're doing this for\n\n1161\n01:01:11,065 --> 01:01:12,326\nthe most part.\n\n1162\n01:01:12,326 --> 01:01:13,560\nNot for the most part.\n\n1163\n01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:18,060\nWe are doing this on Windows but\nthese things could be done on\n\n1164\n01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:23,080\nother operating systems to see what was\nbeing run, what processes are running.\n\n1165\n01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:28,880\nWe are gonna focus specifically on the\nWindows forensics process a little later,\n\n1166\n01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,260\nwe definitely have that coming up,\nbut this is just to kind of show you\n\n1167\n01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:36,890\nthe types of things that you\nshould be considering collecting.\n\n1168\n01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,570\nAnd you can see how easy it was to get.\n\n1169\n01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:42,640\nYou may not have realized it was\nthat easy to get this stuff, so\n\n1170\n01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,080\nwe've got quite a bit and there is\neven more that can come out of this.\n\n1171\n01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,550\nAnd some of these tools you\nprobably already knew about,\n\n1172\n01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,430\nsome of them may be brand new to you, but\n\n1173\n01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:53,570\nyou can see that these things\nare pretty simple, they're out there.\n\n1174\n01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:55,680\nWe can capture a lot of nice stuff.\n\n1175\n01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,838\n>> WFCC is going into my toolkit already.\n\n1176\n01:01:57,838 --> 01:01:59,841\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I already have my thumb drive picked\n\n1177\n01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:00,519\nout for this one.\n\n1178\n01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:05,026\n[LAUGH]\n>> I mean, I can even show you something\n\n1179\n01:02:05,026 --> 01:02:10,186\nelse in here, is that I got the last\nactivity view, here's another one\n\n1180\n01:02:10,186 --> 01:02:16,039\nthat since it was asked about, doesn't\na USB device leave a trace on the system.\n\n1181\n01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:20,394\nWell, yeah,\nit does leave a trace on the system,\n\n1182\n01:02:20,394 --> 01:02:25,788\nI just ran out of the WSEC,\nthis is something called USB deView\n\n1183\n01:02:25,788 --> 01:02:31,672\nkind of sort of [CROSSTALK] D-E-View\n>> Really easy to roll of the tongue.\n\n1184\n01:02:31,672 --> 01:02:35,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what we've got here,\n\n1185\n01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:42,700\nI see a list of stuff that was scanned\noff of my system and displayed here.\n\n1186\n01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:47,440\nThese are all USB devices that have been\nplugged into the system at some point it\n\n1187\n01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,160\njust went through the registry and\nread the different shell bags and keys and\n\n1188\n01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,050\nall that in there.\n\n1189\n01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,630\nAnd got the information, displayed it.\n\n1190\n01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,880\nI mean, if you look at this,\n\n1191\n01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,470\nI've got stuff in here from when I did my\nshow from when I did my CEH class here.\n\n1192\n01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,010\n>> I'll be.\n\n1193\n01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:06,120\n>> I mean, AirPcap is showing up in there.\n\n1194\n01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,620\nSo it noted that here AirPcap\nwas plugged into this box.\n\n1195\n01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,560\nSo it's, there you go.\n\n1196\n01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,350\nI've got my Kingston stuff in there,\n\n1197\n01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:19,610\nwhich is a flash drive and\nmy portable hard drive.\n\n1198\n01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:21,360\nIt's got that in there.\n\n1199\n01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:27,590\nSo I've got a nice list right on down,\nright on down the line\n\n1200\n01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:32,317\nthere telling me hey, this is what was\nconnected to that system at some point.\n\n1201\n01:03:32,317 --> 01:03:33,051\n>> That's beautiful.\n\n1202\n01:03:33,051 --> 01:03:34,010\nLove that.\n\n1203\n01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:37,610\nSo easy to gather that information\nup if we've got the right tools.\n\n1204\n01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:41,170\nSo a lot of different tools again\nSean's showing you just a few of them.\n\n1205\n01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:44,843\nThere's other tools that do the same thing\nthat you might be more comfortable with\n\n1206\n01:03:44,843 --> 01:03:45,971\nand might prefer doing.\n\n1207\n01:03:45,971 --> 01:03:47,479\nIt's all about cost and whether or\n\n1208\n01:03:47,479 --> 01:03:50,291\nnot it's gonna be accepted as\na trusted source of information.\n\n1209\n01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:53,540\nThere are a couple of other things\nthough that I do have to worry about.\n\n1210\n01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,960\nWhen it comes to picking\nthese tools right?\n\n1211\n01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:00,088\nAnd one of the big ones I think, that\nwe've gotta worry about is, whether or\n\n1212\n01:04:00,088 --> 01:04:01,971\nnot that tool modifies anything.\n\n1213\n01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:06,790\n>> Yes, these tools, there's\nthe potential for them to modify stuff.\n\n1214\n01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:10,662\nThere's potential for\nany tool to really modify something,\n\n1215\n01:04:10,662 --> 01:04:15,873\nwhether it's just writing something to the\ndrive, like in the form of a temp file,\n\n1216\n01:04:15,873 --> 01:04:19,386\nor maybe altering the registry or\nsomething like that.\n\n1217\n01:04:19,386 --> 01:04:21,742\nThat is possible.\n\n1218\n01:04:21,742 --> 01:04:27,251\nAgain, that's why you test all these\nthings before you go live with them,\n\n1219\n01:04:27,251 --> 01:04:30,669\nto make sure that it's\ndoing what you expect.\n\n1220\n01:04:30,669 --> 01:04:35,105\nIt's not going to do something that\nlater on you're getting blindsided by.\n\n1221\n01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:39,536\nThe last thing you wanna do,\nis be there in a court room, or\n\n1222\n01:04:39,536 --> 01:04:45,237\nbe there maybe outside of it having\nyour results questioned and analyzed,\n\n1223\n01:04:45,237 --> 01:04:50,684\nand have someone call you out on it and\nsay, well, this is what I found.\n\n1224\n01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:52,843\nAnd they say no, it doesn't work that way.\n\n1225\n01:04:52,843 --> 01:04:55,304\nAnd then, you find out there's\na gap in your knowledge.\n\n1226\n01:04:55,304 --> 01:04:56,407\nThey're gonna question you.\n\n1227\n01:04:56,407 --> 01:04:58,009\nWhere are of your gaps?\n\n1228\n01:04:58,009 --> 01:05:01,100\nAre there any ones we don't know about\n\n1229\n01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:05,359\nthat possibly could be\nthe next thing down the road?\n\n1230\n01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:10,484\nMake sure that you know that\neither they don't alter data,\n\n1231\n01:05:10,484 --> 01:05:17,468\nor if they do alter data, make sure you\nknow what the extent of the alteration is.\n\n1232\n01:05:17,468 --> 01:05:20,888\n>> If I’m going to run that WSCC\noff of a thumb drive, well,\n\n1233\n01:05:20,888 --> 01:05:25,187\nthat one we just saw that USB deviewer,\nit’s going to show up in there.\n\n1234\n01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:28,721\nBecause I've now plugged that thumb drive\ninto that system to try to capture some of\n\n1235\n01:05:28,721 --> 01:05:29,587\nthat information.\n\n1236\n01:05:29,587 --> 01:05:30,667\nSo, I just have to be able to document it.\n\n1237\n01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:33,230\nI have to be able to say,\nokay, that’s my thumb drive,\n\n1238\n01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,426\nthe one I’ve used to\ngather this information.\n\n1239\n01:05:35,426 --> 01:05:38,029\nSo, as long as we can document that,\nwe should be okay.\n\n1240\n01:05:38,029 --> 01:05:42,823\n>> Yeah,\nwe wanna know what things are doing.\n\n1241\n01:05:42,823 --> 01:05:46,538\nWe wanna know everything it's doing,\nif possible.\n\n1242\n01:05:46,538 --> 01:05:50,705\nYou should be aware of what it will do,\nor not do to a system.\n\n1243\n01:05:50,705 --> 01:05:55,900\nSo, if you're ever challenged on, well,\nthat's someone says well this is known\n\n1244\n01:05:55,900 --> 01:06:01,038\nto do that, well, no, it's not known to\ndo that, or yes I'm well aware of that.\n\n1245\n01:06:01,038 --> 01:06:02,582\nThat's documented.\n\n1246\n01:06:02,582 --> 01:06:05,646\nYou can talk knowledgeably about it.\n\n1247\n01:06:05,646 --> 01:06:09,981\nSo, you hope it doesn't change anything\nand there are things you can do\n\n1248\n01:06:09,981 --> 01:06:14,041\nthat don't, tools that you can\nget that don't alter the system.\n\n1249\n01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:15,376\nMany of these don't.\n\n1250\n01:06:15,376 --> 01:06:19,439\nThey'll just execute and\nextract the stuff off the system.\n\n1251\n01:06:19,439 --> 01:06:22,179\nBut some may go a little\nfurther than that.\n\n1252\n01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:26,769\nSo, they may need to be, I would say for\nexample something to look out for\n\n1253\n01:06:26,769 --> 01:06:31,303\nis if you're running a tool that when\nit runs, it has to unpack itself.\n\n1254\n01:06:31,303 --> 01:06:35,122\nTake it of out itself at compressed state,\nor doing anything like that.\n\n1255\n01:06:35,122 --> 01:06:37,259\nTo do that,\nit's put a temp file someplace.\n\n1256\n01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:38,861\nIt just has to be.\n\n1257\n01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:43,142\nSo, where's that temp file going because\nthat temp file could be overriding, or\n\n1258\n01:06:43,142 --> 01:06:47,755\ndoing something on the system that's gonna\nhave an impact on what you're collecting.\n\n1259\n01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:48,438\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1260\n01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:50,940\n>> So, definitely be aware of them, and\n\n1261\n01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,395\nI think someone mentioned\nthose different things.\n\n1262\n01:06:54,395 --> 01:06:58,017\nHack five cells and\nthose USB condoms, as they call them.\n\n1263\n01:06:58,017 --> 01:07:02,144\nIt's that device you can plug\nin a USB device into, and\n\n1264\n01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:07,815\nthen plug it into a system, and that\nwill block rights going into a system.\n\n1265\n01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:11,297\nSo, that may be, you know,\nhelpful for you in some cases too.\n\n1266\n01:07:11,297 --> 01:07:15,596\n>> So, tools we can use to protect our\ntools from modifying the system that we're\n\n1267\n01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:16,975\ntrying to investigate.\n\n1268\n01:07:16,975 --> 01:07:20,296\n>> Yeah, and this is on a live system\nby the way, we're talking about it.\n\n1269\n01:07:20,296 --> 01:07:22,083\nAbout knowing what these things do.\n\n1270\n01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:26,533\nYou should know what all your\ntools will do or won't do, but\n\n1271\n01:07:26,533 --> 01:07:31,785\nIf you get into a situation where\nyou are investigating a dead system,\n\n1272\n01:07:31,785 --> 01:07:36,339\na system that is turned off,\nwe can easily take care of that.\n\n1273\n01:07:36,339 --> 01:07:38,807\nWe're going to image it and\nwork off a copy, and\n\n1274\n01:07:38,807 --> 01:07:43,155\nif we're worried about corrupting the\ncopy, we've got write blockers for that.\n\n1275\n01:07:43,155 --> 01:07:46,992\nSo, but you can't do that\nwith a live system, unless,\n\n1276\n01:07:46,992 --> 01:07:51,810\nyou've ever had success pulling out\na hard drive on a live system, and\n\n1277\n01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:54,438\nyou did not hear us tell you to do that.\n\n1278\n01:07:54,438 --> 01:07:57,201\nThen, you're gonna have to\nbe aware that these things,\n\n1279\n01:07:57,201 --> 01:08:00,654\nyou're gonna not want them to make\nchanges to a system, but if they do,\n\n1280\n01:08:00,654 --> 01:08:03,494\nyou want to know what those\nchanges could potentially be.\n\n1281\n01:08:03,494 --> 01:08:04,515\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n1282\n01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:07,674\nAll right, and then something else that\nwe've got to worry about with these tools.\n\n1283\n01:08:07,674 --> 01:08:12,070\nAnd we've eluded to it several times\nthroughout our episodes is they've got to\n\n1284\n01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:13,258\nbe trusted, right?\n\n1285\n01:08:13,258 --> 01:08:16,612\nAnd who do we mean trusted,\ntrusted by whom?\n\n1286\n01:08:16,612 --> 01:08:21,162\n>> These tools should be ones that have\na track record of being accepted in\n\n1287\n01:08:21,162 --> 01:08:24,797\nthings like courtrooms,\nby other people in the field.\n\n1288\n01:08:24,797 --> 01:08:28,388\nSo, they've got a track\nrecord that's verifiable,\n\n1289\n01:08:28,388 --> 01:08:32,377\nthat they don't have any weird hiccups or\nbumps in the road.\n\n1290\n01:08:32,377 --> 01:08:37,312\nSometimes, that does happen so you want\nto know if that happens to pop up.\n\n1291\n01:08:37,312 --> 01:08:39,598\nSo, use those things.\n\n1292\n01:08:39,598 --> 01:08:45,839\nI like to say get them from known sources\nwhich I still tend to stick by for\n\n1293\n01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:50,832\nthe most part, but\nI know that it's been mentioned, and\n\n1294\n01:08:50,832 --> 01:08:55,853\nI get some of my stuff that I\nuse in here from SourceForge.\n\n1295\n01:08:55,853 --> 01:08:59,034\nSourceForge, people put\ntheir projects up there.\n\n1296\n01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:03,316\nYou might not necessarily know who\nthat is, but they make a great tool.\n\n1297\n01:09:03,316 --> 01:09:08,773\nIf that's the case, find out what the,\nI'm not saying don't use that tool,\n\n1298\n01:09:08,773 --> 01:09:12,013\nI'm saying investigate\nwho else is using it.\n\n1299\n01:09:12,013 --> 01:09:17,330\nEstablish that it is a tool that has\nsome sort of verifiable track record,\n\n1300\n01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:22,496\nthat people are okay with it, and\nthat it hasn't done anything funny.\n\n1301\n01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:26,281\nYou wanna make sure it has some usage, and\n\n1302\n01:09:26,281 --> 01:09:31,157\nyou're not the first one\ntesting the waters with it.\n\n1303\n01:09:31,157 --> 01:09:35,173\nI mean, someone has to, but\nmake sure that if it's you,\n\n1304\n01:09:35,173 --> 01:09:40,712\nthat you've got enough stuff behind you\nto show that yes, this is something.\n\n1305\n01:09:40,712 --> 01:09:42,697\nBut most people will go with the trust and\nstuff.\n\n1306\n01:09:42,697 --> 01:09:47,411\nThere's a reason why,\nwhen you look at something like, EnCase.\n\n1307\n01:09:47,411 --> 01:09:50,268\nIt's so popular even though it's so\npricey, and it's so\n\n1308\n01:09:50,268 --> 01:09:52,612\nlocked down on train and\neverything like that.\n\n1309\n01:09:52,612 --> 01:09:57,107\nThe reason why it's so popular,\nit has a very, very good name, and a very,\n\n1310\n01:09:57,107 --> 01:10:01,396\nvery good track record in the industry\nof doing what it's supposed to and\n\n1311\n01:10:01,396 --> 01:10:03,314\ncarrying out tasks perfectly.\n\n1312\n01:10:03,314 --> 01:10:03,931\nYou're paying for that.\n\n1313\n01:10:03,931 --> 01:10:06,138\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> If I come in there and I say, they say,\n\n1314\n01:10:06,138 --> 01:10:07,808\nwell, how did you gather this evidence?\n\n1315\n01:10:07,808 --> 01:10:08,865\nI used EnCase.\n\n1316\n01:10:08,865 --> 01:10:13,166\nOh, I mean, that pretty much stops them\nright there in their tracks, because it's\n\n1317\n01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:17,305\na known, trusted source of trusted tools\nthat we can use in the forensics world.\n\n1318\n01:10:17,305 --> 01:10:19,431\nIf I tell them I used Mike's Imaging,\n\n1319\n01:10:19,431 --> 01:10:23,295\nthat's gonna open up a whole flood\ngate of questions there, right?\n\n1320\n01:10:23,295 --> 01:10:28,090\n>> Yeah, that can be a thing if you\nget something that's not well-known.\n\n1321\n01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:31,442\nThey, very well, may accept it,\nbut they're gonna ask for\n\n1322\n01:10:31,442 --> 01:10:35,148\nmore proof from you that this is\nsomething that should be trusted.\n\n1323\n01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:38,004\nThe burden of truth is\non you at that point.\n\n1324\n01:10:38,004 --> 01:10:43,571\nIf it's something like, EnCase, it's\nimportant to realize just because you got\n\n1325\n01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:49,707\nEnCase, doesn't mean they're automatically\ngonna give you a free pass and everything.\n\n1326\n01:10:49,707 --> 01:10:52,968\nWhat they're doing is if they say okay,\nI'm using something like EnCase.\n\n1327\n01:10:52,968 --> 01:10:56,324\nWell, okay, we know this was\nused in other forensics cases.\n\n1328\n01:10:56,324 --> 01:10:58,263\nThey're still gonna come after you.\n\n1329\n01:10:58,263 --> 01:11:00,388\nWhat they're gonna look at is saying,\ndid you use the tool correctly?\n\n1330\n01:11:00,388 --> 01:11:03,893\n>> Yeah, now it's on you yourself and\nyour procedures that you used.\n\n1331\n01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:06,866\nYour chain of evidence and\nthings like that.\n\n1332\n01:11:06,866 --> 01:11:09,443\nBut at least, the tool,\nit can't be called into question.\n\n1333\n01:11:09,443 --> 01:11:16,001\n>> Yeah, they'll scrutinize you to see,\ndid you follow procedure or a process?\n\n1334\n01:11:16,001 --> 01:11:17,649\nWhat your experience level is.\n\n1335\n01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:20,727\nThat's what they're going to start\nshifting more of their focus on.\n\n1336\n01:11:20,727 --> 01:11:22,851\nSo, be prepared for something like that.\n\n1337\n01:11:22,851 --> 01:11:23,525\n>> Yeah.\n\n1338\n01:11:23,525 --> 01:11:27,425\n>> So, yeah,\nyou're always gonna get tested on this.\n\n1339\n01:11:27,425 --> 01:11:31,597\nIf you do get to the point where you're\ngonna be an expert witness, then yeah,\n\n1340\n01:11:31,597 --> 01:11:34,206\nthey're gonna keep trying\nto drill you with it.\n\n1341\n01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:39,731\nThe best guys that are forensics techs in\nthe industry get challenged on the stand.\n\n1342\n01:11:39,731 --> 01:11:45,106\nThey don't ever get to a point where, oh,\nwell, they said it, that his word is law.\n\n1343\n01:11:45,106 --> 01:11:46,789\nNo, they don't do that.\n\n1344\n01:11:46,789 --> 01:11:49,369\n>> What, they don't just take your\nword for it, when you walk in there?\n\n1345\n01:11:49,369 --> 01:11:50,689\n>> If they know it's good for\nthem, they do.\n\n1346\n01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:56,324\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so we've gotta make\nsure that our tools that we're using\n\n1347\n01:11:56,324 --> 01:12:03,040\ndon't alter the data, as well as they're a\ntrusted source of, tool itself is trusted.\n\n1348\n01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:08,330\nWe need to somehow prove that we've\ncaptured, or the data that we've acquired,\n\n1349\n01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:10,320\nis correct, right?\n\n1350\n01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,000\n>> Yes, and\nthat's been alluded to along the way.\n\n1351\n01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,423\nBut you need to make sure that if you're\ncapturing images, capturing data,\n\n1352\n01:12:19,423 --> 01:12:23,981\nyou have to make sure there's a way that,\nfirst of all, when you collected it,\n\n1353\n01:12:23,981 --> 01:12:27,607\nwhich we had mentioned several times,\ndo a date and time grab.\n\n1354\n01:12:27,607 --> 01:12:31,079\nAnd then run the tool so you can show\nthe date and time on the system,\n\n1355\n01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:34,140\nthe date and time on the file,\nto verify both.\n\n1356\n01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:37,170\nBut then there also comes in\nthe question of hashing, and\n\n1357\n01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:39,560\nthere's a lot of tools for that.\n\n1358\n01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,820\nOne of them that's used quite\na bit is one called Hashcat.\n\n1359\n01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:47,470\nThere's other ones that do other\ntypes of hashes out there.\n\n1360\n01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:52,620\nThere's imaging software that does\nhashes as part of its core function.\n\n1361\n01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:56,750\nAnd if it doesn't do it as part of it's\ncore function, then you have to hash it.\n\n1362\n01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:00,470\nWithout that its validity and\n\n1363\n01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:03,810\nbe questioned and\nthat's exactly what you don't want.\n\n1364\n01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:07,770\nYou want to have it where, this is the way\nit was when it was collected at the scene\n\n1365\n01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,380\nand this is the way it was now.\n\n1366\n01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,530\nThat's what you wanna have and\n\n1367\n01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:15,100\nhave no question about point A to point\nB and whatever points in between.\n\n1368\n01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,290\nYou wanna have that.\n\n1369\n01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:20,050\nSo figure out a way that you're\ngoing to go through and verify that.\n\n1370\n01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,756\nLike I said,\nthere's plenty of tools out there.\n\n1371\n01:13:21,756 --> 01:13:25,101\nLike I said, Hashcat,\nthere's a bunch of MP5 tools and\n\n1372\n01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:28,880\nthere's other tools that are used\nto verify this sort of thing.\n\n1373\n01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,530\nIn fact, WSCC has a tool in\nthere called Hash My Files.\n\n1374\n01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:35,890\nIt'll specifically do that.\n\n1375\n01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:39,720\nAutopsy has something that will\nactually hash files for you, too.\n\n1376\n01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,786\nSo you've got a lot of capability.\n\n1377\n01:13:41,786 --> 01:13:46,434\nShould also talk to you about the\nimportance of that specific feature, and\n\n1378\n01:13:46,434 --> 01:13:48,659\nthat specific action, to do that.\n\n1379\n01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:53,911\nBecause just about everything you see\nthat's in the forensics field is gonna\n\n1380\n01:13:53,911 --> 01:13:58,914\nhave a way to do a checksum or a hash,\nwhatever, on the stuff you collect to\n\n1381\n01:13:58,914 --> 01:14:04,180\nestablish credibility, integrity of\nthe information being collected.\n\n1382\n01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:04,800\n>> Yeah.\n\n1383\n01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,210\nSomehow we have to be able to\nvalidate that information because\n\n1384\n01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:11,280\nthat's what the defense\nattorneys get paid to do.\n\n1385\n01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,590\nIs to try to poke holes in it.\n\n1386\n01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:16,010\nIf we can validate it, we can avoid that.\n\n1387\n01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:19,010\nSo validating,\nwhat else we need to talk about?\n\n1388\n01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:23,050\nRAID, does RAID bring anything different\ninto our data acquisition methods?\n\n1389\n01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,540\n>> Yes it does.\n\n1390\n01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:27,910\nThat's kind of an interesting\none as far as all this goes.\n\n1391\n01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:31,940\nIf you're doing a live\ncollection on a system on site,\n\n1392\n01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:36,870\nthen you're,\nthe RAID becomes less of an issue.\n\n1393\n01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:41,350\nBut if you have to take\nthat system off-site and\n\n1394\n01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,960\ndo a dead or\nstatic evaluation on the system,\n\n1395\n01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,120\nyou might be tempted to just pull the hard\ndrives out of it and just take it.\n\n1396\n01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,160\nThat's what they'll do\nwith certain systems.\n\n1397\n01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:56,550\nBut that may not be an option for\nyou, especially with RAID.\n\n1398\n01:14:56,550 --> 01:15:01,050\nIf you've gone through RAID, you know that\nyou have to have certain drives with you,\n\n1399\n01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:02,150\na certain number of drives.\n\n1400\n01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:03,810\nAre all the drives with\nyou that you need to have?\n\n1401\n01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:06,530\nCertain hardware to make the thing work.\n\n1402\n01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:10,570\nIn which case, you may just say\nthis whole computer is mine now,\n\n1403\n01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:12,915\nwhy I do the analysis.\n\n1404\n01:15:12,915 --> 01:15:19,205\nSo if you do look inside a case and\nyou see that type of stuff, and you're not\n\n1405\n01:15:19,205 --> 01:15:23,095\ngonna image there, then you're gonna have\nto go through and grab the whole system.\n\n1406\n01:15:23,095 --> 01:15:26,525\nIt also brings up\nthe interesting detail of\n\n1407\n01:15:26,525 --> 01:15:31,335\nwhen you image the drives\nhow do you image them?\n\n1408\n01:15:31,335 --> 01:15:36,500\nIn some cases you can image them one\nby one, or you can get these ones\n\n1409\n01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:41,498\nthat multiple discs at a time, or\nthat can do that type of thing.\n\n1410\n01:15:41,498 --> 01:15:44,633\nIn fact what, we were looking at one at\nthe break that did ten drives at once.\n\n1411\n01:15:44,633 --> 01:15:45,619\n>> That was a Logicube one.\n\n1412\n01:15:45,619 --> 01:15:47,071\nWhat was the price tag on that, $4500?\n\n1413\n01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,893\n>> Yeah, $4500.\n\n1414\n01:15:48,893 --> 01:15:51,790\nUsed off eBay,\nyou can get a drive duplicator.\n\n1415\n01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,810\nSo yeah.\n\n1416\n01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:57,532\nYes.\nSo it's time to ask for Christmas right?\n\n1417\n01:15:57,532 --> 01:16:02,317\nBut you know if you have, a system\nhas RAID or any sort of exotic type\n\n1418\n01:16:02,317 --> 01:16:07,377\nhardware in it, you may wanna consider\njust taking the whole system.\n\n1419\n01:16:07,377 --> 01:16:11,870\nI would extended, it you just alluded to,\nI'm gonna extend it out beyond a RAID.\n\n1420\n01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:15,795\nIf you have anything that's gonna be\nexotic or a little off the wall there,\n\n1421\n01:16:15,795 --> 01:16:19,471\nthen it's probably best just to say\nI'm taking the system and I'm not\n\n1422\n01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:23,736\ngonna concern myself with hey, where am\nI gonna scramble to find this hardware.\n\n1423\n01:16:23,736 --> 01:16:28,210\nCuz that could delay your investigation\nand time may be of the essence.\n\n1424\n01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:31,970\nSo you're gonna have to\njust keep that in mind.\n\n1425\n01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:32,730\n>> Right.\n\n1426\n01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:33,292\nAbsolutely.\n\n1427\n01:16:33,292 --> 01:16:36,380\nSo RAID's gonna come into play.\n\n1428\n01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:40,160\nBest practices, we need to think\nabout why we're our data acquisition.\n\n1429\n01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,480\n>> Yes, we've talked about some\nof these things in passing.\n\n1430\n01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:50,160\nMake sure you understand the, when and\n\n1431\n01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:54,730\nwhere to do your imaging and\nacquire data off a system.\n\n1432\n01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:59,330\nKnow your orders of volatility are\ncritical to navigating this successfully.\n\n1433\n01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:07,070\nAnd then, remember,\nit's not just orders of volatility.\n\n1434\n01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:10,250\nSomething, a piece of information\ncan be very volatile and\n\n1435\n01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,820\nyou can only get it at one point and time.\n\n1436\n01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:14,960\nAnd it might seem to you to be like, oh,\n\n1437\n01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,610\nI need to pour all this effort\ninto getting that right now.\n\n1438\n01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:22,930\nMaybe it's not relevant to\nwhat you're doing, look to\n\n1439\n01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:27,860\nsee what your goals were and see if\nit's worth collecting at that point.\n\n1440\n01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:32,010\nAnd also, don't collect\nsomething that is volatile and\n\n1441\n01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:35,420\nhas some importance over something\nthat's static or dead and\n\n1442\n01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:40,250\nhas tremendous importance ,and so\nyou get this over this.\n\n1443\n01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:45,180\nAnd what happens is that other\ndata either gets changed or\n\n1444\n01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:47,370\naltered or something like that.\n\n1445\n01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:49,040\nDon't sacrifice one or the other.\n\n1446\n01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,790\nYou're gonna have to make that choice.\n\n1447\n01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:53,090\nYou can't just go through and say I'm\ngonna to get everything off a system.\n\n1448\n01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:57,070\nSome of your stuff is going\nto be either destructive or\n\n1449\n01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:59,935\njust not practical to do in every case.\n\n1450\n01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:02,050\nSo think about those things and\n\n1451\n01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:07,060\nknow how to approach a system as well,\nand evaluate the system.\n\n1452\n01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:10,611\nEven, David mentions in here\nabout moving RAID around and\n\n1453\n01:18:10,611 --> 01:18:14,307\neven says you almost need,\nwhen we're talking about RAID,\n\n1454\n01:18:14,307 --> 01:18:17,573\neven knowing what RAID\nlevel you're talking about.\n\n1455\n01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:21,938\nYeah, That's an excellent\npoint to bring up, David.\n\n1456\n01:18:21,938 --> 01:18:30,740\nBecause you come up to a system that\nhas a RAID, a RAID setup in it.\n\n1457\n01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:36,030\nWell, can you determine fully what type\nof RAID it is just by looking inside?\n\n1458\n01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:37,130\nAre you able to do that?\n\n1459\n01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:40,280\nWho knows,\nmaybe you might be able to do that.\n\n1460\n01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:44,833\nThen again, if you can't do it that way,\nmaybe you're gonna have to poke around in\n\n1461\n01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:47,840\nthe system more to figure out\nfrom that side of things.\n\n1462\n01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,340\nAnd maybe that's not practical\nbecause that poking around is going to\n\n1463\n01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:55,170\nfundamentally do something to the system.\n\n1464\n01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:58,250\nWe don't know what, but it could do\nsomething fundamentally to the system,\n\n1465\n01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:01,090\nand then cause other sorts of things.\n\n1466\n01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:05,290\nThat maybe why, you just have to say,\nthis is coming with me.\n\n1467\n01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:08,415\nI'm gonna do it,\nI'm gonna collect the stuff here.\n\n1468\n01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:11,250\nOr that I can collect here\nbefore I turn the system off.\n\n1469\n01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:14,740\nAnd then this thing's getting carted\nup and taken back to the lab with me.\n\n1470\n01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:17,310\nIf you're not sure,\nthat may be the way to go.\n\n1471\n01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:22,013\nAlways be as sure as you can be\nthat you're results are gonna be\n\n1472\n01:19:22,013 --> 01:19:23,374\nwhat you expect.\n\n1473\n01:19:23,374 --> 01:19:25,244\nYou're gonna get\nthe results that you want.\n\n1474\n01:19:25,244 --> 01:19:26,544\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1475\n01:19:26,544 --> 01:19:30,705\nAll right, so let's see,\nwe talked about our validation of methods.\n\n1476\n01:19:30,705 --> 01:19:35,895\nRAID is gonna play a big part of what we\ndo or how we go about acquiring that data.\n\n1477\n01:19:35,895 --> 01:19:38,230\nTalked about some best practices there.\n\n1478\n01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:42,289\nRound this thing off with some data\nacquisitions, software tools, and\n\n1479\n01:19:42,289 --> 01:19:43,561\nhardware tools here.\n\n1480\n01:19:43,561 --> 01:19:48,479\n>> Yes, we have a whole bag\nof tools that we can use\n\n1481\n01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:53,410\non the software side And\non the hardware side.\n\n1482\n01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:58,790\nUnfortunately the hardware stuff, we've\nonly got a couple things here for that.\n\n1483\n01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:02,900\nBecause of the nature of that stuff,\nwe'd have a whole stuff.\n\n1484\n01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:05,410\nWe'd have teams bringing this in and\nswapping it out.\n\n1485\n01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:08,630\n>> We don't have our forensic\nlabs set up completely here\n\n1486\n01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:11,130\n>> Yeah, it's behind the hatch over\n\n1487\n01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:11,673\nthere, so.\n\n1488\n01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:13,190\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm working on the budget\n\n1489\n01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:14,060\naspect of that.\n\n1490\n01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:17,580\nSo if you guys wanna see more,\nmake sure you just write in,\n\n1491\n01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:21,283\ntalk to Don,\nsay we need an entire forensics lab here.\n\n1492\n01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,940\n>> [LAUGH] Or\njust give money to our Kickstarter.\n\n1493\n01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:24,650\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n1494\n01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:29,750\n>> So but yeah,\nthere's a lot of stuff in there.\n\n1495\n01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:32,570\nI would tell you with\nthe hardware side of things,\n\n1496\n01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:36,570\nif you're gonna be setting up a lab and\n\n1497\n01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:41,170\nyou need the hardware, you might consider\nlooking on eBay for some of this stuff.\n\n1498\n01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:44,240\nWe were poking through eBay and\nwe were finding bunches of stuff.\n\n1499\n01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,730\nSome of it you can get pretty cheap.\n\n1500\n01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:47,149\n>> But don't them about that one,\nI wanna go bid on that.\n\n1501\n01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:47,963\n>> Yeah, except that one.\n\n1502\n01:20:47,963 --> 01:20:51,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, don't be outbidding anybody.\n\n1503\n01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:55,070\nBut yeah,\nthere's stuff on eBay you can get.\n\n1504\n01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:58,940\nThere's a lot of them that pop up in\nthere when labs get decommissioned and\n\n1505\n01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:00,310\nstuff like that.\n\n1506\n01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:02,930\nYou may be tempted to want to\nget all the hardware toys.\n\n1507\n01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:07,900\nThe hardware toys brand new tend to\nalways be pretty expensive unless you're\n\n1508\n01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:11,400\ntalking something like the bags for\nputting cell phones stuff like that in.\n\n1509\n01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,570\nStuff like drive duplicators and\nthe mobile forensic kits.\n\n1510\n01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:20,000\nExpect to have to pay\nsome serious bucks for\n\n1511\n01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,520\nthat because that's just the nature\nof the beast with those ones.\n\n1512\n01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,790\nThe software side, the software\nside can in some cases be as or\n\n1513\n01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:32,160\neven more expensive than the hardware,\nbut you don't have to do that.\n\n1514\n01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,470\nYou've already seen, and\n\n1515\n01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:37,240\nwe are gonna see even more,\nsoftware tools that you can have.\n\n1516\n01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,530\nGet the ones that do\nthe basic stuff you need.\n\n1517\n01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:43,950\nThe imaging,\nthe stuff to grab stuff out of memory,\n\n1518\n01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:45,840\nthe stuff to analyze the network.\n\n1519\n01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,250\nA lot of those things are free or\nyou already have.\n\n1520\n01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:53,570\nI mean, Wireshark being one that is\nused for network forensics all the time.\n\n1521\n01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:57,380\nAnd so that's free and\nthere's tons of documentation on it so\n\n1522\n01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:01,180\nyou don't even have to go to any\nspecial training classes for it.\n\n1523\n01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:04,810\nHeck, you're watching this one,\nthere's a Wireshark course up on IT Pro.\n\n1524\n01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:09,000\nSo you can learn how to use\nthese tools very easily, and\n\n1525\n01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,190\nget access to the soft ones.\n\n1526\n01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:14,390\nYou don't have to go out, and\nsay I need to go out and buy EnCase and\n\n1527\n01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:15,710\nget the budget for that.\n\n1528\n01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:18,660\nNo, you don't,\nyou can get something like Autopsy.\n\n1529\n01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,441\nThat does quite a bit.\n\n1530\n01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:24,580\nAnd so combine it with other tools and\nmake a suite.\n\n1531\n01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:26,440\nAnd I kinda like it this way.\n\n1532\n01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,780\nI'm not putting down EnCase, but\n\n1533\n01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:32,300\nI like the idea of being able\nto kinda roll my own solution.\n\n1534\n01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,350\nFind the tools that I want and\n\n1535\n01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:37,120\nhave multiple ones that do each and\nboom, I've got it.\n\n1536\n01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,350\nThat's what this system's for.\n\n1537\n01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:40,040\nI've got a lot of\ndifferent tools on it for\n\n1538\n01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,880\ndoing the stuff that\nwe're talking about here.\n\n1539\n01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,815\nAnd my ethical hacking stuff too.\n\n1540\n01:22:43,815 --> 01:22:46,450\nCuz a lot of stuff does come over\nto the forensics side as well.\n\n1541\n01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:47,720\n>> Right again, very good.\n\n1542\n01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:52,140\nAll right, well Sean we've got a lot\nof information in this episode.\n\n1543\n01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:55,760\nWe've talked about data acquisition and\nduplication.\n\n1544\n01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,810\nAll the way from working\nwith a static system or\n\n1545\n01:22:58,810 --> 01:23:02,460\na dead system as you like to\ncall it to a live system and\n\n1546\n01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:05,850\nhow we can go about starting\nto capture that information.\n\n1547\n01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:09,640\nA little bit about the order that we have\nto worry about, that order of volatility.\n\n1548\n01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:13,900\nAnd look at some of the tools and then\nsome of the requirements we might have for\n\n1549\n01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:14,490\nthose tools.\n\n1550\n01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:17,250\nAnd what we need to think\nabout when we're choosing\n\n1551\n01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:19,920\nthe tools that we want to\nuse to do our investigation.\n\n1552\n01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,500\nSo anything else we want to throw\nin here before we wrap this one up?\n\n1553\n01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:26,200\n>> I'd just say practice\nwith some of these tools and\n\n1554\n01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:30,430\nget used to the process of what's\nbeing dumped out of a system.\n\n1555\n01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:32,790\nSo you saw a few of them in here.\n\n1556\n01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:35,650\nI do know by the way, I did noticed that\nsomeone was asking did we look cover\n\n1557\n01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:38,880\nunder the registry Viewing tools.\n\n1558\n01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,730\nWe're not doing that yet.\n\n1559\n01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:43,940\nThe next section we'll talk\nabout Windows forensics,\n\n1560\n01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:45,280\nthen we will be talking about it.\n\n1561\n01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,010\nThis was like more of a generic thing.\n\n1562\n01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:51,530\nSo you'll be seeing this stuff again, plus\nsome more stuff specific to Windows, so.\n\n1563\n01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:53,180\n>> Yeah.\n>> But you're gonna wanna get practicing\n\n1564\n01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:55,980\nwith all these you utilities\nto see what they do.\n\n1565\n01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:59,090\nGet used to their output, and\nget used to piping them over to files.\n\n1566\n01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:00,820\nThat would be kind of like your homework,\n\n1567\n01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:03,990\nif you wanna put it that\nway to do at this point.\n\n1568\n01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:04,850\n>> Very good.\n\n1569\n01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:08,090\nAll right well, ladies and gentleman,\nwe appreciate everybody tuning in.\n\n1570\n01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:12,100\nAnd remember, if you guys have\na question during the show ask

morning.\nGood afternoon.\n\n5\n00:00:34,465 --> 00:00:35,830\nAnd good evening.\nWelcome.\n\n6\n00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,150\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,980\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n8\n00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,290\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n9\n00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,460\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n10\n00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,780\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,070\nLooking forward to today's episode.\n\n12\n00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,980\nWe're continuing on with our digital\nforensic investigator series.\n\n13\n00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,510\nAnd in this episode in particular\nwe're going to be talking about\n\n14\n00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,020\nWindows Forensics.\n\n15\n00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,720\nWe're gonna start taking some\nof those best practices,\n\n16\n00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,530\nand all of that we've talked about in our\nprevious episodes, and see how we actually\n\n17\n00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,950\napply it in a forensics investigation\non a Windows based operating system.\n\n18\n00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,290\nSo, lots of cool stuff coming up,\nright Sean?\n\n19\n00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,070\n>> Yes,\nwe have a lot of good stuff coming up.\n\n20\n00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,720\nSome stuff from that we have seen and\n\n21\n00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,850\nwe're just kind of applying specifically\nto the Windows environment now.\n\n22\n00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,980\nAnd then we've got some new\nstuff which is kinda cool.\n\n23\n00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,510\n>> Always.\n\n24\n00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,090\nAlways.\nWell we're gonna go ahead and get started.\n\n25\n00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,550\nNow we've talked about having a goal,\nright.\n\n26\n00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,860\nAnd having a procedure in\nplace that we follow and\n\n27\n00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,320\nwe talked about setting priorities.\n\n28\n00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,680\nAnd if we're gonna capture information.\n\n29\n00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,390\nIf it's a live system,\n\n30\n00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,260\none of the first things we gotta think\nabout is, the volatile information, right?\n\n31\n00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,590\n>> Yes, and we can't stress that\nenough about that there's volatility\n\n32\n00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,550\nconcerned here when you're talking about.\n\n33\n00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,930\nAny information that you\nconnect off of a live system.\n\n34\n00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,170\nOf course, a system that's static or\ndead as I call it doesn't have that issue.\n\n35\n00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,230\nYou've got a system that's,\nthat's the way it is.\n\n36\n00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,380\nJust don't turn it on,\ntake it someplace, extract the drive and\n\n37\n00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,090\nyou know, put your write blocker\nin place and do your imaging.\n\n38\n00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,630\nGene.\n\n39\n00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,980\nAnd, by the way,\nif you haven't seen a write-blocker,\n\n40\n00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,670\neasiest way to look at it,\ngo to eBay and type in write-blocker.\n\n41\n00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,210\nThere's a lot of them being sold, for\nevery different type of interface,\n\n42\n00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:25,180\nyou know, USB, FireWire, the old IDE and\nenhanced IDE stuff that have all of those.\n\n43\n00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,110\nSo you could see, there's usually\njust a little box about yea big,\n\n44\n00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,750\nabout the size of a pack of cards,\npretty much.\n\n45\n00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,510\n>> Yeah, a really pretty simple device.\n\n46\n00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,470\nAll it's doing is blocking a couple\nof those pins that are normally and\n\n47\n00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,070\nyou got two way data transmissions going\non between your external device and\n\n48\n00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,370\nthat computer, then we're just gonna\nblock the ones that are coming in, right?\n\n49\n00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,810\n>> Yeah, that's basically it.\n\n50\n00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,770\nYeah.\n>> So relatively straightforward process,\n\n51\n00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,480\nrelatively.\n\n52\n00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,962\nAre the device expensive?\n\n53\n00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,860\nThese blockers.\n\n54\n00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,610\n>> Some of them can be when you start\ngetting some of the older ones,\n\n55\n00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,890\nthe more exotic ones, they can cost\nthat much, but they typically don't.\n\n56\n00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,680\nBut they also have different\nqualities of them too.\n\n57\n00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,500\nYou can get some that are really\nquite cheap that get you'd get for\n\n58\n00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,990\nmaybe 50 or 60 bucks.\n\n59\n00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,270\nThere's ones that may cost way\nmore than that just depending\n\n60\n00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,890\non what type of functionality they have.\n\n61\n00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,420\nYou know, some of them have all the extra,\nports and\n\n62\n00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,450\nfancy gimmicks on it if that's what you\nwant, you know, and you're probably\n\n63\n00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,430\ngoing to need to have a few of those too\nto be prepared adequately, cuz you never\n\n64\n00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,430\nknow when you crack open the case of\na system what interface is gonna be there.\n\n65\n00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,070\n>> Good old IDE, SATA, or iSCSI,\nyou know, SCSI or something like that.\n\n66\n00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,420\n>> Yeah, you could run into anything.\n\n67\n00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,640\n>> You got your,\nas you said USB external type devices.\n\n68\n00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,230\n>> Gotta have one that supports all those,\nhas different adapters maybe, or\n\n69\n00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,810\ndifferent ones for different scenarios.\n\n70\n00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,630\n>> Yeah, be prepared for\nthose sorts of things.\n\n71\n00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,300\nAnd so, you should also be thinking as\nwe're going through this, thinks like\n\n72\n00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,490\nhaving write blockers and building up your\ntoolkit, because that's something you are.\n\n73\n00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:06,180\n>> Need at some point unless you really\nwanna risk perhaps interfering with that\n\n74\n00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,410\ndrive and changing stuff on it, I'd rather\nnot have any question that something,\n\n75\n00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,990\nto whether or\nnot something's been changed or not.\n\n76\n00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,800\nAnd the write blocker definitively\nsays it has not been changed.\n\n77\n00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,050\nYou know,\nwhen it's used the way it's supposed to.\n\n78\n00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,690\n>> Alright.\nAbsolutely.\n\n79\n00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,970\nGotta have that.\n\n80\n00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,620\nAlright, so\nwhen we talk about volatile information,\n\n81\n00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,520\nyou know that we're\ntrying to collect here.\n\n82\n00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,510\nIt's dynamic right?\n\n83\n00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,820\nIt's changing, it's not static\ninformation that we're looking at.\n\n84\n00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820\nYeah, it's very dynamic.\n\n85\n00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,400\nIt absolutely could change as\nyou're doing your investigation.\n\n86\n00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,300\nThat's one of the reasons why\nfrom our previous go around, and\n\n87\n00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,410\nwe're gonna talk about here as well\nIs capturing that date information,\n\n88\n00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,820\nthat time information, because we need\nto know when and where we captured that,\n\n89\n00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,660\njust in case something does change on the\nstate of the system, it very well could.\n\n90\n00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,730\nThe systems change, just hands off,\nthere are changes that they're\n\n91\n00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,530\ndoing on a normal cleanup the caches\nare being manipulated and stuff like that.\n\n92\n00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,410\nSo we want to make sure.\n\n93\n00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,080\n>> Especially Windows.\n\n94\n00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,010\nWindows has got something\ngoing on all the time.\n\n95\n00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,950\nI swear my little icon's always busy.\n\n96\n00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,620\n>> Yeah.\nWindows is always doing something behind\n\n97\n00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,170\nyour back.\n\n98\n00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:15,720\nYeah.\nRight?\n\n99\n00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,700\nIt's just always you're like\nwhat are you doing now?\n\n100\n00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,030\nYou see that light and your drive\nmoving or something blinking or.\n\n101\n00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,580\nYou know like I said your icons changed,\nit's like what are you doing?\n\n102\n00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,930\n>> Absolutely.\nBut they do,\n\n103\n00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,290\nthey've got a lot of scheduled tasks now,\nright I know with Windows 8, for\n\n104\n00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,820\nexample, a lot of stuff that we did\nmanually back in Windows XP for\n\n105\n00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,440\nexample, is now a scheduled task.\n\n106\n00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,410\nRuns automatically in the background\nwhen it senses down time or\n\n107\n00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,300\nwhen the processors drop in usage.\n\n108\n00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,110\nThis stuff changes very fast or\nit can change so\n\n109\n00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,160\nwe've got to make sure when we capture\nthe information we're also recording\n\n110\n00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,740\ndate time stamps so we can validate\nwhen that information was collected.\n\n111\n00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,300\n>> Yeah.\nThere definitely could be a lot going on\n\n112\n00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,960\nI should also throw in here as\nwe're talking about this when\n\n113\n00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,860\nyou look at a static system and\nyou have it sitting there.\n\n114\n00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,050\nOne of the reasons why we always try to\nmake sure we're pulling the drive out of\n\n115\n00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,600\nthe device and imaging it someplace else,\nwherever possible.\n\n116\n00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,710\nIs, if that's a, if the person that had\nthat drive, that system that's the subject\n\n117\n00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,150\nof the investigation, they were the last\none that turned on that computer and\n\n118\n00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,070\nthe one's that use that system all\nthe time, it's not unheard of for\n\n119\n00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,660\nthem to booby trap those systems,\n\n120\n00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,140\nto put scripts on the back of certain\naccounts and so if you login.\n\n121\n00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,150\nAnd you don't log into the right\naccount or you don't do a certain\n\n122\n00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,570\nkey combination or do something,\nit will obliterate the drive or\n\n123\n00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,020\ndo something to eliminate evidence or\nsomehow thwart what your plans are.\n\n124\n00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,660\nSo what we do is we plug that into a write\nblocker and do a quick image of that and\n\n125\n00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,400\nthen work off the image and if that\ndoes happen at least we know, you know,\n\n126\n00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,630\nwhat had occurred and\nwe didn't destroy the original.\n\n127\n00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,560\n>> Let's not use that account again,\nlet's try a different account and\n\n128\n00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,100\nsee if it wipes everything.\n\n129\n00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,920\n>> Yeah, that's one of the reasons why you\ntell your first responders not to go in\n\n130\n00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,975\nand start monkeying around.\n\n131\n00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:09,515\nWith stuff.\n\n132\n00:07:09,515 --> 00:07:12,135\nThey don't start going around and\nsaying hey let me keep trying a password.\n\n133\n00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:13,685\nI've actually seen that guidance.\n\n134\n00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:16,415\nKeep trying that stuff till you get in.\n\n135\n00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,435\nI don't know what type of\nbizarro world that person\n\n136\n00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:21,655\nlived in to think that\nthat was a good idea.\n\n137\n00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:22,925\nI would never recommend that.\n\n138\n00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,925\nIt's like, stop poking it with a stick and\n\n139\n00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:29,535\nleave it alone until someone that knows\nhow to handle that scene gets there.\n\n140\n00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,895\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n141\n00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:34,680\nDon't pull the CSI or the Law & Order and\ngo, oh yeah, let me go ahead and\n\n142\n00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,710\nlog in here and\nsee what the last text message was,\n\n143\n00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,290\nor try to log onto that system or\nsomething like that.\n\n144\n00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,500\nThat's not real world.\n\n145\n00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,860\n>> Yeah, you're asking for trouble.\n\n146\n00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,010\nYou're definitely asking for\ntrouble if you do that.\n\n147\n00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,600\n>> Absolutely.\nAnd\n\n148\n00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,545\nthen another thing that we've got to worry\nabout, and we kinda alluded to that so\n\n149\n00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:49,250\nfar, why we talk about\nthese right blockers.\n\n150\n00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,810\nAs we're collecting that information,\n\n151\n00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,960\nwe could end up leaving\nmarks on that system right?\n\n152\n00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,460\n>> Yeah, don't leave your fingerprints,\nso to speak, behind.\n\n153\n00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,647\nIf you leave your fingerprints,\nfrom what you're doing,\n\n154\n00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:09,418\nbehind on that system, it does happen,\nand you try to avoid it, but\n\n155\n00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:15,850\nthat's also why you take note of what type\nof changes something does do on a system.\n\n156\n00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,850\nWindows, it's very easy to make changes\non it without even thinking about it.\n\n157\n00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,330\nAs we mentioned,\nplugging in a flash drive.\n\n158\n00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,864\nYou plug in a flash drive then it's\neasy enough for one of those things to,\n\n159\n00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:29,772\nand that's what they do,\nchange setting in the registry and\n\n160\n00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:32,060\nload drivers that weren't there.\n\n161\n00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,120\nSo now you've altered that environment.\n\n162\n00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,320\nIt's that exchange principle\nwe talked about already,\n\n163\n00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,120\nduring the week, a few times.\n\n164\n00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,380\nSo we're trying to limit what we do to\na point where we're not doing anything,\n\n165\n00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,580\nbut we try to limit it at\nleast as much as we can.\n\n166\n00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,210\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n167\n00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,720\nCuz if you think about it, you're now\nthe last person to log on the system,\n\n168\n00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,600\nnot the person you're\ntrying to investigate.\n\n169\n00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,780\nIf you start accessing files,\n\n170\n00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,140\nyou're the one that you've now changed\nthat last access date, things like that.\n\n171\n00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,750\nAnd then a lot of stuff in the background.\n\n172\n00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,928\nDrivers can get loaded up,\nregistry changes can be made, so\n\n173\n00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:06,340\njust, you wanna be really careful\nthat I'm not making changes.\n\n174\n00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,880\nAnd then all of a sudden if my,\n\n175\n00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,070\nremember we talked about being able\nto validate our evidence, right?\n\n176\n00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,510\nIf I'm making changes to that system,\nall the sudden,\n\n177\n00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,260\nmy copy's not gonna validate\nagainst that original.\n\n178\n00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,150\nWhich is not gonna be a good thing\nif I'm trying to prove the validity\n\n179\n00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,560\nof my evidence.\n\n180\n00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,650\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n181\n00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,880\nAnd just to kind of prove\nthe point from another angle.\n\n182\n00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,880\nI was showing you here in the last\nsegment, showing you some of the demos of\n\n183\n00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,220\nwho logged into a system and\nprograms that were executed.\n\n184\n00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,890\nAnd like I said, that can be done on\npretty much any operating system out\n\n185\n00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,179\nthere, so\nwe're showing a Windows-centric view.\n\n186\n00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:48,680\nYou do something there, there is a record\nbeing kept so you have to remember that.\n\n187\n00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,700\nSo you shouldn't be, and I'll tell you,\none of the temptations that's gonna be\n\n188\n00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,540\njust like it was when you go\nto a physical crime scene.\n\n189\n00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,710\nYou're gonna want to start picking up\nstuff before you take pictures and\n\n190\n00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,090\ndocument everything appropriately.\n\n191\n00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,150\nOne of the things you're gonna want to\ndo is, you can easily get distracted and\n\n192\n00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,610\nstart clicking on things on a live system,\ngoing oh, look at this, and\n\n193\n00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,230\nlook at this, and opening folders,\nand looking for stuff.\n\n194\n00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,380\nNo, you don't do that.\n\n195\n00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,290\nYou know, that's Hollywood,\nthat's not reality.\n\n196\n00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,150\nLeave it alone until you've\ncaptured that all important image,\n\n197\n00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,560\nthen pry away to your heart's content.\n\n198\n00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,760\nWe have a couple copies.\n\n199\n00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,310\nYou screw one up doing that, fine,\ngo get, make a copy of the other copy and\n\n200\n00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,210\ndo it again.\n\n201\n00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,460\nThat's what they're there for.\n\n202\n00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,530\n>> All right, so\nwe've talked about dynamic.\n\n203\n00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,730\nWe've gotta make sure we're\ncapturing this live information,\n\n204\n00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,730\nit's definitely changing.\n\n205\n00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,370\nWe don't want to leave our mark.\n\n206\n00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,830\nAnd we've mentioned a couple times too.\n\n207\n00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,900\nAnd probably worth\nmentioning one more time.\n\n208\n00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,790\nGetting a record of the date and\n\n209\n00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,940\ntime that you're capturing this\ninformation, extremely important.\n\n210\n00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,440\n>> Yes.\n\n211\n00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,855\nWe don't even have to really expand on\nthat much more than just saying that you\n\n212\n00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:53,755\nneed that.\n\n213\n00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:55,895\nIt should be on your\nchain of custody forms.\n\n214\n00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:59,247\nIt should be on the tags you\nput on your evidence bags.\n\n215\n00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:00,975\nThere's paper, we didn't do it here,\n\n216\n00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:04,340\nthere's papers that go inside\nthe evidence bags themselves.\n\n217\n00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,450\nThat typically that say what's\nsupposed to be in there.\n\n218\n00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,090\nSo it just doesn't have that date and\nall that good stuff on it.\n\n219\n00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,510\nIt says hey, this is when it was sealed,\nand by whom.\n\n220\n00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,550\nBut this is who put that stuff in the bag,\nand\n\n221\n00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,980\nthis is what's supposed to be in that bag.\n\n222\n00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,590\nAnd you have the tags on the computer and\nall that.\n\n223\n00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,380\nIt goes with the electronic\nevidence you collect as well.\n\n224\n00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,780\nImages should all be recorded.\n\n225\n00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,930\nWhen they were done,\nwhat actions, when they were run.\n\n226\n00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,940\nAll those things should\nbe clearly documented.\n\n227\n00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,130\n>> Absolutely.\n\n228\n00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:37,860\nAll right, so\n\n229\n00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,750\nlook at our order of one of the first\nthings we take a look at is our memory.\n\n230\n00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,020\nWhat's in our random access\nmemory on our systems.\n\n231\n00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,945\nSeveral different ways we can go about\nthat, different tools we can use.\n\n232\n00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:53,925\n>> Think about all the stuff that\ntakes place in your physical RAM.\n\n233\n00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:56,465\nSo we're talking about\na Windows environment.\n\n234\n00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:00,583\nBut some of the stuff we're talking\nabout will easily apply to other systems\n\n235\n00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,107\nas well.\n\n236\n00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:05,985\nYou just have to kind of find how\nto do these things over there.\n\n237\n00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:10,457\nAnd all of you can figure those things out\nonce you know what you should be looking\n\n238\n00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:15,227\nfor, you can figure it out, what you need\nto look for, on a given operating system.\n\n239\n00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:17,687\nSo if you're a Linux user or\nsomething like that,\n\n240\n00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:21,157\nyou may already know the stuff off the top\nof your head, how to do it over there.\n\n241\n00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,007\nIf not, well, this type of stuff I'm doing\nhere, you've just gotta find an equivalent\n\n242\n00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:27,490\ncommand over on that side of the house and\nyou're good.\n\n243\n00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,260\nThe concept's still the same.\n\n244\n00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,630\nSo like I said, just think of\nwhat's being stored in memory,\n\n245\n00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,820\nwhat can you extract from that?\n\n246\n00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,051\nAnd I'd also tell you, be thinking\nabout when the system's running,\n\n247\n00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:43,670\nhow memory's being used.\n\n248\n00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,090\nThat's where that intimate\nknowledge of hardware and\n\n249\n00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,730\noperating systems come in, because you\nknow when you're using a computer,\n\n250\n00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,840\nnot everything runs in\nmemory 100% of the time.\n\n251\n00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,230\nIt gets put some place else,\nyou need to be thinking about that.\n\n252\n00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,520\nWhich is a topic on Windows\nthat we're gonna need to talk\n\n253\n00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,130\nabout because that does have\nsome significance to what we do.\n\n254\n00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:02,749\n>> Absolutely.\n\n255\n00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,230\nAbsolutely.\n\n256\n00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,090\nSo what are some of\nthe things we're looking for\n\n257\n00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,950\nwhen we're talking about memory analysis.\n\n258\n00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:14,050\nAnd we showed you in a previous episode,\nwe took a look at the WSCC,\n\n259\n00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,350\nand used a couple tools that did show us\nsome of those dynamic different measures.\n\n260\n00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,180\nSo really,\nthe same thing we're talking about here.\n\n261\n00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,980\n>> Yes, and we have tools,\n\n262\n00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,930\nyou can choose to use the WSCC, you can\nchoose to use something else if you want.\n\n263\n00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:31,550\nThat I'll leave to your\nown a judgement call,\n\n264\n00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,100\nto decide which one is the best one for\nyou to use.\n\n265\n00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,680\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to kind\nof run some of these tools over here.\n\n266\n00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,785\nI'm going to go to my other box over here.\n\n267\n00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:47,025\nAnd show you some of the other things\nthat you might consider grabbing.\n\n268\n00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:51,115\nThe first one that I would tell you\nit's in memory, we talked about this,\n\n269\n00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:55,185\nwhen we looked at WSCC, you can\ndefinitely still do it through there.\n\n270\n00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:58,675\nThis is a command called task list.\n\n271\n00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:00,965\nAnd task list does exactly that,\n\n272\n00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:05,210\nshowing all the tasks actively\nworking on that system.\n\n273\n00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,580\nWhat they are and how much memory and\nall that it's taking up.\n\n274\n00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:14,862\nThis is something that, boom, gets\nshuffled out to a file and held there.\n\n275\n00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:15,928\nCuz I have a capture,\n\n276\n00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:19,450\na static capture right now of\nwhat's going on in the system.\n\n277\n00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,970\nIf this isn't good enough for you, or\n\n278\n00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,880\nyou don't like the task list, fine.\n\n279\n00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,480\nWSCC has its own things as well.\n\n280\n00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,650\nAnd you could separate it out or\ndo other things.\n\n281\n00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,826\nWSSC had the nice process list\nwith all the fancy colors,\n\n282\n00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:40,020\nand GUI and all that on it.\n\n283\n00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,785\nAnd some people like to see that.\n\n284\n00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:45,250\nOkay, if that's what you like, go for it.\n\n285\n00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,703\nAs long as you know it's limitations and\nits capabilities,\n\n286\n00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:53,540\nfine, good on you,\nthat's the way to put it.\n\n287\n00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,840\nSo that's just one of the first\nthings that I might consider doing.\n\n288\n00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,050\nAnd remember, we're gonna talk about\ngathering stuff out of memory.\n\n289\n00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,390\nWith memory, as a whole,\nbeing very volatile.\n\n290\n00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,420\nThere's a lot of stuff that every\noperating system, not just Windows,\n\n291\n00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,460\nstores in memories.\n\n292\n00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,050\nSo you gotta think,\nwhen you're setting your goals,\n\n293\n00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,360\nwhen you come in to investigate\nthis specific system,\n\n294\n00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,700\nwhat things in memory are the first\nthings you want to go after?\n\n295\n00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,720\nYou know,\ndefinitely be thinking about those.\n\n296\n00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,060\nI mean, who knows,\nthese processes that you're running here,\n\n297\n00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:32,915\nto extract that information, do it enough\ntimes, it has to run in memory too.\n\n298\n00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:33,775\nDo it enough times.\n\n299\n00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:34,715\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it could actually\n\n300\n00:15:34,715 --> 00:15:36,025\nboot something else out of memory.\n\n301\n00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:38,735\nSo now you've left a mark and\nyou've lost something.\n\n302\n00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:42,834\nYou may actually have to go\nsome place else to get that.\n\n303\n00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:47,062\nI see Deborah mentioned dump it,\n\n304\n00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:51,290\ndid she get a copy of the outline?\n\n305\n00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,650\n>> Yeah she has been in\nmy brain all day long,\n\n306\n00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,500\none step ahead of me,\nthat's pretty amazing.\n\n307\n00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,259\nBut yeah, another great tool that\nallows me to do this kind of thing.\n\n308\n00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:06,143\n>> Yeah,\nDumpIt's another one that's designed to do\n\n309\n00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,147\nthis sort of similar type deal.\n\n310\n00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:13,040\nAnd you're welcome to use\nsomething like that as well.\n\n311\n00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,530\nI would encourage you\nto take a look at it,\n\n312\n00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,460\nsee if it's something more to your liking.\n\n313\n00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,730\nOr maybe you'll find out\nyou don't like it and\n\n314\n00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,750\nlike just being able to run\nspecific commands to get the stuff.\n\n315\n00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,729\nAs long as you get there,\nI could care less.\n\n316\n00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:27,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's really the way I look at it.\n\n317\n00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,500\n>> Yeah,\nI mean in the end that's the goal right?\n\n318\n00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,297\nIs to gather the evidence that we can use\nand do it in a way that doesn't leave\n\n319\n00:16:33,297 --> 00:16:37,560\na mark and is acceptable by the court\nsystems if we're going criminal.\n\n320\n00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,040\nSo in the end, whichever one works and\nsatisfies those needs is fine, right?\n\n321\n00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,665\n>> Yep.\n\n322\n00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:44,210\n>> Everybody's got their own opinion.\n\n323\n00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:49,230\nYou might have an agreement\nwith a certain company that\n\n324\n00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,750\nmakes several of these products and\nyou're trying to stick with them.\n\n325\n00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,250\nOr you might like the ones that\nare less expensive so, whichever one.\n\n326\n00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,880\nAnother one we can use, PowerShell.\n\n327\n00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,070\nPowerShell's a good one.\n\n328\n00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:06,900\n>> Yeah, PowerShell is one I just\nthought I would pay some lip service to,\n\n329\n00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,499\nwhy we're here.\n\n330\n00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,840\nI'm gonna kind of actually\nleave the actions of working\n\n331\n00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,170\nthrough with PowerShell to, I know\nthere's another course that's in ITPro.\n\n332\n00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,030\n>> We've got a few episodes dealing\nwith PowerShell, so we're covered there.\n\n333\n00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,192\nBut it is a relative\nnewcomer to the scene.\n\n334\n00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:25,771\nI mean it came out what, 2008?\n\n335\n00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:31,370\nServer 2008 and I believe it was in\nWindows Vista, if not it was in Windows 7.\n\n336\n00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,495\nBut extremely powerful\nas far as Windows goes.\n\n337\n00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:40,290\n>> Yes, it's a very powerful utility\nto create screw ups and stuff\n\n338\n00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:45,680\nlike that inside, and it's actually been\nfound to be very useful for forensics.\n\n339\n00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,400\nSo if you feel adventurous and\nyou happen to command a PowerShell,\n\n340\n00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,660\nthat's a utility you can use to\nextract information out of that box.\n\n341\n00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,380\nSo, it's definitely been used for\nthat already.\n\n342\n00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,700\nIn fact you may even find some\nscripts that are already made\n\n343\n00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,360\nspecifically to carry out\nactions through PowerShell.\n\n344\n00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,370\nIf that's the way you want to do it.\n\n345\n00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,350\nAnd I believe PowerShell,\nit was available all the way back to XP.\n\n346\n00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,010\nBut I don't know, I can't remember how-\n>> Did it come with XP?\n\n347\n00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,645\n>> Yeah, you had to install it-\n>> It might have, yeah.\n\n348\n00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,250\n>> After the fact.\n\n349\n00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,455\nBut I don't think it was as capable, and\n\n350\n00:18:19,455 --> 00:18:20,172\nnearly-\n>> Right,\n\n351\n00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:22,919\nno it's been added on every\naddition of Windows, and\n\n352\n00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,946\ndifferent updates have added on to it.\n\n353\n00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:27,783\nI mean, as far as Windows, and\nwe're not gonna cover Powershell here,\n\n354\n00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:30,545\nyou guys can watch our server episodes,\nor our Powershell episodes.\n\n355\n00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:34,380\nBut it is, I mean just about anything you\ncan do in Windows can now be done through\n\n356\n00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,480\nPowerShell and\nthey keep adding more and more.\n\n357\n00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,640\nAnd it's there, right?\n\n358\n00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,960\nIt's free, and\nit's on every Windows systems,\n\n359\n00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,029\nso it's a convenient choice, if just that.\n\n360\n00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:47,340\n>> Yeah, it's definitely there and\nit's something that, like I said,\n\n361\n00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,059\npeople in the field have been using.\n\n362\n00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:54,006\nBut if you go back too far in,\nDavid called out here, in XP and\n\n363\n00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:56,918\nVista, you'll have PowerShell.\n\n364\n00:18:56,918 --> 00:19:01,697\nYeah, XP was the first time I'd heard\nabout it and I installed it, but\n\n365\n00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:04,859\nit really didn't do all\nthat much at the time.\n\n366\n00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:09,052\nI think they put it in just to show\npeople, hey, this is what we're doing so\n\n367\n00:19:09,052 --> 00:19:10,650\nyou can get used to using it so\n\n368\n00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,530\nwhen it does do something more effective\nyou know the syntax and what to expect.\n\n369\n00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,550\nBut it's gonna be more useful now,\nas Mike said,\n\n370\n00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,610\nthey've added more stuff on to\nit over the last few releases.\n\n371\n00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,170\n>> And then we've got another one,\nit is ARP, right?\n\n372\n00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,690\nWe remember from, shoot,\nthis will probably go back to Network+.\n\n373\n00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,590\nARP is my Address Resolution Protocol.\n\n374\n00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,620\nIt's what IP calls upon when that packet\ngets to the local area network and\n\n375\n00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,770\nhas to do that final leg of the delivery.\n\n376\n00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,302\nIP calls upon ARP to convert that\nIP address into the MAC address for\n\n377\n00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:43,447\nthat last delivery.\n\n378\n00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:46,205\nAnd ARP is a protocol that\ndoes a lot by broadcast and\n\n379\n00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:48,790\nit's got a cache built into it, right?\n\n380\n00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:53,130\n>> Yes, it's got a cache that it builds\n\n381\n00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,478\nas the system is running and\nthat's useful to us.\n\n382\n00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:02,138\nIf you look at my screen,\nI just ran an ARP on my\n\n383\n00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:06,325\nscreen here, an ARP with a -a command.\n\n384\n00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:12,090\nAnd you could see it's showing some of\nthe stuff that's actually happened.\n\n385\n00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,645\nI mean,\nI'm not doing much on the system, so\n\n386\n00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:18,480\nit's not something that's\nreally earth shattering here.\n\n387\n00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,310\nBut on an active system that there was a\nlot of work and stuff like that going on,\n\n388\n00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:29,200\nthen yeah, you might actually wanna pull\nthis type of information off of a box.\n\n389\n00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,930\n>> Yeah we could possibly see what\nother machines that this machine was\n\n390\n00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,960\ntalking to recently.\n\n391\n00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,380\nYou might find a trace of a machine\nthat's no longer there, right?\n\n392\n00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,440\nI've got in the ARP entries, in that\nARP cache I can see an IP address and\n\n393\n00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,130\na MAC address, yet\nthat's nowhere to be found on this home\n\n394\n00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,490\nnetwork that I'm investigating\nwherever this crime scene is.\n\n395\n00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,650\nSo this could give me an indication\nthat hey, something's missing, right?\n\n396\n00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,060\nWe're missing a piece of our puzzle.\n\n397\n00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,840\n>> Yeah, the environment's been altered,\nexactly.\n\n398\n00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,380\nSomeone may have taken a network\ncard out or something.\n\n399\n00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,530\nSomeone may have brought their own\nhome computer into the workplace and\n\n400\n00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,905\nthat's what this belongs to.\n\n401\n00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:06,609\nBut you may want to use that to find\nwhen this is who it's talked to,\n\n402\n00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:08,210\nwhat system that was.\n\n403\n00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,320\nYou could possibly track it down for\n\n404\n00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,420\nthat plus other things,\nknowing who it's just talked to, period.\n\n405\n00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,450\nSo this is, again,\ngood information to capture.\n\n406\n00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,750\nAnd remember a lot of these tools that\nyou have in Windows for networking,\n\n407\n00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,500\nyou can dump the status of\ndifferent connections and caches.\n\n408\n00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,351\nAny of those are fair game.\n\n409\n00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:35,792\nThings like using the route command, that\nwould be fair game to use the DumpIts,\n\n410\n00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,832\nthe routing table information out.\n\n411\n00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:42,526\nYou've got just a lot of ones,\nyou can display what's in DNS,\n\n412\n00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:47,411\nall those things would be very,\nvery handy information to have.\n\n413\n00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:51,068\nEspecially if you think the person's doing\nsomething that's going off that computer.\n\n414\n00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:52,647\nSo there you go.\n\n415\n00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:56,455\n>> Pop quiz, while we're doing the rest of\nthis episode I wanna see who can type in\n\n416\n00:21:56,455 --> 00:21:58,254\nthe command to display my DNS cache.\n\n417\n00:21:58,254 --> 00:21:59,956\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n418\n00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:03,176\nanother one that we've seen in a previous\nsegment here, or previous episode, but\n\n419\n00:22:03,176 --> 00:22:05,810\nwe'll take a look again, netstat,\nor we'll talk about it again.\n\n420\n00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:12,610\nNetstat is another Windows utility\nthat reports back all my active ports.\n\n421\n00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,670\n>> Yes, that would be one I would\nalso consider running at this point.\n\n422\n00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,828\nWe ran it in our previous show and you\nsaw that it told you who was listening,\n\n423\n00:22:20,828 --> 00:22:25,258\nwhat connections were established,\nit read that out quite simply and easily.\n\n424\n00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:30,669\nAgain, that's useful for\ntelling us who we may be talking to.\n\n425\n00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:36,704\nAnd remember, that one also has, there's\nother real time equivalents as well so\n\n426\n00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:39,248\nyou can see who we're talking to.\n\n427\n00:22:39,248 --> 00:22:43,620\nAnd at that point when you see those sorts\nof things you might want to go to consider\n\n428\n00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,034\nsome point down the road,\n\n429\n00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:49,665\ndefinitely not on that live system, but on\nanother system maybe doing trace routes to\n\n430\n00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:53,638\nhim to see where those systems are if\nyou don't know where they are.\n\n431\n00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:58,350\nMaybe you could start getting an idea\nof where they actually exist, and\n\n432\n00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,430\nmaybe give you a clue\nof what was happening.\n\n433\n00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,223\nSo that would be the utility of that.\n\n434\n00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:06,746\n>> TCPview I think was that one that\nwe saw earlier that gave us the really\n\n435\n00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:07,910\ndynamic view of that.\n\n436\n00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,230\nAnd gold star for Deborah,\nshe got my DNS pop quiz there.\n\n437\n00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:17,610\nipconfig /displaydns,\nyou are correct, good job there.\n\n438\n00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,579\nNBT, or, I always say NBT, Nbstat?\n\n439\n00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,854\n>> Yeah-\n>> Or actually is it N, it's Nbtstat.\n\n440\n00:23:23,854 --> 00:23:24,922\n>> It's Nbtstat, yeah.\n\n441\n00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:26,920\n>> I was like wait a second,\nI'm losing my mind.\n\n442\n00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:33,450\nIt says Nbstat but yeah,\nNbtstat by NetBios over TCP/IP statistics.\n\n443\n00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,040\nAnother thing that we can look and\nsee what's going on.\n\n444\n00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,992\n>> Yeah, this is one that is going\nto potentially yield a lot more on\n\n445\n00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:45,130\nWindows systems than it\nwould any place else, okay?\n\n446\n00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:50,494\nSo if you go in an environment and\nyou know that NetBios is being used,\n\n447\n00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:55,130\nor it's an older environment,\nolder system especially.\n\n448\n00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,590\nIf you've got a 95, 98 or ME system.\n\n449\n00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,472\nYou know what?\nYou don't even have\n\n450\n00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:00,090\nto do the investigation.\n\n451\n00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,420\n>> [LAUGH] I know, right?\n\n452\n00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,450\n>> Just arrest the person for\nbeing stupid.\n\n453\n00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,100\nSo that's just my opinion.\n\n454\n00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,580\nBut if you see some of those systems,\nthat really rely heavy\n\n455\n00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:20,080\non NetBIOS, as Windows did very much,\nat one point, still installs by default.\n\n456\n00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,040\n>> Still fricking there, I know.\n\n457\n00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,150\nDrives me crazy.\n\n458\n00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,638\nBut I think, I've been teaching\nWindows Server since Windows 2000.\n\n459\n00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:30,300\nAnd in 2003, was when I've been, again,\n\n460\n00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,400\nstarted saying in class\nthat NetBIOS is going away.\n\n461\n00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,470\nHere it is, 2015,\nI still cannot say it's gone yet.\n\n462\n00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,985\nBut-\n>> I Just stopped saying that.\n\n463\n00:24:37,985 --> 00:24:40,330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The same thing.\n\n464\n00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,230\n>> The kudos for Windows.\n\n465\n00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,260\nI mean, backwards compatibility has\nalways been a big thing with Windows and\n\n466\n00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,650\nthat's why it's still there.\n\n467\n00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,600\nQuick shoutout to Scott, he got\nthe DNS answer for Linux so he's got\n\n468\n00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:57,170\nCAT, C A T, forward slash at\nC E T C forward slash resolve,\n\n469\n00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:01,580\nand just R E S O L, V.com.\n\n470\n00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:07,190\nDisplaying that DNS cache of recently\nresolved names on a Linux system.\n\n471\n00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,710\nSo we've got NBT stuff,\n\n472\n00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,530\nwe're looking at my NetBIOS over\nTCP/IP statistics, Tracert.\n\n473\n00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,400\nI think, we just mentioned a minute ago,\n\n474\n00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,250\ncould be dangerous to run\nfrom the live system itself.\n\n475\n00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,250\n>> Yeah, anything like this one,\nI'm investigating IP addresses or\n\n476\n00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,490\ninformation I get off the system.\n\n477\n00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,790\nI'm probably going to another system.\n\n478\n00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,490\nI'm running the tools for\n\n479\n00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,080\nyour demonstrative purposes and\nto show you guys what's going on.\n\n480\n00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,390\nI'm running them on this system and\ndoing other things on it, too.\n\n481\n00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,900\nIf this was the system that was\nthe target of the investigation.\n\n482\n00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,150\nIf I found an IP address,\n\n483\n00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,660\nsomething there that was suspicious,\nI would go to another system.\n\n484\n00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,500\nWhen that one's live,\nif I felt it necessary, and\n\n485\n00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,460\ncheck to see where that traced out to.\n\n486\n00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,090\nAnd run sort of more deeper\ninterrogation tools there.\n\n487\n00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:02,400\nRemember, you wanna have no or\nvery minimal interaction with that system.\n\n488\n00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,280\nSo we're already trying to kinda be\ncareful with the commands that we run.\n\n489\n00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,970\nAnd all the commands\nthat we're doing here,\n\n490\n00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,070\nplus there's other ones you\ncould throw into the mix.\n\n491\n00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,440\nAll those things will\nretrieve good information.\n\n492\n00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,200\nBut you may not want to run them all,\nbecause you would start filling up memory.\n\n493\n00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,530\nAnd trigger paging.\n\n494\n00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,740\nAnd stuff like that.\n\n495\n00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,305\nAnd then you're kind of up\nthe creek at that point.\n\n496\n00:26:25,305 --> 00:26:27,550\n>> [COUGH]\n>> So you want to be as careful\n\n497\n00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,210\nas possible.\n\n498\n00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,790\nSo yeah, you can have a system that\nyou do other investigations on.\n\n499\n00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,370\nWell remember,\n\n500\n00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,160\nwhat do we do when we talked about\ndesigning the lab a couple days ago?\n\n501\n00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,030\n>> We had four systems, I think.\n\n502\n00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,060\nWe had two of our Redundancy.\n\n503\n00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,500\nWe actually had two forensic stations.\n\n504\n00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,390\nAnd then, two workstations for\nthe employee to sit.\n\n505\n00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,100\nTo do his everyday stuff and\nthings like that.\n\n506\n00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,000\nSo, we've got other systems around.\n\n507\n00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,730\nAnd a lot of what we've seen so\nfar is returning results, lists of things.\n\n508\n00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,740\nWe start getting into tracers though,\nso now we're bouncing packets out.\n\n509\n00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,050\nAnd we're getting return data, right.\n\n510\n00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,260\nBecause it's bringing back information\nabout the route that this packet\n\n511\n00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,090\nhas taken.\n\n512\n00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,560\nWhich means that information is going\nto be cached somewhere on that machine.\n\n513\n00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,310\n>> There you go.\n\n514\n00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:09,020\n>> It's not just pulling up\na list of active processes.\n\n515\n00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,860\nIt's going out and\ngetting additional information.\n\n516\n00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,200\nInformation that wasn't on\nthe system before I touched it.\n\n517\n00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,710\nAnd that's what we're trying to avoid.\n\n518\n00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,450\nI don't want to leave any mark if I can.\n\n519\n00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,130\nSo we've got to watch that.\n\n520\n00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,110\nIP Config is another one that I\nshouldn't have to explain to anybody.\n\n521\n00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,760\nIf I do, go back and\nwatch our NetPlus episodes.\n\n522\n00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,310\nIP Config is how we get our TCP/IP\nConfiguration off of a Windows machine.\n\n523\n00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,570\nI'll let you guys throw\nout the Linux command.\n\n524\n00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,910\nI know you know it, but just for fun,\nsomebody type in our Linux command.\n\n525\n00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For that [COUGH] excuse me.\n\n526\n00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,590\nAnd there's several switches\nyou could use with IP Config\n\n527\n00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,460\nto get additional information,\nlike we just mentioned,\n\n528\n00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,500\nat display DNS,\nto look at that DNS resolver cache.\n\n529\n00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,400\nBut just to get your basic TCPIP,\nfor the most part.\n\n530\n00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,460\n>> Yup, that's what it's meant for, is to\nget the configuration of the IP stack.\n\n531\n00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,620\nAnd so, that would be information to\nalso note and write down if there's any\n\n532\n00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,500\nquestion as to how something was\nconfigured at a certain point and time.\n\n533\n00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,100\n>> Yeah, you might find another network\nadapter in there that you didn't know\n\n534\n00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,840\nexisted, or a wireless adapter.\n\n535\n00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,240\nSee what networks they're connected to and\nthings like that.\n\n536\n00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,010\nYou might have to find another\nadapter that was statically mapped for\n\n537\n00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,960\nsome other network.\n\n538\n00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,980\nWhere is that network?\n\n539\n00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,350\nWhy did they have it statically mapped?\n\n540\n00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,240\nSo again, just gathering information.\n\n541\n00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,430\nAnd the one that I'm not familiar\nwith Sean, are Dump by T?\n\n542\n00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n543\n00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:33,700\nDump by T, or Dump It is something\nthat kind of does what it sounds like.\n\n544\n00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,080\nIt just takes everything in memory and\nthrows it into a file.\n\n545\n00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,320\nThat's what you've got.\n\n546\n00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,310\nAnd it's not the only tool that does that,\nbut\n\n547\n00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:44,190\nit's one of many that will take the stuff\nout of memory and just dump in there.\n\n548\n00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,840\nYou gotta remember, however,\n\n549\n00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,455\nif you use something like that, the\ninformation getting dumped out of memory\n\n550\n00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:56,585\nmay not be useable because it may\nvery well be in a raw format.\n\n551\n00:28:56,585 --> 00:29:00,082\nSo, you're may going to be in a situation\nwhere you have to go through and\n\n552\n00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:03,912\ndo string searches like that\nto find pieces of information.\n\n553\n00:29:03,912 --> 00:29:08,782\nSo, its done as something you can use as a\nprecaution to capture that and reload it,\n\n554\n00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:10,002\nto take a look at it.\n\n555\n00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:15,582\nBut you may end up doing a string\nsearch of that file that it dumps to\n\n556\n00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:21,710\nsee if it has what you want in it.\n\n557\n00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,200\nAnd then, the last thing we want to talk\nabout here in this segment is, you know,\n\n558\n00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,010\nwhere we can find volatile information.\n\n559\n00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,170\nOr where this information can hide.\n\n560\n00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,410\nWe've been talking about random\naccess memory primarily, but\n\n561\n00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:34,120\nthere are other places we need\nto make sure we're looking.\n\n562\n00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,900\n>> Yeah.\nThere's always places for\n\n563\n00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,710\nstuff to hide on, you know,\non any operating system.\n\n564\n00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,458\nWindows is no different, in that respect.\n\n565\n00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:46,010\nWindows actually maybe one of the ones\nthat has more places for stuff to hide.\n\n566\n00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:49,940\nSo you've got to have all these utilities\nand stuff like that to find it.\n\n567\n00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:56,290\nYou know, one of the ones, we did see\nit yesterday, is the Autopsy Kit.\n\n568\n00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:01,900\nAutopsy offers us something really nice\nwhen we're analyzing a Windows System,\n\n569\n00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,660\nis that if we image a system and once\nwe're done doing our live collection and\n\n570\n00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,180\nall that.\n\n571\n00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,500\nAnd we create the images of the system.\n\n572\n00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,090\nWe can browse that image using autopsy.\n\n573\n00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,505\nAnd we can actually open up the page file.\n\n574\n00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:17,155\nAnd you can start looking through it.\n\n575\n00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:22,255\nBut again,\nthat page file is something that is\n\n576\n00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:25,415\nthe way the information is\ndistributed in there and chunked up.\n\n577\n00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:28,935\nAnd all that inside the file, it probably\nis going to mean that you're going to have\n\n578\n00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:32,385\nto do some sort of search for strings and\nget little fragments of things in there.\n\n579\n00:30:32,385 --> 00:30:36,220\nAnd you may end up having to put a lot\nof puzzle pieces together to reconstruct\n\n580\n00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,100\nsomething, if you even have\nall the pieces anymore.\n\n581\n00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,190\nAnd as Eric said here,\nthe hibernation file,\n\n582\n00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:47,160\nthat could be another really good target\ncuz that's a memory dump as well.\n\n583\n00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,120\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n584\n00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,450\nEspecially with Windows nowadays and their\nhybrid sleep states and things like that.\n\n585\n00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,950\nIt's always creating those hiberfil.sys\nfiles, so that if you close the lid and\n\n586\n00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,680\nit goes to sleep.\n\n587\n00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,510\nYou can open it back-up and\n[INAUDIBLE] computer goes to sleep.\n\n588\n00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,090\nYou can open it back-up, and everything\nis right there where you left it.\n\n589\n00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:05,120\nSo, that definitely is storing some\ninformation that might be relevant.\n\n590\n00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,280\nI think, Eric mentioned pagefile.sys,\nthat's our page file typically when we're\n\n591\n00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,790\nlooking at Windows,\nit's known as page file dot sys.\n\n592\n00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,970\nAnyway, and then other temp files.\n\n593\n00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,100\nA lot of our applications have temp\nfiles too that we have to deal with,\n\n594\n00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,257\nlike our browsers.\n\n595\n00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:26,745\n>> You maybe able to recover stuff\nout of some temp files, not all.\n\n596\n00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:29,855\nYou know, some temp files are just so\nscrambled and\n\n597\n00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:33,265\nthe stuff they have inside of it,\nit's beyond being actually useful.\n\n598\n00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:36,930\nIt's degraded enough at that point\nwhere it's not really useful.\n\n599\n00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:41,160\nBut you might actually\ntake a chance at it.\n\n600\n00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,384\nI know some applications that\nwould actually, when it runs,\n\n601\n00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,550\nthey create a duplicate of the file and\nthen, run it off one.\n\n602\n00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,500\nAnd then,\nthey consolidate it after the fact.\n\n603\n00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,389\nSo you could actually get\na copy Of a file, and\n\n604\n00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:57,740\nstart doing stuff with it.\n\n605\n00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,910\nA cool thin about it also,\nis this temp files.\n\n606\n00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,790\nWhen you have temp files for\nan application,\n\n607\n00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,900\nif it does do stuff where it creates\na copy, and then works on something.\n\n608\n00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,340\nAnd then, it consolidates the changes.\n\n609\n00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:14,610\nYou might be able to do a scan of\nthe system and recover those files.\n\n610\n00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,320\nIn which case, you may be able\nto recover a good copy of that.\n\n611\n00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,030\n>> Wow.\n>> So there's little things like that,\n\n612\n00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:25,190\nand even interestingly enough,\nEFS if it's not implemented correctly.\n\n613\n00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,990\nEFS is a Windowsism that if\nyou're not aware encrypts files\n\n614\n00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:36,785\nat the file system level, or it can\nencrypt folders at the file system level.\n\n615\n00:32:36,785 --> 00:32:41,685\nMicrosoft gives you the ability to do\nencrypt the whole folder or just the file.\n\n616\n00:32:41,685 --> 00:32:45,015\nAnd the thing is if you encrypt\njust the file, it's bad practice.\n\n617\n00:32:45,015 --> 00:32:50,015\nYou can encrypt a file and\nprotect it, but once you go\n\n618\n00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:55,115\ninto use that file to access it,\nit has to decrypt it.\n\n619\n00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:57,370\nSo it actually will decrypt the file.\n\n620\n00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,060\nAnd have it there for you to work\non while you're doing your stuff.\n\n621\n00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,450\nAnd when you're done,\nit will stick it back in there.\n\n622\n00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,550\nWell, all I've got to do is if you have\nit implemented that way where you have\n\n623\n00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,910\nencrypted the whole folder.\n\n624\n00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,100\nWhat happens is that copy\nyou've made is unencrypted.\n\n625\n00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,720\nAnd when it erases it and\n\n626\n00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,400\nputs the copies back in encrypted format,\nthat's still there.\n\n627\n00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,190\nIt's just been erased.\n\n628\n00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:21,180\nAll I have to do is just do\na file recovery and grab that.\n\n629\n00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:26,890\nAnd I now have your file that you\nencrypted it for me in that sense.\n\n630\n00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,750\nSo, that's why tell you don't\never encrypt at the file level.\n\n631\n00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,870\nDo it at a folder level because\nit makes it much safer.\n\n632\n00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,840\nAnd we've got ways, by the way, of dealing\nwith EFS just in case you are one of those\n\n633\n00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,420\nones that thinks that EFS is impenetrable,\nor they acted as a barrier.\n\n634\n00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,280\nOr, you run into someone\nthat thinks it's that way.\n\n635\n00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,390\nYeah, it's already been thought of.\n\n636\n00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,245\nWe can break that.\n\n637\n00:33:49,245 --> 00:33:50,880\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n638\n00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,080\nWell, looking at the clock, ladies and\ngentlemen, it's about time for\n\n639\n00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,790\nus to take our break.\n\n640\n00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,100\nSo we're going to step away.\n\n641\n00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,280\nAnd when we come back, we'll continue\non with our Windows Forensics.\n\n642\n00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,320\nSo stay tuned.\n\n643\n00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,760\nWe'll be right back.\n\n644\n00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:07,108\n[SOUND]\nAll right.\n\n645\n00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:08,440\nWelcome back, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n646\n00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,505\nSo continuing on with our\nWindows forensics episode.\n\n647\n00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:15,245\nGetting ready to talk now\nabout collecting non-volatile.\n\n648\n00:34:15,245 --> 00:34:18,425\nThe first part of the show we talked\na lot about the volatile types\n\n649\n00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:20,405\nof areas we need to look and\ntry to gather information,\n\n650\n00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:23,745\nsome of the different tools or\ntechniques we can use to do that.\n\n651\n00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:26,565\nNow, we wanna take a look\nat the non-volatile side.\n\n652\n00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,375\nIf we had a live system,\nthen we've gone through and\n\n653\n00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:33,290\ngathered all the stuff that it\ncould potentially disappear.\n\n654\n00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,930\nRight?\n>> Yes.\n\n655\n00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:38,490\n>> Now, we can maybe start pulling\na hard drive out, and doing our imaging.\n\n656\n00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,450\nIs that next?\n\n657\n00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,920\n>> Yes.\nYou may have already had a live system,\n\n658\n00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,300\nand gotten to the point where you've\ngotten all the live information,\n\n659\n00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,810\nthat volatile stuff off the system.\n\n660\n00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:50,770\nAnd now, you feel that you can safely\nshut it down and image the drive.\n\n661\n00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:56,120\nOr, you may have approached the system at\nthis point, it was just a dead system.\n\n662\n00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,580\nYou could be doing either\none of those situations.\n\n663\n00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,540\nYou may not have had to collect any\nlive data, is what we're saying.\n\n664\n00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,655\nIt may have been that part of it, may not.\n\n665\n00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:06,595\nBut, what we are gonna\ndo now is we are gonna\n\n666\n00:35:06,595 --> 00:35:09,815\ndiscuss that imaging is\nthe next part of it.\n\n667\n00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:12,905\nThat's what you would expect\nto actually do at that point.\n\n668\n00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:15,642\nYou would need to grab\nstuff off that drive.\n\n669\n00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:18,622\n>> And we've already kind of\nhit it in our previous episode.\n\n670\n00:35:18,622 --> 00:35:21,472\nWhere we talked about data acquisition,\n\n671\n00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,162\nand we talked about\ncapturing these images.\n\n672\n00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:27,272\nAnd that there are different\ntypes of image capturing\n\n673\n00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:29,432\nprocesses that we can go through.\n\n674\n00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:32,732\n>> Yes,\njust remember we did talk about it.\n\n675\n00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:38,595\nWe talked about generic system forensics,\nand duplication of data and imaging.\n\n676\n00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,410\nWell, all those things would apply here.\n\n677\n00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,390\nYou have the bitstream or\nbit-to-bit copies they sometimes call it.\n\n678\n00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,350\nThat tends to be the safest way\nto go if you're not sure which\n\n679\n00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,850\nbucket you fall into.\n\n680\n00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,900\nThat tends to be the safest\none you want to use.\n\n681\n00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:59,300\nThen, you have the filesystem level ones\nwhere you can do just a file level image.\n\n682\n00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,180\nIf that works for you, hey, great.\n\n683\n00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,160\nMake sure that you're gonna do that.\n\n684\n00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,690\nAnd then, you've got stuff where\nyou can do sparse images, and\n\n685\n00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,420\neven graph application\nlevel data if you want.\n\n686\n00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,580\nSo there's all different levels.\n\n687\n00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,460\nI do wanna talk about this.\n\n688\n00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,210\nThis guy's yelling at me.\n\n689\n00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,460\nLook at this.\n>> I saw that.\n\n690\n00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,650\n>> G is yelling at me, dog.\n\n691\n00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,930\nAll right, so, that's a good-\n>> That's a good questions though.\n\n692\n00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,118\nLet's say we're done collecting\nthat volatile information.\n\n693\n00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:33,780\nAnd now, we're going to shut the system\ndown so I can pull the drive out and\n\n694\n00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,030\ndo my imaging.\n\n695\n00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,380\nDo I power down through\nthe start menu on Windows?\n\n696\n00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,005\nOr, do I hold that power button\ndown until the system shuts down?\n\n697\n00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:43,235\nOr, do I yank the cord?\n\n698\n00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:44,665\nOr, does it really matter?\n\n699\n00:36:44,665 --> 00:36:49,325\n>> No, that's a very, very good\nquestion as to which way do you go.\n\n700\n00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:52,865\nDo you just shut it down normally,\nor do you pull the plug?\n\n701\n00:36:52,865 --> 00:36:55,020\nAnd in this case, you do pull the plug.\n\n702\n00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,605\nYeah, cuz you dont' want Windows to go\nthrough its normal shutdown process.\n\n703\n00:36:58,605 --> 00:36:59,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n704\n00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,913\nYeah.\nIf it starts going through the normal shut\n\n705\n00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:02,170\ndown process.\n\n706\n00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,290\nYou know from being an IT, that there's\na lot of nonsense and stuff like that with\n\n707\n00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,550\nWindows going on during the shutdown\nprocess and dumping stuff to the drive.\n\n708\n00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,612\nOf cleaning stuff up and\ndoing all of those things.\n\n709\n00:37:12,612 --> 00:37:16,440\nYou wanna avoid that, just like you\nwant to avoid when you image the drive.\n\n710\n00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,260\nYou don't want to image it in\nthe system unless you really have to.\n\n711\n00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,930\nThere are options that you can\nimage it in the system, but\n\n712\n00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,400\nwhen you turn Windows on, same thing.\n\n713\n00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,450\nIt has a whole process it goes\nthrough before you get to do anything.\n\n714\n00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,690\nYeah.\nSo, in this case, yes.\n\n715\n00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,230\nIf you have a live system and\n\n716\n00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,920\nyou are going to be imaging that,\nplug get's yanked.\n\n717\n00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,130\nNo graceful-\n>> Yank the plug and\n\n718\n00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,480\nthat gives Windows no chance to do\nanything, or change anything or\n\n719\n00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,810\nmake any modifications.\n\n720\n00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,130\nAnd then, we remove the drive and\nput it in some type of sled or\n\n721\n00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:47,990\nsomething that we're using.\n\n722\n00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,510\nWe're powering it externally,\n\n723\n00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,578\nnot through the system itself cuz I\ndon't want to start Windows back up.\n\n724\n00:37:52,578 --> 00:37:55,010\n>> Yes, you wanna avoid that at all costs.\n\n725\n00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:01,500\nYou just want to image the system\nin some sort of hardware solution.\n\n726\n00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,920\nTheres also somewhere you can\nleave the drive in the system.\n\n727\n00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,190\nParabin has one.\n\n728\n00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,980\nIt's a stick that's a USB drive you\ncan pop in there and boot off of it.\n\n729\n00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,360\nAnd it will dump stuff out into\na image right off the system.\n\n730\n00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,921\nYou might have something\nlike this like a notebook.\n\n731\n00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:22,790\nYou can pull the drive out of it to\nbe sure, but it may not be as easy or\n\n732\n00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,000\nconvenient to do.\n\n733\n00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,660\nSo, you can use one of these sticks\njust to pop it in the USB drive,\n\n734\n00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,860\nand pop in a external drive.\n\n735\n00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,400\nAnd then, go ahead and\ngo about the imaging process that way.\n\n736\n00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,220\nSo, that's always an option for you too.\n\n737\n00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,910\nAnd it also, I think they're stick\nalso has some other tools for\n\n738\n00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,190\ndoing analysis on the drive.\n\n739\n00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:47,010\nI can't remember off top of my head,\nbut that's there, too, you can do that.\n\n740\n00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,080\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n741\n00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,510\nAnd it's a good question, G.\n\n742\n00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:53,272\nAnd no problem with the caps lock there,\nit happens.\n\n743\n00:38:53,272 --> 00:38:53,940\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n744\n00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,740\n>> All right, so back then to our imaging.\n\n745\n00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,180\nWe got the bit to bit,\nor bit by bit image,\n\n746\n00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,680\nwhere I know we talked about that earlier.\n\n747\n00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,600\nThat's where I'm just gonna get every\nsingle one and zero on that drive.\n\n748\n00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,480\nIrregardless of, I know that's not a word,\nI always say that.\n\n749\n00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,390\nRegardless of whether it doesn't\nreally care about files are there or\n\n750\n00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,060\nanything like that.\n\n751\n00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,730\nWhere one file starts,\nwhere one file ends.\n\n752\n00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,890\nIt's just streaming out those bits,\nmaking an exact copy.\n\n753\n00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,860\nAnother kind we can do is the file system-\n>> Yep.\n\n754\n00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,060\n>> Type imaging process,\nwhere it does recognize the files.\n\n755\n00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,170\nIt's more of a logical type capture,\nright?\n\n756\n00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,160\n>> Yeah, it's capturing stuff\nat the file system level,\n\n757\n00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,630\nit's not getting down to\nthat bit by bit stuff.\n\n758\n00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:36,790\nAnd again, just to reiterate, if you\ngo with one versus the other on any.\n\n759\n00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,270\nA bit stream over any of the other ones,\nbit stream gets everything.\n\n760\n00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:44,858\nSo that leaves the option open for\nyou to do, with any operating system for\n\n761\n00:39:44,858 --> 00:39:47,750\nthat matter,\ndo things like we talked about.\n\n762\n00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,759\nFile carving as well as search for,\ndo file recovery and search for\n\n763\n00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:53,630\nfiles that have been deleted.\n\n764\n00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,290\nRemember one of the things that we had\ntalked about early on in the week,\n\n765\n00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,425\nremember the LNK files, the link files,\n\n766\n00:39:59,425 --> 00:40:02,000\nthose will be plastered\nall over the drive.\n\n767\n00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,120\nThose get created and deleted by\nWindows in the background all the time.\n\n768\n00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,270\nSo if you want to see what this person\ndocuments and stuff like that this person\n\n769\n00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,660\nmay have been opening, well, this is\none way to just go ahead and do it.\n\n770\n00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:18,604\nIs just do a bit by bit copy, and then do\na file recovery of those selected pieces,\n\n771\n00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:22,459\nand then you can maybe figure out\nmore of what they were doing and\n\n772\n00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:24,872\nwhat was happening on that system.\n\n773\n00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:29,340\n>> Right, whereas my file system image is\ngonna not get all that information right.\n\n774\n00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:33,601\nWe're gonna miss any deleted files or\nfragments, link files and\n\n775\n00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:34,849\nthings like that.\n\n776\n00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,508\nBut in some scenarios we're\nnot worried about that right?\n\n777\n00:40:37,508 --> 00:40:42,003\nIf we're just trying to gather evidence\nmaybe that exists as a file on\n\n778\n00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:43,490\nthat system.\n\n779\n00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,550\nI'm not worried about going in quite\nthat deep then, then maybe that's fine.\n\n780\n00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,830\n>> Yeah.\nIt's how deep you wanna go and\n\n781\n00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,610\nwhat information you wanna get.\n\n782\n00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:56,060\nIt's also, by the way,\nanother reason I should mention is\n\n783\n00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,800\nthat reason why you wipe drives that\nyou're collecting this information to.\n\n784\n00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,880\nBecause if you're just dumping files onto\na drive to do a file system image and\n\n785\n00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,120\ndump it into a drive and\nyou haven't forensically wiped it.\n\n786\n00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,680\nYou could still have deleted files from\nthe previous investigation on there and\n\n787\n00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,800\nnow you're mixing different cases,\nin which case when you mix\n\n788\n00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,810\nthose different situations they're\ngonna start calling into question\n\n789\n00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:30,150\npretty quickly when they find out that\nthis is one case and this is another.\n\n790\n00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,330\nWhy didn't you sanitize your media?\n\n791\n00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:35,690\nSo it just kinda illustrates something\nelse when you're dumping images,\n\n792\n00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,510\nto moving images around and\nsanitizing media and all that good stuff.\n\n793\n00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,830\n>> Yeah, not gonna look very professional.\n\n794\n00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,890\nAnd probably not gonna hold up in\na court of law if you go in there and\n\n795\n00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:43,800\nsay, oh, yeah.\n\n796\n00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,977\nNever mind that one,\nthat was from a previous case.\n\n797\n00:41:45,977 --> 00:41:46,615\nYeah.\n\n798\n00:41:46,615 --> 00:41:47,219\n>> Yeah.\n\n799\n00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:48,311\n>> Not gonna fly.\n\n800\n00:41:48,311 --> 00:41:52,030\nAnother type of image that\nwe can do is sparse imaging.\n\n801\n00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:56,100\n>> Yeah, we were talking about the sparse\none, just remember that is an option,\n\n802\n00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,650\nit may be even more of an option now when\nyou are talking about people hosting\n\n803\n00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,890\nstuff out in the cloud,\nyou need to capture a segment of data.\n\n804\n00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,560\nOr you have a few files on\na file server you need to grab,\n\n805\n00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,140\na sparse image might be that\nif they provision that server\n\n806\n00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,320\nto be a certain way or\nthat space to be a certain way.\n\n807\n00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,520\nThis may be the only way you can really,\n\n808\n00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,770\nreally accomplish the task\nof grabbing just that piece.\n\n809\n00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,731\n>> Absolutely.\nIn a corporate environment shared storage,\n\n810\n00:42:23,731 --> 00:42:28,682\nmaybe I don't wanna get other employees'\ninformation or especially in criminal\n\n811\n00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:32,842\ncases where I have to go out to some\nthird party like cloud providers or\n\n812\n00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,301\nsomething like that, multi-tenant.\n\n813\n00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:39,313\nAs Sean has said many times,\nwarrants are typically very specific for\n\n814\n00:42:39,313 --> 00:42:43,053\nwhat you're looking for and\nwhat you're allowed to retrieve and\n\n815\n00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:45,712\nI've got to make sure\nI'm getting just that.\n\n816\n00:42:45,712 --> 00:42:50,074\nAnd I've got all kinds of privacy concerns\nand things like that if I start gathering\n\n817\n00:42:50,074 --> 00:42:53,910\ninformation that doesn't,\nis not pertaining to the actual case.\n\n818\n00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,530\nI can't go to Amazon Web Services and\njust say, give me a copy of your drive or\n\n819\n00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,890\nsomething like that.\n\n820\n00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,938\n>> Won't fly.\n>> It's just not gonna work.\n\n821\n00:42:59,938 --> 00:43:00,519\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n822\n00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:03,677\nSo I've gotta, and\nthat's where the sparse imaging comes in.\n\n823\n00:43:03,677 --> 00:43:07,880\nWe can be very specific about what\nwe're trying to capture an image of.\n\n824\n00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,130\n>> Mm-hm, absolutely.\n\n825\n00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,215\n>> All right, and\nthen at application level.\n\n826\n00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,315\n>> Yeah,\n\n827\n00:43:14,315 --> 00:43:19,155\nthat would be what we consider just\ngetting stuff with a specific application.\n\n828\n00:43:19,155 --> 00:43:21,155\nIt's kinda sorta create an image, but\n\n829\n00:43:21,155 --> 00:43:24,254\nit's just grabbing stuff\nspecific to a given application.\n\n830\n00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:28,824\nMaybe that application was the target\nof some malware manipulation,\n\n831\n00:43:28,824 --> 00:43:32,857\nthat might be a reason why you\nuse an application level image.\n\n832\n00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:36,371\nIs that you just wanna target just that\nbecause it's the only thing that's\n\n833\n00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:38,400\nthe subject of this investigation.\n\n834\n00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,660\n>> Yeah, and we might wanna go into that\nroaming app data or something like that.\n\n835\n00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,420\nApplications have their temp locations\nthat they use and things like that.\n\n836\n00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,780\nSo, we could get just that or start\ndumping just those areas of memory or\n\n837\n00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,398\nsomething.\n\n838\n00:43:49,398 --> 00:43:50,036\n>> Yes.\n\n839\n00:43:50,036 --> 00:43:51,337\n>> [COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n840\n00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,300\nAll right, so we've got all kind\nof different imaging process.\n\n841\n00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,870\nDepending on what the scenario calls for,\n\n842\n00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:01,530\nwe've got different options to choose\nfrom, whatever best suits our needs.\n\n843\n00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:05,370\nLive and dead analysis, we've kind\nof talked about this a little bit.\n\n844\n00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,030\nWell, let's see.\n\n845\n00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,892\nAre we talking live and\ndead as far as the system goes,\n\n846\n00:44:08,892 --> 00:44:10,810\nor the hardware, the hard drives?\n\n847\n00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,850\n>> Well, we say live and dead,\nit really applies to what the condition of\n\n848\n00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:19,100\nthe system is that was the original\nsubject of the investigation.\n\n849\n00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,830\nWhat state it was in when\nwe initially approached it.\n\n850\n00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:24,050\n>> Live being a system that's turned on or\ncurrently powered on,\n\n851\n00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:26,730\ndead being a system that's shut down or\npowered down.\n\n852\n00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,600\n>> Yes, that's what that refers to.\n\n853\n00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,400\nTypically we don't use it, those terms,\n\n854\n00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,300\ntoo much outside of that specific\nenvironment or that specific setting.\n\n855\n00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,210\nThat this system was on,\nthis system wasn't.\n\n856\n00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:41,630\nThis is live, this is dead, or\nstatic if you want to use that.\n\n857\n00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,995\n>> And then you've got,\nPowerShell we've talked about,\n\n858\n00:44:43,995 --> 00:44:46,455\nanother fantastic tool we can\nuse in our Windows systems.\n\n859\n00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:49,755\n>> Yeah, you can't stress that enough,\nis that PowerShell can be used in a live\n\n860\n00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:51,935\nenvironment, can be used\nin this environment too.\n\n861\n00:44:51,935 --> 00:44:54,075\nNo matter what state\nyou find the system in,\n\n862\n00:44:54,075 --> 00:44:58,165\nif it's a Windows system,\nyou do have that option available to you.\n\n863\n00:44:58,165 --> 00:45:01,925\nAnd I said,\nPowerShell is a very wonderful tool\n\n864\n00:45:01,925 --> 00:45:05,590\nto do all sorts of\ninteresting stuff with it.\n\n865\n00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:09,470\nAnd you can find scripts online to\ndo some of this forensic stuff with.\n\n866\n00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,210\nThey've already been\ncreated ahead of time.\n\n867\n00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,400\n>> Yeah, and that's fantastic, cuz now we\ncan start automating some of that stuff.\n\n868\n00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,560\nAnd you guys know from other\nWindows classes that we've done, or\n\n869\n00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,765\nWindows episodes we've done,\nyou could run like Windows PE, for\n\n870\n00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:23,665\nexample, live from a thumb drive or\nsomething.\n\n871\n00:45:23,665 --> 00:45:25,525\nIt could have PowerShell\nloaded up on there,\n\n872\n00:45:25,525 --> 00:45:27,715\ngive me the access to those scripts.\n\n873\n00:45:27,715 --> 00:45:32,069\nAnd I can walk up to a system, pop that in\nand start that script process running and\n\n874\n00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:35,820\nthen come back and\nhave all that information waiting for us.\n\n875\n00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:40,440\nSo love it when I can automate it,\nalways good, always good.\n\n876\n00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,610\nRegistry analysis,\n\n877\n00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:45,360\nanother place in Windows that we can\ngo to find all kinds of information.\n\n878\n00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,910\nWe're familiar, at this point in our\ncareers, with what the registry is in\n\n879\n00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:52,624\nWindows where all of those setting\nare stored, and our hardware profiles, and\n\n880\n00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,911\nour user profiles or our settings I\nshould say, and things like that.\n\n881\n00:45:55,911 --> 00:45:57,415\nSo, a lot of good information there, so\n\n882\n00:45:57,415 --> 00:45:59,930\nwe need to be able to make\nsure that we can access that.\n\n883\n00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,850\n>> Yes, and this is a cool thing.\n\n884\n00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:05,440\nSo, the registry has been around,\nit's been around since Windows 95.\n\n885\n00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,520\nIt's been around for so long that there\nare a lot of viewers available for it.\n\n886\n00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,400\nSome of them the old days will\nstill work and are still used, and\n\n887\n00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,870\nthen you have modern ones\nthat are more full featured.\n\n888\n00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:20,020\nI mean, Regedit probably hasn't changed\nall that much since it originally was\n\n889\n00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,610\nintroduced all those eons ago.\n\n890\n00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:26,260\nNow we have other things that can\ndo analysis of the registry, and\n\n891\n00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,400\nhelp us navigate things easier.\n\n892\n00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,560\nIf you go through and look at the WSCC,\n\n893\n00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,970\nit actually has things that can go\nthrough and look at the registry.\n\n894\n00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:37,850\nBut it has them.\n\n895\n00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,550\nIt can look at them, and\nmanipulate them in all different ways.\n\n896\n00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,500\nIt, in fact, has things that\nwill look at the shell bags,\n\n897\n00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,430\nwhich is a collection\nof registry settings.\n\n898\n00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:49,480\nIt will specifically collect those\n\n899\n00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,890\nin discrete compartments that allow you\nto go through them and expand just those.\n\n900\n00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:57,790\nSo, there's a lot of neat little tools for\nanalyzing the registry and\n\n901\n00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:01,020\nlooking for changes or\nthings that might be suspect.\n\n902\n00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,040\nBut it should be something that is\n\n903\n00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,350\nup on your list as far as something\nthat you're gonna be investigating.\n\n904\n00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,320\nYour registry,\nyou may actually wanna consider\n\n905\n00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,870\ninvestigating that when you're doing\nyour live analysis as a matter of fact.\n\n906\n00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:21,770\nIf this system was live at one point,\nbefore you got to this static imaging,\n\n907\n00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:25,710\nyou might want to consider grabbing\nthe registry at that point of systems on.\n\n908\n00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,740\nThat's kinda your call,\nif you think there's USB information or\n\n909\n00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:34,290\napplication information hiding out in\nthe registry, then by all means grab it.\n\n910\n00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,960\nIt's easy enough to do while you're there.\n\n911\n00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,500\n>> Yeah, absolutely, might as well just\ngrab a quick backup of that thing,\n\n912\n00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,552\nbecause that thing, it does change right?\n\n913\n00:47:41,552 --> 00:47:45,445\nAnd, again, we talked about how if it's a\nlive system we're gonna pull a plug on it\n\n914\n00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,504\nand try to prevent any of those changes,\nbut\n\n915\n00:47:47,504 --> 00:47:50,420\nthat's one of the things we can\nprevent by pulling that plug.\n\n916\n00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,107\nNot only changes to the hard drive and\nthings like that, but\n\n917\n00:47:53,107 --> 00:47:54,300\nchanges to the registry.\n\n918\n00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,050\nThink back to your Windows training.\n\n919\n00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,800\nOur last known good gets written in or\nmodified.\n\n920\n00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,122\nAll that stuff about any settings that you\nhave made or that user had made before\n\n921\n00:48:05,122 --> 00:48:08,526\nthey had logged off has to get\nwritten back to the registry, so\n\n922\n00:48:08,526 --> 00:48:10,790\nit can load that up the next time.\n\n923\n00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:11,960\nA lot of information there.\n\n924\n00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,330\nDynamic information.\n\n925\n00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:15,610\nThat we wanna make sure we\nget a quick capture of.\n\n926\n00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,740\nAll right.\nSo we got our registry analysis.\n\n927\n00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,140\nWe mentioned reg edit,\nreg view is an older one that might or\n\n928\n00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,480\nmight not still work depending,\nI know it worked up to Windows XP.\n\n929\n00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,850\nI think they stopped developing it.\n\n930\n00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,290\nBut it still might work.\n\n931\n00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:32,640\nCuz again the registry, like you said,\nhasn't changed a lot until later.\n\n932\n00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,540\nWhen we get into Windows 7,\n\n933\n00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:38,810\nWindows 8 They start virtualizing\nthe reg a little bit, things like that.\n\n934\n00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:41,650\nBut lots of other\nalternatives we could use.\n\n935\n00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,690\n>> Yeah.\nThere's so many out there.\n\n936\n00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,540\n>> Yeah.\nEasy to find those guys.\n\n937\n00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,480\nWhat about cache, cookies, and history?\n\n938\n00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,160\nNow if we just started cash and cookies,\nthat just sounds like an ideal day.\n\n939\n00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,516\n>> We've got cookies back there.\n\n940\n00:48:53,516 --> 00:48:54,560\n[LAUGH]\n>> We've got cookies.\n\n941\n00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,810\nBring the cash and we're good to go.\n\n942\n00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,110\nSo yeah, no, the cache,\ncookie and history analysis and\n\n943\n00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:05,410\nhere we're talking about browsers, right,\nInternet history and things like that.\n\n944\n00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:09,400\n>> Yes, we have all these\ndifferent web browsers nowadays,\n\n945\n00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,680\nit used to be with web browsers.\n\n946\n00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:20,180\nThe ones you really had good tools for\nwas IE.\n\n947\n00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,890\nIE was the target of so\nmuch stuff, they had viewers for\n\n948\n00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,800\ngrabbing all sorts of\ndifferent data out of it.\n\n949\n00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:33,080\nNowadays, all our major\nbrowsers tend to have\n\n950\n00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,660\ntools that you can use third party\nthat can extract a whole wealth\n\n951\n00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,410\nof information including history,\ncookies, settings.\n\n952\n00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:46,790\nIt could grab lots of stuff out\nof those individual browsers and\n\n953\n00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,250\ndisplay them to you.\n\n954\n00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,255\nAnd it literally is\nbrowser said to be one of\n\n955\n00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:55,745\nthose ones that are staggering the amount\nof information that's in them.\n\n956\n00:49:55,745 --> 00:50:00,015\nYou always think if you just clear a few\nthings, well, all the stuff's gone,\n\n957\n00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:01,895\nwhew I won that one.\n\n958\n00:50:01,895 --> 00:50:04,680\nNo, there's a lot of stuff\nthat's left behind that\n\n959\n00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,110\nis incredibly tough to get rid of.\n\n960\n00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:11,960\nSo if you go through the WSCC,\nI will tell you that there are actually\n\n961\n00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,610\nare in the Internet section for\nboth the system internals and\n\n962\n00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:18,810\nNearsoft, there are tools specifically for\nthe browsers that you can try.\n\n963\n00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,940\nTry it on your own system and\nsee what it recovers.\n\n964\n00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,800\nYou'll probably find\nout that there's stuff.\n\n965\n00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,900\nGoing way back that you thought was gone.\n\n966\n00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,770\n>> I can't believe that's still there.\n\n967\n00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,128\nMy gosh I gotta get rid of that.\n\n968\n00:50:32,128 --> 00:50:34,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, get rid of the evidence.\n\n969\n00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,420\n>> But you know and we do have to be\nfamiliar with the different platforms,\n\n970\n00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,340\nthe different browsers that are out there.\n\n971\n00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:44,560\nI use one Chrome, Firefox, Mozilla,\nOpera, there's several ones and\n\n972\n00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,310\neach one might store their data\na little bit differently or\n\n973\n00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:51,010\nin different locations or\nstore different types of data.\n\n974\n00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,890\nTry to familiarize\nyourself with all of them,\n\n975\n00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:56,515\nwhere they're storing that information,\nso we know where to look.\n\n976\n00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:59,300\n>> Yeah, there's that and there's also,\nthere's the web browsers and\n\n977\n00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:03,030\nthere's also the email client too,\nby the way.\n\n978\n00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:07,760\nIt's worth mentioning that too, is that\nyou have tools specially designed to pull\n\n979\n00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,070\ncontact information and some of the mail\ninformation out of things like Outlook.\n\n980\n00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:15,890\nSo Outlook happened to be a present\non a system, it can extract and\n\n981\n00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:18,670\nacquire a good amount of data\nout of those things too.\n\n982\n00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,200\nSo you've got tools.\n\n983\n00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,530\nThose also are in the WSCC\nthat you've downloaded.\n\n984\n00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,000\n>> And we had a question there.\n\n985\n00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000\nSorry G, I almost missed yours.\n\n986\n00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,620\nMost cloud storage imaging will be\nlogical versus physical I suspect,\n\n987\n00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,920\nis that a good assumption?\n\n988\n00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:39,360\nProbably one of those things that\nwill vary from case to case, but\n\n989\n00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:46,680\nif it's a public cloud, then most\nlikely it's going to be multi-tenant.\n\n990\n00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,060\n>> If it's a public cloud, yeah,\nit'll be multi-tenant, more than likely.\n\n991\n00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:55,620\nI can't see any way you'd realistically\nphysically do a bit stream image of that.\n\n992\n00:51:55,620 --> 00:52:00,700\nYou'd have to do something like\na logical which is one of the things,\n\n993\n00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:05,930\nif you think about, it's one of the things\nthat makes it really frustrating and\n\n994\n00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,470\ntough to do forensics in that environment.\n\n995\n00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:12,810\nIf you rely on techniques\nlike restoring files and\n\n996\n00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,650\ndoing those little file\ncarving operations,\n\n997\n00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:19,620\nif you're relying on that as part of your,\nor it's a common part of your\n\n998\n00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:25,860\ntask list, you've got a little bit\nof a problem on numerous fronts.\n\n999\n00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:29,020\nFirst one is,\nyou might not be able to get that period,\n\n1000\n00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,650\nthat information may be held in\nsuch a way that you can't get it.\n\n1001\n00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,390\nThe other things is because of the way\nspace is dynamically allocated in\n\n1002\n00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:41,310\nthe cloud, what was used by you as a\ntenant may not be used by you as a tenant\n\n1003\n00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:45,010\ntomorrow, or the next day, or the next\nday, it could have actually changed.\n\n1004\n00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:50,410\nSo you could have a situation where\nas space gets reallocated and\n\n1005\n00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:54,020\nall that good stuff, if you were able to,\n\n1006\n00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,240\nin some situations you are able to\ngo through and do file restores.\n\n1007\n00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,140\nYou might restore information\nthat doesn't belong to you and\n\n1008\n00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,980\nbe examining information\nthat's from someone else.\n\n1009\n00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:08,410\nNow you've got back to that whole\nECPA concern and all that good stuff,\n\n1010\n00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:10,830\nthat now you have information\nyou've got to keep private.\n\n1011\n00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:13,830\nAnd like I said,\nthat's provided you can even get to that\n\n1012\n00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:16,900\npoint where you can get\ndown to the media that far.\n\n1013\n00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,640\n>> Yeah,\na lot of times with things like cloud,\n\n1014\n00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,900\nI mean, we're not the ones\nwho actually go get the data.\n\n1015\n00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,100\nWe've got a warrant, we've got to go\nover to say, just for an example,\n\n1016\n00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,700\nAmazon Web Services.\n\n1017\n00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,520\nAnd we present the warrant,\nwe're not the ones that actually go touch\n\n1018\n00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,870\ntheir systems and\nget that data off of there.\n\n1019\n00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:36,680\nThey're the ones that go in and\nget what we need and give it back to us.\n\n1020\n00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,250\nAnd we mentioned that\nthe other day in our episode,\n\n1021\n00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,710\nthat can make it difficult to\nmaintain that chain of evidence.\n\n1022\n00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:44,700\nAre they trained forensic investigators?\n\n1023\n00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,060\nAre they gathering\nthe information correctly?\n\n1024\n00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:51,360\nSo yeah, the cloud really does\nthrow a bunch of wrenches into\n\n1025\n00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,760\nour forensic investigations.\n\n1026\n00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,230\nIt's something that we're gonna have to\nget used to and I think over time better\n\n1027\n00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:59,660\ntechniques are going to be developed,\nbetter methods are going to be developed.\n\n1028\n00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:04,145\nThe laws will probably change here or\nthere to make it a little bit easier or\n\n1029\n00:54:04,145 --> 00:54:07,665\nless easy for the bad guys to hide\nthings by moving it out to the cloud.\n\n1030\n00:54:07,665 --> 00:54:09,655\nBut it is frustrating as you said.\n\n1031\n00:54:09,655 --> 00:54:11,925\nIt is probably a good word to use.\n\n1032\n00:54:11,925 --> 00:54:15,245\n>> That's why if you're ever gonna be in\na situation where you're consulting for\n\n1033\n00:54:15,245 --> 00:54:19,415\na company and make a decision on if you're\ngonna be able to move the cloud or not.\n\n1034\n00:54:21,045 --> 00:54:23,165\nThat could be a big motivating\nissue on whether or\n\n1035\n00:54:23,165 --> 00:54:25,575\nnot you go public cloud\nversus private cloud.\n\n1036\n00:54:25,575 --> 00:54:27,770\nIf a cloud is even an option for\nyou at all.\n\n1037\n00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:32,700\nSome regulations require that you\nhave the ability to do forensics.\n\n1038\n00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,960\nOnce somebody's made the decision to\npush their stuff out in the cloud,\n\n1039\n00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,900\nthey've severely hindered that or\nmay have severely hindered that ability.\n\n1040\n00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,690\nThere are contracts out there.\n\n1041\n00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,380\nI know for\na fact that some companies have,\n\n1042\n00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:49,190\nthey need to have the capability\nof doing forensics.\n\n1043\n00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:53,130\nIt's basically just there to make\nit to look pretty on the contract.\n\n1044\n00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:57,180\nIt doesn't really mean anything\nbecause there is no way to do it.\n\n1045\n00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,658\n>> And the last thing I want to talk about\nin this segment here kind of rounding off\n\n1046\n00:55:00,658 --> 00:55:07,820\nour collecting non-volatile information,\nis talking about MD5 calculations.\n\n1047\n00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,150\nAnd that goes back, I think,\n\n1048\n00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:12,790\nto the ability to validate that\ndata that we're collecting.\n\n1049\n00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:15,730\n>> Yeah, and in a nutshell that's what's\ntalking about instead of going through\n\n1050\n00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:20,040\nall the hashing, talk about what\nhashing is, and hashcat and MD5 and\n\n1051\n00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,580\nall the things we've kind of been\nputting out during the week.\n\n1052\n00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:27,310\nWell, make sure when you're collecting\nall of this that you're again,\n\n1053\n00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:31,130\ncollecting in way that you can validate\nnot only when it was collected but\n\n1054\n00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:34,030\nit's in the same state\nthat you collected it.\n\n1055\n00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:37,570\nThat's gonna be all important for\nall of this.\n\n1056\n00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:41,710\nAnd there's always a way to verify\neverything, it's just up to you\n\n1057\n00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:46,080\nif you're using something off this list or\nfrom something else to know what that is.\n\n1058\n00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,480\nIf it's files, well,\nhashing is really easy to do.\n\n1059\n00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,460\nYou can hash really anything.\n\n1060\n00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:56,500\n>> Single file all the way up to an entire\nimage of a hard drive can be hashed.\n\n1061\n00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,950\nMight take you a little while,\nbut it can be hashed.\n\n1062\n00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:59,960\nAnd then it can be used.\n\n1063\n00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,535\nIt doesn't matter how big the input data\nwas, in the end, you hash that again or\n\n1064\n00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:08,223\nyou hash a copy of that and\nthe output of that hashing algorithm,\n\n1065\n00:56:08,223 --> 00:56:11,670\nthe hash value matches,\nthen you know it hasn't changed.\n\n1066\n00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:15,760\nIt's as simple as that, so\nit's a very easy, simple way to validate\n\n1067\n00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,190\nthat the information is exactly as I\nfound it even though I've done my test.\n\n1068\n00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,860\nI haven't left my mark.\n\n1069\n00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,390\nIs basically what we're saying.\n\n1070\n00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:24,020\n>> Yes.\n\n1071\n00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,050\nAbsolutely.\n\n1072\n00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:30,270\nWhat you're gonna have to show is that the\noriginals that you took that you're gonna\n\n1073\n00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:31,490\nhave to present for evidence.\n\n1074\n00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:32,470\nRemember, best evidence.\n\n1075\n00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:34,140\nThat's what you're gonna present in court.\n\n1076\n00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,880\nYou're gonna have to show\nthose things haven't changed\n\n1077\n00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,690\nas well as the copy\nthat you worked off of.\n\n1078\n00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:43,200\nIt's the same version, or\nat least it was when you started.\n\n1079\n00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,920\nSo there's no kind of finger point or\n\n1080\n00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,160\nanything, saying that hey you\naltered it or what have you.\n\n1081\n00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:54,320\nIt's like, no, we started from\nthe same spot with these two.\n\n1082\n00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,400\n>> Exactly.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n1083\n00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,860\nlooking at our clock, it's about time for\n\n1084\n00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,470\nus to take one of those\npesky little breaks.\n\n1085\n00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,430\nSo we're gonna step away,\nwhen we come back,\n\n1086\n00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:03,030\nwe're gonna continue on\nwith our Windows forensics.\n\n1087\n00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,430\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1088\n00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,170\nAll right welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n1089\n00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,570\nSo continuing on with our\nWindows Forensics episode,\n\n1090\n00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:21,190\nnext we wanna dive into metadata,\ninvestigation.\n\n1091\n00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:25,180\nThis is that stuff that we sometimes, if\nwe're not trained, we don't think about.\n\n1092\n00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,700\nWe might not even realize it's there.\n\n1093\n00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,420\n>> Yes,\nmetadata is literally scattered all over.\n\n1094\n00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:35,250\nThe system really any system when you\nget down to it there's meta data there,\n\n1095\n00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:38,850\nit's just a question of do\nyou know it's there and\n\n1096\n00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:43,060\ndo you know how to access it or\ncan you access it?\n\n1097\n00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:48,150\nMost times you can't access it's a\nquestion of do you really know it's there?\n\n1098\n00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,580\nAnd do you know those mechanisms?\n\n1099\n00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:50,430\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n1100\n00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:53,740\nAnd metadata is data about data\nis always what I like to say it.\n\n1101\n00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,390\nRight?\nIt's information about the information.\n\n1102\n00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:56,950\nInformation about the file.\n\n1103\n00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,990\nInformation about the folder,\nthe directory.\n\n1104\n00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,860\nInformation about the drive.\n\n1105\n00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,430\nStuff that the operating system might use\nin the background or where it keeps track\n\n1106\n00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:08,750\nof information about the file like\nlast access and things like that.\n\n1107\n00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:12,250\nSo, information about the file outside\nof the file itself, for example.\n\n1108\n00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,130\n>> Yeah, that's a great description.\n\n1109\n00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,380\nData that describes data.\n\n1110\n00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:22,020\nIs a really, really perfect and\nit's a nice and synced explanation of it.\n\n1111\n00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,850\n>> Yeah, and we've got a couple different\ntools we can use to try to access\n\n1112\n00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:26,900\nthis metadata, I mean,\nthere's obviously several.\n\n1113\n00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,360\n>> But a couple we want to bring out.\n\n1114\n00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:34,460\nOne we've talked about\nbefore was that medigoophil.\n\n1115\n00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,570\n>> Yeah, that was mentioned in the.\n\n1116\n00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,780\nIt's close enough.\n\n1117\n00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,780\nI've been struggling with that name for\nyears.\n\n1118\n00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,720\nIt's Metagoophil, or whatever.\n\n1119\n00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,530\nI don't know.\n\n1120\n00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:46,660\nI guess where you put the emphasis on it.\n\n1121\n00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,390\nI can look at that.\n\n1122\n00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,140\nWe can figure that out.\n\n1123\n00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,040\nI need some guidance there.\n\n1124\n00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:56,580\nBut what that tool does is that\ntool will allow you to view\n\n1125\n00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,730\nattributes of different files and\nreally dig in to see, you know,\n\n1126\n00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:05,210\nwhat the deal is with that data way beyond\nwhat you normally will be able to do.\n\n1127\n00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:08,710\n>> The issue with it though\nis that it is a litics tool.\n\n1128\n00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:12,990\nYou're gonna have to fire up\nKalie to go ahead and use that.\n\n1129\n00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:17,285\nIt's definitely worth it with the amount\nof information it can extract.\n\n1130\n00:59:17,285 --> 00:59:18,805\nAgain, it's not the only one.\n\n1131\n00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:23,815\nIt can look at just one type of attribute,\nyou also have our other\n\n1132\n00:59:23,815 --> 00:59:28,235\ntool from yesterday, autopsy will\nreview attributes of a file as well so\n\n1133\n00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:30,665\nthose are just two right off the bat.\n\n1134\n00:59:30,665 --> 00:59:34,465\n>> And Debra, get out of my head.\n\n1135\n00:59:34,465 --> 00:59:37,425\nThe next one I was gonna bring\nup was an exif viewer, so\n\n1136\n00:59:37,425 --> 00:59:39,350\nwe can look at that exif info.\n\n1137\n00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,290\nOn our files, especially our images.\n\n1138\n00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,950\n>> Yeah, exif is one that again\n\n1139\n00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:50,790\nwe saw it in the CEH course but\nit has utility here as well.\n\n1140\n00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:56,270\nWhat that does is it views the attributes\nof image files, is the big one.\n\n1141\n00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:59,740\nIt can view those attributes on it and\ntell you for example,\n\n1142\n00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:04,240\nwhat the settings on someone's camera\nwere What camera they used and,\n\n1143\n01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,330\nif you're lucky, you can even tell them\nGPS coordinates and stuff like that.\n\n1144\n01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:11,230\nSo now you can start telling\nwhere that person actually\n\n1145\n01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:17,970\nwas when that image was taken and\nthere's online ones too.\n\n1146\n01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:20,350\nIt's not like you have to\nget one that's installed.\n\n1147\n01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,490\nYou know on your box.\n\n1148\n01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:25,400\nI mean, I would recommend you get one,\ncuz there's really no reason not to,\n\n1149\n01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:30,420\nbut in any case, information, something\nthat can be viewed through many means and\n\n1150\n01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:34,430\ngive you really nice\ninformation about that image.\n\n1151\n01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,640\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1152\n01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,290\nAll right and\nthen once we get done with our meta data,\n\n1153\n01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:40,580\nagain several tools that we can use for\nthat.\n\n1154\n01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,880\nLog analysis.\n\n1155\n01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,030\nThis is another thing that is a big\none that we've got to do, right?\n\n1156\n01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:49,960\n>> Yeah, log analysis is something that\nyou will be doing, there are no ifs, ands,\n\n1157\n01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,760\nor buts around it.\n\n1158\n01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,670\nYou can almost figure that in\n\n1159\n01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:57,240\nevery investigation you're going to\nbe doing some form of log analysis.\n\n1160\n01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,210\nIt is, the question is just how\nin depth do you have to go.\n\n1161\n01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,570\nThere's logs really for everything.\n\n1162\n01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:06,250\nIf you go to a server,\nthere's gonna be plenty of logs there.\n\n1163\n01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,000\nWay beyond.\n\n1164\n01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,530\n>> Too many.\n\n1165\n01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:08,590\n>> Yeah, too many, right?\n\n1166\n01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:14,460\nThere are gonna be ones that go beyond\njust the normal Windows system logs.\n\n1167\n01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,670\nThere's gonna be ones for\nactive directory, potentially.\n\n1168\n01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:21,980\nThere's gonna be ones for DNS, DHCP,\nthe web server if you've got it.\n\n1169\n01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:25,160\nAll those things are gonna be there.\n\n1170\n01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,450\nThat's just a few logs.\n\n1171\n01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,350\nWe don't even know what other\napplications you have there.\n\n1172\n01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,330\nThose could be something that\nyou need to investigate as well.\n\n1173\n01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:37,510\nThere's just literally so many logs.\n\n1174\n01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:38,660\nDesktop system?\n\n1175\n01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:43,050\nMaybe not as many as a server, but\nsometimes it doesn't seem like it.\n\n1176\n01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:46,150\nYou go through the Windows folder and\nother places and you see those\n\n1177\n01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:50,180\nlog files being thrown out there going\nwhat the heck is that doing there?\n\n1178\n01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,585\nThey're all over the place.\n\n1179\n01:01:51,585 --> 01:01:52,190\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1180\n01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:54,960\n>> It's a good thing,\nif you're a forensics technician,\n\n1181\n01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,720\nthere's a lot of information there\nyou could potentially sort through.\n\n1182\n01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,270\nAnd use to aid in your investigation.\n\n1183\n01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:02,980\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1184\n01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:06,380\nLog files are just where my system is\nlogging what's going on we've got our\n\n1185\n01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:12,690\nstandard Windows logs, our system log, our\napplication log, and our security logs.\n\n1186\n01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,650\nBut, as Sean says,\nthere's dozens of others if not more,\n\n1187\n01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,760\ndepending on what's\ninstalled on that machine.\n\n1188\n01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,280\nDifferent services when you run them.\n\n1189\n01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,680\nThey include log systems or\n\n1190\n01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,650\nlog files, applications themselves\nmight generate log files.\n\n1191\n01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:28,400\nThere might be error logs that are\ngenerated when something causes a problem,\n\n1192\n01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,600\nor there's an issue on your system.\n\n1193\n01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:35,290\nSo knowing how to find those logs, looking\nfor them, knowing what logs are out there.\n\n1194\n01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,540\nAnd there's a few tools we\ncan use to help us with that.\n\n1195\n01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:38,990\nThey'll let us crunch these logs.\n\n1196\n01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:43,570\nA lot of these are admin tools that we\nuse to do our normal job of parsing\n\n1197\n01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:47,410\nlog files but we've got some that\nare specific to forensic as well or\n\n1198\n01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:50,030\nthat really aid in that\nforensic investigation.\n\n1199\n01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:53,410\n>> Yes one of the ones you can use that\n\n1200\n01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:56,250\nI've pointed out previously\nin addition to the normal.\n\n1201\n01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:01,500\n>> Windows tools, is one called Log Parser\nLizard, you may remember this from what,\n\n1202\n01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,250\nyesterday, the day before,\nsomething like that, we mentioned it.\n\n1203\n01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,860\n>> We'll just say a previous episode.\n\n1204\n01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:11,420\n>> Yeah, a previous episode,\nwe talked about Log Parser Lizard, so\n\n1205\n01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:16,740\nwhat I've done on my computer here is\nI've brought up Log Parser Lizard.\n\n1206\n01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:21,570\n>> To kind of give you an insight\ninto what it's capable of doing.\n\n1207\n01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:26,570\nWhat Log Parser Lizard does is\nit allows you to actually query\n\n1208\n01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:32,100\na log file and\nsee what's actually inside of it.\n\n1209\n01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,780\nSo it's really kinda neat.\n\n1210\n01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:37,150\nSo I've got Log Parser Lizard\nsitting up here.\n\n1211\n01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:43,210\nI've already run a query on it to\nmake things a little easier for us.\n\n1212\n01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:49,353\nWhat it's doing here is it's displaying\njust selected events out of a log file and\n\n1213\n01:03:49,353 --> 01:03:53,460\nyou can scroll across at\nwhat's in this specific log.\n\n1214\n01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:57,920\nIt's telling you where it's located and\nvarious pieces of information.\n\n1215\n01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,726\nYou know,\ndifferent format than what you see in\n\n1216\n01:04:02,726 --> 01:04:07,540\nthe normal log viewer,\nbut it's still valid.\n\n1217\n01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:11,450\nIt's also storing it to its own\ndatabase outside of Windows.\n\n1218\n01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:16,370\nIf you want to run queries to give\nyou a kind of an idea, if I say,\n\n1219\n01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:20,800\nI wanna run a query, I can say I\nwant all errors from an event log.\n\n1220\n01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,630\nThere's the actual statement that\nrepresents what it's gonna do.\n\n1221\n01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:28,210\nAnd all I have to do at that point is say,\nRun Query.\n\n1222\n01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:31,580\nIt does a quick thing and boom,\nit brings back the results.\n\n1223\n01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,850\n>> To me, John, that looks like\nactual transact-sql or TSQL.\n\n1224\n01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:35,690\n>> That is what it is.\n\n1225\n01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:36,550\n>> Nice.\nSo\n\n1226\n01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:38,940\nsomething that a lot of us\nare probably already familiar with,\n\n1227\n01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,820\nrelatively easy language to work with.\n\n1228\n01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,430\nAnd, from what I'm looking at then,\n\n1229\n01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:45,820\nI could have specified more\nthan one log file there.\n\n1230\n01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,580\nAlright.\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n1231\n01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:47,520\nYeah.\n>> From statement,\n\n1232\n01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,790\nI could have specified more than one.\n\n1233\n01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,110\nAnd that's powerful, right?\n\n1234\n01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:52,960\nThat means, I don't have to go\nto individual logs and look.\n\n1235\n01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,930\nIt knows where a lot of\nthese log files are.\n\n1236\n01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:57,400\nAnd I can specify the names of\nthese different log files,.\n\n1237\n01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,030\nAnd it can go out.\n\n1238\n01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,620\nAnd grab them, consolidate all of that.\n\n1239\n01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,790\nWhich is gonna make it\na lot easier to report on.\n\n1240\n01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:03,850\nTo summarize.\n\n1241\n01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:06,630\nTo kind of get that information.\n\n1242\n01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:07,810\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1243\n01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:13,450\nAnd if you can see over here,\non the left hand side of this,\n\n1244\n01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:17,190\nit's even got right here the IAS logs,\nit will go through.\n\n1245\n01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:20,610\nAnd you'll see it changes\nthe context up top.\n\n1246\n01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:24,450\nIt will allow you if\nan IS is installed here.\n\n1247\n01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:28,910\nIt will allow you to do the same type of\nqueries against that application's logs,\n\n1248\n01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:33,020\nwhich may very well be something that\nyou have to investigate at some point.\n\n1249\n01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:35,410\nI'd almost be willing to\nbet that at some point,\n\n1250\n01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:40,620\nyou're gonna have to work with\nMicrosoft Web Server as part of your\n\n1251\n01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:43,220\nForensic Investigation if\nyou're gonna be doing that.\n\n1252\n01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:46,410\nThis is a way of capturing information and\n\n1253\n01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:50,070\nyou can run the queries\nas they are in here.\n\n1254\n01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:56,170\nThere's also ability to run a query and\nit will prompt you for input.\n\n1255\n01:05:56,170 --> 01:06:00,670\nSo, you can just save the query, and\nrun it, and say, I want to look for this.\n\n1256\n01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:04,230\nAnd it will go through everything and\nrun that query specifically looking for\n\n1257\n01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:05,825\nwhatever item you are looking for.\n\n1258\n01:06:05,825 --> 01:06:06,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1259\n01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,260\n>> So you don't have to rewrite the query.\n\n1260\n01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:12,950\nYou can have it just drop different\nvariables in for any specific execution.\n\n1261\n01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:13,720\n>> That's powerful.\n\n1262\n01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,255\nI could use that in my day-to-day\nserver admin, right there.\n\n1263\n01:06:16,255 --> 01:06:17,010\n[COUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1264\n01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:20,240\n>> And there's lots of different\nlog parsers that you can get,\n\n1265\n01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,850\nas Sean has said several times.\n\n1266\n01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:23,940\nThis is just one that in particular,\n\n1267\n01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,350\nthat's good to use in\nour forensic analysis.\n\n1268\n01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:30,890\nAnother thing, we've posted a link in\nthe previous episodes show notes for\n\n1269\n01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:33,220\nthat Log Parser Lizard.\n\n1270\n01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,500\nAnd I'll make sure to throw\nthat in there as well.\n\n1271\n01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,150\n>> Yeah, I would encourage\neveryone to try this one.\n\n1272\n01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:43,340\nThis is one when I first ran into it,\nwas it free?\n\n1273\n01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,270\n>> What?\n>> Was it free?\n\n1274\n01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:46,380\n>> It's free, it's all free.\n\n1275\n01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:51,896\n>> Well that one's coming along with\nme tonight, along with my Linux.\n\n1276\n01:06:51,896 --> 01:06:55,390\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's two components.\n\n1277\n01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,770\nIt's the Log Parser Lizard.\n\n1278\n01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:59,100\nAnd then there's the Log Parser\nsitting behind it.\n\n1279\n01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,750\nBoth of them are free.\n\n1280\n01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:05,800\nMicrosoft makes a log parser\ncomponent that runs on top of free.\n\n1281\n01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,860\nSo-\n>> Plus their API\n\n1282\n01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:09,740\nthat they give you access to so that-\n>> Yeah, you just install that and\n\n1283\n01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,210\nthen you install this on top of it.\n\n1284\n01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:12,520\nAnd you've got the whole.\n\n1285\n01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:15,620\n>> You know, shot right there.\n\n1286\n01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,860\n>> Nice.\n>> And yeah,\n\n1287\n01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:19,510\nthe real power comes out\nif you do know a sequel.\n\n1288\n01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:24,000\nYou can customize the heck out of\nthis to get exactly what you want.\n\n1289\n01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,270\nIt just gives you access to all the logs.\n\n1290\n01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:30,960\nIt allows you, to put pre-selected queries\nin there or customize them a little bit.\n\n1291\n01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,790\nYou can customize these queries\na bit without having much sequel or\n\n1292\n01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:36,340\nany sequel knowledge.\n\n1293\n01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:41,070\nBut you can customize and\nunlock even more power out of it.\n\n1294\n01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:43,710\nWhich is just amazing.\n\n1295\n01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:47,980\nI liked when I first saw it and\nstarted playing around with it.\n\n1296\n01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,090\nThis is just great.\n\n1297\n01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:50,920\nThis is very very useful.\n\n1298\n01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,420\n>> Yeah, a log files obviously,\na great place to find information.\n\n1299\n01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,330\nThe challenge is, there is just so\n\n1300\n01:07:56,330 --> 01:08:00,600\nmany log files that I really need to\nlook through and it is tedious, right?\n\n1301\n01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,160\nIt's just so tedious going through\neach one of those entries looking for\n\n1302\n01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,460\npertinent information.\n\n1303\n01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:09,550\nSomething like this makes my life a whole\nlot easier because now I can just run\n\n1304\n01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:14,130\na query and find exactly what I'm\nlooking for, so kudos to that.\n\n1305\n01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,750\nLove it, love it.\n\n1306\n01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:19,990\nSo Log Analysis, big part of our\nForensic Investigation in any system,\n\n1307\n01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:21,390\nincluding Windows.\n\n1308\n01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:22,290\nAnd then,\n\n1309\n01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:25,690\nWindows Password issues is something\nthat we want to deal with as well.\n\n1310\n01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:31,250\n>> Yeah, be prepared for that,\nbecause once you get an image of a system,\n\n1311\n01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:34,640\nthen you start working on an image.\n\n1312\n01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,260\nYou're probably going to, at some point,\n\n1313\n01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:42,500\nwanna start looking into\nvarious pieces of the system.\n\n1314\n01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:47,750\nAnd that may require,\nthat you have a password, in which case,\n\n1315\n01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:52,250\nif you're working on a copy,\ngo ahead, try to break a password.\n\n1316\n01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:57,710\nYou can use literally any of those tools\nthat we talked about in the CEH course.\n\n1317\n01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:01,850\nAll those tools that we talked about and\nused some of them.\n\n1318\n01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:07,285\nThey all would be perfect things to\nbe using here to break passwords.\n\n1319\n01:09:07,285 --> 01:09:10,805\nAgain, we're breaking passwords\non the copy, not on the original.\n\n1320\n01:09:10,805 --> 01:09:14,245\nYou can break passwords,\nreset passwords, what have you.\n\n1321\n01:09:14,245 --> 01:09:18,275\nIf you want,\nyou deploy the image to a system and\n\n1322\n01:09:18,275 --> 01:09:21,525\nthen you can take something\nlike the Trinity Rescue Kit.\n\n1323\n01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:22,055\nRun that.\n\n1324\n01:09:22,055 --> 01:09:23,655\nAnd reset a password.\n\n1325\n01:09:23,655 --> 01:09:26,820\nSo, you've got plenty of options there\n\n1326\n01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,760\nto help you kind of wander\nthe system a bit more.\n\n1327\n01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,510\nIf someone was trying to hide\nsomething and they will do that a lot.\n\n1328\n01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,350\nIf they're really suspicious,\n\n1329\n01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:38,180\nthey will get those little password\nprotected files and stuff like that.\n\n1330\n01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:42,300\nFortunately, there are so many things\nout there that can break those,\n\n1331\n01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,740\nmaybe not efficiently, but break those.\n\n1332\n01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:49,400\nThat it's just a matter of,\ndo you want to put the time and effort in?\n\n1333\n01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:49,970\n>> Yeah, and\n\n1334\n01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:53,740\na lot of times those applications\nthat install or not that install.\n\n1335\n01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:56,930\nBut the applications that provide some\nkind of password level protection,\n\n1336\n01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:57,990\nthey're not the strongest, right?.\n\n1337\n01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:59,350\nThey're not running or\n\n1338\n01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:02,249\nanything like that, it's [CROSSTALK]\n>> It's a security blanket\n\n1339\n01:10:02,249 --> 01:10:03,500\nsome days, right?\n\n1340\n01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,320\n>> Exactly, it's pretty weak.\n\n1341\n01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,920\nI remember somebody had\na file they brought to me,\n\n1342\n01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,870\nit was an Excel file that\nthey had password protected.\n\n1343\n01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:12,100\nThey were like, I can't get into this.\n\n1344\n01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:12,720\nWhat am I going to do.\n\n1345\n01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,620\nYou're a computer guy, can you help me?\n\n1346\n01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:17,390\nAnd I'll say, \"Here, I'll show you how.\".\n\n1347\n01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:19,765\nGoogle cracked Excel password.\n\n1348\n01:10:19,765 --> 01:10:22,140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Download this little tool that took me\n\n1349\n01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,910\nabout five seconds to download,\nrun, and you're in.\n\n1350\n01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,490\nAnd they're like, \"Oh my god\".\n\n1351\n01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:27,910\nAnd I'm like, \"Yeah, exactly\".\n\n1352\n01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,210\nThat's why, password protecting it,\n\n1353\n01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:32,026\nis not really worth the effort\nbecause you forget the password.\n\n1354\n01:10:32,026 --> 01:10:36,390\nSo anyway, point is,\nwe need to be able to get those passwords.\n\n1355\n01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:39,110\nSeveral different tools we\ncan use to access those.\n\n1356\n01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,760\nIf they're system passwords,\nmaybe a little bit tougher and\n\n1357\n01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,480\nthat's when we break out all those\nthings we learned about in CEH.\n\n1358\n01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,040\nso if you haven't seen those and\nyou're a subscriber,\n\n1359\n01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,860\nan annual or a monthly subscriber,\nmake sure you go check out\n\n1360\n01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:56,110\nthose CEH episodes cause we talk about how\nwe can go about cracking those passwords.\n\n1361\n01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:59,535\nAnd a lot of different tools that\nwe can use to crack those there.\n\n1362\n01:10:59,535 --> 01:11:04,580\n>> Yeah, that's one of the reasons why,\nalso that it's recommended, that\n\n1363\n01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:08,580\nto get the full advantage out of being\na forensic investigator in this course.\n\n1364\n01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:12,040\nYou also may want to go through\nthe CEH if you haven't already.\n\n1365\n01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:16,050\nI know, we have a lot of you have\njoined us for this journey here.\n\n1366\n01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:20,470\nThat were in the CEH course, but if you\nhaven't you may want to go ahead and\n\n1367\n01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:24,880\ntake a look at that stuff too,\nbecause it's very applicable here.\n\n1368\n01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,330\nAnd if you decide not to do forensics,\nI mean, that's fine.\n\n1369\n01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:30,240\nYou're maybe doing this\njust cuz you're interested.\n\n1370\n01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:35,860\nBut this will also help you in your CEH\njob if that's what you want to do there.\n\n1371\n01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,800\n>> You can almost look at it in\na way as a forensic investigator.\n\n1372\n01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,250\nI am a type of hacker.\n\n1373\n01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:43,880\nAnd I'm trying to break into this\nsystem to discover information\n\n1374\n01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,770\nnot necessarily to steal\ninfo,but because it's my job.\n\n1375\n01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:47,910\nAnd I need to investigate it.\n\n1376\n01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:50,530\nSo we are hacking, if you will.\n\n1377\n01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:51,340\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1378\n01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,130\n>> Very good.\n\n1379\n01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:53,380\nAll right.\n\n1380\n01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,764\nSo Windows password issues\nthat we got to deal with,\n\n1381\n01:11:55,764 --> 01:11:58,050\nwhether that's getting\ninto the system itself.\n\n1382\n01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:00,840\nOr maybe certain files or\nsomething that's password protected.\n\n1383\n01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,050\nGotta deal with those.\n\n1384\n01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:05,810\nOther tools to kind of round\noff our Windows forensics.\n\n1385\n01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:09,290\nA couple of faves that we've\nseen a couple of times already\n\n1386\n01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:13,330\nthrough a few different episodes,\nthat WSCC.\n\n1387\n01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:18,235\nI think that's gonna be, like I said, one\nof my all time favorites at this point.\n\n1388\n01:12:18,235 --> 01:12:22,480\n>> That's a suite of utilities, you really\ncan't beat that, it's a great thing.\n\n1389\n01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:28,250\nYou can get a security suite and stuff\nlike that that do what that does, but\n\n1390\n01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:34,740\nfor me and probably for a lot of you,\nI find it to be very easy to use.\n\n1391\n01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:38,330\nIt's got all the utilities right there,\nutilities for\n\n1392\n01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:43,970\nWindows at least that I know and\ncan use quite readily and it's free.\n\n1393\n01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:45,780\nYou can't really beat that.\n\n1394\n01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:50,840\nAnd they all are trusted tools, so\nthey'd all be accepted if you ever had to\n\n1395\n01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:54,880\nuse the stuff you extracted with those, if\nyou ever had to use it in a court setting.\n\n1396\n01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,030\n>> Absolutely, and in fact,\nI can run it off a thumb drive,\n\n1397\n01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:59,760\nwhich minimizes the impact\nI'm having on that\n\n1398\n01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:04,800\nsystem just makes it a fantastic tool\nto at least have in your toolkit.\n\n1399\n01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,470\nAnd then another one that we all know and\n\n1400\n01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:09,630\nlove from CEH episodes,\nif you've seen those, and\n\n1401\n01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:14,590\nwe've mentioned it a couple times in here\nas well, is that Kali distro of Linux.\n\n1402\n01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:17,200\n>> Yes, that has a lot of value here.\n\n1403\n01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:22,310\nWe haven't got to actually\nuse it in this course yet,\n\n1404\n01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:25,970\nbut it is coming out as something\nthat we are gonna be using.\n\n1405\n01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:30,990\nSo we were focusing, at least in this\nparticular section on Windows forensics,\n\n1406\n01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,060\nstuff that you'd specifically\nbe collecting and\n\n1407\n01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,460\nshowed you some of the tools.\n\n1408\n01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:39,230\nBoth over the previous section and here,\nwe showed you some of the tools and\n\n1409\n01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:43,490\ntalked about what you should be\ncollecting and at least considering.\n\n1410\n01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:48,300\nSo you actually can move outside the\nWindows environment and use something like\n\n1411\n01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,900\nKali that could also help you get\na lot of good information off a box.\n\n1412\n01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:56,030\nAnd Kali's not the only one,\nthere's other ones out there that\n\n1413\n01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:59,450\ndo interesting things and\nmight be helpful to you.\n\n1414\n01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:04,560\nI think there is another Linux distro,\nFire, is one that's out there.\n\n1415\n01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,240\nIt's been out there for a while.\n\n1416\n01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,060\nIt can be used to do forensics.\n\n1417\n01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,825\nSo there's plenty of them out there.\n\n1418\n01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:12,527\n>> And Cyborg Hawk,\nnow that we're all going to be going and\n\n1419\n01:14:12,527 --> 01:14:16,158\ndownloading this weekend, and\nchecking out, see what that's all about.\n\n1420\n01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:21,010\nBut, you know, one of the big advantages\nof things like Kali to me is that, one,\n\n1421\n01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:21,920\nit's a Linux distro,\n\n1422\n01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,320\nso some of my tools that wouldn't\nrun on Windows can run on this.\n\n1423\n01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,820\nThey're almost always, and Kali\ndefinitely is, something I can run live.\n\n1424\n01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:35,020\nI've even got their mini version that I\ncan put on a smaller USB if I have to.\n\n1425\n01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:38,650\nAnd they've got a lot of those\ntools precompiled in there.\n\n1426\n01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:43,080\nFor a lot of people that are not regular\nLinux users, I think that's one of the big\n\n1427\n01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:48,020\nholdups is the fact that I get a Linux\ndistro and now what do I do with it?\n\n1428\n01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:48,870\nThere's nothing here.\n\n1429\n01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:52,894\nAnd it's not like Windows where I\ncan just go download something and\n\n1430\n01:14:52,894 --> 01:14:54,095\nrun an executable,\n\n1431\n01:14:54,095 --> 01:14:58,487\nalthough some of that's kind of shifting\non some of these Linux distros.\n\n1432\n01:14:58,487 --> 01:15:00,159\nBut it's not as easy.\n\n1433\n01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:01,840\nSo it might intimidate people.\n\n1434\n01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,850\nThese things,\nthey've got it in all built right into it.\n\n1435\n01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,890\nAll precompiled, and ready to go.\n\n1436\n01:15:06,890 --> 01:15:08,880\n>> Yes, and that's the thing.\n\n1437\n01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:15,490\nYou've got a ready to go kit that you can\njust have it handy and be ready to go.\n\n1438\n01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:19,235\nSo, you know,\nyou can't really beat having that.\n\n1439\n01:15:19,235 --> 01:15:23,090\nKali is very well documented.\n\n1440\n01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:26,390\nSo you've got plenty of\nsupport on that end too.\n\n1441\n01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:27,676\n>> It's not new.\nIt's been out, for\n\n1442\n01:15:27,676 --> 01:15:30,868\nsome of you who might be familiar with it,\nit used to be Backtracks,\n\n1443\n01:15:30,868 --> 01:15:33,782\nI think was the name of it when\nI first started playing with it.\n\n1444\n01:15:33,782 --> 01:15:38,358\nSo it's been around for a little while so\nit's known and it's really set up to do\n\n1445\n01:15:38,358 --> 01:15:42,675\nthis kind of thing, it's got all my\ntools in there so, fantastic distro.\n\n1446\n01:15:42,675 --> 01:15:46,545\n>> And, keep in mind,\nthe list that we've given you\n\n1447\n01:15:46,545 --> 01:15:50,520\nhere isn't anywhere near\nbeing exhaustive list.\n\n1448\n01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:55,110\nI mean, you could throw extra tools\nall over the place in here and\n\n1449\n01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:58,840\nstill have a great toolkit,\nor even better toolkit.\n\n1450\n01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,204\nI encourage you to go and try some and\ngo and look at other tools.\n\n1451\n01:16:03,204 --> 01:16:06,199\nYou don't have to stick with\nthe ones I have here by any means.\n\n1452\n01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:10,791\nI mean, I could throw in stuff in here\nalready like Metasplit would be one that\n\n1453\n01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:14,326\ndoes appear quite often in\nforensic examiners toolkits for\n\n1454\n01:16:14,326 --> 01:16:16,747\nthis because it does have a lot of value.\n\n1455\n01:16:16,747 --> 01:16:19,105\nVulnerability scanners like Nessus and\n\n1456\n01:16:19,105 --> 01:16:22,560\nNexpose would be ones that\ncould get thrown in there.\n\n1457\n01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,050\nAnd we haven't even talked\nabout the network tools and\n\n1458\n01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:27,630\nthe wireless tools that we\nhave coming down the road.\n\n1459\n01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:35,477\nThose are still set to make their debut\nin this digital forensics course.\n\n1460\n01:16:35,477 --> 01:16:37,195\n>> Right, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1461\n01:16:37,195 --> 01:16:40,121\nSo lots of good stuff coming\nup in future episodes, so\n\n1462\n01:16:40,121 --> 01:16:42,211\nmake sure you stick around for those.\n\n1463\n01:16:42,211 --> 01:16:45,517\nAll right, well Sean, I tell you\nwhat we've had a good episode here,\n\n1464\n01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:48,546\nwe've talked a lot about Windows\nforensics, looking at some of\n\n1465\n01:16:48,546 --> 01:16:52,102\nthe different tools and techniques that\nwe might use on a Windows systems.\n\n1466\n01:16:52,102 --> 01:16:57,203\nAll the way from gathering up that\nvolatile information on into gathering\n\n1467\n01:16:57,203 --> 01:17:02,560\nthe static information,\nonce we've got all that volatile captured.\n\n1468\n01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:07,507\nThen we go start and imaging that drive,\nwe talked about being able\n\n1469\n01:17:07,507 --> 01:17:11,510\nto validate, sorry about that,\nusing hashing algorithms.\n\n1470\n01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,910\nValidate that information\nthat we're collecting.\n\n1471\n01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:21,590\nLooking at log files, EXIF data,\nmeta data It on files, lots of good stuff.\n\n1472\n01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:26,680\nSo, anything else we wanna throw in\nhere before we wrap this one up?\n\n1473\n01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:32,434\n>> Practice and experiment, I guess would\nbe probably what I'm gonna tell you,\n\n1474\n01:17:32,434 --> 01:17:36,966\nsince I know a lot of you are gonna\nbe like Mike here playing with\n\n1475\n01:17:36,966 --> 01:17:39,594\nthe WSCC this weekend or whenever.\n\n1476\n01:17:39,594 --> 01:17:42,137\nLook at the different tools in something\nlike that and see what you can do.\n\n1477\n01:17:42,137 --> 01:17:46,732\nTry looking for, seeing if there's\nother tools that you know of outside\n\n1478\n01:17:46,732 --> 01:17:51,290\nthat kit that would do the same thing\nthat you might like even better.\n\n1479\n01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:55,290\nI mean, that's really what you\nhave ahead of you right now.\n\n1480\n01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:58,920\nThere's plenty of resources for\nforensics out there.\n\n1481\n01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,838\nIt's just, you finding the things\nthat you like the most.\n\n1482\n01:18:00,838 --> 01:18:02,161\nYou may like WSCC.\n\n1483\n01:18:02,161 --> 01:18:07,101\nHey, go for it, but there are other things\nout there that can help you out just\n\n1484\n01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:11,449\nas much or do different things that\nwe may not have talked about yet.\n\n1485\n01:18:11,449 --> 01:18:15,884\nOr that may be an advanced forensics topic\nthat we are not gonna be able to get to.\n\n1486\n01:18:15,884 --> 01:18:20,105\nBut experiment with all these tools to\nknow what their capabilities are and\n\n1487\n01:18:20,105 --> 01:18:24,125\nget to understand that because you\nwill have to use them, presumably,\n\n1488\n01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:26,525\nat some point in an investigation.\n\n1489\n01:18:26,525 --> 01:18:29,445\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\nyou don't want your first case or\n\n1490\n01:18:29,445 --> 01:18:33,633\nyour first investigation to be the first\ntime you've fired up some of these tools.\n\n1491\n01:18:33,633 --> 01:18:34,898\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, definitely not,\n\n1492\n01:18:34,898 --> 01:18:35,932\nthat's not a good thing.\n\n1493\n01:18:35,932 --> 01:18:37,372\n>> No bueno.\n\n1494\n01:18:37,372 --> 01:18:42,155\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nwe thank you guys for tuning in today.\n\n1495\n01:18:42,155 --> 01:18:44,082\nWe hope you enjoyed the episode.\n\n1496\n01:18:44,082 --> 01:18:47,797\nRemember, if you've got any

another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,780\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,810\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,970\n>> Doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n7\n00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,110\n>> I'm doing fantastic, looking forward\nto another exciting episode in our\n\n8\n00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,600\nDigital Forensic Investigator series.\n\n9\n00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,979\nIn this one, we're gonna be doing log\ncapturing and event correlation, Sean.\n\n10\n00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,452\nSo, and one of those parts of the digital\nforensic investigation that's extremely\n\n11\n00:00:57,452 --> 00:01:00,037\nimportant, maybe a little\non the tedious side.\n\n12\n00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:03,452\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's being a little generous.\n\n13\n00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:04,660\n>> Right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,395\n>> I completely understand if you looked\n\n15\n00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:08,937\nat it that way, too.\n\n16\n00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:12,036\n>> But it is a very important part\nof the investigation, all right?\n\n17\n00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:14,570\nAnd we can get a lot of\ninformation from it.\n\n18\n00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,630\nAnd there's a lot of tools that\nwe can use to make it not so\n\n19\n00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,340\ntedious, make it a little\nbit easier to work with,\n\n20\n00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,580\nbecause we're really gonna end up working\nwith large amounts of information.\n\n21\n00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,420\nNot all of it pertinent to\nwhat we're investigating.\n\n22\n00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,332\nSo we've gotta be able to get in there,\nfind what we're looking for.\n\n23\n00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:33,697\nAnd then try to correlate it with\nactual events and things like that.\n\n24\n00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:38,300\n>> Yeah, there definitely are quite a few\ntools that can help you out with this.\n\n25\n00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,301\nI mean,\nthis is the form of digital paperwork.\n\n26\n00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:45,390\nIt's paper work is never exciting but\n\n27\n00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,910\nit's necessary especially\nin something like this.\n\n28\n00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,100\nBecause this could be a make or\nbreak deal.\n\n29\n00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,000\n>> Absolutely.\n\n30\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,820\n>> If you don't have logs or you dont\nhave your logging done correctly, and\n\n31\n00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,020\nyou aren't collecting them correctly.\n\n32\n00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,550\nAnd then correlating them of course.\n\n33\n00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,130\nYou got to do that.\n\n34\n00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,340\nSo there's a lot of little\nthings that could trap you here.\n\n35\n00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,290\n>> Absolutely.\nAll right, so let's start off.\n\n36\n00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,710\nAnd I guess the first thing\nwe wanna do is just refresh.\n\n37\n00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,700\nAnd I understand at this\npoint in your career,\n\n38\n00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,340\nwe should be familiar with log files.\n\n39\n00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,440\nWe should have spent many hours\nworking with these things most likely.\n\n40\n00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,580\nBut when you talk about log files and\nspecifically our computer security logs,\n\n41\n00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,480\nall our different\noperating systems usually.\n\n42\n00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,450\nAnd I know the big ones all do.\n\n43\n00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,870\nThey keep log files.\n\n44\n00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,010\nIn fact they keep several log files.\n\n45\n00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,120\nWindows, for example,\nhas some big ones that we can use.\n\n46\n00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,920\n>> Yes, Windows has the big three,\nthe system log, the application log,\n\n47\n00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,140\nthe security log and there's others\nthat are in there, of course.\n\n48\n00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,115\nThere's a ton of other logs that can\nshow up either by default depending on\n\n49\n00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:47,650\nthe version you have.\n\n50\n00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,643\nOr, if you install other additional\nservices on top of, for example, Windows\n\n51\n00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:57,947\nserver, here's more things are gonna show\nup as those things get added on, right.\n\n52\n00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:01,750\n>> If we had installed DNS,\nyou're gonna get a DNS operational log.\n\n53\n00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,940\nIf you installed DHCP or Active Directory,\nyou're gonna get log files specific to\n\n54\n00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,010\nthose in addition to the big three in the\nother operational logs that are going on.\n\n55\n00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,110\n>> Yes, and remember we're keeping\nthis centered on Windows here.\n\n56\n00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,960\nI'm well aware that, as Mike said,\n\n57\n00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,040\nthere's logs on other systems,\nUnix, Linux, what have you.\n\n58\n00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,250\nThey're always there.\n\n59\n00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,380\nIt's just a question of finding\nthem on those systems and\n\n60\n00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,240\nto keep everyone the same page or just\nkinda keep it in the Windows environment.\n\n61\n00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,420\nBut yes, they are over there and\nthere are tools over there to make\n\n62\n00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,560\ncollection of them easier as well so\nyou aren't left out in the cold.\n\n63\n00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,450\nYou actually may have more robust\ntools on some of those platforms.\n\n64\n00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,060\nI mean Linux has a lot of stuff that you\ncan either download from the repositories,\n\n65\n00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,740\nor you can just code yourself if you're\nreally clever and talented that way.\n\n66\n00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,510\n>> Absolutely, and speaking of Windows,\nwhich is where most of my experience lies,\n\n67\n00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,240\nWindows event logs.\n\n68\n00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,400\nOne, good logs.\n\n69\n00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,180\nAnd they've made some great improvements\nto the logging system that we have access\n\n70\n00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,910\nto on these Windows machines.\n\n71\n00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,340\nAnd the ability to go in there and\n\n72\n00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,720\ncreate custom views and save those\ncustom views where I can filter down.\n\n73\n00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,280\nWe're looking at so many different logs.\n\n74\n00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,808\nA lot of times the problem is just finding\nthe information within those logs.\n\n75\n00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:20,430\nBecause they're gonna have\na lot of informational or\n\n76\n00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,050\nsuccess messages like this\nservice successfully started, or\n\n77\n00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,150\nthis service is now running and\nthings like that.\n\n78\n00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,940\nAnd those I typically don't care about.\n\n79\n00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,330\nI mean they're good to have.\n\n80\n00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,920\nBut I'm looking for my criticals, my\nwarnings, my security-related events and\n\n81\n00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,950\nthings like that.\n\n82\n00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,960\nAnd they have really good filtering\ncapabilities now built in to those event\n\n83\n00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,940\nlogs that we can look at, but\ntrying to think of what else.\n\n84\n00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,300\nYou can do scheduled\ntasks on these things.\n\n85\n00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,780\nA pretty powerful logging system\nbuilt into the operating system.\n\n86\n00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,245\n>> Yeah, I know a lot of people,\n\n87\n00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:55,764\nthey have made the same comment that\nthis is great that they put those in.\n\n88\n00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:57,500\nMicrosoft put those in\nthe Windows environment.\n\n89\n00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,110\nNow, you can do all of this filtering,\n\n90\n00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,610\nand-\n>> It seemed like everyone else in\n\n91\n00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,450\nthe world could do it except for Windows.\n\n92\n00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,230\nIt was so frustrating.\n\n93\n00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,140\n>> But finally it popped up.\n\n94\n00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,247\nFinally.\n>> Create subscriptions,\n\n95\n00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:11,670\nwe can pull logs from different\nmachines and kind of summarize,\n\n96\n00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,385\nnot summarize them but bring them all into\none location, make it easier to work with.\n\n97\n00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:18,675\nSo very good improvements.\n\n98\n00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:22,615\nAnd of course we'll look at some tools\nwe can use to parse those logs as well.\n\n99\n00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:24,555\nSo we've got the Windows event logs.\n\n100\n00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:27,075\nThen we've got our audit logs, all right?\n\n101\n00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:30,765\n>> Yes the Windows logs keep\ntrack of certain things that\n\n102\n00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:33,920\nare happening on the system,\nfailures, stuff like that.\n\n103\n00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,230\nAudit logs are designed to really\ngive you an idea of just how certain\n\n104\n00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,400\nfunctioning is going,\nto verify certain events going.\n\n105\n00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,300\nSecurity logs would be\na great example of that.\n\n106\n00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,070\nSecurity logs are telling us there was\nsuccessful log in, a failed log in.\n\n107\n00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,230\nOr whatever you choose to audit.\n\n108\n00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:49,959\nIt's gonna show up.\n\n109\n00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,490\nIt's gonna show up in that log file.\n\n110\n00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,729\n>> With Windows, I think,\n\n111\n00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,120\nprior to 2008 we had like nine\ndifferent categories we could audit.\n\n112\n00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,084\nStarting with 2008 and\nlater I think it was 2008 or 2008 R2,\n\n113\n00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:07,417\nthey introduced 53 new categories\nthat we can go in and audit.\n\n114\n00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:10,759\nIn a Windows environment when you audit\nall of that gets dumped into your\n\n115\n00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,491\nsecurity log.\n\n116\n00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:16,894\nAnd you can audit everything from, as Sean\nwas saying, logons to accessing files or\n\n117\n00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:22,312\nfolders or object access, several\ndifferent, like I said, 53 new categories.\n\n118\n00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:26,680\nI'm not gonna try to list them all for\nyou but lots of categories in there.\n\n119\n00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,050\nAnd that security log is where\nthe auditing events all get dumped, right?\n\n120\n00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,630\n>> Yes, that's where they're all gonna\nshow up and typically what you can see,\n\n121\n00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,210\nif we look at the events in there,\n\n122\n00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,620\nwe can filter out certain ones\nthat give us critical information.\n\n123\n00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,799\nThe 500 series tends to be one\nthat gives us some helpful stuff.\n\n124\n00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,480\nBut, keep in mind, really, from the\nstandpoint from what we're talking about,\n\n125\n00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,172\nit could be any event in there.\n\n126\n00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:55,510\nIt doesn't just have to\nbe one type of event,\n\n127\n00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,880\nso you're gonna wanna get\na kind of broad spectrum there.\n\n128\n00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,954\nYou're not gonna look\njust at the 500 series.\n\n129\n00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,159\nYou're not gonna look just at errors.\n\n130\n00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:07,246\nYou've got to change your thinking\njust a bit from standard IT,\n\n131\n00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:09,370\ncuz you never know where\nit might be hiding.\n\n132\n00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,697\nIt could be one of those things that\nin IT isn't useful, but for us it is.\n\n133\n00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:16,532\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n134\n00:07:16,532 --> 00:07:20,768\n>> Yeah, it could be that most people\ncan successfully access this resource or\n\n135\n00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:22,360\nthis file or whatever.\n\n136\n00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,790\nBut in this particular case,\n\n137\n00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,347\nI need to know that this person accessed\nthis file or something like that.\n\n138\n00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,855\nSo it's a normal informational\nmessage maybe, but\n\n139\n00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:31,679\nvery important to my investigation.\n\n140\n00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:34,710\nSo we can't rule it out just because\nit's not a critical warning.\n\n141\n00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,770\nWe're not always looking for those when\nit comes to an investigation, right?\n\n142\n00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,410\nMaybe when we're troubleshooting,\nthat's what we're focused on, but\n\n143\n00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,810\nan investigation,\nwe need all that information.\n\n144\n00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,420\nAnd as you said in 500 series,\nso the event IDs,\n\n145\n00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,650\nI think is what you're referring to there?\n\n146\n00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,900\n>> Yeah, they stick right in\nthat 500 range somewhere.\n\n147\n00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,318\nSo, you might be able to\nfilter down on that and\n\n148\n00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:57,660\nsee if that gives you\nsome good information.\n\n149\n00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,982\nBut, don't just limit yourself to that,\nget used to kind of looking through there.\n\n150\n00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,177\nEspecially for that.\n\n151\n00:08:03,177 --> 00:08:05,697\nThat date and time range.\n\n152\n00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:12,510\nLook to see what you have for\nthat specific range.\n\n153\n00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,518\nI was looking for\na better word, but whatever.\n\n154\n00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:19,560\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then with our.\n\n155\n00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,390\nWhere was I going with that?\n\n156\n00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,220\nSo, with those logging capabilities there,\nin Windows at least,\n\n157\n00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,150\nyou can also filter by keywords and\nas Sean mentioned, we're gonna bring this\n\n158\n00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,790\nback around in a little bit, but,\ndate and time, very important.\n\n159\n00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,760\nAnd when we're looking at those log files,\n\n160\n00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,050\nwe have the ability to filter\ndown to just a certain range.\n\n161\n00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,850\nSo if I know something took\nplace at a particular time, and\n\n162\n00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,200\nwithin a particular time frame,\nI can go to my log files, and\n\n163\n00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,740\nI can pull events just from\nthat particular time frame.\n\n164\n00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,840\nWhich just helps me limit\nwhat I have to go through.\n\n165\n00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,820\nI've already got enough that I'm\ngonna have to try to dive through.\n\n166\n00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,850\nSo if I can limit it at all, kinda start\nnarrowing the focus of my investigation\n\n167\n00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,220\ndown, that can be a big help.\n\n168\n00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,220\n>> Yeah, go back just to kind of give you\na peek ahead, go back to what we had in\n\n169\n00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,830\nour prior episodes, where we looked\nat collecting volatile information,\n\n170\n00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,500\nand other types of\ninformation off the system.\n\n171\n00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,520\nThat may be stuff that you also go back\nto the log files, after you've gathered\n\n172\n00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,130\nthe log files, you may go to that\ninformation, and look to see,\n\n173\n00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,920\nyou know, the who, what, where, and when,\nand then use that to narrow it down.\n\n174\n00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,140\nBecause yeah, you're gonna have a lot\nof stuff in the average log file.\n\n175\n00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,340\nYou know it, I know it, we all know it,\nthere's gonna be a lot of stuff in there.\n\n176\n00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,910\nSo get these things to work for you,\nI mean, gather the whole log, absolutely,\n\n177\n00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:40,515\nas part of your information gathering\nprocess, but once you have those, start\n\n178\n00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:44,415\nlooking at other sources of information,\nto see if you can narrow it down a bit.\n\n179\n00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:46,665\nNow that's a little different\nthan what I'm talking about,\n\n180\n00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:49,710\na little different than the correlation\nwe're gonna talk about here,\n\n181\n00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,085\nbecause that does have a significance\nwithin the world of logging and\n\n182\n00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:57,305\nauditing, but do whatever you\ncan to narrow your stuff down.\n\n183\n00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,660\nAnd fortunately they do make tools for\nthat.\n\n184\n00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,272\nYou know, if I remember correctly,\nthis is the one in Windows,\n\n185\n00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:03,465\nis in narrow it down by range?\n\n186\n00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:05,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You can choose that too.\n\n187\n00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,320\nI thought it did, so you can do\nthat with just about any log file.\n\n188\n00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,750\nYou can narrow it down to and\n\n189\n00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,180\ngive it specific parameters\nto get a better look at it.\n\n190\n00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,640\nJust keep those in mind\nto make your life easier.\n\n191\n00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,550\n>> And just to give you an idea, if you\nhaven't worked in these log file systems\n\n192\n00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,220\nor have a lot of experience in server.\n\n193\n00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,820\nOne.\nGo back and check our server episodes and\n\n194\n00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,430\nyou'll learn how to create those\ncustom views and things like that.\n\n195\n00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,140\nBut it's not uncommon to walk into a\nserver and look at that security log, and\n\n196\n00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,120\ndepending on what level of auditing\nyou're doing on that sever,\n\n197\n00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,800\nyou could have hundreds of thousand of\nentries on there, just from a single day.\n\n198\n00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,110\nSo you can imagine trying\nto parse through those and\n\n199\n00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,220\nfind the important information and\nthen across multiple servers.\n\n200\n00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,510\nAnd client machines and routers and\nthings like that so, it does get to be\n\n201\n00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:56,040\na little bit overwhelming, I guess.\n\n202\n00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,680\nIt can.\n\n203\n00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,660\n>> It could be a big mess.\n\n204\n00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> At least it'll look like it going in,\n\n205\n00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,640\nyou guys know what I'm talking about.\n\n206\n00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,040\nSo yeah.\n\n207\n00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,280\n>> Exactly.\n\n208\n00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,570\nWe've got our Windows logs and again we\nmentioned the main three that we've got.\n\n209\n00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,850\nThe system log, where the operating\nsystem can record events,\n\n210\n00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,010\nyou've got the application log, where\nthe applications can record events and\n\n211\n00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,980\nthen you've got the security log,\nwhere all of your auditing gets dumped to.\n\n212\n00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,390\nApplication logs, other than that,\nwhen we talk about the application log\n\n213\n00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,670\nwithin the event in your system,\nI'm talking about, there's the three logs.\n\n214\n00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,260\nOne of them's called Application, and\nit's kind of a generic log file for\n\n215\n00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,370\nall applications that dump information in.\n\n216\n00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,530\nApplications that don't\nget their own event log.\n\n217\n00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,870\nBut as we mentioned in\nthe beginning of the show, Sean,\n\n218\n00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,680\nsometimes these bigger servers and\n\n219\n00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,300\napplications that we run on Windows\nget their own application logs, right?\n\n220\n00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,510\n>> Yeah, they seem to get stuff in,\nMicrosoft seems to be kind of odd,\n\n221\n00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,820\nit seems on some of their stuff.\n\n222\n00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,378\nLike no one said that before.\n\n223\n00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:53,364\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But they'll seem to have, they'll put\n\n224\n00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:57,720\na good amount of stuff in the application\nlog, but then a lot of them will have\n\n225\n00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,966\ntheir own logs off to the side that\nyou've gotta hunt around and look for.\n\n226\n00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:06,680\nAnd heck, if my memory serves,\nin the new event logs,\n\n227\n00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:13,370\nI believe Windows also has one that's\nvery specific to certain services.\n\n228\n00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,460\nNot all of them though.\n\n229\n00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,790\nSo that may not help you, but if you\ngo down the list and there are specific\n\n230\n00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,940\nWindows logs for very specific services,\nsometimes that may help you.\n\n231\n00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,960\nBut that still doesn't get you out of\nhaving to look with that individual\n\n232\n00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,520\napplication because any of you that\nhave worked with Windows server and\n\n233\n00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,100\nhave looked at any of those\nthings that we install,\n\n234\n00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,150\nyou know on any of those applications\nthat you install on top of Windows,\n\n235\n00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,350\nthat they do have various\nlogs that they put in place.\n\n236\n00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,472\nSome of them don't even log that\nmuch until you check certain option.\n\n237\n00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:51,630\nSome of them don't do anything at\nall until you check certain options.\n\n238\n00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,150\nSo, it's kind of an interesting thing,\nbut you will kind of have to get used to\n\n239\n00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,030\nlooking for these things and this is\nthe tedious part we're talking about.\n\n240\n00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,920\nIt's not just going to the log files, it's\nalso you may have to search through their\n\n241\n00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,480\nhad drive and look for all different forms\nthey take, they may not be a .log file,\n\n242\n00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,535\nit may be embedded inside a database or\nsomething else.\n\n243\n00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:12,485\nAnd then, yeah, you gotta go look for it.\n\n244\n00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:13,645\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n245\n00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:15,085\nAnd as Sean mentioned,\n\n246\n00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:18,435\nif part of our job is, well,\nnot in the investigation side of things,\n\n247\n00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:22,415\nbut a lot of it has to do with what\nthey've enabled, what they're logging.\n\n248\n00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:25,260\nCuz as you said, I can install DHCP.\n\n249\n00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,500\nAnd I can, it's going to do some logging,\nbut I have to go in there and\n\n250\n00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,480\nenable DHCP audit, if I want to\nget more detailed information.\n\n251\n00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,640\nSame thing with DNS.\n\n252\n00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,380\nDNS has a couple of logs that it keeps,\n\n253\n00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,160\nits operational log and then it's got\na debug log as well, which we typically\n\n254\n00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,560\ndon't turn on because it eats up a lot\nof resources having to log everything.\n\n255\n00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,530\nSo, some of them might be\ndetermined by what they've enabled,\n\n256\n00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,410\nwhat are they logging.\n\n257\n00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,040\nI know that we're going to talk,\nbecause that's an important part of this.\n\n258\n00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,940\nWe're going to talk about\nwhat we need to log,\n\n259\n00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,240\nand how we do that here in\njust a little bit as well.\n\n260\n00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,890\nSo, we've got all of these\ndifferent application logs,\n\n261\n00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,110\nthey might be specific to the application.\n\n262\n00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,340\nAnd, as we've said, Windows has recently,\n\n263\n00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,410\nwith a new event log system, started\npulling a lot of those log files in.\n\n264\n00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,380\nIn the past,\nwe had those three big logs, and\n\n265\n00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,420\nthen if you wanted to go get the DNS log,\nyou had to know where DNS kept.\n\n266\n00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,310\nIf you wanted to get that DHCP log,\nyou had to know where DHCP kept it.\n\n267\n00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,055\nNow the event viewer system\ngives us access to all this.\n\n268\n00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:21,755\nAnd if you ever go in there, and\nyou should, you expand out Microsoft and\n\n269\n00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:25,965\nyou expand out Windows and you'll see\nthere's just a whole ton of log files.\n\n270\n00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,345\nThey're just making it easier for\nus to find because now,\n\n271\n00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,200\nthey're all in that one location.\n\n272\n00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,440\n>> Yes.\n\n273\n00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,290\nThat's a feature I like.\n\n274\n00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,010\nThat's a feature I was talking about.\n\n275\n00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,135\nOh yeah.\n>> It's like, thank you Microsoft.\n\n276\n00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:37,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n277\n00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,770\nit's one of those moments where you go\nlike, why didn't we start like this?\n\n278\n00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,610\nWhy did this take a few years to get done?\n\n279\n00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,240\nBut you know, at least we have it now.\n\n280\n00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,870\nYeah, so\nwe've got the Windows logs themselves,\n\n281\n00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,360\nwe've got the application logs,\ndepending on what apps are running,\n\n282\n00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,830\nthat's going to determine what\nadditional log files you have,\n\n283\n00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,840\nas well as what logging levels\nthey've set on those servers.\n\n284\n00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,670\nAnd then we've got security logs, and not\njust from our Windows operating system.\n\n285\n00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,900\n>> Yeah.\nThat's where it gets kind of interesting.\n\n286\n00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,260\nYou know,\nif you can say that about this at least.\n\n287\n00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,080\nWhen you look at, when you talk about\nsecurity logs, we're talking about those\n\n288\n00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,720\nother things that may be of use to you,\nthat you may consider going after.\n\n289\n00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,590\nThere are firewall logs, there are router\nlogs, there, you know, anything like that.\n\n290\n00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,590\nAnd they can cover quite\na bit of ground here.\n\n291\n00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,880\nYou know,\na lot of devices will keep their own logs.\n\n292\n00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,470\nAnd if you determine during your\ninvestigation that that attack involves\n\n293\n00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,490\nmore than that individual system or the\nincident involves more that the individual\n\n294\n00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,580\nsystem, then you may very well have to\nretrieve the logs off of those devices.\n\n295\n00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,021\nAnd that brings a whole other level\nof expertise to the whole mix,\n\n296\n00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:49,948\nthat you have to figure out and\ngo through.\n\n297\n00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:52,201\nYou know, we have the IDS logs,\n\n298\n00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,551\nin the ethical hacking course\nwe talked about what IDS's do.\n\n299\n00:15:56,551 --> 00:16:03,089\nThis is their time to shine is if\nthe Attack came across the network.\n\n300\n00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:06,324\nThey may very well have,\nand they should we hope,\n\n301\n00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:10,250\nhave evidence of that\nparticular incident occurring.\n\n302\n00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,840\nSo, we can use that to help us out.\n\n303\n00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,460\n>> Absolutely.\n\n304\n00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,890\nSo we've got our firewalls and\nour logging, the packets that are coming\n\n305\n00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,980\nin and out of that network and\npackets that they've dropped potentially.\n\n306\n00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:26,450\nYou've got your IDSs that are logging\npossible attacks, maybe IDSs and IPSs.\n\n307\n00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,380\nWe've got our honey pots.\n\n308\n00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,470\nIf we're running one of those, those\nusually have a very good logging system,\n\n309\n00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,020\nbecause it's kind of the whole point of\na honey pot is to capture the information.\n\n310\n00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,150\nSo, another good source of log files.\n\n311\n00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,130\n>> Yes, honey pots are a very good one,\nand if you didn't get a chance to\n\n312\n00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,900\nexperiment with those,\ngoing through our CEH stuff.\n\n313\n00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,020\nWe'll, try to kind of work that into here.\n\n314\n00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,660\nAnd show you a little bit with honey pots.\n\n315\n00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,832\nBecause that, as Mike was saying,\nthat's what they're for.\n\n316\n00:16:54,832 --> 00:16:57,440\nIs that they are put out\nthere as a decoy and\n\n317\n00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,820\nas something to attract and attacker or\nsomeone that has malicious intent.\n\n318\n00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,650\nSo that may very well contain\ninformation that's useful to you, so\n\n319\n00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,500\nyou can see okay,\nthis is what they're trying to do.\n\n320\n00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,220\nAnd just one more piece of\nevidence you could use to prove or\n\n321\n00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,690\nsupport a specific case or\nline of thinking.\n\n322\n00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,540\n>> Yeah, exactly.\nThey might have hit that honey pot\n\n323\n00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,510\nas part of their attack, and\nleft some trace of what they were doing.\n\n324\n00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,200\nOr how they got in over there as well as\non the systems that they actually hit.\n\n325\n00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,180\nOr whatever the case may be.\n\n326\n00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,810\nAnd then our hardware devices,\n\n327\n00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,460\nthey can log information as well\nhardware and servers like our routers.\n\n328\n00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,390\n>> Yeah.\n\n329\n00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:42,200\nLike we're saying, just about every\nitem out there that you can think of,\n\n330\n00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,800\ntypically gonna have some sort of log.\n\n331\n00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,660\nEven those home wireless routers,\nthey can keep a log.\n\n332\n00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,650\nTo a certain degree.\n\n333\n00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,110\nThey might not be as\nforensically valuables.\n\n334\n00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,760\nThe ones we have in a full\nblown operating system.\n\n335\n00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,100\nBut they do keep it.\n\n336\n00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,640\nSo, we have those, and just to kind\nof expand this out a bit more.\n\n337\n00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,770\nYou may even find it useful at\nsome point to ask your ISP, if\n\n338\n00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:12,600\nthey have logs and things like that that\nyou can use as part of the investigation.\n\n339\n00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,560\nBecause they've,\n\n340\n00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,280\nif it went out across their network\nthey may very well have that.\n\n341\n00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,450\nHowever, the rub there is,\nor at least one of them,\n\n342\n00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,550\nis that you are going to\nhave to narrow down a range,\n\n343\n00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,030\nand you may very well have to get\na search warrant at that point.\n\n344\n00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,990\nExpect to have to get a search warrant, or\n\n345\n00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,850\nI guess a subpoena at that\npoint to get that information.\n\n346\n00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,070\nSo, they're gonna need to know\nspecifically what you're looking for.\n\n347\n00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,140\nAnd you subpoena that, and\nunless they're being really generous and\n\n348\n00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,200\nsaying yeah sure,\nwe'll give it to you but.\n\n349\n00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,060\n>> Does that happen often?\n\n350\n00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,591\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah, don't count on it.\n\n351\n00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,937\n>> Yeah cuz now all of a sudden,\n\n352\n00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:50,982\nremember now if we're talking about the\nISPs log files, there's other information\n\n353\n00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:54,580\nin those log files other than\nthe point of our investigation.\n\n354\n00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,690\nSo, we've got privacy concerns and\n\n355\n00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,550\nthings that when we deal with any\ntype of service, cloud service.\n\n356\n00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,350\nYeah, and\nremember we were talking about that,\n\n357\n00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,700\nwhen you do involve an outside entity\nsuch an ISP, or any service provider.\n\n358\n00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,090\nIf you gather information from one of\nthose, from one of those entities,\n\n359\n00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,770\nor even an individual company.\n\n360\n00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,540\nIf you gather more information,\nwhich is gonna happen because you're gonna\n\n361\n00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,140\nwanna error on the side of caution and\ntry to grab a little bit more.\n\n362\n00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,270\nBe a little bit looser on your criteria,\nso you can gather some of\n\n363\n00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,440\nwhatever you need, you might very well get\nsome extra stuff as part of that search.\n\n364\n00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,220\nYou have responsibility,\nas we said, to keep that private.\n\n365\n00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,860\nISP has got that exact same thing,\nthey have to keep those things private, so\n\n366\n00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,990\nwhen you're doing a search, they're\ngoing to, or asking for certain things,\n\n367\n00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,800\nthey're gonna ask for certain parameters.\n\n368\n00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,800\nAnd if they don't fit, they may very well\ncome back and say we can't help you out.\n\n369\n00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,500\nSo you're going to have to be reasonably\nspecific about what you want, and\n\n370\n00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,760\nanything that you get outside of that,\n\n371\n00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,030\nyou might very well have an additional\nresponsibility for privacy as they do.\n\n372\n00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,510\nThat’s why in a lot of cases\nthere gonna be very touchy.\n\n373\n00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,250\nThey're gonna have you feel\nout a lot of paper work, and\n\n374\n00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,720\nthey’re definitely gonna\nwanna see a subpoena.\n\n375\n00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,820\nAnd all those things to make\nsure that they're covered.\n\n376\n00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,140\nThat's the name of the game.\n\n377\n00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,841\n>> [CROSSTALK] They're doing\nthe CYA on that information.\n\n378\n00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:25,349\nBecause once they, they don't wanna\ngive you anybody's information that they\n\n379\n00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,960\nare supposed to be keeping private.\n\n380\n00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,810\nSo if you have\nthe appropriate subpoenas and\n\n381\n00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,370\nwhat have you, now they can say all\nright we were forced to give you this.\n\n382\n00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,410\nYou're now responsible for keeping that\ninformation and the privacy of our\n\n383\n00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,620\ncustomer safe, and only exposing\nwhat's part of your investigation.\n\n384\n00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,480\nSo, that's the CYA for\nthose ISPs, and things like that.\n\n385\n00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,730\nSo lots of different logs?\n\n386\n00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,520\nWhen it comes down to it, there\nare logs on just about everything, and\n\n387\n00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,650\nour job is to find all those logs.\n\n388\n00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,690\nWe need to know what logs exist, we\nneed to know where to look for them, and\n\n389\n00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,430\nwe're gonna talk later about how we\ngo about sorting through these, and\n\n390\n00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,110\nwhittle it down to the important\ninformation that we're looking for.\n\n391\n00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,450\nSo what to log?\n\n392\n00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,900\nThat's another question which might or\nmight not be,\n\n393\n00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,340\nsomething that we can deal\nwith during the investigation.\n\n394\n00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,090\nBut, it is something I think\nwe should talk about, because,\n\n395\n00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,830\nas part of a company, you might be asked.\n\n396\n00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,470\nWhat do we need to log so\n\n397\n00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,560\nthat, if there ever is a need to do an\ninvestigation we have what's appropriate?\n\n398\n00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,190\n>> Yes, that's an important thing.\n\n399\n00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,290\nMake sure you are, if you're involved with\nsetting up this system, make sure you're\n\n400\n00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:35,330\ngetting relevant information based on\nyour experience, and what have you.\n\n401\n00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,750\nGathering information after the fact, or\n\n402\n00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,464\nlogging stuff after the fact,\nmay not be all that helpful.\n\n403\n00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:43,373\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It might be, but that's few and\n\n404\n00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:45,920\nfar between,\ndon't expect it all of a sudden.\n\n405\n00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,530\nIt's helpful, I gathered after the fact.\n\n406\n00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:53,010\nAnd as we're gonna talk as we go later\non through this section, we're gonna\n\n407\n00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:57,590\nsee that there's certain little things\nwith adjusting logs, that even though your\n\n408\n00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,490\ngathering certain information,\nit may very well not be admissible.\n\n409\n00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,320\n>> Right.\n>> Which is actually surprising\n\n410\n00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,780\nto a lot of people, when you first look\nat this it's like well I'm logging it,\n\n411\n00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,950\nit's admissible.\n\n412\n00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,065\nNo it isn't.\n\n413\n00:22:09,065 --> 00:22:12,310\n>> [LAUGH] It is very frustrating\nI know for a lot of people.\n\n414\n00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,180\nBecause they think hey,\nI've got a record of what happened, why\n\n415\n00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,650\nare you saying that I can't use this in\na court of law or during my investigation?\n\n416\n00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,960\nAnd there's some specific cases\nwhere it won't be accepted, and\n\n417\n00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,220\nthat can be very frustrating.\n\n418\n00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,250\nWhich is why it's very important for\nus to understand that,\n\n419\n00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,460\nbecause we might be gathering information.\n\n420\n00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,410\nAnd we should be able to tell by looking\nat the information we're gathering,\n\n421\n00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,932\nthat this isn't going to work.\n\n422\n00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:37,580\nWe're gonna need other information or\nother ways to prove this,\n\n423\n00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,080\nbecause these are not gonna be\naccepted by the court of law.\n\n424\n00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,700\n>> Yes, there's definitely certain\nlimits they will place upon this, and\n\n425\n00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,940\nthe type of information that can be\ngathered and when it can be gathered?\n\n426\n00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,220\nHow it's gathered, all of that?\n\n427\n00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,930\nThose will all come to bear if you\never have to take this to a courtroom,\n\n428\n00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,860\nthey're gonna expect certain\nthings to be satisfied.\n\n429\n00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:05,640\nIf they're not then, can expect certain\nevidence that you have to be downgraded.\n\n430\n00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,830\nMaybe there will still be evidenced but\nit will be downgraded in value or\n\n431\n00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,250\nmaybe it's just gonna be discarded,\nbecause it's just not\n\n432\n00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,280\nIt's just not something that fits\nnormally accepted standards.\n\n433\n00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,110\nIt's not reliable, it's not\nsomething that's relevant to it or\n\n434\n00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,550\nadmissible, and\nthey're just going to chuck it.\n\n435\n00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,280\nSo be aware of the type of information\nthat you should be logging.\n\n436\n00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,320\nAnd it's gonna vary with everything.\n\n437\n00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,380\nIt can vary with every different service,\nand every different situation,\n\n438\n00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,190\nyou're going to see.\n\n439\n00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:40,600\nYou're gonna see various things, DNS it\ncan be one thing, DHCP it can be another.\n\n440\n00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,320\nIAS or a web server,\nthere's other things you can do with that.\n\n441\n00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,237\nEven on the web server side of it,\n\n442\n00:23:46,237 --> 00:23:49,946\nthere's application level logging\nthere that can take place.\n\n443\n00:23:49,946 --> 00:23:53,837\nSo, you're gonna have took at\nall these little things, and\n\n444\n00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:58,048\nbe able to recognize what's useful for\nlogging and what isn't.\n\n445\n00:23:58,048 --> 00:24:02,553\nSome of the stuff you can enable after\nthe fact, after whatever happened.\n\n446\n00:24:02,553 --> 00:24:06,936\nIf there's use for you to do that,\nbut those are very cases and\n\n447\n00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:09,152\nthere's limits on those too.\n\n448\n00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:12,330\nI'm gonna give you so\nmuch wiggle room on whether or not,\n\n449\n00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,280\nyou're allowed to enable\nsomething after the fact.\n\n450\n00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,720\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n451\n00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,470\nas far as when we talk about what to log,\n\n452\n00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,920\nthis is something that there is\nno right or wrong answer, right?\n\n453\n00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,020\nThere is no black or white as what you\nshould log, and what you shouldn't log.\n\n454\n00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,060\nIt's one of those things that\nyou almost have to feel out.\n\n455\n00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,175\nWhen I always teaching auditing and\nlogging, it's very easy to over-audit.\n\n456\n00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:38,790\nWe think, I just wanna grab\neverything that I possibly can, and\n\n457\n00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,930\nwhat ends up happening is we\nget these massive log files.\n\n458\n00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,940\nAnd it becomes difficult to find\nthe information that's important.\n\n459\n00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,090\nSo we really don't wanna over-ride, we\nwanna focus our auditing to what we need,\n\n460\n00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,506\nbut at the same time it's\nalso very easy to under-ride.\n\n461\n00:24:51,506 --> 00:24:54,840\nYou're thinking all right, well I don't\nreally need to know this stuff or this and\n\n462\n00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,730\nI'll just not audit it.\n\n463\n00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,900\nThat'll limit my log files, and\nmake it a little bit easier to work with.\n\n464\n00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,710\nAnd I always use the example of\nsomebody cracking a password.\n\n465\n00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,800\nLet's say we were auditing\nlog in events in Windows.\n\n466\n00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,650\nWe're logging our catalog events\nif it's a domain type log on.\n\n467\n00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,480\nAnd I think, what,\nI'm just gonna audit failures\n\n468\n00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,620\nbecause I know I'm gonna have\nsuccessful logons all day long.\n\n469\n00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,850\nI've got my employees coming in and\nthey're logging in,\n\n470\n00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,430\nand that would generate an event and\nI don't wanna see it.\n\n471\n00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,700\nSo, I'm just gonna do failures\nbecause that's really all I need.\n\n472\n00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,118\nSo, what happens is,\nI go look in my log file.\n\n473\n00:25:26,118 --> 00:25:30,000\nAnd at 1:30AM in the morning I see failed\nlog in attempt, failed log in attempt,\n\n474\n00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,940\nfailed log in attempt.\n\n475\n00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,280\nOne after the other.\n\n476\n00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,790\nNo body should be on the network\n1:30AM in the morning,\n\n477\n00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,580\nthis is probably somebody doing some\npassword guessing trying to break in.\n\n478\n00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,130\nSo, there they are just 1:30 to 1:40AM\njust boom boom failed log in attempts.\n\n479\n00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,600\nAt 1:40AM they stop, and I see no more.\n\n480\n00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,790\nNow the question is,\ndid they get scared and run away?\n\n481\n00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,700\nDid somebody walk up on them?\n\n482\n00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,340\nDid they give up and go home, or\n\n483\n00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,430\ndid they successfully log on and\nnow have access to the system?\n\n484\n00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,920\nAnd if I wasn't auditing success,\nI wouldn't see that part, right?\n\n485\n00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,260\nI was just doing the failures and\nat 1:41, they finally got successful.\n\n486\n00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,310\nAnd I didn't capture that.\n\n487\n00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,550\nSo, it's a matter of thinking about it.\n\n488\n00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,630\nWhat is it we really need to capture.\n\n489\n00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,440\nAnd you should, in my opinion,\nI don't know about you,\n\n490\n00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,760\nSean, getting more is always\nbetter than getting less, right?\n\n491\n00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,550\nToo much is better than not enough.\n\n492\n00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:25,090\n>> Yes, I'd add to that just a little bit.\n\n493\n00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:33,070\nWithin reason it's very easy\nto over audit and over log.\n\n494\n00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,800\nYou can choose to check every\nbox on the console if you want.\n\n495\n00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,090\nAnd you'll get everything.\n\n496\n00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:45,270\nAnd if it sounds like, well heck, if I get\neverything, I know I'm not gonna get it.\n\n497\n00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,700\nWell that may not be true, and\nalso I would encourage you,\n\n498\n00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,320\ngo look at, go back and look at\nthe stuff we talked about, the CEH.\n\n499\n00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,670\nOne of the ways I may try\nto get one value is by\n\n500\n00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,640\nseeing if I can get a bunch of\nstuff thrown into the event logs.\n\n501\n00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,470\nI will cuz an attack to happen.\n\n502\n00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,500\nThat just generates a lot of erroneous and\n\n503\n00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,150\nbogus events, and\nthat will fill up your log.\n\n504\n00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,580\nAnd you're gonna have to\nsort through all that stuff.\n\n505\n00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,020\nAnd so if I generate enough of that,\nand you have to sort through all this,\n\n506\n00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,360\nthe chances become greater and\ngreater that you're gonna miss something.\n\n507\n00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,560\nAnd so just be aware that\ngathering too much information\n\n508\n00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,915\ncould be, it could work against you too.\n\n509\n00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:28,330\nBut, fortunately we do have some tools.\n\n510\n00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,940\nBut still, if there's enough\nthrown at you it's easy for\n\n511\n00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,420\nthe brain to get overwhelmed.\n\n512\n00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,680\nSo, I agree.\n\n513\n00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,960\nIt's great to get more than you need,\nthan go the other way.\n\n514\n00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:47,050\nBut also, we're not saying gather\neverything, we're saying within reason.\n\n515\n00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:51,920\nIf you had a choice between\nturning a feature on or off, and\n\n516\n00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,710\nit's gonna cuz you to generate\njust a little bit more, then fine.\n\n517\n00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,190\nGo for that, that's safer.\n\n518\n00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,980\nMaybe you're gonna get a lot\nof stuff you don't need, but\n\n519\n00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,690\nit only takes a couple things to pay off.\n\n520\n00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,100\nBut yeah, don't log everything.\n\n521\n00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,430\nThere's been people that have\ndone that and they paid for it.\n\n522\n00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,760\nIn performance and just time and\nmoney, and everything else.\n\n523\n00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,080\n>> It's not that these log\nfiles are huge file size wise.\n\n524\n00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,910\nBut when you're talking about hundreds of\nthousands of events, and these things and\n\n525\n00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,390\nthey cross multiple systems and\nthings like that.\n\n526\n00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,420\nIf I can limit it in anyway\nI would like to but,\n\n527\n00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,490\nwe can't take a chance on\nmissing any information.\n\n528\n00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,500\nAnd I don't wanna be the reason why\nwe can't take this case any further,\n\n529\n00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,640\nbecause I didn't log\nthe proper information.\n\n530\n00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,850\nWe don't want that to happen, so.\n\n531\n00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,880\nAll right.\nWell, I'll tell you what.\n\n532\n00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,470\nLadies and gentlemen, it's about time for\nus to take our break.\n\n533\n00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,420\nSo we're gonna step away.\n\n534\n00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,780\nAnd when we come back,\nwe're gonna continue on with Log and\n\n535\n00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,600\nEvent Correlation.\n\n536\n00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,189\nSo stay tuned.\n\n537\n00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:50,525\nWe'll be right back.\n[MUSIC]\n\n538\n00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:52,720\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n539\n00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,670\nSo, continuing our discussion on log and\nevent correlation, next thing we wanna\n\n540\n00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:02,410\ntalk about Sean is some legal issues that\nwe might have and really talking about.\n\n541\n00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,030\nWhat it is I need to log, and\nhow it needs to be set up,\n\n542\n00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,180\nbecause as we were saying\na bit earlier in the episode,\n\n543\n00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:11,820\nthere are times when I might have logs and\ncan't use them?\n\n544\n00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,680\n>> Yeah,\nthat's a sad day when that happens,\n\n545\n00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,680\nespecially after you've gone\nthrough all that work and.\n\n546\n00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,850\nTo kind of sort these things down and\nget the information you need and\n\n547\n00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,420\nthen all of a sudden nope\nit's not going to be usable.\n\n548\n00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,930\nIt's like you wanna pull your hair out and\nall that.\n\n549\n00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:32,970\nSo, could be a problem so we got to\ntalk about it's really important for\n\n550\n00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,400\nyou to understand the issues legally\nas far as collecting information,\n\n551\n00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,340\nhow to collect it, when to collect it?\n\n552\n00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,400\nThose are all going to be critical to the\nsuccess of you being able to use these log\n\n553\n00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,900\nfiles, in the context of your case.\n\n554\n00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,950\nThat's just the long and short of it.\n\n555\n00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,170\nWe've got a lot of\ndetail work here though.\n\n556\n00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,250\n>> We do, and I think probably one of\nthe first things we've got to think about\n\n557\n00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,759\nis when we talk about logging.\n\n558\n00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,020\nSeems like a no brainer,\nbut we do have to say it.\n\n559\n00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,677\nIt needs to be generated when\nthe event occurs, right?\n\n560\n00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:07,430\n>> Yes, if it's not generated when\nthe event occurs, it's pointless.\n\n561\n00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,040\nIt can't be something that would\ngenerate after the fact or\n\n562\n00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,930\nyou kind of Cobbled together.\n\n563\n00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,176\nI mean it sounds like well after the fact,\nokay well [CROSSTALK].\n\n564\n00:30:15,176 --> 00:30:17,570\n>> I'm just creating my own entry\nin the log file at this point.\n\n565\n00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,380\nHere, I'm gonna type out that Sean\naccessed my system at 10:15 in the evening\n\n566\n00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,140\nor something like that.\n\n567\n00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,170\n>> Yeah,\nnot gonna fly in a normal investigation.\n\n568\n00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,760\n>> Yeah, it definitely won't.\n\n569\n00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,370\nThey will not scrutinize that.\n\n570\n00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,890\nThey'll ask what's the significance of\nthis, and if you can't explain why you\n\n571\n00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,700\nfelt it was necessary to show\nsomething after the event?\n\n572\n00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,840\nThen it's a dead issue,\nit's not gonna come into the court.\n\n573\n00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,730\nNow there might be some cases\nwhere that might be useful,\n\n574\n00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:49,070\nto kind of show other fallout that\nhappened, from the primary event.\n\n575\n00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,280\nBut those are very specific situations.\n\n576\n00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,720\nAnd you'll pretty much know them when you\nsee them, when you have secondary damage\n\n577\n00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,940\nor stuff like that occurring,\nwhen maybe a worm is spreading.\n\n578\n00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,560\nOr malware's getting onto their systems,\n\n579\n00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,630\nwhat have you,\nthen that might come in to play?\n\n580\n00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,340\n>> All right.\nSo for\n\n581\n00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,540\nthe most part,\nlogging events, it's useful.\n\n582\n00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:13,348\nAnd it's gonna be acceptable as\nlong as it's generated live.\n\n583\n00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:15,860\nI should, but one of the key factors is,\n\n584\n00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,850\nit's gotta be generated\nat the time of the event.\n\n585\n00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,580\nIt must be authentic.\n\n586\n00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,610\nYeah that's,\nit kind of sounds ambiguous don't it.\n\n587\n00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,880\n>> Yeah, it does.\n\n588\n00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,284\n[LAUGH] Well, what we mean by it has\nto be authentic we have to know that it\n\n589\n00:31:29,284 --> 00:31:31,278\nactually was generated by that system.\n\n590\n00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,980\nAnd we're 100% sure that that is the fact\nthat it came from that system, where we've\n\n591\n00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:42,400\ngot a nice degree of confidence that\nit came from such-and-such a situation.\n\n592\n00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,280\nAnd, once we've gotten that,\nwe're in good shape, but\n\n593\n00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,550\nwe have to know what was generated by\nthat service during that situation.\n\n594\n00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,460\nThose are important criteria to get.\n\n595\n00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,726\nThose are generated by\na supporting service.\n\n596\n00:31:57,726 --> 00:32:02,892\nYou bring that in, let's say that does\nhappen, where we have a supporting\n\n597\n00:32:02,892 --> 00:32:07,331\nservice that maybe got impacted\na little bit during this event.\n\n598\n00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:10,930\nIt's a question of whether or\nnot it might actually be allowed or\n\n599\n00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,340\nnot because it's not giving\ndirect evidence of this stuff.\n\n600\n00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,770\nIt's not authentic from the actual event.\n\n601\n00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,390\nSo you have to have a way to\nauthenticate that specific log file.\n\n602\n00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,500\nIt was generated by the system and it was\ngenerated within a certain time frame.\n\n603\n00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,410\nYou know, if you can establish those,\nyou are in very good shape and we've got\n\n604\n00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:35,510\nways to do that, that's easy to do.\n\n605\n00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:40,320\nOn another episode I was\nshowing just using the date and\n\n606\n00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,010\ntime to run that and\nthen also bring the log file in it and\n\n607\n00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,990\nthen we could have at that point if\nwe were really playing by the rules,\n\n608\n00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,830\nwe could have hashed all that, and\ndone all that good stuff, and that\n\n609\n00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,070\nwould have gone a long way towards proving\nits authenticity and its integrity.\n\n610\n00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,860\n>> Yeah, absolutely, we know that, as in\nthe court systems, the defense attorneys,\n\n611\n00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,000\neverybody knows that.\n\n612\n00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,920\n>> IS Keeps Logger can be\nconfigured to keep a log.\n\n613\n00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,050\nIf I try to break out something I typed up\nin notepad that says, here's my IIS log,\n\n614\n00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,320\nnot quite authentic, right?\n\n615\n00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,025\nI mean, we gotta get the log file from the\nservice that was generating those events.\n\n616\n00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:15,940\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n617\n00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,560\nAnother big one, and this one I know threw\nme for a loop the first time I saw it.\n\n618\n00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,030\nI remember thinking, oh, wow, that's\nsomething I never would've thought of.\n\n619\n00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:28,520\nBut it must be kept as a part\nof a regular business operation.\n\n620\n00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,750\n>> Yeah, not the only one\nthat's been caught on that.\n\n621\n00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,720\nYou're definitely not.\n\n622\n00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,190\nWhat we mean by saying it has to be\nkept during part of our normal business\n\n623\n00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,740\noperation, it's something that It's\npart of your standard practices.\n\n624\n00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,320\nIt's not something that you set up\njust for that specific situation or\n\n625\n00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,380\ncame out of left field.\n\n626\n00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,560\nIt's something that you would\nnormally do when you operate.\n\n627\n00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,370\nYou log certain things, you have\nlogs that you collect a certain way.\n\n628\n00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:58,810\nThat you do certain things as part of\nyour standard operating procedure.\n\n629\n00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:02,700\nIf it's something that you just happen\nto make up and all of a sudden, and\n\n630\n00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,600\nI shouldn't say made up.\n\n631\n00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,380\nOr just all of a sudden implemented, that\nthere's gonna be a question it's you know,\n\n632\n00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,780\nwhy now, or, you know,\nwhy did you choose to do this?\n\n633\n00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,840\nNow, granted, there's going to\nbe a little bit of room on that,\n\n634\n00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,920\nespecially if you had a situation where it\nwas shown that you had maybe some sort of\n\n635\n00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:28,120\nplanning meeting or something, and decided\nthat you're logging wasn't sufficient,\n\n636\n00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,290\nor you weren't doing enough of it,\nor whatever reason you pick.\n\n637\n00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,940\nIf you chose, if you had some\nmeeting where you chose that hey,\n\n638\n00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,400\nwe have to tweak this\nto get better results.\n\n639\n00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,680\nOr to get what we need.\n\n640\n00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,870\nAnd then after that you caught it.\n\n641\n00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,100\nSometimes short time after that\nyou caught whatever incidence\n\n642\n00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,480\nit was that you observed.\n\n643\n00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,640\nAt that point you've got kind of\na president so that you have done it.\n\n644\n00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,650\nYou got all that justification.\n\n645\n00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:57,730\nIt wasn't somebody that just came\ncompletely out of left field and\n\n646\n00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,390\nsaid, oh, yeah, here we go.\n\n647\n00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,420\n>> It is an odd one, you know.\n\n648\n00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,790\nI understand it in the end, but\n\n649\n00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,520\nI remember when I first saw it,\nit was just kind of weird.\n\n650\n00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,350\nSo basically, let's say I suspected Nate\nwas doing something fishy on our servers.\n\n651\n00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,860\nI can't just fire up a logging system,\nstart capturing that information, and\n\n652\n00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,440\nthen expect to be able to use that,\nbecause what the courts\n\n653\n00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,690\nare going to do is, \"You don't audit\neverybody; you're just auditing Nate?\n\n654\n00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,110\nYou just implemented this right now; this\nisn't a part of your normal business\n\n655\n00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:29,330\npractice.\" So, we have to make sure\nthat we get this set up early.\n\n656\n00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,600\nIt's one of the things that as a company.\n\n657\n00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,910\nYou've gotta have a good audit procedure\nin place, so that if the event,\n\n658\n00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:40,930\nif in time it comes down to where I\nneed to use that in an investigation,\n\n659\n00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,490\nI can prove I have a history of auditing.\n\n660\n00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:46,230\nThis isn't something that I just\nturned on because I had a suspicion.\n\n661\n00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,390\nAnd to me, that bothered me.\n\n662\n00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,780\nI was like, well, wait.\n\n663\n00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,030\nI suspected something, I turned it on,\n\n664\n00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,220\nI captured it,\nI've got the information right here.\n\n665\n00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:59,680\nBut I can't do it because it's not\npart of my normal business operation.\n\n666\n00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,690\n>> Now you could, just to put\na little asterisk on the end of that,\n\n667\n00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,320\nif you did want to audit\na specific employee.\n\n668\n00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,410\nThere would at least need to be\nsomething leading up to that.\n\n669\n00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,540\nYou couldn't just snap your fingers and\nyou're logging it.\n\n670\n00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:19,510\nYou'd have to have a procedure that you\ngo through to say I've got suspicions,\n\n671\n00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,260\nand here's my things that go\ntowards having that suspicion.\n\n672\n00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,700\nAnd then you document that\nwith human resources, and\n\n673\n00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,020\nthen that starts getting logged.\n\n674\n00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,740\nThen you've established all these things\nthat support why I'm doing this, but\n\n675\n00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,640\nyou just can't all of\na sudden decide well,\n\n676\n00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,300\nI'm gonna start logging that\nbecause I feel like it.\n\n677\n00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,100\nIt's Monday, I'm gonna start logging it.\n\n678\n00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,400\nThat's not good enough, there has to\nbe something that backs up that claim.\n\n679\n00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,390\nSo it has to be part of normal business\noperations, so that's what we're talking\n\n680\n00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,700\nabout in both those cases where\nthey're already doing the logging, or\n\n681\n00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,720\nif you choose to start it up at least you\nhave something leading up to that saying,\n\n682\n00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,460\nwe had that suspicion, and\nthis is part of our procedure.\n\n683\n00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,660\nAs long as I can see that\nwe should be in good shape.\n\n684\n00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,950\n>> And it can't be random, right?\n\n685\n00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,670\nIt can't be just spot auditing\nwhere I'm gonna audit Nate\n\n686\n00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:16,550\nand not Daniel, or something like that.\n\n687\n00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,840\n>> We're not going to be\nable to leave this set.\n\n688\n00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,581\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n689\n00:37:19,581 --> 00:37:20,681\n>> Bob sue.\n\n690\n00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:21,689\nThere we go.\n\n691\n00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:25,401\n[LAUGH] But yeah, you can't just spot\n\n692\n00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:29,180\naudit or audit one employee or\none server and not the other servers.\n\n693\n00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,620\nIt can't be just random auditing right?\n\n694\n00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,140\n>> Yeah.\nIt can't,\n\n695\n00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,080\nagain it goes to that\nwhole of you can't just\n\n696\n00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,090\nchoose to make something up as you go.\n\n697\n00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,620\nHaving this random stuff,\nit doesn't show that you have any rhyme or\n\n698\n00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,010\nreason for\ndoing whatever it is that you're doing.\n\n699\n00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,570\nAnd that proves problematic because\nnow they're going to try to\n\n700\n00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:53,450\nget inside your head and try to figure\nout, why did you do it this way?\n\n701\n00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,130\nYou know,\nwhat choices lead you up to this?\n\n702\n00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,680\nSo, there's going to be a problem there.\n\n703\n00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,650\nYou're going to want to make\nsure you show consistency.\n\n704\n00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,450\nAnd can also show that\nconsistency of operations too.\n\n705\n00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,820\nBecause that would be another thing,\n\n706\n00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,620\nhow does if look [INAUDIBLE] on\nthe outside if you catch an event and\n\n707\n00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,540\nyou're saying oh look I caught one here,\nand I caught it here, and your logging, or\n\n708\n00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,670\nyour adjustments that you're\ndoing to your logging are random.\n\n709\n00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,900\nThere's no rhyme or reason to it.\n\n710\n00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:26,760\nIt just looks like, okay well, what about\nthe times that you weren't logging?\n\n711\n00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,930\nDid you miss something or\n\n712\n00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,730\nare you only showing me the stuff\nthat you want me to see?\n\n713\n00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,990\nNow that would be the big thing that I'd\nbe looking at if I saw some sort of random\n\n714\n00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:41,740\nlog in that didn't tell me why they\nchose to do this they just did it.\n\n715\n00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:46,210\nAre you covering something up and if you\ntell me no, yeah I'm going to believe you.\n\n716\n00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,810\n>> Some big old gaps in the log files\nwhere I've got hours where there\n\n717\n00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,430\nwas no auditing taking place or\nsomething like that not\n\n718\n00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,890\ngoing to look good to the court systems or\nto the investigations.\n\n719\n00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,090\nYeah.\nSo you wanna have that consistency.\n\n720\n00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:02,290\nYou definitely wanna show that there's\na track record there of doing things.\n\n721\n00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,420\nAnd changes do have the whole\nchange management process,\n\n722\n00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,210\ngoing through saying this\nis why we changed it.\n\n723\n00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:12,440\nSo, we've got it documented in black and\nwhite that there was a reason behind that.\n\n724\n00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,700\nIt wasn't just done,\nbecause someone in IT decided well heck,\n\n725\n00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,420\nwe're gonna change it\nbecause I feel like it.\n\n726\n00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,050\nIt can't be like that.\n\n727\n00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,900\nWe want to show consistency.\n\n728\n00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,260\n>> We had a question out\nthere in the chat room.\n\n729\n00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260\nJames asking,\nwhat if you audit everything and\n\n730\n00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,460\njust do not clear the logs like normal.\n\n731\n00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,970\nI would say a couple of\nthings to that James.\n\n732\n00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,270\nAnd one, don't ever clear your logs,\n\n733\n00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,645\nunless you're saving them,\nhopefully, right?\n\n734\n00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:39,900\n[LAUGH] If you capture the information,\ndo not clear them.\n\n735\n00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,440\nI hate that, on Microsoft,\nI know, for example.\n\n736\n00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,480\nYou go to clear the log, and\nit says, clear or save and clear.\n\n737\n00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,571\nI'm like just take the clear away,\n\n738\n00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:51,296\n[INAUDIBLE] should be the only option for\nthat.\n\n739\n00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:55,044\nBut, you want to keep that, that's\nwhy we logged in the first place, and\n\n740\n00:39:55,044 --> 00:39:55,961\nthat would work.\n\n741\n00:39:55,961 --> 00:40:00,446\nIt would just be some large log files,\nwhich just means more work in the end.\n\n742\n00:40:00,446 --> 00:40:04,146\nWhen it comes to getting the important,\npertinent information that I need for\n\n743\n00:40:04,146 --> 00:40:07,440\nmy investigation,\nI don't think anything wrong with it.\n\n744\n00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,230\nYour just,\nyou're guaranteed not to miss anything.\n\n745\n00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:16,430\n>> Yeah, you could make that case and say\nyou're guaranteed not to miss anything but\n\n746\n00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,999\nyeah you're right you're\ngonna have a lot of resources\n\n747\n00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:24,950\na lot of space being chewed up by that,\nand I think we both know\n\n748\n00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:29,750\nthat there are situations where they would\naudit everything, there's not too many.\n\n749\n00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,370\nIf that's what you determine it\nmeets your business needs or\n\n750\n00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:37,960\nwhatever responsibilities the law and\nother things have placed upon you,\n\n751\n00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,610\nthen we're not gonna sit here and\ngive you grief because you did it.\n\n752\n00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,430\nYou've justified it, but\n\n753\n00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:50,340\nbe aware that if you do log everything,\nthat's a lot of information.\n\n754\n00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,199\nYou're gonna chew up\ndisk space like crazy.\n\n755\n00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,058\n>> Absolutely.\n\n756\n00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:54,887\n>> Yeah.\n>> Another example I sometimes when\n\n757\n00:40:54,887 --> 00:40:58,349\nI'm teaching these Microsoft classes is,\nlike say my employee handbook,\n\n758\n00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:01,670\nright, everybody should be able\nto read the employee handbook.\n\n759\n00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,380\nWhat I want to know is if people are\nmaking changes to the employee handbook so\n\n760\n00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,920\nrather than to audit everything,\n\n761\n00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,540\nI'm not going to audit read\npermission over that handbook.\n\n762\n00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,130\nI'm gonna audit, modify permissions or\nwrite permissions on that.\n\n763\n00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,490\nAgain, so you see what I'm talking about?\n\n764\n00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,770\nLimiting what I'm logging,\nnot just logging everything out of\n\n765\n00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,790\nthe box because in the end it makes it so\ndifficult to find what you're looking for.\n\n766\n00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,030\nBut there are times, as you said,\n\n767\n00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,580\nI might have a server that has nothing but\nsecure information on it,\n\n768\n00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,750\nor I've got a server that this has\ngot healthcare information on it.\n\n769\n00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:36,470\nAnd yes, I need to audit every single\nbit of access to that server, so\n\n770\n00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,740\nI turn on everything.\n\n771\n00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,380\nBut in reality, usually are servers have\nsome things that we're not as concerned\n\n772\n00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,700\nwith, and that's what we mean by making\nsure that you're logging or your audit\n\n773\n00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,608\nplan fits your needs and captures\nwhat you need without going too far.\n\n774\n00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:52,340\nAll right.\n\n775\n00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,900\nWithout making the log\nfiles unnecessarily big,\n\n776\n00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,170\nbut we definitely don't\nwanna miss information.\n\n777\n00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:03,490\nThat's a big mistake, I would rather on\nthe side of too much than not enough.\n\n778\n00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,780\nI can always adjust down if I need to,\nbut if I miss information\n\n779\n00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,020\nIt's gone because a great segue into our\nnext one is it can't be generated or\n\n780\n00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,680\ncan't be established after the fact,\nright.\n\n781\n00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,410\n>> Yeah, and that just doesn't.\n\n782\n00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,590\nWhen you think about,\njust the sounds kinda like it makes sense.\n\n783\n00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,860\nIt's like,\nwell what would I do it after the fact.\n\n784\n00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:27,730\nYeah, you can't try to prove that\nsomething happened by just showing\n\n785\n00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:33,100\nthe aftermath of it that\ndoesn't really give me an idea.\n\n786\n00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,760\nIt's not like the real world.\n\n787\n00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,810\nYou see a big hole in the ground and\nsay well something went off here.\n\n788\n00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,720\nThat you can do.\n\n789\n00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,620\nDigital world it's a lot tougher,\nso you're gonna have to show\n\n790\n00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:51,100\nthat this is what it looked like before,\nand this is what it looked like after.\n\n791\n00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:57,250\nYou can't just show the after, and\nthat's not gonna help your case.\n\n792\n00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,260\nJust gonna say, okay,\nthat's what it looks like now.\n\n793\n00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,410\nWhat did it look like before?\n\n794\n00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:05,580\nDo you have anything that shows me that\nthese events actually occurred, then this,\n\n795\n00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,618\nbecause this doesn't tell me they\noccurred, you're telling me they occurred.\n\n796\n00:43:10,618 --> 00:43:14,010\nSo you've gotta have something that\nbacks up your claim that, yes,\n\n797\n00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,640\nthese events occurred, and\nthis is the fact that it had.\n\n798\n00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,160\nIf you can do that,\nthen you're in better shape, but\n\n799\n00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,710\nif you can't,\nthat could be a big problem for you.\n\n800\n00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,750\nA log after the fact in most\ncases is gonna be worthless.\n\n801\n00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:32,420\nIt's not gonna be worth\nthe paper it's printed on.\n\n802\n00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,960\nSo, just keep in mind now,\n\n803\n00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,060\nif there's secondary fires burning,\nthat's a different story.\n\n804\n00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,680\nSometimes an attack happens and\n\n805\n00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,500\nthere are other things that\nhappen as a result of it.\n\n806\n00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,820\nMaybe that may help you support those\nthings, but it's not necessarily gonna\n\n807\n00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,460\nhelp you support the primary event,\nwhich you would expect.\n\n808\n00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,570\n>> All right.\nAnd then something\n\n809\n00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,650\nelse we've gotta worry about is\nthe integrity of these log files.\n\n810\n00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,360\nRight?\nI can't just take a log file and\n\n811\n00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,800\nsay, this is it, here you go.\n\n812\n00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,900\nThese are my log files.\n\n813\n00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,550\nRight.\n\n814\n00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,690\nCourt might want some kind of\nverification outside of that?\n\n815\n00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:12,080\n>> Yeah and that's something that we had\nalready been bringing up on other files\n\n816\n00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,390\nand log files just another one, is we need\nto have a way to verify the integrity.\n\n817\n00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,360\nMake sure that those log files\nhave not been altered and\n\n818\n00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,770\nthat they're in the same state they\nwere when they were collected.\n\n819\n00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:25,340\n>> One of the things you'll notice and\nthat we'll get to,\n\n820\n00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:31,320\nis when you go into the WSCC, and\nthat's just one tool that can do this,\n\n821\n00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,420\nis you can actually dump the log files,\nthe event logs and all that.\n\n822\n00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:40,250\nYou can dump them to a file and then\nyou could hash that file quite easily.\n\n823\n00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,060\nSo you run your date,\nthen you run utility.\n\n824\n00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,090\nDump it out so you have the time and\ndate stamps matching, and\n\n825\n00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,000\nthen once you have that hash\nit in the bundle and boom.\n\n826\n00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,470\nYou've got proof there that,\nhey, these were not altered.\n\n827\n00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,150\nOr you could do it as part of your\nimaging process too if you want.\n\n828\n00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,610\nYou could grab an image of the system and\njust hash the whole thing.\n\n829\n00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:06,500\nBut It's probably gonna be good for\nyou to do both, realistically.\n\n830\n00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,950\nTo hash the image of the system, and then\nhash the individual log files as they're\n\n831\n00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:16,150\nharvested off the system so that we can\nshow that yes, these are the way they were\n\n832\n00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:20,520\nwhen they were collected, this is the way\nit was before I did any analysis on it.\n\n833\n00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,480\nSo there's no question and\nyou know at all.\n\n834\n00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,030\nI'd say it's better to, and\nthe reason I say hash the image and\n\n835\n00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,330\nthen hash the file,\nI think it's better to do both.\n\n836\n00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:34,320\nBecause you're basically\ndouble protecting yourself.\n\n837\n00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,210\nYou're showing, this is this and\nthis is this and\n\n838\n00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,430\nso there's even less\nquestion at that point.\n\n839\n00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:42,070\n>> Absolutely, and\njust from a convenience point of view,\n\n840\n00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:45,090\nif i need to verify this log file,\nI really don't wanna\n\n841\n00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,870\nhave to run a hash on the entire\nimage again just to verify that.\n\n842\n00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,826\nI can run a hash on just the log\nfile compared to my original hash.\n\n843\n00:45:51,826 --> 00:45:53,528\nA little bit quicker as well.\n\n844\n00:45:53,528 --> 00:45:56,610\nAs we gotta make sure the integrity\nis validate on these log files.\n\n845\n00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:01,000\nAnother thing we have to worry about,\nit can't have a record of failures.\n\n846\n00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,260\n>> What, come on?\n\n847\n00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,550\n>> As long as it's up at the time,\nit's good enough, right.\n\n848\n00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,170\nSo what if it's down\n30-40-50% of the time?\n\n849\n00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,990\nIt was up when it was important and\nthat's why I'm getting paid.\n\n850\n00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:11,950\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n851\n00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,115\nThat seems good enough to me.\n\n852\n00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:17,670\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nthere has to be a track record here.\n\n853\n00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:22,610\nIt goes with the same thing as for\nthe random part of it,\n\n854\n00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:27,940\nis you randomly wanna establish\na consistent pattern of failures.\n\n855\n00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:35,290\nIf there's a failure here or there,\nit's probably not that big of a deal.\n\n856\n00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:40,580\nBut if you have a record of consistent\nfailures, I guess is the way to put it.\n\n857\n00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,920\nOr chronic failures is probably\nthe better way to put it.\n\n858\n00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,720\nIf you have a record of that.\n\n859\n00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,610\nThat is gonna bring in\na question to your system.\n\n860\n00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,000\nJust period.\n\n861\n00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,020\nI'm gonna trust data from a system\nthat can't walk straight.\n\n862\n00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,180\nHow good can it be at collecting data?\n\n863\n00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,750\nWhen it can't do this.\n\n864\n00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:07,310\nSo that brings another layer to it,\nbut that should be pretty easy to do,\n\n865\n00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:11,530\nmost logging systems are really\nquite simple when you look at it.\n\n866\n00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,230\nSo they should be fairly easy for\n\n867\n00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:17,060\nyou to be double-checking,\neven before an incident, which you\n\n868\n00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:21,560\nshould be checking the stuff before\nan incident happens, not when it happens.\n\n869\n00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,960\nYou can check to make sure\nit is consistently running.\n\n870\n00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,110\nAnd we don't' have any\nmajor problems showing up.\n\n871\n00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,270\nAnd that way that record\nof failure is gone.\n\n872\n00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:33,090\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n873\n00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,730\nAnd like you said it really should\nbe something that I'm checking\n\n874\n00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:36,772\nconsistently anyway.\n\n875\n00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:39,840\nI wanna make sure my logging\nsystem is working properly.\n\n876\n00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,340\nSo I should be trouble shooting that.\n\n877\n00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,600\nAnd things happen.\n\n878\n00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,367\nWe run out of disc space and\nit can't log anymore.\n\n879\n00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:48,124\nOr that audit service doesn't start up or\n\n880\n00:47:48,124 --> 00:47:53,106\nsomebody unchecks a check mark and\nis not getting the same events anymore.\n\n881\n00:47:53,106 --> 00:47:57,899\nSo, it is gonna happen now, and again but\nas long as it's not a pattern where I can\n\n882\n00:47:57,899 --> 00:48:01,800\nsee that on average this thing\nonly logs about 50% of the time.\n\n883\n00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,902\nThat's gonna be like I can drive\na semi truck through that,\n\n884\n00:48:04,902 --> 00:48:07,170\nthe defense attorney's gonna love it.\n\n885\n00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:10,680\nSo, we've got to make sure that we can\nshow that our log system works, and it's\n\n886\n00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,100\ncapturing the majority of that information\nbecause the defense could say, well,\n\n887\n00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,580\nwhat you didn't capture, is the stuff that\ncan prove where my client's innocence is.\n\n888\n00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:20,410\nRight.\n\n889\n00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,630\nOr that somebody actually did it and\nnot my client.\n\n890\n00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,590\nSo if I don't have good logging\nsystem none of it's gonna be-\n\n891\n00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,200\n>> Even add on top of that,\n\n892\n00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,970\nif you wanna add another layer\non top of the whole thing.\n\n893\n00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:37,144\nYou can't keep your\nlogging system working and\n\n894\n00:48:37,144 --> 00:48:43,204\nkeeping track of everything,\nhow competent of an IT person are you?\n\n895\n00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:45,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you're the forensic investigator and\n\n896\n00:48:45,640

00:48:59,030\nThey ask me as a forensic guy,\nwell, how is this normal?\n\n899\n00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,790\nI might very well have to sit there and\nsay, no, that's not normal.\n\n900\n00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:07,860\nThis is an unusual situation that the\nsystem is only running 50% of the time.\n\n901\n00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:11,898\nYeah so\nnow you've got a big problem there.\n\n902\n00:49:11,898 --> 00:49:13,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I'm under oath.\n\n903\n00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:15,380\nI can't lie for you.\n\n904\n00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,770\nYou gotta tell

Franklins I can slip you.\n\n907\n00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:21,892\n>> Yeah.\n\n908\n00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:25,556\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Now gonna take a chance and\n\n909\n00:49:25,556 --> 00:49:28,160\ngo to jail, right.\n\n910\n00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:28,690\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n911\n00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:33,840\ngotta make sure that we don't\nhave a record of failures.\n\n912\n00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,770\nI want to get into some of\nthe different laws requiring logs,\n\n913\n00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,156\nbecause there are several.\n\n914\n00:49:38,156 --> 00:49:40,153\nRight.\nEspecially it seems like there are more\n\n915\n00:49:40,153 --> 00:49:41,242\ncoming out all the time.\n\n916\n00:49:41,242 --> 00:49:42,097\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n917\n00:49:42,097 --> 00:49:44,160\nwe really have to pay attention to these.\n\n918\n00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,070\nWe have to be familiar with them.\n\n919\n00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,200\nBut, we're getting close\nto our break time so\n\n920\n00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,080\nrather than split this up, why don't we\ntake our break a couple minutes early.\n\n921\n00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,270\nWhen we come back we're gonna talk about\nsome of these laws that we're gonna have\n\n922\n00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:57,710\nto deal with that have a direct\nimpact on how and what we audit.\n\n923\n00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,775\nSo stay tuned.\n\n924\n00:49:58,775 --> 00:49:59,576\nWe'll be right back.\n\n925\n00:49:59,576 --> 00:50:06,193\n[SOUND]\n>> All right,\n\n926\n00:50:06,193 --> 00:50:07,910\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n927\n00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:11,430\nSo we left off talking about\ndifferent types of logs and\n\n928\n00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:16,130\nnow we wanna take a look at some of\nthe different laws that will determine or\n\n929\n00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:19,720\ncould have a big impact on what\nI have to log, right Sean?\n\n930\n00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,830\nYes.\n\n931\n00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:25,730\nNever forget that there's going to be just\nabout in any case, there's gonna be some\n\n932\n00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:30,510\nsort of a law regulation that\ndictates what you need to be logging.\n\n933\n00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:35,360\nAnd that's talking outside of\nthe forensics investigation part.\n\n934\n00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,470\nI mean yes, a lot of the times these\nlaws are put in place in consideration\n\n935\n00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,520\nof the fact that you may have to do a\nforensic investigation at some point, but\n\n936\n00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,960\nat a lot of industries,\nit's a matter of doing business.\n\n937\n00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,750\nAnd consider the fact that if you're in\nsomething like in the healthcare industry,\n\n938\n00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,710\nfinancial industry, anything like that.\n\n939\n00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:01,910\nIf you have standards that say you have\nto log certain things and you don't, that\n\n940\n00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:05,350\nalso goes a long way towards something\nwe talked about in a previous segment.\n\n941\n00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:07,740\nThis has to be part of\na normal business process.\n\n942\n00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,670\nYou can guarantee that if you're not\ndoing a proper normal business process,\n\n943\n00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,920\nthat's problem number one.\n\n944\n00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,720\nThen what happens is, you're in court and\nthey're picking on you for that.\n\n945\n00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,690\nThen someone's gonna say well,\naren't you supposed to be logging?\n\n946\n00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:26,370\nDoesn't HIPPA mandate in your\nindustry that you do this?\n\n947\n00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:31,710\nWell, you can't sit there and\nsay, well yeah,\n\n948\n00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:35,670\nthat's about all, I guess that's about\nall you can say at that point, like,\n\n949\n00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:40,520\nyep, because there's no\nbailing out of that one.\n\n950\n00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,310\nYou didn't do it.\n\n951\n00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,200\nIt's required, guess what's coming next.\n\n952\n00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,011\n[CROSSTALK] A pink slip,\n\n953\n00:51:47,011 --> 00:51:51,904\nmaybe a law suite stepping in\ndepending what the situation was,\n\n954\n00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:57,632\nthere could be a lot of stuff just coming\ncrashing down on you at that point.\n\n955\n00:51:57,632 --> 00:51:59,660\nSo, don't forget that.\n\n956\n00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,030\nThat there is gonna be logs.\n\n957\n00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:05,370\nNow, as a forensics person,\nif you're called in as a contractor, or\n\n958\n00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,860\nas independent person to an investigation.\n\n959\n00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:14,150\nConsider the fact that if you are gonna\nregulate industry, do a little homework,\n\n960\n00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:16,250\nand figure out what\nthey should be logging.\n\n961\n00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:20,390\nThen you can ask them for that,\nand see what they should be doing.\n\n962\n00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,760\nYou can ask specifically.\n\n963\n00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,730\nI know you're supposed to have this,\nI know you're supposed to have this,\n\n964\n00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:25,160\nI know you're supposed to have this.\n\n965\n00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,319\nI'm gonna need those.\n\n966\n00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,580\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so be aware of this.\n\n967\n00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,400\n>> So if I'm working with an organization,\n\n968\n00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,300\nI've got to make sure that is part of\nmy auditing program, that I understand\n\n969\n00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:38,250\nwhat governmental or industry regulations\nare in place that we have to follow.\n\n970\n00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:42,040\nWe talked about developing an audit policy\nand making sure we're capturing enough\n\n971\n00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,360\ninformation, but not too much information,\nwe're not missing any information.\n\n972\n00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,970\nThis just adds a whole other level to it.\n\n973\n00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:51,140\nThis is stuff that the law says or some\nindustry regulation says you have to have,\n\n974\n00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,290\nso we have to make sure that\nthat's part of our plan.\n\n975\n00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:55,630\nAnd as Shawn said,\nif I'm coming into a business,\n\n976\n00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:00,540\nbeen hired to do an investigation, I know\nthey should have this, this, and this, and\n\n977\n00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:03,760\nso I now right where to look,\nor what to ask for.\n\n978\n00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,367\nAnd there are several,\nas you mentioned a couple,\n\n979\n00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:10,736\nyeah some of these I'm not familiar with,\nbut you've got the Gram Leach Bayley Act,\n\n980\n00:53:10,736 --> 00:53:14,392\nwhich I forget what that one was for,\nthat's the FDAC put that one out.\n\n981\n00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:15,624\n>> Yeah that's for finance.\n\n982\n00:53:15,624 --> 00:53:17,900\n>> That's for financial, yep.\n\n983\n00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,612\n>> Yeah, so\nyou have that if you're a know a bank.\n\n984\n00:53:22,612 --> 00:53:27,834\n[CROSSTALK] You would have that and if you\nfall under that guideline and the FDIC\n\n985\n00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:33,235\nis gonna say that you have to follow\nthe particulars of that specific standard.\n\n986\n00:53:33,235 --> 00:53:37,980\nSo that would be just one,\nif you're in that industry.\n\n987\n00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,500\nWe have others too.\n\n988\n00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,950\nHIPAA was mentioned.\n\n989\n00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,360\nThat's healthcare.\n\n990\n00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:49,530\nAnd of course, by the way, just to\nreiterate, for something from previously.\n\n991\n00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:53,070\nUS centric,\nif you're doing business in the US, and\n\n992\n00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,950\nyou're a US centric company,\nthen you're gonna have to follow this.\n\n993\n00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:59,250\nIf you're overseas,\nthere's gonna be something else.\n\n994\n00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,180\nThere's definitely gonna\nbe something else.\n\n995\n00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:06,360\nI think Kayla's the one that\nbrought up in a previous one that\n\n996\n00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,420\nthe UK probably has even\nstronger standards than us.\n\n997\n00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,140\nAnd I [LAUGH] would go along with that.\n\n998\n00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,570\nI'm not about to argue with that one.\n\n999\n00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:17,910\n>> So, I have no experience with that.\n\n1000\n00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:21,500\nBut, I'm sure, like I said, everybody's\ngot their regulations in place,\n\n1001\n00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,450\nand that's to make sure that when it comes\ndown to it that well a lot of them are put\n\n1002\n00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:28,120\nin place to make sure that the information\nis kept safe in the first place.\n\n1003\n00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,330\nAnd if something does happen,\nwe've got the ability to go back in and\n\n1004\n00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:34,030\nfigure out what happened, and\nwho did it, and things like that.\n\n1005\n00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:37,010\nSo it's really just helping\nus as an investigator.\n\n1006\n00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:41,454\nIt's insuring that we have the information\nneeded to do our investigation.\n\n1007\n00:54:41,454 --> 00:54:42,837\nRight.\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1008\n00:54:42,837 --> 00:54:49,580\n>> We've got that I think for financial\ninstitutions if I remember correctly.\n\n1009\n00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,020\n>> Financial and public and\ntraded institutions.\n\n1010\n00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:57,620\nThey have to, it's basically a truth\nin accounting type situation.\n\n1011\n00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:01,320\nIt was one that was\nenacted after Enron and\n\n1012\n00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,860\nWorld Com blew up,\nthose two both just imploded.\n\n1013\n00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,360\n>> Make sure we've got outside\npeople doing the auditing and\n\n1014\n00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,860\nnot cooking the books and getting audited\nby our own people and things like that.\n\n1015\n00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,235\nWhat else do we got, we've got the\n>> Is it Fizma?\n\n1016\n00:55:15,235 --> 00:55:17,583\n>> Yes.\n\n1017\n00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:23,923\n[CROSSTALK] I'm definitely cheating\non this ladies and gentleman.\n\n1018\n00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:27,765\n>> Federal Information\nManagement Security Act.\n\n1019\n00:55:27,765 --> 00:55:32,216\nI know what it is but I couldn't\ntell you what the acronym is, but\n\n1020\n00:55:32,216 --> 00:55:37,480\nthat's something for\nfederal agencies to follow here in the US.\n\n1021\n00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,450\nThat's another guideline.\n\n1022\n00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:43,240\nAnd the PCI DSS for\nthe payment card industry.\n\n1023\n00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,756\nThey have another set of standards.\n\n1024\n00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:47,811\nAnd this is a short list.\n\n1025\n00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:53,495\nThis is definitely a very short list\nof the alphabet soup that is out there.\n\n1026\n00:55:53,495 --> 00:55:57,775\nYou know that could cover logging, not to\nmention other stuff that we have done.\n\n1027\n00:55:57,775 --> 00:56:02,996\nThere are other things that could\nfall under the forensic process,\n\n1028\n00:56:02,996 --> 00:56:07,920\nthat could fall under these\nguidelines plus other ones.\n\n1029\n00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,000\nSo don't forget that there's going\nto be a lot of heavy regulations and\n\n1030\n00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,730\nstuff like that out there nowadays\nthat you just have to follow it.\n\n1031\n00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:20,880\nIf you don't, there's gonna be a lot\nof bad things happening to you.\n\n1032\n00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,740\n>> It very well could\nbe what we call a RGE.\n\n1033\n00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,975\nA Resume Generating Event.\n\n1034\n00:56:26,975 --> 00:56:30,690\n[LAUGH] You're the one that was supposed\nto be making sure all this was you were\n\n1035\n00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,890\nfollowing compliance turns out you're not.\n\n1036\n00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,020\nIt's going to be a bad day for you.\n\n1037\n00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,820\nSo, as an investigator then,\ndo you bring it back into our context.\n\n1038\n00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,050\nAs a digital forensics investigator,\nknowing about these,\n\n1039\n00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:45,340\nknowing that those logs should exist,\ngives me a heads up of where I can go to\n\n1040\n00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:50,196\nlook, where I can start\ngathering that information.\n\n1041\n00:56:50,196 --> 00:56:50,870\n>> Yeah.\n\n1042\n00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:53,940\nDon't forget that you\nwork on part of a team.\n\n1043\n00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,530\nAnd we'll be working with others.\n\n1044\n00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,850\nEven if there's not a forensic\ninvestigator in there,\n\n1045\n00:56:58,850 --> 00:56:59,940\nyou're gonna be working with others.\n\n1046\n00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:04,080\nAnd one of those things is a lawyer or\nlegal representation is going\n\n1047\n00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:09,210\nto be somewhere involved and\nwhat's going to happen there is\n\n1048\n00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:12,940\nthey're going to be a resource to tell\nyou to interpret some of this stuff.\n\n1049\n00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:17,060\nOn top of it it may not\nalways be as obvious\n\n1050\n00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:21,850\nwhat type of rules need to be followed or\nare being followed in a business.\n\n1051\n00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:26,840\nSo if you go in as a forensic investigator\nand not sure what should be followed and\n\n1052\n00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:31,790\nwhat should not be followed,\nthen you need to ask your legal team.\n\n1053\n00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:38,480\nBecause you may be in a company\nthat's doing HIPPA plus PCI DSF.\n\n1054\n00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,810\nThey may be processing payments, and then\ninternally be doing the healthcare stuff.\n\n1055\n00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:47,630\nSo that's two things that are gonna\ncome into are gonna come into play now.\n\n1056\n00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,330\n>> I got you.\n\n1057\n00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:49,820\nWe might not have to follow just one.\n\n1058\n00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,740\nWe might have more than one that we've\ngot to make sure we're compliant with.\n\n1059\n00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,670\n>> Yeah I pretty much guarantee you\nthat you're gonna follow more than one.\n\n1060\n00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:58,000\nThere's other ones that are not on here.\n\n1061\n00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,080\nStuff that relates to privacy and\nstuff like that.\n\n1062\n00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:06,100\nThose are also gonna necessitate,\neither some mandated level of logging,\n\n1063\n00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,115\nor just some common\nsense level of logging.\n\n1064\n00:58:09,115 --> 00:58:10,990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To, kind of, protect yourself.\n\n1065\n00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:14,470\nSo, just be prepared what we're saying.\n\n1066\n00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,330\n>> All right, so we've got all of these.\n\n1067\n00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,960\nWe've talked about the fact\nthat we need to audit,\n\n1068\n00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,950\nwe need to take a look\nat what we're auditing.\n\n1069\n00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:25,020\nAs an investigator, we need know\nwhere to look for these log files.\n\n1070\n00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,980\nWe've talked a lot about the windows logs,\nand then we covered over some of\n\n1071\n00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:34,470\nthe regulations that we might have to\nfollow, and different standards again.\n\n1072\n00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:37,320\nNot, by any means an all-inclusive list.\n\n1073\n00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,160\nAnother thing we've got to worry about\nis centralized logging and sys logs.\n\n1074\n00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,540\n>> Yes, those all fall under\nthe banner of log management.\n\n1075\n00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:49,340\nYou need to have some way of not only\nknowing who's responsible for the logs and\n\n1076\n00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,800\nmaking sure they're getting done.\n\n1077\n00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,340\nBut also have a system to\norganize those things and\n\n1078\n00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:57,080\nmake sure they all stay straightened out\nand are doing what they are supposed to.\n\n1079\n00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,500\nIf you don't have someone accountable for\nthat or\n\n1080\n00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,950\nsomeone managing it, it's gonna be chaos.\n\n1081\n00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:07,730\nBecause if someone's not assigned\naccountable, no one's gonna do it.\n\n1082\n00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:10,041\nOn top of it,\n>> There are no volunteers to go out there\n\n1083\n00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:11,083\nand read those log [CROSSTALK].\n\n1084\n00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:11,940\nI mean, come on.\n\n1085\n00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,270\n>> No one's gonna do it.\n\n1086\n00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,690\nNo one's gonna troubleshoot anything.\n\n1087\n00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:18,020\nIt's just gonna come down to what,\nit wasn't getting logged?\n\n1088\n00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,890\nAnd then that's not an answer you want\nto hear, because now you're just oh,\n\n1089\n00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:25,270\nI should have called in sick today,\nthat type of deal.\n\n1090\n00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,900\n>> And we've talked previously in\nthe episode about how in order for\n\n1091\n00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,580\nthis to be useful for\nus in an investigation.\n\n1092\n00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:36,370\nI have to show that this is part of\nmy regular business practice, and\n\n1093\n00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:39,090\nthat we're doing it regularly, and\nthat it's working properly, and\n\n1094\n00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:41,440\nit doesn't have big gaps in it,\nthings like that.\n\n1095\n00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,340\nSo, if it comes down it it we find\nout oh my gosh, we don't have this,\n\n1096\n00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:48,510\nit's too late, it's not like I can go\nback and turn it on in the past and\n\n1097\n00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:50,150\ntry to capture the information.\n\n1098\n00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:54,540\nAt that point we're scrambling just\nto try to get that admitted in, and\n\n1099\n00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:58,000\ncome up with some really good reasons why\nwe can't show that we've been logging this\n\n1100\n00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,710\nwhole time, and things like that.\n\n1101\n01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:04,440\n>> Yes, you need to make sure that\nthis is like someone's handling it,\n\n1102\n01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,480\nit's being checked,\nthe regulations are being followed.\n\n1103\n01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,490\nThe systems are doing\nwhat they're supposed to,\n\n1104\n01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:10,750\nwe've got all that straightened out.\n\n1105\n01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,340\nWe just definitely do not wanna find that\n\n1106\n01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:17,080\nout after the fact that there\nis a problem or a gap someplace,\n\n1107\n01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:21,840\nbecause then again, you've got a whole\nother set of rules to deal with.\n\n1108\n01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,610\nAnd a whole set of problems, rather,\n\n1109\n01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:28,500\nto deal with, that you don't want to have\nto deal with, you really really don't.\n\n1110\n01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,660\nAnd this, it sounds fairly\nsimple on the surface, but\n\n1111\n01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:37,070\nwhen you think about the level of things,\nthe different levels of logging,\n\n1112\n01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:40,080\nand all these little details\nin different places.\n\n1113\n01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,410\nWe talked only about a handful of\nlogs in the beginning of this.\n\n1114\n01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:45,510\nApplication logs, system logs,\nand stuff like that.\n\n1115\n01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,520\nThose all also have to be correlated too.\n\n1116\n01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,850\nYou know,\nwe haven't really talked about that yet.\n\n1117\n01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,860\nThat is the next part of it,\nof log management,\n\n1118\n01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,730\nis correlating that information.\n\n1119\n01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:56,095\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1120\n01:00:56,095 --> 01:00:58,470\nAnd we talked about centralized logging.\n\n1121\n01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,540\nWe talk about these log files.\n\n1122\n01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:03,480\nBut we're talking about every single\nserver that we have has these\n\n1123\n01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,540\nlog files on it.\n\n1124\n01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,800\nEvery router, every firewall,\nevery IDS, every client system.\n\n1125\n01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,180\nAnd I don't want to have to\nmanage these individually right.\n\n1126\n01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:13,810\nI don't want to have to go to\neach one of these machines.\n\n1127\n01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:14,780\nAnd read through these log files.\n\n1128\n01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,000\nAnd that's where some of these\ntools can come into play.\n\n1129\n01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,200\nAnd give us the ability to do that,\nthat centralized logging.\n\n1130\n01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,820\nI know Linux has the, I think they call it\nlog shipping, I can't remember for sure.\n\n1131\n01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:28,130\nThey have it to where you can have one\nmachine kind of be the central port for\n\n1132\n01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:29,530\ngathering up logs.\n\n1133\n01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:34,500\nWindows finally has their event log\nsubscription system where I can go\n\n1134\n01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,090\nto one machine and subscribe to\nthe event log from other machines, and\n\n1135\n01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,360\nkind of pull all that together.\n\n1136\n01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,560\nBut even more than that, there's several\ntools I think we're gonna talk about in\n\n1137\n01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,250\na little bit,\nthat'll make it a little bit easier.\n\n1138\n01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,328\nBut even built into\nthe operating systems now.\n\n1139\n01:01:48,328 --> 01:01:50,070\n>> I believe exchange has that too, right?\n\n1140\n01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,550\nHave had that for a few releases.\n\n1141\n01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:56,520\nSo they can do log shipping, so and that's\nactually considered to be a good practice\n\n1142\n01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:02,370\nof management is to have a system\nother than the one that's having this\n\n1143\n01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:07,740\napplication or service run on it, actually\ngather up those logs, if at all possible.\n\n1144\n01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:10,480\nThat way it gives an extra\nlayer of protection.\n\n1145\n01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,370\nSomeone compromises that system,\n\n1146\n01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:17,380\nthis other system it would be\na whole separate target for them.\n\n1147\n01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:20,590\nSo it's another safety\nmeasure that should be taken.\n\n1148\n01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:24,740\nYeah cause they might not even know what\nsystem is being that central coordinator\n\n1149\n01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:28,880\nso they try to wipe the log files off\nof that machine that they've attacked.\n\n1150\n01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,460\nThat doesn't mean that they got\nthat copy of them on that one\n\n1151\n01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,920\nwhere you're used to subscribe to or\nship to or what have you.\n\n1152\n01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,390\nSo as you said another layer and\nthat goes right into our next..\n\n1153\n01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:39,870\nPoint, which is logging systems\nreally need to be hardened.\n\n1154\n01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:43,240\nWe've got to protect those guys because\nthat's what the bad guy's gonna try to do\n\n1155\n01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,120\nis cover their tracks, right?\n\n1156\n01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,570\n>> Yes,\nlogs are a prime target to go after.\n\n1157\n01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:54,590\nAgain, to keep referring back to stuff we\ntalked about in the CEH, we specifically\n\n1158\n01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:59,050\ntalked about in our covering tracks\nportion about in doing something.\n\n1159\n01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:03,520\nDisrupt or modify those log files in\nsuch a way to call them into question or\n\n1160\n01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:09,750\njust to leave no trace and\nby doing that then it made it tougher for\n\n1161\n01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:15,070\nsomeone to do an investigation to actually\nfind out what really happened there.\n\n1162\n01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:18,600\nSo we're trying to avoid that as much as\npossible and it's gonna be a valid target\n\n1163\n01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,270\nfor any sort of attack or they're going to\ngo after it for every service possible.\n\n1164\n01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:27,470\n>> And not only securing it,\nhardening it for network based attacks but\n\n1165\n01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,760\nalso physically right?\n\n1166\n01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,050\nI mean if I can touch that machine,\nit's no longer your machine.\n\n1167\n01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:35,647\nSo if I can get access to the machine\nthat's doing that centralized logging,\n\n1168\n01:03:35,647 --> 01:03:38,596\nthen you might as well count your\nlogs as no good anymore right?\n\n1169\n01:03:38,596 --> 01:03:44,959\nYes, if there's any question whatsoever,\nthat's really as on the attacking side,\n\n1170\n01:03:44,959 --> 01:03:50,626\nthat's all I really have to do is call\ninto make your investigation be a little\n\n1171\n01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:55,966\nless successful and cause you more work or\ncause the case to fail period.\n\n1172\n01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:59,365\nIs just introduced a little\nbit of doubt into your mind.\n\n1173\n01:03:59,365 --> 01:04:04,560\nOnce I've done that, then what\nelse might there be doubts about?\n\n1174\n01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,310\nWhere else can you find this?\n\n1175\n01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:10,400\nMaybe that other stuff is indirect\nevidence, and it's circumstantial.\n\n1176\n01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:15,800\nWithout that one piece and\nthat one piece is not considered reliable.\n\n1177\n01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:19,760\nSo if I can introduce that,\nas an attacker under your head or\n\n1178\n01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,220\nas a forensic investigator and\nintroduce that into your head.\n\n1179\n01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:28,090\nI can cause you a little bit of grief and\na little bit of confusion there.\n\n1180\n01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:28,730\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1181\n01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:29,990\nAbsolutely.\n\n1182\n01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:32,480\nSo Shawn, we mentioned a term,\ncorrelation,\n\n1183\n01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,050\nwhich I think we're gonna get\nto here in just a second.\n\n1184\n01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:36,190\nBefore we go into that though,\n\n1185\n01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:39,440\nwe need to understand a little\nbit about time synchronization.\n\n1186\n01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,860\nBecause that's really what's gonna\nallow us to do that correlation.\n\n1187\n01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:46,590\nWe've talked about gathering these events,\nbut if we gather these events and\n\n1188\n01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,680\nwe can't tie them together.\n\n1189\n01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:53,230\nAnd, what I mean by that is, looking at\nthe events on two or more systems and\n\n1190\n01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:57,940\ntrying to see what happened at a\nparticular time, across multiple systems.\n\n1191\n01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:00,974\nThe only way that's possible is if\nthey all agree on what time it is.\n\n1192\n01:05:01,995 --> 01:05:06,525\n>> Yes, that is absolutely\nthe core of the whole thing.\n\n1193\n01:05:06,525 --> 01:05:07,935\nWhen you're coordinating logs,\n\n1194\n01:05:07,935 --> 01:05:12,065\nthey all have to show something here was\nlogged over here at such a time, and\n\n1195\n01:05:12,065 --> 01:05:16,455\nsuch a time over here, and\nI can cross reference and see that yes,\n\n1196\n01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:21,110\nindeed, they did happen across all\nof these systems at the same time.\n\n1197\n01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:24,740\nWith very little or\nno variance whatsoever.\n\n1198\n01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:29,140\nAnd that goes a long way towards showing,\nyeah, this event did happen.\n\n1199\n01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:33,090\nI mean, I can't say this happened at this\ntime and this happened at the same time,\n\n1200\n01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,670\nbut don't worry about the clock\nif it says 15 minutes later.\n\n1201\n01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,720\nJust ignore that little detail.\n\n1202\n01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,970\nThe devil's in the details here and\nhe'll get you.\n\n1203\n01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:40,480\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1204\n01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,000\nAbsolutely.\n\n1205\n01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,350\nYou're looking at that log file and\nyou can see that the, maybe the router was\n\n1206\n01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:49,190\nbreached at a certain time, and then the\nfile server was accessed 30 minutes later.\n\n1207\n01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:50,230\nWell, wait a second.\n\n1208\n01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:50,870\nWhy is this?\n\n1209\n01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:53,210\nShouldn't that happen at the same time?\n\n1210\n01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:55,590\nSo you've gotta be synchronized.\n\n1211\n01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:59,820\nAnd we've got our network time protocol,\nwhich is designed to do just that.\n\n1212\n01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:03,720\nAnd almost all of our operating systems\nuse that same network protocol.\n\n1213\n01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,650\nIt's just a, a protocol that we can use\nto synchronize time across these devices.\n\n1214\n01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:11,750\nAnd we can choose to sync it up in\na couple of different ways, right?\n\n1215\n01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:12,710\n>> Yeah, you can sync it up.\n\n1216\n01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:15,930\nNTP tends to be one of the preferred\nways because you can point them all to\n\n1217\n01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:19,860\na central time server on that network.\n\n1218\n01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:23,370\nOr you could point to\nthe atomic clock some place.\n\n1219\n01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:26,080\nWhat we're really trying to establish\nis something that everyone's on\n\n1220\n01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:26,610\nthe same page.\n\n1221\n01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:30,570\nEveryone synchronize their watches to\nborrow that phrase, to make sure that\n\n1222\n01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:35,070\nwhen they've all synchronized, that the\nevents all turn up with the same date and\n\n1223\n01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:40,010\ntime or very, very close to\nthat across all these systems.\n\n1224\n01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:42,300\nI really need to accomplish that.\n\n1225\n01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,440\nToo much variance and we've got a problem.\n\n1226\n01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:49,870\nSo, what it comes down to is, it doesn't\nreally matter what time system you use,\n\n1227\n01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:51,940\njust as long as we're\nall on the same page.\n\n1228\n01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:56,430\nWe don't want to have these\nhuge mismatches because\n\n1229\n01:06:56,430 --> 01:07:00,790\nit doesn't look good and we- If you try\nto go into court and say, well, heck or\n\n1230\n01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:05,300\ngo into a situation trying to vouch for\nthat evidence as an expert witness and\n\n1231\n01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,330\nthey say,\nwhy isn't this all on the same page here?\n\n1232\n01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:12,570\nWell, now you got go through a whole\nbunch of things on that, and\n\n1233\n01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:16,490\nit's not pretty and\nit looks unprofessional too.\n\n1234\n01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:20,620\n>> Absolutely, and if we're going to\ncorrelate events across multiple systems,\n\n1235\n01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,490\nthen we want to keep\nthat time synchronized.\n\n1236\n01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:25,030\nIn our Windows environments,\nwe've got that PDC emulator.\n\n1237\n01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:29,550\nThat's one of those FSMOs, or those\nFlexible Single Master Operation Roles.\n\n1238\n01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:33,390\nAnd we point all our machines to that,\nit's done by default within a domain.\n\n1239\n01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:35,780\nAnd it's kinda funny when you talk\nabout synchronizing time, and\n\n1240\n01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:40,410\nreally if everything is local then it\ndoesn't even matter if the time is wrong\n\n1241\n01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:43,340\nas long as everybody's on\nthe exact same time, right?\n\n1242\n01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:45,290\nYou think about the old\nmovies with the SWAT teams.\n\n1243\n01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:46,950\nOne person looks at their watch.\n\n1244\n01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:51,250\nAnd they say, all right, it is gonna\nbe 10:10 in three, two, one, mark.\n\n1245\n01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:55,470\nWhether his time is correct or not,\nas long as everybody's on the same time.\n\n1246\n01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:57,770\nThen they're all gonna go through\nthe doors at the same time.\n\n1247\n01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:00,840\nNow where that counts as a problem though\nis when we start reaching outside of our\n\n1248\n01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:05,860\nnetwork and pulling log files from\ncloud services and from ISP's.\n\n1249\n01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:09,850\nIf our time is not synchronized with\ntheir time, that could cause a problem.\n\n1250\n01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:12,650\nAnd it's not like we're gonna synchronize\nour time directly with them, but\n\n1251\n01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:14,250\nwe're all using the same,.\n\n1252\n01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:18,560\nThe atomic clock or time.microsoft.com or\nsomething like that.\n\n1253\n01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,300\nWe can maintain that synchronization,\n\n1254\n01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,090\nclose enough anyway to where we're gonna\nbe able to use it in a court of law.\n\n1255\n01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,950\n>> Yeah and you'd better show a reason for\n\n1256\n01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:27,890\nit if you're talking about an ISP's\nbeing different than yours.\n\n1257\n01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:31,800\nWhy is all you stuff on the same page and\ntheir stuff on a whole different page?\n\n1258\n01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,040\nWhy is that?\n\n1259\n01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:38,900\nNow, if it came down to it, then you can\nprobably discuss it over the ISP and\n\n1260\n01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:42,840\nstuff to backup what the variances and\nverify that.\n\n1261\n01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,590\nAnd then you're probably\non a stronger standing.\n\n1262\n01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:50,500\nBut just saying this is this time over\nhere and that's that time over there.\n\n1263\n01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,720\nI mean any questions isn't good enough.\n\n1264\n01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,490\nWe had to be very meticulous in that,\nsaying why is it different, so\n\n1265\n01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:57,440\nthere's no hole there.\n\n1266\n01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,230\n>> Yeah and you see this.\n\n1267\n01:08:58,230 --> 01:09:01,090\nI've seen it in several Windows\nnetworks where it's kind of just\n\n1268\n01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:04,710\nassumed that everything is gonna be\nsynchronized cuz it does within my domain.\n\n1269\n01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:07,010\nRemember that forest root\nin a Windows environment,\n\n1270\n01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:10,760\nI've gotta set that PDC emulator to\nsynchronize with something outside,\n\n1271\n01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,720\notherwise my entire force can be\nsynchronized, but not with the rest\n\n1272\n01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:18,110\nof the world, and then that's when we have\na problem taking this evidence into court.\n\n1273\n01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:19,320\n>> Right, different time zones too.\n\n1274\n01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:23,670\n>> Yes, absolutely, and I know we mention\nhere, UTC time, we talk about that.\n\n1275\n01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:25,734\nCoordinated universal\ntime that we have now.\n\n1276\n01:09:25,734 --> 01:09:28,920\n>> Yeah\n>> I'm old enough to remember the GMT\n\n1277\n01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,950\nthings like that.\n\n1278\n01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,750\nWe don't use that anymore.\n\n1279\n01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:36,750\n>> It's very selected\nspots where it uses that.\n\n1280\n01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,920\nIt's not a every day occurrence.\n\n1281\n01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,380\nYou see some places where they use GMT or\nZulu time and something like that and\n\n1282\n01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:49,820\nother places wont use it, I know\n\n1283\n01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:55,498\nstuff like pilots, they'll use that, but\nthat's very specific for their purpose.\n\n1284\n01:09:55,498 --> 01:09:58,410\nIf you wanna use GMT time or\nsome coordinated time,\n\n1285\n01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:03,170\nmight actually be useful if you're\ngoing across multiple time zones, so\n\n1286\n01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:05,290\njust keep that in the back of your head.\n\n1287\n01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:07,650\nYou just want to make sure that\nyou want to accomplish that goal,\n\n1288\n01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:10,620\nhave them all synchronized, if someone\nlooks at some different time zones and\n\n1289\n01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,210\nsays well, why is that time over here and\n\n1290\n01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:14,880\nover here, well they probably can\ntell us different time zones.\n\n1291\n01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,480\nMake sure you're aware of it.\n\n1292\n01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,110\nThere's all these little things with\ntime zones that kind of come out and\n\n1293\n01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,680\nbite you too.\n\n1294\n01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,770\nI got caught in the half hour.\n\n1295\n01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:23,790\nDid you know that there are two time zones\nin the world that are a half hour off?\n\n1296\n01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:24,770\nThere's two places.\n\n1297\n01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:26,230\n>> Yeah,\nthere's some weird ones like that, and\n\n1298\n01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:30,220\nI think somebody in the chat-room\nmentioned, consider spring forward and\n\n1299\n01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:35,260\nfall back because some people do daylight\nsavings time, some places don't.\n\n1300\n01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:38,020\nIt can be a real pain in the butt\nsometimes to keep it all straight.\n\n1301\n01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,600\n>> Yeah just keep it straight.\n\n1302\n01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,556\nNot much really else to say about that.\n\n1303\n01:10:43,556 --> 01:10:45,005\nKeep it straight.\n\n1304\n01:10:45,005 --> 01:10:47,760\n>> And then you know I've set\nup enough computers where\n\n1305\n01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,390\nyou just start learning certain ones.\n\n1306\n01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,305\nLike I know the east coast is.\n\n1307\n01:10:51,305 --> 01:10:56,140\nUTC minus five or what have you but\nthat way we can correlate,\n\n1308\n01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:59,450\nwhat if we have to correlate log files\nacross time zones, like you say.\n\n1309\n01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:02,880\nSome of my offices are here in the US I've\ngot other offices over there in Europe or\n\n1310\n01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,180\nAsia or something I've got to be\nable to correlate those clocks or\n\n1311\n01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,800\ncorrelate those log files and those events\nacross all these different time zones.\n\n1312\n01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,150\nSo it is important we understand,\nthe way that works.\n\n1313\n01:11:13,232 --> 01:11:15,390\nAll right, I'll tell you what,\nladies and gentlemen it's time for\n\n1314\n01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:16,410\nus to take a quick break.\n\n1315\n01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:19,440\nSo we're gonna step away, we come back\nwe're gonna take a look at some of these\n\n1316\n01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,260\ntools that can take everything\nwe've been talking about, and\n\n1317\n01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,730\nmake it a whole lot easier.\n\n1318\n01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:27,327\nStay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1319\n01:11:27,327 --> 01:11:34,500\n[NOISE] All right welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n1320\n01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:38,178\nSo continuing on with our log and\nevent correlation,\n\n1321\n01:11:38,178 --> 01:11:40,560\nlet's talk about that actually.\n\n1322\n01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,839\nWe've talked about logs and\ngathering logs and\n\n1323\n01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:48,330\nmaking sure that we're enabling logging,\nwhat to get, what not to get.\n\n1324\n01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:50,760\nOr not to over-log, not to under-log.\n\n1325\n01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,821\nWe talked about, what else?\n\n1326\n01:11:54,821 --> 01:11:59,092\nSome of the different regulations that\nmight determine what levels of logging I\n\n1327\n01:11:59,092 --> 01:12:00,758\nhave to do in certain systems.\n\n1328\n01:12:00,758 --> 01:12:03,724\nAnd we've mentioned the term event\ncorrelation a couple of times, but\n\n1329\n01:12:03,724 --> 01:12:05,660\nhaven't really talked about that is, Sean.\n\n1330\n01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:09,120\nSo let's explain to them what\nyou mean by event correlation.\n\n1331\n01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,250\n>> Yeah,\nevent correlation is that you have,\n\n1332\n01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:16,850\npresumably at this point if you're\njust kind of going through this,\n\n1333\n01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:21,600\nwe see that we have a lot of potential\nplaces that we can be gathering logs from.\n\n1334\n01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:27,980\nAnd just one log as we said is a lot\nof information to have to process.\n\n1335\n01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,210\nThen all of a sudden you say okay that's,\n\n1336\n01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:32,070\nI have one log that's\na lot of information.\n\n1337\n01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:36,110\nThen two, then three, and now all of\na sudden you're just up to your eyeballs\n\n1338\n01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:38,870\nin bits and bytes and everything else.\n\n1339\n01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:43,170\nThat's a big, really big,\nmess that you've gotta sort through.\n\n1340\n01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:48,160\nSo we gotta figure out a way that we\ncan sort through it easily and tie one\n\n1341\n01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:53,930\nevent to another, to another, to another,\nto another, across all these data sources.\n\n1342\n01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:54,910\nThat's the trick.\n\n1343\n01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:58,560\nWe've already given you part\nof that with the time part.\n\n1344\n01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,110\nThe time is gonna allow you to\nsynchronize those things in such a way.\n\n1345\n01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:07,490\nThat you can see the different times\nbeing uniform across all these things,\n\n1346\n01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:10,120\nbut you're going to have to\nfind other ways of doing that.\n\n1347\n01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:14,040\nSo when you're setting up logging, you're\nalso going to need to think about ways\n\n1348\n01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:18,080\nthat if it came down to it, how can I\ntrack something from log to log to log?\n\n1349\n01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:22,310\nAm I going to use IP address,\nuser names, in addition to time?\n\n1350\n01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:24,130\nHow are you gonna do that?\n\n1351\n01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:28,450\n>> Yeah, when we look at being\na digital forensic investigator, it's\n\n1352\n01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:33,730\nseldom probably that our investigation\nis gonna be tied to a single machine.\n\n1353\n01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:34,740\nWith today's world,\n\n1354\n01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:38,060\nthe way that everything is networked\ntogether, there's a good chance that\n\n1355\n01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:41,780\nthrough my investigation I'm gonna be\nlooking at several different systems.\n\n1356\n01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:46,770\nMaybe the one that the perpetrator\nwas sitting at, plus a file server\n\n1357\n01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:49,820\nthat he might have been accessing,\nor she might have been accessing.\n\n1358\n01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:51,450\nA router where they might\nhave been passing or\n\n1359\n01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,760\nwhere that traffic was going through,\nISPs,\n\n1360\n01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,310\nthere are log files from all these\ndifferent systems, so it's not just one.\n\n1361\n01:13:57,310 --> 01:13:59,600\nI need to be able to look at those\nlog files side-by-side and say,\n\n1362\n01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:04,810\nlook, when this happened on system A,\nI can see that this happened on system B.\n\n1363\n01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:08,690\nAnd because clocks\nare synchronized within reason\n\n1364\n01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:11,330\nI can start to tie those events together.\n\n1365\n01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:14,030\nAnd that's what helps me\ndraw that big picture and\n\n1366\n01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:17,198\nnot have that pigeonhole\nview of just one system.\n\n1367\n01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:19,760\n>> Yeah, you need to be able to, I mean,\n\n1368\n01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,140\nyes you may end up\nlooking at just one log.\n\n1369\n01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,310\nBut you need to be able to\ncoordinate crossed-evolve.\n\n1370\n01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:27,790\nIf you're talking something like\na network strike where someone\n\n1371\n01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:30,590\nhas carried out an attack\nover the network,\n\n1372\n01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:34,350\nnow you're going to have to figure out\na way they carry over the network.\n\n1373\n01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:37,750\nHow can I prove that they moved from this\ndevice to this device to this device\n\n1374\n01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:41,540\nto this system, and then you can see\nwhat they changed on that system.\n\n1375\n01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,940\nThat's gonna require,\nlike you said, firewall logs,\n\n1376\n01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:49,880\nrouter logs, IDS logs could be in there\non both the network and the host.\n\n1377\n01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:53,130\nThen you've got system logs and\nsecurity logs, all those things.\n\n1378\n01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:55,480\nAnd you need to find the common thread or\n\n1379\n01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,830\nthe common thing moving\nthrough all of them.\n\n1380\n01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:00,370\nAnd so that’s your correlation.\n\n1381\n01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,280\nRight there.\n\n1382\n01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,530\n>> And this is where the tools\nreally make our lives a whole lot\n\n1383\n01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:08,740\neasier because you can imagine\nthat can be a very manual process.\n\n1384\n01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:13,180\nSitting there and comparing logs from\neven on a single system as you said\n\n1385\n01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,590\nmultiple log files on that one system and\nthen.\n\n1386\n01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:19,910\nWe bring in multiple systems and we got\nmultiple log files from multiply systems\n\n1387\n01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:22,900\nand trying to draw that line across there.\n\n1388\n01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:23,770\nThat's tedious.\n\n1389\n01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:25,990\nIf I'm doing that by hand?\n\n1390\n01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:27,760\nNo fun at all, right.\n\n1391\n01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,340\nBut thankfully we have a lot of\ndifferent tools that are out there,\n\n1392\n01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,010\nsome of which we've already\ndiscussed in previous episodes,\n\n1393\n01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:37,730\nthat are going to make this a little\nbit easier, make my life easier.\n\n1394\n01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:40,270\nAnd not to mention making it,\nI think, more efficient\n\n1395\n01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:44,450\nas well as generate some really nice\nreports in some of these tools as well.\n\n1396\n01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:45,720\n>> Yes.\n\n1397\n01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,060\nThat's the key thing is not only\nbe able to correlate it but\n\n1398\n01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,470\nalso make it look nice too.\n\n1399\n01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:53,900\nYou can say okay well after\nyou've gone through this,\n\n1400\n01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,070\nheck let someone else do it too.\n\n1401\n01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:58,200\nWhy not let them enjoy the fun?\n\n1402\n01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:58,730\nYeah.\n\n1403\n01:15:58,730 --> 01:15:59,540\nYou can't do that.\n\n1404\n01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:02,860\nSo a lot of these tools not only speed\nup the process of correlating but\n\n1405\n01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:04,770\nthey will also pretty it up for you too.\n\n1406\n01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:08,310\nSo it makes it easier to understand, which\nis only going to help you in the long run.\n\n1407\n01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,400\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1408\n01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,370\nAnd I'll throw some links out here as\nwe mention a few of these products.\n\n1409\n01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:15,950\nSome of these links are not too pretty, so\n\n1410\n01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:20,780\njust FYI, I've tried to find a couple\nthat actually had some free downloads, or\n\n1411\n01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:23,720\nsome trials,\nwhich makes the links look really ugly.\n\n1412\n01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:28,190\nI promise I'm not sending you to my\nbad server or anything like that.\n\n1413\n01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:30,640\nThere's no phishing going on here.\n\n1414\n01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,520\nBut the first one that jumps into mind\nis one that we've mentioned several\n\n1415\n01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,010\ntimes already in this show as well,\nand I think in our CEH show,\n\n1416\n01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:41,720\nis that the log parser by,\nwhat was it, Lizard Labs, I think?\n\n1417\n01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:42,640\n>> Yes.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1418\n01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,090\n>> Yes.\nThat's one that we were showing in the,\n\n1419\n01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:48,070\na couple episodes ago, and\nyes, we've shown it before.\n\n1420\n01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,920\nIt allows you not to just to\nlook at the logs in a system\n\n1421\n01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,570\nas well as some of the other\nones we've talked about.\n\n1422\n01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:53,730\nThat's the really nice thing.\n\n1423\n01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:57,230\nThis thing can do some of\nthe correlation for you.\n\n1424\n01:16:57,230 --> 01:17:02,360\nBecause you can write SQL statements\nin there that will query not only\n\n1425\n01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:07,710\nthe Windows event logs but it will also\nquery the IAS logs and other areas.\n\n1426\n01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:11,200\nAnd you can say it from a certain date\nrange and put all those things in there\n\n1427\n01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:15,350\nand it will pull up all those\nthings from those specific areas.\n\n1428\n01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:17,960\nSo it can definitely help you out with\nsome of these things that we need\n\n1429\n01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,600\nto do and do it really quick.\n\n1430\n01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,065\nGranted you may have to know SQL.\n\n1431\n01:17:21,065 --> 01:17:23,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's not an easy thing.\n\n1432\n01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:26,310\n>> It means you've gotta\nlearn Transact-SQL,\n\n1433\n01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:28,985\nI mean that's like my favorite\nsecond language, so [LAUGH].\n\n1434\n01:17:28,985 --> 01:17:31,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But yeah, the power that you can get\n\n1435\n01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:35,777\nfrom that, from being able to write\nyour own queries in there, fantastic,\n\n1436\n01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:37,110\nlove that.\n\n1437\n01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:41,320\nAnother one, this is one of those ugly,\nlong links, I promise it's safe.\n\n1438\n01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,420\n>> Yuck.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1439\n01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:44,510\nGFI makes several products.\n\n1440\n01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:48,490\nI think GFI land guard as just\none that jumps out at me,\n\n1441\n01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:51,850\nbut they also make an event log system,\nright?\n\n1442\n01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:52,940\n>> Yeah, same type of thing.\n\n1443\n01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,910\nIt's just another way of presenting it.\n\n1444\n01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:56,490\nI think that one you gotta pay for though.\n\n1445\n01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:57,710\nOr is there a trial version of it.\n\n1446\n01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:02,090\n>> I think there might have been a trial,\nwhich is why that link was so ugly.\n\n1447\n01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,414\nNow that is a mess right there.\n\n1448\n01:18:04,414 --> 01:18:05,640\n>> [LAUGH] I think, so we'll see.\n\n1449\n01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:10,270\nYeah, so GFI makes one, what are some of\nthe other ones you mention there, Sean?\n\n1450\n01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:12,460\n>> There's one, ACTIVE works has one,\n\n1451\n01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:17,380\nwhich they have a few handful of products\nout there that does this sort of thing.\n\n1452\n01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:18,930\nThat can kinda sort through.\n\n1453\n01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:21,030\nIt's just another way of\npresenting the information.\n\n1454\n01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,680\nAnd you're gonna find that, too.\n\n1455\n01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,410\nThat a lot of the tools\nthat we're mentioning here\n\n1456\n01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:29,420\nit's just a variation of a theme,\nit's to give you options.\n\n1457\n01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:33,190\nYes, some of them have options that\nare different and don't exist feature-wise\n\n1458\n01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:38,190\nin other products, but explore them and\nsee which ones you really like.\n\n1459\n01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:42,120\nHeck, you could go really,\nreally simple and dirty, and\n\n1460\n01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:46,000\nuse the stuff in WSCC, and those things\nwill just puke up the event log.\n\n1461\n01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,610\nYou go ahead and hit it and say.\n\n1462\n01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:49,820\nThrow it to a file, that's what we'll do.\n\n1463\n01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:54,590\nWe'll just go ahead and\nthrow that stuff to a file, and that's it.\n\n1464\n01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:57,170\n>> Maybe you wanna dump it\ninto an actual SQL database,\n\n1465\n01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:59,360\nand write your own queries that way.\n\n1466\n01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,940\nWe lose that pretty management\ninterface that we get\n\n1467\n01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:06,070\nwith like the Lizard Labs product and\nsome of these others that we have.\n\n1468\n01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:08,260\nBut yeah, keep it free, simple.\n\n1469\n01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,210\nMaybe that's the way you wanna go.\n\n1470\n01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:12,350\nAnother one I think solar winds of course.\n\n1471\n01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:15,610\nAs several really cool tools.\n\n1472\n01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:18,437\nThey have an event log\nmanagement system as well.\n\n1473\n01:19:18,437 --> 01:19:21,900\n>> Yes, they have one that's\npretty good; I believe that one\n\n1474\n01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:24,180\nyou can get a trial version, too.\n\n1475\n01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:27,240\nIf you like it,\nyou can get the full version of it.\n\n1476\n01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:30,690\nSo again,\nanother way of presenting information,\n\n1477\n01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:36,410\nwhen one's like a SIS log server,\nKiwi, there's a lot of them out there.\n\n1478\n01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:39,410\nI've even seen some of\n\n1479\n01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:43,350\nour people in chatrooms suggest some\nof the different systems out there.\n\n1480\n01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:46,740\nI mean, you just choose the one that\nyou think is going to get the job\n\n1481\n01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:47,900\ndone for you.\n\n1482\n01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:54,020\nAnd get the logs of all these different\nplaces as quickly and easily as possible.\n\n1483\n01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:54,581\n>> Exactly.\n\n1484\n01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:58,254\nAnd guys and girls, I'm just dumping\na whole bunch of links out there,\n\n1485\n01:19:58,254 --> 01:20:00,838\njust throwing link after\nlink after link for you.\n\n1486\n01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:04,849\nBecause in the end, they're pretty much\nall I don't wanna say the same, but\n\n1487\n01:20:04,849 --> 01:20:07,331\nthere's a lot of\ncommonalities between them.\n\n1488\n01:20:07,331 --> 01:20:10,360\nSo as you said, Sean, try them all.\n\n1489\n01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,090\nSome of them have free trials,\nsome of them are free,\n\n1490\n01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:16,210\nsome of them have some kinda time\nlimit trial or something like that.\n\n1491\n01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:18,000\nTry them.\nSee which one works best for\n\n1492\n01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,340\nyou or which one you like the best.\n\n1493\n01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,970\nAnd then maybe that's the one you\nwanna stick with or recommend for\n\n1494\n01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:27,610\nyour organization or use in your\ncompany if you're starting up your own\n\n1495\n01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:29,750\nforensic investigation team,\nor what have you.\n\n1496\n01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,760\nBut you need one, that's the thing.\n\n1497\n01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,640\nMaybe you need more than one.\n\n1498\n01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,534\nMaybe you'll find one that\nruns on one platform, and\n\n1499\n01:20:35,534 --> 01:20:38,314\nthen there's others that\nrun on Linux platforms.\n\n1500\n01:20:38,314 --> 01:20:40,666\nI don't think any of my\nlinks there were for Linux,\n\n1501\n01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:45,129\nso we've gotta worry about that as well-\n>> Couple of them do run cross-platform\n\n1502\n01:20:45,129 --> 01:20:48,630\nbut you'll have to pick\nthrough to find those ones.\n\n1503\n01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:54,330\nOr like we're saying, there's stuff you\ncan get from the Linux repositories.\n\n1504\n01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:57,650\nYou can go ahead and\npull them down and try those out too.\n\n1505\n01:20:57,650 --> 01:20:59,200\nOr you can write a script.\n\n1506\n01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:02,110\nThe benefit of the one's we're talking\nabout here for the Windows side at least\n\n1507\n01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:06,710\nand the ones that can be used on the Linux\nside is there proven trusted technologies\n\n1508\n01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:11,040\nto go back to a theme we had\nin one of our prior episodes.\n\n1509\n01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:15,890\nThey're trusted known technologies so\nthey're easier to get those\n\n1510\n01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:21,240\nthings accepted by everyone as being\na tool that will get the job done.\n\n1511\n01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,214\n>> Right, yeah if I have to go I\nremember we talked about that.\n\n1512\n01:21:23,214 --> 01:21:27,158\nIf I have to go into a court of law\nespecially I have got to make sure that\n\n1513\n01:21:27,158 --> 01:21:29,950\nthe tool I am using is\naccepted in courts of laws.\n\n1514\n01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,022\nThat it has been tested.\n\n1515\n01:21:32,022 --> 01:21:36,270\nThat it has been proven to the court\nsystem that it's accurate and reliable.\n\n1516\n01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:40,400\nIf I just go and download some cracked\nversion of some software somewhere and\n\n1517\n01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,170\nthen try to take that into the court room.\n\n1518\n01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:43,940\nI am going to get laughed out of court.\n\n1519\n01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,790\nHeck, I might even get in trouble for\n\n1520\n01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:47,800\nshowing them that I had\na cracked copy of it.\n\n1521\n01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,610\nI don't know.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1522\n01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:50,350\n>> So you definitely want to use.\n\n1523\n01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:51,750\nAnd some of these are suites, right?\n\n1524\n01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:56,550\nLike GFI makes several products,\nSolarWinds makes several products.\n\n1525\n01:21:56,550 --> 01:22:00,030\nSo it might be a case where your\norganization already has licensing\n\n1526\n01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:00,910\nwith SolarWinds.\n\n1527\n01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:02,340\nAnd this is something that you can add on.\n\n1528\n01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:05,490\nMaybe you didn't know they had\nan event log management system.\n\n1529\n01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:08,450\nSo maybe that's why you choose one or\nother, is because you're already familiar\n\n1530\n01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:10,220\nwith some of their products,\nand they tie together.\n\n1531\n01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:14,281\nI know like SolarWinds is really good\nusually about tying all their consoles\n\n1532\n01:22:14,281 --> 01:22:14,924\ntogether.\n\n1533\n01:22:14,924 --> 01:22:20,333\nSo if I want that one management interface\nto deal with all these different systems,\n\n1534\n01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:22,400\nmaybe that's the way I go, so.\n\n1535\n01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,580\n>> And Microsoft's got some of the stuff\nin their products too, outside of\n\n1536\n01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:30,070\nthe Windows server, they have the\noperations manager and stuff like that.\n\n1537\n01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:34,323\nThat could also do this and\nthey'd be accepted as well too.\n\n1538\n01:22:34,323 --> 01:22:37,120\nIt's Microsoft technology,\neveryone knows it.\n\n1539\n01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,190\nPresumably there's some level\nof trust there, we hope.\n\n1540\n01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:42,490\nWe've got that.\n\n1541\n01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:46,980\nMight run into a judge whose an Apple\nuser or Linux user or something else.\n\n1542\n01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:51,885\nWho knows, but\npresumably there is some weight behind\n\n1543\n01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:56,330\nthat; that something from that vendor,\nMicrosoft in this case,\n\n1544\n01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:59,659\nwill assume that that would be trusted,\nand the information is there.\n\n1545\n01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:02,850\nMicrosoft tends to hide it a little bit.\n\n1546\n01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:04,400\nAlthough I'll give them credit.\n\n1547\n01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:08,220\nAll I can say is the new event\nlog system is so much better.\n\n1548\n01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:11,140\nThey did, they got hammered for awhile for\nnot giving us this information.\n\n1549\n01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:12,930\nWe had three log files, right?\n\n1550\n01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:15,190\nThe application log,\nthe system log, the security log.\n\n1551\n01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,400\nThat's all we had.\n\n1552\n01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:20,000\nAnd now we've got dozens and dozens of\nlog files, all the operational logs,\n\n1553\n01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,700\nso they've done a good job to that extent.\n\n1554\n01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,590\n>> They've gone from one\nextreme to the other.\n\n1555\n01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:24,340\n>> They really did.\n\n1556\n01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,630\n>> It's like you want logging,\nwe'll log everything.\n\n1557\n01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:27,683\n>> There you go.\n\n1558\n01:23:27,683 --> 01:23:29,762\n>> It's just we'll give\nall that stuff to you.\n\n1559\n01:23:29,762 --> 01:23:33,108\n[LAUGH] Which it's great for\nus, for what we do.\n\n1560\n01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:38,362\nYou've got a lot of those logs just by\ndefault, or all those logs by default.\n\n1561\n01:23:38,362 --> 01:23:43,110\nIf there's something happening that\nthey need to log, they'll log it.\n\n1562\n01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:47,020\nSo you don't have to invest really\nany time, except the security log.\n\n1563\n01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:51,310\nFor the most part, they'll all log stuff\njust as more a matter of due course.\n\n1564\n01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:53,590\nYou just have to ask for the information.\n\n1565\n01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:56,450\nSo that's a really, really good thing.\n\n1566\n01:23:56,450 --> 01:24:00,230\nYeah, so, it came down to it,\npart of normal business practices.\n\n1567\n01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:03,660\nWell, it's part of the practice\nof that system by default,\n\n1568\n01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:07,490\nit captured it, so\nthere wasn't any randomness about this.\n\n1569\n01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:10,439\n>> Yeah, and\nI've mentioned a couple of times, too,\n\n1570\n01:24:10,439 --> 01:24:14,607\nMicrosoft has their subscriptions now\nthat you can set up for event logs.\n\n1571\n01:24:14,607 --> 01:24:17,860\nSo that's a way to do this\nevent correlation as well and\n\n1572\n01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,710\ncentralized log management.\n\n1573\n01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:23,480\nEven if I don't have a specific product,\nI can go to my desktop and\n\n1574\n01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,660\nI can create a subscription to\nall of my servers log files.\n\n1575\n01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,990\nAnd set my own filter and\nkinda start correlating them that way.\n\n1576\n01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:33,730\nOr not correlating, but\ncondensing or consolidating them.\n\n1577\n01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:36,300\nI should say.\nAnd being able to manage it from one place\n\n1578\n01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:39,040\nand not have to go from\nsystem to system to system.\n\n1579\n01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,130\nAnd accessing those log files.\n\n1580\n01:24:41,972 --> 01:24:44,030\nAll right Sean,\nwell a lot of good information there.\n\n1581\n01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:46,030\nI know that was a little bit\nshorter of a segment, but\n\n1582\n01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:48,110\nwe talked about event correlation.\n\n1583\n01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:51,930\nBeing able to tie these events\ntogether when I'm looking at log files\n\n1584\n01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:53,490\nfrom separate systems.\n\n1585\n01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:57,276\nI need to be able to show some\nkinda relationship between them.\n\n1586\n01:24:57,276 --> 01:25:01,677\nAs you said follow that path through those\nlog files as that attack went from one\n\n1587\n01:25:01,677 --> 01:25:05,680\nsystem to another as it access\nresources on different systems.\n\n1588\n01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,010\nI need to tie those together.\n\n1589\n01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:09,450\nAnd that came back to\ntime synchronization, and\n\n1590\n01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:12,070\nmaking sure that all my\nmachines are on the same page.\n\n1591\n01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:17,750\nAnd even outside my organization,\nmaking sure at some point\n\n1592\n01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:21,160\nthat my network is synchronized\nwith the rest of the world.\n\n1593\n01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,340\nAgain, not gonna be down to the second,\nbut\n\n1594\n01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:26,380\nif we're all using one of\nthose public time sources.\n\n1595\n01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:31,062\nLike the atomic clock, or\nsomething like that, some military clock,\n\n1596\n01:25:31,062 --> 01:25:36,149\nwe can be confident that our clocks are\nclose enough to the rest of the system.\n\n1597\n01:25:36,149 --> 01:25:38,562\nSo if my investigation goes\noutside of my network,\n\n1598\n01:25:38,562 --> 01:25:42,810\nI can still try to correlate those\nevents across those different systems.\n\n1599\n01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,920\nAnd then we've talked about\nsome of the different utilities\n\n1600\n01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,520\nthat we can use to do this.\n\n1601\n01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:51,850\nTo make it easier because it is a very,\nvery, very tedious process, diving\n\n1602\n01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:57,060\nthrough these log files and trying to\ntrace some event across multiple systems.\n\n1603\n01:25:57,060 --> 01:26:00,350\nSo several tools you could use.\n\n1604\n01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:03,460\nSome free, some not free,\nsome have trials.\n\n1605\n01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:05,170\nIt just depends on which\nway you want to go and\n\n1606\n01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:07,640\nwhich platform you're trying to support.\n\n1607\n01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,680\nA lot of good stuff there, Sean.\n\n1608\n01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:11,790\nAnything else we want to throw\ninto our Blog capturing and\n\n1609\n01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:14,030\nevent correlation episode.\n\n1610\n01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:18,998\n>> Yeah, I think if it's not clear to\nyou by now, I think this is probably one\n\n1611\n01:26:18,998 --> 01:26:23,006\nof those sections that tells you\nyou need to be organized and\n\n1612\n01:26:23,006 --> 01:26:26,068\npatient with this as well, with forensics.\n\n1613\n01:26:26,068 --> 01:26:30,642\nBecause with stuff like this you're going\nto have to be organized to go through\n\n1614\n01:26:30,642 --> 01:26:35,494\nall this and make sure you catch things,\nyou're going to have to be patient because\n\n1615\n01:26:35,494 --> 01:26:38,080\nno one likes to really\nlook at a lot of files.\n\n1616\n01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,320\nI know I don't.\n\n1617\n01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:43,840\nThere are things I'd\nrather be doing than this.\n\n1618\n01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,610\n>> Digging out hang nails, I don't care.\n\n1619\n01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:48,650\nOther than piling through log files.\n\n1620\n01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:53,610\n>> Yeah, so be patient, be organized and,\nI don't know, get a bottle of tequila?\n\n1621\n01:26:53,610 --> 01:26:54,710\nI don't wanna help you out.\n\n1622\n01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:57,260\nWhatever gets you through the night.\n\n1623\n01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,450\n>> Numb you up and go to town.\n\n1624\n01:26:58,450 --> 01:26:59,485\n>> Yeah, maybe that'll help.\n\n1625\n01:26:59,485 --> 01:27:03,580\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, thanks again for tuning in, and\n\n1626\n01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,220\nwe hope you enjoyed the

welcome to\nanother episode of a ITpro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:40.924\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\nwith me today is Mr Shawn Oriano.\n\n5\n00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:42.280\nHow you doing Shawn?\n\n6\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.480\n>> Doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n7\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.640\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.250\nGetting ready to do another\nexciting episode in our\n\n9\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.300\ndigital forensic investigator series.\n\n10\n00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.170\nIn particular in this one, we're gonna\ntake a look at network forensics.\n\n11\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.600\nA lot of our previous\nepisodes we've covered.\n\n12\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.400\nLooking at individual hosts,\nand things like that.\n\n13\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.250\nNow, we're going to talk about\nwhat if my investigation goes\n\n14\n00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.600\nbeyond that host machine?\n\n15\n00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.050\nWhat about if, it involves more than one\nmachine or just part of the attack or\n\n16\n00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.880\npart of the investigation could take\nme towards the network itself, right?\n\n17\n00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.840\n>> Yes.\n\n18\n00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.240\nThe forensics process we talked about so\n\n19\n00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.920\nfar, a lot of it you're gonna carry\nover right to include the network.\n\n20\n00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.630\nThe question is,\n\n21\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.990\nif you have to include the network,\nwhat should you be looking for,\n\n22\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.820\nwhat type of tools are you gonna have to\nuse to extract that sort of information.\n\n23\n00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.455\nThere's really just a lot going on, and\n\n24\n00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:33.850\nthat you could possibly be investigating\nor be called in to take a closer look at.\n\n25\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.560\nSo, that's that's really what we're\nlooking at is stuff's happening in\n\n26\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.980\nthe network and we need to gather that\ninformation in such a way that's nice, and\n\n27\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.650\nsound, and reliable, and verifiable.\n\n28\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.610\n>> So, what we're talking about,\nwe'll start at the beginning.\n\n29\n00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.760\nWe talk about network attacks.\n\n30\n00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.100\nWhat are some types of attacks\nthat we're talking about here.\n\n31\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.850\nWhy might I be called in to\ninvestigate this network?\n\n32\n00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.680\n>> Yeah, there's really just a big old\nbag of network attacks that you have.\n\n33\n00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.220\nPotentially, that could\n\n34\n00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.720\ncause cause you have to be called\nin to do an investigation.\n\n35\n00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.250\n>> You've got a couple hours will\nstart listening out for you.\n\n36\n00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.140\n>> Yeah, oh yeah, there's that or there's\na lot we keep going, and going, and going.\n\n37\n00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.160\nWe've got things like denial\nof service is one that\n\n38\n00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.080\ncould potentially be one you called\nin for, could be session hijacking.\n\n39\n00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.690\nCould be eavesdropping.\n\n40\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.630\nI mean you can keep going on,\nand on, and on about this.\n\n41\n00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.520\nYou could have a data theft.\n\n42\n00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.570\nYou do, it's really just a whole\nnumber of them that could happen.\n\n43\n00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.040\nYou know which one of\nthe would they ask you for?\n\n44\n00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.780\nWhat's the motivation for them asking for\nyou to come, and help them out?\n\n45\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.330\n>> Yeah,\nmaybe maybe your company got attacked, and\n\n46\n00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.290\nhad a denial service\ndone on that web server.\n\n47\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.650\nOr you've got a situation\nwhere an employee is\n\n48\n00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.140\nis doing some session hijacking on other\nemployees to gain access to systems\n\n49\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.010\nthat they shouldn't have access to.\n\n50\n00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.900\nOr very basic one, a very common\none that you might be called in for\n\n51\n00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.910\nis just sniffing the network\nlike capturing packets.\n\n52\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.950\nRemember, if I'm on that network and I can\ncapture packets and it's not encrypted\n\n53\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.720\nI might not have access to the resource,\nbut if you do and I wait until you access\n\n54\n00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.630\nit and then I just capture that traffic,\nthen I might as well have access to it.\n\n55\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.760\nCuz I'm gonna be able to read\nit right out of those packets.\n\n56\n00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.440\nSo, lots of different types of\nattacks that we might face.\n\n57\n00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.530\nNetwork attacks, DOS, session hijacking,\nsniffing, things like that.\n\n58\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.280\nLog alteration attacks would be another.\n\n59\n00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.580\nWhat we got to deal with, right?\n\n60\n00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.190\n>> Yeah.\n\n61\n00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.440\nThat would be definitely another attack\nthat someone might carry out over\n\n62\n00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.240\nthe network, is to is to go after and\nstrike out all of strike against\n\n63\n00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.290\na log file with the intent that they\nare trying to cover up their tracks.\n\n64\n00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.920\nWe we talked out of the previous episode\nyou know the value of log files and\n\n65\n00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.720\ncorrelating data and all that good stuff,\nbut now we're looking at someones on\n\n66\n00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.620\nthe other side, trying to strike out and\nattack these things.\n\n67\n00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.420\nAnd just to kind of throw it in there,\na lot of these attacks that they\n\n68\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.460\ncould be using against you,\nare ones that were again in the CEH.\n\n69\n00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.030\nWe talked about DoSs, DDoSs,\nthe different ways to do sniffing,\n\n70\n00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.340\nthe ways to get around switches,\nthe tack switches,\n\n71\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.400\nthe different things that someone could\ndo to attack, the IDSs and all that.\n\n72\n00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.760\nThere's just so\nmany things they have available to them.\n\n73\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.780\nLog alterations, and the ones they\nmentioned are just a small number of them,\n\n74\n00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.920\nbut we saw a whole lot of\nthose in the CEH course,\n\n75\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.560\njust kind of going through and\nseeing what we have deployed against us.\n\n76\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.600\n>> Yeah, absolutely, cuz remember,\nif you guys are are a premium member,\n\n77\n00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.410\nyou can get access to those.\n\n78\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.840\nOther episodes, go back and watch some of\nthose certified ethical hacker episodes\n\n79\n00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.780\nbecause we do cover that the attacks\nthemselves, and those series of episodes.\n\n80\n00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.470\nSo, yeah, a lot of these things that we've\nseen are on the other side of the fence,\n\n81\n00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.000\nand we've got to be the ones that\ninvestigate it, we've got to be the ones\n\n82\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.830\nthat try to figure out what happened and\ngather evidence so\n\n83\n00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.960\nthat we might be able to terminate\nemployee or reprimand at least,\n\n84\n00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.550\nor take it into a criminal case where\nwhere we're going to prosecute somebody.\n\n85\n00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.430\nBecause, we talk about it in\nour other episodes on CEH.\n\n86\n00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.740\nCompanies like Amazon.\n\n87\n00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.050\nAnd even, if you're not that big,\nyour web server goes down, if that's\n\n88\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.400\nyour primary revenue source for your\ncompany, that's costing you big bucks.\n\n89\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.940\nAnd it's gonna be something that most\nlikely you're going to want to prosecute,\n\n90\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.650\nif you can figure out who did it.\n\n91\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.940\nAnd that's where our job comes in, right?\n\n92\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.670\nWe're gotta be the ones that figure\nout who the heck did it, and\n\n93\n00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.120\nwhere they came from, so\nwe can find them and prosecute.\n\n94\n00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.930\n>> Yeah, and think of how many cases\nthat's come up in over the last few years.\n\n95\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.850\nWe have our target one, would be one\nthat would be a network forensics issue.\n\n96\n00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.050\nThat wasn't just one system, so\nthey would have to go to that.\n\n97\n00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.110\nSony's issue would be\ndefinitely a network issue.\n\n98\n00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.600\nAll the Sony ones you pick,\n\n99\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.710\nI'll let you pick, you just spin the wheel\nand figure out which one you want.\n\n100\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.880\n>> And a lot of that started with figuring\nout like looking at the traffic that these\n\n101\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.590\nPlaystations or\nwhatever were spitting out right.\n\n102\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.080\nAnd seeing something unusual they're\ncalling a home, if you will.\n\n103\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.270\nAre doing something strange, and somebody\nnoticed that by examining that traffic and\n\n104\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.230\nstuff that's going on on the network.\n\n105\n00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.210\n>> Yes, that's exactly right.\n\n106\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.380\nThat's where it would start is that\nsomeone starts doing an investigation.\n\n107\n00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.560\nThey know that there's a problem,\n\n108\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.350\nstart doing an investigation to\nfind out this isn't an accident.\n\n109\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.600\nThere's something\ndeliberate happening here.\n\n110\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.570\nNow, it goes to another level\nwhere you might go from just\n\n111\n00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.580\nIT trying to dissect it, and\nfiguring out why it happened.\n\n112\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.160\nBut now, you're trying to figure what\nthe intent and the motives were.\n\n113\n00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.720\nBehind that strike in,\nif I just how deep it goes.\n\n114\n00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.440\nSo, it could shift from one side to\nthe other and then your likes and\n\n115\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.390\na whole new world where you're\nthe look at your pope and\n\n116\n00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.140\nof these log files in\na whole different way.\n\n117\n00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.700\nBecause now, you are treated\nas a crime scene or incident.\n\n118\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.330\nThat has to be investigated properly just\nin case it ever does go to prosecution, or\n\n119\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.140\nyou need to take some other action.\n\n120\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.810\n>> Absolutely.\n\n121\n00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.400\nAnd so, this is where you\nknow like altering events.\n\n122\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.750\nWe talked about how it's a good idea to\nuse some kind of centralized management\n\n123\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.130\nwith your log systems.\n\n124\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.610\nDo some log shipping, or use subscriptions\nor whatever your platform supports, so\n\n125\n00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.610\nI can get copies of the log\nfiles in multiple places.\n\n126\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.730\nThat might help me find, if somebody's\nbeen altering events in there,\n\n127\n00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.560\nI can compare these things and\nlook for differences.\n\n128\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.820\nI can even just run them through.\n\n129\n00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.570\nI have to look manually, or I can run\nthrough them a hashing out where the both\n\n130\n00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.730\ncopies of that log file,\nsame date range and everything.\n\n131\n00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.460\nAnd they compare hashes, and\nI can see maybe that they are different.\n\n132\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.520\nThen I have to dive in and\nactually start comparing, and\n\n133\n00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.000\ntry to figure out where the differences\nwas really give me a good start on that.\n\n134\n00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.940\n>> That would be definitely be where you\nwould start to really dig into those some,\n\n135\n00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.340\nI would also emphasize to keep,\n\n136\n00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.165\nI'm not trying to sell the CEH course\n>> Even though, it is award winning.\n\n137\n00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:53.010\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, you are.\n\n138\n00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.400\n>> It's an award winning course,\nyou really should watch it.\n\n139\n00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.511\n>> That's right, and there's a great book\nthat goes with that one as well, right?\n\n140\n00:07:57.511 --> 00:08:00.963\n>> Yes, and this is one of\nthe cases it's not better or\n\n141\n00:08:00.963 --> 00:08:03.626\nworse than the book it's just as good.\n\n142\n00:08:03.626 --> 00:08:07.814\nBut it's a When you're feeling\nstressed about the CEH is,\n\n143\n00:08:07.814 --> 00:08:11.999\none of the things when I went\nthrough the CEH with all of you,\n\n144\n00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:16.400\nwhen I talked about this is\nthe mechanism action of an attack.\n\n145\n00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.040\nWe talked about ping sweeps.\n\n146\n00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.170\nWe talked about doing\ndifferent denial of services.\n\n147\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.870\nWe talked about syn floods and\nfyn floods and all that neat stuff.\n\n148\n00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.930\nWe talked about all those things.\n\n149\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.490\nThose are the things that are gonna\nto show up in some of these logs and\n\n150\n00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.800\nespecially for doing network forensics.\n\n151\n00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.950\nWhen you pull out some of the things\nthat we've seen before and\n\n152\n00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.590\npull them out again in\na different context.\n\n153\n00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.140\nYou're gonna be looking for\nthose little key bits\n\n154\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.410\nof things like the way certain flags\nare set, the way certain traffic's moving.\n\n155\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.700\nAll those things are gonna\ncome right back at you.\n\n156\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.430\nNow you're looking at it as,\nhey I didn't know this was coming.\n\n157\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.870\nSomeone struck me.\n\n158\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.820\nNow I'm analyzing some of\nthese capture files and\n\n159\n00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.190\nthings I'm seeing the same stuff I\nsaw if I was carrying out the attack.\n\n160\n00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.510\nI recognize it.\n\n161\n00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.960\nAnd so\nI know what else I should be looking for.\n\n162\n00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.790\n>> Absolutely, absolutely, that's a great\nreason to take that CDH class, right?\n\n163\n00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.000\nBecause knowing your enemy and\n\n164\n00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.548\nneed not fear the death of a thousand\nbattles or some crazy saying.\n\n165\n00:09:18.548 --> 00:09:20.190\n>> Close enough. [LAUGH] >> So\nyou know altering events.\n\n166\n00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.060\nStopping logs was another thing that\nwe talked about in our CEH as well\n\n167\n00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.700\nas this one, because that's what\nthe bad guys are gonna to try to do.\n\n168\n00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.380\nAs an investigator,\nwe need to recognize those gaps.\n\n169\n00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.270\nWe need to see that oh hey,\n\n170\n00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:36.430\nthere's a window of time here\nmissing from these log files.\n\n171\n00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.050\nBeing able to spot that and\n\n172\n00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:42.430\nmaybe I've missed those events because\nthey were able to stop the log vals.\n\n173\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.920\nMaybe not if we were shipping\nthem off to somewhere else or\n\n174\n00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.080\nthey didn't get that part.\n\n175\n00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.190\nBut at least I know that\nsomething happened.\n\n176\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.940\nI recognize the fact that\nsomebody must stop those logs.\n\n177\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.320\nMost log systems, when you go and\n\n178\n00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.510\nstop the log they log an entry saying\nthat somebody stopped the logs.\n\n179\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.840\nSo at least we might have that and\n\n180\n00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.530\nmaybe that's a starting point, but there's\nsomething we've got to worry about.\n\n181\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.940\n>> Yeah.\nYou've got a starting point.\n\n182\n00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.455\nSomeone's cleared it out.\n\n183\n00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:07.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now you just have to figure\n\n184\n00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.420\nout where you're gonna take it from there,\nbut you do have a starting point.\n\n185\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.720\nBut I also think it's\na good thing to mention,\n\n186\n00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.280\nwe're talking about network forensics.\n\n187\n00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.230\nYou know in our previous episode we\ntalked about all the different logs.\n\n188\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.670\nWe just talked about it\nfrom regular system stuff.\n\n189\n00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.080\nYou know that's really what it was.\n\n190\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.710\nWe talked about IS,\nwe talked about DNS, DHCP.\n\n191\n00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.500\nYou know we mentioned that there were\nthings on other platforms that were\n\n192\n00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.840\nequivalent or could be added to the mix.\n\n193\n00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.060\nBut don't forget the stuff\nthat's in applications too.\n\n194\n00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.980\nThose are things that would help\nyou just do it to help you not just\n\n195\n00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.170\nwith the application, but\nalso with network forensics.\n\n196\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.290\nAnd those are things like\nlooking at databases.\n\n197\n00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.460\nDatabases are very common target for\n\n198\n00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.270\nsomeone to strike against from a and\nremote location because\n\n199\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.780\nthey are a nice big juicy target\nof information that they want.\n\n200\n00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.180\nSo of course, they're going to target it.\n\n201\n00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.840\nSo you're going to dig into the logs for\nthat.\n\n202\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.600\nYou might have to dig in logs for\nVPNs and a whole host of other things.\n\n203\n00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.730\nThose are all going to come in\na network forensics that you\n\n204\n00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:10.550\nhave to know they're there.\n\n205\n00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.970\nThe stuff we were talking before\nwith event logs would be,\n\n206\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.590\nwere more likely we were just\ntalking about an individual system.\n\n207\n00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.020\nWe're broadening the horizons now.\n\n208\n00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:26.720\nAnd so the value of what we talked about\nin the previous episode now comes in,\n\n209\n00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.940\nthat comes into really big\nplay because what we have,\n\n210\n00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.620\nwe have a lot of log files out\nthere that have to be correlated.\n\n211\n00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.630\n>> Exactly we had a lot of\nlog files on that one system,\n\n212\n00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.760\nnow we go to the network and\nwe have a lot of, a lot of log files.\n\n213\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.730\nYeah we just compound of the number\nof files we've got there.\n\n214\n00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.570\nAnd speaking of,\nwe talk about investigating log files and\n\n215\n00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:48.960\ntaking into the network.\n\n216\n00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.680\nWhere are some places I can look beyond\nthe system log files that we're already\n\n217\n00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.080\nlooking at as far as\nlike the network goes?\n\n218\n00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.040\nWhere do we see things like that?\n\n219\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.800\n>> Really, you could say anything,\n\n220\n00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.290\nany of the infrastructure that could\nvery well have its own log in it.\n\n221\n00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.160\nIt's just a question of, you know\nsomething that you need to gather.\n\n222\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.680\nHow far away did the attack come from that\nwill determine the different types of\n\n223\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.468\ndevices it came through and\ndifferent areas it came through.\n\n224\n00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:18.370\nWould you be talking ISPs and\nstuff like that or maybe you're not,\n\n225\n00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.770\nmaybe it was all internal.\n\n226\n00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:26.510\nAnd you're just trying to track it down to\nthat insider that's got an axe to grind.\n\n227\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.800\nSo you may know gather stuff\njust off routers and switches or\n\n228\n00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.890\nyou may be going over a firewall or\nyou maybe going even further than that.\n\n229\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:39.370\nSo, this is one of the things\nwhere we go all the way back to\n\n230\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.950\nour initial investigation process and\nsetting goals.\n\n231\n00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.500\nOne of things is stepping back and\nsurveying everything and\n\n232\n00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.670\nfiguring out just how big\na problem we may be looking at.\n\n233\n00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:52.980\nThe clues already may be there to give\nyou a hunch that this is gonna be\n\n234\n00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.450\nway more than just one\nsystem getting targeted.\n\n235\n00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.260\nThis is a much larger area\nthat we are going after.\n\n236\n00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.650\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n237\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.940\nAnd we talk about the intrusion\ndetection systems, right?\n\n238\n00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.890\nBecause that's already,\nthat's monitoring my network.\n\n239\n00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.080\nWhether it's intrusion detection,\nintrusion prevention.\n\n240\n00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.870\nIf it's network based,\nthat's what they do, right?\n\n241\n00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.770\nThey excel at logging this information.\n\n242\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.160\nIf it's intrusion detection,\n\n243\n00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.100\nthat's pretty much all it does is log\nthe stuff and maybe send you an alert.\n\n244\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.370\nIf it's intrusion prevention,\nthen it might step up the game and\n\n245\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.510\ndo something about it but\nthat's really regardless,\n\n246\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.980\nat this point, we need the log\nfiles those systems are capturing.\n\n247\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.190\nI mean there's a wealth of information\nof what's going on, what it's detecting,\n\n248\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.190\nthings it's seeing on the network\nthat don't fit our normal profile.\n\n249\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.160\nSo a great source of information.\n\n250\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.480\nAs you said, depending on where the attack\ncomes from, if it's from the outside.\n\n251\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.230\nWe probably have firewalls in place.\n\n252\n00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.590\nAnd those firewalls again, log everything.\n\n253\n00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.430\nWell, should be configured to\nlog just about everything.\n\n254\n00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.020\nSo we can see that data\nthat's coming in and out.\n\n255\n00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.580\n>> Yes.\n\n256\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.840\nAnd so yeah, you've got so\nmany places it take to gather from.\n\n257\n00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.199\nBut it's also worth mentioning even\nif it we're emphasizing logs a lot.\n\n258\n00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.810\nLogs aren't the only place for\nnetwork forensics.\n\n259\n00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:10.568\nThey are a big part of it but\nthere's other ways into,\n\n260\n00:14:10.568 --> 00:14:15.950\nto investigate a network and see the\ndifferent types of attacks that happened.\n\n261\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:22.510\nLogs may be the the analog of the dead\nsystem that we talked about previously.\n\n262\n00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.280\nWe have a dead system or\na system that's not on.\n\n263\n00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.170\nIf we're trying to investigate\nthat's that system which,\n\n264\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.660\nthere's not as much stuff we have to\ngo through, you know what I mean?\n\n265\n00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.730\nHoops you have to jump through.\n\n266\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.940\nYou've got a live system and\nyou've got a dead system.\n\n267\n00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.160\nLive system you gotta\ntreat with special care.\n\n268\n00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.810\nAnd as we saw previously,\nthere was all these tools we could run.\n\n269\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.360\nThere was the common\nones like Net Stat and\n\n270\n00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.470\nthen there was other ones\nthat dumped event logs.\n\n271\n00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.680\nAnd told us a whole\nwealth of other things.\n\n272\n00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.030\nSo that was a live system collection.\n\n273\n00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.900\nIt's the same thing on a network too.\n\n274\n00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.840\nBut there's really no such thing,\nfor all intents and\n\n275\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.360\npurposes here, it's having live\nnetworking and a dead network.\n\n276\n00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.030\nIt's okay, it's like okay.\n\n277\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.880\n>> Our network here sometimes\nseems a little dead.\n\n278\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:15.239\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] Little on the slow side,\n\n279\n00:15:15.239 --> 00:15:21.994\nbut that's alright, we're all good.\n\n280\n00:15:21.994 --> 00:15:23.279\n>> Yeah, if a networks dead I\nmean if you came up to me and\n\n281\n00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.154\ntold me you're investigating a dead\nnetwork,I mean, you better be taking\n\n282\n00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:26.963\nfingerprints because that means\nnothing's moving over that network.\n\n283\n00:15:26.963 --> 00:15:27.970\nAnd if you're sitting there going\nmy pack is, it doesn't work.\n\n284\n00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:28.607\nI'll be going get out of here.\n\n285\n00:15:28.607 --> 00:15:29.300\nWhat's wrong with you?\n[LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.270\n>> Wouldn't that be a classic.\n\n287\n00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:30.770\nYou can't capture.\n\n288\n00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.866\nYou know I'm sniffing the network and\nI'm getting nothing.\n\n289\n00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:38.060\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, I'll leave you with that.\n\n290\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.640\nYeah I'm going to just walk away.\n\n291\n00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.010\n>> Yeah just leave it there.\n\n292\n00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.450\n>> And yet to answer a quick question\nin the chat room we had there.\n\n293\n00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.537\nDaniel asked,\nwhat is the index that the index.dat file?\n\n294\n00:15:48.537 --> 00:15:54.423\nThat's a file used, basically a database\nfile used by Internet Explorer.\n\n295\n00:15:54.423 --> 00:15:59.130\nAnd it tracks like websites you've been\nto, some autocomplete information.\n\n296\n00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.379\nSome of your searches that you've\ndone through the browser bar or\n\n297\n00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:06.277\nthe address bar itself, it will track\nthose and it's just for performance for\n\n298\n00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:09.941\nInternet Explorer, allows it to quickly\npopulate those search lists and\n\n299\n00:16:09.941 --> 00:16:12.565\nURLs as you're typing them\nin your search history.\n\n300\n00:16:12.565 --> 00:16:15.885\nThere's typically separate\nindex aDAT files or\n\n301\n00:16:15.885 --> 00:16:20.295\nDAT files for history versus cache\nversus searches and things like that.\n\n302\n00:16:20.295 --> 00:16:24.005\nBut that's what those are is\njust a database file for\n\n303\n00:16:24.005 --> 00:16:25.635\nInternet Explorer to use.\n\n304\n00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:29.095\nI'm sure other browsers have\nsomething very similar that.\n\n305\n00:16:29.095 --> 00:16:31.635\nSo back to investigating the network then.\n\n306\n00:16:31.635 --> 00:16:32.725\nLive network, right.\n\n307\n00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:34.530\nWe've got data moving on here.\n\n308\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.100\nCouple tools that we've\nseen in some other shows,\n\n309\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.615\nI don't think we've mentioned them yet\nin here.\n\n310\n00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:42.302\nWireshark is probably one of\nthe first ones that comes to mind.\n\n311\n00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:46.380\n>> Yeah, Wireshark's gonna be one\nof the big ones that you use,\n\n312\n00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.420\npresumably gonna to use.\n\n313\n00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.160\nIt's not the only thing.\n\n314\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.270\n>> Yeah, there's others, right.\n\n315\n00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.340\n>> Yeah, but-\n>> No there's not.\n\n316\n00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.097\n>> But if you use those,\nyou just need a stop watching.\n\n317\n00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:56.240\n>> [LAUGH] right.\n>> No, I'm kidding.\n\n318\n00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.472\nBut you know you've got\nplenty of options here.\n\n319\n00:17:00.472 --> 00:17:02.589\nTo kind of compare and contrast us and\n\n320\n00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:06.735\nput something like Wireshark in context\nwith what we had the log files.\n\n321\n00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:14.880\nIs log files, that's a record of something\nthat happened, that happened before.\n\n322\n00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.910\n>> It means it's already happened.\n\n323\n00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.610\n>> It's in the past.\n\n324\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.860\n>> You can't log it until\nit's actually happened.\n\n325\n00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.790\nWe don't have precognition or\nanything like that.\n\n326\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.830\nI can't log something\nthat hasn't happened yet.\n\n327\n00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:28.390\nSo, yes, as soon as I log it\nthat means it's in the past.\n\n328\n00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.290\nBut, as you're saying,\nmonitoring network traffic,\n\n329\n00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.520\nthat's real time information I'm getting.\n\n330\n00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.000\n>> Yes, and that would be the equivalent\nwhen we talk about alive versus dead.\n\n331\n00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.035\nI mean there is no exact analog for that.\n\n332\n00:17:40.035 --> 00:17:43.580\nBut you can look at the different\nthe tools you can kind of sort\n\n333\n00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.320\nof break them into that category.\n\n334\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.270\nIs that the log files,\npresumably, they're static.\n\n335\n00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.750\nOnce that event's recorded,\nit stays in there until you do something,\n\n336\n00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.426\nso that's the equivalent\nof having a dead system.\n\n337\n00:17:56.426 --> 00:17:59.760\n>> Yeah, log files is a lot like\nwhat we call historical monitoring.\n\n338\n00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.920\nYou're monitoring what's already happened,\nand you've got a permanent record of it.\n\n339\n00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.130\n>> Yeah, exactly,\nwhere doing some like Wireshark is,\n\n340\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.524\nyou're doing that because\nit's happening right now.\n\n341\n00:18:10.524 --> 00:18:15.410\nOr you could be using Wireshark and\ndo to look at pcap files,\n\n342\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.610\nI mean true, and all things\nbeing said yes we could do that.\n\n343\n00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.960\nBut in the context we're talking\nabout here you may use Wireshark or\n\n344\n00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.880\nanother sniffer to actually\ncapture information in real time.\n\n345\n00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.270\nSo, yeah,\nlog files are not the only ones, but\n\n346\n00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.520\nit's just one of them\nin a series of tools.\n\n347\n00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.250\nWireshark would be used to, yeah,\nthis attack is still going on, or\n\n348\n00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.740\nI want to see if it's still going on.\n\n349\n00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.840\nSo I will turn this on and maybe set up\nsome filters if I think that's necessary.\n\n350\n00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:49.350\nAnd start monitoring for\na bit to see what's actually happening,\n\n351\n00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.050\nif anything's happening at all.\n\n352\n00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.220\n>> Yeah, you might have an employee\nthat's sending documents outside of\n\n353\n00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.800\nthe network that are not supposed\nto leave our trusted environment.\n\n354\n00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.310\nI can capture that information using\nall these packet capture utilities.\n\n355\n00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.510\nWireshark, my favorite, but\nNetwork Monitor and several others.\n\n356\n00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.738\nCould be that the employee or\nsomebody has launched an attack and\n\n357\n00:19:08.738 --> 00:19:10.243\nwalked away from the system.\n\n358\n00:19:10.243 --> 00:19:12.943\nAnd before we just shut\nit down to stop it,\n\n359\n00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:17.881\nI want to capture some evidence of that\nattack or see what he was trying to do or\n\n360\n00:19:17.881 --> 00:19:22.380\nsee where that attack is leading or\nwhat systems it's trying to hit.\n\n361\n00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.540\nSo there's a lot of times I need to\ncapture some of that before I try to\n\n362\n00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.010\ncease and desist or stop that attack.\n\n363\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.710\nNot just attack, like I said,\nit could be somebody\n\n364\n00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.170\nsending files outside the organization\nthat aren't supposed to go out there.\n\n365\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.060\nOr downloading stuff to the corporate\nnetwork that violates company\n\n366\n00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.050\nsecurity policy.\n\n367\n00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.140\nIt's not like everything is criminal.\n\n368\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.510\nRemember we're not talking\nabout just criminal here.\n\n369\n00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.780\nA digital forensic investigator\ndoes corporate investigations\n\n370\n00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.120\nas well as criminal investigations.\n\n371\n00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.370\nCould be the bad guys running some kind of\nyou know what type of photography ring.\n\n372\n00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.770\nI don't even like saying that word.\n\n373\n00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.430\nI don't know why.\n\n374\n00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.971\nI don't even like- [CROSSTALK]\n>> I have problems with it too.\n\n375\n00:19:58.971 --> 00:20:00.841\n>> You come up with all these\nways to skirt around it and\n\n376\n00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:04.250\neverybody knows what we're talking about\nit but you understand what I'm saying.\n\n377\n00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.790\nAnd I need to see maybe where\nthat traffic's headed or\n\n378\n00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.060\ncapture some of that traffic as evidence.\n\n379\n00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.935\nSo being able to capture data as\nit's traveling across the network,\n\n380\n00:20:12.935 --> 00:20:15.780\na big part of a forensic investigation.\n\n381\n00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.560\nSometimes we think, oh,\nwhy would I use that, right?\n\n382\n00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.840\nIn an investigation we're investigating\nthings that have already happened,\n\n383\n00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.550\nbut not always.\n\n384\n00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:25.600\nSome of the times it's still going on,\nand I need to capture that information.\n\n385\n00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.470\n>> It was actually brought up\nin here a handful of times.\n\n386\n00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.350\nYeah I remember over the first few\nepisodes of this course, that was\n\n387\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:40.010\nmentioned, when should you let the attack\ncontinue and when should you stop it.\n\n388\n00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:44.620\nAnd I can't tell you exactly\ncircumstances, but they do happen.\n\n389\n00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.930\nCould be a circumstance for example\nwhere the attack is still ongoing and\n\n390\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:53.453\ninstead of just saying I want to terminate\nit now and get the evidence I have,\n\n391\n00:20:53.453 --> 00:20:57.680\nmaybe they think there's a bigger\nfish there, a bigger target.\n\n392\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.460\nSo they're willing to let it run so they\ncan back trace to wherever it came from.\n\n393\n00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.215\nThat might very well be the goal, in which\ncase they are going to let it run and say,\n\n394\n00:21:06.215 --> 00:21:12.350\nokay I'm willing to take a hit on\nthis side because this person or\n\n395\n00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:16.160\nwhoever it on the other side of this has\nbeen kind of knocking on my door for\n\n396\n00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.290\na while, so they could do that.\n\n397\n00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:22.410\nBut that's that's not for\nyou to decide, necessarily.\n\n398\n00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.640\nIt's for you to decide with other\npeople to say, on the team,\n\n399\n00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.240\nto see if this is something\nthat needs to be left alone and\n\n400\n00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.490\nmonitored or\nit needs to be terminated right now.\n\n401\n00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:37.370\nIf it needs to be monitored then, yes,\nyou would use something like Wireshark or\n\n402\n00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:38.500\nanother sniffer.\n\n403\n00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.040\nIt is also, to kinda throw it into\nthe mix here, Wireshark, we all know,\n\n404\n00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.680\nis a very popular sniffer and\nit's got tons of support.\n\n405\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.030\nIt would definitely qualify as a trusted\ntool if you took that into a courtroom.\n\n406\n00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.470\nThere's no doubting that\nit's a trusted tool.\n\n407\n00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.760\nYou'd have to do verification\non what you collected, but\n\n408\n00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.990\nit would be a trusted tool by any stretch.\n\n409\n00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:07.010\nNow, to kind of throw some\nother stuff in there.\n\n410\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.890\nThere are sniffers that are actually\nconsidered to be forensically sound and\n\n411\n00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.520\nthat are specially built for that.\n\n412\n00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.660\nAnd there's ones that\nare actually even built for\n\n413\n00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.990\nlaw enforcement or were built for law\nenforcement and now you have access to.\n\n414\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:25.300\nSo you could actually step it up if you\nreally want to go to that level, and\n\n415\n00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.360\nsome of those things\nare immensely powerful.\n\n416\n00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.260\nThey build on what Wireshark\ndoes by leaps and bounds.\n\n417\n00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.650\nAverage Joe doesn't need that.\n\n418\n00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:39.350\nWireshark was not really meant for\nthat but because of its standing,\n\n419\n00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.560\nits capabilities, it can be used for that.\n\n420\n00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.420\nBut if you're going to be\ndoing a lot of this then there\n\n421\n00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.850\nare definitely other sniffers that kinda\nbump up and raise the ante quite a bit for\n\n422\n00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:54.090\nthe law enforcement and\nthe forensically sound aspect of it.\n\n423\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.275\nSo just something to consider.\n\n424\n00:22:55.275 --> 00:22:56.930\n>> Okay.\n\n425\n00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.540\nOther things, when we were talking\nabout investigating network traffic.\n\n426\n00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.900\nI know we mentioned or we've got on\nour list of things here to talk about,\n\n427\n00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.930\nDNS poisoning, another type of attack that\ncan be carried out across the network.\n\n428\n00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.500\n>> Yes, you might kind of wonder why\nwe're talking about DNS poisoning.\n\n429\n00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.040\nThat was something that\nwas in the CEH class.\n\n430\n00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.610\nWe were talking about\nbreaking into something and\n\n431\n00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:21.600\nredirecting the flow of traffic for\nwhatever purpose we wanted.\n\n432\n00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.990\nWe were saying we could\nuse DNS poisoning to\n\n433\n00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:30.560\nreroute traffic through a DNS server,\nsome location that we specified.\n\n434\n00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.230\nSo we could say, I'm going to put\nsomething in the cache in your system and\n\n435\n00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.730\ncause you to go to go to my server.\n\n436\n00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:44.750\nSo you're checking your cache and find out\nthat oops, that's the unnamed IP mapping.\n\n437\n00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.920\nAnd so you're gonna take that IP and\ngo there.\n\n438\n00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.495\nMeanwhile you don't realize that I've\nshoved that in your cache to go to where I\n\n439\n00:23:51.495 --> 00:23:53.625\nwant to go to, and now I've got you.\n\n440\n00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:57.172\nYou may wonder why we're\nactually using that attack here.\n\n441\n00:23:57.172 --> 00:23:58.422\nAren't we supposed to be investigating\nrather than causing any more?\n\n442\n00:23:58.422 --> 00:24:01.137\n>> [LAUGH] Investigating, yeah.\n\n443\n00:24:01.137 --> 00:24:03.045\n>> Harm.\n\n444\n00:24:03.045 --> 00:24:09.630\nCut away the stuff of I'm going to\na website or something that I control.\n\n445\n00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.160\nYeah that's that's definitely\none thing you could use it for.\n\n446\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.350\nBut think about what it's\ndoing underneath the hood.\n\n447\n00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.190\nIt's redirecting traffic.\n\n448\n00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.060\nSo if I need to redirect\ntraffic some way shape or\n\n449\n00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.860\nform, so it can go through a choke\npoint that I'm monitoring,\n\n450\n00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.958\nthat might be a good idea for\ndoing a forensic investigation.\n\n451\n00:24:28.958 --> 00:24:31.560\nYou just poison a system and\n\n452\n00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.740\nhave it just route through\nwhere my sniffer actually is.\n\n453\n00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.430\nSo it's great, that choke point is where\n\n454\n00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.018\nit can analyze all the sea of information\nand make sure it's being gathered.\n\n455\n00:24:42.018 --> 00:24:45.330\n>> Almost like putting a detour on\nthe road in guiding that traffic\n\n456\n00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.300\nthrough that D.W.I.\nstop or something like that.\n\n457\n00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.460\nIs kind of what we're doing here.\n\n458\n00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:55.180\nWe use DNS poisoning not to attack\nsomebody, but just to reroute that traffic\n\n459\n00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.290\nthrough my investigation,\nthrough my whatever I'm doing.\n\n460\n00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.370\n>> Yeah, it's using that\ntechnique to your advantage.\n\n461\n00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.370\nWe're redirecting traffic\nto make it easier for\n\n462\n00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.380\nus to monitor and get our job done.\n\n463\n00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.560\nIf you didn't do DNS\npoisoning in some cases,\n\n464\n00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.410\nyou might not be able to monitor at all or\nyou may not be able to monitor as easily.\n\n465\n00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:19.200\nSo this could make things a lot easier for\nyou.\n\n466\n00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.760\n>> Another one that's kind of along\nthose same lines I think that we\n\n467\n00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.690\ntalk about maybe on the attack side of\nthings but seems to be in here as well,\n\n468\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.550\nis changing proxy settings.\n\n469\n00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:32.830\n>> Yes you could do that as well you\ncould alter proxy settings again to\n\n470\n00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.530\nreroute them to a system.\n\n471\n00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.910\nAnd that acts as again your choke point.\n\n472\n00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.914\nYou know the cool thing about doing it on\na proxy is it was kind of what you what\n\n473\n00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:44.049\nyou would you were talking\nabout with policy violations.\n\n474\n00:25:44.049 --> 00:25:46.942\nAnd people looking at stuff or\ndoing stuff that they shouldn't.\n\n475\n00:25:46.942 --> 00:25:51.664\nSo if someone is downloading files or\nuploading files or doing whatever,\n\n476\n00:25:51.664 --> 00:25:55.560\nthat you're doing that\nemployee investigation.\n\n477\n00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.980\nYou've got a proxy server and\nthose things can do content filtering and\n\n478\n00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.250\ncan look for things.\n\n479\n00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:06.540\nSo that's another level on there, that you\ncan log stuff from a specific IP address\n\n480\n00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.290\nand just punch it through\na proxy server and boom,\n\n481\n00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:15.200\nnow you're logging stuff from whomever\nto see if they're doing this.\n\n482\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.950\nBut again, you've got evidence\nthat it's leading up to that,\n\n483\n00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.870\nyou wouldn't just do it because that's\nnot a normal thing to say okay,\n\n484\n00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.720\nI gonna route that person's\nrequest to this proxy.\n\n485\n00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.750\nYou'd have to show that there was\na reason to suspect that person and\n\n486\n00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:30.928\nthen you implemented it.\n\n487\n00:26:30.928 --> 00:26:33.844\nBecause you are logging now and\nwe all know the deal,\n\n488\n00:26:33.844 --> 00:26:38.149\nif you watched the previous episode,\nit has to be part of your normal business\n\n489\n00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:41.240\npractice, has to be a record\nof why you did this.\n\n490\n00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.490\n>> I can't just start logging when\nI think there's a problem and\n\n491\n00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:48.750\nexpect that to hold up easily\nthroughout that investigation.\n\n492\n00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.600\nARPTable, so we're probably talking\nabout like poisoning the ARP cache,\n\n493\n00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.010\nmodifying that ARP cache.\n\n494\n00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.850\n>> It's that same type of deal.\n\n495\n00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.190\n>> Yep, same thing.\n\n496\n00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:00.510\nAnd as well as netstat is\nwhat I can use to look for\n\n497\n00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.380\nmy open ports or\nports that I'm listening on.\n\n498\n00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.740\nAnother thing that I might wanna look at\non that machine I'm investigating, right?\n\n499\n00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.960\nSee what it's listening on there.\n\n500\n00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.330\nMight be a back door setup or\nwho knows what.\n\n501\n00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.660\n>> Yeah, remember TCPView?\n\n502\n00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:19.550\nTCPView was another one that we used to\nshow it dynamically, same deal as netstat.\n\n503\n00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.650\nIt's gonna show the connections,\n\n504\n00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.920\ngonna show you live connections\ngoing back and forth.\n\n505\n00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:28.940\nWe use netstat to do an investigation\non a live system to see\n\n506\n00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.430\nwhat connection something\nwe're going back and forth.\n\n507\n00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.260\nYou can do the same thing here.\n\n508\n00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.910\nAnd those tools will\nalso tell you if there's\n\n509\n00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.460\nactively information flowing back and\nforth off that.\n\n510\n00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.630\nSo you could also do additional\ninvestigations on that too.\n\n511\n00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.850\nTo maybe focus in on specific port or\nsomething like that.\n\n512\n00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.010\nTo really kind of cut down to\nthe information that you want.\n\n513\n00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.990\n>> Nice.\n\n514\n00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.460\nAll right well, I'll tell you what,\nlooking at the clock it's about time for\n\n515\n00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.260\nus to take a break so\nwe're gonna step away.\n\n516\n00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.372\nWhen we come back we're gonna continue on\nwith network forensics, so stay tuned,\n\n517\n00:27:58.372 --> 00:27:59.499\nwe'll be right back.\n\n518\n00:27:59.499 --> 00:28:06.440\n[SOUND]\nAll\n\n519\n00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.390\nright welcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n520\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:13.120\nSo continuing on with our network\ninvestigations and our network forensics.\n\n521\n00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.312\nWe talked a little bit about\nwhy we might wanna do or\n\n522\n00:28:16.312 --> 00:28:18.897\nwhy we should do our network forensics.\n\n523\n00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:24.200\nAnd that's because sometimes the target of\nthe investigation is not a single machine.\n\n524\n00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.750\nIt stretches across multiple machines,\nand that includes our network,\n\n525\n00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:31.880\nand especially on live systems we can pick\nup a lot of information by looking at that\n\n526\n00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.550\ntraffic that's going in and out of\nthat system that we're investigating.\n\n527\n00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:36.080\nRight?\n\n528\n00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.520\n>> Yes there's a wealth of\ninformation to collect.\n\n529\n00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.870\nFortunately From your normal IT stuff,\n\n530\n00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:48.520\nif you've worked at it long enough, you\nprobably already know a lot of the tools,\n\n531\n00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.290\nor have at least some experience or\nknowledge of them.\n\n532\n00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:54.940\nAnd that's just going to help you out.\n\n533\n00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.290\nNow we're using those same tools\nthat you may have used before.\n\n534\n00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.960\nTo actually ferret out an attack and\n\n535\n00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.660\nsee just how far it goes and\nto whom it goes to.\n\n536\n00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.060\nSo when we talk about stuff\nlike Wireshark probably\n\n537\n00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.970\na ton of people in here are already going,\nyeah, I know that one.\n\n538\n00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.460\nThat's a great.\n\n539\n00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.740\nWe're just using it a little differently.\n\n540\n00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:20.820\nAnd the cool thing also is that there's\na lot of things that work with the output\n\n541\n00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.180\nthat Wireshark has plus other tools do.\n\n542\n00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.430\nSo, you'll get to\nexperience with other ones,\n\n543\n00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.460\nyou get to trade information back and\nforth.\n\n544\n00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.520\nAnd just some really great stuff there.\n\n545\n00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.250\n>> And as you mentioned earlier Shaun,\nand Wireshark isn't the only one, right?\n\n546\n00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:39.317\nThere's some that are even more so\ngeared towards forensic investigations.\n\n547\n00:29:39.317 --> 00:29:43.063\n>> Yes they do make those because they\nrealize that this is an area that you're\n\n548\n00:29:43.063 --> 00:29:46.216\ngoing to have to do some\ninvestigations in, so they made some,\n\n549\n00:29:46.216 --> 00:29:48.130\nthey made some that can go in.\n\n550\n00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.050\nA lot deeper and\n\n551\n00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:55.830\ndo just specialized things that would\njust be out of place in Wireshark.\n\n552\n00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.940\nThere's one that I always put in my list,\n\n553\n00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:03.970\nNet Witness is one that's been around for\nsome time.\n\n554\n00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.350\nIt actually goes under\na different name I believe now,\n\n555\n00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:12.260\nit's RSA I think bought the technology,\nbut as originally had a code name for\n\n556\n00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:18.820\nit and it was built towards the needs of\nlaw enforcement at the federal level.\n\n557\n00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.650\nIt was built more towards their needs and\n\n558\n00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:26.000\nthen it just got customized and\ntweaked and got more popular.\n\n559\n00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.220\nAnd then it kind of spread out from there\nand it's got a lot of the bells and\n\n560\n00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.960\nwhistles that would be useful for\nthat specific audience.\n\n561\n00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:38.120\nIf I remember it's not really all\nthat cheap as you wouldn't expect.\n\n562\n00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.405\nIt is a fee based product.\n\n563\n00:30:40.615 --> 00:30:43.509\nBut it is something that does\nhave quite a few capabilities.\n\n564\n00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:47.616\nSo if you need that level and are certain\nthrough that type of information or\n\n565\n00:30:47.616 --> 00:30:51.195\nheck you just work for\nlaw enforcement working with them.\n\n566\n00:30:51.195 --> 00:30:54.007\nIt might be a good good idea\nto have that maybe just for\n\n567\n00:30:54.007 --> 00:30:56.677\nthe reason you'd be able to\nshare files with them easier.\n\n568\n00:30:56.677 --> 00:30:57.347\n>> Right.\n\n569\n00:30:57.347 --> 00:30:58.297\nYeah.\n\n570\n00:30:58.297 --> 00:31:00.267\nAnd then we've got a few others I think.\n\n571\n00:31:00.267 --> 00:31:03.347\nDid you want to show something first,\nyou want to go through some of these?\n\n572\n00:31:03.347 --> 00:31:05.459\nLike NetworkMiner is another one I think.\n\n573\n00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:09.977\n>> Yeah NetworkMiner is a really\ninteresting one because NetworkMiner\n\n574\n00:31:09.977 --> 00:31:15.110\nactually is a sniffer but\nit does stuff a little\n\n575\n00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:19.740\ndifferent than normal sniffer but\nit also has another capability on it.\n\n576\n00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.920\nWhat I'm going to do here is I have\non my screen I have Wireshark up and\n\n577\n00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.330\nthis is not a live capture.\n\n578\n00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.030\nIt's a very simple capture.\n\n579\n00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:31.990\nIn fact if you recall from our CEH course.\n\n580\n00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.600\nThis is just a capture of the slammer\nworm in fact you can read it right across\n\n581\n00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.200\ntheir top.\n\n582\n00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.199\nThis is just a short\ncapture what's slammer did.\n\n583\n00:31:44.199 --> 00:31:47.754\nSo I just load this pcap in here and\nyou can poke through this\n\n584\n00:31:47.754 --> 00:31:51.168\nin the middle section you could\nopen up these sayings and\n\n585\n00:31:51.168 --> 00:31:54.160\nkind of take a look to\nsee what's in there.\n\n586\n00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.470\nBut then you could use something\nlike this NetworkMiner.\n\n587\n00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:00.051\nAnd I just took that same pcat file.\n\n588\n00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:03.254\nAnd you can just say, if you kind of\nwant to play out a scenario here.\n\n589\n00:32:03.254 --> 00:32:06.736\nI grabbed some traffic using Wireshark and\n\n590\n00:32:06.736 --> 00:32:12.770\nthen saved it out to file, and\nthen brought it up over here.\n\n591\n00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.890\nP Capital or sorry network minor will\n\n592\n00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:20.300\nactually allow you to you know look at the\ndifferent traffic as it passes over here.\n\n593\n00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.770\nYou can you know open up,\n\n594\n00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:28.080\nyou know some of these packets you can\neasily expand them out and examine them.\n\n595\n00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.590\nAnd you can, depending on what type of\nstuff is flowing back and forth and\n\n596\n00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.960\nI actually have two cases here open or\nwhat they call it.\n\n597\n00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:42.580\nBut these 192 addresses, this represents\njust the slammer portion of it.\n\n598\n00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:47.940\nYou can see that it's given\nme a nice easily formatted\n\n599\n00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.020\nlook at this look at the stuff so\nit's a lot quicker.\n\n600\n00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.964\nIt's to look at the same stuff that\nWireshark is and some of you might be so\n\n601\n00:32:53.964 --> 00:32:57.030\nfluent in Wireshark and\nyou feel like I don't even need this.\n\n602\n00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:57.950\nOkay.\n\n603\n00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.450\nI'm not gonna argue with you.\n\n604\n00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.970\nYou get a toy you prefer and\n\n605\n00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:06.330\nyou're comfortable with, I'd be the last\nperson to tell you to stop using it.\n\n606\n00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:10.570\nSo what this dislodge for like I\nsaid to format a little differently.\n\n607\n00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:14.920\nYou can open these things up and really\nstart getting a deeper look into them\n\n608\n00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.730\nwithout all the extra stuff of Wireshark\nand all that getting in the way.\n\n609\n00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.540\nSo this is a kind of a neat thing.\n\n610\n00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.910\nIt also will grab other stuff, too.\n\n611\n00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:29.110\nIt can grab individual frames\nof an arc like Wireshark\n\n612\n00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:33.269\nfiles as they go across and all different\nsorts of stuff, too, so this is not just\n\n613\n00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.140\nthe exact same thing as Wireshark,\nit does some other things, too.\n\n614\n00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.981\nSo it's worth definitely checking out.\n\n615\n00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:47.386\nThere's some DNS queries from\nmy system that it pulled up,\n\n616\n00:33:47.386 --> 00:33:50.400\nshows the DNS servers and\nall that went through it.\n\n617\n00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:55.620\n>> So you might be that Wireshark is a\npart of the organizations normal every day\n\n618\n00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.670\nlogging process.\n\n619\n00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:00.420\nWe capture traffic, we periodically\nsee what's going on on the network or\n\n620\n00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.090\nsomething like that.\n\n621\n00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:05.700\nSo I generate these files as\na regular basis, because remember,\n\n622\n00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.780\nwe talk about it being part of\nyour normal business operation.\n\n623\n00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.280\nAnd this might be the tool that I\nuse to analyze that in a little bit\n\n624\n00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.510\neasier fashion.\n\n625\n00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.560\nAt this point,\nI might not need to hex dump right,\n\n626\n00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.940\nand Wireshark gives us all that.\n\n627\n00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.590\nIt gives us all the different packets and\nthat middle part where I can expand\n\n628\n00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:24.270\neverything out, and then down at the\nbottom I've got the hex, the actual frame\n\n629\n00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.110\ndetails and things like that,\nwhereas if I'm doing an investigation,\n\n630\n00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.250\nmaybe I just want to focus in\non a particular conversation or\n\n631\n00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.300\nsomething like that so a tool like\nthis might be useful, beneficial.\n\n632\n00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.830\nSo, it just shows you that a a lot of\nthese tools put out a format that's\n\n633\n00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.730\ncross application compatible.\n\n634\n00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:41.390\nMaybe would be a good way to say it.\n\n635\n00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:43.750\nOr I can take the results\nof that that capture and\n\n636\n00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.590\nthen analyze it with\na completely different tool.\n\n637\n00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:51.040\n>> Yes, and that's kind of the name of the\ngame, using whichever ways more efficient,\n\n638\n00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.822\nkind of sort through all the stuff.\n\n639\n00:34:52.822 --> 00:34:57.915\nAnd I'll also point out something else\nhere that comes in handy on something like\n\n640\n00:34:57.915 --> 00:35:03.905\nNetworkMiner is, you'll notice I activated\nthis tab over here for keywords.\n\n641\n00:35:03.905 --> 00:35:08.015\nIf you are starting to pick\nup stuff in a pcap file, and\n\n642\n00:35:08.015 --> 00:35:14.040\nyou know a capture file can get\nvery very very large very quickly.\n\n643\n00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:19.030\nSo if you start finding certain\nthings you want to look for,\n\n644\n00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.340\nyou can go ahead and search for\nit right in here and\n\n645\n00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:25.330\nit will go right on through and\nstart filtering those things out.\n\n646\n00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:31.490\nMight be useful if you start seeing\na pattern of activity or you hear about\n\n647\n00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:36.030\nsomething happening, an attack happening\non other people and you wanna be prepared.\n\n648\n00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:38.838\nYou can actually save those\nkeywords to a text file and\n\n649\n00:35:38.838 --> 00:35:43.420\nload the in and let the text file in and\nit will search on those keywords and\n\n650\n00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.900\nsay yeah the fingerprints\nare all over this.\n\n651\n00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.150\n>> And remember those those utilities are\ncapturing the actual data that you know\n\n652\n00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:54.960\nthe payload of those packets not just the\nheader information so that keyword search\n\n653\n00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.600\ncould be for a word that you know is\nin some documents on your network.\n\n654\n00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.550\nAnd you want to find if those documents\nare being sent out of the network.\n\n655\n00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:04.114\nI can search for\nthose keywords through there.\n\n656\n00:36:04.114 --> 00:36:07.238\nSearch that entire package looking for\nthose words.\n\n657\n00:36:07.238 --> 00:36:09.600\nFantastic, other tools\nwe've got available.\n\n658\n00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:16.080\nYou get T.C.P. dump, wind dump,\nbut are again just more utilities.\n\n659\n00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.630\n>> Yeah that's all they are.\n\n660\n00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:21.980\nThey're packet sniffers just like\nWireshark where there's no GUI to them.\n\n661\n00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.512\nTcpdump is Linux.\n\n662\n00:36:23.512 --> 00:36:25.030\nWinDump is Windows,\n\n663\n00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:28.830\nyou just run from the command line and\npipe the stuff out to a file.\n\n664\n00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.960\nAnd you're good.\n\n665\n00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.380\nThing about it is with something like\nthat they're a lot faster, there's less\n\n666\n00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:40.020\noverhead, there's no buoy in there so it\ndoesn't have to deal with rendering that.\n\n667\n00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.260\nSo you can just start dumping\ninformation into a file very, very,\n\n668\n00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:47.420\nvery quickly and be done with it.\n\n669\n00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:52.200\nAnd it would also be considered to be\nforensically sound because it's old,\n\n670\n00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.080\nthat's not a new tool,\nthat's been around for ages.\n\n671\n00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.910\n>> Yeah and this would be a great time to\nto have one of those GUI front ends like\n\n672\n00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.520\nNetwork Minor, whereas with with Wireshark\n\n673\n00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.470\nmaybe I don't use Network Minor\nbecause I've already got that GUI.\n\n674\n00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:09.930\nWith something like WinDump I\ndon't have that fancy GUI so\n\n675\n00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:12.200\nsomething like network minor,\nlet me take those maybe and\n\n676\n00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.730\ngo back into keyword searches and\nthings like that.\n\n677\n00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.240\nI think Network Minor is awesome.\n\n678\n00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.970\nSo I think it's something that's got, and\n\n679\n00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.520\nI think it's got a trial version if I\nremember correctly and a paid version.\n\n680\n00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.720\n>> There's a free edition it looks like\nand I think I gave you one link let me\n\n681\n00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.420\ngive you guys another link for\nthe actual download,\n\n682\n00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:32.140\nit's going to take you over to Source\nwhich is where you can grab that guy.\n\n683\n00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.410\nI will throw that link out there.\n\n684\n00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:40.720\n>> Yeah I put the page up on either,\nI brought the page up here on my screen.\n\n685\n00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.660\nJust so you guys can see it.\n\n686\n00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.590\nYou can see that there are two\nversions of this, the free edition and\n\n687\n00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:47.432\nthe pro edition.\n\n688\n00:37:47.432 --> 00:37:52.820\nFree edition, that's what we\nwere using and you can see it.\n\n689\n00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:58.950\nIt's a sniffer, it does the packet\ncaptures, can fingerprint,\n\n690\n00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:03.695\noperate systems, but then you look at\nthe pro one, that may be what you want as\n\n691\n00:38:03.695 --> 00:38:08.015\na forensic tech if you really wanted to go\nto that next level, because take a look.\n\n692\n00:38:08.015 --> 00:38:10.245\nIt can export stuff out to CSVs and Excel,\n\n693\n00:38:10.245 --> 00:38:13.075\nso that's that's another\nconvenience you have there.\n\n694\n00:38:13.075 --> 00:38:18.415\nAnd then you get you have something\nto base it off geography so\n\n695\n00:38:18.415 --> 00:38:20.392\nI can start tracing those things down.\n\n696\n00:38:20.392 --> 00:38:22.910\nThose things could be\nvery very very useful\n\n697\n00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:24.620\nin the event that you have\nto do an investigation.\n\n698\n00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:29.550\nSo this might be just one additional tool\nthat you add to your toolkit and you know,\n\n699\n00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:34.160\nyeah it's a little pricey,\n$700 bucks, but you know.\n\n700\n00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.200\n>> This is your job?\n\n701\n00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.299\nIf this is your business where if you work\nfor an organization you might convince\n\n702\n00:38:39.299 --> 00:38:43.400\nthem that a tool like this really is\nimportant, and that initial vestment might\n\n703\n00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.070\nbe a little high but you're going to get\nsome good news out of the most likely, so.\n\n704\n00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.850\n>> Yeah.\nI would think something like this\n\n705\n00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:54.050\nwould be very handy to have\nas a forensics person.\n\n706\n00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.300\nI wouldn't say go out and get it now.\n\n707\n00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.050\nI wouldn't say,\ntelling guys oh well go ahead, go get it.\n\n708\n00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.220\nIt's awesome.\n\n709\n00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.330\n>> And\nI just bought my subscription to Echosec.\n\n710\n00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:04.880\nI mean, give me a chance\nto get my money back here.\n\n711\n00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.095\n>> Pull up the bank account, recover.\n\n712\n00:39:06.095 --> 00:39:08.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I wouldn't say yeah,\n\n713\n00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:12.530\ngo ahead and go out and get this now,\nbut I'd say if you're someone that's\n\n714\n00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.490\ndoing this out there,\nyou start getting really proficient and\n\n715\n00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:20.310\ndo it as a part of your regular job,\nthen this could be a big time saver.\n\n716\n00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.740\n>> Absolutely.\n\n717\n00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.090\nSome others that we were\nprobably familiar with, or\n\n718\n00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:27.060\nI'm sure you've probably heard the names,\nand really along the same lines.\n\n719\n00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.800\nSnort is a very common packet capturer.\n\n720\n00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.975\nYou got AirSnort,\nI think that does the wireless as well, so\n\n721\n00:39:33.975 --> 00:39:35.655\nit's got both ends covered.\n\n722\n00:39:35.655 --> 00:39:36.565\n>> Yes.\n\n723\n00:39:36.565 --> 00:39:42.465\nThe Snort we're talking about here\nwould be, is an IDS, so it's a packet\n\n724\n00:39:42.465 --> 00:39:45.805\nsniffer and it's got that additional\nfunctionality built on top of it.\n\n725\n00:39:45.805 --> 00:39:50.180\nThe reason why we would have something\nlike this, up and above our IDS's that we\n\n726\n00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:54.361\nalready have a network, is this might\nbe something that we can customize for\n\n727\n00:39:54.361 --> 00:39:57.921\nspecific purpose,\ninstead of sending out alerts or anything.\n\n728\n00:39:57.921 --> 00:40:00.936\nIt's gonna look for\ncertain patterns of traffic and\n\n729\n00:40:00.936 --> 00:40:02.930\nstart logging just those things.\n\n730\n00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:05.129\nMaybe you've gone to Wireshark.\n\n731\n00:40:05.129 --> 00:40:08.539\nAnd then you've gone to taking that\nstep over to Network Miner and\n\n732\n00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:11.887\ndone some searches and transformed it and\ndone all that stuff and\n\n733\n00:40:11.887 --> 00:40:15.070\nfound some things that really\ncaught your attention.\n\n734\n00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:19.990\nWell then,\nnow might be the time to turn on Snort to\n\n735\n00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:23.850\nsee if you can start seeing are there\nany other hits of that type of traffic.\n\n736\n00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.010\nSure, you could do it with\nsomething like Wireshark.\n\n737\n00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:29.230\nWireshark is designed to\nbe a packet capturer.\n\n738\n00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.130\nBut, even though it's designed\nto be a packet capturer and\n\n739\n00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:38.180\nyou can set filters all in on it, it's not\ndesigned for the purpose that Snort was.\n\n740\n00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.470\nSnort's designed specifically to see that.\n\n741\n00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:42.640\nIt'd log it and alert you on it, so\n\n742\n00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:48.180\nthat would give you an additional level\nto take into a court room or something\n\n743\n00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:53.100\nlike that is that you have a log generated\ntoo to go and to also show that traffic.\n\n744\n00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.130\nYou know, yeah you can go and\nyou go into a court room and\n\n745\n00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.250\nwhiteboard out the stuff, or\nand whatever you wanted, and\n\n746\n00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.563\nWireshark, I don't know if I'd\nwant to do that, you know.\n\n747\n00:41:01.563 --> 00:41:04.330\n[LAUGH] I want to make something that's\nnice, colorful and pretty and easy and\n\n748\n00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.440\ngets to the point.\n\n749\n00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.488\n>> Jurors love that.\n\n750\n00:41:06.488 --> 00:41:07.470\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n751\n00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.630\nYeah, I don't want stuff just\nshooting over their head.\n\n752\n00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.490\nI want them to see it, black and\nwhite, easy and like, oh.\n\n753\n00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:14.220\nI get it.\n\n754\n00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.600\nThat's what we need to have.\n\n755\n00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.430\n>> Then we've got one called\nthe Maytag Network Analyzer.\n\n756\n00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:22.220\n>> Yeah.\nThat's another one that even goes up\n\n757\n00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.710\na little further.\n\n758\n00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:26.990\nYeah, that does some other\nnice little features.\n\n759\n00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:30.580\nThat one I also believe is\na paid one if memory serves.\n\n760\n00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:34.908\nI work with so many different tools that\nsometimes it's easy to get lost in them.\n\n761\n00:41:34.908 --> 00:41:39.480\nThat's another one that sits out there and\nit can also do some other types of network\n\n762\n00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.930\nanalysis, include some other little tools\nto make things a little easier for you.\n\n763\n00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:45.990\n>> They're going to pump up a link on me.\n\n764\n00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:47.380\nLet me make sure that link is good.\n\n765\n00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.504\nI don't trust that one.\n\n766\n00:41:48.504 --> 00:41:50.525\nI'll double check on that one there.\n\n767\n00:41:50.525 --> 00:41:52.301\nIris is another one.\n\n768\n00:41:52.301 --> 00:41:54.147\nThat's a good one.\n\n769\n00:41:54.147 --> 00:41:55.446\n>> Iris is another one.\n\n770\n00:41:55.446 --> 00:42:00.236\nIris is another form of sniffer but\nthis one was actually tweaked, and\n\n771\n00:42:00.236 --> 00:42:03.170\nset up to be specific for doing forensics.\n\n772\n00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:08.440\nIt does include some features that\nare very useful for that specific purpose.\n\n773\n00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:13.905\nSo if you want to have the extra\nlevel then, there you go.\n\n774\n00:42:13.905 --> 00:42:18.895\nBut it's not the only one, there are other\nones, again designed to do forensics work.\n\n775\n00:42:18.895 --> 00:42:22.445\nYou know, so like Leo said,\nif you need to have the additional level\n\n776\n00:42:22.445 --> 00:42:26.825\nof warm fuzzy feeling and have that,\nthose things are designed specifically for\n\n777\n00:42:26.825 --> 00:42:30.870\nforensics then, yeah, by all means,\ngo ahead and use those.\n\n778\n00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.370\nBut there's always ways to verify.\n\n779\n00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.730\nI've already given you the tools to verify\nall the stuff that comes out of it, for\n\n780\n00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:36.300\nthe most part.\n\n781\n00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.710\n>> What's some others we\nneed to mention there?\n\n782\n00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:42.250\nNetwitness would be one.\n\n783\n00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:43.210\n>> Yeah, Netwitness.\n\n784\n00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:44.692\nDid you put a link up to that one?\n\n785\n00:42:44.692 --> 00:42:46.510\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I think I did earlier.\n\n786\n00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:49.893\nIt might have been in the previous\nepisode or a previous segment, but yes.\n\n787\n00:42:49.893 --> 00:42:51.458\n>> Yeah.\n\n788\n00:42:51.458 --> 00:42:52.677\nNo.\n\n789\n00:42:52.677 --> 00:42:57.172\nNetwitness is one that,\njust to kind of mention it again,\n\n790\n00:42:57.172 --> 00:43:00.760\nNetwitness been around for ages and ages.\n\n791\n00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.080\nIt's not something that's new.\n\n792\n00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:07.970\nI want to say it's been around for\nabout ten years now, you know,\n\n793\n00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:11.010\nwhich is a long time in computer years,\nof course.\n\n794\n00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:16.770\nIt's been around for a while it's\na pretty capable tool it has nice ways of\n\n795\n00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:21.340\ndisplaying the information to make it easy\nto follow, and can pull up log files all\n\n796\n00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:26.160\nstuff and help you with a lot of analysis\nof that information that's coming in.\n\n797\n00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.520\nLike I said it proved because\nof all the stuff it could do,\n\n798\n00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.750\nit proved very popular\nwith law enforcement.\n\n799\n00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.890\nIt's been tweaked a lot since its origin.\n\n800\n00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:39.630\nUsed to be something that if\nyou heard it outside of that,\n\n801\n00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:45.360\noutside of law enforcement,\nit was rare because it was their toy.\n\n802\n00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.000\nThey're the ones that got to use it.\n\n803\n00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.150\nAnd no one else got to use it.\n\n804\n00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:53.000\nThen word started leaking out that it was,\nthat they had this thing.\n\n805\n00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.230\nAnd then other people said,\nhey that be great to have.\n\n806\n00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:56.760\nSo more people got access to it.\n\n807\n00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.660\nThen eventually, it was opened up.\n\n808\n00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:00.880\nSo now really anybody can get it.\n\n809\n00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.700\nAnybody that can pay the price for\nit, can get it.\n\n810\n00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.910\nI guess is a better way to put it.\n\n811\n00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:11.412\nHeck, at one point when, before Wireshark\nexisted and it was still called Ethereal,\n\n812\n00:44:11.412 --> 00:44:16.210\nNetwitness was actually considered to\nbe the most powerful sniffer out there.\n\n813\n00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.880\nSo it was it was, by a lot of people.\n\n814\n00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.640\nThey looked at because of the breadth\nof information it could get for\n\n815\n00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.950\nyou with very little effort.\n\n816\n00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:30.040\nNowadays Wireshark's kind of\ntaken that role over, but\n\n817\n00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.090\nnot entirely for what Netwitness can do.\n\n818\n00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:36.010\nSo just a little bit of history.\n\n819\n00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:40.720\nYeah, as Guido put up there,\nit used to be law enforcement only.\n\n820\n00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.240\nYou had to prove that to get that tool, or\n\n821\n00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.300\nyou had to prove a very valid reason for\nhaving that tool.\n\n822\n00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.020\nAnd so they just wouldn't sell it to you.\n\n823\n00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.430\nSo you had to prove it.\n\n824\n00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:59.180\nYou had to show a department purchase\norder or something along those lines.\n\n825\n00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.100\nAn order had to be put on\na department letterhead,\n\n826\n00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.710\nit had to be verified and everything\nbefore you could get your hands on it.\n\n827\n00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:09.470\nAnd if you don't have those, oh well.\n\n828\n00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:10.240\n>> You weren't gonna get it.\n\n829\n00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.250\n>> Yeah.\nYou just weren't gonna get it.\n\n830\n00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.960\nThey would just stop the conversation\nright there, it's not for you.\n\n831\n00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:21.890\nSo nowadays that has changed and you\ncan get access to it but kind of wonder\n\n832\n00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:25.959\nhow much access they want you to have when\nthey charge a lot of money for it [LAUGH].\n\n833\n00:45:25.959 --> 00:45:28.400\nIt's like, you can have it,\njust got to pay all this money right here.\n\n834\n00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:33.220\nYou need to pile up a couple of\nbriefcases of money and large bills.\n\n835\n00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:33.830\nAnd so.\n\n836\n00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.240\n>> Another one that we were talking\nabout earlier was actually this one,\n\n837\n00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.530\nGive Me Two email analyzer.\n\n838\n00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:47.120\n>> Yes, Give Me Two is one that is,\nit's probably not one that you necessarily\n\n839\n00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:52.300\nheard about, but you probably have heard\nabout that functionality in other places.\n\n840\n00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.970\nBut Give Me Two is one that\nkinda gets spit out now and\n\n841\n00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:58.020\nthen when you're talking about forensics.\n\n842\n00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:04.280\nWhat Give Me Two does is it's actually\na company, they have a sniffer in there,\n\n843\n00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.740\nand that sniffer can not just\nsniff network traffic but\n\n844\n00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:14.600\nit can also sniff other types\nof traffic HTTP, specifically.\n\n845\n00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:19.880\nIt can do mail traffic, looking for\npasswords and certain things like that.\n\n846\n00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.792\nSo it can really kind of\nnarrow stuff down and\n\n847\n00:46:22.792 --> 00:46:25.280\nfilter it down to specific\ntypes of traffic.\n\n848\n00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:30.460\nWhich in the CEH class\nwe talked about dSniff.\n\n849\n00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:34.490\nThe dSniff suite would be\na direct analog of this.\n\n850\n00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:38.370\nIt does pretty much the same thing.\n\n851\n00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:42.570\nThis just happens to be something else but\nthis is on the Windows platform.\n\n852\n00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:46.710\ndSniff, yes, I know before anyone\njumps down my throat or anything.\n\n853\n00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:51.260\nYeah, Dsniff you can get for the Windows\nplatform if you really dig around for\n\n854\n00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:56.070\nit, but this is one that was specifically\nbuilt for the Windows platform and\n\n855\n00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:59.780\ncan sniff all those different\ntypes of traffic for you.\n\n856\n00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.550\n>> Again, another one,\nI've got a link for it.\n\n857\n00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:02.170\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\n858\n00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:06.250\nI just wanna make sure that I'm going\nto the right place here sometime.\n\n859\n00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.470\nI don't ever want to post\na link to a chat room.\n\n860\n00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:12.660\nThat takes you out to some place that's\ngoing to throw nasty stuff on your machine\n\n861\n00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.160\nso let me just validate that link\nbefore I give it to you guys.\n\n862\n00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.410\nSo lots of different tools really the\npoint of all that was there are several\n\n863\n00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:23.350\ndifferent tools that we can use for\nour analysis of our\n\n864\n00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:26.550\ntraffic that's traveling across our\nnetwork and the choice is up to us.\n\n865\n00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:30.550\nDepending on what level of capture and\nanalyzer we need.\n\n866\n00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:33.250\nWhether we wanna go free,\nwhether we wanna pay.\n\n867\n00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.880\nAnd, what the different bells and\nwhistles that it includes and\n\n868\n00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.850\nhow much we wanna spend on it\nreally makes the end decision.\n\n869\n00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:40.540\nAs always, though,\n\n870\n00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:44.240\nwe say we've gotta worry about making\nsure that it's a trustworthy utility.\n\n871\n00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.290\nSomething that's going to be recognized\nby the court systems or what have you.\n\n872\n00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:49.918\nWhich is what we're giving here.\n\n873\n00:47:49.918 --> 00:47:57.420\n>> Yeah, and there's additional things on\nsniffing I mentioned in the CEH class.\n\n874\n00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:03.179\nA lot of the tools and techniques\nthere Would actually be valuable here.\n\n875\n00:48:03.179 --> 00:48:07.346\nTalked about doing things like\nDNS poisoning and art poisoning,\n\n876\n00:48:07.346 --> 00:48:11.960\nthose were right out of the playbook\nfrom being an ethical hacker.\n\n877\n00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:17.450\nSo, those are gonna carry on right over\nhere plus those various tools out there.\n\n878\n00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:21.891\nSo, maybe take a second look at those\nthings in the context of what we're doing\n\n879\n00:48:21.891 --> 00:48:25.278\nhere, to see okay, well yeah,\nI've got something else.\n\n880\n00:48:25.278 --> 00:48:30.436\nI can use over here to analyze my traffic.\n\n881\n00:48:30.436 --> 00:48:34.052\nThere's a literally a wealth\nof things to see that\n\n882\n00:48:34.052 --> 00:48:38.885\nyou could use that we haven't even\ntouched upon, in this course.\n\n883\n00:48:38.885 --> 00:48:43.125\nThere's so many things out there so,\njust to kind of put that in your mind.\n\n884\n00:48:43.125 --> 00:48:44.645\n>> Definitely, complimentary information,\n\n885\n00:48:44.645 --> 00:48:46.530\nso make sure you go back and\nwatch those episodes again.\n\n886\n00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:51.150\n>> We haven't put in the hardware-based\nones yet, because that was mentioned\n\n887\n00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:55.368\nthe in the CEH course,\nwas the hardware-based protocol analyzers.\n\n888\n00:48:55.368 --> 00:49:01.730\nIn the CEH course, if you recall,\nif you were attending that course, or\n\n889\n00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:07.190\nwatched the recordings, you remember\nthat I was very clear about saying\n\n890\n00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:13.340\nyou're probably not ever going to have\na need for a hardware protocol analyzer.\n\n891\n00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.510\nThey're prohibitive.\n\n892\n00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:17.180\nThey typically can be very pricey.\n\n893\n00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.100\nAnd then,\n\n894\n00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:22.660\nyou don't necessarily need to dig into the\nphysical layer like that all that often.\n\n895\n00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.940\nFor here,\nyou might very well need to do that.\n\n896\n00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.270\nIt's not impossible.\n\n897\n00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:34.140\nSomeone could be snooping on\nby punching into a line, or\n\n898\n00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:40.000\nsomething along those trains of thought.\n\n899\n00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.710\nSo, you might very well need one.\n\n900\n00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:46.240\nAgain, I'm not going to tell you hey,\ngo out and get one today.\n\n901\n00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.476\nBut-\n>> Let me cancel my order, hold on.\n\n902\n00:49:48.476 --> 00:49:49.196\n>> Yeah.\n\n903\n00:49:49.196 --> 00:49:52.510\nThey haven't set my\ncommission account up yet, so\n\n904\n00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:55.292\nas soon as that's set\nup you should buy it.\n\n905\n00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:59.870\nBut you could very well find\na place in your tool kit for those.\n\n906\n00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:01.880\nI honestly, don't expect you will, but\n\n907\n00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.650\nthere might be a better reason here\nthan there is on the other side.\n\n908\n00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:10.540\nBut I would wait till you get\na request for that first.\n\n909\n00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:13.471\nWho knows, maybe it maybe it's\nbetter off for you to rent one or\n\n910\n00:50:13.471 --> 00:50:16.956\nlease one from someone, than it is for\nyou actually to purchase one because\n\n911\n00:50:16.956 --> 00:50:19.686\nyou may not end use it that often\nif you ever use them at all.\n\n912\n00:50:19.686 --> 00:50:20.941\n>> Right again.\n\n913\n00:50:20.941 --> 00:50:24.741\nAll right, so, to tie all this together,\nthere's really when we talk about\n\n914\n00:50:24.741 --> 00:50:28.719\nanalyzing networking and doing these\nnetwork forensic, we're really talking\n\n915\n00:50:28.719 --> 00:50:32.070\nabout gathering information as\nit's traveling across a network.\n\n916\n00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:36.888\nPossibly even using some of our attack\ntechniques that we've learned in other\n\n917\n00:50:36.888 --> 00:50:41.268\nepisodes of other shows to facilitate\ncapturing that information by,\n\n918\n00:50:41.268 --> 00:50:43.759\nas you called it, making chokepoints.\n\n919\n00:50:43.759 --> 00:50:48.606\nRerouting traffic through DNS poisoning or\nchanging proxy settings, so\n\n920\n00:50:48.606 --> 00:50:54.092\nwe can get that traffic flowing through a\nparticular point that I am monitoring on.\n\n921\n00:50:54.092 --> 00:50:57.364\nWe've talked about a couple different\ntypes of tools that we can use or\n\n922\n00:50:57.364 --> 00:51:00.570\na few different tools we could\nused to accomplish all of this.\n\n923\n00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:01.500\nIn the end,\n\n924\n00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:05.450\nwe wanna make sure obviously that we're\ndocumenting everything that we do or\n\n925\n00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:11.660\nkeeping meticulous records on, date and\ntime stamp, gathering this information.\n\n926\n00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:15.174\nWhat are the big ones that we're looking\nfor that when we do our documentation that\n\n927\n00:51:15.174 --> 00:51:17.870\nhere's really some things we've\ngot to focus in on, right?\n\n928\n00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:24.760\n>> Yes, it's really comes down to\nthe whole all the Ws or most of the Ws.\n\n929\n00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.450\nThe who, what, where,\nwhen, all those things.\n\n930\n00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:30.740\nThat's what we're looking at here you\nneed to be able to determine that.\n\n931\n00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.126\nAnd that's true with anything else.\n\n932\n00:51:32.126 --> 00:51:33.368\nThat's true with our logging in as well.\n\n933\n00:51:33.368 --> 00:51:36.132\nThis really isn't like a new concept here.\n\n934\n00:51:36.132 --> 00:51:40.794\nIs that you want to be able to determine\nthose, and it becomes a much more complex\n\n935\n00:51:40.794 --> 00:51:44.694\nissue when you're talking on\nthe network level because you have so\n\n936\n00:51:44.694 --> 00:51:47.218\nmany different places to answer those Ws.\n\n937\n00:51:47.218 --> 00:51:50.638\nIt's not just one location,\nit's multiple locations.\n\n938\n00:51:50.638 --> 00:51:53.900\nSo, you're gonna have to\ngo find those things out,\n\n939\n00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:57.860\nwhere they live and extract accordingly.\n\n940\n00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.490\n>> And that really is the whole goal\nof logging in the first place, right?\n\n941\n00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:02.930\nIt's to determine who did it,\nwhat they did,\n\n942\n00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:07.430\nwhen they did it and where they were, or\nwhere it was coming from when they did it.\n\n943\n00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:12.070\nI mean, the only thing we don't answer\nwith our log files is why and how.\n\n944\n00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:14.620\nAnd even how kind of possibly.\n\n945\n00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:17.190\nWe could we could maybe deduce\nfrom the information that,\n\n946\n00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:19.640\nbut it is those as you said\nthat the four Ws there.\n\n947\n00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.397\nThe who, what, when, and\nwhere is what makes up our log files,\n\n948\n00:52:22.397 --> 00:52:25.923\nand that's what we're trying to determine\nlooking at the log files it is with this\n\n949\n00:52:25.923 --> 00:52:29.373\nwith the network analysis, that's\nthat's what we're trying to figure out.\n\n950\n00:52:29.373 --> 00:52:30.418\nSo documenting that.\n\n951\n00:52:30.418 --> 00:52:32.040\n>> Yeah the why.\n\n952\n00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.031\nYeah that's-\n>> Do we care?\n\n953\n00:52:34.031 --> 00:52:35.068\n>> Well, we do but-\n>> Well,\n\n954\n00:52:35.068 --> 00:52:36.155\nmaybe after the investigation we care.\n\n955\n00:52:36.155 --> 00:52:38.476\nMaybe to prevent it in the future.\n\n956\n00:52:38.476 --> 00:52:43.394\n>> Yeah or knowing the why can\nactually help you determine where\n\n957\n00:52:43.394 --> 00:52:46.200\nnext to go on your investigation.\n\n958\n00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:51.430\nThey've said for ages there's three\nthings you need to have for a crime.\n\n959\n00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:53.830\nIt's motive, means and opportunity.\n\n960\n00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:57.368\nSo we've got, we can answer the means.\n\n961\n00:52:57.368 --> 00:53:02.130\nAnd we can answer the opportunity\nby doing a close analysis of it.\n\n962\n00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:07.007\nBut the actual motive is\na lot harder to gather.\n\n963\n00:53:07.007 --> 00:53:12.634\nYou might be able to assume it based\non just experience and sometimes just\n\n964\n00:53:12.634 --> 00:53:18.830\nget that gut feeling that this is the\ndirection this person was going with this.\n\n965\n00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:23.371\nAnd you might push your investigation\nalong those lines and find out that yeah,\n\n966\n00:53:23.371 --> 00:53:26.570\nit did expand open into\na much larger area.\n\n967\n00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:31.050\nSo, the why,\nsometimes you can determine it early on,\n\n968\n00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.180\nsometimes you're gonna\nto determine it later.\n\n969\n00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.109\nSometimes you may not be\nable to determine it at all.\n\n970\n00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:41.109\nIt might not be till you get to\nthe courtroom and that person,\n\n971\n00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:45.737\nif you take them to the courtroom,\nthat you're gonna find out why they\n\n972\n00:53:45.737 --> 00:53:49.358\ndecided to do whatever it is\nthat they were caught for.\n\n973\n00:53:49.358 --> 00:53:52.017\n>> When they're pleading for their\nlife that's when they give it all up.\n\n974\n00:53:52.017 --> 00:53:54.528\n>> If we're lucky.\n\n975\n00:53:54.528 --> 00:53:56.710\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] Hopefully,\n\n976\n00:53:56.710 --> 00:54:01.250\nnot too many network attacks that give\nthe death penalty, but you never know.\n\n977\n00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:02.397\n>> There actually are, did you know it?\n\n978\n00:54:02.397 --> 00:54:05.310\nThere actually are some reasons you\ncan network attack could get you\n\n979\n00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:05.910\nthe death penalty.\n\n980\n00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:08.140\n>> Oh yeah, treason I guess probably.\n\n981\n00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.660\n>> Treason's very tough because you've got\nto have at least two other people that\n\n982\n00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:16.005\nwill verify it and you've got to have\na jury willing to push for that.\n\n983\n00:54:16.005 --> 00:54:17.190\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> But it's very,\n\n984\n00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:21.340\nthat one's been very tough but\nactually the ones you would get\n\n985\n00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:25.930\nthe death penalty for, network, any sort\nof hacking attack, is almost guaranteed,\n\n986\n00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:29.510\nif you cause anyone to lose their\nlife during the course of it.\n\n987\n00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.420\nThey can immediately become eligible for\nthat.\n\n988\n00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:36.700\nSo, if you decide to mess around\nwith a 911 call center or\n\n989\n00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:38.590\nsomething like that, they can bust you.\n\n990\n00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:41.004\nAnd they can say you know\nthey're gonna fry you for that.\n\n991\n00:54:41.004 --> 00:54:42.967\nIt's not spam like you guys maybe wishing.\n\n992\n00:54:42.967 --> 00:54:45.044\n>> [LAUGH] Like we wish we could.\n\n993\n00:54:45.044 --> 00:54:45.624\n>> Yeah.\n\n994\n00:54:45.624 --> 00:54:47.740\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n995\n00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:49.420\nAll right.\nWell, Sean, a lot of good stuff there for\n\n996\n00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:50.254\nour network forensics.\n\n997\n00:54:50.254 --> 00:54:52.958\nAnything else we wanna throw in here\nbefore we call this episode a wrap?\n\n998\n00:54:52.958 --> 00:54:55.849\n>> I think we covered quite a bit here.\n\n999\n00:54:55.849 --> 00:55:00.647\nWe took a look at Wireshark,\nand NetworkMiner were two\n\n1000\n00:55:00.647 --> 00:55:05.900\nthings I really wanted to work\nin here to show you that.\n\n1001\n00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:10.070\nAnd we talk about the concepts with it, so\nI think we cover quite a bit of ground.\n\n1002\n00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:11.261\nI think we're doing good.\n\n1003\n00:55:11.261 --> 00:55:12.380\n>> Very good.\nAll right.\n\n1004\n00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.680\nWell, ladies and\ngentlemen thanks again for tuning in.\n\n1005\n00:55:14.680 -->

evening.\n\n4\n00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,760\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,810\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr Sean Oriyano.\n\n6\n00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,110\nHow are you doing today Sean?\n\n7\n00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,170\n>> Pretty good, how about you?\n\n8\n00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,600\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,270\nWe've got another episode lined up for\n\n10\n00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,470\nyou guys in our digital\nforensic investigator series.\n\n11\n00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,730\nAnd in this one,\nwe're gonna talking about wireless.\n\n12\n00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,030\nIn particular,\ninvestigating wireless attacks.\n\n13\n00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,585\nSo, good times for all right?\n\n14\n00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:58,200\n[LAUGH].\n>> I would hope so.\n\n15\n00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,780\nThat's actually one of the really\nkind of fun areas to take a look at.\n\n16\n00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,320\n>> It is.\nIt opens up a hole in our previous\n\n17\n00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:04,830\nepisodes.\n\n18\n00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,720\nWe've talked a lot about different\ninvestigation strategies,\n\n19\n00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,290\nand things like that.\n\n20\n00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,370\nWireless really does open up a whole\nnew area that we gotta focus on.\n\n21\n00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,730\nA lot of things are gonna be different,\nabout how we capture it,\n\n22\n00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,940\nand what we need, as far as legally,\nand things like that.\n\n23\n00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,210\nSo let's start off, Sean,\nwith a brief review about,\n\n24\n00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,540\nwhen we talk about wireless technologies.\n\n25\n00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,760\nI know at this point most of\nyou are familiar with this,\n\n26\n00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,930\nbut let's review just to make sure,\nall right?\n\n27\n00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,910\n>> Yeah, it's important to do a little\nreview here to understand where wireless\n\n28\n00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,060\nfits in.\n\n29\n00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,470\nWireless is such a big\npart of the landscape now.\n\n30\n00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,573\nIt's all over the place.\n\n31\n00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:45,450\nI mean where isn't wireless now?\n\n32\n00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:45,960\n>> Right.\n\n33\n00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,690\nI mean you go to McDonald's and\nyou can hook up to their WiFi, right?\n\n34\n00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:55,160\n>> Yeah, it's in your car, or it's in\nthe plane, airport, home, the business.\n\n35\n00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,130\nLike you said, McDonald's, Starbucks.\n\n36\n00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,830\nWherever you are, it's pretty much there.\n\n37\n00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,820\nI'm sure I'd be out in the middle\nof a national part and\n\n38\n00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,740\nI'd get a signal at this point.\n\n39\n00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,740\nIt's sorta like that.\n\n40\n00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,160\n>> I used to laugh at some\nof these commercials.\n\n41\n00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,630\nLike, these credit card companies,\n\n42\n00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:13,570\nyou got this woman walking down this\nserene beach with nobody around, and\n\n43\n00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,420\nshe's like doing her billpay or checking\non her credit card or something like this.\n\n44\n00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,990\nAnd I'm like there's no\nwireless network out there.\n\n45\n00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,430\nI mean come on,\nhow stupid do you think we are?\n\n46\n00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,790\nBut no, they're everywhere.\n\n47\n00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,070\n>> The landscape has changed\ndramatically in that respect\n\n48\n00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,140\n>> If you look at the palm\n\n49\n00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,280\ntree on the side\n>> Side you'll see\n\n50\n00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,840\nthe little access point sitting up there.\n\n51\n00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,740\n[LAUGH] So they are everywhere,\nit's a very common way for\n\n52\n00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,260\npeople to connect with all their\nmobile devices, with their laptops,\n\n53\n00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,264\neven sitting at work, where it used to be,\nI'm on my wired computer at work,\n\n54\n00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:47,180\nnowadays people are bringing their own\ndevices and they're connecting wirelessly.\n\n55\n00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,000\nSo it's something we're\ndefinitely gonna run into.\n\n56\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,230\n>> Then you start throwing stuff like\nBluetooth into the mix and then there\n\n57\n00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,430\nare other wireless standards out there\nas well, like NFC and all those ones.\n\n58\n00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,490\nThere's so\nmany different shades of wireless that\n\n59\n00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,030\nit's something that you're gonna have\nto deal with as a forensic tech.\n\n60\n00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,880\nNow, while you may be familiar to\nvarying degrees with wireless,\n\n61\n00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,220\nit is a different approach here for\nthe forensic side as you may expect.\n\n62\n00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,600\nIn fact,\nit could be radically different and\n\n63\n00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,260\nthere's things here that\nyou just may not expect.\n\n64\n00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,180\nSome of the things, when I got into\nwireless on the forensic side of\n\n65\n00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,230\nthe house, some of the things that were\njust kind of surprising to me are things I\n\n66\n00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,830\nhadn't thought of, so I had to,\nyou know, I knew the standards,\n\n67\n00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,898\nnow I had to incorporate another\nlevel of thinking in there.\n\n68\n00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:41,990\nWhich we're gonna impart on you, but\n\n69\n00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:47,470\nI guarantee you'll be surprised at\nthe stuff you have to consider now and\n\n70\n00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,750\nyou'll be using the techniques that you\nlearned in the CEH if you did that course,\n\n71\n00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,080\nbut you'll also be building\na lot on top of that.\n\n72\n00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,380\n>> Sweet, I'm excited already.\n\n73\n00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,386\nI can't wait to dive into this stuff.\n\n74\n00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:05,370\nAll right, so again, starting off\nwith our 802.11, our IEEE standard.\n\n75\n00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,600\nAnd we need to be familiar with that\nbecause there's different technologies and\n\n76\n00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,350\nthey're not all compatible.\n\n77\n00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:10,920\n>> Yeah.\n\n78\n00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,360\nThere's a whole alphabet\nsoup of standards out there.\n\n79\n00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,490\nYou've got A, B, G, N, AC.\n\n80\n00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,780\nIt's out there.\n\n81\n00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,970\nAnd there's other standards out there too.\n\n82\n00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,520\nBut they don't really come into play\ntoo much for what we're getting into.\n\n83\n00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,170\nYeah, there's 2.11i,\nwhich is a security standard.\n\n84\n00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,420\nAnd there's some other ones that have\nbeen folded into some of the stuff we're\n\n85\n00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,110\ntalking about.\n\n86\n00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,450\nBut we're just talking about the ones\nthat actually beam a signal out for\n\n87\n00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,990\nwhat we're talking about here\nif you're kinda wondering\n\n88\n00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,320\nthe approach that we're adopting.\n\n89\n00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600\n>> Cuz it's gonna important, right?\n\n90\n00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,460\nIf I'm trying to investigate and\nat the scene, they're using 802.11n.\n\n91\n00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,840\nI've gotta have an adapter\nthat's compatible with that.\n\n92\n00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,570\nIf they're doing a, that's different,\nthat's not compatible, five gigahertz.\n\n93\n00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,760\nSo we've gotta make sure that\nwe have the right standard or\n\n94\n00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,260\nthe equipment to connect\nto the different networks.\n\n95\n00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,040\n>> Yes, not only do you have to consider\nthat you have the correct equipment,\n\n96\n00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,550\nthat's obviously a big part of it when\nyou're purchasing your equipment cuz\n\n97\n00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,410\nit's very easy to purchase that might miss\n\n98\n00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,100\none of the frequencies as it's\nnot dialed into that frequency.\n\n99\n00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,237\nIt's just not gonna pick it up.\n\n100\n00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,945\nAnd if can't see it, can't investigate it,\nand that could be some evidence just\n\n101\n00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:28,065\nwaving bye bye to you,\njust disappearing over the horizon.\n\n102\n00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:33,295\nYeah you wanna avoid that\nwhenever possible so,\n\n103\n00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:35,735\nthat's one thing you gotta\nknow about the standards.\n\n104\n00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,585\nThe other, the other thing that's\nimportant to know about the standards is,\n\n105\n00:05:39,585 --> 00:05:42,255\nwhat makes them different,\nbecause from a forensic standpoint,\n\n106\n00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:44,640\nknowing the capability of these things.\n\n107\n00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,410\nAnd how they impact and\ninteract with their environment\n\n108\n00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,870\ncan go a long way towards steering\nyour investigation or what\n\n109\n00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,800\nyou reason out the way things might be\nworking, now that's a very, very big deal.\n\n110\n00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,760\n>> Okay.\nAll right.\n\n111\n00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,830\nSo, shall we go through the different\nones like 802.11a for example.\n\n112\n00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,810\nWell, five gigahertz as\nfar as the frequency goes,\n\n113\n00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,870\nabout 60 feet on the range or so?\n\n114\n00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,870\n>> Yeah, more or less.\n\n115\n00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,140\nThe range isn't as long as the other ones.\n\n116\n00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,610\nThe big thing about that is yes,\nit is five gigahertz.\n\n117\n00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,860\nAnd that has some significant\nimpacts to us with five gigahertz.\n\n118\n00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,270\nYou'll get a cleaner signal,\nbecause there's not a lot\n\n119\n00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,170\nworking in that frequency range even now\ncompared to the other ones at least.\n\n120\n00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,200\nBut the big thing about it is,\nis that once it starts hitting\n\n121\n00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,740\nthings in the environment,\nit tends not to propagate that much.\n\n122\n00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:46,800\nIt hits walls, it hits really any\ntype of thing in the area it tends\n\n123\n00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,090\nto lose kind of momentum if you\nwant to put it in those terms.\n\n124\n00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,450\n>> That big fancy term, Attenuate.\n\n125\n00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,290\nAll wireless signals attenuate meaning\nthey get weaker and weaker as they go out.\n\n126\n00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,370\nAnd these high frequencies being\n\n127\n00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,270\na measurement of how many\ncycles per second, right?.\n\n128\n00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,750\nHigh frequency you can imagine\na graph that's got much more up and\n\n129\n00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,120\ndowns in it than a low frequency\nis not as frequent per second.\n\n130\n00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,530\nAnd those high frequencies,\nthey don't pass through objects as well.\n\n131\n00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,010\nWhere as low frequencies,\nthink about bass music, right?\n\n132\n00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,470\nYou can always hear that\nbass coming down the street.\n\n133\n00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,190\nYou might not hear that treble but\nyou hear that bass.\n\n134\n00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,430\nCause the bass that low frequency.\n\n135\n00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,680\nOr I think of like elephants and\nwhales when they make those noises.\n\n136\n00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000\nThat's how I remember it in my brain.\n\n137\n00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,480\nLow frequencies travel much further\nthey don't attenuate as fast.\n\n138\n00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,303\nHigh frequencies we can get more data\non there, they could be faster, but\n\n139\n00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:40,408\nthe signal doesn't propagate as well.\n\n140\n00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:41,190\n>> Yes.\n\n141\n00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,917\nAnd that's the big thing.\n\n142\n00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:47,060\nIf you're doing an investigation,\nif you're way on the other side of\n\n143\n00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:53,338\nthe building and you're investigating a\nnetwork or that's somewhere into the mix,\n\n144\n00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:59,029\nthen you pretty much got an idea that\nthat access point is gotta be somewhere.\n\n145\n00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,585\nThe nearby area.\n\n146\n00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:06,220\nIt's gonna be a long distance\naway because it just can't be.\n\n147\n00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,390\nAnd that's excluding antennas and\nstuff like that.\n\n148\n00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,760\nWe haven't talked about bringing\nin anything that boosts a signal,\n\n149\n00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,570\njust talking plain right out of the box,\nit's not gonna go that far.\n\n150\n00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,450\nSo that's definitely something\nthat is gonna guide which way\n\n151\n00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,170\nyou go from that point.\n\n152\n00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,755\n>> And if we follow our alphabet\nsoup up the chain there,\n\n153\n00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:29,810\n802.11b is another standard\nput out by the I triple E.\n\n154\n00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,480\nOne of the most common ones\nway back in the day, right?\n\n155\n00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,670\nThis is where I think a lot of us,\n\n156\n00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,730\nif you've been in this business for\na little while.\n\n157\n00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,690\nB was one of the first\nones we saw in the home.\n\n158\n00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,530\nIn the small offices,\ncuz the A equipment was really expensive,\n\n159\n00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,240\nwe didn't have that range, and\nwireless was relatively new at the time.\n\n160\n00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,750\nB caught on pretty quick.\n\n161\n00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,030\n>> Yeah,\nA actually proved popular with businesses,\n\n162\n00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,435\nnot only could they afford the price tag.\n\n163\n00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:57,145\nBut their were some good\nsecurity benefits for it.\n\n164\n00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:59,155\nMainly the stuff we just talked about.\n\n165\n00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:02,255\nIt didn't penetrate too far\noutside of a specific area.\n\n166\n00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:08,010\nSo that was an attractive side effect\nof that whole frequency issue.\n\n167\n00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,760\nBut B, yeah, was the one that\nreally caught attention of\n\n168\n00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,180\nthe public because it was marketed much,\nmuch better.\n\n169\n00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,570\nAnd it just had more benefits\nthat the home user would want.\n\n170\n00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:28,260\nAnd so it just made its way out into the\nworld and you saw it all over the place.\n\n171\n00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,790\nAnd it definitely has benefits of it.\n\n172\n00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:35,780\nThere's the frequency kind of co mingles\nwith a lot of other things in that range.\n\n173\n00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,070\n>> Cuz it drop down to 2.4 gigahertz for\nour B.\n\n174\n00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,930\nYeah, but as you say, there was a lot\nof other things that already existed in\n\n175\n00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,960\nthat frequency range and then it ended\nup with our signal like microwaves,\n\n176\n00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,800\ncordless telephones were big at the time,\na lot of those ran at that 2.4GHz range.\n\n177\n00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,860\n>> Yeah,\nthere's a lot of stuff in that range.\n\n178\n00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,560\nEven now, we have some of\nthe older stuff interfering with,\n\n179\n00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,570\nit's gone, but\nwe're very limited on where we see it.\n\n180\n00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,690\nBut, there's newer stuff that also\nruns on that frequency cuz of the way,\n\n181\n00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,250\nit's not a licensed ban.\n\n182\n00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,400\nHere in the U.S. it's not a license ban.\n\n183\n00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,330\nSo it means that you can\nput a lot of stuff on that.\n\n184\n00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,440\nAnd so you get Bluetooth,\nyou get game controllers, microwaves.\n\n185\n00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,833\nI've known people who've popped\npopcorn and turned on the microwave.\n\n186\n00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,332\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And bumped a network offline.\n\n187\n00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:29,390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Under the right conditions you can\n\n188\n00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,915\ndo that.\n\n189\n00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:31,790\n>> Right.\n\n190\n00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,040\n>> So, you never know.\n\n191\n00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,010\nWith that band, that's why you won't get\nthose high performances out of it ever.\n\n192\n00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,260\nThat's why the range will never\nbe what they say on the box,\n\n193\n00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,970\nor that's a contributing factors to those-\n>> 300 feet or\n\n194\n00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,630\nsomething like that is what they\nwere saying you were gonna get.\n\n195\n00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,210\nWell, yeah.\nIn an ideal world, inside a big\n\n196\n00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,090\nwarehouse or out in the middle of\nthe ocean where you got no obstacles,\n\n197\n00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,660\nno nothing,\nyou might get 300 some odd feet.\n\n198\n00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,290\n>> Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n199\n00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,270\nIf you're lucky.\n\n200\n00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,210\nMore than likely they came up with\nthose numbers in a test chamber.\n\n201\n00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,730\nYou know, special radio isolated test\nchambers where there's nothing else to\n\n202\n00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,940\nmess with it.\n\n203\n00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,260\nBecause even if you're out\nin the middle of nowhere,\n\n204\n00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,830\nyou got the air density, and pollutants\nall in the air that could impact.\n\n205\n00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,120\nAnd even air temperature will\nimpact the range of a signal.\n\n206\n00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,610\nAmazingly enough, so,\nif you get into wireless,\n\n207\n00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,490\nthis is actually If you like those\nsorts of things its actually really\n\n208\n00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,160\nkind of fascinating some of the stuff\nthat can impact it, it really is.\n\n209\n00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,410\n>> And then those two were incompatible\nbecause they were different frequencies.\n\n210\n00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,544\nSo I couldn't have, you know,\nif I had a [??] B today,\n\n211\n00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:45,130\nwe know we have multi cards\nthat do multiple protocols.\n\n212\n00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,690\nBut if we're talking about\na single protocol per card,\n\n213\n00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,040\nif I have a B card I cannot\naccess to a A access point.\n\n214\n00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,669\nOr if I have an A card,\na card that supports 802.11a I can not\n\n215\n00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:00,710\nconnect to a 802.11B access point.\n\n216\n00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,792\n>> Yes that's one big important factor,\nyour not on the same frequency\n\n217\n00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:11,600\nyou can't even talk to one another if\nyou're not on that same frequency.\n\n218\n00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,440\nThere's other factors in there but that\nwould be the big one between these two.\n\n219\n00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,231\nThere's other differences in there but,\nthough you're not even on the same page to\n\n220\n00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:25,632\nstart, you don't even have to go on any\nother ones, with these two at least.\n\n221\n00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:29,404\n>> All right,\nthen we keep going up our alphabet soup,\n\n222\n00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:33,947\nwe got 802.11G came out, and\nthat was kind of a neat one,\n\n223\n00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:38,921\nbecause it really started to combine\nsome of the best features of A and\n\n224\n00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:42,890\nB into one protocol\n>> Yes, that was the big thing,\n\n225\n00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,450\nwe had the speed, you had the range,\nso those were a couple of really\n\n226\n00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,910\nbig things about it, and then of course\nit's backwards compatible with b, so\n\n227\n00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,920\nthat was immediate selling point.\n\n228\n00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,800\n>> Yeah, so and remember so g works at\nthe 2.4 gigahertz range just like b did,\n\n229\n00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,510\nwhich meant if I all ready had a b,\nlike I said,\n\n230\n00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,658\nI had a laptop in there that\nsupported 802.11b, if I went out and\n\n231\n00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:11,040\ngot an 802.11g access point, I didn't\nhave to upgrade my laptop right away and\n\n232\n00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,660\nI could still connect to it because\nit was using that same frequency.\n\n233\n00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,750\n>> Yes, yeah.\n\n234\n00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:22,890\nThat was the really big selling point and\nthat's why you saw G networks come\n\n235\n00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:28,210\nout as quickly as they did because people\nimmediately saw I can get this without\n\n236\n00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:34,200\nhaving to get rid of all my old stuff that\nhad acquired over there over the past bit.\n\n237\n00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,400\n>> That confused me, like I knew that slow\nupgrade as I go through my office building\n\n238\n00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,050\nor what have you without cutting\nanybody completely out of the picture.\n\n239\n00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,000\nAnd we got the better.\n\n240\n00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,870\nWe got the range,\nwe got the range from B, basically.\n\n241\n00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,580\nYou know, we got around 300\nfeet is what they'll plane.\n\n242\n00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,910\nAnd then we got the speed, so close to A.\n\n243\n00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,530\nWe got that 54 megabits per second.\n\n244\n00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,980\nB, I don't think we mentioned,\nwas somewhere around 11 or\n\n245\n00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,750\n12 megabits per second,\nit was a little slow, so\n\n246\n00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,190\nnow we've got the range we liked from\nthe 802.11b, and we get the speed\n\n247\n00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:11,660\nwe liked from that 802.11a, and it was\nbackwards compatible, so whoo, I love it.\n\n248\n00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,450\n>> Yeah, so\nthat was a big big improvement.\n\n249\n00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,210\nThere were somethings that\npeople weren't prepared for.\n\n250\n00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:23,410\nI still remember the stories of people\ndropping an A to 11G access point and\n\n251\n00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:28,850\nthey still had B on their laptop or\ndesktop or what have you.\n\n252\n00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,880\nThey were wondering why\nthey were at this point.\n\n253\n00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,500\nSo 54 megabytes, and\nthis said eleven megabytes and\n\n254\n00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,370\nthey weren't' getting that faster speed.\n\n255\n00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,786\nIt's always gonna work at the speed\nof the slowest one in there.\n\n256\n00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:41,160\nYou know it's-\n>> It always bummed me out you're sitting\n\n257\n00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,050\nthere getting great speeds\nfrom your access point.\n\n258\n00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,860\nYou're like woo man I'm loving this G and\nthen Joe walks in with his old laptop and\n\n259\n00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,745\nhis b adaptor and\nthe whole network just goes woo.\n\n260\n00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:51,520\n>> Yeah.\n\n261\n00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,160\nYeah it would just start tanking so that\nwas a big disappointment to some people.\n\n262\n00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,070\nYou know, they weren't prepared for that.\n\n263\n00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,520\nBut fortunately it wasn't\ntoo difficult to upgrade.\n\n264\n00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,520\nI mean, if that really was a problem,\nyou had a built in V adapter.\n\n265\n00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:13,800\nJust go get a USB G adapter and plug it\nin and you would get around that problem.\n\n266\n00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,550\n>> Just turn his adapter off, and say\nyou can't connect our wireless network.\n\n267\n00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,760\n>> Yeah, connect to the neighbors.\n\n268\n00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,870\n>> We have all different types of adapters\nthat we can plug into the different\n\n269\n00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,590\nports which, again, just gave us that\nflexibility and the ability to grow.\n\n270\n00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,340\nSo.\n\n271\n00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,402\nWe also have 802.11n,\nwhich is another good one.\n\n272\n00:15:33,402 --> 00:15:35,048\n>> Yeah.\n\n273\n00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:39,850\nAnd is still fairly new\nin the scheme of things.\n\n274\n00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,280\nI mean, it's been out for awhile, but\nit's still fairly new, we consider it.\n\n275\n00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,760\nIt is 2.4 and 5.\n\n276\n00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,900\nIt runs at a faster frequency than it.\n\n277\n00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,878\nBut let's look at, though,\nthe 2.4 and the 5.\n\n278\n00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:55,204\nThis brings up the other issues,\n\n279\n00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,201\nthat N is backwards compatible with G and\nB, no problem.\n\n280\n00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:03,194\nBut, and you look at the other part,\nthe five gigahertz with the A.\n\n281\n00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:09,428\nOne of the issues that you have also with\nbackwards compatibility, that the N,G,\n\n282\n00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:15,850\nand B have that we have an issue with on A\nand N is also how the signal's modulated.\n\n283\n00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,865\nAnd that can also be a big barrier.\n\n284\n00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:18,425\nYear or two.\n\n285\n00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:23,345\n>> Even though N was operating at 5GHz,\nit was not backwards compatible with\n\n286\n00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:28,485\nA because it was slightly different in\nthe way A modulated that information.\n\n287\n00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:31,515\n>> Yeah, and that's a bit of an issue,\n\n288\n00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:37,310\nso some of those A people\nbasically got orphaned you know.\n\n289\n00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,655\n>> When it comes to early\nadapters I tell you it sucks.\n\n290\n00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:46,620\n>> Yeah you could still get A stuff if you\nreally look hard you can still get it.\n\n291\n00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,180\nBut.\n\n292\n00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,480\n>> And there really is some advantages.\n\n293\n00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,990\nAs just you were saying that people laugh.\n\n294\n00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,280\nBut sometimes it's tough with these\nnewer wireless protocols to contain\n\n295\n00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,260\nthat signal within my building, and\n\n296\n00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,280\nI don't wanna cover the office next to me,\nor the parking lot, or what have you.\n\n297\n00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,120\nAnd so I.\n\n298\n00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,230\nBy using one of those limited\nfrequencies like that,\n\n299\n00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,310\nit does make it a little easier.\n\n300\n00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,510\nBut compatibility wise,\nit can become an issue.\n\n301\n00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,310\nAlthough, I tell you most modern network\nadapters and most modern laptops,\n\n302\n00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,000\nyou'll see the whole alphabet soup\nright there across a network adapter.\n\n303\n00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,380\nRight?\nA slash B slash G slash N.\n\n304\n00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,050\nYeah.\n>> And so\n\n305\n00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,450\na lot of them do support\nall of these things.\n\n306\n00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,590\n>> And that's an important detail.\n\n307\n00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,880\nAgain, just to emphasize that.\n\n308\n00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,910\nIf you're gonna be doing\nan analysis on any of this stuff,\n\n309\n00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,180\nwhich you will be, you just will be,\nit's part of the world now.\n\n310\n00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,680\nIf you're not prepared to do this,\nthat's gonna be an issue.\n\n311\n00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,900\nA big barrier towards doing\na proper investigation.\n\n312\n00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,760\nSo make sure that you not only know it,\n\n313\n00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,830\nbut your equipment is compatible\nwith all the current standards.\n\n314\n00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,410\nAnd maybe even the stuff\nthat's just over the horizon,\n\n315\n00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,100\nwhich sometimes you have to\nget bleeding edge with that.\n\n316\n00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,472\nBut that's the nature of the game for us,\nbecause someone else might be using that,\n\n317\n00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:58,146\ntoo, so we have to be prepared.\n\n318\n00:17:58,146 --> 00:17:59,440\n>> That's a good point.\n\n319\n00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,388\nI don't have an AC device, but I might end\nup investigating a scene where they were\n\n320\n00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:08,204\nusing AC, so I really need to\nhave all of my options available.\n\n321\n00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:10,049\n>> Yes.\n\n322\n00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:13,382\nWhen you're buying your equipment,\ndo remember that.\n\n323\n00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:15,730\nIt's gonna be an extra expense, and\n\n324\n00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,050\nextra things you've got to keep in your\ntool kit But that's part of the game.\n\n325\n00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,250\nThat's definitely part of the game.\n\n326\n00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,260\n>> More toys.\n\n327\n00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,680\nMore toys is always a good thing.\n\n328\n00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,240\n>> Yeah.\n\n329\n00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,854\n>> Not good for my budget,\nbut it's a good for me.\n\n330\n00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,394\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n331\n00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:30,117\n[LAUGH] Always downsize.\n\n332\n00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:32,660\n>> So Anne ran a 2.4n5 gigahurtz and\n\n333\n00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,060\nit gave us I can't remember what the speed\n>> speeds were quoted on end 300,\n\n334\n00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,360\nwas it that fast?\n\n335\n00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,490\n>> Yeah, if you use the memo,\nI think, that's what it was.\n\n336\n00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,350\nEnd's always the one that got me,\n\n337\n00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,270\nbecause they had all these numbers\nquoted on speeds and stuff like that.\n\n338\n00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,840\n>> And it really depended,\ndid you turn off 2.4 and leave five only,\n\n339\n00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,940\nwere you running both,\nwere you running memo, did you.\n\n340\n00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,720\nThe device support BEMO,\nso it's really hard to\n\n341\n00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,760\nfind someone who will quote you a speed or\neven a range, because it varies.\n\n342\n00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,750\nIt's not set in stone like\nit was with B and with G.\n\n343\n00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,940\n>> Yeah, they'd always say\n>> They would put speeds in there,\n\n344\n00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,400\nit was kind of like you could get up to\nthat, you probably were never going to get\n\n345\n00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,860\neven close to that, but\nit was like up to that, you know.\n\n346\n00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,770\n>> It's like my car.\n\n347\n00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,680\nUp to 22 miles per gallon.\n\n348\n00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,900\nYeah, if I drive ten miles an hour.\n\n349\n00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,970\nDown I-10 for the next 200 miles maybe.\n\n350\n00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,080\n>> Yeah, you might do that.\n\n351\n00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,320\nBut of course if you're not\nreading that the right way.\n\n352\n00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,640\nYou know if it says up to 300 megabytes,\nyou say I'm getting 300 megabytes.\n\n353\n00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,390\nNo, you say,\nyou see that stuff before that.\n\n354\n00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,290\nIt says up to.\n\n355\n00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,270\n>> If you sit your laptop on\ntop of the access point, maybe.\n\n356\n00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,630\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] As we get in, and\n\n357\n00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,550\nthen the new one that's out,\nAC, a relatively new one.\n\n358\n00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,050\n>> Yeah.\n\n359\n00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,770\n>> Hasn't caught on as\nmuch I don't think yet,\n\n360\n00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,710\nthe prices are still a little high,\nfor me personally but.\n\n361\n00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,050\n>> Yeah, they are kinda high just\nacross the board for stuff but\n\n362\n00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,920\nthey do offer some interesting things.\n\n363\n00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,080\nThey do offer improved speed and\nimproved range.\n\n364\n00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,500\n>> And better reliability.\n\n365\n00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,140\nThey use technology\nsuch as beam forming to\n\n366\n00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,500\nget the signal more focused\non a specific client.\n\n367\n00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,615\nIt's pretty neat but yeah,\nthe access points are, yeah, they're.\n\n368\n00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,420\n>> [LAUGH] But I tell you,\n\n369\n00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,270\nif you want some fascinating reading,\nif you're geeks like us and\n\n370\n00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,210\nyou wanna get into that, look into some of\nthat technology, that beam forming where\n\n371\n00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,520\nthe access point can say oh, wait\n>> The laptop that's connecting to me is\n\n372\n00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,160\nout that way.\n\n373\n00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,740\nI'm gonna focus my energy over there.\n\n374\n00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,810\nYeah, that's an intelligent access point,\nwhich is why we pay more.\n\n375\n00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,560\nBut from the investigator's\nside of things,\n\n376\n00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,860\nwe still have to have that\ntechnology because we.\n\n377\n00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,180\nWe need to be able to connect to those\ntypes of access points or devices.\n\n378\n00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,760\n>> Yeah, it's gonna be part of the mix.\n\n379\n00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,030\nYou're gonna have to have that,\nbecause they are showing up and\n\n380\n00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,560\nif I was gonna be on the dark side\nof this, let's put it that way.\n\n381\n00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,230\nI wouldn't be a little bit against even at\nall about plugging in an AC adapter into\n\n382\n00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:06,220\nthe back of a system inside a company and\nusing one on my notebook to attach to it.\n\n383\n00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,260\nDoing a peer to peer network type thing,\nor what they call an Ad-Hoc When\n\n384\n00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,660\neverything gets doing that, because I know\nyou probably, there's a brief period right\n\n385\n00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,070\nnow where not a lot of people listening\nin on that and paying attention to that.\n\n386\n00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:24,370\nSo if you were using one of your\nsurvey tools to pick that up or\n\n387\n00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,960\nto detect wireless,\nyou're maybe not picking up AC, so.\n\n388\n00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,750\n>> You might miss it altogether and\nnot even see it's there, so\n\n389\n00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,510\nyeah, it could be a very good choice for\nthe bad guy.\n\n390\n00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,610\nWhich means that it needs\nto be in our toolkit,\n\n391\n00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,830\nbecause we're investigating the bad guy.\n\n392\n00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,660\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n393\n00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,160\nYou should take the time to\nmake yourself aware of it.\n\n394\n00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,870\nRead up on the standard, and\n\n395\n00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,820\nbe prepared to add the equipment to your\ntoolkit, because you're gonna have to.\n\n396\n00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,170\n>> All right.\nSo, lots of different wireless\n\n397\n00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,910\ntechnologies that we need to be aware of.\n\n398\n00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,160\nWe need to make sure we have\nthe capability to perform a thorough and\n\n399\n00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,660\na complete investigation.\n\n400\n00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,320\nMeaning we need to be able to connect\nall of those different protocols.\n\n401\n00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,450\nYou need to understand them.\n\n402\n00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,650\nYou need to be able to work with them.\n\n403\n00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,950\n>> You need to be able to dissect them.\n\n404\n00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,340\nTalk them backwards and forwards.\n\n405\n00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,500\nEverything you know.\n\n406\n00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,120\nUnderstand just how they interact.\n\n407\n00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,665\nYou should get your hands on\nthe equipment, if you have it already,\n\n408\n00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:22,791\nwhich, a lot of people\ndo have nowadays have.\n\n409\n00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,163\nIt seems like everyone's\nplayed with an access point,\n\n410\n00:22:25,163 --> 00:22:28,144\nat least the consumer grade one maybe\nthe enterprise ones not so much.\n\n411\n00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:33,321\nBut for what were looking at, at least\nat this level It doesn't really matter,\n\n412\n00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:36,258\nif you're talking consumer or enterprise,\n\n413\n00:22:36,258 --> 00:22:40,683\nit's just as long as you have\nexperience getting your hands dirty.\n\n414\n00:22:40,683 --> 00:22:43,954\nAnd tuning it and\nseeing how to detect it, and\n\n415\n00:22:43,954 --> 00:22:48,691\ntesting your different tools out to\nsee what the impacts of it are I\n\n416\n00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:52,880\nmean get used to stuff like\nwhat the atmosphere does.\n\n417\n00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,880\nYou may be surprised to learn\nthat when air gets denser or\n\n418\n00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,000\ndecreases in density either way,\nit will affect the range of that signal.\n\n419\n00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,190\nThere's less molecules in the air.\n\n420\n00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:11,490\nLess density of molecules of air to\nactually pass that signal back and forth.\n\n421\n00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,740\nAnd then you start talking\nstuff in the environment.\n\n422\n00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,360\nIf you have a storage shed that has\none of those corrugated metal roofs,\n\n423\n00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,940\nthat is gonna send your\nsignal all over the place.\n\n424\n00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,120\nThen there are things you may not expect.\n\n425\n00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,350\nOne of the things I mentioned\nin the CEH course was.\n\n426\n00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,460\nLike a pine trees, with pine needles.\n\n427\n00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,800\nThose things have a high water content.\n\n428\n00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,870\nIf you got those things, those things\nwill act as a barrier as well.\n\n429\n00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:39,180\nRadio signals do not go\nthrough water all that well.\n\n430\n00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:43,575\nSo there's a tremendous amount\nof things that could impact it.\n\n431\n00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:48,635\nYou just have to be aware of it and\nthe construction and area around it.\n\n432\n00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:54,955\nI even, I know of,\nI have a facility that I go to and\n\n433\n00:23:54,955 --> 00:24:01,297\nin Sacramento that it's\njust a office building.\n\n434\n00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:05,731\nIt looks like that and it was and\nis an office building.\n\n435\n00:24:05,731 --> 00:24:08,495\nBut, it's a re purposed building.\n\n436\n00:24:08,495 --> 00:24:10,654\nAnd this is where you get to learn\ncertain things about wireless.\n\n437\n00:24:10,654 --> 00:24:13,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That building was repurposed.\n\n438\n00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,559\nIf you walk in there with a cell phone or\nany wireless device,\n\n439\n00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,973\nyour signal quickly just starts\ngoing [SOUND] down really quickly.\n\n440\n00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:28,812\nYou walk out of the lobby of that\nbuilding and go past the front doors or\n\n441\n00:24:28,812 --> 00:24:32,790\nout of the lobby,\ninto the back part of the area.\n\n442\n00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,140\nThe wireless that they\nhave in the lobby just\n\n443\n00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,420\ndisappears basically once\nyou've passed that wall.\n\n444\n00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,910\nAnd, they didn't do anything\nspecial to do that, so\n\n445\n00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,650\nyou're getting to learn that cell\nphone signals don't go that far,\n\n446\n00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,220\nwireless signals,\nno matter what provider you're with.\n\n447\n00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,420\nYou might get a little bit of a signal\nof one provider and then get nothing.\n\n448\n00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,460\nYou usually get crackling.\n\n449\n00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,930\nYou'll see people near the walls trying\nto look for a signal and all that.\n\n450\n00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,570\n>> You'll see them sitting on\nthe window sill trying to call home or\n\n451\n00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,110\nsomething like that.\n\n452\n00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,170\n>> They look like they're scanning for\n\n453\n00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,780\nlife forms because they're all walking\naround the buildings like this and\n\n454\n00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,880\ntrying to find stuff.\n\n455\n00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,170\n>> What is it about the building\nthen that makes it such a dead zone?\n\n456\n00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,930\n>> It was a former medical facility,\nso they had shielding and\n\n457\n00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,350\nstuff like that and heavier construction\nand that impedes the signal dramatically.\n\n458\n00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:25,370\nNot to mention the whole thing's\ncapped off by a nice copper roof.\n\n459\n00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:31,580\nSo they've got a very,\nvery crude Faraday cage working there.\n\n460\n00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,770\nSo it creates a big, big dead zone.\n\n461\n00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:40,400\nAnd it's It's pretty funny to see when\nsomeone new goes into that facility and\n\n462\n00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,640\nthey're talking, and\n[INAUDIBLE] and it just goes out.\n\n463\n00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,360\nAnd they go hello, hello, and\n\n464\n00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,110\nyou know exactly what's happened because\nyou've experienced that as well.\n\n465\n00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,600\n>> They're sitting in a lobby,\nplaying a game, watching these\n\n466\n00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,080\nvisitors walk in on their phone and\nright as they go through that door.\n\n467\n00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,210\nWait, what happened?\n\n468\n00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:00,390\n>> Yeah, they're just not prepared for\nit because it's not common to have\n\n469\n00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,500\nthat complete of a dead\nzone is not that common.\n\n470\n00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,305\nBut if you know the area, and\nthe history that facility was,\n\n471\n00:26:10,305 --> 00:26:13,945\nor heck, you can even ask the people\nare current tenants of that going yeah,\n\n472\n00:26:13,945 --> 00:26:19,455\nwe've got it from someone that\nhad a big medical center in here.\n\n473\n00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:21,465\nOh, okay, that explains a lot.\n\n474\n00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:22,825\nAnd then you start looking at the roof and\n\n475\n00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:26,560\nrealize the construction all that\nis just working against you.\n\n476\n00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,655\nIt's an interesting, you know,\nlittle exercise to kind of go through.\n\n477\n00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:35,060\n>> [LAUGH] Really regretting\nmoving into that building?\n\n478\n00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,760\n>> You know, they're actually\nfine with it because it keeps\n\n479\n00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,615\nthem from sitting on their cell phones and\nall of that.\n\n480\n00:26:41,615 --> 00:26:43,370\n[LAUGH] You know, we all kind of.\n\n481\n00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,378\nShe's like where can i\nfind this contractor?\n\n482\n00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:48,990\n[LAUGH]\n>> No Facebook for those employees.\n\n483\n00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,940\n>> Yeah, it's pretty.\n\n484\n00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,240\nThey have customers come in, and\nthese customers that come in,\n\n485\n00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,710\nmaybe the customers don't like it.\n\n486\n00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,500\nBut, they can't stay as\nconnected as they'd like to be.\n\n487\n00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,280\nBut then again, it's really\nreally peaceful in there [LAUGH].\n\n488\n00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,480\nYou hear birds chirping and\nstuff like that.\n\n489\n00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,980\nYou know, and\nthat's just a construction thing.\n\n490\n00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,620\nSome buildings are even doing,\nthere's wallpaper and\n\n491\n00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,680\npaneling you can put up that\ncreates dead zones now, too.\n\n492\n00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,820\nAnd some businesses are putting those in\nplace because you can't use the jammers.\n\n493\n00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,860\nAt least over here in the States you can't\nuse the jammers because they're illegal.\n\n494\n00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:31,100\nBut you can put a passive type barrier,\nwhich is a paneling or a wallpaper.\n\n495\n00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,600\nAnd then there's stuff they\ncan put on windows that acts\n\n496\n00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,870\neffectively as a barrier.\n\n497\n00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,200\nYou walk in there, dead zone.\n\n498\n00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,730\nSo you know, pretty neat.\n\n499\n00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,670\n>> All right, well I tell you what.\n\n500\n00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,640\nLadies and gentlemen it's about time for\nus to take our break.\n\n501\n00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,040\nSo we covered all the different wireless\nprotocols, kind of a refresher for\n\n502\n00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,860\nmost of you I'm sure, but we've got to be\nfamiliar with these different technologies\n\n503\n00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,440\nso we can conduct a proper investigation.\n\n504\n00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,665\nSo, more coming up on wireless\nwhen we get back, so stay tuned.\n\n505\n00:27:55,665 --> 00:28:02,247\n[MUSIC]\n\n506\n00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,480\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n507\n00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,200\nSo next on our list, Sean, we're\ngoing to talk about wireless attacks.\n\n508\n00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,730\nAnd these can be pretty vicious, right?\n\n509\n00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,423\nWhen that wireless comes after you?\n\n510\n00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:15,715\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, you know it.\n\n511\n00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:19,410\n>> [LAUGH]\nSo wireless attacks, I mean,\n\n512\n00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,030\nin general you know there's a lot of\ndifferent things that can be exposed,\n\n513\n00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,940\nI guess, I don't know if that's\nthe right way to say it,\n\n514\n00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,750\nor different areas that we've got to think\nabout that wireless can be vulnerable in.\n\n515\n00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,920\n>> Yeah, there are a lot of angles\nthat someone could come at you,\n\n516\n00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,070\nthrough wireless.\n\n517\n00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,480\nThere are so many different possibilities.\n\n518\n00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,910\nSo, yes, a lot of this stuff was\ntalked about in the CH course,\n\n519\n00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:46,420\nbut we're going to review it to make\nsure that you are understanding\n\n520\n00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,170\nthe different types of attacks\nthat you may be investigating.\n\n521\n00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,350\nBut kind of put a spin on it for\nthe forensics side of things.\n\n522\n00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,460\nYou know, and then we're going to actually\nsee some of the tools that we had\n\n523\n00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,490\nseen during the CEH class but\nsee how we can apply them here, but, we've\n\n524\n00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,090\nkinda got to make sure we're all clear on\nthe same page with these attacks first.\n\n525\n00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,710\n>> And one of the first things\nwe want to deal with probably is\n\n526\n00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,720\nconfidentiality, right?\n\n527\n00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,230\nWe know that, especially some of\nour older wireless technologies,\n\n528\n00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,080\nthe encryption might\nnot have been the best.\n\n529\n00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,000\nAt the time it might have been okay,\n\n530\n00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,810\nit has since become something\nvery vulnerable, easily broken.\n\n531\n00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,300\n>> Which means people\ncan access that data.\n\n532\n00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,940\n>> Yes, that's been one of the problems\nwith it from the very start with wireless.\n\n533\n00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,700\nThey knew really early on you're beaming\nstuff all over the universe and back.\n\n534\n00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,690\nPeople can be in listening\nrange of that easily.\n\n535\n00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,810\nSo, you have that whole\nconfidentiality problem so\n\n536\n00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,510\nyou've got to encrypt your data and\ndo something to protect it.\n\n537\n00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:49,760\nYou know, so they invented all those\nstandards, the most notorious being WEP of\n\n538\n00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,320\ncourse, which we know from previously,\nor you know on your own,\n\n539\n00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:01,920\nit's just really incredibly poor as far as\nencryption and protection technologies go.\n\n540\n00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,390\nBut [CROSSTALK]\n>> It was like a quick easy fix.\n\n541\n00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,940\nWe know unbound media, my data is\njust floating out there in space and\n\n542\n00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,990\nanybody in range can pick up those packets\nand read that, so we needed something\n\n543\n00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:17,120\nto at least provide us a little bit of\nsecurity, WEP was what they came up with.\n\n544\n00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,770\nAnd it's obviously not all that strong,\nbut at the time it did its job,\n\n545\n00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:27,520\nit's just that computers are so powerful\nnow, and it's just too easy to break that,\n\n546\n00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,450\nbecause of the weak initialization vector\ngeneration and things like that, so\n\n547\n00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:38,610\nwe've got issues and it's not to say\nthat the web is not the only one.\n\n548\n00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,140\nThere's some issues with\nthe other ones as well.\n\n549\n00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,740\nBut confidentiality in general\ncan be a problem with wireless.\n\n550\n00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,970\n>> Yeah, it's been there,\nit's going to continue to be there for\n\n551\n00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,140\nnumerous reasons, not just web.\n\n552\n00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,370\nFortunately web for\nthe most part has been marginalized, so\n\n553\n00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:58,340\nmost people learn their lesson,\nor either learn their lesson or\n\n554\n00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:03,280\nhave got to the memo that this is not\na good idea to be using this anymore and\n\n555\n00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,630\nso they've moved away to other stuff.\n\n556\n00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,649\nit doesn't mean that there's not\nconfidentiality problems because we\n\n557\n00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:15,590\nhave things that people can do to\nmisconfigure the access point,\n\n558\n00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,590\nwhich is a very common one.\n\n559\n00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,640\nYou get people doing stuff they\nshouldn't be over an open access point.\n\n560\n00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,050\nYou cringe when you see people that\nare going to a public access point\n\n561\n00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,920\nsomeplace and they're checking account and\nstuff like that and\n\n562\n00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,090\nfiguring hey there's no problem with this.\n\n563\n00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,290\nLet's just go ahead and\nI can get on the internet.\n\n564\n00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,610\nThis isn't any issue whatsoever, so.\n\n565\n00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,570\n>> Doing their bill pays or\nordering product from Amazon right across\n\n566\n00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,050\nthe wireless ac- or an open access\npoint to punch in credit card numbers.\n\n567\n00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,240\n>> Yeah,\nthere's just no care in the world.\n\n568\n00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,410\nThey just figure, people are trained now,\n\n569\n00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,210\nyou see a web page you're\nonline fine go ahead and do it.\n\n570\n00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:57,810\nYou can see it.\n\n571\n00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,541\nGo ahead and do it it must be okay there's\nstill a number of people that think that\n\n572\n00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:04,342\nway they don't think of\nthe context they're actually in.\n\n573\n00:32:04,342 --> 00:32:07,973\nThey don't think of maybe this isn't\na good idea to do it Starbucks, or\n\n574\n00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:09,496\nthe airport or what have you.\n\n575\n00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:12,143\nIt's like you need to exercise\na little more caution.\n\n576\n00:32:12,143 --> 00:32:15,719\nSo, that's something you could be\ninvestigating as a forensics person.\n\n577\n00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:19,792\n>> The one that always cracks me up\nis these people that go to defcon and\n\n578\n00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:23,504\nthese other security things\nwhere they there's nothing but\n\n579\n00:32:23,504 --> 00:32:26,240\npeople that do this all the time there.\n\n580\n00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,416\nAnd they wanted to do their online banking\nand had a break in the meeting but.\n\n581\n00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,630\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n582\n00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,180\nthat's the best of them\ndo it you're right.\n\n583\n00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,800\nIt's the people that should know better\nare some of the biggest offenders,\n\n584\n00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,140\nwhere that big kind of\nbadge on their chest.\n\n585\n00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,470\nI'm a security guru, and I'm a CSO or\nsomething and they've got the thing there\n\n586\n00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,065\nand they're telling you that, you're just\nwaiting, you know it's gonna happen.\n\n587\n00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:50,937\n[LAUGH] You just know.\n\n588\n00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:53,440\nSo it's a big big concern.\n\n589\n00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,560\nAs a forensics tech something to think\nabout is if you do have a data breach,\n\n590\n00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,480\nand you do have that\nloss of confidentiality,\n\n591\n00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,740\nyou're gonna as you do\nyour tracing around and\n\n592\n00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,500\npulling up information,\nonce you trace it down to a person or\n\n593\n00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,160\na station, hopefully you can,\nif you can trace it down that far.\n\n594\n00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,380\nWell, that's the origin of the attack,\nI should say.\n\n595\n00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,650\nIf you trace it down to a person,\nhopefully during your questioning,\n\n596\n00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,920\none of the things you can work in is, if\nyou know that person has mobile devices,\n\n597\n00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,250\nyou suspect that person is,\naccessing stuff from other places,\n\n598\n00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,320\nor maybe just throw it out there.\n\n599\n00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,300\nDo you use public access points?\n\n600\n00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:44,498\nAnd start asking them about that,\ngo into their device.\n\n601\n00:33:44,498 --> 00:33:49,360\nGet a hold of their device and look at\nthe access points that are in there.\n\n602\n00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,700\nIf you recall it was in the CEH,\nand it's gonna be in here too.\n\n603\n00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,891\nThat the list of access points is retained\nby the system that you attach to.\n\n604\n00:33:58,891 --> 00:34:02,313\nThat's how it knows you go back to\nit again, if you said remember it,\n\n605\n00:34:02,313 --> 00:34:04,792\nit will connect right to\nit got that list in there.\n\n606\n00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:08,825\nYou may need to extract that list\nof access points in that system and\n\n607\n00:34:08,825 --> 00:34:13,076\ndo some further investigation and\nsee which ones of them are open, and\n\n608\n00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:17,687\ndetermine if hey this attached to\nsomething that was a public access point,\n\n609\n00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:22,180\nand they possibly were sharing\ndata over that they shouldn't be.\n\n610\n00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:22,810\n>> Right yeah.\nSo\n\n611\n00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,750\nthey might have connected some access\npoint at a hotel or at Starbucks or\n\n612\n00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,810\nsomething like that, and\nthen accessing work documents,\n\n613\n00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,340\nconfidential documents,\nthings like that, and now we gotta.\n\n614\n00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,430\nWonder if that's where\nthe data was exposed.\n\n615\n00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,062\nMaybe this person wasn't Billy.\n\n616\n00:34:36,062 --> 00:34:40,323\nMaybe this person was unintentionally\nBilly, right, or something like that.\n\n617\n00:34:40,323 --> 00:34:45,819\n>> Yeah, and that's one thing you\ndon't want is an unintentional leaker.\n\n618\n00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:46,750\n>> [LAUGH] Never good, never good.\n\n619\n00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,530\nIt depends.\n\n620\n00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,510\n>> Yeah but, it's something to\nthink about though is just.\n\n621\n00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,680\nIs that's putting that spin on it.\n\n622\n00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,100\nYes, you can access information\nfrom all over the place and\n\n623\n00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:05,130\ngo to these public access points,\nbut now you've got that deal where,\n\n624\n00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,020\nsomeone could be bringing\ntheir own device,\n\n625\n00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,610\ncould be accessing it from wherever, and\nnot thinking about what they're accessing.\n\n626\n00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,410\nSo-\n>> We could take that investigation,\n\n627\n00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,750\nwe could see where they\nwere connecting and\n\n628\n00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:19,170\nmaybe the investigation leads that way and\nI have to go get warrants.\n\n629\n00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,850\nAnd talk to that hotspot.\n\n630\n00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:21,620\nGo to Starbucks.\n\n631\n00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,950\nAnd start getting log piles\noff their access points.\n\n632\n00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,190\nWe can trace it back through there.\n\n633\n00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,090\nAnother issue we've got.\n\n634\n00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,750\nWireless integrity is always a problem.\n\n635\n00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,800\n>> Oh, it definitely can be a problem.\n\n636\n00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,250\nData getting altered.\n\n637\n00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,730\nFor numerous reasons.\n\n638\n00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,030\nCould be disruptions, could be people\ndoing man in the middle attacks on it,\n\n639\n00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,170\nthere could be a number of things\nhappening there that could\n\n640\n00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,360\nimpact the integrity of the information.\n\n641\n00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,580\nPeople could be modifying it in\nall sorts of different ways.\n\n642\n00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,650\nAnd that one can be kind of tricky,\nand that's where we're gonna see and\n\n643\n00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:01,320\ndiscuss some of the tools later on, one of\nthe things that you'll see is those rogue\n\n644\n00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,726\naccess points, and someone can intercept\nyour information, not only impact\n\n645\n00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:10,696\nconfidentiality, but they may be able to\nmodify that information, and by modifying.\n\n646\n00:36:10,696 --> 00:36:13,756\nIt now they're gonna cause that\nbig integrity problem, and\n\n647\n00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:16,400\nnow you've got a whole\n'another can of worms open.\n\n648\n00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,310\nWe have tools that can help\nus locate those things.\n\n649\n00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:25,400\nIt's one of the reasons why,\nas a forensics person, some of the tools\n\n650\n00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,830\nwe're gonna talk about will actually help\nyou locate where a device actually is.\n\n651\n00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:33,940\nSo if you're investigating an area, and\nyou take into account the thing that we\n\n652\n00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,220\ntalked about in the previous segment,\nall the different frequencies.\n\n653\n00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:42,080\nYou can walk around an area, and\nperhaps map out all the access points that\n\n654\n00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,660\nare there and the wireless clients\nthat are there, and see, well hey,\n\n655\n00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,960\nI see something there that's not owned\nby the company, I see something here.\n\n656\n00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,030\nI mean, cuz after you find them,\nthey're gonna talk to the IT department.\n\n657\n00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,740\nAnd talk to maybe the other businesses\nin the area, that are near by,\n\n658\n00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,680\nsaying do you recognize this.\n\n659\n00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,890\nAnd if things don't pan out there and\n\n660\n00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,930\nyou see these are all accounted for but\nI still have a couple more out here.\n\n661\n00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,980\nMaybe you want to do\na closer investigation.\n\n662\n00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,470\nAs you saw in CEH I had\nthat little device,\n\n663\n00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:18,130\nthe WiFi Pineapple,\nthat's easy money right there.\n\n664\n00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,110\nI mean, you could get that thing and\njust plug it in and do whatever and\n\n665\n00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,060\nit's not the only device\nthat does that either.\n\n666\n00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,100\n>> And David out there in the chat\nroom throws out an interesting one.\n\n667\n00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,337\nRemember about the swap\nrate on the wrong house.\n\n668\n00:37:30,337 --> 00:37:34,009\nIn Indiana, where the house that\nthey attack or the S.W.A.T.\n\n669\n00:37:34,009 --> 00:37:38,882\nteam raided, had an open access point, and\nit was actually the neighbor connecting to\n\n670\n00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,422\nthat access point and\nthen making threats against the police,\n\n671\n00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:46,258\nthey traced it back to that access\npoint and raided the wrong house.\n\n672\n00:37:46,258 --> 00:37:51,790\n>> Yeah, I do recall that one.\n\n673\n00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:56,232\nThere was another that was kind\nof somewhat similar to this.\n\n674\n00:37:56,232 --> 00:38:00,210\nSomeone mis-configuring\ntheir access point or\n\n675\n00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,370\nnot use the proper protection\non their access point.\n\n676\n00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,880\nAnd what it was,\nit involved a neighbor that or\n\n677\n00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,270\nsomebody that moved new into an area.\n\n678\n00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,520\nIt was a guy, his wife and his child.\n\n679\n00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,530\nHe moved into an area and\nthe neighbor was kinda weird in the head\n\n680\n00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:18,730\nalready, and\nthey didn't really feel comfortable,\n\n681\n00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:24,210\nlook at the specifics of they\nway he interacted with child.\n\n682\n00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:29,110\nAnd they didn't like that,\nso they told him,\n\n683\n00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:33,670\nhey we appreciate it just\nstay away from the child.\n\n684\n00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:38,770\nAnd he didn't like that so\nhe hacked into their access point and\n\n685\n00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,320\nstarted, making threats against people.\n\n686\n00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,420\nAnd then he hit the guy's work,\n\n687\n00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:52,030\nemail and started sending sexual harassing\nemails to people in the company and\n\n688\n00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,270\nthreats against manager's and all that.\n\n689\n00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,450\nSo this guy got called in.\n\n690\n00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:01,601\nI think some of the threats that he\nhad done initially, that the neighbor\n\n691\n00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:06,880\nhad done, were even against like\nthe president, people in congress.\n\n692\n00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,120\nAnd so when the guy gets called into work,\nhe's like, what the heck?\n\n693\n00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,220\nI didn't make those threats.\n\n694\n00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,510\nAnd then they traced it\nback to his access point.\n\n695\n00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,540\nAnd meanwhile, the Secret Service,\nFBI are tracing him down, too.\n\n696\n00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,110\nAnd so all this converges.\n\n697\n00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:23,730\nThis guy says, I didn't do any of this\ntype of stuff, so they said, okay.\n\n698\n00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,540\nWell, they looked at ISP,\ntalked through all this stuff, and\n\n699\n00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:30,090\nsaid, well let's just,\nthere's some stuff that's not right here.\n\n700\n00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:34,170\nSo they investigated and\nthey put some equipment and\n\n701\n00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:38,352\nsome what amounted to you\nknow wire taps on his stuff.\n\n702\n00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:41,734\nAnd they found that the neighbor was\nactually doing it cuz they found\n\n703\n00:39:41,734 --> 00:39:46,070\nfingerprints of, basically, of his\ntraffic and his stuff going through it.\n\n704\n00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,420\nAnd so\nthey were able to track down the guy.\n\n705\n00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,050\nWent to prison for that, it was a little,\nit was a little headcase anyway.\n\n706\n00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,920\n>> Well, a good example of where\na little forensic investigation.\n\n707\n00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,500\nInitially, the investigation\nled us to the wrong location.\n\n708\n00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,380\nBut through proper examination and\n\n709\n00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,170\nusing our forensic techniques\nwe're able to see that, okay,\n\n710\n00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,870\nit's actually coming from this other\nhouse connecting to your access point.\n\n711\n00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,975\nSo a good example of our forensics\nsaving the day and solving the case.\n\n712\n00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:12,475\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n713\n00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:13,577\nIt was a very thorough\n\n714\n00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:18,033\none as in this case that David brought up.\nThe one I was mentioning both cases,\n\n715\n00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:20,863\nforensics, you're right Play a huge role,\n\n716\n00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:25,481\nbecause someone's coming in and\ninvestigating that, and seeing that,\n\n717\n00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:27,775\nheck, it was traced back to this.\nBut\n\n718\n00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:32,410\nI've got someone that just doesn't\nfit the profile, isn't doing this,\n\n719\n00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,160\nnone of the equipment matches,\nthere's something else going on, here.\n\n720\n00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,010\nAnd, so let's do it more,\nlet's do some more investigation.\n\n721\n00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,080\nIn the case I was talking about,\nthey actually found stuff low\n\n722\n00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,650\nenough in the traffic that was tied back\nto the guy's account, and his devices, so.\n\n723\n00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,200\nAnd they did a search warrant,\ndid a background check on the guy,\n\n724\n00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,880\nthey found out he had problems in another\narea, for being kind of wacko and\n\n725\n00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,230\ndoing some hacking type stuff.\n\n726\n00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,440\nAnd so they were able to have enough\nprobable cuz to go search his stuff, and\n\n727\n00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,850\nthey found it and tied it back.\n\n728\n00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,040\n>> Nice.\nI mean you could look at the access point,\n\n729\n00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,230\nand maybe the DHCP table,\nand see that okay,\n\n730\n00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,720\nhere's the Mac addresses that have gotten\nIP addresses from this active point.\n\n731\n00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,570\nHere's all the computers in this house,\n\n732\n00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,080\nthis Mac address doesn't\nappear on any of them.\n\n733\n00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,310\nWhere did that device come from, where is\nthat device and start tracing it back?\n\n734\n00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,770\n>> Yeah.\n>> And let this be a lesson cuz I've\n\n735\n00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,490\ntalked to several people that,\nthey leave their access point open.\n\n736\n00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,640\nThey're like there's nothing on\nmy network that's important.\n\n737\n00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,940\nIn fact, I had one of my father's\nneighbors tell me, if you see anything on\n\n738\n00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,260\nmy network and you want it, just let\nme know and I'll burn a copy for you.\n\n739\n00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,120\nCuz he just left his access point wide\nopen, and this is why we don't do that.\n\n740\n00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,780\nIt's not because you have data\nthat needs to be stolen or\n\n741\n00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,910\nthat could be stolen,\nwhich you probably do anyway.\n\n742\n00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,070\nBut at the same point, you don't want\nother people using your access point,\n\n743\n00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,910\ncuz even though in the end,\nthey figured out who it was.\n\n744\n00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:51,000\nThere was a period of time, I'm sure,\nwhere these people were sweating going,\n\n745\n00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,210\nI might be going to jail for\nsomething I didn't do.\n\n746\n00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,782\nAnd there's the investigation, and\nall the media, and all that crazy stuff,\n\n747\n00:41:56,782 --> 00:42:02,680\ndefinitely wanna secure\nyour access points.\n\n748\n00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,550\n>> Yeah, it's not worth the stuff going on\n>> Key is like come on, people.\n\n749\n00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:10,530\n>> [LAUGH] And as uncomfortable and\narrogant and whatever it sounds for\n\n750\n00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,649\nme to say something like this,\nI have told people before just blunt,\n\n751\n00:42:14,649 --> 00:42:17,855\nit's what makes you think\nyou're that important?\n\n752\n00:42:17,855 --> 00:42:21,595\nThat you have something\nthat I wanna steal.\n\n753\n00:42:21,595 --> 00:42:23,685\nMaybe I just wanna use your bandwidth.\n\n754\n00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:25,935\nI can care less what you have.\n\n755\n00:42:25,935 --> 00:42:27,475\n>> Exactly.\n>> So,\n\n756\n00:42:27,475 --> 00:42:29,285\nthat's another way of looking at it.\n\n757\n00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:34,137\nIt could just be the service I'm going\npoint after, I don't care who you are,\n\n758\n00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:36,267\nyou're an access point\ndon't care beyond that.\n\n759\n00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:40,377\n>> And a way for me to obfuscate myself,\nright, a way for me to try to hide.\n\n760\n00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:43,747\nAnd so the attack looked like\nit came from your access point,\n\n761\n00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:47,017\nthat's where the investigation\nis gonna start anyway, and\n\n762\n00:42:47,017 --> 00:42:49,517\nthen I'm hoping they can't\ntrace it back to me.\n\n763\n00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:51,177\n>> Yep.\n>> Other issues we have with wireless,\n\n764\n00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:52,527\nwe got availability.\n\n765\n00:42:52,527 --> 00:42:58,960\nWe might be investigation a case where the\nwireless itself was attacked, the service.\n\n766\n00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,080\n>> Yes, that's something else that does\nhappen is individuals will go after\n\n767\n00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:10,150\ndisrupting the actual service,\nrather than do anything else.\n\n768\n00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:16,140\nSo, that one can be somewhat tricky\nwith normal equipment to pick up.\n\n769\n00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:21,460\nThat's where you'll have to employ\nsome special techniques and\n\n770\n00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,650\nequipment, to do it.\n\n771\n00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,060\nYou can't really do that as easily\nwith just stuff right out of the box.\n\n772\n00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,307\nThat's where you need stuff like ARP cap,\nwhere it can just go into monitor mode and\n\n773\n00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,807\nstart seeing what's\nspecifically in the area?\n\n774\n00:43:32,807 --> 00:43:35,521\nSo you turn on ARP cap and\nthen you turn on WireShark,\n\n775\n00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:38,239\nand then you start looking and\nreading the traffic,\n\n776\n00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:43,065\nto see who's broadcasting out stuff that\nmight be doing it, a style of service.\n\n777\n00:43:43,065 --> 00:43:45,810\nThen you could also use some of the tools.\n\n778\n00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,420\nOne of them we are gonna\nshow here in a bit.\n\n779\n00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,310\nWe will actually read some of\nthe different frequencies and\n\n780\n00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,075\ndifferent things in the area.\n\n781\n00:43:53,075 --> 00:43:55,875\nCareer and track it down and say,\nthat one is putting out a lot of stuff\n\n782\n00:43:55,875 --> 00:44:00,395\nthat's being disruptive, and\nyou can go right to it with a GPS.\n\n783\n00:44:00,395 --> 00:44:03,345\nSo yeah, the normal stuff won't do that.\n\n784\n00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:06,750\nYou can't just use a normal\nwireless card and do that.\n\n785\n00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:12,835\nSo, you'd have to have some special stuff\nto really make it easier on yourself,\n\n786\n00:44:12,835 --> 00:44:15,165\nand be able to track that down.\n\n787\n00:44:15,165 --> 00:44:16,546\n>> Again, more toys, gotta love it.\n\n788\n00:44:16,546 --> 00:44:17,463\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n789\n00:44:17,463 --> 00:44:18,182\nThat's what it's all about here.\n\n790\n00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:20,551\n>> My budget is just gonna take a hit.\n\n791\n00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:22,137\n>> That's what this whole course is about,\n\n792\n00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:24,963\nis you guys justifying this to your\nsignificant other buying this stuff.\n\n793\n00:44:24,963 --> 00:44:26,008\n>> Yeah.\n\n794\n00:44:26,008 --> 00:44:32,570\nAnd then we've got authentication and\nauthorization issues as well, right?\n\n795\n00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:36,740\n>> Yeah, so there's things where people\nbypass an authentication systems.\n\n796\n00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:42,780\nAnd there's various ways to do that,\nto crack passwords, to\n\n797\n00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,770\nsteal credentials, there's numerous ways,\nthere's even little glitches in systems.\n\n798\n00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:52,470\nOne of the things that you\nmight have to do as a forensics\n\n799\n00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,850\nis you might have to put on the pen\ntester's hat just for a little bit,\n\n800\n00:44:55,850 --> 00:45:01,150\nto see where those holes actually are,\nto see is they could be exploited.\n\n801\n00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:05,200\nAnd see if you can maybe trace\nanything back to those possibilities.\n\n802\n00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,970\nSo you might be seeing, like in those\ncapture portals you see in some locations.\n\n803\n00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:12,720\nThere's actually ways to\nbypass a good number of them,\n\n804\n00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,050\nby inserting certain\ncharacters at the end of it.\n\n805\n00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,550\nNow everyone's looking that up.\n\n806\n00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,305\n[LAUGH]\n>> You'll have to show me that one later,\n\n807\n00:45:19,305 --> 00:45:22,275\ncuz those things really drive me crazy.\n\n808\n00:45:22,275 --> 00:45:25,440\n[LAUGH]\n>> There's ways to bypass those to be\n\n809\n00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,860\nsure, so you might have to\nput your pen tester's hat on.\n\n810\n00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,490\nTo try those out to see if yes, is this\nvulnerable to that, and could this have\n\n811\n00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:39,150\nbeen used and then try to see, if there's\nany other evidence that supports it.\n\n812\n00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,510\nIt might possibly be that.\n\n813\n00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,570\nOther ones, the authorization,\nthe authorization rules how and\n\n814\n00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,410\nwhen you're allowed to attach?\n\n815\n00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:50,940\nThere's ways to by pass\nthose authorization rules.\n\n816\n00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,960\nOne of the things that I just\nput out there right away,\n\n817\n00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,070\nwhich makes things kind of tricky for\nyou to detect, but\n\n818\n00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,340\nyou still can detect it,\nis if you use Mac filtering.\n\n819\n00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,505\nIf you are still one of those people that\ndecides that Mac filtering is a good idea,\n\n820\n00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:07,390\n[LAUGH] which there still are a lot of\npeople out there think it's a great\n\n821\n00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,690\nidea to use Mac filtering.\n\n822\n00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:15,460\nIf you don't know that you can spoof\na Mac address very easily now,\n\n823\n00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,390\nI don't know how else to tell you, really.\n\n824\n00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,020\nIt's one of the easiest things to do.\n\n825\n00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,760\nSo, on any operating system,\nyou could it manually, or\n\n826\n00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,030\nyou could it using a piece of software,\nbut it's incredibly easy.\n\n827\n00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:31,810\nSo, if I wanna pass an authorization rule,\njust one of the easiest ways for\n\n828\n00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,470\nMac filtering just.\n\n829\n00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,320\nSpoof a Mac address, I'm in anyway.\n\n830\n00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,900\n>> Pick up some packets from\nsomebody that's allowed to connect,\n\n831\n00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,220\nget their Mac address, change your\nMac address to that and you're in.\n\n832\n00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,660\nAn we always talk about in security,\nlayers of defense, and\n\n833\n00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,240\nit is good, another layer.\n\n834\n00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,630\nIt'll keep a lot of\nthe honest people honest.\n\n835\n00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,550\nWhat I think we see\nsometimes is people will go.\n\n836\n00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,220\nI've got Mac address filtering\non this access point.\n\n837\n00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,320\nI'll enable that, and\nthat's all I need, and stop there.\n\n838\n00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,990\nThat's I think a big problem,\nto rely on that one layer.\n\n839\n00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,770\n>> Yes, and it's a poor layer at that.\n\n840\n00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:07,690\nThey don't really understand,\nwhat the significance of doing that is and\n\n841\n00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,130\nthe way it really works?\n\n842\n00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,280\nThey just don't get it.\n\n843\n00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,120\nThey don't know the type\nstuff that we all know,\n\n844\n00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:20,440\nthat you could plug in an ARP cap adaptor,\nturn on Wireshark and\n\n845\n00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,660\nit will just pick up anything that\nhappens to be floating by in the air.\n\n846\n00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,830\nOn a frequency it understands it will just\npick it up, and you read the Mac address\n\n847\n00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,680\nof who's associated to that\naccess point and you're done.\n\n848\n00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,710\n>> Even if that's traffic is encrypted,\nremember the header is\n\n849\n00:47:35,710

--> 00:48:36,995\n>> I think Best Buy had some issues with\nsomebody trying to get into their wireless\n\n869\n00:48:36,995 --> 00:48:38,285\nnetwork and change some things.\n\n870\n00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:42,000\nI think Home Depot also had\nan issue with a wireless network.\n\n871\n00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,920\nAt some of their locations.\n\n872\n00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,630\nIt's these people, and\nit's a common thing.\n\n873\n00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,440\nWe want to get that wireless out there.\n\n874\n00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,950\nIt's convenient for our employees or\n\n875\n00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,320\nfor whatever, or for\nour guests or what have you.\n\n876\n00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,590\nAnd it's just not secured\nproperly because it's not\n\n877\n00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:00,230\nunderstood well enough by whoever's\nimplementing it; just poor design.\n\n878\n00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,410\nAnd that's going to lead\nus to vulnerabilities and\n\n879\n00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:05,640\nthen bad guys take advantage of that so\nwe've got to be able to investigate when\n\n880\n00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,870\nsomebody is taking advantage of\nsome of these wireless networks.\n\n881\n00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:14,910\n>> This one that David brings up here,\nthat is unfortunately\n\n882\n00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:20,600\nnot the only time I've heard of that type\nof situation happening, where someone.\n\n883\n00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:27,200\n>> Someone had,\nwe'll just say questionable content or\n\n884\n00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,190\ncompletely illegal content that had\nbeen downloaded over their access point.\n\n885\n00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,500\nAnd it was traced back to them.\n\n886\n00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,919\nThey're the ones that got the charges for\nit.\n\n887\n00:49:36,919 --> 00:49:41,560\nAnd it's,\nthe people that have got that and\n\n888\n00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,040\nhad no record of doing that,\nany of that type of stuff.\n\n889\n00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,910\nOr there's no evidence supporting that\nthey're the ones that actually did it,\n\n890\n00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:51,440\nnot strong enough evidence\nto support that they did it.\n\n891\n00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,950\nEverything pointed much more strongly that\nsomeone else did this by just connecting\n\n892\n00:49:55,950 --> 00:50:00,230\nto their open access point,\na lot of them or\n\n893\n00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:04,650\na good number of them are still\nfighting to get those things overturned\n\n894\n00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:06,030\n>> See that's my problem with it and\n\n895\n00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:10,410\nthat's what I try to warn people about is\nthing about the impact on that family.\n\n896\n00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:14,640\nThey have children and\nthe media circus, the accusations, and\n\n897\n00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,840\ngoing to court and getting your name\ndragged through the mud if you will.\n\n898\n00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,960\nJust a nightmare to try to deal with even\nthough you know you're perfectly innocent.\n\n899\n00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,870\nSecurity access points.\n\n900\n00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,030\nI mean, this isn't security plus.\n\n901\n00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:30,460\nWe know about this and we're going to\ntalk about the investigation side, but\n\n902\n00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,980\nit bears reminding everybody.\n\n903\n00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,660\nYou've got to keep those\naccess points secured.\n\n904\n00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,990\n>> Yeah, it could be something you as\na forensic person you have got to work on.\n\n905\n00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:41,210\nThat type of case they mentioned,\nthat could be primer.\n\n906\n00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:44,950\nAnd any of the ones like this or\nothers could be ones that you work on, and\n\n907\n00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,390\nthe ones that they found people\ndownloading that type of content\n\n908\n00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:52,906\nover an open access point yeah,\n\n909\n00:50:52,906 --> 00:50:56,610\nit had to.\n\n910\n00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:03,420\nThere was forensic techs working on\nthose ones saying this is how it looks\n\n911\n00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,400\nlike it happened, but when you did beneath\nthe surface, there's plenty of other ways\n\n912\n00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:13,400\nthis can happen that's much more obvious\nthat those were the things that did it.\n\n913\n00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,890\nAnd then you start thinking about\nthe stuff we talked about early on\n\n914\n00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:19,070\nin this course about working on teams.\n\n915\n00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,400\nWhen you start putting it\nin the team context of\n\n916\n00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,770\nother things in that person's life,\nand criminal records or\n\n917\n00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:30,980\nlack thereof, you would find out\nthat this person just had nothing\n\n918\n00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,770\nthat pointed towards that direction\nthat they would even committed that, and\n\n919\n00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:38,960\nsearched their houses, and computers and\neverything, there was nothing there, so\n\n920\n00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,870\nit tells you that when you look at\nit that there's something wrong.\n\n921\n00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:45,410\nA forensic tech would pick that up and\nput that in a report and\n\n922\n00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,364\nsay yeah there's something\nnot it just doesn't add up.\n\n923\n00:51:48,364 --> 00:51:52,560\nDigital forensics\ninvestigation saves the day.\n\n924\n00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,500\nAlright.\n\n925\n00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,890\nLooking at the clock ladies and\ngentlemen it's about time for\n\n926\n00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:56,750\nus to take a quick break.\n\n927\n00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,830\nSo we're gonna step away and\nwhen we come back more on wireless.\n\n928\n00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:00,640\nSo stay tuned.\n\n929\n00:52:04,495 --> 00:52:07,906\n[SOUND].\n\n930\n00:52:07,906 --> 00:52:10,070\n>> All right, welcome back,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n931\n00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,200\nSo Sean, we've talked a little bit\nabout some of the different wireless\n\n932\n00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,010\ntechnologies and some of\nthe vulnerabilities that we face with\n\n933\n00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:19,440\nthese different wireless technologies, and\nwhere our investigation might lead us.\n\n934\n00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,340\nLet's talk about that part.\n\n935\n00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,000\nLet's talk about how we investigating\nthese wireless attacks, and\n\n936\n00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,450\nhow we might go about that.\n\n937\n00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:28,290\n>> Yeah, this is the real tricky part.\n\n938\n00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:33,260\nThis is where we part ways\nwith what we've done with\n\n939\n00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:38,490\npen testing and done with knowing what the\ndifferent types of attacks are you know,\n\n940\n00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,240\nwe kind of got an understanding of why and\n\n941\n00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,990\nhow we would investigate, or\nground rules we've got to know.\n\n942\n00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,540\nInvestigating a wireless attack, or\n\n943\n00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,590\npotential wireless attack,\nI guess is the better.\n\n944\n00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:51,700\nWay to put it.\n\n945\n00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:56,130\nYou just can't investigate like\nyou do a normal network attack.\n\n946\n00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,110\nIf there is a normal\nnetwork attack that is.\n\n947\n00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:59,730\nWe just can't do that.\n\n948\n00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:04,030\nThere's certain things we have to take\ninto consideration which some of these\n\n949\n00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:07,900\nactually they make sense when you hear\nthem, but when you initially encounter\n\n950\n00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:14,010\nthem it's kind of strange to think\nabout or seems kind of out of place.\n\n951\n00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:20,670\nBut I assure you these have actually\npanned out in the real world.\n\n952\n00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:24,510\nAnd the way I'm describing them,\nit's kind of new ground.\n\n953\n00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:28,310\n>> Wireless is gonna be a little bit\ndifferent in the way we go about our\n\n954\n00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,130\ninvestigations.\n\n955\n00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,810\n>> Yeah it will be a lot different.\n\n956\n00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:37,690\nYou just like said, you just can't plugin\nsomething like Wireshark and say okay.\n\n957\n00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:42,180\nYou know here we go, we and\nstart picking up traffic.\n\n958\n00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:48,030\nWe do know that yes you can turn on\na Wireshark and pick up wireless traffic.\n\n959\n00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,690\nYes.\nThat's not a question.\n\n960\n00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,690\nBut from a forensic side\nit's just not that simple.\n\n961\n00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:56,460\nYou just can't turn it on and\nsay oh look there's wireless traffic good.\n\n962\n00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,280\nI'm gonna start poking\naround see what I can find.\n\n963\n00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,000\nIt doesn't hold water.\n\n964\n00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,460\nYou can't do that.\n\n965\n00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,970\nSo some little guidelines here\nthat you have to follow and\n\n966\n00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,080\nconsider when doing\na proper investigation.\n\n967\n00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,630\nStuff that's going to be reliable and\nadmissible in court.\n\n968\n00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:15,560\n>> Yeah, immediately the first\nthing I think of is if I'm doing\n\n969\n00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,580\nan investigation and the node is wired in.\n\n970\n00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:21,390\n>> I know most of the time we're\ntalking about switched ethernet or\n\n971\n00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:25,680\nthat traffic coming to and from that\nnode is limited to that node sending and\n\n972\n00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,570\nreceiving information.\n\n973\n00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:29,350\nWireless though changes that right?\n\n974\n00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:33,990\nUnbound media so if I just start capturing\npackets how do I capture data that's.\n\n975\n00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,780\n>> I mean,\nwhat does my warrant cover, right?\n\n976\n00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,380\nWhat am I allowed to capture?\n\n977\n00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,120\nI think that's probably gonna\ncome into play here, right?\n\n978\n00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:46,030\n>> Yeah, that's probably the trick\nnumber here, problem number one is when\n\n979\n00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:51,550\nyou're investigating a wireless network,\nor it's part of your investigation.\n\n980\n00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:55,600\n>> You can search that wireless\nnetwork within the area that you\n\n981\n00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,570\nhave a search warrant for.\n\n982\n00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,620\nYou know, if this is a case\nwhere you have a search warrant.\n\n983\n00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:05,600\nSo if they issued one, you can't go,\nfor example, and if you're\n\n984\n00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,520\ninvestigating somebody that might be doing\nsomething in, say, the house next door.\n\n985\n00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,380\nA house at a certain location.\n\n986\n00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:16,360\nYou can't get access to a vacant house,\nand the next house over, let's say, and\n\n987\n00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,400\nstart sniffing their traffic.\n\n988\n00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,190\nYou don't have a search warrant for that,\nyou can't search that wireless network.\n\n989\n00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,850\nYou have to be within that house or\n\n990\n00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:29,470\nhave a specific search warrant that\nsays you are allowed to attach to that.\n\n991\n00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:31,460\n>> So if you don't have it covered,\n\n992\n00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:35,420\njust because you can get the signal does\nnot mean you are allowed to search it.\n\n993\n00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:38,920\n>> It kind of reminds me of what we\ntalked about earlier with cloud-based\n\n994\n00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,060\nservices and things like that, where we're\ntalking about multi-tenant providers.\n\n995\n00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,610\nThe wireless is kind of the same thing.\n\n996\n00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,810\nYou've got multiple people\nhitting that wireless network.\n\n997\n00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,310\nAnd who am I investigating?\n\n998\n00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,390\nWhat do I have a right to get?\n\n999\n00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,080\nProbably not everything.\n\n1000\n00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,610\nAnd one of the issues I think we're\ngoing to have is one of these\n\n1001\n00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:58,250\naccess cap utilities,\nthey're going to capture it all.\n\n1002\n00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:58,760\n>> Right.\n\n1003\n00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,450\n>> And then I can filter my view,\nbut that doesn't mean that I\n\n1004\n00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:04,870\ndidn't capture that other person's\ntraffic that wasn't under my warrant.\n\n1005\n00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,639\n>> Yes.\nAnd you can have,\n\n1006\n00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:12,540\njust to kind of make sure that we\nget the other angle of this is that.\n\n1007\n00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:17,468\nIf I can't search another access\npoint unless I specifically have\n\n1008\n00:56:17,468 --> 00:56:18,790\na warrant for it.\n\n1009\n00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:23,530\nLike I said,\nif it's a business next door or\n\n1010\n00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:27,030\na house next door, I can't get nearby and\n\n1011\n00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:31,660\nuse something like AirPcap or my wireless\ntools to pick it up at distance.\n\n1012\n00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,000\nI can't be sitting out\nin the parking lot and\n\n1013\n00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,200\nsay, hey, I got a signal,\ntherefore I can search it.\n\n1014\n00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,270\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n1015\n00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,885\nYou have to have a search warrant for it.\n\n1016\n00:56:38,885 --> 00:56:43,223\n>> So if my target of my investigation,\nif I suspect that they're actually using\n\n1017\n00:56:43,223 --> 00:56:46,643\nthe neighbor's wireless access\npoint to commit this crime,\n\n1018\n00:56:46,643 --> 00:56:51,004\nI can't just go search that access point\nor start capturing traffic off of it.\n\n1019\n00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:53,721\n>> Yes,\nif that's the case then you have to,\n\n1020\n00:56:53,721 --> 00:56:56,593\nthat the neighbor's wireless is involved,\n\n1021\n00:56:56,593 --> 00:57:01,440\nthen you're gonna have to discuss\nif you're allowed to go over there.\n\n1022\n00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,411\nTypically you're gonna have to err\non the side of caution and just say,\n\n1023\n00:57:04,411 --> 00:57:07,740\nno I can't search over onto\nthat side of the house.\n\n1024\n00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:12,550\nI have to get another warrant or\nsubpoena or what have you to search or\n\n1025\n00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,610\nget the information I\nneed from that source.\n\n1026\n00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,500\nSo that can be a real\narea of confusion and\n\n1027\n00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,690\na real area of problem when you initially\ncome into this because you would expect,\n\n1028\n00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:24,820\nyou can get a signal,\ntherefore you can search it.\n\n1029\n00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,795\nAnd we never really considered that\nbefore when we did our pen testing.\n\n1030\n00:57:28,795 --> 00:57:33,220\nIn pen testing we said, well heck,\nif we can hit it we can attack it.\n\n1031\n00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,460\n>> Anything I can find I'm going\nto hit it and hard, right?\n\n1032\n00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,703\n>> Yeah, that's it.\n\n1033\n00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,678\n>> But with this, not so much.\n\n1034\n00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:41,689\nYeah and that's the same thing when\nyou go someplace with your notebook,\n\n1035\n00:57:41,689 --> 00:57:45,910\neven though we're not talking about\nthis malicious type of behavior.\n\n1036\n00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:49,060\nYou go someplace with your notebook or\nyour tablet or\n\n1037\n00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,800\nyour cellphone,\nif you can get a signal you can use it.\n\n1038\n00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,450\nThat's the typical way people think.\n\n1039\n00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,710\nI don't care where it is,\nif I can get a signal that I can use and\n\n1040\n00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,960\nget online with it, it's fine.\n\n1041\n00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,370\nBut not from this side of it.\n\n1042\n00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:06,600\nIf you don't have what you\nneed to actually search that,\n\n1043\n00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:12,140\nwritten out in a warrant, or at least have\npermission to do that, then you're stuck.\n\n1044\n00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:15,150\nYou have to obtain\npermission to get in there,\n\n1045\n00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:17,310\nwhether it's in the form of a warrant or\nsomething else.\n\n1046\n00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:21,100\n>> Right.\n>> So make sure you keep aware of that.\n\n1047\n00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,990\nIt's also way you may wanna consider,\nif you haven't already,\n\n1048\n00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:30,810\ninvesting in a GPS as part of your\ntoolkit to plug into your stuff.\n\n1049\n00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:34,510\nSo if you got a notebook,\nmake sure you have a plugin GPS or\n\n1050\n00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:39,190\nBluetooth GPS that you can map out where\nthe access points are to make sure you\n\n1051\n00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:44,670\nare within the parameters\nthat have been established.\n\n1052\n00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:45,320\n>> Exactly.\n\n1053\n00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,577\nAll right, so\nwe've gotta be within the warrant,\n\n1054\n00:58:48,577 --> 00:58:53,450\nthe access point needs to be covered in\nthe warrant before we go to search it.\n\n1055\n00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,009\nAnd once we get access\nto that access point,\n\n1056\n00:58:55,009 --> 00:58:57,732\nthen we start doing things like trying\nto figure out who's connected to it?\n\n1057\n00:58:57,732 --> 00:59:01,400\n>> Yes,\nit's find out who the active clients are.\n\n1058\n00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,100\n>> As you had mentioned, you have a list\nof, and most access points, well, really\n\n1059\n00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:13,400\nany access points, the DHCP server on it\nwill keep track of who connected to it.\n\n1060\n00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,035\nSome of them even have additional logging\ncapabilities that you can turn on\n\n1061\n00:59:17,035 --> 00:59:21,255\nthat will also keep track of that,\nof who's connected.\n\n1062\n00:59:21,255 --> 00:59:25,815\nOne of the things that can be kinda\ntricky with this is, who's active and\n\n1063\n00:59:25,815 --> 00:59:28,755\nare you able to investigate\nthose active clients?\n\n1064\n00:59:28,755 --> 00:59:34,970\nIf you're in a public access point,\nthat gets to be kinda crazy actually and\n\n1065\n00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:38,657\nkind of a gray area,\nis the way I kinda see it,\n\n1066\n00:59:38,657 --> 00:59:42,851\neven though some people\nmight disagree with that.\n\n1067\n00:59:42,851 --> 00:59:46,453\nBecause, like you said,\nif you have a public access point and\n\n1068\n00:59:46,453 --> 00:59:51,025\nthere's a lot of people attached to it,\nwho should you be investigating?\n\n1069\n00:59:51,025 --> 00:59:53,755\nYou start picking up traffic on there,\nif you have a search warrant for\n\n1070\n00:59:53,755 --> 00:59:57,755\nthat access point, you've got people\non there that have nothing to do,\n\n1071\n00:59:57,755 --> 00:59:59,932\nif it's at a Starbucks or\nsomething like that,\n\n1072\n00:59:59,932 --> 01:00:02,842\nyou have people that have nothing to\ndo with the crime you're investigating.\n\n1073\n01:00:02,842 --> 01:00:06,772\nSo you're gonna need to exercise\nextra levels of caution.\n\n1074\n01:00:06,772 --> 01:00:09,982\nIs the person you're investigating,\nare they an active client there?\n\n1075\n01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:13,210\nDo they have any sort of active\nconnection interaction with that?\n\n1076\n01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:16,380\nIf not, then that can be kind of an issue,\n\n1077\n01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,690\nbecause now what are you\naccessing the access point for?\n\n1078\n01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:24,270\n>> Yeah, so here we got this, we're gonna\ncome in, investigate this access point,\n\n1079\n01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:27,470\nbut the intended target\nof my investigation\n\n1080\n01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:29,780\nisn't even currently connected\nto the access point.\n\n1081\n01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,720\nSo what the heck am I doing there?\n\n1082\n01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,050\nI'm just getting stuff I really don't\nneed, or not that I don't need, but\n\n1083\n01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:37,700\nstuff that's probably not\ncovered by my search warrant.\n\n1084\n01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,370\n>> Yes, and it could get you into trouble\nif you start collecting stuff that you\n\n1085\n01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,590\ndon't need and you don't keep it private.\n\n1086\n01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:46,200\nRemember, you do have a responsibility,\nif it's something you don't need or\n\n1087\n01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:51,729\nsomeone else's information that you're got\nby accident you are compelled to keep that\n\n1088\n01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,870\nunder wraps, because they're not involved,\nthey're not implicated on that.\n\n1089\n01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:03,500\nEven if you find something illegal,\nyou can't go and\n\n1090\n01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,070\njust say okay,\nI found this in the course of all this.\n\n1091\n01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,130\nThat's something different,\n\n1092\n01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,765\nyou don't have permission to do that,\nit will be discarded.\n\n1093\n01:01:10,765 --> 01:01:15,139\n>> Fruit of the poisonous tree, I think\nthey always say in our Law & Order shows.\n\n1094\n01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:17,641\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yep, and just talking about this,\n\n1095\n01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:21,199\nBrian's talking about this one, doing\nman-in-the-middles and stuff like that.\n\n1096\n01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:25,930\nYou could technically do something like\nthat, in certain cases that might be\n\n1097\n01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:30,460\nof benefit to run a man-in-the-middle and\nfilter traffic through it.\n\n1098\n01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:35,330\nYou could do that,\nit wouldn't be that far off from the DNS\n\n1099\n01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:37,879\npoisoning we talked about with the network\nstuff, you're rerouting traffic.\n\n1100\n01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:43,795\nBut you might need to be a little bit\nmore careful with something like that.\n\n1101\n01:01:43,795 --> 01:01:49,503\nIt could very well be questionable if you\nput out something like a WiFi Pineapple,\n\n1102\n01:01:49,503 --> 01:01:54,054\nand that something that you\nsetup to do a man-in-the-middle,\n\n1103\n01:01:54,054 --> 01:01:58,240\nwhich it's perfectly capable of doing,\nno problem.\n\n1104\n01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,390\nIf you set that up and\nit started receiving signals and\n\n1105\n01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:05,640\npeople start attaching to it,\nthere could be a question of whether,\n\n1106\n01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:10,250\nif you did enticement or\nentrapment in that specific situation.\n\n1107\n01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:13,100\nIt could actually be argued either way.\n\n1108\n01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,497\nEspecially considering the capabilities\nof something like the Pineapple where it\n\n1109\n01:02:19,497 --> 01:02:23,562\ncan actually be programmed to to\nlook like a specific access point.\n\n1110\n01:02:23,562 --> 01:02:27,227\nOr it can read those probe requests\nthat your system sends out, and\n\n1111\n01:02:27,227 --> 01:02:30,640\nspoof one of the ones you\npreviously attached to.\n\n1112\n01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:35,200\nSo, depending on which one it is,\nit could be enticement or entrapment.\n\n1113\n01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,025\nIf you just put an open access point\nwith a certain name out there and\n\n1114\n01:02:39,025 --> 01:02:42,170\nit's set, so it's fixed and\nit's not changing,\n\n1115\n01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:48,350\nthen that's more than likely gonna\nfall under some sort of enticement.\n\n1116\n01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:51,410\nYou're putting it out there, but\nI'm not forcing you to do anything.\n\n1117\n01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:53,860\nI'm not forcing you to attach to it.\n\n1118\n01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:55,050\nIt's like I'm not forcing you,\n\n1119\n01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:57,640\nI'm not shoving a gun in your\nhand saying go rob that bank.\n\n1120\n01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,150\n>> But I sure am leading you that way,\naren't I?\n\n1121\n01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,532\nYeah, and that's what gets tricky.\n\n1122\n01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:06,450\n>> By mimicking Starbucks or what have\nyou, I'm darn sure coaxing you, I guess.\n\n1123\n01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,470\n>> Well, if you named it something else.\n\n1124\n01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:10,549\nI mean, heck,\ntechnically if you named it Not Starbucks-\n\n1125\n01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:11,292\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1126\n01:03:11,292 --> 01:03:13,001\n>> If it's near Starbucks and\nsomeone's still attached to it.\n\n1127\n01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:19,043\nNow you didn't say you were,\nyou put Not Starbucks.\n\n1128\n01:03:19,043 --> 01:03:19,600\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1129\n01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,618\n>> So, you could sit there and\nargue the case.\n\n1130\n01:03:22,618 --> 01:03:25,521\nWell, they should have known,\nthe name itself says that.\n\n1131\n01:03:25,521 --> 01:03:26,612\nSo, and they attached to it anyway.\n\n1132\n01:03:26,612 --> 01:03:29,080\n>> I'm actually kinda curious now,\nthat might be a project I do.\n\n1133\n01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,060\nI wanna go to Starbucks and create\nan access point called Not Starbucks, and\n\n1134\n01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,590\njust see how many people connect to it.\n\n1135\n01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:34,160\n>> Oh, like everybody.\n\n1136\n01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,205\n>> [LAUGH] I know.\n\n1137\n01:03:35,205 --> 01:03:36,552\n>> You'll get all sorts of stuff.\n\n1138\n01:03:36,552 --> 01:03:37,785\n>> Oh look,\nthis one's got a better signal,\n\n1139\n01:03:37,785 --> 01:03:38,896\nI'm gonna connect to Not Starbucks.\n\n1140\n01:03:38,896 --> 01:03:41,970\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, yeah, they'll do it.\n\n1141\n01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:45,070\nIt just brings them all in.\n\n1142\n01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:48,560\nBut you have the enticement side,\nand then the entrapment side.\n\n1143\n01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,180\nThe entrapment would be is if\nyou spoofed an access point,\n\n1144\n01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,730\nif you said you were Starbucks and\nyou weren't.\n\n1145\n01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:57,384\n>> Then that's becomes much more\nquestionable because that person's\n\n1146\n01:03:57,384 --> 01:04:00,660\nattaching to that with\nthe understanding that it's Starbucks.\n\n1147\n01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,650\nNow, you're not making\nthem do illegal stuff, but\n\n1148\n01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:07,190\nthey're not attaching to the thing\nthey thought they were attaching to.\n\n1149\n01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:09,844\nSo, it probably could\nbe argued successfully.\n\n1150\n01:04:09,844 --> 01:04:12,584\nI say probably, again,\ncuz I'm not a lawyer.\n\n1151\n01:04:12,584 --> 01:04:16,972\nBut it's something to think about.\n\n1152\n01:04:16,972 --> 01:04:20,951\n>> When you're doing this sort of thing,\nyou may very well get something\n\n1153\n01:04:20,951 --> 01:04:25,790\nlike a Wi-Fi pineapple or something\nalong those lines for your Toolkit.\n\n1154\n01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,420\nI've got them in mine.\n\n1155\n01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,520\nSo,\n>> I'm getting one as soon\n\n1156\n01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,835\nas I can afford it.\n\n1157\n01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:34,180\n[LAUGH] So you know continuing on\nwith that train of thought though.\n\n1158\n01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:36,330\nWe've talked about an investigator.\n\n1159\n01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:39,840\nWhat type of equipment are we going\nto want to have in our Toolkit?\n\n1160\n01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,450\nI know we're going to get into software\nthings later, but hardware wise, you know,\n\n1161\n01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:44,520\nwhat do we need?\n\n1162\n01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,845\n>> Whatever you can afford.\n\n1163\n01:04:46,845 --> 01:04:52,750\n[LAUGH] There's a lot of\ntoys that you could get,\n\n1164\n01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:58,800\nit depends on just how\naggressive you're gonna be\n\n1165\n01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,030\ninvestigating wireless, so\nbecause there's so many things out there,\n\n1166\n01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:10,105\nyou can get stuff that's homemade,\nyou can get stuff that it off the rack.\n\n1167\n01:05:10,105 --> 01:05:12,675\nYou can get all sorts of little things.\n\n1168\n01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,855\nStuff that I think you just have to have.\n\n1169\n01:05:14,855 --> 01:05:20,215\nCuz you're gonna have to have stuff like,\nWireshark has to be in your Toolkit.\n\n1170\n01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:23,005\nIt's probably already there but\nyou need to have that.\n\n1171\n01:05:23,005 --> 01:05:25,255\nYou definitely need to have Air P Cap.\n\n1172\n01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:28,850\nYou're not gonna get out\nwithout having that.\n\n1173\n01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:33,270\nSo, that's gonna be a very important\npart and you're probably gonna have to\n\n1174\n01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:38,056\njust bite the bullet and get the one\nthat's top of the line, the $800 one or\n\n1175\n01:05:38,056 --> 01:05:41,910\nthe $900 one, because that's the one\nthat's gonna capture everything.\n\n1176\n01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:45,530\nThen, you're gonna need\nto invest in antennas\n\n1177\n01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:50,560\nto make sure that you can get the range,\nand stuff like that.\n\n1178\n01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,010\nGPS enabled stuff,\nyou're going to need to have that.\n\n1179\n01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:56,872\nIf you don't, if you have a laptop,\nit probably doesn't have a GPS in it.\n\n1180\n01:05:56,872 --> 01:05:59,650\nYou're gonna need to have\nan external GPS of some sort,\n\n1181\n01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,262\nwhether it's a USB or Bluetooth.\n\n1182\n01:06:01,262 --> 01:06:05,250\nYou're gonna need to have\nthat available to you.\n\n1183\n01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:08,720\nJust for the record, you're probably going\nto want to consider if it's better for\n\n1184\n01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:13,700\nyou to have a USB Bluetooth Then a USB GPS\n\n1185\n01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:18,250\nthen a Bluetooth GPS cuz a Bluetooth GPS\nis just going to feed more\n\n1186\n01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:22,270\nstuff out into the ether that you're\ngoing to pick up with your equipment.\n\n1187\n01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,040\n>> I gotta filter out my own information.\n\n1188\n01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,960\nSo, yeah, that could be it.\n\n1189\n01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,110\n>> Yeah.\nIt's another thing that you could just\n\n1190\n01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,880\ntake out of the equation\njust by plugging one in for\n\n1191\n01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,500\nit and\nthat might just be easier all around.\n\n1192\n01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:40,140\nAnd there's other equipment too.\n\n1193\n01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:44,290\nThere's tools that you can get that are\nhandheld, that you can sweep an area with.\n\n1194\n01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:46,720\nAnd it's not those ones that,\n\n1195\n01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,760\nthose Wi-Fi detectors that\njust blink a light doing that.\n\n1196\n01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,110\nNo those are toys.\n\n1197\n01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:56,890\nThey have ones that you\ncan sweep an area with.\n\n1198\n01:06:56,890 --> 01:07:00,290\nAnd it's a hand held device, and\nit's just got a little meter on it,\n\n1199\n01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:01,720\nand it tells you the strength.\n\n1200\n01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:07,610\nIt will do a spectrum analysis on the area\nand help you track these things down.\n\n1201\n01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:11,830\nSo it's kind of a neat thing, so you can\nmaybe use some of your equipment with\n\n1202\n01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:14,620\nthe GPS to track it down\nto a specific region and\n\n1203\n01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,835\nthey use one of these devices to\nfind specifically where it is.\n\n1204\n01:07:17,835 --> 01:07:18,610\n>> All right.\n\n1205\n01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:21,260\n>> Or maybe you could use it also to find\n\n1206\n01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,560\nsome of those things\nare doing interference.\n\n1207\n01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,130\n>> Like a jammer or something.\n\n1208\n01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:26,840\n>> Yeah.\nYou could find those things that might\n\n1209\n01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,980\nbe very tough to locate.\n\n1210\n01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:32,830\nOtherwise, you can use one of\nthese things to maybe get.\n\n1211\n01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:36,080\nYou could use your other equipment\nto get a general area perhaps, or\n\n1212\n01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,080\njust use one of these things to sweep\nthe area and watch the needle, and see.\n\n1213\n01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,565\n>> To- find out where Shaun stuck\nthat Wi-Fi pineapple in your network.\n\n1214\n01:07:43,565 --> 01:07:45,450\n[LAUGH]\n>> You ain't gonna find it.\n\n1215\n01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:46,350\nJust deal with it.\n\n1216\n01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:47,470\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n1217\n01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:49,780\nAnd so kind of tieing into our GPS then.\n\n1218\n01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,050\nAnother thing we wanna do in\nour wireless investigation.\n\n1219\n01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:56,325\nMap out our area, kind of keep\ntrack of what's going on the area.\n\n1220\n01:07:56,325 --> 01:07:59,420\n>> Yes, so and\nthat would fit into our equipment and\n\n1221\n01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:02,160\nall that is being able to have\nsomething that does a site survey.\n\n1222\n01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,960\nThat's what they call it when they're\ndoing just the pure wireless,\n\n1223\n01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:10,070\noutside of our forensic stuff,\nis being able to map out the area and\n\n1224\n01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:14,340\nsee what lives out there where things are.\n\n1225\n01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,540\n>> We're talking about mapping this.\n\n1226\n01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:17,650\nWe're not talking about mapping\nout the desk and the furniture.\n\n1227\n01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:19,440\nI mean, that was part of our\ncrime scene investigation,\n\n1228\n01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,610\nbut we're talking about the wireless.\n\n1229\n01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:24,050\nWhere the access points are and\nthings like that.\n\n1230\n01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:24,790\n>> Yeah.\nYou know,\n\n1231\n01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:29,125\nit It very well could be where\nyou have your furniture out and\n\n1232\n01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:32,085\nyou draw a rough sketch to show\nwhere it is relative to that.\n\n1233\n01:08:33,095 --> 01:08:36,405\nThere's nothing saying you couldn't, so\nyou may have drawn out that floor plan,\n\n1234\n01:08:36,405 --> 01:08:38,745\nand now you're just gonna\n\n1235\n01:08:38,745 --> 01:08:43,175\nannotate where those various access\npoints are on that floor plan.\n\n1236\n01:08:43,175 --> 01:08:44,755\nI don't see any problem with that.\n\n1237\n01:08:44,755 --> 01:08:46,235\nIt doesn't have to be that way.\n\n1238\n01:08:46,235 --> 01:08:51,450\nYou could just say it's here, here,\nand here and just call it a day.\n\n1239\n01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:54,100\nWhatever helps identify clearly and\n\n1240\n01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:59,230\nambiguously as possible where that\naccess point is, I'm all for.\n\n1241\n01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:00,780\nThat's what they're gonna be looking for.\n\n1242\n01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:05,560\nSomething that's being thorough and\nvery clear and there's really no ifs,\n\n1243\n01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,000\nands or buts on how to interpret it.\n\n1244\n01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,580\nThe better you can get towards that,\nthe better for you.\n\n1245\n01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,730\n>> And\nwhen you talk about wireless analysis.\n\n1246\n01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:14,010\nIt's just something we've got to do.\n\n1247\n01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:18,680\nWe're talking trying to figure out,\nagain, really what's out there.\n\n1248\n01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,880\nWhat access points, what frequencies\nthey're using and things like that?\n\n1249\n01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,612\n>> Yes, there's a lot of potential things\nthat could be sitting out there so,\n\n1250\n01:09:26,612 --> 01:09:31,350\nyou're gonna want to do\nthis analysis to see what\n\n1251\n01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:36,190\nspecifically in the area because that's\ngoing to also give you a clear picture\n\n1252\n01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:40,400\nof what you may be investigating or\nmight need to look for.\n\n1253\n01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,230\nYou never know.\n\n1254\n01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:47,690\nI guarantee you going to find some\nsurprises in just about every environment.\n\n1255\n01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:49,430\nThere's so\n\n1256\n01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:54,710\nmany things that have wireless now a days\nthat they just kind of hang out there.\n\n1257\n01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:57,530\nAnd you're like there's one,\nthere's one, there's one.\n\n1258\n01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:02,160\nUnless you have something like a wireless\nIDS that's designed to pick those\n\n1259\n01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:06,630\nthings up and pinpoint where they are,\nsomething like AirMagnet can do that.\n\n1260\n01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:08,740\nIf you have one of those things then yeah,\n\n1261\n01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:13,645\nyou probably know at least inside\nof your facility where they are.\n\n1262\n01:10:13,645 --> 01:10:20,340\nBut if you don't have that and\nthat may be kind of a pricey investment.\n\n1263\n01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:24,970\nFor a company to have which is why\nmostly large enterprise companies and\n\n1264\n01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:25,940\ndefense contractors.\n\n1265\n01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:30,000\nStuff like that have it so\nyou're probably not gonna have that.\n\n1266\n01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,300\nYou're probably gonna have to get\nequipment to specially survey the area and\n\n1267\n01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,010\nfind out where those\nvarious things are and\n\n1268\n01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:40,190\nthen you're gonna have to get\nequipment to analyze the traffic.\n\n1269\n01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:44,360\nAnd we've talked about some\nof those in the CEH class,\n\n1270\n01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:49,390\none of the ones I show which might very\nwell be useful here would be that Pwn Pad\n\n1271\n01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:54,120\nfrom Pwnie Express if you guys\nneed to take a look at that.\n\n1272\n01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,730\nYou could build your own.\n\n1273\n01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:58,579\nYou can buy one if you want\n\n1274\n01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:05,590\nthat Pony Express they have a Pwn pad and\nthey have what they call a Pwn phone.\n\n1275\n01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:06,850\nYou've got the tablet and\n\n1276\n01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:11,890\nyou got a phone you don't have to\nhave both you can get either or and\n\n1277\n01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:18,150\nyou can walk around a area and you can\nstart figuring out where everything is.\n\n1278\n01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:23,720\nAnd once you've mapped everything out and\nidentified everything, well now your\n\n1279\n01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:28,110\na good portion of the way there and\nremember that could do Bluetooth too.\n\n1280\n01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:30,070\nWe haven't really said\ntoo much about Bluetooth.\n\n1281\n01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:34,750\nThat Pwn pad can do Bluetooth and\nit can do it from a significant distance,\n\n1282\n01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:39,840\nwhich is a real time saver and\nI don't even want to think about mapping\n\n1283\n01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,622\nout a building with normal\nBluetooth being 30 feet at most.\n\n1284\n01:11:44,622 --> 01:11:47,710\n>> Cuz you really have to walk,\nthink about that, the range is so\n\n1285\n01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:51,340\nshort, you really need to walk\nalmost every inch of that building,\n\n1286\n01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:55,750\nyou can't just sit in one spot and try to\ndo this wireless analysis like you might\n\n1287\n01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:59,240\nwith something that has a 300 foot range\nand the building is only 100 feet.\n\n1288\n01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,470\nI mean, I can stand in the middle of it,\n\n1289\n01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:04,380\nI should be able to pick up anything\nthat's located in that building.\n\n1290\n01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,170\nBluetooth not so\nmuch because of that short range.\n\n1291\n01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:08,950\n>> Yeah, and 30 feet,\nyou're never getting that.\n\n1292\n01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:13,590\nYou're gonna have to get real close.\n\n1293\n01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:17,711\nIt's just the name of the game.\n\n1294\n01:12:17,711 --> 01:12:20,160\nSomething like having a Pwn Pad or\n\n1295\n01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:25,583\nhaving one of those plugs you can put\ninto a device that can get you extended\n\n1296\n01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:30,950\nrange Is gonna go a long way of\nBluetooth to make your life easier.\n\n1297\n01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:34,990\nSo it's just having these additional\nthings that can do that analysis,\n\n1298\n01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:38,230\nand there's plenty more\neven outside of this.\n\n1299\n01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:42,060\nThere's a whole bunch\nthat you could create and\n\n1300\n01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,200\nput in your environment\nthat can help you out.\n\n1301\n01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,580\nI mean it's possible.\n\n1302\n01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:48,230\nYou could go on something like eBay and\nget it.\n\n1303\n01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,250\neBay is a popular one to\nget antennas that cheap.\n\n1304\n01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:55,100\nA new antenna's cheap, and you could\nsweep an area quite easily with that.\n\n1305\n01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:59,150\nYou can get a handheld Yagi antenna,\nthe directional ones, and\n\n1306\n01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:01,750\njust sweep an area with that\nto find out where things are.\n\n1307\n01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,680\nYou might have to do that sort of thing.\n\n1308\n01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,310\nSo be prepared.\n\n1309\n01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:10,570\n>> At our crime scene, they might not have\nthose access points sitting right there\n\n1310\n01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:12,150\non top of their filing cabinet or\nsomething.\n\n1311\n01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:12,710\nSomething like that.\n\n1312\n01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:13,930\nWe gotta find it.\n\n1313\n01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:18,720\n>> Yeah, and like I said,\nremember, wireless is everywhere.\n\n1314\n01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:23,550\nIt's just staggering the amount of\nstuff that it's in from tablets,\n\n1315\n01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:28,640\nto notebooks,\nto set top boxes, to games and\n\n1316\n01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:32,250\ncontrollers and-\n>> My DVD player, my Roku.\n\n1317\n01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,840\nI mean everything, right?\n\n1318\n01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,200\n>> Yeah, and they're talking.\n\n1319\n01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,720\nI was reading an article recently and\nI know everyone's heard that term,\n\n1320\n01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,870\nthe Internet of things.\n\n1321\n01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:42,790\nThey're sticking everything\non the Internet.\n\n1322\n01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:49,000\nThe think to remember with that if\nit's not clear to you is, yeah,\n\n1323\n01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,070\none of the things they're talking\nabout now is all the addresses.\n\n1324\n01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:55,190\nAnd they're like we need to\nreally get this IP6 stuff going\n\n1325\n01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:58,770\nfast because we're going to\nreally accelerate it now.\n\n1326\n01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:02,750\nWell, the other thing you've got\nto think about is is those are,\n\n1327\n01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,820\nvery few of those are being hardwired in.\n\n1328\n01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:07,262\nThose are pretty much all wired devices.\n\n1329\n01:14:07,262 --> 01:14:10,580\nPeople gonna have to have\na wireless access point\n\n1330\n01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:14,480\nno matter where they are to get all\nof these Internet of things working.\n\n1331\n01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,939\nAnd there's all sorts of goofy\nstuff that can be out there.\n\n1332\n01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,670\nI would hate to go investigate\nsome of these places.\n\n1333\n01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:25,770\nI was a bunch of CA like those\nlittle red lights you can get.\n\n1334\n01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:26,960\nSimilar to the ones from hockey.\n\n1335\n01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,980\nThose are wireless.\n\n1336\n01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:32,760\nThey have beer pitchers\nthat are that way now too.\n\n1337\n01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,770\nI's so not kidding about that.\n\n1338\n01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,890\n>> I was reading something,\nand I can't remember what.\n\n1339\n01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:39,000\nI will have to find it and\ngive you guys a link.\n\n1340\n01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,240\nThey were talking about wearables.\n\n1341\n01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:46,110\nSo now we're talking about my\nshirt might actually be connected.\n\n1342\n01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,657\nAnyway, it is crazy.\n\n1343\n01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:51,370\n>> I don't know why we need that.\n\n1344\n01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:55,080\nSo as you walk around,\nyour shirt might be displaying,\n\n1345\n01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,170\nI don't know, I'm trying, I really am.\n\n1346\n01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:00,895\nBut yeah,\nthey really are wearables now, so.\n\n1347\n01:15:00,895 --> 01:15:05,410\n[COUGH] Anyway tell you what,\nladies and gentlemen,\n\n1348\n01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:07,410\nI think that pretty much does it for\nsome of our wireless attacks.\n\n1349\n01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:12,250\nWe wanna pick up with some more tools and\ntalking about some of the things\n\n1350\n01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,500\nyou might look at when you're\npurchasing these tools.\n\n1351\n01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:21,792\nBut, we're gonna save that for after the\nbreak, so stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1352\n01:15:21,792 --> 01:15:29,197\n[SOUND] All right welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n1353\n01:15:29,197 --> 01:15:31,720\nSo continuing on with our wireless Shawn.\n\n1354\n01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,000\nNext thing we want to talk about is, you\nknow we've talked about a few different\n\n1355\n01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,770\ntools that we might want\nto include in our tool kit.\n\n1356\n01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,670\nWhat makes a good wireless tool, I mean,\n\n1357\n01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:45,160\nwhat really am I looking for when I go\nout there and try to fill up my toolkit?\n\n1358\n01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,900\n>> Yeah, that's the thing.\n\n1359\n01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:52,840\nWhen you're gonna be doing a forensic\nanalysis with wireless, you can't just\n\n1360\n01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:58,280\nbuy any tool off the shelf and say, okay,\nit picks up wireless and I'm good to go.\n\n1361\n01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,270\nThat's far from the truth.\n\n1362\n01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:04,900\nIt's the same with pen testing, in fact\na lot of the stuff that you see with\n\n1363\n01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:09,460\npen testing as far as criteria for\nwireless would apply here.\n\n1364\n01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,370\nWe need something that's more capable,\n\n1365\n01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:14,620\nat least need to make sure the equipment\nbuilt into whatever device\n\n1366\n01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:18,770\nis more capable before we start doing\nany sort of analysis whatsoever.\n\n1367\n01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:20,320\nBecause, we don't wanna miss anything.\n\n1368\n01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,580\nIf we miss anything,\nthat's what's been said previously,\n\n1369\n01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,410\nthat could be a key piece of evidence.\n\n1370\n01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:29,060\nSo, we need to make sure that there's\ncertain things that are satisfied or\n\n1371\n01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,260\nare present.\n\n1372\n01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,180\nTo make sure that we're getting\nthe most bang for the buck, and\n\n1373\n01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:37,500\nbeing able to pick up anything that we\nneed to pick up for our investigation.\n\n1374\n01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,720\n>> Nice, okay.\n\n1375\n01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,020\nSo Just the key things.\n\n1376\n01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,680\nIt monitors all the different channels,\n\n1377\n01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,540\nall the different frequencies\nthat are out there.\n\n1378\n01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:48,670\nMight be able to get one device that does\nall that, might have to get more than one.\n\n1379\n01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:51,510\nYes, you do have to consider\nthat as any type of device or\n\n1380\n01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:56,280\nany type of frequency that's in your\nspecific area that you're investigating is\n\n1381\n01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:00,910\none more thing that you will need to make\nsure that your equipment can receive.\n\n1382\n01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:04,660\nIf you intend to investigate it,\nyour equipment has to receive it.\n\n1383\n01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:09,380\nYes, you can get a device that\nwill accept all of those, or\n\n1384\n01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:13,010\ndo all those, but you may end\nup having to get more than one.\n\n1385\n01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:17,400\nOr the ones that you have don't have the\nexact capabilities you need because there\n\n1386\n01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,480\nare some specific things\nthat you want to have.\n\n1387\n01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,580\nSo the first thing would be have\nan adapter that can pick up across a broad\n\n1388\n01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:25,870\nspectrum.\n\n1389\n01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:28,910\nAnd once you have that,\nwe've got that satisfied,\n\n1390\n01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,200\nbut there are others to be sure.\n\n1391\n01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,980\nMake sure you satisfy that key thing and\n\n1392\n01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:37,270\ndon't make the mistake that built\nin adapters are going to do it all.\n\n1393\n01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:40,039\nJust because a piece of\nsoftware that you have,\n\n1394\n01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:43,420\nseems like it does everything\nthrough that adapter.\n\n1395\n01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:48,510\nIt may very well not do\neverything you need.\n\n1396\n01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:50,740\nThat's happened in a lot of cases.\n\n1397\n01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:56,095\nOne of the cases of it would be\nthat pone Pad that we looked at or\n\n1398\n01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:58,335\ndiscussed a couple times.\n\n1399\n01:17:58,335 --> 01:18:01,695\nIs that pad has, when you purchase it, or\n\n1400\n01:18:01,695 --> 01:18:05,445\nyou make it yourself, there's a couple\nadapters that need to be present.\n\n1401\n01:18:05,445 --> 01:18:09,255\nThere's one for bluetooth that gives you\nthe extended range, and then there's\n\n1402\n01:18:09,255 --> 01:18:14,790\none for Wi-Fi, that's included and\nhelps you do that type of scanning.\n\n1403\n01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:18,530\nAnd you may ask why would you need those\nif that pad already has them built in,\n\n1404\n01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,410\nshouldn't I just use the ones built in?\n\n1405\n01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:27,060\nYou can't because the bluetooth adapter\nbuilt into that pad doesn't support\n\n1406\n01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:31,230\npacket injection so if you're gonna\nbe doing investigations with that and\n\n1407\n01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:34,780\nyou need that capability\nthat one isn't gonna work.\n\n1408\n01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:38,340\nYou have to get an external\none that has that capability.\n\n1409\n01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:42,260\nWhich is why Pony Express people make that\nmake the Pony Paddle actually include that\n\n1410\n01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:46,260\nor if you're gonna build your own will\ntell you this is the one you should get\n\n1411\n01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:49,380\nthat's supported and\nconfigured to work with our equipment.\n\n1412\n01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,200\nAnd it's the same thing with the wireless.\n\n1413\n01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,900\nThere's a wireless or\nWi-Fi card built into that pad.\n\n1414\n01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:59,450\nBut they give you an external one cuz\nthe internal one can't go into monitor\n\n1415\n01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:02,280\nmode and it can't do a couple\nother key things that you need\n\n1416\n01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:06,460\nTo do a proper site survey and\na proper investigation of wireless.= So\n\n1417\n01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:09,810\nyou need to have these\nspecial adaptors present.\n\n1418\n01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:13,620\nAnd that's something that's going to carry\nright on through to everything else.\n\n1419\n01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:16,690\nIf you're gonna be investigating them\nmake sure your equipments compatible.\n\n1420\n01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:20,830\nDo your research cuz there are more than,\nfor example the ones Pony Express\n\n1421\n01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:24,800\nmakes available, in fact those aren't even\ntheirs, those are someone they just happen\n\n1422\n01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,150\nto say hey we'll bundle it with our\nstuff so you have the whole thing.\n\n1423\n01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:32,750\nBut you can but those devices on your own,\nbut they're not the only game in town.\n\n1424\n01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:36,170\nThere are other ones that do the exact\nsame thing, bluetooth and wireless.\n\n1425\n01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,800\nYou get the idea at this point.\n\n1426\n01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:44,670\n>> And then the antennas themselves,\nI'm used to thinking the antenna\n\n1427\n01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:48,700\nthat comes with this car or with this\nadaptor or whatever is perfectly fine.\n\n1428\n01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:53,160\nAnd for everyday use this might be so,\nbut then as a forensic investigator\n\n1429\n01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,450\nI might want to step up my\ngame there a little bit.\n\n1430\n01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:58,810\n>> Yes.\nThat's another important piece of criteria\n\n1431\n01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:02,570\nis to have an external antenna for\nyour wireless.\n\n1432\n01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:06,680\nJust because it's going to improve\nthe reception, it's going to give you\n\n1433\n01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,900\nbetter range in a lot of cases, and\nit's going to improve the sensitivity.\n\n1434\n01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:16,250\nSo while you can get a wireless\nadapter without the external antenna,\n\n1435\n01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:19,614\nit's really recommended that you do that.\n\n1436\n01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:22,143\nJust because it's gonna\nhelp you out tremendously,\n\n1437\n01:20:22,143 --> 01:20:25,976\nwhen you're sweeping an area or you're\ntrying to pinpoint where something is.\n\n1438\n01:20:25,976 --> 01:20:30,249\nThose directional ones and all the special\nones are gonna help you out with that.\n\n1439\n01:20:30,249 --> 01:20:34,687\nYou really want to make sure you have\nthose ones in your corner before you do\n\n1440\n01:20:34,687 --> 01:20:39,626\nany real, real in-depth investigation it's\njust going to be a big time saver and\n\n1441\n01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:44,157\nyou just may not be able to do all the\nstuff you need to with the built in ones.\n\n1442\n01:20:44,157 --> 01:20:48,413\n>> That dipole antennae that comes with\nmost of them is a circular pattern so\n\n1443\n01:20:48,413 --> 01:20:52,947\nthe only way to really try to narrow down\non something is to physically move and\n\n1444\n01:20:52,947 --> 01:20:54,860\nsee if you're getting closer.\n\n1445\n01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:57,630\nIt's like playing hot potato or\nhot and cold.\n\n1446\n01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,270\nYou know?\nHotter, hotter, hotter,\n\n1447\n01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,630\ncolder, colder, colder.\n\n1448\n01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:02,010\nYou know, that kind of thing.\n\n1449\n01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:05,420\nWhereas if I got an external antennae, I\nswap antennaes out and I get me that Yagi\n\n1450\n01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:10,386\nstyle, now I can just here and do this and\nI can PIN right in on that source.\n\n1451\n01:21:10,386 --> 01:21:15,150\n>> Yeah, that's really it.\n\n1452\n01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:19,630\nIt's just the best way to do things to\ngive you that higher degree of accuracy\n\n1453\n01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:21,660\nand pick up where things are.\n\n1454\n01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:25,020\nIf you want,\nyou can in some cases craft your own.\n\n1455\n01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,830\nThat was something we talked about for\nethical hacking.\n\n1456\n01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:28,990\nYou can build your own antennas.\n\n1457\n01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:31,070\nLike can antennas, stuff like that.\n\n1458\n01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:33,220\nI don't know if you really\nwant to do that here.\n\n1459\n01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:37,340\nOn the hacking side of the house,\nthat's fine.\n\n1460\n01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:40,780\nPeople expect hackers\nto be really out there.\n\n1461\n01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:41,620\n>> Creative and free.\n\n1462\n01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:45,085\n>> I've been accused of that a lot\nsince I started coming here to ITPro.\n\n1463\n01:21:45,085 --> 01:21:48,320\n[LAUGH]\n>> Being weird, especially by people in\n\n1464\n01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:52,030\nthe back office over there [LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE] The judge or\n\n1465\n01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:55,900\nthe defense attorneys, they might have\nsomething to say about my cantenna?\n\n1466\n01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:57,020\nThat I made out of that Pringle's can.\n\n1467\n01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,790\n>> Yeah, if you bring a Pringle's\ncan in the courtroom.\n\n1468\n01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:01,920\nThey're going to be all,\nis that a Pringle's can?\n\n1469\n01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,310\nSomebody said in the UK\nthere's a Beans and weenies.\n\n1470\n01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,810\nThere's a brand of beans and\nweenies that you can get.\n\n1471\n01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:10,580\nAnd they said you get that.\n\n1472\n01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:16,510\nAnd it's a right size,\na certain size container.\n\n1473\n01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:19,990\nAnd they said you get that and\n\n1474\n01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:23,180\nit'll extend this certain range\nof wireless out this far.\n\n1475\n01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:27,560\nI don't know how comfortable I'd be\ngoing to court with my Pringle's can and\n\n1476\n01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,030\nmy beans and weenies.\n\n1477\n01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:29,940\n>> Is it a snack?\n\n1478\n01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,780\nAre you hungry?\nWhat are you got going on there.\n\n1479\n01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,960\n>> Yeah.\nIt's like,\n\n1480\n01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,270\nI was just sitting here your honor.\n\n1481\n01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:35,500\nAnd I was eating my Pringles and\n\n1482\n01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:40,536\nthought, after I thought why this company\ndidn't make tennis balls instead of chips.\n\n1483\n01:22:40,536 --> 01:22:43,670\n[LAUGH] people, trust me.\n\n1484\n01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:49,320\nBut, you know, I just figured, you know,\nhey, I'd make an antenna out of it.\n\n1485\n01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:52,230\nIt works,\nyou'll probably get some weird looks,\n\n1486\n01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:55,160\nif you go into to court or\nin an investigation like that.\n\n1487\n01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:58,930\nBut, you know, you've got to explain it,\nbut you know, what the heck.\n\n1488\n01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:05,555\nBut the thing also with those,\nthat stuff aside, the professional ones,\n\n1489\n01:23:05,555 --> 01:23:09,860\nwe call them, those ones were\ndesigned to be more sensitive and\n\n1490\n01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:13,760\nthey're designed specifically for\nthat purpose so it's better to stick\n\n1491\n01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,100\nwith those when you're doing\nsomething like forensics anyway.\n\n1492\n01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,830\nYou know,\noutside of that whole appearance deal.\n\n1493\n01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:22,680\nNow as far as different interchangeable\nantennas and stuff like that, you know,\n\n1494\n01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:23,610\nsome people do that.\n\n1495\n01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:27,850\nThey have different lengths of those\ndipole antennas different types of Yagi\n\n1496\n01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:32,990\nantennas to extend the range\non it to different amounts.\n\n1497\n01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:36,812\nYou could do that if you\nwant to look like, I.\n\n1498\n01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:40,303\n[LAUGH] To me, look, going to a job\nsite as a or either a pen tester or\n\n1499\n01:23:40,303 --> 01:23:41,395\nforensics person.\n\n1500\n01:23:41,395 --> 01:23:43,125\nEspecially a pen tester.\n\n1501\n01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:46,305\nOpening up a case and pulling out\nthe adaptor and screwing the thing on.\n\n1502\n01:23:46,305 --> 01:23:47,196\nIt looks like you're a hit man.\n\n1503\n01:23:47,196 --> 01:23:49,566\n[LAUGH] You're about ready to go.\n\n1504\n01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,067\nYou're like, let's go.\n\n1505\n01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:54,745\n>> I've got my hard hat with my\nthree different antennas coming\n\n1506\n01:23:54,745 --> 01:23:55,475\nout the top there.\n\n1507\n01:23:55,475 --> 01:23:56,595\nI'm ready to look.\n\n1508\n01:23:56,595 --> 01:23:59,295\n>> Look, it's captain high speed there.\n\n1509\n01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:03,220\n>> You know, I was thinking that nothing's\ncooler than having one of those little\n\n1510\n01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:07,887\nminiature parabolic dishes\nsitting on your desk there.\n\n1511\n01:24:07,887 --> 01:24:09,560\n[LAUGH] That's pretty geeky.\n\n1512\n01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,310\nExternal intent is\nthe important part of it so\n\n1513\n01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:15,515\nwe can increase the,\nit's either our range, or our accuracy.\n\n1514\n01:24:15,515 --> 01:24:19,495\nIf we're trying to narrow or find\nsomething instead of a general wireless\n\n1515\n01:24:19,495 --> 01:24:21,345\nsurvey that's going to be important.\n\n1516\n01:24:21,345 --> 01:24:26,415\nOther things that we've mentioned already\nthat I need to make sure it's a good idea\n\n1517\n01:24:26,415 --> 01:24:29,445\nif tools have some type\nof GPS built into them.\n\n1518\n01:24:29,445 --> 01:24:37,170\n>> Yes, that's a very helpful feature to\nhave, for the reasons we talked about\n\n1519\n01:24:37,170 --> 01:24:42,656\nyou want to be able to locate specifically\nwhere a device is and where it resides.\n\n1520\n01:24:42,656 --> 01:24:45,920\nSo, you're going to have\na GPS can really help you\n\n1521\n01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:50,240\nnarrow something down to where it is and\nmap all those things out.\n\n1522\n01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:54,350\nSo you should really have those and\nas we were saying these\n\n1523\n01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:58,390\ntypically aren't built into stuff\nlike laptops and deals like that.\n\n1524\n01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:00,890\nAnd the ones they have in\ntablets a lot of them...\n\n1525\n01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:04,410\nAren't really that accurate, so\nyou may need to go with an external\n\n1526\n01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:07,890\ndevice to really make sure you're\nplaying your cards right and\n\n1527\n01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:10,120\nnot getting inaccuracies in there.\n\n1528\n01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:14,600\nOr, at the very least, if you're going\nto map it out, if it's more accurate,\n\n1529\n01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,820\nit's going to cut down the time it is for\nyou to find that access point.\n\n1530\n01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:22,560\nIf it's inaccurate, you're going to be\nreally kind of going through that area and\n\n1531\n01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,230\nhaving some big Easter egg hunt looking\nfor this thing and I ain't got time for\n\n1532\n01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:30,500\nthat, so you're going to want to\nconsider having that sort of ability.\n\n1533\n01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,070\n>> And it's a dual purpose tool, right?\n\n1534\n01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:35,350\nOnce I've got something with GPS, then I\ncan do my geo caching on the weekend or\n\n1535\n01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:36,350\nwhatever I need to do, right?\n\n1536\n01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:36,990\n>> There you go.\n\n1537\n01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:38,128\nSo what the heck.\n\n1538\n01:25:38,128 --> 01:25:40,370\n[LAUGH]\n>> Fun for the whole family right there.\n\n1539\n01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:44,940\n>> So a lot of things we want to look\nat when we're considering purchasing\n\n1540\n01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:49,900\ntools to keep in our forensics toolkit for\ninvestigating our wireless networks.\n\n1541\n01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:53,170\nAnd then there's some software ones to,\nsome of which we've kind of talked about,\n\n1542\n01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:54,650\nothers that we haven't yet.\n\n1543\n01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,510\nSo, let's take a look at some of those.\n\n1544\n01:25:56,510 --> 01:26:01,100\n>> Yes, the first one I'll just\nmention since it was covered in\n\n1545\n01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:05,910\nthe CEH course would be NESUS but\nwe could expand that out.\n\n1546\n01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:11,340\nThere's a whole bunch of other\nvulnerability scanners out there.\n\n1547\n01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:13,120\nThere is NESUS, there's Nespose,\n\n1548\n01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:17,090\nthere's acunetics,\nthere's just a lot of them out there.\n\n1549\n01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:20,340\nThose would be handy for\ndoing a forensic investigation,\n\n1550\n01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:24,200\nto see where holes might be\nin their wireless system.\n\n1551\n01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,340\nSo if you've used NASA's same deal here.\n\n1552\n01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:31,160\nWe're going to point it toward\nan IP address and do the scan and\n\n1553\n01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:35,620\nto try to get that information out of\nit to see where those weaknesses are.\n\n1554\n01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:39,030\nOr to find a specific client\ntoo to see if there's any, or\n\n1555\n01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:43,740\nwhen we get a client, to kind of\ninvestigate to see what kind what problems\n\n1556\n01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,800\nit might have that may\nhave led to an issue.\n\n1557\n01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:51,440\nYou know, and I put in just\nas kind of a footnote to that\n\n1558\n01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,800\nNessus does have NMap buried inside of it.\n\n1559\n01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,070\nAnd NMap you know,\n\n1560\n01:26:56,070 --> 01:27:00,560\nit hasn't really surfaced in\nthe course of doing our forensics yet.\n\n1561\n01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:06,040\nBut it is also helpful here on wireless\nbecause, you can target a system,\n\n1562\n01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:09,440\nan IP address, and do banner grabs and\nidentify stuff like that.\n\n1563\n01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:13,380\nYeah, there are other ways to do\nbanner grabs, well aware of that, but\n\n1564\n01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:17,220\nyou can do it with Nmap, and do some other\ntypes of scans that may prove helpful,\n\n1565\n01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:21,092\nso it's in Nessus, but\nit's also in other places as well.\n\n1566\n01:27:21,092 --> 01:27:23,550\n>> All right, so we have Nessus, and\n\n1567\n01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:25,880\nanother thing you wanted\nto talk about was that IPA?\n\n1568\n01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:32,420\n>> Yeah, IPA is on MetaGeek's site\nif you want to take a look at that.\n\n1569\n01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:37,740\nIt's one of those ones that I really,\nreally would like to\n\n1570\n01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:42,270\nshow, it's really cool\nlooking if you see it.\n\n1571\n01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:49,765\nAnd Metageek guys, if you're watching,\nI'd like a free copy of your stuff.\n\n1572\n01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:51,360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean promotional copy.\n\n1573\n01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,050\nAll right?\n\n1574\n01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:52,730\nPromotional.\n\n1575\n01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:53,230\nNot free.\n\n1576\n01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:57,520\nBut what IPA is, IPA.\n\n1577\n01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,550\nOne of the things that we've taken a look\nat and we're going to take a look at\n\n1578\n01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:06,380\nhere is their other one, Channelizer,\nwhich is a very handy tool.\n\n1579\n01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:09,120\nBut IPA is our one that allows you,\n\n1580\n01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:13,710\nit kind of displays network\ntraffic as in a donut-type style.\n\n1581\n01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:18,380\nIt allows you to kind of look at, you\nknow, what the traffic is distributed, and\n\n1582\n01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:19,540\nmaybe pick up devices.\n\n1583\n01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,050\nThat's what it's meant for.\n\n1584\n01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:22,845\nIt can pick up hidden devices.\n\n1585\n01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:28,812\nWhich is an awesome capability to have for\nhere.\n\n1586\n01:28:28,812 --> 01:28:34,312\nReason why it's a tough thing to demo,\njust to put it out there And\n\n1587\n01:28:34,312 --> 01:28:38,913\nkeep anybody from wasting\ntime from downloading it not\n\n1588\n01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:43,430\nthat it's not a great product\nbecause I want it free.\n\n1589\n01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:47,940\nIt's a great product I'm not trying\nto sell you or anything on it, but\n\n1590\n01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:52,660\nyou have to have the top of\nthe line AirPcap adapter for it.\n\n1591\n01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:55,616\nYou can't get anything else underneath\nthat's the one that's about- $900 or\n\n1592\n01:28:55,616 --> 01:28:58,250\n$800, so you have to have that.\n\n1593\n01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:02,620\nIf you don't have that,\nit just won't work.\n\n1594\n01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:08,540\nThat's the downside to it, but again,\nif you're doing a forensic investigation,\n\n1595\n01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:13,800\nthat's a very, very important and\nhandy tool to have available.\n\n1596\n01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,580\nI guess I should mention the other one,\n\n1597\n01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:21,980\nbecause I've actually got it up\nhere on my wireless screen you may\n\n1598\n01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:27,210\nhave remembered this from our CH class.\n\n1599\n01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:32,110\nNow, it's, it's this thing,\nthe screen is more dynamic normally.\n\n1600\n01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:36,740\nBut it's fine for here, what this does, if\nyou recall, it actually displays different\n\n1601\n01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:42,420\nfrequencies in here and\nacross the top it will actually\n\n1602\n01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:46,140\nshow interfering frequencies on the\ndifferent channels and different ranges\n\n1603\n01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:50,150\non the bottom it will show distribution\nof different wireless devices.\n\n1604\n01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:54,050\nAnd all this stuff coming\ntogether can help you locate\n\n1605\n01:29:54,050 --> 01:29:57,680\ndevices that are actually out there and\nwhat may be interfering.\n\n1606\n01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:03,940\nSo this can also be one of those things\nthat Is useful to use for doing,\n\n1607\n01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:08,370\nif someone's jamming you or planning that\nkind of attack they've got a cell phone,\n\n1608\n01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:11,270\nnot a cell phone a wireless\njammer out there.\n\n1609\n01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:15,370\nThis could be used for picking that up\nbecause this will definitely pick it up.\n\n1610\n01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:19,030\nBecause this thing has it's own little\nspecial adapter sitting out here\n\n1611\n01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:24,250\nthat is designed specifically to\nlisten across all those ranges and\n\n1612\n01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:25,940\npick them all up simultaneously.\n\n1613\n01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:30,830\nAnd then display them here and tell you,\nhey, this is what I'm seeing and\n\n1614\n01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:35,020\nso once it sees all that,\nyou'll see maybe across a certain range,\n\n1615\n01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:38,610\nsee a big block put on it or\na bunch of noise in there.\n\n1616\n01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:44,560\nAnd then just start narrowing it down\nto where it is and boom, you've got it.\n\n1617\n01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,430\nYou know, so it's a very,\nvery good tool and I'd say it's useful for\n\n1618\n01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:49,420\njust general wireless.\n\n1619\n01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,670\nThat's the cool thing, is this is meant.\n\n1620\n01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:56,360\nTo optimize and\nmanage your wireless network as it is, so\n\n1621\n01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:00,300\nif you're an enterprise level you invest\nin this to make sure that everything's\n\n1622\n01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:01,650\nworking the way it's supposed to and\n\n1623\n01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:05,680\nyou're getting the most performance\nthat you can possibly get.\n\n1624\n01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:08,680\nAnd it's incredibly useful for that, but.\n\n1625\n01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:11,640\nWe can also repurpose it for this and\nthere's different ways you can format and\n\n1626\n01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,900\nwatch the data in here too.\n\n1627\n01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:17,735\nYou know, so I won't bore you with\na whole tutorial on channelizer.\n\n1628\n01:31:17,735 --> 01:31:18,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, yeah,\n\n1629\n01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:21,250\nyou can single out different\nspecific frequencies and\n\n1630\n01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:22,990\ndo specific analysis on that.\n\n1631\n01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:25,700\nYou can store signatures\nof certain devices and\n\n1632\n01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:29,680\nsee if it, magic pattern matching\nto see if it pops up someplace.\n\n1633\n01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,470\nSo there's some really\ncool features in here.\n\n1634\n01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:38,870\nThis is the one I see,\nChannalyzer is pretty much the only one\n\n1635\n01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:43,607\nlike this in this range.\n\n1636\n01:31:43,607 --> 01:31:48,340\nSo I don't see anything that really\ndoes the exact same thing both at that\n\n1637\n01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:52,340\nprice and that and this functionality.\n\n1638\n01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:57,250\nUsually you're gonna pay a lot more,\nso, not a bad idea to have.\n\n1639\n01:31:57,250 --> 01:32:01,370\n>> All right, so some good choices there\nfor our toolkit, things like Netsys,\n\n1640\n01:32:01,370 --> 01:32:06,050\nIPA, Zap Checker was another one\nI think that you had mentioned,\n\n1641\n01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:11,080\nI know we were gonna try and pull up their\nsite, but I think it's down temporarily.\n\n1642\n01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:14,810\n>> Yeah, Zap Checker,\ntheir site is down, but I am gonna,\n\n1643\n01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:20,600\nI've got a magazine article up here on my\nscreen on it showing what Zap Checker is.\n\n1644\n01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,350\nAnd you can see, it's a little handheld\ndevice there, the little Christmas tree\n\n1645\n01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:28,190\nlooking thing sticking out of the top,\nand what this thing does is,\n\n1646\n01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:32,890\nyou can actually use this to sweep\na room to find wireless devices.\n\n1647\n01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:37,531\nNow, they were putting this magazine's\nobviously geared towards the tin-foil\n\n1648\n01:32:37,531 --> 01:32:39,862\nhat wearing people.\n\n1649\n01:32:39,862 --> 01:32:41,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, that's\n\n1650\n01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:42,350\n>> Checking for\n\n1651\n01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:44,990\naliens that might be bugging my\napartment or something like that?\n\n1652\n01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:46,700\n>> Yeah.\n>> But we can also use it for\n\n1653\n01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:47,950\nan investigation, right.\n\n1654\n01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:50,750\nTo help locate wireless\ndevices if we need to.\n\n1655\n01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:53,348\n>> Yeah I'm not saying it's aliens,\nbut it's aliens.\n\n1656\n01:32:53,348 --> 01:32:57,210\n[LAUGH] lf you get the reference,\nextra points.\n\n1657\n01:32:57,210 --> 01:33:00,550\nSo it could be used for that,\n\n1658\n01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:05,560\nyou know, detecting different\ntypes of bugging devices and\n\n1659\n01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:09,820\nstuff like that, but it can also be\nused for what we're talking about here.\n\n1660\n01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:14,190\nIf someone's got a hidden device, like\n\n1661\n01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:18,120\na WiFi pineapple or they've got that mini\nthat we talked about in the CEH course.\n\n1662\n01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:21,100\nThis could be something that\nyou use to sweep a room and\n\n1663\n01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:26,630\nyou just see the needle move around and\njust boom, I'm zeroing in on it.\n\n1664\n01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:32,670\nOnce you've got that then hey, I've got\nevidence someone's trying to spy here or\n\n1665\n01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:37,890\nsomeone's got a mini Dropbox posted\nsome place, you can find those.\n\n1666\n01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:42,180\nAnd remember it's not just those devices,\nit's stuff like raspberry pies and\n\n1667\n01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:46,870\nthings like that so\nyes you could use it for all those things.\n\n1668\n01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:51,300\n>> Anything that's emitting an RO\nsignal whether it's a bug in a room or\n\n1669\n01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:54,270\na camera or a [INAUDIBLE] wireless.\n\n1670\n01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:58,880\nYeah, it's my understanding that\nthis device can pick up a whole\n\n1671\n01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:03,140\nrange of frequency so\nit's not just limited to WiFi.\n\n1672\n01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:06,750\nSo you can use it for\nother things and you know WiFi or\n\n1673\n01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:09,646\nif you're paranoid you can\nuse it to pick up bugs.\n\n1674\n01:34:09,646 --> 01:34:10,490\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1675\n01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:14,930\nThat's the site I found it on was\nactually selling it as a bug detector but\n\n1676\n01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:16,650\nwe can multipurpose that for sure.\n\n1677\n01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:17,260\nYeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1678\n01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:18,270\n>> They're buggin' you.\n\n1679\n01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:19,055\nI mean.\n\n1680\n01:34:19,055 --> 01:34:21,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Whatever your dog tells you is right.\n\n1681\n01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:22,390\nThe government's after you.\n\n1682\n01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:23,765\n>> They are listening.\n\n1683\n01:34:23,765 --> 01:34:24,825\n[LAUGH]\n>> Sir, we are they.\n\n1684\n01:34:24,825 --> 01:34:26,310\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n1685\n01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:29,090\nso we got these different\nwireless forensic tools.\n\n1686\n01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:32,880\nWe also wanna talk about traffic\ncapturing and analysis tools\n\n1687\n01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:36,280\nboth of which I think we've talked\nabout a couple of times doesn't matter.\n\n1688\n01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,890\nWe'll talk about it again.\n\n1689\n01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:43,940\nYeah it always helps to revisit something\nthat we've talked about previously.\n\n1690\n01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:47,380\nIn this case it would be\nnot just Wireshark but\n\n1691\n01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:51,540\nwould also be the AirPcap device and\nAirPcap, like we said,\n\n1692\n01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:56,460\nit's a special adapter put out by\nRiverbed Technologies that allows\n\n1693\n01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:01,830\nyou to view across\nthe whole range of things.\n\n1694\n01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:07,820\nAnd so you put this in your laptop and\nyou go ahead and load up WireShark with\n\n1695\n01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:13,260\nthe appropriate drivers and it will show\nyou stuff at those bottom two layers,\n\n1696\n01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:19,450\nthose physical layers so you can\nsee what's going on and observe it.\n\n1697\n01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:23,770\nYou know,\nobviously not a cheap item to get.\n\n1698\n01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:27,590\nThey have three different levels of\nit you know kind of like the low,\n\n1699\n01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:32,720\nmedium, and super duper whatever.\n\n1700\n01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,156\nYeah don't we all.\n\n1701\n01:35:35,156 --> 01:35:37,159\nThey're not cheap.\n\n1702\n01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:40,390\nThey're not cheap to buy new, but\n\n1703\n01:35:40,390 --> 01:35:45,790\nit's something that it's very, very, very\nuseful, for both pen testing and here.\n\n1704\n01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:51,200\nSo I would consider doing it,\njust a little safety tip for you guys,\n\n1705\n01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:57,750\nto save yourself a few bucks on it, go up\non eBay, they pop up on eBay all the time.\n\n1706\n01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:02,190\n>> If somebody convinced their spouse\nthey could spend $800 on this device and\n\n1707\n01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:04,651\nnow it's like, no we need to sell that.\n\n1708\n01:36:04,651 --> 01:36:07,870\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah, you need to can't do that.\n\n1709\n01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:13,150\nBut they are up there I've\ngot two AirPcap adaptors, and\n\n1710\n01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:18,980\nI bought them off of eBay and\nI bought them for under half price,\n\n1711\n01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:23,388\nand they were perfect no problems what so\never.\n\n1712\n01:36:23,388 --> 01:36:26,988\n>> The lowest one they've got that\ndoes injection that's just B and\n\n1713\n01:36:26,988 --> 01:36:31,045\nG is like $300 and if you want to get N,\nand you would almost have to have\n\n1714\n01:36:31,045 --> 01:36:34,383\nN At this point you really need\nAC to future prove yourself and\n\n1715\n01:36:34,383 --> 01:36:39,950\ngoes up to like $700 and then I don't even\nthink they have one that does AC just yet.\n\n1716\n01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:43,000\n>> Yeah, I don't think have\nthat in their arsenal yet, but\n\n1717\n01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,380\nyou know, they'll get it soon enough.\n\n1718\n01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:48,940\nBut that would be the tip is look on eBay.\n\n1719\n01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:53,440\nLook at places like eBay, if you have\nother places that you buy hardware from\n\n1720\n01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:58,570\nand see if they have it, because there\nreally isn't, on the Windows side,\n\n1721\n01:36:58,570 --> 01:37:02,830\nthere isn't really a comparable\npiece of hardware like AirPcap.\n\n1722\n01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:06,810\nI know, I've looked around for\nstuff before it was like\n\n1723\n01:37:06,810 --> 01:37:09,930\nprobably going with the same thing\na lot of you guys may have been,\n\n1724\n01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:13,880\nit's like I looked at the price and\nI was like, is that right?\n\n1725\n01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:19,590\nThe price is right on their site,\nand so I looked around.\n\n1726\n01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:22,630\n>> Maybe after I've written a couple\nof books, and done a few lectures and\n\n1727\n01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:24,065\nthings like that, but\n>> Yeah.\n\n1728\n01:37:24,065 --> 01:37:26,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, now I'd buy a dozen of them.\n\n1729\n01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:27,490\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1730\n01:37:27,490 --> 01:37:28,320\n>> Cuz I got you suckers,\n\n1731\n01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,488\nI mean people to, no.\n\n1732\n01:37:29,488 --> 01:37:36,200\n[LAUGH] No, I mean,\nit's a big bite to take to pay that\n\n1733\n01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:43,425\nmuch for it so you can always find them\nused and so keep an eye out for them.\n\n1734\n01:37:43,425 --> 01:37:47,575\n>> Yeah, and we've talked way back at our\nbeginning episode about having a budget\n\n1735\n01:37:47,575 --> 01:37:48,455\nfor setting this up.\n\n1736\n01:37:48,455 --> 01:37:51,925\nIt's not like you have to go and\nbuy everything at one time, typically.\n\n1737\n01:37:51,925 --> 01:37:55,655\nIt depends on the type of investigation\nthat you're gonna be doing,\n\n1738\n01:37:55,655 --> 01:37:58,815\nis gonna guide you towards what you need\nto start and you just prioritize and\n\n1739\n01:37:58,815 --> 01:38:02,340\nyou slowly over time build up\nyour little tool kit there,\n\n1740\n01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:06,030\nmaybe you borrow some equipment sometimes,\nrent it sometimes if you need to.\n\n1741\n01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:10,270\nSo there's ways to get it done as\nyou're slowly buying that stuff.\n\n1742\n01:38:10,270 --> 01:38:12,800\n>> I can't even find\nanything on eBay right now.\n\n1743\n01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,995\n>> That's because all our viewers\nright now just bid on all\n\n1744\n01:38:14,995 --> 01:38:16,275\nof them bought them up.\n\n1745\n01:38:16,275 --> 01:38:17,580\n>> Yeah, I hate you guys.\n\n1746\n01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:19,623\n>> [LAUGH] I was thinking the same thing.\n\n1747\n01:38:19,623 --> 01:38:22,443\nWe're all gonna go bid right now and I'm\nnot gonna be able to bid until I get home.\n\n1748\n01:38:22,443 --> 01:38:23,246\nWhat the heck?\n\n1749\n01:38:23,246 --> 01:38:29,824\n>> They show up and it's true all\nthe forensic equipment by the way,\n\n1750\n01:38:29,824 --> 01:38:37,810\nwe've talked about you can find forensic\nequipment up on places like eBay.\n\n1751\n01:38:37,810 --> 01:38:43,420\n>> A lab doesn't need them anymore, or\nthey have surplus, what have you and you\n\n1752\n01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:49,160\ncan get some pretty nice stuff up there\nand save yourself at least some cash.\n\n1753\n01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:52,540\nIn some cases they're still not cheap,\nbut they're cheaper than they were.\n\n1754\n01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:55,940\n>> Especially during your training days,\nyou might not need HC.\n\n1755\n01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:59,220\nI can get away with just studying and\npracticing with A and G, or\n\n1756\n01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,040\nsomething like that.\n\n1757\n01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:03,420\nFinding used ones that people don't\nwant anymore because it doesn't\n\n1758\n01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:08,130\nhave all the protocols and use that as\nyour training and work your way up.\n\n1759\n01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:09,750\n>> Yea that would not be a bad idea.\n\n1760\n01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:15,590\nYou are right, you don't need absolute\nstate of the art.If you've got that type\n\n1761\n01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:21,655\nof black budget with Scott, then hey, you\nknow, more power to you, but most of us.\n\n1762\n01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:23,075\n>> It's amazing how it works, right?\n\n1763\n01:39:23,075 --> 01:39:26,295\nIt goes into red, you just add another\nzero to the end, move everything over.\n\n1764\n01:39:26,295 --> 01:39:27,345\n>> Yeah.\nSee, it's different.\n\n1765\n01:39:27,345 --> 01:39:28,925\nRIght back in the black, how about that?\n\n1766\n01:39:28,925 --> 01:39:32,522\nI mean, it's great if you have those but\nyou don't need state of the art to\n\n1767\n01:39:32,522 --> 01:39:36,052\npractice some of these things or\nreally any of these things.\n\n1768\n01:39:36,052 --> 01:39:40,902\nFor the most part, you don't need to,\nso go ahead and get stuff.\n\n1769\n01:39:40,902 --> 01:39:44,043\nIf you can save yourself some bucks on it,\ngo for it.\n\n1770\n01:39:44,043 --> 01:39:45,838\n>> Some stuff you got any\nequipment you don't need anymore?\n\n1771\n01:39:45,838 --> 01:39:47,196\n>> I wish.\n\n1772\n01:39:47,196 --> 01:39:53,601\nI actually saw not too long ago\na notebook it's the maker of it is,\n\n1773\n01:39:53,601 --> 01:40:01,510\nbut it's a notebook used for\nforensics testing, and it's really cool.\n\n1774\n01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:05,200\nIt's got some unimaginable stuff on it,\nand they were selling it.\n\n1775\n01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:09,820\nIt normally sells for like 55 hundred,\nyou know, brand new, 55 hundred bucks,\n\n1776\n01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:12,990\nbut you could get it off of eBay for\n15 hundred and what's cool about\n\n1777\n01:40:12,990 --> 01:40:17,500\nthat was that the people who were selling\nit was actually the US government.\n\n1778\n01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,600\nThey had actually used it in\ntheir investigations, and said,\n\n1779\n01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,160\nhey, we don't need it anymore,\nand we're getting rid of it.\n\n1780\n01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:26,920\nThey probably had it about a year, and\nsaid here you go we're done with that,\n\n1781\n01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,335\nwe're getting new stuff.\n\n1782\n01:40:28,335 --> 01:40:30,245\nYou know, so keep an eye out.\n\n1783\n01:40:30,245 --> 01:40:30,875\n>> Keep your eyes open.\n\n1784\n01:40:30,875 --> 01:40:32,353\nYeah.\n>> You never know what you're\n\n1785\n01:40:32,353 --> 01:40:33,091\ngoing to find.\n\n1786\n01:40:33,091 --> 01:40:35,575\n>> It's kind of like driving\ndown that country road and\n\n1787\n01:40:35,575 --> 01:40:39,246\nseeing that 1968 Camaro sticking out\nof that barn and nobody has looked at\n\n1788\n01:40:39,246 --> 01:40:42,588\nit in years just keep your eyes open,\nyou never know what you can find.\n\n1789\n01:40:42,588 --> 01:40:47,076\n[COUGH] All right, so a lot of good\ninformation there, talking about\n\n1790\n01:40:47,076 --> 01:40:52,671\ninvestigating these wireless attacks we\ntalked about, just wireless in general,\n\n1791\n01:40:52,671 --> 01:40:58,447\nso we've familiarized ourselves with the\ndifferent protocols and things like that.\n\n1792\n01:40:58,447 --> 01:41:02,444\nWe talked about different types of attacks\nas far as confidentiality, integrity,\n\n1793\n01:41:02,444 --> 01:41:05,470\navailability, authentication,\nauthorization.\n\n1794\n01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:08,390\nWe discussed how do we go\nabout investigating them.\n\n1795\n01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:09,690\nWe talked about how I remember.\n\n1796\n01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:13,540\nIt's a little different we gotta worry\nabout making sure our warrant covers it.\n\n1797\n01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:15,980\nWe get into the wireless world,\nit changes things.\n\n1798\n01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,520\nIf we're at one place and\nthey happen to be\n\n1799\n01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:25,150\npiggy backing on someone elses\nwireless adaptors or wireless network.\n\n1800\n01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:26,296\nDoes our warrant over that?\n\n1801\n01:41:26,296 --> 01:41:31,013\nMaking sure that we're covering all\nour bases there, talked about what\n\n1802\n01:41:31,013 --> 01:41:35,760\nmakes up good forensic tools a couple\nsoftware items that we looked at.\n\n1803\n01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,930\nSome capturing of that traffic and\ntools we can use AirPcap and Wireshark.\n\n1804\n01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:42,370\nSo a lot of good stuff there.\n\n1805\n01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:43,900\nAnything else we want to throw in,\n\n1806\n01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:47,340\ninvestigating our wireless networks or\nattacks?\n\n1807\n01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:53,220\n>> I would throw in to kind of cap\nthis all off is it's a good time,\n\n1808\n01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:55,690\ntoo, if you need to review.\n\n1809\n01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:58,490\nDefinitely go back and look at the CEH,\n\n1810\n01:41:58,490 --> 01:42:03,400\nthe wireless section, because it's\ngonna reap big dividends here.\n\n1811\n01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,960\nIf you don't remember everything in there,\nor\n\n1812\n01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:09,550\nyou just feel you need to go through\nit again, yeah, go through and\n\n1813\n01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:13,870\nlook at that because those are the type\nof attacks that you're investigating and\n\n1814\n01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:19,000\ngonna be seeing just how they occurred and\nwho maybe launched it.\n\n1815\n01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,850\nThere's all the clues are right there,\n\n1816\n01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:26,230\nall the things that we did with them are\nright there so understand those attacks.\n\n1817\n01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:29,270\nUnderstand things like port scanning and\nall of that cuz it's gonna reap dividends\n\n1818\n01:42:29,270 --> 01:42:32,230\nhere in wireless and\nthen the network forensics side.\n\n1819\n01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:35,840\nSo understand the tools that we use there,\nthe techniques of attacks and\n\n1820\n01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,940\ncountermeasures and\nthat will fit in perfectly.\n\n1821\n01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:41,670\nWith this section, and, like I said,\n\n1822\n01:42:41,670 --> 01:42:46,400\nthe network forensic section,\nso just kind of a tip for you.\n\n1823\n01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,320\n>> Very

morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening.\n\n5\n00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:36,911\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,580\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,510\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,920\ndoing pretty good, how about you?\n\n9\n00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,180\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,010\nWe are getting ready to do another\nepisode on our digital forensic\n\n11\n00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,370\ninvestigator series.\n\n12\n00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,480\nAnd in this one, we're going to take\na look at analyzing web applications and\n\n13\n00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,590\ntypes of attacks that we\nmight have to investigate\n\n14\n00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,330\nthrough the course of our careers\nat digital forensic investigator.\n\n15\n00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,320\nSo Shawn, let's start off with talking\nabout, what do we mean by a web attack or\n\n16\n00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,260\na web application attack?\n\n17\n00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,640\n>> Yeah,\nthat is an important detail to get clear.\n\n18\n00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,030\nWe have Web servers and\nwe have Web applications.\n\n19\n00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,580\nWe're talking about the stuff\nsitting on top of the Web server.\n\n20\n00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,770\nYou have the OS,\nthen you have the Web server,\n\n21\n00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,750\nand then you have the Web\napplication sitting on top of that.\n\n22\n00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,170\nYes, the Web server is going to play\ninto what we're investigating here.\n\n23\n00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,010\nBut we're focusing more\non the application side,\n\n24\n00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,510\nbecause that's much more\nof the bigger target.\n\n25\n00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,480\nIt's not to say the web\nserver isn't a target.\n\n26\n00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,740\nJust means that there's usually\nmore valuable data and more\n\n27\n00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,850\naction happening on the application side\nthat makes them much more juicier targets.\n\n28\n00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,410\nFor an attacker, so therefore it's\ngonna be something that we investigate.\n\n29\n00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,230\n>> Right.\nSo they're gonna be\n\n30\n00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,300\nattacking those applications that\nare running on the web server itself, and\n\n31\n00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,200\nwe've gotta be able to recognize that and\nthen turn around and investigate it.\n\n32\n00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,970\nSo we can figure out what the heck\nhappened, who did it, all that good stuff.\n\n33\n00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,890\n>> Yeah,exactly.\n\n34\n00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,790\n>> So what types of attacks.\n\n35\n00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,090\nWhat kinds of forms?\n\n36\n00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,670\nHow do these take shape, I guess?\n\n37\n00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,390\n>> They can take shape in numerous ways.\n\n38\n00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:15,220\nThat's the thing that's kind of exciting\nand kind of scary about it too, is that.\n\n39\n00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,160\nThere's so many different\navenues that someone can take\n\n40\n00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,000\nto attack a web application and\na web server.\n\n41\n00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,880\nAnd there's all different ways that they\ncan take that to the ultimate conclusion\n\n42\n00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,330\nonce they get in.\n\n43\n00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,530\nThat it makes it just something that is-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,940\n>> There's just so much to go.\n\n45\n00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,095\nI can't even explain.\n\n46\n00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:36,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm getting overwhelmed right here.\n\n47\n00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,550\nJust how it is.\n\n48\n00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,190\nI'm so excited and going crazy\nin here just thinking about it.\n\n49\n00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,780\n>> Right?\n\n50\n00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,020\nThere's these little bit of drool\nforming on the side of his mouth.\n\n51\n00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,969\n>> Yeah.\nMouth here.\n\n52\n00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,199\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes!\n\n53\n00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,070\n[LAUGH] Yeah, there's just so\nmany different avenues here.\n\n54\n00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,420\nI mean, we talk about some in the CEH,\nbut that was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n55\n00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,540\nThere's even more\nadvanced taxed about that\n\n56\n00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,680\nthat we're gonna flesh\nout some of those here.\n\n57\n00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,620\nAnd we're gonna see if we can\nfind out if it's something that\n\n58\n00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,440\nyou need to concern yourself with or\nneed to investigate further.\n\n59\n00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,070\nAnd then we're gonna see some of\nthese tools that are gonna help\n\n60\n00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,570\nyou out with that.\n\n61\n00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,510\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah, so it's some really cool stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,250\n>> Good deal.\n\n63\n00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,460\nSo one of the first things that I think of\nwhen people talk about web app attacks or\n\n64\n00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,160\nanyone attacking some type\nof web application is one\n\n65\n00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,900\nof my favorites, SQL injection.\n\n66\n00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,860\n>> Yeah.\nSQL injection is one of the biggest ones\n\n67\n00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,740\nout there.\n\n68\n00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,050\nWell, at least in the web application area\nit's one of the biggest ones out there.\n\n69\n00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,430\nBecause we have that database sitting\nbehind a lot of web applications, and\n\n70\n00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,140\nyou have that SQL language talking to it.\n\n71\n00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,004\nSo what happens is someone exploits\nflaws within the SQL language that have\n\n72\n00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:44,490\nbeen encoded in.\n\n73\n00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,270\nBy someone inadvertently not validating,\nor\n\n74\n00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,900\njust not being aware of all\nthe little mechanics of SQL.\n\n75\n00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,370\nSomeone that does know what they're\ndoing manipulates that through a form.\n\n76\n00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,020\nOr another tool sometimes they can use,\nand\n\n77\n00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,030\nthey get the system to do what they want.\n\n78\n00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,300\nAnd that includes revealing data,\nrevealing configuration information and\n\n79\n00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,930\nthey recall from seeing\nthis previously in CEH,\n\n80\n00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,570\nthey can even map out\na whole network if they want.\n\n81\n00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,400\nThat's possible if those vulnerabilities\nand certain configuration things are made.\n\n82\n00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,030\nThey can go right for the database and\n\n83\n00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,620\nstart interacting with the operations,\nwhich\n\n84\n00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,170\nis a can of worms that is just really\nfrightening when you think about it.\n\n85\n00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,960\n>> That is really scary stuff and,\nas you said, I mean now days.\n\n86\n00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,490\nAlmost all websites are database driven.\n\n87\n00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,750\nWe love that dynamic content,\n\n88\n00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,660\nthe ability to change the page depending\non the user or what they're viewing or\n\n89\n00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,129\nclicking on items in a catalogue and\nbringing up descriptions.\n\n90\n00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,060\nYou name it.\nAll of this\n\n91\n00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,420\ndata has to be stored somewhere that's\nbeing pulled into this website.\n\n92\n00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,120\nTypically a database on a back end or\nan end tier type setup.\n\n93\n00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,890\nSQL injection's when we're\nusing that application.\n\n94\n00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,310\nBecause the application has\nto be able to that back-end.\n\n95\n00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,710\nAnd we're not gonna go into that.\n\n96\n00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,480\nAgain, the details,\ncheck out those CEH episodes,\n\n97\n00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,480\nCertified Ethical Hacker,\nwhere we show you some of those attacks.\n\n98\n00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,280\nHere we're talking about\nform the investigation side.\n\n99\n00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,780\nSo it is definitely something\nwe gotta be aware of,\n\n100\n00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,510\nbecause It's going to be a common\nattack on our web applications.\n\n101\n00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,310\n>> Yes, so you're going to see\nthe more the defensive and\n\n102\n00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,970\ninvestigative side than you\nwill the offensive side.\n\n103\n00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,380\nSo, if you need to understand more of\nthe mechanics of the offensive side\n\n104\n00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,830\nthen that's the CEH.\n\n105\n00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,720\nHere we're going to talk about those,\n\n106\n00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,260\nbut we're going to talk more about how\nwe can on the other side of the fence.\n\n107\n00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,900\nPick it up and do something about it, or\ncollect evidence of it actually happening.\n\n108\n00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,000\n>> All right, so we've got SQL injection\nattacks that our web apps could be\n\n109\n00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,100\nvulnerable to.\n\n110\n00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,390\nAnother very common one is what\nwe call validation attacks, or\n\n111\n00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,110\ninput validation attacks.\n\n112\n00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,500\nYes, those are one that\nsadly happens too often, and\n\n113\n00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,620\nit's a stepping off point\ntowards other attacks.\n\n114\n00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,720\nSQL injections definitely\nstart with a validation or\n\n115\n00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,610\nlack thereof occurring\nin an earlier phase.\n\n116\n00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,900\nSo someone can put code in or\n\n117\n00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,830\nmanipulate something in a field\non a form when they hit submit.\n\n118\n00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,100\nThere's no validation or the wrong\nvalidation's run on it and something gets\n\n119\n00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,750\nthrough and bang, you have something bad\nhappen and that's just not a good thing.\n\n120\n00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,470\nSo you can have it to be\na stepping off point for\n\n121\n00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,430\nSQL injections, but\nother types of attacks too.\n\n122\n00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,470\n>> Buffer overflow\nattacks might start here.\n\n123\n00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,360\n>> Oh definitely.\n\n124\n00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,280\n>> And again if you're unfamiliar,\nanytime you've got input.\n\n125\n00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,840\nAnytime you've got a form on a page\nin an application where a user can\n\n126\n00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,820\ntype in info or data and then click submit\nthat information's got to be sanitized.\n\n127\n00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,260\nIt's gotta be checked to\nmake sure that it's not\n\n128\n00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,980\ngonna cause a problem with\nthe back-end of the application.\n\n129\n00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,450\nIt might be, as you said,\na SQL injection attack,\n\n130\n00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,980\nas I can get that submitted\nback against that database.\n\n131\n00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,230\nOr it could just be a way to try\nto hang up that application.\n\n132\n00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,680\nIf it's expecting me to\ntype in a phone number and\n\n133\n00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,822\nI type in my name, or\nletters that's gonna have a problem.\n\n134\n00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:03,740\nThat back-ends gonna have a problem trying\nto manipulate or store that data or\n\n135\n00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,560\nretrieve that data.\n\n136\n00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,680\nSo validating the input has gotta be done.\n\n137\n00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,450\nWe're gonna take it.\n\n138\n00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,890\nThat's another type of attack that our\napplications are gonna be vulnerable to.\n\n139\n00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,193\nMisconfiguration another\ncommon one unfortunately.\n\n140\n00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:21,160\n>> Yeah misconfiguration is gonna\nbe one of the leading causes for\n\n141\n00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,160\nsomeone to compromise your system because\n\n142\n00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,180\nyou maybe have something that\nyou just don't have a handle on.\n\n143\n00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,470\nOr whoever you're investigating or\nworking with doesn't have a handle on it,\n\n144\n00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,000\nand they make a mistake.\n\n145\n00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,270\nWe see web servers have\nthat problem already,\n\n146\n00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,050\nthen you kind of step it up with a vastly\nmore complicated web application.\n\n147\n00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,150\nAnd then you start throwing\nthings like databases and\n\n148\n00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,850\ntiered architectures, and\nintegrating with other systems, and.\n\n149\n00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,680\nYou can kind of see this is getting\nmore and more intimidating and\n\n150\n00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,478\ncrazy as we go forward.\n\n151\n00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,503\nFortunately, we have tools\nto help us with that, and\n\n152\n00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:03,340\nthat's what I'm gonna kind\nof strive to do here.\n\n153\n00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,790\nAnd in this particular episode, I'm gonna\ntry to show you all these different tools\n\n154\n00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,856\nas we go through the different segments,\nI'm gonna show you some of the things\n\n155\n00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:19,390\nthat can help you or act as a safety net\nor something else that has got your back.\n\n156\n00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,740\nThat can pick up these\nlittle flaws because you're\n\n157\n00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,080\nnot gonna pick them up all of them.\n\n158\n00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,720\nI SQL injections for me, I don't like SQL.\n\n159\n00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,000\nI really don't.\n\n160\n00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,460\nNotice who's doing most of the talking\nin the CH segment on that.\n\n161\n00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,829\nI was like yes, that's very interesting.\n\n162\n00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,939\nYou are right on that.\n\n163\n00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's the thing.\n\n164\n00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,800\nI understand SQL, but\n\n165\n00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,820\nI don't have this type of thing where\nI feel like talking fluently in it.\n\n166\n00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,010\nHowever I have tools that can\nhelp me find those flaws and\n\n167\n00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,410\ndirect someone who does\nhave the expertise.\n\n168\n00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,940\nTake another look at it.\n\n169\n00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,653\nSo, that's what we're gonna\ntry to help you out with so\n\n170\n00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:05,460\nmake these investigations easier.\n\n171\n00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:11,615\n>> Okay, and so, let's talk about real\nworld examples of some of these attacks.\n\n172\n00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:16,190\nCuz I know there's a few out there that\n>> We should probably mention.\n\n173\n00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,260\nJust before I to interrupt you.\n\n174\n00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,550\nBut probably..\n\n175\n00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,050\nMention.\n\n176\n00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,290\nWe're well aware that there's more\nthan those three types of attacks for\n\n177\n00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,720\nweb applications and\njust web servers in general.\n\n178\n00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,790\nYeah, there's way more than that,\n\n179\n00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:35,230\nbut those are like the three\nthat are really mentioned a lot.\n\n180\n00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,980\nIf you want to say the big three, you can.\n\n181\n00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,150\nThere's plenty more.\n\n182\n00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,880\n>> Cross site scripting, which is really\nkind of more towards the web server\n\n183\n00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,910\nitself, I guess, than the applications.\n\n184\n00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n185\n00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,620\nStuff like that.\n\n186\n00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,960\n>> Cookies, and things like that.\n\n187\n00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,350\n>> Yeah, cookie poisoning.\n\n188\n00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,790\nAll sorts of things like that.\n\n189\n00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,950\nThis is just a short list.\n\n190\n00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,230\nJust make sure you're not,\ndo an investigation,\n\n191\n00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,370\nyou're not saying okay, well there's\nonly three you have to worry about.\n\n192\n00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,290\nThose are not the three\nyou have to worry about.\n\n193\n00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,900\nThere are plenty other on the radar, just\nchosen to keep it short by saying these\n\n194\n00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,630\nare some of the ones that you're\nmore likely gonna hit at some point.\n\n195\n00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,510\nCookie poisoning, cross site scripting,\ncross site references,\n\n196\n00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,870\nand all sorts of stuff like that,\nyou're gonna learn of those too, but\n\n197\n00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,980\nthey're probably not as often as those.\n\n198\n00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,380\nSo I just kinda wanted to throw that in.\n\n199\n00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,050\n>> And some of our other things that we've\ntalked about with it in here too for\n\n200\n00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,740\nlike man in the middle attacks.\n\n201\n00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,540\nWaiting until somebody makes a connection.\n\n202\n00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,935\nThat web application then trying\nto slip in the middle there.\n\n203\n00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:34,121\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Section hijacking.\n\n204\n00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:35,570\n>> Yes, session hijacking.\n\n205\n00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,330\nSo a lot of different things\nwe gotta worry about.\n\n206\n00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,360\nAnd these are, we've seen these.\n\n207\n00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,090\nThere's been some big cases in\nthe news recently and in the past.\n\n208\n00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,950\nWhere web applications\nhave come under fire.\n\n209\n00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,920\nAnd been attacked.\n\n210\n00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,780\nAnd cause some serious problems.\n\n211\n00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,811\nProblems that are news worthy.\n\n212\n00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:54,495\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n213\n00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:57,840\n[LAUGH] There's plenty that\nhave been news worthy.\n\n214\n00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,280\nEven today, I've seen some\ntoday that have just been spit\n\n215\n00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,180\nout that are interesting,\nthat have happened.\n\n216\n00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,067\nWe were talking about this article\nI saw before we came on here,\n\n217\n00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:20,289\nis the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas and\nSally Beauty Supply,\n\n218\n00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:24,956\nit's like a cosmetology or\nwhatever Type Store,\n\n219\n00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:30,533\nthose two stores, or the hotel and\nthe store were hit with.\n\n220\n00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:34,533\nPretty big data breaches of credit card\nnumbers, customer information, CVV\n\n221\n00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:39,210\nnumbers, the verification codes on back,\nexpiration dates, everything you need.\n\n222\n00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:44,280\nTo steal an identity,\nwas taken out of their systems.\n\n223\n00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,000\nThat's significant.\n\n224\n00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,130\nThat's still unfolding.\n\n225\n00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,780\nThey said in the case of\nthe Hard Rock Hotel, that actually\n\n226\n00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,050\nhappened between September of last year\nand April second of this, my birthday.\n\n227\n00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,320\nApril second, wasn't me, so.\n\n228\n00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,652\nAll festivities have been called off.\n\n229\n00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:04,011\n>> [LAUGH] It was the logic\n[CROSSTALK] there.\n\n230\n00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:07,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On my birthday,\n\n231\n00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,000\n>> Yes, there shall be mass celebrations.\n\n232\n00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,040\nBut it, those ones are significant.\n\n233\n00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,560\nThe interesting thing to me when\nI think about that is Hard Rock,\n\n234\n00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,430\nthat's in Vegas,\nthat security is a big deal for\n\n235\n00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,120\nthe financial and all that and\nthey had that sort of breech.\n\n236\n00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120\nI can't think of the last time I've\nheard of something on that scale happen\n\n237\n00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,290\nthere and\nthis is a pretty significant scale.\n\n238\n00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,648\nI mean, right now they're only\ntalking about 25,000 records.\n\n239\n00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:37,763\nBut, only 25,000.\n\n240\n00:12:37,763 --> 00:12:38,798\n>> That's what they admitted to so far.\n\n241\n00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:41,097\n>> Yeah,\nit is what they've admitted to but\n\n242\n00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:44,060\nit just goes to show you it\nhappens to the best of them.\n\n243\n00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,250\nSomeone got them between that\nrange over that period of time,\n\n244\n00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,570\nand just to put that in\nthe context of Vegas.\n\n245\n00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,570\nIn an industry that has.\n\n246\n00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:58,870\nSo many controls and things in place\nto prevent this sort of thing,\n\n247\n00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:04,500\nthat they had it happen, kind of it\nshould bring you back to reality,\n\n248\n00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,880\nand make you realize who you\nmight actually be working with,\n\n249\n00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,880\nboth as a pen tester and\nas an investigator.\n\n250\n00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,680\nCuz you bet that they've already\ngot investigators on site.\n\n251\n00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,570\nI know that they've got it,\npeople for lawyers are eventually,\n\n252\n00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,600\nfrom the people trying to file suit\nagainst them are gonna have it.\n\n253\n00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,240\nAnd then there's also\nthe Nevada gaming commission.\n\n254\n00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,570\nThat's a casino,\nthey're gonna have their own people,\n\n255\n00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,240\ntheir own boots in the ground in\nthere too so there's gonna be a lot\n\n256\n00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,190\nof people investigating that incident\nto see just how it happened.\n\n257\n00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,700\nSo not just their IT people, not just\noutside IT people or investigators but\n\n258\n00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,740\nalso from these other,areas as well\nto see, how the heck happened.\n\n259\n00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,430\nAnd heck, who knows?\n\n260\n00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,940\nThey may even have them\nat other casinos too.\n\n261\n00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,670\nThe gaming commission could say go\nto other casinos in that state and\n\n262\n00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,050\nsay this happened there, and\nwe found out what happened there.\n\n263\n00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,680\nNow we have to go to other places.\n\n264\n00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,330\nAnd who knows, maybe it's credit cards?\n\n265\n00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,160\nIt's PCI, DSS stuff.\n\n266\n00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,229\nIt's payment cards industry,\nwe did say credit cards.\n\n267\n00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:01,684\n>> Absolutely.\nAnd then some others,\n\n268\n00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:05,649\nI think Sony comes to the top my mind when\nwe thing about these big data breaches\n\n269\n00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,004\nthat happened recently.\n\n270\n00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:12,830\n>> Yeah, Sony has been,\nthey've been nailed so.\n\n271\n00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,850\nSo many times.\n\n272\n00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,660\nI don't even know if I have\nenough fingers to count on.\n\n273\n00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:23,330\nOver the last four years or so\nthey've been hit by numerous attacks.\n\n274\n00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,070\nBoth of their web applications,\none of them actually was\n\n275\n00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:32,040\ncaused by sequel injection, a known\nsequel injection that they didn't fix.\n\n276\n00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,160\nThen they had other ones too.\n\n277\n00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,680\nI mean, they had the ones last year that\nwere suspected of coming from North Korea.\n\n278\n00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,200\nSome of those did actually\ncompromise e-mail systems and\n\n279\n00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,250\nsome of their web servers as well as\nsome of their control structure so,\n\n280\n00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,230\nthat's one really,\nreally good example of it.\n\n281\n00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,970\n>> Let's see what else we got.\n\n282\n00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,629\nHome Depot, I think we mentioned\nthat already, Amazon has been hit,\n\n283\n00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:58,862\nFacebook has been hit.\n\n284\n00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:01,867\nI mean really, you can probably just\ngo through the list of the big guys,\n\n285\n00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,210\nthey're big targets, right?\n\n286\n00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,439\nSo, there's constant\nattacks on these guys and,\n\n287\n00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,630\nit's no wonder that some of\nthem succeed now and again.\n\n288\n00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,490\n>> Yeah, Facebook, it's kind of\ninteresting, Facebook got hit by one of\n\n289\n00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,640\nthe ones I think of to show you the white\nhat side of things, is somebody\n\n290\n00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,850\ndid an analysis on their site and found\nout there were some vulnerabilities that\n\n291\n00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,600\nlet them post to other people's pages even\nif they didn't have permission to do it.\n\n292\n00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,750\nAnd I know I'm kind of\nleaving some stuff out.\n\n293\n00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,540\nYou can look at it online.\n\n294\n00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,730\nSomeone actually posted after telling\nFacebook that they had this vulnerability,\n\n295\n00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,300\nFacebook said yeah, yeah,\ngo away kid you bothering me.\n\n296\n00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,973\nThat kind of attitude.\n\n297\n00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:43,538\nThis person actually posted something\non Mark Zuckerberg's homepage.\n\n298\n00:15:43,538 --> 00:15:44,327\n>> Oh really?\n\n299\n00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:45,442\n>> Yeah, he pasted something on there.\n\n300\n00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:47,227\n[LAUGH]\n>> You gonna pay attention\n\n301\n00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:47,786\nto me now, Mark?\n\n302\n00:15:47,786 --> 00:15:49,270\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh yeah,\n\n303\n00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,540\nthey got a lot of attention really quick.\n\n304\n00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,850\nIt wasn't anything profane or\nanything else.\n\n305\n00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,956\nLike the person's saying hey, look what I\ndid, just thought I'd get your attention,\n\n306\n00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,470\nand yeah he got some attention.\n\n307\n00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:05,528\nThose are some really, really, Unwelcome\nattention, so it was interesting.\n\n308\n00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:07,745\nI think the guy who did it\nwas from Egypt or something.\n\n309\n00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:08,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He did it from there.\n\n310\n00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,940\nSo, it was just outside\nthe reach of Facebook.\n\n311\n00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,950\nThey're just reaching through,\nwe're gonna do whatever to you,but,\n\n312\n00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,370\nthey found a vulnerability and\nthen Amazon when IT comes to mind\n\n313\n00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,640\nthey found a vulnerability in a way\nthey store passwords at one point.\n\n314\n00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,230\nBecause they were storing\nthem in a hashed format,\n\n315\n00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,660\nwhich really doesn't come as any surprise.\n\n316\n00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,350\nBut the hashed format was an older\nformat that could easily be reversed.\n\n317\n00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:41,430\nSo what happened is that,\nwhen someone found that and\n\n318\n00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,870\nAmazon was concerned that people's\npasswords had been compromised.\n\n319\n00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,430\nThe fix for it was, on their side, they\nimplemented a new hashing algorithm and\n\n320\n00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,680\ntold everyone just go in and\nchange your password.\n\n321\n00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,780\nAnd it will hash and\nuse the new algorithm automatically.\n\n322\n00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,800\nPeople that had had accounts\nbefore that date, or\n\n323\n00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,640\nfrom the very beginning of Amazon even\nthey were using the older algorithm.\n\n324\n00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,170\nThe people who had accounts after that\ndate were being set up with the new\n\n325\n00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,960\none, and so if you hadn't changed\nyour password in a while like they\n\n326\n00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,540\ntell you to do,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n327\n00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,870\n>> You were stored in the old format.\n\n328\n00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,040\n>> I'm trying to think of when the last\ntime, I changed my password was.\n\n329\n00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,030\n>> Yeah.\n>> Of course I never even log on.\n\n330\n00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,860\n>> Yeah, we can take a pause right here,\nif you need to fix that.\n\n331\n00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,005\n>> Yeah, let me go fix that real quick.\n\n332\n00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:18,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n333\n00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,950\nI know somebody in our chatroom there,\nMichaela thanks,\n\n334\n00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,980\nposted that link for\nbreach index or breach level index.\n\n335\n00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,580\nAnd I've got another one from Huffington\nPost very similar to that I think.\n\n336\n00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,590\nI hate Huffington as far as their\nads they've got all over the page.\n\n337\n00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,030\nI apologize for that, but\n\n338\n00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,340\nit is an interesting look at\nsome of the top 50 breaches.\n\n339\n00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,610\nAnd things like Sony didn't\neven make the top ten.\n\n340\n00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,300\nSo, there's others out there that and\nare just huge.\n\n341\n00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,100\nSo take a look at those,\njust some good interesting reading there.\n\n342\n00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,300\n>> From what I hear,\nSony's gonna try again next year so.\n\n343\n00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,950\n>> They were disappointed\nthey didnt make another list.\n\n344\n00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,240\n>> Yeah, they're working out and\neverything else, getting pumped up.\n\n345\n00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,380\nThey got that rocky song playing and\nall that.\n\n346\n00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know this one,\n\n347\n00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,900\nGuido said Hard Rock's\nbeen hit a few times.\n\n348\n00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,800\nI haven't paid attention to that so\nthey've been they've been hit a few times\n\n349\n00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,470\nor maybe you've seen Ocean's 11 or\nwhatever a few times.\n\n350\n00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,330\nI don't know.\n\n351\n00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,090\nIs that the movie?\n\n352\n00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,870\nI have no idea.\n\n353\n00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,800\n>> Yeah.\n\n354\n00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,860\n>> But\nlet me actually kinda wire cuz Mike,\n\n355\n00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,410\nyou put that website and\nCaleb put the other one.\n\n356\n00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,140\nLet me kinda show you\none on my notebook here,\n\n357\n00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,750\nanother one that maybe helpful to you or\ninteresting to you.\n\n358\n00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,370\nThis is kind of a,\nthis is just a bubble diagram, and\n\n359\n00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,310\nwhat it's showing is it's showing\ndifferent attacks by scale,\n\n360\n00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,090\nand so\nwe see some different companies up there.\n\n361\n00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,570\nNow, it's showing, or different entities\nI guess is a better way to put it.\n\n362\n00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,550\nCuz it's not all corporate entities.\n\n363\n00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:51,710\nIt's also governments and\nutilities and stuff like that.\n\n364\n00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,060\nIt's showing you a number of,\n\n365\n00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,230\nthe number of records based\non the size of the bubble.\n\n366\n00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,330\nAnd some of the bubbles you can see\nactually do have numbers on them.\n\n367\n00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,970\nSo you can see some pretty big ones.\n\n368\n00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,970\nYou can see Anthem, the Health\ncare company here in the states.\n\n369\n00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,520\n80 million records compromised,\nHome Depot 56 million.\n\n370\n00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:19,240\nJP Morgan Chase 76 million,\nyou're seeing quite eBay 145 million.\n\n371\n00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,400\n>> 145 million.\n\n372\n00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:27,680\n>> Yeah, it's mind numbing when you\nthink about something like this.\n\n373\n00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,880\nWhat I like about this one is you can\nactually click on the different filters,\n\n374\n00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,240\nand it will actually tell you which\nones were done by either being hacked or\n\n375\n00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,570\nthrough other means.\n\n376\n00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,860\nSo you got hacked, you got inside job.\n\n377\n00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,210\nIn here, you can kind of start\nfiltering things down and\n\n378\n00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,170\nsay this is who created it.\n\n379\n00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,790\nThere's Korea Credit Bureau.\n\n380\n00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,545\nGlad I got my account out of there early.\n\n381\n00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:54,010\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's an interesting page because\n\n382\n00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,550\nI know we don't see it maybe up here on\nour view, but these bubbles are actually\n\n383\n00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:01,220\nmoving around, and kind of scaling\nas other attacks are out there.\n\n384\n00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,960\nSo, kind of neat cute little page.\n\n385\n00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,455\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah, if you hover\nover them, they will take you to,\n\n386\n00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:08,637\nand you can click On.\n\n387\n00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:12,094\nSome of them to see,\nwhat they're talking about and\n\n388\n00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:15,140\nwhat the nature of this actually is?\n\n389\n00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,440\nSo, really good resource.\n\n390\n00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,480\nIt's kind of interesting\nto see if you look at this.\n\n391\n00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,620\nWhere is it?\n\n392\n00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,740\nWhat would Sony be under?\n\n393\n00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,820\n>> Sony PSN.\n\n394\n00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,970\nI see 77 million.\n\n395\n00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,240\nOn that one.\n\n396\n00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,010\nThat was on Playstation Network.\n\n397\n00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,590\n>> That's not good.\n\n398\n00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,270\nSee what else.\n\n399\n00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,220\nWashington Post right there under media.\n\n400\n00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,770\nSo US military 76 million.\n\n401\n00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,471\n>> Yeah,\n[CROSSTALK] everybody has these things.\n\n402\n00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:50,431\nSo another good way of visualizing it,\nand we could get into probably a number\n\n403\n00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:54,016\nof the things on here when\nwe're looking at this thing,\n\n404\n00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:56,180\nif you look at it in all its glory.\n\n405\n00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,880\nIf we clicked on any number of these,\nI'm sure probably\n\n406\n00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,180\na majority of those maybe not\nprobably not all of them.\n\n407\n00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,800\nDefinitely not all of them, but\n\n408\n00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,160\na good number of it would be through\nthe compromise of web applications.\n\n409\n00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,670\nPeople on the outside going through,\nand extracting information from it.\n\n410\n00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,640\nYeah, there's ones that people\nare doing through inside jobs.\n\n411\n00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,040\nYou can filter on here on inside jobs and\nlook at that.\n\n412\n00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,820\nBut, there is other things in there,\ntoo, that people have done.\n\n413\n00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,230\nYou can see stolen computers,\nstolen media, poor security.\n\n414\n00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,670\nThat would be for poor policy part.\n\n415\n00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,140\nI know that was another\none that Sony got hit on.\n\n416\n00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,060\nThey just had poor security policies.\n\n417\n00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,850\nIt was published that they had poor\nsecurity policies after the fact.\n\n418\n00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,610\nSo we've got a bunch of\nstuff that's in play here,\n\n419\n00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,310\nbut probably a good number of it\nwould be through web applications.\n\n420\n00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,290\nIf we started clicking on all of them and\n\n421\n00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,430\ntaking notes we could probably figure\nout that that's about what we have.\n\n422\n00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,040\n>> Absolutely.\n\n423\n00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,620\nAnd the further thing is the web is\nthe The portal that most people go through\n\n424\n00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,000\nbecause it's the access point, right?\n\n425\n00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,270\nIt's, we talk about,\nyou take any organization and, me,\n\n426\n00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,200\nfrom here,\nhow can I access that company's network?\n\n427\n00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,720\nWhat's exposed to the public.\n\n428\n00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,950\nAnd they're web servers right?\n\n429\n00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,860\nWeb servers, mail servers, DNS servers.\n\n430\n00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,150\nSo that web server becomes that\ngateway into their network,\n\n431\n00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:24,380\nwhich is why it's such a big target for\nthese attacks and why it\n\n432\n00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:30,110\nis gonna be part of our investigation, or\ntypically is part of our investigation.\n\n433\n00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,650\n>> That's what people\nthink about now days.\n\n434\n00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,050\nWhen they think about a company,\nthey think about that website.\n\n435\n00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,720\nIt's like,\nlet me see what their website is.\n\n436\n00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,910\nI mean we did that in our\nfootprint in the CEH,\n\n437\n00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,490\nthe website was right\nthere at the beginning.\n\n438\n00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,980\nSo, it would make sense that anybody\nelse would do the same thing,\n\n439\n00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,510\nwould focus in on that website\nas what they wanna strike at.\n\n440\n00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:55,700\nAnd we saw there's plenty of ways you\ncan get information about a website.\n\n441\n00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,680\nWe have Nmap, we had Netcraft.\n\n442\n00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680\nYou have things like Who is.\n\n443\n00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,100\nWe have Nessism.\n\n444\n00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,020\nYou go on and on about all the tools\n\n445\n00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,540\nthat are available to go through\nweb servers and web applications.\n\n446\n00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,100\nSo It's the thing, and\nI'd also add into this,\n\n447\n00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,480\nit's something that happens with really\nany big company, and most of these were\n\n448\n00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,350\nbig business entities on my screen here\nand the ones on your links in there.\n\n449\n00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:31,460\nThose are big companies have that saying,\ngo large or go home.\n\n450\n00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,660\nThat's the way they are.\n\n451\n00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,330\nLet's make biggest thing we can,\n\n452\n00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,300\nsplashiest thing we can,\nthat's what they're concerned with.\n\n453\n00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,002\nThey're not concerned about security as\nmuch as they were with like let's shove as\n\n454\n00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:46,954\nmany features in there to make ours look\nbetter than the other guys as we can.\n\n455\n00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:50,086\nAnd in the back of their mind,\nif it's there at all,\n\n456\n00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:54,930\nis someone saying I need to figure out how\nto secure that, and how to tweak it, and\n\n457\n00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,013\nhow to make sure everything's\nwhere it should be?\n\n458\n00:23:58,013 --> 00:23:59,289\nThey're like, just make it work.\n\n459\n00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:00,567\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Exactly.\n\n460\n00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:01,658\n>> Just start throwing money at it.\n\n461\n00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:02,657\n>> We've all been there.\n\n462\n00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:04,491\nThe bosses are saying roll it out.\n\n463\n00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:05,477\nCan we do it today?\n\n464\n00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,043\nI wanna have yesterday.\n\n465\n00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:09,238\nWell, it's not quite finished,\nit's not quite polished.\n\n466\n00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:09,828\nWe still might.\n\n467\n00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:11,164\n[SOUND] Get it out there.\n\n468\n00:24:11,164 --> 00:24:12,928\nWe'll deal with that.\n\n469\n00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:14,984\nHopefully it wont happen and\nwe'll just deal with it when it does.\n\n470\n00:24:14,984 --> 00:24:17,650\n>> Yeah you're just worrying about it.\n\n471\n00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,290\nI've heard that one numerous times like\noh you're just worrying too much or\n\n472\n00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,460\nyou're paranoid.\n\n473\n00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,320\nAnd I've been accused of a lot, and\n\n474\n00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,820\nas far as the pen testing stuff we're\nlooking at that side of it when I've.\n\n475\n00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,250\nFound holes in something.\n\n476\n00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,820\nSomeone says hey well your\npanicking about it or\n\n477\n00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,400\nyour being paranoid,\nwhen I tell them about this that's where I\n\n478\n00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,950\nin the pen-tensing sense hey sign\nthe paperwork saying I told yeah.\n\n479\n00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,437\nYou can think what I\nsaid is utter garbage but\n\n480\n00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:51,633\nsign the paperwork for it or\nat least note that I briefed you on it.\n\n481\n00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:53,929\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then they come back\n\n482\n00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:55,260\n>> And if it does happen\n\n483\n00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,620\n>> I told you so.\n\n484\n00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,360\n>> Yeah, it's like look what I got.\n\n485\n00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,210\nI don't want it to come back on me.\n\n486\n00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:03,040\nI really sincerely hope that I am\nwrong and they don't get nailed and\n\n487\n00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,900\nget their stuff stolen.\n\n488\n00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,880\nBecause it's not just someone behind\nthat's setting up throwing money at it,\n\n489\n00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,080\nit's all their customers, too.\n\n490\n00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,980\nAnd they had nothing to do with it,\nthey were trusting this person.\n\n491\n00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,780\nBut if it does,\nI don't want it coming back on me.\n\n492\n00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,100\nSo just be prepared.\n\n493\n00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,810\n>> It just happens.\n\n494\n00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,569\nI think in just the last year Bank\nof America has sent me two different\n\n495\n00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,400\nDebit card slash credit cards, and not\nbecause Bank of America has been attacked,\n\n496\n00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,030\nbut because some place that I\nmight have used my card at,\n\n497\n00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,380\ntheir database has been breached.\n\n498\n00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,030\nTheir Web application, some place\nI've bought something online, and\n\n499\n00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,750\nthey've been breached and so\nthey're sending me a new card.\n\n500\n00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,760\nAnd, Bank of America is fantastic,\nlove them but,\n\n501\n00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,990\nit just shows you that this stuff is\nhappening all the time, big companies,\n\n502\n00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:50,260\nlittle companies, it's the way to get this\nis to attack their Web applications cuz\n\n503\n00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,450\nthat's where their vulnerabilities are and\nit's also where they're exposed the most.\n\n504\n00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,737\n>> Like how you said that\nBank of America is great.\n\n505\n00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:56,606\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n506\n00:25:56,606 --> 00:25:59,332\n>> I'm Earl your san metageek,\nbest stuff out there, get free stuff,\n\n507\n00:25:59,332 --> 00:26:00,610\nyou're trying not to get sued.\n\n508\n00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,037\n>> I know right.\n\n509\n00:26:02,037 --> 00:26:08,417\n[LAUGH] We talked about some of the forms\nthat these Web app attacks might take,\n\n510\n00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:14,640\nlike SQL injection, validation\ninput failures, mis-configuration.\n\n511\n00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,700\nWe've talked about some\nof the big examples,\n\n512\n00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,950\ngiven you a couple of links to where\nyou can get a look at all these\n\n513\n00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,800\ndifferent breaches that are going\non via these Web applications.\n\n514\n00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,530\nLet's talk a little bit about the\narchitecture behind these Web applications\n\n515\n00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,140\nso we can understand.\n\n516\n00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,560\nWhy this is possible, or\nhow this is happening.\n\n517\n00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,940\n>> Yes,\nit's really to kind of simplify things,\n\n518\n00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,740\nbecause all Web applications\nare a little different.\n\n519\n00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,650\nEven among-st versions\nthey're a little different.\n\n520\n00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:49,930\nWe can typically break them into\nthree layers, more or less.\n\n521\n00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:54,480\nWe have the user layer, where people\nwill interact and provide data and\n\n522\n00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,810\nhave data presented back to them however.\n\n523\n00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:03,070\nThat can be anything from just a form\non a website that they type in,\n\n524\n00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,070\nit goes and submits back could be just\na box that they type something in that\n\n525\n00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,930\nbrings back results.\n\n526\n00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:13,230\nOr it goes into a database in\nthe back end, anything like that.\n\n527\n00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,870\nBut it could also be\nstreaming information too.\n\n528\n00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,930\nIt could be video, Netflix, for\nexample, would be a Web application.\n\n529\n00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,290\nMicrosoft has a IP Tv.\n\n530\n00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,240\nThat's another Web application.\n\n531\n00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,290\nJust taking a different form, but that's,\nthere's that user layer that you interact\n\n532\n00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,020\nwith whether it's through a remote,\nthrough a form or through something else,\n\n533\n00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,260\nmaybe even something on your\ncellphone an app on your cell phone.\n\n534\n00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,530\nYou have a way of interacting with it.\n\n535\n00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,520\nAnd that would be the user layer,\nthat's where you sit.\n\n536\n00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,430\nBut there are other layers in there too.\n\n537\n00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,010\n>> Right.\n\n538\n00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,820\nYeah so we've got some vulnerabilities\nthat might take place at that user\n\n539\n00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,510\nlayer itself like my input validation.\n\n540\n00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,860\nAnd then we've got that next level.\n\n541\n00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,960\nWe usually call it like N tier\nbecause it can be several tiers.\n\n542\n00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,010\nSometimes it's just a front end and\na back end.\n\n543\n00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,360\nSometimes we got that middle layer and\n\n544\n00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,800\nthat middle layer is usually where\nthe things are getting processed.\n\n545\n00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,740\nOur business rules are being applied.\n\n546\n00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,060\n>> Yes.\nThat would be it.\n\n547\n00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,040\nBusiness rules, business logic.\n\n548\n00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,140\nSometimes they call it they're both used.\n\n549\n00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,560\nThat's what we see in that middle\ntier in this specific situation.\n\n550\n00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,750\nOr, yeah,\nthe more correct term would be n-tier.\n\n551\n00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,660\nSo you've got that form too.\n\n552\n00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,210\nBut there's that here we\ntypically have a layer in there or\n\n553\n00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,680\nsomewhere where business\nlogic's being applied.\n\n554\n00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,150\nMaybe it's a separate letter like this,\nmaybe it's pushed in someplace else.\n\n555\n00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,140\nBut that's where, kind of like,\nthe heavy lifting, gets done.\n\n556\n00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,920\nIt transforms and manipulates data in\nhowever it has to be going back and forth.\n\n557\n00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,540\n>> Right.\n\n558\n00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,750\nAnd in that final layer in the back end,\nwhich a lot of times is the ultimate goal\n\n559\n00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,880\nof these attacks to get to,\nis that database layer.\n\n560\n00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,310\n>> Yeah,\nthe database represents that nice,\n\n561\n00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,510\njuicy target that a lot of attackers\njust want to sink their teeth into.\n\n562\n00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,270\nSo that's, when we call the database,\nsometimes we call it the back end.\n\n563\n00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:06,390\nIt's sitting way back there behind,\nseveral layers and it's all hardened and\n\n564\n00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,700\nprotected so\nit's not as easy to get a direct line to.\n\n565\n00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,340\nSo we're trying to do whatever we can to\nkeep people from getting to that target.\n\n566\n00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,210\nIf they do, then that's a big,\nbig problem.\n\n567\n00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,850\nAs we've seen with the people\non the diagram I brought up, or\n\n568\n00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,650\nany other links in there,\nthat's what they were going after.\n\n569\n00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,350\nWhether it was someone that\nwas leaking the information or\n\n570\n00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,560\ndoing a SQL injection or taking\nadvantage of input validation, anything.\n\n571\n00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,110\nThey were typically going after the\ndatabase either as the ultimate goal or\n\n572\n00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,080\nin some cases to get out to\nthe operating system itself.\n\n573\n00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,450\nSo that's what we have sitting on the back\nend, usually some form of database.\n\n574\n00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,190\n>> Yeah.\nAnd so that Web application,\n\n575\n00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,100\nthe vulnerabilities in that\nare not protecting that.\n\n576\n00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,980\nKinda opens up those next two layers,\nwhere I can maybe take advantage of that.\n\n577\n00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,810\nAnd as a forensics investigator,\n\n578\n00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,490\nwe've gotta understand the way\nthis architecture works.\n\n579\n00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,800\nCuz we might see that attack taking\nplace at that application layer,\n\n580\n00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,200\nat that user layer.\n\n581\n00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,940\nBut the actual target of the attack\ncould have been a back end that's\n\n582\n00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,870\na completely different server\nin a different location.\n\n583\n00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,320\nSo we've gotta make sure we understand\nthe way these guys are set up so\n\n584\n00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,900\nwe can do a proper investigation.\n\n585\n00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,830\n>> And trust me when I say it,\nthese different layers,\n\n586\n00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:27,590\nno matter how many different tiers\nyou have, no matter what the system\n\n587\n00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:33,340\nis, knowing what layers are out there and\nhow they interact,\n\n588\n00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:39,210\ntremendously beneficial because that will\ndirectly impact how you investigate.\n\n589\n00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,120\nThere's a very specific way of\ninvestigating Web applications.\n\n590\n00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,870\nAnd that relies partially on knowing\nwhat these different layers are and\n\n591\n00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,050\nwhat they're doing.\n\n592\n00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:54,370\nIf you have four layers, five layers,\nwhatever you happen to have,\n\n593\n00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,920\nit's knowing what's out there and being\nable to get that information can tell you\n\n594\n00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,550\nwhich way you're gonna\nprocess this crime scene.\n\n595\n00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,930\nThis incident scene or what have you.\n\n596\n00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,080\nYeah, you really need to\nhave a grasp on that.\n\n597\n00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,900\nI would say for right now,\nthese three layers,\n\n598\n00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:17,300\njust kind of understanding that is okay to\nunderstand that you have different layers.\n\n599\n00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,530\nI put three in there just because it's the\nthree basic ones, but there could be more.\n\n600\n00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,460\nSo just know that that's\nthe case when you're talking.\n\n601\n00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,910\nEnterprise level Web applications.\n\n602\n00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,310\nAnd it could exist in the other ones,\nbut enterprise,\n\n603\n00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,300\nyou're pretty much gonna\nhave it happen there.\n\n604\n00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,160\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nlooking at the clock, it's about time for\n\n605\n00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,630\nus to step away and take a break,\nso we're gonna step back.\n\n606\n00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,490\nAnd when we come back, we're gonna\ncontinue on with our discussion of\n\n607\n00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,315\nWeb applications, so stay tuned.\n\n608\n00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:44,544\nWe'll be right back.\n\n609\n00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:51,939\n[MUSIC]\n\n610\n00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:54,144\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n611\n00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:58,231\nSo continuing on our discussion with\nour analyzing Web applications,\n\n612\n00:31:58,231 --> 00:32:01,431\nwe're going to take a look at,\nthe Web applications and\n\n613\n00:32:01,431 --> 00:32:05,126\nthen the servers that those guys\nrun on here in our next segment.\n\n614\n00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:08,029\nLet's talk again, we mentioned\nthis briefly at the beginning.\n\n615\n00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:14,150\nThe difference between Web App versus\nWeb Server, at least in this context.\n\n616\n00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,646\n>> Yeah there is definitely\na difference between the two.\n\n617\n00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:22,100\nThere is, what I was illustrating\nyou kind of visualize it as a stack.\n\n618\n00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,400\nYou have the Operating System.\n\n619\n00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,840\nThen you got the Web Server,\nthat's kind of sort of integrated but\n\n620\n00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,430\nkind of its own thing on top.\n\n621\n00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,560\nAnd then you have the web application\nthat resides on top of that.\n\n622\n00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,640\nSo understanding the Web Server is gonna\nbe a vital part of this investigative\n\n623\n00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,550\nprocess, because some of the evidence\nthat you need is gonna be there.\n\n624\n00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:45,700\nSo you're gonna have logs that\nare specific to the Web Server.\n\n625\n00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,620\nAnd what version of OS you have\nunderneath that's also gonna determine\n\n626\n00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,250\nwhat could possibly be there.\n\n627\n00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,500\nSo that's why we want to\nhave an understanding of it.\n\n628\n00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,290\nOf what the Web Server is and\nkind of just how it's put together.\n\n629\n00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,010\nAnd we're not gonna go into,\njust to kind of make it clear, here.\n\n630\n00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,981\nWe're not going to go into some really\nin-depth dissection in taking a part of\n\n631\n00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:09,219\na Web Server, that's for something else.\n\n632\n00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:13,312\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you don't have that,\n\n633\n00:33:13,312 --> 00:33:18,040\nthe knowledge already, there's other\nthings that ITPro has for that.\n\n634\n00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,208\nI couldn't tell you specific courses but I\nknow they are spread around even the CEH.\n\n635\n00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:25,738\nAnd other areas are spread\nall over the place.\n\n636\n00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:29,960\nSo, if you don't have that, then yes, you\ndo want to start acquiring some of that\n\n637\n00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,520\nknowledge because it's gonna be vital\nto your forensic investigation.\n\n638\n00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,443\n>> So\ntake a look at the Web Servers out there.\n\n639\n00:33:37,443 --> 00:33:42,777\nThere's several, three big ones that I\ncan think of, off the top of my head,\n\n640\n00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:47,146\nIIS, which is a Microsoft product,\nApache, and then Nginx.\n\n641\n00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:51,674\n>> Yeah, you get kind of those\ntend to be the big three.\n\n642\n00:33:51,674 --> 00:33:53,702\nWell aware there's other ones out there,\nbut\n\n643\n00:33:53,702 --> 00:33:56,490\nthese are the ones that\nyou're most likely gonna see.\n\n644\n00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:01,899\nYou know, IIS of course, has a long\ntrack record, long sordid history.\n\n645\n00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:03,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I guess you could put it that way.\n\n646\n00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,568\nIt's had its own issues and it's.\n\n647\n00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:07,553\n>> Yes it has.\n\n648\n00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:13,260\n>> Yeah, so it's something that is\nstill very popular inside a business.\n\n649\n00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,630\nAnd it's popular outside\nof businesses too.\n\n650\n00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,030\nISPs use it.\n\n651\n00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:23,440\nAnd so, it's Windows based,\nit's been around for awhile.\n\n652\n00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,370\nIt has changed over the years.\n\n653\n00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,450\nQuite a bit actually if you look at it.\n\n654\n00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:31,220\nThere was a point a few years ago\n\n655\n00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,360\nwhere it went from being kind\nof this monolithic design.\n\n656\n00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,390\nTo all of a sudden they split it apart and\nthey had a core module.\n\n657\n00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,270\nAnd there were other modules\nyou could load on top\n\n658\n00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,750\nof it that carried out\nindividual functions.\n\n659\n00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,890\nAnd so, knowing for\n\n660\n00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:49,193\nexample that something would be very\nhelpful during the forensic process.\n\n661\n00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:54,930\nBecause investigating something,\nfor example IIS-5 and then IIS-7.\n\n662\n00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:58,910\nThose shared the name,\nand that's about it.\n\n663\n00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,552\nThere are some similarities, but for\nthe most part, they are different servers.\n\n664\n00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,120\nYes, they're both Web Servers but\nthey behave differently.\n\n665\n00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,350\nSo knowing that, is gonna help you\ndo your investigation a lot quicker,\n\n666\n00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,930\na lot more efficiently.\n\n667\n00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,131\n>> So, I might not be an expert in IIS or\nNginx but\n\n668\n00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:18,520\nI've got to understand\nthe way they function.\n\n669\n00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,920\nThe way they work.\n\n670\n00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,340\nThe way they host those applications, so\nI can make a good, thorough investigation.\n\n671\n00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,380\n>> Yeah, if your web application is\nusing one of these things as a platform,\n\n672\n00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,890\nthere's a tight integration there.\n\n673\n00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:37,320\nHow tight depends on whatever\nsituation you walk into.\n\n674\n00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,650\nOn the Microsoft side, a lot of those\nintegrations are incredibly tight.\n\n675\n00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,210\nYou can think of stuff like SharePoint.\n\n676\n00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:47,840\nSharePoint is very, very tightly\nintegrated with that Web Server.\n\n677\n00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,880\nAnd they're almost to get to a point\nwhere they're almost indistinguishable or\n\n678\n00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,590\nblurred between them.\n\n679\n00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,350\nYeah, you can't extract it and people try.\n\n680\n00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,170\nYou get people that are good on the web\nserver side, and they figure, okay,\n\n681\n00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,900\nwell I can't understand SharePoint.\n\n682\n00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,440\nSo, they'll go into IIS and\nstart monkeying with stuff in there.\n\n683\n00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,120\nAnd it can have a dramatic impact.\n\n684\n00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,520\nI've taught some class on SharePoint,\nsee it happen, how come it's not working?\n\n685\n00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,063\nIt's like okay, what'd you do?\n\n686\n00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:17,665\nIt's like, no, what did you really do?\n\n687\n00:36:17,665 --> 00:36:20,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's my interrogator hat coming out.\n\n688\n00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,260\nI know you're lying,\njust tell me the truth.\n\n689\n00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,402\nSo, that's an important thing to know,\nit could be tightly integrated with it.\n\n690\n00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:29,832\nAnd Microsoft side of things,\nit's very commonly,\n\n691\n00:36:29,832 --> 00:36:31,890\nespecially the stuff that Microsoft ships.\n\n692\n00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,430\nThird party stuff,\n\n693\n00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:38,760\nthose are gonna vary depending on\nwhat particular situation you're in.\n\n694\n00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,130\nBut Microsoft stuff, yeah, if you're\ninvestigating something like Exchange.\n\n695\n00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,192\nIf you look at Exchange and\n\n696\n00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:47,470\nsomething we're gonna be talking\nabout in another episode.\n\n697\n00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:51,190\nEmail investigations and\ntracking emails, and\n\n698\n00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,090\nwe have information leakage and\nhacks and dumps.\n\n699\n00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,260\nAnd all that coming out of email.\n\n700\n00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,020\nIf Outlook Web Access is there,\nIIS pops right back into the picture.\n\n701\n00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,440\n>> All right, so we've got different\nWeb Servers that we've got to be familiar\n\n702\n00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,970\nwith so\nwe can do a good thorough investigation.\n\n703\n00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,660\nWe understand how that\napplication is being hosted.\n\n704\n00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,970\nWe also have to understand that there's\na certain process we go through\n\n705\n00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,250\nwith our web attack investigation, right.\n\n706\n00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:24,160\n>> Yes, there is a specific process and\nyou can actually break what the process\n\n707\n00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,909\nI'm talking about here into more steps\nif you really, really wanna do that.\n\n708\n00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,076\nIt's your call.\n\n709\n00:37:31,076 --> 00:37:35,450\nI kind of tried to make this so it fits\nthe broadest range of investigations as\n\n710\n00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,610\nwell as if you're to\nbring that back in again.\n\n711\n00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,464\nIf you're gonna be taking one of\nthe certifications that we talked about,\n\n712\n00:37:42,464 --> 00:37:45,540\nthen they both kind of have\ntheir own way of approaching it.\n\n713\n00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,762\nSo this is one of the things that you are\ngonna want to investigate a little closer\n\n714\n00:37:49,762 --> 00:37:51,854\ndepending on which credential you go.\n\n715\n00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:55,093\nYou have the CHFI, the CSFP, or the CCFP.\n\n716\n00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:58,460\nOr I don't even care what they call it,\nwhatever.\n\n717\n00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,520\nThere's this and then there's that.\n\n718\n00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,270\nIf you want the proper pronunciation,\ngo back to the first episode.\n\n719\n00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,820\nSo, but\nyou have those two directions going there.\n\n720\n00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,362\nSo, again which one\nyou're going to go for.\n\n721\n00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:17,870\nYou're gonna have to look, to see\nwhat their process it breaks down to.\n\n722\n00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:22,600\nBut the steps I have here, you fit both at\na higher level and it's good enough for\n\n723\n00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,120\nwhat we're doing here.\n\n724\n00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,470\n>> So what are those three steps then?\n\n725\n00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,310\n>> Well, the three steps.\n\n726\n00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,780\nThe first one is gonna be detection.\n\n727\n00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,220\nYou have to detect the attack and\nwhat the nature of it is.\n\n728\n00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,690\nAnd that's so you can do a proper\nassessment of what's actually occurring.\n\n729\n00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:42,160\nSo you're trying to get\nthat initial assessment.\n\n730\n00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,280\nIt might expand later on, but you're\ntrying to see what that scene looks like\n\n731\n00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,320\nand it can be quite substantial,\ndepending on the situation.\n\n732\n00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,450\nIt might be one individual server or\n\n733\n00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,880\nit could be spread across\nto multiple servers.\n\n734\n00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,435\nI mean,\nthere's that tiered architecture again.\n\n735\n00:39:00,435 --> 00:39:02,630\nOnce it spreads across multiple systems,\n\n736\n00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,350\nthat's gotten more\ncomplicated to investigate.\n\n737\n00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,920\nAnd it's gonna require\nanother level of knowledge.\n\n738\n00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,870\nAnd different types of information\ngathering that fit that situation.\n\n739\n00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:19,790\nAnd that by the way, the tools\nthat we're gonna be showing here,\n\n740\n00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,740\nthat's what a lot of them are geared\ntowards, is that you can target a server.\n\n741\n00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,731\nBut then once you know it's other ones,\n\n742\n00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:29,612\nyou can just sweep bunches of servers at\nonce to see what's going on with them.\n\n743\n00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:34,527\nAnd how they're exchanging data to get\na better idea of what the attack may\n\n744\n00:39:34,527 --> 00:39:35,800\nhave looked like.\n\n745\n00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,470\nSo that's important, but you have to\nbe able to detect the attack first.\n\n746\n00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,710\nHow you detect it, things like a firewall.\n\n747\n00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,890\nThings like your logging, your IDSs.\n\n748\n00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:50,000\nAll those things are gonna\ncome into play here.\n\n749\n00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,846\nPlus other stuff.\n\n750\n00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:54,943\nIt may just be, incidentally enough,\nthere's been enough attacks especially in\n\n751\n00:39:54,943 --> 00:39:58,054\nthe web server case,\nwhere people have just stumbled on them.\n\n752\n00:39:58,054 --> 00:40:02,710\nThey've done a normal audit as\npart of the process and go, oh.\n\n753\n00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,833\nAnd they find, and all of a sudden\nthey find out that there's what?\n\n754\n00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:08,269\nThat there's a few records here and\na few records here and\n\n755\n00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:09,600\na whole bunch of records here.\n\n756\n00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,970\nIt just keeps widening and widening.\n\n757\n00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:12,720\nIt happens.\n\n758\n00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,210\nYou may literally be, if you're someone\nthat's all ready got that pen tester\n\n759\n00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,350\nknowledge, you may be someone that\ngoes into a situation like this,\n\n760\n00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:27,500\ndoesn't audit, and you have to sit down\nand say, I got some bad news for you,\n\n761\n00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,590\nI suspect that this is happening,\nand we're going to have to\n\n762\n00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:35,040\nbring someone in to do the investigation,\nor maybe it's gonna be you.\n\n763\n00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,060\nSo, don't be surprised.\n\n764\n00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,740\n>> So, we get this, we detect it.\n\n765\n00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,110\nWe realize that there's been some kind\nof breach against our web application,\n\n766\n00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,200\nthen where do we move from there?\n\n767\n00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,070\n>> You want to define the scope.\n\n768\n00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,810\nSo, once you know what the problem is,\n\n769\n00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:54,230\ntry get a handle on just how\nfar this attack is spreading.\n\n770\n00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:58,240\nIs it just restricted to that one server.\n\n771\n00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,080\nWere there are multiple systems involved.\n\n772\n00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,780\nYou know, as you're travelling\nacross multiple sites,\n\n773\n00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,570\nand what infrastructures\nyou're travelling across.\n\n774\n00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,970\nYou know,\nwhat clients you might be affecting.\n\n775\n00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,550\nWe haven't really said\nanything about that yet, but\n\n776\n00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,910\nif there's clients affected,\nthey are part of the problem.\n\n777\n00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,280\nAnd who knows?\nMaybe it was one of those\n\n778\n00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,970\nclients that initially\nstarted the problem.\n\n779\n00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:23,800\nMaybe someone had a system that they took\nhome and they let the kids play with it.\n\n780\n00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,710\nAnd the kids were browsing around.\n\n781\n00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,830\nWeren't thinking about it,\ngot some malware on it.\n\n782\n00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,880\nAnd then got plugged\ninto your system again.\n\n783\n00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,740\nAnd all of a sudden boom.\n\n784\n00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,960\nYou wouldnt be the first\nbusiness that that happened to.\n\n785\n00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,670\nSo that would be the thing.\n\n786\n00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:41,320\nIs defining the scope as\ngood as you possibly can.\n\n787\n00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,270\nSo youŕe gonna have to be thorough\nwhen you do your detection and\n\n788\n00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,150\ndo your assessment.\n\n789\n00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,800\nAnd to figure out just how wide the scope\nis, and you might actually change\n\n790\n00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,660\nthe scope when you get down the road it's,\nthat's happened before too.\n\n791\n00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,000\nBecause you might see that,\noh yeah there's another tentacle you know,\n\n792\n00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,590\nout here that we kind of have to go\nthrough and be aware of and so yeah.\n\n793\n00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:05,340\n>> When we talk about project management,\nwe always talk about scope\n\n794\n00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,200\ncreep where I want to keep the scope\nof that project limited and focused so\n\n795\n00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,480\nthat it doesn't end up taking more time or\ncosting more money.\n\n796\n00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,340\nIn this case though, scope [INAUDIBLE]\nmight be, not necessarily a good thing,\n\n797\n00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,720\nbut part of the process.\n\n798\n00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,500\nWe might find that the attack does reach\nout a little further than we thought.\n\n799\n00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,440\nWhen we were looking at an attack\non that web application,\n\n800\n00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,880\nwe found out that they actually\nmade it to that back end, so\n\n801\n00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,810\nnow I've gotta investigate\nthat back end's server.\n\n802\n00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:34,640\nOr they've gone from that application\nthey've used that web app to get access to\n\n803\n00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,980\nthe server but then from there, mapped\nout my network and now their attacking\n\n804\n00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,600\na firewall somewhere else or a email\nserver something like that so you've got\n\n805\n00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,590\nto watch the scope of your investigation\nthere and it might change on you.\n\n806\n00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,960\n>> Yeah expect it to.\n\n807\n00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,830\nWith the complexity that we were talking\nabout in the first segment here, yeah.\n\n808\n00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:59,910\nExpect it to find these little things\nthat might be hidden here and there that,\n\n809\n00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,110\nyou know, you have to do a really,\nreally careful investigation to find it.\n\n810\n00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:07,880\nThat's why, you know, if you go back\nto one of the previous episodes,\n\n811\n00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,750\nwe were talking about log files and\ncorrelation.\n\n812\n00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,490\nThat's where this is starting\nto come back in the picture too,\n\n813\n00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,870\nbecause you will have\nto look at log files to\n\n814\n00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:19,970\nget a determination of\nwhat's actually happening.\n\n815\n00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:25,950\nThat may be your picture of the situation,\nof the scene of the incident.\n\n816\n00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:29,280\nSo, keep that in mind\nwhen you're doing this,\n\n817\n00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,300\nalso why you gotta keep\nthem synchronized too.\n\n818\n00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,210\nIf they're not all in one station.\n\n819\n00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,700\nAnd if they're all pieces\naren't all in one station,\n\n820\n00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,250\nthe correlating those logs\nplays an even bigger role now.\n\n821\n00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:42,520\n>> All right, so we got our detection and\n\n822\n00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,720\nour scope definition and\nthe last phase would be.\n\n823\n00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,400\n>> Containment.\n\n824\n00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,110\n>> Containment.\n\n825\n00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:49,570\nTrying to limit where it gets to.\n\n826\n00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:55,130\n>> Yeah, and this is something with web\napplication kind of flies in the face with\n\n827\n00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,750\nwhat we talked about before cuz if you\nremember when we were talking about\n\n828\n00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,650\nlive systems, one of the things we\nsaid was don't ever, don't touch it.\n\n829\n00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,360\nDon't unplug it.\n\n830\n00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,049\nJust leave it.\n\n831\n00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:10,230\nUntil the forensics people come in and\ndecide what they want to do, and\n\n832\n00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,300\nthen they have all the stuff they want to\ngather before they'll shut it down, well,\n\n833\n00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,310\nhere we're saying that in\nthe containment phase,\n\n834\n00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:21,790\nmore often than not they might decide,\nonce they've determined what the scope is,\n\n835\n00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:27,070\nto start unplugging those systems\nfrom the rest of the network,\n\n836\n00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:30,910\nto keep it from spreading because we're\ntalking about a situation especially if\n\n837\n00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,890\nyou have multiple systems,\nwhere it's already spread.\n\n838\n00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,420\nIt's already gotten out to other systems,\nso\n\n839\n00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:40,910\nwe're trying to contain that as best\nas possible to keep it limited.\n\n840\n00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,310\nAnd then once you have that contained,\n\n841\n00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:46,290\nthen you can start\ndissecting what's going on.\n\n842\n00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,600\nAnd it could even be at that point\nonce you have it contained you look at\n\n843\n00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,240\nthe firewall and\nsee what's going to the outside world.\n\n844\n00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,000\nYou might find out that\na specific IP address was the one\n\n845\n00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,410\nregistering these attacks or a range of IP\naddresses were registering that attack,\n\n846\n00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,320\nyou know, originators of that attack.\n\n847\n00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,980\nSo you look at that.\n\n848\n00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,850\nHeck, it might even be your IPS or\nIDS that picked that up and\n\n849\n00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,430\ntold you where that was.\n\n850\n00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:14,270\nNow you can start focusing\nin your investigation\n\n851\n00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:18,410\non those IP addresses to see\nare they still launching strikes.\n\n852\n00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,290\nWhere those things come from.\n\n853\n00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,080\nThat would be,\n\n854\n00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,300\nnow that once you start getting to the IP\naddress after you've done containment.\n\n855\n00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,800\nYou start investigating where\nthose strikes were launched from,\n\n856\n00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,540\nthat would be where we'd use like\nthose tools we had in the CEH show.\n\n857\n00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,420\nVisual traceroute, if you wanna use that,\nor just regular traceroute.\n\n858\n00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:44,980\nPing, all those things that we typically\nuse to investigate those type of things.\n\n859\n00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,180\nWe would use them here.\n\n860\n00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,820\nWe would use the exact same things\nhere to see what's going on.\n\n861\n00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,240\nWho knows, maybe you find out\nwhere that IP address is and\n\n862\n00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,960\nyou call up that ISP and now start talking\nabout what was going on, what's happening.\n\n863\n00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,970\nAnd maybe they can shut off\nstuff from their side too.\n\n864\n00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,820\n>> All right.\nSo, our process then is gonna involve\n\n865\n00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:08,060\ndetecting that attack, defining the scope\nof that attack and then trying to\n\n866\n00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:12,730\ncontain that attack to prevent the damage\nfrom going out further as we investigate.\n\n867\n00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,798\nOne of the first places we go\nthen once we've got our attack\n\n868\n00:46:18,798 --> 00:46:22,870\ncontained, log files, probably.\n\n869\n00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:25,050\n>> Yeah, we've got to actually\ntalk about two things here.\n\n870\n00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,630\nWe've talked about log files and\n\n871\n00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:29,410\ndoing traffic because you're\nboth gonna come into play.\n\n872\n00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:34,930\nIt could be a compare and contrast Log\nfiles, you know, we know what they are.\n\n873\n00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:39,960\nIt's just keeping track of\nevents that happen on a system.\n\n874\n00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,930\nAnd it sounds like,\nhey that's a great piece of evidence.\n\n875\n00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:48,330\nYou know, we could pretty much look\nat that and determine what happened.\n\n876\n00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,590\nAs long as we're doing it with all\nthe guidelines we've specified.\n\n877\n00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:55,590\nYou know paranormal business practices and\njust something that we do and\n\n878\n00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,645\nit's reliable, consistent..\n\n879\n00:46:57,645 --> 00:47:00,065\nAll things were in good shape.\n\n880\n00:47:00,065 --> 00:47:05,985\nBut you do have to remember there\nare some disadvantages with log files.\n\n881\n00:47:05,985 --> 00:47:10,295\nThe biggest one we could think of\nnow is if you have a log file.\n\n882\n00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:13,315\nA lot file is not real time.\n\n883\n00:47:13,315 --> 00:47:17,235\nA log file is set up\nto log certain things.\n\n884\n00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:21,340\nSo when a service is putting\na line in a file some place\n\n885\n00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:25,820\nIt's only under specific circumstances\nthat something will pop in there.\n\n886\n00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:30,240\nSo if what I'm doing, or\nthe attacker's doing doesn't fit with that\n\n887\n00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,840\nlog file is looking for, or\nsupposed to be logging an event on.\n\n888\n00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,190\nIt's gotta move on down the line.\n\n889\n00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,700\nSo that would be a problem.\n\n890\n00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,350\nSo if you look at some of these log\nstores, we were talking yesterday about.\n\n891\n00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:46,187\nThe 500 series, and the security logs, in\nEvent Viewer, and we look at those things,\n\n892\n00:47:46,187 --> 00:47:49,579\nand we say, okay,\nthese things are security related events.\n\n893\n00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:52,519\nWell, if you look at\nthe 500 series in there,\n\n894\n00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:55,533\nthere's a number of things\nthat we've done, and\n\n895\n00:47:55,533 --> 00:48:00,412\ncan be done outside of this that may not\nclearly fit into one of those categories,\n\n896\n00:48:00,412 --> 00:48:04,336\nin which case that log may not pick it up,\nit may not do anything.\n\n897\n00:48:04,336 --> 00:48:08,199\nMight show up someplace else as\nsomething entirely different or\n\n898\n00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:11,570\nit may not show up at all, so\nthat could be a big problem.\n\n899\n00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:15,770\nIt's not real time and\nit's not getting everything.\n\n900\n00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,070\n>> Versus doing a full traffic capture.\n\n901\n00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:18,700\n>> There you go.\n\n902\n00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,220\n>> Where we're getting everything.\n\n903\n00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,080\n>> Yeah that's exactly it,\n\n904\n00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,760\nis that full traffic you are getting\neverything, so that's a great thing.\n\n905\n00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,710\nYou can put any one of a number of\nsniffers that we've covered during this,\n\n906\n00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:38,450\nthe CEH and other courses too\nthat can pick-up traffic..\n\n907\n00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:39,380\nYou know that's great.\n\n908\n00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,220\nYou can use any of those\nto pick that stuff up.\n\n909\n00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,800\nYes you do have to interpret,\na little bit more than you do log files.\n\n910\n00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,860\nWell depending on the sniffer I guess,\nwould be a better way to put it but\n\n911\n00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,590\nthen you also have the situation.\n\n912\n00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:54,770\nThe disadvantage is there could be\na lot of information that you've kind\n\n913\n00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:59,410\nof got a way through to find that\none thing that you're looking for.\n\n914\n00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,380\nSo it's easy to get overwhelmed there but\n\n915\n00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,680\nwe've also learned that there's tools\nto help us out with that, too..\n\n916\n00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,030\nSo it's not exactly something where\nsomeone's just puking up raw data and\n\n917\n00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:11,920\nall of a sudden you've got to sort through\nit to figure out where the good stuff is.\n\n918\n00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,080\nNo, you have tools that will help\nyou get through some of it but\n\n919\n00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,790\nyou still have to do\nsome pattern recognition.\n\n920\n00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,860\nAnd things like that to really,\nkind of, pick stuff up.\n\n921\n00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,880\nAnd who knows, maybe you've run into\nsomething new Don't be surprised if you\n\n922\n00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,350\nrun into a new attack and\nthose systems that generate reports.\n\n923\n00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:33,200\nAnd stuff like that aren't\nreally going to help you.\n\n924\n00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,650\nThey're going to be,\nthat's traffic, that's it.\n\n925\n00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,148\nThat's all it cares about.\n\n926\n00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:43,320\nNow it comes to you to dissect it and\nsay okay, I see what's happening here.\n\n927\n00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,170\nAnd you got to reason it out,\nwhat someone might be after.\n\n928\n00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:49,330\n>> Yeah and that actually goes back to\na question that I think Mikayla had\n\n929\n00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:50,190\nposted in there.\n\n930\n00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:54,070\nIs there something I can do to get\nbetter at reading some of these packet\n\n931\n00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,000\ncaptures and these log files.\n\n932\n00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,650\nAnd a lot of it comes down to experience,\nI think more than anything,\n\n933\n00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,830\nseeing it once or twice.\n\n934\n00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:04,060\nAnd I know, I think Guido threw\nout a link for us to go to\n\n935\n00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,490\nthe packetlife.net captures, they've\ngot a bunch of sample captures there.\n\n936\n00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:13,130\nBut really it comes down to looking at\nthings like that or generating your own.\n\n937\n00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:17,130\nDo it in your sandbox, trying to simulate\nan attack or something like that.\n\n938\n00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:20,470\nCapture the traffic that's\nbeing generated and look at it.\n\n939\n00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:24,460\nAnd start to recognize those because\nreally nothing is gonna replace\n\n940\n00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,140\nexperience or seeing it.\n\n941\n00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,480\nNot that you have to have a live attack\ngoing on or be a part of an actual attack.\n\n942\n00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,080\nBut we can do a lot of it in simulation,\nsee it, then we'll\n\n943\n00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,600\nrecognize it when we go out in the real\nworld and we're doing our investigation.\n\n944\n00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,580\n>> Well,\nremember when we talked about the CEH,\n\n945\n00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,530\nI don't know if you remember the link?\n\n946\n00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:42,660\nI can't remember, off the top of my head,\n\n947\n00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:46,210\nthere was a link that had sample\npacket capture for Wireshark.\n\n948\n00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,700\nThat's where I got the Slammer and\n\n949\n00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,130\na few other ones I still had\non my system from last time.\n\n950\n00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,660\nBut there is a site with\nsample capture files that\n\n951\n00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:01,650\nwere generated by Wireshark that you\ncan start training your eye for.\n\n952\n00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:05,040\nAnd that's absolutely\nwhat it comes down to.\n\n953\n00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,950\nYou're saying experience?\n\n954\n00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:10,520\nYeah, training your eye to\nsee these things and so\n\n955\n00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,580\nyou could start seeing the patterns.\n\n956\n00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:17,210\nAnd once you get good enough\nwith some of these log files.\n\n957\n00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:21,990\nAnd these packet captures,\nthey just kind of, they can scroll by.\n\n958\n00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:26,680\nAnd you can almost pick-up like a packet\ncapture, if it's just scrolling by.\n\n959\n00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,235\nSome people can pick that up in real time\nwhich is kind of scary, I've seen it.\n\n960\n00:51:30,235 --> 00:51:31,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like the matrix,\n\n961\n00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,550\nyou got those green\nletters floating down and\n\n962\n00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,895\nall of a sudden you start\nseeing the picture right.\n\n963\n00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:37,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's exactly what I thought\n\n964\n00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,530\nwhen I saw someone do it, I'm like,\nI saw this person in the matrix.\n\n965\n00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,550\nSome people are that good enough to do it.\n\n966\n00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,580\nIt's just at the right speed and\nthey've got enough training.\n\n967\n00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,490\nThey can just go pop,\npop, pop, pop, like that.\n\n968\n00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:55,260\nNo one expects you to be like that but\nthey do expect you to be able to.\n\n969\n00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,410\nOkay good,\nyou've got the sample captures up there.\n\n970\n00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:02,980\nAll of you should be looking at a link\nlike that for something like Wireshark.\n\n971\n00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:07,200\nAnd grabbing those to see what\nthe different attacks look like.\n\n972\n00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,110\nYes, those have been sanitized\nto a certain degree.\n\n973\n00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,370\nBut they're good enough for you to see\n\n974\n00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:18,785\nwhat should be present in a packet\ncapture, representing one of those.\n\n975\n00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:24,370\nI can't say that enough and then the event\nviewer stuff that we have in Windows.\n\n976\n00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,790\nYeah.\nJust get used to getting look at it.\n\n977\n00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:29,900\nYou should already be anyway\nif you're in the IT field.\n\n978\n00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:35,030\nI hope you are used to them but get used\nto seeing what's in those things, so\n\n979\n00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,700\nyou know what to expect and\nwhat's out of the ordinary.\n\n980\n00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,050\n>> And play with your filters, most\nlogging systems have really good filtering\n\n981\n00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:46,030\ncapabilities so I can learn what\nI want to narrow it down to.\n\n982\n00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:49,700\nTake a look at some of those tools we\ntalked about, like Log Parser Lizard,\n\n983\n00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,050\nI think was one.\n\n984\n00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,260\n>> That would be a tremendous one.\n\n985\n00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,250\n>> A lot of tools that would\nhelp me crunch those, but\n\n986\n00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,100\nagain, it really comes down\nto knowing what to look for.\n\n987\n00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,580\nWhat do I filter by?\n\n988\n00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,760\nAnd that just comes with\na little bit of practice and\n\n989\n00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,730\nlooking at some different\ntypes of attacks.\n\n990\n00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:09,130\n>> And do remember also, to kind of\nfit it in with this whole discussion.\n\n991\n00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:13,000\nThere are some vulnerability\nscanners that are outside or\n\n992\n00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,440\njust you know, we couldn't get\nthem to demo in this environment.\n\n993\n00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,670\nYou know, I've got some vulnerability\nscanners that I'm going to show you today\n\n994\n00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,035\nbut there are some vulnerability\nscanners that are outside.\n\n995\n00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:27,310\nWhat we can demo here that are designed\nfor application developers and people\n\n996\n00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,850\nthat are monitoring web applications\nthat can go across multiple systems.\n\n997\n00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:32,480\nAnd correlate all those logs.\n\n998\n00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,360\nAnd everything for you, the idea of being\nthat application developer can get that\n\n999\n00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,470\ngood view of everything that's going on.\n\n1000\n00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:44,200\nThat's another utility that you could get\n\n1001\n00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,320\nnot to mention Microsoft ones\nlike Operations Manager.\n\n1002\n00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,820\nOperations Manager does that sort of thing\ntoo, it's not geared specifically for\n\n1003\n00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,640\nthat but it can be configured to do that.\n\n1004\n00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,120\n>> All right.\nWell looking at the clock,\n\n1005\n00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,220\nit's about time for\nus to take another one of those breaks.\n\n1006\n00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,190\nWe're gonna step away.\n\n1007\n00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:04,320\nWhen we come back, we're gonna continue\non talking about our Web Applications.\n\n1008\n00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,730\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1009\n00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:12,441\nWe'll be right back.\n[MUSIC]\n\n1010\n00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:13,011\n>> All right.\n\n1011\n00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:14,950\nWelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1012\n00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:19,320\nSo continuing on our discussion on\nour analyzing Web Applications.\n\n1013\n00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,360\nNext on our list, Sean,\nwe want to talk about event viewer.\n\n1014\n00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,910\nAnd we've talked about log files.\n\n1015\n00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:29,280\nAnd event viewer in a Windows System as\nwhat we can use to view those log files.\n\n1016\n00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,470\nAnd in particular, some of the things we\nmight be looking for in these log files.\n\n1017\n00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:38,460\n>> Yes, that's the thing is that when you\ngo through event viewer, you are really,\n\n1018\n00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:43,050\nwhatever your event viewing\nsoftware of choice happens to be.\n\n1019\n00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:47,690\nYou really kind of want to take a careful\neye towards when you start going through\n\n1020\n00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:54,810\nit like on my system here,\nI have Event Viewer up on here.\n\n1021\n00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:59,020\nAnd this is my security log,\nyou want to kind of pay special attention,\n\n1022\n00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:02,710\ndo I see anything that looks out of\nthe ordinary for that time period.\n\n1023\n00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:06,740\nYou know and it can be,\nthis can be kind of a tricky thing even\n\n1024\n00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,150\nthough this isn't a very\ncomplex thing to look at.\n\n1025\n00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:15,240\nGo through and filter these events, see\nif anything, you know, maybe stands out.\n\n1026\n00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,460\nStuff I'm looking for,\n\n1027\n00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,710\nstuff that might be in the 500\nseries like we were talking about.\n\n1028\n00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:25,935\nBut also look at security, then also\nlook at your application stuff as well,\n\n1029\n00:55:25,935 --> 00:55:28,755\nsee if anything here\nkind of catches your eye.\n\n1030\n00:55:28,755 --> 00:55:33,365\nAnd the thing that you have when you look\nat something like this, don't look for\n\n1031\n00:55:33,365 --> 00:55:36,425\nstuff that just the red or yellow.\n\n1032\n00:55:36,425 --> 00:55:40,345\nThat can be a big downfall.\n\n1033\n00:55:40,345 --> 00:55:41,535\nYour eyes are drawn right to it.\n\n1034\n00:55:41,535 --> 00:55:42,905\nThat's what their there for.\n\n1035\n00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:48,520\nSo an IT person is doing just that\nlevel would eyes are drawn right to it.\n\n1036\n00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,190\nThey're like, oh,\nI've got a problem here and\n\n1037\n00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:55,290\nI need to investigate that\nbefore it becomes catastrophic.\n\n1038\n00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:56,856\nYou know, you don't get to be so lucky.\n\n1039\n00:55:56,856 --> 00:56:02,800\nYou're going to look at things to see\nwhat was occurring at a certain time.\n\n1040\n00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,950\nAnd date, and here this is also where\nyou look at to see if anything in that\n\n1041\n00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:11,030\n500 series pops up, and\nsays boom, something happened.\n\n1042\n00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,580\nThis is just my desktop system,\nmy laptop system,\n\n1043\n00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:19,230\nso I don't expect to have any of those\ntype of things in here since I'm not\n\n1044\n00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:22,460\nrunning a web server, and\nI have a lot of stuff shut down.\n\n1045\n00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,990\nBut, you would be looking through\nthis to see if anything pops out,\n\n1046\n00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,390\ncatches your attention.\n\n1047\n00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:30,070\nThis would also be a good time\nto kind of go through and\n\n1048\n00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:33,120\nlearn some of these things\non the right-hand side here.\n\n1049\n00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,150\nActions, learn how to filter\nspecific event IDs, and\n\n1050\n00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:41,610\nif you're looking for specific things,\nget rid of anything else you don't need.\n\n1051\n00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,340\nTo see if you see those remember,\nif you do a filter or\n\n1052\n00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,990\neven the subscriptions that\nyou were talking about Mike.\n\n1053\n00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,160\nAnd any of those types of things,\n\n1054\n00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,320\nthat doesn't get rid of\nthe stuff in the log file.\n\n1055\n00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,320\nYou're not purging a log file.\n\n1056\n00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,310\nYou're just formatting\na little differently, so\n\n1057\n00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,918\nyou can view it to see just what you want.\n\n1058\n00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:59,820\nIf you wanna go back and\nview it another way, you can go back and\n\n1059\n00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,760\nview it another way.\n\n1060\n00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,340\nTotally acceptable to do that.\n\n1061\n00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,490\nSo don't be afraid to use these.\n\n1062\n00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,050\nAnd you can also do so remotely, too.\n\n1063\n00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:12,000\nThese tools are all available for\nyou to use remotely.\n\n1064\n00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,560\n>> Yeah, as an IT person, we are,\n\n1065\n00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,990\nas you say, I've got custom views\nthat I've created that do just that.\n\n1066\n00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:20,570\nFilter out and look for\na it was warning of these criticals and\n\n1067\n00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,670\nerrors across several different servers.\n\n1068\n00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:26,100\nBecause, I got to come in in the morning\nand check and make sure my servers and\n\n1069\n00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,380\nmake sure they're doing their thing.\n\n1070\n00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,550\nBut as forensic investigators, we are\ninvestigating something that has occurred\n\n1071\n00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,030\nand most likely it was successful,\nor we wouldn't have been called in.\n\n1072\n00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,420\nSo, we not only have to look for\nthose errors and things, but\n\n1073\n00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,390\nit might just be an informational.\n\n1074\n00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:42,820\nSo access this database or\naccess this file.\n\n1075\n00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,170\nOr so and so successfully made changes.\n\n1076\n00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:49,130\nThose are gonna be, success events\ndepending on what we're auditing.\n\n1077\n00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:54,284\nSo, it's not just as easy as you said\nfiltering it out just for the errors.\n\n1078\n00:57:54,284 --> 00:57:55,050\n>> Yeah.\n\n1079\n00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:57,640\nYou don't get to just do that anymore.\n\n1080\n00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,340\nYou don't just say well,\nI see a failure for a specific service.\n\n1081\n00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:05,260\nYeah, you do get to look at that cuz\nthat may be a part of the incident.\n\n1082\n00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,270\nBut there's other stuff,\n\n1083\n00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:11,130\nother things that are part of that puzzle,\nthat you also have to pick up.\n\n1084\n00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:15,620\nSo, you really kind of\ngot to have that eye,\n\n1085\n00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,730\nthose eyes trained to see these things.\n\n1086\n00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:20,810\nBut, also be aware of the different\nevents that could occur.\n\n1087\n00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,330\nYou'd be aware of these filtering, I mean,\n\n1088\n00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,690\nwhat you're talking about\ncomes across multiple servers.\n\n1089\n00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:29,740\nYeah, you're not gonna,\nespecially at a forensics situation.\n\n1090\n00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,410\nI mean,\nI don't know how many servers you manage,\n\n1091\n00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,590\nbut let's say you got a dozen of them.\n\n1092\n00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:39,562\nImagine trying to find that\none needle in a haystack.\n\n1093\n00:58:39,562 --> 00:58:42,391\nFinding a needle in a haystack\nwould be on one system.\n\n1094\n00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:44,670\nIf you had a dozen systems or\na couple dozen systems,\n\n1095\n00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:49,310\nit's finding a needle in a stack of\nneedles in a stack of haystacks.\n\n1096\n00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:53,450\nSo, you've really gotta use something\nto make your life easier, or\n\n1097\n00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,380\nyou're gonna have a lot of problems.\n\n1098\n00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:59,490\n>> And we've got to think about our\nwarrants, and our scope as well, right?\n\n1099\n00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:03,340\nWe might have permissions to\nlook at this one server, but\n\n1100\n00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,540\nnot the entire, all the servers on\ntheir network, things like that.\n\n1101\n00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:10,230\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\nanother really good point.\n\n1102\n00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:15,530\nAnd then just also to point out something\nhere on my system, we've got the Windows\n\n1103\n00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:20,560\nlogs, which is the ones we're all know and\nlove, I guess.\n\n1104\n00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:24,060\nBut we also have other ones.\n\n1105\n00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:28,940\nOn my system here,\nI opened up the Microsoft log files,\n\n1106\n00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,460\nthese are the ones that you were\nalso talking about yesterday.\n\n1107\n00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,800\nThese are ones that are specific\nto certain services and\n\n1108\n00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,820\nitems on the system, so\nyou can dig through these and\n\n1109\n00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:46,420\nfind things that specifically single\nout a service for you to investigate.\n\n1110\n00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:50,580\nI mean you can get it other ways, but\nthis is a really really nice way.\n\n1111\n00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,940\nThis is like you were bringing up.\n\n1112\n00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,530\nMicrosoft was like no,\nwe're not giving anymore log files.\n\n1113\n00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:56,950\nAll of the sudden they're like yeah,\nhere you want it?\n\n1114\n00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:58,800\nFine, take it, that's what they did.\n\n1115\n00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,560\n>> [LAUGH] Here they all are, go ahead and\nfind what you're looking for.\n\n1116\n01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,830\n>> Yeah, go ahead.\n\n1117\n01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:04,500\nThey're all there.\n\n1118\n01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,570\nYou can see, I've already clicked\nthrough this a number of times.\n\n1119\n01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,240\nIt's still going.\n\n1120\n01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:13,485\nI always find it interesting that\nWordPad's got an event log entry.\n\n1121\n01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,730\n>> [LAUGH] I'm surprised\nit's even still there.\n\n1122\n01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:21,400\nI guess we still need a free rich\ntext editor or something like that.\n\n1123\n01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,270\n>> Yeah, okay.\n\n1124\n01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:24,870\nThere's been something\nthere that I've seen.\n\n1125\n01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:27,709\nI just kind of scratch my head, okay?\n\n1126\n01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:29,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I guess they were like,\n\n1127\n01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:32,160\nwe're logging everything,\nand you'll like it.\n\n1128\n01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,210\nYeah, so then you can see down here I have\na little baby version SQL server on here,\n\n1129\n01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,610\nthe express version.\n\n1130\n01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,070\nIt's got it's own logs\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n1131\n01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:45,900\nAnd then there's PowerShell,\nbut there's a lot of stuff,\n\n1132\n01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,950\nis what we're getting down to.\n\n1133\n01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:50,250\nAnd all those can be pulled through\nthose subscriptions, and the filters,\n\n1134\n01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,050\nand all that.\n\n1135\n01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:54,820\n>> To distill it down to just the stuff\nthat's gonna be useful to you.\n\n1136\n01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:55,860\n>> It's a funny term.\n\n1137\n01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,945\nI haven't heard that before, but Guido in\nour chat room used the term Windows smog.\n\n1138\n01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:02,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can definitely see\n\n1139\n01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,950\nthat that's pretty appropriate for\nsome of this.\n\n1140\n01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:07,090\nI heard of smog applied\nto other stuff before.\n\n1141\n01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:10,060\nNever Windows, but I've heard it\napplied to like, information smog and\n\n1142\n01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:12,750\nstuff like that and then LA.\n\n1143\n01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,170\nOkay, I come from Southern California.\n\n1144\n01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,980\nSmog is another thing for us.\n\n1145\n01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,980\nWe like to cut and eat our air that way.\n\n1146\n01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,690\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's a little thick out there.\n\n1147\n01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:24,480\nSo, we've got the event viewer.\n\n1148\n01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,310\nOur log system's event viewer in Windows,\nbut\n\n1149\n01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:30,620\nwe have other event viewer systems\nin our other platforms as well.\n\n1150\n01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:34,760\nWe just have to know to go and look there,\nbe able to dig through the wealth of\n\n1151\n01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,730\ninformation you're gonna find in those log\nfiles, try to pick out whats important.\n\n1152\n01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,660\nOther things we can look at,\nnet connections,\n\n1153\n01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,000\nwhat is this device connected to.\n\n1154\n01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,500\n>> Yes, that's another very important one.\n\n1155\n01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:52,687\nAnd this takes the form of some of\nthe stuff that we've seen before,\n\n1156\n01:01:52,687 --> 01:01:54,890\nplus some new stuff.\n\n1157\n01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:59,790\nWhat I want to kind of point out here,\n\n1158\n01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:05,250\nis that we have the typical, well I'll\nswitch to it over here on my screen.\n\n1159\n01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:07,780\nI've got a couple of things\nthat are of interest.\n\n1160\n01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:11,040\nI've got NetStat down here.\n\n1161\n01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,360\nI took a snapshot of it.\n\n1162\n01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,880\nWe've seen that a few times in here.\n\n1163\n01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,570\nI know there's probably nothing really\nexciting about it at this point.\n\n1164\n01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,300\nBut just play along.\n\n1165\n01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,000\nYou can see that.\n\n1166\n01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,200\nWe've also talked about.\n\n1167\n01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,400\nYeah, see there you go.\n\n1168\n01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,730\nI need enthusiasm here people.\n\n1169\n01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:30,160\nSo, what you see in here\nis you see just a snapshot.\n\n1170\n01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,750\nWe've been the road with TCP view,\n\n1171\n01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:35,990\nbut this would also be something\nwhere Wireshark would be handy.\n\n1172\n01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:38,320\nIf you start seeing that there's\nactivity on certain ports,\n\n1173\n01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,220\nwell then maybe it's time to plug\nin Wireshark and look for that.\n\n1174\n01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:47,630\nAnd look for things over port 80 and 443,\nor maybe you're using 8080 or whatever.\n\n1175\n01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,580\nOr if you see something\ncompletely out of the ordinary,\n\n1176\n01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:55,830\nremember someone could've uploaded stuff\nto the server in the form of malware.\n\n1177\n01:02:55,830 --> 01:03:00,110\nThey could have done something\nlike a SQL injection to open up\n\n1178\n01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:04,270\nthat backdoor on the system, and start\nthrowing RAT proxies stuff like that on.\n\n1179\n01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:09,470\nYou could potentially\nopen up different ports.\n\n1180\n01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:12,350\nThose would be something that if\nyou look through this list, and\n\n1181\n01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:16,530\nsaw something that was not there or\nshouldn't be there,\n\n1182\n01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:21,550\nthen maybe you should do a closer\ninvestigation or inspection on it.\n\n1183\n01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,540\nThat's why I said that's\nwhere wire shark comes in or\n\n1184\n01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:27,370\nsome of the other sniffers come in\nthat's where Nmap can help you too.\n\n1185\n01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:33,800\nNmap, if you're in a position where\nyou scan a system with Nmap, what\n\n1186\n01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:38,700\nyou can do is you scan it and just do a\nquick look at to see what ports are open.\n\n1187\n01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,780\nRemember Nmap will tell you by default.\n\n1188\n01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:45,090\nSeveral scans which ports are open,\nit won't tell you about the other ones, so\n\n1189\n01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:47,210\nyou'll just get a short list or\nshould get a short list.\n\n1190\n01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:48,630\nIf you get one that's this long,\n\n1191\n01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:51,890\ndoesn't mean necessarily mean\nanything bad is going on.\n\n1192\n01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:55,075\nBut, that's time to start asking\nsome questions and saying,\n\n1193\n01:03:55,075 --> 01:03:57,971\ndid you turn all these on,\ncan you account for all these.\n\n1194\n01:03:57,971 --> 01:03:59,664\nDo I need to do banner grabs, or\n\n1195\n01:03:59,664 --> 01:04:03,521\nadditional things to investigate\nwhat traffic is flowing over here?\n\n1196\n01:04:03,521 --> 01:04:05,576\nJust to be on the safe side.\n\n1197\n01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:09,400\nSo there's other tools, but Netstat's one.\n\n1198\n01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:14,880\nWe have Netstat, we have Nmap,\n\n1199\n01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:22,030\nwe have TCPView, we have CurrPorts,\nwhich is also, and the system center.\n\n1200\n01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:23,750\nSo you've got all those.\n\n1201\n01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:28,390\nAnd then the other one, it may be of\nlimited value for Net Connections,\n\n1202\n01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:29,970\nis also another old one.\n\n1203\n01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:32,510\nNBT stat for NetBIOS.\n\n1204\n01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:38,350\nThis is sometimes recommended to do,\nNetBIOS has limited range.\n\n1205\n01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:43,110\nYou're not going to be doing that\nover the Internet or something.\n\n1206\n01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:44,010\nIt just aint gonna happen.\n\n1207\n01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:48,673\nBut if you're behind the firewall, and\nyou're investigating the local systems,\n\n1208\n01:04:48,673 --> 01:04:51,510\nand just happen to be on the same network.\n\n1209\n01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:55,840\nThen you might consider doing something\nlike this to see if someone has\n\n1210\n01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,380\nperhaps punched into that system and\nopened up connections to other ones.\n\n1211\n01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:04,550\nNetBIOS is a very,\nvery commonly exploited service.\n\n1212\n01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:07,580\nIt's got more holes than\nSwiss cheese in some cases.\n\n1213\n01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:11,520\n>> Most admins have forgot about it,\nor intentionally forgot about it.\n\n1214\n01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,710\nJust try to it push off to the side.\n\n1215\n01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:14,680\nIt's probably not monitored as closely.\n\n1216\n01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,042\nSo it would make a great avenue of attack\nbecause I know that it's still enabled on\n\n1217\n01:05:18,042 --> 01:05:19,234\nmost of my Windows systems.\n\n1218\n01:05:19,234 --> 01:05:21,397\nUnless it's specifically turned off and\n\n1219\n01:05:21,397 --> 01:05:24,660\nit's not something that's\nmonitored closely.\n\n1220\n01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:28,401\nSo, it is a great place for the bad guy,\nso it's gotta be some place that we look.\n\n1221\n01:05:28,401 --> 01:05:30,003\n>> Yeah, don't forget it.\n\n1222\n01:05:30,003 --> 01:05:33,904\nYou just hit the nail on the head\nthere with it was, it's still enabled.\n\n1223\n01:05:33,904 --> 01:05:36,146\nYou don't think about it, or\n\n1224\n01:05:36,146 --> 01:05:41,250\nthere's a good amount of people\nthat don't think about that.\n\n1225\n01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:45,336\nThey either never had to use NetBIOS cuz\nthey're still, there's people coming into\n\n1226\n01:05:45,336 --> 01:05:48,925\nthe IT field now, that have never had\nto use NetBIOS or deal with that mess.\n\n1227\n01:05:48,925 --> 01:05:52,820\nSo those have been around\na little bit longer.\n\n1228\n01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,530\nWe're probably a little\nmore conscious of NetBIOS.\n\n1229\n01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:59,480\nWe know we've been through all the horrors\nand everything on messing with it.\n\n1230\n01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,510\nAnd we may also be aware that\nit is enabled by default, so\n\n1231\n01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:07,470\nwe wanna shut that off if there's\nreally no reason to use it.\n\n1232\n01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:10,109\nAnd you've got to make that\ndetermination for yourself.\n\n1233\n01:06:10,109 --> 01:06:13,550\nIf it's something that's\nneed on your network.\n\n1234\n01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:19,330\nBut I would as an investigator,\nmake it a habit to just run this to see\n\n1235\n01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:23,610\nif anything, perhaps, has any connections\nor anything going back and forth.\n\n1236\n01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:26,670\nBecause yes,\nthey will target that service.\n\n1237\n01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:29,014\nIt's just a fact of the matter,\nthey'll target it.\n\n1238\n01:06:29,014 --> 01:06:33,717\nIf they can, if an attacker can open\nup a null session, over NetBIOS,\n\n1239\n01:06:33,717 --> 01:06:35,620\nthey can do a lot with that.\n\n1240\n01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:38,770\nSo they have scanners\nspecifically designed for that.\n\n1241\n01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:41,830\nNot to mention you can use Net Use and\nstuff like that.\n\n1242\n01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:45,180\nTo go ahead and\ntry to open up an old session and\n\n1243\n01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,940\nif you can do that you\ncan start running and\n\n1244\n01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:52,070\npushing files over there, running stuff\nremotely and dumping policy information.\n\n1245\n01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:53,945\nWe saw a lot of that the CEH, so\n\n1246\n01:06:53,945 --> 01:06:57,770\nif you run this NBT stat look to\nsee first of all is it running,\n\n1247\n01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:02,423\nand second of all do we have any active\nconnections open to anything else.\n\n1248\n01:07:02,423 --> 01:07:05,554\n>> All right, so we got that and\nwe got local user accounts,\n\n1249\n01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:09,640\nanother thing I've gotta deal\nwith in our investigation.\n\n1250\n01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:14,890\n>> Yeah, don't forget that when you\ntalk about a lot of web applications or\n\n1251\n01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:18,170\nweb servers for that matter that\nwould fit in this category.\n\n1252\n01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:22,630\nThat those are frequently stand alone\nsystems that those aren't domain\n\n1253\n01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:26,910\nintegrated, and again we're talking\nthe Windows world, but they're not domain\n\n1254\n01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:31,870\nintegrated so that means that\nthey have a local user database.\n\n1255\n01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:35,282\nSo one of the things that you're gonna\nwanna get used to is going through your\n\n1256\n01:07:35,282 --> 01:07:36,254\nlocal user manager.\n\n1257\n01:07:36,254 --> 01:07:41,380\nNow here's the thing, I can look at\nthe one I have here on my screen.\n\n1258\n01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:46,250\nThis is a standard Windows User Manager,\nprobably no big surprise to anybody,\n\n1259\n01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,025\nbut you look at this and\nI see three accounts.\n\n1260\n01:07:49,025 --> 01:07:51,973\nOkay, that's what I fully\nexpect to see here.\n\n1261\n01:07:51,973 --> 01:07:54,320\nThis is kind of where I want to warn you.\n\n1262\n01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:59,540\nNow I won't reboot the system and take you\nthrough all the nonsense of doing this,\n\n1263\n01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:04,490\nbut if you recall when we did\nthe ethical hacking class.\n\n1264\n01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:07,380\nOne of the things that\nI discussed in here,\n\n1265\n01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:12,180\nwas that you could actually create a user\naccount and then go in the registry and\n\n1266\n01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:16,480\nput an entry in there and\nhide it from the local user manager.\n\n1267\n01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:20,640\nSo, what will happen is that when that's\nput in there ,there could be an account\n\n1268\n01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,600\nsitting out here and you'll never\nsee it through local user manager.\n\n1269\n01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,160\nThat's where you as a forensic\ntech knowing that now,\n\n1270\n01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,020\nhaving hopefully been\nthrough CEH training.\n\n1271\n01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:38,030\nOr something equivalent to it\nthat does that, teaches that,\n\n1272\n01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,080\nyou'll know hey,\nmaybe I should do a registry dump.\n\n1273\n01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,980\nMaybe I should get reg view out or reg\nedit and dump it and search through it to\n\n1274\n01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:50,380\nsee if these keys exist and\nare hiding in a count,\n\n1275\n01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:55,450\ncuz once I know that trick,\nI may very well try it.\n\n1276\n01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:57,990\nOnce I get local access to that system.\n\n1277\n01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:01,220\nI may very well create a user account,\nhide it, and keep it off your radar.\n\n1278\n01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:05,990\nSo if you follow this guidance, and this\nguidance to open up a local user manager\n\n1279\n01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:11,310\nis very common, especially on Windows,\nis to open up this user manager and\n\n1280\n01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:14,370\nsee very quickly and\neasily what users are there.\n\n1281\n01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:17,760\nWell, knowing that that's gonna be\na part of the investigative process,\n\n1282\n01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,700\nI'm just gonna hide it and\nkeep it out of your sight.\n\n1283\n01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,430\nOut of sight, out of mind,\nas the saying goes.\n\n1284\n01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:23,930\nSo you gotta be smarter in that.\n\n1285\n01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:27,410\nYou have to say, okay, it's not here,\nbut let me double check.\n\n1286\n01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:31,450\nMaybe you're being paranoid, but\nit doesn't hurt at this point.\n\n1287\n01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:32,940\nIt's a quick check.\n\n1288\n01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:35,420\n>> I'm not paranoid if there\nreally are hidden user accounts.\n\n1289\n01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,918\n>> Exactly. Yeah, exactly. >> [LAUGH]\nYou might be looking at log files and\n\n1290\n01:09:38,918 --> 01:09:43,160\nsee some entries for this user\n>> Hey, I don't have a user on my system,\n\n1291\n01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,370\nI got this entry that says\nthis user account access this.\n\n1292\n01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,950\nWhat user is that?\n\n1293\n01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:51,080\nWe'd better go look at the registry and\nsee what's going on.\n\n1294\n01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,290\nSo we got local user\naccounts we gotta deal with.\n\n1295\n01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:56,640\nOther thing we gotta deal with is all\nthose services running on our systems.\n\n1296\n01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,280\n>> Yes that's another\none that can get really,\n\n1297\n01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:06,540\nreally troublesome on any\nsystem is because Windows,\n\n1298\n01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:11,600\nMicrosoft decide to load all these\nservices on a system by default.\n\n1299\n01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,340\nAnd then you start getting\nstuff from specific vendors and\n\n1300\n01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:19,020\nspecific applications and they start\nshoving their own stuff in there.\n\n1301\n01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:23,750\nAnd all of a sudden you have a bunch\nof services on your system that\n\n1302\n01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:28,280\nare either unusual or\nyou just plain don't recognize.\n\n1303\n01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,660\nAnd so now you have to start\ndoing an investigation.\n\n1304\n01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,990\nThe first thing to do\nin something like that,\n\n1305\n01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:37,800\nis seeing what services you have running.\n\n1306\n01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,390\nYou can do it through the services\nmanager, administrative tools.\n\n1307\n01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:44,540\n>> Or you can do like I've\ndone here on my screen.\n\n1308\n01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:50,120\nI've just opened up a command prompt and\ndid it for us ahead of time.\n\n1309\n01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:50,740\nI just went ahead and\n\n1310\n01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:54,700\nran a NET start command and\ndumped the list of processes on a system.\n\n1311\n01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:59,310\nAnd you can actually see very quickly on\nmine if you start going down that list,\n\n1312\n01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:03,880\nand you know, we can zoom that up for you\na bit, if you look at that system you can\n\n1313\n01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:10,210\nsee that there is stuff by Lenovo,\nMetasploit is in there.\n\n1314\n01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:14,960\nThose obviously are not\nstandard Windows services so\n\n1315\n01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,270\nthose are things that came\nas part of the Lenovo stuff.\n\n1316\n01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,330\nI got a Lenovo computer here.\n\n1317\n01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:24,072\nAnd then the Metasploit stuff, well,\nI got Metasploit installed here, so\n\n1318\n01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:25,955\nthat's why that stuff is showing up.\n\n1319\n01:11:25,955 --> 01:11:28,704\nSo I can recognize it pretty\neasily by seeing that but\n\n1320\n01:11:28,704 --> 01:11:32,142\nthere's gonna be ones in there,\neverybody's encountered it,\n\n1321\n01:11:32,142 --> 01:11:35,468\nthere's gonna be ones that you're\njust what the heck is that.\n\n1322\n01:11:35,468 --> 01:11:38,766\nI don't know what that is and\nshould I shut it off?\n\n1323\n01:11:38,766 --> 01:11:42,929\nDon't shut it off or do anything\nuntil you've done your research and\n\n1324\n01:11:42,929 --> 01:11:44,525\nfigured out what that is.\n\n1325\n01:11:44,525 --> 01:11:46,900\nThere's really no excuse for that.\n\n1326\n01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:51,844\nWe talked about that site last time,\nthe CEH course, the blackviper.com site.\n\n1327\n01:11:51,844 --> 01:11:55,950\nAnd that site's got them for\nall the current version of Windows,\n\n1328\n01:11:55,950 --> 01:12:00,064\nall the way back to,\nI think Windows 2000 he's still got up.\n\n1329\n01:12:00,064 --> 01:12:04,069\nSo You can see what\nMicrosoft puts in there.\n\n1330\n01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:09,650\nBut as you saw, there's stuff that's not\nMicrosoft that will not be on those lists.\n\n1331\n01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:14,872\nAnd so you have to go into Google or\nwhatever else to find it.\n\n1332\n01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:16,054\n>> Yeah.\n\n1333\n01:12:16,054 --> 01:12:17,880\nAnd if we're talking\nabout our web servers.\n\n1334\n01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:22,400\nWe should be as a part of the IT staff\nshould harden your web servers, right?\n\n1335\n01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,630\nRemove any unnecessary\nservices that we're not using.\n\n1336\n01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:28,130\nMaking sure that they're turned off.\n\n1337\n01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:32,420\nBut part of our investigation is gonna\nbe look at those services and see.\n\n1338\n01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,680\nWhat's running as you said.\n\n1339\n01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,740\nIt could be part of an attack.\n\n1340\n01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:37,670\nSomebody could have turned on a service\nthat should have been turned off.\n\n1341\n01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:41,920\nMaybe they launched up, somehow they\ngot FTP started on that web server and\n\n1342\n01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,380\nthey're using that to transfer\nfiles back and forth.\n\n1343\n01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:47,970\nSo by getting in there, digging into this\nsystem as part of the investigation,\n\n1344\n01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:50,970\nknowing what services\nshould be running and\n\n1345\n01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:55,330\nthen finding the ones that we didn't\nknow about or shouldn't be running.\n\n1346\n01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:57,150\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n1347\n01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:01,280\nYou gotta know your stuff, you gotta\ncheck to see what should be there and\n\n1348\n01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,740\nwhat shouldn't be there, and get on it.\n\n1349\n01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:09,305\nI like something for,\nI like using the tool like\n\n1350\n01:13:09,305 --> 01:13:13,220\nNetStart, instead of\nthe administrative tools one.\n\n1351\n01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:18,080\nCuz the administrative tools one, I'm not\nsaying it's bad, or there's any problems\n\n1352\n01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:24,110\nwith it, its a very good utility\nto get in and configure services.\n\n1353\n01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:28,740\nBut, for what we're doing here,\nI want to see what services are running.\n\n1354\n01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,900\nI like the fact that NetStart,\nI run it, dump into a file,\n\n1355\n01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:34,930\nit immediately tells me what is running.\n\n1356\n01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:36,810\nIf it's not running,\nit's not on that list.\n\n1357\n01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,430\nSo, I don't have to go through and\ndo all of that sorting and\n\n1358\n01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:44,920\neverything I do in service manager I know,\nit's not that big of a deal.\n\n1359\n01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:51,950\nBut, then again, this, I could do a quick\ndate capture and then dump this to a file.\n\n1360\n01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:53,970\nNow I've got forensic evidence.\n\n1361\n01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,301\nSo, I'd rather do it in one shot.\n\n1362\n01:13:56,301 --> 01:13:57,195\nSo, your call.\n\n1363\n01:13:57,195 --> 01:13:59,515\n>> Yeah, and for those of you that\nhave done our server training,\n\n1364\n01:13:59,515 --> 01:14:02,035\nyou know power shell,\nget dash services, right?.\n\n1365\n01:14:02,035 --> 01:14:03,055\nOr get dash service, sorry.\n\n1366\n01:14:03,055 --> 01:14:06,195\nAnd I can do a ware filter and\nstatus equals running.\n\n1367\n01:14:06,195 --> 01:14:07,485\nAnd I can produce that list,\n\n1368\n01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:10,145\nso lots of different ways we\ncan go about getting that.\n\n1369\n01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,685\nAnother thing that we might not\nthink about right away, but\n\n1370\n01:14:12,685 --> 01:14:17,280\nthat we really should include in part of\nour investigation is disk utilization.\n\n1371\n01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:22,050\n>> Yes, that is one that's gonna\nvery telling in a number of cases.\n\n1372\n01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:26,090\nEspecially if you've\nbeen keeping track of, or\n\n1373\n01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:29,350\nat least know roughly what your\ndisk space usage should be.\n\n1374\n01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:33,410\nYou can see that,\nwell heck, it's increased,\n\n1375\n01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:35,460\nso somebody's put something up here.\n\n1376\n01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:40,830\nSomething's happening that's generating or\ntaking up a lot of disk space,\n\n1377\n01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:45,715\nso I need to figure out what's doing that.\n\n1378\n01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:47,575\nSo keeping track of disk space usage,\n\n1379\n01:14:47,575 --> 01:14:51,915\nthat can be just as simple as\ndoing a DRI command if you want.\n\n1380\n01:14:51,915 --> 01:14:55,555\nYou know, or there's utilities that\nwill give you the nice pie chart\n\n1381\n01:14:55,555 --> 01:14:57,955\non disk space usage if you want.\n\n1382\n01:14:57,955 --> 01:15:02,525\nSo you can get fancy with it\nif that's what you desire.\n\n1383\n01:15:02,525 --> 01:15:05,970\nYou just have to make sure it's\nsomething that you can capture.\n\n1384\n01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:11,410\nIn such a way that it will be\nforensically sound, but aside from that,\n\n1385\n01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:17,290\ndisc space usually see how it varies over\ntime, or over a short period of time,\n\n1386\n01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:20,340\ncan go a long way toward telling\nyou someone's invaded that system.\n\n1387\n01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:24,560\nRemember, someone could have also pushed\nsomething like a rootkit onto your system,\n\n1388\n01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,881\nand that could be a problem there too.\n\n1389\n01:15:26,881 --> 01:15:29,051\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because that can cause all sorts of\n\n1390\n01:15:29,051 --> 01:15:31,201\nstuff to go screwy with your disc space,\nor\n\n1391\n01:15:31,201 --> 01:15:33,970\nmake your disc space not\neven look like it's changed.\n\n1392\n01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:37,560\nIt can also be telling if this\nspace hasn't changed at all.\n\n1393\n01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,150\nNo matter what you do.\n\n1394\n01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:41,430\nSo there's some little tricks like that.\n\n1395\n01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:44,860\nBut you're looking to see what's changed.\n\n1396\n01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,530\nThis could be something that's changed.\n\n1397\n01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:48,690\nYou mentioned FTP, which is great.\n\n1398\n01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:53,000\nFTP is definitely part of the web\napplication portion of this.\n\n1399\n01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,560\nSomeone could have very easily put if\nyou had ftp open or if they installed it\n\n1400\n01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:02,600\nthrough other means or we had things\nlike in the CH course like tiny FTP.\n\n1401\n01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,640\nYou upload that, open an FTP server, and\n\n1402\n01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,800\nall of a sudden they're uploading stuff in\nthere and they're sucking up disk space.\n\n1403\n01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,060\n>> Oh, yeah?\n>> And it's happened where people\n\n1404\n01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,540\nhave put pirated content and stuff like\nthat on other people's web servers.\n\n1405\n01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:16,040\nAnd just pointed people to there and\nsaid here you go.\n\n1406\n01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,040\n>> Had a case here recently, or\nnot recently, in Gainesville.\n\n1407\n01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:23,580\nIt was an organization here that had\njust got a new server in, and they were\n\n1408\n01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,880\njust excited to get it in the rack and\nget it put up, it's a Friday afternoon.\n\n1409\n01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,090\nSo they threw it in there,\nthey booted it up,\n\n1410\n01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:34,580\nthey got it sort of set up but they didn't\ngo through their normal herding process.\n\n1411\n01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:35,860\nAnd they leave for the weekend.\n\n1412\n01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:38,320\nThey come back Monday, and\nthey were out of disk space.\n\n1413\n01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,380\nSomebody turned it into a ware server,\nbecause they hadn't hardened it.\n\n1414\n01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:46,820\nSo part of the investigation was,\nlets see what happened,\n\n1415\n01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:48,640\nwhere did all this disk space go to.\n\n1416\n01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,620\nThey find all these hidden\nfiles that are being used.\n\n1417\n01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,250\nThat are being shared out.\n\n1418\n01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,440\nAnd the funny thing was,\n\n1419\n01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:59,060\nit was a law enforcement agency\nthat was sharing out movies.\n\n1420\n01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:04,100\nSo kind of a little twist or\na knife in the back there for that.\n\n1421\n01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:04,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n1422\n01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:06,000\n>> You know.\nThey had to figure out\n\n1423\n01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,910\nwhat happened to that server so\nthey had to investigate.\n\n1424\n01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:11,660\nAnd part of it was looking at that disk\nutilization because Windows wasn't\n\n1425\n01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:14,320\nreporting it, Windows says, hey,\nwe have plenty of disk space here.\n\n1426\n01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,590\nBut yet you try to do anything,\nout of disk space.\n\n1427\n01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:20,036\nAs it turns out there was a lot of hidden\nfiles on there that were being shared out.\n\n1428\n01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:22,335\nSo they found that out\nthrough their investigation.\n\n1429\n01:17:22,335 --> 01:17:25,090\n>> [LAUGH] Talk about embarrassing.\n\n1430\n01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:26,430\n>> A little bit embarrassing, right?\n\n1431\n01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:29,940\nSo disk space usage,\nanother thing we want to talk about.\n\n1432\n01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,500\nGod, we keep talking about these things.\n\n1433\n01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,950\nI know you get tired of them, but.\n\n1434\n01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:34,260\nWeb server logs.\n\n1435\n01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,520\n>> Yes.\nDon't forget those.\n\n1436\n01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,830\nThat's really all we need to\nsay at this point in there.\n\n1437\n01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:41,510\nI won't drag you through all that again.\n\n1438\n01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:42,420\nDon't forget that.\n\n1439\n01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:44,730\nYeah.\nWeb server's have there own logs and\n\n1440\n01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:48,280\nthey also follow their substandard\nformats that they follow.\n\n1441\n01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,980\nSo they can be somewhat easy to read.\n\n1442\n01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:52,250\nYou can get them in plain text.\n\n1443\n01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:56,600\nYou can get them in those W3C full format,\nCSVs.\n\n1444\n01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,260\nYou can even have if you want to get\nreally clever you can have them dump to\n\n1445\n01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:05,280\nSQL databases, so there's many ways you\ncan get that, but don't forget that\n\n1446\n01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,890\nthose things are out there and that's the\nweb server and the web application too.\n\n1447\n01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:13,550\nIn fact, the web application\nmay generate bunches of them,\n\n1448\n01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:16,590\ndepending on what portion of\nthe beast you're talking about.\n\n1449\n01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:18,290\n>> Right.\nAll right.\n\n1450\n01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:19,720\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\nit's about time for\n\n1451\n01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,060\nus to take another one of those breaks.\n\n1452\n01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,030\nSo we're gonna stop here.\n\n1453\n01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:25,659\nWhen we come back, we're gonna take a look\nat some of these tools we can use to\n\n1454\n01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:29,435\ndetect these web application attacks,\nso stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1455\n01:18:29,435 --> 01:18:35,739\n[MUSIC]\n\n1456\n01:18:35,739 --> 01:18:37,580\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n1457\n01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:41,950\nSo continuing on our episode with\nour analyzing our web applications,\n\n1458\n01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:45,810\nthe last thing we want to look at is\nsome of the tools we can use to detect.\n\n1459\n01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:48,361\nSome of these web app attacks, right Sean?\n\n1460\n01:18:48,361 --> 01:18:52,430\n>> Yes, and\nwe got plenty of good stuff here for you.\n\n1461\n01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:57,790\nSome of the stuff we'll just mention,\nother stuff I've got results already\n\n1462\n01:18:57,790 --> 01:19:02,580\nup here on my screen to show you, so\nyou'll see some cool stuff and hopefully\n\n1463\n01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:07,780\nit's stuff that you'll try it yourself\nthat will help you do investigation.\n\n1464\n01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:09,990\nSo we have some neat things.\n\n1465\n01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:13,810\nEach one of these things will\nmake your life a little easier.\n\n1466\n01:19:13,810 --> 01:19:18,200\nAnd we'll help you find either\nfind the problems before\n\n1467\n01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,560\nthey become a problem the defects.\n\n1468\n01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:25,250\nOr, find out that hey there's an issue\nhere that someone took advantage of cause\n\n1469\n01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:28,030\nI saw it on the other side and\nI could see where they got in here.\n\n1470\n01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:31,550\nSo, we're using some neat\nstuff to find that out.\n\n1471\n01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:33,340\n>> Alright.\nSo what's some of\n\n1472\n01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,060\nthe tools we could use then?\n\n1473\n01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:40,770\n>> One of the ones you could use is you\ncould always pull up something like Snort.\n\n1474\n01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:45,530\nSnort would be a tool that it's a network\nIDS you could pull up and tune it yourself\n\n1475\n01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:50,290\nafter you've found traffic that's\ninteresting to you, you could say, well,\n\n1476\n01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:55,050\nnow I want to see if there's any more and\nkind of focus in on that, and Snort's one\n\n1477\n01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:59,320\nof those things that you can literally\nprop up on a system on your own, and\n\n1478\n01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:04,151\nmaybe put that as A very specific thing to\npick up, a very specific set of traffic.\n\n1479\n01:20:04,151 --> 01:20:07,251\nInstead of worrying about all of\nthe overhead at the other one,\n\n1480\n01:20:07,251 --> 01:20:11,126\nthat may be on the other network, use this\none to zoom in on what you need to get.\n\n1481\n01:20:11,126 --> 01:20:12,655\n>> Yeah, very customizable,\n\n1482\n01:20:12,655 --> 01:20:17,111\nyou create these custom rules that decide\nto configure to pick up certain packets,\n\n1483\n01:20:17,111 --> 01:20:19,798\nas you can limit it just\nwhat it is you need to find.\n\n1484\n01:20:19,798 --> 01:20:23,478\n>> Yeah, you can fine tune it and\ntweak it however you need to.\n\n1485\n01:20:23,478 --> 01:20:25,963\nSo, that would be a good\none to get used to.\n\n1486\n01:20:25,963 --> 01:20:31,251\nAnd there's tons of documentation on that,\nwhich is the other cool\n\n1487\n01:20:31,251 --> 01:20:36,261\nthing is that the whole security\nindustry knows about that one,\n\n1488\n01:20:36,261 --> 01:20:41,084\nor they should because it's just so\npopular, and has been for\n\n1489\n01:20:41,084 --> 01:20:45,664\nyears, that everyone's got\na kind of an awareness of it.\n\n1490\n01:20:45,664 --> 01:20:47,874\nSo, you've got the documentation.\n\n1491\n01:20:47,874 --> 01:20:52,450\nYou can tune it for a specific attack, or\nif you see a specific pattern that's of\n\n1492\n01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:56,502\ninterest to you, and something like\nWireshark, use this to grab it.\n\n1493\n01:20:56,502 --> 01:20:59,439\nAnd see, okay, yes,\nI do see a pattern here.\n\n1494\n01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:03,421\nSnort's verifying that that\npattern does indeed exist.\n\n1495\n01:21:03,421 --> 01:21:05,000\nI'm not imagining it.\n\n1496\n01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,961\n>> Another one that pops in\nmind is good old Tripwire.\n\n1497\n01:21:07,961 --> 01:21:12,568\n>> Tripwire would be the other side\nof the house as far as IDSS go.\n\n1498\n01:21:12,568 --> 01:21:13,708\nWe have a network-based IDS.\n\n1499\n01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,308\nWe have a host-based IDS.\n\n1500\n01:21:15,308 --> 01:21:20,324\nAnd the host-based IDS in this case with\nTripwire is gonna pick up those changes.\n\n1501\n01:21:20,324 --> 01:21:24,652\nSo, if someone did happen to\nupload a rootkit, or a rat, or\n\n1502\n01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:30,293\nsomething like that, up to the server,\nthis is gonna presumably pick it up.\n\n1503\n01:21:30,293 --> 01:21:34,014\nIf they try to do any shenanigans hiding\nanything like that this should be\n\n1504\n01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:34,810\npicking it up.\n\n1505\n01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:39,449\nIt's not the only host-based IDS, just as\nSnort's not the only network-based IDS,\n\n1506\n01:21:39,449 --> 01:21:40,900\nbut you've got those two.\n\n1507\n01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:45,908\nKeep in mind,\nthe WSCC also has something that allows\n\n1508\n01:21:45,908 --> 01:21:50,710\nyou to hash files on the system and\ncheck key files.\n\n1509\n01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:53,634\nThe thing would be with the WSCC though,\n\n1510\n01:21:53,634 --> 01:21:58,547\nis that if you hash something after\nthe fact, it's of limited use.\n\n1511\n01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:02,976\nSo, unless, you think the person is going\nto come back, in which case you could lay\n\n1512\n01:22:02,976 --> 01:22:06,918\nit as a kind of something out there,\nkind of lay it as a quote unquote trap.\n\n1513\n01:22:06,918 --> 01:22:09,866\nYou can take a fingerprint of those files,\nand see if the fingerprint changes.\n\n1514\n01:22:09,866 --> 01:22:12,062\nAnd you know they've come\nback to do something.\n\n1515\n01:22:12,062 --> 01:22:18,863\nAnd remember, from the CEH side of things,\nthe CEH, we said, maintaining access.\n\n1516\n01:22:18,863 --> 01:22:24,615\nA lot of times a attacker will not only\npenetrate a system as a one-of deal,\n\n1517\n01:22:24,615 --> 01:22:28,083\nthey will leave a way for\nthem to get in again,\n\n1518\n01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:31,576\nlater on,\nif they need to do something else.\n\n1519\n01:22:31,576 --> 01:22:33,481\nSo, don't forget that.\n\n1520\n01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:37,883\nThis could be something that is a first\nstep towards doing something else, so\n\n1521\n01:22:37,883 --> 01:22:41,213\nmaybe it would be worth your\nwhile to hash files like that.\n\n1522\n01:22:41,213 --> 01:22:42,130\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1523\n01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:45,323\nAll right, and then we've mentioned\nvulnerability scanners a couple of times.\n\n1524\n01:22:45,323 --> 01:22:49,340\nWe talked about vulnerability scanners\nthat I can run against my operating\n\n1525\n01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:49,921\nsystems.\n\n1526\n01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:52,441\nThere are some that\nare specific to web servers.\n\n1527\n01:22:52,441 --> 01:22:54,044\n>> Yes.\n\n1528\n01:22:54,044 --> 01:22:57,108\nThere are some that are very,\nvery specific to web servers.\n\n1529\n01:22:57,108 --> 01:23:01,348\nThe ones we gave some lip\nservice to was Nessus,\n\n1530\n01:23:01,348 --> 01:23:04,747\nwhich always gets a lot of attention.\n\n1531\n01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:07,904\nAnd then we have Nexpose by Rapid7.\n\n1532\n01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:13,098\nSo, we've got those two, but\nwe also have other ones out there\n\n1533\n01:23:13,098 --> 01:23:19,958\nthat'll help us even more than our other\nguys would, and I'm not dissing Nessus or\n\n1534\n01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:24,774\nNexpose, they are very good and\nthey would help you here.\n\n1535\n01:23:24,774 --> 01:23:29,432\nThese ones just go a little bit further\nand give us more detailed information for\n\n1536\n01:23:29,432 --> 01:23:31,322\nthose specific environments.\n\n1537\n01:23:31,322 --> 01:23:33,761\nSo, that's a really cool thing.\n\n1538\n01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:37,066\nAnd I've got a couple here,\n\n1539\n01:23:37,066 --> 01:23:42,862\nI can actually show you\nthat do this sort of thing.\n\n1540\n01:23:42,862 --> 01:23:46,322\nI've got two I've all\nready run reports on.\n\n1541\n01:23:46,322 --> 01:23:50,164\nThis one you see on screen\nis one called Netsparker.\n\n1542\n01:23:50,164 --> 01:23:51,744\nThis is the community edition.\n\n1543\n01:23:51,744 --> 01:23:55,425\nYou can go ahead and grab this one for\n\n1544\n01:23:55,425 --> 01:23:59,731\nfree off their site and run scans with it.\n\n1545\n01:23:59,731 --> 01:24:04,725\nI've already done that for you,\nbecause I didn't wanna sit here,\n\n1546\n01:24:04,725 --> 01:24:08,330\nand have you just kind of go through and\nwatch it.\n\n1547\n01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:12,862\nWe could just sit here and talk about\nwhatever while it's going on, like oh,\n\n1548\n01:24:12,862 --> 01:24:14,758\nwe'll be back in 20 minutes.\n\n1549\n01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:16,638\nWhat I've done is I've run the scan.\n\n1550\n01:24:16,638 --> 01:24:21,213\nThis is a specific test\nsite that I can scan.\n\n1551\n01:24:21,213 --> 01:24:24,687\nI can scan against and check,\nand my two scanners by the way,\n\n1552\n01:24:24,687 --> 01:24:28,095\nI've run against the same site,\nso we can kinda compare and\n\n1553\n01:24:28,095 --> 01:24:30,776\ncontrast the results\nthat we get from the two.\n\n1554\n01:24:30,776 --> 01:24:35,860\nSo, I've run this one, you can see that\nit has a way of giving us the amount\n\n1555\n01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:40,616\nof connections we can set up with\nthe web server that will speed it up or\n\n1556\n01:24:40,616 --> 01:24:43,569\nslow it down depending\non which way you go.\n\n1557\n01:24:43,569 --> 01:24:45,671\nBe careful about opening\nup too many connections.\n\n1558\n01:24:45,671 --> 01:24:48,771\nIt is different here\nthan pen tester though.\n\n1559\n01:24:48,771 --> 01:24:52,307\nIf you use this as a pen tester, you gonna\nwant to be very careful with the number of\n\n1560\n01:24:52,307 --> 01:24:54,344\nconnections because that\nwill give you away.\n\n1561\n01:24:54,344 --> 01:24:59,172\nHere, on the forensics side, you want\nto be careful not to disturb anything.\n\n1562\n01:24:59,172 --> 01:25:02,551\nBut on the other hand, you're not\nconcerned with keeping a low profile.\n\n1563\n01:25:02,551 --> 01:25:03,910\nThey called you in,\nthey know you're there.\n\n1564\n01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:04,839\nSo,\n>> Right.\n\n1565\n01:25:04,839 --> 01:25:07,230\n>> I hope they know you're there and\nyou're not just doing this freelance.\n\n1566\n01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:14,278\nSo, but\nwe've got this thing we see in here.\n\n1567\n01:25:14,278 --> 01:25:16,694\nWe see critical, important,\nlow and informational.\n\n1568\n01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:21,050\nThat is one of the things I really love\nabout it because it really shows you nice,\n\n1569\n01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,754\nright there what's going on.\n\n1570\n01:25:22,754 --> 01:25:27,601\nThat's dynamically built, as the scan\ngoes, it will start color coding that and\n\n1571\n01:25:27,601 --> 01:25:29,088\nbreaking it out for you.\n\n1572\n01:25:29,088 --> 01:25:31,447\nYou didn't see that, obviously,\nbecause it already ran it.\n\n1573\n01:25:31,447 --> 01:25:33,626\nBut it will start counting them off.\n\n1574\n01:25:33,626 --> 01:25:36,944\nOkay, so see I have six critical,\nfive important, four low, and\n\n1575\n01:25:36,944 --> 01:25:38,201\ntwelve informational.\n\n1576\n01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:40,024\nAnd you can see how they're color coded.\n\n1577\n01:25:40,024 --> 01:25:43,379\nNow, you go down to the bottom, or\nyou can go to the left-hand side.\n\n1578\n01:25:43,379 --> 01:25:47,025\nIt has that site map up in\nthe upper left-hand side.\n\n1579\n01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:48,220\nYou know, over here.\n\n1580\n01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:52,864\nThis is just laying them out on different\npages and the way they're organized.\n\n1581\n01:25:52,864 --> 01:25:54,884\nYou can actually see code over there.\n\n1582\n01:25:54,884 --> 01:25:57,265\nYou can see some of\nthe code it's extracted.\n\n1583\n01:25:57,265 --> 01:26:04,881\nBut over here down at the bottom,\nyou can see it's got flagged in red.\n\n1584\n01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:07,212\nIt's got critical up top and it's saying,\n\n1585\n01:26:07,212 --> 01:26:09,546\nit's got the same color\ndown at the bottom.\n\n1586\n01:26:09,546 --> 01:26:11,719\nIt's saying Boolean base SQL injection.\n\n1587\n01:26:11,719 --> 01:26:16,011\nIf I open that up, what it's\ntelling me here is it's telling me,\n\n1588\n01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:21,022\nit found that this site is vulnerable\nto SQL injections, right off the bat.\n\n1589\n01:26:21,022 --> 01:26:24,047\nIt went ahead and scanned it and\nsaid I found it, and it's telling you,\n\n1590\n01:26:24,047 --> 01:26:25,567\nhere's the name of the parameter.\n\n1591\n01:26:25,567 --> 01:26:29,072\nHere's the down low on it.\n\n1592\n01:26:29,072 --> 01:26:30,930\nYou can go right through.\n\n1593\n01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:32,891\nIt tells you, this is what I found.\n\n1594\n01:26:32,891 --> 01:26:33,948\nThis is the nature of it.\n\n1595\n01:26:33,948 --> 01:26:37,043\nThis is what will happen\nif this is exploited, or\n\n1596\n01:26:37,043 --> 01:26:39,311\ncould happen if this is exploited.\n\n1597\n01:26:39,311 --> 01:26:41,448\nAnd you can see here,\nit says actions to take.\n\n1598\n01:26:41,448 --> 01:26:42,945\nThis thing is even telling you-\n>> Nice.\n\n1599\n01:26:42,945 --> 01:26:44,085\n>> What to do.\n\n1600\n01:26:44,085 --> 01:26:49,331\nAt least, at a basic level, telling you\nwhat to do to take care of this problem.\n\n1601\n01:26:49,331 --> 01:26:52,291\nSo, I like that even required skills.\n\n1602\n01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:55,372\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it's giving you kind of,\n\n1603\n01:26:55,372 --> 01:26:59,795\ngiving you some rough idea here, or a very\ngood idea in some cases, and even telling\n\n1604\n01:26:59,795 --> 01:27:04,241\nyou here's some external references you're\ngoing to go to for more information.\n\n1605\n01:27:04,241 --> 01:27:08,840\nSo, if you're that developer, you can\nuse this to go out there and dig deeper,\n\n1606\n01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,255\nwhich you know, we would hope you would.\n\n1607\n01:27:11,255 --> 01:27:13,828\nAnd then, we go down the list even more.\n\n1608\n01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:17,179\nYou can see here's cross-site\nscripting problems, and\n\n1609\n01:27:17,179 --> 01:27:21,773\nit's telling you hey, here's a page\nthat has a cross-site scripting issue.\n\n1610\n01:27:21,773 --> 01:27:26,122\nAnd same deal, it's telling you hey,\nhere's the problem.\n\n1611\n01:27:26,122 --> 01:27:30,581\nHere's what I found,\nall the DL remedies on.\n\n1612\n01:27:30,581 --> 01:27:34,357\nYou gotta kinda love that with\nthat level of detail there.\n\n1613\n01:27:34,357 --> 01:27:35,053\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1614\n01:27:35,053 --> 01:27:37,352\n>> That's saving me so much time.\n\n1615\n01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:42,332\nAnd when I go down a little bit further,\nPassword Transmitted over HTTP.\n\n1616\n01:27:42,332 --> 01:27:44,619\nIt's saying, you shouldn't be doing that.\n\n1617\n01:27:44,619 --> 01:27:46,953\nThat's credential information,\nit's telling you.\n\n1618\n01:27:46,953 --> 01:27:49,297\nI don't have to scroll down for that one.\n\n1619\n01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:50,841\nAnd then, we've got autocomplete.\n\n1620\n01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:55,821\nThe site has autocomplete enabled,\nso it will remember Who you are.\n\n1621\n01:27:55,821 --> 01:27:59,065\nYou type stuff in and\nit's going to go through and\n\n1622\n01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:01,760\ntell your browser to store that.\n\n1623\n01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,230\nThere we have another potential problem.\n\n1624\n01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:05,670\nIf your financial site or\n\n1625\n01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:08,920\na site that was trying to be more security\nconscious, you probably don't want that\n\n1626\n01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:12,260\nauto complete enabled until that\nbrowser stores those credentials.\n\n1627\n01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:15,820\nJust to be safe, make the person\ntype the whole thing in again so\n\n1628\n01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:17,980\nsomeone can't extract\nthose from the system.\n\n1629\n01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:21,800\nBecause it actually is pretty\neasy to factor from the system.\n\n1630\n01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:26,770\nThere's a multitude of ways,\nWSCC has at least three tools I know right\n\n1631\n01:28:26,770 --> 01:28:28,900\noff the top of my head that\ndo that sort of thing,\n\n1632\n01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:31,520\nthat will extract all the autocomplete\ninformation off your computer.\n\n1633\n01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,830\nAll you gotta do is run it, and it'll dump\nit out to a file, and you're ready to go.\n\n1634\n01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:39,320\nSo you can see where this is going.\n\n1635\n01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,280\nI don't know if I need to keep going\nthrough every one of them, and I won't.\n\n1636\n01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:46,550\nHere you can see the view what it\nlooks like on this page that has this\n\n1637\n01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:48,450\nproblem looks like in the browser.\n\n1638\n01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:51,560\nAnd I can even break down to this point,\n\n1639\n01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:55,490\nwhere it's viewing the headers and\nraw data that's going back and forth.\n\n1640\n01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:56,590\n>> Nice.\n>> This is stuff that\n\n1641\n01:28:56,590 --> 01:28:58,700\nBurp Suite would help you with.\n\n1642\n01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,820\nBurp Suite will view\nthe headers that go back and\n\n1643\n01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:04,550\nforth, but this one also\nincludes all the other stuff.\n\n1644\n01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:09,220\nBurp Suite has it's place,\nI'm not gonna make any bones about that.\n\n1645\n01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:12,380\nBurp Suite has a lot of\nstuff that this doesn't, so\n\n1646\n01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,142\nthat one shouldn't be out\nof your toolkit either.\n\n1647\n01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:18,137\n>> Right.\n>> But this one combines the vulnerability\n\n1648\n01:29:18,137 --> 01:29:21,760\nscanner and numerous other\nfunctions into one nice package.\n\n1649\n01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,820\nAnd it's a community edition, so\n\n1650\n01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:27,010\nit's got a lot of stuff that\nyou don't have to pay for.\n\n1651\n01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:30,530\nI mean, there's a pay version I\nbelieve that's got more stuff in it.\n\n1652\n01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:35,540\nBut this is already pretty\ngood right out of the gate.\n\n1653\n01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:39,030\n>> And as an investigator, we can use this\ninformation to try to figure out maybe\n\n1654\n01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:42,440\nhow they compromised that server,\nhow they actually made it in.\n\n1655\n01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:45,280\nGet that initial attack\nvector that they used.\n\n1656\n01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,420\n>> Yes.\nThat would be exactly right, and\n\n1657\n01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:50,760\nyou can even,\nthese tools will even generate reports.\n\n1658\n01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:54,080\nThis one has a whole report,\n\n1659\n01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:59,535\nfeature up here Appear that it will export\nit out to files, and what have you.\n\n1660\n01:29:59,535 --> 01:30:03,835\nAnd you can even compare different\nresults, so maybe you have it before you\n\n1661\n01:30:03,835 --> 01:30:09,515\nmade the changes and after, to see if you\nhad any major impact on what you did.\n\n1662\n01:30:09,515 --> 01:30:15,060\nSo, you kinda gotta love the way\nthey bundled this up for us.\n\n1663\n01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:19,970\nBut that's not the only vulnerability\nscanner, we also have this one over here,\n\n1664\n01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:21,040\nwhich is Acunetix.\n\n1665\n01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,150\nI scanned the same site.\n\n1666\n01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:28,190\nThis is Acunetix web\nvulnerability scanner.\n\n1667\n01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:30,970\nThey have a trail edition that works for\n14 days and\n\n1668\n01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:33,595\nthen they have the one that you\nhave to give your first born for.\n\n1669\n01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:38,157\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, you choose.\n\n1670\n01:30:38,157 --> 01:30:43,250\nSo, but this one,\nthis also kind of shows the value of\n\n1671\n01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:46,900\none of the things I was talking about with\nCEH, and I'll say again here, it's always\n\n1672\n01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:52,380\ngood to know more than one tool that\ndoes something so you can verify stuff.\n\n1673\n01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:55,270\nHere I'm seeing it's saying\nthere's SQL injections.\n\n1674\n01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:57,870\nThis one's saying that's\nnine SQL injections.\n\n1675\n01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:01,740\nI go over to Netsparker.\n\n1676\n01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:05,301\nThis one said, you know what,\nthat I had like five in there.\n\n1677\n01:31:05,301 --> 01:31:06,250\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1678\n01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:11,140\nWell there's, well it's got six here.\n\n1679\n01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:12,180\nThe other one's saying nine.\n\n1680\n01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:14,630\nSo we've something that we've missed.\n\n1681\n01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:18,190\nSo that would be of concern to me.\n\n1682\n01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:21,040\nWhen I see these type of things,\nbut, you go through and\n\n1683\n01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,210\nI'm looking at other stuff on this list.\n\n1684\n01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:26,805\nIt's identifying it, it's saying hey,\nit thinks this is a IAS4 Server.\n\n1685\n01:31:26,805 --> 01:31:31,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I sure as hope heck not, I really do.\n\n1686\n01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:33,755\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we can see other things in here.\n\n1687\n01:31:33,755 --> 01:31:37,845\nIt says that yeah, there's IS back there,\n\n1688\n01:31:37,845 --> 01:31:40,255\nthere's some other SQL\ninjections it's got.\n\n1689\n01:31:40,255 --> 01:31:44,325\nSo it's got the blind ones, and\nthe indefinite SQL injections.\n\n1690\n01:31:44,325 --> 01:31:46,645\nThat's broken down,\nyou may have some cross over there,\n\n1691\n01:31:46,645 --> 01:31:48,795\nit looks like there's\nsome cross over there.\n\n1692\n01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:51,755\nSo, you're seeing quite a bit.\n\n1693\n01:31:51,755 --> 01:31:57,060\nThen it has these additional tools over\non the left hand side that you can,\n\n1694\n01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:00,440\nI like the fact that it's got HTTP Fuzzer.\n\n1695\n01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:08,360\nSo you can have it test different\nranges of input into a field on a form.\n\n1696\n01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:14,110\nAnd so if you sniff some unusual traffic\nor did a keyword search of that traffic.\n\n1697\n01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:15,850\nYou maybe see what those results do,\n\n1698\n01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:19,320\nwhat someone was attempting\nto do your investigation.\n\n1699\n01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:23,710\nSo, oh, yeah there's how it responded if\nsomeone puts in this range of values or\n\n1700\n01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:27,100\nthese specific values out of that range,\nthis is what happens this is it and\n\n1701\n01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:31,070\nso now I can see okay this is how\nI'm trying to proceed on that.\n\n1702\n01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:34,240\nSo that's some pretty neat stuff.\n\n1703\n01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:38,990\nThe thing is that you can see on the right\nhands side it categorizes the stuff\n\n1704\n01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:40,100\npretty nicely.\n\n1705\n01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:42,710\nPretty much like Netsparker did.\n\n1706\n01:32:42,710 --> 01:32:45,620\nIt's got that same thing here\ntelling you here's what I found.\n\n1707\n01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:48,740\nThis thing also has some detailed reports.\n\n1708\n01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:50,650\nThis is the trial edition so.\n\n1709\n01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:53,210\nThey don't allow you to\ndo the reports here.\n\n1710\n01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:54,000\nThey have some samples.\n\n1711\n01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,640\n>> I could get my job done in 14 days and\nget my reports kicked out.\n\n1712\n01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:57,730\nI wouldn't have to buy your product.\n\n1713\n01:32:57,730 --> 01:32:59,743\n>> Exactly, they're like no,\nyou're not doing it.\n\n1714\n01:32:59,743 --> 01:33:01,220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We know what's going on.\n\n1715\n01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:05,960\nSo they've got this stuff in here and\nI can scroll down this list.\n\n1716\n01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:10,460\nHere's the whole site architecture\nthat we had in Netsparker.\n\n1717\n01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,270\nHere it's just saying,\n\n1718\n01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:14,830\nyou go to scroll down a list and\nI've got these things here.\n\n1719\n01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:17,440\nSo just another way to display it.\n\n1720\n01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,470\nI kind of think of this like Wikto,\n\n1721\n01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:26,010\nwhich is one of the other tools\nthat I wanna mention here, is.\n\n1722\n01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:30,800\nWikto also displays a structure of a site,\nand the files that are in it, and\n\n1723\n01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,810\nit can also read some of\nthe headers that go back and forth.\n\n1724\n01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:37,090\nSo it's kind of a scaled\ndown version of these two.\n\n1725\n01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:39,000\nBut it doesn't do vulnerability scanning.\n\n1726\n01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,650\nYou gotta factor in your own stuff there.\n\n1727\n01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:44,380\nYou'd have to do, if you want to\ndo SQL injections with those ones,\n\n1728\n01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:46,312\nyou'd have to do the SQL\ninjections manually.\n\n1729\n01:33:46,312 --> 01:33:48,360\nBecause Wikto can help you there.\n\n1730\n01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:54,130\nBut this, Netsparker or there's other\nones out there too that will do this.\n\n1731\n01:33:54,130 --> 01:34:00,260\nThey can observe this interaction, and\nhow people might interact at your site,\n\n1732\n01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:04,060\nthings they might exploit so\nyou can't really beat that.\n\n1733\n01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:07,360\nAnd then there's a whole\nhost of other tools\n\n1734\n01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,360\nout there that will show\nyou various things.\n\n1735\n01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:13,620\nThis thing even generates air logs and\neverything else.\n\n1736\n01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:20,490\nAnd, if memory serves, they update\nthe databases on these things regularly.\n\n1737\n01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:23,560\nSo if you have them, you can download\na new database, it'll check for the new\n\n1738\n01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:27,890\nstuff just like Netsys and Nexpose and\nall the other vulnerability scanners will.\n\n1739\n01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:29,940\n>> A very important part of our\nvulnerability scanners is to make\n\n1740\n01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:32,710\nsure we're up to date on\nthe vulnerabilities that it's looking for.\n\n1741\n01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:36,400\n>> Yeah.\nYou should absolutely have that.\n\n1742\n01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,150\nThe ability to adapt to new conditions.\n\n1743\n01:34:39,150 --> 01:34:41,220\nIt's already gonna be hard enough for\nyou as it is.\n\n1744\n01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:45,530\nAs a pen tester, as a forensics person,\nkeeping up to date on all this stuff.\n\n1745\n01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:46,640\nThat's the toughest part.\n\n1746\n01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:49,830\nThe technical stuff really isn't\nthat difficult to scheme the things.\n\n1747\n01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:53,850\nIt's actually saying that you're gonna\nhave to commit time to keep this up\n\n1748\n01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:55,690\nto date, and that's a very tall order.\n\n1749\n01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:58,920\nSo these tools with that ability\nto update these databases\n\n1750\n01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:02,650\ngo a long way towards easing\nsome of that burden at least.\n\n1751\n01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:04,210\nNot all of it.\nYou're not off the hook.\n\n1752\n01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:06,300\nBut, it will at least\nease some of that stuff.\n\n1753\n01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,520\nSo, that's good right there.\n\n1754\n01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:13,425\n>> So we got, and I threw a link in there\nto that Wikto that you were mentioning.\n\n1755\n01:35:13,425 --> 01:35:16,590\nAnother one thing you wanted to\ntalk about was that WebWatchBot.\n\n1756\n01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:19,200\n>> Yes, there's another one\ncalled WebWatchBot, and\n\n1757\n01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:24,180\nwhat that one does is it will,\nit does monitoring of your site.\n\n1758\n01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:27,740\nAnd it will alert you\nif there's a problem.\n\n1759\n01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:30,570\nIf there's a strike or\nsomething going on, it will pick that up.\n\n1760\n01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:34,750\nSo it's another kind of neat\nthing to put out there.\n\n1761\n01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:37,130\nEspecially if you think\nthe person's coming back,\n\n1762\n01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:39,900\nif you think the person\nmight be doing something.\n\n1763\n01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,030\nAnd they do investigations like that,\n\n1764\n01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:45,730\nwhere they peel back the layers and\nfind out someone's coming back.\n\n1765\n01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:50,976\nAnd they figure, that's a small fish\nto fry, I'm going after the big fish.\n\n1766\n01:35:50,976 --> 01:35:53,318\nSo I'm gonna leave this thing going,\n\n1767\n01:35:53,318 --> 01:35:56,920\nsee how far I can trace this\nback to see whoever is doing it.\n\n1768\n01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:02,133\nSo you might use something Like\nthis software to accomplish that.\n\n1769\n01:36:02,133 --> 01:36:05,155\n>> Another one on our list was the,\nI guess I forgot the name,\n\n1770\n01:36:05,155 --> 01:36:07,280\nhack alert was the one.\n\n1771\n01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,780\n>> Hack alert is another one\njust like the web watch one so\n\n1772\n01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:13,515\nit's another service that will do that for\nyou.\n\n1773\n01:36:13,515 --> 01:36:16,725\nSo you've got some fun\nstuff here to play with.\n\n1774\n01:36:16,725 --> 01:36:19,441\nAgain, we're just working our\nway through the list here.\n\n1775\n01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:25,205\n>> [LAUGH] All right well, so\nwe've got a lot of different tools to\n\n1776\n01:36:25,205 --> 01:36:30,375\ndetect these attacks if they're occurring\nas is as well as go back after the fact.\n\n1777\n01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:34,765\nAs part of the forensic investigator,\nhave to go back and analyze that server.\n\n1778\n01:36:34,765 --> 01:36:37,560\nSee what types of attacks occurred,\n\n1779\n01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,280\nsee what kind of evidence we\ncan find of those attacks.\n\n1780\n01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:44,240\nSo, a lot of different tools\nthat we have that we can use.\n\n1781\n01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:47,420\nSo, Shawn, a lot of good information that\nwe've gone over this episode with our\n\n1782\n01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:52,260\nanalyzing web applications, all the way\nfrom really, what is a web application\n\n1783\n01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:56,760\nall the way down to how to we\ndetect that an attack has occurred.\n\n1784\n01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:00,400\nAnything else that we wanna toss in here?\n\n1785\n01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,070\n>> We can go on and\non here about this stuff.\n\n1786\n01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:08,750\nWe cover a lot of the big areas here, but\n\n1787\n01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:12,520\nyou're gonna have to do some of your\nown investigations because we said,\n\n1788\n01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:16,470\nweb applications,\nthat's a pretty generic title.\n\n1789\n01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:18,090\nSaying I have a web application.\n\n1790\n01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:20,110\nOkay, what does it do?\n\n1791\n01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:21,380\nBecause you gotta define that.\n\n1792\n01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:25,290\nSo when you're doing a forensic\nexamination, make sure\n\n1793\n01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:29,990\nthat you have a full understanding of\nwhat that web application's doing and\n\n1794\n01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:31,790\nwhat the structure of it is.\n\n1795\n01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:35,880\nWhiteboard it out, draw it out, whatever\nit takes to get you to understand that and\n\n1796\n01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,610\nvisualize it.\n\n1797\n01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:38,930\nGet that knowledge.\n\n1798\n01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:42,380\nAnd then, know your limitations too.\n\n1799\n01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:45,530\nYou can very quickly with\nweb applications I've found,\n\n1800\n01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:49,870\nyou can run up against your extent\nof your abilities pretty quickly.\n\n1801\n01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:54,800\nNow considering that you could have any\none of a number of back-end databases,\n\n1802\n01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,830\nit doesn't have to be SQL server,\ndoesn't have to be Oracle.\n\n1803\n01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:00,140\nThere's plenty of other\ndatabases on the market.\n\n1804\n01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:03,750\nAnd then you have all different\nvariations of business logic and\n\n1805\n01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:08,320\nthe middle tier, and\nmy earlier example, that can vary.\n\n1806\n01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:12,330\nAnd those user interfaces,\nI was talking about set top boxes and\n\n1807\n01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:19,030\ntalking about forms on a website, and\nthen talking about apps on your phone.\n\n1808\n01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:22,790\nThose are all user interfaces, and how\nmany different ways can you arrange those?\n\n1809\n01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:24,780\nA lot of different ways.\n\n1810\n01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:27,850\nSo you've really gotta know this\nenvironment, how it's spread out and\n\n1811\n01:38:27,850 --> 01:38:29,590\nstructured, and\n\n1812\n01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:32,150\nthink about that investigative\nprocess when you go in there.\n\n1813\n01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:37,020\nIf you're detecting,\nyou're doing a containment phase in there.\n\n1814\n01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:40,080\nYou have to know what the scope\nof all this is and between that,\n\n1815\n01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:44,330\nto be able to properly contain it and\nlimit the damage.\n\n1816\n01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:47,320\nAnd we didn't even mention stuff like\nhoneypots and stuff like that in here,\n\n1817\n01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:50,170\nbecause that would be something\nelse that they may very well,\n\n1818\n01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:52,610\ndropped into the whole mix\nhere is have a honey pot\n\n1819\n01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:57,070\nacting as a decoy to pull\npeople away from the web app.\n\n1820\n01:38:57,070 --> 01:39:01,280\nSo if you want to go and\ninvestigate something like KFSensor or,\n\n1821\n01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:04,595\nany number of other ones out there,\nyou can do that and\n\n1822\n01:39:04,595 --> 01:39:08,125\nset up your own honeypot and\nsee how that works too.\n\n1823\n01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:13,845\nSo just so many different things you can\ndo here but those would be the key things.\n\n1824\n01:39:13,845 --> 01:39:18,315\nKnow your environment,\nknow that web application, and\n\n1825\n01:39:18,315 --> 01:39:23,615\njust understand how it's set up and\ndon't go outside your area of expertise or\n\n1826\n01:39:23,615 --> 01:39:26,380\nyour domain of expertise as\nthey'll sometimes call it.\n\n1827\n01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:29,210\nBecause you can do that very,\nvery quickly.\n\n1828\n01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:32,750\n>>

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,630\nWelcome to another episode of ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,190\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oreano.\n\n7\n00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,580\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,890\n>> Doing pretty good, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,040\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,850\nWe're doing another episode for\nour digital forensic investigator series.\n\n11\n00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,020\nAnd in this episode, we're going to go\ninto our, what are we doing today Sean?\n\n12\n00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,240\nInvestigating email crimes.\n\n13\n00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240\nSo, lot's of fun here.\n\n14\n00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,322\nProbably a pretty common thing.\n\n15\n00:00:57,322 --> 00:01:00,908\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] Oh yeah, a lot of\nthe e-mails you've seen from friends and\n\n16\n00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:02,149\nfamily seem like crimes.\n\n17\n00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,180\nThe way they word them and what they send.\n\n18\n00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,760\nSo, yeah, that's the big topic for\nthis episode\n\n19\n00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,050\nis getting into different ways to\ntrack e-mails, investigate e-mails.\n\n20\n00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,660\nAnd then discuss some of the crimes\nthat can go along with that as well\n\n21\n00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,360\nas see some of the tools for\ntracking emails for fun and profit.\n\n22\n00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,940\n>> For fun and profit,\nI like it, I like profit anyway.\n\n23\n00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:32,110\nBecause sometime, email, is a lot of times\nit could be the crime itself,all right?\n\n24\n00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,640\nWhere they're using the email to\nperpetrate the crime that we're\n\n25\n00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,520\ninvestigating.\n\n26\n00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,410\nOther times,\nthe email is just evidence supporting\n\n27\n00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,740\nother evidence that we've found during\nthe course of an investigation, right?\n\n28\n00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,820\n>> Yes, that's exactly it.\n\n29\n00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,570\nIt can both be the mechanism of the crime,\nor\n\n30\n00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,030\nit can support other crimes,\nso absolutely.\n\n31\n00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,360\nIt's pretty much going to always fall into\none of those two categories not matter\n\n32\n00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,710\nwhat you look at.\n\n33\n00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,370\nIt's either going to be how you carry it\nout, or how you support other activities.\n\n34\n00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,930\nIt's going to be one of the two.\n\n35\n00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,840\n>> Stupid criminals, they perpetrate some\ncrime and then they wanna email details,\n\n36\n00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,370\nor leave that trail,\nleave that paper trail, right.\n\n37\n00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,180\nAnd, that's how they get caught.\n\n38\n00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,200\n>> So, that's the thing nowadays,\npeople love,\n\n39\n00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,000\nI think you really hit it on the head\nwith that is, it's stupid criminals.\n\n40\n00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,250\nOr heck, you just say it's\nthe way people are nowadays.\n\n41\n00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,140\nThe majority of people are is that.\n\n42\n00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,800\nWith email they just love\nsending stuff via email.\n\n43\n00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,130\nThen we have social networking\nto build on top of that.\n\n44\n00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,950\nThey think I have to know\nevery part of their lives or\n\n45\n00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,444\neveryone wants to know\npart of their lives.\n\n46\n00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:44,980\n>> [INAUDIBLE].\n>> And I'm like,\n\n47\n00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,750\nthey're talking about their bathroom\nhabits, all the stuff they did.\n\n48\n00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,335\nI've seen people say sucks, oh what sucks?\n\n49\n00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:57,070\n[LAUGH] You just put one word up there,\nso that doesn't help me out.\n\n50\n00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,550\nSo yeah, you hit it,\nthere's this trail there,\n\n51\n00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,370\nand it's important to remember that when\nyou're talking about investigating emails.\n\n52\n00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,220\nIs that a lot of people\nunconsciously what they do and\n\n53\n00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,460\nthey think they've always got\nan inside line of how to do it.\n\n54\n00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,912\nI think one that's really good to\nmention up front was David Patreyas.\n\n55\n00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:21,550\nThe general,all his stuff you\n\n56\n00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,220\nwould think that someone in his position\ngot that far would know better.\n\n57\n00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,180\nAnd he was what?\n\n58\n00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,640\nThe head of the CIA,\ndid I get that right, the CIA?\n\n59\n00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,530\n>> I think so.\n\n60\n00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,380\n>> He was the head of State\n[INAUDIBLE] of the army.\n\n61\n00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,310\n4 star, goes over to the CIA,\nheads that, and he gets caught,\n\n62\n00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,050\nhaving an affair with another woman.\n\n63\n00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:46,730\nAnd the way they caught him, was there\nwas other activities suggesting it,\n\n64\n00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,030\nbut they found all the other\nevidence they needed in Gmail.\n\n65\n00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,460\nThey thought they'd get away with it,\n\n66\n00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,690\nthey thought they not have any tracks\nby not actually sending the emails.\n\n67\n00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,740\nHim and his mistress actually\nsaved it in the drafts folder, and\n\n68\n00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,310\nso they just shared that account,\nthey just tied it to the drafts folder.\n\n69\n00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,930\nThe other ones would go in there and\njust save it to the drafts folder.\n\n70\n00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,080\nIt was a Gmail account,\nit'd still save it in the archive.\n\n71\n00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,220\nAll over the place.\n\n72\n00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,630\n>> I wonder where they're\nsaving that draft.\n\n73\n00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,960\n>> People love documenting stuff.\n\n74\n00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,975\nNot condoning that behavior or\nanything that he was engaging at all.\n\n75\n00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:26,115\nBut you think you're going to do it,\n\n76\n00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:28,785\nthat was not the way to\ndocument your whole thing.\n\n77\n00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,765\nEverything you need is like here,\nexplain this,\n\n78\n00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:32,670\nI've got all the paperwork right here.\n\n79\n00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,555\n[LAUGH]\n>> It goes back to the lack of knowledge,\n\n80\n00:04:36,555 --> 00:04:38,635\nand thinking when I delete a file,\nit's gone.\n\n81\n00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:40,055\nSame thing with e-mails.\n\n82\n00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:41,925\nI delete my e-mail, it's gone.\n\n83\n00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:43,485\nIt's not in my recycle bin anymore.\n\n84\n00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:46,270\nNobody can get access to it,\nit's really gone.\n\n85\n00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,490\nNot so much.\n\n86\n00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,480\n>> It's always there, it goes back to the\nwhole thing, you're always leaving a mark\n\n87\n00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,980\nsomeplace, even if you don't\nconsciously aware of it, it is there.\n\n88\n00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,500\nSo, email is no different\nthan anything else.\n\n89\n00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,730\nLike I said, you don't delete it,\nit's there someplace,\n\n90\n00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,710\nI just have to know to look for it.\n\n91\n00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,410\nAnd that's what we're teaching,\nis how to track it.\n\n92\n00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,180\nIn how to find the stuff that people\nmay have thought was gone forever,\n\n93\n00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,050\nwe know better.\n\n94\n00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,450\nWe're just going to learn\nwhere to look for it.\n\n95\n00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,310\n>> Exactly.\n\n96\n00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,620\nSo let's just cover some basics.\n\n97\n00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,585\nEmail stands for electronic mail.\n\n98\n00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:21,853\n[LAUGH]\n>> This is how you spell it.\n\n99\n00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:23,350\n[LAUGH]\n>> E-M-A-I-L.\n\n100\n00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,280\nSo we're talking about email,\n\n101\n00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,020\nwe do need to understand some basics of\nit because there are different protocols.\n\n102\n00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,170\nFor example, that we can use to send and\nreceive emails, and\n\n103\n00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,700\nthat could make a difference in the way\nwe proceed in our investigation, right?\n\n104\n00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,670\n>> Yeah, it's,\n\n105\n00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:44,000\nthis is really probably for a lot of\nyou just email system 101, really.\n\n106\n00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,860\nWe have the three basic protocols,\niMap, pop and SMTP.\n\n107\n00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,710\nThere are no real big surprises there.\n\n108\n00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,060\nWe can throw in HTTP for web access and\nsome of the other things it goes with.\n\n109\n00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,630\nBut it really boils down to these three,\nor\n\n110\n00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,930\nif you want to say HTTP, four, protocols.\n\n111\n00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,630\nNo big secrets there.\n\n112\n00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,340\nIt's just understand those, which ones\nare for sending, which ones are receiving.\n\n113\n00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,520\nWe've got iMap that allows you\nto leave them on the server, and\n\n114\n00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,160\nsynchronize them on client.\n\n115\n00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,445\nPop pulls them down and\ndownloads them to your system and\n\n116\n00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:24,705\nthen we have SMT for sending them.\n\n117\n00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:27,365\nAnd then of course HTTP\nis the web protocol.\n\n118\n00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:30,145\nAnd you're just understand\nthe mechanics of it.\n\n119\n00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:33,580\nSending, receiving and\nreally how they work.\n\n120\n00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,630\nBut I'm sure a lot of you have that.\n\n121\n00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,090\nHave that down already because\nthat's been around for ages.\n\n122\n00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,190\nThere's no real big change there.\n\n123\n00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,410\nBut do remember some of the things\nthat we have that allow\n\n124\n00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,100\ninvestigations to be easier\nare that those protocols,\n\n125\n00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,990\nreally none of the email\nprotocols out of the box.\n\n126\n00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,180\nHave any security on them.\n\n127\n00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,690\nThey just weren't built for that.\n\n128\n00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,180\nThey were built to send and receive,\nand deal with the transmissions and\n\n129\n00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,450\nmessages, nothing else other than that.\n\n130\n00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,320\nThey do those things well, but everything\nelse they're kind of just horrible at.\n\n131\n00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,950\nSo you want to kind of bring your own\nsolution to the table in the form of\n\n132\n00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:12,700\nSSL or VPNs, or IPsec,\nyeah, PGP, anything.\n\n133\n00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,000\nIt's that part of it so\nwe understand the protocols and\n\n134\n00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,710\nwe understand the security\nthat will be there or\n\n135\n00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,530\nmay not be there depending how\nthe person set the system up.\n\n136\n00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,810\nAnd you're gonna be encountering those\nbecause people are getting Smarter\n\n137\n00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,740\nabout protecting their messages and\ntheir email in general.\n\n138\n00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,200\nThey are being wiser about it and being\naware where there are little holes there.\n\n139\n00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,020\nAnd that is not just the ISPs,\nthat is the end user,\n\n140\n00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,070\nthey are more aware of what to look for.\n\n141\n00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,280\nWe've trained people for\nhow long to look for,\n\n142\n00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,760\nwhen they go to web mail,\nnot HTTP but HTTPs.\n\n143\n00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,500\nThey really kind of\ntrained people with that.\n\n144\n00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,118\nTo train their eye balls\nto see that up there and\n\n145\n00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:57,746\nthen to configure your\nclients a certain way.\n\n146\n00:07:57,746 --> 00:08:02,321\nIt's much more out there than it was but\nit's not Always out there.\n\n147\n00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:06,623\n>> Yeah, companies are definitely spending\nmore time and more money on educating\n\n148\n00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:11,040\ntheir users because that's a hope part\nof security is end user education.\n\n149\n00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,980\nAnd people watch the news and\nthey see things and\n\n150\n00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,170\nit's been in the news over the last\ndecade or last few years or stuff.\n\n151\n00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:23,290\nSo, slowly but surely people\nare wising up to how all this works.\n\n152\n00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,380\nAnd let's go back for just one second,\n\n153\n00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,480\nI'll make sure we refresh\non those protocols again.\n\n154\n00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,320\nI know you guys know this stuff,\nbut the big difference there IMAP,\n\n155\n00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,160\nis the one that's going to\nleave a copy on the server.\n\n156\n00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,270\nSo, if you're using an email\nservice that's IMAP, or\n\n157\n00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,670\nyou're connecting with that IMAP protocol,\nwhen you get those messages on your\n\n158\n00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,000\ncomputer there's still a copy\nof them up on the server.\n\n159\n00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,800\nThat way if you go to another machine and\nyou log on and check your email,\n\n160\n00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,600\nyou'll see those same emails there.\n\n161\n00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,790\nRight?\nYou'll still see everything that's\n\n162\n00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,730\nin your in box.\n\n163\n00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,130\nIf you're using POP, POP pulls it down\nto the local machine off the server so\n\n164\n00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,720\nif I go to another machine and\n\n165\n00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,852\ngo check my email,\nI won't see those same emails there.\n\n166\n00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:01,220\nThey'll go in between iMap and POP.\n\n167\n00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,360\nNow that's not saying that there's\nstill not a copy up there on that email\n\n168\n00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,150\nserver that we can recover if we need to,\nbut\n\n169\n00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,035\nfrom the end user perspective,\nPOP pulls it down to that local machine.\n\n170\n00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:11,848\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> That's\n\n171\n00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:13,090\na very-\n>> Use it up.\n\n172\n00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,551\n>> Pay attention to that detail people.\n\n173\n00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:16,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because that's important.\n\n174\n00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,070\nIt pulls it down.\n\n175\n00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,080\nThat's what the average Joe sees and\nother people in IT see.\n\n176\n00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,470\nIs that, yeah, it's pulled it down.\n\n177\n00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,580\nIt's gone, bye-bye.\n\n178\n00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,070\nIt's been downloaded from the server.\n\n179\n00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,070\nNot for what we're doing.\n\n180\n00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,040\nFor what we're doing, we know better.\n\n181\n00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,710\nWe know it's there someplace.\n\n182\n00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,910\nNo matter what happens, it's there.\n\n183\n00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,130\nYou know, the difference between IMAP and\nPOP that are being talked about, for\n\n184\n00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,480\nmost people, are just end user experience,\nmail client.\n\n185\n00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,580\nIt has nothing to do\nwith the forensic stuff.\n\n186\n00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,130\nThere's still a copy someplace,\njust how easy it is to get it.\n\n187\n00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,030\n>> Exactly.\n\n188\n00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,810\nThe point is, if you're investigating\none machine as part of a crime scene,\n\n189\n00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,920\nyou might be looking at those emails,\n\n190\n00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,300\nagain after we've done all\nof our proper procedures and\n\n191\n00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,710\ndocumented and image and stuff like that,\nyou might not see all the emails.\n\n192\n00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,270\nBecause if they were using a POP client\nand they've checked their mail from\n\n193\n00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,880\nsomewhere else, they might not all be\nvisible on that machine, but then we do\n\n194\n00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,580\nour investigation, we go back to the mail\nservice providers and find them that way.\n\n195\n00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,440\nAnd then POP too, some pop clients will\nactually let you check the little mark.\n\n196\n00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,810\nIt does leave a copy up on the server so\nit behaves a little more like iMap.\n\n197\n00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,780\nBut again,\nthat's from the end-user's perspective,\n\n198\n00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,300\nnot from the DFI's perspective.\n\n199\n00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,310\nAnd then SMTP is our stored forward,\n\n200\n00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,365\nright, or how we send the mail\nBetween the different mail servers.\n\n201\n00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:40,275\nSo we got the basics down then, for email\njust a quick little review for everybody.\n\n202\n00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:45,115\nLet's talk about email crimes then, and so\nwhat kinds of things are we looking at or\n\n203\n00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:49,450\ntalking about Sean, when we talk\nabout email in an investigation?\n\n204\n00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,860\nYeah, we're talking about email.\n\n205\n00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,870\nIt's like you were bringing\nup at the beginning Mike.\n\n206\n00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:59,350\nEmail is either going to be something that\nis either the instrument of how you carry\n\n207\n00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,380\nout the crime, whatever it is, you know,\nit's either the instrument that you\n\n208\n00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:10,030\nused to carry out the crime, or something\nused to support another activity.\n\n209\n00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,750\nSo it's always going to break\ninto one those two categories no\n\n210\n00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,320\nmatter what you look at.\n\n211\n00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,400\nSo all the crimes, all the things you\nheard, fishing, spamming, identity theft,\n\n212\n00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,240\nharassing, all those things, those all\nfit in to one of those two categories,\n\n213\n00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,460\nso it's understanding when you're\nlooking at it which one it fits in,\n\n214\n00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,100\nbecause it's definitely going\nto drive your investigation.\n\n215\n00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,100\nIf something is supporting a crime,\nthen just by wording it that way\n\n216\n00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,510\nit's supporting a crime,\nit's not the actual crime itself.\n\n217\n00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,180\nThere's other things we\nhave to investigate.\n\n218\n00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,130\nSo you have to take a look at that.\n\n219\n00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,130\nThere could be people\noutside of it doing this.\n\n220\n00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,230\nThere's been plenty of cases that\nhave gone through the court system\n\n221\n00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,880\nall over the world,\nwhere the email wasn't the actual crime.\n\n222\n00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,040\nIt was that someone had their\ndocumentation there, you know.\n\n223\n00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,375\nBut then, yes,\nyou do have it as the actual crime itself.\n\n224\n00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:12,950\nSo we kind of need to break those down to\ngive you some examples to kind of help you\n\n225\n00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,930\nunderstand and\nput them in the right categories.\n\n226\n00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,430\n>> How we fit these into\nthe different categories.\n\n227\n00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:25,090\nSo let's start with the one basically\nsending the email is the actual crime.\n\n228\n00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,590\n>> Yeah.\n\n229\n00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,390\nEmail, if it's going to be the actual\ncrime itself you've got phishing\n\n230\n00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,190\njust phishing on a generic level\nwould be a case of the email\n\n231\n00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,720\nbeing the instrument of the crime,\nactually the scene of the crime itself.\n\n232\n00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,510\n>> Or I've sent an email to try to read,\nyou've got to go change your password with\n\n233\n00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,220\nPayPal, click on this link\nto change your password.\n\n234\n00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,100\nOr something like that?\n\n235\n00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,190\n>> Yeah, that would be it, but\nif you actually caused the person\n\n236\n00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,652\nto put them in a situation that they might\ndo, they might engage in identity theft,\n\n237\n00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:03,390\nthen it's not entirely the crime itself.\n\n238\n00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,420\nYou caused the person to do something,\n\n239\n00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,470\nso if you go to your scenario,\nit changes the password.\n\n240\n00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,010\nAnd that is intercepted through cross\nsite scripting or something like that.\n\n241\n00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,790\nAnd some criminal gets that and then\nuses that to steal the persons identity.\n\n242\n00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,336\nNow we have email as being something\nthat's supporting another crime.\n\n243\n00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:27,460\n>> So really kind of tricky then to try to\ncategorize them and I think, like most of\n\n244\n00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,820\nthe things we've talked about here,\nsometimes they don't fit into these nice\n\n245\n00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,120\ntidy categories, but it's easier to break\nthem down if we try to categorize them.\n\n246\n00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,090\nSome things might be a little gray,\nmight fall between the two.\n\n247\n00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,920\n>> Always shades of gray, it's never\nnice little black and white lines you\n\n248\n00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,590\ncan put stuff into this box or\nthat box, it's rare that it's that way.\n\n249\n00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,169\n>> And then you got spam on\nour list of email crimes here.\n\n250\n00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:53,005\nIs spam a crime?\n\n251\n00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:56,560\n>> [LAUGH] I feel like it, yeah.\n\n252\n00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,780\nI feel like it's molesting\nmy inbox all the time.\n\n253\n00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,540\nJust shoving all sorts\nof things into my inbox.\n\n254\n00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,500\nIt's kind of interesting though, we know\nwhat spam is unsolicited mass email,\n\n255\n00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,700\nthat's kind of the generic\ndescription of it,\n\n256\n00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,860\nbut we used to have people sending,\nthey still do send tons of spam,\n\n257\n00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,540\nbut we don't see as much as we used to\nbecause of the filtering that's done, but\n\n258\n00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,050\nthere's still tons of it out there.\n\n259\n00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,590\nThey've got clever with it too.\n\n260\n00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,260\nThey've found new ways, and they're\nalways finding new ways to get around it.\n\n261\n00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,590\nSpam may not be just a simple annoyance.\n\n262\n00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,120\nThere actually could be other\nstuff happening there too.\n\n263\n00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,640\nSo, never forget that.\n\n264\n00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,030\nI saw the pass through and\nDavid was through here to the chatroom.\n\n265\n00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,920\nHe says, why couldn't complex\nhackers communicate via messages\n\n266\n00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,086\nthat look like spam.\n\n267\n00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:02,865\nYou know, that's\n>> [CROSSTALK] Your wife's pretty\n\n268\n00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:04,361\nsmart on that one.\n\n269\n00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:09,540\nI don't know if she's in technology or\nnot I would tell you go look\n\n270\n00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,730\nat something we talked about\nin the CEH course, spam mimic.\n\n271\n00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,850\nYou may remember that one,\nspam mimic you can use\n\n272\n00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,880\nthe power steganography to type a message\nand code it and place that into an email.\n\n273\n00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,190\nLooks like a spam message but there is\nactually something imbedded inside that\n\n274\n00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:34,870\nyou just have to re run the algorithm on\nit to extract whatever that message is.\n\n275\n00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,920\nSo absolutely could happen.\n\n276\n00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,110\n>> And I posted an interesting link in the\nchat room there it is something I found\n\n277\n00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,120\ntalking about first\nfelony cases in the U.S.\n\n278\n00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,040\nwhere a spam sender was convicted\nin the first felony case.\n\n279\n00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,770\nThis was back in 2004.\n\n280\n00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:54,039\nIt had to do with a brother and\nsister sending a bunch of junk email or\n\n281\n00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,346\nspam out to some, all of the AOL members.\n\n282\n00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:58,560\nAnd they got prosecuted.\n\n283\n00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,089\nI think they ended up with a $7500 fine or\nsomething like that.\n\n284\n00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:03,628\nSo\n>> I was joking but\n\n285\n00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:07,400\nspam really is a crime,\nbecause it causes lots of problems.\n\n286\n00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:13,120\nCompanies downtime for their employees\nfiltering through spam, clogging up email\n\n287\n00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,330\nservers, all kinds of nasty things,\nso it is a prosecutable crime.\n\n288\n00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,680\n>> In fact, one of the things we are gonna\ntalk about a little more in depth in\n\n289\n00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,980\nthis episode is\n>> Is the Can of Spam Act here in the US.\n\n290\n00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,690\nThere actually is a law\nspecifically written for that, and\n\n291\n00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,940\nsince it was enacted there\nhave been people prosecuted.\n\n292\n00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,830\nThis is just one of the handful\nhave been prosecuted.\n\n293\n00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,858\nThat actually if you can believe,\nyou said $7500 dollars they got it, fun.\n\n294\n00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:44,659\n>> Yeah.\n\n295\n00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:46,120\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's-\n\n296\n00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,240\n>> That was like 2004, so\n\n297\n00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,450\nbefore it really started having\nways of dealing with it.\n\n298\n00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,060\nDefinitely that would be a slap on\nthe wrist compared to now a days.\n\n299\n00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,760\nWith the fines that you're gonna receive.\n\n300\n00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,210\nAnd jail time.\n>> If you can believe it or\n\n301\n00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,070\nnot they'll do worse than that.\n\n302\n00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,120\nYou can look it up.\n\n303\n00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,880\nI can't remember the specific,\nall the details specific incident,\n\n304\n00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,870\nbut there actually was an incident,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n305\n00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,380\nsomeone got 17 years in prison for\nspamming.\n\n306\n00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,300\nSo, and a whole bunch of things came in,\nbut there's actually a list,\n\n307\n00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,640\nif you dig around enough,\nand really are patient.\n\n308\n00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,280\nYou can find a list out there of\nwhat they consider the top 10 or\n\n309\n00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,390\n20 spammers in the world, and those are\nthe ones that if they're here in the US,\n\n310\n00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,300\nthey're gonna get targeted\nby law enforcement.\n\n311\n00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,050\nAnd they're just gathering\nevidence through people like us,\n\n312\n00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:41,790\nforensic investigators and\nISP's and all of that together.\n\n313\n00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,550\nAnd once they get enough they will\nprosecute people off that list.\n\n314\n00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:50,390\nThey have shown that they don't have\nany reservations in doing that.\n\n315\n00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,200\nThe one that got 17 years, the $7,500,\n\n316\n00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,490\nthose are just, you know two,\nthere's more than that, and\n\n317\n00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,950\nthey're not messing around, they consider\nit a violation of the Can of Spam Act.\n\n318\n00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,888\nThey consider it a theft of services,\n\n319\n00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:10,990\nbecause you are stealing bandwidth\nfrom the ISP and that company.\n\n320\n00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,050\nAnd then you've got the stuff where if\nyou hammer a company like you said,\n\n321\n00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,330\nyou're clogging up there stuff.\n\n322\n00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,000\nSo, there's a lot of things they can get\nyou on, and they've shown that you know\n\n323\n00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,360\nwhat, we're getting sick of this,\nwe're gonna start hammering away on that.\n\n324\n00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,720\n>> And tough to stop because it's so\nprofitable, is the big thing.\n\n325\n00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,980\nThese spammers are making\ngood money doing this.\n\n326\n00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,840\nDefinitely cold but I tell you if\nthey ever started a spam task force\n\n327\n00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,955\nwhere that's all they do is go for\nspammers, I volunteer.\n\n328\n00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:40,845\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I would love to take these guys out.\n\n329\n00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:43,220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Another things that makes me laugh,\n\n330\n00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,620\nwe'll get back on point, is everybody\nhates the spam in their inbox,\n\n331\n00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,180\nhow about the spam in my darn mailbox\nthat's just out on the street?\n\n332\n00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,989\n>> Ugh.\n>> Nobody cares about that.\n\n333\n00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:53,834\nHow do I get rid of that crap too?\n\n334\n00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:54,694\nHow many trees can we save?\n\n335\n00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:57,920\nAnyway,\n>> There's actually a list you can get\n\n336\n00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,620\non for that.\n\n337\n00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,520\nI had the same problem,\nI just hate that stuff, so yeah,\n\n338\n00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,850\nthere's a list you can get on it.\n\n339\n00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,000\nIt can take two to three months\nto get it off the junk mail.\n\n340\n00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,970\nBut you can do that and\nmake your life a little easier.\n\n341\n00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,970\nI hate that stuff too.\n\n342\n00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,510\nI just shred it.\n\n343\n00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,240\n>> I know my mailman hates me because\nI check my mail once every two weeks.\n\n344\n00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,670\nBecause nothing is in\nthere that's important.\n\n345\n00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,539\nI do everything,\nbills online and everything.\n\n346\n00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:22,420\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n347\n00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,260\n>> Anyway, so back to DFI,\nwe'll get off of that.\n\n348\n00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,550\nSpam, bad.\n\n349\n00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,910\nAnother one is mail bombing.\n\n350\n00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,720\nMail storm, kinda.\n\n351\n00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,770\n>> Yeah, they're kinda, sorta related\n>> You look at mail bombing,\n\n352\n00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,080\nsomeone just firing\na bunch of emails at you,\n\n353\n00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,910\nand that's an effect,\na big denial of service, or\n\n354\n00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:51,140\nslowing down your service, and it may even\nstop it if you start filling inboxes and\n\n355\n00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,750\nstuff like that,\nyou could have some problems there.\n\n356\n00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,490\nMailbombings, sometimes you\nsee people pull it as pranks,\n\n357\n00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,980\nI think that's kind of where it started,\nreally.\n\n358\n00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,210\nThey would just send\na bunch of emails out.\n\n359\n00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,810\nThen you get a mail storm,\nwhich all of us have been through this.\n\n360\n00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,580\nEvery last one of us in here.\n\n361\n00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,103\nIf you haven't, you're lying.\n\n362\n00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Once you hear what it is\n\n363\n00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,520\n>> If you say you haven't, you're lying,\n\n364\n00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,025\nand you need to get out of my class.\n\n365\n00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:18,300\n[LAUGH]\n>> I've never been part of a mail storm,\n\n366\n00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,590\nI don't' know what you're talking about.\n\n367\n00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,280\n>> A mail storm is one of\nthose things where you\n\n368\n00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,020\nsee where someone sends an email\nto a distribution list at work.\n\n369\n00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,450\nIt's usually there or\nsend email to a distribution list, and\n\n370\n00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,700\neverybody does a reply all to it,\nthat's a maelstrom.\n\n371\n00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,660\n>> Happy birthday,\neverybody wish somebody a happy birthday.\n\n372\n00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,960\nDon't reply to the person\nthat's having the birthday,\n\n373\n00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,005\nreply to everybody on the list.\n\n374\n00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:44,540\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n375\n00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,950\nthen you love the ones where\nsomeone's like take me off this list.\n\n376\n00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,330\nHe replied, I'm getting all these emails,\nhe replies to all and\n\n377\n00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,300\nthen everyone else,\ndon't reply to everyone.\n\n378\n00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,730\nThat person's replying to everyone and\nit keeps going crazy.\n\n379\n00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,814\nThat's a male storm so [CROSSTALK] for it.\n\n380\n00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:00,961\n>> [CROSSTALK] part of a male storm.\n\n381\n00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:02,909\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:06,963\n>> Yeah, so it's funny, it's like it's,\n\n383\n00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:13,975\nuntil I got into stuff like this,\nI didn't know there was a name for that.\n\n384\n00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:15,650\n[LAUGH]\n>> Think about that, people.\n\n385\n00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,947\nIt happens so\nmuch that they had to make a name for it.\n\n386\n00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:20,298\n>> Right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:22,066\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, and the thing is,\n\n388\n00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:26,350\norganizations rely on their e-mail for\na good portion of their business.\n\n389\n00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,050\nIt's how we communicate with business\npartners, we put out the whatever the case\n\n390\n00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,360\nmay be and that's why it's so important or\nwhy it's so frustrating for businesses and\n\n391\n00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,910\nwhy we spend the time on creating these\nlaws and investigating these spammers.\n\n392\n00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,720\nBecause in the end it's\ncosting the business money.\n\n393\n00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,600\nWe gotta spend mega bucks on filters and\ndevices, like we run a barracuda here.\n\n394\n00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,890\nYou spend all this time and\neffort and money.\n\n395\n00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,280\nAnd trying to prevent that stuff, and\n\n396\n00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,430\nthat's money that could be used for\nother things within the organization,\n\n397\n00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,440\nso it's just tough,\nwe gotta try to battle that.\n\n398\n00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,180\nAnd in our case,\nwe wanna go find them and prosecute them.\n\n399\n00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,645\nSo we're the ones that come in and\nlook for the traces.\n\n400\n00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:07,292\nYou're the one that\nstarted that mail storm.\n\n401\n00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:12,975\n[LAUGH]\n>> I heard a good one that someone said.\n\n402\n00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:14,395\nI wish I came up with this.\n\n403\n00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:18,300\nI heard it about paperwork and\nthen I heard the same applied to email.\n\n404\n00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,695\nWas email is like the embalming\nfluid of businesses.\n\n405\n00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:24,770\n[LAUGH]\n>> It creates the look of life when

is.\n\n408\n00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,400\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n409\n00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,260\na lot of that was about the sending part\nof the email crimes, and on the supported\n\n410\n00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:45,400\nside, things like harassment\n>> Yeah, harassment of all types,\n\n411\n00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,890\nharassment can just be some one\nbugging about stuff over and\n\n412\n00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,030\nover and over again and then you\n>> And\n\n413\n00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,220\nthen of course you get\nthe sexual harassment ones where\n\n414\n00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,270\nsomeone is asking someone on a date or\nmaking lude comments through email.\n\n415\n00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,040\nAnd that's one of those four\nthings that you go back too.\n\n416\n00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,750\nWe talk about that people\nlove documenting stuff.\n\n417\n00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,670\nYou would think that someone\n\n418\n00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,280\nwould have a little bit of common sense,\n>> Right.\n\n419\n00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,140\n>> Not to do that.\n\n420\n00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,950\nAnd they are just sending\nstuff over there.\n\n421\n00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,410\nI mean good for us to prosecute\nthe person and get them out of here.\n\n422\n00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,200\nWe have got everything we need.\n\n423\n00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,550\nBut you think people have more\nsense than that, but they don't.\n\n424\n00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:21,670\n>> Using your email as a way to attack\nsomebody is kinda like wearing a GoPro\n\n425\n00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,500\nwhen you go rob the bank right.\n\n426\n00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,080\nLet me record what I'm doing.\n\n427\n00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,530\nIt does make it easy for\nthe DFIs for sure.\n\n428\n00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,030\nI have to admit, I just watched a I\nthink it was Lifetime of all things.\n\n429\n00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,010\nMy girlfriend was watching\na movie called Cyber Bully.\n\n430\n00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,030\nWe'll edit that out.\n\n431\n00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,818\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n432\n00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:40,298\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n433\n00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:44,693\nI was watching a Lifetime movie called\nCyber Bully, and it was that very thing.\n\n434\n00:23:44,693 --> 00:23:48,080\nIt was a very interesting about\na younger person in junior high,\n\n435\n00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,904\nI believe it was and she was getting\nbullied by all the different students\n\n436\n00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:55,188\nat the school sending harassing emails and\nthings like that.\n\n437\n00:23:55,188 --> 00:23:58,114\nAnd this was something that\nyou've probably seen in the news\n\n438\n00:23:58,114 --> 00:23:59,179\n>> I hear in the US for\n\n439\n00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:04,270\nsure over the last couple of years is\nnasty something we have to deal with.\n\n440\n00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,410\n>> Yes it is.\n\n441\n00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,550\nHarassment is a very real thing and the\nbullying, yeah, definitely fits in there.\n\n442\n00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,460\nI mean that also happens\non social networking too.\n\n443\n00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,670\nAs far as just the email context,\n\n444\n00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,430\nit's probably a lot more common\nthan you would even realize.\n\n445\n00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,570\nOf all forms that people do just\nthe regular harassment, then\n\n446\n00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,220\nthey do the sexual harassment and then\nthere's all sorts of variations of that.\n\n447\n00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,470\nI'm seeing people get harassed for\nreligious reasons or\n\n448\n00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,970\nfor political reasons.\n\n449\n00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,460\nYou'll see those things get passed around.\n\n450\n00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,900\nAnd you may get called in on any of those.\n\n451\n00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,250\nAnd I've seen them on all of those.\n\n452\n00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:50,744\nI've actually seen quite a few of\nthe sexual harassment ones where,\n\n453\n00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:54,059\nyou just kind of just\nscratch your head and\n\n454\n00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,810\nthink [CROSSTALK] yeah,\nyou're just kind of staring at it.\n\n455\n00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:03,778\nI remember one where some guy not only\ndocumented in his email what he was doing,\n\n456\n00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:08,377\nemailing this person, but they also\nwere able to find stuff in there, and\n\n457\n00:25:08,377 --> 00:25:11,600\nother clues that the guy\nwas selling key loggers.\n\n458\n00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,190\nAnd other stuff on her computer and\nher mobile devices, too,\n\n459\n00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,390\nbasically to stalk her, so,\npretty scary situation, and\n\n460\n00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,370\nthe forensic investigator that worked for\nthe company found all these things out.\n\n461\n00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,290\nSo they had everything they\nneeded to say get out of here.\n\n462\n00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,180\n>> And then we got,\n\n463\n00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,950\nblackmailing is another type of\ncrime that can take place via email.\n\n464\n00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,050\n>> Yeah,\nwhat can you say about blackmailing.\n\n465\n00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,850\nHolding something over someone and\nthreatening then to do something.\n\n466\n00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,550\nAnd threatening to release it if\nthey don't do something in return.\n\n467\n00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,100\nIt's not unheard of.\n\n468\n00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:54,990\nIt's actually something that is\nreasonably common, unfortunately and\n\n469\n00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,980\nit works for the same reason\nthat we have for lots of stuff.\n\n470\n00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,630\nPeople put stuff in email, or\npeople over share stuff far too often.\n\n471\n00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,300\nAnd it's easy enough to get those things.\n\n472\n00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,810\n>> And then we've already kinda mentioned\nit, but identity theft is another one that\n\n473\n00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:15,325\ncan start through the email system\n>> Yeah and incredibly common,\n\n474\n00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:22,785\nthis is just a one way you can [INAUDIBLE]\nof course, but it's very common to do.\n\n475\n00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:26,705\nFishing is one way pulled off.\n\n476\n00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:28,550\nBut, there's other ways too.\n\n477\n00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,965\nThere are plenty of other ways.\n\n478\n00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:32,320\nBut, people get identity\ntheft all the time.\n\n479\n00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,160\nThey just don't think or\nthey start to turn their brains off\n\n480\n00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,540\nas I like to say because they see\nall the stuff from Microsoft or\n\n481\n00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,980\nwhoever else saying hey, we've got all\nthe stuff built into the browser, and\n\n482\n00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,120\nwhatever shiny version of Windows we have\nthat stops phishing, and all those things.\n\n483\n00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,050\nSo, people put their faith in that.\n\n484\n00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,463\nYou don't put your faith in those things.\n\n485\n00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:56,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Those things are just to give\n\n486\n00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,100\nyou another pair of eyes or\nsomething else that's got your back.\n\n487\n00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,150\nIt doesn't mean that you've now got\na blank check to turn your brain off and\n\n488\n00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,200\nnot do this because those\nthings do make mistakes.\n\n489\n00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,435\nAnd people,\nthey'll fall in that trap all the time.\n\n490\n00:27:13,435 --> 00:27:16,895\nThey get a little comfortable or relaxed\nbecause they think they've got this\n\n491\n00:27:16,895 --> 00:27:19,565\napplication that's going\nto keep them safe.\n\n492\n00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:23,295\nSo they maybe put things in emails that\nthey shouldn't, or respond to emails\n\n493\n00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:26,345\nthinking it can't be a bad thing because\nwe've got that Barracuda running, so\n\n494\n00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:29,595\nthis has got to be a good email and\nI'll go ahead and reply to it.\n\n495\n00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:30,415\nThings like that.\n\n496\n00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:37,640\n>> Yeah, they just do not think and\nso e-mail just makes it a lot easier.\n\n497\n00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,650\nJust a whole lot easier\nto do these things.\n\n498\n00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,220\n>> And it's easier,\n\n499\n00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,910\nwith an e-mail it's easier to\nspoof who I am in the first place.\n\n500\n00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,990\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> As far as the bad guy goes.\n\n501\n00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:49,330\nRather than me walking up to you and\nasking you for your username and password.\n\n502\n00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:49,890\nWho the heck are you?\n\n503\n00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,070\nBut I can send an e-mail and forge those\nheader fields or something like that.\n\n504\n00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:59,030\nDo some name dropping, and it might get\nmore people to actually fall for that.\n\n505\n00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,430\nSo it gives me a little bit of anonymity.\n\n506\n00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,780\n>> Yeah, that would be a big part of it.\n\n507\n00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,200\nAnd I'm glad you mentioned headers,\n\n508\n00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,560\nbecause that's something\nwe're going to look at here.\n\n509\n00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,400\nBut think about it, you've been around\nthe IT field quite a long time,\n\n510\n00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,410\nI've been around quite a long time.\n\n511\n00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,640\nOur audience,\nthey've been around there a long time.\n\n512\n00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,830\nAnd people think actually know an email\nheaders there and can read it.\n\n513\n00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,900\n>> Header, what's a header?\n\n514\n00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,530\nYeah.\n\n515\n00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:33,140\n>> They taught a number of us\nhow to do that at one point,\n\n516\n00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:38,050\nbut not really a skill that\nyou see all that much.\n\n517\n00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,400\nPeople think a header nowadays\na lot of people, I kid you not,\n\n518\n00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,320\nthink it's when you reply to a mail and\nit has here is all the CC list and\n\n519\n00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,460\nall that in there and\nthey have it in the body of the email.\n\n520\n00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,720\nThey think that's it.\n\n521\n00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,640\nIt's clearly not.\n\n522\n00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,200\nThere's the header of the email.\n\n523\n00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,880\nIt is typically not displayed\nunless you go look for it.\n\n524\n00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,090\nEmail administrators know how to do it.\n\n525\n00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,380\nAnybody here in our audience\nthat has done exchange\n\n526\n00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,600\nhas undoubtedly done that at some pint.\n\n527\n00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,280\nIf you've been doing exchange for\n\n528\n00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,600\na while there's no reason why\nyou haven't had to do that.\n\n529\n00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,312\nBut most people turn that feature off and\nthey don't need to have it on really.\n\n530\n00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:21,590\n>> We're gonna talk much more about what\na header is and what's included in there,\n\n531\n00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,700\nbut a lot of these, the new applications,\nall of our new email apps hide that.\n\n532\n00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,620\nWay back in the day,\nthat stuff was displayed right there at\n\n533\n00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,340\nthe top of the email, but now with these\nnew modern clients, you've got to go find\n\n534\n00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,680\na check-mark to turn that on to see\nthose headers because they just hide it.\n\n535\n00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,290\nFor the average Joe,\n\n536\n00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,970\nthere's really no reason to see a lot\nof that information so it's hidden.\n\n537\n00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,360\n>> Right.\n>> And they don't see it at all.\n\n538\n00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,140\nNow, people just don't\neven know it's there.\n\n539\n00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,410\n>> That's the thing getting towards,\nsay, to how this works,\n\n540\n00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:53,860\nbut things like identity theft and\nstuff like that, as you were saying,\n\n541\n00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,850\nspoofing the header,\nyou can definitely do that, and\n\n542\n00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,000\nthat's\n>> More towards the more tech savvy user.\n\n543\n00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,930\nThe average Joe,\nyou don't even have to go that far.\n\n544\n00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,820\nAll you have to do is just\ngo into your email client,\n\n545\n00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,490\nchange that reply to line in it, and\nno one's gonna check anything else.\n\n546\n00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,590\nThey don't need to know\nanything about the header.\n\n547\n00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:20,008\nThey don't know anything about it,\nand you don't need to change it.\n\n548\n00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:23,770\nThere just gonna see, oh I remember\nthat person or that looks familiar.\n\n549\n00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:28,360\nIf you look on some of the things\nyou've got you may see that\n\n550\n00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,250\nit's got one name here, I've seen cases\nwhere I've seen a friends name here and\n\n551\n00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,280\nI look over and I notice that the friends\nemail address, it's entirely different.\n\n552\n00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,970\nSomeone's changed that display line and\nput a different email in there, so\n\n553\n00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,040\nI will be fooled into thinking\nthat that's my friend, but\n\n554\n00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,630\nmeanwhile given it's someone else.\n\n555\n00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,840\nThere's a social engineering aspect there.\n\n556\n00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,210\nAnd leveraging the fact that people\ndon't know his whole details.\n\n557\n00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,280\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n558\n00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,960\nLadies and gentlemen, looking at the clock\nit's time for us to take a break, so\n\n559\n00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,760\nwe're going to step away.\n\n560\n00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,964\nWhen we come back,\nmore about e-mails, so stay tuned.\n\n561\n00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:03,777\nWe'll be right back.\n\n562\n00:31:03,777 --> 00:31:07,435\n[SOUND]\n>> All right,\n\n563\n00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:09,150\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n564\n00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,420\nSo continuing on with our email discussion\nhere, investigating email crimes,\n\n565\n00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,600\nnext thing, Shawn, I think we want to\ngo into is just dissecting an email.\n\n566\n00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,730\nBreaking it down to its different parts.\n\n567\n00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:23,140\n>> Yes, an email is not just what we see.\n\n568\n00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,420\nThere's actually more to it than that.\n\n569\n00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,640\nWe have the body, the signature,\n\n570\n00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,660\nthose are the ones that we do\nrecognize and we see those.\n\n571\n00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,720\nOf course the body, I mean.\n\n572\n00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,060\nThat's where you're\nputting all your stuff.\n\n573\n00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,870\n>> That's the actual message\nthat you're sending.\n\n574\n00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,979\n>> Yeah, and then you've got a signature,\n\n575\n00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:43,460\nwhich is whatever you\nwanna sign stuff off with.\n\n576\n00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,518\nThe bottom of the email,\nall that type of stuff,\n\n577\n00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:49,659\nthe footer if you wanna\nthrow it in that category.\n\n578\n00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:54,350\nBut then there's another part\nto it Which is the header.\n\n579\n00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,066\nWhich is what we were just talking about.\n\n580\n00:31:57,066 --> 00:32:03,110\nThe header is going to be part of\nthe email which is typically not shown.\n\n581\n00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,300\nIt's something that you have\nto want to see now days.\n\n582\n00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:11,500\nThey have to make that conscious\ndecision to go and turn it on to see it.\n\n583\n00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,360\nSo what I have done to just kinda\ngive you a quick preview of it.\n\n584\n00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:22,340\nWe're gonna run through some tools\nthat helps it make it easier for you.\n\n585\n00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,060\nTo analyze a header.\n\n586\n00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,470\nCuz I know that's not a skill\nthat everyone has now a days.\n\n587\n00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,760\nAnd if you don't do it all\nthe time you're kind of fuzzy.\n\n588\n00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,902\nSo I can be a little\nbit fuzzy on it myself.\n\n589\n00:32:31,902 --> 00:32:37,910\nS o I'll show you some tools that\nyou can use to help you out.\n\n590\n00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:41,930\nLike I said, it's a skill that if you\ndon't use enough, it gets kind of rusty,\n\n591\n00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,160\nI shouldn't say fuzzy but rusty on it.\n\n592\n00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,310\n>> There you go.\n>> Just a little bit.\n\n593\n00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,360\nSo, but anyway, what I've got\njust to give you a quick preview,\n\n594\n00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,690\nwhat I've got up here on my screen,\nthis is in Email header.\n\n595\n00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,920\nAnd you can see it's got a good\namount of information into it.\n\n596\n00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,080\nSome of the stuff is optional.\n\n597\n00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,730\nSome of the stuff is mandatory.\n\n598\n00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,870\nBut you can look at it.\n\n599\n00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,240\nYou can see things like my Gmail\n\n600\n00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,920\naccount is there right up top\nsaying who it was delivered to.\n\n601\n00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,890\nBut if you look through that,\nyou can see who it came from.\n\n602\n00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,660\nYou can see a Yahoo account\nthat this came from.\n\n603\n00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,728\nThis is actually spam email\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n604\n00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:19,630\n>> Showing in the break.\n\n605\n00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:25,420\nProbably the worst crafted spam\nemails I've ever seen, but\n\n606\n00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:31,400\nin any case, you can see in here that\nit came from an address at Yahoo.\n\n607\n00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,160\nYou can see some IP addresses in there,\nso you can get quite a bit and\n\n608\n00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:42,200\nif you scroll down on it this\nactually had a picture in it.\n\n609\n00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,280\nSo you can see oh well, it looks like\nit was sent with an Apple email client.\n\n610\n00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,650\nOn the email itself it said\nit was sent from an iPhone,\n\n611\n00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,080\nso this stuff we are seeing down here.\n\n612\n00:33:53,080 --> 00:34:00,570\nAll this content towards the bottom, that\nactually is what would be the attachment.\n\n613\n00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,140\nGmail stuck this in\nthe body of the email and\n\n614\n00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:10,010\ndisplayed it but\nthis is actually an attachment.\n\n615\n00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,040\nSo, this is the coding of the JPG.\n\n616\n00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,140\nAnd then if I keep scrolling down you'll\nsee more and more and more of this and\n\n617\n00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:22,890\nthen you'll see the closing\npart of the actual message.\n\n618\n00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,500\n>> Yeah, and if we go back up to the top.\n\n619\n00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,890\nI don't know, can you do like\na Ctrl scroll and zoom in for\n\n620\n00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:29,570\nthem a little bit on there?\n\n621\n00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,633\nCan you zoom your browser in a little bit?\n\n622\n00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:33,491\n>> Hold on, let's see if I can do that.\n\n623\n00:34:33,491 --> 00:34:36,546\n>> Or change the-\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\n\n624\n00:34:36,546 --> 00:34:38,752\nI don't even do this all the time.\n\n625\n00:34:38,752 --> 00:34:41,560\nWhat's the zoom, or\nthere it is, right up top.\n\n626\n00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,680\n>> There we go.\n\n627\n00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,490\nSo that gives you guys a good at all\nthe information that's included in that\n\n628\n00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,990\nheader, and as an investigator,\nthis is what we need to look at.\n\n629\n00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:56,000\nWe don't wanna look at those to and from\nfields that you see in your email client,\n\n630\n00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,330\nbecause that's just fluff, really.\n\n631\n00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:02,140\nThat can be changed to anything\nI want when I send that email.\n\n632\n00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:07,230\nThis stuff here is the actual information\nthat is being used to route that email\n\n633\n00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,550\nfrom one email server to another.\n\n634\n00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,250\nSo, this is the good stuff.\n\n635\n00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,600\nAs an investigator,\nthis is what I need to see, right?\n\n636\n00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,790\n>> Yeah.\nYou can't just go off of what's\n\n637\n00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,620\nin the line of reply to, and all that.\n\n638\n00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,570\nI mean the average Joe is going to go for\nit and that's going to catch most of them.\n\n639\n00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,910\nBut if you trust that and\n\n640\n00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,770\nsay oh it absolutely came from\nthat address, it doesn't have to.\n\n641\n00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,660\nI can put something in the reply to field\nin there and I can do all sorts of scams\n\n642\n00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,400\nthere to mess with that, but then in here\nwill be where things actually came from.\n\n643\n00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,230\nI will see IP addresses,\nI will see domain.\n\n644\n00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:50,960\nI will see all those little hidden\ndetails, or typically hidden details,\n\n645\n00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,590\nthat now once I have those IP addresses,\nthose mail servers.\n\n646\n00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:58,390\nNow I can start seeing where those are and\nhow it got to me and\n\n647\n00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,260\nwhere it ultimately came from.\n\n648\n00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,170\nI can look at all those little\ndetails that you just can't\n\n649\n00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:09,190\ntrust in the other side of the house,\njust by looking at the message itself.\n\n650\n00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,390\n>> And we've got some really good\ncomments out there in the chat room,\n\n651\n00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,460\nsomething that we were\nalluding to earlier.\n\n652\n00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,300\nA lot of these clients hide that header\ninformation, and it can be very difficult.\n\n653\n00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,370\nI was just looking through- I'm running at\neight one- and I'm on their built in mail\n\n654\n00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:25,030\nclient, and I have yet\nto find the option to turn on headers.\n\n655\n00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,160\nSo you've got, I know someone\nin the chatroom was mentioning\n\n656\n00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,420\nfinding that option in Outlook 2013.\n\n657\n00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,280\nIt can be challenging to be able to\nsee this info in these different email\n\n658\n00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,550\nclients, because they do, they hide it.\n\n659\n00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,330\nAnd they another good comment\nout there I think David again,\n\n660\n00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,250\nwe've got both of our\nDavid's are timing in here.\n\n661\n00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,250\nSometimes they can put false\ninformation in the header.\n\n662\n00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:49,010\nIt's not like I'm saying take this\nto heart or trust it completely.\n\n663\n00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,220\nBut it's definitely going to be, well,\n\n664\n00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,830\nsome of the information has\nto be real in the header.\n\n665\n00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,340\nBecause that's what's being\nused to deliver that mail from\n\n666\n00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,440\none server to another.\n\n667\n00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,300\nBut as they pointed out in the chat room,\n\n668\n00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,800\nwe can inject bad information in here,\ntoo.\n\n669\n00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,810\nAs a forensic investigator we've\ngot to be aware of that, and\n\n670\n00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,530\nwe're not gonna just accept it\nblindly as being 100% accurate.\n\n671\n00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,750\n>> Yeah, don't ever do that.\n\n672\n00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:14,780\nIf it's that line from one of\nmy favorite shows, the X-Files.\n\n673\n00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,520\nThey say trust no one.\n\n674\n00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,640\nYeah, no,\ndon't trust to take it at face value.\n\n675\n00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,710\nDig beneath the surface and\nit's good to hear.\n\n676\n00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,020\nIt's kind of like a support group\nsometimes, when you do stuff like this.\n\n677\n00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,860\nI hear you talking and people in chat room\ntalking about how difficult it was to\n\n678\n00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,910\nfind the header information.\n\n679\n00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,660\nIf one of the times I, or and\nthe new staff went to go look for it,\n\n680\n00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,230\nthe first time we looked for\n\n681\n00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:46,366\nit I'm all like, I must be getting too\nold for this business or something.\n\n682\n00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:48,826\n[LAUGH] And I'm not even that old and\nI'm thinking that.\n\n683\n00:37:48,826 --> 00:37:49,970\n[LAUGH] I'm getting too old for\n\n684\n00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:55,360\nthis I can't find this header stuff, well\nit should be easy why am I missing it?\n\n685\n00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,660\nIt's because it seems like\nthey've done everything they\n\n686\n00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,270\ncan to just say don't look at that.\n\n687\n00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,520\nCan I see a.\n\n688\n00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,030\nNo, we don't know what this is,\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n689\n00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,100\nAnd don't look ban the curtain,\nit's that type of stuff.\n\n690\n00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:16,800\nIn Google, in Gmail, they will say,\nit doesn't even directly show\n\n691\n00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,260\nmessage headers, it says,\nshow original message.\n\n692\n00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,490\nTo me, that's kind of just,\nthat's not the right way to word it,\n\n693\n00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:29,680\nit's like,\naren't I looking at the original message?\n\n694\n00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,650\nIt's like, no it means, show the header,\nthis is the result of showing the stuff\n\n695\n00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:39,150\nI had on screen was actually the result\nof doing a show the original message.\n\n696\n00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,676\nThere on screen is your original\nmessage in all its glory.\n\n697\n00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:43,880\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n698\n00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,600\n>> And\nopening it up in a browser like that,\n\n699\n00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:52,020\nI've had times where I've just copied the\nemail out and pasted it into a text editor\n\n700\n00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,910\nto try to see some of that information\nsometimes, you can get at it that way.\n\n701\n00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,120\nOr save the email and then open that\nup with a different program other than\n\n702\n00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,090\nyour mail client, to try to get\naccess to that header information.\n\n703\n00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,530\n>> True, absolutely.\n\n704\n00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:08,550\nI mean heck, there's some sniffers that\nwill specifically grab email trafficking.\n\n705\n00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:12,780\nSet filters on them and\nit will show that right from the get go.\n\n706\n00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,860\nSo you've got tools to help you out, but\n\n707\n00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,200\nyeah, the mail clients don't by any\nway shape or form make this easy.\n\n708\n00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,215\nAnd this one loads and\n\n709\n00:39:22,215 --> 00:39:25,775\nI look at this header and\nthis looks like it's pretty much, and\n\n710\n00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:28,765\nI'm not seriously scrutinizing this, but-\n>> Yeah.\n\n711\n00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:32,545\n>> Looks like this header information\nis all, from just a cursory look,\n\n712\n00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:34,930\nlooks all true and correct.\n\n713\n00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:40,150\nSo, it goes back towards the thing\nthat this was a really lazy spammer.\n\n714\n00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,014\nThey didn't change nothing.\n\n715\n00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:44,429\nThey were just, go for it.\n\n716\n00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:50,257\nThey plucked this email from someplace or\nwhat have you and Send it to me.\n\n717\n00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:51,656\n>> As an investigator,\n\n718\n00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:56,880\nwhat kind of information am I hoping\nto gain out of reading these headers?\n\n719\n00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,189\nAre we really talking about\npossibly where it came from,\n\n720\n00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,883\nwhat storage [CROSSTALK] was bounced off.\n\n721\n00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:01,789\n>> Right.\n\n722\n00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:06,215\nTrying to trace that email back to\nthe target of our investigation.\n\n723\n00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:09,065\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n724\n00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:11,905\n>> All right, so we've got the different\nparts of an email, we talked about\n\n725\n00:40:11,905 --> 00:40:15,342\nthe header, we know what the body is,\nwe know what a signature is on an email.\n\n726\n00:40:15,342 --> 00:40:18,732\nThe header being the really juicy part,\nright,\n\n727\n00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:22,102\nthe part that has the stuff that\nwe really want to dive into.\n\n728\n00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:25,812\nDon't get me wrong, the body's important\ntoo, cuz it could be a part of the crime,\n\n729\n00:40:25,812 --> 00:40:30,150\nwhat they were sending, could be\nharassing email, or something like that,\n\n730\n00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,280\nor inappropriate pictures or\nwhat have you.\n\n731\n00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,270\nBut the header gives us a lot\nof the information that we need\n\n732\n00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,180\nas an investigator to be able to trace\nthat back to the original sender.\n\n733\n00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,250\nAll right, and then the next thing I\nwant to talk about is record management.\n\n734\n00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,010\nThings like e-discovery.\n\n735\n00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:50,290\n>> Yes, that's something as a, Forensic\ninvestigator you need to keep in mind\n\n736\n00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,330\nis that when you're investigating emails,\ndepending on who and\n\n737\n00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,580\nwhat you're investigating, there's gonna\nbe some sort of records management system.\n\n738\n00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:03,130\nEspecially in any sort of regulated\nindustry, there's gonna be something.\n\n739\n00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,940\nYou talk about HIPAA, financial.\n\n740\n00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,740\nYou talk about large companies,\nthe companies\n\n741\n00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,720\nthat are getting to\nthe multi-million dollar range,\n\n742\n00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,100\nhere in the states mult-million\nmulti-billion dollar ones.\n\n743\n00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,250\nThey will have the executives and\nsome of the key personnel.\n\n744\n00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,940\nWill have all of their\nstuff stored some place.\n\n745\n00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,900\nIt's just kept on file.\n\n746\n00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,850\nNow days we have even gotten more\ncomplex where not only will it look for\n\n747\n00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,650\ncertain personnel it will look for\ncertain keywords.\n\n748\n00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,660\nAnd if they see certain\nkeywords go across and\n\n749\n00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,460\nemail, it will automatically get archived.\n\n750\n00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,040\nSo, they'll have something like\nworking with Exchange that says, okay,\n\n751\n00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,260\nwell, save these things.\n\n752\n00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:53,130\nThat could be just as a course\nof business or regulation.\n\n753\n00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:57,140\nAnd it doesn't necessarily mean that when\nthey're doing a records management and\n\n754\n00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,200\nanything bad has happened.\n\n755\n00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,280\nIt just means that they're doing\nit because they have to or\n\n756\n00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,670\nthey think it's smart thing to do.\n\n757\n00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,135\nI've seen for example they will do even,\n\n758\n00:42:08,135 --> 00:42:13,835\nheightened levels of records-management\ntemporarily when companies merge.\n\n759\n00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:17,975\nI was with a company that\nmerged with another one and\n\n760\n00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:22,370\nthe Federal Trade Commission here in\nthe States, they want to make sure that,\n\n761\n00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:27,870\nwhen the company I was with bought another\none and absorbed it, they wanted to make\n\n762\n00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:32,880\nsure it wasn't a problem to competition\nin the business space or anything.\n\n763\n00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,720\nSo, as part of that investigation,\nthey said,\n\n764\n00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:43,400\nyou gotta save emails just in case and\nback then it was a lot,\n\n765\n00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,420\nmore messy because they told\neveryone don't delete any emails.\n\n766\n00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,590\nCan you imagine not saying don't tell\nanyone for a month until further notice,\n\n767\n00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,040\ndon't delete any email messages, they said\nthat we need to keep records of stuff.\n\n768\n00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,070\nIt would be like my girlfriend sent\nme an email, they were saying,\n\n769\n00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,620\nyeah, that needs to be kept, too.\n\n770\n00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,890\nNo relevance whatsoever.\n\n771\n00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,560\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n772\n00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,470\nI was the bottom man of the totem pole,\nor maybe not the guy, but close.\n\n773\n00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,280\nI could see it from there.\n\n774\n00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,960\nAnd I didn't know anything.\n\n775\n00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,340\nThere was stuff going on at that level,\nall the deals and all that.\n\n776\n00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,880\nIt had to kept, nowadays,\nthey're a lot more selective with it.\n\n777\n00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,260\nThey do use the term that Guido\nput in there, legal holes as well.\n\n778\n00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,000\n>> It's a lot like in\nour criminal cases or\n\n779\n00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,110\nduring an investigation, and the lawyers,\nthe prosecutors and the defense attorneys,\n\n780\n00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,520\nthey go through the discovery phase\nwhere they're finding information,\n\n781\n00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,300\nthey have to make it\navailable to the other side,\n\n782\n00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,360\nand this basically the same thing for\nelectronic documents.\n\n783\n00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,360\nWe've gotta discover all of\nthe information that's out there.\n\n784\n00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,660\nSome of that's gonna be relevant\nto the case, some of it's not.\n\n785\n00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,430\nBut what the e-discovery does is says\nlook, the Es are gonna be apart of\n\n786\n00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,220\nthe investigation, we'll determine\nwhether they are irrelevant or not, but\n\n787\n00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,770\nin the mean time, you can't change them,\nyou can't delete them, you can't modify.\n\n788\n00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:01,870\nNothing can happen to these,\nit's like you said, a legal hold or\n\n789\n00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,120\na freeze on this electronic information.\n\n790\n00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,730\n>> Yeah they will.\n\n791\n00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:10,390\nIt goes up and above the normal archiving\nthat something like Exchange does.\n\n792\n00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,180\nExchange does have things that if you,\n\n793\n00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,530\nit does have mechanisms in it\nthat if you delete something.\n\n794\n00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:19,510\nIt gets deleted out of the user's inbox,\nbut\n\n795\n00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:22,840\nit's still sitting out there\nin server land someplace.\n\n796\n00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:29,090\nSo, it's still there, but it's not the\nsame as a legal hold or doing e-discovery.\n\n797\n00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,800\nThose are purely done for\nregulations and investigative purposes.\n\n798\n00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,538\nIf they're doing e-discovery, they are,\ngoing through, all these records,\n\n799\n00:44:38,538 --> 00:44:40,120\nlooking for, things.\n\n800\n00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,590\nThey could very well be going through\nthat whole archive that you built up,\n\n801\n00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,010\nlooking for, whatever.\n\n802\n00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,720\nAnd-\n>> And these middle service providers,\n\n803\n00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,480\npart of their normal business operation\nmight be to archive stuff for\n\n804\n00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,230\na certain period of time, and\nthen after that period of time,\n\n805\n00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,600\nthose archives get bumped out, or deleted,\nor what have you, making room for more.\n\n806\n00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,200\nNow that might be a normal process for\n\n807\n00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,790\nthem, and what this is saying,\nyou can't do that.\n\n808\n00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:08,680\nThat could be evidence that we might need,\nso we're gonna tell you we might have to\n\n809\n00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,540\nhold that, can't get rid of it, can't do\nanything with it, so make sure that stuff\n\n810\n00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,890\ndoesn't disappear on us, make sure that\nevidence is available when we need it.\n\n811\n00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:20,080\n>> Yeah, it's a very very big deal.\n\n812\n00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,940\nAnd you especially, I can talk to\nthe stuff here in the states, in light\n\n813\n00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,010\nof some the things that happened over\nthe last 15-20 years where you had these.\n\n814\n00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:36,780\nIf you're not here in the states and you\nlook up stuff, Enron, the energy trader.\n\n815\n00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,200\nYou look at WorldCom when it blew up.\n\n816\n00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,050\nAnd they weren't the only two.\n\n817\n00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:45,960\nThey were just some of the biggest ones\nwe had, and the biggest scandals we had.\n\n818\n00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,960\nAnd there, a lot of things changed.\n\n819\n00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,480\nAnd they had to get these\nsystems a lot more complex.\n\n820\n00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,270\nThey had, to be more targeting\nin how they did things,\n\n821\n00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:02,090\nso that's why you saw at some point,\nMicrosoft, for example did an Exchange.\n\n822\n00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:05,780\nThey started to do an integration\nwith share point, you could do that.\n\n823\n00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,330\nAnd they've since changed that a bit.\n\n824\n00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:12,050\nBut then there's even add ons\nto the exchange mail server.\n\n825\n00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:17,310\nThere's ones that are specifically for\nthose situations,\n\n826\n00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:22,025\nand then you start going into the legal\nrequirements, for like we said, HIPAA and\n\n827\n00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:27,210\nSarbanes-Oxley or whatever it happens to\nbe in your particular zip code or country.\n\n828\n00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,320\nThose also, get built on.\n\n829\n00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:35,290\nThen there are even ones that lawyers\ninternally will do cuz there's stuff for\n\n830\n00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,470\nHR that HR is gonna wanna do.\n\n831\n00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:41,830\nJust as a matter of due course,\njust to make sure they've got that,\n\n832\n00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:45,750\ntheir butt's covered in the event\nthat something bad happens.\n\n833\n00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,900\nWho knows how long those archives\nneed to be kept for, as well.\n\n834\n00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,229\n>> Right.\n>> That's a whole another,\n\n835\n00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,430\nyou might have to tell someone or\n\n836\n00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:57,840\nyou may be told, how long do I\nneed to keep this message around.\n\n837\n00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,430\nAnd they say, until we tell you otherwise.\n\n838\n00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:03,840\nThey put a hold on it, until we tell\nyou otherwise, you're keeping it.\n\n839\n00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:09,580\nAnd that's it, and then Chris brings\nup something even on top of that.\n\n840\n00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:14,475\nThe cloud, yeah, that's a whole\nanother a shooting match there\n\n841\n00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:19,192\nbecause you've got one of the big\nproblems of the cloud to kinda\n\n842\n00:47:19,192 --> 00:47:24,087\ntalk to that issue, because it is\na real issue that we encounter,\n\n843\n00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:27,482\nis when you put stuff in\nthe cloud you have to.\n\n844\n00:47:27,482 --> 00:47:32,614\nTell those people that are managing your\ncloud service of these requirements,\n\n845\n00:47:32,614 --> 00:47:37,660\nbecause they don't, do those things\nas a matter of normal operating.\n\n846\n00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:42,179\nIf you say you want them to host\nan Exchange, or host whatever mail server,\n\n847\n00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:46,224\nwell whatever service,\nthose services are typically a la carte.\n\n848\n00:47:46,224 --> 00:47:48,943\nThey've got everything laid out there and\n\n849\n00:47:48,943 --> 00:47:53,863\nyou just choose off the menu what you\nwant and you put your solution together.\n\n850\n00:47:53,863 --> 00:47:54,723\nAnd that's it.\n\n851\n00:47:54,723 --> 00:47:59,476\nIf you don't ask for it,\nthey may not offer it, in which case,\n\n852\n00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:03,082\nif you were hosting your\nstuff out on the cloud.\n\n853\n00:48:03,082 --> 00:48:08,650\nAnd you had a requirement to do archiving\nand holding these things, you could be in\n\n854\n00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:14,430\na lot of hot water when they come and\nask for it.\n\n855\n00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:19,080\nIt's a whole heck of a lot of hot water.\n\n856\n00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:24,170\nThey could call in the agency,\ntheir own forensic people\n\n857\n00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:29,110\nif you are just,\nfull of BS to put it bluntly.\n\n858\n00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:33,910\nOr they could do a whole other\nround of audits to find out where,\n\n859\n00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,230\nwhy weren't you getting the message?\n\n860\n00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:41,110\nIf this was required of you,\nwhy didn't you do this?\n\n861\n00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,860\nWhere was the failure in the chain, and\n\n862\n00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:48,280\nthat could open up all sorts of cans of\nworms and fines, and everything else.\n\n863\n00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,970\nHeck, the small things can get\nyou some tremendous fines.\n\n864\n00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:56,620\nI've seen fines for stuff that was\njust a missing piece of paperwork.\n\n865\n00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,110\nI mean you've got something that's\nmissing just a single piece of paperwork,\n\n866\n00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,730\na $100,000.\n\n867\n00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:06,630\nI've seen that, I've seen $1 million\nfines for you're missing a couple\n\n868\n00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:12,060\npages in here and cough it up,\nthey will do that.\n\n869\n00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,400\nAnd it's not just here in the US,\nit's in other places.\n\n870\n00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,740\nI saw that happen, the paperwork missing\nthing, I remember that happening when I\n\n871\n00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:25,020\nwas at Northrup, or\nNorthrup Grumman now, in the early 90s.\n\n872\n00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,580\nThey had that situation where one of\nthe contracts they were working on.\n\n873\n00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:33,230\nThey missed a couple pieces of paper.\n\n874\n00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,060\nAnd there was an audit\ndone on the contract.\n\n875\n00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,800\nAnd the contract holder,\nit was the military.\n\n876\n00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,060\nWe won't even worry about which branch.\n\n877\n00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,980\nBut they came in,\naudited the whole thing, and\n\n878\n00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:48,550\nsaid where's these couple forms in there?\n\n879\n00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:53,130\nAnd they were looking, everyone was\nlooking for it and they realized that,\n\n880\n00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:58,200\nsomeone didn't do that, or\ndo what they were supposed to.\n\n881\n00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,500\nAnd, yeah, they said open your checkbooks,\n\n882\n00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,880\nwe're taking a $ 1 million out\nof your pockets right now.\n\n883\n00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,530\nThat was it.\n\n884\n00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:06,190\n>> Yeah.\n\n885\n00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:08,700\nI am going to need those\nTPS reports [LAUGH].\n\n886\n00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,570\nIf you don't have a cover sheet, sorry,\n\n887\n00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:14,040\nwe are going to have to\n[INAUDIBLE] this weekend.\n\n888\n00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,360\n>> That is those doubles and\nthose details.\n\n889\n00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,290\nYou got to have those things.\n\n890\n00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,910\nRemember as a forensic tech,\nwhen you are looking at all this.\n\n891\n00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:29,490\nThose things in a lot of cases should be\nthere, you should just be able to ask and\n\n892\n00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:33,080\nemail administrator and\nthe legal department.\n\n893\n00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,650\nIt's not up to the email\nadministrator only to say,\n\n894\n00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:38,300\nhey this is where the archives\nare being held or for\n\n895\n00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,410\nhow long, there's an IT side of this and\nthen there's a legal side of it.\n\n896\n00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,660\nWe're clearly on the legal side of things,\n\n897\n00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,780\nwe are no longer on the IT\nside talking about that.\n\n898\n00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:53,730\nSo the IT department doesn't get to\ndictate how long that's held for.\n\n899\n00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,530\nWhat the disposition of it is.\n\n900\n00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:59,800\nHow many times they can back this up,\nand what they are looking for.\n\n901\n00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,010\nYou don't get to decide that.\n\n902\n00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:06,830\nThey have a legal department telling\nthem this is what you have to archive.\n\n903\n00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,580\nAnd for whom, and what conditions.\n\n904\n00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:12,890\nThey are going to set that criteria up and\nabove in addition to whatever.\n\n905\n00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:16,810\nThe normal IT functioning has to have for\ntheir messaging system.\n\n906\n00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:20,280\nSo you are gonna be working with legal\nsaying I need to get this stuff.\n\n907\n00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,160\nAnd don't forget you could\nbe talking subpoenas and\n\n908\n00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,940\nstuff like that at this point too.\n\n909\n00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,690\nYou could be talking search warrants and\nall that as well.\n\n910\n00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,720\nTo get access to these things.\n\n911\n00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,560\nOr it just could be a case\nwhere it's a merger.\n\n912\n00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:37,080\nWhen I talk about, where it's a business\nmerger like the FTC or FDIC for\n\n913\n00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,580\nbanking requires some of those things.\n\n914\n00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,390\nIt can be any of those.\n\n915\n00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,930\nIf you're doing stuff for\na public agency just count on.\n\n916\n00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,580\nThat there's some sort of regulation.\n\n917\n00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,440\nIf you're working on something else,\nthen it could be there too.\n\n918\n00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,180\nThere's certain places\nit's gonna exist and\n\n919\n00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:56,990\nthen some of these businesses just do\nit because it's the smart thing to do.\n\n920\n00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:59,920\nKeep archives of your email,\nyou never know,\n\n921\n00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,920\nand so\nit's going to come back to bite you.\n\n922\n00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,450\nAnd really everyone can kind of engage in\nthat now, especially with cloud services.\n\n923\n00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:12,180\nIf you don't want to host your\nown mail server and all that.\n\n924\n00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:17,100\nYou can just post it in the cloud to\nask them to archive it and pay for\n\n925\n00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:17,790\nthat service.\n\n926\n00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,170\nAnd make sure it's getting done.\n\n927\n00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:24,440\nSo if you're a small mom and\npop business, you have the records there.\n\n928\n00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,456\nSo you don't get caught out of position or\nsomething.\n\n929\n00:52:27,456 --> 00:52:30,589\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then be sued or fined, or both, or\n\n930\n00:52:30,589 --> 00:52:32,250\nmore, or whatever.\n\n931\n00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,010\nDrawn and quartered, who knows.\n\n932\n00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,560\nYou never know what's\ngonna happen with that.\n\n933\n00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,902\nBut that's what e-discovery is.\n\n934\n00:52:38,902 --> 00:52:41,230\nThat's what the legal hold,\nthat was a great term for\n\n935\n00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,180\nit to be brought up in here.\n\n936\n00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,965\nGuido, thanks for that.\n\n937\n00:52:44,965 --> 00:52:47,910\nAnd then there's other things\nthat fit in it too, but\n\n938\n00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,390\nyou're gonna have to go\nthrough these archives.\n\n939\n00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:54,630\nThere's tools for that too, so\ndon't be too worried about it.\n\n940\n00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:59,210\n>> One at a time, gotta open those emails,\nread each one of them.\n\n941\n00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:02,450\n>> Someone's not going to hand you\na virtual phone book of stuff and\n\n942\n00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:04,800\nyou have to go through it\nwith a magnifying glass.\n\n943\n00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,500\nNo, you don't have to do that.\n\n944\n00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,180\nThere's plenty of tools that will\nhelp you out in this process.\n\n945\n00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:15,290\nWe're going to talk about that and how to\nactually look at stuff on the mail server,\n\n946\n00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,460\nas well as the stuff that may\nreside on a client system.\n\n947\n00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,230\nBecause there may be stuff\nin the client system\n\n948\n00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,710\nthat just doesn't exist the same way.\n\n949\n00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:27,830\nOr is a little incriminating and\nwe need that too to kind of verify.\n\n950\n00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:33,650\nThere's a whole bunch of reasons you\nmight go on to the client device itself.\n\n951\n00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:36,400\nAnd that can definitely be\npart of a legal hold, and\n\n952\n00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,890\nhopefully you are not dealing with\ntoo old of an email system that\n\n953\n00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:46,630\nhas issues stored on the server and\non the client.\n\n954\n00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:50,250\nThe one where I had to deal with it,\nwhen they had that merger.\n\n955\n00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,150\nCC mail.\nRemember that?\n\n956\n00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:54,000\nThat disaster.\n\n957\n00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,210\nWe had to do it with that one.\n\n958\n00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,738\nSome of our audience is\ngetting flash backs right now.\n\n959\n00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:01,932\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or nightmares.\n\n960\n00:54:01,932 --> 00:54:05,590\nAll right ladies and gentlemen,\nlooking at the clock, it's about time for\n\n961\n00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:06,770\nus to take one of those breaks.\n\n962\n00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:10,890\nWe are going to step away and\nwhen we come back we are going to dive\n\n963\n00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:15,180\ninto how we start our investigation when\nit comes to emails things we look for\n\n964\n00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,120\nprocesses as we go through.\n\n965\n00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:22,204\nStay tuned, we will be right back.\n\n966\n00:54:22,204 --> 00:54:28,213\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentleman.\n\n967\n00:54:28,213 --> 00:54:33,105\nAs we left off, getting ready to talk\nabout some of the steps that we would take\n\n968\n00:54:33,105 --> 00:54:36,030\nif an email was part of our investigation.\n\n969\n00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,740\nSo, where do we start Sean?\n\n970\n00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:44,590\n>> Well, we should start by explaining\nthat yes, just like other places we have\n\n971\n00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:51,230\nbeen through with the forensic process, we\nhave talked about it somewhat generically.\n\n972\n00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:55,240\nWe've put the disclaimer in for that, but\n\n973\n00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:00,270\nthere is a process for investigating\nemail that you need to carefully follow.\n\n974\n00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:05,180\nIt does require that you have knowledge\nof how the email system works and\n\n975\n00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,280\nhow it ticks as well as\nthe legal procedures and\n\n976\n00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:12,100\nwhere's the little bits and\nclues might hide that you can pull up.\n\n977\n00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,530\nBecause remember you're\nworking against someone or\n\n978\n00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:19,100\ncould be working against someone that is\ntrying to, or may have tried to cover up.\n\n979\n00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:24,040\nTheir tracks, gotten rid of emails or\ntried to, altered headers or\n\n980\n00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,660\nany sort of thing.\n\n981\n00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,910\nYou're trying to fight against\nall of that, if you will,\n\n982\n00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,650\nand recover that information.\n\n983\n00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:38,383\nBefore lunch, we were talking about the\nfact that there's Tons of wait just for\n\n984\n00:55:38,383 --> 00:55:40,180\na header to forge that and\n\n985\n00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,303\nmake it looks like it comes\nfrom all these weird sources.\n\n986\n00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:46,625\nThat's only part of it.\n\n987\n00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:49,317\nThere's the deleting emails,\nwhere does it go?\n\n988\n00:55:49,317 --> 00:55:51,291\nThey do go some place, as we talked about.\n\n989\n00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:55,883\nYou know there's all this fraudulent\nthings that could happen through email,\n\n990\n00:55:55,883 --> 00:56:00,611\ndifferent forms of attacks, and different\nstrikes people can do, so the process\n\n991\n00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:05,160\nis geared to helping you get the best\nresults no matter what situation you are.\n\n992\n00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,960\nSo we gotta make sure\nwe're conscious of it, so\n\n993\n00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,700\nthat's what we're gonna go through here.\n\n994\n00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,150\n>> Right,\n>> So one of the first things we do,\n\n995\n00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,600\nlike any part of the investigation.\n\n996\n00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,450\nWe've got to make sure we have permission.\n\n997\n00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:20,940\nWhen I say permission, I mean legally,\nwhich is a warrant of some type, right?\n\n998\n00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:21,600\n>> Yeah.\n\n999\n00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:27,250\nBy now you're probably tired of\nhearing the term warrant you know,\n\n1000\n00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,770\nwe think, I think you got the idea.\n\n1001\n00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:32,230\nBut, it's a you know on a warrant is.\n\n1002\n00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:36,800\nBut of course in this situation\nwe may very well need\n\n1003\n00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,730\na warrant to do that search.\n\n1004\n00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:43,100\nNow if it's a corporate environment you\nkind of already know the spiel on that.\n\n1005\n00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:47,680\nThat, that might play into,\nyou might now need a search warrant.\n\n1006\n00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,580\nI say might because when you talk\nabout e-mail there is certain\n\n1007\n00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:56,720\nthings that come into play such as\na reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\n1008\n00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,270\nThat could very well apply\nin some of your cases.\n\n1009\n00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:04,450\nIf you're unsure,\nagain legal consultation comes in.\n\n1010\n00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:07,440\nBecause you don't want to mess that up.\n\n1011\n00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,630\nSo if there's any sort of\nprivileged communications or\n\n1012\n00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:18,700\nany personal stuff that might be in\nthere your going to have to be careful.\n\n1013\n00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:23,010\nEven if your in a cooperate environment,\nif you collect stuff that's private and\n\n1014\n00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:25,810\nthey do have that reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\n\n1015\n00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:29,540\nYou open up yourself to a lawsuit, and\nthose has been successful where people\n\n1016\n00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:34,430\nhave had their emails collected, or other\ninformation collected off their system,\n\n1017\n00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:39,100\nand it was proven that they have\na reasonable expectation of privacy,\n\n1018\n00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:43,340\nso they were able to get, maybe not\nget the initial thing overturned, but\n\n1019\n00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:50,780\nthey were able to go into maybe civil\ncourt and and file a lawsuit and win.\n\n1020\n00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,810\n>> Yeah.\n\n1021\n00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:56,410\n>> There was at least one case now in\nJersey, where someone got 2.4 million or\n\n1022\n00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:00,650\nsomething like that and\nit was just a crazy one, too.\n\n1023\n00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:01,310\n>> Seriously,\n\n1024\n00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:04,221\nsomebody want to take some of my emails so\nI can get 2.4 million dollars.\n\n1025\n00:58:04,221 --> 00:58:06,690\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Yeah, it was crazy.\n\n1026\n00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:15,040\nThere were a few things that came into\nplay here with that specific case was,\n\n1027\n00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,420\nthe individual looked like they were\ngetting ready to, they kind of want to get\n\n1028\n00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:25,660\nrid of him anyway, the guy had a It's kind\nof somewhat a record of doing stuff and\n\n1029\n00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:29,950\nthey were looking for that one thing,\njust to push them over.\n\n1030\n00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:34,910\nAnd so they did a search of a system and\na search of his email.\n\n1031\n00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:41,810\nAnd those things just were, he had\na reasonable explanation for privacy and\n\n1032\n00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:45,960\nso they found stuff in his email, but\nthey also found in this computer,\n\n1033\n00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:52,200\nthe thing that actually him fired,\nwas they found pornography on the system.\n\n1034\n00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,220\nAnd it was actually kind of funny,\nthe results on that.\n\n1035\n00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,910\nThey said, first of all, he had\na reasonable expectation of privacy for\n\n1036\n00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,520\nhis email and what was on his system.\n\n1037\n00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,460\nAnd then they also argued, they said that\nno one told him, I wish I could pull this,\n\n1038\n00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:09,720\nI tried pulling this excuse with\nmy parents, as a kid doesn't work.\n\n1039\n00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,160\nYou know, I got a whipping anyway.\n\n1040\n00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,910\nSo, cause this guy said, hey, you didn't\ntell me I couldn't download pornography.\n\n1041\n00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,600\n>> All right.\n>> He pulled that, it worked.\n\n1042\n00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,865\nYou know, Jedi mind trick.\n\n1043\n00:59:20,865 --> 00:59:22,485\nDidn't tell me I couldn't do it.\n\n1044\n00:59:22,485 --> 00:59:24,975\n>> A lot of times with corporate\nas we talked about earlier.\n\n1045\n00:59:24,975 --> 00:59:28,715\nThey might be in the beginning\nof the hiring process.\n\n1046\n00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:32,225\nAn acceptable use and\nthings like that, that are signed.\n\n1047\n00:59:32,225 --> 00:59:35,045\nBut, we also have to think about, what\nif you are in the health care industry.\n\n1048\n00:59:35,045 --> 00:59:36,775\nWhat if you are in a law industry.\n\n1049\n00:59:36,775 --> 00:59:40,605\nNot only do those e-mails contain\nthe person who is sending or\n\n1050\n00:59:40,605 --> 00:59:41,640\nreceiving the e-mail.\n\n1051\n00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:46,180\nThe content of the e-mail, it might be\nmy healthcare information, or my law,\n\n1052\n00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,870\nsome court case I might be going through,\nmy tax information,\n\n1053\n00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,980\nyou know without a warrant,\nshould be able to get stuff like that?\n\n1054\n00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,730\nSo that's why sometimes even\nin a corporate environment,\n\n1055\n00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,110\nwe might have to get that warrant.\n\n1056\n00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:01,330\n>> Yeah,\nbetter safe than sorry as the saying goes.\n\n1057\n01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:06,470\nSo, consider if you do need a search\nwarrant or not and if you do have,\n\n1058\n01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:11,500\nwell like you said, an acceptable use or\nyou have something that says they're\n\n1059\n01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,900\nwaving their right to it,\ncuz remember we talked about going,\n\n1060\n01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,890\ndoing, a first responder responsibilities,\none of the things we mentioned there was.\n\n1061\n01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:22,680\nPeople can waive their right\nto these sorts of things.\n\n1062\n01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,640\nIt's just like if the police\ncome to your house and\n\n1063\n01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,290\nthey want to search it,\nthere are choices they can get.\n\n1064\n01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:33,250\nOne of them being that\nthey can get a warrant, or\n\n1065\n01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:37,210\nthe other one being that you can\nsay come on in and search it.\n\n1066\n01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:40,880\nIf you say that,\nyou've given consent right there.\n\n1067\n01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,510\nSomeone could conceivably do that, too.\n\n1068\n01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:46,150\nAnd they could do that through\nsigning previous paperwork, or\n\n1069\n01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:50,460\nthey could do it right there at\nthe time that you come to them and say,\n\n1070\n01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,200\nif this is something you can\nget away with is going to them.\n\n1071\n01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,290\nMaybe the situation is too delicate\nthat you can't go to the individual and\n\n1072\n01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:00,600\nsay you want to do this, because they\nmight start tampering with stuff.\n\n1073\n01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,600\nSo you might just say well.\n\n1074\n01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,790\nBut if the situation kind\nof lends itself to that,\n\n1075\n01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:10,000\nyou could say well do you consent\nto have these things searched.\n\n1076\n01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,260\nIf they sign off or are okay with it,\nthen you can do it.\n\n1077\n01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:18,020\nBut be prepared that you may\nhave to do a search warrant.\n\n1078\n01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,580\nAnd if you're doing something\nin a criminal case and\n\n1079\n01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:26,270\nit's hosted by an ISP or another company\n\n1080\n01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:30,510\nthen there is other things that come\ninto play in addition to search warrant.\n\n1081\n01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:32,050\nSo do consider that,\n\n1082\n01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:37,070\nalso consider that fact that you might\nhave the other privacy concerns.\n\n1083\n01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:40,450\nIf you're going and\ngrabbing e-mails, you could grab\n\n1084\n01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:45,080\nother stuff that are concerning\nother people and other situations.\n\n1085\n01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,700\nThose are gonna need to be kept private.\n\n1086\n01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,820\nLest you get in trouble so\nyou wanna do that.\n\n1087\n01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:54,490\nI also remember you need search\nwarrants for two things with this.\n\n1088\n01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:56,730\nThe server and the computer.\n\n1089\n01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:58,910\nYou might have to have it for\nboth, you know.\n\n1090\n01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,650\nDepending on where you;re searching.\n\n1091\n01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:04,280\n>> Lots of money to make sure\nthat warrant covers both.\n\n1092\n01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,440\n>> Yeah, or\nbe appropriately covered if you need it.\n\n1093\n01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,720\nIf one covers both.\n\n1094\n01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:12,830\nAnd I believe in a lot of cases you can\nactually spell it out in one warrant and\n\n1095\n01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:16,410\nsay they wanna get stuff here and\nhere, they might break it in two.\n\n1096\n01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:20,310\nI mean, if they're not located in the same\narea, you might very well have to do two\n\n1097\n01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:25,410\nanyway, but it's something to definitely\nconsider cuz you do remember,\n\n1098\n01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,660\njust with the Microsoft side of things.\n\n1099\n01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:32,210\nWe do have things like PST files,\nand other stuff,\n\n1100\n01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:35,300\nthat reside on that system\nthat can store things.\n\n1101\n01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,550\nSo that's another area to search.\n\n1102\n01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,460\nAll right, so once we've got our warrant,\nwe've covered ourselves legally,\n\n1103\n01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,020\nwhether we need a warrant or\nnot, and we're covered there.\n\n1104\n01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,780\nAnd we start, one of the first things\nwe're doing with that is kinda like we\n\n1105\n01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:50,050\ntalked about with a hard drive,\nis capture that account,\n\n1106\n01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:53,760\nthat email account or that mail box\noff that mail server, as an image?\n\n1107\n01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,710\n>> Yes.\nThere's usually some way on every email\n\n1108\n01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:03,930\nsystem that you can get a bit by bit\nimage, basically a forensically sound copy\n\n1109\n01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:07,660\nof what is in someone's account, including\nall the slacks [INAUDIBLE] and stuff like\n\n1110\n01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:11,620\nthat where it might throw deleted e-mails,\nyou can grab the whole thing.\n\n1111\n01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,070\nYou know,\nevery system has some way of doing that.\n\n1112\n01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:18,410\nWhether its built in or\nits something that's third party,\n\n1113\n01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:22,240\nyou can attract that information and\nhave it to search through.\n\n1114\n01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,930\nAnd we're doing it for the same reason\nhere, that we did it in other places.\n\n1115\n01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:33,190\nFirst of all, we need to get what it\nlooked like at the point of collection.\n\n1116\n01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,350\nSo we're collecting it and preserving it.\n\n1117\n01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:39,070\nAnd then we're gonna use the copy\n\n1118\n01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:42,358\nof the original to be the one\nthat we conduct our analysis on.\n\n1119\n01:03:42,358 --> 01:03:47,080\nSo we don't tamper with anything and\nnothing disappears and\n\n1120\n01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,040\nall that good stuff.\n\n1121\n01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,340\n>> Probably doing our same thing, like\ngetting that image and then hashing it.\n\n1122\n01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:54,319\nGetting the copy of it,\nmake sure those hash values match.\n\n1123\n01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,119\n>> Yeah, all that stuff and\n\n1124\n01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:01,193\nmost of the forensic software that\nyou can use to do this sort of thing.\n\n1125\n01:04:01,193 --> 01:04:02,980\nThey all have those things built in.\n\n1126\n01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,419\nBut there's ones that don't.\n\n1127\n01:04:04,419 --> 01:04:09,754\nThere's ones that are meant just for\nIT level stuff, to help recover mailboxes,\n\n1128\n01:04:09,754 --> 01:04:13,560\nanybody that's been through\nexchange has had to do that.\n\n1129\n01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,984\nProbably more times than they can count.\n\n1130\n01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:17,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With any email server you've had\n\n1131\n01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,950\nan account that's gone bad, and you've\nhad to do it but most of us use exchange.\n\n1132\n01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:24,920\nSo, you always hear stories about\nanyone that's used it has had to do it\n\n1133\n01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,170\nbunches of time.\n\n1134\n01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:30,390\nSo, they have tools built specifically for\n\n1135\n01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:33,500\nthat to speed that process up so,\nyou may be using those, or\n\n1136\n01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,240\nit may be using one specifically for\nthe process we're talking about.\n\n1137\n01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:42,900\n>> And then once we've got that image and\nwe start working with these emails.\n\n1138\n01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,475\nProbably the first thing, we hinted\nat it a little bit earlier, one of\n\n1139\n01:04:45,475 --> 01:04:50,085\nthe first things we're gonna look at would\nbe the header of that email, all right?\n\n1140\n01:04:50,085 --> 01:04:54,965\n>> Yes, you very well could start\nat examining headers of emails for\n\n1141\n01:04:54,965 --> 01:04:59,832\nwhere they came from, who they're\ngoing to, who's included on it.\n\n1142\n01:04:59,832 --> 01:05:01,992\nDates and time ranges.\n\n1143\n01:05:01,992 --> 01:05:06,132\nThen you can also even go through and\nthrow in things like keyword searches and\n\n1144\n01:05:06,132 --> 01:05:07,042\nstuff like that,\n\n1145\n01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:11,339\nto kind of extract stuff relating to\nwhatever it is you're looking for.\n\n1146\n01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:16,010\nSo, you're just kinda searching\nthrough that archive if you will,\n\n1147\n01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:18,880\nto see what's available in there.\n\n1148\n01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,010\nSo, if there's anything in there that\nsupports what you're looking for,\n\n1149\n01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:23,610\nyour line of thinking.\n\n1150\n01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:25,360\nIt's gonna take awhile though too.\n\n1151\n01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:30,470\nDo remember, those archives in\nthose mailboxes can get pretty big,\n\n1152\n01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:31,660\ncome on [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1153\n01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,275\n>> Any email mister can tell you that or\nmail server mister tell.\n\n1154\n01:05:34,275 --> 01:05:36,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Has a story about.\n\n1155\n01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,930\n>> Yeah.\n>> What are these people storing in\n\n1156\n01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:39,222\ntheir mailboxes?\n\n1157\n01:05:39,222 --> 01:05:42,380\nYou're gonna have to, you may very\nwell have to search through that.\n\n1158\n01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,986\nAnd that doesn't even include the other\nstuff that they may have on their system,\n\n1159\n01:05:45,986 --> 01:05:48,770\nthat they've downloaded and\nyou got to search that now, too.\n\n1160\n01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:52,250\n>> I know one gentleman,\nI didn't deal with him personally but.\n\n1161\n01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:55,900\nThey had a limit on their mailbox size,\nwhich most places do because,\n\n1162\n01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:59,190\nas you said they can get huge if\npeople don't clean out their mailbox.\n\n1163\n01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:02,890\nSo, he was storing all of his\nmail in his deleted folder.\n\n1164\n01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:05,380\nThat is where he was putting everything,\nall of his backups and\n\n1165\n01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,730\nthen something happened to them of course.\n\n1166\n01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,010\nThey had problems.\n\n1167\n01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:11,300\nHe accidentally cleaned\nout his deleted folder.\n\n1168\n01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,380\nAnd all of his emails disappeared.\n\n1169\n01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,950\nBut, it was just funny to realize\nthat he was actually using that\n\n1170\n01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:19,330\nas a place to store-\n>> You're doing what?\n\n1171\n01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:20,291\n[CROSSTALK] Hold on,\nI don't think I heard you right.\n\n1172\n01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:24,270\n[LAUGH]\n>> Doesn't affect my mailbox size.\n\n1173\n01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,350\nSo we're gonna examine that header,\n\n1174\n01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:30,426\nget a lot of good information out of\nthat as far as like, true source and\n\n1175\n01:06:30,426 --> 01:06:33,944\ndestination type things servers, routing\nservers that it was bounced off of.\n\n1176\n01:06:33,944 --> 01:06:36,218\nAnd then other than of course,\nthe body, I mean,\n\n1177\n01:06:36,218 --> 01:06:39,793\ndepending on what we're doing look at\nthe body of the messages where the actual\n\n1178\n01:06:39,793 --> 01:06:42,245\ninformation is that they're sending or\nreceiving.\n\n1179\n01:06:42,245 --> 01:06:44,450\nAnd then-\n>> Chris has got us beat.\n\n1180\n01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:46,421\n>> What's that?\n>> 2 GB

massive.\n\n1184\n01:06:52,574 --> 01:06:55,776\nThat email is from the last decade,\nor something like that.\n\n1185\n01:06:55,776 --> 01:06:57,605\n>> Yeah, what did you have,\nI just got to ask,\n\n1186\n01:06:57,605 --> 01:07:01,035\ndo they have the first email that was sent\nin the internet and everything forward?\n\n1187\n01:07:01,035 --> 01:07:05,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They got email's baby picture and\n\n1188\n01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,862\nthen all this stuff forward.\n\n1189\n01:07:06,862 --> 01:07:08,558\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right!\n\n1190\n01:07:08,558 --> 01:07:09,543\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n1191\n01:07:09,543 --> 01:07:11,681\nthen the other thing we\ngotta worry about emails is-\n\n1192\n01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:12,459\n>> Attachments right?\n\n1193\n01:07:12,459 --> 01:07:15,840\nThere can be other things that\ncome along with that email.\n\n1194\n01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:21,060\n>> Yeah, that's another whole\nother layer there is that,\n\n1195\n01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,040\nwhat is definitely\nattached to those emails?\n\n1196\n01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,310\nThere's and we all know there's a lot of\nthings, that can be attached to an email.\n\n1197\n01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:32,880\nReally anything for intents and\npurposes can be attached to an email.\n\n1198\n01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,410\nIt's just a question of\nwhat filtering is going on?\n\n1199\n01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:37,390\nWill the system allow it.\n\n1200\n01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:38,292\nThose types of things.\n\n1201\n01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:42,420\nSize limitations,\ncan keep certain things from popping up or\n\n1202\n01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,644\nbeing attached to an email.\n\n1203\n01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:48,690\nBut, you can literally attach\nanything to an email, so\n\n1204\n01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:53,790\nnow we've got to look at those too, and\nsee what type of attachments may be there.\n\n1205\n01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:59,190\nIt could be, for example,\nthey're using it to distribute files\n\n1206\n01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:04,900\nthat are leaking to an outside party,\nthey could be something where your\n\n1207\n01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:12,020\ncompany's gotten malware\nthrough email is a common one.\n\n1208\n01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:17,880\nSo, those scripts attached to email,\nso you're seeking out those things.\n\n1209\n01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,710\nSo, there's a number of different\nways you can go with it.\n\n1210\n01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:23,670\nWe've seen a lot of stuff,\njust from the malware part,\n\n1211\n01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,410\nwe've seen stuff in the past.\n\n1212\n01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:29,990\nWhere people have distributed all\nsorts of malware through email, and\n\n1213\n01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:31,408\ncaused all sorts of headaches.\n\n1214\n01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:34,660\nWe had the Melissa one,\n\n1215\n01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:39,710\nand a whole host of other ones,\nthat are still continuing to this day.\n\n1216\n01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:41,330\nSo, it is a very popular one.\n\n1217\n01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:46,230\nAnd in the case of Melissa, this is one\nwhere they forensically went through,\n\n1218\n01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:50,980\nand they had to get samples out of places\nlike this, because that's where it lived.\n\n1219\n01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:53,840\nLike I said,\nthey still do that sort of thing.\n\n1220\n01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,750\n>> And then above and\n\n1221\n01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,690\nbeyond our attachments, we also have\nto got to get a windows environment.\n\n1222\n01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:01,180\nWe have got OST files.\n\n1223\n01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,480\nWe have got PST files.\n\n1224\n01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:07,820\nWhere as if I wanted to keep a file\nlocally, or clean out my inbox,\n\n1225\n01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,820\nlike some people don't do.\n\n1226\n01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:11,190\n>> Yeah.\n>> But, my mailbox has hit it's limit.\n\n1227\n01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:13,180\nI need to free up some of that space.\n\n1228\n01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:15,890\nSo maybe, I archive some of those and\nwhen you archive them,\n\n1229\n01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:17,650\nit creates that PST file I think it is.\n\n1230\n01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:19,470\nOr is it the OST I always\nget those backwards.\n\n1231\n01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:22,350\n>> PST.\n>> PST file when you archive that mail, so\n\n1232\n01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:25,600\nthat way it's still visible in your\nmailbox, but it's stored locally and\n\n1233\n01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,680\nnot up on a mail server anymore.\n\n1234\n01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,810\nSo that'd be another place\nthat we'd have to look, and\n\n1235\n01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:31,660\nI think you mentioned that earlier.\n\n1236\n01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:35,258\nThat OST file is for, I can't remember,\nis that for offline usage?\n\n1237\n01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:40,350\nThat's for [CROSSTALK]\n>> I'm definitely not the exchange expert.\n\n1238\n01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:41,830\n>> I think it's offline, yeah.\n\n1239\n01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,720\n>> So,\na few more places we have to look there.\n\n1240\n01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,280\nOther types of files,\nwe'd have to deal with emails?\n\n1241\n01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:51,520\n>> Yeah, there's other ones that would\nhave to be specific to different messaging\n\n1242\n01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,720\nsystems that those things could reside in.\n\n1243\n01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,590\nAny messaging system you have out there,\n\n1244\n01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,910\nis gonna generate things\nalong the same lines.\n\n1245\n01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:01,480\nOf course they're gonna have attachments.\n\n1246\n01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:05,780\nBut then, there's gonna be files that\nstore local copies of your mailbox in.\n\n1247\n01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:12,540\nThere's gonna be other files that\nhelp you search, and locate emails.\n\n1248\n01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:15,600\nThere's a bunch of things\nthat could exist up, and\n\n1249\n01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,630\non top of any email system out there.\n\n1250\n01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:21,920\nSo, this doesn't just apply to exchange.\n\n1251\n01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,800\nWe're using it as an example\nin the Microsoft world.\n\n1252\n01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,440\nBut no matter what you've got,\n\n1253\n01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,870\nthey're gonna have something\nout there to store it in.\n\n1254\n01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:31,320\nAnd something to remember is,\n\n1255\n01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,970\nthere's still a lot of old\nemail systems out there.\n\n1256\n01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:39,200\nI joked around and said ccmail earlier.\n\n1257\n01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,520\nI used ccmail back in the mid 90s.\n\n1258\n01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,100\nIt didn't stay in the mid 90s.\n\n1259\n01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,610\nIt's still out there.\n\n1260\n01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:51,240\nIt wasn't too long ago I joked with\nsomeone about that saying, the first\n\n1261\n01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:56,540\nenterprise email system I really was able\nto get into and poke around in was ccmail.\n\n1262\n01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:59,380\nAnd I says, but I don't think\nanyone uses that anymore, and\n\n1263\n01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,580\na guy says no,\nwe still got it in one of our shops.\n\n1264\n01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:06,200\nAnd I had to pick my jaw up off\nthe floor and be like, you did what now?\n\n1265\n01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,600\n>> Some of these people, it still sends\nand receives mail, what more do we need?\n\n1266\n01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,160\nWhy upgrade?\n\n1267\n01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:10,890\nWhy spend the money?\n\n1268\n01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:12,420\nWhy buy new licenses?\n\n1269\n01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:13,600\nIt does just fine.\n\n1270\n01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n1271\n01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:16,050\n>> That's the way a lot\nof these companies run,\n\n1272\n01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:18,930\nwhich means as a forensic investigator,\nwe've gotta be familiar with\n\n1273\n01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,540\nthe different technologies,\nbecause we might run into it.\n\n1274\n01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:24,000\n>> Yeah, that's where that's going,\nis that yes,\n\n1275\n01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,150\nyou will have to be familiar\nwith those messaging systems.\n\n1276\n01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:34,690\nOr more than likely know where to get\nthe information some things are universal.\n\n1277\n01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:39,080\nYou expect on any messaging system,\nthe protocols for example.\n\n1278\n01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:46,223\nI haven't seen any messaging systems,\npast the early 90s or\n\n1279\n01:11:46,223 --> 01:11:51,238\nlate 80s,\nthe proprietary ones that haven't used,\n\n1280\n01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:53,916\nor at least a couple of those.\n\n1281\n01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:56,725\nIt's, so those are standard things.\n\n1282\n01:11:56,725 --> 01:11:59,814\nWe expect to see mailbox accounts for\npeople.\n\n1283\n01:11:59,814 --> 01:12:01,509\nThey may call it something different.\n\n1284\n01:12:01,509 --> 01:12:03,367\nBut, we expect to see those things.\n\n1285\n01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:06,780\nSo, those things you should be okay with,\nno matter where you go.\n\n1286\n01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:10,970\nBut, specifics of files and\nwhere things go when they are deleted, and\n\n1287\n01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:13,960\nhow they are retained and\nall those policies?\n\n1288\n01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:18,000\nThat is and, that's something that's\ngoing to be specific to that system.\n\n1289\n01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,990\n>> All right?\n\n1290\n01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:22,780\nAnd speaking of deleted, we need to know\nwhere to look for those, because people\n\n1291\n01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:25,920\nare either trying to cover their tracks,\nso they've deleted something.\n\n1292\n01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,150\nOr just through normal process\nthey end up deleting things, and\n\n1293\n01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:31,490\nwe need to make that part\nof our investigation.\n\n1294\n01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:32,970\nSo, we've gotta be able\nto find those files,\n\n1295\n01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:35,930\nbut know where they're located, right?\n\n1296\n01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:37,200\n>> Yes.\nAnd\n\n1297\n01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,840\nevery system has a way\nof dealing with this.\n\n1298\n01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,160\nThey will, when you delete\nan email that goes some place.\n\n1299\n01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:46,830\nIn exchange, there's a special place\nthat it puts it, and keeps it there.\n\n1300\n01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:49,580\nAnd you can actually\nextract them out of there.\n\n1301\n01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:54,733\nI know stuff like NetWare groupwise.\n\n1302\n01:12:54,733 --> 01:12:56,161\n>> Groupwise, yeah.\n\n1303\n01:12:56,161 --> 01:12:58,030\n>> They've got away with doing it.\n\n1304\n01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:01,838\nIf my friends are watching by the way,\nthat one is for you because,\n\n1305\n01:13:01,838 --> 01:13:03,406\nI know you hate Groupwise.\n\n1306\n01:13:03,406 --> 01:13:05,228\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, I'm just kidding.\n\n1307\n01:13:05,228 --> 01:13:09,025\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, he had notes too.\n\n1308\n01:13:09,025 --> 01:13:14,344\nI'm kind of kidding around, but\nactually I do have a friend that\n\n1309\n01:13:14,344 --> 01:13:19,580\nhad to work group wise, and\nlotus notes in the recent history.\n\n1310\n01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:25,632\nHe was just, the lotus notes was the one\nthat he was having nightmares about.\n\n1311\n01:13:25,632 --> 01:13:29,685\nBut, it's out there, and again it has\nits own way of storing things too.\n\n1312\n01:13:29,685 --> 01:13:34,570\nBut, from a messaging system\nthat things just don't go bye,\n\n1313\n01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:35,520\nwhen you hit the Delete key.\n\n1314\n01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:41,195\nThey go someplace, and now it's just your\njob to go through and retrieve that.\n\n1315\n01:13:41,195 --> 01:13:43,540\n>> So knowing some other files out there,\n\n1316\n01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:46,065\nthat's what we're talking about,\nI mean, heck.\n\n1317\n01:13:46,065 --> 01:13:48,332\n>> If you look at some of the forensics\nbooks, believe it or not, and\n\n1318\n01:13:48,332 --> 01:13:49,125\nsome of the guidance.\n\n1319\n01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:53,445\nThey still actually tell\npeople the structure, and\n\n1320\n01:13:53,445 --> 01:13:58,460\nhow to retrieve emails and\nevidence out of Outlook Express.\n\n1321\n01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:01,852\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and you thought no one used it.\n\n1322\n01:14:01,852 --> 01:14:02,850\n>> I used it.\n\n1323\n01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:06,655\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, good deal.\n\n1324\n01:14:06,655 --> 01:14:11,130\nSo, when it comes to our steps\nto investigating, we really have\n\n1325\n01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:14,390\nto think about what we're doing and just\nbe familiar with the different systems.\n\n1326\n01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,270\nWe got a make sure we're covered legally,\n\n1327\n01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:19,960\nwhether that's because of some clause\nin the employee hiring process.\n\n1328\n01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,810\nThat gives us access to those mails\nservers, or whether we have to be able to\n\n1329\n01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:27,200\nobtain a warrant, to make sure we're\ncovered to get access to that.\n\n1330\n01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,390\nWe've got to be familiar with\nexamining those headers, looking for\n\n1331\n01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:33,200\nthe, lot of good information buried\nin those headers, source and\n\n1332\n01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,470\ndestination information, things like that.\n\n1333\n01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:40,250\nGetting that image of that mailbox, so\nwe can do that thorough examination\n\n1334\n01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:44,080\nwithout modifying anything, so the\nevidence still holds up in a court of law.\n\n1335\n01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,830\nWe've got to be able to, or\n\n1336\n01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:49,030\nwe got to keep in mind that there's\nother files other than emails.\n\n1337\n01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:51,550\nRight, there's the attachments\nthat we could have,\n\n1338\n01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:55,130\nimages could be part of the investigation,\nwe've got to those attachments,\n\n1339\n01:14:55,130 --> 01:15:00,080\nfiles are attaching,\nyou said leaking out documents.\n\n1340\n01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,920\nAnd then the offline stuff,\nthe SOT files, we got the PST files.\n\n1341\n01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,250\nFor when they've made it a local archive,\nand this is just Exchange or\n\n1342\n01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:11,440\nMicrosoft, same thing same process\nthat most of our mail systems.\n\n1343\n01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,740\nThen we've got deleted emails\nthat we have to deal with,\n\n1344\n01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:15,730\nwe have to be able to recover those guys.\n\n1345\n01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:19,000\nKnowing where they're stored, and\nthe process, because each mail server has\n\n1346\n01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,830\na different way of recovering\nitems that have been deleted.\n\n1347\n01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:22,332\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1348\n01:15:22,332 --> 01:15:25,503\n>> All right, well I'll tell you what,\nladies and gentlemen it's about time for\n\n1349\n01:15:25,503 --> 01:15:27,603\nus to take a break, so\nwe're gonna stop right here.\n\n1350\n01:15:27,603 --> 01:15:31,976\nWhen we come back, we're gonna take a look\nat a couple tools we can use to perform\n\n1351\n01:15:31,976 --> 01:15:34,084\nthis investigation, so stay tuned.\n\n1352\n01:15:34,084 --> 01:15:35,186\nWe'll be right back.\n\n1353\n01:15:35,186 --> 01:15:39,935\n[MUSIC]\n\n1354\n01:15:42,025 --> 01:15:43,945\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n1355\n01:15:43,945 --> 01:15:46,905\nSo, we are getting ready to take a look\nat some of the tools we can use,\n\n1356\n01:15:46,905 --> 01:15:50,305\nwhen our investigation\nleads us towards emails.\n\n1357\n01:15:50,305 --> 01:15:54,195\nAnd we have to start pulling\ninformation out of email servers, and\n\n1358\n01:15:54,195 --> 01:15:56,997\nemails themselves.\n\n1359\n01:15:56,997 --> 01:16:01,597\n>> Yeah, there's a bunch of tools for\nthis, and I want to make you guys\n\n1360\n01:16:01,597 --> 01:16:05,867\naware of some of these\ntools that you can access.\n\n1361\n01:16:05,867 --> 01:16:07,027\nA lot of them have trial versions.\n\n1362\n01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:13,668\nSome of them are completely free,\nin fact there's one in here that\n\n1363\n01:16:13,668 --> 01:16:18,678\nI'm gonna mention that is even\ndesigned to be just a mail client,\n\n1364\n01:16:18,678 --> 01:16:23,248\nwith additional functions on it that allow\nyou to track where stuff comes from.\n\n1365\n01:16:23,248 --> 01:16:29,810\nSo, it's kind of some neat stuff so,\nbroken them down into two categories here,\n\n1366\n01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:33,820\ndeleted emails, and\nthe ability to track where they came from.\n\n1367\n01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,100\nTwo very important things,\n\n1368\n01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:39,470\ncuz you have to you will have to go\nthrough an archive at some point.\n\n1369\n01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:43,470\nAnd so you already have tools built for\nthat, and\n\n1370\n01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:46,590\nmost of the messaging,\nwell really all the email server software.\n\n1371\n01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:50,300\nAnd then you could load up archives\nin a copy of the mail client, so\n\n1372\n01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,660\nyou get an image and\njust load it in there.\n\n1373\n01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:56,170\nBut, then there's stuff we\nhave to do if they're deleted.\n\n1374\n01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:59,700\nSometimes, you're gonna\nrun into mail servers that\n\n1375\n01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:05,080\ndon't make it easy to get those or get\nthose in a way that will be useful to you.\n\n1376\n01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:11,230\nOr there may have some,\nother issues you have to deal with that.\n\n1377\n01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12,680\nYou have to go third party for.\n\n1378\n01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,800\nThat's just one part of it,\nthe recovery, then we have the tracking.\n\n1379\n01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,620\nThose two things are very useful.\n\n1380\n01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:23,925\nSo, starting with deleted emails.\n\n1381\n01:17:23,925 --> 01:17:29,330\n>> Yeah, deleted emails, there is actually\na good number of people in this space.\n\n1382\n01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:33,390\nIt makes you wonder,\nis deleted email that big of a problem?\n\n1383\n01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:34,381\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1384\n01:17:34,381 --> 01:17:35,141\n>> There's so\n\n1385\n01:17:35,141 --> 01:17:37,649\nmany competitors that are designed for\n\n1386\n01:17:37,649 --> 01:17:42,209\njust regular IT stuff, and\nthen there's a few for forensic purposes,\n\n1387\n01:17:42,209 --> 01:17:46,020\nkind of like you'd expect the ones for\nthe forensics side.\n\n1388\n01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:50,510\nBut, just have this huge field of these\n\n1389\n01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:54,564\ntechnologies used to delete and recover\nand repair and everything else, too.\n\n1390\n01:17:54,564 --> 01:17:58,385\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> The end-users, they delete emails and\n\n1391\n01:17:58,385 --> 01:17:58,965\ngo crap.\n\n1392\n01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:00,930\nI didn't mean to delete that.\n\n1393\n01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:04,385\n>> Support would be so much easier, if you\ndidn't actually have to deal with anybody.\n\n1394\n01:18:04,385 --> 01:18:06,380\n>> Yeah.\n>> If there was no one using the system,\n\n1395\n01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:07,285\nit would be a lot easier.\n\n1396\n01:18:07,285 --> 01:18:08,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n1397\n01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:12,970\nso what are some of the programs you\nhad in mind for us, take a look at.\n\n1398\n01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:17,330\n>> One of the ones, right off the bat,\nwe wanna talk about.\n\n1399\n01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:22,070\nThis isn't the only time you're gonna\nhear it mentioned, or mentioned,\n\n1400\n01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:27,062\ndiscussed and later on we're gonna see it,\nis one called Stellar Phoenix.\n\n1401\n01:18:27,062 --> 01:18:31,990\nStellar Phoenix, is really kind of\na cool one when you get down to it.\n\n1402\n01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:38,310\nBecause it cannot only\nrecover deleted files and\n\n1403\n01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:42,810\njust off the hard drive itself outside the\nemail system, it has that capability, but\n\n1404\n01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:48,160\nit also has tools that allow you to\ngo inside an email archive itself.\n\n1405\n01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:52,020\nAnd start extracting deleted\ninformation from it.\n\n1406\n01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:55,030\nSo, kind of neat in that respect.\n\n1407\n01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:59,330\nSo, we really do like that one especially\nsince the fact that its dual purpose.\n\n1408\n01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:03,280\nIt can do file recovery right off the hard\ndrive, with some extra bells, and\n\n1409\n01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,420\nwhistles that we'll talk about\nin the file recovery portion.\n\n1410\n01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:11,310\nAnd then it has some stuff geared\nspecifically towards email\n\n1411\n01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:17,935\nclients and email servers, so that's\na good one that's to start off with.\n\n1412\n01:19:17,935 --> 01:19:21,135\n>> All right, so you've got\nStellar Info I think is who makes that.\n\n1413\n01:19:21,135 --> 01:19:22,455\nStellar Phoenix?\n\n1414\n01:19:22,455 --> 01:19:22,955\n>> Yes.\n\n1415\n01:19:23,975 --> 01:19:25,325\n>> What else we got?\n\n1416\n01:19:25,325 --> 01:19:28,930\n>> You got another one I put in\nhere called Recover My Email.\n\n1417\n01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:33,110\nIt's another one that just kind\nof has been sitting out there for\n\n1418\n01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:38,130\nawhile, it does the job just like it says,\nit's very simple.\n\n1419\n01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:43,650\nIt will extract stuff out of an archive,\nand deleted emails out of an archive and.\n\n1420\n01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:44,749\nDisplay them to you.\n\n1421\n01:19:44,749 --> 01:19:50,738\nSomething worth mentioning in here,\nsomething like Stellar Phoenix and\n\n1422\n01:19:50,738 --> 01:19:55,276\nsome of these other ones that\nrecover deleted files, or\n\n1423\n01:19:55,276 --> 01:19:58,866\ndeleted emails out of a archive or\naccount.\n\n1424\n01:19:58,866 --> 01:20:03,757\nYou have ones that will just recover\nan email that's in one complete piece, and\n\n1425\n01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,110\nsay here you go.\n\n1426\n01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:09,120\nBut then there's ones that if that\narchive has been re-adjusted in size.\n\n1427\n01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,410\nAnd there's just pieces and\n\n1428\n01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:14,700\nfragments of an email, they can actually\nreassemble those in some cases.\n\n1429\n01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:17,860\nSo if the archive has been compacted or\n\n1430\n01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:23,280\nanything like that, or maintained in\nanyway, shape, or form, it can grab that.\n\n1431\n01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,130\nYou may have it where it's been corrupted.\n\n1432\n01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,730\nSo now you have to go in.\n\n1433\n01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:29,680\n>> Wait you have a corrupted PST file?\n\n1434\n01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:30,390\nNever.\n\n1435\n01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:32,071\n>> Yeah it never happens,\nthat's why I said if.\n\n1436\n01:20:32,071 --> 01:20:32,726\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In theory.\n\n1437\n01:20:32,726 --> 01:20:37,270\n>> We had a few comments in the chatroom\n\n1438\n01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:40,070\nabout how Microsoft actually\nmakes tools to repair it.\n\n1439\n01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:42,899\nBecause it is such a common problem,\nhaving corruption in those things.\n\n1440\n01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:49,175\nSo recover my email and this one called\nthat I haven't fiddled with this, Zmail?\n\n1441\n01:20:49,175 --> 01:20:53,170\n>> Yeah, Zmail is another one\n>> Do you pronounce that way?\n\n1442\n01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:55,859\n>> Yeah, that's [INAUDIBLE]\nfrom a French company Zmail.\n\n1443\n01:20:55,859 --> 01:20:58,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Couldn't help it, all right?\n\n1444\n01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,140\nIt's after lunch, I can't come up with\nanything better than that, work with me!\n\n1445\n01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:09,770\nYou know, so that's another one that does,\nit does deleted files as well\n\n1446\n01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:15,360\nas stuff in your inbox or it will\nretrieve those and display them to you.\n\n1447\n01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,460\nIt also got some other cool stuff.\n\n1448\n01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:24,990\nIf you look at their site,\nit can recover, deleted files.\n\n1449\n01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:27,500\nAnd master boot records it can fix,\n\n1450\n01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,120\nyou can see ray,\nwe were talking about that one.\n\n1451\n01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:35,220\nThat one's really nice, and\nthen digital photos even, really dig that.\n\n1452\n01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:40,840\nThere's actually recovery tools\nthat are targeted towards that,\n\n1453\n01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:45,740\nnot to mention if you go through\nthis you'll also find zmail.\n\n1454\n01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:48,590\nIt should be on here,\nhopefully I didn't pull it down.\n\n1455\n01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:50,710\nI saw it just a moment ago.\n\n1456\n01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:53,620\n>> Tools, is that what it is?\n\n1457\n01:21:53,620 --> 01:22:01,280\n>> Yeah, it looks like they stuck it\nin there but that's what zmail is.\n\n1458\n01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:06,150\nIt is pretty much specifically\ntargeted toward messaging systems but\n\n1459\n01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:11,050\nit does have these additional\nutilities on it that can help you.\n\n1460\n01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:14,840\nThat can help you do other stuff\nrevolving around the messaging system.\n\n1461\n01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:19,380\nSo you can go into an archive and then you\ncan do other little cool things with that.\n\n1462\n01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:23,195\nSo that would be Zmail.\n\n1463\n01:22:23,195 --> 01:22:28,125\nA quick recovery was another one that\n\n1464\n01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:33,280\nwas designed just to help people recover\ntheir mail boxes if they have been\n\n1465\n01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,540\ncorrupted or they've lost emails out\nof them, that's what it's designed for.\n\n1466\n01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:42,250\nSo it's more on the IT side of\nthings than the forensic side but\n\n1467\n01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:43,620\nit can be used for that.\n\n1468\n01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:48,649\nIt's something that's designed\nagain specifically for\n\n1469\n01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:51,790\nOutlook but\nit does have some other ones in here too.\n\n1470\n01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:56,930\nSome of these utilities are mentioning\nabout recovering deleted emails.\n\n1471\n01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:03,620\nIf you look at some of them, some of them\nwill work with a lot of other systems.\n\n1472\n01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:08,240\nAnd some of these systems,\nI just kind of scratch my head and\n\n1473\n01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:13,860\nthink is it that popular that\nsomeone still needed that support?\n\n1474\n01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:19,345\nOne of the ones I'll talk about here\nin a second still supports AOL.\n\n1475\n01:23:19,345 --> 01:23:21,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n1476\n01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:26,814\nthere's like those 4 people that\nare still using it, got your number.\n\n1477\n01:23:26,814 --> 01:23:28,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n1478\n01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:29,660\n>> And we can help you out as well.\n\n1479\n01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:31,813\nWe can recover emails for you.\n\n1480\n01:23:31,813 --> 01:23:34,990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's funny they still have one\n\n1481\n01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:39,100\nthat's supports that, in fact,\nit's not the only one.\n\n1482\n01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:44,000\nThat's what kind of stood out to me,\nhey we can help you recover stuff\n\n1483\n01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,520\nout of America Online\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1484\n01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,490\n>> Like okay,\n\n1485\n01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,880\nlet me get my free install disk with\n18 billion hours on it and go ahead,\n\n1486\n01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:53,640\nand try that.\n\n1487\n01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:57,700\n>> [LAUGH] So a lot of different programs\nthat we can use to try to recover\n\n1488\n01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:58,880\ndeleted emails.\n\n1489\n01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,435\nYou got Email Trace.\n\n1490\n01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:02,760\n>> Yeah there's Email Trace.\n\n1491\n01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,460\nThere is R Mail.\n\n1492\n01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:07,180\nThey are all pretty\nmuch the same zip code.\n\n1493\n01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:12,571\nThings designed to recovered\nemails that may have been lost,\n\n1494\n01:24:12,571 --> 01:24:18,070\naccidentally deleted,\nsome of them can repair corrupted.\n\n1495\n01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:23,260\nOr a lot of these can repair corrupted\ninboxes, which very well could happen.\n\n1496\n01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,360\nThink about it with what's going on here.\n\n1497\n01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:31,180\nSomeone could have gotten that Malware and\nlost.\n\n1498\n01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:36,020\nAnd had problems with the email\nsystem at that point and\n\n1499\n01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:38,450\ncaused their mailbox to become corrupted.\n\n1500\n01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:40,880\nThat's more than possible.\n\n1501\n01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,780\nThere could be to recover\nsome of these deleted\n\n1502\n01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:49,350\nemails out of some older systems that\nmaybe have been turned off for a while.\n\n1503\n01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:51,720\nAnd sometimes those\nthings are kind of funky.\n\n1504\n01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:57,000\nIn fact, this is, Chris kind of\nbeat me to the punch on this one,\n\n1505\n01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,640\nhe says, his boss still uses AOL.\n\n1506\n01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:02,340\nI joke around about this stuff, using AOL.\n\n1507\n01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,190\nI know there is a lot.\n\n1508\n01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:06,205\nI know there is a good\namount of users out there.\n\n1509\n01:25:06,205 --> 01:25:08,030\n[LAUGH]\n>> Fine.\n\n1510\n01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:13,760\nI don't know how many millions or\nhundreds or tens of users they have.\n\n1511\n01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,975\nBut, I'm sorry, did that slip out?\n\n1512\n01:25:14,975 --> 01:25:15,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n1513\n01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,570\nI don't know how many users they have.\n\n1514\n01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,080\nI know it's still a service out there.\n\n1515\n01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,730\nIt's still a reasonably sized service.\n\n1516\n01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:22,010\nI don't know if it's\nwhat would be considered\n\n1517\n01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:24,090\na major service anymore like it was.\n\n1518\n01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:27,540\nBut it's still big enough and\nthere's still enough users of it.\n\n1519\n01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:30,350\nAnd these other legacy\nsystems out there too.\n\n1520\n01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:34,300\nWhy would you need support for those?\n\n1521\n01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:39,440\nCuz they're still there and there's\nenough companies, I know of at least.\n\n1522\n01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:43,870\nAnd I've mentioned my\ncolleague as a great source\n\n1523\n01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:51,120\nof real world examples\non some of these things.\n\n1524\n01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,870\nBut he works, like I said,\nthe one I was talking about, works for\n\n1525\n01:25:54,870 --> 01:26:00,820\nthe State of California as\na Forensics Technician,\n\n1526\n01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:04,190\nwell as part of his job he does that.\n\n1527\n01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:10,750\nAnd what they do, is for people that\nused to be in charge of the agency,.\n\n1528\n01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:15,530\nWhat they do is whenever those\npeople leave, whoever is the head or\n\n1529\n01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:20,400\npeople at the top, they will take\ntheir notebook and their computer.\n\n1530\n01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,068\nThey image the drives and\nthose things all go in a vault.\n\n1531\n01:26:23,068 --> 01:26:26,100\nAnd only 3 people in the whole\nplace have the keys to it.\n\n1532\n01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:29,530\nHe's one of them and\nthere are the 2 other people.\n\n1533\n01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:31,520\nAnd no one can go in on their own.\n\n1534\n01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,000\nYou know, so, all those things.\n\n1535\n01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,540\nThose things can sit around.\n\n1536\n01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:40,650\nThey've got hard drives from computers\nthat were popular 10 years ago,\n\n1537\n01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:41,600\n15 years ago.\n\n1538\n01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,010\nThey have those sorts of things.\n\n1539\n01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:47,030\nThey may very well have been using\nsomething that's not exchange or\n\n1540\n01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:50,840\nnot one of the big messaging system.\n\n1541\n01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:56,180\nSo they will need something like this if\nthey need to recover deleted emails or\n\n1542\n01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,550\ndo any maintenance on those things\nbecause that system just isn't there.\n\n1543\n01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:00,320\nAnd what are you going to do?\n\n1544\n01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,850\nSay okay, I need to set-up that\nwhole system and go grab some books.\n\n1545\n01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:04,590\nAnd learn how to use it?\n\n1546\n01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:05,330\nNo, you're not.\n\n1547\n01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:06,250\nYou're not going to do that.\n\n1548\n01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:09,640\nYou need to be able to use this\nto recover if you do suspect\n\n1549\n01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,540\nthere's things that are deleted.\n\n1550\n01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,140\nAnd you need to check out.\n\n1551\n01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:13,285\nThis is how you're going to do it.\n\n1552\n01:27:13,285 --> 01:27:14,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You're going to go through and\n\n1553\n01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:18,970\ngrab one of those hard drives out of that\nvault if that's your type of situation.\n\n1554\n01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:22,650\nGrab something out of the vault.\n\n1555\n01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:24,900\nGet the image and work on the image.\n\n1556\n01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:28,020\nStart recovering stuff\nusing a tool like this.\n\n1557\n01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:32,350\nSo that's why that's important and\nit's still there in a lot of cases.\n\n1558\n01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:35,870\nAnd that has been done.\n\n1559\n01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:42,730\nI know in the case of that agency,\nmy friend was telling me that there were\n\n1560\n01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:47,750\nat least 2 cases in about a 4 year period\nwhere they'd had to do exactly that.\n\n1561\n01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:52,560\nThey had to go in the vault, grab at 1 of\nthe harddrives and start pulling things.\n\n1562\n01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,879\nThese are for people that have\nretired some time before that and\n\n1563\n01:27:56,879 --> 01:27:59,580\nthey just had their stuff still there.\n\n1564\n01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:05,361\nAnd something came up on, it was like\na bribery charge or some corruption thing.\n\n1565\n01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:06,894\nOr it was something like that.\n\n1566\n01:28:06,894 --> 01:28:09,634\nSomething along those lines.\n\n1567\n01:28:09,634 --> 01:28:13,245\nAnd so\nthe person that was leading that agency,\n\n1568\n01:28:13,245 --> 01:28:19,290\nthey had to go back to the vault and\npull their stuff from that point in time.\n\n1569\n01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:21,885\nAnd start sorting through it and\nyes, they did find evidence.\n\n1570\n01:28:21,885 --> 01:28:26,882\nIt's just in case they did that\nbecause they had some early situations\n\n1571\n01:28:26,882 --> 01:28:30,785\nwhere they weren't exercising\nthat sorta practice.\n\n1572\n01:28:30,785 --> 01:28:34,245\nSo what they did is they said, we\nare not going to do it for everybody but\n\n1573\n01:28:34,245 --> 01:28:35,604\njust the people at the top.\n\n1574\n01:28:35,604 --> 01:28:39,540\nWe never know what we might need from\ntheir system down the line, and so\n\n1575\n01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:41,884\nwe're going to treat everyone the same.\n\n1576\n01:28:41,884 --> 01:28:45,860\nAt the top we're gonna treat\neveryone the same, grab your stuff,\n\n1577\n01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:49,660\nshove it in the vault, and\nwhen you're done, that's it.\n\n1578\n01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:52,810\nIf an investigation comes up down\nthe road, we know we have it.\n\n1579\n01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:55,080\nWe're not like oh,\nlet's go through the backups.\n\n1580\n01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,450\nYou have the system that was\nissued to them and they worked on,\n\n1581\n01:28:58,450 --> 01:29:00,980\nno one else uses that system ever again.\n\n1582\n01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:03,210\nOnce they leave, it's in there.\n\n1583\n01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:08,034\nSo, it's really,\nreally a cool way of dealing with it,\n\n1584\n01:29:08,034 --> 01:29:12,858\nand you know,\nthey were able to forensically analyze and\n\n1585\n01:29:12,858 --> 01:29:16,460\ngather evidence to pursue these cases.\n\n1586\n01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:20,170\nAnd one of them, they actually were\nsuccessful in the prosecution.\n\n1587\n01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:23,440\nSo there you go.\n\n1588\n01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:28,180\n>> So yeah, I mean you never\nknow what you're gonna need and\n\n1589\n01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:30,160\nyou've gotta make sure\nyou can still access it.\n\n1590\n01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:33,250\nYou can archive this stuff for\nyears and years and years, but\n\n1591\n01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:37,210\nif it's old technology, dead technology,\ncan I get access to what I've saved?\n\n1592\n01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:39,083\nAnd that's important.\n\n1593\n01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:42,662\nSo we might actually use this as a way,\nnot to do an investigation, but\n\n1594\n01:29:42,662 --> 01:29:46,444\nto gain access to stuff we don't have\nthe system to run it live on any more.\n\n1595\n01:29:46,444 --> 01:29:48,840\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n1596\n01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:53,340\nAs this guy was saying, as Chris was\nsaying, that a boss was using AOL.\n\n1597\n01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:57,018\nOkay, using AOL, say what you will,\n\n1598\n01:29:57,018 --> 01:30:01,893\nyou can make all the jokes you want\nabout AOL, but at the end of the day.\n\n1599\n01:30:01,893 --> 01:30:02,500\n>> He was still using it.\n\n1600\n01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,320\n>> He was using it.\n\n1601\n01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:04,830\n>> Yep.\n>> And there could be stuff in there,\n\n1602\n01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:06,140\nso\n>> And\n\n1603\n01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:07,390\nI don't think anyone's arguing that.\n\n1604\n01:30:07,390 --> 01:30:09,360\n>> Right.\n>> If he's using it, he's not using it for\n\n1605\n01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,860\nhis work stuff, then that's-\n>> My brother still has an AOL\n\n1606\n01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:16,480\naccount primarily because he's\ngot the name that he wanted.\n\n1607\n01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:19,170\nAnd all his friends still\nhave that email address, so\n\n1608\n01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:20,460\nhe doesn't ever want to change them.\n\n1609\n01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:24,110\nHe's got other ones now,\nbut he still has that.\n\n1610\n01:30:24,110 --> 01:30:26,860\nI'm thinking this bad guy might want\nto try to go that route anyway.\n\n1611\n01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:28,340\nOne of the lesser known services,\n\n1612\n01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,800\nmight be a little easier\nto get away with something.\n\n1613\n01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,450\nWe definitely need to\ninvestigate all of that.\n\n1614\n01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:37,490\n>> Yeah, you have to be prepared and\nyou'll notice in all of these tools\n\n1615\n01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:41,950\nthat do recovery that they can mount and\nwork with several different formats.\n\n1616\n01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:47,600\nAnd I've looked at these tools,\nall these tools before.\n\n1617\n01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,410\nAnd you look at their websites, you're\ngonna go through and go, recognize that,\n\n1618\n01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:54,350\nrecognize that, what the heck is that and\nwhat the heck is that.\n\n1619\n01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:57,370\nYou'll see some really obscure stuff.\n\n1620\n01:30:57,370 --> 01:31:02,478\nIn my research I've found and\nmaybe other people know about this,\n\n1621\n01:31:02,478 --> 01:31:07,470\nbut I found clients by for example,\nVMware has an email client.\n\n1622\n01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:11,050\nThey've got one that's like a mole,\nit's kinda like their version of Outlook.\n\n1623\n01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:12,760\nYou don't see it all that often.\n\n1624\n01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,670\nBut they have it, and the format's\nsupported by some of these tools.\n\n1625\n01:31:17,112 --> 01:31:19,990\n>> All right, so we have a lot of\ndifferent tools we can use to try to go\n\n1626\n01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:23,230\nahead and recover deleted emails,\nfind those deleted emails.\n\n1627\n01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:26,650\nThe other thing we might want to be\nable to do is trace those emails, right?\n\n1628\n01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:29,050\nWhere did that email come from,\nor went to,\n\n1629\n01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:34,370\nor where it went through on its\nway to its final destination Yes.\n\n1630\n01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:39,300\n>> That's a big one is having these tools\n\n1631\n01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:44,340\navailable to see where that particular\nyou know email had originated.\n\n1632\n01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:49,140\nBecause we talked about\nways to spoof headers and\n\n1633\n01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:54,610\ndo all sorts of funky things you\nknow things to kinda obscure it.\n\n1634\n01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:58,520\nSo you may need some help tracking\nthis stuff back when you start\n\n1635\n01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,070\ngoing through all these things.\n\n1636\n01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:04,170\nSo one of the tools that we have is\nsomething that we're gonna explore\n\n1637\n01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:10,290\na little more down the road is something\ncalled the Forensic Toolkit by AccessData.\n\n1638\n01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:13,400\nIt is something you can go ahead and\ndownload, and\n\n1639\n01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,820\nit's got a lot of nice stuff in it.\n\n1640\n01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:22,480\n>> And not just for here,\nbut for other places.\n\n1641\n01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:27,870\nIt can do email recovery, it can do file\nrecovery, it can do stuff out of images.\n\n1642\n01:32:29,025 --> 01:32:33,275\nIt's the pretty powerful and\nthey've got a trial version and\n\n1643\n01:32:33,275 --> 01:32:37,395\nthen they've got a paid version and\nit's a pretty decent size, too.\n\n1644\n01:32:37,395 --> 01:32:39,868\nIt's like 2.4 gigs, I think.\n\n1645\n01:32:39,868 --> 01:32:40,431\n>> Wow.\n\n1646\n01:32:40,431 --> 01:32:42,048\n>> Is what you're talking\nabout downloading,\n\n1647\n01:32:42,048 --> 01:32:44,410\nso\n>> [LAUGH] Be prepared for\n\n1648\n01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:47,400\nthat if you need to download that one,\ntake a look at it.\n\n1649\n01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:51,770\nThen you got another one on our list,\neMailTracker or eMailTrackerPro.\n\n1650\n01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:55,840\n>> Yeah, eMailTrackerPro, I have it here.\n\n1651\n01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,150\nIt's on the eMailTrackerPro web site.\n\n1652\n01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:01,810\nOne of the best and\neasiest names to remember.\n\n1653\n01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:02,885\nWhat are you looking for?\n\n1654\n01:33:02,885 --> 01:33:05,490\neMailTrackerPro, got it.\n\n1655\n01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:11,115\nSo what you have here, this is something\nthat can not only help you send and\n\n1656\n01:33:11,115 --> 01:33:14,308\nreceive emails as a regular mail client.\n\n1657\n01:33:14,308 --> 01:33:17,968\nBut it also has some features there\nthat help you track it back to where it\n\n1658\n01:33:17,968 --> 01:33:18,580\ncame from.\n\n1659\n01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:23,830\nSo you can actually highlight an email\nin your inbox and hit Track and\n\n1660\n01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:27,330\nit will go bounce bounce bounce and\nwill go find where it came from.\n\n1661\n01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:29,780\nRight there integrated\ninto that client self.\n\n1662\n01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:33,300\nSo basically it is reading that header for\nyou and saying,\n\n1663\n01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:36,380\nwell this is what I was able to determine.\n\n1664\n01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:41,130\nAnd you could use your skills that you've\ngot from other areas to start a closer\n\n1665\n01:33:41,130 --> 01:33:45,500\nexamination so,\nthat's something to keep in mind.\n\n1666\n01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:49,560\nIn fact, that's something going back\nto yesterday when we were doing our\n\n1667\n01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:53,893\nnetwork and web application, forensics\nis when you do the web applications.\n\n1668\n01:33:53,893 --> 01:33:56,737\nWhich email systems,\ndepending on how they're configured and\n\n1669\n01:33:56,737 --> 01:33:59,487\nthe features they offer,\nthey do count as web applications.\n\n1670\n01:33:59,487 --> 01:34:02,256\nIf you're using something like,\nyou know those web interfaces,\n\n1671\n01:34:02,256 --> 01:34:04,040\nit's now a web application.\n\n1672\n01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:10,570\nIf you have someone striking at that and\nyou're investigated that in the aftermath.\n\n1673\n01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:13,860\nYou're doing all that isolation,\ncontaining everything.\n\n1674\n01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:15,490\nWell, now you gotta go back and track.\n\n1675\n01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:19,750\nAfter you contain it, one of the next\nsteps is going through and tracking\n\n1676\n01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:24,290\nwhatever's still coming in back to its\nsource to see where it's flowing from.\n\n1677\n01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:25,372\n>> Right.\n\n1678\n01:34:25,372 --> 01:34:27,480\nAll right, so we got a couple\ndifferent tools we can use.\n\n1679\n01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:30,790\nAnd there's others out there of course\nthat'll let you trace those emails.\n\n1680\n01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:34,950\n>> And to round things off, I know we\nhave a couple statutes in the U.S.\n\n1681\n01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:38,350\nthat deal with email crimes.\n\n1682\n01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:42,854\n>> Yeah, one of them we brought up\nearlier was the Canned Spam Act.\n\n1683\n01:34:42,854 --> 01:34:47,712\nThat was something that\nwas brought into law\n\n1684\n01:34:47,712 --> 01:34:52,307\nnot too long ago, not in computer terms,\n\n1685\n01:34:52,307 --> 01:34:57,335\nit was maybe about ten\nyears ago I want to say.\n\n1686\n01:34:57,335 --> 01:35:02,050\nBut it's one that deals specifically\n\n1687\n01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:06,392\nwith mass unsolicited emails,\nthe definition of spam.\n\n1688\n01:35:06,392 --> 01:35:13,970\nIt was the Congress here decided\nthat enough was enough and\n\n1689\n01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:20,820\nthey put this on the books to\nspecifically deal with spam.\n\n1690\n01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:26,882\nBut prior to this there really wasn't\na hard and fast way to deal with spam.\n\n1691\n01:35:26,882 --> 01:35:33,100\nThey were using stuff like\ntheft of services laws.\n\n1692\n01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:37,400\nThey were using wire fraud,\n\n1693\n01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:42,930\nmisuse or abuse of a computer system,\nthey were using kinda that one and\n\n1694\n01:35:42,930 --> 01:35:46,860\nthere were some clarifications on that.\n\n1695\n01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:51,663\nThey were trying to use harassment at one\npoint, there was all sorts of things.\n\n1696\n01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:53,324\n>> Right.\n>> And I remember people trying\n\n1697\n01:35:53,324 --> 01:35:57,148\nto say I'm gonna sue these spammers\nbecause they're filling my inbox, and\n\n1698\n01:35:57,148 --> 01:36:01,109\nthis is when people are paying for\nbandwidth and dial-up and stuff like that.\n\n1699\n01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:05,776\nThey were saying I have to download\nthis stuff, I'm paying for that, for\n\n1700\n01:36:05,776 --> 01:36:09,932\nall those bits I have to download,\nI'm gonna sue whoever did it.\n\n1701\n01:36:09,932 --> 01:36:14,636\n>> It sounds nice in fantasy land,\nbut that's never ever gonna do it, so\n\n1702\n01:36:14,636 --> 01:36:19,260\nyou find the guy, and then you gotta\nreally prove all that stuff, and\n\n1703\n01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,196\nthere really wasn't a way.\n\n1704\n01:36:21,196 --> 01:36:25,955\nCAN-SPAM came out and\nstarted changing that situation so\n\n1705\n01:36:25,955 --> 01:36:28,576\nit's not the end of the issue but\n\n1706\n01:36:28,576 --> 01:36:33,817\nit was one of the first major things\nthat came out here in the US and\n\n1707\n01:36:33,817 --> 01:36:38,370\nthey've been successful at\ncatching people with it.\n\n1708\n01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:41,040\nIt's not applied all the time,\nbut has been caught.\n\n1709\n01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,850\nThe FBI has caught some people on it,\nas has the Secret Service, too.\n\n1710\n01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:47,920\n>> Yeah it's really one of those cases\nwhere sometimes the law takes a little\n\n1711\n01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:52,370\ntime to catch with us and we don't have\na law that covers that specific thing now.\n\n1712\n01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:55,130\nThat's one of the things\nthat canned spam brought in.\n\n1713\n01:36:55,130 --> 01:36:59,610\nWas now giving us some way,\nsomehow we can now take them to court and\n\n1714\n01:36:59,610 --> 01:37:01,520\nhave some leg to stand on.\n\n1715\n01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:05,900\nOther than try to make something up\nlike harassment or something like that.\n\n1716\n01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:07,700\n>> Yeah, the stuff they had before,\nlike I said, just didn't fit,\n\n1717\n01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:09,590\nthis really fit and.\n\n1718\n01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,350\nThey bolstered that\nposition even since then.\n\n1719\n01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:17,120\nThey've put other things on top of that\nto kind of make it more effective.\n\n1720\n01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:21,410\nPeople are monkeying around and\nsending garbage all around.\n\n1721\n01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:26,350\nThen they've boosted this\nlegislation up with other\n\n1722\n01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:30,310\ndeals on top of everything else.\n\n1723\n01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:35,950\n>> And then we got the two UFCs,\nthe US codes there that deal with,\n\n1724\n01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:39,730\none was the 2252A, and\nI've got to pull it up.\n\n1725\n01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:40,835\nI don't have this stuff memorized.\n\n1726\n01:37:40,835 --> 01:37:42,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was the one that dealt with\n\n1727\n01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:47,250\nmaterial constituting or\ncontaining child pornography and\n\n1728\n01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:54,300\nthen the B is the 2252B,\nmisleading domain names on the Internet.\n\n1729\n01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:55,120\n>> Yeah.\n\n1730\n01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:55,870\nThink about that.\n\n1731\n01:37:55,870 --> 01:38:01,580\nMisleading domain names, so if someone\ntries to spoof it or something like that,\n\n1732\n01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:06,282\nthat is actually something that can\nbe considered to be prosecutable.\n\n1733\n01:38:06,282 --> 01:38:07,250\nAll right.\n\n1734\n01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:10,373\nSo all of you got lawsuits\nto file when you get back-\n\n1735\n01:38:10,373 --> 01:38:11,011\n>> Yeah!\n\n1736\n01:38:11,011 --> 01:38:12,856\n[LAUGH]\n>> Home tonight and so [LAUGH]\n\n1737\n01:38:12,856 --> 01:38:13,986\n>> I'll give you guys a couple links back\n\n1738\n01:38:13,986 --> 01:38:16,247\nthere to-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1739\n01:38:16,247 --> 01:38:17,323\n>> I like Cornell Law,\n\n1740\n01:38:17,323 --> 01:38:20,420\nthey're just tough as Rell Whitman and\nwell laid-out.\n\n1741\n01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:24,590\nSo a couple laws that can help us in the\nevent our investigation leads us to email,\n\n1742\n01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:27,590\nand we find evidence of a crime in there.\n\n1743\n01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:30,340\nWe now have laws in the US, and I'm sure\nin other countries you've got your own\n\n1744\n01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:34,690\nlaws that will allow you to then\nhopefully successfully prosecute.\n\n1745\n01:38:34,690 --> 01:38:38,270\n>> Yeah, and you're looking at,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong,\n\n1746\n01:38:38,270 --> 01:38:42,668\nA also deals with stuff outside of\ndistribution of child pornography.\n\n1747\n01:38:42,668 --> 01:38:46,049\nIt's also if you distribute\ncontent to a minor,\n\n1748\n01:38:46,049 --> 01:38:51,823\nthat might be considered to be corrupting\na minor, like if someone took a picture,\n\n1749\n01:38:51,823 --> 01:38:57,762\nan adult took a picture of themselves in a\ncompromising position, sent it to a minor,\n\n1750\n01:38:57,762 --> 01:39:02,876\nor distributed pornography to a minor,\nor something under those lines,\n\n1751\n01:39:02,876 --> 01:39:08,850\nthat can also be covered in that too, and\nI think that provision's in there, too..\n\n1752\n01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:09,470\n>> I think that as well.\n\n1753\n01:39:09,470 --> 01:39:13,190\nI'm trying to read it as fast as I can,\nbut absolutely.\n\n1754\n01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:15,006\nAnd then what else?\n\n1755\n01:39:15,006 --> 01:39:19,769\nYeah, so primarily child pornography and\nanything that's kind of\n\n1756\n01:39:19,769 --> 01:39:24,512\nmisleading like that,\nwhere you are trying to corrupt a minor.\n\n1757\n01:39:24,512 --> 01:39:29,610\n>> Yeah, so those ones are ones I mean,\nthat obviously though the subject matter\n\n1758\n01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:35,250\nand what they, it's not something\nanyone's comfortable talking about.\n\n1759\n01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:39,340\nBut thankfully they've put laws\nout there that are being more\n\n1760\n01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:42,470\nstringent on dealing with this type\nof stuff in electronic media, and\n\n1761\n01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:44,470\nthey're pretty aggressive\nat these things too.\n\n1762\n01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:48,860\nThat's one section of the law\nstuff dealing with minors and\n\n1763\n01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:52,430\nyou're not even talking about\nthe child pornography stuff,\n\n1764\n01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:56,770\nyou're talking about any\nsort of corrupting of them,\n\n1765\n01:39:56,770 --> 01:40:00,990\nany sort of that solicitation anything\nlike that, or your email, where you're\n\n1766\n01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:06,310\nusing email as your instrument to commit\nthat crime, that's not the only one and\n\n1767\n01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:10,382\nlike I said, they're very aggressive\nat prosecuting these things.\n\n1768\n01:40:10,382 --> 01:40:13,270\n>> All right.\n>> They will call forensic investigators\n\n1769\n01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:14,860\nin all the time.\n\n1770\n01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:18,620\nIf you've ever seen them go and set up the\nsting operations and stuff like that for\n\n1771\n01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:22,410\npeople like that, they have forensic techs\nthat are pulling this out verifying it,\n\n1772\n01:40:22,410 --> 01:40:23,650\nsaying boom here you go.\n\n1773\n01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:25,250\nThey got all the records they need and\n\n1774\n01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:28,730\nthey are applying laws like\nthis to do it and others.\n\n1775\n01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:30,670\nSo, there you go.\n\n1776\n01:40:31,702 --> 01:40:34,890\n>> All right, well Sean we've covered a\nlot of ground here today in this episode.\n\n1777\n01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:37,102\nWe talked a lot about emails, primarily.\n\n1778\n01:40:37,102 --> 01:40:42,020\nAnd if emails are part of a crime,\nor support the evidence of a crime,\n\n1779\n01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:45,670\nthen we have to be able to get in there,\ntalk about how we need warrants in certain\n\n1780\n01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:49,800\ncases, different tools we can\nuse to examine headers and\n\n1781\n01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:53,980\nemails themselves and trace them through\ntheir path as they're getting delivered.\n\n1782\n01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,650\nSo, a lot of good information.\n\n1783\n01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:58,059\nAnything else we want to\nadd into our email episode?\n\n1784\n01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:02,870\n>> I think we've covered quite\na bit of ground here with this.\n\n1785\n01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:07,180\nWe've talked kind of generically\nabout email systems.\n\n1786\n01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:12,990\nNow comes the part where you\nhave to apply all this guidance,\n\n1787\n01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:17,210\nsuch as it is, to whatever e-mail system\nyour investigating or whatever system you\n\n1788\n01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:21,790\ncurrently work with that you could\nbe investigating down the road.\n\n1789\n01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:24,390\nYou'll have to get the specifics of that.\n\n1790\n01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:28,950\nTry some of these tools ahead of time\nto see if they will actually do what\n\n1791\n01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:32,380\nthey're supposed to and you're comfortable\nwith what they're doing in your situation.\n\n1792\n01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:36,940\nYou don't want to find that out at\nthe last moment when you're doing that.\n\n1793\n01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:38,332\nIt brings back garbage.\n\n1794\n01:41:38,332 --> 01:41:42,430\nYou wanna be able to have\nconfidence that it's working.\n\n1795\n01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:43,970\nSo try some of these things, and\n\n1796\n01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:46,360\nspecifically tools like\nthis with the mail systems.\n\n1797\n01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:52,870\nBecause there seems to be a reasonable\namount of disagreement in this area.\n\n1798\n01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:56,080\nMore than there are in other areas, so\n\n1799\n01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,810\nthere's disagreements on\nwhat tools are the best.\n\n1800\n01:41:57,810 --> 01:41:58,800\nEveryone's got their favorite.\n\n1801\n01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,840\nBut there seems to be disagreement here.\n\n1802\n01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:05,340\nAnd then also remember, we're not just\ntalking current messaging systems.\n\n1803\n01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:08,670\nYou may have to go back\nto something that existed\n\n1804\n01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:12,420\nsome point in the past is no\nlonger supported by your company.\n\n1805\n01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:16,290\nRemember some of these things,\nthe statute of limitations is quite long.\n\n1806\n01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:17,473\nAnd some situations,\n\n1807\n01:42:17,473 --> 01:42:21,091\nthe statute of limitations is,\nthere is no statute of limitations.\n\n1808\n01:42:21,091 --> 01:42:24,030\nCertain crimes, like murder would be one.\n\n1809\n01:42:24,030 --> 01:42:27,060\nThere is no statute of limitations,\nwell at least here in the US.\n\n1810\n01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:30,030\nI don't know if it is that\nway in other countries.\n\n1811\n01:42:30,030 --> 01:42:34,040\nbut there's no statue of limitations on\nthat so if you're investigating those\n\n1812\n01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:39,450\nsorts of things, you may be going\nafter something that was 20 years old.\n\n1813\n01:42:39,450 --> 01:42:41,697\nWho knows?\nI haven't seen a tool for Compuserve yet.\n\n1814\n01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:43,335\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So who knows.\n\n1815\n01:42:43,335 --> 01:42:44,055\nMaybe there's out there.\n\n1816\n01:42:44,055 --> 01:42:50,900\nA prodigy or something like that,\nso that's something to think about.\n\n1817\n01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:53,120\n>> Ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for today.\n\n1818\n01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:53,997\nHope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n1819\n01:42:53,997 -->

morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening.\n\n5\n00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:37,440\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,390\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriano.\n\n7\n00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,720\nHow you doing today Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,230\n>> I'm pretty good.\n\n9\n00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:42,920\nHow about you?\n\n10\n00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,980\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,380\nWe got another episode of our\ndigital forensic investigator series\n\n12\n00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,620\ncoming your way.\n\n13\n00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,910\nIn this one we're going to be talking\nabout recovering deleted files and\n\n14\n00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,290\ndeleted partitions, a big part of\nour forensic investigation because,\n\n15\n00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,625\npeople usually try to cover their tracks,\nright?\n\n16\n00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,380\n>> [LAUGH] Yes they do.\n\n17\n00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,180\nEither wittingly or\nunwittingly they'll try to do that, and\n\n18\n00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,970\nit's our job to get it back\nfrom even the worst conditions.\n\n19\n00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,690\nAnd you'll find out a lot of\nthings you'd think were possible,\n\n20\n00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,690\nare actually possible.\n\n21\n00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,500\n>> It is.\n\n22\n00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,822\nSometimes we can perform\nmagic on these hard drives.\n\n23\n00:01:18,822 --> 00:01:20,751\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We get a lot of information back.\n\n24\n00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:22,500\n>> All right, so where do we start Sean.\n\n25\n00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,960\nI guess the first thing we need to talk\nabout it, when we delete something,\n\n26\n00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,470\nwhat is actually happening?\n\n27\n00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,560\nBehind the sense because\nunderstanding that process,\n\n28\n00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,580\nis really what makes recovering\nthis information possible.\n\n29\n00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,190\n>> Yeah, we have to understand that,\nwhat's happening there when you delete\n\n30\n00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,990\na file, the average Joe just thinks boom,\nyou delete a file.\n\n31\n00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,850\nAnd it's gone.\n\n32\n00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,560\nNowadays it's trained to go\ninto the Recycle Bin, and\n\n33\n00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,050\nthey could just bring it\nback out of there, but\n\n34\n00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,610\nthey don't give much thought to what\nhappens after they delete something,\n\n35\n00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,520\nit's not in Recycle Bin, or, on the other\noperating systems, it just gone.\n\n36\n00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,249\nThey think I can't see it, therefore\nit doesn't exist anymore, and I'm fine.\n\n37\n00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,280\nThey've gotten used to that\nRecycle Bin recovery stuff like that.\n\n38\n00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,150\nBut not as much as they think.\n\n39\n00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,770\nBut people do have a little bit higher,\nI guess,\n\n40\n00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,480\nthan they used to, because you see a lot\nof people understanding that there\n\n41\n00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,390\nare file recovery, data recovery services,\nthat can get stuff back.\n\n42\n00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,010\nBut there's still even kind\nof a misunderstanding there.\n\n43\n00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,620\nI don't know about you Mike, but I have\nseen a lot of people that have thought\n\n44\n00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,360\nabout file recovery,\nthey don't even do backups or anything.\n\n45\n00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,545\nLike if anything ever fails.\n\n46\n00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:40,115\nJust had a file recovering.\n\n47\n00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:44,045\nIt's only like a 100 bucks or\nsomething to go get that.\n\n48\n00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:45,285\nIt's a lot more expensive.\n\n49\n00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:47,285\n>> You really do see both ends\nof the spectrum out there.\n\n50\n00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:51,305\nSome people just think when a file's\ndeleted if I've emptied the Recycle Bin,\n\n51\n00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,735\nit's gone forever and\nyou're never gonna get it back.\n\n52\n00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:56,315\nOther people, typically people that\nhave dealt with a problem like this;\n\n53\n00:02:56,315 --> 00:03:00,870\nthey've had to have somebody recover some\npictures or recover a file for them.\n\n54\n00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,280\nThat they have accidentally deleted,\n\n55\n00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,060\nand now they start to think that\neverything is recoverable and I should be\n\n56\n00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,760\nable to get everything back anytime\nI want whether it's deleted or not.\n\n57\n00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,160\nWhich is not the case either, right.\n\n58\n00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,242\nSo it falls somewhere in between there.\n\n59\n00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:17,840\nIt's like,we can get some of that\ninformation back hopefully all of it but\n\n60\n00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,530\nnot possible all the time.\n\n61\n00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,470\nWe might be recovering fragments of files,\n\n62\n00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,770\nor pieces of files, that we can try to put\nback together, try to make sense out of.\n\n63\n00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,320\n>> Yes, there's really some\nfascinating stuff you could do.\n\n64\n00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,940\nBut, nothing is really truly gone forever\non a hard drive on most hard drives.\n\n65\n00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,510\nExcept under certain conditions and\n\n66\n00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,230\nso, this would give you an appreciation\nof the whole situation overall.\n\n67\n00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,300\nI can pretty much guarantee that for\n\n68\n00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,200\na lot of you, you'll be oh I had\nno idea that you could do that.\n\n69\n00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,995\nSo, we're gonna take\na look at those things.\n\n70\n00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:55,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And tell you what's actually happening\n\n71\n00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,430\nand why these things\nare possible to recover stuff.\n\n72\n00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,450\nFor an investigative purpose.\n\n73\n00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,240\n>> All right, so let's start out\non our traditional hard drives,\n\n74\n00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,140\nour magnetic based hard drives,\nour good old spinning platters.\n\n75\n00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,110\nWhen we write a file to the hard drive,\nthose ones and\n\n76\n00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,440\nzeroes get written in those\nclusters on that hard drive.\n\n77\n00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,660\nWe've got a file allocation table.\n\n78\n00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,950\nThat basically tells us where\nthe beginning of that file is.\n\n79\n00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,880\nAnd if that file has been\nfragmented on the hard drive,\n\n80\n00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,230\nwhere the other pieces start as well.\n\n81\n00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,270\nSo that when you go to\ndouble click on that file,\n\n82\n00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,470\nit can read that file allocation table,\nlocate the files on those platters.\n\n83\n00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,170\nPut it back together and\nmake a file for you.\n\n84\n00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,740\nSo when I delete a file,\nwhat's going on in my system back there?\n\n85\n00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,580\n>> Yeah.\nWhen a file is deleted, all it does is\n\n86\n00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,550\ndepending on the file system you're\nusing and some other conditions, it will\n\n87\n00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,190\nput a special character and insert that as\nthe first character of a file name, and\n\n88\n00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,540\nthat is gonna tell the system\nthat that's available for use.\n\n89\n00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,130\nIt's not necessarily\nimmediately gonna use it,\n\n90\n00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,960\nit's just gonna say, hey,\nthis is here if you want it, and\n\n91\n00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,420\nonce that's done, it makes an entry\nin the file occasion table.\n\n92\n00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,270\nOr there's another one, NTFS side the MFT.\n\n93\n00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,190\nIt's the equivalent Master File Table.\n\n94\n00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,210\nIt does the same sort of thing.\n\n95\n00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,360\nIt tells you where things are on there.\n\n96\n00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,385\nSo it marks the spaces\nbeing available itself.\n\n97\n00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:25,085\nAnd then it puts the entries\nin the appropriate\n\n98\n00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:27,395\nmapping that says hey\nyou can use these space.\n\n99\n00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:31,115\nTells everybody where they are, and\nthen it's up for grabs at that point.\n\n100\n00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:35,215\nWhen something needs it, and\nthere's no other place to put it or\n\n101\n00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:36,255\nthat's an ideal place.\n\n102\n00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:39,065\nIt's gonna start putting\nstuff in those spaces.\n\n103\n00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:41,675\n>> Yeah.\nSo as we delete files it marks that space\n\n104\n00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,660\nas available.\n\n105\n00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,510\nIt does move if we're\nusing the Recycle Bin,\n\n106\n00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,070\nif the operating system\nhas something like that.\n\n107\n00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,870\nIn Windows we've got the Recycle Bin.\n\n108\n00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,010\nSo as long as you're not doing the shift\ndelete which bypasses your Recycle Bin,\n\n109\n00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,240\nputs that copy of the file\nin that Recycle Bin and\n\n110\n00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,930\nthen, as you said,\nthe space is marked as available.\n\n111\n00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,230\nSo the next time you do a write\noperation that might or\n\n112\n00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,060\nmight not, that space might or\nmight not get used.\n\n113\n00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,330\nFor that next bright operation, depending\non what other space is available.\n\n114\n00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,860\nThere's a time there\nwhen the file's deleted,\n\n115\n00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,950\nit's still intact on my hard drive, right?\n\n116\n00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,080\nAnd as we write more and\nmore stuff to the hard drive,\n\n117\n00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,660\nthe chances of it being\noverwritten increase.\n\n118\n00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,500\nIt depends on how long ago it was deleted.\n\n119\n00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,830\nThat might have an impact on how\nmuch of that file, if at all,\n\n120\n00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,210\nthat we're able to recover.\n\n121\n00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,900\nBut that is the first thing we need to\nunderstand is when you delete a file,\n\n122\n00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,240\nit does not go in and write ones or\nzeroes across that space.\n\n123\n00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,059\nAll it does is hide it from\nthe operating system basically.\n\n124\n00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:38,870\nAnd mark it as available again.\n\n125\n00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,447\n>> Yeah, that's the thing, that's item\nnumber one you have to understand,\n\n126\n00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:47,879\nis that, it doesn't go away just because\nyou hit that delete key or you hit\n\n127\n00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,710\nthe correct key combination and told it\nto bypass the Recycle Bin, it's gone.\n\n128\n00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,900\nYou can do that.\n\n129\n00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,370\nYou can tell Windows,\njust bypass the Recycle Bin.\n\n130\n00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,440\nGet rid of it.\n\n131\n00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,240\nBut it's still just marking\nthe space as available.\n\n132\n00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,400\nThe only difference is it's not\nputting it in a Recycle Bin first.\n\n133\n00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,800\nIt's just bypassing that.\n\n134\n00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,920\nIt's not gone forever.\n\n135\n00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,710\nThere's still a time where\nyou can pick this up.\n\n136\n00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,640\nIt's also, by the way,\nthis is one of the reasons why,\n\n137\n00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,670\nif you haven't already\npicked up on it previously.\n\n138\n00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,510\nThis is why when you go to a live system,\nyou don't just go and\n\n139\n00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,870\ndo the normal shut down process and\nstart tampering with things.\n\n140\n00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,680\nCuz if there are or this is one of\nthe reasons, if there are deleted\n\n141\n00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,070\nfiles on there, just doing the shutdown\nprocess, when it's doing its cleanup and\n\n142\n00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,090\nputting stuff on the disk and closing it,\nit could very well overwrite those spots.\n\n143\n00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,430\nYou want to prevent that.\n\n144\n00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,522\nSo I yank the cord, and poof,\nit doesn't do any of that type of stuff.\n\n145\n00:07:42,522 --> 00:07:45,699\n>> Yeah, cuz like Windows, for\nexample, has scheduled tasks that do\n\n146\n00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:49,212\ndefragmentation periodically, so\nit could be doing that, it could start\n\n147\n00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:52,835\ncompacting files and taking that empty\nspace that, you can think of it like,\n\n148\n00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:56,235\nI always think of it when you delete\na file you're making holes, right,\n\n149\n00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:59,469\nin the space that's already used on\nthat hard drive And when you write\n\n150\n00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:02,975\nsomething else, you really kinda going\nback and filling in those holes.\n\n151\n00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:04,960\nAnd disk defragmentation\nis doing the same thing.\n\n152\n00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,962\nIt's just compacting up and\nremoving those blanks in the hard drive or\n\n153\n00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:13,370\njust making a more efficient\nuse of that space.\n\n154\n00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,520\nSo we gotta be really careful.\n\n155\n00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,870\nAnything we do that might cause\na write to the hard drive or\n\n156\n00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,130\njust letting the operating system sit\nthere and do it's normal thing could\n\n157\n00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,630\nend up wiping out some of that\nof recoverable information.\n\n158\n00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,430\nSo with the mechanical hard drives\ninto the magnetic hard drives,\n\n159\n00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,830\nhowever you want to call a lot of people,\nI don't know.\n\n160\n00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,170\nStandard or mechanical or magnetic.\n\n161\n00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,550\n>> I used to call them Winchester.\n\n162\n00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,970\nTechnically that's correct but\nisn't that a rifle.\n\n163\n00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,150\nI didn't know.\n\n164\n00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,420\nSo I'm like a traditional and\nthey kinda get the idea.\n\n165\n00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,300\n>> Yeah, we'll say magnetic\nplatter based hard drives.\n\n166\n00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,760\nBecause we have other hard drive types\nout there now and this other hard drive\n\n167\n00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,290\ntype changes the game when it comes\nto what we just talked about.\n\n168\n00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,330\n>> Yes, that is the big one that\nis kind of sitting there in\n\n169\n00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,970\nthe room that we mentioned at the\nbeginning of this whole journey through\n\n170\n00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,080\nthe forensic investigator but we haven't\nbrought back into the mix yet and\n\n171\n00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,650\nthat is the SSD drive,\nthe solid state drive.\n\n172\n00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,750\nWhat do you do with those and\nthe flash drives for\n\n173\n00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,710\nthat matter because they would\nbe part of this as well.\n\n174\n00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,080\nWhat do you do when you need\nto recover data off those?\n\n175\n00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,350\nDoes that impact the process at all?\n\n176\n00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,270\nWell, it does and it doesn't.\n\n177\n00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,530\nIt really all depends on how you\nlook at it at the physical level,\n\n178\n00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,690\nSSD's are definitely different.\n\n179\n00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,270\nThey're not the same technology.\n\n180\n00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,440\nThere's a bunch of chips in there,\nthat it's storing this stuff on.\n\n181\n00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,210\nWe could just simplify it to that.\n\n182\n00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,700\nIt doesn't have that disk\nthat's spinning around, and\n\n183\n00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,380\nit's changing magnetic fields or\nparticles on there.\n\n184\n00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,220\nThat doesn't happen that way.\n\n185\n00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:52,980\nSo that does have an impact on some\nof the far recovery things we do and\n\n186\n00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,280\nalso the way it deletes and\nwrites stuff to an SSD drive.\n\n187\n00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,020\nAlso it's going to have a huge impact\non how you can do file recovery off\n\n188\n00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,830\nof a solid state drive.\n\n189\n00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,960\nWhat it kind of comes down to is,\nis the data, if you delete the data,\n\n190\n00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,030\nis it still, does it still exist\non the drive at that point or\n\n191\n00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,520\nhas it been cleaned off by\nstuff like trim operations?\n\n192\n00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,540\nAnd right leveling,\nstuff like that is done on solid state but\n\n193\n00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:31,375\nis not done on our spinning\ndisk your platter one you said.\n\n194\n00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:35,630\n[LAUGH] It's just not done on those,\nit's done on SSD.\n\n195\n00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,570\nSo those trims get that\nclean up stuff run and\n\n196\n00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,330\nkind of a block operation, or this right\n\n197\n00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,565\nleveling deal can really throw a monkey\nwrench into your forensics process.\n\n198\n00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,895\nBut if those files are deleted but\n\n199\n00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:57,485\nstill there, it's just a traditional image\nbecause you have the same file system.\n\n200\n00:10:57,485 --> 00:11:02,245\nThat's a logical level thing though\nyou could still image the drive and\n\n201\n00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,105\nthen do file recovery on that and\nnot have a problem.\n\n202\n00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:09,665\nNow if you have a situation where it's\ndone a trim, then you may be stuck with\n\n203\n00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:13,790\na process we're gonna talk about\nlater on called file carving.\n\n204\n00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,320\nAnd that's something that you can\nuse on traditional drives too, and\n\n205\n00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,540\nwe'll get more into file carving later on.\n\n206\n00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,930\nBut yes, there are some differences on\nsolid state that will cause you problems,\n\n207\n00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,280\nyou know, when you try to recover it.\n\n208\n00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,290\nIt's basically, like I said,\nis the stuff still there?\n\n209\n00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,210\nOr has the drive done its\nown internal clean-up?\n\n210\n00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,870\nOr has the operating system sent a\nclean-up request to do stuff to the drive?\n\n211\n00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,300\nYeah could you imagine something\ncalled right leveling I think?\n\n212\n00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,770\nWhere with the solid state drives there;s\nthe issue of how they can only take so\n\n213\n00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,540\nmany reads or so many writes I should\nsay to the different addresses.\n\n214\n00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,900\nSo it's not like a mechanical drive\nwhere I want everything compacted up\n\n215\n00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,080\nto the front of that drive because\nthat's the fastest part of the drive\n\n216\n00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,070\nwith solid state, it really doesn't\nmatter where that data is on the drive.\n\n217\n00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,300\nRight?\nIt's not quite the same operation.\n\n218\n00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,080\nWe're just reading an address.\n\n219\n00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,670\nSo what it'll do is it'll move\nthings around in the background.\n\n220\n00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,340\nIt'll say, look,\nthis section of these bits have\n\n221\n00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,710\nbeen written to more times\nthan these over here.\n\n222\n00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,590\nSo we'll start writing some\nstuff over here which then\n\n223\n00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,390\ncould end up over-writing files\nthat have been recently deleted.\n\n224\n00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,020\nSo we've got that as you said\nwe've got that trim process.\n\n225\n00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:26,140\n>> In a software file, also in\na solid state one, to fit into that\n\n226\n00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,700\nthe way you're approaching it is because\nof the way solid state works, the right\n\n227\n00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,570\nleveling, physically and\nlogically you may have this block and\n\n228\n00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,340\nthis logical address pairing up,\nbut because right leveling.\n\n229\n00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,760\nIt may all of a sudden, the filesystem may\nsay well that block exists over here with\n\n230\n00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,200\nthe same address, but\nit's a different physical block.\n\n231\n00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,820\nNow if your file and\ndata is sitting over here, and\n\n232\n00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,430\nyou're going to this physical one\nwith the same logical address.\n\n233\n00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,060\nIt's not there.\n\n234\n00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,940\nSo that causes a whole other\nlevel of concern there that\n\n235\n00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,970\nyou're gonna have to deal with and\nlike I said, if the stuff is still\n\n236\n00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:12,270\nthere usually a traditional image\nprocess will catch and it's no problem.\n\n237\n00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,150\nBut if it's stuff that you have\nto add a physical layer on,\n\n238\n00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,330\nwhich there are some techniques that you\nmay have to do that then be prepared for\n\n239\n00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,970\nsome real problems, or be prepared for\nthe fact that you ain't getting anything.\n\n240\n00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,240\nThat can maybe the name of the game is\nthose techniques you have honed and\n\n241\n00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,070\nused for years traditional drives.\n\n242\n00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,720\nMay not work on a solid state and\ntherefore, you know, you may expect to get\n\n243\n00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,590\ndata over here with those techniques, but\nover here you're getting nothing, so you\n\n244\n00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,540\nmay have to get used to the fact you're\nnot getting anything over here at all.\n\n245\n00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,810\n>> Yeah, because again,\nit's stored differently, right?\n\n246\n00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,350\nWe're talking about electronically storing\nthe data rather than magnetically.\n\n247\n00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,110\nRemember, SSD, it's electronic.\n\n248\n00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,290\nWe've got registers in there to\nstore those it requires electricity,\n\n249\n00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,910\na little bit of power\nto keep that in there.\n\n250\n00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,720\nSo when you delete something, you can\nturn the power off to those bits or\n\n251\n00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,760\nthose particular addresses, and\nthen we could end up, the data goes away.\n\n252\n00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,300\nIt's not like it has to be overwritten\nlike it does on a mechanical drive you\n\n253\n00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,170\ndon't have that memory like we\ndo with the magnetic drives.\n\n254\n00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,590\nAll right, so solid state's gonna cause\na little bit of difference in maybe\n\n255\n00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,580\nthe way we go about it, but as you said,\nonce I create that image of that data,\n\n256\n00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,770\nI work with that image of the data\njust like I would any other image and\n\n257\n00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,300\nthen back to the recycle bin.\n\n258\n00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,580\nWe've kind of talked about\nhow that works already.\n\n259\n00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,880\n>> We talked about maybe the user space,\n\n260\n00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,160\nis the way to call it, how the day to day\nuser is going to see the recycle bin work.\n\n261\n00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,850\nYou delete something, it says that\nit keeps a copy of that file in\n\n262\n00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,100\nthe recycle bin for\na period of time until you clean it up or\n\n263\n00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,350\nthat first in first out type thing,\nand we'll start getting rid of things.\n\n264\n00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,620\nBut that's the user space\nside that people see,\n\n265\n00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,750\nthat they've been doing since Windows 95.\n\n266\n00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,640\nThey just click and drag a file\nout of here, or right click and\n\n267\n00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,750\nrestore and it goes right back\nto where it was previously.\n\n268\n00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,620\nThe question here is how\ndoes it know to do that?\n\n269\n00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,320\nWhat's the technical\nmechanism behind the scenes?\n\n270\n00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,250\nWell, a big part of the process of marking\n\n271\n00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:26,010\na file deleted and know where it was is\na file they called the info file it is\n\n272\n00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:31,070\nliterally called that and it's part of the\nRecycle Bin and has been for a long time.\n\n273\n00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,950\nAnd that keeps track of what the file is,\nwhere it is stored and\n\n274\n00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,170\nwhere it is suppose to be located.\n\n275\n00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,490\nSo all those little pieces that\nknow where those things reside and\n\n276\n00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,870\nknows where to put it if it's\never requested to put that back.\n\n277\n00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,721\nSo that's the key thing.\n\n278\n00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:51,384\nIt's also why if you've ever deleted files\non a system and you wanna get them out of\n\n279\n00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:55,710\nrecycle bin, and all of sudden recycle\nbin gives you some weird message, or\n\n280\n00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,629\nyou open it up and there's nothing\nthere The info file is usually a big\n\n281\n00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:02,938\npart of that because the info\nfile gets damaged or is gone,\n\n282\n00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:07,194\nrecycle bin is just, there's nothing here,\ndoesn't know what to do, or\n\n283\n00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:10,975\nit gives a message saying it's full or\nthere is something wrong.\n\n284\n00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:17,200\nYou'll know if it says it's full or if\nthere is a certain problem accessing it.\n\n285\n00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,590\nYou'll know if it's the full operation or\nsomething along those lines if you\n\n286\n00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,920\nright click on the recycle bin and\nit's full, and it's all grayed out.\n\n287\n00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,900\nBecause it's saying hey empty it,\nand it's grayed out.\n\n288\n00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,770\nWell, how am I supposed to do that?\n\n289\n00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,970\nInfo file is gone.\n\n290\n00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,850\nFortunately, you can use some of these\nother file recovery utilities, and\n\n291\n00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,620\nthere are some techniques if\nyou look at Microsoft tech net,\n\n292\n00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,730\nthat you can use to\nrebuild that info file.\n\n293\n00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,230\nSo you can use Microsoft's method, or you\ncan use some of the utilities that we've\n\n294\n00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,330\neither mentioned previously in some of\nthe ones in the email system will do that,\n\n295\n00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,700\nand some of the tools we're gonna mention\nhere that are also in the email stuff,\n\n296\n00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,860\nwe'll do the same thing.\n\n297\n00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,380\n>> Okay.\n\n298\n00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,390\nAll right, so we've got that recycle bin,\nand heck, maybe we'll get lucky and\n\n299\n00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,320\nit's still in the recycle bin and\nwe can get it from there.\n\n300\n00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,920\nOtherwise we're using our tools that we\ncan try to bring back these deleted files.\n\n301\n00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,290\n>> Do you know that's a common thing,\nby the way?\n\n302\n00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,460\nThat people will delete something,\nleave it in the recycle bin.\n\n303\n00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,386\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> And not even think about\n\n304\n00:17:13,386 --> 00:17:14,330\ngetting it out of there.\n\n305\n00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,410\n>> Yeah, there's many.\n\n306\n00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can look at cases of guys that have\n\n307\n00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:25,280\ndone for, engaged in investigations that\nhave found stuff left in the Recycle Bin.\n\n308\n00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,435\nThat someone deleted them saying,\nI got one over on the police,\n\n309\n00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:31,100\nthey'll never catch me, my clever plan-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n310\n00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,449\n>> Succeeded and it's like yeah,\n\n311\n00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:34,320\nhere it is.\n\n312\n00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:36,785\n>> [LAUGH] Right-click, restore.\n\n313\n00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:37,670\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n314\n00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,910\n>> I mean, don't do that as\na forensic investigator, right.\n\n315\n00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,950\nWe don't want to do the restore,\nnot on the original thing.\n\n316\n00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,580\nYes.\n\n317\n00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,950\nSo that would be nice,\nbut not always the case.\n\n318\n00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,800\nSo we do need to have some\ntools in our arsenal.\n\n319\n00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,930\nThat we can use to go in and\nstart recovering these files.\n\n320\n00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,190\n>> Yes.\nAnd there's a lot of things out here.\n\n321\n00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,940\nSome of the things we've\ntalked about already from\n\n322\n00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,510\nour previous episode on email.\n\n323\n00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,160\nBut we're bringing them back in here.\n\n324\n00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,020\nThere's one like recover my files.\n\n325\n00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,030\nThat was brought up in the email section.\n\n326\n00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,530\nBut then there is other ones like,\n\n327\n00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,156\nI always have problems with this name,\neaseUS, or whatever.\n\n328\n00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:20,560\n>> EasUS, I don't know,\nI will give you guys a link for it and\n\n329\n00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,390\nyou can figure it out for yourself.\n\n330\n00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,441\nI agree with you I am not sure\nwhat they are trying to say.\n\n331\n00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:31,483\nWhen you look at the site E-A-S-U,\nI'm sorry E-A-S-E,\n\n332\n00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:37,670\nis in one color, U-S is another color,\nso ease us or ease US.\n\n333\n00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,560\n>> Ease us.\n>> Anyway, they make good software.\n\n334\n00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,880\nWe just need to be able to pronounce your\nname, so send us a copy of your software,\n\n335\n00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,730\nand we'll demo it on screen, and\nwe'll do it for you [INAUDIBLE].\n\n336\n00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,982\n>> Anyway, several different tools.\n\n337\n00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:51,970\nEase us or\nwhatever they want to call that one.\n\n338\n00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,290\nPC Inspector was another\nI think you mentioned.\n\n339\n00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,180\n>> Yeah, PC Inspector is another\none that does the same type of\n\n340\n00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,710\ndeal with doing file recovery.\n\n341\n00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,840\nSo if you need to go to that next level,\nand keep in mind also by the way,\n\n342\n00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,200\nthere's some things that just\ndon't go in recycle bin, ever.\n\n343\n00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,010\nAnd, those are ones like, if you remember\nway early on in one of our earlier\n\n344\n00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:20,020\nepisodes for this, there was a, those LNK\nfiles from the most recently used menu,\n\n345\n00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,180\nwhen that list gets refreshed and\nyou start using the other stuff more than\n\n346\n00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:29,600\nothers, the order of links don't just\nget deleted and shoved in recycle bin.\n\n347\n00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,410\nThose are in the express lane,\nthose go right to deleted status.\n\n348\n00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,730\nYou don't need to see a bunch\nof link files in there for\n\n349\n00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,470\nstuff that was in your\nmost recently used menu.\n\n350\n00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,470\nSo if your, if someone's deleted files and\ndone something to the drive or\n\n351\n00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,950\nthat file is just gone or\nit was on removable media or\n\n352\n00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,240\nsomething like that,\nyou can recover using one of these tools.\n\n353\n00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,340\nYou can recover a link files and\n\n354\n00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,970\nif you find the right one for\nthe file you're looking for,\n\n355\n00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,750\nyou can actually look at that link and\nsee where the file was.\n\n356\n00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:13,112\nIt's name and other information about it\nis gonna be included in that LNK file.\n\n357\n00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:16,100\nThe file may not be there anymore.\n\n358\n00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,370\nThere's information that tells\nyou that it was there, and\n\n359\n00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:25,280\ntells you enough information about it that\nhey, it existed at one time, you know.\n\n360\n00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,440\nDon't know where it is now,\nbut it's not here.\n\n361\n00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,690\nCould be a way of showing\nif you have a link file.\n\n362\n00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,250\nAnd don't have the actual file, you might\nhave to do a few other things to prove\n\n363\n00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,720\nthis, but it does get you down the road\nof showing that the person may have\n\n364\n00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,880\nengaged in anti-forensics,\nthey're trying to be clever and do things.\n\n365\n00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,160\nSo they delete a file and then they\nmaybe wipe that spot in the drive and\n\n366\n00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,470\nsay I got away with one.\n\n367\n00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,660\nNo, there could be a leaked file out\nthere that now you just recover and\n\n368\n00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:01,465\nsay that file was there and it's not now.\n\n369\n00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:03,865\nSo there's something going on here.\n\n370\n00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:09,185\nThen you could check the drive and\ndo other tests and, say, find a spot\n\n371\n00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:13,485\nin the drive, if you're lucky, that you\ngot all these random patterns out there.\n\n372\n00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:16,765\nAnd then you got a bunch of ones and\nzeroes in a specific pattern that\n\n373\n00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:21,430\nindicates a wipe, that just doesn't look\nin place, then that could say, well yeah.\n\n374\n00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,280\nThere was something there.\n\n375\n00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,760\nIt's very clear it was there and\nyeah, I think it might be that file.\n\n376\n00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,550\n>> Gotcha.\nSo I don't know.\n\n377\n00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,240\nWe wanna keep going through some\nof these different tool advisors,\n\n378\n00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,650\nthere's a lot out there.\n\n379\n00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,250\n>> Yeah.\n\n380\n00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:35,750\nThere's a lot here.\n\n381\n00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,500\nI put a few, Recuva, you put in there.\n\n382\n00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,330\n>> Yep.\n\n383\n00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,200\n>> There's a bunch of them but\nwe can skip down.\n\n384\n00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,300\nI got two on here that I\nthink are really important.\n\n385\n00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,610\nQuick recovery, which was mentioned in\nour email section and Stellar Phoenix.\n\n386\n00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,805\nI told you that was coming back so\nit's risen from the ashes.\n\n387\n00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:55,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sorry.\n\n388\n00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,539\n>> No.\n>> Good one, I liked it.\n\n389\n00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:57,235\nI get it.\n\n390\n00:21:57,235 --> 00:21:59,675\nI get it.\n\n391\n00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:02,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's come back, it's come back again.\n\n392\n00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,130\nAnd reason why I'm bringing these\nthings back, those two tools back into\n\n393\n00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:12,580\nthe mix here,\nthose two tools are two of the many\n\n394\n00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:18,720\ntools that can recover deleted\nfiles from formatted drives.\n\n395\n00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,870\nSo, if someone's gone to that level\nwhere they're like, hey, I formatted it.\n\n396\n00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:27,120\nYou're not getting it, these will\nactually go after it and find things.\n\n397\n00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,130\nthat were on the drive prior\nto its being formatted.\n\n398\n00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,718\n>> Quick data recovery pro,\nI'm gonna try to give them the right link,\n\n399\n00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:37,345\nI believe it's what you're\nreferring to there.\n\n400\n00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:39,850\n>> Do they just have the pro or\ndid they have a,\n\n401\n00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,780\n>> Does that look familiar to you?\n\n402\n00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,710\n>> Yeah, that's it.\n\n403\n00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,500\n>> They do have a basic version and\n\n404\n00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,020\nthen you can buy their full\nfeatured version as well.\n\n405\n00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,750\n>> Yeah, so\nthere's that's quick recovery and\n\n406\n00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,600\nthen you have stellar Phoenix is\nthe other one, which we saw can\n\n407\n00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,560\ndo stuff to recovery emails out\nof a mailbox and stuff like that.\n\n408\n00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,240\nBut it also has some value here.\n\n409\n00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,540\nI mean think about it,\nit's a formatted drive.\n\n410\n00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,830\nHow many years have you been\ntaught that if you format a drive.\n\n411\n00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,600\n>> It's gone.\n\n412\n00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,420\n>> It's donezo forever.\n\n413\n00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,550\n>> Right\n>> That's definitely not the case.\n\n414\n00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,575\nHere you can do what amounts to, sometimes\nyou'll hear this called this, an unformat.\n\n415\n00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:20,410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n416\n00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,530\nthey're just unformatting the drive and\nsaying there we go.\n\n417\n00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,290\nIt's rebuilding all\nthe stuff that was there and\n\n418\n00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,760\nsaying here's the disk as it was.\n\n419\n00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,100\nAnd then you just go through and just\npick the stuff that you want off there.\n\n420\n00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,460\nAnd it's just fascinating.\n\n421\n00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,370\nYou see the look on, you just wanna\nsee the look on some of these\n\n422\n00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,086\npeople's faces when you're\nlike I formatted it,\n\n423\n00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,698\nI formatted [LAUGH] you\nain't getting it back.\n\n424\n00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:43,377\nAnd then [SOUND],\n\n425\n00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:46,492\nyou run these tools and you're just\ncherry picking stuff off the drive now.\n\n426\n00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:47,440\n>> Yeah.\n\n427\n00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,470\nIs this what you were talking about,\nwhen you said you deleted?\n\n428\n00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,920\nYeah.\nIt's still there.\n\n429\n00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,779\n>> Yeah.\n\n430\n00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:56,180\nSo that's just one of\nthe levels you can go to.\n\n431\n00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,839\nWe've got, Recovering deleted\nfiles from the recycle bin.\n\n432\n00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,079\nRecovering deleted files.\n\n433\n00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,883\nAnd now someone's gone to the point\nwhere they formatted a drive and\n\n434\n00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:09,220\nwe have a tool specifically designed\nto take something off those formatted,\n\n435\n00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,370\nto recover stuff off\na drive that was formatted.\n\n436\n00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,020\nYou know, maybe with the intent.\n\n437\n00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,420\nWe're not gonna say it's always\nthat intent, but it may have been\n\n438\n00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,370\nformatted with the intent of trying\nto pull some sort of anti forensics.\n\n439\n00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,480\nYou know, now we have a way\nto basically reverse that and\n\n440\n00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,000\nsee what may have been on there\npreviously and now recover that.\n\n441\n00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,380\nIt may be right there.\n\n442\n00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,520\nIt may have been deleted.\n\n443\n00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,240\nYou know, we unformat and then boom,\nwe see if we can get it back from that so.\n\n444\n00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:43,580\nWhere you've been able to pierce that veil\nand get right through to that prior stuff.\n\n445\n00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,780\n>> Yeah, and definitely no shortage of\ntools to do this because it is something\n\n446\n00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,860\nthat the average person needs.\n\n447\n00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,070\nWe delete files accidentally,\nthings happen, files become corrupted.\n\n448\n00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:59,270\nI had a portable USB drive that\nthe table got messed up on, and so it\n\n449\n00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:03,130\njust didn't see the partitions any more,\nand was able to recover that from data.\n\n450\n00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,260\nThese same tools can be used in our\nforensics investigation, as you said,\n\n451\n00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,350\nto try to get back files that people\nthink they've deleted or that they.\n\n452\n00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,680\nThey know they deleted them,\nthey tried to get rid of them.\n\n453\n00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,930\nThey are still there,\nwe can go in and recover that.\n\n454\n00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,870\nAnd then use that as evidence.\n\n455\n00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,210\n>> This is to kind of point this out.\n\n456\n00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,410\nJames was mentioning one of the tools\nthat zeros the drive effectively.\n\n457\n00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,170\nProperly erased to standard.\n\n458\n00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,760\nAnd SSD drives.\n\n459\n00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,800\nNot always.\n\n460\n00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,340\nNot all wipes are created equal.\n\n461\n00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,910\nThere's wipes that are just kind of\n\n462\n00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,500\nmake you feel like you've got\na nice security blanket on.\n\n463\n00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,110\nThat's basically all they do,\nand then there's ones that\n\n464\n00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:46,250\nreally do a good thorough job and\nprevent data from being recovered.\n\n465\n00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,660\nBut they aren't all created equal.\n\n466\n00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:55,420\nSo don't count on that\nthe way to cover your tracks.\n\n467\n00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,100\nYeah, or if you're investigating someone,\nthey've wiped it, a drive.\n\n468\n00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,610\nDon't consider that, you know,\nthey wiped wiped it, I'm done.\n\n469\n00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,470\nI can't do anything.\n\n470\n00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,720\n>> Can't get anything back.\n\n471\n00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,950\n>> It all depends.\n\n472\n00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,195\nI mean there's plenty of tools out\nin the market that, you know, for,\n\n473\n00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:14,145\nI'll just say consumer slash civilian use,\nput it that way.\n\n474\n00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:17,355\nYou know, the people that aren't trying\nto defeat this type of stuff, or\n\n475\n00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:22,925\naren't trying to make sure that stuff\ncan' t be recovered for whatever reason.\n\n476\n00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:25,755\nWell, the stuff that\nthe average joe uses are.\n\n477\n00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,530\nThey may not do the most\nthorough of wipes.\n\n478\n00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,200\nThey just make you feel like\nthey've done something and\n\n479\n00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,580\nthey're probably good enough for the\nconsumer space, just the general space.\n\n480\n00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,260\nBut once you get up to corporate level and\n\n481\n00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,180\nyou're talking military and, you know,\ngovernments and stuff like that.\n\n482\n00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,440\nThat's where they will employ\nthe better level wipes.\n\n483\n00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,780\nSo if you're gonna wipe a drive in\na business to make sure nothing can\n\n484\n00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,950\nbe recovered off of it,\nthen you're gonna wanna look for\n\n485\n00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,460\nstuff like, they have DOD level wipes, and\n\n486\n00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,770\nthey've got other ones out there too\nthat are really quite aggressive.\n\n487\n00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,480\n>> Where you can control the number of\npasses that it wipes across that drive.\n\n488\n00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,290\nCuz it's really what it's all about,\nis you can go across that drive once,\n\n489\n00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:12,240\nwriting zeroes all the way through, but\nsome of the data was zeroes, right?\n\n490\n00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,438\nThe data was either ones or zeroes and\nI'm not gonna get into how these work.\n\n491\n00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:21,176\nI'm not gonna pretend to understand what\nthey do, but they're basically writing\n\n492\n00:27:21,176 --> 00:27:25,981\nones and zeroes across those drives with\nwhatever their proprietary algorithm is,\n\n493\n00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:30,379\nand then they can do it over and over and\nover again, so by the time it's done,\n\n494\n00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:33,583\nthere's really nothing left recoverable,\nwe think.\n\n495\n00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,530\n>> That's the thing.\n\n496\n00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:40,670\nInterestingly enough,\nthey're saying that the DoD wipes.\n\n497\n00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:45,440\nJust that you and\nI were taught the way to say it.\n\n498\n00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,000\nThat's the standard that you want to use.\n\n499\n00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,110\nIt used to be either three or seven passes\ndepending on what situation you were in.\n\n500\n00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,350\nNow there starting to say with\nthe current generation of drives.\n\n501\n00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,497\nJust one pass will work.\n\n502\n00:28:00,497 --> 00:28:02,060\n>> Oh, really?\n\n503\n00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,020\n>> That's starting to kind of creep out.\n\n504\n00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,230\nI don't know, maybe it's because\nI've been around for a while or\n\n505\n00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,760\nmaybe I'm getting to a point where\nI'm getting a little older and\n\n506\n00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,855\ntelling people to get off my lawn and\nall that.\n\n507\n00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:15,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm still going for\n\n508\n00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,280\nlike the three rounds or something.\n\n509\n00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,894\n>> I'd do 20 rounds.\n\n510\n00:28:17,894 --> 00:28:20,566\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, whatever, lock and load.\n\n511\n00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:23,190\n>> And as [INAUDIBLE] says,\nin the end a sledge hammer or\n\n512\n00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,020\na hard drive shredder is the way you\nmake sure no data is recoverable.\n\n513\n00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:32,320\n>> And there's been, you were saying,\nis as far as you think that,\n\n514\n00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,300\nthat should work the wipe and everything\nto do it, you keep everything in there.\n\n515\n00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:41,120\nThere's actually,\nit's never been formally confirmed but\n\n516\n00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,870\nthe theory is, I want to say by some\n\n517\n00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,220\nof the stuff that's been put out\nthere that someone's tried it but\n\n518\n00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,320\nthey're just not talking is that you can\nstill even off a drive that's been wiped.\n\n519\n00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,100\nEven with three passes or\nwhatever you want, you can still recover\n\n520\n00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,820\ndata off of it, but the equipment needed\nis like a scanning electron microscope.\n\n521\n00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,680\nYou need to get down to that point\nwhere you're looking at directions of\n\n522\n00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,300\nthe particles to see what was moved and\nwhat wasn't.\n\n523\n00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,520\nAnd then you can use that to recover data,\n\n524\n00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:17,660\nbut the scanning electron microscopes\nare not something you just find.\n\n525\n00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,540\nThat's a university, that's a research\ncenter, something like that.\n\n526\n00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,210\nAnd it's expensive piece of hardware so\n\n527\n00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:29,270\nyou're not gonna have that So\nyou don't have worry about someone.\n\n528\n00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:34,560\nSomeone might get a scanning electron\nmicroscope and no they're not.\n\n529\n00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,670\nThere's theories that this has been done,\nand\n\n530\n00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,180\nkind of like things that kind of count\nas rumors that it has been done, but\n\n531\n00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,840\nit would be very tedious,\nit would take a very long time to do.\n\n532\n00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,560\nAnd who knows how effective or reliable\nthe actual data would be at that point,\n\n533\n00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,700\nbut the feeling is that\nyes you can do that.\n\n534\n00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,560\nSo, but you probably really\ngot something important off\n\n535\n00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,550\nthat if you're doing it, maybe,\n\n536\n00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,880\nyou're talking probably like a national\nsecurity type thing at that point.\n\n537\n00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,800\n>> And you're not worried about the courts\naccepting it as valid evidence at that\n\n538\n00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,290\npoint, you're just trying to stop,\na major terrorism threat or\n\n539\n00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,860\nsomething like that, maybe.\n\n540\n00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,570\nAnd again, not something we're\ngonna probably have access to.\n\n541\n00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,000\nAnd then I'll tell you my other experience\nI have played with teaching CDH.\n\n542\n00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,330\nWe played with some of those white\nprograms, the next chapter is recovery and\n\n543\n00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,150\nwe'll go back and do some recovering\non the drives we just wiped.\n\n544\n00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,970\nAnd I'm gonna be able to cover data.\n\n545\n00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,450\nSo it's like you gotta test it if you're\ntalking about for your own use or for\n\n546\n00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,500\nyour company use.\n\n547\n00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,470\nIn our case though, as a forensic\ninvestigator, that's not a bad thing.\n\n548\n00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:38,480\nHey, maybe they used some less\nthan stellar wiping program.\n\n549\n00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,590\nAnd so that means I can still go in there,\nthey think they're safe.\n\n550\n00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,400\nThey're like oh yeah, here,\nyou can have my computer.\n\n551\n00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,820\nYou don't even need a warrant [LAUGH].\n\n552\n00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,080\nAnd we've got good software we\ncan use to bring that back.\n\n553\n00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,970\n>> Yeah, don't forget that.\n\n554\n00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,510\nI mean, you're talking from experience,\nright here,\n\n555\n00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:01,140\nthat you can get stuff off a drive that\nwas just wiped that shouldn't be there.\n\n556\n00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,690\nThey are telling you you can destroy\nthis stuff and never get it back.\n\n557\n00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,780\nClearly, you did.\n\n558\n00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,300\nMake sure you question how\nthat process actually worked.\n\n559\n00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,820\nSome of these consumer tools,\n\n560\n00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,080\ndon't count them anything\nmore than a security blanket.\n\n561\n00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,580\nThat they just make you feel\nlike you've done something.\n\n562\n00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,220\nThey haven't really done anything,\nyou know.\n\n563\n00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,090\nI really kind of think\nabout that whole term,\n\n564\n00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,660\nsecurity blanket,\nbecause that's what they are.\n\n565\n00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,670\n>> Yeah.\n\n566\n00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,405\nBut like I said.\n\n567\n00:31:32,405 --> 00:31:34,865\nIn a forensic investigator role,\n\n568\n00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:38,855\nthat might not necessarily be a bad thing\nbecause our job is to get that data back.\n\n569\n00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,735\nSo, I'm hoping they use that.\n\n570\n00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:42,097\n>> That's easy money if they done that.\n\n571\n00:31:42,097 --> 00:31:44,777\n>> You know the really cheap\nwipe program on there because\n\n572\n00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:48,621\nthat way I know I can maybe get it back a\nlittle easier, and not have to use some of\n\n573\n00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:52,081\nthese other techniques that we're\ngonna talk about when we get back.\n\n574\n00:31:52,081 --> 00:31:53,080\nBecause looking at our clock.\n\n575\n00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,379\nIt's about time for\nus to take another one of those breaks.\n\n576\n00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:56,459\nWe're gonna step away.\n\n577\n00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:59,663\nWhen we come back, more data and\npartition recovery.\n\n578\n00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:01,132\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n579\n00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:07,495\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen,\n\n580\n00:32:07,495 --> 00:32:14,837\ncontinuing on with our deleted files and\npartitions episode.\n\n581\n00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:19,158\nWe're going to take a look next at, or\ntalk about a concept called File Carving,\n\n582\n00:32:19,158 --> 00:32:22,520\nI know we've mentioned that\na couple of times, Sean.\n\n583\n00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,535\nWhat do we really mean by File Carving.\n\n584\n00:32:24,535 --> 00:32:30,280\n>> Yeah,\nFile Carving is a very delicate process.\n\n585\n00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,910\nIt's almost like an art,\n\n586\n00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,380\nrather than an actual\nreal scientific thing.\n\n587\n00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,949\nIt kind of feels like it.\n\n588\n00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,730\nIt helps you recover as a process that you\ncan use to recover files that just may\n\n589\n00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:51,400\nhave otherwise been lost,\nand basically what it is,\n\n590\n00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:58,300\nto put it at the simplest level, is if you\nenvision those clusters on that drive and\n\n591\n00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,820\nyou're dumping data into it, and\nyou have to completely fill out a cluster,\n\n592\n00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,360\nand the next one, and\nthe next one, and the next one.\n\n593\n00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,200\nAnd then you delete all those things, and\nthen you put different files in there.\n\n594\n00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,085\nAnd those files don't fill all\nthe space in that cluster.\n\n595\n00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:19,060\nIt will only take up a portion of it,\nwhat happens to the rest of that?\n\n596\n00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,970\nWell, we know it doesn't just\nsit at the operate system and\n\n597\n00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,020\nfile system to say okay, I got a little\nextra space here, I'll just squeeze some\n\n598\n00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,930\nmore stuff in here from this other file,\nand I'll put the rest of it over here.\n\n599\n00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,620\nNo.\nIt just puts that in another cluster and\n\n600\n00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,200\nkeeps going on.\n\n601\n00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:40,030\nWell that little extra space, if there\nwas something that was previously there\n\n602\n00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:45,580\nthat took up that whole cluster and\nnow you deleted it and\n\n603\n00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,940\nput something that only takes up part\nof it, what's the implication of that?\n\n604\n00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,150\nThe implication of that is\nthat you can still recover\n\n605\n00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:58,420\npart of the previous file even though\nsome of it has been overwritten.\n\n606\n00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,340\nIt's a very delicate process,\n\n607\n00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,710\ndefinitely takes a lot of patience and\ntakes the right equipment\n\n608\n00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:11,100\nto do because there are different tools\nthat will do File Carving for sure.\n\n609\n00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,430\nBut all of them work a little differently.\n\n610\n00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:18,680\nI mean the process sounds,\non the surface, pretty straight forward.\n\n611\n00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,420\nBut I assure you it's not.\n\n612\n00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:25,790\nSome of them will say okay\nI will grab a piece here,\n\n613\n00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:30,590\na piece here, and a piece here and I'll\nlet you look at them and recover them and\n\n614\n00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,010\nsay, well what do I have here?\n\n615\n00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,160\nYou can work about putting things\nback together or whatever.\n\n616\n00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,873\nSome of them will say if the file\nthat you are file recovering or\n\n617\n00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:45,830\ndoing file recovering on\nwasn't in contiguous blocks,\n\n618\n00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,290\nthen you're not gonna\nbe able to recover it.\n\n619\n00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,290\nSo if you have a situation\nwhere you had four clusters and\n\n620\n00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:54,650\nthen you deleted that whole file, out of\nall four of those clusters, and then you\n\n621\n00:34:54,650 --> 00:35:00,900\nput four separate files in there, you\ncould still technically do a file carve.\n\n622\n00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,230\nAnd recover those remnants that are left\nin that little bit of slack space or\n\n623\n00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,130\nleft over space in that cluster.\n\n624\n00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,630\nBut if it was a situation\nwhere you had the file was\n\n625\n00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,200\nspread out among different clusters and\nthen it's not gonna work.\n\n626\n00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,850\nSo that's where the downfall would be, but\n\n627\n00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,350\nyou amazingly can recover\nquite a bit doing this.\n\n628\n00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:28,260\nIt takes quite a bit of patience and\n\n629\n00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,220\nbeing kind of dedicated to your art there.\n\n630\n00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,620\nBut you can get some stuff,\n\n631\n00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,680\nand there's some tools that are definitely\nready to help you out with that.\n\n632\n00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,270\nA lot of them are on the Linux side, but\nI don;t really have a problem with that.\n\n633\n00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,510\nIt's that they're on the Linux side; but\n\n634\n00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,330\nall you have to do is learn Linux and\nthey're in a live distro.\n\n635\n00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,240\nAll of them are free in different\nrepositories out there.\n\n636\n00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,390\n>> We should all have\na copy of cali by now, or\n\n637\n00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,380\ncyber hawk if you're on that cutting edge.\n\n638\n00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,910\nWe haven't played with that one yet.\n\n639\n00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,200\nOr maybe Shift from Sands,\nwhich runs off of Ubuntu.\n\n640\n00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,130\nSo we definitely got some options there.\n\n641\n00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,890\nLike you said though,\ncan't imagine, tedious process.\n\n642\n00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,878\nWe're talking about trying to recover,\nbits of a file off of the hard drive,\n\n643\n00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:14,656\nand that can be a lot of fun.\n\n644\n00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:17,172\n>> [LAUGH] Usually\nthe ones that are easier,\n\n645\n00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:22,130\nthere's are ones that make the process\nthat make the process relatively easy,\n\n646\n00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:27,088\nbut the downside of it is that they're\neasy because they're very convenient,\n\n647\n00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:32,046\nsimply to use, and, the drawback of that\nis they're simple to use because they\n\n648\n00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:37,004\ndon't have all the features of something\nthat requires that down in the weeds,\n\n649\n00:36:37,004 --> 00:36:38,810\ndown and dirty work.\n\n650\n00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,480\nThey don't have those features, so\n\n651\n00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,060\nthose may be the ones that\nare easy to use that say.\n\n652\n00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,310\nHey, you've got to have\ncontiguous clusters\n\n653\n00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,450\nfrom the original file to retrieve it.\n\n654\n00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:55,380\nWhere the ones that are maybe command\nlines, some of these are command lines.\n\n655\n00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,325\nThose ones may be able to be a lot more\nsuccessful at recovering the data.\n\n656\n00:37:00,325 --> 00:37:04,655\nBut then again,\nyou're gonna have to be pretty patient and\n\n657\n00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,465\ndo some searching, and extract that data.\n\n658\n00:37:08,465 --> 00:37:10,615\nAnd the see maybe how to reassemble it.\n\n659\n00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:14,045\nYou may not have the whole file anymore.\n\n660\n00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:16,905\nSo you may need to make heads or\ntails of something.\n\n661\n00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:19,330\nYou only have a fragment.\n\n662\n00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:23,250\nAnd you may even have to in some\ncases find situations where you will\n\n663\n00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,370\ngrab a good file of that format and\n\n664\n00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:31,925\npaste in your stuff from\nyour file card into the,\n\n665\n00:37:31,925 --> 00:37:37,565\ninto the other file, and use that\none's file, that file's header and\n\n666\n00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:42,315\nall that to replace the original one and\nthen see if you can open it.\n\n667\n00:37:42,315 --> 00:37:46,355\nAnd you can imagine that\nsounds about as fun as,\n\n668\n00:37:46,355 --> 00:37:48,445\n>> It's like we're performing surgery\n\n669\n00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:50,275\nbasically on these files.\n\n670\n00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:53,013\nWe're Frankensteining them if you will,\nright?\n\n671\n00:37:53,013 --> 00:37:56,796\nWe're taking this bit we have with just a,\npart of that document,\n\n672\n00:37:56,796 --> 00:38:00,110\nbut the importance of that\nthe operating

--> 00:38:20,275\nyou will need a reasonable amount\nof practice to pull this off.\n\n678\n00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:23,850\nAnd, be prepared to pull some hair out.\n\n679\n00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,070\nThis process just hearing about it is so\nfrustrating and\n\n680\n00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:36,270\ntedious that Ben is already drinking.\n\n681\n00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,950\n>> I mentioned the term surgery and\n\n682\n00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:42,165\nnow I'm looking at your list of software,\nthat we might use to do the file carving.\n\n683\n00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:43,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And one of them happens to be\n\n684\n00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,470\ncalled, Sean?\n\n685\n00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,080\n>> Scalpel.\n\n686\n00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,420\nI knew that's

00:38:52,950\nSo yeah.\nA couple different tools we might be able\n\n690\n00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,140\nuse to do some file carving.\n\n691\n00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,160\nI threw up a link there for\none you had mentioned, Sean,\n\n692\n00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,060\nearlier, which is-\n>> Yeah.\n\n693\n00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,630\n>> Foremost.\n\n694\n00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,380\n>> Foremost.\n\n695\n00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,200\nThat was on your list.\n\n696\n00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,020\nScalpel, another one.\n\n697\n00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,750\nBoth of these, notice they're from\nSourceForge, so these are project people\n\n698\n00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,630\nwho've tried to write this software,\nit's open source, basically.\n\n699\n00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,790\nSoftware that we can get in and\ntake part in the development team but\n\n700\n00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,860\nyou can be right in there.\n\n701\n00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,230\nSo a couple of tools there.\n\n702\n00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,170\nAnything else we could mention for tools?\n\n703\n00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:24,930\n>> Yeah, I think the other one on my\nlist that I've got here, the photo rack.\n\n704\n00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:30,070\nThat one is specifically\ndesigned to recover images.\n\n705\n00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,450\nSo it's got a whole list\nof supported images that it\n\n706\n00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,660\nwill attempt to recover if it finds them.\n\n707\n00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,072\nOr carve them out of\nthe system if it finds them.\n\n708\n00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:44,518\nSo, that can be incredibly useful for you.\n\n709\n00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:49,395\nCuz now a lot of times the evidence\nyou might be looking for could be\n\n710\n00:39:49,395 --> 00:39:53,665\n>> A scan of something, a photograph,\n\n711\n00:39:53,665 --> 00:39:56,470\nany number of formats.\n\n712\n00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:01,580\nAnd this actually supports\na good number of formats.\n\n713\n00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,260\nSo you should have some good\nluck if you're looking for\n\n714\n00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,870\nthose files and there's even a piece\nof them there, that should help you.\n\n715\n00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,820\nDown side of something like an image file\nthough is if you recover an image file and\n\n716\n00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,810\nit's just a few fragments that\nyou've carved out and put together,\n\n717\n00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,476\nyou could have an image that there's\nonly a partial image on it and there's.\n\n718\n00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:25,130\nSo its evidentiary value may not be\n\n719\n00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,119\nthat high, and\nI got to use the word evidentiary.\n\n720\n00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,446\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've been waiting on it the last\n\n721\n00:40:30,446 --> 00:40:31,443\nweek and a half to use that.\n\n722\n00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:32,372\n>> He's been practicing it\n[CROSSTALK] when we're off

summarize\nthat up, when we talk about a cluster.\n\n728\n00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:51,160\nYou might have a 4 kilobyte cluster,\nyou've written a file to that,\n\n729\n00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,780\nyou've deleted it, and the next file\nthat gets written is only 2 kilobytes.\n\n730\n00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,880\nSo it overrides that cluster,\nthere's only 2 kilobytes so\n\n731\n00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,960\nthe other 2 kilobytes still contains\nthe data from the previous file.\n\n732\n00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,510\nThat's what file carving is all about,\ntrying to go in there and\n\n733\n00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,572\nget those remnants out.\n\n734\n00:41:05,572 --> 00:41:10,010\n>> I don't know about you but\n\n735\n00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:14,830\nit's an I find this one when I first\nstarted getting into forensics and\n\n736\n00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,690\nthey were really working on\nthis process and everything.\n\n737\n00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:22,360\nI found this one to be one of the ones\nthat's not only really fascinating and\n\n738\n00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,250\npowerful, but then you think,\nmost of us in IT and\n\n739\n00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,200\ncomputers know that you can\nrecover files off the system.\n\n740\n00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,820\nWe're kind of aware of that, but\n\n741\n00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,880\nyou don't really pay too much attention\nto the fact that the way clusters and\n\n742\n00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,910\nall that work, yeah, it's something that\nthey teach on the A+ for example, but\n\n743\n00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:46,175\noutside of that, how much do you\nactually think Think about that.\n\n744\n00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:50,971\nI remember thinking about clusters and\nthe way files are deleted way early\n\n745\n00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:55,775\non back when I was tinkering with\ncomputers, and I thought about it a lot.\n\n746\n00:41:55,775 --> 00:41:58,844\nI didn't think about it\nas much since then, and\n\n747\n00:41:58,844 --> 00:42:04,065\nnow you think about the significance of\nwhat we learned then with the clusters and\n\n748\n00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:08,975\nhow it doesn't have to use a full cluster\nbefore it moves on to the next one and\n\n749\n00:42:08,975 --> 00:42:11,603\nall sorts of things like that.\n\n750\n00:42:11,603 --> 00:42:16,863\nThat's the foundation of this, so\nyou've really gotta know your stuff\n\n751\n00:42:16,863 --> 00:42:21,573\nas far as file systems and the way things\nare stored to really understand that.\n\n752\n00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:25,842\nIf you don't understand that,\nthen file carving kind of is just,\n\n753\n00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:31,026\nIt's kind of a fuzzy concept, and if you\nunderstand what Mike was saying about,\n\n754\n00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:35,907\nyou have four [CROSSTALK] whatever,\nfill by cluster, you're only taking up\n\n755\n00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:40,975\ntwo of it, the previous one was four,\nthen there's still stuff left behind.\n\n756\n00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:41,579\n>> Yeah.\n\n757\n00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,540\n>> The average person doesn't\nnecessarily understand that.\n\n758\n00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,340\nThey think well, if there's space there,\nit's gonna use it.\n\n759\n00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,830\nThey think if it's this big,\nI can shove everything in there.\n\n760\n00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:49,615\nIt's a box.\n\n761\n00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:50,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> No, it's not\n\n762\n00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:54,610\nthat same as just a box that\nyou put books in or papers in.\n\n763\n00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:58,040\n>> So, guys that are trudging\nthrough the A+ stuff, and\n\n764\n00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,990\nit seems so boring and tedious, and\nlearning all this stuff, and who cares?\n\n765\n00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:03,951\n>> Now you know why you care.\n\n766\n00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:04,773\nNow we know why we have to\ngo through that training.\n\n767\n00:43:04,773 --> 00:43:07,653\n>> That's exactly why.\nYou, too, may be a forensic technician.\n\n768\n00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:12,190\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n>> A file carving tool.\n\n769\n00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:16,970\nAnother one that we might want to try\nto do is recover an entire partition.\n\n770\n00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,190\nBecause that's another thing that the bad\nguys are gonna try to do instead of just\n\n771\n00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:23,630\ndeleting individual files maybe it's\nsomebody that's using your computer and\n\n772\n00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,020\nthey just delete the email, delete\nthe pictures that shouldn't be on their\n\n773\n00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,100\ncomputer, delete the files where they\nwere planning out some big cyber attack.\n\n774\n00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,565\nSome of them might go as far as\njust delete the entire partition.\n\n775\n00:43:35,565 --> 00:43:37,280\nRight.\nI'm just going to format the drive or\n\n776\n00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,200\nremove the partition, and they won't be\nable to get the data back then, it's gone.\n\n777\n00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,810\n>> Yeah\n>> Or is it?\n\n778\n00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,390\n>> It isn't.\n\n779\n00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,930\nYou know where we're going, right.\n\n780\n00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:50,940\nIt's one of those things, again,\nthat, how many times were you\n\n781\n00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:56,010\ntaught when you started getting into\ncomputers that, that was the way it was.\n\n782\n00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,520\nThere was a format that got rid of stuff.\n\n783\n00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,110\nIf you do a fdisk on a drive.\n\n784\n00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:08,970\nAnything that kills that partition off\nthere, gone, it's not coming back.\n\n785\n00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,260\nI'm sorry, I've had a bad day.\n\n786\n00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,810\nThat type of stuff,\nyou're just not getting it.\n\n787\n00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,140\nNow we're learning, yeah.\n\n788\n00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,790\nIt's something you can still get back.\n\n789\n00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:23,910\nSo, you break that drive into little\npartitions, slice the pie up and start\n\n790\n00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:27,990\nassigning different drive letters and\nall that to it, and formatting all that.\n\n791\n00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:32,190\nYou've got that process done, then someone\nstores something how it shouldn't be there\n\n792\n00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,530\nand they're trying to cover up.\n\n793\n00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,490\nThey delete one, they're like yeah,\nwell it's unallocated space now.\n\n794\n00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,520\nGo ahead, you're not going to get it back.\n\n795\n00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,500\nWell, we are.\n\n796\n00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,980\n>> Yeah, and it really comes\nback to the exact same concept.\n\n797\n00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,510\nDelete a file, delete an entire partition,\n\n798\n00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,420\nall you're doing is removing the marker,\nright.\n\n799\n00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,690\nIf I delete a partition there's that\ntable at the beginning of the drive,\n\n800\n00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,290\nthat master boot record that.\n\n801\n00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:57,450\nThat stores my beginning and ending points\nof my partitions and remove that record.\n\n802\n00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,900\nRight, I move the entry out of that table.\n\n803\n00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,250\nThe data is still there.\n\n804\n00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,170\nI didn't go out and wipe it,\nit didn't do a DOD wipe across there,\n\n805\n00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,280\nit just removed the pointers.\n\n806\n00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,970\nThe OS can't see it anymore,\ndoesn't recognize it anymore.\n\n807\n00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,800\nBut if we use the right tools,\n\n808\n00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,220\nwe can rebuild that partition, and\nwe can go back and get that data in there.\n\n809\n00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,620\nSo it's It's really almost the exact same\nconcept as recovering deleted files,\n\n810\n00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,970\njust at a bigger scale.\n\n811\n00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,570\nNow we're talking about\nthe entire partition.\n\n812\n00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:26,170\n>> Yeah, you can see a pattern here.\n\n813\n00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,985\nWhat's happening is that, when you\nget rid of something, it's not gone.\n\n814\n00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:33,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We've already been through that\n\n815\n00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,260\nin other areas.\n\n816\n00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,480\nWith email and other stuff.\n\n817\n00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,920\nThis is just another case\nis that you delete a file,\n\n818\n00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:48,020\nyou overwrite parts of a file, you format\na drive, you delete a partition off there.\n\n819\n00:45:49,325 --> 00:45:54,545\nI'm gonna get it back, so,\nwe can get these things back and\n\n820\n00:45:54,545 --> 00:45:59,735\nwe can do a full examination of it as\nbest we can with what is still remains.\n\n821\n00:45:59,735 --> 00:46:02,270\nThat may be the big barrier on it.\n\n822\n00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:05,260\nBut we can get those things back.\n\n823\n00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:10,700\nYou may have to unlearn some of the stuff\nthat you may have learned all these years,\n\n824\n00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,940\nI can't that back, it's a dead system,\n\n825\n00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,870\nit is fresh for being used for\nsomething else.\n\n826\n00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:24,010\nNo, let me also by the way sense I had\nto kind of throw this in there because I\n\n827\n00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:29,500\nthink this was kind of hinted at,\nI may have seen that question earlier on,\n\n828\n00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,330\nbut one of the things we talked\nabout when we built images\n\n829\n00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:37,750\nis that you wanna have\nforensically clean media.\n\n830\n00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,840\nBefore you put a new image on it.\n\n831\n00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,070\nBecause you're gonna end up reusing media.\n\n832\n00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:46,820\nYou're probably not gonna be blessed with\nan environment where they're gonna buy,\n\n833\n00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:52,170\nfor every new case, a new set of media for\nyou to image stuff on to.\n\n834\n00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,580\nYeah it happens, but those are usually\nthe big buck labs that are doing that.\n\n835\n00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,290\nSo you're probably not\ngonna be that fortunate.\n\n836\n00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:05,330\nSo, if you need to have forensically\nclean media, now you should\n\n837\n00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:10,550\nunderstand how significant it\nreally is to say that because if\n\n838\n00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:16,210\nyou don't properly wipe a drive and\nsanitize it and all that stuff.\n\n839\n00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:21,180\nAll these things that we're talking about\nstill could remain from a prior case.\n\n840\n00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,540\nYou could be going about your business\ndoing a file carb or something else and\n\n841\n00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:30,015\nall of a sudden you pull up a file and\nit's like oh there it goes.\n\n842\n00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:33,885\nI got what I need or this looks weird,\nthis doesn't look in context.\n\n843\n00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,065\nYeah, it's from a prior case.\n\n844\n00:47:35,065 --> 00:47:39,164\nYou don't wipe the drive properly and\nyou're in big trouble now at that point.\n\n845\n00:47:39,164 --> 00:47:41,209\nSo you don't want that to happen.\n\n846\n00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:44,483\nSo that kind of also\nfits back to that theme.\n\n847\n00:47:44,483 --> 00:47:45,598\nForensic will clean.\n\n848\n00:47:45,598 --> 00:47:50,027\nWe can recover just about anything\noff a drive within reason so\n\n849\n00:47:50,027 --> 00:47:55,470\nit takes on more importance now that\nyou can see what we can actually do.\n\n850\n00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:56,880\n>> Absolutely.\n\n851\n00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,820\nWe have a few different tools a couple\nof which I'm not even familiar\n\n852\n00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,450\nwith some of these that\nwe can use to recover.\n\n853\n00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:05,680\nI guess before we go there what\nhappens when I delete a partition,\n\n854\n00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,580\nwhat's really going on,\nif we're talking say in Windows.\n\n855\n00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,730\n>> It's exactly like you said.\n\n856\n00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:13,470\nIt just basically erases the entry and\nthen it's go ahead,\n\n857\n00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,580\nsomeone else can use it.\n\n858\n00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:19,380\nWhat we're doing with those\nrecovery tools is we are rebuilding\n\n859\n00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,290\nthat partition by resetting the marker\non there, saying yeah, there it is.\n\n860\n00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,960\nAnd by doing that,\n\n861\n00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:31,700\nnow we've got that partition essentially\nback, and we can do that examination.\n\n862\n00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:37,280\nIt's essentially just like doing\na file delete, or formatting a drive.\n\n863\n00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,600\nWe're just going through and\nsaying I'm going to put this map\n\n864\n00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,030\nright back here and\nall of a sudden all of the stuff is valid.\n\n865\n00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,070\nI'm not taking those.\n\n866\n00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,750\nThose things are still there.\n\n867\n00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:53,810\nI'm just saying by taking out that map,\nyou can use it however you want.\n\n868\n00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,850\nDon't worry who the previous owner is.\n\n869\n00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,240\nNow I'm saying here's the map.\n\n870\n00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:59,060\nThey stop there.\n\n871\n00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,380\nThat's what's there.\n\n872\n00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,120\n>> Exactly.\n\n873\n00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,210\nSo some of the tools we could use to\ndo some of this partition recovery,\n\n874\n00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:08,240\none that I've used\nsuccessfully is that Active@.\n\n875\n00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,810\nThey make a lot of good products,\none of them being partition recovery.\n\n876\n00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,260\nNot free, but it's good stuff.\n\n877\n00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,220\n>> Yeah.\nThat's one Chronos has ones.\n\n878\n00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,870\nDisk Eternals.\n\n879\n00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:21,470\nWhat you may have heard about.\n\n880\n00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,080\nThey make other stuff.\n\n881\n00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,390\nAnd there's another one on here I\njust was gonna throw out there.\n\n882\n00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,690\nIt's called get Data Back.\n\n883\n00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,630\nI think it's just cuz I like the name.\n\n884\n00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,980\nI think that's why I stuck that there.\n\n885\n00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,990\n>> Names that describe their product\nlike that are not very good, right?\n\n886\n00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:35,961\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n887\n00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:36,813\n>> And they have some\n\n888\n00:49:36,813 --> 00:49:38,950\nreally great things here.\n\n889\n00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:43,720\nThings I'd, things also to mention is\nthat if you're using the software,\n\n890\n00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,280\nor you wanna see some of the other\ntechniques you can use to do this,\n\n891\n00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,850\nyou can rebuild a partition.\n\n892\n00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:55,170\nIn Windows you can do it through doing\na recovery by putting the media in and\n\n893\n00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:57,910\nbooting off of that,\nthat's one way to do it.\n\n894\n00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:03,420\nYou can also slave out the drive\nby going into another system, that\n\n895\n00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:08,060\nhas the same interface and just setting\nthe jumpers on it and plugging it in.\n\n896\n00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:11,690\nSo you boot off another drive and\nnow you have a file system on the other\n\n897\n00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:14,880\none that you can do stuff with and\nrun the software against.\n\n898\n00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,460\nThat's a possibility.\n\n899\n00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,650\nAnd then of course there's all\nthat software that we have\n\n900\n00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,040\nthat can also do file recoveries.\n\n901\n00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,190\nThere's just bunches of\nthem out there to do that.\n\n902\n00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,284\nAnd you can do all sorts of fancy\nthings to get these things back and\n\n903\n00:50:29,284 --> 00:50:30,193\ndo analysis on it.\n\n904\n00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,048\n>> And probably another thing we need to\nmention too, it might make a difference on\n\n905\n00:50:33,048 --> 00:50:35,835\nwhat file system we're trying to recover\nthat partition on as well, right?\n\n906\n00:50:35,835 --> 00:50:41,692\n>> Yeah we've stayed pretty squarely\nin what we're talking about\n\n907\n00:50:41,692 --> 00:50:44,460\n>> The fact, and mft, so you know,\n\n908\n00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:49,890\nthe fat file system and the ntsf file\nsystem, not the only games in town.\n\n909\n00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:55,460\nI mean, they're not, there's the whole\nseries of extended files system,\n\n910\n00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:00,800\nor X2, three, four, all those for the\nLinux side of the house there's one HPFS,\n\n911\n00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,300\nof HPFS+ for for the apple stuff, and\nthere's even other ones on top of that.\n\n912\n00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,640\nThat are all sitting out there, and\n\n913\n00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,190\nthen there's even proprietary file\nsystems that you might run into.\n\n914\n00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:18,780\nI was mentioning to you at\nthe break about the PlayStation 4,\n\n915\n00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:25,360\nthey just found a way to\nrecover data off that system.\n\n916\n00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,280\nWhich, traditionally it's been a problem\nbecause that's a proprietary file\n\n917\n00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,400\nsystem that Sony put out in there.\n\n918\n00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,840\nIt's optimized for their purposes.\n\n919\n00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,910\nSo they create this whole thing for\nwhat they needed.\n\n920\n00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:42,730\nWell, it was a problem before, now they've\nspecifically built tools that can go in\n\n921\n00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:47,590\nthere and extract all that data that, you\nknow, may not have been reachable before.\n\n922\n00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,000\nThey can get it off that now.\n\n923\n00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,100\nSo someone was using that\nto browse the internet or\n\n924\n00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,230\nto hide illegal content or what have you.\n\n925\n00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:59,240\nIt's no longer out of reach and,\nno longer entirely out of reach.\n\n926\n00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,840\nThere's still some situations\nwhere there's stuff that is\n\n927\n00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,700\nencrypted on Playstation 4s and\nsome of the other game consoles as well\n\n928\n00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:11,720\nthat would still be just outside the reach\nif it's encrypted with the right standard.\n\n929\n00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:16,910\nBut you could still get\naccess to the drive at least.\n\n930\n00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,760\nAnd if you don't understand cryptography,\nnext week you gotta tune in.\n\n931\n00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,330\n>> Yeah, next week we got another\ngreat class coming up for you guys.\n\n932\n00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:23,491\n>> Check it out, that's a plug.\n\n933\n00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:24,631\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n934\n00:52:24,631 --> 00:52:28,796\nwe've talked about recovering files,\nwe've talked about recovering partitions.\n\n935\n00:52:28,796 --> 00:52:33,040\nAnother type of media that we might have\nto deal with our optical drives, right?\n\n936\n00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,970\n>> Yes, there's still enough optical\ndrives out there that you are going to\n\n937\n00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:40,400\nhave to deal with recovering\ndata off of them.\n\n938\n00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,160\nProbably, we're talking about the readable\nwritable ones that they can wipe\n\n939\n00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:45,660\nand reuse.\n\n940\n00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,430\nThere are ways to recover stuff off those.\n\n941\n00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:53,390\nMore than likely, if you're recovering any\ndata off of any piece of optical media.\n\n942\n00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:57,560\nIt's probably because it's just\ndamaged in some way, shape, or form.\n\n943\n00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,310\n>> Scratched, or something like that?\n\n944\n00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,200\n>> Yeah, someone may have got the media.\n\n945\n00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:06,620\nYou've seen it, someone's taken a paper\nclip or pen or you know whatever, and has\n\n946\n00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:11,240\ngone through and scratched it, or kicked\nit across the concrete or something.\n\n947\n00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,280\nYou know just to mess around and\n\n948\n00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,890\nsome people have done that\nspecifically to destroy it.\n\n949\n00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:21,560\nWell we can also pull stuff off of that.\n\n950\n00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,781\nCD's and\nDVD's have their own file systems,\n\n951\n00:53:26,781 --> 00:53:31,150\nthere's the CDFS for CDs and\n\n952\n00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:35,480\nthe UFSS, so many file systems.\n\n953\n00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,210\nYeah, they have UFSS for CDs and DVDs,\nso they've got their own things.\n\n954\n00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:45,830\nBut they also have utilities specifically\ndesigned to work with those and\n\n955\n00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:49,310\nextract that data at least\nrebuild what is left.\n\n956\n00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:53,140\nSo, someone is trying to cover up\nany type of files, we can get it.\n\n957\n00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:58,020\n>> And just to make sure,\nit was UDF, so I was wrong on that.\n\n958\n00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,470\nIt's UDF\n>> Okay.\n\n959\n00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:04,120\nUniversal disk format is what we're gonna\nput on those DVDs, but same concept, yeah,\n\n960\n00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,110\nso we gotta be able to recover that\ninformation as well, and as you said.\n\n961\n00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,960\nNormally because some kind of scratched\nmedia, they might have thought\n\n962\n00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,830\nthey could basically delete it\nby scratching it up, not so.\n\n963\n00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:21,970\n>> Yeah, it's\n>> It's never good\n\n964\n00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:26,780\nto say it's totally out of reach of\nwhat we can do as forensics people.\n\n965\n00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:33,940\nForensics people, we are supposed\nto have not only that much more in\n\n966\n00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:39,600\ndepth understanding of the system, we have\nalso got to be aware of those techniques.\n\n967\n00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:44,170\nYou've already seen, just in this,\nand this section alone,\n\n968\n00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:47,380\nthe whole stuff with delete files and\npartitions.\n\n969\n00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,010\nYou've seen a lot of things\nthat blew in the face of stuff\n\n970\n00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:53,590\nyou've been taught in the past.\n\n971\n00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,350\nAnd building on stuff that\nyou may have learned way,\n\n972\n00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:58,560\nway back if you learned it at all.\n\n973\n00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,780\nSome of the stuff that some of the stuff\nwith partitions and formatting,\n\n974\n00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,130\nand all that good stuff.\n\n975\n00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:06,210\nYou may never have been taught.\n\n976\n00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:08,960\nSome of this stuff they don't\neven teach in A+ anymore.\n\n977\n00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,950\nIt's just something they figured\nno one worries about that anymore.\n\n978\n00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,350\nNo one thinks about it.\n\n979\n00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,900\nIt's not an issue.\n\n980\n00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,280\nWell, for us, it is.\n\n981\n00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,010\nDefinitely for us, it's something\nthat you need to think about.\n\n982\n00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:24,210\n>> So just keep that in mind.\n\n983\n00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,130\nYou do need that intimate\nunderstanding for something like this.\n\n984\n00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:27,630\n>> Absolutely.\n\n985\n00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,110\nAlright, lots of good\ninformation there Sean.\n\n986\n00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:36,110\nWe went all the way from picking\nup files and folders to recovering\n\n987\n00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:41,410\nentire partitions on hard drives, as well\nas possibly from some optical media.\n\n988\n00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:45,042\nAlso talked a little bit about the\ndifference between mechanical drives or\n\n989\n00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:49,249\nmagnetic drives versus our cell C drive\nbecause big difference there with that\n\n990\n00:55:49,249 --> 00:55:49,780\ncommand.\n\n991\n00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:54,620\nThere's a good thing when it comes to\ncell C drives, bad thing when it comes\n\n992\n00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,070\nto forensic investigator, because\nwhen it removes data it removes it.\n\n993\n00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:00,750\nThere's no remnants of it\nthere to go back and get.\n\n994\n00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:04,540\nSo that becomes a real issue\nwith the cell C drive.\n\n995\n00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,930\nAnything else we want to put in here?\n\n996\n00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,770\nWe were talking about recovering files and\npartitions.\n\n997\n00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,050\n>> Yeah.\nJust to add something here on the end of\n\n998\n00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:17,170\nthis is the one thing that\nwasn't brought up in here but\n\n999\n00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:18,560\nit has been kind of mentioned.\n\n1000\n00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,840\nBut kinda tough to do specifically here.\n\n1001\n00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,350\n>> Yeah.\n>> Is the RAID systems.\n\n1002\n00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:27,690\nAnd if you have a RAID array,\nwe talked about that's proprietary stuff.\n\n1003\n00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:31,400\nOr it could something that you don't\nhave the equipment back at the lab,\n\n1004\n00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,390\nthose type of things.\n\n1005\n00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:37,914\nThere's also, all these techniques\ncan be adapted for RAID systems.\n\n1006\n00:56:37,914 --> 00:56:41,025\nAnd there's some\nspecifically developed for\n\n1007\n00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:44,773\nrecovering working with RAID,\nso if you've got that,\n\n1008\n00:56:44,773 --> 00:56:49,895\njust explore what different type of\nRAID you have and who the manufacturer.\n\n1009\n00:56:49,895 --> 00:56:53,420\nThink about who that is and you can\nget the appropriate tool then you can\n\n1010\n00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:56,431\nget data off those too but\nthey are slightly different but.\n\n1011\n00:56:56,431 --> 00:57:01,028\nBecause of some of the different things\nthat happen in there at the hardware level\n\n1012\n00:57:01,028 --> 00:57:02,940\nand things like that.\n\n1013\n00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,730\nIt's kind of tough to cover but\nwe just want to throw it out there.\n\n1014\n00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,330\n>> All right ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n1015\n00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:11,220\nWe hope you enjoyed the show.\n\n1016\n00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,880\nThank you guys for turning in

another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,890\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,700\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n6\n00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,850\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n7\n00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,730\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,450\nHow are you?\n\n9\n00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,200\n>> I'm doing good, thanks.\n\n10\n00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,350\nWe got another great episode lined up in\nour Digital Forensic Investigator series.\n\n11\n00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,930\nToday, we're gonna be looking\nat Image File Forensics, and\n\n12\n00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,440\nthings like Steganography.\n\n13\n00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,800\nSo, Sean, this is just another place\nthat we need to be able to, or\n\n14\n00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,940\nneed to be familiar with,\nwhen we're doing our investigations,\n\n15\n00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,400\nthis is places where they\nmight be hiding evidence.\n\n16\n00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,650\nPlaces that we might be able to\nuncover additional evidence,\n\n17\n00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,210\nhiding inside of their files,\nhiding inside images.\n\n18\n00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,330\n>> Yes, that's really the core\nof what's happening here.\n\n19\n00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,690\nAnd remember this is a little\ndifferent than what we did with just\n\n20\n00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,620\nplain file recovery.\n\n21\n00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,830\nWe talked about file recovery with tools,\nwe did talk about in a previous episode\n\n22\n00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,450\nwas things like PhotoRec\nwas one that came to mind.\n\n23\n00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,590\nThat was used to recover image files,\n\n24\n00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,170\nand there was a couple others in there\nthat were specifically designed for that.\n\n25\n00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,150\nThat's different than this,\nthat's treating a file as a file,\n\n26\n00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,140\nit may be an image and we're treating\nit a little bit differently and\n\n27\n00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,130\ndoing some unique stuff, but it's still\njust a file that we're extracting in\n\n28\n00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,250\nsome way from a hard drive and\nit's been deleted or corrupted somehow.\n\n29\n00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,650\nWhat we are doing here is we are talking\nabout someone using image as a carrier and\n\n30\n00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,040\nthey can use whatever file they want\nas a carrier to hide information, and\n\n31\n00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:11,610\nit's actually something that's getting\nto be used more and more and more.\n\n32\n00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,030\nIt's always been there.\n\n33\n00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,420\nIt's just something that more\npeople are becoming aware of.\n\n34\n00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,685\nMore people are using it for different\npurposes, both legitimate and malicious.\n\n35\n00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:23,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n36\n00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,060\nYeah, so really just the ability to\nhide that data in plain sight, really.\n\n37\n00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,750\nIt's not like encryption,\nwhere somebody encrypts a file.\n\n38\n00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,510\nI can see the file, I just can't read\nit because it's been encrypted and\n\n39\n00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,050\nI don't have the proper key.\n\n40\n00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,040\nWith things like steganography,\nthey're hiding it in place sight.\n\n41\n00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,960\nI see the picture,\nI can double click on the picture,\n\n42\n00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,020\nthe picture opens up in my photo viewer.\n\n43\n00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,400\nEverything looks normal, or\nthe mp3 file plays just like it should.\n\n44\n00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,390\nWhat I don't know is that\nif I used the proper tools,\n\n45\n00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,360\nburied within the bits that\nmake up that mp3 file or\n\n46\n00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,660\nthat image is whole another file or bunch\nof information that they've stored there.\n\n47\n00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,880\nSo it's really just hiding data in\nplain sight is what we're doing.\n\n48\n00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,850\n>> Yeah, that's what they call this a lot\nof times is hiding it in plain sight,\n\n49\n00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,680\nbecause you really can look at it,\ninteract with that file, and\n\n50\n00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,130\nnot know that underneath\nthe surface that there's something\n\n51\n00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,110\nembedded inside of that piece of data.\n\n52\n00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,532\nIt's a very clever technique.\n\n53\n00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:23,750\nIt's also a very powerful\ntechnique considering\n\n54\n00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,045\nall the different things\nthat you can do with it.\n\n55\n00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:34,630\nYou can potentially keep out of people\ndetecting or doing anything with.\n\n56\n00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,260\nIt's just the possibilities are really\nendless once you have that power and\n\n57\n00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,990\nknow about it.\n\n58\n00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,680\n>> Absolutely.\n\n59\n00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,050\nYou might have hundreds or\nthousands of pictures, and\n\n60\n00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,300\njust one of them has data buried\ninside and as a forensic investigator,\n\n61\n00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,340\nhow do we even go about trying to decided\nwell is there data in one of those images?\n\n62\n00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,880\nDo I need to go through each image now and\nlook for it?\n\n63\n00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,150\nAnd not just that,\nnot just images, I mean, anything.\n\n64\n00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,520\nAnd so it makes our job a whole lot more\ndifficult because now I've gotta take\n\n65\n00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,670\na second look at everything to see if,\nokay, I've scanned the document itself.\n\n66\n00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,790\nOr I've got the evidence\nfrom the document itself.\n\n67\n00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,840\nWhat if there's other evidence\nburied inside that document?\n\n68\n00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,730\nSo I almost have to go through my evidence\ntwice, really, when I'm looking at this.\n\n69\n00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,320\n>> Yeah, that very well could be the case.\n\n70\n00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,060\nYou're right, you may go through and\n\n71\n00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,710\nretrieve a bunch stuff\noff of a hard drive and\n\n72\n00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,615\nsee a bunch of images or data,\nand then after you've found it,\n\n73\n00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:34,820\nthen you may have to go through and\nreally do a closer analysis to see\n\n74\n00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,510\nif there's anything that might indicate\nthat there is steganography in use.\n\n75\n00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,550\nIt's a very tough proposition.\n\n76\n00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,700\nIt can be done, but it's one of those\nthings that it can be very, very tedious.\n\n77\n00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,382\nFortunately we've got tools that\ncan assist in that process,\n\n78\n00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:53,810\nwhich is really, really thankful.\n\n79\n00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,240\nBut some of them,\nthey're gonna take some time to\n\n80\n00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,980\nreally cut down to it and find,\nis there something there?\n\n81\n00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,090\nAnd what the alterations were and\nthen figure out how to retrieve it.\n\n82\n00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,460\nThat's really the thing.\n\n83\n00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,720\nBut it's an effective technique,\nand it is being used a lot.\n\n84\n00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,120\nSo, this process of finding it,\nyou're gonna have to go through.\n\n85\n00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,110\n>> You gotta do it!\n\n86\n00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,150\nAnd this really falls into what\nwe've mentioned a couple times.\n\n87\n00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,120\nIt's anti-forensics, right?\n\n88\n00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,030\nThey're actively trying to avoid or\nevade my forensic techniques.\n\n89\n00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:36,230\nYeah it may very well be an active\nanti-forensics tool that they're using.\n\n90\n00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:41,530\nThey may just be using it as\na part of their normal operation.\n\n91\n00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,580\nThat does happen.\n\n92\n00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,610\nIf you're doing something for\nanti-forensics, they know that they're\n\n93\n00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,350\ntrying to really evade all\nthe normal forensic techniques and\n\n94\n00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,700\nthings that people might do to find data.\n\n95\n00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,060\nThey realize that you're doing imaging,\nyou're looking for\n\n96\n00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,110\ndeleted files, you're looking for\nthings that may be passworded..\n\n97\n00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,280\nSo they're just gonna go to the next\nstep and say well, I'm just gonna\n\n98\n00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,950\nhide it in something that you can look\nright at and not know it's there.\n\n99\n00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,120\n>> Absolutely.\n\n100\n00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,530\nAll right, so, some examples of where\nwe've seen some stenography in action.\n\n101\n00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:28,750\n>> Yeah, there's countless examples of\nstenography being used all over the place.\n\n102\n00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,650\nThere's cases where they've used it in\nthings like some of the old school ones\n\n103\n00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,460\nthat you'll probably never have to\ndeal with, that was like microdots on,\n\n104\n00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,050\nthat spies use, that was one,\nthat was examples.\n\n105\n00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,040\nTaking photos that had or\ndrawing a picture that had something\n\n106\n00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,590\nin it that to anyone else would just look\nlike a normal piece of that picture, but\n\n107\n00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,850\nto the person that's in the know\nwould see that object and say, okay,\n\n108\n00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,010\nthat's a signal for such and such.\n\n109\n00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,380\nBut the stuff that we're seeing now,\nthat they're using, of course,\n\n110\n00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,750\nin the digital world, in the digital world\nwhat they're doing is they're using it for\n\n111\n00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,580\na lot of different crimes.\n\n112\n00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,220\nI can actually think of one\nthat fits in the forensic side.\n\n113\n00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:22,780\nI've used this example before, and it's\nstill a very, very good example because\n\n114\n00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,940\nit shows the type of people that could be\nusing this and what they would use it for.\n\n115\n00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,045\nAnd then how the forensic\nprocess had to come in.\n\n116\n00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:34,192\nThere was a case not too long ago,\n\n117\n00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:39,027\nit was in the last three or\nfour years, where they,\n\n118\n00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:44,199\nand I remember talking about\nthis in my CEH course, but\n\n119\n00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:49,260\nit applies just as well here where they,\nin Germany,\n\n120\n00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:57,599\nthey arrested someone that was engaged in\nsuspicious activity relating to terrorism.\n\n121\n00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,622\nAnd so, they arrested the individual and\nDid the whole thing of searching,\n\n122\n00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:08,072\nand I don't know if they call\nit search warrants there.\n\n123\n00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,023\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But they did that whole,\n\n124\n00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:14,617\nand they found amongst all this,\nthey found a hard drive, or sorry,\n\n125\n00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:18,990\na flash drive\n>> That had a single file on it, and\n\n126\n00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,370\nthat file was a video that had,\n\n127\n00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,760\nthat was a video of pornography,\nand they looked at it, and said,\n\n128\n00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,020\nit just doesn't fit,\nwhen they saw this video there.\n\n129\n00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,700\n>> They said it just doesn't fit.\n\n130\n00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,890\nIt seems out of place.\n\n131\n00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,420\nThey did some analysis on it, and\n\n132\n00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:44,325\nsaid there's suggestion that there's\nsomething hidden inside of this.\n\n133\n00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:44,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n134\n00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,540\n>> So they did a process, that we're going\nto discuss here called steganalysis.\n\n135\n00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,620\nThey did that and\nit actually took a while to do.\n\n136\n00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:00,620\nTo really go through the video, and\ndo this whole steganalysis process,\n\n137\n00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,730\nto find out where the stuff was,\nand reconstruct it.\n\n138\n00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,860\nBut at the end of the day,\nwhen they did go and reconstruct it, and\n\n139\n00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,360\npull everything out, they found that there\nwas plans for terrorist training cells.\n\n140\n00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,160\nThere were terrorist recruitment\nguides in different languages.\n\n141\n00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,860\nThere was a lot of things hidden in that\nfile, that they were able to recover.\n\n142\n00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:29,280\nSo it's a prime example of\nsomeone using steganography\n\n143\n00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,030\nto hide something that they're\ntrying to keep concealed.\n\n144\n00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,350\nThey know it's bad stuff.\n\n145\n00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,240\nThey don't want to get caught with it.\n\n146\n00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,360\nThey want to be able to in this\ncase spread the stuff around.\n\n147\n00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,610\nSo they took a video file and\nembedded these files in it.\n\n148\n00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,050\nAnd they just said there were other\nsigns on top of the fact that it just.\n\n149\n00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,690\n>> Yeah, seemed out of place.\n\n150\n00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,960\nThey said, here's somebody that is,\nin this case,\n\n151\n00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,700\na fundamentalist with this, and\nhe's into all these things.\n\n152\n00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,990\nAnd they said, here he is,\nhiding and possessing\n\n153\n00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,730\na flash drive,\nwith hardcore amateur pornography on it.\n\n154\n00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,170\nThey said that just\ndoesn't seem out of place.\n\n155\n00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,630\nI mean the guy is admitting that it's his.\n\n156\n00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,250\nBut it doesn't seem the type of stuff\nthat he says should be going on.\n\n157\n00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,650\nRight\n>> According to his beliefs, so\n\n158\n00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,580\nthat was a red flag there.\n\n159\n00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,980\n>> But as far as being able to distribute\nthat, he could send it to friends,\n\n160\n00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,370\nwhatever, throw that thumb drive\nto somebody, have them copy it.\n\n161\n00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,200\nAnd if somebody sees okay,\nso they're trading porn.\n\n162\n00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,250\n>> Yeah\n>> It's something\n\n163\n00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,580\nthat happens all the time.\n\n164\n00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,400\nNothing out of the ordinary, nothing\ncrime related or anything like that.\n\n165\n00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,510\nSo if they hadn't been the center of\nan investigation, and we're looking at\n\n166\n00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,200\neverything in the big picture,\nthat might've never been discovered.\n\n167\n00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,230\n>> Yeah.\n>> It could've been hidden, you know,\n\n168\n00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,040\nso I'll tell you another example,\n\n169\n00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,990\nI remember they think,\nthe last time they weren't sure.\n\n170\n00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,220\nBut for the 9/11 attacks that\noccurred here in the U.S.,\n\n171\n00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,320\nthey believe they were using\na program called Camera Shy,\n\n172\n00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,750\nwhich is basically a plugin for\nInternet Explorer.\n\n173\n00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,560\nNot really a plugin,\nan add-on for Internet Explorer.\n\n174\n00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,760\nThey'll let you browse to web sites, it's\njust like a browser you go to different\n\n175\n00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,520\nweb sites, but if you put the right\npassword into this Camera Shy\n\n176\n00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,870\nbrowser it will display the hidden\nmessages on the pictures on the web site.\n\n177\n00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,100\nSo the Al-Queda, they think these cells\nwere communicating via web sites.\n\n178\n00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,000\nThey had a web site up, just a generic\nwebsite of nothing important,\n\n179\n00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,210\nbunch of images on the website.\n\n180\n00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,510\nAnd if anybody browsed the website,\nit looks like a normal website.\n\n181\n00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,320\nBut if you browse that website using\nCamera Shy with the right password,\n\n182\n00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,830\nyou would see the secret messages that\nhad been embedded in those images.\n\n183\n00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,320\nSo there's another example where\nsteganography, and I'll throw you up,\n\n184\n00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,080\nI think I'll try to throw you\nup a link to that Camera Shy.\n\n185\n00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,040\nIt's kind of a cool little program.\n\n186\n00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,190\nBut another example where steganography\ncan be used to hide information\n\n187\n00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,200\nright there in plain sight.\n\n188\n00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,730\nI mean it was on the world wide web.\n\n189\n00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,260\nIf you didn't know what to look for, and\n\n190\n00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,460\nwhere to look,\nyou would never know it was there.\n\n191\n00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,465\n>> Yeah that's.\n\n192\n00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:09,115\nThat's the thing with this technology,\nand using this technique period,\n\n193\n00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:14,995\nis that to anyone else\nit's just a regular file.\n\n194\n00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:17,980\nThey can go ahead and\nuse, consume or whatever.\n\n195\n00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,890\nBut to someone that's in the know,\nand knows what to look for,\n\n196\n00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,370\nhow to extract that information,\nit becomes something different.\n\n197\n00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,840\nAnd the possibilities are just\namazing with something like this.\n\n198\n00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,990\nAnd it's, that's why it's been used for\nsuch a long time.\n\n199\n00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,580\n>> Right?\n\n200\n00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,670\nAnd James asks out there, would graffiti\nbe considered an example of steganography?\n\n201\n00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,510\nAnd kind of,\nmaybe an analogue steganography?\n\n202\n00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,150\nI mean, cuz I know graffiti can be very,\nit can have hidden messages in it.\n\n203\n00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,550\nIf you don't know what the artist is\ndoing, you might not get that message.\n\n204\n00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,630\nSo maybe a basic analog steganography?\n\n205\n00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,130\n>> Yeah, I would say.\n\n206\n00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,950\nI would go as far as say,\nyeah, absolutely it could.\n\n207\n00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,850\nIt all depends.\n\n208\n00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:09,330\nIf, like you said, someone draws an image,\nand puts special symbols and\n\n209\n00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,310\nstuff like that in it, and\nyou don't know what these symbols mean,\n\n210\n00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,660\nthey just look like part of the artwork or\nwhatever.\n\n211\n00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,700\n>> Then they're hiding\ndata in plain sight.\n\n212\n00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,780\n>> Yeah, there's nothing that's\nsaying that it couldn't be that.\n\n213\n00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:30,560\nI mean heck, look at the one we talked\nabout, the CEH would be a good example.\n\n214\n00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,310\nIt's not graffiti, but\n\n215\n00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,470\nit's something that kinda fits into\nthe world of steganography, just a bit.\n\n216\n00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,240\n>> Is those symbols we put in for\nwar walking.\n\n217\n00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,720\nHow many people actually know what those\nmean outside of what we did there and\n\n218\n00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,350\nthe CEH course?\n\n219\n00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,050\nIf you drew those someplace,\nto someone else that's just, you know,\n\n220\n00:13:53,050 --> 00:14:00,254\na big circle being drawn or\na couple semicircles back-to-back.\n\n221\n00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:03,653\nThey don't know that that's a symbol\nsaying that there's a [CROSSTALK].\n\n222\n00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:06,389\n>> Could be modern art, right.\n\n223\n00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:07,000\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n224\n00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,850\nI'd buy that,\nI don't get modern art either.\n\n225\n00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,820\nSo it could very well be that.\n\n226\n00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,335\nSo yeah there's a lot of\na numerous things like that.\n\n227\n00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think of all the things like,\n\n228\n00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:26,160\nI think of the stuff hidden in art work\nthat some people say is, like, see?\n\n229\n00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,380\nSee that there?\n\n230\n00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,270\nSee what that is?\n\n231\n00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,882\nThat's a symbol for, remember the stuff\nin the In the Denver airport.\n\n232\n00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:33,460\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n233\n00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,020\n[LAUGH]\n>> You guys can look this up.\n\n234\n00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,820\nIt is just It's actually really funny.\n\n235\n00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,465\nI think the airport took the murals down.\n\n236\n00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,170\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Because they finally got tired of\n\n237\n00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,860\npeople saying\n>> Okay, so\n\n238\n00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,810\nwhat is the New World Order coming in?\n\n239\n00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,090\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> You know,\nthat type of stuff.\n\n240\n00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:53,440\nThe airport manager at\nDenver International said that he got so\n\n241\n00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,840\nmany calls on that.\n\n242\n00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,200\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> People claiming that there's a secret\n\n243\n00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,410\nbase hidden under Denver International,\nand\n\n244\n00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,060\nthat there's all these\n>> Special things going on, and\n\n245\n00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,775\nthat's where all the selected\nIlluminati are gonna go.\n\n246\n00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:06,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what it was.\n\n247\n00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,170\n>> Sh, don't tell everybody.\n\n248\n00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,700\n>> Yeah,\nyou're not even supposed to know that.\n\n249\n00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,360\nYeah, I got it on tape now.\n\n250\n00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,240\nThat was it.\n\n251\n00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,670\nBut if you looked, there was some\nmurals that used to be there.\n\n252\n00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,530\nAnd granted, if you ever see those,\nif you ever saw those murals,\n\n253\n00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:23,060\nwhich they are online,\nthe pictures people have of them.\n\n254\n00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,400\nThey are, I'll admit, they're kind of odd.\n\n255\n00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,700\nFor something, first of all,\n\n256\n00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,096\nto put something like those murals in\nan airport was, no I don't know who is\n\n257\n00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:34,995\ninterested in seeing that, and\nthen you look at some of the things.\n\n258\n00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:36,905\nI mean they had stuff in there.\n\n259\n00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:40,075\nThere were people with like gas masks and\ncarrying scimitars.\n\n260\n00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:44,275\nAnd kids crying and a mother,\nher kids in a coffin.\n\n261\n00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:45,935\nSo they had that in there at the airport.\n\n262\n00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:47,345\nI'm like, what?\n\n263\n00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:47,960\n>> Yeah, it was very odd.\n\n264\n00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,261\n>> Yeah and they always try to explain.\n\n265\n00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:51,259\nIt's like, no,\nthis is the renewal of life.\n\n266\n00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:53,267\nAnd how people are gonna have peace and\nall that.\n\n267\n00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:56,989\nI'm like I don't see it,\nI got that someone,\n\n268\n00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:02,908\nwas dropping a little too much acid,\nis what happened in that situation,\n\n269\n00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:07,570\nbut they, since took it down,\nbut you can see it online.\n\n270\n00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,900\nI am not going to say there were\nhidden meanings of symbols,\n\n271\n00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,300\nof how the world's gonna be destroyed,\nand the new world order, and all that.\n\n272\n00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,700\nBut that would kind of it, was one of\nthe things that made me think of it,\n\n273\n00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,130\nbecause you'd always see these TV shows.\n\n274\n00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,980\nGuys that go out there,\ngo, see what that means?\n\n275\n00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,320\nThe guy wearing that over,\nthere is a symbol of that.\n\n276\n00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,276\nAnd that's a code, and\nthis is a code and, yeah, so.\n\n277\n00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:34,360\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so there's\na couple of examples of where we've\n\n278\n00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,010\nseeing Steganography, actually in the real\nworld, involved in crime sometimes.\n\n279\n00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,770\nSo techniques we use for Steganography.\n\n280\n00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,490\nWe can really, we always think of images,\nat least I do.\n\n281\n00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,300\nI know, I think of images when\nI think of Steganography,\n\n282\n00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,250\ncuz it's a very easy one to do.\n\n283\n00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,010\nWe're talking about, and\n\n284\n00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,630\nwe'll talk about how it works here in just\na minute using that least significant bit.\n\n285\n00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,210\nBut pictures aren't the only thing.\n\n286\n00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:03,130\nWe can do these in MP3 files, even in\ntext documents, and things like that.\n\n287\n00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,320\n>> Yeah, it's really, when you get\ndown to it, with Steganography,\n\n288\n00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,020\nSteganography is just hiding something\ninside of something else, and\n\n289\n00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,480\nanything that can fit that criteria.\n\n290\n00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,930\n>> Is gonna be classified as\nSteganography, so just keep that in mind.\n\n291\n00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,960\nImages and now videos are very,\nvery, very common.\n\n292\n00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,410\nBut they're far from being\nthe only ways to do this.\n\n293\n00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:31,810\nThere's plenty of ways to send messages,\nwithout other\n\n294\n00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:37,450\npeople being aware, that they're looking\nright at the message, or that clue.\n\n295\n00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,170\nAnd I would even, kind of,\nextend it out, to say,\n\n296\n00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:46,450\nthe digital side is,\nwhen you are accessing a crime scene.\n\n297\n00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,300\nIt's not unheard of for someone to\nhave something on their desk, or\n\n298\n00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:57,145\na piece of paper, or something,\nthat maybe kind of a hint to them.\n\n299\n00:17:57,145 --> 00:18:03,195\nOr like a hint, or a clue to them to do\nsomething, or to someone else coming by.\n\n300\n00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:06,195\nI've seen that sort of thing.\n\n301\n00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:12,037\nWhere I know of,\nat least one case, where someone's\n\n302\n00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:17,147\npassword would be an object on their desk,\nand\n\n303\n00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:20,810\nthat object was placed\nin a certain location.\n\n304\n00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:26,570\nAnd anyone else, it just looked like, hey\nthere's a box of Altoids, you know, there.\n\n305\n00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,320\nOr there's an eraser sitting there.\n\n306\n00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,205\nNo, that was their password.\n\n307\n00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:34,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And if you looked at it.\n\n308\n00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,300\nAnd other people would look up,\nsee that there, and they might think, oh,\n\n309\n00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,520\nwell the person just set\nthat there on their desk.\n\n310\n00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,520\nSomeone that is a little more tuned into\nthe environment, and paying attention,\n\n311\n00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,860\nI would look at that, I'm not saying,\nI'm some mystical tied into it,\n\n312\n00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,510\nand everything can sense these things,\nbut it just.\n\n313\n00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,650\nYou know, the way this thing was\npositioned, sitting next to a keyboard,\n\n314\n00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,770\njust hanging out there.\n\n315\n00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,360\nAnd it wasn't just one case.\n\n316\n00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,780\nIt was there all the time, and\nit was always in the same position.\n\n317\n00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,240\nIt just indicated that,\neverything else was organized,\n\n318\n00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,840\neverything else has its place, and this is\nsitting right there, just didn't belong,\n\n319\n00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,700\nso there's something about that,\nI may not have known what it was, and\n\n320\n00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,420\nI wasn't gonna be, I didn't immediately\nsay, oh, that's their password, no.\n\n321\n00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,910\nBut there was something about that\nsitting there, so, it was something that\n\n322\n00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,760\nI knew that there's something when\nI took the taking pictures, and\n\n323\n00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,610\ndocumenting make a special note of that.\n\n324\n00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,390\nThere might be some significance there.\n\n325\n00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,280\nWho knows, maybe I'm wrong.\n\n326\n00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,820\nMaybe someone was popping an Altoid,\nand set it there.\n\n327\n00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,800\nI don't know, but\nit just didn't look right.\n\n328\n00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,020\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n329\n00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,480\nYeah, so\nwhen we talking Steganography, really,\n\n330\n00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,200\nthe ways this works is we're looking at,\nusing the least significant bit.\n\n331\n00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,150\nAnd it's one of the reasons, images I\nthink have such a, one of the easier\n\n332\n00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,140\nmediums to use, because we do have\na lot of least significant bits.\n\n333\n00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,330\nWhen we think about a picture,\nif you're using eight bit color, and\n\n334\n00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,630\nI take that last bit, and\nchange it to something else,\n\n335\n00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,260\nthat's going to change that color, and the\npicture's going to look a lot different.\n\n336\n00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,540\nBut we're not dealing\nwith 8 bit color anymore.\n\n337\n00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,410\nWe're talking up to 256 bit color or\nhigher.\n\n338\n00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,670\nSo if you're using 256 bit colors,\nthat means,\n\n339\n00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,270\nyou got 256 bits to describe that color.\n\n340\n00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,680\nIf I change that last one or two bits,\nit's not going to change the color enough.\n\n341\n00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,280\nIt's going to change it between say,\nshades of blue.\n\n342\n00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,140\nBut I'm not going to change it enough,\nthat it's noticeable to the human eye.\n\n343\n00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,450\nSo if you take every pixel in that image,\nevery bit that's describing those pixels,\n\n344\n00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,650\nthose are a lot of bits,\nthat I can use to store my data.\n\n345\n00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,260\nSo that's basically, what we're doing.\n\n346\n00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,200\nIs we're borrowing,\n\n347\n00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,000\nit's almost like your subnetting\nthe bits within this image here.\n\n348\n00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,440\nWe're just borrowing a couple bits\nfrom each one of those pixels, and\n\n349\n00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,560\nstoring our data in there.\n\n350\n00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,270\nAnd it doesn't change the image, enough to\nwhere it's detectable by the human eye.\n\n351\n00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,260\n>> Yeah, that's really it.\n\n352\n00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,960\nAnd that's one of the popular\nways to alter an image,\n\n353\n00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,080\nenough to carry this hidden payload,\nif you will,\n\n354\n00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,470\nis just take those last two bits,\nand use them to carry our message.\n\n355\n00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,890\nJust chop up our message, and\n\n356\n00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:20,550\njust store them across the whole\nimage in those last two bits.\n\n357\n00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,960\nAnd it works quit effectively,\nand remember on this,\n\n358\n00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,450\nif you're thinking that,\nlike if you're saying that,\n\n359\n00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,920\nif you change those last two bits,\nit does change the color.\n\n360\n00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,870\nBut the color is not something's\nthat's detectable by the human eye.\n\n361\n00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,370\nWell.\n\n362\n00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,940\n>> And how many shades of blue are there,\nand can we tell\n\n363\n00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,560\nthe difference between two shades of blue,\nthat are only different by one bit?\n\n364\n00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,600\nAnd not if your doing like I said,\n256 bit color.\n\n365\n00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,560\nIf it's 4 bit color, yeah, that one\nbit is going to make a big difference.\n\n366\n00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,280\nBut in 256 bit,\nnot going to really alter it.\n\n367\n00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,110\nAnd that goes to James' question there.\n\n368\n00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,000\nA video, seen as noise or\ncompletely hidden.\n\n369\n00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,400\nFor the most part, it would probably\nnot show any difference in the video.\n\n370\n00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,960\nYou're probably not\ngonna notice it at all.\n\n371\n00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,410\n>> Yeah, if don't right,\nit's not gonna show any difference.\n\n372\n00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,760\nYou're just gonna see a video,\nlike you always would.\n\n373\n00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,370\nIf you saw noise, that would,\nthat's gonna kinda clue, people in that,\n\n374\n00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,670\nthere's something with that.\n\n375\n00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,640\nSo you don't want any\nof those over traces.\n\n376\n00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,480\nYou want everything\nunderneath the surface,\n\n377\n00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,335\nwhere you can't, well you can't see it.\n\n378\n00:22:29,335 --> 00:22:29,875\nIt's just-\n>> Yeah.\n\n379\n00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,355\n>> It's just completely out of sight,\nout of mind.\n\n380\n00:22:32,355 --> 00:22:35,745\n>> What could happen,\nis if your media was too small.\n\n381\n00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:38,615\nLet's say that video is\nonly a couple minutes long.\n\n382\n00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:42,955\nAnd I'm trying to shove the entire\nEncyclopedia Britannica in there.\n\n383\n00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:44,985\nWell now,\nI'm gonna have to take too many bits, and\n\n384\n00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:46,765\nI could start generating that noise.\n\n385\n00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,225\nSo, we gotta make sure,\nthat what these bad guys do,\n\n386\n00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:51,870\nis they make sure that the medium\nis big enough to handle.\n\n387\n00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,070\nThe data they're trying to store in there,\nwithout altering the original,\n\n388\n00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,820\nor making it visibly noticeable,\nand so that's what they do,\n\n389\n00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,820\nis they'll just get a bigger, depending\non the payload, they're trying to store\n\n390\n00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,000\nin there, make sure that medium\nis large enough to hold it.\n\n391\n00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,850\nYeah, that's definitely the case.\n\n392\n00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,990\nAnd you've also gotta think of the fact,\ntalking about images,\n\n393\n00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,810\nand with video, if someone suspects\nthere's an alteration to it,\n\n394\n00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:21,630\nthere might be little things\nthat pop up now and then.\n\n395\n00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,060\nIt's possible.\n\n396\n00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:29,080\nBut if you look at for example, an image\nand someone's making those changes to it,\n\n397\n00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,140\nyou kind of, think of,\nwell the human eye can't detect it.\n\n398\n00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,920\nSo the human eye can't\ndetect these things,\n\n399\n00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,950\nwell what about a computer,\ncan a computer detect it?\n\n400\n00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,570\nWell a computer, yeah, it can, It can\nperceive those different shades of color.\n\n401\n00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,855\nIt's reading the values off of it.\n\n402\n00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:48,875\nSo it very clearly can.\n\n403\n00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,895\n>> Especially if I have the original.\n\n404\n00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:51,499\n>> There you go.\n\n405\n00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:53,716\n>> An unknown,\nunaltered copy of the original.\n\n406\n00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:55,353\nAnd I can compare it bit by bit.\n\n407\n00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:57,635\nThe computer is going to go and say whoa,\n\n408\n00:23:57,635 --> 00:24:00,580\nI can see all those bits\nthat have been modified.\n\n409\n00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,960\nAnd we can start extracting those out.\n\n410\n00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,130\nIn fact, I think that's what\na lot of these tools do\n\n411\n00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,960\nthat we're going to look at.\n\n412\n00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,185\nThat do the steganography discovery.\n\n413\n00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:11,010\n[LAUGH] James,\nyeah I do remember that episode.\n\n414\n00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,450\nVery similar,\nwhere in Star Trek where sent the [LAUGH]\n\n415\n00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,685\nbackground noise as a message\nto the Enterprise, yeah.\n\n416\n00:24:17,685 --> 00:24:18,606\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As they sent this\n\n417\n00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:21,357\nmessage like in the background\nnoise of the universe.\n\n418\n00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:22,155\nYeah, it was pretty cool.\n\n419\n00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:24,080\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n420\n00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,070\n>> But so yeah, there you go.\n\n421\n00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,935\nSee, steganography is still used in\nthe 28th century or whatever they're from.\n\n422\n00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,410\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know they're going to fix that\n\n423\n00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,270\naround for you.\n\n424\n00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,809\nThey're going to be like\nno it was the 20th.\n\n425\n00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:37,316\n>> It was 22, 24,\nI think I can't remember for sure.\n\n426\n00:24:37,316 --> 00:24:41,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But yeah, so another example.\n\n427\n00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,990\nSo we just used that least MP3 files\nare another one that are used commonly.\n\n428\n00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:50,210\nBecause the human ear,\nit only has a certain audible range and\n\n429\n00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,440\nif I can get music.\n\n430\n00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,130\nAlthough MP3s being compressed does\nmake it a little bit more difficult.\n\n431\n00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,100\nBut we can start hitting those areas\nthat are outside of the normal range.\n\n432\n00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,820\nOr if I chop off a few high,\neven if you can hear them.\n\n433\n00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,820\nIf I chop off some of the highs on that\nsong, you're probably not gonna notice it.\n\n434\n00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,572\nUnless you're some super audiophile that\nknows the song intimately, you're probably\n\n435\n00:25:12,572 --> 00:25:17,183\nnot gonna notice a few notes missing\nup there at that high end or low end.\n\n436\n00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:22,680\n>> Yeah, that would be one way they'd hide\nit in there, is by using that extra range.\n\n437\n00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,850\nAnother one they'll do\nis introduce a mild echo\n\n438\n00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,360\nthat you really can't perceive at all.\n\n439\n00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,982\nSo, as far as you're concerned,\nyou're just hearing the music,\n\n440\n00:25:34,982 --> 00:25:38,563\nyou're not hearing this\necho that's introduced.\n\n441\n00:25:38,563 --> 00:25:41,477\nAnd the echo doesn't\neven sound like an echo,\n\n442\n00:25:41,477 --> 00:25:45,510\nit's basically just a minor\noffset of the original wave.\n\n443\n00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,676\nAnd they use that wave to carry the data.\n\n444\n00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:51,253\nSo as far as, for\nall intents and purposes,\n\n445\n00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:54,660\nit sounds identical to the original.\n\n446\n00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,250\nIf you did an audio analysis of it,\nwho knows?\n\n447\n00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,045\nYou might think it's someone\njust got a crappy MP3.\n\n448\n00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:02,805\n>> Exactly, that's the way to put it.\n\n449\n00:26:02,805 --> 00:26:06,660\n>> Quit downloading your\nstuff from Pirate Bay.\n\n450\n00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,635\n>> And thank you James,\n24th century that was it.\n\n451\n00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:12,230\n>> I saw that pop up, boom right there.\n\n452\n00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,800\n>> Next generation.\n\n453\n00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,420\nI knew somebody would have that info for\nme.\n\n454\n00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,170\nSo yeah, lots of different ways\nwe can hide that information.\n\n455\n00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:22,030\nText, in text a lot of times we're\nusing some of the white space\n\n456\n00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,290\nyou know the white space\nwithin that document.\n\n457\n00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,080\n>> Yeah in text,\n\n458\n00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,930\nusing the white space to hide things\nhas proven to be very very effective.\n\n459\n00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:34,730\nBecause you could very easily\ntake the space in the blinds and\n\n460\n00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,920\nbetween characters and\nuse those to hide information in.\n\n461\n00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,200\nAnd people just aren't gonna see that.\n\n462\n00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,280\nAnd if they do see it,\nif they do Inadvertently,\n\n463\n00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,340\nbecause there are some methods\nof doing this that will show up.\n\n464\n00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,450\nBut the general person that sees\nthat is gonna say whatever.\n\n465\n00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,560\nBecause one of the ways of\npicking it up is sometimes if you\n\n466\n00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,120\nhighlight all the text,\n\n467\n00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,200\nyou'll see that there's other blocks\nthat are just blank that nothing's in.\n\n468\n00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,366\nAnd it just, it looks weird.\n\n469\n00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:12,045\nWell it looks weird because there's\nactually stuff being hidden there,\n\n470\n00:27:12,045 --> 00:27:13,790\nbut they're not visible.\n\n471\n00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,556\nSo therefore when someone sees it,\nit's like I don't know what that is,\n\n472\n00:27:17,556 --> 00:27:20,150\nit's just a computer glitch [CROSSTALK]\n>> Who's even gonna notice?\n\n473\n00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,498\nI open up a Word document,\nI do a Ctrl+A and\n\n474\n00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:26,613\nwho's gonna notice that after every\nsentence, that the character turn,\n\n475\n00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:30,880\nthere's actually a highlighted portion\nof nothing there that it selected.\n\n476\n00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,640\nI probably wouldn't even notice that,\nhonestly.\n\n477\n00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,320\nUnless I'm a forensic investigator and\nI'm trained to look for that kinda thing.\n\n478\n00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,357\n>> Yeah you'd start, when you get into\nthis kinda things you start training your\n\n479\n00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:47,950\nmind to say that just doesn't, that's out\nof place, that just doesn't look right.\n\n480\n00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,860\nMaybe I should do a little\nfurther investigation on that,\n\n481\n00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,620\nsee if there is something there.\n\n482\n00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,259\nAnd like I was saying when we opened,\n\n483\n00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:00,696\nthere are tools that can make\nthat detection process easier.\n\n484\n00:28:00,696 --> 00:28:02,367\nSo you don't have to go through and\n\n485\n00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:06,530\ntry all these special techniques manually\nto see if there's something there.\n\n486\n00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:12,020\nThere are things that can find yeah, there\nwas a tool at work here that we need to go\n\n487\n00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:18,230\nand dig in more to see\nwhat that actually is.\n\n488\n00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:23,975\n>> Just think what I could do with\nthat hour long loop of Nyan Cat?\n\n489\n00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:27,230\n[LAUGH] I could fit a lot\nof data in there right?\n\n490\n00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,895\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'll tell you what ladies and\n\n491\n00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:33,215\ngentleman, its about time to step away and\ntake a break so we are going to do that.\n\n492\n00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:37,235\nWhen we come back we're going to\ncontinue on with our steganography.\n\n493\n00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:39,029\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n494\n00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:46,297\n[MUSIC]\n\n495\n00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:48,140\n>> All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n496\n00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,300\nSo continuing on with our steganography.\n\n497\n00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:55,190\nLet's take a look at some of the different\ntools that we could use to perform, and or\n\n498\n00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,760\ndiscover, some steganography.\n\n499\n00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,232\n>> Yes, there is lots of tools\nto do this by the way and\n\n500\n00:29:03,232 --> 00:29:09,316\ntechniques that can be employed to\nhigh stuff inside other things.\n\n501\n00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:16,329\nWe are going to take a look at a couple\nof them here or talk about few or more.\n\n502\n00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:19,210\nAnd to kinda give you\nan idea what's out there.\n\n503\n00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,988\nSome of these things you may have seen in\nother areas and got some practice with.\n\n504\n00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:28,360\nBut we're kinda going to make sure\nwe're all on the same playing field.\n\n505\n00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,040\nAnd see what that means\nto do steganography.\n\n506\n00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,219\nAnd we're going to examine some of these.\n\n507\n00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,390\nSo the one I kinda want to show\nyou is just one that employs\n\n508\n00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:43,160\nsteganography as it relates to texts\n\n509\n00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,980\nbecause we know about that we can\ndo with images and stuff like that.\n\n510\n00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,950\nAnd actually for images,\n\n511\n00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,470\nthere's a lot of tools out there\nthat will do this with an image.\n\n512\n00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:59,960\nSo you can pretty much use Google and\nfind a bunch of tools for doing that.\n\n513\n00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,134\nAnd one of the ones I mentioned in\nthe CEH class, that I've also got here,\n\n514\n00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:10,727\nis that Invisible Secrets,\nwhich is an old favorite.\n\n515\n00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,180\n>> Right.\n\n516\n00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,300\n>> It's been around for a while.\n\n517\n00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:19,930\nIt works really nicely, it's really\nsimple, and it's proven to be popular.\n\n518\n00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:25,810\nAs we're going to learn, though,\nbeing a tool that's popular in\n\n519\n00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:31,420\nthis area if you're trying to evade is\nsomething that's gonna work against you.\n\n520\n00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,420\nSo we have yet to talk about that.\n\n521\n00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,960\nBut do remember that is that there are,\nfor a forensic person,\n\n522\n00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,070\nthese tools that are proving more popular,\nthat works for us.\n\n523\n00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:49,810\nIf you're someone that's trying to hide\ninformation, that can work against you.\n\n524\n00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,069\nSo just remember that.\n\n525\n00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:55,302\nBut so we got Invisible Secrets.\n\n526\n00:30:55,302 --> 00:30:59,760\nAnother one that I've noted\nhere that we saw before and\n\n527\n00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,090\nI'll do something different on\nit is one called Spam Mimic.\n\n528\n00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:09,900\nThat's one I have up on my screen\nhere that you may recall from CEH.\n\n529\n00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,830\nBut what I'm going to do here is Spam\nMimic, the version of it I showed in CEH.\n\n530\n00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:23,130\nIt's the page on the site I showed\nin CEH converts your message to\n\n531\n00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,540\nsome very authentic looking spam message.\n\n532\n00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,309\nIt always sounds weird to\nsay authentic looking spam.\n\n533\n00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,375\n>> Right.\n\n534\n00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,280\n[LAUGH]\n>> Like there's different levels of it.\n\n535\n00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,730\nOh, that's a fake spam.\n\n536\n00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,270\nI want an authentic one,\nlike you're collecting them or something.\n\n537\n00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,921\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, like commemorative plates or\n\n538\n00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:41,961\nsomething like that, I don't know.\n\n539\n00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:47,232\nBut what you have here is\nyou have Spam Mimic and\n\n540\n00:31:47,232 --> 00:31:53,863\nI chose the option on it to do\nwhat they call a fake Russian.\n\n541\n00:31:53,863 --> 00:32:00,540\nIn here, so I can type in a message\ninto this, and say, hello World.\n\n542\n00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:06,200\nAnd say encode, and what it will do,\nis it will do something.\n\n543\n00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,210\nWell, I guess Fake Russian\nisn't too different from\n\n544\n00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,160\nEnglish right there,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n545\n00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,190\n>> But maybe not the best choice of words\n\n546\n00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,510\nthere, but if you go, and decode that,\nit'll decode it back to this,\n\n547\n00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:25,370\nmaybe give it something\na little more interesting.\n\n548\n00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,775\nLet's see, hello world,\nthis is a hidden message.\n\n549\n00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:31,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n550\n00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,830\n>> Cut it.\n\n551\n00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,500\nIt's still a little of that.\n\n552\n00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,250\nThat could also be, by the way, code pages\nor whatever I have loaded on my system.\n\n553\n00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,350\nIt could be something to do with that.\n\n554\n00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:49,020\nThat's not coming out with all the\ndifferent characters, and stuff like that.\n\n555\n00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,280\nBut the thing is, is that you'll\nplay with a tool like this, or\n\n556\n00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,410\nuse one of the other tools\nthat are on this site.\n\n557\n00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:02,340\nYou could, you know very well,\nhide information in such a way\n\n558\n00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:07,310\nthat someone can look right at it,\nand not be seeing it.\n\n559\n00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:11,720\nYou know that they have on this site,\nwe go, and try one of the other tools they\n\n560\n00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,140\nhave, just to kind of show you,\nso that's the fake Russian one.\n\n561\n00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,680\nIf we got to encode.\n\n562\n00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,040\nThis just brings up the one,\nthat says, okay, well,\n\n563\n00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,840\ndo you want to do a short message?\n\n564\n00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,320\nYeah, I'll just do the hello world,\none here.\n\n565\n00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,440\nThis is the one, it's the same\nsample that I did in CEH course.\n\n566\n00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,690\nI type in my short message,\nand then hit encode.\n\n567\n00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,060\nAnd boom, there's a spam message\nbeing generated off of it.\n\n568\n00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,750\nAnd, my two word phrase is\nactually hidden in there.\n\n569\n00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:52,730\nAnd just use an algorithm to embed it,\nwithin this actual spam message.\n\n570\n00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,530\nAnd I could easily go,\nand I could've copied and\n\n571\n00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:01,360\npasted it back in, but I can just hit the\ncode, and it will reverse, and say, hey,\n\n572\n00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,510\nthere’s original message, bridge the gap.\n\n573\n00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,460\n>> Nice, so\nburied within that entire message,\n\n574\n00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:12,080\nwas just a nice quick little secret\npassword to kind of share with somebody,\n\n575\n00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,290\nor some bit of information that you want\nto share right there in plain sight.\n\n576\n00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,410\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n577\n00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,150\nYou've got it right there.\n\n578\n00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,060\nYou'll notice by the way,\nI think they have bottom over,\n\n579\n00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,710\nwell they have another option\nover here to hide it as\n\n580\n00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:34,680\nspam with a password, which is\nanother interesting level to this.\n\n581\n00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,320\nIs that when you spoke about passwords.\n\n582\n00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,010\nWhat if you wanted to take it to\nthe next level, and make it, so\n\n583\n00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,910\nsomeone did find that message?\n\n584\n00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:46,630\nNow they've got to have a password\nto unlock that message.\n\n585\n00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,610\nJust another layer of protection for you,\n\n586\n00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:52,180\nas someone that is trying\nto slip something by,\n\n587\n00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:57,190\nyou can put that there, as a way to give\nthem something else to work through.\n\n588\n00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,190\nAnd so they have that option here.\n\n589\n00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,790\nSo that's just doing.\n\n590\n00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,130\nSteganography with text, and\nthey also, by the way, do have\n\n591\n00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:13,010\nthis other option here\nto create a message.\n\n592\n00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,130\nI can say, hello world again, up here,\n\n593\n00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:22,910\nthat's my message I want to hide,\nand then I can say,\n\n594\n00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:27,740\nthis is some text that I\n\n595\n00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:34,878\nam going to use as a carrier.\n\n596\n00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:39,570\nOkay, so nothing really thought provoking.\n\n597\n00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,550\nIf that's not good enough for you,\nby the way, they also have this thing,\n\n598\n00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,730\nit says get a random\npage from a classic book.\n\n599\n00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,674\n>> Nice.\n>> If you want to-\n\n600\n00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:46,983\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n601\n00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:49,180\n>> If you want to feel,\n\n602\n00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,520\nall fancy and stuff.\n\n603\n00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,970\n>> Right.\n>> So, you can,\n\n604\n00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:00,170\nonce you do that, you can click encode,\nand the text is there.\n\n605\n00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,250\nIt took that hello world,\nthat secret text, and embedded it in here.\n\n606\n00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,020\nBut you'll notice, if I highlight it,\nlook, highlight all that text I had,\n\n607\n00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:12,360\nmy innocent looking text, but\nyou know, there's that extra stuff.\n\n608\n00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,560\nThere's nothing there that we can see.\n\n609\n00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,850\nSo other people might look at that,\nand say, oh whatever.\n\n610\n00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,640\n>> And not think two things about it.\n\n611\n00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,120\n>> Yeah, it's not something that's\nunusual for someone to see,\n\n612\n00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,360\nwhen they highlight a document.\n\n613\n00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,318\nTo see things like that.\n\n614\n00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:32,780\nSo they would, average Joe,\njust might shine that off, and say,\n\n615\n00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:39,450\nokay, that's nothing, it's something that\nWindows, whatever, this program is doing.\n\n616\n00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:45,060\nPeople have gotten kind of used to,\nsomething happens, eh, it's not unusual.\n\n617\n00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,660\n>> That's the thing, most people\nlook at it, as some kind of glitch.\n\n618\n00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,670\nI don't know computers,\nI don't understand software.\n\n619\n00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,990\nWho knows what the heck it's doing?\n\n620\n00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,470\nI don't really care, and\nnot think two things about it, and\n\n621\n00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:57,528\njust accept it as probably some\nkind of glitch, and no big deal.\n\n622\n00:36:57,528 --> 00:37:02,560\nYeah, so we can dump stuff in images,\nwe can dump stuff in text, and\n\n623\n00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,200\nyou know what, Jason, I was gonna try to\nbring up real quick, if can jump in here,\n\n624\n00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,640\nI'll pull up QuickStego One, two, two?\n\n625\n00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,570\nThank you, Sir.\n\n626\n00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,070\nSorry, doing this on the fly here guys.\n\n627\n00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:19,860\nWhat I was gonna show you,\nif I can pull this up, another example.\n\n628\n00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,790\nThis is a free program, Quickstego, and\nit gives you an example of Steganography.\n\n629\n00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,980\nAnd all I have to do is go find an image.\n\n630\n00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,769\nSo I'm just gonna say, open up an image.\n\n631\n00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,625\nAnd hopefully, I don't have anything\nreally bad on my computer here.\n\n632\n00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,376\n[LAUGH] We shall see.\n\n633\n00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:42,080\nWe'll grab my ITPROTV wallpaper here.\n\n634\n00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,330\nAll right, so there's my image.\n\n635\n00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,560\nAnd all I've gotta do is insert my text.\n\n636\n00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,680\nAnd so I'll say,\nwhat are we going to do today, Pinkea?\n\n637\n00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,250\nWe're gonna, what are we gonna do?\n\n638\n00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,990\nWe're gonna take over the world.\n\n639\n00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,992\n>> Oh, that's a reference tree, go for it.\n\n640\n00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:03,451\n[LAUGH]\n>> Take over the world.\n\n641\n00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:08,180\nI know that's not exactly quoting\nthe brain there, but it's close enough.\n\n642\n00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,020\nThen I'm gonna click Hide Text.\n\n643\n00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,870\nText message is now hidden in the image.\n\n644\n00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,070\nAnd then I'm going to save.\n\n645\n00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:21,900\nLet's see, we'll save that,\noh, not the text, sorry.\n\n646\n00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,620\nLet me get that out of there.\n\n647\n00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,980\nSo I'll just save my image, and I'm gonna\ndump it out on my desktop, make it nice,\n\n648\n00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,640\nand easy to find.\n\n649\n00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,360\nSo at this point,\n\n650\n00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,410\nI had this image, and if I double click\non this image, it opens up just fine.\n\n651\n00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:40,310\nI don't see anything different on\nthis image, or there's no way for\n\n652\n00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:45,090\nme to tell If I zoom in, I'm not seeing\nany, and granted that's not a very big\n\n653\n00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:51,250\nmessage obviously, but I don't see any\nobvious pixelation or anything like that.\n\n654\n00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,410\nSo for now, if I go back, and we'll just\nexit out of this to make it look real.\n\n655\n00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:59,159\nWe'll open up Quickstego,\nwe'll go find our image.\n\n656\n00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,590\nAnd on my desktop, I've got my wallpaper.\n\n657\n00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,530\nAnd there is my hidden message.\n\n658\n00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,620\nAs just, an example of Steganography in\naction, where we're taking something,\n\n659\n00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,730\nand in this case,\ndumping it inside an image.\n\n660\n00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,380\nSo, there's another look at,\nwe saw dumping it into text files.\n\n661\n00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,370\nAs the way you can dump it into an image.\n\n662\n00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,960\nAnd this is a free tool,\nthat you go download called QuickStego,\n\n663\n00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,280\nif you want to go play around with it.\n\n664\n00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,710\nThis one,\nit doesn't offer any password protection.\n\n665\n00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,660\nNormally, I would want to\nmaybe password protect this.\n\n666\n00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,525\nA lot of the programs will allow\nme to put a password in, so\n\n667\n00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:41,648\neven if you had a Steganography, if you\nknew I put something there in QuickStego,\n\n668\n00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:42,751\nyou could open it up.\n\n669\n00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:44,791\nBut if you didn't know\nthe password to type in,\n\n670\n00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:47,035\nyou wouldn't be able to\nretrieve that hidden data.\n\n671\n00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:52,609\n>> Yeah, and that is the thing, is that,\nyou do want to make it in such a way that.\n\n672\n00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:58,417\nIf someone you know does get lucky,\nand is able to detect that image or\n\n673\n00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:02,925\nthat file whatever you have,\nhas been manipulated,\n\n674\n00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:08,800\nthat they can't just easily\ncruise right in and extract it.\n\n675\n00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,680\nA lot of steganography,\nwe'll say the professional grade ones,\n\n676\n00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,920\nyou know the ones that we're using.\n\n677\n00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,960\nAre pretty just proof of concept,\nstuff like that,\n\n678\n00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,930\nI don't know if that falls under\nthe same thing, I would think it would.\n\n679\n00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,620\nSpam Mimic does.\n\n680\n00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,780\nThe ones that are more industrial grade,\nI guess is a better way to put it.\n\n681\n00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,380\nThose ones do include password capability,\nand\n\n682\n00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,570\nthen they also include encryption,\ncompression, and then they password it.\n\n683\n00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:44,810\nSo now you've got multiple\nlayers to go through\n\n684\n00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:49,870\nbefore you can read that message, and that\nis not including the fact that you have\n\n685\n00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:54,960\nto detect it in the first place,\nwhich is a very tricky process.\n\n686\n00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,020\nWhat would you do if Mike\ntook that image that he just\n\n687\n00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:05,035\nimbedded something in, and\nthrew it in a folder of 100 other images.\n\n688\n00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:06,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n689\n00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,330\n>> How would you even know to look there?\n\n690\n00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,930\nOr, you'd basically have to go\nthrough each one and double check it.\n\n691\n00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,520\nAnd that's a tedious process.\n\n692\n00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,090\n>> Yep.\n\n693\n00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,400\n>> Or\nit can be without the right software.\n\n694\n00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,020\nYeah, that is definitely the thing, and\n\n695\n00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,900\neven the software is only\ngonna help you so far.\n\n696\n00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,950\nYou might really have to peel your,\nor roll your sleeves back,\n\n697\n00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,785\nand get your hands dirty to\nreally pick these things up.\n\n698\n00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:32,365\nThe average Joe,\nif you told him that there's something\n\n699\n00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:38,085\nin those files that's suspicious,\nor needs to be investigated.\n\n700\n00:41:38,085 --> 00:41:41,207\nThey're just going to use it in Windows.\n\n701\n00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,007\nThey might very well use\nWindows built in image viewer.\n\n702\n00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:47,197\nDouble click on the first one,\nand just keep hitting the button\n\n703\n00:41:47,197 --> 00:41:50,417\nto move to the next image,\nto the next image, to the next image.\n\n704\n00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:53,513\nAnd they might scrutinize everything and\nthey\n\n705\n00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:57,413\nmight come back to you with some notes\ntelling you hey, this is what I found.\n\n706\n00:41:57,413 --> 00:42:01,723\nThis person has a pool, and they drive\na car, and the license plate is this.\n\n707\n00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:10,101\nThey're missing the fact that,\nthat's just what they call it cover text.\n\n708\n00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:15,841\nThey are not digging below the surface\nwhere the actual bad stuff is.\n\n709\n00:42:15,841 --> 00:42:21,000\nSo that is something that\nthe average Joe is gonna see or\n\n710\n00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,920\nsomeone that's not aware of steganography.\n\n711\n00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,750\nAnd, trust me, there's quite a few people\nthat do not know about steganography.\n\n712\n00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,610\nYou talk about the process,\nand their eyes open wide.\n\n713\n00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,570\nIt's like, is that possible?\n\n714\n00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:38,830\nThey'll start playing around with it and\ngo oh, this is really interesting.\n\n715\n00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:42,620\nBut they may forget about it,\ncuz it's not something you use every day.\n\n716\n00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,310\nBut it's been out there for ages.\n\n717\n00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:50,350\nBut something as a forensic investigator,\nyou can't afford to forget it,\n\n718\n00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:54,150\nbecause they guys that you're dealing\nwith, they probably haven't forgot.\n\n719\n00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,440\nEspecially if they are actively\ntrying to thwart what you're doing.\n\n720\n00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,650\nThese would be very good techniques\nto actively thwart detection.\n\n721\n00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,830\nSo we have to kind of up our game,\nand know that it's there.\n\n722\n00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:10,730\nAnd then, we have to employ techniques,\nthat make it as quick and as\n\n723\n00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:14,740\nefficient as possible to find it, cuz that\ninformation could be time-sensitive, too.\n\n724\n00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:20,070\nIf you go back to the example I\ntalked about in the first segment\n\n725\n00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:25,230\nof the individual they caught in Germany,\nthat was trying to recruit\n\n726\n00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:31,944\npeople into al-Qaeda at that point,\nthat's time-sensitive.\n\n727\n00:43:31,944 --> 00:43:37,310\nIf you were trying to manually find that,\nand you found\n\n728\n00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:41,580\na file that was suspected, and then tried\nto do this careful analysis manually.\n\n729\n00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,350\nAnd just try and do your thing,\n\n730\n00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:48,960\nyou might eventually find it, or you\nmight eventually extract the information.\n\n731\n00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,700\nThe question is, by the time you\nextract it, has something blown up, and\n\n732\n00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,130\npeople gotten killed or injured?\n\n733\n00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,490\nThat could be part of it.\n\n734\n00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:00,330\nSo we have to have tools that\nare more efficient in doing this.\n\n735\n00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:01,960\nAnd fortunately, we do.\n\n736\n00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,550\nWe have a lot of tool techniques that\nhave been developed over the years.\n\n737\n00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:12,040\nTo pick up this type of thing and\nhelp us retrieve this faster.\n\n738\n00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,690\n>> Earlier you called this steganalysis.\n\n739\n00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:19,240\nSo steganalysis is the alta of\ntrying to discover stenography,\n\n740\n00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,460\nwhether it's in images or texts, or\nvideos, or mp3 files, or what have you.\n\n741\n00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,830\nSo we are going to analyze these\nfiles looking for Hidden data.\n\n742\n00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,210\n>> Yeah, that's really it.\n\n743\n00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:37,080\nWhat we're doing is we are taking\nthat file, whatever it is,\n\n744\n00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,550\nand bringing it in and running any\none of a number of methods on it,\n\n745\n00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:46,050\ndesigned to specifically\ndetect that hidden payload.\n\n746\n00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,870\nOr suspected hidden payloads.\n\n747\n00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,170\nSometimes they do get false positives.\n\n748\n00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,310\nThat absolutely does occur.\n\n749\n00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:53,730\nBut what we're trying to do,\n\n750\n00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:59,220\nis use these things to find that\nsuspected carrier, and then dig\n\n751\n00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,018\ninside to see is there something in there\nthat needs to be further investigated.\n\n752\n00:45:03,018 --> 00:45:06,712\nEverything a steganalysis looks for\n\n753\n00:45:06,712 --> 00:45:12,380\ntell tale signatures, or\npatterns, or anomalies.\n\n754\n00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,940\nSomething with that file,\nthat hints that there's more below\n\n755\n00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:22,610\nthe surface than that\nactually should be there.\n\n756\n00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:26,430\nThere's not just color information there,\nthere's not just audio information there,\n\n757\n00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,680\nthere's not metadata there.\n\n758\n00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,400\nIt's something up and above all of that.\n\n759\n00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,370\nAnd so, these tools analyze that and\n\n760\n00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:40,150\ntell you hey, this stuff shouldn't\nbe here, or it's out of place.\n\n761\n00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,390\nAnd do you want to do\na further investigation on it?\n\n762\n00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:46,730\nAnd that can be a huge time saver,\n\n763\n00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:52,310\nwhen you have a folder full of images or\nvideos, or what have you.\n\n764\n00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:55,010\nIt's gonna save you a lot of\ntime to have these things,\n\n765\n00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,728\nbecause you just can't\ndo everything manually.\n\n766\n00:45:57,728 --> 00:46:04,430\nEspecially, you know, if I want to\nmake it difficult on you, by hiding\n\n767\n00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:09,940\ninformation, by information, basically\nneedle in a haystack type of thing.\n\n768\n00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:15,810\nI could be really nasty about it\n,and make your job a big problem,\n\n769\n00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,810\nand you see them hide it in everything.\n\n770\n00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,250\nYou can see the social\nengineering play in there too.\n\n771\n00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,380\nIf you see it enough, you can see\nthe social engineering aspect of it.\n\n772\n00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,620\nYou see these situations\nwhere someone will take\n\n773\n00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,950\ntheir child's photo, and\nthey'll hide something inside of it.\n\n774\n00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:34,800\n>> Oh that's just wrong.\n\n775\n00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,510\n>> Yeah, it does.\n\n776\n00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,195\n>> Inside your kid's photos, come on.\n\n777\n00:46:37,195 --> 00:46:40,043\n>> Yeah, there's something with it and\nyou know.\n\n778\n00:46:40,043 --> 00:46:47,090\nI know you're kidding around about it,\nbut there is psychological thing,\n\n779\n00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:52,848\nthey wouldn't do that with kids photo,\nbut look, it's their daughter and\n\n780\n00:46:52,848 --> 00:46:57,565\neveryhing in there so, yeah,\nlet's go on to something else.\n\n781\n00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:58,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n782\n00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,110\n>> They may have just played you.\n\n783\n00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,840\n>> Yeah.\n>> They may have just played you, and\n\n784\n00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,630\nsaid okay,\nwell you're focused on that surface image.\n\n785\n00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,060\nAnd it looks all innocent and everything.\n\n786\n00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,580\nAnd mentally you're like,\nthat's probably not there and moved on.\n\n787\n00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:15,515\nYou're looking for\nsomething that might be just out of place.\n\n788\n00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:17,890\nAnd so you move past that.\n\n789\n00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:21,270\nYou move past the family photos,\nand all of those things,\n\n790\n00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,210\nand say,\noh let's go look at another folder.\n\n791\n00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:28,030\nNow, go back to that one,\nthat's exactly what the attacker, or\n\n792\n00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,930\nperson outside and\nstuff wanted you to think.\n\n793\n00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,860\nThey hid it in something that\nthey didn't think you'd look at.\n\n794\n00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,952\nIt's very innocuous looking.\n\n795\n00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:40,325\nAnd therefore it just passed\nright under your nose.\n\n796\n00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:42,887\n>> Yeah, and so, you know,\nlooking for the data, looking for\n\n797\n00:47:42,887 --> 00:47:44,935\nwhere they might have hid that data.\n\n798\n00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:48,559\nAnother thing we can do is look for\nthe tools we use to hide the data, right?\n\n799\n00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,641\n>> Yes, there are a good amount\nof tools out here for this, and\n\n800\n00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:54,448\nthat's the great thing.\n\n801\n00:47:54,448 --> 00:48:00,672\nThese tools are all designed to\nreally speed up this process and\n\n802\n00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:08,200\nmake it more practical to do this type\nof analysis on whatever data you have.\n\n803\n00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,810\nThere's some of the ones in here,\n\n804\n00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:15,350\nthe methods in here are designed towards\nspecific types of content or carriers.\n\n805\n00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:20,440\nAnd so they'll target those ones,\nand get the fingerprints and\n\n806\n00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,130\ntelltale signs off of that, and\nthey won't work with the others.\n\n807\n00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:31,960\nBut usually you can find tools that will\nwork with really any type of content.\n\n808\n00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,940\nBut if it's images you've\ngot lots of those.\n\n809\n00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,630\nLots of those.\n\n810\n00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:40,420\n>> And if I see camera why installed\non their computer or QuickStego or\n\n811\n00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,300\nsomething like that.\n\n812\n00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,860\nTools that we use to do the hiding\nof the information and the data.\n\n813\n00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,785\nThat's a good indication that I need to\ntake a closer look at some of these data\n\n814\n00:48:47,785 --> 00:48:48,810\nfiles, right?\n\n815\n00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:51,960\nNow I'm thinking, wait,\nthis guy knows about steganography.\n\n816\n00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,220\nI've got this folder\nfull of pictures here,\n\n817\n00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,960\nmaybe I need to take a closer\nlook at some of that stuff.\n\n818\n00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,710\nSeeing the fact that they\nare using the tools might give us\n\n819\n00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,620\nan indication that there is\nsome stagnography going on.\n\n820\n00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:07,390\n>> Yeah,\nyou bring up a good point with that, yeah.\n\n821\n00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:11,855\nThere is something on that system\nthat that does the sort of thing\n\n822\n00:49:11,855 --> 00:49:15,970\nthen you should start to question\nwhat were they doing with it?\n\n823\n00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,830\nBut let's ask ourselves, is it an attack\nor would they leave that there?\n\n824\n00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,290\nSomeone's doing this maliciously would\n\n825\n00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:23,750\nthey that leave there\nafter they've done it?\n\n826\n00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,190\nThey mighty very well uninstall it.\n\n827\n00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,470\nOkay, so they've uninstalled it.\n\n828\n00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:30,250\nDoes that mean it's a bad thing, and\n\n829\n00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:35,338\nwe're kind of stuck with that\nlittle clue not being there?\n\n830\n00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:41,300\nWell, it's gonna sound more like\nMicrosoft and Windows bashing.\n\n831\n00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:46,010\nBut something I'd throw\nin is first of all,\n\n832\n00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:50,340\nwhen's the last time you knew,\nand I can use Windows,\n\n833\n00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:55,020\nmost of us are familiar with it,\nwhen's the last time you knew\n\n834\n00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,790\nWindows to actually remove everything\nwhen there's an uninstall?\n\n835\n00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,750\n>> Right.\nOh yeah.\n\n836\n00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,320\nYeah.\nMSI's are designed to give us that clean\n\n837\n00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,370\nremoval but not always the case.\n\n838\n00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:07,590\nAnd there's tools built into Windows\nthat they might not know about like\n\n839\n00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,520\nthe reliability monitor.\n\n840\n00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,430\nThings like that that track installations\nof software and things like that.\n\n841\n00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,970\nSometimes snapshots get created\nwhen you install software.\n\n842\n00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,490\nSo there could be tell tale signs.\n\n843\n00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:21,710\nThings like you said, things left in\nthe registry that didn't get fully\n\n844\n00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,720\nremoved when we removed the programs.\n\n845\n00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,940\nSo could be some indicators\nout there that they might be\n\n846\n00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,720\nplaying around with some steganography.\n\n847\n00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,280\n>> Yeah,\ncould be stuff left in the registry.\n\n848\n00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,070\nThe registry seems to always be a mess.\n\n849\n00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,350\nIt's like you install it and\nthen it's a mess.\n\n850\n00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:40,950\nAnd that's basically the way it works, so\nyou could start analyzing the registry,\n\n851\n00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,260\nwhich presumably you're doing.\n\n852\n00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,980\nIf we're focusing on a Windows box,\npresumably\n\n853\n00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,120\nyou are analyzing the registry to see\nwhat little bits and pieces are there.\n\n854\n00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,910\nAnd then there's just another thing that\n\n855\n00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:58,720\nhopefully you are also doing or\ntaking a look at.\n\n856\n00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,280\nIt goes back to our second\ntopic from yesterday.\n\n857\n00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:10,010\nOur second episode from yesterday,\nrecovering deleted files.\n\n858\n00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,200\nThat you will uninstall something.\n\n859\n00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:17,600\nDeleting those things off your\nsystem uninstalls and deletes them.\n\n860\n00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,040\nDo a file recovery.\n\n861\n00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,750\nYou're gonna do that at some point anyway\nso you're gonna sweep your hard drive and\n\n862\n00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:29,040\nyou're gonna find out that,\nhey there's an application here and\n\n863\n00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,720\nyou do a closer examination of it.\n\n864\n00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,150\nHey, that's a stenography tool,\nthat's a known stenography tool,\n\n865\n00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:39,510\nwhen you do your investigation on\nwhat that executable or whatever was.\n\n866\n00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:42,880\nNow you're gonna ask yourself\nwhy's a stenography tool there?\n\n867\n00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,090\nAnd then you can start moving in towards\nyour steganalysis process to see okay,\n\n868\n00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:48,660\nwhat was this person hiding?\n\n869\n00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,190\n>> Yeah.\n>> Let's check the file shares.\n\n870\n00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,570\nLet's check the system.\n\n871\n00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:56,640\nLet's check any flash drives to see\nwhat they may have been trying to\n\n872\n00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,460\nkeep out of my prying eyes.\n\n873\n00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:03,373\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n>> And so that's kind of just\n\n874\n00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:07,224\nconnecting the dots.\n\n875\n00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:10,568\nA forensic tech is gonna connect the dots,\nand\n\n876\n00:52:10,568 --> 00:52:15,199\nyou can see that presumably we\nare gonna be doing several of those\n\n877\n00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:20,420\nsteps I just talked about as part\nof our normal investigation.\n\n878\n00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,030\nWhen we get to something\nthat we're concerned about,\n\n879\n00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:25,990\nsteganography, you know\nwe've done a lot already.\n\n880\n00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,980\nWe've already talked\nabout recovering files,\n\n881\n00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,990\nwe've talked about things that Windows and\nother systems leave behind.\n\n882\n00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:37,060\nSo you're doing those things and\nyou're analyzing that image file,\n\n883\n00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:42,200\nyou're seeing all that stuff and saying,\nokay, there's these pieces left behind.\n\n884\n00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,970\nWell now I wanna go over here, those\nthings, there could be a relationship\n\n885\n00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,330\nthere, so you can see looking\nat the big picture would help.\n\n886\n00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:54,360\nIt's not every step of this thing,\neverything you find is just vacuum,\n\n887\n00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,720\nit's something that could help you drive\nyour investigation a certain direction,\n\n888\n00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,650\nor you catch things that\nyou may not otherwise.\n\n889\n00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,370\n>> All right, very good, very good.\n\n890\n00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:05,570\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nlooking at the clock, it's time for\n\n891\n00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,350\nus to take another one of those breaks,\nso we're gonna step away.\n\n892\n00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:12,517\nWhen we come back, more steganography,\nso stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n893\n00:53:12,517 --> 00:53:19,993\n[MUSIC]\n\n894\n00:53:19,993 --> 00:53:21,730\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n895\n00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:26,618\nSo continuing on with our digital forensic\ninvestigator in our steganography episode,\n\n896\n00:53:26,618 --> 00:53:30,230\nnext thing we wanna look at\nhere is some detection methods.\n\n897\n00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:35,240\nWays we can try to determine that there\nis some data hidden within these files.\n\n898\n00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:40,620\n>> Yes, that's the thing that we haven't\ndiscussed yet is, there's all these\n\n899\n00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:46,250\nneat techniques available to hide\nthings inside of other things, but\n\n900\n00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:52,140\nwe looked at such a good method that\nit's someone looking at it is gonna\n\n901\n00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:58,020\nhave a hard time if not impossible\ntask of detecting what's in there.\n\n902\n00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,580\nSo, you're gonna have to rely on different\nmethods that have been designed,\n\n903\n00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,330\nand tools that have been designed\nspecifically to do this sort of thing.\n\n904\n00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:09,110\nSo the process goes faster and you,\n\n905\n00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,600\nif something's there\nhopefully you'll find it.\n\n906\n00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,360\nAnd that's,\nremember that's hopefully you'll find it,\n\n907\n00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,590\nand we'll talk about where that\ncomes in here in just a bit.\n\n908\n00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:22,480\nBut some interesting techniques\nwe've got here to do this.\n\n909\n00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,440\n>> Right.\nSo like\n\n910\n00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,500\none of them is just visual\ninspection of the document.\n\n911\n00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,260\nLike we showed earlier with\nthe highlighting the text and\n\n912\n00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:33,800\nseeing those what looked like blinkers,\nthe document actually got selected?\n\n913\n00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:39,240\n>> Yes, those little things like\nthat could yield you some results.\n\n914\n00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,650\nDon't necessarily expect it, but\n\n915\n00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:46,490\nyou could be in a situation where\nthere's little fingerprints in there.\n\n916\n00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:49,200\nAnd there are visual artifacts,\nstuff like that,\n\n917\n00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,730\nthat indicate that there's something\nhidden or contained within that file.\n\n918\n00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:59,360\nIt could be in some cases, you'll see that\nwhen the process isn't done quite right.\n\n919\n00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:04,320\nYou might see the colors\nthat are out of place or\n\n920\n00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,440\nmaybe an image that has\nthings that are lost in it.\n\n921\n00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,740\nYou might here audio artifacts.\n\n922\n00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,850\nThat's not unheard of.\n\n923\n00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:16,630\nWhen you have something embedded in an\nMP3, it may have altered it just enough.\n\n924\n00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:19,260\nThat it is something that you can hear.\n\n925\n00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,460\n>> Little pops or clicks or\nechoes maybe or something like that.\n\n926\n00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,423\n>> Yeah, or\nyou could hear kind of a tinny sound.\n\n927\n00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:30,363\nAnd kind of like, if you remember, when\nwe started playing way back when with,\n\n928\n00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:35,398\nI wanna see Real Audio files, something\nlike that way back, like 90s things.\n\n929\n00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:38,753\nAnd you'd try re-sampling them and\nre-recording them, and\n\n930\n00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:42,738\nwhen you're playing with the frequency\nsettings on it and sampling rate,\n\n931\n00:55:42,738 --> 00:55:46,975\nsometimes if you went too aggressive,\nit would get that really tinny sound, or\n\n932\n00:55:46,975 --> 00:55:49,775\nit'd sound like chipmunks or\nsomething like that.\n\n933\n00:55:49,775 --> 00:55:54,467\nSometimes if someone's been too\naggressive with their steganography\n\n934\n00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:58,310\nprocess in an audio file\nyou'll get that sort of thing.\n\n935\n00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:02,015\nAnd that can be a give\naway to you as well.\n\n936\n00:56:02,015 --> 00:56:05,190\n>> Mm-hm and then you've got\na list of your statistical.\n\n937\n00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,890\nWhat can we do with those?\n\n938\n00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:12,910\n>> Statistical, and they developed\na number of methods around this.\n\n939\n00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:17,050\nThat you know look at the histograms and\n\n940\n00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:22,320\npatterns within the file itself, and what\nthey're looking for are things that just\n\n941\n00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:28,180\nshouldn't exist normally or are unusual\nand merit further investigation.\n\n942\n00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,950\nThey actually have one method and\nI forget the name right now but\n\n943\n00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,890\nthey have one method that.\n\n944\n00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,910\nThey can do a histogram of it, and\n\n945\n00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:40,200\nthey can look at the curve, of the things\nthat are going, a curve of colors, and\n\n946\n00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,470\nsaturations, and brightness and\nall through there.\n\n947\n00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:46,319\nThey can look at that and say,\nyeah, that just doesn't fit.\n\n948\n00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,390\nThey're too out of whack.\n\n949\n00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:52,270\nThat's not in the case with a photo,\nfor example.\n\n950\n00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:56,090\nThe way things look,\nthat distribution of colors and\n\n951\n00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:59,600\nlighting shouldn't exist\nunder normal conditions.\n\n952\n00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,430\nSo we should dig into this further to see\n\n953\n00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:05,860\nif there are actually\nsomething hiding in here.\n\n954\n00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:10,260\nYou can with photos, you could conceivably\nhave someone that is tweaking it with\n\n955\n00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:15,320\nphotoshop or\nsomeone that has a studio is doing\n\n956\n00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,490\nweird lighting effect but\nhistogram will detect that.\n\n957\n00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,940\nYeah, those patterns of lights and\n\n958\n00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,980\nthose brightness levels, there's too\nmuch variation and differences in it.\n\n959\n00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:31,160\nSo let's go in and investigate it\nfurther with another tool or what have\n\n960\n00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,190\nyou to see if there is something actually\nhiding within the context of that file.\n\n961\n00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:37,420\nIt's really fascinating\nwhen you look at it.\n\n962\n00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,640\n>> It is tricky.\n\n963\n00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,420\nIn fact, [INAUDIBLE] I don't know if\nyou can pull my screen up real quick.\n\n964\n00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,890\nI've just got, if you've never\nseen a histogram for a photo or\n\n965\n00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:47,280\nanything like that,\nthis is what he's referring to, and\n\n966\n00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,580\nit's showing me the different components\nof the picture, the color spread.\n\n967\n00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:55,970\nYou can see, if this was a live program,\nI can go to blacks and shadows and\n\n968\n00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:59,080\nit would highlight these different ranges,\nhighlights and whites, and\n\n969\n00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,660\nyou might see some unusual spikes in here.\n\n970\n00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,740\nWhere it's got these midtones,\na big old spike.\n\n971\n00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,415\nBut yet\nthere's no midtones in the image itself.\n\n972\n00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:06,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n973\n00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:07,860\n>> So that's the kinda\nthing you'd be looking for.\n\n974\n00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,460\nBut you'd really have to be\nfamiliar with reading these and\n\n975\n00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,200\nlooking at these to be able\nto spot something like that.\n\n976\n00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,310\nBecause usually this is not.\n\n977\n00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:17,270\nThis is an Instagram of\njust a normal photo.\n\n978\n00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:20,070\nAnd I've got a lotta peaks and\nvalleys and things like that.\n\n979\n00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,670\nSo it would be tricky.\n\n980\n00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,810\nEasier if you had the original\nimage to compare it to.\n\n981\n00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:27,380\nWhich is something that is\nactually pretty easy now.\n\n982\n00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:32,340\nYou can take Google, will let you upload\nan image and search for that image.\n\n983\n00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,910\nSo I can see taking an image.\n\n984\n00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:34,680\nGoing to Google.\n\n985\n00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,760\nSearching for that image.\n\n986\n00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,999\nFinding another copy of\nthe exact same size.\n\n987\n00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:43,280\nAnd seeing if you can compare the\nhistograms there, or something like that.\n\n988\n00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,510\n>> In fact you mentioned the upload to\nGoogle, there's also an extension for\n\n989\n00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:54,270\nboth Firefox and Chrome called a TinEye\nthat you can load that extension in there.\n\n990\n00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:57,230\nYou see an image that is of interest or\n\n991\n00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,870\none that you have on your own\ndrive you want to upload.\n\n992\n00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,030\nYou can put it through this process, and\n\n993\n00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:06,850\nit will bring up a page saying, here's\nall the things that are matches for it.\n\n994\n00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:10,440\nSo it's doing that reverse image\nsearch on it which is why,\n\n995\n00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,090\nif you think about it, it's a good point.\n\n996\n00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:17,820\nIf someone is using an off the shelf so\nto speak, a stock photo or\n\n997\n00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:24,000\nsomething just off the web, you could\nvery well use that as a comparison.\n\n998\n00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,290\nIf someone's lazy,\n\n999\n00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:30,050\nand leaves the original on their hard\ndrive, along with the altered one.\n\n1000\n00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:32,190\nThat's a dead give away.\n\n1001\n00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,180\nThat there's something else going on.\n\n1002\n00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:39,070\nGranted the person may have just\ndragged and dropped accidentally, or\n\n1003\n00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:42,570\nmade of copy of it cuz they were wanting\nto mess with one, and not the other.\n\n1004\n00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:43,870\nSomething like that.\n\n1005\n00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:47,850\nBut it's something that would catch\nyour eye, and then you could decide,\n\n1006\n00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,990\nbased on other things, that if it's\nsomething that you wanna dig in deeper to.\n\n1007\n00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:56,680\nBut it's, I would add onto it,\nif you're going to, if you were gonna,\n\n1008\n00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,830\nif I was gonna play devil's advocate here,\nI would say that,\n\n1009\n01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:06,400\nif I wanted to defeat the ability for\nyou to compare images,\n\n1010\n01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,640\nI'll just go take my cell phone,\ngo take a quality\n\n1011\n01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,900\nphotograph some place of some trees, or\na building, something that looks like,\n\n1012\n01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,820\nhey, I was just outside sight seeing,\nand I thought that'd be nice.\n\n1013\n01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,960\nHeck, I'd go across the street where\nthere's ducks that are in that pond.\n\n1014\n01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,630\nTake a picture of the ducks,\ncome back in, [INAUDIBLE] in it.\n\n1015\n01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:29,060\nYou're not gonna find that\nimage online to compare it.\n\n1016\n01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:32,040\nSo you would have to do\nsomething like the histogram.\n\n1017\n01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,610\nYou brought up, or you know other\nmethods to see if I can detect it so.\n\n1018\n01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:40,010\n>> Unless you left your\ncamera laying on your desk.\n\n1019\n01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:43,870\nAnd my warrant covered\nsearching your camera.\n\n1020\n01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:45,430\n>> Yeah there you go.\n\n1021\n01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:51,400\n>> We hope the criminals aren't as smart\nas we are, that's the whole goal, right?\n\n1022\n01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,010\n>> Yeah you hope they're not as smart.\n\n1023\n01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:58,150\nAnd you know,\nalso remember you gotta think that way.\n\n1024\n01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:59,660\nThat's where the pen tester and ethical-\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1025\n01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,900\n>> Hacking mindset comes in.\n\n1026\n01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,890\nWe have to play devil's advocate and\nsay what if this, what if this,\n\n1027\n01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,130\nand kind of see that.\n\n1028\n01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:12,280\nIf someone does have a cell phone there,\nremember, and you're right,\n\n1029\n01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,550\nif someone's left their cell phone there,\n\n1030\n01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:17,165\nyou know maybe its something you\ncan get a warrant for to search.\n\n1031\n01:01:17,165 --> 01:01:18,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And how would you know to search it?\n\n1032\n01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:21,000\nWell maybe you look at that\nimage even though it's unique,\n\n1033\n01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,846\nthere's that data again-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1034\n01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:23,537\n>> The metadata.\n\n1035\n01:01:23,537 --> 01:01:28,530\nAnd that will tell you under a good number\nof conditions, what camera was actually\n\n1036\n01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:33,110\nused to do it, you can so, oh, well,\nit was a Samsung whatever and that, I know\n\n1037\n01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:37,430\nfor a fact that that's that phone, so I'm\ngonna grab it just in case that is there.\n\n1038\n01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,430\n>> And that could probably help secure\nthe warrant in the first place, I can say,\n\n1039\n01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,710\nlook, these photos were taken with this\nmodel camera and I see this model of\n\n1040\n01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:47,560\ncamera laying there at the crime scene so\nlet's assume that's part of it.\n\n1041\n01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,580\nOr not assume I shouldn't say that.\n\n1042\n01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,930\nBut might help you get that warrant.\n\n1043\n01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,960\nSome other things, size and check sums\nthese are other things that might get\n\n1044\n01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,870\nmodified if we're doing steganography?\n\n1045\n01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:00,120\n>> Yes,\nthat would definitely be another one.\n\n1046\n01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,130\nSize changes in a file.\n\n1047\n01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:06,870\nWhen doing steganography pretty\nmuch count on that happening.\n\n1048\n01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:10,260\nUnless you're talking\na really really small file\n\n1049\n01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:14,120\nyou're not gonna see a change in size.\n\n1050\n01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:18,030\nAnd if you're talking something\nthat's maybe a K in size,\n\n1051\n01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:22,110\nyou know it's conceivable that\nonce it compresses that and\n\n1052\n01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:27,350\ndoes its other magic with it then maybe\nthere's not gonna be a size change.\n\n1053\n01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:28,990\nUsually, in every case,\n\n1054\n01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:32,570\nyou stick something of whatever\nsize on something else.\n\n1055\n01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:34,370\nThere has to be,\nyou added something to it.\n\n1056\n01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:35,920\nThere, by its very nature,\n\n1057\n01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,100\nhas to be a size change, but there\nare some cases where it [INAUDIBLE] it and\n\n1058\n01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:44,060\ndo other manipulations on the image\nwhere it might come out the same size.\n\n1059\n01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,440\nDon't count on that.\n\n1060\n01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:51,410\nSo there will typically be a size\nchange and if someone is really lazy or\n\n1061\n01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:55,820\njust not familiar with the process,\nthey're more concerned with\n\n1062\n01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:59,870\nthe wow factor of hey look I can\ntake this and shove it in this.\n\n1063\n01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:01,340\nAnd you can't see it now.\n\n1064\n01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,920\nYou can see an image.\n\n1065\n01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,370\nYou see that every time someone gets\ninto Steganography the first time.\n\n1066\n01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:08,350\nSomeone uses a program like you had up,\nMike.\n\n1067\n01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:13,110\nOr something like invisible secrets,\nor any of those things.\n\n1068\n01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:16,390\nThey will use them first time, and they\njust get so fascinated with the fact that\n\n1069\n01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,270\nthey can hide something\ninside of something else and\n\n1070\n01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:23,710\nhow easy it is that they're not paying\nattention that if you have a image that is\n\n1071\n01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:28,900\na meg in size, and then you take a 20\nmeg and shove it inside of that,\n\n1072\n01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,520\nit's gonna make that photograph look so\nbig that anyone with a little\n\n1073\n01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:36,420\ncommon sense is gonna go, yeah,\nthat's not that big of an image.\n\n1074\n01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:36,975\n>> Right.\n>> Or\n\n1075\n01:03:36,975 --> 01:03:40,804\nthere's not that much detail\nin the image to be that size.\n\n1076\n01:03:40,804 --> 01:03:41,420\nSo.\n\n1077\n01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,895\n>> Yeah.\nMy 150x150 icon imager thumbnail should\n\n1078\n01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,436\nnot be.\n\n1079\n01:03:45,436 --> 01:03:47,491\n400MB in size.\n\n1080\n01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,430\n>> Yeah, it's being smart.\n\n1081\n01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:52,784\nAnd if someone knows what\nthey're doing however,\n\n1082\n01:03:52,784 --> 01:03:56,139\nif they did have a lot of\nmegabytes of stuff to save,\n\n1083\n01:03:56,139 --> 01:04:01,840\nthey probably shouldn't choose an image\nfile, that would just be a bad choice.\n\n1084\n01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,600\nThat's where a video file comes in.\n\n1085\n01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:09,590\nA video file, you expect them to be\nlarge in size so it becomes much easier.\n\n1086\n01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:13,630\nThat's where the intelligence\nof coming in and\n\n1087\n01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:17,870\ndoing your research on\nsteganography comes into play.\n\n1088\n01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:19,360\nThey know it, we know it.\n\n1089\n01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:24,880\nThe one I talked about in Germany\nin our earlier segment, where they\n\n1090\n01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:30,035\nfound a video with steganography,\nwith files hidden via steganography.\n\n1091\n01:04:30,035 --> 01:04:34,660\nSomeone's not gonna hide, and there\nwas numerous PDFs in that image file,\n\n1092\n01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:37,630\nno one was gonna hide\nthose inside of an image,\n\n1093\n01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:40,850\nthey're gonna hide them\ninside of a video file.\n\n1094\n01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:41,800\nAnd that's what they did.\n\n1095\n01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,576\nIf you hide those things inside an image,\nit's gonna look too big,\n\n1096\n01:04:44,576 --> 01:04:46,634\nand it would have attracted\na lot more attention.\n\n1097\n01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:50,426\nAs it was,\nwhat attracted attention was the context,\n\n1098\n01:04:50,426 --> 01:04:56,280\nwas this guy's got pornography, and he's\nguarding it with his life essentially,\n\n1099\n01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,126\nand he's hiding it and\nall this type of stuff.\n\n1100\n01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:04,240\nAnd personality and other things just\ndon't fit why that would be there, so\n\n1101\n01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,760\nit's out of place.\n\n1102\n01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,860\nWe get a search warrant.\n\n1103\n01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,580\n>> All right, and\nthen some other things we could look for,\n\n1104\n01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:15,270\ntrying to detect this steganography\nmight be, we talked about anomalies,\n\n1105\n01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:18,900\nas far as artifacts in an image or\n\n1106\n01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:23,630\na video, or echos within an MP3 or\nsomething like that.\n\n1107\n01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:24,760\nAnd then signatures, right?\n\n1108\n01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,048\nIf we go and modify a file, guess what's\ngonna happen to the signature on that\n\n1109\n01:05:28,048 --> 01:05:29,831\nfile, if it had a signature originally.\n\n1110\n01:05:29,831 --> 01:05:31,771\n>> Yes and really, in essence,\n\n1111\n01:05:31,771 --> 01:05:36,037\nwe want to make sure when we talk\nabout this there's checksums and\n\n1112\n01:05:36,037 --> 01:05:41,186\nthere's signatures, and they might\nactually sound like they're the same.\n\n1113\n01:05:41,186 --> 01:05:43,730\nA checksum, that's the hashing part and\n\n1114\n01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:46,820\nthat's kind of easy to\nunderstand at this point.\n\n1115\n01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,520\nWe've been through that in CEH,\nwe've talked about it here.\n\n1116\n01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,134\nYou hash something and you do anything\nto it, steganography included,\n\n1117\n01:05:53,134 --> 01:05:54,507\nthat hash is gonna change.\n\n1118\n01:05:54,507 --> 01:05:57,220\nSo checksum changes,\nwe know there's a change,\n\n1119\n01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,685\nnow we gotta figure out\nwhat that change was.\n\n1120\n01:05:59,685 --> 01:06:02,818\nThen you start doing your\ndetailed investigation to\n\n1121\n01:06:02,818 --> 01:06:06,510\nfind out what's different\non that particular target.\n\n1122\n01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:11,620\nA signature, every file has a unique\nsignature or something about it\n\n1123\n01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:17,900\nthat can tell us things about who it is.\n\n1124\n01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:23,300\nAlso, not only does every file have that,\nevery tool has that.\n\n1125\n01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:28,430\nAnd that is something that plays\nin really, really, really big,\n\n1126\n01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:34,040\nis that the tools will leave a certain\nsignature on that file when they alter it.\n\n1127\n01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:37,237\nAnd so-\n>> I think about like pictures on the\n\n1128\n01:06:37,237 --> 01:06:41,484\nInternet where people have Photoshopped\nsome image of some actor or actress.\n\n1129\n01:06:41,484 --> 01:06:47,100\nOr this huge alligator that was caught in\nthe pond down the road, it's 27 feet long!\n\n1130\n01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:51,380\nThey can go in and see that that picture's\nbeen modified, and that it was Photoshop\n\n1131\n01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:54,570\nthat modified it because of\nthe signatures left by those programs.\n\n1132\n01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:55,440\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1133\n01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,161\nAnd these tools we're talking about here,\nevery one of these tools, and\n\n1134\n01:07:00,161 --> 01:07:05,416\nI mean that, every one of the tools you'll\nencounter that's gonna alter a file,\n\n1135\n01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:07,031\nwill leave a signature.\n\n1136\n01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:13,230\nAnd that is a huge benefit to\nyou in the detection process.\n\n1137\n01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:19,383\nI mean, remember we talked about searching\na folder that has 100 files in it,\n\n1138\n01:07:19,383 --> 01:07:24,110\nit has 1,000 files in it,\nwe could go crazy with that.\n\n1139\n01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:25,240\nThat's a big task,\n\n1140\n01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:30,770\nthat's some heavy lifting there you gotta\ndo to find that needle in a haystack.\n\n1141\n01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:35,190\nSo now what we're looking for\nis when we start running those files,\n\n1142\n01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:38,190\nwe could switch and do,\nlet's see if there's any signatures.\n\n1143\n01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:42,100\nDo a batch process scan of these things\nand see if there's any signatures on any\n\n1144\n01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,780\nof these things that indicate\nthat something had altered it.\n\n1145\n01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,640\nAnd you can do that manually by the way.\n\n1146\n01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,985\nI don't know that you'd\nwant to do it manually.\n\n1147\n01:07:49,985 --> 01:07:52,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Unless you just really feel like you\n\n1148\n01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:55,600\nhaven't had enough fun and games.\n\n1149\n01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,420\n>> Right.\n\n1150\n01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:00,263\n>> And root canals off the table, then\nthat's one way you could go through and\n\n1151\n01:08:00,263 --> 01:08:01,607\ndo it, is do it manually.\n\n1152\n01:08:01,607 --> 01:08:03,280\nBut there's tools to help you.\n\n1153\n01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:10,960\nSome are experimental, other ones\nare out there and ready to be used.\n\n1154\n01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,281\n>> All right, so we've got different ways\nwe can try to detect that steganography,\n\n1155\n01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:19,570\nmanually, visual, audible,\nstatistics, signatures, checksums.\n\n1156\n01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:22,571\nAnd then we also have some tools that\nwe can use to try to make this a little\n\n1157\n01:08:22,571 --> 01:08:23,132\nbit easier.\n\n1158\n01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:27,272\nAs you said, if I've got dozens or\nhundreds of images to go through, or\n\n1159\n01:08:27,272 --> 01:08:31,838\nMP3s, I might wanna try to find a little\nmore efficient way to process these.\n\n1160\n01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:33,185\n>> Mm-hm, yeah-\n>> And\n\n1161\n01:08:33,185 --> 01:08:35,085\nthat's where some of these\ntools come into play.\n\n1162\n01:08:35,085 --> 01:08:39,320\n>> Yeah, that's where a good number\nof tools will come into play.\n\n1163\n01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:44,400\nYou have a whole bag of tools\nthat do steganalysis and\n\n1164\n01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,880\ndetection of content.\n\n1165\n01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:52,130\nSome of them were actually in the CEH,\ncuz we talked about this there.\n\n1166\n01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:55,478\nBut then there's other ones that get\nmore advanced or do different things.\n\n1167\n01:08:55,478 --> 01:09:00,590\nAnd there's some tools that you might\nnot associate with this process\n\n1168\n01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:03,470\nthat can also do detection.\n\n1169\n01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:10,560\nOne of the ones I noted, put in my notes\nto make sure you're aware of it, Notepad.\n\n1170\n01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,721\n>> Yeah, I saw that and I thought, hm,\nthat's the first thing I thought of when I\n\n1171\n01:09:14,721 --> 01:09:17,573\nthought of detecting steganography,\nwas Notepad.\n\n1172\n01:09:17,573 --> 01:09:20,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So tell me,\n\n1173\n01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,380\nSean, how can I use Notepad\nto detect steganography?\n\n1174\n01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:29,790\n>> Notepad may not be the most elegant\nsolution to doing this, but it will work.\n\n1175\n01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:33,322\nIf you use Notepad, or\nas I also noted, Notepad+,\n\n1176\n01:09:33,322 --> 01:09:36,941\nthat was something that I said-\n>> A personal fav, yeah.\n\n1177\n01:09:36,941 --> 01:09:39,890\n>> Yeah,\nthat should be in your toolkit already.\n\n1178\n01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:40,500\nBut, and\n\n1179\n01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:45,120\nyou have Notepad if you're already in\nthe Windows world, you've got it there.\n\n1180\n01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,230\nWhat you're doing is you're\nopening up the file there.\n\n1181\n01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:50,970\nAnd I know, neither one of those,\nwe're talking images,\n\n1182\n01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:55,120\nis designed to be an image viewer,\nit's not what they're meant for.\n\n1183\n01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,680\nBut that's not what we're looking for\neither here.\n\n1184\n01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,400\nIs that we gotta copy the image,\nwe open it in one of those programs, and\n\n1185\n01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,670\nwhat we can do is we can actually\nanalyze the code in the file.\n\n1186\n01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:09,080\nAnd you'll notice on the header and\nthe footer of those things,\n\n1187\n01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:13,000\nthere's actually hex code,\npresent in a lot of those things.\n\n1188\n01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,800\nIf you look at that hex code itself,\nand it's unique for\n\n1189\n01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,790\nevery type of file, certain hex signatures\n\n1190\n01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:26,420\nin the header of the file will tell\nyou what that file is supposed to be.\n\n1191\n01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:30,760\nSo you can look at that and you can see\nsomething, I think for a bitmap it's BR.\n\n1192\n01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:36,067\nYou'll see those things in there, if you\ntranslate the hex over you'll see that.\n\n1193\n01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:38,166\nSo how does that come into play?\n\n1194\n01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:41,685\nWell it comes into play\nbecause you can look at,\n\n1195\n01:10:41,685 --> 01:10:45,535\nwhat a lot of steganography techniques are\nactually doing when they scramble stuff\n\n1196\n01:10:45,535 --> 01:10:50,215\nis they're actually adding stuff onto\nthe file as part of that process.\n\n1197\n01:10:50,215 --> 01:10:53,935\nSo what you do is you look at the header\nto see what the file's supposed to be.\n\n1198\n01:10:53,935 --> 01:10:57,487\nAnd then you go all the way down\nto the footer of the file and\n\n1199\n01:10:57,487 --> 01:11:00,530\nlook at the bits down there and\nsee if they match.\n\n1200\n01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:05,615\nAnd they may not match, especially\nif steganography's been in play.\n\n1201\n01:11:05,615 --> 01:11:09,350\nYou could look at those things and see\nthat it's saying it's this type of file up\n\n1202\n01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:12,140\nhere, but\nthere's a different sequence down here.\n\n1203\n01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:15,242\nSo something's been monkeying around\nin here, and I don't know what it is.\n\n1204\n01:11:15,242 --> 01:11:19,904\nBut since these two don't match or\nare not paired up correctly,\n\n1205\n01:11:19,904 --> 01:11:25,877\nit was this up here, something happened\nthat change this footer to be different.\n\n1206\n01:11:25,877 --> 01:11:32,585\nAnd that can be a dead-on indicator\nthat steganography is in play.\n\n1207\n01:11:32,585 --> 01:11:37,065\nSome tools will specifically change\nthose hex codes to something\n\n1208\n01:11:37,065 --> 01:11:38,779\nthat's unique to them.\n\n1209\n01:11:38,779 --> 01:11:42,738\nAnd then if you see that and\nyou learn those hex codes, oh yeah,\n\n1210\n01:11:42,738 --> 01:11:46,573\nman you're kind of getting\ntowards home free at that point.\n\n1211\n01:11:46,573 --> 01:11:48,326\nNow you've identified a tool.\n\n1212\n01:11:48,326 --> 01:11:49,991\nAnd that's huge,\n\n1213\n01:11:49,991 --> 01:11:56,040\nbeing able to detect the tool that\nactually carried out the process.\n\n1214\n01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:00,820\nIf you can detect the tool that\ncarried out that process, you can\n\n1215\n01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:07,328\ngo to that tool, and figure out\nhow they carry out their process.\n\n1216\n01:12:07,328 --> 01:12:10,500\n>> Mm-hm\n>> If it's not something\n\n1217\n01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,990\nunderground at least.\n\n1218\n01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:14,140\nYou can figure out how they did it.\n\n1219\n01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:19,520\nYou might be able to, since you're doing\nan investigation, you might be able to go\n\n1220\n01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,330\nto the vendor themselves and\nsay, this is what I'm doing.\n\n1221\n01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:28,080\nI don't want a dump of\nall your source code, or\n\n1222\n01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,380\nanything like that, but\nI'm working on a certain type of case.\n\n1223\n01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,760\nYou know, go through the whole thing.\n\n1224\n01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:38,140\nAnd they will help you with those\nsorts of things in a lot of cases.\n\n1225\n01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:41,320\nBut you have to approach them as, A,\nyou're not just some random person trying\n\n1226\n01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,340\nto reverse engineer their code,\nand, and steal their ideas.\n\n1227\n01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,360\nIt's like you're doing\na legal investigation.\n\n1228\n01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,610\nAnd then they'll tell you,\noh, yeah we'll do this.\n\n1229\n01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:54,090\nThey may even help you analyze the file,\nand that would actually be really good.\n\n1230\n01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:56,860\nBecause if they're analyzing the file the\nway the steganography was done with their\n\n1231\n01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:57,373\napplication.\n\n1232\n01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:02,220\nThat's something that you could get\nan affadavit for, or get that person as\n\n1233\n01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:07,217\na witness in court and say, if there's\na lot of stegonagraphy being done, get\n\n1234\n01:13:07,217 --> 01:13:13,100\nthat person in as a expert witness, and\nthat bumps up your position even further.\n\n1235\n01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:18,385\nBut those, that header and that footer,\nif you can view them which you can\n\n1236\n01:13:18,385 --> 01:13:24,215\nif you want to take the time, you can\nview those things and see what you find.\n\n1237\n01:13:24,215 --> 01:13:27,305\nAnd I guarantee you're going to have to\n\n1238\n01:13:27,305 --> 01:13:30,495\nfind a list of all the different\nhex codes that are out there.\n\n1239\n01:13:30,495 --> 01:13:32,775\n>> Jason if we can flip over to\nmy screen for just a second.\n\n1240\n01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:35,019\nThe image I did the stego on before.\n\n1241\n01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:39,770\nPreviously in the show,\nI just opened it up in Notepad, and\n\n1242\n01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,490\nthis is the kind of\nthing you're looking at.\n\n1243\n01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:44,965\nSo you're gonna a little help\ndeciphering some of this information.\n\n1244\n01:13:44,965 --> 01:13:46,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I took that BM,\n\n1245\n01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:49,070\nit was a BMP image that\nI had inserted some text\n\n1246\n01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:50,160\ninto,\n>> And\n\n1247\n01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,600\nthis is what happens when you\nopen that up with Notepad.\n\n1248\n01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,390\nSo we gotta know, does this stuff\nbelong or does it not belong?\n\n1249\n01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,160\n>> Yeah, did you have the header in there?\n\n1250\n01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,980\nOr did it pop up?\n\n1251\n01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:01,640\n>> At the very top.\n\n1252\n01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,485\nIt locked up my computer for\na moment, trying to get some of this.\n\n1253\n01:14:04,485 --> 01:14:09,556\n[CROSSTALK] Just in case\nyou go online here.\n\n1254\n01:14:09,556 --> 01:14:14,620\n>> And there's my BM6,\nprobably referring to a bitmap image.\n\n1255\n01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,130\nThat would be my assumption.\n\n1256\n01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:17,700\n>> Yeah that would be\nan indicator right there.\n\n1257\n01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:21,800\nSo it's not formatted the way\nI would expect it to be,\n\n1258\n01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,030\nbut did you turn word wrapper on?\n\n1259\n01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:25,320\n>> I did turn word wrap on.\n\n1260\n01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,290\n>> Okay.\n\n1261\n01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,110\nIf I turn it off, and\nit just goes all the way,\n\n1262\n01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:29,990\nthat's what locked up\nmy computer last time.\n\n1263\n01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,770\n>> Okay.\nIt just broke your stuff.\n\n1264\n01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:31,490\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1265\n01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:32,280\n>> Sorry.\n\n1266\n01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,110\n>> I'm sorry.\n\n1267\n01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,670\nWe're moving on, anyway.\n\n1268\n01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:38,500\n>> But you can see the stuff,\nif this doesn't view right.\n\n1269\n01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:42,440\nAnd who knows, Microsoft monkeys\nwill think from time to time.\n\n1270\n01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,660\nIt's not, at the realm of possibility,\n\n1271\n01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:49,420\nthey decided that they wanted\nto do something to Notepad.\n\n1272\n01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,570\nNotepads been used for\na long time to do that sort of analysis,\n\n1273\n01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:54,440\nof all types of files.\n\n1274\n01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,860\nSo, who knows,\nthey could have done something to it.\n\n1275\n01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:01,120\nNotepad Plus will do it.\n\n1276\n01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:06,170\nAnd then, I've got some other\ntools to bring up in here.\n\n1277\n01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:08,160\nOne of them is a tool called WinHacks.\n\n1278\n01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:12,725\nYou can go and use that, and\nthat will light decipher things like that,\n\n1279\n01:15:12,725 --> 01:15:17,540\ndecipher hex codes and\nlook at files to see what you can find.\n\n1280\n01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:21,240\nAnd then there's one\nthat I have in my list,\n\n1281\n01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,310\nand there's actually some\ninteresting things about this tool.\n\n1282\n01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,940\nThere's this one called StegSpy.\n\n1283\n01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:31,790\nStegSpy was created by someone that was,\nit looks like\n\n1284\n01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:36,635\nthey were doing a presentation at one\nof the DEFCON or Blackhack conferences.\n\n1285\n01:15:36,635 --> 01:15:38,415\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, big surprise, right?\n\n1286\n01:15:38,415 --> 01:15:39,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, but\n\n1287\n01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,690\nthey were doing their presentation.\n\n1288\n01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:44,085\nTalking about the process\nof stegonagraphy.\n\n1289\n01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:47,610\nSteganalysis and\nsome stuff with cryptanalysis.\n\n1290\n01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:50,410\nThey were doing a presentation on that.\n\n1291\n01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:55,310\nAnd this tool,\nwhat they designed it to do, Is to detect\n\n1292\n01:15:55,310 --> 01:16:00,790\nthe possibility of steganography being\npresent, by allowing you to scan files.\n\n1293\n01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:04,880\nAnd it's got signature built into\nit that will look at the signature,\n\n1294\n01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,480\nlook at the stuff in a file, to see,\nhey, I know what tool did that.\n\n1295\n01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:13,180\nI can see the code being\nchanged at the bottom.\n\n1296\n01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:19,300\nAnd that hex code, matches something,\na tool that I have in my database.\n\n1297\n01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:24,300\nSo then once you know that,\nyou can again go back to that tool.\n\n1298\n01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:30,910\nThe thing I find interesting about this,\nis that with this specific tool,\n\n1299\n01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:38,085\nfor a while,\nthis StegSpy stool ,StegSpy tool.\n\n1300\n01:16:38,085 --> 01:16:39,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was actually noted, and\n\n1301\n01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,340\nyou can see it's kind of old now.\n\n1302\n01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,820\nI guess they resolved it.\n\n1303\n01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:46,240\nBut at one point, this for some reason.\n\n1304\n01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,500\nI haven't found the exact reason yet.\n\n1305\n01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,950\nIf I do I'll let you know,\n\n1306\n01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:52,900\nor post something in discussion groups or\nsomething.\n\n1307\n01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:57,380\nFor some reason,\nthe creator I believe at the time,\n\n1308\n01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:00,895\nwas actually residing or\nliving in the state of Michigan.\n\n1309\n01:17:00,895 --> 01:17:01,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n1310\n01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,850\nMichigan state law banned\nhim posting that tool.\n\n1311\n01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:05,900\n>> Really?\n\n1312\n01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,720\n>> I can't tell you why.\n\n1313\n01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:13,690\nBut there is something that\nhe just took it off line,\n\n1314\n01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,380\nso I don't know if he is\nstill in Michigan, and\n\n1315\n01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:19,510\nthis got hosted some place else,\nwhich seems easy to get around.\n\n1316\n01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:25,330\nIf that was the case, or if the law got\nchanged, I don't know what the law was,\n\n1317\n01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:30,530\nbut it's really fascinating, but\nit seems like the government always,\n\n1318\n01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:33,340\nand it's every government,\nnot just the U.S.\n\n1319\n01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:37,780\nIt's every government, because they know\nthe power of things like cryptography.\n\n1320\n01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:41,120\nAnd this fits within the realm of\ncryptography and hiding things.\n\n1321\n01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,020\nIt's not cryptography,\nbut it fits within that.\n\n1322\n01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:47,410\nIt seems like governments\nare always passing something,\n\n1323\n01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:51,750\nor are concernrd with what\npeople can do with cryptography.\n\n1324\n01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:55,054\nAnd because they know they can hide\nthings, so they are concerned about that.\n\n1325\n01:17:55,054 --> 01:17:58,017\n[CROSSTALK] You can see here\nthat it identifies, again,\n\n1326\n01:17:58,017 --> 01:18:00,601\nlooking at those signatures\nwe talked about, so\n\n1327\n01:18:00,601 --> 01:18:04,142\nif somebody used one of these\nprograms to do their steganography.\n\n1328\n01:18:04,142 --> 01:18:08,407\nIt can detect that, it can figure out\nthat, oh, they've used Masker to modify\n\n1329\n01:18:08,407 --> 01:18:12,740\nthis image, let's go a little deeper,\nand do an investigation on that image.\n\n1330\n01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:17,205\nI apologize, I can't post any links\nright now, my login isn't working, but\n\n1331\n01:18:17,205 --> 01:18:21,010\nthat's spy-hunter.com,\nI'll put them in the show notes.\n\n1332\n01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:24,616\nAnd then the other one that\nSean was referring to,\n\n1333\n01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:27,980\nWinHex is at x-ways.net, so\nyou can go there and take a look at that.\n\n1334\n01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:33,710\nAnd I'll put them in\nthe show notes as well.\n\n1335\n01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:36,589\n>> Yeah, so probably,\nif you're doing this, you would use,\n\n1336\n01:18:36,589 --> 01:18:40,920\none of these tools that detect to see what\ntool steganography wise they were using.\n\n1337\n01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:44,150\nAnd then you could go into,\nyou know, WinHex and\n\n1338\n01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:46,200\nstart maybe doing a closer analysis.\n\n1339\n01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,820\nYou can start with WinHex\nif you really wanted to.\n\n1340\n01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:52,390\nIn fact in theory,\nif you're someone that's got access or\n\n1341\n01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:55,190\nthose sorts of tools, you might be able to\nuse some of the stuff that they use for\n\n1342\n01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,800\nreverse engineering malware,\nand those type of things.\n\n1343\n01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,460\nYou could look at how they use\nthose to actually analyze a file.\n\n1344\n01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:05,350\nThings also like the Access FTK\n>> And\n\n1345\n01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:09,110\nother tools like that,\ncan also do some of this.\n\n1346\n01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:13,948\nSo, you've got a pretty loaded tool kit\nwith things that can attack it, and\n\n1347\n01:19:13,948 --> 01:19:16,730\nit's just knowing what to look for.\n\n1348\n01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:19,230\nAnd if the person used a tool\nthat is off the shelf.\n\n1349\n01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:22,530\nIf its not off the shelf; something\nthat they wrote a script for or\n\n1350\n01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:24,070\ndesigned on their own.\n\n1351\n01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:28,120\nThen you're gonna have to probably go\ndirectly to something like WinHex and\n\n1352\n01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,570\nstart analyzing those bits, and\nstart with the header and footer.\n\n1353\n01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:33,300\nAnd start doing those things\n>> [COUGH]\n\n1354\n01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,650\n>> to see if there's something in there.\n\n1355\n01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:35,960\nUse your histograms,-\n>> Right.\n\n1356\n01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:39,060\n>> Use your statistical analysis,\nthings like that, to see if it's in there.\n\n1357\n01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:44,403\nSo there's, but usually you can\nfind something if you really look.\n\n1358\n01:19:44,403 --> 01:19:47,539\nAnd this doesn't even throw in stuff like,\n\n1359\n01:19:47,539 --> 01:19:53,234\none of the things you mentioned in the CEH\ncourse, was alternate data streams?\n\n1360\n01:19:53,234 --> 01:19:58,120\nAlternate data streams kind of are a form\nof Steganography because you're hiding\n\n1361\n01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,156\nsomething and it's not using\nthe exact same techniques that we're\n\n1362\n01:20:02,156 --> 01:20:07,200\ntalking about here but you are hiding\nsomething, essentially in plain sight.\n\n1363\n01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,900\nBecause you're using a,\nthere's a file fork and\n\n1364\n01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,610\na resource fork if you wanna look at it,\n\n1365\n01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:16,470\nthe resource fork is not displayed by the\noperating system, but the two are linked.\n\n1366\n01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:20,940\nSo what's happening is someone\nhides in the resource fork and\n\n1367\n01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:21,670\nthey don't know about it.\n\n1368\n01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:22,720\nThey're not going to see it.\n\n1369\n01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,240\nThat's kinda how Steganography works.\n\n1370\n01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,211\nThey don't know about it,\nyou're not going to see it.\n\n1371\n01:20:26,211 --> 01:20:30,414\nSo those ones are used a lot.\n\n1372\n01:20:30,414 --> 01:20:34,610\nAnd there's a lot of tools\nthat make using it easier.\n\n1373\n01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:39,610\nBut if you go to the WSCC,\nit also has a tool in there that will,\n\n1374\n01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:43,300\nthere's actually like three tools\nin there, that will analyze and\n\n1375\n01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,490\ntell you if there's\nan alternate data stream.\n\n1376\n01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:46,480\nAnd then, it will also,\n\n1377\n01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,760\none of them will actually find\nthe alternate data stream, and\n\n1378\n01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,655\njust display a whole list of the alternate\ndata streams in a specific folder.\n\n1379\n01:20:52,655 --> 01:20:53,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1380\n01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:54,050\n>> Which is-\n>> Nice.\n\n1381\n01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,720\n>> Really cool, so\nit's tough to hide at that point.\n\n1382\n01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,680\n>> But let me tell you,\nthis is one of the things.\n\n1383\n01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,940\nIf I was gonna choose one, alternate data\nstreams is actually a pretty good choice\n\n1384\n01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,170\nif you wanted to hide\nsomething as an attacker.\n\n1385\n01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:07,640\nAnd the reason why I'll say that,\n\n1386\n01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,090\nis something that again\nwe talked about the CEH.\n\n1387\n01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:12,110\nAlternate data streams aren't a bad thing.\n\n1388\n01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:16,470\nMicrosoft Kernel uses those, and if you\ndon't recall, Microsoft used those for\n\n1389\n01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:20,920\nthings like if you download things on\nInternet Explorer or through office.\n\n1390\n01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:25,630\nWe've all seen that bar come\nacross the top in office saying\n\n1391\n01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:27,220\nyou can't open this file for editing.\n\n1392\n01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,890\nIt came from the Internet.\n\n1393\n01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:29,970\nIt's like how does it know that?\n\n1394\n01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:31,310\n>> Right.\n>> There's nothing on that\n\n1395\n01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:32,860\nfile that says that.\n\n1396\n01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:37,120\nIt's because they're using that alternate\ndata stream attached to that file to say\n\n1397\n01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,050\nthis came from the Internet.\n\n1398\n01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:42,320\nThere's actually a sequence of\nbits set in the resource for.\n\n1399\n01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,800\nSaying that this came from the Internet or\nthis came from this location, or\n\n1400\n01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,460\nthis location, and when office sees,\nopens that file and\n\n1401\n01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:53,730\nreads the alternate data stream because\nit is a stream aware application.\n\n1402\n01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:56,280\nIt reads that and\nsays okay i know where that came from.\n\n1403\n01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:00,410\nThat means, if you are doing a forensic\ninvestigation and you're looking for\n\n1404\n01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:05,120\nalternate data streams, your job just got\nharder because you can't just go look, and\n\n1405\n01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,780\nsay, oh, there's an alternate data stream,\nbad stuff.\n\n1406\n01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:12,290\nNo, that could be a case where it's\nliterally suppose to be there.\n\n1407\n01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:14,700\nNow someone's hiding,\ntheir alternate data stream.\n\n1408\n01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,890\n>> Right.\n>> Amongst all the other alternate data\n\n1409\n01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,400\nstreams.\n\n1410\n01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,140\nAnd that can cause some headaches.\n\n1411\n01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:25,900\nBut, fortunately alternate data\nstreams are not something that's in\n\n1412\n01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,530\ncommon knowledge.\n\n1413\n01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:30,230\nBut it's something that\na forensic person has to\n\n1414\n01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:33,390\nknow about because a lot of\nthe criminals seem to know about it.\n\n1415\n01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:34,780\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1416\n01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:37,860\nSo we've got a lot of different tools\nwe can use to try to detect where\n\n1417\n01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:41,115\nSteganography has been used and\ndiscover that information.\n\n1418\n01:22:41,115 --> 01:22:43,630\nAnti-forensics evasion techniques.\n\n1419\n01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:47,660\nWe know that there are ways that\ncan try to avoid detection,\n\n1420\n01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:50,340\nso how do we battle that?\n\n1421\n01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:54,320\n>> Yeah,\nthis is some of the tricky part of it,\n\n1422\n01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:59,170\ndoing an anti-forensics with this,is\npeople could do something like I just\n\n1423\n01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:02,190\nmentioned with alternate data streams,\njust hide it amongst all the other ones.\n\n1424\n01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:06,875\nAnd that makes it very tough if\nthey've named the thing right, and\n\n1425\n01:23:06,875 --> 01:23:10,825\nthey've done some other things on it,\nthey can make it very, very, very tough.\n\n1426\n01:23:10,825 --> 01:23:15,875\nThere can also be cases where people\nhave ben known to embed multiple\n\n1427\n01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:20,235\nfiles of Steganography\nin a certain location.\n\n1428\n01:23:20,235 --> 01:23:23,790\nThen it steps of things even\nharder onto another level.\n\n1429\n01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:26,690\nAnd a Steganography doesn't just include\n\n1430\n01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:32,740\nyou taking a file and\nshoving it inside another one.\n\n1431\n01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:38,780\nYou can also use different lumps of\nencryption or compression on it too.\n\n1432\n01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:42,120\nIn fact, invisible secrets is\none of the ones that does that.\n\n1433\n01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:45,690\nIt actually will compress the data and\nthen it will run,\n\n1434\n01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:52,910\nthe trials version runs\nAS I believe at 206 bit.\n\n1435\n01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:58,010\nIf you know enough about Cryptography\nyou know that aes 256 bit,\n\n1436\n01:23:58,010 --> 01:24:02,810\nthat's a very,\nvery tall order to break that.\n\n1437\n01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:06,085\nIf you don't know about Cryptography,\nnext week we've got.\n\n1438\n01:24:06,085 --> 01:24:06,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1439\n01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:08,990\n>> Gotta stay tuned for\n\n1440\n01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:11,410\nmore excitement coming up next week.\nSo\n\n1441\n01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:17,290\nwhat else do we have to worry about here?\nSome legal implications\n\n1442\n01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:22,690\nwe might have to deal with?\n>> Yeah that's kinda the tricky thing,\n\n1443\n01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:25,790\nis there are some legal\nimplications of this.\n\n1444\n01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:29,900\nThere could be some issues with doing\na search warrant on something like this.\n\n1445\n01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,210\nBecause if someone hides\nit in personal photos.\n\n1446\n01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:40,610\nYou're gonna have to have a reasonable\nreason to go in and say, I need\n\n1447\n01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:46,850\nto search these personal files, because I\nthink there might be Steganography in use.\n\n1448\n01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:49,690\n>> But hard to convince the Judge to\ngive me a warrant in the first place,\n\n1449\n01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:54,440\nif I don't have a good reason to suspect\nthat they might be using that technique.\n\n1450\n01:24:54,440 --> 01:25:00,100\nYeah, and putting that situation\nout there, I guess I could say,\n\n1451\n01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:05,600\ncould you have already gotten something\nthat suggests Steganography is in use?\n\n1452\n01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,690\n>> Maybe see that the tool is\ninstalled in their computer or\n\n1453\n01:25:08,690 --> 01:25:12,870\nmaybe find that they've used it in another\nfile that was covered under the warrant.\n\n1454\n01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:15,590\nThen I maybe could expand my search.\n\n1455\n01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:18,380\nYeah, that would be the first\nthing I would think of.\n\n1456\n01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:21,440\nIs that, the tools present.\n\n1457\n01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,810\nYou mentioned camera shy,\nmaybe that's there.\n\n1458\n01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:29,700\nOr maybe they just plain deleted\nthat stuff off their author system.\n\n1459\n01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:32,720\nUninstalled it and got rid of everything.\n\n1460\n01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:37,510\nWell, we've already early on in our\nprocess got an image of the file system,\n\n1461\n01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:39,240\nand presumably you went through and\n\n1462\n01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:42,680\ntried to do a file recovery on\nit to see what files were there.\n\n1463\n01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:46,880\nIf you do a close enough examination\non these things, you might find that\n\n1464\n01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:51,410\nthere's some applications there\nthat are used for this process.\n\n1465\n01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:52,590\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Who knows,\n\n1466\n01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:58,540\nmaybe you find that they've got\na directory full of personal photos,\n\n1467\n01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:01,820\nthe kids and family,\nthe vacation and stuff like that.\n\n1468\n01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:05,020\nBut then you also find that\nthere was another location where\n\n1469\n01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:05,815\nthey were deleted from.\n\n1470\n01:26:05,815 --> 01:26:08,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1471\n01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,900\n>> What happened there?\n\n1472\n01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:10,700\nDid they move them?\n\n1473\n01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:15,610\nOr was that something they were\ndoing something else with?\n\n1474\n01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:19,090\nOr was this a case of those with\nthe original, unaltered copyies and\n\n1475\n01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:20,910\nthey deleted them off the system.\n\n1476\n01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:27,085\nSo you very well could get other things\n\n1477\n01:26:27,085 --> 01:26:31,380\nto help you say that they are there.\n\n1478\n01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:39,650\nAlso remember Steganography is used\na lot for totally legal reasons.\n\n1479\n01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:43,610\nLot of the companies will use it for\nDRM purposes.\n\n1480\n01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:45,250\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So just because you're doing an\n\n1481\n01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:49,920\ninvestigation and you see a bunch of media\nor something on someone's driving you.\n\n1482\n01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,320\nAnd you analyze those\nas part of your thing.\n\n1483\n01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:56,610\nAnd you find out that they've\ngot this media on there.\n\n1484\n01:26:56,610 --> 01:27:00,220\nAnd when you analyze it, oh there's\nsome things hidden inside these.\n\n1485\n01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:03,720\nIt indicates that there's\nsomething hidden in these files.\n\n1486\n01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:07,620\nWell, you may have to ask\nyourself at that point.\n\n1487\n01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:10,990\nIs that the DRM that\nthe record company put in,\n\n1488\n01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:14,800\nthat this person is saving\nsome of their songs.\n\n1489\n01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,750\nMaybe they've gone up to Amazon music and\nbought a bunch of stuff and\n\n1490\n01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:22,110\nstored it on their drive or\ntheir mobile device or what have you.\n\n1491\n01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:25,800\nAnd those are gonna be DRM'd,\nthose will have watermarks and\n\n1492\n01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,340\nstuff like that hidden inside of them.\n\n1493\n01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:30,340\nAnd that is totally legit.\n\n1494\n01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:34,855\nSo that can be something that\ncan throw you, through this.\n\n1495\n01:27:34,855 --> 01:27:38,511\nI'd also mention, by the way,\nthat there's these ways\n\n1496\n01:27:38,511 --> 01:27:43,080\nthat you can detect steganography\nthrough the methods we talked here,\n\n1497\n01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:47,039\nand do steganography through\nthe methods we talked here- But\n\n1498\n01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:51,561\nthere's some other kind of more\nexotic ways too, just to mention it.\n\n1499\n01:27:51,561 --> 01:27:56,846\nAnd this is just for your information,\nit's kinda tough to deal with,\n\n1500\n01:27:56,846 --> 01:28:02,940\nbut there have been proven concepts that\nshow some of these more exotic ways work.\n\n1501\n01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:08,950\nOne of the ones that comes to mind that I\nwas just gonna throw out there is someone\n\n1502\n01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:15,660\nfound a way to do steganography not by\naltering the files on the drive but\n\n1503\n01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:19,838\naltering the way data\nwas stored on the drive.\n\n1504\n01:28:19,838 --> 01:28:25,310\nAnd so, what's actually happening\nis that if you image that drive,\n\n1505\n01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:29,710\nif you do a logical image of it,\nyou do a bit stream and\n\n1506\n01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:32,150\nor a logical one, you will get the data.\n\n1507\n01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:35,150\nYou will be able to analyze\ndeleted files and all that, but\n\n1508\n01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:40,060\nyou still won't find this message\nunless you know how to look.\n\n1509\n01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:44,400\nCuz what they done is, they've gone to\nthe way files are actually stored, and\n\n1510\n01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:50,120\nwhat they've done is kind of broken up\nfiles that are stored on the system.\n\n1511\n01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:53,190\nThey moved them around, and\nthis is not deleted files,\n\n1512\n01:28:53,190 --> 01:28:54,730\nthese are files that\nare currently on there.\n\n1513\n01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:57,730\nThey've moved them around, so\nif you look at a map of the drive,\n\n1514\n01:28:57,730 --> 01:29:02,370\nif you have a utility that can view\nthe map of that platter on that drive,\n\n1515\n01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:07,040\nor whatever drive you're using, you could\njust basically look at it like a record.\n\n1516\n01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:11,640\nYou can go around, and contiguous\naddresses all the way toward the center.\n\n1517\n01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,240\nAnd the file being there, or\nthe lack of file being there,\n\n1518\n01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,170\nis equivalent to ones and zeros.\n\n1519\n01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:18,650\nAnd that will reconstruct the message.\n\n1520\n01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:20,340\nSomeone created a program like that.\n\n1521\n01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:23,130\nThat you can just type in something and\nit will do a,\n\n1522\n01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:26,140\nI guess it's kind of\nthe opposite of a defrag better.\n\n1523\n01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:28,242\nIt's fragmenting files purposely, but\n\n1524\n01:29:28,242 --> 01:29:31,903\nit's fragmenting them in such a way\nthat if you look at the drive map, and\n\n1525\n01:29:31,903 --> 01:29:35,948\nonly if you look at the drive map, will\nthat pattern emerge that you can decode.\n\n1526\n01:29:35,948 --> 01:29:37,235\n>> Interesting.\n\n1527\n01:29:37,235 --> 01:29:38,175\nBrilliant [LAUGH].\n\n1528\n01:29:38,175 --> 01:29:40,555\n>> Yeah, it's brilliant, it really is.\n\n1529\n01:29:40,555 --> 01:29:44,021\nWhen I first saw that,\nI had to read it a couple times, I'm like,\n\n1530\n01:29:44,021 --> 01:29:45,419\nthey're doing what now?\n\n1531\n01:29:45,419 --> 01:29:47,311\nAnd it just was they did it that way.\n\n1532\n01:29:47,311 --> 01:29:49,332\nThey were using it, essentially.\n\n1533\n01:29:49,332 --> 01:29:53,226\nAnd when I got my head around what\nthey were doing, it was like,\n\n1534\n01:29:53,226 --> 01:29:55,550\nwhat you would do with a record?\n\n1535\n01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:57,110\nI'm thinking of like a record player.\n\n1536\n01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:58,550\nYou just drop a needle on it, and\n\n1537\n01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:01,030\nit just works its way around and\nplays the music back.\n\n1538\n01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:01,870\nThat's what they're doing.\n\n1539\n01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:06,900\nThey're just breaking up\nfiles to form patterns, and\n\n1540\n01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:11,950\nyou can just, 110, 1010, whether or\nnot there's a file in that cluster or not.\n\n1541\n01:30:11,950 --> 01:30:16,840\nYou just go ahead and read the clusters\nfrom the first address on there,\n\n1542\n01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,570\nall the way to the last address.\n\n1543\n01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,430\n>> Impressive stuff.\n\n1544\n01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:22,313\nWell, tell you what.\n\n1545\n01:30:22,313 --> 01:30:26,602\nWe had a good episode here,\ntalked a lot about steganography and\n\n1546\n01:30:26,602 --> 01:30:31,289\nimage file forensics, all the way\nfrom what steganography was to some\n\n1547\n01:30:31,289 --> 01:30:36,215\nof the different tools that we could\nuse to do steganography with images,\n\n1548\n01:30:36,215 --> 01:30:37,579\nvideos, and mp3.\n\n1549\n01:30:37,579 --> 01:30:40,406\nAnd then, some of the ways\nthat we can detect whether or\n\n1550\n01:30:40,406 --> 01:30:44,279\nnot steganography has been used,\nwhen we're searching that machine, or\n\n1551\n01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:47,920\nwhatever it is, for evidence,\nas a digital forensic investigator.\n\n1552\n01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,920\nIs there anything else we\nwanna add to this episode?\n\n1553\n01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:57,530\n>> Let me just add on, just to kind of\na quick aside or a trivia thing in here,\n\n1554\n01:30:57,530 --> 01:31:02,040\ncuz I think it's kinda fun to show you or\nto talk about some of these,\n\n1555\n01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,670\nof how steganography,\nsteganography has been around for ages.\n\n1556\n01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:09,400\nAnd one of the ones that always just\nfascinates me and the creativity people\n\n1557\n01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:15,859\nget to hide messages in plain sight goes\nway back for digital ages and all that.\n\n1558\n01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:22,550\nThe feudal Japan, they actually found a\nway to do a form of steganography which is\n\n1559\n01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:27,510\namazingly quite clever and\nyou can google this, the full thing.\n\n1560\n01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:29,540\nI won't give you the full story here.\n\n1561\n01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:34,170\nBut they found a method to pass\nmessages between warlords, or\n\n1562\n01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:35,940\ndeimos, they called them.\n\n1563\n01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:38,470\nThey would boil an egg,\nand then take the egg and\n\n1564\n01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:41,090\nthey'd write on the shell\nwith a special ink.\n\n1565\n01:31:41,090 --> 01:31:43,820\nAnd that ink would actually\ngo through the shell and\n\n1566\n01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:46,380\nembed itself on the surface of the egg.\n\n1567\n01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:49,910\nAnd so, then, you'd throw that boiled egg\nin with a bunch of other boiled eggs.\n\n1568\n01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:52,450\nAnd just carry that wherever.\n\n1569\n01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:56,931\nWhen it gets to the other side,\nthey just carefully peel off the shell and\n\n1570\n01:31:56,931 --> 01:31:58,767\nthey dip it in the solution and\n\n1571\n01:31:58,767 --> 01:32:02,455\nit will stick everywhere on\nthe egg except where the ink is.\n\n1572\n01:32:02,455 --> 01:32:03,058\n>> I'll be darn.\n\n1573\n01:32:03,058 --> 01:32:09,020\n>> And so\nit's a perfect form of steganography.\n\n1574\n01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:13,004\nIt's something that, how are you gonna\ndetect it unless you go through,\n\n1575\n01:32:13,004 --> 01:32:15,136\nsearch every egg, which they know-\n>> And\n\n1576\n01:32:15,136 --> 01:32:16,900\nthe message was there in the first place.\n\n1577\n01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:20,010\nThis person was not just\ncarrying a basket of eggs.\n\n1578\n01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:22,790\n>> Yeah and\nit fits to what we're talking about.\n\n1579\n01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:24,315\nIt's right there in plain sight.\n\n1580\n01:32:24,315 --> 01:32:28,584\n>> [COUGH]\n>> Anybody could be carrying some eggs and\n\n1581\n01:32:28,584 --> 01:32:30,698\nyou wouldn't know it was there.\n\n1582\n01:32:30,698 --> 01:32:33,360\nIt's always fascinating me.\n\n1583\n01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,970\nIt goes to that creativity\nof human beings and\n\n1584\n01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:41,410\nstuff like that because way before the\ndigital age, way before any technology,\n\n1585\n01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:47,280\nwe're talking, I believe that was like 15,\n1600 type stuff they were using it.\n\n1586\n01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:52,015\nSo, it goes back a long, long way.\n\n1587\n01:32:52,015 --> 01:32:55,285\n>> We've been hiding stuff\nsince we've had stuff to hide.\n\n1588\n01:32:55,285 --> 01:32:55,945\n>>

Good morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening!\n\n5\n00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,920\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,950\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,270\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,270\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n9\n00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,050\nHow are you?.\n\n10\n00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,390\n>> Man I am doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,860\nI mean we're doing\nDigital Forensic Investigator.\n\n12\n00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,370\nIt doesn't get any better\nthan this does it?\n\n13\n00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:50,950\nI mean really.\n\n14\n00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,330\n>> Absolutely not.\n\n15\n00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,650\n>> So, in this episode we're going\nto be going over Mobile Forensics.\n\n16\n00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,060\nObviously, this is gonna be a big part\nof investigations nowadays because\n\n17\n00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,430\nthere are so many mobile devices and\n\n18\n00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,570\nthey can hold all kinds of information so\ngood stuff here, right Sean?\n\n19\n00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,580\n>> Yeah, it's a real kinda\nexciting area and it's also,\n\n20\n00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:19,260\nif they're any area we can say that's\nbleeding edge and is rapidly developing.\n\n21\n00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,332\nIt is this area.\n\n22\n00:01:20,332 --> 00:01:25,170\nYou're gonna find that there's\na lot of probably's and\n\n23\n00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,680\nmaybe's and new stuff, and you may\nhear stuff during this that you say,\n\n24\n00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,880\nI know differently for\nthis device or this situation.\n\n25\n00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,400\nI'm not gonna argue with it.\n\n26\n00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,240\nThe field changes so quickly and\nthere's such a broad amount of systems and\n\n27\n00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,360\ndevices out there and ways they're set up,\nthat it poses a real challenge.\n\n28\n00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,360\nAnd that's something to think about\nis that, since this field is so\n\n29\n00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,070\nrapidly evolving around mobile and\nthings that are deployed into,\n\n30\n00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,170\nand different devices that can be paired\nup and you know when we talk about\n\n31\n00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,710\nmobile devices,\nit is the devices that are paired up to.\n\n32\n00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:09,860\nIt's not just, hey I got my smartphone or\nmy tablet, and I need to go and\n\n33\n00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,920\nget a search warrant to search and\nseize that potentially.\n\n34\n00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,510\nIt's not just that.\n\n35\n00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,450\nYou also have these other devices sitting\nout there that people pair with it.\n\n36\n00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,702\nThink of your smartphone,\nhow many things you pair that with.\n\n37\n00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:29,764\nThink of just in your home and\nall the stuff they sell like your home\n\n38\n00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:36,137\nimprovement stores, that you can control\nin your house with just a smart device.\n\n39\n00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:38,490\n>> Right.\n>> You've got your cable providers that\n\n40\n00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,352\nallow use your mobile devices to\ncontrol the security on your home,\n\n41\n00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:47,094\nover the internet, then you've got light\nbulbs that you can use your smartphone,\n\n42\n00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:51,615\nto adjust the hue and the color to get\nthat romantic mood lighting I guess on it.\n\n43\n00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:54,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You've got something you can monitor\n\n44\n00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,300\nyour pool, your pets, your, you name it.\n\n45\n00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,720\nThey're all out there.\n\n46\n00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,270\nThey have that whole Internet\nof things that they talk about.\n\n47\n00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,971\nIt's almost the same type of stuff\nthat we have with our mobile and\n\n48\n00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:10,534\nsmart devices that there.\n\n49\n00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:12,670\nThey know most of the people\nhave those things.\n\n50\n00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,291\nThey're finding everyday new ways to hook\nother devices and new services up to it.\n\n51\n00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,770\nSo, that could be,\n\n52\n00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:24,081\nthe smartphone could just be the center\nof a huge Ecosystem of devices and\n\n53\n00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:29,780\nservices that you have to consider and\nmay have to search as part of this.\n\n54\n00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,900\n>> Yeah, I mean nowadays, it could\nbe that the whole entire attack or\n\n55\n00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,200\ncrime took place on mobile devices.\n\n56\n00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,760\nIt never did take place on\na traditional notebook, or laptop, or\n\n57\n00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,190\ndesktop, or something like that.\n\n58\n00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,940\nThese devices are everywhere.\n\n59\n00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,050\nWhen we talk about mobile devices, and\n\n60\n00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,360\nthere's a few we obviously\nthink of everything.\n\n61\n00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,876\nWe think of our smartphones.\n\n62\n00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:51,480\nAnd our laptops maybe.\n\n63\n00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,750\nBut really not so much laptops because\nthose kinda fall under our desktops.\n\n64\n00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,100\nBut smartphones and others?\n\n65\n00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,890\n>> Yes.\n\n66\n00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:05,725\nSmartphones, tablets would be another\none that's incredibly common.\n\n67\n00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:09,980\nAnd, it's kinda funny,\nyou know I think about it that.\n\n68\n00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,440\nYou were saying that laptops,\nyou kinda consider them under desktops,\n\n69\n00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,000\nit's kind of funny.\n\n70\n00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,440\n>> That used to be\nconsidered a mobile stuff.\n\n71\n00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,446\nYou said something is mobile, hey,\nyou got a laptop, you're mobile!\n\n72\n00:04:19,446 --> 00:04:21,520\n>> I really felt pretty for\nthis stupid saying that.\n\n73\n00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,190\nI'm like, wait,\nlaptops that's not a mobile device.\n\n74\n00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,357\nWait, but it's not right,\n\n75\n00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:31,973\nin this context we don't consider\na laptop a mobile device.\n\n76\n00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:34,028\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's one of those things\n\n77\n00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:34,822\neasily to be honest.\n\n78\n00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:39,467\nIt could be one of the things that,\neasily straddles a line,\n\n79\n00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:45,391\nbecause people think of mobile devices\nas those things, the smartphones and\n\n80\n00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:50,600\nthe tablets, they definitely things\nthat we associate with that.\n\n81\n00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,440\nAnd people are carrying them around.\n\n82\n00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,290\nWhen I was at Disney World by a few days\nago, and you see people carrying them.\n\n83\n00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,080\nIt's carrying tablets, and\ntaking pictures of those, and cell phones.\n\n84\n00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,180\nThey are mobile devices.\n\n85\n00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,890\n>> And this thing, you know,\nI mean ok, so if I take this guy and\n\n86\n00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,970\nroll it around here.\n\n87\n00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,910\nWell now it's a tablet and\nit's a mobile device.\n\n88\n00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,840\nOr it falls into the mobile device\ncategory and what we're speaking of here.\n\n89\n00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,410\nRight?\n\n90\n00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,000\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, yeah.\n\n91\n00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,511\n>> That's the exact point\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:19,496\n>> I was going for.is that,\n\n93\n00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:24,380\na laptop used to be considered\na mobile device by a lot of people.\n\n94\n00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,230\nIt's still is, if you're a road warrior or\nsomething like that.\n\n95\n00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,690\nIt's definitely something\nthat's mobile for you.\n\n96\n00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,855\nIt has to be mobile by it's,\nby its very nature.\n\n97\n00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:34,765\nBut now,\n\n98\n00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:39,535\nyou've got the traditional notebooks are\nkind of like if people look at anything,\n\n99\n00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:43,105\nthey're like that's not really mobile\ncuz I still gotta sit down and\n\n100\n00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:47,217\nuse it, and I want something like I can\nwalk, and be really unencumbered with it.\n\n101\n00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:51,977\nWell, low and behold that your device\nyou can flip around, turn tablet.\n\n102\n00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:57,340\nThis one, my screen on this one I\ncan turn around and do stuff on it.\n\n103\n00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,940\nI've got another one in my bag that I\ncan flip the screen around the yoga.\n\n104\n00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,010\n>> So really it's just another example\nof where we use these categories,\n\n105\n00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,340\nbasically to make it easier\nto talk about this stuff.\n\n106\n00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,940\nBut, not everything fits nice and\nneat into one of these categories.\n\n107\n00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,903\nYeah.\nSo when we talk about mobile devices,\n\n108\n00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:20,207\nit's really not the fact that whether or\nnot they can move or not, because laptops,\n\n109\n00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:22,346\nnetbooks, those can move, obviously.\n\n110\n00:06:22,346 --> 00:06:24,532\nI'm talking about mobile devices here,\n\n111\n00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:27,849\nwe're typically talking things\nother than laptops, right?\n\n112\n00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:28,770\n>> Yeah.\n\n113\n00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,810\n>> They're just getting more and\nmore common as you said.\n\n114\n00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,500\nWe got smartphones, we got tablets,\n\n115\n00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,734\nwe got media players would be\nconsidered a mobile device.\n\n116\n00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:36,240\n>> Yes.\n\n117\n00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840\n>> And then our cars.\n\n118\n00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,354\n>> Even.\n\n119\n00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:38,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n120\n00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,090\nOur cars could hit, interestingly enough\nI really felt we're talking about this,\n\n121\n00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,170\nthat this is something that\nneeded to be considered.\n\n122\n00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,160\nObviously a car itself is mobile.\n\n123\n00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,110\nBut then you've got these modern vehicles,\nwhich have, you can bring\n\n124\n00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,890\nthat smartphone in, and it automatically\nlinks up to everything in your car.\n\n125\n00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,830\nJust about every modern car has that.\n\n126\n00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,700\n>> Nate's working on a carputer right now,\n\n127\n00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,340\nI think he's getting a RasPi and\nhe's gonna\n\n128\n00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,810\nbuild up a little carputer with a nice 7\ninch touch screen mounted in his dash.\n\n129\n00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,450\nThat'd be considered a mobile\ndevice at that point.\n\n130\n00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,250\n>> That's a common thing people are doing.\n\n131\n00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,440\nThey either come with the car or\nyou can upgrade them,\n\n132\n00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,160\nbecause we've come to expect those\nkinds of things in our vehicles.\n\n133\n00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,360\nTo have all these nice electronic gadgets\nand all those types of things in there.\n\n134\n00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,455\nMy Mustang is getting upgraded\nwith electronic warfare suite so.\n\n135\n00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:39,814\n[LAUGH]\n>> Things also got a rocket launchers\n\n136\n00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:40,354\non the side.\n\n137\n00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:41,562\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, I got shaft dispensers\n\n138\n00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:42,169\nand sweaters.\n\n139\n00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:42,889\n>> Yeah.\n\n140\n00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,634\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like a jam radar from like 20 miles\n\n141\n00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:47,278\naway.\n\n142\n00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:49,506\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is this most I now looks like one of\n\n143\n00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:52,059\nthose station wagon storm chasers or\nsomething.\n\n144\n00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:54,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Got antennas poking out everywhere.\n\n145\n00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,490\n>> This close from being\nkick from Night Rider.\n\n146\n00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,207\n>> [LAUGH] And then you've got\nthe different networks that these\n\n147\n00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:01,490\nmobile devices connect to.\n\n148\n00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,101\nIt's not just Ethernet, we've got\ndifferent connection methodologies.\n\n149\n00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:07,761\n>> Yes, there's all sorts of things.\n\n150\n00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:12,105\nThat's really the other\nthing that starts to\n\n151\n00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:17,261\nseparate traditional laptops\nfrom mobile devices.\n\n152\n00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:18,331\nTraditional laptops,\n\n153\n00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:23,144\nthey do have that, and this is one\nof the big differences I've see.\n\n154\n00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:26,210\nThey do have that port in\nthere to plug in a cable.\n\n155\n00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,610\nThe one, the laptops,\n\n156\n00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,320\nthe modern ones that we're expecting,\nthey don't even have those all that often.\n\n157\n00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,570\nThis one does have it.\n\n158\n00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,120\nIt does turn into a tablet.\n\n159\n00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,970\nBut it also,\nmine does also have a cable it plugs into.\n\n160\n00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,760\nI don't know does,\ndoes yours have a cable it plugs into to?\n\n161\n00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,970\n>> Mine yeah,\nyou probably see it on our screen here.\n\n162\n00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,885\nI'm actually using a little USB adapter\ncuz I do not have an RJ-45 plug\n\n163\n00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:47,020\non this thing.\n\n164\n00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,640\n>> Yeah, that's what my other notebook\nthat I use to do some of my demos and\n\n165\n00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,690\nmy forensics and pen testing on.\n\n166\n00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,225\nIt does not have that either.\n\n167\n00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:59,730\n>> Right.\n>> So you have to bring your own stuff.\n\n168\n00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,810\nThey don't even have, most notebooks\nnowadays don't even have those VGA or\n\n169\n00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,290\nwhatever adapters to plug in.\n\n170\n00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,220\nThey're doing the smaller adapters,\nthe more modern ones.\n\n171\n00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,210\nThose VGA ones used to be because oh, I'm\ngonna plug into a monitor or projector,\n\n172\n00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,620\nsomething like that.\n\n173\n00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,520\nThey don't expect those anymore.\n\n174\n00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,545\nThey expect wireless connections\neven to those projectors.\n\n175\n00:09:19,545 --> 00:09:20,120\n>> Yeah.\n\n176\n00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,040\n>> So it shows you the way\nthings are transitioning.\n\n177\n00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,810\nBut yeah it's these wireless networks,\nthat's where it's going to be.\n\n178\n00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,470\nYou are going to have some\nsort of wireless connectivity,\n\n179\n00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,320\nwhether it is long range or short range.\n\n180\n00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,850\nYou're gonna have it as part of your\ndevice, that's just the way it goes.\n\n181\n00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,790\nBut, and there's not just one,\nthough, that's the thing.\n\n182\n00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,850\nThere's not just one thing.\n\n183\n00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,945\nLook at all the stuff they've devised for\n\n184\n00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:50,270\nexchanging data amongst mobile\ndevices over the years.\n\n185\n00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,600\nI mean, we've got four here, but\n\n186\n00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,330\nthere are some others that you could\ntechnically throw into the mix.\n\n187\n00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,200\n>> Right?\nAnd the ones we've got listed here.\n\n188\n00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,010\nWe've got what, cellular?\n\n189\n00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,510\nA lot of them still do your Wi-Fi.\n\n190\n00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,950\nAnd we also have our Bluetooth\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n191\n00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,860\nAnd then brand new, or\nrelatively new to a lot of our devices,\n\n192\n00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,530\nis that Near field communications,\nover the last couple years.\n\n193\n00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,620\nThose have started showing up on devices.\n\n194\n00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n195\n00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,310\nNear field communications's\nis becoming very popular.\n\n196\n00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,550\nJust about, I don't know but it seems\nto me about every modern device has it.\n\n197\n00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,640\n>> Yeah, I know my iPhone 5S\nmissed it by like one model.\n\n198\n00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,590\nI want to say it's in the 6.\n\n199\n00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,300\nI'm pretty sure if I checked with Nate,\n\n200\n00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,840\nthat the Samsung now has that\nNear field communication.\n\n201\n00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,140\nYeah, it does, so and in what,\nthe Galaxy S5 or the Note?\n\n202\n00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,490\nI think, the Note so,yeah.\n\n203\n00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,380\nIt's in a lot of these and granted\nit's gonna be, obviously, Near field.\n\n204\n00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,600\nIt's a very, very, very short range.\n\n205\n00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,220\nBut it is another way that these\ndevices could be transmitting data\n\n206\n00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,020\nthat we've got to worry about.\n\n207\n00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,430\nAnd then you throw on top of that,\n\n208\n00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,360\nall the different operating systems\nthat are running on these devices.\n\n209\n00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,240\n>> Oh yeah, that's another big,\nbig, big mess.\n\n210\n00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,400\nYou know we've used that\nterm a lot in this course.\n\n211\n00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,250\nAnd it may seem like we've\nused it a little too\n\n212\n00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,210\nliberally-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n213\n00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,670\n>> In this course.\n\n214\n00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,870\nI hope I haven't diminished\nthe weight of the term.\n\n215\n00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,430\nBut there's definitely\nsome situations where\n\n216\n00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,500\nthere's a huge can of worms to be opened.\n\n217\n00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,800\nAnd a big mess coming out of it,\n\n218\n00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,130\nand mobile operating systems\ndefinitely fit that bill.\n\n219\n00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,708\nBy any definition.\n\n220\n00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:36,550\n[LAUGH] There is so many,\nmore than you might think.\n\n221\n00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,390\nAnd that's the thing that we\nwant to make sure we get clear.\n\n222\n00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,079\nThe operating systems are not just,\nhey there is an operating system and\n\n223\n00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,910\nthere it is, it's Windows.\n\n224\n00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,304\nEven Windows, just to lead into this.\n\n225\n00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:52,042\nWindows, you look at it you've got\nWindows 7, and you've got Windows 8,\n\n226\n00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:53,430\nwe'll just take those two.\n\n227\n00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,014\nCan you really say, that hey,\nI've got Windows 7.\n\n228\n00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:57,819\n>> Not compatible.\n\n229\n00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:02,260\n>> Yeah, you can't say, oh,\nI got Windows 7 on this machine.\n\n230\n00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,205\nBecause if you are going\nto be doing support or\n\n231\n00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:10,520\ndoing any technical stuff, now it is,\nwhat version of Windows 7?\n\n232\n00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,500\nWhat service packs do you have?\n\n233\n00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,850\nDo you have this loaded and this loaded?\n\n234\n00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,930\nThat means there\nare different versions and\n\n235\n00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:23,285\ndifferent variations and\ndifferent shades of the operating system.\n\n236\n00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:30,540\nSo if we extend that out a bit to\nthe mobile operating system world.\n\n237\n00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,389\nThat's where it just goes crazy,\nand it is a mess.\n\n238\n00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,352\n>> It's just no other way to put it.\n\n239\n00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:38,268\n>> All right, I'm trying to think, I know\nyou got a nice tidy list for us here.\n\n240\n00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:43,760\nJust off the top of my head I can think\nof iOS, you've got your Windows mobile.\n\n241\n00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,050\nYou've got your Android devices.\n\n242\n00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,680\nWhat's some other ones?\n\n243\n00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,640\n>> Those would be the big three, really.\n\n244\n00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,220\n>> Those are the ones that pop\ninto my brain immediately.\n\n245\n00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,330\n>> And just to pause on those three,\niOS, it's reasonably simple.\n\n246\n00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,170\nIf there's anything on the list that\nwe could say is reasonably simple\n\n247\n00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,020\nto deal with, it is the iOS.\n\n248\n00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,553\nBecause the iOS.\n\n249\n00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:05,447\n>> It just works.\n\n250\n00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:07,970\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Oh yeah, filters in.\n\n251\n00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,134\n>> But\nthere's versions of it out there, but\n\n252\n00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:18,590\nthey're restricted to the iPhone devices.\n\n253\n00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,760\nAnd I guess,\nwhat the iPad uses it too, I guess?\n\n254\n00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,550\n>> Yep.\n\n255\n00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,213\n>> But\nthey've got it on those platforms and\n\n256\n00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:31,095\nApple controls the manufacturer and,\nor the whole supply chain with that.\n\n257\n00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:35,454\nSo because it's their operating system,\ntheir supply chain,\n\n258\n00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:40,551\neverything is integrated, it works\ntogether pretty nicely and all that.\n\n259\n00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:45,807\nThat's something that, because of\nthe way Apple does its stuff, versus\n\n260\n00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:51,490\neveryone else that they have an advantage\nin that area over the other ones.\n\n261\n00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,210\nBecause there's a small number of\niOS operating system out there.\n\n262\n00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,680\nIf you just turn the corner,\nand go to Android.\n\n263\n00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,980\nAndroid is, Google came out with that.\n\n264\n00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,690\nAnd it's based on Linux.\n\n265\n00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,000\nAnd they did some tweaking everything\non it to make the specialized one for\n\n266\n00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,190\nmobile platforms.\n\n267\n00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,293\nYou know, it's not like well Google\ncame out with it and, you know.\n\n268\n00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:19,200\nAnd Google, when they brought up the thing\nand tweaked it and put it out there.\n\n269\n00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,470\nThat's the Android operating system.\n\n270\n00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,750\nAll you gotta do is, like Windows,\nput it on your device's manufacturer and\n\n271\n00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,890\nyou're good to go.\n\n272\n00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,175\nNo manufacturer leaves that untouched.\n\n273\n00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:28,740\n>> Right.\n\n274\n00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,970\n>> Google has their, for\nexample, the Nexus devices.\n\n275\n00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,430\nAnd those are there,\nthose are essentially their devices.\n\n276\n00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,260\nAnd so those ones are probably\nsome of the cleaner devices and\n\n277\n00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,560\nclosest to the original Android spec.\n\n278\n00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,732\nIf you're just talking generically,\n\n279\n00:14:45,732 --> 00:14:48,504\nthey probably fit most of\nthe definition of that.\n\n280\n00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:56,934\nBut once you start going to a Samsung S4\nlet's say, that's what I have.\n\n281\n00:14:56,934 --> 00:15:01,720\nIf you got it as a Samsung S4 and\nyou put it on an AT&T network,\n\n282\n00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,845\nor a Verizon, or a Sprint.\n\n283\n00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:07,285\nEveryone of those vendors does\nsomething to it to monkey with it,\n\n284\n00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:11,425\nto make it different not only for that\ndevice, but for that service provider.\n\n285\n00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:15,199\nSo that means,\nif you are someone that's doing forensics,\n\n286\n00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,980\nthat is a different device.\n\n287\n00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,210\nFor a lot of purposes you could be\ngetting into, that is a different device.\n\n288\n00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,600\nBecause of what it will connect to,\nwhat it will support.\n\n289\n00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,002\nAnd that's not even bringing in the fact\nthat you have different versions of\n\n290\n00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:30,840\nAndroid too.\n\n291\n00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,942\n>> I was going to say,\nhalf the people here,\n\n292\n00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:36,270\nthe first thing they do when they\nget their phone, is rootkit it.\n\n293\n00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,680\nThey change it up, they put some custom\nOS on it or something like that.\n\n294\n00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,490\nSo it's not even what came with the phone.\n\n295\n00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,920\nAnd each one of these platforms,\nwhy does it matter?\n\n296\n00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,650\nWell as you were saying,\n\n297\n00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,230\ndifferent methods of connectivity and\na lot of it is different storage methods.\n\n298\n00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,601\nRight?\nThey have different file systems.\n\n299\n00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:53,359\nDifferent ways they store the data\nin their internal flash memory and\n\n300\n00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,410\nthings like that.\n\n301\n00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,044\nAnd as a forensic investigator,\nI got to be able to dive in and\n\n302\n00:15:57,044 --> 00:16:00,351\nget that information somehow, so\nI've really got to have an understanding\n\n303\n00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:02,930\nof the way all of these\ndifferent guys behave.\n\n304\n00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,320\n>> Yeah, they've all got their\nlittle nuances and little things.\n\n305\n00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,450\nThat's again, that's where the different,\nif we were talking about Android,\n\n306\n00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,206\nthat's where the different\nversions of Android come in.\n\n307\n00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:20,540\nIs that I've had,\nI think probably a lot of us here,\n\n308\n00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,700\non set, and all that, and\nback over here and all that,\n\n309\n00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,490\nall of us being people that are technical\nas well as those of you out there.\n\n310\n00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,010\nWe've all that situation that we have\na phone and they look at us as being\n\n311\n00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,290\nthe techie, so they're like,\ncan you help me with something here?\n\n312\n00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,570\nAnd so you help them with their phone and\n\n313\n00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,450\nyou're like, Okay,\ntheir phone is running Android.\n\n314\n00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,410\nOkay, well, I've got Android on my phone.\n\n315\n00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,090\nThis should be easy.\n\n316\n00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,900\nAnd you're like what the heck\ndid they do to your phone.\n\n317\n00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,770\nIt's just, nothings in the same place,\nthere's different menus on there.\n\n318\n00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,580\nOr some of the stuff is in the same place,\n\n319\n00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,090\nbut then there's a whole\nbunch of stuff that's not.\n\n320\n00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,930\nAnd it can be confusing.\n\n321\n00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,490\nThat's just for\nus from someone trying to do,\n\n322\n00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,580\nfrom the standpoint of wanting to help and\nwork with that device to assist someone.\n\n323\n00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,440\nOnce you start factoring in\nthe forensics side, like you said,\n\n324\n00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,570\nyou have memory and\nall those other types of things.\n\n325\n00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,520\nAnd stuff like that happening.\n\n326\n00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,950\nAnd that becomes a whole other\nshooting match in there,\n\n327\n00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,779\nand then you talk about rooting a device.\n\n328\n00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,660\nWhat these guys are doing back\nhere with rooting their devices.\n\n329\n00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,610\nIt's not just them,\nthat's an extremely common thing for\n\n330\n00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,870\npeople to do, is to root or\njailbreak their device.\n\n331\n00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,760\nAnd that adds another layer onto this and\n\n332\n00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,000\na lot of people when they get their\ndevice, that's one of the first things\n\n333\n00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,150\nthey look towards doing is I'm\ngonna root this device and\n\n334\n00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,450\nI'm gonna put all this stuff on there,\nthey just can't wait to do it.\n\n335\n00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,900\n>> I think, there's one guy here that,\n\n336\n00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,860\nhe doesn't even fire it up\nwith the original OS on it.\n\n337\n00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,775\nI mean, first thing he does is rip it\napart, root it, or what do you call it,\n\n338\n00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:05,460\njailbreak it cuz he knows before he's\ndone his research on the device,\n\n339\n00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,710\nhe wants that device.\n\n340\n00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,070\nAnd the first thing he does when\nhe gets it is jailbreak it.\n\n341\n00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,530\nDon't even fire it up with\nthe actual OS that came with it.\n\n342\n00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,880\nAnd then there's others besides\nthose big three, right?\n\n343\n00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,740\nThere's Blackberry if anybody out there,\n\n344\n00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,010\nif anybody is running\na Blackberry let me know.\n\n345\n00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,420\nBut yeah, they are still out there,\n\n346\n00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,340\nthey're hanging around\nlike a hair in a biscuit.\n\n347\n00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,420\nThey're trying to come back with some\ngood phones, webOS is another one.\n\n348\n00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:33,304\n>> It's funny, Blackberry,\nour viewers may not know\n\n349\n00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:37,300\nis that Blackberry is one of those things.\n\n350\n00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,940\nBefore it was RAM and then it changed to\nBlackberry and they had those Blackberry\n\n351\n00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,220\nseries of devices and they had their\nown custom OS that they developed.\n\n352\n00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,870\nAnd then they just have gone through and\ndone a bunch of stuff with it.\n\n353\n00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,540\nYou remember how they were the thing\nif you didn't have a Blackberry.\n\n354\n00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,230\n>> I loved my Blackberry,\nit was like crack.\n\n355\n00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,960\nI loved that tactile keyboard that it had.\n\n356\n00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,970\nIt's a beautiful thing.\n\n357\n00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,070\n>> Yeah, people love that, and there are\nstill businesses out there that use it but\n\n358\n00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,900\nthey're not the juggernaut\nthat they were before.\n\n359\n00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,890\nHowever, that story, there may be\n\n360\n00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,170\nanother big chapter coming on\nthat because if you look at,\n\n361\n00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:20,360\nfor example,\nsome of the auto manufacturers.\n\n362\n00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,750\nI know for example,\n\n363\n00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,830\nFord made it was running a Windows\nplatform in their cars with SYNC.\n\n364\n00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,220\n>> SYNC and everything, yep.\n\n365\n00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,805\n>> That they were running and\nthat's Microsoft's\n\n366\n00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:38,310\ntechnology in my car,\nI had a Microsoft thing in my car.\n\n367\n00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,080\n>> Nice.\n\n368\n00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,677\n>> And I didn't want to crash my car.\n\n369\n00:19:41,677 --> 00:19:43,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I couldn't help it.\n\n370\n00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,900\n>> Yeah right.\n\n371\n00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,820\n>> So.\n>> It'll take out Windows.\n\n372\n00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,340\n>> Yeah, I was like that's not good.\n\n373\n00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,740\nBut in any case they had some\nissues apparently with sync and\n\n374\n00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,440\nsome things they just didn't like.\n\n375\n00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,940\nIn fact my car had someone,\n\n376\n00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,020\nwhen I was in a parking lot, someone just\nhappened to park the same model car but\n\n377\n00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,040\nfrom the previous year, and\nthey asked me hey, how old is it?\n\n378\n00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,030\nAnd I'm going oh, it's seven months old,\nwe're just having a quick discussion.\n\n379\n00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,480\nShe immediately asked me, she goes,\nwell how's SYNC working in yours?\n\n380\n00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,630\nI'm like I've had no problems.\n\n381\n00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,650\nAnd she's like, oh well, that's good.\n\n382\n00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,100\nMaybe I should have waited a year,\nso she's had some problems and\n\n383\n00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,470\nI've heard people say that to and in any\ncase getting to kind of the core of this.\n\n384\n00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,580\nFord actually signed a contract with\n\n385\n00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,720\nBlackberry to move that\noperating system into their car.\n\n386\n00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,440\n>> Interesting.\n\n387\n00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,600\n>> So, you'll see that pop up.\n\n388\n00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,760\nFord is really selling a lot of vehicles,\n\n389\n00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,950\nso that means you got a lot of\nnew vehicles with Blackberry or\n\n390\n00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:54,140\nthat OS coming out on the road in\nthe next maybe couple of years or so.\n\n391\n00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,040\nSo that could be writing a very\n\n392\n00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,170\nbig chapter in the metamorphosis\nof what Blackberry is.\n\n393\n00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,500\nAnd then Windows,\nwho know what that means to them,\n\n394\n00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,785\ncause Windows had that special\nmobile stuff that they had in there.\n\n395\n00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:08,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n396\n00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,850\n>> Windows has their mobile operating\nsystem you mentioned earlier.\n\n397\n00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,740\nWindows mobile,\n\n398\n00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,450\nhow many people do you know that\nhave Windows mobile on their phones?\n\n399\n00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,970\n>> I have one person that has the phone,\ncause I remember playing around with\n\n400\n00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,370\nCortana, but yeah,\nWindows Mobile kind of came and went and\n\n401\n00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,830\nnow Windows 8.1 kind of standardized\nit across all platforms, but.\n\n402\n00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,540\n>> Yeah, it's still there, but I've met\none guy over the past year that had it.\n\n403\n00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,020\nWe were just heckling him about it.\n\n404\n00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,560\nHey, just telling him,\nhe says you got Windows mobile.\n\n405\n00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:45,530\nYou know, we had people in this\nsituation that had iPhones and\n\n406\n00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,015\nthe Androids and\nthen we had the one Windows mobile guy.\n\n407\n00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,685\nWe were talking about different things,\nit was actually about hacking.\n\n408\n00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:55,025\nAnd we're talking about it and\nthe guy says, yeah, I don't have that.\n\n409\n00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,845\nI can't get that.\n\n410\n00:21:56,845 --> 00:22:00,832\nAnd we eventually learned when he said,\nhe said I've got Windows mobile.\n\n411\n00:22:00,832 --> 00:22:02,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm like, oh, so\n\n412\n00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,045\nyou're the guy that bought it.\n\n413\n00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:06,450\n>> [LAUGH] There was that\none guy that bought it.\n\n414\n00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,560\n>> Yeah he was like,\nhe had that look on his face.\n\n415\n00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,570\nI remember I was looking at his face like,\nyeah, I'm the guy.\n\n416\n00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,142\nAnd he said I'm getting rid\nof this as soon as possible.\n\n417\n00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:20,076\nThe app store has nothing in it and really\njust bogus stuff like kid's games and\n\n418\n00:22:20,076 --> 00:22:22,410\nthings like that, nothing useful.\n\n419\n00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,450\nSo that's a thing, but\nfrom a forensics standpoint,\n\n420\n00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,866\nit is out there, and Microsoft doesn't\nseem to be backing away from the platform.\n\n421\n00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:38,040\nThey're admitting losses on that, that\nthey're having from selling that Windows\n\n422\n00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,040\nmobile devices but\nthere's no Windows sign that's going away.\n\n423\n00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,700\nI think for 10,\nthey're still supporting it.\n\n424\n00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,300\nThey're doing a new version for 10.\n\n425\n00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,740\nSo it's still gonna be there, so\nwho knows, it's something that,\n\n426\n00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,680\neven though it's not a lot of it\nout there, you have to be prepared.\n\n427\n00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,080\nYou don't want that to be\nthe barrier that stops you.\n\n428\n00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,534\n>> And lots of different types of\ncrimes that they can be committed\n\n429\n00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:04,100\nusing these mobile devices.\n\n430\n00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:09,430\n>> Yeah, there's literally countless\nones that can be committed\n\n431\n00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,800\nwith a cell phone that you\nmay not have realized.\n\n432\n00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,640\nMay have experienced, I mean, who knows\nbut there's a lot of them tied to it.\n\n433\n00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,620\nWe have things like harassment and\nthat's gotten to be very popular,\n\n434\n00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,550\nunfortunately, with cell phones.\n\n435\n00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,420\nPeople have gotten very\nused to that thing's there.\n\n436\n00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,820\nAnd I kind of this is what I find\nkind of interesting that there's this\n\n437\n00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,240\nupsurge in harassment with mobile devices.\n\n438\n00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,430\nYou notice that there's more of this,\nat least from my viewpoint,\n\n439\n00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,055\nthere's more of that nastiness\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n440\n00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,348\n>> People will text in.\n\n441\n00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:46,965\nIt will text immediately.\n\n442\n00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:48,505\n>> Cuz I don't have to do it\nright to your face anymore.\n\n443\n00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:50,325\nI can do it from a safe distance,\nI don't have to face you.\n\n444\n00:23:50,325 --> 00:23:53,205\n>> Yeah,\nthat's definitely a big part of it, yeah.\n\n445\n00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:58,925\nEveryone's a tough guy when you're on\nthis side of the Quieter of a town.\n\n446\n00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:02,556\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Crack you in the face over that.\n\n447\n00:24:02,556 --> 00:24:08,276\nBut the thing I also think is part of\nthis, that is definitely a big part of it,\n\n448\n00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:11,620\nbut I think something\nelse that fits into it.\n\n449\n00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:18,160\nIt's just kinda my theory on this is\nthat when you, before mobile devices.\n\n450\n00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,960\nIf something just pardon my French,\npissed you off what did you have to do?\n\n451\n00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,143\nYou had to go home and [NOISE] and\nI'm going to let that purge.\n\n452\n00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:27,919\nYou had to do that.\n\n453\n00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,613\nSo unless that happened at home, which\nit did, you would be out someplace and\n\n454\n00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:39,055\nhear that someone said something\nabout you, or something bad happened.\n\n455\n00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:40,762\nBy the time you drove home and got home,\n\n456\n00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:42,872\nhe cooled off and\nhe didn't want to deal with that.\n\n457\n00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:43,862\nThat cooling off period.\n\n458\n00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:46,682\nNow, if you're pissed you've\ngot the device right there and\n\n459\n00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:48,072\nyou just say I'll show you.\n\n460\n00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:50,882\nYou've got it right there in the holster\nand you just and you just go for it.\n\n461\n00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:54,830\nThere's no cooling off now so\nit seems like that's the thing.\n\n462\n00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,390\nPeople don't think about that.\n\n463\n00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,490\nI mean how many times do you have to\ntell people with email for example.\n\n464\n00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,000\nThat's part of something that\nbusiness's say with email is if your\n\n465\n00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,030\ngonna send something that you\nthink is potentially inflammatory.\n\n466\n00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:17,140\nOr it's a response that might not be\na positive response to something.\n\n467\n00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,440\nThey said type it up, save it to your\ndrafts and go get a cup of water,\n\n468\n00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,290\ngo to the bathroom, come back five minutes\nto see if it still says what you want.\n\n469\n00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,120\nOr it you're being stupid.\n\n470\n00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,310\nAnd if you're still not sure,\n\n471\n00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:35,020\nhave a coworker that you trust read it,\nand see what they think.\n\n472\n00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,560\nSo they teach people these things,\nbut when you have a mobile device, and\n\n473\n00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,760\nit's basically unfiltered.\n\n474\n00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,940\nIt's coming right outta ya,\nit's attached to the hip.\n\n475\n00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,180\nBoop boop boop and it goes and then you're\nlike, oh, I shouldn't have sent that.\n\n476\n00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,390\n>> Too late now.\n\n477\n00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,890\n>> So that would be where\nharassment comes in and\n\n478\n00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,570\nenables that to be a lot\neasier with those devices and.\n\n479\n00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,860\nYeah I think probably\neverybody that's got,\n\n480\n00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,608\nthat has a mobile device has had to\nput up with some level of harassment.\n\n481\n00:26:03,608 --> 00:26:06,540\nBut even though they may not have\nthought of it as that that was just\n\n482\n00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,440\nconstant messages from someone.\n\n483\n00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,560\nMaybe not nasty messages from someone.\n\n484\n00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,114\n>> [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> Could be that but you see that sort of\n\n485\n00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:18,120\nthing is that those devices people\njust blast tons of text messages out.\n\n486\n00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,600\nWith just no care in the world.\n\n487\n00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,210\nYou see people just bugging you\nabout stuff, every sort of thing.\n\n488\n00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,420\nI think it's far to say a lot\nof us have experienced it, and\n\n489\n00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:39,210\nprobably a small subset of that has\nhad to deal with the nastiness,\n\n490\n00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,420\nthe threats and things like that.\n\n491\n00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,970\n>> Yeah, and then you got theft listed.\n\n492\n00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,290\nI mean, that's one of the big\nthings with these mobile devices.\n\n493\n00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,850\nThey are easy to steal, easy for\nsomebody to leave laying around.\n\n494\n00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,430\nI can't tell you how many times I've\nleft my phone in the back of a car,\n\n495\n00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,760\nin the back of the cab,\nat a restaurant or something like that.\n\n496\n00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,850\nKind of embarrassed to say, but\nit has happened more than once.\n\n497\n00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,960\nI've been pretty lucky with being able to\nget the device back, but It does happen,\n\n498\n00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,720\nand if it's my work phone.\n\n499\n00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,250\nPeople put a surprising amount of data\nthat probably should be on there in\n\n500\n00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:12,570\nthe first place on those devices,\nand they're very easy to lose or for\n\n501\n00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,810\nsomebody to steal.\n\n502\n00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,455\nLeave it on that table, you turn around at\nthe restaurant to talk to somebody else\n\n503\n00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:20,015\nand you like back and it's gone.\n\n504\n00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:22,905\n>> Yeah, mm-hm.\n\n505\n00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:27,345\n>> That is a very, very big problem,\nis that they are designed to be mobile,\n\n506\n00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,605\ndesigned to be small.\n\n507\n00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,885\nSo, of course,\nthey would be easy to steal,\n\n508\n00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:35,540\nthat someone's gonna be able to\npocket it and just take off.\n\n509\n00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,230\nAnd if you get it,\nif you happen to have a new device,\n\n510\n00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,400\nthey can be even more aggressive\nabout it that they will,\n\n511\n00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,830\nthat they will attack you and\neverything else to get that device.\n\n512\n00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,590\n>> And I had it happen more than once\nat a, I was at a little restaurant down\n\n513\n00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,740\nhere and somebody come up to me\nlike \"I see you have an iPhone\".\n\n514\n00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,680\nDo you have the find my phone thing and\nI'm like yeah I do.\n\n515\n00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,820\nAnd I'm like well my mom lost her\nphone can you help me punch in.\n\n516\n00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,160\nSo I had to let them log into the system\nthere to try to track their phone down.\n\n517\n00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,260\nBut just lost the dang phone.\n\n518\n00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,440\nEasy to leave them laying around.\n\n519\n00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,680\n>> Yeah easy to lose them, leave them\nlaying around, probably a lot of you,\n\n520\n00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,170\nI do a lot of traveling,\nair travel and otherwise.\n\n521\n00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:19,720\nWhen I do air travel to any place,\nprobably like say say a lot of you,\n\n522\n00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,390\nhow many times have you been\nsitting at your gate or something.\n\n523\n00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,825\n>> Mhmm\n>> And maybe it was you who did this.\n\n524\n00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:25,890\n>> [COUGH]\n>> You get to the gate and\n\n525\n00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,710\nyou're like oh where did I put my phone.\n\n526\n00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:32,360\nOr you hear the TSA or security calling\nout over the PA, if you've left your\n\n527\n00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,370\nphone at the checkpoint you\nneed to come back and get it.\n\n528\n00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,920\nIt's a common thing.\n\n529\n00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,960\nYou see people leave\nthem in restaurants or\n\n530\n00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,760\nlike I said back of cars,\njust all over the place.\n\n531\n00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,050\nThe thing that you have to\nkeep in mind with a theft or\n\n532\n00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:51,780\neven just the out and out losing of it.\n\n533\n00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,230\nIs, what's on that device?\n\n534\n00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,030\nAll of you know somebody,\nwe know somebody,\n\n535\n00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,940\nall of us know those people in our lives.\n\n536\n00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,860\nAnd again, could be you that their\nwhole life is on that device.\n\n537\n00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,210\nIf they lose that thing, they couldn't\neven call their significant, excuse me,\n\n538\n00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,650\ntheir significant other anymore.\n\n539\n00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,950\nIt's like, how many of you actually know,\nif you thought about it,\n\n540\n00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,175\nhow many of you out there.\n\n541\n00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or discussion group could actually\n\n542\n00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:28,330\ncall your significant other, or call your\nkids, or call your friend or something.\n\n543\n00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:33,660\nHow many of those could you call if I went\nover and said I'm taking your phone and\n\n544\n00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,035\nnow tell me what the number is first,\nor such and such.\n\n545\n00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:38,585\nYou might be.\n>> You gonna call information?\n\n546\n00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:39,535\n>> Yeah.\n\n547\n00:29:39,535 --> 00:29:40,465\n>> Do I get a life line?\n\n548\n00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:41,395\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n549\n00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:42,945\nI'm sorry,\ncan someone help me out with that?\n\n550\n00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:43,745\nCan I just peak?\n\n551\n00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:44,875\nCan you give me a clue?\n\n552\n00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:47,195\nSomething like that, it's very tough.\n\n553\n00:29:47,195 --> 00:29:51,360\nYou don't have to memorize\nnumbers the way you used to.\n\n554\n00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,050\nIt used to be when you were\nusing the old doot, doot,\n\n555\n00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,720\ndoot touch phones in our homes.\n\n556\n00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,990\nWe had to either memorize that or\nwe had a small, written down.\n\n557\n00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,150\n>> You had your little black book, yeah.\n\n558\n00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,110\n>> Yeah, something like that.\n\n559\n00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,100\nBut now we don't have that.\n\n560\n00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,340\nSo we have all those\ncontact lists on our phone,\n\n561\n00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,020\nthey're all Synced across everything.\n\n562\n00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,330\nOur e-mails, and\neverything else, addresses,\n\n563\n00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,040\neverything are synced across all that.\n\n564\n00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:20,450\nAnd then you start going to company\ndirectories that might be stored on there.\n\n565\n00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,980\nIntellectual property for a company.\n\n566\n00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,130\nThere's been people that amazingly\nenough have stored credit card data,\n\n567\n00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,630\nI'm not talking just theirs.\n\n568\n00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,290\nI'm talking company credit card data for\na whole company.\n\n569\n00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:36,150\nThe first case I heard of\nthat was something that\n\n570\n00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,180\nhappened up in Seattle several years ago.\n\n571\n00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:46,480\nSomeone sold a cell phone through eBay,\nforgot to blank it and anything.\n\n572\n00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,150\nIt was actually a Blackberry too and\nthey forgot to wipe it.\n\n573\n00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:55,116\nAnd when that device got bought\nby someone else they found a 100,\n\n574\n00:30:55,116 --> 00:30:59,200\n200, something like that customer\nrecords including credit cards,\n\n575\n00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,070\nsocial security numbers and\neverything on it.\n\n576\n00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,820\nSomeone had that.\n\n577\n00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,950\nIt was the salesperson's phone for\nthat company.\n\n578\n00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,700\n>> Right.\n>> Luckily,\n\n579\n00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,940\nthe person that got it\nwas a Good Samaritan and\n\n580\n00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,900\nsaid that hey, this happened.\n\n581\n00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,460\nAnd yeah it got reported on the news but\n\n582\n00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,060\nthey also didn't tell\nwhose cell phone it was.\n\n583\n00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,680\n>> Release all the numbers.\n\n584\n00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,770\n>> Yeah, and\nthey made sure the person that did it,\n\n585\n00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,080\nthey contacted that person by\nusing their own phone no less.\n\n586\n00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,020\nThey contacted that person and said yeah,\nby the way, there's some stuff in here.\n\n587\n00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:34,010\nYou left a piece of media in here that\nhas all that private information on it.\n\n588\n00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,720\nSo you do get that.\n\n589\n00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,000\nAnd so these things are, you gotta think,\nthey get stolen, it gets lost.\n\n590\n00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,600\nWhat's going with that?\n\n591\n00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,470\nWhat do you have there that\nmay not exist someplace else?\n\n592\n00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,060\nA lot of times that happens.\n\n593\n00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,928\nI mean, think about how many people you\nknow that you talk to them about their\n\n594\n00:31:50,928 --> 00:31:54,140\ncell phones and they are,\ntheir cell phone is lost or damaged.\n\n595\n00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,276\nThey are, I got pictures on that,\nlike pictures from,\n\n596\n00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:01,980\nI have pictures from my\nvacation three years ago.\n\n597\n00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,520\nThree years.\n\n598\n00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,000\nWhy are they still on your phone?\n\n599\n00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,015\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like,\n\n600\n00:32:06,015 --> 00:32:09,018\nwhy don't you put that someplace?\n\n601\n00:32:09,018 --> 00:32:15,130\nI've got a friend that went to my\ngraduation for one of my military schools,\n\n602\n00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:20,190\nand he took pictures on graduation day,\nand he still has those.\n\n603\n00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,320\nThat was three years ago, four years ago.\n\n604\n00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,370\nHe's like, oh, yeah, I saved them so\nI could send them to you.\n\n605\n00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,290\nI was like, you got my number,\nyou could text them or email them to me,\n\n606\n00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,550\nyou didn't have to wait until you saw me,\nperson to person,\n\n607\n00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:36,640\nand by the way, do you keep all that\nstuff on your phone all the time?\n\n608\n00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,510\n>> Absolutely.\nAbsolutely.\n\n609\n00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,200\n>> You have like no space on your phone\nbecause I'm keeping these pictures for\n\n610\n00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,970\nShawn, all right.\n\n611\n00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,050\n>> All right ladies and gentlemen, well\nlooking at the clock it's about time for\n\n612\n00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,970\nus to take a break.\n\n613\n00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,480\nSo we're gonna step away,\nwhen we come back, more mobile forensics.\n\n614\n00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,104\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n615\n00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:58,244\n[MUSIC]\n\n616\n00:32:58,244 --> 00:32:59,980\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n617\n00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,830\nSo continuing on with\nour mobile forensics.\n\n618\n00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,790\nWe left off talking about some of\nthe different types of crimes that can be\n\n619\n00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,910\ncommitted or\ncan occur on these mobiles devices.\n\n620\n00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:14,210\nWe talked about harassment,\ntheft, spam would be another one.\n\n621\n00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,910\nIt's a-\n>> What more can you say about\n\n622\n00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,050\nthat really?\n\n623\n00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:17,760\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n624\n00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,530\n>> Well, you could add some stuff onto it.\n\n625\n00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:24,960\nSpam, yeah we know about the spam in the\nsense of what we were talking about with\n\n626\n00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,310\ntheir email section and the spam that all\nof us have come to know and love, right?\n\n627\n00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:38,750\nBut there's also the new stuff that is the\nform of spam being sent via text messages.\n\n628\n00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,400\nAnd there is also, if you recall, in CEH,\n\n629\n00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,800\nwe talked about something\ncalled bluejacking.\n\n630\n00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:53,950\n>> Where people will send you\nunsolicited messages through Bluetooth.\n\n631\n00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:59,700\nThat would also count as a form\nof spam that is done just through\n\n632\n00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,390\nthe Bluetooth protocol.\n\n633\n00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,290\nIt's exclusive to that.\n\n634\n00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:10,230\nSo they found new ways to tick you off and\ndo stuff with your mobile device now.\n\n635\n00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,850\nAnd then of course you get the people\nthat sign up, you've been to\n\n636\n00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:20,580\ndifferent parks and restaurants and\nstuff like that, and wherever.\n\n637\n00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,180\nSporting events that say if\nyou want more information,\n\n638\n00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,690\ntext something to this number and\nyou text it.\n\n639\n00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,590\nAnd they say charges ought apply or\nwhatever.\n\n640\n00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,820\nAnd you text that number\nto a certain place and\n\n641\n00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,060\nit all of a sudden starts\nsending you things.\n\n642\n00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,340\nIt signs you up for a list and\nnow you're getting spammed there too.\n\n643\n00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,110\n>> Here.\nHere's my number, spam me please.\n\n644\n00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,810\n>> That's what you're doing,\nyou're saying yeah, here.\n\n645\n00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,750\nI'll throw that away for you.\n\n646\n00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,120\n>> You had cloning, is another big\nthing that we've got to worry about\n\n647\n00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,200\nwith these mobile devices as well.\n\n648\n00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,720\nRight?\nPeople just making duplicates\n\n649\n00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,700\nof my phone real quick.\n\n650\n00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,135\n>> Yeah.\nThat's something that is\n\n651\n00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:59,045\namazingly easy to do and\nif you look around,\n\n652\n00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:04,715\nI'm not gonna help you on that\none because they're easy to get.\n\n653\n00:35:04,715 --> 00:35:09,440\nI'll let you if you really wanna do your\nresearch on it, you can find the stuff.\n\n654\n00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,450\nBut it's, cuz it's really not\na valid reason outside of\n\n655\n00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:18,360\nperhaps law enforcement specifically,\nthat you would ever need to do that.\n\n656\n00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,010\nBut what cloning is,\nis just what you're saying.\n\n657\n00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,790\nIt's making a duplicate of a phone and\nit's relatively simple.\n\n658\n00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:31,150\nYou can get a reader, take someone's\nSIM chip and just pop it in,\n\n659\n00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,440\nit duplicates it, and then you just\npop it into an unlocked phone and\n\n660\n00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,980\nall of a sudden just boom, you've\ngot a exact duplicate of that phone.\n\n661\n00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,360\nSo you're going to get all the calls and\n\n662\n00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,130\nbe able to send this information and make\ncalls under the other person's account.\n\n663\n00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,220\nIt's actually something that is used and\n\n664\n00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,510\nthis is why I'm careful not\nto show any equipment or\n\n665\n00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:57,620\nanything with this, is that it's one of\nthose things that's used by people that\n\n666\n00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,390\nare committing crimes because they can\neasily pin it back on someone else.\n\n667\n00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,840\nThey will use a phone\nthat's basically a burner.\n\n668\n00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,670\nThat's what they call it.\n\n669\n00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,240\nIt's a disposable phone.\n\n670\n00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,560\nThey'll buy one really cheap, pop a SIM\ncard into it that's been cloned and\n\n671\n00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,650\nall of a sudden they've cloned your\ndevice, they're making calls, drug deals.\n\n672\n00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:22,160\nWhatever on it, and then when they're\ndone, they just chuck it some place.\n\n673\n00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,860\nLaw enforcement eventually finds the\nphone, usually eventually finds the phone.\n\n674\n00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,620\nBut if they look hard enough,\n\n675\n00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,030\nyour forensic tech involved in this\nusually can find that it was cloned.\n\n676\n00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,390\nBecause unless the person's\nreally close to you, they'll see.\n\n677\n00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,510\nHey, you've got a connection\nto this tower over here, and\n\n678\n00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,390\nthen there's a connection\nto this tower over here.\n\n679\n00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,270\nAnd those are too far from\none another to actually\n\n680\n00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,930\nto indicate that you were in\nthose two places at once.\n\n681\n00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,200\n>> Same phone appearing to be connected\nto two different towers on two different\n\n682\n00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,970\nsides of town could indicate that\nthere's a clone out there of that phone.\n\n683\n00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:02,160\n>> Yeah or the same phone making\ntwo connections to the same tower.\n\n684\n00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,860\nThat shouldn't happen either.\n\n685\n00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,020\nSo that would also be an indicator.\n\n686\n00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,400\nBut just on the surface,\nas far as billing goes and\n\n687\n00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,900\nsurface investigations, it looks like\neverything came from the same device.\n\n688\n00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,860\nSo you'd have to, if you encounter\nsituations like this as a forensic\n\n689\n00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:23,760\ninvestigator, now you'd have\nto do more examinations.\n\n690\n00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,640\nSay okay, yes whether you talked to the\ncellphone company and you get information\n\n691\n00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,220\nexchanged back and forth and you find out,\nyeah there's multiple connections in\n\n692\n00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,990\nhere and things don't match entirely\nonce we do that dig deeper.\n\n693\n00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,690\nWe've got multiple connections,\nwe've got multiple towers that\n\n694\n00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,640\nare too far apart from one\nanother to be the same phone.\n\n695\n00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,435\nAnd we just got a lot of stuff in\nplay there that doesn't match up, so\n\n696\n00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,630\nwe've got a cloned device.\n\n697\n00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:54,400\n>> And then of course distribution\nof things like malware, pornography.\n\n698\n00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,520\nThis can be carried out with a mobile\nphone just like it could with a laptop.\n\n699\n00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,460\nA lot of that you know happens.\n\n700\n00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:12,100\nThe malware part, malware has found a very\ngood way to spread through mobile devices.\n\n701\n00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,200\nThey're actually stuffed in the apps,\n\n702\n00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,210\nin a good number of apps that get\nin your phone and could infect it.\n\n703\n00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,600\nThere's also ones that\nspread via Bluetooth and\n\n704\n00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,460\nthen you look at some of\nthe operating systems.\n\n705\n00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,810\nWhat about something like Windows mobile?\n\n706\n00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,420\nThere are things that\nyou could do technically\n\n707\n00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,330\nthat could bring stuff over from\nthe Windows platform into Windows mobile.\n\n708\n00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:39,930\nIt's not as easy, but there's still\nways open that you could do it.\n\n709\n00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,045\nAnd so that opens up a whole bunch\nof interesting possibilities.\n\n710\n00:38:43,045 --> 00:38:45,560\nAnd because, like I said they're mobile,\nand you might be connecting to\n\n711\n00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,490\ndifferent networks and\nthings like that, you can very easily.\n\n712\n00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:53,730\nLike someone like myself, if I was then\ntraveling from the west coast to the east\n\n713\n00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:57,720\ncoast to do something like this, I'm going\nthrough airports and stuff like that.\n\n714\n00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,280\nI could very easily be spreading\nsomething if my phone was affected.\n\n715\n00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,890\nYou just attached to a wi-fi network\nthere, or what have you, and\n\n716\n00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,900\nall of a sudden it's\nspreading to a new area.\n\n717\n00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,780\n>> And then you got information leagues\nof course which goes back to the whole\n\n718\n00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,550\nmobile devices.\n\n719\n00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:16,060\nThey're very small,\neasy to lose, easy to steal, and\n\n720\n00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,470\npeople are putting more and\nmore and more personal information,\n\n721\n00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,900\nwork related information,\nfinancial information on these devices.\n\n722\n00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,820\n>> Yeah, it's been shown that mobile\ndevices have become a very, very,\n\n723\n00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:33,090\nvery good way of getting\ninformation out of an organization.\n\n724\n00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:38,385\nSo having people plug them\nin to supposedly charge them\n\n725\n00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:43,567\nat their workplace or\nassociate them via Bluetooth,\n\n726\n00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:47,825\nif that capability is\npresent on both ends,\n\n727\n00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:51,990\nthose all have most definitely occurred.\n\n728\n00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:56,335\nIt's also why some businesses will tell\nyou specifically that those things don't\n\n729\n00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:59,390\ncome in, they've got to be\nStored in a locker some place.\n\n730\n00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,700\nOr just it's left in your car, whatever.\n\n731\n00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,020\nThey can't come in past a certain point.\n\n732\n00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,560\nSome of you may have worked in\nenvironments like that too.\n\n733\n00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,070\nI've been in plenty of environments.\n\n734\n00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:16,210\nBoth as, for me,\nboth as a member of the military and\n\n735\n00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,640\nas someone who is doing\ncontracting with them.\n\n736\n00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,810\nThere's conferences and\nbriefings, and stuff like that.\n\n737\n00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,670\nJust flat-out areas of the building\nwhere they have a sign up there,\n\n738\n00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,030\nNo Cell Phones in Here.\n\n739\n00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:33,770\nSo you either gotta leave it at a desk or\nyou have to put it in a locker, or\n\n740\n00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,260\nyou carry it back out to your car.\n\n741\n00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,130\nBut, they better not find it on\nthe other side of that door or\n\n742\n00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,850\nthere's gonna be a beat down in progress.\n\n743\n00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,730\nSomeone without a phone.\n\n744\n00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,780\nSo, they don't kid around\nwith that sort of thing.\n\n745\n00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,010\nCuz look at all the capabilities on it.\n\n746\n00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,610\nNot only is it something that has a lot\nof storage that you can carry stuff with.\n\n747\n00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:55,260\nYou also have, even more concerning,\nis that phone.\n\n748\n00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,050\nOr is that camera on the phone.\n\n749\n00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,590\nYou can take a lot of pictures with it,\n\n750\n00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,020\ncameras, as we know,\naren't these grainy little things anymore.\n\n751\n00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,618\nThey're just those grainy\nlittle pictures any more.\n\n752\n00:41:05,618 --> 00:41:07,790\nThey're pulling high-quality photos.\n\n753\n00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,100\n>> 10 megapixels and up, now, and so\nI can take a picture with my phone and\n\n754\n00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:17,010\nI can zoom in and\nread stuff off a monitor, or a label, or\n\n755\n00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,650\nanything I'm taking a picture of,\nso very, very easy to do.\n\n756\n00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,272\n>> Yeah, so businesses don't want those.\n\n757\n00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:26,900\nThey also avoid this for a long time,\nthe portal media players too.\n\n758\n00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,780\nBecause those really when we\nlook at a portable media player,\n\n759\n00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,890\nit's nothing more than\na fancy portable hard drive.\n\n760\n00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:35,530\n>> Yeah\n>> That's it.\n\n761\n00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:39,290\n>> A flash-drive with an app that can read\nthe files on it and play those MP4's or\n\n762\n00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,370\nwhatever they are.\n\n763\n00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:47,960\n>> Yeah exactly, and so\na lot of businesses have started to say\n\n764\n00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,880\nwe don't want those things in our\nbusiness, so don't bring them in.\n\n765\n00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,360\nBecause they've had too many\nproblems with it with people either,\n\n766\n00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:01,330\nit started with people uploading and\ndownloading music to the company and\n\n767\n00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:04,160\nmovies to the company's network when\nthey needed to clean out space.\n\n768\n00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,650\nIt was like, oh here's a place to put it.\n\n769\n00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:08,330\nBut then there was\ninformation leakage thing and\n\n770\n00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,990\nthey started finding that\nout pretty early on too.\n\n771\n00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,700\nThere were actually cases,\nit was funny enough,\n\n772\n00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:19,020\nthey had cases where people would walk\nin with iPods when they first came out,\n\n773\n00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,980\nand they'd go into someplace like\na Best Buy or what have you.\n\n774\n00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,760\nAnd they go to the computer section and\n\n775\n00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,150\nwhen they are walking around there and\nsomeone helped them,\n\n776\n00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,320\nthey would say something to the effect of\nthat yeah I'm looking to buy a computer.\n\n777\n00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,180\nAnd when the person asked what\ntype of stuff are you into,\n\n778\n00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,099\nwhat type of computer and the person would\nsay well I'm really big into my music.\n\n779\n00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,350\nHere I got my iPod.\n\n780\n00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,390\nI carry that everywhere.\n\n781\n00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:46,190\nIt's just I'm just a big audiophile,\nand make something like that or\n\n782\n00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,090\ntalk about stuff like that.\n\n783\n00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,030\nMaybe say they're a musician and all that.\n\n784\n00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,200\nAnd just to kinda really\nbolster the story.\n\n785\n00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,620\nBut then they say along the way\nit says for any computer for\n\n786\n00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,190\nme it has to be able to plug in and\nsynchronize with my iPod because I'm\n\n787\n00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:03,890\nconstantly downloading music and ripping\nCDs, it's gotta be stored on there so\n\n788\n00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,630\nthat's important to me, and so they say\nsure, no problem, oh, you got your iPad\n\n789\n00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:12,380\nwith you, why don't you go ahead and\nplug it in, or the person would ask that.\n\n790\n00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,230\nHey, I wanna go ahead and\nplug this in and try it, see if it works.\n\n791\n00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,800\nIs that cool?\nAnd usually the salesperson would say,\n\n792\n00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,700\nearly on at least would say yeah, sure.\n\n793\n00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,600\nAnd then the person would plug it in,\nstart playing with the computer and\n\n794\n00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,680\ndoing that whole thing and\nthe sales person.\n\n795\n00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,380\nThey tell the salesperson,\noh I'm going to try a few things here.\n\n796\n00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,560\nI'll call you if I need any help.\n\n797\n00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,410\nI'll call you if I need anything.\n\n798\n00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,210\nAnd sales person walks away,\n\n799\n00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,650\nthat person takes all the free\nsoftware like Office and\n\n800\n00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:39,150\nsomething like off the computer, sticks\nit on their hard drive and walks out.\n\n801\n00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,520\n>> Absolutely.\n>> And it happened a lot.\n\n802\n00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,850\nAnd that process is pretty much the way\nit occurred over and over again.\n\n803\n00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:52,570\nAnd so we see places that are saying,\nno you can't plug your stuff in here.\n\n804\n00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,689\nIt's just not gonna happen.\n\n805\n00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,780\nSo we've got all these different crimes\nthat occur on all these different types of\n\n806\n00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,510\ndevices, with all these\ndifferent operating systems,\n\n807\n00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,230\nall the different connectivity\nmethods we've got to deal with, so\n\n808\n00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:09,150\nwhere do we start when it comes to\nmobile forensics, what do we do?\n\n809\n00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:14,748\n>> Yeah, to start this off, we gotta say,\n\n810\n00:44:14,748 --> 00:44:18,814\nthis is an area that is very unique and\n\n811\n00:44:18,814 --> 00:44:22,830\nit'is also very much evolving.\n\n812\n00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:27,130\nIf you were to watch the stuff here and\n\n813\n00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:32,620\nthen go online and pick up books and\nall that on mobile forensics.\n\n814\n00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,820\nAnd there's plenty of papers and research\nand books and everything out there.\n\n815\n00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,720\nThere are some definite variations,\n\n816\n00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,420\nmuch more than any other area\nof the forensic process.\n\n817\n00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,360\nBecause of things that we've talked about,\n\n818\n00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,310\ndifferent OSs, different devices,\ndifferent types of crimes.\n\n819\n00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:54,680\nEnvironments they go in, different\nconditions that you find the device in.\n\n820\n00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:01,720\nAll those things have definitely affected\nthis forensic investigation process.\n\n821\n00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,250\nSo you may very well be one of\nthe areas that you kinda have to\n\n822\n00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,980\nmake some of the procedures up or\ndo some strange things once\n\n823\n00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,250\nyou do get a hold of the device,\nduring the investigation.\n\n824\n00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,470\nSome stuff that you're gonna\nhear I can know of at least one,\n\n825\n00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:20,230\nthat seems really just odd and\n\n826\n00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:24,590\nit flies completely counter to what you\nmight wanna do on natural instinct.\n\n827\n00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,900\nWe'll talk about that one, but\nthere's a whole bunch of other\n\n828\n00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,780\nthings that could hide out there that\nwould just be why would I do that?\n\n829\n00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,600\nOr I wouldn't do that in any other place.\n\n830\n00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,210\nIt's a mobile device.\n\n831\n00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,020\nIt's a different environment.\n\n832\n00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,960\nWe're not talking a network,\nwe're not talking a desktop,\n\n833\n00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,110\na server which there's\nsome commonality there.\n\n834\n00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,530\nThere's some common stuff here but there's\nalso a lot of stuff that's different,\n\n835\n00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,030\na lot of ways to investigate.\n\n836\n00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:52,335\nSo you're gonna have to be very flexible,\nif you're gonna.\n\n837\n00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:54,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you're gonna do something like this.\n\n838\n00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,900\nVery flexible, and\nbe creative with some of your things.\n\n839\n00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,580\nBut remember, not only does it have\nthat property of being flexible and\n\n840\n00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:05,260\nin the new area, you also need to take\ninto account that anything you do make\n\n841\n00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,390\nsure you're using your common sense and\nnot doing anything to alter the evidence.\n\n842\n00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:14,350\nIf you can do that, that will go a long\nway towards helping you out when\n\n843\n00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:18,950\nyou have to present this evidence that\nyou've extracted off this device.\n\n844\n00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:22,930\nSo just do something that is logical,\nmakes sense,\n\n845\n00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:25,640\nthat you've well thought it through, and\n\n846\n00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:30,760\nyou haven't tampered with that all\nimportant evidence if you can avoid it.\n\n847\n00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,430\nYou may not be able to\navoid it in every case, but\n\n848\n00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,480\nyou try to avoid it as much as possible.\n\n849\n00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,830\n>> So most of these devices are gonna\nhave some type of SIM card in them, so\n\n850\n00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,060\nthat's probably one of\nthe places we're gonna start\n\n851\n00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,030\n>> Start is trying to retrieve that data\n\n852\n00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,400\nthat's being stored on there.\n\n853\n00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,340\n>> Yeah, I don't know if I'd say\nnecessarily be a place that you'd start,\n\n854\n00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,410\nbut it's one of the things you will\ninvestigate, undoubtedly, is that that SIM\n\n855\n00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:56,920\nchip is in that device, and we know\nwhat's the subscriber information module.\n\n856\n00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,750\nI think is what that stands for.\n\n857\n00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:05,230\nIt's gonna be in the cell phone and\nit's something that the vendor or\n\n858\n00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,970\nthe service provider puts in there to\nallow you to attach to their network.\n\n859\n00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:12,930\nBut you can also store other\nthings on that SIM card.\n\n860\n00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,410\nYou can store contact lists and\nsome files.\n\n861\n00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:19,750\nYou can store on some of them so\nthere could be some stuff there that is.\n\n862\n00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:23,340\n>> Very, very, very valuable to you so\n\n863\n00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:28,260\nyou have to have a way\nto read those sim cards.\n\n864\n00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:33,460\nFortunately, you can get sim\ncard readers easily enough.\n\n865\n00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,500\nAnd those things aren't\nthat expensive to get.\n\n866\n00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,681\nAnd so you just get one of\nthese SIM card readers,\n\n867\n00:47:39,681 --> 00:47:43,251\nyou can plug them in via USB\nto your forensics laptop and\n\n868\n00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:48,000\nstart extracting data off of it, and\nreading it, which is really cool.\n\n869\n00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,260\nYou can go as far as cloning that device.\n\n870\n00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,683\nWho knows You may have a device that\nis dead except for the SIM chip and\n\n871\n00:47:54,683 --> 00:48:00,460\nyou don't want to tamper with the SIM chip\nbecause that is potentially evidence.\n\n872\n00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:05,710\nWhat you wanna do is, you wanna duplicate\nthat SIM and stick it in another device or\n\n873\n00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,797\nextract data from it,\na copy someplace else.\n\n874\n00:48:09,797 --> 00:48:12,580\n>> Mm-hm\n>> And like I said, the stuff you have for\n\n875\n00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,890\ndoing SIM card data extraction,\n\n876\n00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,740\njust about every software pool\nsupports something like it.\n\n877\n00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:25,150\nYou plug in via USB and you just pop out\nyour SIM card, pop it into this adaptor,\n\n878\n00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:29,910\nand the adaptors will accept\ndifferent types of sim cards.\n\n879\n00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:35,350\nYou plug it in and it will start reading\nit and backing it up or what have you.\n\n880\n00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:40,050\n>> So we get some information\noff the SIM card and then our.\n\n881\n00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,000\nThese mobile devices,\n\n882\n00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,910\nthey definitely throw a few different\nchallenges that we have to face outside of\n\n883\n00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:50,580\nthe normal challenges that we have to deal\nwith already as a forensic investigator.\n\n884\n00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:55,665\n>> Yeah, nothing's ever easy,\nas we've said numerous times before.\n\n885\n00:48:55,665 --> 00:48:58,390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nothing's ever, easy.\n\n886\n00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:03,850\nThis is where it can get really nuts and\n\n887\n00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:10,310\nout of hand when your\ntalking about forensics.\n\n888\n00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:15,510\nOne of the big things we have that\nmakes it tough is these things are very\n\n889\n00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,650\neasily disposable.\n\n890\n00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:22,300\nYou can ditch a cell phone quite easily\nwithout too much effort, you can\n\n891\n00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:27,470\ndump it some place and that's the end\nof it and that is a very common tactic.\n\n892\n00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:31,100\nIf someone is committing a serious crime\n\n893\n00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:37,600\nand they want to call the police or\n\n894\n00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,350\ncall someone else as the victim and\nmake threats or whatever.\n\n895\n00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,860\nIt's very easy for\nthem to get rid of that device,\n\n896\n00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,890\nand most of them are even\ngonna step up their game, and\n\n897\n00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:54,620\nthe good ones will step up their game and\nmake what's called a burner device,\n\n898\n00:49:54,620 --> 00:50:00,510\nwhich is, they use that term already,\nit's a device that's specifically made to,\n\n899\n00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:03,520\nafter you're done using it,\nto get rid of it.\n\n900\n00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,290\nAnd if they're gonna do that,\nthey're usually getting a locked device.\n\n901\n00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:11,440\nIf you're gonna do it the right way,\ntypically you'll buy that\n\n902\n00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,870\nlocked device off of a website\nthat sells used devices.\n\n903\n00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,250\nYou might pick up one, for\n\n904\n00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:21,300\nexample, find someone on Craigslist\nthat doesn't want their stuff anymore.\n\n905\n00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:29,000\nSo you can just buy through cash and\nthen have a phone that has no paper trail.\n\n906\n00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,392\nYou buy it through eBay,\nthere's a transaction log in there.\n\n907\n00:50:32,392 --> 00:50:36,611\nSo what you can do is go to\nsomething like Craigslist,\n\n908\n00:50:36,611 --> 00:50:40,620\nlook through the want ads or whatever\nthe classified ads of the newspaper or\n\n909\n00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,660\nsomething and\nfind someone that's selling it.\n\n910\n00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,250\nYou will find them there.\n\n911\n00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:48,090\nCall the person up, you do a cash\nexchange, you've got a burner phone and\n\n912\n00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:51,640\nthen it's just a matter of\nbuying a SIM chip someplace.\n\n913\n00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,040\nAnd you buy that with cash and\nthen you just pop that into the phone.\n\n914\n00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,440\nYou've got an effective burner there.\n\n915\n00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,940\nSo you just go ahead and use that.\n\n916\n00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,630\nAnd it can make you almost untraceable.\n\n917\n00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,470\nAnd if you want to go further,\n\n918\n00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:11,060\nthere's actually someone\nthat recommended doing this.\n\n919\n00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,890\nAnd it worksvery well.\n\n920\n00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:19,220\nThey said get two burner phones and you're\ngonna use those in the same process.\n\n921\n00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,920\nWhat you do is, you buy a burner phone\nusing the process I just talked about and\n\n922\n00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,030\nthen what you do is once\nyou've set up that account,\n\n923\n00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:33,180\nthat prepaid account,\nyou punch in a forwarding number.\n\n924\n00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:36,770\nAnd then what you have is you\nhave stuff go to that phone and\n\n925\n00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:39,710\nthen get forwarded to\nanother phone from there.\n\n926\n00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:45,110\nAnd so after you're done with doing\nthat you take the first phone,\n\n927\n00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,185\nafter you set up the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n928\n00:51:46,185 --> 00:51:48,895\nGet on the account, you take it and\nyou throw it in the trash someplace.\n\n929\n00:51:48,895 --> 00:51:49,695\n>> Hm, all right.\n\n930\n00:51:49,695 --> 00:51:50,700\n>> You don't need it anymore.\n\n931\n00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,445\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't need it.\n\n932\n00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:52,975\nYou're not talking on the thing.\n\n933\n00:51:52,975 --> 00:51:54,615\nTake it, throw it away.\n\n934\n00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:56,455\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If someone gets it out of the trash,\n\n935\n00:51:56,455 --> 00:51:58,475\ngood, let them make the calls and\nall that.\n\n936\n00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,920\nWhen I'm making my threats or harassing\nstuff with my other phone that calls\n\n937\n00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,030\nare getting forwarded to, they're\ngonna see calls coming from that one,\n\n938\n00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:10,780\nand they're gonna get that person who\npicked it up out of the trash or wherever.\n\n939\n00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,209\nThey're getting blamed for that now.\n\n940\n00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:13,110\n>> All right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n941\n00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,460\n>> So it's only gonna be after they check\n\n942\n00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,950\nthe account stuff like that,\nit's being forwarded to another number.\n\n943\n00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:23,850\nMeanwhile, I'm on that other phone, I've\ndone my threats, I'm out of the picture,\n\n944\n00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,200\nthrown it away.\n\n945\n00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,300\nAll in a day's work.\n\n946\n00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,960\n>> Sounds like I've done this before.\n\n947\n00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,560\n>> I know, right?\n\n948\n00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,370\nSomeone's been playing\naround with this stuff.\n\n949\n00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,815\n>> Someone's gotta stop these women.\n\n950\n00:52:33,815 --> 00:52:37,560\nNo, I'm kidding [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n951\n00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,970\none of the challenges we run into\nwith these is we talked earlier,\n\n952\n00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:43,870\nall the different platforms, all\nthe different models and things like that.\n\n953\n00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:47,600\nSo, there isn't a one-stop-shop when\nit comes to a forensic solution for\n\n954\n00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,840\nworking with these phones, is there?\n\n955\n00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,450\n>> No.\nThere isnt any sort of one-stop solution\n\n956\n00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:55,443\nwith these things is that there's no\n\n957\n00:52:55,443 --> 00:53:00,970\none-size-fits-all type solution for\ninvestigating cell phones.\n\n958\n00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:05,700\nYou just can't go out there and\nsay, well, we are,\n\n959\n00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:10,050\nI'm gonna get some equipment and I'm\ngonna do investigations, and that's good.\n\n960\n00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:12,320\nA lot of the situations\nwe've talked about, yes,\n\n961\n00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,810\nyou'll get some varying pieces\nof equipment to check things and\n\n962\n00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:22,040\nto double-check your investigations,\nand to get different levels of data,\n\n963\n00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:27,530\nmaybe you're investigating Microsoft\ncomputers and Linux computers and Apple\n\n964\n00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:31,990\ncomputers, there could be some variations\nof equipment and software there.\n\n965\n00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:37,550\nBut for what we have going on here for\ninvestigating these different devices,\n\n966\n00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:42,610\nthat's going to be a big,\nbig issue for you.\n\n967\n00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:46,280\nThere's no standardized equipment for\nthis.\n\n968\n00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,790\nWell, there's some standardization, but\nthen that plays into the whole deal\n\n969\n00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:55,390\nof well, I've got this device by this\nvendor, this device by this vendor,\n\n970\n00:53:55,390 --> 00:54:00,440\nit's the same device but it is different\nbecause of what the vendors themselves do.\n\n971\n00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,870\nYou could have all those\ntypes of things pop up.\n\n972\n00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,900\nSo no standardization.\n\n973\n00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:10,550\nAnd as you know they say,\nthe phones can be different, there's so\n\n974\n00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:16,480\nmany different phones, they introduce\nthem so fast and furious it seems like.\n\n975\n00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,970\nThen you have the vendors altering them\ntoo it just makes it really crazy.\n\n976\n00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,180\n>> Absolutely.\n\n977\n00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,110\nSo as we start going through\nour forensics thing,\n\n978\n00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:29,730\nwhat kind of information might I be\nlooking to gain off these device?\n\n979\n00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:34,960\n>> It can really be\na good number of things.\n\n980\n00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,670\nAlmost anything you can get\noff of a regular computer,\n\n981\n00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:42,540\nyou can get off of a mobile device.\n\n982\n00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,790\nThat's not where it ends.\n\n983\n00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:46,380\nThere's an additional level\nof stuff that you can get\n\n984\n00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:51,330\nthat is stuff that's on the SIM card,\nthat's not on a computer.\n\n985\n00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,530\nThey're either stuff that you\ncan get like call lists and\n\n986\n00:54:55,530 --> 00:55:00,419\ndistribution lists, there's text\nmessages that will come off of there.\n\n987\n00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,210\nThat's just a few of those things and\nthen you get the messaging\n\n988\n00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:13,040\nsoftware that outside of those\nthat people have on their devices.\n\n989\n00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,475\nSo there's plenty of\ndifferent things you can get.\n\n990\n00:55:16,475 --> 00:55:22,975\nAnd you can even throw on top of that\nthese third party proprietary apps.\n\n991\n00:55:22,975 --> 00:55:27,730\nRemember how the big thing was what two,\nthree, four years ago or whatever.\n\n992\n00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:31,255\nWhen that first iPhone came out the buzzer\nwas hey, there's an app for that.\n\n993\n00:55:31,255 --> 00:55:32,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's still very much true.\n\n994\n00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,090\nThere's an app for something.\n\n995\n00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:35,680\nYou say something about a mobile device.\n\n996\n00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,100\nSomeone's say,\noh I've got an app for that.\n\n997\n00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,940\nWell, hey no kidding.\n\n998\n00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,993\nIf someone hasn't developed it,\nthey will in short order.\n\n999\n00:55:41,993 --> 00:55:49,520\nSo that can also be other data that\nyou're going to extract off of this.\n\n1000\n00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,398\n>> And I'm thinking to myself\nbecause I've got an iPhone and\n\n1001\n00:55:52,398 --> 00:55:55,216\nI know I've gone through some\nof my security settings and\n\n1002\n00:55:55,216 --> 00:55:59,051\nEvery time you install a new app it says,\njust wanna send you notifications.\n\n1003\n00:55:59,051 --> 00:56:02,780\nAnd then it will start going into,\ncan it have access to your contacts?\n\n1004\n00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,330\nCan it use your location?\n\n1005\n00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:07,820\nCan it use your location when\nyou're not using the app?\n\n1006\n00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,880\nSo you start thinking about\nwhat's going on, right?\n\n1007\n00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,320\nThat means this app can\nget into my contact list.\n\n1008\n00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,010\nIt knows where I am via GPS,\neven though I've got the app closed.\n\n1009\n00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:20,880\nSo you can dig a lot of information,\npeople think that maybe they have gotten\n\n1010\n00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,830\nrid of that stuff, but the individual apps\ncould be tracking a lot of that, as well.\n\n1011\n00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:29,700\nSo it's another place I can\nlook to try and get that data.\n\n1012\n00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,210\n>> So.\n>> Just to kind of throw on there on\n\n1013\n00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:36,670\nthere, I got on my computer here,\nI was bringing this up to look at.\n\n1014\n00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:43,210\nYou can see on here I went to this one\nwebsite, it's called Wall of Sheep.\n\n1015\n00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:43,710\n>> Nice.\n\n1016\n00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:47,690\n>> I'll let you figure out what\nthat means, or all your stuff,\n\n1017\n00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:52,460\nI think I brought this up in the CEH\nclass as well, but this just shows you,\n\n1018\n00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:57,540\nI mean, you don't have to buy it through\nthis site, but they have SIM cards that\n\n1019\n00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:04,270\nare prepaid that you can just buy,\npop in your phone, and your ready to go,\n\n1020\n00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:08,190\nand take a look, no registration,\nno personal information, nothing.\n\n1021\n00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:14,340\nYou've got a SIM card\nthat you can do stuff and\n\n1022\n00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:18,180\nlook they've got them with different\namounts of data on them, different sizes.\n\n1023\n00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:22,590\nAll you've gotta do is just pop this\ninto something and you're ready to go.\n\n1024\n00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,980\nWow.\n>> And think about it.\n\n1025\n00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,010\nThis is one of those cases where you say,\nwell, what if you buy it through here?\n\n1026\n00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,510\nDon't they have a record of that?\n\n1027\n00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:36,205\nYes, they would have a record of it,\nbut I don't have to play by the rules.\n\n1028\n00:57:36,205 --> 00:57:40,015\nTools and make it an address,\nor make it the address and\n\n1029\n00:57:40,015 --> 00:57:42,645\ntransaction from stuff that\nthey're gonna be able to find.\n\n1030\n00:57:42,645 --> 00:57:45,275\nIf I wanna buy something like this,\nI just price it out.\n\n1031\n00:57:45,275 --> 00:57:49,215\nGo buy one of those prepaid Visa cards,\nI don't an identification or\n\n1032\n00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,015\nanything like that.\n\n1033\n00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,060\nGet a box, a mail box.\n\n1034\n00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:56,460\nAt something like a UPS store.\n\n1035\n00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,750\nOr FedEx or something like that.\n\n1036\n00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,630\nThose things do not require\nthe same checks that\n\n1037\n00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:03,490\nthe stuff at the post office does.\n\n1038\n00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,500\nAt least here in the states does it.\n\n1039\n00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,450\nSo you just get a prepaid data card.\n\n1040\n00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:12,950\nOr prepaid credit card,\npay for it with that.\n\n1041\n00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:15,936\nThen put the address to\nship it to as that box,\n\n1042\n00:58:15,936 --> 00:58:20,507\nget some stuff shipped there and\nthen one it get's there you take it.\n\n1043\n00:58:20,507 --> 00:58:23,720\nYou don't use the box anymore after you\nget those deliveries and you're gone.\n\n1044\n00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,480\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1045\n00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,540\nNo trace, gone with the wind.\n\n1046\n00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,410\n>> Yeah that's the thing you\njust gotta like you know\n\n1047\n00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,130\nthink ahead with these things.\n\n1048\n00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:34,080\nAnd so yeah, you can get cards like this,\nand they're not the only ones.\n\n1049\n00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:38,110\nYou can go to, if you live in a,\nfor example a tourist area,\n\n1050\n00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:43,840\nespecially a tourist area that gets\na lot of foreigners coming in,\n\n1051\n00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,300\nthat really works to your advantage,\nand I'll tell you why.\n\n1052\n00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,294\nI can use a really really good example.\n\n1053\n00:58:50,294 --> 00:58:55,216\nIf you go to a place like Hawaii they get\na lot of tourists from all over the place,\n\n1054\n00:58:55,216 --> 00:58:59,992\nand a lot of them because of where Hawaii\nis a lot of those tourists are Asians,\n\n1055\n00:58:59,992 --> 00:59:04,916\nthey are coming from Japan, Korea, China,\nand all those places and more, and\n\n1056\n00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:08,917\nwhat they will do is that's very\nfamiliar for them to come over.\n\n1057\n00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:14,228\nHere with their phone and\nbuy a sim chip like I was showing you so\n\n1058\n00:59:14,228 --> 00:59:19,135\nthat they can use their\nphones on our networks here.\n\n1059\n00:59:19,135 --> 00:59:23,590\nSo with that in mind,\na lot of the shops there all over, for\n\n1060\n00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:28,150\nexample the Waikiki area of Oahu,\nthey've got stores there that\n\n1061\n00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:32,860\nevery store you go into has\nthese prepaid SIM cards.\n\n1062\n00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:37,530\nAll you gotta do is slap\na 20 on the counter, and\n\n1063\n00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:38,900\ntake a SIM card, and you're done.\n\n1064\n00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,910\nThey will ask you for anything, and\n\n1065\n00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:45,670\nso now you've got a sim chip you can pop\ninto your burner phone and you're done.\n\n1066\n00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:48,820\nYou can buy a deck of those things and\njust use them whenever you want.\n\n1067\n00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:53,360\nI don't think they expire for two, three,\nfour years in some cases, or ever.\n\n1068\n00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,996\nSo you can use those things for\na long time so\n\n1069\n00:59:54,996 --> 00:59:56,874\nif you've got an area\nwhere there's tourists.\n\n1070\n00:59:56,874 --> 01:00:02,209\nStuff like Hawaii would be or\na Vegas or near anything like that.\n\n1071\n01:00:02,209 --> 01:00:03,277\n>> Orlando, Florida.\n\n1072\n01:00:03,277 --> 01:00:05,716\n>> Yeah Orlando, any place like that.\n\n1073\n01:00:05,716 --> 01:00:08,160\nThese may be readily available.\n\n1074\n01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,070\nIn the store I would not go to\nlike a cellphone provider store,\n\n1075\n01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:16,380\nlike an AT&T store or a Verizon store, cuz\nthey're gonna ask all sorts of questions.\n\n1076\n01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,100\nI don't want any questions at all.\n\n1077\n01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:21,832\nI want to go buy the thing, pop it in my\nphone, and start my stalking business.\n\n1078\n01:00:21,832 --> 01:00:26,109\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, well, looking at the clock\n\n1079\n01:00:26,109 --> 01:00:28,450\nladies and gentlemen, it's about time for\nus to take another one of those breaks.\n\n1080\n01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,860\nWe're gonna step away.\n\n1081\n01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,230\nWhen we come back more mobile forensics.\n\n1082\n01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,350\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1083\n01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:35,650\nWe'll be right back.\n\n1084\n01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:42,900\nAll right welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n1085\n01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,030\nSo, we are continuing on with\nour mobile forensics and\n\n1086\n01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:49,860\nShawn, we started talking about some of\nthe different types of information that\n\n1087\n01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,760\ncan be present on these devices.\n\n1088\n01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,182\nWe were also talking about some of the\nchallenges that we face with these mobile\n\n1089\n01:00:56,182 --> 01:00:58,531\ndevices and\nI do not think we hit them all.\n\n1090\n01:00:58,531 --> 01:01:01,746\nLet's go back and take a look at some of\nthe other things that make it a little bit\n\n1091\n01:01:01,746 --> 01:01:04,150\ndifferent when we are working\nwith these mobile devices.\n\n1092\n01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:08,909\n>> There are a lot of different\nchallenges specifically\n\n1093\n01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:12,780\nbecause it is mobile environment.\n\n1094\n01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,840\nWhy things are changing and\n\n1095\n01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:20,930\ngetting better, there are still some\nareas where we are kinda stuck.\n\n1096\n01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:26,450\nAnd we may be kind of Macguyvering\nsome sort of a solution for.\n\n1097\n01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:31,050\nOne of the things we have is, we did\nmention there is no standard approach.\n\n1098\n01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:34,030\nThere is no single approach\nto anything either.\n\n1099\n01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:38,600\nSo you can't just go in and expect you're\ngonna use the same, process each and\n\n1100\n01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,870\nevery time because that\nwill not hold water.\n\n1101\n01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:42,620\nIt's gonna break.\n\n1102\n01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,510\nYou're gonna miss stuff, and\nthen that will be called into question.\n\n1103\n01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,860\nSo no standard or single approach.\n\n1104\n01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:52,300\nThe other thing we have is there\nare situations where you will find or\n\n1105\n01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:56,390\nencounter a device, whatever it is, phone,\n\n1106\n01:01:56,390 --> 01:02:01,380\ntablet, and\nheck we did mention cars early on.\n\n1107\n01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:05,780\nThat could be another unique situation,\nis a unique situation.\n\n1108\n01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,850\nYou may have such a unique situation,\n\n1109\n01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:12,810\nthat you don't have a solution to\nactually do any investigation.\n\n1110\n01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:15,700\nThat there's no equipment available for\nit to do that.\n\n1111\n01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,910\nSo that could be a massive, problem,\n\n1112\n01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:24,350\nif you know there's stuff on that device,\nthat you need to extract, and\n\n1113\n01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:28,480\nyou don't have any methods of\ngetting into, an extracting it.\n\n1114\n01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,010\nWhat do you do?\n\n1115\n01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:33,350\nIt's effectively locked,\nand out of your reach.\n\n1116\n01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:38,660\nNow, you can usually,\ndepending on how ambitious you are, and\n\n1117\n01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:44,430\ndepending what access to resources\nyou have, you might be able\n\n1118\n01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:49,620\nto pull it off, but\nif could be very very tough.\n\n1119\n01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:56,320\nI mean, what if you had someone\nthat had a hack into vehicle,\n\n1120\n01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:01,280\ninto a navigation system, or\nin the on-board computers in a vehicle?\n\n1121\n01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,560\nIt's not outside the realm of possibility.\n\n1122\n01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,942\nI mean hack you could literally be\ndoing a forensic investigation,\n\n1123\n01:03:07,942 --> 01:03:12,033\non that little black box that they have on\nsome computers that keeps track of some of\n\n1124\n01:03:12,033 --> 01:03:13,180\nthe breaking things.\n\n1125\n01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,600\nIt's not designed for\nCrime scene type stuff, but\n\n1126\n01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,990\nsome of the newer cars do have what\namounts to a black box to a key that can\n\n1127\n01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:26,700\nbe extracted to tell what was happening in\nthe seconds leading up to that accident,\n\n1128\n01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,340\nso-\n>> It might show GPS locations,\n\n1129\n01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:32,210\nwhere you have all got those nav systems\nnow in our car, they're gonna try.\n\n1130\n01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:35,793\nTrack history of where that vehicle's\nbeen, where it was turned on,\n\n1131\n01:03:35,793 --> 01:03:39,923\nwhere it was turned off and all that stuff\ncould very well be located in that system\n\n1132\n01:03:39,923 --> 01:03:43,992\nsomewhere and as an investigator I might\nbe able to pull that information out and\n\n1133\n01:03:43,992 --> 01:03:48,362\nprove that somebody, or at least prove the\nvehicle, was at the scene of the crime, or\n\n1134\n01:03:48,362 --> 01:03:49,552\nsomething like that.\n\n1135\n01:03:49,552 --> 01:03:55,292\n>> Yeah, or if its an accident because it,\nlet's throw that in there.\n\n1136\n01:03:55,292 --> 01:04:00,429\nSomeone had an accident and they're saying\nand they're Saying different things,\n\n1137\n01:04:00,429 --> 01:04:04,624\nor it seems like there's something\nmaybe missing from the story, or\n\n1138\n01:04:04,624 --> 01:04:07,220\nyou need to kind of fill in some gaps.\n\n1139\n01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,790\nWell, you may be able to\nget into that black box,\n\n1140\n01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:14,200\nwhich does contain that braking, and\nI believe acceleration information.\n\n1141\n01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,400\nIt contains all that stuff, so\n\n1142\n01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,660\nyou might be able to see what that person,\nif they're saying oh no, I hit the brakes.\n\n1143\n01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:24,480\nAnd this person just stopped suddenly or\nwhatever, it's like no,\n\n1144\n01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,660\nyou never hit the brakes.\n\n1145\n01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:29,050\nYou were actually speeding and\nyou never tapped the brake and\n\n1146\n01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,456\nyou rear-ended that person or whatever.\n\n1147\n01:04:31,456 --> 01:04:33,972\nSo-\n>> We've probably all seen some\n\n1148\n01:04:33,972 --> 01:04:37,440\ncommercials for certain insurance\ncompanies that wanna give you a break.\n\n1149\n01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,190\nIf you'll plug this device into your car,\n\n1150\n01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,540\nthen we can give you\na break on your insurance.\n\n1151\n01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:45,352\nAnd that's exactly what they're tracking\nis that very same information about how\n\n1152\n01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:49,117\nfast you're driving on average, how\nheavy you're braking, things like that.\n\n1153\n01:04:49,117 --> 01:04:49,957\n>> Yeah.\n>> So that same\n\n1154\n01:04:49,957 --> 01:04:55,060\ninfo we might be able to get access\nto in the course of an investigation.\n\n1155\n01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,610\n>> Yeah, the newer cars do have those.\n\n1156\n01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,690\nI mean don't kid yourself,\nthey do have those.\n\n1157\n01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:03,360\nThey use those for,\nthat black box wasn't meant to be used\n\n1158\n01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,650\nlike what we're talking about,\nbut it has been used for that.\n\n1159\n01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:09,776\nIt was originally put in by\nthe car manufacturers for\n\n1160\n01:05:09,776 --> 01:05:13,480\nsome of the engine management purposes and\nthings like that.\n\n1161\n01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,739\nBut now they've said, oh,\nby the way, that stuff's in there.\n\n1162\n01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:20,190\nAnd yeah, you should have seen\nthe public when that first came out.\n\n1163\n01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,060\nThey were like what?\n\n1164\n01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:23,670\nAll the privacy people\nwere coming out with that.\n\n1165\n01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:28,490\nThe thing is your car gets in an accident\nand they need to investigate,\n\n1166\n01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:30,730\nthey may not even need a search\nwarrant at that point.\n\n1167\n01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:33,095\nYou were involved in an accident.\n\n1168\n01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:38,143\nAnd so they may very well just be able\nto pull that right off of there and\n\n1169\n01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,270\nget that information.\n\n1170\n01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:44,900\n>> Since 95 cars have had to have\nthat on-board diagnostics port.\n\n1171\n01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:49,350\nAnd now you can actually go buy Bluetooth\ndevices that plug into that and\n\n1172\n01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:54,180\nwill read, and on your phone you can\nhave speedometer gauges and thrust for\n\n1173\n01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:57,948\nyour turbo, and braking levels, and\ntemperature and all that stuff.\n\n1174\n01:05:57,948 --> 01:06:01,420\nSo it's all information that we might\nbe able to use in our investigation.\n\n1175\n01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,300\n>> Yeah, and the question is,\nhow do you attach to that.\n\n1176\n01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,680\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so there might be connectors,\n\n1177\n01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,050\nit's gotten better, like you said for the\ndiagnostic stuff it's gotten a lot better.\n\n1178\n01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,910\nBut if you're trying to get stuff\nout of the computer that could be\n\n1179\n01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:15,680\na little more of a challenge.\n\n1180\n01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,746\nBut then again you have\nthe auto manufacturers,\n\n1181\n01:06:18,746 --> 01:06:21,153\nthey may be willing to do that for you.\n\n1182\n01:06:21,153 --> 01:06:27,086\nAgain, with the appropriate legal paper\nwork, a lot of them will say yeah,\n\n1183\n01:06:27,086 --> 01:06:31,813\nwe will help you and provide one\nof our experts to work with you\n\n1184\n01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:35,960\nto get that information\nout if it's really needed.\n\n1185\n01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,480\nSo it may not be out of reach, but\nthen, look at what you had to do.\n\n1186\n01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,840\nYou didn't have any equipment.\n\n1187\n01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:45,350\nYou had to go back to\nthe horse's mouth to figure out\n\n1188\n01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:49,150\nhow to get the information out of such and\nsuch device.\n\n1189\n01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:53,980\nSo do remember that,\nthere may not be standard solutions,\n\n1190\n01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:59,370\nnot only not be standard solutions, but\nthere may not even be a solution at all.\n\n1191\n01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:01,850\nYou may have to come up with\nsomething really creative and\n\n1192\n01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:05,760\nthat may be calling someone that's\nmade it and saying what can you do.\n\n1193\n01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,510\nAnd they may have to kind of make\nsomething up on their end cuz\n\n1194\n01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:13,780\nthey might be, we never really thought\nabout having that being used that way.\n\n1195\n01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:17,210\nBut they may still be able to help you,\nso do remember that.\n\n1196\n01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:21,120\nThat that's a challenge that could come\nout, so you may want to get more familiar\n\n1197\n01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,780\nwith the hardware that you're\ndealing with just in case.\n\n1198\n01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:28,880\n>> All right, and then we got back over to\nwhat types of information I might expect\n\n1199\n01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,300\nto get off of some these mobile devices.\n\n1200\n01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:35,020\nWe had mentioned applications\nthat can grab, and track, and\n\n1201\n01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:38,550\nstore all kinds of\ninformation on those devices.\n\n1202\n01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:39,580\nNetwork information,\n\n1203\n01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:43,490\ninformation about networks we've connected\nto as we've roamed between place to place.\n\n1204\n01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:47,830\n>> Yes, those things do come into play,\n\n1205\n01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,840\nyes you have the networks\nthat you've attached to.\n\n1206\n01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,780\nAnd remember, that includes both WiFi and\n\n1207\n01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:56,440\nthe cellular networks,\nyou can get that information.\n\n1208\n01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:01,940\nAs far as the apps go, the apps can\nstore varying amounts of information.\n\n1209\n01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:06,720\nYou were talking about, Mike, about all\nthe things that can read off a device.\n\n1210\n01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:13,180\nA lot of these apps, they read excessive\namounts of information off of a device.\n\n1211\n01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:17,922\nAnd so what you install could very well be\nyou just giving up your privacy entirely.\n\n1212\n01:08:17,922 --> 01:08:19,161\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1213\n01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,290\nI know in iOS,\nthat's one of the big reasons now,\n\n1214\n01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:23,400\nwe have a lot of these\nprompts that we get.\n\n1215\n01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,690\nBecause some of these app designers\nwere grabbing information that\n\n1216\n01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:30,420\nthey really had no business,\nthey had no need for.\n\n1217\n01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:34,288\nSome of my apps don't need my\nlocation information at all,\n\n1218\n01:08:34,288 --> 01:08:36,930\nit's gonna have no effect\non that application.\n\n1219\n01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:39,100\nYet they were grabbing it,\nbecause they could.\n\n1220\n01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,820\nAnd so now we're seeing a lot\nof these are prompting me hey,\n\n1221\n01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:45,710\ndo you want to allow this app\nto access your contacts or\n\n1222\n01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:49,650\nyour location information,\nyour GPS and things like that.\n\n1223\n01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:52,590\n>> This is,\nI'll put it out there for you guys,\n\n1224\n01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:56,570\nyou wanna take a look at it, this is only\nfor you so I got it up on my screen here.\n\n1225\n01:08:56,570 --> 01:09:01,190\nThis would only be good for those of\nyou that are in the Android space.\n\n1226\n01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:03,453\nI really don't know an equivalent\non the iPhone side.\n\n1227\n01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:06,907\n>> There isn't, that I know of.\n\n1228\n01:09:06,907 --> 01:09:07,931\n>> You've seen this one?\n\n1229\n01:09:07,931 --> 01:09:09,200\n>> I've seen this, yeah.\n\n1230\n01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,016\nNate was showing me this one, very cool.\n\n1231\n01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:14,514\n>> Yeah, I've had this one on my phone for\nprobably about six,\n\n1232\n01:09:14,514 --> 01:09:16,928\nseven months now, something like that.\n\n1233\n01:09:16,928 --> 01:09:21,593\nAnd I love it cuz what I do is,\nwhat this app will allow you to do,\n\n1234\n01:09:21,593 --> 01:09:27,669\nis you can into that app and you can start\ngoing to each one of the applications, and\n\n1235\n01:09:27,669 --> 01:09:33,426\nyou can start shutting off the permissions\nthat you don't want them to have.\n\n1236\n01:09:33,426 --> 01:09:37,762\nI don't want such and\nsuch a device, or application,\n\n1237\n01:09:37,762 --> 01:09:42,580\nbe able to read my location or\nread my cell phone or anything.\n\n1238\n01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:44,470\nAnd they usually tell you, or\n\n1239\n01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:48,650\nall of them tell you, when's the last\ntime they used that permission, if ever.\n\n1240\n01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:51,090\nI don't care if it's says I've never\nused it, you ain't getting it.\n\n1241\n01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:54,450\nYou have no reason to have that on and\nI'm not giving you the choice.\n\n1242\n01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:56,090\nSo I will lock it down.\n\n1243\n01:09:56,090 --> 01:10:00,644\nThe problem with applications like this\nis if you are with someone that's not\n\n1244\n01:10:00,644 --> 01:10:05,266\ntechnically savvy and is not aware of\nthe consequences of some of this stuff and\n\n1245\n01:10:05,266 --> 01:10:08,769\nhow to troubleshoot if you've\nused this and had problems,\n\n1246\n01:10:08,769 --> 01:10:13,489\nyou could very well end up crippling your\nphone [LAUGH] by turning off something.\n\n1247\n01:10:13,489 --> 01:10:16,732\nI've seen people say,\nwell this application doesn't need\n\n1248\n01:10:16,732 --> 01:10:20,174\nto read my GPS information so\nI'm gonna turn all that stuff off.\n\n1249\n01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:23,485\nIt's like, yeah, it's your navigation app,\nit kind of needs that.\n\n1250\n01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:24,813\n>> It might.\n\n1251\n01:10:24,813 --> 01:10:27,386\n>> Yeah, so\nyou'll see those little sorts of things,\n\n1252\n01:10:27,386 --> 01:10:29,790\nbut it's actually a great thing.\n\n1253\n01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:34,870\nFor your information, if you guys do\nwant to use something like this and\n\n1254\n01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:38,440\nyou do have Android, be aware it's not\nsupported on every version of Android.\n\n1255\n01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,380\nGoogle seems to keep doing something,\nat least for a while,\n\n1256\n01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:43,540\nwas disabling it with updates,\n\n1257\n01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:48,010\nbecause they were concerned that people\nwere gonna break the apps on their phone.\n\n1258\n01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:51,620\nMake of that what you will, but\nthey said they were concerned about that.\n\n1259\n01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:56,220\nBut I've found it still does work\nwith a good number of phones, so\n\n1260\n01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:58,190\nthat's kind of the cool thing.\n\n1261\n01:10:58,190 --> 01:10:59,989\nAnd like I said, I love it, and\n\n1262\n01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:03,257\nit keeps those apps from\nleaking too much information.\n\n1263\n01:11:03,257 --> 01:11:06,529\nAnd hopefully the app developers\nwill get better at it so\n\n1264\n01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:09,800\nyou don't have to worry\nabout these things.\n\n1265\n01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,330\n>> And I said iOS doesn't\nhave an app that does this.\n\n1266\n01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:16,490\niOS in the settings, [COUGH] excuse me,\nif you go into your privacy settings,\n\n1267\n01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:20,370\nmost of the apps that gain access to\ncontacts or location like that you've got\n\n1268\n01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:23,560\na little switch basically\nthat you can turn on or off.\n\n1269\n01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,590\nSo not really a separate app for it, but\n\n1270\n01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:29,362\nmost of that is available in your\nprivacy settings if you dig deep enough.\n\n1271\n01:11:29,362 --> 01:11:32,410\nThey don't make it super accessible,\nbut you can find it in there.\n\n1272\n01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:37,350\nYou'll see each app and what it can access\nand you can usually disable that there.\n\n1273\n01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:40,343\n>> I would add onto that\none other thing about apps,\n\n1274\n01:11:40,343 --> 01:11:44,650\nbecause we were talking about crimes\nin one of our previous segments.\n\n1275\n01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:49,610\nThere's a lot of apps you'll see in\nthe Google Play store, you'll see in\n\n1276\n01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:54,650\nthe iPhone store, stuff for the iPhone,\nyou'll see all of those things.\n\n1277\n01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:59,170\nElse some of those apps will say that you\ncan only run them if the device is rooted.\n\n1278\n01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:06,330\nAnd it's quite common to see\nthat on the Google Play Store.\n\n1279\n01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:09,511\nWell.\nThe things is, as far as crimes go, for\n\n1280\n01:12:09,511 --> 01:12:14,270\nsome, and I know there's gonna be\nprobably people in the discussion\n\n1281\n01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:18,796\ngroup that are gonna not like\nhearing this, or disagree with it.\n\n1282\n01:12:18,796 --> 01:12:23,300\nIs unlocking your device is actually\nconsidered in a lot of cases to be\n\n1283\n01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,474\nagainst the law.\n\n1284\n01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:25,496\n>> Really?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1285\n01:12:25,496 --> 01:12:31,338\nIt's changing cuz cell phone\nproviders got really irritated\n\n1286\n01:12:31,338 --> 01:12:36,850\nabout people just jail breaking\ndevices and doing stuff.\n\n1287\n01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:40,140\nI mean, I think Apple was\nthe first one that tried to.\n\n1288\n01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:44,797\nPut the stops on that, because, and\ntrying to use the DMCA to do it.\n\n1289\n01:12:44,797 --> 01:12:47,015\nIt's like you're messing with our stuff.\n\n1290\n01:12:47,015 --> 01:12:52,389\nSo it was against the law, and\nstill is in a lot of cases.\n\n1291\n01:12:53,433 --> 01:13:00,850\nBut congress also came in, here in\nthe states, came in and said well if\n\n1292\n01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:05,780\nyou need your phone unlocked your service\nprovider has to give you an unlock code.\n\n1293\n01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:08,840\nSo if you buy a device\nthat's bound to you.\n\n1294\n01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:13,170\nYou get one of those incentive phones\nthat's bound to a provider and\n\n1295\n01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:17,680\nyou want to go to someplace else, they're\nsupposed to give you the code if you ask.\n\n1296\n01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,090\nThey always tend to kinda hem and haw.\n\n1297\n01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:21,790\n>> They're not going to make it easy,\nare they?\n\n1298\n01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:23,930\n>> Yeah, they'll try to say but\nwhy are you going?\n\n1299\n01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:26,500\nWhy you go into another one?\n\n1300\n01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,950\nIs there there anything we can do and\ntalk.\n\n1301\n01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:29,550\nIt's like just unlock the phone.\n\n1302\n01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:30,330\nBut we have this new.\n\n1303\n01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:31,740\nJust unlock the phone.\n\n1304\n01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,880\nIt's just like you got to\nshake them by the lapels and\n\n1305\n01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,790\nsay dude see what I'm saying, unlock it.\n\n1306\n01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:42,850\nThey have to do that but\nyeah it's considered a crime to do that.\n\n1307\n01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:46,460\nSo be aware of that, not like you're\ngonna get arrested and sent to.\n\n1308\n01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:47,230\niPhone prison or\n\n1309\n01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:51,670\nAndroid prison, but figured it was\nan interesting thing to mention.\n\n1310\n01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:56,010\nWouldn't stop me from jail-breaking\nmy phone if I wanted to, but.\n\n1311\n01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:58,160\n>> Other information we can\nfind on these mobile devices.\n\n1312\n01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,650\nOf course, email is gonna be a big one.\n\n1313\n01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:02,680\nAlmost everybody has their\nemail coming to their phone.\n\n1314\n01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,860\nIn fact probably several\naccounts going to their phone,\n\n1315\n01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:08,510\ntheir personal, their work,\nthings like that.\n\n1316\n01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:11,816\n>> Yeah, I've got, what,\nfour accounts connected on mine, and\n\n1317\n01:14:11,816 --> 01:14:16,057\nI don't know if that's, I haven't compared\nto other people, if that's a lot.\n\n1318\n01:14:16,057 --> 01:14:18,600\n>> I think I'm at four or five so yeah.\n\n1319\n01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,800\n>> There you go,\nthere's my phone going off right now.\n\n1320\n01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,730\n>> So if I got an email I might\n\n1321\n01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:29,180\nbe able to recover emails that\nthey've sent or received.\n\n1322\n01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:32,090\nSeeing who they have sent or\nreceived those emails from.\n\n1323\n01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,550\nEmails have attachments.\n\n1324\n01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:36,060\nWe might be able to recover some\nof that data off of these guys.\n\n1325\n01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,920\nThen SMS is obviously another big one.\n\n1326\n01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,310\n>> Yeah.\n\n1327\n01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:44,860\nSMS is a nice, juicy target.\n\n1328\n01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:48,240\nI couldn't even put it\nany better than that.\n\n1329\n01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:53,080\nThat's the thing, that if you can get,\n\n1330\n01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:58,075\nit's gonna, it can yield just so\nmuch information it's just crazy.\n\n1331\n01:14:58,075 --> 01:15:01,340\nBecause, think about typical\nhuman behavior nowadays and\n\n1332\n01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:02,610\npeople that have those devices.\n\n1333\n01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:07,810\nGo to a restaurant,\ngo anyplace how many people are like tap,\n\n1334\n01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:09,620\ntap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.\n\n1335\n01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:12,720\nYou can't stand in line at some\nplace without having the next few\n\n1336\n01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,450\npeople ahead of you like tap,\ntap, tap, tap, tap, tap,\n\n1337\n01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:16,620\ntap they're tapping out\ntext messages constantly.\n\n1338\n01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,960\nFor everything.\n\n1339\n01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,080\n>> I'm at the red light\nthat has now turned green.\n\n1340\n01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,530\n>> Yes.\n>> And the person in front of me is\n\n1341\n01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:22,500\ntap, tap, tap.\n\n1342\n01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,440\nSo yeah, everywhere.\n\n1343\n01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,970\n>> Yeah.\n>> So what does that mean?\n\n1344\n01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:28,960\nThey're documenting their lives in there.\n\n1345\n01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:34,270\nThat may be what we need\nto prove our case and\n\n1346\n01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:36,480\nyou may, you may, and\nthat's one of the things, also,\n\n1347\n01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:42,330\nabout SMS message is that you think that,\nwell, if you delete them, they're gone.\n\n1348\n01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:46,846\nWell, it's, you kinda know what\nroad you're going down there.\n\n1349\n01:15:46,846 --> 01:15:51,716\nThey're not deleted, then you get\nthe next thing, you hear all the time,\n\n1350\n01:15:51,716 --> 01:15:55,887\nwell, I reset my phone before I sell it or\nlet anyone else use it so\n\n1351\n01:15:55,887 --> 01:15:58,980\nthey can't recover those things.\n\n1352\n01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:03,290\nSome phones are better at\nthe reset process than others.\n\n1353\n01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:09,060\nThat's where you gotta point to anybody\nthat has an iPhone because an iPhone.\n\n1354\n01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:14,176\nIs known as a, it's a popular device, but\n\n1355\n01:16:14,176 --> 01:16:19,729\nit's also the worst at\nleaking information.\n\n1356\n01:16:19,729 --> 01:16:21,653\n>> Right.\n>> Even after you've reset it,\n\n1357\n01:16:21,653 --> 01:16:23,838\nthere's stuff, if you can plug into it and\n\n1358\n01:16:23,838 --> 01:16:27,190\nextract everything you want off\nof it because it's still there.\n\n1359\n01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:27,850\n>> Cuz it's cheating.\n\n1360\n01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:30,030\nIt's doing like we talked about\nwhen deleting files, right?\n\n1361\n01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:30,940\nIt's not actually going and\n\n1362\n01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:36,000\nformatting that how many gigs of\ndata that'll hold or what have you.\n\n1363\n01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,190\nIt's just making it so it's not\naccessible through the GUI front end.\n\n1364\n01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:41,420\n>> Yeah, it even goes even beyond that,\nyou're right about that,\n\n1365\n01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:45,340\nit even goes beyond that where some\nof it's stored in chips on that board\n\n1366\n01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:50,470\noutside of the normal memory there's\nstuff stored there that's still retained,\n\n1367\n01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:54,920\nyou can extract it out of those things\nthat you know that it still lives there.\n\n1368\n01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,060\nYou might get fragments and\nstuff like that, but\n\n1369\n01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:02,060\nas we learned yesterday with file\ncarving and those techniques,\n\n1370\n01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:06,870\nthose fragments may be enough for me to\nreassemble and see what you were doing.\n\n1371\n01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:09,735\n>> Right.\n>> That may be all it takes, but yes.\n\n1372\n01:17:09,735 --> 01:17:14,720\niPhone are known as being some of\nthe chattiest devices out there with their\n\n1373\n01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:20,040\nembedding of GPS coordinates and\nthe way they store data and all that.\n\n1374\n01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:24,332\nIt's a matter of just plugging in,\nI think you had those boxes-\n\n1375\n01:17:24,332 --> 01:17:25,216\n>> Yeah,.\n\n1376\n01:17:25,216 --> 01:17:26,237\n>> That you can plug in.\n\n1377\n01:17:26,237 --> 01:17:30,981\nThat if you can just easily extract\nthe stuff and they said that there was for\n\n1378\n01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:35,424\na long time people law enforcement and\nsituations like that,\n\n1379\n01:17:35,424 --> 01:17:40,041\nthat had to do forensics on phone,\nthey loved it when they saw an iPhone.\n\n1380\n01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:40,789\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like,\n\n1381\n01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:41,815\nwell this is gonna be a short day.\n\n1382\n01:17:41,815 --> 01:17:42,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Pop.\n\n1383\n01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:45,200\nOkay, we're done,\nwhat else do you want me to do.\n\n1384\n01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,930\n>> Bursting all up and you're good to go.\n\n1385\n01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:47,939\n>> Or maybe it's coffee or\n\n1386\n01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:49,050\nsomething like that-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1387\n01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:49,770\n>> I'm done.\n\n1388\n01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:51,360\n>> Yeah.\n>> That was about what it was.\n\n1389\n01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,430\n>> And like you said even SMS\nnow is getting tagged with GPS.\n\n1390\n01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:58,179\nIt wants to know if I want to allow my\nlocation to go out with my text messages!\n\n1391\n01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:04,800\nThat's just more data that we're gonna\nbe able to get off of that phone.\n\n1392\n01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,503\nAnother one is called history.\n\n1393\n01:18:05,503 --> 01:18:09,021\nObviously, our phones keep track of the\nphone calls we're making and receiving.\n\n1394\n01:18:09,021 --> 01:18:09,614\n>> Yeah.\n\n1395\n01:18:09,614 --> 01:18:12,580\nThe call history is there.\n\n1396\n01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:15,390\nWhen it's deleted it can still reside.\n\n1397\n01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:16,800\nSome place on there.\n\n1398\n01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:22,450\nBut yes if you can recover call history,\nthat's another big chunk of data.\n\n1399\n01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:27,307\nWho is this individual calling, and\nthen you can start looking at those phone\n\n1400\n01:18:27,307 --> 01:18:30,308\nnumbers and see,\nwhat are those people doing?\n\n1401\n01:18:30,308 --> 01:18:31,527\nWho are they?\n\n1402\n01:18:31,527 --> 01:18:32,820\nWhat are they up to?\n\n1403\n01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:36,230\nAnd then see if that is\nsomething that might be another\n\n1404\n01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:39,810\npart of the investigation that maybe\nsearch warrants need to be issued for.\n\n1405\n01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:43,230\nMaybe somebody needs to questioned,\nor what have you.\n\n1406\n01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:48,920\nIt could be something that connects\nthe individual that called that person,\n\n1407\n01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,860\nto a specific crime.\n\n1408\n01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,560\nYou could have it where you pull a bunch\nof phone numbers out of there, and\n\n1409\n01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,030\nfind that person.\n\n1410\n01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:58,940\nHad a, called a bunch of,\n\n1411\n01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:02,960\nhad a regular habit of calling\na known drug dealer, for example.\n\n1412\n01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,790\nIt's like, well you call someone\nthat we have picked up and\n\n1413\n01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:09,530\nprosecuted several times for\nthe crime of dealing drugs.\n\n1414\n01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:11,430\nWe know you've got, there's some reason,\nthe reason you were there,\n\n1415\n01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:17,400\nwe suspect its because of this and\nso you're building a case on that.\n\n1416\n01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,760\nAnd so this one,\n\n1417\n01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,720\nDebra asked what about text messages\nthat have been deleted from the phone.\n\n1418\n01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,960\nCan those be recovered?\n\n1419\n01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,750\nYeah, yeah, those can.\n\n1420\n01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:30,230\nAs far as that person's response it can be\nrecovered by the provider up to a point.\n\n1421\n01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:32,870\nThat's the sticky part.\n\n1422\n01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:36,790\nThat really is the sticky\npart of the situation.\n\n1423\n01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:40,900\nLet's say I got text messages sent to me\n\n1424\n01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:45,848\nby someone who was trying to harass me or\nstalk me, or anything like that.\n\n1425\n01:19:45,848 --> 01:19:50,820\nI may not be able to get those.\n\n1426\n01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,001\nIn a lot of cases you won't.\n\n1427\n01:19:52,001 --> 01:19:56,485\nIf you call up your cell phone provider\nsay 'I need a copy of those things that\n\n1428\n01:19:56,485 --> 01:20:00,850\nwere sent to my account' They a lot of\ntimes will say we don't have those.\n\n1429\n01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:02,370\nThose came from the other side.\n\n1430\n01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:04,960\nYou have to ask that person's provider.\n\n1431\n01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,320\nAnd then that opens up\nall sorts of messes.\n\n1432\n01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:13,930\nNow if you had responded to those things\n,they could very well give you those but\n\n1433\n01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:17,750\nif they give you those, you're only\nseeing one side of the conversation.\n\n1434\n01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:20,420\nSo, and\nthey have special legal phone numbers for\n\n1435\n01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:23,750\nevery one of the providers,\nthat will explain those to you.\n\n1436\n01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:25,430\nAnd what they can and can't do.\n\n1437\n01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:27,590\nAnd what you have to do to\nget ahold of those records.\n\n1438\n01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:30,900\n>> Which changes who I have to talk\nabout getting a warrant to search and\n\n1439\n01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,468\nthings like that,\nwhich provider I'm going to?\n\n1440\n01:20:32,468 --> 01:20:33,910\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah, exactly.\n\n1441\n01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:35,530\nAnd then we've got videos as well as,\n\n1442\n01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:40,220\nI don't know if you heard of taking videos\non the phone or watching videos or both.\n\n1443\n01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,982\nIt can be either.\n\n1444\n01:20:41,982 --> 01:20:47,180\nAnd nowadays,\nI would say it's more than likely someone\n\n1445\n01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:52,300\ntaking videos because\nwe've got a lot of space.\n\n1446\n01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,490\nWe can get good videos on a phone.\n\n1447\n01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:57,720\nSo people are taking many,\nmany, many, more videos.\n\n1448\n01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:01,340\nIf you go some place,\na place with a lot of tourists,\n\n1449\n01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:07,540\nyou'll see people panning around and\ndoing all these things.\n\n1450\n01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:10,080\nTaking video after video after video.\n\n1451\n01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:13,310\nSo count on the fact that that\nvery well could be there, I mean,\n\n1452\n01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:18,340\nall you that are on Facebook or\nany of those social networking services,\n\n1453\n01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,670\nyou've probably seen over the past four or\n\n1454\n01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:24,990\nfive years that there has been\nan increasing number of your friends, or\n\n1455\n01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:30,170\ngroups that you are a member of that\nactually are posting a lot of videos now.\n\n1456\n01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:32,110\nBecause they're getting so easy to shoot.\n\n1457\n01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:35,140\nYou don't need a camera to\ntake still pictures, and\n\n1458\n01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:39,960\nsomething else to take video,\nyou gotta enough one one device.\n\n1459\n01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,660\nQuality battery power and\nstorage to do both.\n\n1460\n01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:43,180\n>> Right.\n\n1461\n01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:47,610\nAnd then the recent IOS update for\nexample, has added the recently deleted.\n\n1462\n01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:51,810\nSo we basically now have a recycle bin for\nour images and our video.\n\n1463\n01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:53,830\nSo if you don't know that's there or\ngo to, and\n\n1464\n01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:57,450\nI think they get purged I think after\n30 days or something like that.\n\n1465\n01:21:57,450 --> 01:22:00,740\nBut if you're not used to that,\nyou might have thought you have,\n\n1466\n01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:04,040\nthat person might have thought they\ndeleted a video, or deleted a picture.\n\n1467\n01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,310\nWe might be able to\nrecover from right there.\n\n1468\n01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,560\n>> And don't forget by the way,\n\n1469\n01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:13,350\nyou're probably more than aware\nof this in a lot of cases, but\n\n1470\n01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:18,340\nprobably a lot of you have this setup\nwhere your phone, any pictures or\n\n1471\n01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:23,210\nvideo you take, automatically get\nuploaded some place every day.\n\n1472\n01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:27,042\nFor example, WiFi connection,\nthey just go ahead and\n\n1473\n01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:31,137\nupload to your Cloud account,\nor your OneDrive account.\n\n1474\n01:22:31,137 --> 01:22:32,906\n>> Very familiar, because if you\ndelete a picture off of one device,\n\n1475\n01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,180\nthen you gotta go make sure you've\ngot it off of every other device.\n\n1476\n01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:38,500\nBecause you can get yourself\nin trouble with that.\n\n1477\n01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,630\nSpeak from experience.\n\n1478\n01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:40,240\nExactly.\n\n1479\n01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,760\nOh, what did I take a picture.\n\n1480\n01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,700\nOh, it wasn't me that took that picture,\nI swear.\n\n1481\n01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:49,040\nSo we got video GPS information\nwe've mentioned a few times already.\n\n1482\n01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,100\nI mean it's embedded in\njust about everything.\n\n1483\n01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:55,380\nPictures that we take, videos that we\ntake, SMS can be embedded with that.\n\n1484\n01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:58,430\nYou go into your Facebook app and\nyou can post your location.\n\n1485\n01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:00,780\nYou guys have all done it,\nhey I'm gonna update my status.\n\n1486\n01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:01,810\nAnd it says, where are you at?\n\n1487\n01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:05,890\nAnd it shows you all the surrounding\npopular spots and things like that.\n\n1488\n01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:07,555\nSo it's tied in with my GPS.\n\n1489\n01:23:07,555 --> 01:23:08,299\nIt's all there,\n\n1490\n01:23:08,299 --> 01:23:11,900\nand that's just more information that\nwe're going to be able to recover.\n\n1491\n01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:17,490\n>> And you might be surprised just\nhow many apps use GPS in some way,\n\n1492\n01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:18,180\nshape, or form.\n\n1493\n01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,930\nSome of them you just,\nyou don't expect it.\n\n1494\n01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:23,720\nYou really don't expect it.\n\n1495\n01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:29,680\nA lot of the sporting\nleagues here in the US.\n\n1496\n01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,570\nNFL, NHL, NBA, stuff like that.\n\n1497\n01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:34,990\nThey have apps where you can,\nand subscriptions services,\n\n1498\n01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:36,559\nwhere you can pay to watch their games.\n\n1499\n01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:40,620\nLive on your mobile device.\n\n1500\n01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:44,543\nA lot of those, if you have your\nGPS turned off on your device,\n\n1501\n01:23:44,543 --> 01:23:49,072\nthey won't work because they need to\nknow where you are to see if you're\n\n1502\n01:23:49,072 --> 01:23:51,881\nlegally allowed to watch\nit in your region.\n\n1503\n01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:52,610\n>> Yeah.\n\n1504\n01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:56,460\n>> So if you don't have that turned on,\nyou're done.\n\n1505\n01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:59,900\n>> There's a couple news sites that\nmy mother keeps posting links from.\n\n1506\n01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,020\nLittle cute videos, and\narticles like this.\n\n1507\n01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:03,880\nAnd every time I go to\nclick on one of those,\n\n1508\n01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,880\njust to watch the video that she shared,\nit says it wants to use your location.\n\n1509\n01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,210\nAllow or don't allow.\n\n1510\n01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,430\nAnd I'm like, to watch a video after?\n\n1511\n01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:14,880\nSo you really gotta watch it from\nour standpoint but as a forensic\n\n1512\n01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,180\ninvestigator again just more places we\ncould start to look for that information.\n\n1513\n01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:22,190\nPhone book,\nwe've got all our contacts in there.\n\n1514\n01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:22,840\n>> Yeah, and\n\n1515\n01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:28,890\nremember a phone book isn't just\na phone book in the traditional sense.\n\n1516\n01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:32,680\nIt's not a name and\na phone number or phone numbers.\n\n1517\n01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:37,030\nIt's got much, much more than\nthat in most people's phones.\n\n1518\n01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,610\nIt has a picture of that individual,\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1519\n01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:41,490\n>> Has address information,\n\n1520\n01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:42,880\nemail address information.\n\n1521\n01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,710\nThat's a place where you can put notes.\n\n1522\n01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:47,340\n>> Birthdays, anniversaries,\nspouses names.\n\n1523\n01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,161\nYou name it, you can put it on there\n>> Yeah, that's a treasure trove.\n\n1524\n01:24:50,161 --> 01:24:52,240\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Especially if you want to do something\n\n1525\n01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,750\nlike identify theft.\n\n1526\n01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:55,610\nYou've got quite a bit of information.\n\n1527\n01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:59,650\nLike I said, birthdays and\nstuff like that.\n\n1528\n01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:00,970\nThat gives you quite a bit.\n\n1529\n01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:04,241\nIt may have links to like even Facebook\nprofiles and stuff like that in there.\n\n1530\n01:25:04,241 --> 01:25:07,312\nSo that phonebook is more\nthan just something to say,\n\n1531\n01:25:07,312 --> 01:25:08,820\nokay this is who they are.\n\n1532\n01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:12,960\nThis is their phone numbers,\nit's got all this other stuff in there so\n\n1533\n01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,120\nyou could potentially get a nice bit of,\n\n1534\n01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:19,960\na nice chunk of information that we\nuse to locate all sorts of things.\n\n1535\n01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,050\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1536\n01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,670\nAnd then we've got social media.\n\n1537\n01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:26,950\nWe've kind of hinted at that, but most\npeople are gonna have their social media\n\n1538\n01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:30,330\napps on their phones, we're talking\nthings like Facebook and twitter,\n\n1539\n01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:35,820\nInstagram, and who knows what else.\n\n1540\n01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:36,630\n>> Yeah.\nWell,\n\n1541\n01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:40,900\nwhat more can you say about that seeing\nhow they've got all sorts of social media\n\n1542\n01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,090\nout there.\n\n1543\n01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,470\nAnd people use them all, all the time.\n\n1544\n01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:50,310\nSocial media has definitely increased\nwhen mobile devices got popular.\n\n1545\n01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:54,470\nSmart phones specifically, because you\ncan walk around, anything you see,\n\n1546\n01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:58,920\noh hey look, someone will wanna see this,\nclick and they've got it.\n\n1547\n01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:03,310\nThat was it,\npeople were posting stuff immediately.\n\n1548\n01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:08,550\nI can't help but think of, when I talk\nabout social media and cell phones and\n\n1549\n01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:12,780\nGPS in photo, all that stuff in here,\nI can't help but think, and\n\n1550\n01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:19,620\nI know a lot of you were CEH, but\nI can't help but think of that echo set.\n\n1551\n01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:24,250\nThat's a prime example of just\nhow much information can and\n\n1552\n01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:30,655\nis leaked through a device without\nknowing, without even knowing it at all.\n\n1553\n01:26:30,655 --> 01:26:32,245\n>> Yeah.\n>> So,\n\n1554\n01:26:32,245 --> 01:26:35,555\nwhat about other stuff that\nmight be hanging around?\n\n1555\n01:26:35,555 --> 01:26:37,721\n>> Yeah, what if somebody is trying\nto look for that information?\n\n1556\n01:26:37,721 --> 01:26:39,091\nHow much could they truly get?\n\n1557\n01:26:39,091 --> 01:26:39,926\n>> Yeah.\n\n1558\n01:26:39,926 --> 01:26:42,765\n>> And then last thing I think\nwe wanna talk about here, Sean.\n\n1559\n01:26:42,765 --> 01:26:46,585\nNow that we're done with this, we're gonna\nhave much more to go in another episode.\n\n1560\n01:26:46,585 --> 01:26:49,180\nBut we talked about this earlier when we\n\n1561\n01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:51,240\nfirst started our digital\nforensic investigating.\n\n1562\n01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,230\nWe talked about processes and\n\n1563\n01:26:53,230 --> 01:26:57,480\none of the things we talked about\nwas volatile versus non-volatile.\n\n1564\n01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,870\nWe've got information\nthat is volatile meaning,\n\n1565\n01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:02,850\nif I lose power that\ninformation goes away.\n\n1566\n01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:06,110\nAnd I've got information\nthat's non-volatile that stays\n\n1567\n01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:10,060\neven through turning the device off or\nthe battery completely dying.\n\n1568\n01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,570\nSo we've got to be aware of that as well.\n\n1569\n01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:15,810\nThere is volatile\ninformation on these phones.\n\n1570\n01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:20,110\n>> Yes, these phones when you approach\nthem, you're going to be approaching them\n\n1571\n01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:26,140\nessentially like a you would put\na computer in a lot of cases.\n\n1572\n01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:30,960\nYou're gonna document where it is,\nthe position it happens to be in,\n\n1573\n01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,900\nif the screen is on,\n\n1574\n01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:37,560\nyou're gonna take a picture of what\nwas on the screen when you found it.\n\n1575\n01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,550\nThose sorts of things are very,\nvery important.\n\n1576\n01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:46,602\nBut, then you get into other stuff\nwith a cell phone Is if it's on,\n\n1577\n01:27:46,602 --> 01:27:49,750\nyou're gonna have to leave it on.\n\n1578\n01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:53,210\nNow that makes kinda sense.\n\n1579\n01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:55,870\nWe did it with computers, we did it here.\n\n1580\n01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:59,350\nWhat could possibly happen there?\n\n1581\n01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:01,790\nThere's a lot that could\nactually happen at that point.\n\n1582\n01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:06,620\nIf you think about what's on the line\nthere, you've definitely got data and\n\n1583\n01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:11,596\nmemory and you could very well have a lot\nof apps running in memory that you need to\n\n1584\n01:28:11,596 --> 01:28:13,622\nflip through and take a look at.\n\n1585\n01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:18,167\nYou could have active network connections,\n\n1586\n01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:23,549\nyou could have literally\na wealth of things in there,\n\n1587\n01:28:23,549 --> 01:28:28,820\nso you don't want to turn\nthe thing completely off.\n\n1588\n01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:33,300\nWe saw that with computers,\ndon't turn the thing off.\n\n1589\n01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:37,270\nBut there's other things you gotta worry\nabout with a computer or with a mobile\n\n1590\n01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:44,450\nphone is they typically recommend turning\nall the wireless functionality off.\n\n1591\n01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:45,290\nAnything you can.\n\n1592\n01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:50,380\nHeck, it may be turning the thing\ninto airplane mode just to kinda\n\n1593\n01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:55,140\nshut off all the cell phones, Bluetooth,\nthe cellular stuff, all that stuff.\n\n1594\n01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:58,531\nSo it is effectively\nisolated on that front.\n\n1595\n01:28:58,531 --> 01:29:04,710\nBecause you don't want anything tampering\nwith it in any way, shape, or form.\n\n1596\n01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:07,950\nThat also includes the devices\nthat are paired with it.\n\n1597\n01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:11,930\nIf that thing's sitting on someones desk,\nnext to there computer,\n\n1598\n01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:16,120\nit could very well be syncing\nstuff with that computer.\n\n1599\n01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:19,275\nLast thing you want to do is say ok,\nno one touch the device, it's on.\n\n1600\n01:29:19,275 --> 01:29:21,450\nAnd I know the rules here, don't touch it.\n\n1601\n01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:24,540\nIs have that thing over Bluetooth and\nyou can't exactly see that it has\n\n1602\n01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:31,935\ndesynchronized over Bluetooth is\nhave some alterations happens.\n\n1603\n01:29:31,935 --> 01:29:34,930\nSo that's also a big, big concern.\n\n1604\n01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:40,372\nIf the device is off,\nwell that's a different story.\n\n1605\n01:29:40,372 --> 01:29:45,246\nIf it's off you just leave it off\nuntil you get someplace where you\n\n1606\n01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:47,380\ncan properly analyze, it.\n\n1607\n01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:51,110\nBut if it's on,\nit's a much bigger concern.\n\n1608\n01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:53,570\nThere's even stuff with the battery\nyou've got to worry about.\n\n1609\n01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:58,060\nCertain batteries can discharge\na lot quicker than others.\n\n1610\n01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:01,430\nAnd so if there's a battery\nthey'll say well we may have to\n\n1611\n01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:05,460\ndo something additional to keep this\nthing powered up as we transport it or\n\n1612\n01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:06,640\ndo our investigation.\n\n1613\n01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:11,480\nSo it doesn't lose its charge and\ntherefore, lose the information.\n\n1614\n01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:14,070\n>> Yeah, exactly, because I know\ntomorrow we're gonna talk about\n\n1615\n01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:16,720\nthe forensics process that we go\nthrough with these mobile devices.\n\n1616\n01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:19,150\nBut it does change the game a little\nbit because you might want,\n\n1617\n01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:22,170\nif the device is on leave it on,\nif the device is off leave it off.\n\n1618\n01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:24,500\nBut a lot of these devices go to sleep.\n\n1619\n01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:27,560\nSo if they sit for\nmore than a few minutes, their idle,\n\n1620\n01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,130\nthey lock their screen.\n\n1621\n01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:32,660\nNow I've lost my ability\nto do my investigation.\n\n1622\n01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:37,970\nOr if it dies,\nif the battery itself dies completely and\n\n1623\n01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:40,810\nnow I've gotta be able to\ncharge that battery back up.\n\n1624\n01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,560\nTry to gain access to it.\n\n1625\n01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,990\nSo it does change a lot.\n\n1626\n01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:51,300\nI know we're gonna hit that in our\nforensics process in our next episode.\n\n1627\n01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:54,603\n>> And here's something to take a look at.\n\n1628\n01:30:54,603 --> 01:30:59,175\nWhat I've got, what I've just brought up\n\n1629\n01:30:59,175 --> 01:31:03,630\nhere on my screen is something on Amazon.\n\n1630\n01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:06,670\nYou can get it on Amazon and\nin other places.\n\n1631\n01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:12,810\nWe've got what they call a Black Hole\nFaraday Bag, it's an RF isolation.\n\n1632\n01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:18,080\nAnd you can get these\nin different sizes and\n\n1633\n01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:22,670\nfunctions, but\nwhat this is is that you take your device,\n\n1634\n01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:25,450\nopen up the bag,\ndrop it in there and seal it.\n\n1635\n01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:28,710\nIt is for\nall intensive purposes in a black hole.\n\n1636\n01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:33,657\nSo all that idea of synchronized or\ngetting wireless signals\n\n1637\n01:31:33,657 --> 01:31:37,833\nfrom anything else,\nthat isn't going to happen.\n\n1638\n01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:42,003\nAs you can see you can see\nthrough it at the device,\n\n1639\n01:31:42,003 --> 01:31:47,760\nyou could actually at this point if\nyou wanted to do an analysis on it,\n\n1640\n01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,664\nto start seeing what's going on.\n\n1641\n01:31:50,664 --> 01:31:53,928\nYou could still do it through there, you\ncould actually still do your touches and\n\n1642\n01:31:53,928 --> 01:31:55,520\neverything through there.\n\n1643\n01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,750\nBut there is no RF signals\ngonna get out either way.\n\n1644\n01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:01,830\nIt will all stay in the bag or\noutside the bag, but\n\n1645\n01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:04,960\nthe two have a barrier between them.\n\n1646\n01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,760\nNow the thing I throw in, there's\ndifferent views of it that you have.\n\n1647\n01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,350\nIt's just a simple bag.\n\n1648\n01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:14,462\nI mean, heck, they got a tablet in\nthere so you can see that's a pretty\n\n1649\n01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:18,316\ndecent size one that you just slide\nthe thing in, and close it up.\n\n1650\n01:32:18,316 --> 01:32:24,660\nBut you've got, it's an evidence bag, is\nwhat it is, that you're shipping stuff in.\n\n1651\n01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:32,250\nThis is just one type of this bag,\nthey make several Faraday bags like this.\n\n1652\n01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:36,470\nOne of them, if you go to that situation\nwhere said, well, you gotta keep the,\n\n1653\n01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:41,450\nif the thing's on, keep it on and\nwhat about the battery life issue.\n\n1654\n01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:44,900\nIf it take a while to\nget it back to the lab,\n\n1655\n01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:48,710\nand that only has a little\npercentage of battery left.\n\n1656\n01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:51,480\nA lot of these things,\n\n1657\n01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:57,420\nbags you can get if you spend a little bit\nmore on and get this upgraded capability.\n\n1658\n01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:02,740\nThey have inside the bag, have an adapter\nthat you can plug right into the phone and\n\n1659\n01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:03,780\nit will keep it charged.\n\n1660\n01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:05,390\nBecause it has an external battery or\n\n1661\n01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:08,070\nyou can just plug it into\nthe wall if you want.\n\n1662\n01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:14,090\nSeal it up and what happens is, is that\nit keeps it charged, keeps it running,\n\n1663\n01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:19,610\nbut it will still be\nradiologically isolated.\n\n1664\n01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:23,401\nSo you don't have to worry about\nanything tampering with the thing.\n\n1665\n01:33:23,401 --> 01:33:26,065\nAnd, yeah James,\nI know these things are expensive.\n\n1666\n01:33:26,065 --> 01:33:26,866\nThat's one of the down sides.\n\n1667\n01:33:26,866 --> 01:33:30,655\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This isn't the only quality of this\n\n1668\n01:33:30,655 --> 01:33:31,915\ntype of bag.\n\n1669\n01:33:31,915 --> 01:33:34,515\n>> Yeah.\n>> They have different sizes of it,\n\n1670\n01:33:34,515 --> 01:33:35,640\ndifferent abilities.\n\n1671\n01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:40,380\nIf you're gonna get one that has\nthe adapter that you plug in and\n\n1672\n01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:44,010\nkeeps it charged up,\nexpect to have to pay more.\n\n1673\n01:33:44,010 --> 01:33:46,490\n>> Like on their website they\nhave Featured on CSI Cyber,\n\n1674\n01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:49,060\nthat new CSI show that out now.\n\n1675\n01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:52,600\n[LAUGH] And for that right there,\nyou're gonna pay another $20 for that.\n\n1676\n01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,610\nBut those are ones that have power,\nthey are reusable too, so\n\n1677\n01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:56,720\nthat's something to keep in mind.\n\n1678\n01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,790\nThis isn't a disposable type product.\n\n1679\n01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:03,190\nSo it's an investment, but\nif you need them, you gotta have them.\n\n1680\n01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:06,560\nAnd, it's something that hopefully,\nwill be used more than once so\n\n1681\n01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,150\nmaybe we can offset those costs.\n\n1682\n01:34:08,150 --> 01:34:11,690\n>> Yeah and more likely it is\ngonna be used more than once.\n\n1683\n01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:13,520\nThey're not designed to be disposable,\n\n1684\n01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,770\nthey're designed to be something\nthat you do keep reusing.\n\n1685\n01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:21,110\nLike as you go through your case and\n\n1686\n01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:25,720\nyou get rid of old equipment and\nbring old evidence and return it and\n\n1687\n01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:28,230\nbring new stuff in,\nyou're gonna reuse these things.\n\n1688\n01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:29,920\nThing is,\nyou're gonna have several of these things,\n\n1689\n01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,870\nyou never know how many you might have.\n\n1690\n01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:36,880\nYou might have to have several\nbecause you might go into a scene and\n\n1691\n01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,740\nhave a handful of cellphones there\nthat need to be investigated.\n\n1692\n01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:43,570\nYou can't throw those all in to one bag.\n\n1693\n01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:45,670\nBecause you have to say okay,\nthat's this device.\n\n1694\n01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:48,760\nYou seal that bag up,\nput the label on it and say, or\n\n1695\n01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:52,630\nput the fold up piece of paper with\nthe name on it and seal it and say,\n\n1696\n01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:55,770\nthat's this device and this is this\ndevice in this bag and this bag.\n\n1697\n01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:58,040\nYou can't have them all\njumbled in together.\n\n1698\n01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,900\n>> For evidentiary reasons as well as I\ndon't want those two devices communicating\n\n1699\n01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:03,230\nwith each other potentially.\n\n1700\n01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:04,500\n>> Yeah, you're absolutely right.\n\n1701\n01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,294\nThat could be another potential issue.\n\n1702\n01:35:06,294 --> 01:35:09,210\nSo, you're just going to\nseal something up in there.\n\n1703\n01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:10,750\nSo you could be looking\nat getting a dozen,\n\n1704\n01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:12,740\na couple dozen of these things maybe.\n\n1705\n01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,980\n>> Get some tin foil and\nwrap the phone up.\n\n1706\n01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:15,570\nThat should work.\n\n1707\n01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:17,740\n>> Yeah.\nGo and do that, that's not a problem.\n\n1708\n01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:18,640\n>> I'm kidding.\n\n1709\n01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:21,350\n>> Just bring your own microwave and\nshove them in there.\n\n1710\n01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:25,910\nAnd so, but that's something that\nyou do have of available to you.\n\n1711\n01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:28,770\nAnd considering the way\nthings are now a days,\n\n1712\n01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:31,465\nthey're gonna need to\nhave something like that.\n\n1713\n01:35:31,465 --> 01:35:34,790\nAnd it's not something\nthat's really unfamiliar.\n\n1714\n01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:37,320\nMost people are either now,\nI shouldn't say most people, but\n\n1715\n01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,815\nit's not something that's\nunfamiliar nowadays as concept.\n\n1716\n01:35:39,815 --> 01:35:42,120\nCuz people have the same type\nof things they're using for\n\n1717\n01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:48,000\ntheir passports because the RFID chips.\n\n1718\n01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,080\nAnd then they're also doing it for\n\n1719\n01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:54,700\njust their own cell phones because\nthey're worried about being tracked.\n\n1720\n01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:58,260\nI know people are literally\nthat paranoid and\n\n1721\n01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,960\nI know one guy that is really paranoid.\n\n1722\n01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,520\nHe says whenever he gets on a flight.\n\n1723\n01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:06,310\nHe puts his cell phone in this\nspecial isolation and it closes up.\n\n1724\n01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:09,500\nHe says that makes me feel really safe and\nsecure.\n\n1725\n01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:12,630\nLike oh yeah, at 35,000 feet you're\ngoing to get a lot of signals and\n\n1726\n01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:14,400\na lot of stuff messing with you.\n\n1727\n01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,250\nYou nut case.\n\n1728\n01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:16,610\nHere's a tin foil hat.\n\n1729\n01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:18,230\n>> I don't wanna tell everybody my secret,\nbut\n\n1730\n01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:19,640\nI do have a line of clothing coming out.\n\n1731\n01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:24,264\nI think men's pants, one of the back\npockets should be a Faraday cage.\n\n1732\n01:36:24,264 --> 01:36:24,963\n>> There you go.\n\n1733\n01:36:24,963 --> 01:36:28,370\n>> [INAUDIBLE] all my credit\ncards that have NFC and\n\n1734\n01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:30,520\nthings like that, good to go right?\n\n1735\n01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:33,059\nSo I bet you see those out\non the market before long.\n\n1736\n01:36:33,059 --> 01:36:36,385\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just remember you heard it here first.\n\n1737\n01:36:36,385 --> 01:36:37,720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right well ladies and\n\n1738\n01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:40,550\ngentlemen that's gonna do it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n1739\n01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:44,270\nWe are out of time, but there's a lot\nmore to go with mobile forensics.\n\n1740\n01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:47,860\nWe want to take a look at the mobile\nforensic process in a little more detail.\n\n1741\n01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:50,270\nWe also want to talk about\nsome of the software.\n\n1742\n01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:55,760\nAnd the hardware that we might be using\nto do our mobile forensics investigation.\n\n1743\n01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:59,060\nBut that's gonna have to wait for\nanother episode.\n\n1744\n01:36:59,060 -->

another episode of ITProTV,\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,420\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,550\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,580\n>> I am doing pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,360\nHow about you?\n>> I am doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,560\nWe are getting ready to do another episode\nof our Digital Forensic Investigator\n\n9\n00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,100\nseries and we're doing part\ntwo of our mobile forensics.\n\n10\n00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,120\nSo today we're getting ready to talk\nabout that mobile forensics process.\n\n11\n00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,590\nIn the previous episode,\n\n12\n00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,580\ntalked a lot about the differences between\ndoing forensics on our, what we would\n\n13\n00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,920\nconsider kind of our standard\ndevices like desktops and laptops.\n\n14\n00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,030\nAnd in this episode we've talked more\nabout the mobile devices like smart phones\n\n15\n00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,700\nand tablets and things like that.\n\n16\n00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,000\nAnd the process does change.\n\n17\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,370\nWe talked about a lot of\nthe different places we can look for\n\n18\n00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,050\nevidence, what types of evidence we might\nexpect to find on these mobile devices.\n\n19\n00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,870\nAnd now I think Sean we wanna kinda\nbreak down the process cause it is\n\n20\n00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,280\na little bit different.\n\n21\n00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,530\n>> Yes there are some similarities and\nthere are some differences between\n\n22\n00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,920\nthe forensic process we're gonna\nsee with mobile devices and\n\n23\n00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,260\nthe ones we see with any traditional\ndevices like you were saying, Mike.\n\n24\n00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,250\nYou just can't treat it the same way.\n\n25\n00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,160\nYou know, some of the stuff you're gonna\nsee here during the forensic process for\n\n26\n00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,290\nmobile devices, they're different.\n\n27\n00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,890\nPrimarily because you know\nof the way that device is.\n\n28\n00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,260\nIt's mobile.\n\n29\n00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,070\nYou're gonna see at least one step in\nhere which may fly counter to what\n\n30\n00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,480\nyou would expect, but\nI assure you that's the way it is.\n\n31\n00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,020\n>> You wouldn't lie to us, right?\n\n32\n00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,950\n>> I wouldn't do that.\n\n33\n00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,069\nI would tell you this is one\nof of those cases where we\n\n34\n00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:11,810\nstressed during CEH,\nwe stressed early during this one.\n\n35\n00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,580\nYou know have a check list.\n\n36\n00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,090\nThis is one of those ones where this\nprocess, I would say you know have\n\n37\n00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,050\na checklist,\ndon't just kind of get used to winging it.\n\n38\n00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,390\nPeople think that's what happens.\n\n39\n00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,470\n>> It's what they see on TV.\n\n40\n00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,950\n>> Yeah, TV they do it.\n\n41\n00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,410\nThey just start poking at stuff and\nit's like, oh, look.\n\n42\n00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,780\nNo, obviously we know by now\nit doesn't even work that way.\n\n43\n00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,290\nBut because of the different types\nof environments we've encountered so\n\n44\n00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,400\nfar and the different ways that\nthe forensic process can proceed,\n\n45\n00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,680\nthis can be one of the unusual ones.\n\n46\n00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,635\nYou're gonna be using some new procedures\nand some new equipment, even, that we're\n\n47\n00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:57,820\ngonna see later on to accomplish the whole\nprocess of doing global forensics.\n\n48\n00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,337\nSo pretty interesting stuff, really.\n\n49\n00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:00,995\n>> Nice.\n\n50\n00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:03,260\nAll right, so we get an idea.\n\n51\n00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,070\nWe can probably figure that by the type of\ndevice, there's gotta be some differences.\n\n52\n00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,170\nAnd the way we handle it.\n\n53\n00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,040\nAnd it really starts at the very beginning\nright before we even start looking for\n\n54\n00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,110\nevidence, just the way we collect\nit is gonna be different.\n\n55\n00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,624\nSo where do we get in that pre\ninvestigation phase where do\n\n56\n00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:22,980\nthe differences start there, Sean.\n\n57\n00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,020\n>> Yeah, so there is actually a phase or\na step here that you can call your pre\n\n58\n00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,320\ninvestigation that you have\nto get some stuff ready.\n\n59\n00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,300\nYou know first one we have is kind of\nsomething that fits in with the other\n\n60\n00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,430\ndevices and other environments\nis a system alive or dead.\n\n61\n00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,140\nIs it something that is powered on or\nis it powered off?\n\n62\n00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,990\nYou know that's gonna make a tremendous\ndifference you know between what you do.\n\n63\n00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,130\nYou know at that point.\n\n64\n00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,850\nYou know make that determination.\n\n65\n00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,510\nIs that device still powered on and\nstill functioning?\n\n66\n00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,080\nOr has it been turned completely off.\n\n67\n00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,000\nSo once you make that determination\n\n68\n00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,500\nwe can start figuring out\nwhich way we want to go.\n\n69\n00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,240\nYou know the live one would be.\n\n70\n00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,130\nYou can figure out they were\ngonna look at stuff like imaging.\n\n71\n00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,480\nAnd how do we keep power to it.\n\n72\n00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,190\nThose are gonna be some of\nthe concerns with the dead device or\n\n73\n00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,720\npowered off device.\n\n74\n00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,812\nThat device it's gonna be a different\nprocess without the imaging at that point.\n\n75\n00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:24,330\nIt's gonna be different\nevidence collecting, and\n\n76\n00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,445\ndifferent steps that are taken afterwards.\n\n77\n00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:27,170\n>> Yeah, and\n\n78\n00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,820\nwhen you get that device, when you're\npicking up that device the first thing\n\n79\n00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,970\nyou've got to do like you said is\ndetermine whether it is live or dead.\n\n80\n00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,000\nAnd remember with phones,\nit is kind of different.\n\n81\n00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,480\nSome of these devices you might have to.\n\n82\n00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,930\nTry to wake it up because it\nmight look like it's off, but\n\n83\n00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,020\nit's not technically powered off,\nit's in that sleep mode.\n\n84\n00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,660\n>> Yeah, a lot of the newer phones,\nthey have a light or\n\n85\n00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,310\nsomething on them,\na little LED that will tell you that, and\n\n86\n00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,880\nsometimes you can kind of get\nthe feeling if it's on or off.\n\n87\n00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,660\nI can even tell you the tricky part with\nthis is that when you encounter a device,\n\n88\n00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,940\nif that mobile device is just\nsitting on someone's desk,\n\n89\n00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,280\nyou're supposed to leave\nthe crime scene as is, right?\n\n90\n00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,900\n>> Right.\n\n91\n00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,990\n>> So now I'm telling you if I've got my\ngood old mobile device sitting over here\n\n92\n00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,750\nand it's sitting here on this desk.\n\n93\n00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,079\nIf the screen's not on or anything,\n\n94\n00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,324\nhow do I determine that\nthat device is actually on.\n\n95\n00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,701\nI'm not supposed to pick the thing up and\n\n96\n00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,250\ngo okay let me start\npushing buttons on that.\n\n97\n00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,070\n>> Start pushing buttons and yeah.\n\n98\n00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,070\nThat's tampering with the scene,\n\n99\n00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,760\nso you're gonna need to make that\ndetermination at some point.\n\n100\n00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,960\nThat can be rather challenging,\nif I told you to do that, you know,\n\n101\n00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,410\nscreen's off on my device and everything,\nso I'd just leave it there and on or off.\n\n102\n00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,450\n>> Some of these phones nowadays,\nthey get that,\n\n103\n00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,460\nI think yours might have\nthat gyro in there.\n\n104\n00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,230\nDetects motion.\n\n105\n00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> And the screen kind of wakes up and\n\n106\n00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:49,980\ncomes to the lock screen.\n\n107\n00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,400\nMy Iphone for example though,\ndoes not do that.\n\n108\n00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,610\nYou pick it up and you can't really tell\nif that thing is on or off without maybe\n\n109\n00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,530\nclicking on that home button to see\nif it goes to the lock screen or not.\n\n110\n00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,140\nSo it can be tricky, right?\n\n111\n00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,890\n>> Yes, it can definitely be tricky.\n\n112\n00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,730\nSometimes you'll just see they have an app\nor something running that actually leaves\n\n113\n00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,730\nthe screen on, so\nthat may be a benefit to you.\n\n114\n00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,670\nSometimes they have that feature turned\non where it does leave the light on.\n\n115\n00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:24,130\nWith mine I've got the option\nof leaving a little\n\n116\n00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,010\nlight on up top, and it will change colors\ndepending on what's going on in the phone,\n\n117\n00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,010\nand it does have one that will\ntell me if the phone is on.\n\n118\n00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,310\nBut, you can turn those features off, and\non my phone, I turn that feature off,\n\n119\n00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,410\nthat one you were talking about,\nmoving it and it comes on, that's off too.\n\n120\n00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,690\nSo you won't be able to do\nit as easily with mine, so\n\n121\n00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,670\nthat's gonna pose a challenge.\n\n122\n00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,130\nBut it's not insurmountable.\n\n123\n00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,930\n>> Yeah, luckily enough it really you know\nmost of the time you think about it if you\n\n124\n00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,500\ntook my phone and you hit a button on\nthere it's gonna wake up the screen and\n\n125\n00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,220\ngive you the option to try to log on or\nnot but it's really not accessing\n\n126\n00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,090\nthe phone or making any modification\nat that point, well we hope not so.\n\n127\n00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,710\nNot the end of the world I mean I do have\nto decide if it’s on or off somehow so.\n\n128\n00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,550\n>> Yes, that’s the thing, you’re gonna\nhave to make that determination at some\n\n129\n00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,770\npoint but if you feel like making\nthat determination might require you.\n\n130\n00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,880\nMoving the device around.\n\n131\n00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,770\nThen there's other things that\nyou're gonna want to do first.\n\n132\n00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,340\nAnd you know,\n\n133\n00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,050\nsome of you out there in the audience\nmay already know what that step is.\n\n134\n00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,130\nAnd if you do, good on you.\n\n135\n00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,600\nWe'll talk about what that could be first.\n\n136\n00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,990\nBut That's one of the things that\nyou've gotta determine up front.\n\n137\n00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,180\nWell, you know, is the device on or off?\n\n138\n00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,570\nLive or dead, if you wanna call it that.\n\n139\n00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,550\nAll right.\n>> So once we've got this device, and\n\n140\n00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,410\nlet's see we determine\nthat it is a live device.\n\n141\n00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,199\nSo, here I am,\nI got this phone, and it's on.\n\n142\n00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,942\nSo, what do I need to do?\n\n143\n00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:53,437\nI need to make sure that nothing is being\nchanged, nothing is being modified.\n\n144\n00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:54,144\nRight?\n\n145\n00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:54,666\nYes.\n\n146\n00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,851\n>> And that nobody's maybe accessing\nthat device from some other location, or\n\n147\n00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:59,870\nit's talking to some other device?\n\n148\n00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:05,810\n>> Yes, that's another big concern as\nwe mentioned in our Part 1 of this,\n\n149\n00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,070\nis that those devices,\nall the different ways they can connect.\n\n150\n00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,490\nWe've got Bluetooth,\nwe got cellular, we got WiFi, and\n\n151\n00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,180\nwe have NFC, we've got those four.\n\n152\n00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,970\nAnd so,\nat the very least we've got those four.\n\n153\n00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,980\nThat's not including the fact that\nthey may have that thing actually\n\n154\n00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,220\nplugged into a cradle that's\nplugged into their system, so\n\n155\n00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,160\nthat adds a fifth way, potentially, to it.\n\n156\n00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,590\nSo if we're just talking about\nthe wireless part of it, then we have to\n\n157\n00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,910\nfigure out how to turn those interfaces\noff so there's no changes being made.\n\n158\n00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,938\nThat is a very, very big deal\nwhen you're going through this,\n\n159\n00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:47,897\nbecause you can change a lot on\na phone just through wireless.\n\n160\n00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:55,310\nI mean heck, in CEH we were talking about\nand showing how to do Bluetooth hacking.\n\n161\n00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,450\nAnd so you can do that from\nquite a substantial distance.\n\n162\n00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,905\n>> Yeah, with the right equipment,\nabsolutely.\n\n163\n00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:02,629\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you got the right equipment.\n\n164\n00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,343\n>> With your phone pad you had or\nwhatever, yeah.\n\n165\n00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,970\n>> Yeah exactly,\nyou can do it from quite a distance.\n\n166\n00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,170\nNot to mention with the cell network,\n\n167\n00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,070\nsomeone suspects that you've got\nthat device, the owner of it.\n\n168\n00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,440\nThey could make a couple calls, and\n\n169\n00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,430\nsend a signal out to that device and\nget it wiped.\n\n170\n00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,990\nAnd now where's your evidence?\n\n171\n00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,902\nYou're stuck, that's a paperweight now.\n\n172\n00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,330\n>> It's gone, gone.\n\n173\n00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,790\nSo maybe this is when one of those\n\n174\n00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,830\nblack hole bags that we were talking\nabout in our previous episode,\n\n175\n00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,965\none of those bags with the Faraday\ncage built into it, comes into play.\n\n176\n00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:36,365\n>> Yeah, that would be something\nthat you do right up front.\n\n177\n00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:40,370\nBecause, think about this for\n\n178\n00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,620\na second, we're saying shut\noff the wireless interface.\n\n179\n00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,380\nOkay, that doesn't sound difficult, right?\n\n180\n00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,330\nJust like shut it off.\n\n181\n00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,020\nOkay, you'll figure out how to do that.\n\n182\n00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,890\nWhat if the person's passworded the phone?\n\n183\n00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,184\n>> Most likely it's password protected,\na bare minimum, a four digit PIN or\n\n184\n00:09:58,184 --> 00:09:59,187\nsomething like that.\n\n185\n00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:01,320\nAnd I can't just sit there\nat the crime scene and\n\n186\n00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,310\nstart trying to guess passwords and\neverything like that.\n\n187\n00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,730\nSo I can't access the settings of\nthe page to turn off the WiFi.\n\n188\n00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,500\n>> Yeah so-\n>> Or the Bluetooth or what have you.\n\n189\n00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,952\n>> Yeah, so really consider that\nsort of situation, is that,\n\n190\n00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:17,128\noh, turn this stuff off and\ndo this, and you're not.\n\n191\n00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:21,610\nMost people, or there's a good number\nof people, I shouldn't say most, but\n\n192\n00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,520\nthere's a lot of people do\npassword their phones or\n\n193\n00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,290\ndo something on it to keep it\nfrom just being easily accessed.\n\n194\n00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,575\nNot everyone does that,\nI'm well aware of that.\n\n195\n00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:37,394\nI've got several people in my life\nthat I look at and they're like, oh,\n\n196\n00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:40,871\nI don't need to password,\nI'm like, yeah you do.\n\n197\n00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:41,707\n>> You really do.\n\n198\n00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,907\n>> I just wanna go into their phone and\njust change a bunch of stuff and\n\n199\n00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:44,951\ndelete stuff to prove a point.\n\n200\n00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:47,743\n>> In a lot of organizations, if you're\ngonna connect that device to their\n\n201\n00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:50,760\nnetwork, they're gonna require\nthat you password-protect it.\n\n202\n00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,171\nSo I guess when we say turn off or\nshut off wireless interfaces,\n\n203\n00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:56,370\nwe don't necessarily mean necessarily\nmean shut them off through the interface.\n\n204\n00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,070\nJust somehow prevent them,\nwhich very well could be a Faraday bag.\n\n205\n00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,450\nWhich is what Ben in our\nchat room was asking.\n\n206\n00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,770\nShould we evidence bag it\nbefore pressing buttons?\n\n207\n00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,977\nAnd probably a good idea?\n\n208\n00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:11,709\n>> It wouldn't be a bad idea to put it\nin an evidence bag as soon as you've\n\n209\n00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,271\ndone a couple things.\n\n210\n00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:18,010\nIt wouldn't be a bad idea to put\nin an evidence bag if you can't\n\n211\n00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,330\nshut off the wireless or anything on it.\n\n212\n00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:26,076\nOr if you can't shut it off, or\nyou can't get much off the device in its\n\n213\n00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:30,754\ncurrent state, it should go in\nan evidence bag almost immediately.\n\n214\n00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:34,269\nLike I said,\nafter you've done some procedural stuff,\n\n215\n00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:37,354\nthere's some procedures\nthat do need to be done.\n\n216\n00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:43,406\nAnd once we get those out of the way,\nwhich should only take you a few moments,\n\n217\n00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:48,547\nthen good, you should tag it,\nbag it, and get it all contained.\n\n218\n00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:52,196\n>> All right, so let's talk about what are\nthese procedures then that I need to do\n\n219\n00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:55,036\nbefore I think about dropping\nit in one of them Faraday bags?\n\n220\n00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:58,646\n>> One of the first things you should\ndo goes back to something that's been\n\n221\n00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:01,793\na recurring theme through all\nthe investigative processes.\n\n222\n00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:06,715\nIs take note of what the scene is, and\nspecifically when you talk about a mobile\n\n223\n00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:11,734\ndevice, it should be taking a picture of\nwhere that mobile device is residing.\n\n224\n00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:16,022\nSo you should grab your camera and\njust take your pictures of the scene,\n\n225\n00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:19,420\ntake your pictures of where\nthat mobile device is.\n\n226\n00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,395\nAnd if you need to, do a quick sketch,\nand then boom, it's in a bag.\n\n227\n00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:23,906\n>> Right.\n\n228\n00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:28,838\n>> And then, if you need to, you could\nconceivably do the stuff that you\n\n229\n00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:33,686\nwere talking about like hitting\nbuttons to see if the thing is live or\n\n230\n00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,460\nanything like that,\nto keep everything safe.\n\n231\n00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,770\nBut yeah, it should go in a bag very\nearly on, but you don't just go over and\n\n232\n00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,420\ngrab it and shove it in a bag.\n\n233\n00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,900\nBecause now, where was it?\n\n234\n00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,252\n>> It's not a race into the crime scene,\nto see if I can get to it first,\n\n235\n00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:49,007\nand throw it in a bag?\n\n236\n00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:49,576\nI win!\n\n237\n00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:50,133\nWoo-hoo!\n\n238\n00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,550\n>> Yeah, yeah, don't do that.\n\n239\n00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:58,140\nThat's gonna lead you down a very\nbad road, so we're gonna avoid that.\n\n240\n00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,030\n>> All right, so we walk into a crime\nscene, and phone or not, one of the first\n\n241\n00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,200\nthings we did was, if we're investigating\na scene, is document the scene, right?\n\n242\n00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,070\nSo we're gonna take photographs\nof everything, sketch things out,\n\n243\n00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,280\ngetting locations, cables, whether\nthat phone is attached to anything,\n\n244\n00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,320\nwhether it's sitting in a cradle.\n\n245\n00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,380\nWhatever the case may be, just document\neverything well before you touch anything.\n\n246\n00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,080\nThat way you can always go back and\nrecreate that scene if necessary,\n\n247\n00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,770\nor provide evidence of where\nthe phone was when you found it,\n\n248\n00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,450\nif necessary or what have you.\n\n249\n00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,410\nSo we document the heck out of it,\nphotographs, drawings, or sketches.\n\n250\n00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,520\nAnd then we put it in one of them bags,\n\n251\n00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,280\nto basically separate that device\nfrom the rest of the world.\n\n252\n00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,835\n>> Yeah, to contain it and\nkeep it in its own sealed environment.\n\n253\n00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:48,275\nSomething to throw in here, by the way,\nsince I had mentioned cradle,\n\n254\n00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:50,140\nyou just mentioned cradle again.\n\n255\n00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,835\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n256\n00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:55,365\n>> If this thing is in a cradle\nthat's plugged into the computer,\n\n257\n00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:58,765\none of the standard procedures is to take\nthe cradle and everything with it, and\n\n258\n00:13:58,765 --> 00:13:59,575\nput it in there.\n\n259\n00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:02,925\nCuz sometimes pulling it in and out of\nthe cradle can make changes to the device.\n\n260\n00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,485\n>> Yeah, true.\n\n261\n00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:06,897\n>> So if that's the case,\njust for safety's sake,\n\n262\n00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:09,834\nthe whole thing gets bagged and isolated.\n\n263\n00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:14,758\n>> Okay, and then you had mentioned too,\nthat sometimes the phone might be on and\n\n264\n00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:17,580\nlit up, the screen might be active.\n\n265\n00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,170\nSometimes on my phone, or my iPad for\n\n266\n00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,200\nexample, that I'll do some teaching from,\nI've got it to never go to sleep, so\n\n267\n00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,540\nthat in the middle of my training\nthe iPad doesn't shut down.\n\n268\n00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,686\nSo you could do that same thing on\nyour phone so you might walk in and\n\n269\n00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:32,700\nfind it actually displaying something.\n\n270\n00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,440\nOr it could be some app that doesn't\nallow the phone to go into a sleep state,\n\n271\n00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,903\nthat somebody has left running on there so\nthere.\n\n272\n00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:42,510\nSo there could be data on the screen\nitself when I walk up to the phone.\n\n273\n00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,765\n>> Yes and if that's the case, click.\n\n274\n00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:47,580\n>> [LAUGH] Right, document,\ndocument, document.\n\n275\n00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,220\n>> Yeah it's the same thing,\nat this point some of the stuff is,\n\n276\n00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,830\nthere's a few variations let's say,\nfor wireless, but\n\n277\n00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,210\nyou're seeing some crossover with\nthe other scenes we go onto.\n\n278\n00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,919\nIf you see a computer and the screen's on,\nyou take a picture of it.\n\n279\n00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,454\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n280\n00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:07,620\n>> That's standard stuff,\nwhat were they doing or what's going on.\n\n281\n00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,920\nSo same thing with a mobile device\nin this case, is it's on, click.\n\n282\n00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,172\nBut yeah, we do have to,\nafter we've photographed and sketched,\n\n283\n00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,820\nthen it's going in a bag.\n\n284\n00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,290\nSo, a little different there.\n\n285\n00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,620\n>> Now, what if we notice an SD card\nsticking out the side of this thing?\n\n286\n00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,120\nA lot of them, other than Apple,\nwe can actually use removable media and\n\n287\n00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,240\nthings like that.\n\n288\n00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,461\n>> Yeah, if you notice any of those sorts\nof things, and you can't always notice,\n\n289\n00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:31,774\nI'm well aware of that.\n\n290\n00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:36,811\nSome phones you can tell just\nby a quick visual assessment,\n\n291\n00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:43,174\nother ones you have to take off the back\nand stuff like that to really dig in.\n\n292\n00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:47,316\nIf you have to dig into the phone or\nanything to see that, and take the battery\n\n293\n00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:51,814\nout cuz it's underneath the battery or\nsomething, no, you're not doing that.\n\n294\n00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:54,926\nThat's just something that\nis out of the question.\n\n295\n00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:59,280\nBut if you do see any SD cards or\nany memory devices in there,\n\n296\n00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,730\nmake note of them, but do not remove them.\n\n297\n00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,120\nNow's not the time to do that.\n\n298\n00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,560\nThat's gotta be done some place else.\n\n299\n00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,260\n>> Right, because removing it could\ncompromise anything that's on that device,\n\n300\n00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,430\ncould change, could modify it,\nwrite or something like that to it.\n\n301\n00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,560\n>> There could be active data moving\nback and forth on that system too.\n\n302\n00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,550\nYou never know so you just leave it as it\nis until you get it back to the lab and\n\n303\n00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,258\nyou use the right equipment to go and\naccess that.\n\n304\n00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:28,012\n>> So our pre investigation\nthen is gonna involve,\n\n305\n00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:30,170\nthe primary thing is documentation.\n\n306\n00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,400\nTaking photographs,\nlots of photographs of everything.\n\n307\n00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,170\nThe mobile device, and\ncables or cradles or\n\n308\n00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,120\nthings like that,\nremovable media that's around there, and\n\n309\n00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,110\nthen sketching out the scene,\nincluding the screen.\n\n310\n00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,650\nIf the screen is on,\ntaking pictures of that.\n\n311\n00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,740\nAnd then bagging and\ntagging that thing and put.\n\n312\n00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,440\nAnd there are somethings that might change\nthat normal procedure that we have for\n\n313\n00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,410\nour mobile devices.\n\n314\n00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,750\nThere are some extenuating circumstances\nthat might come into play.\n\n315\n00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,690\n>> Yes, there are.\n\n316\n00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,800\nThere are a good number\nof these things and\n\n317\n00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,910\nprecautions that you might wanna\ngo ahead and take note of.\n\n318\n00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,860\nThat might be a little unusual to you.\n\n319\n00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,248\nWe did talk about the cradle situation.\n\n320\n00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:16,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n321\n00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,500\n>> If you have a mobile\ndevice of any sort phone and\n\n322\n00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,330\ni suppose I think some tablets have\nthings that they can put them in.\n\n323\n00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,770\nYou can have those.\n\n324\n00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,790\nIf that's a situation, those go with it.\n\n325\n00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:33,330\nBut that's just part of the whole process.\n\n326\n00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,880\nBut then you get some other stuff.\n\n327\n00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,580\nThere's some other things\nthat could happen.\n\n328\n00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,120\nYou're not always gonna\ninvestigate a scene.\n\n329\n00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,671\nA lot of times you go to a scene, and\na lot of times you may have been assuming\n\n330\n00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:47,581\nthat it is just an office\nenvironment that you're going in to.\n\n331\n00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:49,582\nIt's not always gonna be that way.\n\n332\n00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:52,690\nIt's not always gonna be that\nnice clean pristine environment.\n\n333\n00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,380\nYou could have had someone.\n\n334\n00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,012\nYou could be called in to do a forensic\ninvestigation for someone that was maybe,\n\n335\n00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:03,029\nI don't know, had broken into a house or\nwas running from the police or\n\n336\n00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:07,728\nsomething like that, and somewhere along\nthe way, that device either fell out of\n\n337\n00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:12,327\ntheir pocket, or they took it because\nthey had something incriminating on it.\n\n338\n00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:13,739\nTook it and just flung it.\n\n339\n00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:15,900\n>> Chucked it, yeah.\n\n340\n00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,010\n>> Right down the sewer drain,\nguess where we're going?\n\n341\n00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,340\n>> Yeah [LAUGH] it could have\nvery well ended up there.\n\n342\n00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,140\nNot the most pleasant thing but\nyou know you gotta do what you gotta do.\n\n343\n00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,480\nThat's why you're gonna make\nthe big bucks saw on there,\n\n344\n00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,510\nwell hopefully making the big bucks.\n\n345\n00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,910\nBut what it lands in\ncould be a big problem.\n\n346\n00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,035\nSpecifically if we are talking water.\n\n347\n00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,360\nYou know you would expect water.\n\n348\n00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,540\nI should say it this way, normally human\nbehavior is if you drop that thing,\n\n349\n00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,430\na mobile device in water, oh my God,\nand they're shaking it out and\n\n350\n00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,630\ndoing all this stuff and everything\nwith it, is to get it out of water.\n\n351\n00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,410\nWell, any electronic device out\nof water as quickly as possible.\n\n352\n00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,200\nYou don't do that if you're\ninvestigating this as a crime scene,\n\n353\n00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,240\nwhat you do is you're gonna get a bag,\nyou're gonna fill that bag with water, and\n\n354\n00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,480\nthen you're gonna put that device in\nthat bag and keep it submerged in water\n\n355\n00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,370\nuntil you get it back to where you\ncan deal with it appropriately.\n\n356\n00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:17,390\nAnd that's because if you take\nit out of that water to put\n\n357\n00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,390\nit in a bag, there's a possibility\nthat you could cause,\n\n358\n00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,540\nit sounds funny, shorts or other things\nin there just by removing from that.\n\n359\n00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,630\nSo whatever happened to\nthe phone when it was in there.\n\n360\n00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,210\nIf it already shorted out in the water or\nit hasn't shorted out.\n\n361\n00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,990\nWe will still keep it submerged\nin that water until we\n\n362\n00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,850\nmake the next level of\ndetermination on it.\n\n363\n00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,810\n>> Because by pulling it out and\ntouching a button,\n\n364\n00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,300\nthat could cause a circuit to complete.\n\n365\n00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,280\nAnd if there is moisture on\nthe circuits it could destroy it.\n\n366\n00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,790\nIf I just left it in the water and\ndidn't touch any buttons.\n\n367\n00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,595\nIt actually might survive that.\n\n368\n00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:55,020\n>> Yeah, there actually is a possibility,\nthat could be the case.\n\n369\n00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,550\n>> So usually live in the field, it is\nnot the place to make that determination.\n\n370\n00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,200\n>> Yeah, you never know.\n\n371\n00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,950\nHow many people do you know that\nhave dropped their phone in water.\n\n372\n00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,710\nOr something like that.\n\n373\n00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,330\nMaybe some of you have done that.\n\n374\n00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,202\nAnd there's all these special things that\npeople do and there's a good percentage\n\n375\n00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:14,412\nof the time where people get\ntheir phones out of water.\n\n376\n00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:15,160\nThat's it.\n\n377\n00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,725\n>> Right.\n>> It's dead.\n\n378\n00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:18,082\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n379\n00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:20,455\n>> So just don't do anything with it.\n\n380\n00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:21,240\n>> Yeah.\n\n381\n00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,740\n>> Anything special with it,\nother than you note where it is, and\n\n382\n00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,340\nyou fill a bag with water, and\nit goes in there, and you seal it up.\n\n383\n00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,920\nIf you can't put it in a bag, if you have\na bag that isn't gonna hold the water\n\n384\n00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,135\nin there,\nthen you can easily get a some container,\n\n385\n00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:41,235\nlike a Tupperware container, something\nlike that, or a Rubbermaid container,\n\n386\n00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:47,815\nyou see those little things that you,\nI know here in the states Rubbermaid\n\n387\n00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:52,360\nsells them at all the targets, and\nthe grocery stores and stuff like that.\n\n388\n00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,280\nThose ones would not be a bad\nidea to keep in your kit.\n\n389\n00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,640\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's a simple thing.\n\n390\n00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,240\nDon't go buy any fancy things like that.\n\n391\n00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,110\nYou don't need it.\n\n392\n00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,460\nKeep a few of those in your\nkit cause situations like\n\n393\n00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,010\nthis\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n394\n00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,830\n>> May very well happen.\n\n395\n00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,610\nThose containers are good for\nholding hard drives.\n\n396\n00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,750\nAnd stuff like that.\n\n397\n00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,800\nAnd all you gotta do in this case\nis if a phone's in the water,\n\n398\n00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,850\nfill that container up with water.\n\n399\n00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,920\nKeep it in there.\n\n400\n00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,660\nAnd just put the phone in it,\nput the top on it, and\n\n401\n00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,090\nthen wrap some of that duck tape or\nsomething around it.\n\n402\n00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,400\nAnd then all you gotta do is sign it and\n\n403\n00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,020\ndate it with your stuff\nto show it was sealed up.\n\n404\n00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,720\nAnd collect it from the scene\nappropriately and off it goes.\n\n405\n00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,410\n>> I had a question what so we know\nabout computers being accessed remotely?\n\n406\n00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,040\nAnd I think we mentioned that the other\nday when we were talking about computers\n\n407\n00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,800\nwe want to disconnect that network, right?\n\n408\n00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,620\nWe leave the system on if it’s on.\n\n409\n00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,970\nWe leave it off when it's off, but\nif it's remotely being accessed or\n\n410\n00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,250\nwe think there's a possibility we do\ndisconnect those networks, right?.\n\n411\n00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,530\n>> Yeah that would be\nan extenuating circumstances.\n\n412\n00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,910\nIn that case you would not that\nit is being accessed remotely and\n\n413\n00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,980\nthen you would go into your containment\nprocedures where you would unplug it or\n\n414\n00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,400\nmaybe not unplug it.\n\n415\n00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,800\nOr maybe talk to the IT\nperson to block it.\n\n416\n00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,550\nYou know, some place else.\n\n417\n00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,960\nSo you don't have to\npull anything out of it.\n\n418\n00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,050\nBut yes you do have to do\nsomething to stop that.\n\n419\n00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,600\n>> You do want to stop that, because\nthat could be evidence being destroyed.\n\n420\n00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,720\nAs we sit here and watch.\n\n421\n00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,580\nAnd the other question, what if\nthe liquid is corrosive, like salt water?\n\n422\n00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,990\nSo if we are gonna fill\nthis bag with water,\n\n423\n00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,620\nwe probably want to use the same type\nof liquid we found the device in.\n\n424\n00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,620\nSo we found it in pool water, then\nwhen you fill it back with pool water.\n\n425\n00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,571\nIs that kinda the way it goes?\n\n426\n00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:26,180\n>> Yeah, it would be the same thing.\n\n427\n00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:32,160\nThis type of question kind of is along the\nsame lines of, you've seen when they do,\n\n428\n00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,540\nwell, the one I think of is when\nthey brought up the HMS Hunley,\n\n429\n00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,030\nthat sub from the civil war.\n\n430\n00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,490\nThey, when they brought that one up, and\nthis isn't the only place they've done it,\n\n431\n00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,780\nwhen they brought it up, they bring it up\nout of the water, and then they submerge\n\n432\n00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,340\nthe whole thing immediately again in\nsaltwater, it still is in saltwater,\n\n433\n00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,380\nand they've got some process of leaching\nout the salts and everything on it, cuz if\n\n434\n00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,440\nthey took it out and just left it in open\nair, it's gonna corrode really quickly.\n\n435\n00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,060\nSo they kept it in there because\neverything is stabilized on both sides,\n\n436\n00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,210\nin the metal and in this.\n\n437\n00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,750\nIt would be the same case here.\n\n438\n00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:16,320\nIt was in salt water, put that same\nwater in there and keep it submerged.\n\n439\n00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,780\nHopefully it's not gonna\nbe in there that long.\n\n440\n00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,550\n>> Right.\n>> Where it's gonna cause really,\n\n441\n00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,900\nreally substantial damage.\n\n442\n00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,186\nIt should be a case of you take it,\nit goes back to the lab,\n\n443\n00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:29,144\nand that will be one of\nthe first things processed.\n\n444\n00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:30,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> And evaluated.\n\n445\n00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,950\n>> Yeah exactly that might change\nthe priority, in fact that\n\n446\n00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,530\npiece of equipment might be rushed back\nto the lab outside of everything else.\n\n447\n00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,947\nJust to get that process started on there\nbut I like to thing of it like if that\n\n448\n00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:43,659\nphone's in something corrosive, there\nis a chemical reaction going on there.\n\n449\n00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:46,086\nBut if I take it out of\nthat corrosive material,\n\n450\n00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:50,347\nnow I've changed the chemicals that are\ninvolved and I've changed the reaction.\n\n451\n00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,762\nIt could be a completely different\nreaction going on as you say.\n\n452\n00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:55,366\nAnd you take it out of the saltwater,\nyou expose it to air, and\n\n453\n00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:56,686\nnow it starts rusting faster.\n\n454\n00:23:56,686 --> 00:24:01,172\nSo you really wanna just maintain that\nstate, cuz we always talk about preserving\n\n455\n00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:05,280\nthe scene, and that would include\nthe surroundings on that phone as well.\n\n456\n00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,620\nIf it was found in a fish\ntank of saltwater,\n\n457\n00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,780\nI'd wanna grab some of that saltwater,\nand keep that phone in the state that\n\n458\n00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,889\nI found it until I can get it back to\nthe lab and do a thorough investigation.\n\n459\n00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:19,040\nSo that means bringing\nthe saltwater with me, most likely.\n\n460\n00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,014\n>> Yes, so that standard thing is,\n\n461\n00:24:21,014 --> 00:24:25,480\nthat’s one of the unusual ones\nwith mobile devices, by the way.\n\n462\n00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,250\nIf you haven’t picked up on it, we don’t\ndo that with anything else, really.\n\n463\n00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,770\n>> Normally you don’t dump\nthe desktop in a toilet.\n\n464\n00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,280\nBut the bad guys think, I’m gonna take\nmy phone and throw it in the toilet, or\n\n465\n00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,196\nthrow it in the fish tank, or\ntoss it in the pond on the way by, and\n\n466\n00:24:38,196 --> 00:24:40,490\nnobody's gonna be able to\nget anything off of it.\n\n467\n00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,608\n>> Yeah, you never know what state you\nmight find a computer or device or\n\n468\n00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:49,081\nanything in, but mobile is one of those\nones that, yes, people will fling\n\n469\n00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:53,905\nthose things out of cars if they think\nthey're being pursued or something.\n\n470\n00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:56,395\nI mean, heck,\nif you watch the show here Cops,\n\n471\n00:24:56,395 --> 00:25:01,885\nthere's been a couple episodes where that\nthing becomes a Frisbee and it just goes.\n\n472\n00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:06,520\nYou'll see people ditch them\nin all sorts of weird places.\n\n473\n00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,467\nHopefully, you don't have anything too,\nhopefully it is a puddle of water, or\n\n474\n00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:16,735\nit's a pool or something like that, it's\nnot something a little more, kind of bad.\n\n475\n00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:18,604\nNot like a-\n>> Big pile of dog poo.\n\n476\n00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:22,145\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, hopefully it's not that.\n\n477\n00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:25,830\nHopefully they didn't drop it down\nan outhouse or something like that.\n\n478\n00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,300\nI would not want to do it.\n\n479\n00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,038\nI'll be like,\njust let the guy off this time.\n\n480\n00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:31,267\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> It wasn't that bad.\n\n481\n00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:35,210\nSo it's like, I picked the wrong job.\n\n482\n00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,961\n>> Right.\n>> But, who knows,\n\n483\n00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:42,030\nthey've found devices in all sorts\nof weird states and situations.\n\n484\n00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:46,581\nBut this is one of those ones where\nthe safest way, grab it, put it in there,\n\n485\n00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:51,350\nand keep it submerged, and then we'll\ngo ahead and deal with it as needed.\n\n486\n00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,022\n>> All right, and then we talked about\nalready, isolate it from radio networks,\n\n487\n00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,375\nisolate it from paired devices.\n\n488\n00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:59,513\nSo,we're really talking about, again,\ngetting it in that Faraday bag, or\n\n489\n00:25:59,513 --> 00:26:02,807\nsome type of Faraday cage, so that it\ncan't communicate with any other devices.\n\n490\n00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:06,867\nWhether it's something that is\ndoing some synchronization,\n\n491\n00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:09,318\nlike their laptop and their phone, or\n\n492\n00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:13,926\nwhether it's radio networks doing\nRF network or something like that.\n\n493\n00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:19,046\n>> Yes, isolate it from radio devices,\nwe've kind of already addressed that\n\n494\n00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:23,848\nwith the Faraday bag, sticking it\nin there, and keeping it isolated.\n\n495\n00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:27,043\nBut this other one is an interesting one,\n\n496\n00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:31,800\nbecause something we mentioned\nin Part 1 is paired devices.\n\n497\n00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,150\nHow do you know what it’s paired with?\n\n498\n00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,240\nCould be paired with the computer,\n\n499\n00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,270\nit could be paired with\na good number of things.\n\n500\n00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,900\nAnd in that case, that’s another way,\n\n501\n00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,830\nthat someone could be,\nsharing information with it.\n\n502\n00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,850\nAnd altering information on it,\n\n503\n00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,520\nwhich is why you want to get that\nin that bag as soon as possible.\n\n504\n00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,360\nBecause you never know what's\nin that environment that\n\n505\n00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,560\nthey could be doing things with.\n\n506\n00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,040\nSo we want to get it out of\nthere as soon as possible.\n\n507\n00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,807\nYou can either, after you photograph and\neverything, move it out of that\n\n508\n00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:06,756\nenvironment and then put it in the bag,\npresumably what you should be doing is\n\n509\n00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:11,178\njust, it's in that environment, it goes\ndirectly in that bag and that's end of it.\n\n510\n00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:12,845\n>> Right.\n>> That's an interesting\n\n511\n00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:16,398\none that Ben brought up, that kind of\nfits in what we just talked about,\n\n512\n00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:18,246\nphone in saltwater lake for months.\n\n513\n00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:22,870\n>> Right, and we're still able to retrieve\nevidence off the phone and prosecute.\n\n514\n00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,751\n>> It says a lot, for\nthe durability of the device and-\n\n515\n00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:26,714\n>> Yeah, it does, right?\n\n516\n00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:30,758\nAnd it shows you that also, it's not like\nI have to, oh my gosh, it's in saltwater.\n\n517\n00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:35,590\nI've gotta immediately pull it out\nbecause I'm going to lose information.\n\n518\n00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,620\nAgain, it shows you where it's okay\nto preserve the state of that device,\n\n519\n00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,730\nbring that corrosive liquid with it.\n\n520\n00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,770\nGet it back to the lab so\nyou can handle it properly.\n\n521\n00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,090\n>> Absolutely.\n\n522\n00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,879\n>> All right, so if we have a process\nthen that we should go through,\n\n523\n00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:51,950\nlike a kind of a procedure,\nyou said, make a check list.\n\n524\n00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,680\nLet's talk about that for a sec.\n\n525\n00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,450\n>> Yeah, this process,\n\n526\n00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,430\nI think we can just mention the phases\npretty quickly at this point.\n\n527\n00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,200\nBecause the phases aren't\n\n528\n00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,280\nreally any different as far as\nthe process of going through the device.\n\n529\n00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,750\nCollecting it, yes.\n\n530\n00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,470\nProcessing it, except for\nthe imaging part and acquisition part,\n\n531\n00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,820\nwhere we're gonna talk about some\nof the tools in another segment.\n\n532\n00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,540\nIt looks the same overall,\nas where you collect it, document, image,\n\n533\n00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,380\nacquire, and report.\n\n534\n00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,030\nYou'll recognize those phases from\nother things that we've done.\n\n535\n00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,630\nWhether we're processing a desktop,\n\n536\n00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:34,800\nwhether we're processing a server,\nit's the same type of process.\n\n537\n00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,150\nWhat changes is how you\ndo that actual process.\n\n538\n00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,960\nWe talked about the collecting and\ndocumenting.\n\n539\n00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,270\nReporting we've touched upon,\n\n540\n00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,910\nwe've got some more stuff talking\nabout reporting later on.\n\n541\n00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:52,220\nThe image and acquire, that's where you\ngotta have some special tools for that.\n\n542\n00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,870\nAnd we've got a segment on that, so\nwe won't worry about that right now.\n\n543\n00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,770\nBut yes, that's the process,\nso you should recognize that.\n\n544\n00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,071\nIt's that pre stuff you do, and\nthose precautionary things that you do\n\n545\n00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:04,226\nwith a mobile device\nthat need to be observed.\n\n546\n00:29:04,226 --> 00:29:08,052\n>> Okay, very good, so that's really\nwhat differentiates that mobile process,\n\n547\n00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:09,809\nis that pre-investigation phase.\n\n548\n00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:14,533\nAnd then the way we go about accessing the\ninformation, and collecting that evidence\n\n549\n00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:18,021\noff of the mobile device once\nwe've secured it back at our lab.\n\n550\n00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:21,260\n>> Yes that would be kind of it.\n\n551\n00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,890\n>> All right, now you got down here,\nobstructed or unobstructed.\n\n552\n00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,130\nWhat are we referring to there?\n\n553\n00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,606\n>> This is something else\nthat could impact it,\n\n554\n00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:34,630\nit's whether the device is\nactually locked or not locked.\n\n555\n00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,460\nThat's something that you\nmay have to deal with.\n\n556\n00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,423\nSo if it's something\nthat's obstructed now,\n\n557\n00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:40,490\nyou've got to do other\nprocedures to get into it.\n\n558\n00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,145\nSo it's something else you may actually\nconsider so I kinda threw that in there.\n\n559\n00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:45,801\n>> So\ntalking about if it's pin protected, or\n\n560\n00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:48,635\npassword protected, or thumbprint\nprotected, or something like that.\n\n561\n00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:52,251\nThat's gonna obviously have to\nbe a part of my investigation,\n\n562\n00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:55,900\ntrying to get into the device,\nso that I can gain access.\n\n563\n00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,167\n>> Yeah, remember a lot of these devices,\nas far as I know,\n\n564\n00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:02,586\nit's every device out there in some way,\nshape, or form.\n\n565\n00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:07,189\nIf you try to, for example, punch the code\ninto it too many times, depending on\n\n566\n00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:11,864\nwhere you're punching in that code,\nlike the unlock code, stuff like that, or\n\n567\n00:30:11,864 --> 00:30:16,058\nthings in at the SIM, after a certain\nnumber of unsuccessful attempts,\n\n568\n00:30:16,058 --> 00:30:18,290\nit can actually permanently lock it.\n\n569\n00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:22,450\nAnd then you've got a real\nproblem at that point.\n\n570\n00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,500\n>> I thought it was always the third try.\n\n571\n00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,836\nI mean, I watch these TV shows.\n\n572\n00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:28,163\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They always guess that PIN on the third\n\n573\n00:30:28,163 --> 00:30:28,878\ntry, every time.\n\n574\n00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:32,233\n>> Yeah, there you, yeah, it's-\n>> It's only three tries.\n\n575\n00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:35,220\n>> Yeah, that's why I can't\ntell you if it's every device,\n\n576\n00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,027\ncuz I always get it on the third try.\n\n577\n00:30:37,027 --> 00:30:37,585\n>> That's right.\n\n578\n00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:42,970\n[LAUGH] All right, and then we also have\nto deal with the provider as well, right?\n\n579\n00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:47,360\nBecause we have different service\nproviders for the mobile devices, and\n\n580\n00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,345\nthat might affect our\ninvestigation as well.\n\n581\n00:30:49,345 --> 00:30:55,610\n>> Yeah, that was something that we\naddressed a little bit yesterday.\n\n582\n00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,460\nBut just to kind of bring it back\nanother fold, when you're doing this\n\n583\n00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,090\nprocess of investigation,\nyou may very well have to involve the ISP,\n\n584\n00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:07,290\nbecause there's gonna be call logs up\nthere, up and above what the phone keeps.\n\n585\n00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,630\nThings they've done over previous months.\n\n586\n00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,670\nThere's gonna be text messages that\ncan be retrieved off the system.\n\n587\n00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,125\nBut remember there's also limitations too,\nthere's a lot of limitations with this.\n\n588\n00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:23,213\nIf you go to the mobile provider and\nsay that, I want to get\n\n589\n00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:30,858\nall the messages from this conversation\nwith this individual at this number.\n\n590\n00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:33,970\nThey'll say, okay, I can give you\nyour side of the conversation, but\n\n591\n00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,810\nI can't give you their\nside of the conversation,\n\n592\n00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,560\nbecause that's stored on that ISP stuff,\nnot on yours.\n\n593\n00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,055\nSo, in that case now you've\ngot two ISPs to deal with.\n\n594\n00:31:43,055 --> 00:31:45,465\n>> Dang it, again,\nthe TV shows are lying to me.\n\n595\n00:31:45,465 --> 00:31:48,392\nBecause they always have this nice\nprintout of the entire conversation,\n\n596\n00:31:48,392 --> 00:31:48,917\nboth sides.\n\n597\n00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:53,572\n>> Yeah, it can be really,\nreally, yeah, tough.\n\n598\n00:31:53,572 --> 00:31:56,707\nSometimes you can extract enough\nof the conversation that you want.\n\n599\n00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,206\nOff of the device itself.\n\n600\n00:31:58,206 --> 00:31:58,717\n>> Oh.\n\n601\n00:31:58,717 --> 00:31:59,645\nThen you might get both sides.\n\n602\n00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:00,446\n>> Yeah, you might.\n\n603\n00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:01,027\n>> At the same time.\n\n604\n00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:02,629\n>> But that's a limited window.\n\n605\n00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,975\nThe device only, has so much memory, so\n\n606\n00:32:04,975 --> 00:32:08,880\nit's not gonna keep everything\nback to when the device was born.\n\n607\n00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,540\nYou know, it's not gonna do that.\n\n608\n00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:16,210\nBut typically, yeah, the service providers\nwill only provide the stuff on your side\n\n609\n00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,970\nof the conversation, cuz they just\ndon't have the stuff on the other side.\n\n610\n00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,190\n>> Yeah, or the rights to it.\n\n611\n00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,480\nThat's another provider, somebody else\nthat I've go to a warrant with, and\n\n612\n00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,240\nget access to that information.\n\n613\n00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,600\n>> Yeah, it becomes a big, big process.\n\n614\n00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,533\nI've had to go through that process,\njust personally.\n\n615\n00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:38,840\nI actually had a stalker for\na little while, because I'm a star.\n\n616\n00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,430\n>> Exactly.\n\n617\n00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,290\n>> They issued me one.\n\n618\n00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,940\nI didn't want one.\n\n619\n00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,620\n>> I can't believe, you caught me, Shawn.\n\n620\n00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,535\n>> Yeah.\n>> Dang it, I thought I was in the clear.\n\n621\n00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:50,570\n>> Yeah, I had someone that was\nstalking me, for a little while.\n\n622\n00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:54,420\nAnd I was putting stuff together,\nbecause what I do here, I'm like,\n\n623\n00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,340\nwell this should be easy for\nme, to prove this.\n\n624\n00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,630\nI was just gathering stuff, and yeah,\n\n625\n00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,150\nthe mess of trying to gather\nstuff from this show.\n\n626\n00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:09,490\nThe text messages and harassment I was\ngetting from her side, was a pain.\n\n627\n00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,806\nHaving to call Verizon, AT&T.\n\n628\n00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:14,640\nAT&T said, hey, it's your account.\n\n629\n00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,950\nYou don't even need to fill\nany legal paperwork out.\n\n630\n00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,200\nTell us what you want, we've got it.\n\n631\n00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,020\nBut on the other side, it was a pain.\n\n632\n00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,210\nYou can get it, but it's a pain.\n\n633\n00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,350\nYou just can't go, get it yourself.\n\n634\n00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,870\nI couldn't go, just request her stuff,\nand say this is the reason.\n\n635\n00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,330\n>> I would have to go to court, and\nfile a whole bunch of other stuff,\n\n636\n00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,640\nif I really needed that in this case,\nbut no, I didn't, so, I had a shot.\n\n637\n00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,113\n>> We're glad you're still with us.\n\n638\n00:33:39,113 --> 00:33:44,180\n[LAUGH] All right, well, ladies and\ngentlemen, looking at the clock,\n\n639\n00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,400\nit's about time for us to take a break,\nso we're gonna step away.\n\n640\n00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,563\nWhen we come back, more mobile forensics,\nso stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n641\n00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:57,064\n[MUSIC]\n\n642\n00:33:57,064 --> 00:33:59,310\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n643\n00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,870\nSo continuing on with our mobile\nforensics, I think now, we're gonna dive\n\n644\n00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,570\ninto a look at some of the software,\nand hardware that can assist us\n\n645\n00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,799\nin our investigation, if our investigation\nleads us into our mobile device.\n\n646\n00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,680\nYeah, that's our last\nlittle bit to do here,\n\n647\n00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,280\nwhen we talk about\nmobile device forensics.\n\n648\n00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,330\nIs you know, what would you use to\nactually complete the investigation,\n\n649\n00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,380\nor carry out the investigation?\n\n650\n00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,310\nAnd there's a wide number of choices,\nand I just want to show you, or\n\n651\n00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,930\nintroduce you to a few here, so you can be\naware of some of the things that are out\n\n652\n00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:37,220\nthere, and what they do, and\ntrust me, there's a lot.\n\n653\n00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,300\nWhen we looked through this,\nwhen I say there's a lot of options, yeah,\n\n654\n00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,600\nthere's definitely a lot of\noptions that you can get.\n\n655\n00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,150\nAnd it's also, if you talking the hardware\nside, definitely nothing's cheap\n\n656\n00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,540\nthere either, so be prepared,\nif you ever have to do this,\n\n657\n00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,940\nthat you're gonna have to find a good\namount of money in your budget.\n\n658\n00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,525\nSo, to do it.\n\n659\n00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:02,140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, in any case we'll go ahead, and\n\n660\n00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,810\njust talk about that.\n\n661\n00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:08,080\nThe different options we\nhave in this segment.\n\n662\n00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,100\n>> All right.\n\n663\n00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,140\nSo what are some of our good\nsoftware choices, we got?\n\n664\n00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,620\nYou've got a handful of them out here, but\n\n665\n00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,940\nsome of the ones I just kind of felt like,\nwere worth mentioning.\n\n666\n00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,790\nThere is one called Oxygen Forensic Suite.\n\n667\n00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,940\nYou can get that at Oxygen Forensics,\ntheir website.\n\n668\n00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,410\nIt's just a piece of software,\nand you know, what it does,\n\n669\n00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:35,520\nis it's something that allows you to,\nif you look at their website,\n\n670\n00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,620\nactually allows you to extract all\nsorts of stuff off of a mobile device.\n\n671\n00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,890\nNow there's no trial version or\nanything up there.\n\n672\n00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,690\nYou actually do have to contact them,\nand they will talk\n\n673\n00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:54,170\nto you about what your needs are, and\nthen give you a trial, if you want.\n\n674\n00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:59,900\nOr, if you do want to buy it, then you\ngotta contact them for that, as well.\n\n675\n00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,690\nBut you can see,\n\n676\n00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,890\nthat this is something that will\nallow you to analyze the software.\n\n677\n00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:05,980\nYou plug it in.\n\n678\n00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,410\nYou have a USB adapter,\nthat you plug into the phone.\n\n679\n00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:12,606\nIt will allow you to extract that stuff\noff the phone, and start analyzing it.\n\n680\n00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:18,680\nIt includes application info Call records,\nall sorts of other data,\n\n681\n00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,738\nthis thing can actually pull off of the\ndevice, without really that much effort.\n\n682\n00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:31,860\nThat's just one option, you have out\nthere is the Oxygen Forensics Suite.\n\n683\n00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,570\nYou can go ahead, and\ntake a look at that one.\n\n684\n00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,820\n>> I posted the wrong link,\nfirst there, so ignore that first link,\n\n685\n00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,165\nwe're coming up to the logic\ncube here later, on here so.\n\n686\n00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:44,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just got out, and what are we,\n\n687\n00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,710\nif I cut and paste on those links, oops.\n\n688\n00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,710\n>> Yeah, no looking ahead.\n\n689\n00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,770\n>> Yeah, no cheating [LAUGH].\n\n690\n00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:55,220\nSo we've got those Oxygen Forensics, but\nyou know, it seems like they're pricey.\n\n691\n00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,250\nBut they really make our job a lot easier.\n\n692\n00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,910\nThere might be other ways to go about\ngetting some of this information off that\n\n693\n00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:05,640\ndevice, but it's gonna be a lot more\nwork involved, a lot more time involved.\n\n694\n00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,170\nSo this is something that I do often,\nas a part of my investigations.\n\n695\n00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,100\nIt might be worth the money to\ninvest in something like this,\n\n696\n00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,900\njust to speed up that process?\n\n697\n00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,500\n>> Yes, if this is something.\n\n698\n00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,280\nThere's something else to thrown there.\n\n699\n00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,240\nI mean, yeah,\nit will speed up your instigation.\n\n700\n00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,720\nIt's expensive, but if you can get\nthrough more cases, that's better for\n\n701\n00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,090\nyou, money wise.\n\n702\n00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:31,860\nAnd it's gonna get you more\nclients if you can do that, and\n\n703\n00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,520\nyou'll be more complete with\nyour evidence gathering.\n\n704\n00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,450\nThe other thing to remember,\nis these Mobile Kit software and\n\n705\n00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:44,650\nthe hardware, may be the only way you're\ngonna get anything off that device, so\n\n706\n00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:49,000\nthat's the other side of it, if you\nintend to investigate this stuff at all,\n\n707\n00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,270\nyou can't just slap something together,\nand say hope for the best.\n\n708\n00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:58,130\nThis may very well be the only way,\n\n709\n00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,210\nthat you're ever gonna\nget stuff off the device.\n\n710\n00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,820\nFor example, there are people that\nare using older phones, still,\n\n711\n00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,780\na lot older phones.\n\n712\n00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,500\nIn fact, I read something in USA Today,\nnot long ago, that they said,\n\n713\n00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,080\nthe new hipster thing, or whatever to do,\nis to use the older phones, because,\n\n714\n00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,600\nthey and this actually kind\nof made me laugh, by the way,\n\n715\n00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,860\nknowing all the stuff that we know now,\nthey said hipsters are using them,\n\n716\n00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,620\nbecause they look retro, and all that, so\nthey're using flip phones all they said.\n\n717\n00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,160\nAlso they said,\nit's also a really good privacy thing,\n\n718\n00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,127\ncause we can't get tracked,\nbut sure you can.\n\n719\n00:38:34,127 --> 00:38:37,040\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> GPS would stop that.\n\n720\n00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,060\nMy friends, that we were sharing\nthis article with pointed out,\n\n721\n00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,260\nthey show a picture of the guy\nthat's actually saying,\n\n722\n00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,650\nthat he uses a flip phone for\nthat purpose.\n\n723\n00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,520\nAnd he's sitting there, driving his car.\n\n724\n00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,070\nHe's holding the phone up,\nand doing his thing.\n\n725\n00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,830\nYou can see on his rear view mirror,\nyou can see in his car.\n\n726\n00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,310\nYou can see the OnStar system.\n\n727\n00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,175\nIt's like, yeah,\nyou're not getting tracked at all.\n\n728\n00:38:57,175 --> 00:39:00,140\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n729\n00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,790\nYou know, hey, I think Ronnie might\nhave just traded his flip phone in.\n\n730\n00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,470\nI'm not sure,\nhe might have gone to a smart phone.\n\n731\n00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,320\nBut I think he wants to\ngo back to a flip phone.\n\n732\n00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,590\nHe is the hipster kind of guy.\n\n733\n00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,990\nSo if someone's got those type\nof old phones, the adaptors\n\n734\n00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:21,760\nthat we have on our current phones,\naren't even close to working with those.\n\n735\n00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,660\nI had it, until maybe 3-4 years ago,\n\n736\n00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,650\nI was using an older phone,\njust cause I liked it.\n\n737\n00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,320\nIt was an old Nokia 6030.\n\n738\n00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,750\nIt didn't even qualify\nas a semi smartphone.\n\n739\n00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,960\nIt was further back than that, but\n\n740\n00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,600\nit had a port on the bottom\nto plug something into.\n\n741\n00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,894\nAnd it looked like one of those\nsmall USB ports, and you look it up,\n\n742\n00:39:45,894 --> 00:39:47,361\nit wasn't a USB port.\n\n743\n00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:51,264\nIt was a special diagnostic port,\nthat you had to have a special cable,\n\n744\n00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,944\nthat you could only get\nin very specific places.\n\n745\n00:39:53,944 --> 00:39:58,732\nSo these kits may be the only way\nyou're gonna get something like\n\n746\n00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:01,400\nthat to even analyze those things.\n\n747\n00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,650\nOtherwise those phones will be\ncompletely out of reach for you.\n\n748\n00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,910\n>> Wow, yeah, that's a good point.\n\n749\n00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,770\nSo you might have to spend the money on\nsomething like this if you're going to\n\n750\n00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,000\ncomplete your investigation.\n\n751\n00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,827\nAll right, so what are some others?\n\n752\n00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:12,870\nWe got that Oxygen Forensic Suite.\n\n753\n00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,660\nWhat's another one we\nmight take a peek at?\n\n754\n00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,220\n>> There's another one and I've just\ngot to give you kind of a peek at it.\n\n755\n00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,200\nI've got this thing on my screen here.\n\n756\n00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:29,330\nThis is one called MOBILedit Forensic\nthat you can go ahead and just grab.\n\n757\n00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:34,000\nWhat this one does is this one's used\nto you know interact with your phone.\n\n758\n00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,620\nYou plug the device into your computer.\n\n759\n00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,120\nAnd then this thing will allow you to\nextract all sorts of data off of it.\n\n760\n00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,620\nYou can see the tools in here will\nactually clone the whole phone,\n\n761\n00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,640\npull videos.\n\n762\n00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,930\nAnd if you want to edit your ringtones\nwhile you're at it, you can do that.\n\n763\n00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,140\nBut it's got those.\n\n764\n00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,320\nIt can basically do a whole\nbackup off the thing.\n\n765\n00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,900\nAll those things that you may want to do\nwith this as part of your investigation.\n\n766\n00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,300\nThe other cool thing about\nthis is that when you load it,\n\n767\n00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:06,440\nit also gives you the option of\nsaying well, I've got a 300 MB\n\n768\n00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:12,570\nbundle of various drivers for\nvarious phones up on the site.\n\n769\n00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,030\nIt'll ask me do you want\nto download these things.\n\n770\n00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,980\nAnd I was like sure.\n\n771\n00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,990\nAnd then all that means that I'm\nsupporting an even wider range of phones.\n\n772\n00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:23,740\nAll I gotta do is have the adapter for\nit, plug it into this, and\n\n773\n00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,630\nit will just go ahead and recognize it.\n\n774\n00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,250\nNow I can start extracting my\ndata from it and doing a backup.\n\n775\n00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,860\nYou can do a backup right there.\n\n776\n00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,510\nThat may be what you need.\n\n777\n00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,730\n>> All right, nice.\n\n778\n00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,590\nI like it.\nAnd that was,\n\n779\n00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,300\nI think a trial version of that one.\n\n780\n00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,580\n>> Yeah this is a trial version\nif you wanna go ahead and try it.\n\n781\n00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,870\nYou could try it on your own phone.\n\n782\n00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:47,790\nPlug your own phone into your system,\nand connect it through this,\n\n783\n00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,760\nand start seeing what these things can do.\n\n784\n00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,556\n>> How many Friday nights\nare you gonna kill for me, Sean?\n\n785\n00:41:53,556 --> 00:41:55,551\nGuess what I'm gonna be doing tonight?\n\n786\n00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:58,325\n[LAUGH]\n>> As many as possible.\n\n787\n00:41:58,325 --> 00:42:00,040\nAnd this is a good thing.\n\n788\n00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,240\nThis is a cool thing.\n\n789\n00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,380\nI would recommend if you're going to\npractice, those of you that are married or\n\n790\n00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,095\nin a relationship, grab your\nsignificant other's phone and do it.\n\n791\n00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:10,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> See what they're up to.\n\n792\n00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:13,205\n>> If you don't wanna be\nmarried on Monday, maybe.\n\n793\n00:42:13,205 --> 00:42:16,540\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm bitter, I'm gonna ruin it for\n\n794\n00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,655\neverybody, that's right.\n\n795\n00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:20,435\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so.\n\n796\n00:42:20,435 --> 00:42:22,315\n>> We'll have to do a marriage counseling,\nand\n\n797\n00:42:22,315 --> 00:42:24,386\nrelationship counseling\ncourse here at IT Pro.\n\n798\n00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:26,062\n[LAUGH]\n>> Stay tuned next week for\n\n799\n00:42:26,062 --> 00:42:28,909\nour new episodes on marriage counseling.\n\n800\n00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:30,807\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nthere's a couple, and\n\n801\n00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:33,028\nI know you've got some more\nyou wanna pop up there.\n\n802\n00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:37,761\nYeah, there's other\noptions we have available,\n\n803\n00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:42,935\nthere's this one that I've\nbrought up called BitPim,\n\n804\n00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,610\nis another really neat one.\n\n805\n00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,910\nIt's got the ability,\nI didn't download and\n\n806\n00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,570\ninstall this one because it's\ngot sufficient screenshots of it\n\n807\n00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,990\nthat we can kinda poke through and\nsee what it's doing.\n\n808\n00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:00,530\nBut you can see it's,\ncompared to something like our MOBILedit,\n\n809\n00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:04,020\nor even our Oxygen Forensic Suite,\nit's a very simplistic interface.\n\n810\n00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,850\nIt looks like the design is for Windows.\n\n811\n00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,310\n>> You can tell it's like it's Windows XP,\n\n812\n00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,980\nwhen you started getting those rounded\ncorners, and those colored buttons, yeah.\n\n813\n00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,960\nI used to call that the Fisher Price\nInterface because it looked like those\n\n814\n00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,360\nlittle toys.\n\n815\n00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,180\nBut you can this things allows\nyou to plug the device in, and\n\n816\n00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,860\nyou can see down there\non the left hand side.\n\n817\n00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:28,520\nYou can see it's allowing you to\nview everything that's on the phone.\n\n818\n00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,432\nYou can browse that phone\nonce it's plugged into this.\n\n819\n00:43:31,432 --> 00:43:32,127\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n820\n00:43:32,127 --> 00:43:38,730\n>> So it's another way of getting in there\nand seeing what's present on that device.\n\n821\n00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:44,640\nYou're gonna see your text messages,\nyour music, calendar, all those things.\n\n822\n00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,700\nSo it's getting a pretty decent amount\nof information off that device,\n\n823\n00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,560\nwhich is really neat.\n\n824\n00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,332\nYou look at stuff like this.\n\n825\n00:43:53,332 --> 00:43:57,750\nIn this screenshot,\nthe retrieving data off the device.\n\n826\n00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:03,541\nYou can see it just analyzing it or\njust extracting it off the device.\n\n827\n00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:06,350\n>> Nice.\n\n828\n00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,620\n>> So some pretty neat things.\n\n829\n00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:12,800\nThere's your it looks like your\ntext messages or no, images.\n\n830\n00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,364\nThat's displaying it while you\nbrowse the file system on there.\n\n831\n00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:18,630\nThis is exactly the type\nof stuff you need.\n\n832\n00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:22,670\nEven if you want to get even further,\nit can It's got a hex viewer in there so\n\n833\n00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:26,590\nif you got a question about something,\nthere you go.\n\n834\n00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:33,810\nWe talked yesterday about the value of\ndoing hex editing or hex viewing at least.\n\n835\n00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,560\nThere you go.\n\n836\n00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,570\nI can actually do a hex view of things.\n\n837\n00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:41,060\nGranted you're gonna have to go through\nand get used to working in hex, and\n\n838\n00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,100\nI recommend you get a hex to decimal or\n\n839\n00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,350\nbinary translator, which is something\nI didn't bring up yesterday.\n\n840\n00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:53,250\nBut you should have that, and those are a\ndime a dozen, you can find those easily.\n\n841\n00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,196\nHeck, you can use Google\nto do that if you want.\n\n842\n00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:58,076\nSo, that is BitPim,\n\n843\n00:44:58,076 --> 00:45:03,516\nyou can download quite easily if you want\n\n844\n00:45:03,516 --> 00:45:08,959\nto try that one out, there's that one.\n\n845\n00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:12,450\nAnd then the other one\ngoing to the next one.\n\n846\n00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:18,220\nJust to mention it,\nis this one is one called SIM Analyzer.\n\n847\n00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:22,730\nWhat this one does is it does just\nlike it says, it will go through and\n\n848\n00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:25,680\nscan your SIM card.\n\n849\n00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,480\nAnd as long as you have an adapter for\nthat SIM card, it will go ahead and\n\n850\n00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,740\nanalyze it, and\nback back stuff up off of it, and\n\n851\n00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,810\nallow you to poke through it.\n\n852\n00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:45,784\nI think this one is really\na fascinating thing, when you look at.\n\n853\n00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:50,040\nIt'll allow you to even to look at SIM\ncards that really aren't even there.\n\n854\n00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,060\nIf you've lost control of it, or you\ndon't have it, or it's not in the phone.\n\n855\n00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,360\nIt can actually figure out a way to\nextract enough stuff off the phone\n\n856\n00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,630\nto be able to recreate\nsome of the stuff in here.\n\n857\n00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:05,208\nSo, it's another pretty cool\none if you need to use this.\n\n858\n00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:07,500\nAnd this isn't the only SIM analyzer,\nby the way.\n\n859\n00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,400\nThey have ones that hardware one where\nyou can just plug the stuff in and\n\n860\n00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,810\nit will start pulling a lot of stuff\nright off the card directly and clone it.\n\n861\n00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,820\n>> Very cool, very cool.\n\n862\n00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,440\nAnd then the last one you got on your\nlist, I was having a little trouble,\n\n863\n00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,875\nwas that another from Paraben?\n\n864\n00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:29,010\n>> Yes, this is another one from Paraben,\nand it's tough to find.\n\n865\n00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:33,720\nYou can go to Paraben's website and\nbrowse through and find it.\n\n866\n00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:39,230\nThe thing with Paraben is they don't\nhave really any good pictures of this\n\n867\n00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,000\non their site.\n\n868\n00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,290\nSo if you go to the mobile\nsection their site,\n\n869\n00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:45,560\nthe forensic section their site,\nthey will have this.\n\n870\n00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,700\nAnd they've got a lot of different\ntools by the way that we haven't even\n\n871\n00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,160\ntouched upon in here.\n\n872\n00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,370\nBut they do cover a lot of\nthings that we do in here.\n\n873\n00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:59,130\nSo I would, if you're just curious,\nyou wanna do, or\n\n874\n00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,530\nyou're looking at purchasing this stuff.\n\n875\n00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:06,300\nYou might check them out because they are\nsomething that has been proven time and\n\n876\n00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,600\ntime again in the courtroom.\n\n877\n00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,600\nYou don't have to use them but\n\n878\n00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,240\nthey're one of the ones that we\ntalked about trusted, reliable,\n\n879\n00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,290\nknown stuff to help bolster the weight\nof your evidence and your examination.\n\n880\n00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,440\nThis would be one of those cases.\n\n881\n00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,090\n>> That link I through up is actually to\nParabens page where they've got a few of\n\n882\n00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,540\ntheir different tools,\nnot just the one we're talking about here.\n\n883\n00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,530\nAnd they all have got\nto download demo link.\n\n884\n00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:35,440\nNow whether you’ve got to fill anything\nout, or register, or what, I don’t know,\n\n885\n00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,610\nbut there’s a good link to\nall their demo downloads.\n\n886\n00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:42,609\nAll right so a lot of different software\nchoices that we have available.\n\n887\n00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:46,169\nAnd we also want to take a look at the\nhardware side of things because we might\n\n888\n00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:50,186\nneed some specialized hardware equipment\nto do our forensic investigation on these\n\n889\n00:47:50,186 --> 00:47:51,389\nmobile devices as well.\n\n890\n00:47:51,389 --> 00:47:53,514\nYes there are a lot.\n\n891\n00:47:53,514 --> 00:47:58,520\nThis is where you start wringing\nyour hands going toys, toys.\n\n892\n00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,100\n>> Yea, I hear you.\n\n893\n00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,170\n>> There's all sorts of\nreally neat stuff here.\n\n894\n00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:07,880\nIf you had the budget and had the time.\n\n895\n00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:14,290\nAnd had a significant other that\nwasn't gonna really cause you some\n\n896\n00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:19,545\npain, if you buy all this stuff,\nthen you can have a lot of fun.\n\n897\n00:48:19,545 --> 00:48:21,115\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What this is.\n\n898\n00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:23,775\n>> What I've got up on screen here.\n\n899\n00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:28,705\nThis next one is a piece of hardware\ncalled the Secure View Kit.\n\n900\n00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:35,400\nAnd you can see this is on\nthe mobileforensics.com site.\n\n901\n00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,460\nWhat we have up here, yeah digital\nforensics also has this one too.\n\n902\n00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,130\nThis is.\n>> That might have been software to I\n\n903\n00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,800\nposted there,\nI’ll have to find a link to the hardware.\n\n904\n00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,240\n>> Well of this is I\nthink this is a reseller.\n\n905\n00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,580\n>> Okay.\n>> So you got the right one.\n\n906\n00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,240\n>> Okay.\n\n907\n00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:54,390\n>> But the secure seem to have a better\npicture than digital intelligence had.\n\n908\n00:48:54,390 --> 00:49:00,280\n>> But this Secure View kit,\nyou can see it comes in a hard case.\n\n909\n00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,830\nYou open it up,\nit includes a bunch of hardware, and\n\n910\n00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:09,490\na little bit of software inside,\nthat you can actually just plug your\n\n911\n00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:13,450\ncell phone into it, and\nbe able to extract data from it.\n\n912\n00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,730\nThings that I think is\nInteresting about this,\n\n913\n00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:21,270\nis if you look at the capabilities of it,\n\n914\n00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:24,740\nit's got the ability to retrieve\npasscodes off of iPhones.\n\n915\n00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:29,020\nYou plug it in, and\nit's got the cable and adapter with it.\n\n916\n00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,840\nIt can actually extract\nthat off the device, so\n\n917\n00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,920\nif you need to get into it, it's got it.\n\n918\n00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:41,110\nIt can also do a bunch of\nother operations with it,\n\n919\n00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:44,080\ninvolving extracting\ndifferent types of data, so\n\n920\n00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:49,810\nthat would be just one kit that\nyou have available to you.\n\n921\n00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,310\nIt's not the only one that has this.\n\n922\n00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,720\nI'm gonna show you some others.\n\n923\n00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,750\nBut that's another one that's available.\n\n924\n00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,190\n>> Yeah, and there we go.\n\n925\n00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:59,500\nThanks Ben for\ngrabbing that link for us there.\n\n926\n00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,630\nYou know, that just looks cool.\n\n927\n00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,579\nI want one of those just\nwalking around with it.\n\n928\n00:50:03,579 --> 00:50:04,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Because I\n\n929\n00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,150\nneed to do an investigation.\n\n930\n00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,320\n>> Yeah, that's what you need.\n\n931\n00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,350\nThere's something cool about carrying\naround a plastic case like that.\n\n932\n00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:12,963\nI just need some cool logo on the outside,\nand whoa.\n\n933\n00:50:12,963 --> 00:50:17,930\n>> No, but it is nice, you know, that they\nmake this kit that comes with the hardware\n\n934\n00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:22,310\nI need, the software I need to get started\ndoing mobile forensics, so very cool.\n\n935\n00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,140\nBut they're not the only game in town,\nright?\n\n936\n00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:29,580\n>> Yeah, the other one which we saw\nalready fits back into the software side,\n\n937\n00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,930\nis that deployable device Seizure.\n\n938\n00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:39,200\nThis was the image I showed you just a few\nmoments ago, that I got on the screen.\n\n939\n00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,330\nThis one, a kit includes software CDs,\nthat little green case\n\n940\n00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,900\nthey got down there, that's the software\nsuite that will help you do analysis.\n\n941\n00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,890\nBut this kit is full of different\ntools and adaptors, and\n\n942\n00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:54,710\nall sorts of stuff for\nall different phones.\n\n943\n00:50:54,710 --> 00:51:01,520\nI believe it even includes those,\nthe Faraday bags.\n\n944\n00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,190\nEven includes the ability\nto isolate a phone, and\n\n945\n00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:11,470\nkeep it powered, so\nyou can do the software analysis,\n\n946\n00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,515\nand you can so the hardware\nanalysis with something like this.\n\n947\n00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:16,355\nIts got all the cables and\neverything included with it.\n\n948\n00:51:16,355 --> 00:51:17,505\n>> Right.\n>> And you are ready to go.\n\n949\n00:51:17,505 --> 00:51:22,035\nYou can go out the field and\ndo with your own equipment.\n\n950\n00:51:22,035 --> 00:51:25,530\nIn addition to this, you'd have\nlike a special tablet or something.\n\n951\n00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:26,215\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n952\n00:51:26,215 --> 00:51:28,905\n>> You'd bring that to\nthe field with this, and\n\n953\n00:51:28,905 --> 00:51:31,705\nyou could do your analysis\nright there on scene.\n\n954\n00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:32,465\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n955\n00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:34,745\nthat gives you a really cool ability.\n\n956\n00:51:34,745 --> 00:51:36,640\nReally powerful ability.\n\n957\n00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,290\n>> Alright and\nthen you got one from Exact.\n\n958\n00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,687\n>> Yeah Exact has you know one out there,\n\n959\n00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:52,090\nI believe I've already\ngot their stuff up here.\n\n960\n00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:56,860\nYeah should be the one from Exact.\n\n961\n00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,480\nThis is another one.\n\n962\n00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,090\nThe laptop does not come with this.\n\n963\n00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:04,450\nBut this one includes a bunch of\ntools to plug into the device.\n\n964\n00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:08,810\nIt's also got the ability to\ntake pictures of the screen, and\n\n965\n00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,850\nthat project-a-phone they have there,\nis something that can actually\n\n966\n00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:16,040\nallow you to project images of\nthe phone up on a screen or something,\n\n967\n00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,610\nif you're doing a presentation with it\nYou're gonna have to do that in court.\n\n968\n00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:24,220\nIf you take a phone,\nif you're analyzing this thing,\n\n969\n00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,910\nyou need to show what analysis\nyou did in court and all that.\n\n970\n00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,900\nYou can easily videotape and\n\n971\n00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,350\ndo screen captures of what you're\ndoing on a laptop or desktop.\n\n972\n00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,460\nThat's easy.\n\n973\n00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,310\nYou know but showing,\nyou know, filming, you know,\n\n974\n00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:40,020\nyou just poking around on a cell phone.\n\n975\n00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:45,550\nNo one can see that, so\nwhat you can do is a kit like this.\n\n976\n00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:48,600\nThey also have these stand\nalone too by the way.\n\n977\n00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,070\nIt essentially looks like a clip board,\n\n978\n00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,830\nthat has one of those bendy\nlight things over it.\n\n979\n00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:58,140\nAnd the light also has a camera it\nprojects down the screen, and so\n\n980\n00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,820\nyou can see everything that is\ngoing on in that device, and\n\n981\n00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,880\nyou can record it and capture it,\nyou know, when you're doing it.\n\n982\n00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,900\nAnd then that can be something that you\ncan put in your evidence file for this,\n\n983\n00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,430\nsomething that you can also if it needs to\nbe, it can be presented in a courtroom,\n\n984\n00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:16,810\nbecause it shows everything that's\ngoing on, everything you did.\n\n985\n00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:19,530\nYou can still plug your cables and\neverything into it,\n\n986\n00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,910\nto plug it into your laptop so that they\ncan see the stuff displayed on screen,\n\n987\n00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,270\nas you poke around on it.\n\n988\n00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:26,970\n>> Very cool, very cool, I like that.\n\n989\n00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,370\nAnd one we've seen before,\nI think in some previous episodes,\n\n990\n00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:35,850\nwhere we talked about our getting\nevidence off of our normal desktops and\n\n991\n00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:39,990\nlaptops, was that Logicube.\n\n992\n00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:44,640\n>> Yeah, Logicube,\nI've got this one on screen.\n\n993\n00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,420\nIt's got some of the stuff,\nif we zoom up on there for you a bit, and\n\n994\n00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:53,539\nI'll zoom the image in a bit too so\nyou can see this.\n\n995\n00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,330\nWhat this kit is,\nit shows you've got all sorts of little\n\n996\n00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:04,220\ngadgets in there to do this\nanalysis on a cellphone.\n\n997\n00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:09,190\nLiterally I think Mike, you talking\nabout you want one, cuz it looks cool?\n\n998\n00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,240\n>> Yeah!\n>> That's cool!\n\n999\n00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,920\n>> That's the one to have right there.\n\n1000\n00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,750\nLook at all those adapters up at the top.\n\n1001\n00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,250\nIt's got a little touch screen in there.\n\n1002\n00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,150\nA little place to set the phone.\n\n1003\n00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:18,150\nOh yeah, I'm sold.\n\n1004\n00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,030\n>> Yeah, this is the one it's got,\n\n1005\n00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:24,550\nyou get the device, it tells you\nwhat adapter to use for that device.\n\n1006\n00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:29,690\nYou plug it in, you've got that pad there,\nand then you just use that touch screen to\n\n1007\n00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:34,750\nstart navigating, and doing the analysis\non the device and extracting and stuff.\n\n1008\n00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,030\nAs you can see in there,\nit's got the stuff to read, so\n\n1009\n00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:43,290\nread memory cards to read SIM cards and\nall that, right there in that case.\n\n1010\n00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:46,740\nSo, all you gotta do is have that,\nand be on the go.\n\n1011\n00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:53,100\nThis can be part of your mobile,\nor your lab examination.\n\n1012\n00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,810\nI mean, this is really high-end stuff.\n\n1013\n00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,350\nI don't know what the price is on it, but\n\n1014\n00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:00,340\nI'm sure it's got at\nleast four digits in it.\n\n1015\n00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:04,470\nSo, I'm not even worried about the price\non it, so, I'm just letting you\n\n1016\n00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:09,160\nguys look that up, but that's,\nthis is a really, really neat one.\n\n1017\n00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,510\nLogicube makes several things,\nwhen you mention in other places,\n\n1018\n00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,460\nthey have stuff like drive duplicators and\nthings like that.\n\n1019\n00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:22,890\nSo we talked about drive imaging,\nand bit-stream imaging and all that.\n\n1020\n00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:25,900\nThey actually have the hardware ones\nthat will do them really, really,\n\n1021\n00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:30,570\nreally fast, so\nthat’s where you've heard the name before.\n\n1022\n00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:34,190\nBut they also have these\nmobile forensic solutions.\n\n1023\n00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,073\nAnd this is just one of their\nmobile forensic solutions.\n\n1024\n00:55:37,073 --> 00:55:39,203\nThey have other ones on their site,\n\n1025\n00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:42,334\nthat have different levels\nof functionality, so.\n\n1026\n00:55:42,334 --> 00:55:44,795\nYeah this one is pretty sweet.\n\n1027\n00:55:44,795 --> 00:55:46,583\nThis on made my mouth water when I saw it.\n\n1028\n00:55:46,583 --> 00:55:47,778\nI was like oh yeah.\n\n1029\n00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:48,382\n>> No doubt.\n\n1030\n00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:49,930\nNo doubt.\n\n1031\n00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,420\nThey've probably got one on\nthe way to your house already.\n\n1032\n00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,390\n>> Oh yeah I hope.\n\n1033\n00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:57,940\nA Logicube, the leader in forensics.\n\n1034\n00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,470\nThere we go.\n\n1035\n00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:59,838\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n1036\n00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:04,590\n[LAUGH] All right, so we see we've\ngot a lot of software choices,\n\n1037\n00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:08,910\na lot of hardware choices when it\ncomes to doing our mobile forensics.\n\n1038\n00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,880\nAnd just like we talked about before when\nwe talked about software and hardware for\n\n1039\n00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,510\ndoing forensics, it really comes down to\nmaking sure it has the feature you need.\n\n1040\n00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,610\nTo do your type of investigation.\n\n1041\n00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:20,520\nIt's got to be supported\nin the courts of law.\n\n1042\n00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,870\nOr recognized by the courts of law.\n\n1043\n00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:25,010\nSo if we do use it to pull evidence,\n\n1044\n00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,420\nthat the evidence can\nuphold in the court of law.\n\n1045\n00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,620\nAnd it's got to fit into our budget.\n\n1046\n00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,310\nThe last concern.\n\n1047\n00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:35,120\nProbably not the least important concern,\nbut-\n\n1048\n00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,170\n>> Remember we talked about that all\n\n1049\n00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,750\nthe way in our first episode.\n\n1050\n00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,270\nOur first segment, first episode.\n\n1051\n00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,890\nWhat do you gotta do in a in forensics,\n\n1052\n00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:45,470\none of the first things\nI do is get a budget.\n\n1053\n00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,300\nAnd why we talking about budgets?\n\n1054\n00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,010\nCause of stuff like we just showed you.\n\n1055\n00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:50,645\nThat's why you're talking about budgets.\n\n1056\n00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:53,285\n[LAUGH] And how to blow budgets,\napparently.\n\n1057\n00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,700\n>> [LAUGH] All right, Sean.\n\n1058\n00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,980\nSo we had a couple really good episodes\nhere on mobile forensics, and this one,\n\n1059\n00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,340\nthis particular episode you know we talked\nabout the mobile forensic process and\n\n1060\n00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:07,990\nhow it differs from our process that we\nmight use on a standard desktop or laptop.\n\n1061\n00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:11,360\nAnd it really came down to\nthat pre-investigation phases.\n\n1062\n00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,040\nWe have to do things a little bit\ndifferently when we're approaching\n\n1063\n00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,880\nthe scene than we would with\na standard investigation.\n\n1064\n00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,210\nWhen that does include mobile devices.\n\n1065\n00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,970\nAnd we took a look at some of\nthe different software options, and\n\n1066\n00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:27,180\nhardware options, to carry out this\nmobile forensics investigation.\n\n1067\n00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:31,660\nSo anything else we want\nto add to this episode?\n\n1068\n00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:35,010\n>> No, well, yeah,\nlet me add one thing to it,\n\n1069\n00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:41,140\ncuz I know we didn't get to do\nreally any demos during this.\n\n1070\n00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:44,400\nAnd that's the tough thing with\nmobile forensics is that there is so\n\n1071\n00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,100\nmuch variation in there.\n\n1072\n00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:50,010\nIt's hard to do any really\nserious demos with this.\n\n1073\n00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:55,050\nBut if you do want to do mobile forensics,\n\n1074\n00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:59,970\nyou can get a lot of this equipment cheap,\nlike I said before, off of eBay.\n\n1075\n00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:03,560\nYou also don't need to get this high end\nstuff to start doing mobile forensics,\n\n1076\n00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,020\nyou can get trial versions of software,\nand stuff like that, and\n\n1077\n00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:09,860\nall you've gotta do is buy a cable and\nplug it into your notebook.\n\n1078\n00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:14,180\nAnd that's, if you want to get\nfamiliar with mobile forensics and\n\n1079\n00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:18,225\nstart getting your feet wet,\nthat's where you're gonna start.\n\n1080\n00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:19,880\nIt's poking around doing stuff like that.\n\n1081\n00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:25,160\nYou don't need to wait for the time when\nor if you're able to get the boss or\n\n1082\n00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,950\nget the money to pay for\none of these fancy gadgets.\n\n1083\n00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:31,550\nYou may need to once you\nget good enough at it, but\n\n1084\n00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,570\nyou can start at a much lower level,\nand this is, and\n\n1085\n00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:38,410\nmobile forensics is actually very,\nvery, very much in demand.\n\n1086\n00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:42,630\nYou can actually specialize\njust in mobile forensics now.\n\n1087\n00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:48,800\nI've seen law enforcement agencies\nsend people just to week long\n\n1088\n00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:54,290\nclasses just on mobile forensics alone\nbecause they've had many times they've\n\n1089\n00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:59,940\ngone to crime scenes and they have to,\nthey have a mobile device there because\n\n1090\n00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:04,870\nthe criminal that they've\narrested had one.\n\n1091\n00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:07,420\nBecause everyone has\na mobile device now days.\n\n1092\n00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:12,040\nIt seems like and a smart phone is\nusually the norm on top of that, so\n\n1093\n00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:16,160\nit's something that they have to learn and\nthey're way behind the curve on that.\n\n1094\n00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,380\nSo this is something that\nif you get good at and\n\n1095\n00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:24,230\nyou really like it,\nyou can specialize in it.\n\n1096\n00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:27,620\nYou can go to talk to law enforcement\nagencies, stuff like that and\n\n1097\n00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,930\nthey'll say yeah we've got something for\nyou to do.\n\n1098\n00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:33,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> And that may be where you get\n\n1099\n00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:37,160\ninto the career field professionally\nis doing something like that.\n\n1100\n00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,740\nSo I just kind of want to tack\nthat on to the end of this.\n\n1101\n00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:44,010\n>> Yeah I can definitely see where\ntransitioning to an IT position,\n\n1102\n00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:47,190\nbeing familiar with servers and\nnetworking and my computers.\n\n1103\n00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:50,360\nGetting into forensics is\nnot that big of a stretch.\n\n1104\n00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,300\nBut mobile forensics is completely\ndifferent from what I've done in\n\n1105\n00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,440\nthe server closet.\n\n1106\n00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,380\nAnd its not like working with my servers\nand my network and things like that.\n\n1107\n00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,950\nSo there's, it's a different game and\n\n1108\n00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:01,130\nso that's a,\nthat would be a great niche to get into.\n\n1109\n01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,140\nAnd I don't know about you guys out there,\nbut I've already said.\n\n1110\n01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:07,795\nIt's hard in setting up my\nvirtual forensics workstation.\n\n1111\n01:00:07,795 --> 01:00:11,280\n[LAUGH] Well, all these tools\nthat Sean has been dumping on us.\n\n1112\n01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:11,830\nAll these demos.\n\n1113\n01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:12,790\nYeah.\nIt's getting set up.\n\n1114\n01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,070\n>> Yeah.\nWe're gonna have to talk\n\n1115\n01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:15,040\nabout that some time.\n\n1116\n01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,640\nMaybe we'll do an episode or show\n>> Yeah.\n\n1117\n01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,460\n>> Or something on how to\ndo a forensics kit since\n\n1118\n01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,850\n>> I know you're not the only one,\n\n1119\n01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:26,220\nthere's a lot of people wringing their\nhands out there going how do we do that?\n\n1120\n01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:30,880\nSo, maybe that's something that we\nshould do as a treat to the audience,\n\n1121\n01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,170\nto get them so they can start\ndoing this on their own, too.\n\n1122\n01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:34,720\n>> There you go.\n\n1123\n01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:38,980\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nI hope you enjoyed this episode.\n\n1124\n01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,160\nRemember if you're watching the show and\n\n1125\n01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,310\nyou've got a question, all you got\nto do is go into that chat

another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,845\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:41,780\nSean Oriyano, how you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,180\n>> I am doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n7\n00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,170\n>> I am doing fantastic, getting ready for\n\n8\n00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,600\nanother episode of our digital\nforensic investigator series.\n\n9\n00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,950\nThis episode we're gonna\ntalk about reporting,\n\n10\n00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,450\ndoing our investigative reports.\n\n11\n00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,590\nWe've gone through a lot of information\nover the last few episodes, but\n\n12\n00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,170\nat the end of our investigation.\n\n13\n00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,340\nA very important part of our\ninvestigation has to be that we have\n\n14\n00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,980\ntake that information that we've gathered,\ncollected, and make it presentable.\n\n15\n00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,270\nEither to a company, if we're doing\na corporate investigation, or\n\n16\n00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,220\nto maybe some lawyers if we're\ndoing a criminal investigation, or\n\n17\n00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,070\npossibly even presented in court itself.\n\n18\n00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,080\nSo reporting, maybe not the most exciting\npart of being a forensic investigator but\n\n19\n00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,970\ndefinitely an important part, right?\n\n20\n00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,940\n>> Yes, it's important,\ncritical, absolutely essential,\n\n21\n00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,530\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n22\n00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:37,240\nThis is where you're bringing all your\nfindings together in a nice format,\n\n23\n00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,190\nin a certain way that\nsomeone can read this,\n\n24\n00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,860\nor whoever your intended\naudience can read it.\n\n25\n00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,510\nAnd dissect it and see what your\nconclusions were, opinions were,\n\n26\n00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,910\nwhat your facts were, and what was done.\n\n27\n00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,600\nThis is a very critical thing to have,\nyour lawyers,\n\n28\n00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,465\nthe lawyer working for a client your\nlooking for, could be reviewing this.\n\n29\n00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:02,840\nSo, will be reviewing\nit as the case may be.\n\n30\n00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,020\nSo it's very important that you get this\nright and follow certain standards and\n\n31\n00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,810\nguidelines, which have been\nestablished for this thankfully.\n\n32\n00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,230\nAnd don't worry if this\nreporting stuff seems confusing.\n\n33\n00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,250\nI've got samples that I'm gonna show\nyou during the courses episodes,\n\n34\n00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,960\nso you can see some samples and\nsee what they look like.\n\n35\n00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,780\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n36\n00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,850\nYeah, so again, critical part of our\ninvestigation, because really without\n\n37\n00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,570\nthis, the investigation didn't\ndo us a whole lot of good.\n\n38\n00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,250\nI've got all this evidence,\nI've got all this stuff.\n\n39\n00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,970\nBut if I can't make it presentable,\nI can't present it to whoever the intended\n\n40\n00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,818\nrecipient is, then the investigation\nwas kind of a waste of time almost.\n\n41\n00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:47,612\nI don't wanna say complete waste of time,\nbut\n\n42\n00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:51,195\nthat is how we deliver\nwhat it is we've found.\n\n43\n00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:55,493\n>> Yeah, the question would be at that\npoint, what were you really doing?\n\n44\n00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:56,148\n>> Yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:59,485\n[LAUGH]\n>> Cuz if you don't have a formal report\n\n46\n00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:04,065\nto present at the end,\nyou were just playing with some toys and\n\n47\n00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:06,905\npoking around,\nit doesn't amount to a whole lot.\n\n48\n00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:10,800\n>> Yeah, I was having a great time but\nin the end, no bueno.\n\n49\n00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,980\nAlright, so\nwe know that reporting is important,\n\n50\n00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,490\nit's a key part of our\nforensic investigation.\n\n51\n00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,760\nAnd as you say here Sean,\nit's gotta be thorough,\n\n52\n00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,350\nwe've got to make sure that it covers,\nwe can't leave things out.\n\n53\n00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:28,385\n>> Yes, that is a big part of this is\nthat you're gonna wanna read this and\n\n54\n00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:31,890\nre-read this and\nmake sure you got all your ducks in a row.\n\n55\n00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,050\nAs the saying goes,\nyou wanna have everything in there.\n\n56\n00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,780\nNo matter how minor or insignificant, you\nwant to have it in there and document it.\n\n57\n00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,540\nBecause that could be the point where\nsomeone tries to get their toe in or\n\n58\n00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,460\nwhatever, to break apart\nother stuff to see.\n\n59\n00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,810\nOkay well you don't have attention to\ndetail because you clearly missed this.\n\n60\n00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,160\nSo you want to get the information\nin there be thorough,\n\n61\n00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,270\nabout your findings and\nabout he process you took.\n\n62\n00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,270\nDon't leave anything out, and just make\n\n63\n00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,820\nsure that's all everything's accounted\nfor, and you should be in good shape.\n\n64\n00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,330\nYou're always gonna have this scrutinized,\nthat's something you can count on.\n\n65\n00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,230\nThis report will be scrutinized\nlike your papers in college and\n\n66\n00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,790\nhigh school that you wrote.\n\n67\n00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,910\nThey will be scrutinized pretty thoroughly\neven more, so only thing here is that\n\n68\n00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,000\nyou're not gonna have a red pin\ntaken to it and handed back to you.\n\n69\n00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,500\nYou will have it very thoroughly\nscrutinized by potentially two sets of\n\n70\n00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,260\npeople at least.\n\n71\n00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,080\nIf you're in court, it's gonna be your\nside and the other side can request it.\n\n72\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,790\n>> Yeah, and\nit won't be as you said a red pin mark up.\n\n73\n00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,118\nIt'll more likely be a pink slip.\n\n74\n00:04:39,118 --> 00:04:43,330\n[LAUGH]\n>> It could be or maybe no paycheck.\n\n75\n00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,100\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n76\n00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,870\n>> The devil would do something like that,\n\n77\n00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,310\nthat's not desirable either.\n\n78\n00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,290\n>> Exactly.\n\n79\n00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,475\nAlright, so what are the key\ndetails then for my report here?\n\n80\n00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:56,690\nKey things that you wanna\nmake sure that you obey or\n\n81\n00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,670\nhave made sure you've fulfilled with\nthis report is the first one here.\n\n82\n00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,060\nYou wanna be very timely with it,\nit's not something you can say, oh,\n\n83\n00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,990\nI'll get it tomorrow, or I'll get it\ntomorrow and keep pushing it off.\n\n84\n00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,860\nIt has to be presented in\na reasonable time frame and\n\n85\n00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,210\nsometimes that reasonable time\nframe will be dictated to you.\n\n86\n00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,580\nSaying during the course of the\ninvestigation they could tell you that in\n\n87\n00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,120\ncertain jurisdictions that after\nthe investigation is complete.\n\n88\n00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,790\nThe forensic part of\nthe investigation is complete,\n\n89\n00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,030\nthen you have to have report turned into\nwhomever within a certain time frame.\n\n90\n00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,879\nOtherwise, it can be\nconsider to be invalid or\n\n91\n00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,670\nthere could be legal penalties in some\ncases where you haven't turned that in.\n\n92\n00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,930\nSo this is very important,\nit has to be timely.\n\n93\n00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,050\n>> All right, we've seen TV shows which\nwe know are not very realistic sometimes.\n\n94\n00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,400\nBut when you talk about the court systems,\n\n95\n00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,210\nyou've got people relying\non this evidence.\n\n96\n00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,910\nThey need it when it's time to present\nthat evidence, it needs to be there.\n\n97\n00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,220\nIf they don't have it or\n\n98\n00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,810\ncan't produce the evidence, the other\nside could get the case thrown out.\n\n99\n00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,840\nThey could hold you in contempt, or hold\none side in contempt cuz they're saying\n\n100\n00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,160\nyou're not willing to\ngive us that information.\n\n101\n00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,510\nSo it's gotta be done in a timely fashion.\n\n102\n00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,180\nMust be complete, as you said earlier.\n\n103\n00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,160\nWe can't leave anything out.\n\n104\n00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,660\nGotta make sure we're including\neverything we found in that report.\n\n105\n00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,670\nWhat else we got?\n\n106\n00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,275\n>> There's another one, must explain\nthe incident that it was intended or\n\n107\n00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,850\nthat you were actually investigating.\n\n108\n00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,550\nLet's explain the instance\nthat led up to it.\n\n109\n00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,020\nSo there will be something\n\n110\n00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,830\nright near the front of this document or\nright at the top of this document.\n\n111\n00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,160\nA summary saying,\n\n112\n00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,130\nthat this is what the case was that led\nthis forensic investigation to take place.\n\n113\n00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,800\nAnd so, you will make sure that\nyou have a good summary of it.\n\n114\n00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,330\nAnd then go through and start presenting\nyour evidence as appropriate.\n\n115\n00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,260\n>> All right, exactly.\n\n116\n00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,627\nAnd sorry for those of you that\nmight be a US centric term.\n\n117\n00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:03,775\nPink slip used to refer to if\nsomebody was gonna get released or\n\n118\n00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:08,456\nfired, they would get their pink slip and\nthat was a bad day.\n\n119\n00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:09,305\n>> That's a P-45.\nThat was like [LAUGH\n\n120\n00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:10,483\n>> So that's what I was [CROSSTALK]\n\n121\n00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:12,397\n>> Is that like somebody poured a shot or\n\n122\n00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:13,606\nsomething like that.\n\n123\n00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:16,065\n[LAUGH] It's a great old airplane.\n\n124\n00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:16,711\nI love that one.\nIn fact,\n\n125\n00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:19,139\nsome of your nose art\nmight've come from a P-45.\n\n126\n00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,718\n[LAUGH]\n>> P-40.\n\n127\n00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:21,739\nP-40, there we go.\n\n128\n00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:22,777\n>> Flying tigers.\n\n129\n00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,495\n[LAUGH]\n>> There you go.\n\n130\n00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:28,110\nSo it's gotta explain the incident,\nit's gotta be technically sound, right?\n\n131\n00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,550\nWhich kinda makes sense, we can't have\nincorrect or inaccurate information.\n\n132\n00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,980\n>> Yeah, that shouldn't be\nof any big surprise there.\n\n133\n00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,410\nIt should be very technically sound.\n\n134\n00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,890\nI mean, come on.\n\n135\n00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,160\nIf you're being engaged to\ndo something like this,\n\n136\n00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,530\nyou should have the technical skills.\n\n137\n00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,555\nThe tricky part is gonna be is you might,\nbecause your knowledge,\n\n138\n00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,618\nyou might assume someone else has that.\n\n139\n00:07:55,618 --> 00:08:02,135\nAnd that's not something that\nis unique to forensic people,\n\n140\n00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:06,865\nall of us that are in IT we know that\n>> If we're not careful,\n\n141\n00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:10,690\nwe will leave something out,\ncuz we're like someone knows that acronym.\n\n142\n00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,004\nHow many times have you been someplace and\nsomeone throws a bunch of acronyms at you,\n\n143\n00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:15,650\nand you're like, you don't know that?\n\n144\n00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,915\nYou can't assume that anyone just\nknows what you're talking about.\n\n145\n00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:25,224\nAnd even to that end,\nwhen you're saying it's technically sound,\n\n146\n00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:29,309\nthere is a tendency when you talk\ntechnical to have a lot of terms,\n\n147\n00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:33,040\nabbreviations and\nstuff like that thrown in.\n\n148\n00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,020\nVery easy to slip in.\n\n149\n00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,300\nSo it's an important detail on\nreports would be to include\n\n150\n00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,290\na glossary that explains these terms.\n\n151\n00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:46,190\nYou literally should be doing that, and\nthat way, if someone looks at it, and\n\n152\n00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:52,280\nis kind of looking at the report going,\nwhat the heck is that supposed to mean?\n\n153\n00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,410\nLike this one,\nthe pink slip would be an example.\n\n154\n00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,385\nA pink slip, you might understand that\nhere in the US, but you're in the UK,\n\n155\n00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:07,410\nthere no, there's an equivalent of it,\nbut it's not the same thing.\n\n156\n00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,280\nSo you'd have to explain this\nis what a pink slip refers to.\n\n157\n00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,490\nSomeone in that country\ncould then translate it over\n\n158\n00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,870\nto the appropriate thing there.\n\n159\n00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,480\n>> It's something that as an instructor\nthat I've dealt with many times.\n\n160\n00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,400\nI know you have as well.\n\n161\n00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,910\nWe always have to,\nyou can't assume knowledge, right,\n\n162\n00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:27,360\neven though this is a second server class,\nmaybe in a series or something like that.\n\n163\n00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,277\nYou mention a term,\nyou wannna make sure you define it,\n\n164\n00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,015\nat least to a cursory review, but\n\n165\n00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:36,440\nyou can never assume knowledge which kinda\nleads us right into our next point there.\n\n166\n00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,202\nIt does have to be understandable,\n\n167\n00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,856\nand we gotta make sure we understand\nwho it needs to be understandable to.\n\n168\n00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:46,366\n>> Yeah, that's something that we defined,\nor we talked about,\n\n169\n00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:51,457\nif you recall, way early on in some\nof our early episodes in this series,\n\n170\n00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:55,548\nis that we said that when you\nare presenting information,\n\n171\n00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:59,910\nyou need to take into account,\nwho you're presenting it to.\n\n172\n00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,057\nIf it's someone that has the same\nlevel of knowledge you do,\n\n173\n00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:08,975\nthen you can probably talk all\nthat techno babble, as they say.\n\n174\n00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:13,865\nYou can probably just throw it out there,\nand just let it fly, not worry about it.\n\n175\n00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:18,580\nHowever, that's not\nthe majority of people and\n\n176\n00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,150\nif this report you think is gonna go\ninto a courtroom at any point, then\n\n177\n00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,570\nwhat comes into play is, you know there's\npeople in there that don't understand it.\n\n178\n00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,570\nYou've got a jury possibly in there.\n\n179\n00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,980\nThe jury, they select that\nfrom the general population.\n\n180\n00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,300\nYou could have everything from someone\nthat is doing what you're doing to\n\n181\n00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:46,080\na doctor, to a grandmother that's home in\nretirement that doesn't do these things.\n\n182\n00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,750\nSo you gotta make sure it's\nunderstandable to a broad range.\n\n183\n00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,170\nNow, that may actually be in the report\nitself, or it could be something,\n\n184\n00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,780\nwhere the report's given to your attorney,\nit's written for the attorney, and\n\n185\n00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,860\nthen you will work with the attorney\nto describe and kind of distill things\n\n186\n00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,760\ndown to something they can understand so\nthey can talk about it knowledgeably.\n\n187\n00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,920\nSo there's a couple ways it can be\napproached, but make sure whoever\n\n188\n00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,410\nwill be reading the report and evaluating\nit will be understandable to them.\n\n189\n00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:17,950\n>> So that's key,\n\n190\n00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,680\nis knowing who's getting,\nwho is the receiver of this report.\n\n191\n00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,310\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n192\n00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,650\nThey say for like, believe it or not, and\n\n193\n00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,730\nI would adopt this with these\ntypes of reports, is say for\n\n194\n00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,930\nwhen you write IT books,\nand not kidding people.\n\n195\n00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,526\nAnd you know I've written one,\nmore than one, I've written that, so\n\n196\n00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:40,610\nyou know where I'm coming from.\n\n197\n00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,935\nIt's actually advised that\nyou write those books for\n\n198\n00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,856\nsomeone who's at an eighth-grade level.\n\n199\n00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:48,897\nThat has an eighth grade\nreading comprehension.\n\n200\n00:11:48,897 --> 00:11:53,720\nSo, I think that would be\na reasonable thing to consider.\n\n201\n00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,770\nI'm not saying necessarily eighth grade,\nbut\n\n202\n00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,309\nconsider writing to a level\nthat you hope everyone's at.\n\n203\n00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,365\n>> Lowest common denominator is\nreally what we're shooting for there.\n\n204\n00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:06,449\nWhat we're talking about is kind of\na sad state of affairs there, but\n\n205\n00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:10,190\neighth grade reading level is what we're\nshooting for when we write those papers.\n\n206\n00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,106\nAnd it's gotta follow a certain format,\nright.\n\n207\n00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:15,566\nWe've gotta make sure it's\nset up properly, our report.\n\n208\n00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,034\n>> Yes, there's some formats,\n\n209\n00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,750\nthere's numerous formats out\nthere as a matter of fact.\n\n210\n00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,811\nIt depends on a number\nof different things,\n\n211\n00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:28,690\non the organization you're working for,\nwho the client might be working for.\n\n212\n00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,140\nThere's some standard formats out there\nin the wild that you can use that will\n\n213\n00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,850\nfulfill this if you aren't imposed with a\nspecific format or template to put it in.\n\n214\n00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:47,100\nBut there should be a format present, even\nif you've made it up on your own, there\n\n215\n00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,640\nshould be a format present that shows a\nlogical progression through the facts, and\n\n216\n00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,740\nit's very simple and easy to follow\nhow everything moves through.\n\n217\n00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,570\nYou don't wanna have something that's\na mess, and it just is all over the place.\n\n218\n00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,790\nThat's not gonna help your case in so\nmany ways.\n\n219\n00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,470\nFirst of all,\nthey're not gonna find the information,\n\n220\n00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,600\npossibly not find the information\nthat you need them to have.\n\n221\n00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,615\nAnd second of all, it shows that,\nhey, are you scatterbrained?\n\n222\n00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:16,740\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> If your paper's scatterbrained,\n\n223\n00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,600\nyou're scatterbrained, and therefore your\ninvestigation might be scatterbrained.\n\n224\n00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,200\nAnd I don't want that.\n\n225\n00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,231\nThis is a reflection of yourself.\n\n226\n00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:27,523\nSo make sure you're clear and\nconcise with that.\n\n227\n00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:31,253\n>> And then should our report come\nto any kind of summarization, or\n\n228\n00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:33,870\ndo we just present the facts?\n\n229\n00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,090\n>> This is the one where you've got\nsome things that you wanna make\n\n230\n00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,740\nsure are in there.\n\n231\n00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,450\nYou wanna have the facts in there for\nsure.\n\n232\n00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,409\nYou need to have conclusions in there,\nwhat these facts led you to,\n\n233\n00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:53,200\nand then you are allowed to and\nencouraged to put in your opinion.\n\n234\n00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,348\nMake sure that your opinion is\nclearly annotated as your opinion\n\n235\n00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:02,940\nas a professional,\nas someone that's been doing this.\n\n236\n00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,773\nThis is how you came to this.\n\n237\n00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:08,060\nThis is why you feel this is this way.\n\n238\n00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,550\nAnd all that, but\nyou can't put an opinion in and just say,\n\n239\n00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,170\nI'm not putting in the facts or the\nconclusions that those facts came from.\n\n240\n00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,740\nYou have to have all of those.\n\n241\n00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,050\nYou have to have the facts,\nyou have to have the conclusions, and\n\n242\n00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:24,020\nyou very well should, I'd say you\nmust have your own opinion in there,\n\n243\n00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,980\ntoo, based on who you are.\n\n244\n00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,240\nYou're allowed to do that.\n\n245\n00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,000\nYou're considered an expert.\n\n246\n00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,470\nSo you should be putting that in.\n\n247\n00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,810\nAnd that will carry weight.\n\n248\n00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,110\nThat definitely will carry weight if and\nwhen you have to go into a courtroom.\n\n249\n00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:41,040\nIt's like, well this person does this,\nhas done several of these cases,\n\n250\n00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,210\nis considered an expert, and\nthat's their expert opinion.\n\n251\n00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,240\nSo why do you not think it's valid?\n\n252\n00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,273\nIt will carry a lot of weight.\n\n253\n00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:49,898\n>> Absolutely.\n\n254\n00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:53,599\nIt is just your opinion, but you\nare considered an expert in the field, so\n\n255\n00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:57,362\nyour opinion is gonna carry a little\nmore weight than can the average Joe off\n\n256\n00:14:57,362 --> 00:15:01,030\nthe street, or the defense attorney or\nthe prosecutor or what have you.\n\n257\n00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:05,080\nCuz you're the one that is the expert\naccording to the court systems.\n\n258\n00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,470\nAnd then I do have to worry\nabout legal issues, right?\n\n259\n00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,090\n>> Yes, there could be some legal\nissues involved with these reports.\n\n260\n00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,740\nThere's too many to specifically mention.\n\n261\n00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,231\nBut if you look at any of the laws that\npertain to any of the major regulated\n\n262\n00:15:23,231 --> 00:15:28,904\nindustries, maybe even some national\nsecurity stuff and federal stuff,\n\n263\n00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:34,774\nthose may have their own things that you\nneed to include, that you need to do.\n\n264\n00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:39,020\nThere may even be certain that\nyou can distribute that report.\n\n265\n00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,002\nIn certain cases, if you're talking about\nsomething, that is, if you ever had to\n\n266\n00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:48,984\nwork on something like this, if you worked\nin a case that was pertaining to national\n\n267\n00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:53,565\nsecurity, they're not gonna just let\nyou say, hey, here's the report.\n\n268\n00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:54,066\nYou want one?\n\n269\n00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,408\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, you can have one, and\n\n270\n00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:56,231\nyou can have one.\n\n271\n00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:58,054\nNo.\nThat's a good way to get in a lot of\n\n272\n00:15:58,054 --> 00:15:59,106\ntrouble and quickly.\n\n273\n00:15:59,106 --> 00:15:59,727\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n274\n00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:05,421\nthey're gonna have ways you can present\ninformation and who you can share it with.\n\n275\n00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:10,071\nSo make sure you're aware of those\nbecause you're putting a lot of really\n\n276\n00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:12,851\njuicy details and\nstuff like that in there.\n\n277\n00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:17,244\nSo that That would be at least one thing\nand then, there could be rules based on,\n\n278\n00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:21,650\nlike I said, formatting and\nstuff like that, that could be in there.\n\n279\n00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,310\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n280\n00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,620\n>> There's a lot of key details there.\n\n281\n00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,280\nYou gotta be timely,\n\n282\n00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,340\ncomplete, we've gotta make sure that\nit does explain the information or\n\n283\n00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,150\nthe incident, it's technically sound,\nwe've got good accurate information,\n\n284\n00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:40,490\nclearly formatted, including\nthe conclusions and possibly our opinion.\n\n285\n00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,860\nAs long as we make sure\nannotate those out.\n\n286\n00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,200\nAnd we've gotta make sure we're focused\non the laws that might be in place\n\n287\n00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,500\nregarding our reports.\n\n288\n00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,570\nAnd then, there's some additional\nrecommendations you wanna make.\n\n289\n00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,430\n>> Yes, there's recommendations of certain\nthings that you should keep in mind.\n\n290\n00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,608\nSome of the stuff we've mentioned, but\n\n291\n00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:02,742\nyou can't mention enough,\nis the decision maker.\n\n292\n00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:06,960\nYou wanna make sure whoever\ncalled upon you to do this,\n\n293\n00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,940\nit meets their requirements.\n\n294\n00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,110\nThey were looking for you to do something.\n\n295\n00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,900\nDid you carry out all the stuff\nthat they needed to have done?\n\n296\n00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,350\nAnd is it something that they will be\nable to look at themselves and say, yes,\n\n297\n00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,410\nthis has been done as needed.\n\n298\n00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,750\nIf you can't do it at they need it, then\nyou should have discussed that earlier on\n\n299\n00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,250\nand then you should also note that in\nyour report if you do continue on.\n\n300\n00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,790\nAnd say, yeah, this was the original\ncourse but certain items impacted it and\n\n301\n00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,880\nwe had to adapt to a loss of evidence, or\n\n302\n00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,450\nsomething getting thrown out,\nor what have you.\n\n303\n00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,690\nThose things should also\nbe included in that.\n\n304\n00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,910\nSo, decisions makers knows that hey,\nmaybe,\n\n305\n00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,090\nI couldn't meet your goals exactly\nthe way you specified, but\n\n306\n00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,350\nI was able to give your report that\ngave you a result that should help you.\n\n307\n00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,260\nOr at least give you a good\nexplanation of what the situation or\n\n308\n00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,070\nincident I investigated was.\n\n309\n00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,660\n>> It reminds me a lot\nof project management.\n\n310\n00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,350\nWe're talking way back to\none of our first episodes,\n\n311\n00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,500\nwe talked about how our\ninvestigation needed goals.\n\n312\n00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,630\nWe had to set those out clearly.\n\n313\n00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,890\nAnd those goals, we're gonna\ndefine what I'm looking for and\n\n314\n00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,690\nwhat I'm hoping to get in the end.\n\n315\n00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,550\nAnd then,\nwhen it comes to your deliverables,\n\n316\n00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,750\nto use my project management term,\nthey have to meet the stakeholders,\n\n317\n00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,550\nthe ones that invested,\nthe ones that want those results.\n\n318\n00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,750\nWhether that's a defense attorney,\n\n319\n00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,640\nprosecutor, in house organization,\na company investigation.\n\n320\n00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,500\nI've gotta make sure that I met\nthe goals that we set out originally.\n\n321\n00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,010\nAnd it's usually up any\ntime along the way.\n\n322\n00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,850\nI don't think that's gonna be possible.\n\n323\n00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,720\nI shouldn't wait until the last minute and\nsay, oh, here's what I got.\n\n324\n00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,010\nI couldn't get everything.\n\n325\n00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,430\nWe have to make sure that\nwe adjust our goals so\n\n326\n00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,690\nthat in the end, I still meet my goals.\n\n327\n00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,940\nWe just had to tweak them a little bit and\nthat way, I was able to meet my goals.\n\n328\n00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,740\nSo, very much like project\nmanagement when it comes to that.\n\n329\n00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,710\nAnd then, it must be based on evidence.\n\n330\n00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,046\n>> Yeah.\nAnd I don't know if this even really needs\n\n331\n00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:04,936\na full explanation at this point.\n\n332\n00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,957\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What are you basing it on,\n\n333\n00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:08,535\nif it's not based on evidence?\n\n334\n00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:12,610\nYou're just like,\nbased on my expert opinion.\n\n335\n00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,230\nYou're playing.\n\n336\n00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,650\nAt that point, you're no different\nthan an armchair forensic person or\n\n337\n00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,630\narmchair quarterback.\n\n338\n00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,610\nWhatever you wanna call it,\nthat's all you are at that point [LAUGH].\n\n339\n00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,920\nYou've got nothing to back up what you\nsay no matter how smart and brilliant and\n\n340\n00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,160\ntalented you are, who cares?\n\n341\n00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,670\nThis is not something where you get go\nthrough and, oh, this is my opinion.\n\n342\n00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,520\nOh, well, good, happy for you.\n\n343\n00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,670\nWhere's the evidence?\n\n344\n00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,210\nSo, that evidence has to be there.\n\n345\n00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,860\nIn a lot of cases, it will be\npresent there in the court room.\n\n346\n00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,534\nRemember, we did gather our originals,\nand put them in bags and\n\n347\n00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:53,210\nall that, and did our imaging on them,\nand worked on the images.\n\n348\n00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,080\nAll of that stuff we've talked about\nduring the course of this whole training.\n\n349\n00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,430\nThose originals may actually be popping\nout in court saying, yeah, here they are.\n\n350\n00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,910\nSo, that's the place\nwhere they have to be.\n\n351\n00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,630\nRemember, best evidence.\n\n352\n00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,400\nBest evidence says that the originals\n\n353\n00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,160\nare the ones that can be presented in\ncourt if the requirement comes up.\n\n354\n00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,930\nSo, those things will be there.\n\n355\n00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:21,280\nSo, you need to have that evidence plus\nyour evidence that you pulled off of it,\n\n356\n00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,650\nall there in your report.\n\n357\n00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,170\nThat's why some of these\nreports can be pretty big.\n\n358\n00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,550\nEven on a small investigation,\n\n359\n00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:33,160\ndon't expect to have a report\nthat's maybe just a few pages long.\n\n360\n00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,920\nYou could have, I was talking\nabout some of that investigated\n\n361\n00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,230\na simple email abuse situation.\n\n362\n00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,440\n40 pages.\n\n363\n00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,750\n40 pages to do this.\n\n364\n00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,830\nSo, be prepared to chop down a few\nforests when you do something like this,\n\n365\n00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,220\nbecause there's gonna be a lot there.\n\n366\n00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,300\n>> It's gotta be based on evidence,\nand even Gibbs in NCIS, he has his gut\n\n367\n00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,270\nfeelings, but he never acts on them until\nhe actually has evidence to back it up.\n\n368\n00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,870\nSo, we can't go into a court or present\na report that's based on our gut feelings.\n\n369\n00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,490\nAnd then, it's gotta be concise.\n\n370\n00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,341\nI mean,\nwe know it's probably gonna be large but\n\n371\n00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:11,503\nwe don't want extra fluff in there.\n\n372\n00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:15,990\n>> Yeah, this isn't something\nwhere you're gonna pad it out and\n\n373\n00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,793\nmake it large just to look impressive.\n\n374\n00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:21,394\nYou can't do those tricks\nlike you did in high school.\n\n375\n00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:22,253\n>> Double-spacing.\n\n376\n00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:23,444\n>> Double-spacing.\n\n377\n00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:23,980\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n378\n00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,531\n>> Everyone knows that.\n\n379\n00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:25,414\nWe didn't even practice that.\n\n380\n00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:28,638\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can't do stuff like that,\n\n381\n00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:33,774\nit has to be something that's got,\nnot only have the information in it, but\n\n382\n00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:39,577\nthat information has to be something that\nexplains the situation, it's detailed.\n\n383\n00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:43,710\nIt gets right to the point,\nwe don't want a lot of fluff in there.\n\n384\n00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,270\nWe want something that we said is\nunderstandable, has the meat there, and\n\n385\n00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,170\njust cuts right to it.\n\n386\n00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,030\nSo, someone can see it and keep moving and\nprogressing right through.\n\n387\n00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,424\nSince you're putting your opinion in\nthere, your opinion's your time to not\n\n388\n00:21:58,424 --> 00:22:02,752\ngo crazy with it but you can get a little\nmore flowery with your language within\n\n389\n00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:06,972\nreason, you can get a little more\nflowery with it and descriptive with it.\n\n390\n00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:10,756\nBut you wanna be concise\nas much as possible.\n\n391\n00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:14,727\nThat should be your primary\ngoal through that whole report.\n\n392\n00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:16,733\n>> Yeah, so\nwe wanna include everything but\n\n393\n00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:19,440\nwe've got to make sure that\nit's relevant to the case.\n\n394\n00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,553\nOtherwise, it's unnecessary and\n\n395\n00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:25,013\nit's distracting from what\nis important in that report.\n\n396\n00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:28,230\n>> And there's some examples,\nI know there's some templates,\n\n397\n00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,879\nthere's a bunch of different tools\nwe can use to create these reports.\n\n398\n00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:35,140\nWe're gonna take a look\nat a report template.\n\n399\n00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,195\nYou know, I can develop my own template,\nI suppose, and there's some out there.\n\n400\n00:22:38,195 --> 00:22:39,939\nI know Michaela put a link for Sans and\n\n401\n00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:43,210\nwe're gonna take a look at a couple\nof things later on in our episode.\n\n402\n00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,459\nBut in general, we can probably\ndescribe the form a report should take.\n\n403\n00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:50,992\n>> Yeah, in general,\nwhen you're doing this,\n\n404\n00:22:50,992 --> 00:22:54,355\nthere's a lot of forms\na report can go into.\n\n405\n00:22:54,355 --> 00:22:57,310\nBut there should some basic things there.\n\n406\n00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,300\nThere should be just the initial\nintroduction or summary to it.\n\n407\n00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,170\nThere should be the main\nbody of the report.\n\n408\n00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,012\nThere should be whatever\nattachments you need.\n\n409\n00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,510\nGlossaries there.\n\n410\n00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,290\nAnything you need to support\nyour conclusions, and\n\n411\n00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,320\nshow your facts, and your opinion,\nor what you based your opinion on.\n\n412\n00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,400\nThose should all be included with it.\n\n413\n00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,510\nSo, all those things will also increase\nthe weight and size of that report.\n\n414\n00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:29,360\nThat's why you do end up with\nthese reports that are really kind\n\n415\n00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,750\nof thick and all that good stuff.\n\n416\n00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:38,500\nSo, you're just gonna have to be prepared\nto formulate these monster reports.\n\n417\n00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,750\nThe good thing about it though is that\nthere's not only the templates available\n\n418\n00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:49,540\nonline for us to use, there's also third\nparty software that will help you do that.\n\n419\n00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,227\nOne that comes to mind right away\nis one called Access FTK and\n\n420\n00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:59,850\nyou can actually put your stuff in there\nand it can do a lot of the forensic\n\n421\n00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:06,081\nfunctions we talked about during the whole\ncourse of this digital forensics.\n\n422\n00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:10,856\nIt can do things like help you crack\nEFS files and analyze images and\n\n423\n00:24:10,856 --> 00:24:12,141\nstuff like that.\n\n424\n00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:13,418\nIt can do a lot of things.\n\n425\n00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,855\nBut it can also generate a very\nnice report for you, and\n\n426\n00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:20,367\nit is pretty detailed for\nwhat it can put in that report,\n\n427\n00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:25,670\nand you have the ability to customize\nthat report however you see necessary.\n\n428\n00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:31,230\nSo that is great, you dump the information\ninto this, you enter your stuff in.\n\n429\n00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:35,680\nYou do your analysis to a certain\ndegree with this access FTK.\n\n430\n00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,520\nAnd then it just, it can generate\na nice report for you when you need it.\n\n431\n00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,200\nWho knows, maybe you have to add to it.\n\n432\n00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,780\nBut that will, this it can get you pretty\nfar down the path of having that report,\n\n433\n00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,320\nand so, that would be a good thing.\n\n434\n00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,210\nAnd it's not the only\none that does it either.\n\n435\n00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,260\nI mean, there's other tools.\n\n436\n00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,420\nI think I saw some in\nhere that were mentioned,\n\n437\n00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:57,010\nthat are other tools that\ncan generate reports.\n\n438\n00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,450\nIf you have one that can\ngenerate reports for you,\n\n439\n00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,430\nand make your life easier,\nI would definitely encourage you to do so.\n\n440\n00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,590\nOne less thing for you to have to worry\nabout, cuz now you can worry about,\n\n441\n00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,160\nis it understandable, is it concise,\ndoes it have the facts in their.\n\n442\n00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,300\nYou can make sure all those things\nwithout having to worry about how do I\n\n443\n00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,195\nformat this again and you gotta flip\nback and forth between the style guide.\n\n444\n00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:22,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To get it right, so I said,\n\n445\n00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,480\ndefinitely encourage it.\n\n446\n00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,520\nAccess FTK is not the only one.\n\n447\n00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,180\nThere's plenty of other ones there.\n\n448\n00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:36,280\nMichaela put up the sans guide in there,\nwhich is another good one, so you choose.\n\n449\n00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,470\nWho knows?\n\n450\n00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:43,290\nThe law that caused you to have to\ngenerate that, let's say it was hip or\n\n451\n00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:49,350\nsomething, they may have their own\ntemplate that they want you to use.\n\n452\n00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:54,630\nBecause they need certain information for\n\n453\n00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,450\nthat specific organization needs\nthis evidence for, whatever.\n\n454\n00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,500\nOr tracking it.\n\n455\n00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,370\nTracking incidents.\n\n456\n00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,020\nTracking failure of security.\n\n457\n00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,220\nTracking information leakage problems.\n\n458\n00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,590\nYou're not gonna use that to\nimprove procedures down the road.\n\n459\n00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,506\nI've seen it happen.\n\n460\n00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:12,720\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n461\n00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,040\nTemplates are out there.\n\n462\n00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,000\n>> In addition to all the information\nwe're putting in that report,\n\n463\n00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,580\nwe need stuff to back up that information\nthat we're including in there, right?\n\n464\n00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,110\nLike things about our evidence\nthat we've collected.\n\n465\n00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:30,220\n>> Yeah, there's so many different\nways of providing evidence for this.\n\n466\n00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,810\nNow evidence in the report,\n\n467\n00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,755\nthat goes with the report, might just\nbe your pictures and your sketches.\n\n468\n00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:36,460\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n469\n00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,860\n>> And what have you.\n\n470\n00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,880\nJust kind of the paper documentation,\nall that type of stuff.\n\n471\n00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,180\nBut there could be other things,\nphysical evidence.\n\n472\n00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,420\nA hard drive.\n\n473\n00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,990\nIsn't gonna be included with the report,\nit's just not appropriate.\n\n474\n00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,910\n>> But we do have to include information\nabout that hard drive like our chain of\n\n475\n00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:56,060\ncustody and all of that to make sure that\nthey understand that the evidence was\n\n476\n00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,125\ncollected properly, maintained properly\nthroughout the entire investigation\n\n477\n00:26:59,125 --> 00:26:59,715\n>> Yeah, remember,\n\n478\n00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:03,365\none of the things that could very\nwell be included with that report\n\n479\n00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:11,105\nis that your chain of custody forms and\nyour stuff showing you have and you got.\n\n480\n00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,440\nHow you came across certain evidence and\nwhere they can get it.\n\n481\n00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,480\nAnd when you go in the courtroom, then\nthat physical evidence might be there.\n\n482\n00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,560\nI mean, a lot of cases it\nvery well could be there.\n\n483\n00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:29,390\nYour attorney that you're working for\nhas the report there.\n\n484\n00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:34,710\nAnd the other attorney may have it as well\nand then you've got, sitting there, you\n\n485\n00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:40,150\nhave all the evidence that you originally\ncollected and preserved for the scene.\n\n486\n00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,930\nYou could have pictures of\nthe crime scene included.\n\n487\n00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,090\nPictures of the inside.\n\n488\n00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:51,430\nYou can have the videos, if you've\ntaken videos which you probably have.\n\n489\n00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,160\nYou could have the videos there.\n\n490\n00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,220\nSo, those could be watched.\n\n491\n00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:59,750\nSo, you can kind of show that footage\nof what the scene looked like,\n\n492\n00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,900\nwhen you walked through it.\n\n493\n00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,440\nAnd show all those different angles and\nall those things.\n\n494\n00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,500\nIt could have support information like\nthe interview interrogation stuff.\n\n495\n00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,020\nSo, you're looking at quite a bit of\nthings that are supporting documentation.\n\n496\n00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,730\nAnything that's in there that's,\nanything you need to support and\n\n497\n00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,780\ngive more weight to your\nreport needs to be included.\n\n498\n00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,910\nThat would be\na recommendation that you do.\n\n499\n00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,963\nI say recommendation, but,\nI almost want to say it's a requirement\n\n500\n00:28:28,963 --> 00:28:29,474\n>> Right.\n\n501\n00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:33,170\n>> You may find that some of the stuff\nyou went through and processed,\n\n502\n00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,988\nisn't gonna be in there.\n\n503\n00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:39,720\nBut, you at least wanna go through and\nevaluate everything to make sure that yes,\n\n504\n00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,200\nthis is in here, this is in here, this is\nin here, and also throw in by the way,\n\n505\n00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,000\nsome of the stuff that you've done\nduring the course of your investigation.\n\n506\n00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,300\nYou know like those sketches\nthat you may have done\n\n507\n00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,180\nof a floor plan to show\nwhere everything is.\n\n508\n00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,300\nA lot of times those may not\nmake it to the final report or\n\n509\n00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,075\nthey'll be kind of down\nin the order a bit.\n\n510\n00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:02,680\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> What they will do is they'll,\n\n511\n00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,230\na lot of times they will\ntake those sketches and\n\n512\n00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,660\nit's done a lot nowadays where they\nwill take the sketches and convert it.\n\n513\n00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,300\nInto something cleaner,\nlike in a CAD program, or\n\n514\n00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,690\nthey might go ahead and\ndo a video animation with it.\n\n515\n00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,750\nYou see that, they use the pictures,\nthe video you did,\n\n516\n00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:26,560\nplus the sketches all do a video\nrecreation of what that scene look like.\n\n517\n00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,470\nThose are actually pretty fascinating to,\ncuz, those things are, when you\n\n518\n00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:33,610\nsee those videos, those videos, the ones\n[LAUGH] you see on some of these TV shows\n\n519\n00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,355\nthat look like they were developed in\nthe early 90s, they're all blocky.\n\n520\n00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:38,050\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n521\n00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,570\n>> They actually do look like that\nif [LAUGH] you can believe it.\n\n522\n00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,550\nAnd there's a really good reason why.\n\n523\n00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,550\nThe more detail they put in those things,\n\n524\n00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,130\nin those animations to show they\nthought happened on the crime scene.\n\n525\n00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,750\nThe more influences the jury\nto think one way or the other.\n\n526\n00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,480\nThe more photorealistic it is,\nand all that,\n\n527\n00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,410\nthe more you can push a jury one way or\nthe other.\n\n528\n00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,810\nSo they're like, just use a block,\n\n529\n00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:01,910\nor a circle on top of a cylinder,\nto represent a person.\n\n530\n00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,860\nVery simple and easy.\n\n531\n00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,820\nThat's a person, there's no\n>> You don't wanna influence their\n\n532\n00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,990\nthinking skin color, weights, size.\n\n533\n00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,620\n>> Yeah.\n>> Sex, anything like that.\n\n534\n00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,750\n>> Yeah all those things\ncould definitely do it.\n\n535\n00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,690\n>> Yep.\n>> That's been something that they,\n\n536\n00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,510\nI worked in that industry doing\ndigital entertainment and\n\n537\n00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,000\ncomputer animation, stuff like that.\n\n538\n00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,410\nStuff that they used,\nthe equipment that they used to create\n\n539\n00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,400\nthe really big budget blockbusters and\nstuff like that.\n\n540\n00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,160\nThat was one of things that\npeople started asking was can\n\n541\n00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,190\nyou do forensic reconstruction with those?\n\n542\n00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,250\nWell, sure you can and\nyou found out pretty quickly you had to\n\n543\n00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,700\ndial down the realism even though the\nprogram was capable of making something\n\n544\n00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,000\nindistinguishable from real life,\nyou couldn't do that, because as soon as\n\n545\n00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,830\nyou do that, that person has now been\ngetting an emotional connection with it.\n\n546\n00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,790\nSo, that it was simple sketches and\nsimple blocks and\n\n547\n00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:55,838\nstuff like that might be exactly what\nyou're gonna have to put in there and\n\n548\n00:30:55,838 --> 00:30:58,990\nthat we're gonna create stuff off of.\n\n549\n00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,013\n>> Then, I'm good to go because I\ndraw them stick figures all day long.\n\n550\n00:31:02,013 --> 00:31:03,550\n[LAUGH]\n>> You're like Picasso, man.\n\n551\n00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,710\nLet's do it.\n\n552\n00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,270\n>> All right,\nwell looking at the clock ladies and\n\n553\n00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,250\ngentlemen, it's about time for us to take\none of those breaks and go step away.\n\n554\n00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,022\nWe come back, we're gonna continue\ntalking about reports for\n\n555\n00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:13,390\nour forensic investigation.\n\n556\n00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,387\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n557\n00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:20,112\n[MUSIC]\n\n558\n00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:24,465\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n559\n00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:28,654\nSo we're continuing our\ninvestigative reports in our digital\n\n560\n00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:30,780\nforensic episode here.\n\n561\n00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,660\nNext thing we wanna talk about is some\nof the different types of reports that\n\n562\n00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,760\nwe might find or have to produce in\nthe course of our investigation.\n\n563\n00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,540\n>> Yes, there's not just one type of\nreport, though it does tend to be somewhat\n\n564\n00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,500\nof a standardized format as we were\ntalking about in the previous segment.\n\n565\n00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,440\nSo we can kind of mention\nsome of those things but\n\n566\n00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,400\nwe talked about a lot of them already.\n\n567\n00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,300\nThe fact that the form, got the summary.\n\n568\n00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,520\nSupporting details, the evidence, chain\nof custody forms, we've got all that.\n\n569\n00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:06,180\nEvidence collection form, evidence\nworksheets, what text worked on the case.\n\n570\n00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:12,050\nAll those things will be included in\na report in some way, shape, or form.\n\n571\n00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,735\nThat's the big one.\nThat's number one.\n\n572\n00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:16,537\nIf you can get that all concise and\nall worked out,\n\n573\n00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:18,750\nyou're already in pretty good shape.\n\n574\n00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,142\nAnd count on the fact that this\nreport is gonna take awhile.\n\n575\n00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:23,510\nJust because it needs to be proofread.\n\n576\n00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:28,170\nYou should have a peer review it or\n\n577\n00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,781\nhave someone in your lab or someone thats\n\n578\n00:32:32,781 --> 00:32:37,490\ngot access to the case review it,\nto make sure they can follow it,\n\n579\n00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,120\nand have them be brutal, yes,\nhave someone you trust review the thing.\n\n580\n00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,190\n>> Give them a red pen and\nsay, here go to it.\n\n581\n00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:48,130\n>> Yeah, it's definitely the way to go.\n\n582\n00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:55,660\nI have found myself with my experience\nwith writing books, the best feedback\n\n583\n00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,930\nI get is from people I know, and\npeople I tell, hey you know, I trust you.\n\n584\n00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,840\nI trust your opinion.\n\n585\n00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,375\nLet me have it.\n\n586\n00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Just be as brutal,\n\n587\n00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:12,240\nI'm not gonna get my feelings hurt,\nI'd rather have something that works,\n\n588\n00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,610\nis good, is accurate, than have you say,\n\n589\n00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,860\noh well I don't wanna hurt\nyour feelings or anything.\n\n590\n00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,403\n>> Yeah.\n>> Just tear into it.\n\n591\n00:33:18,403 --> 00:33:21,485\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's something that you're looking\n\n592\n00:33:21,485 --> 00:33:22,170\nfor here.\n\n593\n00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:26,550\nMake sure you get someone to review\nit that's gonna give you a no bones,\n\n594\n00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:32,910\nno B.S. opinion on the thing, and\nthen you should be in good shape.\n\n595\n00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,830\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n596\n00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,670\nAnd so,\nduring the course of the investigation,\n\n597\n00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,960\nwe don't wait until the end\nto generate a report.\n\n598\n00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,700\nRight?\nWe're gonnaq be working on it\n\n599\n00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,790\nthroughout the entire process cuz we're\ndocumenting everything we're doing,\n\n600\n00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,280\nevery step of the way.\n\n601\n00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,860\nAnd sometimes we might need to turn in.\n\n602\n00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,810\nOr, they might ask for, hey,\nwhat do you have so far?\n\n603\n00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,890\nAll right\n>> That very well could be, and\n\n604\n00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,590\nthey need to show that\na long way progress,\n\n605\n00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,490\nespecially if it is a particularly long\ninvestigation, which isn't unheard of,\n\n606\n00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,810\nyou may need to have points\nwhere you turn stuff in.\n\n607\n00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:07,230\nIn fact it is not unheard of in\ncases to have certain milestones or\n\n608\n00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:12,090\nmarkers being set where if you get to\na certain stage, you have to update, or\n\n609\n00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:17,140\nbrief, whoever it is, on your progress and\nwhat you've found so far.\n\n610\n00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:22,190\nCuz they may have certain things that\nthey need to know to be able to tell you,\n\n611\n00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,250\nokay, let's change what we're\ngonna do in the next phase here.\n\n612\n00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,840\nCan you take a look at this?\n\n613\n00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,080\nOr you may find out\nduring your first phase,\n\n614\n00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,760\nthere's other things you\nneed to investigate.\n\n615\n00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,860\nAnd now you need to have permission or\nanother warrant or\n\n616\n00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,270\nsomething else filed to go that direction.\n\n617\n00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,391\nSo you're gonna want to establish\nthose things but yes, you're right.\n\n618\n00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:43,946\nYou should be keeping track\nof everything as you go and\n\n619\n00:34:43,946 --> 00:34:49,318\nwe been very careful about that, I know it\nmay have sounded like during the course\n\n620\n00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:54,625\nof this that we were saying, oh well\nthey're gonna talk about log files again.\n\n621\n00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,743\nOh they're gonna talk about [LAUGH] this\nagain or talking about procedure again.\n\n622\n00:34:58,743 --> 00:35:04,711\nA lot of being a forensic investigator\nis not just going into the lab and\n\n623\n00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:10,470\ndoing all this stuff,\nit is documenting, following process.\n\n624\n00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:14,200\nGetting all those things lined up so\nyou can do the presentation.\n\n625\n00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,460\nThat's the tough part.\n\n626\n00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,240\nIf it was just going through and\nplaying with some toys.\n\n627\n00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,850\nYou know, really,\nanybody can figure that out.\n\n628\n00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:26,300\nIt's the actual following a process\nthat is gonna be the tough part.\n\n629\n00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,210\nSo if you want to save yourself some time,\n\n630\n00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,270\nwhen you're documenting everything,\nalways have a mind towards,\n\n631\n00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,380\nhow you're gonna include this in\na report and keep it organized.\n\n632\n00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,780\nYou're gonna have to be very\norganized to do this job.\n\n633\n00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,100\nIt's just a fact of life.\n\n634\n00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,200\nYou're not organized, you're not doing it.\n\n635\n00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,620\nOr you won't be doing it for that long.\n\n636\n00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,348\nI guess is another way to put it.\n\n637\n00:35:46,348 --> 00:35:50,188\nSo just keep that in mind,\nyou're gonna be working towards that.\n\n638\n00:35:50,188 --> 00:35:54,092\n>> Yeah, and that preliminary, if I can\nsay that, that preliminary report could,\n\n639\n00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:56,710\nas you said,\nchange the course of the investigation.\n\n640\n00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,840\nIt might be like, okay, at this point\nwe have found no evidence to support\n\n641\n00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,600\nour case, and maybe the case gets dropped,\nor as you said maybe it changes direction,\n\n642\n00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,880\nor brings somebody else into light\nthat they hadn't seen before.\n\n643\n00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,600\nSo that preliminary gives them a chance\nto see where the case is going,\n\n644\n00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,540\nmake sure it's on track, and\nit's progressing the way they want, or\n\n645\n00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,830\nthey might need to\nchange their strategies.\n\n646\n00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,340\nAnd it's not always a written report,\nright?\n\n647\n00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,930\n>> Not always a written report.\n\n648\n00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,245\nAnd Mikayla's right, this is your calling.\n\n649\n00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:25,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right here.\n\n650\n00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:30,265\nI already said early on,\nif when I get one of these big,\n\n651\n00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:32,310\nbig cases that need documentation on.\n\n652\n00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,945\n[LAUGH] You're hired.\n\n653\n00:36:33,945 --> 00:36:37,385\nThat's it, I'm bringing you over so\nyou don't get a choice in the matter.\n\n654\n00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:41,375\nCause I know it'll be really\njust awesome documentation.\n\n655\n00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:46,385\nSo anyway, but\nyeah you said it's not documentation isn't\n\n656\n00:36:46,385 --> 00:36:51,640\nalways gonna be, or\nyour report isn't always gonna be.\n\n657\n00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,930\nIn a written form.\n\n658\n00:36:52,930 --> 00:37:01,930\nIt very well could be a verbal\npresentation, so be prepared for that.\n\n659\n00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:07,270\nIt could be verbal, it could be written,\nand a lot of times so\n\n660\n00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:13,480\nfar we've been geared more towards\nthe written side of things rather than\n\n661\n00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,780\ngoing towards the verbal side of things,\nbut it very well can be.\n\n662\n00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,450\nAnd then you have on top\nsub categories of that.\n\n663\n00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,980\nIs it a formal one?\n\n664\n00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,260\nOr is it an informal one?\n\n665\n00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,108\nAnd if you think about that,\n\n666\n00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:31,886\nthey do kind of explain themselves just\nby the term of formal or informal.\n\n667\n00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:35,400\nFormal one is gonna be\nmuch more structured,\n\n668\n00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,015\nmuch more clinical in\nhow you move through it.\n\n669\n00:37:39,015 --> 00:37:44,200\nThere are going certain format that\neven if it is verbal that you follow,\n\n670\n00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,130\nyou can count on a formal one probably\nbeing done with a group of people\n\n671\n00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,615\nthat are involved in the case,\nlike attorneys,\n\n672\n00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:57,740\nif it's a corporate one,\nhuman resources would be there.\n\n673\n00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,100\nMaybe the CEOs there.\n\n674\n00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,900\nIt could be all those things.\n\n675\n00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,150\nIf it's informal it might just\nbe to a few selected people.\n\n676\n00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,460\nIt might be a little more free form.\n\n677\n00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,910\nIt might be just kind of\na discussion type thing.\n\n678\n00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,080\nThat's the way those ones occur.\n\n679\n00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,550\nSo expect either one.\n\n680\n00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,900\nSame thing with the written, formal,\n\n681\n00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,300\nit's gonna have more of\na structure be more concise.\n\n682\n00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:23,420\nInformal, it's gonna kinda be like\nan impromptu briefing sort of.\n\n683\n00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:31,020\nIt's not meant to be something that's\ngoing to be obey every rule to the letter.\n\n684\n00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,330\nIt's just free form like someone asking\nyour opinion or what you found so\n\n685\n00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:39,010\nfar and you just give them kind of like a\nquick summary of this is what I've found.\n\n686\n00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,160\nOkay we're good.\n\n687\n00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,970\n>> Almost like a draft if you would for\nan English paper.\n\n688\n00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:42,550\n>> You could say that.\n\n689\n00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,520\n>> Right where you've\nbeen working on it and\n\n690\n00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,250\nit's not that you just willy\nnilly it anyway you want it.\n\n691\n00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,560\nI mean you're trying to get it ready for\nthat final.\n\n692\n00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,020\nBut it's not polished yet, it might not\nbe exactly the way it's gonna need to be\n\n693\n00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,790\nwhen you present it in court,\nor present it in the end.\n\n694\n00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,950\nBut they just need to look at it right\nnow, let's see what you've got so\n\n695\n00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,800\nfar kind of thing.\n\n696\n00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,390\n>> Yeah,\nthat would be another great way to put it,\n\n697\n00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,620\nis that it is like a first draft in a way.\n\n698\n00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:09,240\nYou know because it's not something\nthat's meant to be for your consumption,\n\n699\n00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,030\nfor public consumption.\n\n700\n00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:15,440\nThere are some foreign ones\nthat are passed around to make\n\n701\n00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,840\nsure that people are on the same page.\n\n702\n00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,550\nDo a status check, that sort of stuff.\n\n703\n00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:24,790\nThe informal ones are gonna take longer to\nproduce and they're also gonna something\n\n704\n00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:28,070\nthat is structured, and\nit probably could be under.\n\n705\n00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:32,600\nIf everything's okay and have been\nchecked, it could be presented later on,\n\n706\n00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,860\nand analyzed later on.\n\n707\n00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:40,020\nSo, you gotta think of which one is most\nappropriate, or which one's called for.\n\n708\n00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,910\nI would also add onto it,\nwhen you look at these verbal ones,\n\n709\n00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,060\nwhether they're formal or informal.\n\n710\n00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:52,110\nIt's something that you should also\nmake a habit of doing documentation,\n\n711\n00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,940\nand taking notes, that that did happen.\n\n712\n00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,510\nYou know?\n\n713\n00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,071\nEven if it's after the fact.\n\n714\n00:39:57,071 --> 00:40:00,505\nThat's something that I\nwould encourage you to do,\n\n715\n00:40:00,505 --> 00:40:04,328\nyou've worked in those environments too,\nwhere it's,\n\n716\n00:40:04,328 --> 00:40:09,086\ndon't just have someone go, okay,\nhey, this is what needs to be done,\n\n717\n00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:12,929\nyou give them a briefing on it and\nthat's it, it's gone.\n\n718\n00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:18,062\nNo, it really should be documented\nlater on just for safety's sake,\n\n719\n00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:23,460\njust to show that that event did occur,\nand we're good and ready to go on.\n\n720\n00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,470\nSo, that's something that\nI would strongly advise.\n\n721\n00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,650\n>> And we talk about the details of\nthe report, one of the first things that\n\n722\n00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,847\nyou mention is PDFs being one of\nthe preferred formats for the reports.\n\n723\n00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:37,230\n>> Yeah, that is definitely\none of the things you wanna\n\n724\n00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:41,713\nremember is that PDF has\nbecome a universal format for\n\n725\n00:40:41,713 --> 00:40:45,710\nexchanging documents for\na number of reasons.\n\n726\n00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:52,270\nPDF gives you an advantage of making\nsomething not editable, not printable.\n\n727\n00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,580\nYou can also password it.\n\n728\n00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,097\nAnd, yes, I'm well aware that\nyou can crack those things.\n\n729\n00:40:57,097 --> 00:40:58,309\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n730\n00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:00,336\nwe're not factoring that in right now.\n\n731\n00:41:00,336 --> 00:41:04,169\nIt's just something that we're,\nwe have something that's not editable.\n\n732\n00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:08,160\nAnd you can put other types of things on.\n\n733\n00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,630\nAnd we know everyone can read it.\n\n734\n00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,310\nYou can read on just about\nany type of device out there.\n\n735\n00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,960\nThere's a PDF reader for it so\nthat's become kind of the standard.\n\n736\n00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,710\nWhat you wanna avoid doing is\ngiving out like a word file.\n\n737\n00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,620\nAnd doing that, and spreading that around.\n\n738\n00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,740\nBecause, who knows, someone\ncould've altered it after the fact.\n\n739\n00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,210\nYou've given them something that they\ncan monkey around with and do stuff.\n\n740\n00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,300\nYou don't want that.\n\n741\n00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,605\nYou say, this is the final report,\nor the report as it is right now.\n\n742\n00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:36,235\nPDF, boom, it goes out.\n\n743\n00:41:36,235 --> 00:41:41,155\nIf there needs to be alterations to it or\nsomething ,you can do that yourself or\n\n744\n00:41:41,155 --> 00:41:43,325\nhave someone on your team do it perhaps.\n\n745\n00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:46,825\nBut it's restricted to who\ncan actually make the edits.\n\n746\n00:41:46,825 --> 00:41:49,305\n>> And\nwe don't send this in to the courtroom?\n\n747\n00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:51,595\n>> No, that's something that we've said,\n\n748\n00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:55,570\nit's something that can\nbe presented in court.\n\n749\n00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:00,408\nIt doesn't in any way, shape or form\nmean that you've got your report sitting\n\n750\n00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:04,316\nhere and you're done with it and\nsaying, okay, this is fine.\n\n751\n00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:07,404\nAnd then, go ahead and\njust send it to the court directly.\n\n752\n00:42:07,404 --> 00:42:09,505\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That doesn't happen.\n\n753\n00:42:09,505 --> 00:42:16,230\nThat goes to your client, like your\nattorney, that maybe hired you to do this.\n\n754\n00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:21,170\nIt goes to them, and then they're\nthe ones that digest that information and\n\n755\n00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,580\nsit with you and figure out what that's\ngoing, and what it's saying, and\n\n756\n00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,910\nget it in plain english if they need to.\n\n757\n00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:31,610\nThey do all that, but it absolutely does\nnot get submitted directly to the court.\n\n758\n00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:37,506\nOther things that will happen is not\nonly do you present it to your attorney,\n\n759\n00:42:37,506 --> 00:42:42,643\nit could be requested that you may inform\nthe court that you have the reports done,\n\n760\n00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:46,162\nor the attorney might say that yes,\nwe've got this in.\n\n761\n00:42:46,162 --> 00:42:51,097\nBut you want to present the actual report\nto them, but the other guys could say,\n\n762\n00:42:51,097 --> 00:42:53,600\nhey, we want a copy of that report too.\n\n763\n00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,220\nThey are entitled to have that report,\nso then you'd supply it to them.\n\n764\n00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:02,690\n>> So, we don't send the only copy\nwe have over to our attorney or\n\n765\n00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,195\nto the company or\nwhoever it is requesting the information,\n\n766\n00:43:05,195 --> 00:43:08,540\nwe wanna make sure we have more\nthan one copy of this report.\n\n767\n00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,100\n>> Yes.\n\n768\n00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,720\nYou always keep the original and\nthe copies goes to everyone else.\n\n769\n00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,620\nAnd there's really no\nquestion on that at all.\n\n770\n00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,210\n>> Which gives us the ability to check if\nthey try to produce a copy of my report\n\n771\n00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:24,736\nthat is altered in some way, I've got\nthat original, we can run them through.\n\n772\n00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:27,037\nMost likely,\nwe sign that documents anyway,\n\n773\n00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:30,636\nthose PDFs are real easy to add a digital\nsignature to, so we can verify or\n\n774\n00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:33,064\nprove that it's been\nmodified if you we need to.\n\n775\n00:43:33,064 --> 00:43:37,686\n>> Yeah, that is an important detail,\neven Michaela puts in here,\n\n776\n00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:41,227\nshould we strip metadata\nfrom the report as well?\n\n777\n00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:45,777\nYeah, you can if you're concerned\nabout that, but they know that [LAUGH]\n\n778\n00:43:45,777 --> 00:43:50,128\nyou're the one that produced it,\nyour name and everything is on it.\n\n779\n00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,845\nAnd It's so-\n>> In fact,\n\n780\n00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:53,995\nit might be a good thing to have\nthat in there in some cases.\n\n781\n00:43:53,995 --> 00:43:58,395\n>> Yeah, you might wanna consider if it's\nsomething that's worth stripping out.\n\n782\n00:43:58,395 --> 00:44:00,560\nI'm almost gonna say for\nsomething like this, no.\n\n783\n00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,739\nI mean, you really don't have\nanything to hide at all.\n\n784\n00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:06,702\n>> You're not the criminal in this case.\n\n785\n00:44:06,702 --> 00:44:08,872\nIn fact, you probably wanna prove\nthat you're the one that did all\n\n786\n00:44:08,872 --> 00:44:09,430\nthat hard work.\n\n787\n00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:14,392\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that could be it too.\n\n788\n00:44:14,392 --> 00:44:20,311\nI wouldn't say you have to, but\nI'm not gonna go as far to say that, yeah,\n\n789\n00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:24,551\nyou should, but who knows, there might\nbe situations where you wanna do that.\n\n790\n00:44:24,551 --> 00:44:26,741\nThere's nothing saying you can't,\n\n791\n00:44:26,741 --> 00:44:31,670\nI just of the top of my head,\ndon't see a good reason to do it.\n\n792\n00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:34,836\n>> Unless you're afraid the Mafia Don is\ngonna find out who the investigator was\n\n793\n00:44:34,836 --> 00:44:35,713\nfor the forensics and\n\n794\n00:44:35,713 --> 00:44:38,649\nthey're gonna send a hit squad after\nyou maybe or something like that.\n\n795\n00:44:38,649 --> 00:44:41,343\n>> Yeah, my reports I call myself David.\n\n796\n00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,167\n>> Yeah.\n\n797\n00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:46,081\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] Sorry David.\n\n798\n00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:51,090\n>> We should avoid jargon,\nwe've kind of talked about that as well.\n\n799\n00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:55,550\n>> Yeah, that can be a very tough one for\na lot of us.\n\n800\n00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:03,211\nI know probably every one of the members\nof our audience, I know we do it,\n\n801\n00:45:03,211 --> 00:45:08,195\nevery field has this jargon that\nthey'll throw around and make up.\n\n802\n00:45:08,195 --> 00:45:12,890\nAnd people outside the field are going,\nwhat the heck are they talking about?\n\n803\n00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,643\nIt is gonna happen here and\n\n804\n00:45:14,643 --> 00:45:18,476\nyou are gonna wanna try to\navoid that as much as possible.\n\n805\n00:45:18,476 --> 00:45:21,294\nIf you absolutely have\nto include the jargon,\n\n806\n00:45:21,294 --> 00:45:25,629\nthan the first time you use it in that\ndocument, it should be defined and\n\n807\n00:45:25,629 --> 00:45:28,247\nthen it should also have a glossary for\nit.\n\n808\n00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:31,690\n>> [COUGH]\n>> Simple rules of the road.\n\n809\n00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,850\n>> Which brings us to our next point,\n\n810\n00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:36,940\nyou wanna make sure you are defining any\nacronyms you use, any terms that might not\n\n811\n00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:41,040\nbe common knowledge, which in our case,\nis a lot of them typically.\n\n812\n00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,934\n>> Yeah, there's gonna be a lot\nof acronyms and terms and\n\n813\n00:45:44,934 --> 00:45:49,433\nstuff like that used during\nthe course of this investigation.\n\n814\n00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:53,292\n>> [COUGH]\n>> And it may be acronyms and\n\n815\n00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:57,480\nterms that you even think\nare common knowledge.\n\n816\n00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,840\nIt may not be [LAUGH],\nit may be a situation where they're not.\n\n817\n00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:07,514\nThey're still people that you gotta say,\nthey'll ask what USB is.\n\n818\n00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,350\n>> Yeah.\n\n819\n00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:11,345\n>> We all know what USB is but\nno one's going.\n\n820\n00:46:11,345 --> 00:46:14,254\n>> Who doesn't know what that is and\nthen, you get six jurors raise their hand.\n\n821\n00:46:14,254 --> 00:46:14,835\n>> Yeah.\n\n822\n00:46:14,835 --> 00:46:19,147\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You just don't get that and\n\n823\n00:46:19,147 --> 00:46:25,322\ntelling someone or\nputting in a report HDD.\n\n824\n00:46:25,322 --> 00:46:28,922\nWhat IT person or\ntech person doesn't know what this is?\n\n825\n00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:33,752\nBut there's probably some and then\nthere's definitely people outside that.\n\n826\n00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,757\nIf you said just HD,\nyou see it shortened to it, they're like,\n\n827\n00:46:37,757 --> 00:46:39,201\nwhat's my TV got to do with it?\n\n828\n00:46:39,201 --> 00:46:39,909\n>> Yeah.\n\n829\n00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:41,570\n[LAUGH]\n>> They just won't know.\n\n830\n00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:46,360\nSo, it's also by the way to\nkind of throw that in there\n\n831\n00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,680\nis that I said HD and\nthen the TV and all that.\n\n832\n00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,330\nRemember something I mentioned early on.\n\n833\n00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:57,070\nOne of the things about defining jargon.\n\n834\n00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,250\nAnd it's making sure\neveryone's on the same page.\n\n835\n00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:04,490\nBecause there are things that are reused,\nterms or acronyms and jargon\n\n836\n00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:08,380\nthat are reused in different industries\nand they do not mean the same thing.\n\n837\n00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,270\nThey mean something entirely different.\n\n838\n00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:16,710\nI was talking about the one with,\nWhat the police say cover me means.\n\n839\n00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:20,140\nAnd what the military says cover me means,\nit's two different actions there,\n\n840\n00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,598\nit's the same term but\ntwo different actions.\n\n841\n00:47:22,598 --> 00:47:26,170\nSo, you wanna make sure that\neveryone is on the same page, so\n\n842\n00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:28,300\nthat's another big benefit of it.\n\n843\n00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,112\n>> And then, we talk about including\nour opinions in these reports.\n\n844\n00:47:31,112 --> 00:47:33,930\nWe wanna make sure our opinions\nhave something to stand on.\n\n845\n00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,047\nThat we're not just pulling\nit out of our you know what.\n\n846\n00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:40,970\n>> Yeah, always make sure your\nopinions are based on facts.\n\n847\n00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:44,230\nCite your facts wherever necessary.\n\n848\n00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:50,166\nAll those things you see and\nyou know different articles online and\n\n849\n00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:55,042\nnot that I'm gonna use them\nas the definitive thing for\n\n850\n00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:59,711\nthis but\njust about everyone's been to Wikipedia.\n\n851\n00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:02,498\nYou know how you got to the bottom\nof a Wikipedia article,\n\n852\n00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:04,889\nit's got all the references cited,\nor should.\n\n853\n00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:06,100\nYou should.\n\n854\n00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:11,362\nDo not be afraid and you very well\nshould do that, these are my facts.\n\n855\n00:48:11,362 --> 00:48:15,030\nAnd then you can actually\ninclude in the foot notes,\n\n856\n00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:17,500\nthese are the parts of the reports\nwhere I got these from.\n\n857\n00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,260\nSo they can go back and reference them,\nor they can reference outside articles if\n\n858\n00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:26,710\nthey need to, or scientific papers\nto support that if it requires.\n\n859\n00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:30,050\n>> And then the report needs as,\nwe've said again, and we've already talked\n\n860\n00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:34,160\nearlier is, it's gotta have a proper\nlayout, it's gotta have good flow to it.\n\n861\n00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,730\nWe don't want it to be all jumbled around,\nwhere they have to look for\n\n862\n00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,040\nthat information.\n\n863\n00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:45,420\n>> Yeah, there needs to be,\nno matter what report format you use,\n\n864\n00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,150\neven if you make up your own, you wanna\nhave something that just makes sense.\n\n865\n00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:54,570\nThere's a nice logical flow\nthat someone can follow.\n\n866\n00:48:54,570 --> 00:49:00,920\nThat's one of the main things we have or\nreasons we use, a template or\n\n867\n00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,452\na format in the first place, is because it\ngives us a nice, consistent, logical flow.\n\n868\n00:49:05,452 --> 00:49:10,790\nThey wanna see things in a certain way,\nand so make sure that you follow that.\n\n869\n00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:15,450\nIf you don't have the luxury\nof having a format to find for\n\n870\n00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:18,540\nyou then,\nbecause you may be doing corporate stuff.\n\n871\n00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,390\nYou may never step foot in the courtroom,\n\n872\n00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,910\nyou may be doing entirely forensic\nstuff for an individual company.\n\n873\n00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:29,850\nIf that is the case, they may not\nhave a format at all or template.\n\n874\n00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:32,740\nSo now you are like,\nwell, what do I do now?\n\n875\n00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,380\nWell, look at the things that you\nshould have report, your summary,\n\n876\n00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,870\nyour evidence, and conclusions, and\nfacts, and your opinions, all that.\n\n877\n00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:45,910\nAnd put them together in such a way that\nit's easy to follow and makes sense.\n\n878\n00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:49,740\nAnd then just keep reusing that format,\ndon't make it up every time,\n\n879\n00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,670\nstandardize the format and\ngo on from there.\n\n880\n00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:57,280\n>> All right, and then we conclude some\nvisuals in our reports as well, right?\n\n881\n00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,090\n>> Yeah, visuals, tables, graphs,\n\n882\n00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:05,000\nnone of that stuff hurts at all,\nit's always good to have that.\n\n883\n00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,850\nOne of the jokes I used to make when\nI worked in the corporate world,\n\n884\n00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:15,490\nis that the charts and graphs were for\nthe managers, managers view.\n\n885\n00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,695\nI can distract them from\nwhatever else was in that report.\n\n886\n00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:19,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just by using more colors and\n\n887\n00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,200\npie charts.\n\n888\n00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,060\nThey're like, oh, well, that looks good,\nwe're moving paradigms around or\n\n889\n00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,015\nsomething, they didn't know\nwhat they were talking about.\n\n890\n00:50:27,015 --> 00:50:28,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was easy for\n\n891\n00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,130\nme to do those things.\n\n892\n00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:34,150\nBut the thing is, is here,\nwhen you're doing forensics,\n\n893\n00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:39,300\nthat's just another way of helping them\nunderstand and process the information.\n\n894\n00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,900\nWe tend to be very visual as human beings,\nso having way different ways to\n\n895\n00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,460\ncompare stuff and visualizing\ninformation should always be there.\n\n896\n00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,980\nAnd that even includes stuff outside of\nthis stuff, like if you have a formula or\n\n897\n00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,760\nsomething you use.\n\n898\n00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,600\nThat's not unheard of to have\n\n899\n00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:01,570\nformulas used to figure out certain\nthings, put the formula in there.\n\n900\n00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:05,530\nIn most word processing programs,\n\n901\n00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:10,700\nyou have a way to actually embed\na formula into the actual page.\n\n902\n00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,150\nIf you can't do it that way,\ndraw it out in something else,\n\n903\n00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,580\nyou don't need to be an artist.\n\n904\n00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:18,130\nDraw it out and paste it into\nthe document, so they can see,\n\n905\n00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:23,370\nokay, I can see what the formula they\nused, what the relationships are.\n\n906\n00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:27,530\nIt's just helping them digest\nthe information quicker, better, and\n\n907\n00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,950\nmaking sure there's as little\nambiguity in there as possible.\n\n908\n00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,530\n>> Yeah, visual representations\nof data is always good,\n\n909\n00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:37,920\ncuz it gives you a quick summary that\nmost people can digest really quickly.\n\n910\n00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,120\nAnd sometimes,\nyou guys have all made reports.\n\n911\n00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,420\nIf I start putting facts and\n\n912\n00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:46,930\nfigures in a paragraph, it can be very\ndifficult to grasp the information.\n\n913\n00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:50,380\nBut as soon as I put it in a bar\nchart that's got one bar here, and\n\n914\n00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,950\none bar way up here,\nthe difference is very apparent.\n\n915\n00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:56,350\nSo getting that visual representation\ndefinitely helps, especially if we're\n\n916\n00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:00,560\ngonna present it in a court room, or\nthe defense attorneys, or prosecutors are.\n\n917\n00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,130\nThat can be a big help\nwith the juror's as well.\n\n918\n00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,710\nWe've got a good question\nin the chat room.\n\n919\n00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:09,070\nOne of the things we talked about was\nalways time stamping, everything we do.\n\n920\n00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:13,130\nAnd so, do we wanna make a timeline for\nour reports?\n\n921\n00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,120\n>> Yeah, there should be.\n\n922\n00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,980\nThat should be right at\nthe top of the document, and\n\n923\n00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,930\nif there's any variations in date that go\nthrough at the time the incident occurred,\n\n924\n00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:26,160\nor based on your evidence,\nwhen you thought it occurred.\n\n925\n00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,522\nAnything like that,\nthat should be included.\n\n926\n00:52:28,522 --> 00:52:31,160\nYou're gonna already have down the list,\n\n927\n00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,400\nyou're gonna have a chain\nof custody in there.\n\n928\n00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:42,250\nIf you have to send stuff out to other\nlabs potentially, maybe you don't have\n\n929\n00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:47,360\na boss or work for a lab that's gonna\nbuy you some of these fancy gadgets.\n\n930\n00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,970\nYou're showing that one before lunch that,\nthat one for mobile phones.\n\n931\n00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:57,700\nYeah, we found out that one for\ncell phones, that cell deck,\n\n932\n00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:02,832\nthat was 20 grand brand new,\nso start saving.\n\n933\n00:53:02,832 --> 00:53:04,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You may have\n\n934\n00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,870\nto farm out stuff like that.\n\n935\n00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:10,520\nWhen that went out and\nwhen it came back should be in there.\n\n936\n00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,270\nSo, yeah, a timeline of a report\ndefinitely should be in there,\n\n937\n00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,000\nshould be clearly documented.\n\n938\n00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,430\nI would say in some reports, you'll even\nhave a box right across the top saying,\n\n939\n00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:25,051\nwho created the report,\nwho did this, and blah blah blah.\n\n940\n00:53:25,051 --> 00:53:29,150\nAnd say timeline, case numbers, and all\nthose things will be right clearly there.\n\n941\n00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,303\nSo when someone's flipping through or\nwhatever.\n\n942\n00:53:31,303 --> 00:53:32,460\nBoom, right there.\n\n943\n00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,500\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n944\n00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,390\nAnd then if we have an additional stuff\nwe wanna include with the report,\n\n945\n00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:40,250\nwe can include attachments and\nthings like that as well, right?\n\n946\n00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:46,730\n>> Attachments, I saw MaKayla asked about\nthings, would you have appendixes in this?\n\n947\n00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:49,870\nYeah, if you need them, go for\nit, they should be in there.\n\n948\n00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:56,620\nIf you need to attach additional photos,\nevidence, whatever you think is gonna\n\n949\n00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:01,630\nneed to be used during that report,\nthen it should be attached as an appendix.\n\n950\n00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:07,340\nIf I was supervising you and advising you,\nI would suggest that you do exactly that.\n\n951\n00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:13,880\nThat you have an appendix a, and appendix\nb, whatever you need, keep doing it.\n\n952\n00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,290\nThere's been reports that\nmight be a hundred pages for\n\n953\n00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,190\nthe actual main body of the report.\n\n954\n00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,050\nAnd you might have 300 pages\nworth of appendices in there.\n\n955\n00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,170\n>> Yeah, you might cite\nreferences in your report but\n\n956\n00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,360\nif it's an especially important reference.\n\n957\n00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,440\nYou might include whatever it is\nyour referring to as an appendix in\n\n958\n00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,570\nyour report.\n\n959\n00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,080\n>> Yeah.\n>> And if it's an article,\n\n960\n00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,040\nsome technical document or a spec sheet\non a device or something like that,\n\n961\n00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,440\nthat could very well go back there.\n\n962\n00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:45,990\n>> Yeah, and there's literally no\nlimit on the amount of appendices or\n\n963\n00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:51,710\nattachments you can put on there, there's\ndifferent ways of handling reports.\n\n964\n00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:54,530\nLike I said, I've seen reports that\nare very short in the main body and\n\n965\n00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:55,670\nthe rest of everything else.\n\n966\n00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:02,100\nThe individual sections are all stuck\nin as appendices or attachments.\n\n967\n00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,050\nIn fact, one of the ones they say\nit's interesting little trivia thing,\n\n968\n00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:09,060\nthey say the d-day invasion.\n\n969\n00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,805\nThis is a good weekend for it,\n\n970\n00:55:10,805 --> 00:55:16,180\n70 years since the end of the second\nworld war is that they said.\n\n971\n00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,070\nThe report for the plan for\n\n972\n00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:22,670\nthe d-day invasion was actually one page,\nall the other stuff was attachments.\n\n973\n00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:27,440\nEisenhower and his staff, one page,\n\n974\n00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,380\nthen they had like thousands of\npages of attachments that describe\n\n975\n00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:36,450\nevery little operation, eventuality, and\ntroop movement, everything in there.\n\n976\n00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:41,050\nSo, may seem unusual to have something\nlike that, why would they do it like that?\n\n977\n00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:45,250\nThat was the best way to do it, you can\ndistribute the appendices as necessary.\n\n978\n00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,962\nSo there you go.\n\n979\n00:55:46,962 --> 00:55:48,960\n>> All right, so\n\n980\n00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,970\nSean I think you got a couple sample\nreports we might take a look at.\n\n981\n00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:54,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> So we can visualize this ourselves.\n\n982\n00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:59,008\n>> Yeah, let me now show you a quick and\ndirty sample report on my screen.\n\n983\n00:55:59,008 --> 00:56:04,144\nThis is just one that I got off one\nof the US government's websites for,\n\n984\n00:56:04,144 --> 00:56:08,338\nthat they were talking about things for\nForensics, and so\n\n985\n00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:13,150\nwhat this has is this has as lot of\nthings that we just talked about.\n\n986\n00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:17,220\nIf you look at it,\nat this case brief, what is this?\n\n987\n00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,970\nThis case brief tells us what happened,\n\n988\n00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:25,160\nwhat the summary of what was\nactually occurring there.\n\n989\n00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,290\nThen, you start going down\nto see the objective,\n\n990\n00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:33,030\nsaying did they possess,\nin this case, this content.\n\n991\n00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:36,770\nAnd so, we go through,\nwe have the computer type.\n\n992\n00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,880\nLook at the way they've\ndocumented this too.\n\n993\n00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,390\nComputer type, laptop, serial number.\n\n994\n00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:42,950\nThey put a serial number in there so\n\n995\n00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,585\nyou know specifically what\npiece of evidence this is.\n\n996\n00:56:45,585 --> 00:56:49,505\nThe operating system,\nwhat the offense was, who's working on it?\n\n997\n00:56:49,505 --> 00:56:51,105\nSo, you just keep going through this.\n\n998\n00:56:51,105 --> 00:56:52,515\nChain of custody, well, there you go.\n\n999\n00:56:52,515 --> 00:56:54,255\nThere's your attachment right there.\n\n1000\n00:56:54,255 --> 00:56:55,955\nIt's saying you wanna see\na chain of custody form?\n\n1001\n00:56:55,955 --> 00:57:01,465\nIt's not in the main body of this report,\nit is stuck in as an attachment.\n\n1002\n00:57:01,465 --> 00:57:03,255\nIt tells you, there you go, tools used,\n\n1003\n00:57:03,255 --> 00:57:07,180\nwhat did you use to carry\nout your investigation?\n\n1004\n00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:12,830\nAnd then, it goes through, here's how\nthe processing took place, the assessment.\n\n1005\n00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,705\nSo, there's the search\nwarrant part we talked about.\n\n1006\n00:57:15,705 --> 00:57:18,510\nWe've talked about those several\ntimes during this course.\n\n1007\n00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,150\nThere's the search warrant.\n\n1008\n00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:24,560\nSo, it tells us, okay, here's what we\ndid to constraint the search warrant.\n\n1009\n00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,430\nHow you acquired the information?\n\n1010\n00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,390\nThey documented\nthe hardware configuration.\n\n1011\n00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:32,720\nAnd they tell you right there,\nthey duplicated the hard drive.\n\n1012\n00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,470\nThey're telling you the exact step.\n\n1013\n00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:35,780\nThis is what we did.\n\n1014\n00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:38,220\nThen they tell you how\nthey examined everything.\n\n1015\n00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:44,350\nThey looked at file headers, something\nthat we saw a couple episodes ago.\n\n1016\n00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:49,060\nAnd then, documentation, next steps, and\nthey just keep going right on through\n\n1017\n00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,450\nthis report, and\nthen they even have other things.\n\n1018\n00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,480\nHere's the media analysis.\n\n1019\n00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:00,830\nSo, we've got additional things that\nwe pulled off the media itself.\n\n1020\n00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:04,604\nSo, this went to someone else,\nit went to, in this case,\n\n1021\n00:58:04,604 --> 00:58:08,534\nit's being reported to the Sheriff's\noffice to tell them if\n\n1022\n00:58:08,534 --> 00:58:12,820\nthese are the files we have,\njust going right on through.\n\n1023\n00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:17,500\nI mean, just look at how\ndetailed this thing actually is.\n\n1024\n00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,440\nAnd this is just a minor amount of detail.\n\n1025\n00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,810\nThis is just a sample report, remember.\n\n1026\n00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,522\nAnd then,\nthere's a glossary with one thing in it.\n\n1027\n00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:30,510\nThere's who signed it.\n\n1028\n00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:31,358\nI'm D examiner.\n\n1029\n00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:32,496\n>> [LAUGH] I'm a D examiner.\n\n1030\n00:58:32,496 --> 00:58:35,143\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I'm a digital examiner [SOUND].\n\n1031\n00:58:35,143 --> 00:58:38,220\n>> So,\nI think that's the last of piece of it.\n\n1032\n00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,310\nI think they actually have two\nreports in here, but yeah,\n\n1033\n00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,670\nI don't need to go into the second one.\n\n1034\n00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:47,250\nBut you can see there was\na very logical format there.\n\n1035\n00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:51,595\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, there you go.\n\n1036\n00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:55,800\nYou've got a very logical step to step.\n\n1037\n00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,390\n>> And it was nice and\nconcise and to the point,\n\n1038\n00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,800\nthere wasn't a lot of\nextra fluff in there.\n\n1039\n00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,910\nJust by reading the first few\nparagraphs there on the screen,\n\n1040\n00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:07,440\nI got a sense of what the case\nwas about and where it was going.\n\n1041\n00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,790\nSo, it was just very, very nice and tidy.\n\n1042\n00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:10,430\nI like that.\n\n1043\n00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:13,600\n>> Yeah, that's the way it should be,\nthat's what you're looking for.\n\n1044\n00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:19,800\nAnd let me tell your, probably, a good\nnumber of you, I'm sure Michaela has.\n\n1045\n00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,415\nThere's no doubt about this.\n\n1046\n00:59:21,415 --> 00:59:23,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm sure she's written up some reports.\n\n1047\n00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,131\nCan you provide some\nsamples to us Michaela?\n\n1048\n00:59:25,131 --> 00:59:27,971\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm pretty sure everyone wants to see\n\n1049\n00:59:27,971 --> 00:59:29,658\nwhat a good report looks like.\n\n1050\n00:59:29,658 --> 00:59:35,655\nBut one of the toughest things about\nwriting a report like this is removing\n\n1051\n00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:42,900\nyour opinion from it\nuntil explicitly needed.\n\n1052\n00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,990\nThat is a really,\nreally tough thing to do.\n\n1053\n00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,670\nIt takes practice.\n\n1054\n00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:54,420\nThat's why you have someone read this for\n\n1055\n00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:58,810\nyou and have them see,\nis this an opinion or\n\n1056\n00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:02,470\nam I including my opinion in any place,\nor am I missing something?\n\n1057\n01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:03,990\nWhat do you feel?\n\n1058\n01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:08,190\nIf you have trouble doing that,\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n1059\n01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:14,150\nI would strongly recommend that you\ndo like a technical writing course.\n\n1060\n01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:19,560\nTechnical writing, that's what they teach\nyou is like get your opinion out of it and\n\n1061\n01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,000\njust the facts.\n\n1062\n01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,180\nSo, if that's what you're\nlacking which probably for\n\n1063\n01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:29,840\na good number of you, not to single\nanybody out or pick on anybody,\n\n1064\n01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,640\nfor a good number of people,\nthat is a problem.\n\n1065\n01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,330\n>> So, you will need to, if you're\ngonna do this, learn how to do that.\n\n1066\n01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:37,890\nEither, like I said,\n\n1067\n01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:41,630\nhave someone proofread it and you're\ngonna have to practice several times.\n\n1068\n01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:45,690\nOr just take a course on\ntechnical writing and\n\n1069\n01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:48,930\nyou will learn how to\nactually do something,\n\n1070\n01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:53,030\nwrite a report that actually gets to the\npoint and kind of dispenses with the BS.\n\n1071\n01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,560\n>> There you go.\n\n1072\n01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:56,960\nWell, Sean, that was a great episode.\n\n1073\n01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,510\nWe learned all about creating\nthese reports forward to support\n\n1074\n01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:01,548\nour investigation.\n\n1075\n01:01:01,548 --> 01:01:05,630\nHow we're gonna go about delivering that,\nwhat needs to be included in that report,\n\n1076\n01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:09,410\nand then, even some samples of what\na good report should look like.\n\n1077\n01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:12,120\nSo, anything else we wanna\nthrow in there for reports?\n\n1078\n01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:18,710\n>> Not as far as the actual form of\nreports, but all of you should remember\n\n1079\n01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:23,370\nthat there's software that will help you\ngenerate this, so you're not on your own.\n\n1080\n01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:27,380\nIt won't do all the work for you but\nit can help when you're going through\n\n1081\n01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:32,190\nthe process and time and date stamping\neverything and organizing it.\n\n1082\n01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:37,276\nSo, it's easier for\nyou to put into the proper format.\n\n1083\n01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:41,333\nSo, that's a great thing, and\nthe software that does some of it,\n\n1084\n01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:43,151\nyou actually have to pay for.\n\n1085\n01:01:43,151 --> 01:01:46,202\nBut heck, paying 500 bucks or\nsomething for\n\n1086\n01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:51,081\na piece of software that helps my\ndocumentation process go a little faster,\n\n1087\n01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:55,958\nyeah, I'm gonna pay for it because I do\nnot wanna have to go to word and type,\n\n1088\n01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:59,510\nwrite everything up from\nscratch every time.\n\n1089\n01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:00,500\n>> Absolutely not.\n\n1090\n01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,360\n>> Yeah.\nSo, there you go.\n\n1091\n01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,820\n>>

morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening,\n\n5\n00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,961\nwelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:40,910\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,950\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,060\n>> I am doing pretty good.\n\n9\n00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,740\nHow you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,980\n>> I am doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,300\nWe are doing our digital\nforensic investigator episodes.\n\n12\n00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,990\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ncovering becoming an expert witness.\n\n13\n00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,490\nBecause at some point during our career,\nas a forensic investigator,\n\n14\n00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,740\nwe might be called upon to be\na expert witness in a court of law.\n\n15\n00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,770\n>> Yes that's where this is\nactually heading is this.\n\n16\n00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,609\nYou may become that expert witness\nwith a little time, experience and\n\n17\n00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:17,461\nmaybe a small amount of luck,\nthat that will be where you're headed.\n\n18\n00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:22,581\nSo be prepared for that,\nyou may not just be doing the report,\n\n19\n00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:25,842\nyou may not be just doing the analysis.\n\n20\n00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:32,676\nYou may be going to that next level and\ngoing to court and presenting your facts,\n\n21\n00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:37,541\nyour findings, and\nbeing cross examined and all that.\n\n22\n00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,128\nIt can be a frustrating and\nstressful experience.\n\n23\n00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:43,441\n>> I got my suit and tie, I'm ready to go!\n\n24\n00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:45,101\nBut yeah, it really can be.\n\n25\n00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:49,861\nYou do have to be prepared for\nthis, because it's not just\n\n26\n00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:54,391\na matter of you getting up and presenting\ninformation or being asked questions.\n\n27\n00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:58,860\nOn one side of the case, they want\nto accept everything you presented.\n\n28\n00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,980\nIt proves their side of the case or\nwhatever.\n\n29\n00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,540\nThe other side, though, is going to\ntry to take everything you've done and\n\n30\n00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,260\ntear it apart, poke holes in it and\ndestroy, not destroy, but\n\n31\n00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,650\nto poke at your expertise, maybe, or\nyour reputation and things like that.\n\n32\n00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,380\nSo it can be a very, very stressful,\nI know people that don't wanna do it.\n\n33\n00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,420\nI mean they love being\na forensic investigator, or\n\n34\n00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,190\nthey love doing what they do, but\nthey don't want to be a witness in court.\n\n35\n00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,100\n>> Yeah, I wouldn't blame them, there's\n\n36\n00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,821\npeople that already get sweaty hands, and\ndry mouth just by going in the court,\n\n37\n00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:32,888\n[LAUGH] and that might just be for\na traffic ticket.\n\n38\n00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:34,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean can you imagine actually sitting\n\n39\n00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,760\non the stand and\nhave to be grilled by somebody.\n\n40\n00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,370\nFirst, there's somebody that's friendly to\nyou and then there's someone that's gonna\n\n41\n00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,442\nbe really hostile to you and try to rip\nyour throat out and make you look bad.\n\n42\n00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:51,835\nSo yeah, it could be very,\nvery, very stressful,\n\n43\n00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:54,135\nand to be honest not everyone's suited for\nit.\n\n44\n00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:55,425\n>> Not everybody is cut out for it.\n\n45\n00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,655\nSo the first thing we\nreally should do Shawn,\n\n46\n00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:01,525\nis define what we mean\nby an expert witness.\n\n47\n00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,770\nWe're all probably.\n\n48\n00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,510\nHave our own thoughts of what that means.\n\n49\n00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,660\nWe've seen enough crime shows and\nthings like that but\n\n50\n00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,160\nlet's really define you know\nwhat makes an expert witness.\n\n51\n00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,140\n>> An expert witness is\nsomeone that really just\n\n52\n00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,980\nis recognized as being someone that's\nvery knowledgeable about their field and\n\n53\n00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,260\nthat would be true with anybody\nthat you're going to consider and\n\n54\n00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,500\nexpert witness is somebody that's\nknowledgeable in their field.\n\n55\n00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,680\nSo if just for\nas an example those of you that\n\n56\n00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,420\nhave experience in IT,\nseveral years experience.\n\n57\n00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,060\nIf you were called in to testify about\nsomething or provide your opinion or\n\n58\n00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,870\ntestify something about networks.\n\n59\n00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,940\nYou might be considered with\nyour knowledge, certifications,\n\n60\n00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,753\nexperience to be an expert\nwitness in there.\n\n61\n00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:51,786\nYou know, so\nthat would be one way to approach it,\n\n62\n00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:54,966\nin the case of someone\nthat's a forensic examiner,\n\n63\n00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:59,590\nthey're gonna look at your experience,\nhow long you've been doing this,\n\n64\n00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:05,330\nyou know maybe what you've worked on, you\nknow things that you may have published.\n\n65\n00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,090\nAnd all those things will go towards,\nyes you've got verifiable experience.\n\n66\n00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,990\nYou've actually been paid to do this type\nof stuff before, so you're a professional.\n\n67\n00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,740\nAnd that is a detail, by the way,\nto be considered an expert in something,\n\n68\n00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,810\nthey're gonna say have you been paid for\nthis?\n\n69\n00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,520\nYou just can't say oh, I watch a lot\nof CSI and read a lot of books, so\n\n70\n00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,180\nI'm an expert.\n\n71\n00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,100\n>> I do this as a hobby on the weekend,\nor something like that.\n\n72\n00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,630\nThat's probably not gonna fly.\n\n73\n00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,380\n>> You could be real good at this stuff,\nbut, just self taught and\n\n74\n00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,160\ngotten certified and all that type of\nstuff, but if you haven't be paid for\n\n75\n00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,430\nit means that your skills aren't\nworth someone to pay for.\n\n76\n00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,560\nSo that would be a big bump in\n\n77\n00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,910\nthe road towards your getting\ncertified as an expert witness.\n\n78\n00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,000\nAnd then I even see this\none with Mikayla as,\n\n79\n00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,330\nyou need PhD level qualifications\nto be considered an expert witness.\n\n80\n00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,442\nNo.\nNo you don't.\n\n81\n00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:08,210\nThere's a select set of criteria\ngenerally accepted, if you meet those.\n\n82\n00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,020\nYou can be considered an expert witness,\nbut you don't have to be.\n\n83\n00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,590\nI mean an auto mechanic can be considered\nan expert witness if there was a case that\n\n84\n00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,330\nneeded that expertise.\n\n85\n00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,630\nYou can call someone in that's an auto\nmechanic and had been doing that for\n\n86\n00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,550\nthe last 20 years.\n\n87\n00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,620\nDown at some auto repair place.\n\n88\n00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,870\nThey've clearly been paid for\n\n89\n00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,240\nit, they clearly know their stuff,\nthey've got a long track record.\n\n90\n00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,400\nThey're an expert witness.\n\n91\n00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,490\n>> Absolutely.\n>> They will be recognized as that.\n\n92\n00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,110\nYou're not gonna get a PHD\nin auto maintenance.\n\n93\n00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,310\nIt just doesn't happen.\n\n94\n00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,350\n>> Yeah it really depends on what it\nis they're looking for an expert in.\n\n95\n00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,090\nIf it was a doctor\n>> Then we're gonna require that they've\n\n96\n00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,340\ngone to medical school.\n\n97\n00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,180\nBoth sides need to agree that this person\nis an expert in whatever field it is.\n\n98\n00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,160\nI mean my mother will tell you that\nI'm an expert as a procrastinator,\n\n99\n00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,020\nI've got 46 years of\nexperience procrastinating.\n\n100\n00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,930\nI've never been paid for it and\nI've never written any books on it so\n\n101\n00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,330\nit'd be difficult probably for\nme to become an expert witness in that.\n\n102\n00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,150\n>> But he is getting around to the books,\ntomorrow.\n\n103\n00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,568\n>> [LAUGH] I'm getting around to them,\nthat's right.\n\n104\n00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:12,795\n[LAUGH] Tomorrow.\n\n105\n00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:14,573\n>> Yeah.\n\n106\n00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:18,460\nAll right, so an expert witness is\njust somebody that everybody agrees,\n\n107\n00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:24,370\nhas certain qualifications or the ability\nto prove their knowledge in the field.\n\n108\n00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,960\nAnd we'll talk about\nsome of the specifics of\n\n109\n00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,490\nwhat qualifications are in just a minute.\n\n110\n00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,720\nAnd what is their role in a case.\n\n111\n00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,080\nWhat it was the expert\nwitness called upon to do?\n\n112\n00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,730\n>> The expert witness is gonna\nbe somebody that is going to\n\n113\n00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,160\nbe on the stand,\nis gonna be questioned about findings,\n\n114\n00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,930\nabout reports, about specifics of\nthe case, about their opinion.\n\n115\n00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,740\nThat type of stuff is where\nthey will come in, and\n\n116\n00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,590\ntheir role in the court room would be is\nthat they're expected to provide this\n\n117\n00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,820\nextra real time investigation,\nanalysis of this.\n\n118\n00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,842\nAnd yeah, they will be grilled,\nthey could be sitting on the stand for\n\n119\n00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:12,560\na while, and\nthey're there to be your expert.\n\n120\n00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,333\nIf questions are asked, if you need the\nextra help, if you feel that having that\n\n121\n00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:22,336\nanalysis is going to boost your position,\nthen, that's what their role is to do.\n\n122\n00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:23,890\n>> Okay.\nAnd then not everybody,\n\n123\n00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,740\nas we said at the beginning\nof this episode,\n\n124\n00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,190\nnot everybody makes a good expert witness.\n\n125\n00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,980\nThey might have the qualifications.\n\n126\n00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,360\nThey might have the knowledge, the\nexperience, publish books in the subject,\n\n127\n00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360\nand things like that.\n\n128\n00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,110\nAnd still not be chosen\nas an expert witness.\n\n129\n00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,970\nRight?\nCuz there are certain things that make\n\n130\n00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,520\nsome people better than others\nat being an expert witness.\n\n131\n00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,221\n>> Yeah an expert witness, you know you\ncan meet all the qualifications for\n\n132\n00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:50,007\nit, but it may not be good under pressure.\n\n133\n00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:55,108\nYou can make a lot of people crack\nunder the right pressure, and\n\n134\n00:07:55,108 --> 00:08:01,569\nlet's face it, you know I actually had\na friend of mine who is a lawyer himself.\n\n135\n00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:04,439\nSay that you know, we're talking\nabout trial orders, he goes, yeah,\n\n136\n00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,201\nit's theatrics.\n\n137\n00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:07,800\nWell, I go, a ton of that is theatrics.\n\n138\n00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,485\nAnd that's why he said,\nthey were a little bit of a joke [LAUGH].\n\n139\n00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:11,237\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Actually,\n\n140\n00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:12,540\nhe used a little stronger\nlanguage than that.\n\n141\n00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,750\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> But he was talking\nabout the fact he doesn't do trial orders,\n\n142\n00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,045\nhe doesn't work in trial or anything, but\nhe says, he goes [SOUND], trial lawyers,\n\n143\n00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:26,320\nbecause they're into theatrics,\nthey're into dramatic stuff.\n\n144\n00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,110\nThey do know the law, but\nthey're focused on that.\n\n145\n00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,283\nSo, they're also going to use\nthose type of theatrics and\n\n146\n00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:34,110\ndramatic things to pound on you.\n\n147\n00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,970\nAnd so, if you're not good under pressure,\n\n148\n00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,760\nif you can't hold your composure,\nif you get too emotional or anything,\n\n149\n00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,680\nor take stuff personally,\nnot the thing for you, it's just not.\n\n150\n00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,217\n>> And think about it, if I've got\na choice between two people and\n\n151\n00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:50,084\none of them is gonna get up\nthere on the stand and go,\n\n152\n00:08:50,084 --> 00:08:54,660\nwell, we found some evidence on this hard\ndrive using encase, and it turns out.\n\n153\n00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,873\nOr if you've got somebody\nthat's gonna get up there and,\n\n154\n00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:59,690\nwe've used encase to uncover some\ndigital evidence off this hard drive.\n\n155\n00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,831\nJust the difference in their presentation,\n\n156\n00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,084\nif you've got somebody\nthat can get up there and\n\n157\n00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:08,135\njust gonna fold under that pressure, or is\ngonna be kinda, come off as timid or meek,\n\n158\n00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:11,270\nthat might not be the person that\nyou want as your expert witness.\n\n159\n00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:15,061\nEven though they might be very qualified\nin the field, if they can't present to\n\n160\n00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:18,964\na jury or to wherever it is we're trying\nto present this case, it's not gonna help\n\n161\n00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:22,320\nour case, it might actually hinder\nour case, that's not who I want.\n\n162\n00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,310\n>> Yeah, you definitely do not want\nsomeone that cannot take the heat.\n\n163\n00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,860\nNow, they do coach or rehearse,\nI guess is a better way to put it.\n\n164\n00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,700\nDo rehearse and go through things\nwith expert witnesses ahead of time,\n\n165\n00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,050\nsaying this is the type of\nstuff we wanna talk about, and\n\n166\n00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,520\nthis is the way we want to describe this.\n\n167\n00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,880\nThey're not trying to manipulate\nevidence or anything.\n\n168\n00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,490\nThey're just trying to make sure\neveryone's got everything straight,\n\n169\n00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,700\nand what we've got.\n\n170\n00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,900\nEveryone's on the same page.\n\n171\n00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,790\nWe're not wording stuff in such a way that\nit sounds like we have a bad position.\n\n172\n00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,600\nAnd then, even rehearsing it makes you\n\n173\n00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,430\nfeel a lot more comfortable with it and\ngives you that confidence.\n\n174\n00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,610\nAnd that confidence goes a long way,\n\n175\n00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,450\nwe all know that from our\nown personal experiences.\n\n176\n00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,110\nLike you said,\nsomeone can be knowledgeable.\n\n177\n00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,741\nBut if they're really kind of\nnot presenting themselves well,\n\n178\n00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:23,720\nthey're just not gonna look great.\n\n179\n00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,610\n>> And a lot of it comes back to\nstereotypes, maybe shouldn't be right or\n\n180\n00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,050\nwhat have you, but if I've got\na choice between two expert witnesses.\n\n181\n00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,590\nAnd I've got one guy that, he's clean cut,\nand he wears nice clothes and blah,\n\n182\n00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,430\nblah, blah.\n\n183\n00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,660\nVersus another guy that maybe is not so\nclean cut.\n\n184\n00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,010\nLooks like he's kind of limp.\n\n185\n00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,810\nThat kind of thing.\n\n186\n00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,410\nThat could make a big difference too when\nyou're picking this expert witness cuz\n\n187\n00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,280\nyou need somebody that fits the part.\n\n188\n00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,090\nCuz you said, it is a lot of\ntheatrics to go on to the courtroom.\n\n189\n00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,160\nAnd it's convincing those 12\npeople to your side of the case.\n\n190\n00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,680\nEven appearances can come off,\nand then, as you say,\n\n191\n00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,450\ncoaching occurs because you\nmight not have a choice.\n\n192\n00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,690\nThe only expert witness you can\nfind in that particular area\n\n193\n00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,080\nis not really good at presenting\ninformation like that, and\n\n194\n00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,800\nso I've gotta coach him up,\nI've gotta build that confidence.\n\n195\n00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,530\nMy dad has been an expert witness\nin a few different cases and\n\n196\n00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,000\nthey always bring him in and\ngo over what he's gonna talk about and\n\n197\n00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,790\nhave him give his thing, and say,\nokay, let's change these terms.\n\n198\n00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,310\nLet's not talk about it in this way.\n\n199\n00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,255\nLet's use different terms if we can.\n\n200\n00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:26,670\nSomething's a little more understandable.\n\n201\n00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,950\nThey're not changing the information.\n\n202\n00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,037\nThey're changing the way he's\npresenting that information, so\n\n203\n00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:34,360\nit comes off the way they\nwant in that court of law.\n\n204\n00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,796\n>> Yeah, that's some of the important\nthings with it, is that you will be going\n\n205\n00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:42,344\nthrough that, if you ever\nare called in as an expert witness,\n\n206\n00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:46,400\nyou can expect these things to happen\nto make you more effective at it.\n\n207\n00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,310\nThey want someone that's confident,\nthey want someone who's knowledgeable,\n\n208\n00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,260\nthey want all those things.\n\n209\n00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,900\nYou do have to look a certain part.\n\n210\n00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,269\nWhen you become an expert witness,\nthere's even ways of just\n\n211\n00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:02,226\nvisually manipulating what\npeople think about you up and\n\n212\n00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:05,140\nbeyond, even the suit you wear.\n\n213\n00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,905\nBut you put your chest out and\nsit up straight and\n\n214\n00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:09,645\nall that, there's ways beyond that.\n\n215\n00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,735\nThey recommend for-\n>> Body language.\n\n216\n00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:11,235\n>> The what?\n\n217\n00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:11,905\n>> Body language.\n\n218\n00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:13,405\n>> Yeah, body language.\n\n219\n00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:17,757\nThey have things they talk about for\nexpert witnesses,\n\n220\n00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:22,860\ncome in and make sure you acknowledge\nthe jury if they're there.\n\n221\n00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,475\nThat's one way of\nbolstering your standing.\n\n222\n00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:31,820\nAnother way is as you go on through\ntestifying as it goes longer.\n\n223\n00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,020\nThey're saying during your longer answers,\nyou can just\n\n224\n00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,390\nalmost interceptably turn\na little bit towards the jury.\n\n225\n00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,930\nAnd that even kind of\nmanipulates the way they think,\n\n226\n00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,110\nbecause now you're talking to them,\nand they feel more connected, and\n\n227\n00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,498\nthey're more focused, and\nthat's what you want.\n\n228\n00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:54,610\nSo, yeah [LAUGH],\nthere's gonna be a lot to this,\n\n229\n00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,980\nit could be a game,\nalmost like a game of chess or something\n\n230\n00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,290\nthat you're playing in addition to the\nfacts and all that you've got to present.\n\n231\n00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,390\n>> Absolutely.\n\n232\n00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:09,250\nAnd then, we've got different types of\nexpert witnesses that might be called upon\n\n233\n00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,290\nin a case, not just a forensics expert.\n\n234\n00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,260\n>> Yeah,\nthere's not just forensics experts.\n\n235\n00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:22,300\nThere can be experts in really any, expert\nwitnesses rather, than any in any field.\n\n236\n00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,080\nSome of the ones I was noting,\nmedical forensics.\n\n237\n00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:33,700\nYou see those in a lot of your\nautopsy cases and murder cases.\n\n238\n00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,845\nPsychological, you've got a psychiatrist\nor psychologist up there.\n\n239\n00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:40,940\n[UNKOWN] has a track record,\nthey'll be doing that.\n\n240\n00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:46,280\nCriminal people that have studied\ncriminal law and aware of that.\n\n241\n00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,960\nConstruction or architecture,\nmaybe you got a case with that,\n\n242\n00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,640\nin other words, a building collapsed or\nsomething like that they needed it.\n\n243\n00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,090\nThat one, civil litigation experts.\n\n244\n00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,530\nYou can keep going on and on and on.\n\n245\n00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:05,850\nYou can have people that are experts\non aviation, pilots, mechanics.\n\n246\n00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,570\nReally anything.\n\n247\n00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,840\n>> Just whatever the field is.\n\n248\n00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,000\n>> Yeah, whatever it is,\n\n249\n00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,745\nwhen you can prove a track\nrecord of experience in there.\n\n250\n00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:18,220\nAnd you can approve some of these other\nthings and the court accepts that,\n\n251\n00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,290\nthe court can accept you\nas an expert witness.\n\n252\n00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,270\nThey also can accept just as a witness,\n\n253\n00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,426\nthey don't have to accept\nyou as expert witness.\n\n254\n00:14:25,426 --> 00:14:29,290\nIf they accept you just as a regular\nwitness, you carry less weight.\n\n255\n00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,220\nAnd with an expert witness,\nif they recognize you're credentials.\n\n256\n00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,560\nThe court will say okay,\nwe recognize your credentials.\n\n257\n00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,960\nBoom, you're an expert witness.\n\n258\n00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,820\n>> And then, you go down here.\n\n259\n00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,570\nYou have technical versus expert,\nwhat do we mean by that?\n\n260\n00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,909\n>> Yeah, there's a level where\nyou're a technical person,\n\n261\n00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:50,380\nyou're in the weeds doing\nthat type of stuff.\n\n262\n00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,590\nAnd you're knowledgable about that.\n\n263\n00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,710\nThose are probably the ones\nthat really aren't so\n\n264\n00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,830\ngood at being the best choices\nto be up on the stand.\n\n265\n00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,790\nBecause they're good at talking bits and\nbytes and all that type of stuff,\n\n266\n00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,650\nbut they're not good at,\nthe other side is actually presenting it.\n\n267\n00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,730\nAnd that's where the expert part will come\nin, an expert one is a lot more confident\n\n268\n00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,640\ndoing that, can also break it down to\nsomething that the masses can understand.\n\n269\n00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,555\nThat is a very, very important talent to\nbe able to break things down into stuff\n\n270\n00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,990\nthat other people can\nunderstand outside your field.\n\n271\n00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,570\nThey will look for that.\n\n272\n00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,060\nAnd if you talk too technical, one of\nthe downsides would be in a courtroom.\n\n273\n00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,790\nIf you talk too technical,\nyou can easily alienate the jury and\n\n274\n00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,660\nother individuals in there because it\nseems like, oh, I'm better than them and\n\n275\n00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,280\nI'm talking over their heads and\nthey should know this.\n\n276\n00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,490\nYou don't want that.\n\n277\n00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,460\nOr if they don't even think that, if they\ndon't understand the techno jargon and\n\n278\n00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,750\nbabble, you don't want them saying,\ncan we have a dictionary or\n\n279\n00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,282\nsomething, when they're doing\ndeliberations or something or\n\n280\n00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:57,260\njust going, I'm not even considering it,\ncuz I don't know what he said.\n\n281\n00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,812\n>> Yeah.\n>> That would be a big problem.\n\n282\n00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:04,387\nSo, you wanna make sure which\ntype of person you need.\n\n283\n00:16:04,387 --> 00:16:09,910\nA technical person is not someone that's\nnecessarily the best suited to this.\n\n284\n00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,920\nIt's someone that is an expert.\n\n285\n00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,390\nAn expert can be someone that has, or\n\n286\n00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,610\nwill be someone that has a lot\nof experience in the field.\n\n287\n00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,770\nAnd may even be in a management position,\nand what they do,\n\n288\n00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,130\nthey have that veteran level experiences.\n\n289\n00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,600\nSo not only do they have\nthe technical from way back, but\n\n290\n00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,690\nthey've been seasoned and been through\nthe meat grinder a few times and\n\n291\n00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:35,130\nnow they've reached that status where\nthey not only many manage a lab,\n\n292\n00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:40,490\nand do the examinations, but\nthey also know how to speak to people.\n\n293\n00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,550\nSo that's kind of what you really,\nreally, really want to have.\n\n294\n00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,370\nIf you have access to them.\n\n295\n00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,070\n>> And then as an expert witness\nthe other thing I've got to do, or\n\n296\n00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,170\nwe want our expert witness to do\nis to make sure we keep them in.\n\n297\n00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,410\nI mean, they're an expert in\na particular field, right?\n\n298\n00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,050\nAnd we want him to stay there.\n\n299\n00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,690\n>> Yeah,\nthat's something that is very important.\n\n300\n00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,620\nWe've mentioned this\nduring the course already,\n\n301\n00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,920\nis that stay within your scope,\nstay within your experiences.\n\n302\n00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,000\nDon't exceed your experience.\n\n303\n00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,210\nThat's only gonna come to a bad end.\n\n304\n00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:23,110\nSo, if you aren't an expert in a certain\narea, you should make the people\n\n305\n00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,470\nthat bring you in, or trying to bring\nyou in, make them aware of that.\n\n306\n00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:33,020\nAnd then if they're aware of that,\nstill wanna bring you on the stand, and\n\n307\n00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,470\nthey're okay with all that, then when you\ndo get on the stand and you're questioned,\n\n308\n00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,670\nif you aren't knowledgeable in an area, if\nthey try to pull you outside of your area,\n\n309\n00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,730\nand they will try to do that, if they try\nto pull you out of your area, say, well,\n\n310\n00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,870\nthat's not my area of expertise.\n\n311\n00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,480\n>> Yeah, there's nothing wrong with\nadmitting that, and say, I'm a doctor,\n\n312\n00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,090\nJim, not a bricklayer.\n\n313\n00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,254\nAnd everybody understands that.\n\n314\n00:17:57,254 --> 00:18:00,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's the way to do it.\n\n315\n00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,944\nIs that, yeah,\nyou pull me out of my area of expertise,\n\n316\n00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:07,369\nI'm there as an expert on\ncomputer forensics and\n\n317\n00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:11,797\nyou're trying to ask me something\nabout medical technology,\n\n318\n00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:15,410\nI don't know anything\nabout medical technology.\n\n319\n00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,810\nI'm gonna tell you that,\n\n320\n00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,690\nthat that's out of my area of expertise,\nI honestly don't know that.\n\n321\n00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,310\n>> All right, and then for\nevidence processing,\n\n322\n00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:31,410\nwe talk about documenting, or\nmaking sure we have the proper documents.\n\n323\n00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,600\n>> Yeah.\nWe talked about in the previous section\n\n324\n00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,590\nabout that, about, in the previous\nsections about processing evidence and\n\n325\n00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,250\nmaking sure things\nare handled a certain way.\n\n326\n00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,850\nWe talked about reporting in\nthe episode just prior to this one.\n\n327\n00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,670\nBut documenting, period,\n\n328\n00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:55,260\nis gonna be a huge part of when you bring\nthe evidence in, is make sure all those\n\n329\n00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,730\ndocuments are there that show how each\none of these things were processed.\n\n330\n00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,340\nMake sure the evidence bag, show are\ntagged correctly when they bring them in,\n\n331\n00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,530\nand the original paperwork is in there.\n\n332\n00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,980\nMake sure all those things\nare done by the numbers,\n\n333\n00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,570\neverything is organized and\nas presentable.\n\n334\n00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,130\nAnything less than that could impact you,\nand\n\n335\n00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,450\nyou definitely do not\nwant that sort of thing.\n\n336\n00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,160\nYou want everything to be nice and\nclear, be presentable,\n\n337\n00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,510\nbe documented, there's no holes.\n\n338\n00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,905\nAnd they will try to find those.\n\n339\n00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:30,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Have those all set up.\n\n340\n00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,860\n>> Yes, they will.\n\n341\n00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,080\nAnd that evidence has to be able\nto hold up under the scrutiny in\n\n342\n00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,440\neither the court system or\na company investigation as well, right?\n\n343\n00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,385\nAnd there is ways we can prove\nthat we have talked about.\n\n344\n00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:46,729\n>> Yeah, we have talked about that\nas a way you verify your evidence,\n\n345\n00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:51,694\nbecause you can count on the fact that\ndigital evidence is gonna be foreign to\n\n346\n00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:56,880\na lot of people when you go into\na court room, or really any situation.\n\n347\n00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,606\nYou ask anybody,\nespecially after what you know now,\n\n348\n00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:05,628\nyou ask just about anybody out there\nhow you would find evidence on a system\n\n349\n00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:10,084\nof someone doing something or\ntaking them to court on something.\n\n350\n00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,332\nThey might tell you, hey,\nwell I've got log files that say that,\n\n351\n00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:17,218\nI'm just gonna grab those log files and\ntake them to court and go, hey your honor\n\n352\n00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:21,200\nI've got this and we'll take it and blah,\nblah, blah, the list that shows it.\n\n353\n00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,405\nUnder what we know now,\nthat's really not good enough.\n\n354\n00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:27,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That doesn't meet the standard in just\n\n355\n00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,480\npresenting it.\n\n356\n00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,970\nYou have to do more than that.\n\n357\n00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,810\nThey could easily say well,\nyou tampered with this.\n\n358\n00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,760\nThere's a question, so\n\n359\n00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,860\nyou'd have to bring in other stuff or\ndo certain things to do that.\n\n360\n00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,570\nIt's of the utmost importance\nthat you remember that.\n\n361\n00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,195\nDon't get kinda caught in that trap.\n\n362\n00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:49,265\nAnd people do get caught\nin that trap quite often.\n\n363\n00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:53,565\nThere's a lot of amateur forensics\npeople out there especially,\n\n364\n00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:55,995\nin some of these civil cases and\nstuff like that.\n\n365\n00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,060\nThey'll go to small claims,\nor something like that,\n\n366\n00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,170\nall the sudden they think they're on CSI.\n\n367\n00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,032\nAnd they've got this big dramatic\nreveal and all that planned.\n\n368\n00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:05,700\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n369\n00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,820\n>> You kinda just wanna get\n\n370\n00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,910\npopcorn during it.\n\n371\n00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,320\n>> This is gonna be awesome.\n\n372\n00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,390\n>> Cuz at some point, you don't know when\nit's gonna happen, but at some point,\n\n373\n00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,550\nyou know, the judge is just gonna\ncome out and like smack him down.\n\n374\n00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,150\nAnd they're like,\nyou know what's gonna happen.\n\n375\n00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,370\n>> So a good slap on the back of the head?\n\n376\n00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:19,950\n>> Yeah.\nYou know,\n\n377\n00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,430\nyou know they're gonna\nget put in their place.\n\n378\n00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,570\nThey think it's like, I'm a detective.\n\n379\n00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,800\nNo, no, no you're not.\n\n380\n00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,290\nYou're just really not.\n\n381\n00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,390\n>> And then he mentioned catalog and\nthen indexing.\n\n382\n00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,800\n>> Yeah, make sure you have an accurate\ncatalog of what's supposed to be present,\n\n383\n00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:41,658\nwhat evidence was there and\nit's very, very well laid out and\n\n384\n00:21:41,658 --> 00:21:44,420\nthought out.\n\n385\n00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,680\nIt's indexed so it shows what should be\nthere, everything's numbered correctly.\n\n386\n00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,480\nAnd you know we talked about that a little\nbit, not as much as we could have.\n\n387\n00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,960\nJust because there's different\nways you can approach it.\n\n388\n00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,600\nThat's one of the, if you recall,\n\n389\n00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,120\nwe talked about when we were doing our\nlittle crime scene reenactment here.\n\n390\n00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,420\nWe were pulling stuff out.\n\n391\n00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:10,760\nYou Mike, were writing the stuff on A,\nB, C, and D.\n\n392\n00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,740\nThat was totally fine for\nwhat we're doing here.\n\n393\n00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,040\nWe didn't want to make it\nanymore complex than that.\n\n394\n00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,050\nAnd you even wrote on the evidence bad,\nyou've signed it and all that.\n\n395\n00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,090\nThat is pretty much what would\nhappen on a crime scene.\n\n396\n00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:26,120\nThe difference is that there would\nbe a certain format for that.\n\n397\n00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,900\nThere would be something with your\ninitials, maybe your examiner number.\n\n398\n00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,370\nAnd then you know,\ninstead of you just signing your name,\n\n399\n00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,090\nyou would've put your initials, examiner\nnumber, a case number, a date, and\n\n400\n00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,380\nthen you would have exhibit A.\n\n401\n00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:46,430\nIf this computer we had up here was\nexhibit A, those different cords\n\n402\n00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:52,170\nwould be A1 and A2 and A3, cuz they show\nthat they are associated with exhibit A.\n\n403\n00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,680\nThis is just another piece of exhibit A.\n\n404\n00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,930\nSo, you wanna have those\nthings all catalogued and\n\n405\n00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,550\nindexed accordingly so\nyou know where things belong.\n\n406\n00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:06,740\nAnd it will take some practice, that's\nwhy if you're gonna do this, you should\n\n407\n00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,380\nreally practice documentation skills, and\npulling apart something, and making sure\n\n408\n00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,700\nthat you're doing it the right way so that\nyou don't make that mistake, on scene.\n\n409\n00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:22,050\nBut what we did up here,\nthat is the overall process.\n\n410\n00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,440\nBut in the field and when you go to court,\nthey're gonna wanna see, okay,\n\n411\n00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,140\nyour catalog.\n\n412\n00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,710\nI see computer A, and\nthen I see the 1 through 20,\n\n413\n00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,355\nall those components are things\nthat go into exhibit A,\n\n414\n00:23:33,355 --> 00:23:37,605\nthis is one complete exhibit,\nso I'm aware of that.\n\n415\n00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:42,215\nBut here's B, there's no B1, B2, there's\njust a B, that's the whole exhibit,\n\n416\n00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:45,135\nthere's no other pieces or\nanything else with that.\n\n417\n00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:49,045\nSo that would be very,\nvery important to have a catalogue and\n\n418\n00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:51,820\nindex accordingly, and\ntake your time and do that.\n\n419\n00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,680\nThat should actually already be done.\n\n420\n00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,000\nYou should just have to\ngrab it from wherever and\n\n421\n00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,110\nshove it on a page and you've got it.\n\n422\n00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,350\nIf you don't have it at that point,\nyou shouldn't be in court.\n\n423\n00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,533\n>> It's a little too late.\n\n424\n00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:07,817\n>> There's a shark in the water just\nswimming to get you at that point.\n\n425\n00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:09,208\n>> And hopefully we have.\n\n426\n00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:09,961\nWe've used the goods.\n\n427\n00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:14,396\nSoftware that we've purchased, or we've\nbeen very thorough in our investigation,\n\n428\n00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:16,590\nwe've documented the entire way.\n\n429\n00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,656\nSo yes, at the end, at the court case, or\nwhen you're presenting this information to\n\n430\n00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:23,795\nwhomever, you shouldn't have to go and\nmake all this stuff then.\n\n431\n00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,273\nI should just be able to get\nwhat I've already done, and\n\n432\n00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:27,819\nbring it with me hopefully.\n\n433\n00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:29,495\n>> Yeah.\nThat's there,\n\n434\n00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:35,415\nthe good forensic examiner does\nall the stuff along the way so\n\n435\n00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:39,610\nthere's no scrambling around at the end.\n\n436\n00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,730\nIt should be after you've\ndone your investigation and\n\n437\n00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,150\ngone through all the evidence.\n\n438\n00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,070\nAnd you've collected, preserved it,\nand all those things.\n\n439\n00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,410\nYou should be able to, at the end,\njust tie up the report.\n\n440\n00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,990\nAnd when they need this\ncatalog you've got it.\n\n441\n00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,420\nYou've essentially got the thing.\n\n442\n00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,410\nYou just have to just extract\nthe information and pop it in there.\n\n443\n00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:02,320\nSome things, there's actually\nsoftware that you log everything in.\n\n444\n00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,270\nYou should be logging everything\nin the lab, electronic logs.\n\n445\n00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,970\nYou log everything in for the case.\n\n446\n00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,240\nIf they need this catalog and\nindex, guess what, print.\n\n447\n00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,800\nWhat else do you need?\n\n448\n00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,480\nThat's really it.\n\n449\n00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,670\n>> And all the different pieces that go\nwith it, like that A1 and A2 and A3 and\n\n450\n00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,070\nmake sure those are\n>> Any notes that you've made\n\n451\n00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,880\nreferencing that particular\nitem can get spit out.\n\n452\n00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,610\nSo this software is really impressive.\n\n453\n00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,260\n>> Yeah, the stuff that we did here,\nthat if we\n\n454\n00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,709\nwere gonna take that computer back to\nthe lab to do the full investigation.\n\n455\n00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,660\nWhen we got back to the lab,\n\n456\n00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,310\nwe have a chain of custody that we started\nhere, as this being the crime scene.\n\n457\n00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,460\nOnce we started that chain\nof custody here, and\n\n458\n00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,700\nMike and I took it back to the lab,\nwhen we check it in we're showing\n\n459\n00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,750\nthat it's transferring from us to\nsomebody that's receiving it at the lab.\n\n460\n00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,850\nAnd as it's checked in, they're gonna say,\nokay there's computer A, and\n\n461\n00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,400\ntap, tap, tap, it came in,\nit got transferred from so and\n\n462\n00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,290\nso to so and so, there's A1 to so\nand so to so and so.\n\n463\n00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:12,840\nThat's all gonna be entered in,\nand then be put into lockers and\n\n464\n00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,690\nlocked down, or we're gonna be assigned a\nlocker as the people working on that case,\n\n465\n00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,900\nand it's gonna be, you know locked down.\n\n466\n00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,970\nBut you're starting that.\n\n467\n00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,880\nYou already have that catalog\nin most cases sitting out there.\n\n468\n00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,640\nIt's just a case of, well, where is it?\n\n469\n00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,150\nPrint.\n\n470\n00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,200\nWell, there you go.\n\n471\n00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,420\nIt's all formatted and boom.\n\n472\n00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,550\nYou can just take that to court.\n\n473\n00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,450\nGive it to your attorney, or\nwhoever's managing the case, and\n\n474\n00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,410\nsay, tell me what else you need,\nI've got it.\n\n475\n00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:43,900\n>> And then if I'm acting as an expert\nwitness in a case, then I need to be able\n\n476\n00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,200\nto bring in, what they're paying me for\nis my expertise as well as my experience.\n\n477\n00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,450\nBut we're referring to our\nprofessional experience,\n\n478\n00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,450\nnot anything we've done as a hobby or\non the weekend or anything like that.\n\n479\n00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,450\n>> Yeah, that's the part really.\n\n480\n00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,990\nAnd it can catch a lot of people.\n\n481\n00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,520\nI could sit here and say, for example,\nI've been doing computers for, like,\n\n482\n00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,350\n30 years, like, 35 years or\nsomething, at this point.\n\n483\n00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,210\nI, literally, like I said,\nhave been working with them for that long.\n\n484\n00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,420\nOkay, and you guys all know how old I am,\nI'm 32, apparently from what so and so.\n\n485\n00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,820\nAnd working on a size minus three.\n\n486\n00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:25,252\nBut I started on computers very,\nvery young.\n\n487\n00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:28,370\nThat was just the way it was in my house.\n\n488\n00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,009\nI work on really early ones.\n\n489\n00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:32,235\nIn fact, I think one of the early\nones I worked on, I remember,\n\n490\n00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:33,377\nthe Timex Sinclair computers.\n\n491\n00:27:33,377 --> 00:27:34,397\nRemember those ones?\n\n492\n00:27:34,397 --> 00:27:37,720\nIf you don't remember the Timex Sinclair\ncomputer, you gotta look it up.\n\n493\n00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,180\nIt's one of the first ones I worked on.\n\n494\n00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,120\nIt was very old at the time too, but\n\n495\n00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,690\nit's a little footnote to\nthe history of computing.\n\n496\n00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,830\nAnyway, I can't count all that experience.\n\n497\n00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,324\nYou can't count experience from\nthe time you were eight years old and\n\n498\n00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:54,607\nsay I've been working professionally\nsince eight years old.\n\n499\n00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,232\nDid you get paid since\nyou were eight years old?\n\n500\n00:27:56,232 --> 00:27:58,670\nNo, then shut up, it doesn't count.\n\n501\n00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,108\n[LAUGH] We're gonna have to readjust that.\n\n502\n00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:06,600\nIt's like, have you been getting paid for\nthis since when?\n\n503\n00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,320\nWell, since I turned 18.\n\n504\n00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,170\nOkay, you've got 25 years experience\nwith this paid professional experience,\n\n505\n00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,170\nthat's what we're gonna count.\n\n506\n00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,495\n>> Right.\n\n507\n00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,578\n>> It can be really tricky for\nsome people,\n\n508\n00:28:18,578 --> 00:28:20,611\ncuz you want to count all those things.\n\n509\n00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:22,144\n>> Yeah.\n>> It doesn't count.\n\n510\n00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,346\nSorry, it just doesn't count.\n\n511\n00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:27,755\n>> [LAUGH] And then, Ben has a good\nquestion in the chatroom there,\n\n512\n00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:31,255\ndo forensic teams usually have\nan expert person for trials?\n\n513\n00:28:31,255 --> 00:28:34,125\nWe might have a team of six people,\n\n514\n00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:38,659\nis there one other person on that team\nthe go to person for expert witness?\n\n515\n00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,510\n>> It's not unheard of.\n\n516\n00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,510\nI can tell you that.\n\n517\n00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,200\nIt's not unheard of.\n\n518\n00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,110\nBut it has to be ideally someone\nthat you guess is experienced and\n\n519\n00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,770\nknows all this stuff.\n\n520\n00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:55,510\nAnd is familiar with the case and\nhas some contact with it.\n\n521\n00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,736\nI can have someone that's just in the lab,\nand\n\n522\n00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:04,051\nthere's multiple teams in the lab, and\nthis person's the go to guy for it.\n\n523\n00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:06,300\nThey are the expert witness.\n\n524\n00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,920\n>> They're our rock star for\nour team or something.\n\n525\n00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,945\n>> Yeah, you can't call me in\nto be an expert witness for\n\n526\n00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:12,981\nyou if I've never had any\nexperience with that case.\n\n527\n00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:17,276\nThey go well there's this,\nI can analyze your findings and say and\n\n528\n00:29:17,276 --> 00:29:19,890\ngo to court on that and what you provide.\n\n529\n00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,830\nBut at some point they're gonna ask me,\nwell, have you worked with this case, and\n\n530\n00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,610\nwhat do you know about it?\n\n531\n00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,200\nAnd I'm like, just what I was provided,\nI was briefed.\n\n532\n00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,300\nThat changes things a bit, but it is done.\n\n533\n00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,610\nIt is done, but it's not unheard of\nto have someone that's an expert.\n\n534\n00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,840\nOr someone that's just a little bit\nbetter that you'd like to say, okay,\n\n535\n00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,060\nthis guy is really nice and slick under\npressure, and has no problem with it.\n\n536\n00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,060\nSo if he's available to do it,\nlet him do it.\n\n537\n00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,426\nJust make sure he's been briefed and\nknows what the specifics are and\n\n538\n00:29:50,426 --> 00:29:51,712\nhas some contact with it.\n\n539\n00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:58,282\nSo they've seen what's going on with\nit and then, yeah, go ahead and do it.\n\n540\n00:29:58,282 --> 00:29:59,245\n>> There you go.\n\n541\n00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:02,068\nAll right, well looking at the clock,\nladies and gentlemen, it's about time for\n\n542\n00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:03,860\nus to take a quick break,\nso we're gonna step away.\n\n543\n00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,990\nWe'll come back more about\nbeing an expert witness.\n\n544\n00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,621\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n545\n00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:15,588\n[MUSIC]\n\n546\n00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:17,224\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n547\n00:30:17,224 --> 00:30:20,660\nSo continuing on with our expert witness.\n\n548\n00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,401\nNext thing we want to talk about is some\nof the rules involved in being an expert.\n\n549\n00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:28,197\nI don't know if I want to say rules,\nis rules the right term or requirements?\n\n550\n00:30:28,197 --> 00:30:32,282\n>> I would say rules would be\nthe right term to call it,\n\n551\n00:30:32,282 --> 00:30:37,450\nthat is the best way,\nI think to put it to tell you the truth.\n\n552\n00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,738\n>> So those are the rules, and\n\n553\n00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:42,273\nagain this is something that would\nvery between different regions right?\n\n554\n00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:46,312\nU.S. has their set of rules that\nare acceptable by their courts of law, but\n\n555\n00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:51,370\nother countries, different court systems,\nthings like that, this could vary, right?\n\n556\n00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,481\nSo something you're\ngonna have to look into.\n\n557\n00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:56,543\n>> Yeah, it definitely could\nvary depending on where you go.\n\n558\n00:30:56,543 --> 00:31:02,940\nThis is kinda like a rule of thumb\nif you will, for here in the U.S..\n\n559\n00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,150\nAnd it's typically adhered to more or\nless.\n\n560\n00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:13,940\nThis is something that's actually spelled\nout in some of the federal guidelines.\n\n561\n00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,970\nSo you can kinda say it is a rule,\n\n562\n00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:21,670\nbut it is a guideline so\ntake from that what you will.\n\n563\n00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,010\nThe court can still say\nsomeones an expert witness.\n\n564\n00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:29,680\nIf they choose to they can say\nsomeone's an expert witness.\n\n565\n00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,630\nSo just keep that in mind\nwhen you're looking at these,\n\n566\n00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,830\nor we're talking about these things and\nyou're looking it up.\n\n567\n00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:40,349\n>> All right so what are some of\nthe requirements and or rules.\n\n568\n00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,500\n>> The requirements and\nrules come down to, first of all,\n\n569\n00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,790\nthey wanna see a minimum of four\nyears experience in the field and\n\n570\n00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:54,290\ngiving testimony in front of a court room,\nin front of a jury.\n\n571\n00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,200\nThey wanna see that.\n\n572\n00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,727\nThat's just to establish that yes,\n\n573\n00:31:58,727 --> 00:32:03,385\nyou have done this sorta thing before,\nyou're not brand new to it.\n\n574\n00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:06,027\nThey expect you to be brand\nnew at some point, but\n\n575\n00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:07,970\nnot brand new as an expert witness.\n\n576\n00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,520\nSo you could of testified as a witness\nin things before But not an expert\n\n577\n00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,320\nwitness under these guidelines, so\nthat's what that actually means.\n\n578\n00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,930\n>> Okay, so\nwe've talked about four years experience,\n\n579\n00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,480\nten years published literature, and\nit's not all of the below, right.\n\n580\n00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,280\nIt's just that some of these, or\nothers, or some combination of?\n\n581\n00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,470\n>> They like to see all of these actually,\nthey definitely like to see these things.\n\n582\n00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,179\nAs you were saying,\nthe ten years of published literature,\n\n583\n00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:37,608\nthey want to see white papers,\nor books, or whatever.\n\n584\n00:32:37,608 --> 00:32:42,200\nThey want to see, that stuff done,\nstudies, case studies, whatever,\n\n585\n00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,140\nthey want to see those things.\n\n586\n00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:49,240\nAnd they want to see it to be really\nbe honest and upfront about it.\n\n587\n00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,127\nIt needs to something\nthat is peer reviewed.\n\n588\n00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,700\nSo if you're publishing something,\n\n589\n00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,819\nthey want to see peer\nreviewed in there someplace.\n\n590\n00:32:56,819 --> 00:33:00,467\nSo if it's something that you just\npublished, you know nowadays,\n\n591\n00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,260\nanybody can publish something.\n\n592\n00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,738\nI hear that one all the time.\n\n593\n00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:05,135\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was gonna say, John,\n\n594\n00:33:05,135 --> 00:33:05,919\nyou're published?\n\n595\n00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,758\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well yeah, but\n\n596\n00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:09,645\nthere's a difference here.\n\n597\n00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:13,021\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've had someone tell me, and\n\n598\n00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:16,470\nI hope I seem far from being arrogant.\n\n599\n00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,340\nI joke around and everything about it.\n\n600\n00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,300\nBut I hope I don't come off that way.\n\n601\n00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,328\nBut I've had people tell me,\nI'm an author and I've been published.\n\n602\n00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:27,800\nI'm like, well, that's cool.\n\n603\n00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,599\nI'm happy for them.\n\n604\n00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:30,335\nAnd then you figure out that,\n\n605\n00:33:30,335 --> 00:33:34,140\nwhat they've done is they've\npublished through the Kindle.\n\n606\n00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,240\nWhich is totally free,\nyou don't have to review it, nothing.\n\n607\n00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,320\nYou just put it up there.\n\n608\n00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,115\nSo, anybody can put it up there and\nsay, oh, I'm an author.\n\n609\n00:33:42,115 --> 00:33:44,990\nIt's like,\nthat's a different kind of author.\n\n610\n00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,780\n>> I have a blog.\n\n611\n00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,580\nDoes that count?\n\n612\n00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,110\n>> Yeah.\n\n613\n00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,695\n>> I'm published!\n\n614\n00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:49,450\n[LAUGH]\n>> Believe it or now people claim that,\n\n615\n00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,720\nI have a blog, I'm published.\n\n616\n00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,240\nI had somebody that was a CEO of\na company and should know better.\n\n617\n00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,710\nThe guy is a CEO of a company he\nfounded that makes millions of dollars.\n\n618\n00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,470\nDoesn't need to impress anybody.\n\n619\n00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,060\nHe tells everybody, I'm an author,\nand you look at his books.\n\n620\n00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,251\nBehind the counter, he's got tons of\nhis books because no one wants them.\n\n621\n00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:12,231\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He does, I'm not kidding.\n\n622\n00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:13,355\nI found that out.\n\n623\n00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:14,493\nI was just looking.\n\n624\n00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:15,537\nWhat the hell?\n\n625\n00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:16,952\nThere's like a whole line of his books.\n\n626\n00:34:16,952 --> 00:34:18,380\nAnd it's like the place was telling me,\n\n627\n00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,190\nevery time you give them to somebody,\nthey'd leave them there and they'd leave.\n\n628\n00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,930\nSo he stopped giving them out.\n\n629\n00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,700\nAnd you look at it, it's like why is that?\n\n630\n00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,700\nThe guy published it himself, that was it.\n\n631\n00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,451\nYou look at it, he created it his own,\nhe had millions of dollars.\n\n632\n00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:33,440\nSo he created his own little incorporation\nfor publishing and just self published.\n\n633\n00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,280\nAnybody can self publish.\n\n634\n00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,200\nSo, peer review's a different thing.\n\n635\n00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,595\nThe stuff that I've done\nhas been peer reviewed.\n\n636\n00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:41,100\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n637\n00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,890\n>> So it puts it in a different standing.\n\n638\n00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,790\n>> It adds a different level of\nweight to that when you're saying\n\n639\n00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,920\nI'm a published author.\n\n640\n00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,440\n>> Yeah.\n\n641\n00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,260\n>> You're a verified published author.\n\n642\n00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,920\nAnd then, there's different standards too.\n\n643\n00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,615\nThat can be applied to what is\nan expert witness as well, right?\n\n644\n00:34:56,615 --> 00:34:59,680\n>> Yeah,\nthere can be many different standards.\n\n645\n00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,610\nIt all depends.\n\n646\n00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:06,562\nThe two standards that\nare important to know is, there's\n\n647\n00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,293\nthe I wanna say, I always want to say it\n>> Daubert, I think?\n\n648\n00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:10,871\n>> Yes, I always wanna say it French,\nDaubert.\n\n649\n00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:14,702\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then there is the Frye standard.\n\n650\n00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:19,684\nThe first one essentially, and\nMike's posted all the laws for\n\n651\n00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:23,680\nyou, so you can read the details on it.\n\n652\n00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,302\nThe first one, the Daubert one.\n\n653\n00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:29,129\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Pertains to,\n\n654\n00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:33,890\nit's something that they can do\nbefore anybody enters the courtroom.\n\n655\n00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:39,913\nThey can determine if that witness is\nconsidered to be an expert witness.\n\n656\n00:35:39,913 --> 00:35:42,276\nThey can accept them or\nreject them at that point,\n\n657\n00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:46,640\nbefore they ever set foot in a courtroom,\nthat's what that one applies to.\n\n658\n00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,480\nThe second one refers to evidence and\nits admissibility.\n\n659\n00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,270\nSo you've got two things\nthat come into play there,\n\n660\n00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,760\nthat can weigh on you as far\nas being an expert witness.\n\n661\n00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,500\nThe first one carrying a lot of weight.\n\n662\n00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,150\n>> Yep.\n\n663\n00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,420\nAll right, and\nthen we should have a resume.\n\n664\n00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,790\nWe should have some way to\nprove our experience, right?\n\n665\n00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,890\nWhether that's publishing or\nin the field or both or what have you.\n\n666\n00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,619\n>> Yeah you need to have that.\n\n667\n00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:17,660\nYou need to have a resume of some sorts.\n\n668\n00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,100\nAnd they're not saying,\ntake your resume off your home computer,\n\n669\n00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,090\nprint it and bring it in.\n\n670\n00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,720\nHand it to him going,\nhey I think it speaks for itself.\n\n671\n00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,840\nNo, not that.\n\n672\n00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,894\nIt's not an interview.\n\n673\n00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:32,305\nThey want to see something that\nshows you've got a documented\n\n674\n00:36:32,305 --> 00:36:38,666\nbackground of case work and\nexperience, awards, papers, whatever.\n\n675\n00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:41,244\nThey want to see all those things there.\n\n676\n00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:43,800\nThey want to see that\nyou've worked in this.\n\n677\n00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,580\nWhen I think standards for\nan expert witness,\n\n678\n00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,065\nyou have paid professional experience.\n\n679\n00:36:49,065 --> 00:36:54,087\nWell, your resume's gonna go\na long way towards showing that,\n\n680\n00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:58,395\nthat you have paid\nprofessional experience.\n\n681\n00:36:58,395 --> 00:37:03,565\nSo you have that document, your resume,\nyou've got references, if they need them.\n\n682\n00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:06,802\nAnd they can prove all that, so\nthat just adds weight to you.\n\n683\n00:37:06,802 --> 00:37:09,298\nSo you really want that really nice and\n\n684\n00:37:09,298 --> 00:37:12,890\nshiny polished resume\nthat's kept up to date.\n\n685\n00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,830\n>> This is weight in a good way,\nnot weight in a bad way, right?\n\n686\n00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,815\n>> Yeah, definitely not.\n\n687\n00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:20,220\n>> [LAUGH] Oh good,\ncuz I don't need any extra weight.\n\n688\n00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,590\nI got enough.\nAll right, and\n\n689\n00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,480\nthen there are some things\nthat when we're testifying,\n\n690\n00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,600\nthere's a set of guidelines\nthat we really need to follow.\n\n691\n00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,800\nAnd that we should, being an expert\nwitness, we should be familiar with these.\n\n692\n00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,504\nAnd we should do these\nwhen we're testifying.\n\n693\n00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:38,045\n>> Yes, there's rules of\nbehavior that you would expect,\n\n694\n00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:41,830\nthat you should adhere\nto as an expert witness,\n\n695\n00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:46,320\nreally as anybody,\nI can put it going into a courtroom.\n\n696\n00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,208\nI mean, you can get away with\nquite a bit of nonsense as someone\n\n697\n00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:54,155\nwalking into a courtroom nowadays.\n\n698\n00:37:54,155 --> 00:37:57,785\nJust as someone that has to go to court\nbecause they've been summoned for\n\n699\n00:37:57,785 --> 00:38:00,265\na traffic ticket or something like that.\n\n700\n00:38:00,265 --> 00:38:04,475\nYou see the nonsense that\npeople go into courtrooms with.\n\n701\n00:38:04,475 --> 00:38:05,935\nIt's like, what do you think this is?\n\n702\n00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:08,848\nIt used to be that people would go\nto court and they would, a suit and\n\n703\n00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:09,745\ntie no matter what.\n\n704\n00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,875\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n>> They could dress like\n\n705\n00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:13,940\ntrash outside on the street\nas much as they want.\n\n706\n00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,860\nGo into a courtroom,\nyou better have a suit and\n\n707\n00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,720\ntie, a nice sweater on, button down shirt.\n\n708\n00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,910\nYou better be dressed well.\n\n709\n00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,130\nOtherwise it was gonna look really bad for\nyou.\n\n710\n00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,050\nNow society's standards have changed,\nbut the courts really haven't.\n\n711\n00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,760\nSo you see people go into courtrooms.\n\n712\n00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,470\nI remember hearing something sometime ago\nwhere a judge finally had enough of it and\n\n713\n00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,570\ntold people that came into his courtroom.\n\n714\n00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,740\nHe says, you are not allowed to wear,\n\n715\n00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,630\nyou see people walking around\nwith those pajama things outside.\n\n716\n00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,614\nHe goes, no you're not wearing those.\n\n717\n00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,445\nHe goes, you come into my court\nroom with those things, he says,\n\n718\n00:38:48,445 --> 00:38:50,610\nyou stand a good chance of\nbeing held in contempt.\n\n719\n00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,220\nHe goes, I will definitely throw you\nout and make you come back another day.\n\n720\n00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,980\nHe says, you will not be tried.\n\n721\n00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,620\nHe goes, that's gonna be your fault.\n\n722\n00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,190\nHe says, any consequences that would\ngo with that are gonna be yours.\n\n723\n00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,870\nSo people do those little shenanigans,\nt-shirts, jeans, stuff like that.\n\n724\n00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,520\nThey can do that, you can't.\n\n725\n00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,568\n>> Not as an expert witness.\n\n726\n00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,120\nI'm not gonna show up in my rock\nconcert t-shirt and flip-flops and\n\n727\n00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,190\nthings like that and it is for\na few reasons, right?\n\n728\n00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,770\nIt's that air of professionalism\nthat we wanna present.\n\n729\n00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:23,750\nIt is the respect that we're trying to\ngarner from the people in that room that\n\n730\n00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,202\nwe are a professional.\n\n731\n00:39:25,202 --> 00:39:28,737\nAnd it's out of respect for\nthe courtroom and the judge, himself or\n\n732\n00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:30,111\nherself as well, right?\n\n733\n00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:32,190\nAnd so, there's a combination of things.\n\n734\n00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:36,320\nAnd whether you think a three\npiece suit is good or bad.\n\n735\n00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,600\nOr you think that this should be\nconsidered professional attire or\n\n736\n00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,440\nwhat have you,\nthat doesn't really come into play here.\n\n737\n00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,790\nIt's the perception that you're showing in\nthat courtroom, and that's what matters.\n\n738\n00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,000\n>> Yeah, it carries a lot of weight.\n\n739\n00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,550\nYou can't come in, t-shirt and jeans.\n\n740\n00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,890\nIt's just not gonna fly.\n\n741\n00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,845\nI said, you can't come in wearing\na concert t-shirt from Metallica or\n\n742\n00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:02,305\nsomething like that.\n\n743\n00:40:02,305 --> 00:40:05,710\nCuz they're not a good band anyway,\nfrom what I've heard.\n\n744\n00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,320\n>> We were talking about that earlier,\nas a matter of fact.\n\n745\n00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,238\n>> But remember that.\n\n746\n00:40:09,238 --> 00:40:11,479\nIt's your bearing, and\nwhat you're projecting.\n\n747\n00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:14,033\nYou wanna present a certain image.\n\n748\n00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:17,120\nYou're a professional, whether you\nagree with wearing a suit or not.\n\n749\n00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,020\nI had wearing suits.\n\n750\n00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,510\n>> I hate suits.\nI can't stand putting a tie\n\n751\n00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,540\naround my neck.\n\n752\n00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,370\nBut if I got to go to court,\nI darn sure, have to.\n\n753\n00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,695\n>> Yeah I don't like them.\n\n754\n00:40:26,695 --> 00:40:28,315\nI own a couple.\n\n755\n00:40:28,315 --> 00:40:30,815\nCan't tell you last time, I wore them.\n\n756\n00:40:30,815 --> 00:40:34,975\nAnd that's hey, if I have to wear a suit\nand tie, I've got to wear a suit and\n\n757\n00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,615\ntie for this thing.\n\n758\n00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:38,175\nIt's the way that game is played.\n\n759\n00:40:38,175 --> 00:40:41,725\nYou are playing a game, and\nall those things fit together.\n\n760\n00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:44,175\nSo just be prepared for that.\n\n761\n00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:50,270\nIt's professionalism, you have to carry\nyourself a certain way, act a certain way.\n\n762\n00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,820\nUse certain mannerisms.\n\n763\n00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,850\nEverything is being scrutinized.\n\n764\n00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,360\nEvery little detail is being scrutinized.\n\n765\n00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,620\nI mean heck.\n\n766\n00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:02,070\nWhen I say everything is being\nscrutinized, I just think of,\n\n767\n00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:07,570\nyou could still wear a suit, and\nyou know, look like you walked\n\n768\n00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:12,370\noff the cover of a fashion magazine, but\nthen all of a sudden, if they turn over,\n\n769\n00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,450\nand you've got your finger buried up to,\nits knuckle up your nose, yeah,\n\n770\n00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,400\nthat just changed their opinion of you,\nreally quick.\n\n771\n00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,850\nIt's going to be like, your doing what?\n\n772\n00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:30,130\nJust remember everything, if you have\nto practice in front of the mirror.\n\n773\n00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:36,180\nI know people that do that, and\ntake a good look at, everything do it.\n\n774\n00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,520\nAbsolutely.\n\n775\n00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,290\n>> Just see the type of image,\nyou're projecting.\n\n776\n00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,300\n>> And being polite is another thing,\nthat's gonna go a long way in\n\n777\n00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,030\nprojecting that air,\nthat we're trying to do.\n\n778\n00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,910\n>> Yeah, be very, very polite.\n\n779\n00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,020\n>> Yes sir, no sir, yes ma'am, no ma'am.\n\n780\n00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,870\nYour honor, things like that.\n\n781\n00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:02,720\nAnd that goes a long way to the\nimpression, that you're leaving on people,\n\n782\n00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,570\nwhich then can also lead to how\nthey perceive the information,\n\n783\n00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,840\nthat you're delivering.\n\n784\n00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:13,165\n>> Yes, it definitely can,\nif you're not polite.\n\n785\n00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:17,820\nAnd not addressing people, a correct way.\n\n786\n00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:22,090\nNo matter how much they're picking on\nyou or drilling you, drilling on you.\n\n787\n00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:26,840\nI mean, if you got the hostile side\nof this case, beating on you, and\n\n788\n00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,220\ntrying to discredit you.\n\n789\n00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:34,690\nI mean, that's essentially going to come\ndown, to almost like a personal attack.\n\n790\n00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,950\nYou know,\nyou can't take it as a personal attack.\n\n791\n00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,830\nEven if they are gearing it that way.\n\n792\n00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,420\nIt's just okay.\n\n793\n00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:45,480\nYou've got to be yes, and smile,\nand counter their argument.\n\n794\n00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,620\nBut you can't.\n\n795\n00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,450\nEngage in things like name calling,\nor making comments like-\n\n796\n00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,210\n>> Getting irate and\n\n797\n00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,950\npounding your fists down, things like.\n\n798\n00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,320\nIt's one of the things I love to see.\n\n799\n00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,390\nIt's when that defense attorney or\nprosecutor,\n\n800\n00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,280\nwhoever is hitting that witness.\n\n801\n00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,650\nTries to just tear him up,\nand poke holes in everything.\n\n802\n00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,190\nAnd that person, just calmly sits there,\nand goes, yes sir, no sir.\n\n803\n00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,430\nOr just relays the facts.\n\n804\n00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,890\nAnd pretty much completely ignores.\n\n805\n00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:11,670\nI mean, it just defuses the entire\nsituation, and it makes that person,\n\n806\n00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,490\nyou know, that defense attorney, or\nthat prosecutor, look bad in my opinion.\n\n807\n00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,330\nI think,\nit actually puts it right back on them.\n\n808\n00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,540\nWhen you're the bigger person, and\nyou maintain your composure, and\n\n809\n00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:27,250\nyou just deliver what\nyou're supposed to deliver.\n\n810\n00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,030\n>> Yeah, if an attorney, or\nwhomever is examining you, and\n\n811\n00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:34,220\nthey're trying to engage you in something,\nand they will try to engage you in those\n\n812\n00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:39,570\ntype of verbal battles, don't bite\ndown on that, don't take the bait.\n\n813\n00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,700\nBecause they're trying to\nmake you uncomfortable,\n\n814\n00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:47,930\nthey're trying to get you to slip up,\nbecause, that just helps them out.\n\n815\n00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,740\nSo don't play that game.\n\n816\n00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,310\nThat would be another thing, as far as\nchoosing yourself, are you suitable for\n\n817\n00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,140\nan expert witness.\n\n818\n00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:58,030\nIf you're someone that gets emotional,\nbecause someone says the littlest thing,\n\n819\n00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:02,170\nthis thing to you,\nthen this is not for you.\n\n820\n00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:06,930\nYou know, you're gonna have to take a\nwhole ton of anger management classes, and\n\n821\n00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:09,320\ntherapy, before you're suited for that.\n\n822\n00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:14,525\nAnd, like you said, there's people\nthat if you just act calm like,\n\n823\n00:44:14,525 --> 00:44:19,980\n[LAUGH] and I love it, that's one of my\nfavorite things to do, if someone just\n\n824\n00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,570\nis mad at me, and is yelling at me, and\nI don't know what their problem is,\n\n825\n00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:30,940\nI'm like, what's this, is just to talk,\ntalk at a normal voice, be really calm.\n\n826\n00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,180\nIt's funny, because you're watching even\nmatter, because they're not getting a rise\n\n827\n00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:40,490\nout of you, and you'll also see them\nget ready to have a stroke sometimes.\n\n828\n00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:41,940\nThey're like, what, when?\n\n829\n00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,490\nIt's like, okay,\n\n830\n00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:49,940\nyou're completely refusing to\nacknowledge their emotional state.\n\n831\n00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,790\nYou'll respond to their stuff,\nbut you're emotional state, okay.\n\n832\n00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,580\nDon't get into a yelling match,\nit can help you out.\n\n833\n00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,580\n>> Exactly.\nA little Dr. Phil for everybody.\n\n834\n00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,430\nRemember, somebody can't make you angry.\n\n835\n00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,642\nYou have to choose, to respond with anger.\n\n836\n00:45:04,642 --> 00:45:05,590\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n837\n00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,960\n>> So anyway,\n\n838\n00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,090\nwe do have to be enthusiastic as well.\n\n839\n00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,480\nI mean, if we're bored with\nthe information that we're delivering,\n\n840\n00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,800\nwhat's that going to do to the rest\nof the people in that courtroom?\n\n841\n00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,300\n>> Yeah, you've gotta show some\nenthusiasm for it, some passion for this.\n\n842\n00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,380\nIt makes you seem more engaged.\n\n843\n00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,870\nIt makes you seem more human.\n\n844\n00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:28,460\nIt makes you seem a lot of things.\n\n845\n00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,634\nSo you really want to show that enthusiasm\nfor that topic, because it shows that.\n\n846\n00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:38,995\nIt just shows you are,\ndemonstrates that you like what you do.\n\n847\n00:45:38,995 --> 00:45:43,305\nThat it's not just something that you\ndo to pass the time, for example.\n\n848\n00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:45,835\nThat you are involved in this.\n\n849\n00:45:45,835 --> 00:45:49,175\nSo you wanna make sure that,\nthat's projected.\n\n850\n00:45:49,175 --> 00:45:54,090\nI mean, I would say, just to kinda\nlook at it from a different angle.\n\n851\n00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:58,490\nIf you're someone that just\ndispassionately just talks,\n\n852\n00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:03,750\nand you're just very clinical, you're\nmonotone, I just think of stuff from\n\n853\n00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:08,226\na Charlie Brown cartoon with\na teacher in the background.\n\n854\n00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:10,130\nIt just gets tuned out after a while.\n\n855\n00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,810\nYou know, changing inflection in your\nvoice, and getting that excitement, and\n\n856\n00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:14,600\neverything in there.\n\n857\n00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,160\nKeeps people engaged.\n\n858\n00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,320\nWe can't just sit there, and\n\n859\n00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,710\nmaintain the same tone, the same bearing,\nbecause people's brains get shut off.\n\n860\n00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,900\nAnd then, when their brains get shut off,\nthey may miss\n\n861\n00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:31,390\nthe thing that you're trying to present,\nand then that works against you.\n\n862\n00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,330\n>> Yeah.\n>> So you'll have to practice that,\n\n863\n00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:37,020\nand that's another thing that could\nrule you out as an expert witness.\n\n864\n00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,550\nYou have to have presentation skills.\n\n865\n00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:40,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> You have to have very good\n\n866\n00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:41,690\npresentation skills,\n\n867\n00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:47,380\nand there's people that also are confident\nenough to talk in front of people.\n\n868\n00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,560\nAnd they know their stuff, but they\nhave zip as far as presentation skills.\n\n869\n00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,610\n>> Yep.\n\n870\n00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,870\nOh, sorry, go ahead.\n\n871\n00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:55,770\n>> Go ahead.\n\n872\n00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,160\n>> And\nthat brings up a very good point, too.\n\n873\n00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,250\nYou mention the word confident,\nbecause we do have, to have confidence,\n\n874\n00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,480\nin the information that we're delivering.\n\n875\n00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,620\nIf we sound like we're unsure of this\nexpert testimony that we're presenting,\n\n876\n00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,800\nthat's not gonna look good either, is it?\n\n877\n00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,510\nYeah.\nIt's just not.\n\n878\n00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:16,320\nSo, there's point where you go from,\nI would also say,\n\n879\n00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,150\nthere's a point where you go from\nbeing confident to being cocky.\n\n880\n00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,200\n>> Yes.\n>> And you don't want that either.\n\n881\n00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,420\nThat just looks like, everyone in\nthe jury wants to line you up, and\n\n882\n00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,450\npunch you in the face.\n\n883\n00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,150\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n884\n00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:27,652\n>> You know?\n\n885\n00:47:27,652 --> 00:47:28,584\nYou don't want that.\n\n886\n00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:30,330\nYou want something that shows,\n\n887\n00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,330\nthat you know your stuff,\nthat you can talk, and\n\n888\n00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:38,180\nthat you are engaged in what you\nare doing, and keep people's attention.\n\n889\n00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,090\nNot every one can do that.\n\n890\n00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:46,420\nYou see that in every feel, where you\nhave to do some sort of presentation.\n\n891\n00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,660\nWe're both instructors.\n\n892\n00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:51,740\nHow many times have you heard someone say,\nI know work, or\n\n893\n00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,610\nExcel, or something really well,\nI should be a teacher.\n\n894\n00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:55,968\nI should go instruct on it.\n\n895\n00:47:55,968 --> 00:47:57,400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like okay.\n\n896\n00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,820\nWell hold on.\n\n897\n00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:02,340\nNot saying you shouldn't be that,\nbut, you know,\n\n898\n00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,180\nhave you presented before,\ndo you know how to present?\n\n899\n00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:09,133\nAre you okay with people that may not be\ngetting what you're talking about, and\n\n900\n00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:12,330\nkeep asking questions, and\nthose questions to you may be dumb?\n\n901\n00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,909\nYou know, can you deal with that?\n\n902\n00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:16,431\nIf you can't deal with those sorts\nof things, and oddball stuff, and\n\n903\n00:48:16,431 --> 00:48:16,961\npeople even.\n\n904\n00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,561\nYou're irritated and upset, and all that.\n\n905\n00:48:19,561 --> 00:48:24,493\nIf you can't deal with that, and\nwithout getting mad or angry, or short or\n\n906\n00:48:24,493 --> 00:48:27,250\nanything, then you can't be a teacher.\n\n907\n00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,940\nYou just cannot do this position.\n\n908\n00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,350\nSo it would be the same thing,\nwith an expert witness.\n\n909\n00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,960\nIt's that, you can know your stuff,\nyou can be confident at it,\n\n910\n00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,930\nthat you know your stuff.\n\n911\n00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,210\nBut, you've gotta engage.\n\n912\n00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,870\nRemember, it's a dynamic environment.\n\n913\n00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:42,060\nYou're not just going up there,\nand giving a report.\n\n914\n00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,510\nYou are having someone,\nasking you questions.\n\n915\n00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,400\nAnd then, speaking of asking questions, if\nI don't know the answer to the question,\n\n916\n00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,280\nI typically just guess,\nthrow anything out.\n\n917\n00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,540\nJust wing it.\n\n918\n00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,000\n>> No.\nDon't guess.\n\n919\n00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,660\n>> Don't do that.\n\n920\n00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,420\n>> Do not guess.\n\n921\n00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,520\nDo not surmise.\n\n922\n00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,150\nDo not make stuff up.\n\n923\n00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:04,350\nIf you get to a situation,\nwhere they're trying to back\n\n924\n00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:09,220\nyou into a corner, or even just trying to,\nkind of, see, can you make a guess?\n\n925\n00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,280\nAnd you just need to politely say,\n\n926\n00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,130\nI really wouldn't care\nto make a guess on that.\n\n927\n00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,250\n>> You can leave it at that.\n\n928\n00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,720\nI really wouldn't care to make a guess.\n\n929\n00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,440\n>> And that's respect to where they're\ngoing to, respect that you don't,\n\n930\n00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,670\nthat you're admitting,\nthat you don't know it.\n\n931\n00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,660\nAnd they're not going to\njust make something up.\n\n932\n00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,020\nThat makes everything else,\nthat you said, carry more weight.\n\n933\n00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:34,630\nBecause now, they know that\nthey can assume, or infer from,\n\n934\n00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:36,350\nthat I guess would be\na better way to say it.\n\n935\n00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:39,640\nThat wow, if they didn't know they\nwouldn't say it, so I'm gonna say,\n\n936\n00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,440\nthat most of what they have said,\nthey were very confident, and sure of.\n\n937\n00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,430\n>> Yeah.\nThat's the thing.\n\n938\n00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,060\nIt'd be one big thing on there.\n\n939\n00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,580\nDo not guess, do not make stuff up.\n\n940\n00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,010\nDon't say, well.\n\n941\n00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:55,090\nAnything that is just so\noff, the cuff like that,\n\n942\n00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:58,110\nbecause it just doesn't look good.\n\n943\n00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:02,000\nYou're a professional, you've given\nyour conclusion, your facts, and\n\n944\n00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,130\nyou've mixed your opinion in that.\n\n945\n00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,540\nOpinion is not the same as a Guess,\nyou are basing your opinion,\n\n946\n00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,840\nas we said, on facts.\n\n947\n00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,260\nSo, a Guess is something that\nyou're kind of making up,\n\n948\n00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,000\nsome wild theory, and\nthat just doesn't work.\n\n949\n00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:23,420\nThere's a big, big, big differences there.\n\n950\n00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,230\nI think of Guesses and Opinions.\n\n951\n00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:30,690\nYou know, kind of like,\nyou know the JFK assassination?\n\n952\n00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,850\nWe have people, that are still\nconspiracy theorists on that.\n\n953\n00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,910\nThey've had opinions and conclusions,\n\n954\n00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:42,390\nthat support the prevailing theory,\nthat Oswald got a couple shots off.\n\n955\n00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:45,000\nAnd they've proven,\nthat certain way things move,\n\n956\n00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,010\nthat's just the way it happened.\n\n957\n00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,600\nBut then, there's people making\nall sorts of wild guesses.\n\n958\n00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,130\nYeah, there's a guy over there.\n\n959\n00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,410\nAliens did it, or Castro was down there.\n\n960\n00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:53,830\nThe weird things that people come up with.\n\n961\n00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:57,610\nThose are all Guesses, and they all come\noff looking like wackos, no matter how\n\n962\n00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:02,370\nfar they go, that's kind of the way I look\nat it, is, that you've got the guesses,\n\n963\n00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:05,910\nthat just look wild,\nit's like where are you getting this from.\n\n964\n00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:07,530\nAnd then you have the Opinion, like,\n\n965\n00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:11,610\nthis is my Opinion,\ncould you make a guess for us.\n\n966\n00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:15,538\nNo I'd really care not to make\na Guess on that, thank you very much.\n\n967\n00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:22,550\nAnd then we have to speak slowly.\n\n968\n00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,560\n>> We should both do that.\n\n969\n00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,098\nAnd see, if we can get people, just to\nget up, and hit their media player.\n\n970\n00:51:31,098 --> 00:51:36,050\n>> [LAUGH] I mean, not quite that slowly,\nbut it is important that we enunciate.\n\n971\n00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,630\nAnd we don't, cuz It's easy.\n\n972\n00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,280\nTrust me.\n\n973\n00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,990\nI'm in front of a camera, all the time,\nI've taught for many years,\n\n974\n00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,150\nI know you have.\n\n975\n00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:45,960\nWhen you get nervous, it's really\neasy to start talking fast, and\n\n976\n00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,470\nthen people have a hard time understanding\nyou, and it's just not a good thing.\n\n977\n00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:52,810\nWe wanna make sure,\nyou take a deep breath, and\n\n978\n00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:58,110\nrelax, and enunciate each one of\nyour words, and speak clearly.\n\n979\n00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,780\n>> Yes, that is it.\n\n980\n00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:07,450\nClearly, concisely, confidently,\nit's the better way to do things.\n\n981\n00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:13,370\nYou're absolutely right, people have\na tendency, if they don't know something.\n\n982\n00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:16,570\nTo just talk, way, way, way too fast.\n\n983\n00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,750\nAnd then, they start talking lower.\n\n984\n00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,150\nAnd they start mumbling.\n\n985\n00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,304\n>> Yes [LAUGH]\n>> And now,\n\n986\n00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,062\nall those things make\nyou just look like crap.\n\n987\n00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:24,833\nYou don't know what you're talking about.\n\n988\n00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,420\nYou don't look confident.\n\n989\n00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,084\nAnd you just look like a little rat,\ndoing that sort of thing.\n\n990\n00:52:30,084 --> 00:52:31,582\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So don't do that.\n\n991\n00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:34,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Give yourself, the time.\n\n992\n00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:38,760\nSpeak slowly about it,\nspeak clearly, speak confidently.\n\n993\n00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:44,580\nTake a deep breath, if you have to, and\njust go about doing the whole thing.\n\n994\n00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:48,590\nI'd also add into that, by the way,\njust from a physical thing,\n\n995\n00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:53,210\na tip is that I've gotten caught\non doing this sort of thing.\n\n996\n00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,860\nIt's not something that looks, you know\nbad, you may have seen me here on camera\n\n997\n00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,640\na couple of times, do this, is sometimes\nwhen I start talking about something,\n\n998\n00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,560\nI get enthusiastic, I start talking\na little faster, and if you talk too fast,\n\n999\n00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,720\nsometimes you end up swallowing\nair as part of your thing, so\n\n1000\n00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,271\nall of a sudden it looks like you're\nburping, or something like that.\n\n1001\n00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:15,049\n[LAUGH] You're like, you may have\nseen me do that, a couple times.\n\n1002\n00:53:15,049 --> 00:53:17,235\nI do that, from time to time, so.\n\n1003\n00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,830\n[LAUGH] And everyone can do that.\n\n1004\n00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,220\n>> Oh yeah, absolutely.\n\n1005\n00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,710\n>> If you talk slowly-\n>> And carefully about it,\n\n1006\n00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:28,680\nmore meticulous about it, you have\nless of as a tendency, to do that.\n\n1007\n00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,180\nSo be aware of that.\n\n1008\n00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,230\nThat's just a physiological thing.\n\n1009\n00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:35,900\n>> And there's nothing wrong, with\ntaking a second to gather your thoughts.\n\n1010\n00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,310\nDecide what it is you're going to say.\n\n1011\n00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:43,120\nAnd that's where Ben puts in something\nabout filler words, that we all have,\n\n1012\n00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,670\nand that we all use.\n\n1013\n00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,830\nWe really wanna focus on that,\nand try to avoid them.\n\n1014\n00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:50,410\nIt's one of the things, as a show host,\nI worry about all the time,\n\n1015\n00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:54,558\nis there's certain words I use, when I'm\ntrying to figure out, what I'm gonna say.\n\n1016\n00:53:54,558 --> 00:53:58,980\nI'll say uh-huh, okay, or\nactually or what have you, and\n\n1017\n00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,880\nit's just that word starts repeating over\nand over, and things like that, so yeah.\n\n1018\n00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,640\nJust take your time, relax,\nfigure out what it is you wanna say.\n\n1019\n00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,380\n>> And then say it.\n\n1020\n00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,030\nYou don't need those filler words,\nlike that.\n\n1021\n00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:13,180\nBut it's a easy thing to slip into.\n\n1022\n00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,600\n>> Yeah, it definitely is.\n\n1023\n00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,720\nThere's filler words.\n\n1024\n00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,530\nThere's stuttering.\n\n1025\n00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:21,810\nActually, it's kinda funny\nto mention the filler words.\n\n1026\n00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:24,110\nAnd you guys are talking about that.\n\n1027\n00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:28,950\nI got a friend of mine, out in California,\nwho tuned in for one of the days here.\n\n1028\n00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,030\nAnd she does communication, and\nstuff like that at a college.\n\n1029\n00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,590\nShe teaches this stuff.\n\n1030\n00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:35,680\nAnd she says, you know,\nhow many filler words you're using?\n\n1031\n00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,250\nShe says, you know,\nhow much you're stuttering?\n\n1032\n00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:40,201\nAnd I'm like, yeah, tell me that,\nbefore I go back on air.\n\n1033\n00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:40,721\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1034\n00:54:40,721 --> 00:54:42,061\nTen minutes before I'm on screen here,\nyeah.\n\n1035\n00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:42,917\n>> So I'm even more conscious.\n\n1036\n00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:44,450\nYeah, she did.\nShe's literally doing that.\n\n1037\n00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:47,012\nAnd if she's watching now,\nI hate you for doing that.\n\n1038\n00:54:47,012 --> 00:54:47,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1039\n00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:49,400\n>> It definitely\n\n1040\n00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,840\nis something that you gotta think about.\n\n1041\n00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,550\nYou guys, if you know my filler words,\ngo ahead, and\n\n1042\n00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:55,700\nthrow them in the chat room there.\n\n1043\n00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,130\nI wanna see, what I say all the time.\n\n1044\n00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:00,100\n[LAUGH] Cause I do have a hard time going\nback, and watching myself sometimes.\n\n1045\n00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,780\nI'm afraid, I'm gonna see it and go,\noh my gosh, and never go on camera again.\n\n1046\n00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,900\nBut we all do, sometimes when we have to,\nwe can't figure out what it is we want\n\n1047\n00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,950\nto say, or we're trying to\nformulate a thought in our head.\n\n1048\n00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,830\nWe don't like that silence, that awkward\nsilence, and things like that, but\n\n1049\n00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:19,220\nit can be very thought provoking, or it\ncan be very who put that in the chat room?\n\n1050\n00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:24,810\nSomeone who put it in the chat room there,\nsomething about, sounds more considered.\n\n1051\n00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:29,840\nThat brief pause, kind of puts emphasis on\nthe next thing you are going to say, and\n\n1052\n00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,315\nit gives you a chance to think about,\nwhat you are going to say.\n\n1053\n00:55:32,315 --> 00:55:35,340\n[LAUGH] Remember there's a certain\ndegree of showmanship here.\n\n1054\n00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> We've said that already,\n\n1055\n00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,810\nit's theatre to a certain degree so\nyeah those dramatic pauses.\n\n1056\n00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,373\nThere's dramatic pauses, and\nthere's pregnant pauses.\n\n1057\n00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:46,320\n[LAUGH] Which are way too long so.\n\n1058\n00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,450\n[LAUGH] Make sure you know,\nwhich one's which.\n\n1059\n00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,530\n>> Right.\n>> If you hear crickets\n\n1060\n00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,670\n>> You've taken too long.\n\n1061\n00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:53,460\n>> Yeah.\n\n1062\n00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,490\n>> I'd also, just another\nlittle thing in here, tell you.\n\n1063\n00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:01,156\nAnother little tip from me to you,\nit's like kind of,\n\n1064\n00:56:01,156 --> 00:56:05,314\na little bit outside of this,\nbut it could come into account.\n\n1065\n00:56:05,314 --> 00:56:11,153\nBe careful what you even eat,\nbefore you go, into a court room.\n\n1066\n00:56:11,153 --> 00:56:15,019\n[LAUGH] You might be surprised, but\nmaybe, not that how much, that affects.\n\n1067\n00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:17,898\nHow you present and how you talk.\n\n1068\n00:56:17,898 --> 00:56:20,410\nThose of you that have\nto do presentations.\n\n1069\n00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:26,360\nBefore a presentation, you should not be\neating or drinking any dairy products.\n\n1070\n00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,130\nThat causes a lot of problems.\n\n1071\n00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:32,730\nYour body generates more mucus\nwhen you have those things.\n\n1072\n00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,470\nIf you eat a piece of string cheese or\n\n1073\n00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:38,990\ndrink a glass of milk, you will get\nmore mucus built up in your throat, so\n\n1074\n00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:41,250\nwhat's going to happen when\nyou're doing your present?\n\n1075\n00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,850\nThat.\n>> [LAUGH] What you guys didn't hear\n\n1076\n00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:46,520\nbecause I've got a handy dandy\ncough Clinton back here.\n\n1077\n00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,300\nBut you guys won't have that\ncough button if you're up in\n\n1078\n00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,990\nthe courtroom sitting on a,\ngosh can't even think of the term now.\n\n1079\n00:56:54,990 --> 00:57:01,870\nYou know if you're presenting evidence,\nso make sure you're, don't eat dairy.\n\n1080\n00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:02,780\n>> Yeah.\n\n1081\n00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,494\n>> I was sitting here thinking wait, where\nis he going with this, if I eat a big old\n\n1082\n00:57:06,494 --> 00:57:10,179\nsub with onions and peppers all over it\nI'm gonna [SOUND] breathe on the judge.\n\n1083\n00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:13,510\n>> Yeah, you could.\n\n1084\n00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,364\nAnd knock him out.\n\n1085\n00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:15,789\n[LAUGH] You could.\n\n1086\n00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:22,430\nThere's people that do shows and\npresentations where they have basically\n\n1087\n00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:28,080\nembargos, restrictions, whatever you wanna\ncall it, that say you don't eat any meals.\n\n1088\n00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,475\nThat involve fish for\na half a day before the event.\n\n1089\n00:57:30,475 --> 00:57:31,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1090\n00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:35,660\n>> Because they don't want that\nsmell coming off of your breath\n\n1091\n00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:39,500\nwhen something gets close to you or\nanything else because it's just repulsive.\n\n1092\n00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:44,595\nSome people will do that, I don't know\nif that's gonna matter in a court room.\n\n1093\n00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:47,905\nYou know, you just had a big can of tuna,\nand the honor's like,\n\n1094\n00:57:47,905 --> 00:57:50,835\nwhat the hell did you just do?\n\n1095\n00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:56,022\nBut the dairy thing is a well known one,\nMcKayla just pointed out,\n\n1096\n00:57:56,022 --> 00:58:02,122\nsingers never do that before singing\nbecause it does generate that extra\n\n1097\n00:58:02,122 --> 00:58:06,710\nmucus in there and you don't want\nto be on the stage [COUGH] hold on\n\n1098\n00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:11,610\n[COUGH] that just looks bad,\nthat looks really bad.\n\n1099\n00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,863\nYou know, they're gonna go,\nare you gonna die?\n\n1100\n00:58:13,863 --> 00:58:15,023\n[LAUGH] Are you that nervous, or what?\n\n1101\n00:58:15,023 --> 00:58:18,970\n[LAUGH] It does look like a nervous habit,\nso it's those little things,\n\n1102\n00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,300\nand most people don't think about that.\n\n1103\n00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,920\nYou know, singers would think about that\nbecause that's something that's taught\n\n1104\n00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,200\nreally early on.\n\n1105\n00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,790\nBut don't do it.\n\n1106\n00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:29,290\nI don't care how much dairy you like,\nyou like ice cream or whatever.\n\n1107\n00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,220\nDon't eat that stuff.\n\n1108\n00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,990\nAnd they're not the only foods that do it.\n\n1109\n00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,712\nSo just be prepared for that.\n\n1110\n00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:38,380\n>> All right, and then we got using\ngraphics in our presentation.\n\n1111\n00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:44,790\n>> Yes, you know use graphics if it's\nappropriate and I would say there's a lot\n\n1112\n00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:49,890\nof times where it's appropriate with the\ntype of stuff that we're talking about.\n\n1113\n00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:51,750\nWhen you're talking about computers.\n\n1114\n00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:56,130\nIt's already a lot of people have this,\nI won't say phobia, but\n\n1115\n00:58:56,130 --> 00:59:02,240\nthey've got a thing with computers that,\noh, well those are there own things and\n\n1116\n00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,810\nthey're nervous about\nthem to a certain degree.\n\n1117\n00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:12,160\nBut what you can do is you can use graphs\nand charts and stuff like that to make it.\n\n1118\n00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,750\nTo make it more understandable.\n\n1119\n00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,170\nI mean, just think about this.\n\n1120\n00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:21,490\nTry when you talk about\nrecovering files of a hard drive.\n\n1121\n00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:24,416\nTry explaining file\ncarving without graphics.\n\n1122\n00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:25,466\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n1123\n00:59:25,466 --> 00:59:27,380\n[LAUGH]\n>> We were fortunate enough.\n\n1124\n00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,730\nMike and I were fortunate enough here.\n\n1125\n00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:31,340\nWhen we were talking about\nthat topic of file carving.\n\n1126\n00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,410\nThat we're dealing with people that are\ntechnically astute and know their stuff.\n\n1127\n00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:39,190\nAnd then we also have the A plus\nout there that we told you.\n\n1128\n00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:40,450\nGo to that and take a look at it.\n\n1129\n00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,090\nIf you're still having problems with it.\n\n1130\n00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:46,170\nSo we're fortunate enough to have\nthose two things working in our favor.\n\n1131\n00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,735\nYou will not have those in a court room.\n\n1132\n00:59:48,735 --> 00:59:51,585\nSo if you have to use charts and\n\n1133\n00:59:51,585 --> 00:59:56,525\ngraphs or whatever to break down\nthese very complicated technical\n\n1134\n00:59:56,525 --> 01:00:00,775\ntopics into something that is easier for\nthe layperson to understand,\n\n1135\n01:00:00,775 --> 01:00:06,580\nremember eight grade level education,\nwrite for that and prepare for that.\n\n1136\n01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:10,250\nYou're gonna look that much better,\nyou will look like hey,\n\n1137\n01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:14,890\nyou had your act together,\nyou've got something nice, clear and\n\n1138\n01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:18,140\neasy to understand and\nyou can move on to the next point.\n\n1139\n01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:23,290\nThat's what you have and really,\nreally encourage it wherever appropriate.\n\n1140\n01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,980\n>> And\nthe other thing we want to do is practice.\n\n1141\n01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,740\nWe don't want to be walking into that\ncourt room, the first time we've gone over\n\n1142\n01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,540\nwhat we plan to say in front\nof the Jury and Judge.\n\n1143\n01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,640\n>> Yes, rehearse as much as possible\nwhat you are going to say and\n\n1144\n01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,240\nwhat you are going to go through.\n\n1145\n01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,320\nA lot of that rehearsal is going to be\n\n1146\n01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,890\nlike how you say you were talking\nabout your Dad doing that.\n\n1147\n01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:47,319\nHow you say things.\n\n1148\n01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:55,430\nAnd your phrases are all very\nimportant because you could say\n\n1149\n01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:59,590\nthe same thing a number of different\nways with different phrases and\n\n1150\n01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:03,840\ndifferent flections and even though\nthey all technically say the same thing.\n\n1151\n01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:10,290\nBecause of the way they're presented, they\njust come off as being not the same thing.\n\n1152\n01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:13,340\nThere could be a different\nattachment to it.\n\n1153\n01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:17,670\nThat literally goes down to\nthe specific words that you use.\n\n1154\n01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:22,150\nYou don't want people to\nbe confused by anything,\n\n1155\n01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:26,080\nyou don't want to be left out of sorts.\n\n1156\n01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:31,130\nI can't think of one situation\na might given example of it.\n\n1157\n01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:33,640\nIs with your wording is,\n\n1158\n01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:38,140\nI know I was working on a project\nsome time ago with people in India.\n\n1159\n01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:42,160\nAnd you know they use English over there,\nwe use English over here.\n\n1160\n01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,930\nSo, okay, but we do know that even though\nthere's english used in several places,\n\n1161\n01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:50,110\nit's not the same english you know.\n\n1162\n01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,620\nWe could go to Mckayla being from the UK,\n\n1163\n01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,410\nshe knows we don't speak\nthe same type of english.\n\n1164\n01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:58,460\n[LAUGH] There's basically\nBritish English and American English,\n\n1165\n01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,100\nit's not the same thing.\n\n1166\n01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,240\nIt's close but not the same thing.\n\n1167\n01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:08,470\nBut yeah, the situation I'm\nthinking of you know, we were\n\n1168\n01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:13,500\nwriting something that said, something\nabout the former version of the product.\n\n1169\n01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:19,000\nThe Indian guys reformatted to say that\nerstwhile version, it's the same thing,\n\n1170\n01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,175\nbut you know how many people that where\nsmart people had to go on erstwhile.\n\n1171\n01:02:23,175 --> 01:02:24,655\nWhat the hell is that?\n\n1172\n01:02:24,655 --> 01:02:26,495\nThey're googling that and everything.\n\n1173\n01:02:26,495 --> 01:02:28,735\nAnd everyone just tuned out\nas soon as this guy said it.\n\n1174\n01:02:28,735 --> 01:02:30,855\nAnd I'm like, what did you put in there?\n\n1175\n01:02:30,855 --> 01:02:32,145\nI go why did you use that word?\n\n1176\n01:02:32,145 --> 01:02:34,005\nHe goes, it means the same thing.\n\n1177\n01:02:34,005 --> 01:02:35,985\nNo one uses that over here.\n\n1178\n01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:39,985\nNo one uses erstwhile, you know,\nunless you're reading something\n\n1179\n01:02:39,985 --> 01:02:44,140\nlike 16th century english or something\nyou're not going to be using it over here.\n\n1180\n01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:46,810\nYou know, so,\nit had to be changed back to former.\n\n1181\n01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:50,540\nYou know if that situation had\nhappened in a court room, come one.\n\n1182\n01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:53,860\n>> Could have cost him something.\n\n1183\n01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:56,290\n>> Yeah you know you get people that are.\n\n1184\n01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:58,005\nAgain that eighth grade type level.\n\n1185\n01:02:58,005 --> 01:03:00,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That's not something where\n\n1186\n01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:02,700\na typical eighth grader is\ngonna be familiar with or know.\n\n1187\n01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,630\nSo it's not something you should use.\n\n1188\n01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:07,835\nFormer's something that has a broad\naudience people understand.\n\n1189\n01:03:07,835 --> 01:03:09,038\nErstwhile does not.\n\n1190\n01:03:09,038 --> 01:03:11,870\n>> Right, and then the other thing we\ngotta be concerned with is the media.\n\n1191\n01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:14,080\nRight, the news and all that type.\n\n1192\n01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,730\n>> Yeah.\nThat is probably gonna be public enemy\n\n1193\n01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:22,430\nnumber one in a lot of cases is the media\nis gonna try to squeeze stuff out of you.\n\n1194\n01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:23,170\nBend things.\n\n1195\n01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,520\nTwist things.\n\n1196\n01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:27,960\nYou've heard everybody.\n\n1197\n01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,110\nThat's politicians, movie stars, and\n\n1198\n01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:38,000\neveryone else that had the fortune or\nmisfortune on a news program or\n\n1199\n01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,820\nbeing in a paper or\nsomething saying they misquoted me.\n\n1200\n01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,650\nOr that's not what I said, or\nthat was taken out of context.\n\n1201\n01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:45,820\nThey do that quite frequently.\n\n1202\n01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:51,200\nThey will try to push you into a corner,\nand they will use snippets of what you say\n\n1203\n01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,360\nin a way that they want to prove something\nand not the way that it was actually said.\n\n1204\n01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,630\nSo you should be prepared for that.\n\n1205\n01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:00,833\nSo just avoid talking to the media.\n\n1206\n01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:05,532\nYou should just have\na standard phrase you use and\n\n1207\n01:04:05,532 --> 01:04:09,320\nusually it's not what you think it is.\n\n1208\n01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:13,580\nIt's something along the lines or\nthe standard.\n\n1209\n01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,715\nThings people used to say was no comment.\n\n1210\n01:04:16,715 --> 01:04:19,968\nNo comment is nowadays probably one\nof the worst things you could say,\n\n1211\n01:04:19,968 --> 01:04:22,779\ncuz no comment implies that,\nyeah, you're not talking but\n\n1212\n01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:26,085\nyou know something cuz that's\nwhy you're not comment on it.\n\n1213\n01:04:26,085 --> 01:04:27,690\nThey will read it that way.\n\n1214\n01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:33,370\nSo, you can find something else to say if\nquestioned instead of just walking by and\n\n1215\n01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,210\nnot saying anything.\n\n1216\n01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,610\nCuz that's a bad move too.\n\n1217\n01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:40,060\nI mean, just look at those of you who\nhave familiar with what the Chandra Levy,\n\n1218\n01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,580\nGary Condit case.\n\n1219\n01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:45,460\nLook at the senator, even though he\nwas found innocent later on, and\n\n1220\n01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:48,990\nthat someone else had done the crime,\nhe didn't say anything at all.\n\n1221\n01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:53,100\nHe came through with it cuz he always had\nthis big grin on his face when reporters\n\n1222\n01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,400\nwere asking questions.\n\n1223\n01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,875\nAnd not saying anything, just trying\nto keep on this thing like, hey,\n\n1224\n01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:57,794\nI'm not doing anything.\n\n1225\n01:04:57,794 --> 01:05:01,540\nHe looked like an idiot,\nhad this big Cheshire cat grin on him.\n\n1226\n01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:03,420\nNot saying anything made him look guilty.\n\n1227\n01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,270\n>> Yeah.\n>> Made him look that something was wrong,\n\n1228\n01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:06,150\nhe's hiding something.\n\n1229\n01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:08,242\nYou don't want that.\nSo, don't say no comment,\n\n1230\n01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:10,350\ndon't walk by and not say anything.\n\n1231\n01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:14,540\nJust say,\nI'm not authorized to talk about that,\n\n1232\n01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:17,280\nor you're gonna have to direct that\nto these individuals or something.\n\n1233\n01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,270\nThe attorney handling it,\nlet them do it, that's not your job.\n\n1234\n01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:25,625\nIf an attorney hired you to do it, hey,\nwell, I recommend you speak to him,\n\n1235\n01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:29,077\nit is not my job to speak on that area or\nwhatever.\n\n1236\n01:05:29,077 --> 01:05:31,930\n>> Exactly.\n\n1237\n01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,988\nSo, something that sounded really simple,\nbecome an expert witness,\n\n1238\n01:05:34,988 --> 01:05:39,450\nwe see there's a lot to it in preparation,\nin becoming an expert witness.\n\n1239\n01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:45,400\nLearning how to present ourself in court,\nlearning how to present\n\n1240\n01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,270\nthe information in a way that's going to\nbe perceived well in that court of law.\n\n1241\n01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:53,660\nSo, there's a lot more to it\nthan just being smart and\n\n1242\n01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:57,265\nunderstanding what it is that\nyou're trying to present.\n\n1243\n01:05:57,265 --> 01:06:01,865\n>> Yeah, you're gonna have to cook a while\nbefore you become an expert witness.\n\n1244\n01:06:01,865 --> 01:06:04,705\nIt's not something you\nget to be overnight but\n\n1245\n01:06:04,705 --> 01:06:09,782\nwhat you can look at is these things we\ngave you here, are things that you can\n\n1246\n01:06:09,782 --> 01:06:14,972\nuse as a blueprint towards getting to that\npoint where you can be an expert witness.\n\n1247\n01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:17,612\nThat's what I'd consider, so\nif you're not there, don't worry,\n\n1248\n01:06:17,612 --> 01:06:19,382\neveryone had to start some place.\n\n1249\n01:06:19,382 --> 01:06:20,772\nThis is your blueprint.\n\n1250\n01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:26,772\nThis is your briefing on what to expect,\nwhat to develop in yourself and areas to\n\n1251\n01:06:26,772 --> 01:06:32,680\nconcentrate on to get to that point where\nyou are a good, reliable expert witness,\n\n1252\n01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:38,000\nor someone that will be called to offer\nyour opinion and your analysis of things.\n\n1253\n01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,560\nThat's what you want, this is the things\nyou gotta do and things you gotta expect.\n\n1254\n01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,988\n>> Very good.\n\n1255\n01:06:42,988 --> 01:06:46,080\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n1256\n01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,150\nHope you enjoyed it,\nwe

evening.\n\n4\n00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:37,250\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,130\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,420\nAnd with me today is Mr.\nSean Oriyano, how are you doing Sean?\n\n7\n00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,550\n>> I'm pretty good, how are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,590\n>> I'm fantastic, glad to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,850\nWe are shooting our digital\nforensic investigator episodes.\n\n10\n00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,760\nWe wanted to take a minute, step back, and\n\n11\n00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,800\nkind of go outside of our course for\na minute.\n\n12\n00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,040\nWe've been talking a lot about collecting\nevidence and obtaining warrants and\n\n13\n00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,450\nthings like that.\n\n14\n00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,630\nAnd times are changing, right Sean?\n\n15\n00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,786\nThey used to be that everything was in\nmy local area network, or maybe across\n\n16\n00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:11,958\nthe WAN, to a branch office or other\nprivate networks and things like that.\n\n17\n00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,193\nNowadays though,\n\n18\n00:01:13,193 --> 00:01:18,380\nwe've got this new area that we have\ngot to be able to work with, right?\n\n19\n00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,340\n>> Yes.\n\n20\n00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,680\nThere's interesting technologies that come\nout all of the time and so we have to talk\n\n21\n00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,200\nabout one of those things that is gonna\nimpact your life and that's the cloud.\n\n22\n00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,890\nIt's what a lot of you\nare already dealing with, or\n\n23\n00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,680\nwill deal with in the near future.\n\n24\n00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,400\n>> It really changes thing dramatically\nwhen it comes to doing forensic\n\n25\n00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,650\ninvestigations, doesn't it?\n\n26\n00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,140\n>> Oh yeah,\nit has a tremendous impact on how\n\n27\n00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,950\ninvestigations are gonna take place and\nwhat the extents and responsibilities are.\n\n28\n00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,100\nJust a ton.\n\n29\n00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,090\nAnd they're still feeling this out,\nit's still developing.\n\n30\n00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,860\n>> That's the thing is we're just\nnow trying to figure out how we\n\n31\n00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,050\ngo about this and\nhow we deal with it, right?\n\n32\n00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,680\nAnd to give you guys some background,\n\n33\n00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,040\nyou guys should be familiar with\nthis at this point in your career.\n\n34\n00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,780\nAnyway, when we talk about the cloud\nwe could be talking about public hosted\n\n35\n00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,090\nclouds like Amazon Web Services,\nor Microsoft's Azure,\n\n36\n00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,870\nor something like that, where we're\nleasing space from some organization.\n\n37\n00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,690\nThey're maintaining the servers,\nor providing the platform,\n\n38\n00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,320\nor maybe just the application.\n\n39\n00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,352\nBut the point is, is those servers\nare outside of my organization being\n\n40\n00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:30,091\nmaintained by somebody else and\naccessible from the internet?\n\n41\n00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:32,287\nCould be private cloud scenarios,\n\n42\n00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:36,021\nwhere we're making that\ninformation available from inside\n\n43\n00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:41,270\nan organization out to the internet,\nor to extranets, and things like that.\n\n44\n00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,270\nAnd so Sean, when we talk about there's\nthis public cloud primarily and/or\n\n45\n00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,370\nthe private cloud,\nwhat is it that's different?\n\n46\n00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,020\nWhy does this change things so much?\n\n47\n00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,460\n>> Well, the thing that actually changes\nthe cloud is if you think about the nature\n\n48\n00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,130\nof the way the cloud works is that yes,\nyou can have stuff stored out there, you\n\n49\n00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,490\ncan have infrastructure out there, you can\nhave other services hosted in the cloud.\n\n50\n00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,330\nSo already you have taken\nstuff outside of your\n\n51\n00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,290\nresponsibility as a company if we look at\nit from that angle, to some place else.\n\n52\n00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,630\nIf you're doing a forensic investigation,\nnow what happens is if you're targeting\n\n53\n00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:23,380\na company for some sort of behavior and\nyou want to extract data, if you find that\n\n54\n00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,280\nthe data has been stored someplace else\nthe search warrant isn't gonna cover that.\n\n55\n00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,430\nThat's someplace else.\n\n56\n00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,157\nTypically it's not gonna cover that.\n\n57\n00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:35,016\nAt least right now, that's not included\nin search warrants which means you have\n\n58\n00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:40,180\nto get another search warrant to get\npermission to do any investigation there.\n\n59\n00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,110\n>> Yeah.\nThe warrant I obtained to search this\n\n60\n00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,380\ntarget's house is not gonna cover\nMicrosoft servers out there in Azure.\n\n61\n00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,880\nIf I'm in a corporation,\nmy company might be able to give me\n\n62\n00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,030\naccess to their machine, to our file\nservers on our corporate network.\n\n63\n00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,920\nBut probably doesn't have the authority\nto give me permissions to go in and\n\n64\n00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,055\nstart searching for evidence on web\nservices or something like that.\n\n65\n00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:09,935\nSo, that poses a big problem,\nnow we've gotta go back and\n\n66\n00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:14,205\nmake sure we get the right warrants, we\nhave to get separate for this kinda stuff.\n\n67\n00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:17,195\nAnd another thing that\nthe cloud throws in there is,\n\n68\n00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:20,885\nif it's public cloud, you're not\nthe only one on those servers, right?\n\n69\n00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,365\nThese are multi tenant\ncloud service providers.\n\n70\n00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:27,390\nSo I'm gonna have to worry\nabout that as well, right?\n\n71\n00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,878\n>> Yeah.\nThat's actually an immense concern about\n\n72\n00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:36,402\nhow we work with the cloud is, first of\nall, if you're going to go out there and\n\n73\n00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:41,343\ngrab data or try to grab evidence,\nyou're gonna have an issue there if\n\n74\n00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:45,110\nyou try to grab a whole computer or\nserver out of that,\n\n75\n00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,210\nbecause it really doesn't exist that way,\nthat's not the way the cloud works.\n\n76\n00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,010\nAnd if you were able to say, okay,\nI'm gonna grab enough of this or\n\n77\n00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:00,210\nseize this facility or\nwhatever to do this investigation,\n\n78\n00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,560\nthey're gonna impact other people that\nare not part of this investigation.\n\n79\n00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,330\nIf you try to do something on that scale,\n\n80\n00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,750\nso that's pretty much\nout of the picture too.\n\n81\n00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,980\nAnd then we get other\nthings that come into play.\n\n82\n00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,610\nIf you do forensics,\njust how do forensics work\n\n83\n00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,150\nin the cloud if we're gonna\ndo things like file recovery?\n\n84\n00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,770\nThat would be an interesting\nthing to happen,\n\n85\n00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,150\nwhen you look at how the cloud works,\nwhen it resizes stuff and\n\n86\n00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,200\nallocates it for stuff as needed,\nthat's gonna have an impact on\n\n87\n00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,760\nhow you recover deleted data\nif you're looking for that.\n\n88\n00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,550\nSo, a lot of stuff.\n\n89\n00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,830\n>> Absolutely, and\nwe got a great comment in the chatroom,\n\n90\n00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,110\nwhich is kinda leading\nright where I was headed.\n\n91\n00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,760\nDeborah asks, since a server can be\nregistered anywhere in the world,\n\n92\n00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,510\ncan be located physically somewhere else,\ntrying to determine the jurisdiction and\n\n93\n00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,180\nif evidence can be obtained from\nan ISP will be more difficult.\n\n94\n00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,560\nAnd absolutely.\n\n95\n00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,930\nBecause these cloud providers could have\nserver farms located around the world.\n\n96\n00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,030\nWe've gotta deal with international laws\nand just trying to determine who it is I\n\n97\n00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,920\nneed to talk to about possibly compelling\nthem to give me that evidence.\n\n98\n00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,150\nIt becomes an issue.\n\n99\n00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,190\n>> Yeah, that's a massive snag waiting\nto happen if you run into that where\n\n100\n00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,160\nyou're somewhere here in the US,\nlet's say, and\n\n101\n00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,890\nthe cloud provider you have is hosting\ntheir stuff in India let's say,\n\n102\n00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,010\nthat's gonna be a mess, right there.\n\n103\n00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,960\nNow there's ways that those\nsituations may be setup that\n\n104\n00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,980\nlend themselves better to you being\nable to get a search warrant, or\n\n105\n00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,840\nbeing able to do any sort\nof investigation on it.\n\n106\n00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,640\nBut it's gonna be very, very, very tough.\n\n107\n00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,920\nAnd in fact, interestingly enough,\nsome of the contracts that you see that\n\n108\n00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,860\nare signed with cloud providers or\nclients request to be signed with cloud\n\n109\n00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,000\nproviders, specifically\nmention a way to do forensics.\n\n110\n00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,780\nAnd it's really something\nthere that has no teeth.\n\n111\n00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,080\nThere's really no way to effectively do\nit with the situation they've been given.\n\n112\n00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,120\nIt's different if you have a private\ncloud, because you host everything and\n\n113\n00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,380\nyou've got a little more control over it.\n\n114\n00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,500\nBut, yeah, once you start going\ninternational and stuff like that,\n\n115\n00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,230\nthat changes things dramatically.\n\n116\n00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,190\nYou can't ask for the same searches, you\ncan't do the same investigations on it.\n\n117\n00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,150\nThat definitely changes things a lot.\n\n118\n00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,894\nThat's why some governments\nwill say the cloud,\n\n119\n00:07:30,894 --> 00:07:36,879\nif you're gonna use cloud technology,\nthey have to be hosted in a certain way.\n\n120\n00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,559\nHere in the US,\nit's federal government stuff, for\n\n121\n00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:45,420\nexample, has to be stored within the US.\n\n122\n00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,280\nIt cannot go overseas anyplace.\n\n123\n00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,970\n>> So we're gonna make sure we talk and we\ncould be verifying with that cloud service\n\n124\n00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,730\nprovider that they are hosting\nthat data locally in our country.\n\n125\n00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,870\nWe've got a few issues, right?\n\n126\n00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,810\nWe've already brought up\nwith this cloud services.\n\n127\n00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,690\nSeizing those files could\ninclude information from people\n\n128\n00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,550\noutside of the scope of my investigation.\n\n129\n00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,620\nAnd now, I've got privacy concerns.\n\n130\n00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,980\nIssues to deal with there.\n\n131\n00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,740\nWe're compelling those passwords'\n\n132\n00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,270\nproviders to provide this information for\nus.\n\n133\n00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,470\nHow trusty is that cloud provider, right?\n\n134\n00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,020\nAre they giving us all the information?\n\n135\n00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,130\nAre they giving us accurate information?\n\n136\n00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,240\nWho did they use to\ncollect that information?\n\n137\n00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,670\nAre they certified?\n\n138\n00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,930\nAre they trained technicians?\n\n139\n00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,450\nIs this data gonna hold up in a court\nof law even if I do get it from them?\n\n140\n00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,470\n>> Yeah, there's so many concerns when\nyou're hosting it someplace away from\n\n141\n00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,110\nyour own infrastructure.\n\n142\n00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,730\nSo if someone else has it under\ntheir control, so if you look at\n\n143\n00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,050\nthat just right there, you're\nputting your stuff in someone else's\n\n144\n00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,390\ncontrol in their server center,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n145\n00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,720\nThey have it sitting there, and\n\n146\n00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,340\nthey're controlling it and keeping\nit healthy for you on their servers.\n\n147\n00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:13,650\nCan they say if the law enforcement comes\nin and says, we need to look at this?\n\n148\n00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,210\nIs there a situation there\nwhere they can do that,\n\n149\n00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:22,000\nkind of that third party authorization\nthat we talked about where if I take\n\n150\n00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,800\nmy notebook to a computer repair store and\nthey find something.\n\n151\n00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,850\nThey can call the police themselves and\nauthorize certain things to happen.\n\n152\n00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,441\nCan that cloud provider do that?\n\n153\n00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,655\nThat's been a question.\n\n154\n00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:40,650\nThe answer to it seems to be no.\n\n155\n00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,599\nBut, there is a reason why\nI said seems to be no.\n\n156\n00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,660\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n157\n00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,895\n>> Your mileage may vary.\n\n158\n00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:48,030\n[LAUGH]\n>> As we've said,\n\n159\n00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,200\nthis is all within the last few years.\n\n160\n00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,060\nReally becoming a problem\nthat we had to deal with.\n\n161\n00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,140\nThere scenarios that\nwe've had to deal with.\n\n162\n00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,860\nSo the laws are still catching up,\nthe procedures are still catching up,\n\n163\n00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,540\nthe techniques that we use\nare still being developed.\n\n164\n00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,550\nSo it's great being on that cutting edge,\nbut\n\n165\n00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,575\nat the same time sometimes it's not so\nfun being on that cutting edge.\n\n166\n00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,836\nSo, I gotta figure out how\nwe can deal with that.\n\n167\n00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:13,381\n>> Cutting edge can be\nthe bleeding edge really quickly.\n\n168\n00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:17,670\n>> Exactly.\nSo just something that we think you guys\n\n169\n00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:26,007\nshould consider or have to think about\nas a digital forensic investigator.\n\n170\n00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,577\nHow does the cloud change things?\n\n171\n00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:33,303\nHow does me investigating a scenario or\nsituation if that points to the cloud?\n\n172\n00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:37,033\nDoes that change my procedures and\nthe way I handle things.\n\n173\n00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,253\nAnd it absolutely does.\n\n174\n00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:40,853\nIt's something that we\nhave to deal with so.\n\n175\n00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:44,453\nAnd we got a few great links we're gonna\npost in the show notes to let you do some\n\n176\n00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:49,033\nadditional reading on\nthese topics as well.\n\n177\n00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:53,093\n>> Ben brings up a good thing here,\nit says your service level agreement,\n\n178\n00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:56,890\nyour SLA should state where\nyour cloud information is held.\n\n179\n00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:02,270\nAnd you say for programmers and\ndevelopers, well,\n\n180\n00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:08,220\nforget the programmer and developer\nsituation, just apply it to everybody.\n\n181\n00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,980\nYeah, you're gonna have an SLA that\ncomes with your cloud service.\n\n182\n00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,890\nOne of the problems that has been\nencountered a lot with hosting in\n\n183\n00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:26,760\nthe cloud, and going to a cloud provider\nis that you purchase the service,\n\n184\n00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,630\nthey give you an SLA, but\nyou don't investigate it too closely,\n\n185\n00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,870\nwhich is really your fault\nif you're not doing that.\n\n186\n00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,840\nBut is that they also don't\ninform you of certain things.\n\n187\n00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,060\nSome hosting providers, they only\nprovide just the hosting service.\n\n188\n00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,670\nJust the basically from\nthe hypervisor down.\n\n189\n00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,650\nEverything else up above that's on you.\n\n190\n00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,720\nThat means if things need to be backed up,\n\n191\n00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,480\nthat's on you unless you\nask them to do it for you.\n\n192\n00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,885\nAnd so, you have to pay extra for that.\n\n193\n00:11:56,885 --> 00:12:01,260\nSo, and\nnot all of them will tell you that either.\n\n194\n00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,950\nBecause a lot of people that sell\ncloud services, they're not IT people,\n\n195\n00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,510\nthey are salespeople.\n\n196\n00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,200\nThey hear all this nice terms\nabout what the cloud is, and\n\n197\n00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,790\nhow great it is, and\nall this awesome stuff.\n\n198\n00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,150\nThey're not thinking of the technical\nissues that sit behind that.\n\n199\n00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,438\nSo you really have to kind\nof ask those questions.\n\n200\n00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:28,575\nIf you start stirring in stuff like,\nwhat if you're a healthcare company?\n\n201\n00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:33,640\nI always use those as an example\nbecause they got stringent rules.\n\n202\n00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,230\nThat changes your SLA, and\nyour evidence collection all dramatically.\n\n203\n00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,870\nSo there's a lot of stuff that very\nwell could be happening there.\n\n204\n00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,460\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n205\n00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,910\nSome other things that we have\nto deal with cloud providers and\n\n206\n00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,360\nour forensic investigations\nis a long synchronization.\n\n207\n00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,390\nOr time synchronization is\nreally what it comes back to.\n\n208\n00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,167\nIf you've sat through our server\nepisodes or anything like that,\n\n209\n00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,520\nyou're familiar with time synchronization.\n\n210\n00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,740\nAnd in house all my computers\nare synchronized with\n\n211\n00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,790\na particular machine on my network,\nmy PDC emulator,\n\n212\n00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,020\nand that keeps the sync times\nsynchronized across all the machines.\n\n213\n00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,590\nSo in the event of an investigation,\nI can start correlating log files.\n\n214\n00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,090\nI'm trying to correlate log files off\nmy routing devices and my file servers,\n\n215\n00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,810\nor the machine that\nthe attacker was using.\n\n216\n00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,741\nWhoever it is I'm investigating was using,\nI can correlate these log files.\n\n217\n00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,139\nI can see when things were happening at\nthe same time on two different nodes,\n\n218\n00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:30,708\nor what have you.\n\n219\n00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:36,700\nWith the cloud services,\nthose hosts are not a part of my network.\n\n220\n00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,780\nThey're not synchronizing\ntheir time with me, or\n\n221\n00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,020\nI'm not synchronizing my time with them.\n\n222\n00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,310\nSo, those machines that I'm\nrunning up there on their network\n\n223\n00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,520\nare not synchronizing their time and so\nthat's gonna make synchronizing those\n\n224\n00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,230\nlog file trying to do that log\nanalysis much more difficult as well.\n\n225\n00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,380\n>> Yeah.\n\n226\n00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,220\nThere's so many cans of worms\nthat can potentially open.\n\n227\n00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,510\nI even see James in here saying, is it\npossible I can start at local level and\n\n228\n00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,140\nprogress all the way on up?\n\n229\n00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,420\nYou bet.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n230\n00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,580\n>> Absolutely.\n\n231\n00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,460\nThat's the way I would put it.\n\n232\n00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,386\nI would just say yes,\nit could progress anywhere.\n\n233\n00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:18,490\nYou could have a very small investigation\nthat just gets bigger and bigger and\n\n234\n00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,760\nbigger, and that doesn't just\npertain to the cloud either.\n\n235\n00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,740\nIt can happen anywhere.\n\n236\n00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:28,270\nThose of you that haven't taken the time\nto, or haven't previously read the book\n\n237\n00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:34,110\nI was referencing on Monday, The Cuckoo's\nEgg, that would be a prime example.\n\n238\n00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:39,570\nIt was a small,\nit was literally someone's curiosity and\n\n239\n00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:45,970\ndiligence about seeing a small, I think\nit was like a few cents error on a bill,\n\n240\n00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,750\nand it progressed out to\nsomething of international crime,\n\n241\n00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,950\nand all this stuff happening.\n\n242\n00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,000\nIt was just a big thing, so yeah.\n\n243\n00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,640\nThat progressed from literally\nnothing to a huge deal.\n\n244\n00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,260\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n245\n00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,940\nAnd then another thing we gotta\nthink about is chain of custody.\n\n246\n00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,440\nWe talk about chain of custody for\nour evidence.\n\n247\n00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,820\nHow do I maintain that when that\nevidence is being collected by\n\n248\n00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,260\nsomebody outside by some\ncloud service provider.\n\n249\n00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,160\nThere can be disagreements on how\nthat chain of custody is kept.\n\n250\n00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,520\nCould be gaps in our chain of custody,\nwhich Sean told us about yesterday.\n\n251\n00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,010\nThat's a huge hole for\nthat defense attorney to drive through.\n\n252\n00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,600\nSo that's another thing\nwe've gotta consider.\n\n253\n00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,230\nLots and\nlots of issues that we have to deal with\n\n254\n00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,620\nwhen our investigation moves\nout there towards the cloud.\n\n255\n00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,480\n>> Yeah.\n\n256\n00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,330\nThere's a lot of potential headaches and\npitfalls, and\n\n257\n00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,090\nstuff like that awaiting you\nwhen you go to the cloud.\n\n258\n00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,740\nThis is just one of them.\n\n259\n00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,302\nI know a lot of people who've\nbrought up moving out to the cloud.\n\n260\n00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:54,000\nThey see, I don't have control of it\nanymore, someone else has control.\n\n261\n00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,020\nI'm concerned about if I lose my\ncommunications to the internet and my\n\n262\n00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,960\ncloud's hosting some place else and all of\nthe sudden I've lost access to my things.\n\n263\n00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,322\nAnd then you get people that are hosting\nat the directory in exchange and\n\n264\n00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:14,150\nSharePoint and\nall other manner of services out there.\n\n265\n00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:20,390\nYou lose connectivity, you lose\nthose services for a period of time.\n\n266\n00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,490\nSo there's already a lot of\nnervousness revolving around that,\n\n267\n00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,380\nand then when you start building\nin these additional things,\n\n268\n00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,360\nthat's an even bigger concern.\n\n269\n00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,943\nI mean I always think of healthcare.\n\n270\n00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:45,390\nI talked to a couple people,\nit was a healthcare company in California,\n\n271\n00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,348\nand California has some of the strongest\nhealthcare things up and above HIPAA.\n\n272\n00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:54,360\nThey have just a whole bunch of\nenforcement and other things going on.\n\n273\n00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,720\nThey had special forensic\nrequirements too in case there\n\n274\n00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,440\nwas a data breach that things\nhad to be investigated.\n\n275\n00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,100\nThe people I knew that set this up said\nthose were pretty much impossible to\n\n276\n00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,900\never carry out because due to the way\nthe cloud works you couldn't do it.\n\n277\n00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,750\nWhat had happened is someone had taken\nthe traditional model of forensics\n\n278\n00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,010\nwhere the stuff was being stored on\na server someplace in an application,\n\n279\n00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,165\nand they had just moved it over to\nthe cloud and said well there you go.\n\n280\n00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,200\nTa-da!\n\n281\n00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,920\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n282\n00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,350\nIt's just a different environment.\n\n283\n00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,730\nSo, yeah, you are gonna have to face that.\n\n284\n00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,040\nEspecially if there's\na requirement in your organization\n\n285\n00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,390\nto provide the ability to\ndo forensics if need be.\n\n286\n00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,130\n>> Absolutely.\n\n287\n00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,847\nSo, I hope we open your guys' eyes up to\na whole new world of digital forensic\n\n288\n00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:44,970\ninvestigation.\n\n289\n00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,463\nThe cloud changes a lot of things, and\nit's something that we're going to have to\n\n290\n00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:53,260\nincorporate into our skill set and\nthe tools we use and\n\n291\n00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,790\nour mindset when we go and\ndo this digital forensic investigation.\n\n292\n00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,260\n>> Familiarize yourself with the cloud as\nmuch as you can at the technical level and\n\n293\n00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,320\nthe security levels,\nthe type of security area.\n\n294\n00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,450\nWe're not seeing a ton\nof discussion on that,\n\n295\n00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,380\nthey're starting to see a discussion on\nhow you fully secure stuff in the cloud\n\n296\n00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,700\nand how you provide certain things\nbecause we're looking at the fact that\n\n297\n00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,150\npeople are migrating so\nmuch stuff over there.\n\n298\n00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,160\nThat has to be addressed or\nwe've got a major problem on our hands.\n\n299\n00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:35,030\nSo if you're not really fluent in\nthe cloud, yet as both an IT person and\n\n300\n00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,070\nas someone that's gonna be doing\nforensics, that's what your goal is by\n\n301\n00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,950\ndoing this, then you're gonna need to get\nfamiliar with the cloud very quickly.\n\n302\n00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,860\n>> It's time.\n\n303\n00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,260\nIt's time.\n\n304\n00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,020\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, I hope you enjoyed that.\n\n305\n00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,180\nJust wanted to give you\na little bit of a food for\n\n306\n00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,660\nthought dealing with forensics and\nthe cloud.\n\n307\n00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,350\nSo, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n308\n00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,090\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n309\n00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,809\n>>

to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:41,296\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:42,411\nHow are you doing today, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:43,700\n>> Doing pretty good, yourself?\n\n7\n00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,170\n>> I'm doing fantastic, looking forward\nto another exciting episode in our\n\n8\n00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,980\ndigital forensic investigator series.\n\n9\n00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,060\nIn this particular episode,\n\n10\n00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,860\nwe're gonna step away from\nour objectives for a second.\n\n11\n00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,700\nAnd we wanna give you some real world\nexamples of some computer forensics and\n\n12\n00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,640\nwhen that computer forensics goes wrong.\n\n13\n00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,930\nWe've spent a lot of time in some previous\nepisodes, talking about securing a crime\n\n14\n00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,630\nscene, gathering evidence,\nproper ways to do that.\n\n15\n00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,480\nAnd we wanna give you some examples of\nwhen people don't follow those procedures,\n\n16\n00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,450\nand what can happen and\nhow that can affect the case and\n\n17\n00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,580\npossibly even prevent that\ncase from being tried at all.\n\n18\n00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,810\nSo we've got a few things we were\ngonna just share with you guys here.\n\n19\n00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,970\nAnd what's our first one, Sean?\n\n20\n00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,960\n>> Yeah.\nThere's just to say what we're going to do\n\n21\n00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,700\nhere is we're trying to talk about\nthe things that can screw up your case.\n\n22\n00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,670\nThese things all relate to stuff\nwe've already talked about.\n\n23\n00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,480\nSo we just kinda want to\nreiterate these things.\n\n24\n00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,620\nSo just to kinda go through\nsome of these things.\n\n25\n00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:51,090\nOne of the more common mistakes is not\npreserving the crime scene properly.\n\n26\n00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,970\nAnd this is something that if you go back\nto the process that we went through,\n\n27\n00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:01,500\nthe forensic investigation process,\nand when we simulated our crime scene.\n\n28\n00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,000\nWe spent time determining\nwhat our goals were.\n\n29\n00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,260\nNot only did that time that we\ntake to determine our goals.\n\n30\n00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:14,090\nNot only gives us a good\nidea of what we need\n\n31\n00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,150\nto be gathering at the end of the day but\nit also gives\n\n32\n00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,720\nus a time to kinda really think things\nthrough about how we're gonna approach it.\n\n33\n00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,020\nSo we make sure that we are preserving\nstuff, and collecting the right things.\n\n34\n00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,570\nSo never miss that chance,\ndon't just dive right in,\n\n35\n00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,486\nbecause you really only get one\nchance to preserve that stuff.\n\n36\n00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:38,070\nIf you don't preserve it\nthe right way the first time,\n\n37\n00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,340\nthen it's pretty much your not\ngonna ever get that chance again.\n\n38\n00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,000\n>> Absolutely.\n\n39\n00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,690\nAbsolutely.\n\n40\n00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,830\nAnd so\nwe can learn from these mistakes right?\n\n41\n00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,870\nWe can do our research.\n\n42\n00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,310\nWe can do our due diligence.\n\n43\n00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,530\nAnd we can see some of the common\nmistakes that are made when we do these\n\n44\n00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,490\nforensic investigations.\n\n45\n00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,260\nAnd by having that knowledge\nthat's just gonna make\n\n46\n00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,760\nme a better forensic investigator.\n\n47\n00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,220\nBecause now hopefully, I can learn\nfrom other people's mistakes and\n\n48\n00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,810\nI can apply that in my investigations and\navoid those common mistakes, right?\n\n49\n00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,382\nSo, it's all about gaining that knowledge,\nlearning this, and especially if we're\n\n50\n00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:13,538\nnew, we don't want to be one of those\npeople that makes those common mistakes.\n\n51\n00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:18,126\nWhen they say common mistakes, obviously\nthey've been made more than once, and\n\n52\n00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:19,440\nthey're easy to fix.\n\n53\n00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,160\nAs long as we understand,\nor know what's going on.\n\n54\n00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,006\nSo what are some of the common mistakes\nwe see out forensic investigations?\n\n55\n00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:31,270\n>> So you have that,\nyou didn't preserve the crime scene.\n\n56\n00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,820\nAnother one is not documenting the crime\nscene when you've got the chance,\n\n57\n00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,750\nfor the same reason.\n\n58\n00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,870\nYou want to preserve it when you\nget out there because you only\n\n59\n00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,980\nget one chance to preserve it.\n\n60\n00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,990\nIt's the same thing,\n\n61\n00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,950\nis you only get one chance to document\nthat scene as it is when you get there.\n\n62\n00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,070\nSo, you really wanna do things thoroughly.\n\n63\n00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,910\nNotice when we were talking about this,\n\n64\n00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,210\nboth of us emphasized,\ntake tons of pictures.\n\n65\n00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,390\nYou're gonna be using\ndigital cameras nowadays.\n\n66\n00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,320\n>> We don't have to pay for film.\n\n67\n00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,590\nWe don't have to pay for developing.\n\n68\n00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,160\nNone of that.\n\n69\n00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,270\nTake thousand of pictures if you have to.\n\n70\n00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,370\n>> Take whatever you want.\n\n71\n00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,510\nYou've got time to even screw up a few in\nthere and get pictures of your hand and\n\n72\n00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,260\neverything in there.\n\n73\n00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,980\nBut you can take tons and tons and\ntons of pictures, and that's what we want.\n\n74\n00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,930\nLike I said, better to over-document and\n\n75\n00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,180\nget everything than get back to\nthe lab and going oops, missed it.\n\n76\n00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,118\nMurphy's Law is probably gonna say\nthat's the one that you needed.\n\n77\n00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:33,540\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n78\n00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,900\n>> It's one of the reasons also why you\nback it up with the video in there too,\n\n79\n00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,900\nbecause it is easy to make\na mistake with still photos.\n\n80\n00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,220\nOnce you get more skilled it\ntends to be a little easier to\n\n81\n00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,460\nkinda go through a procedure\n>> But you could easily take a picture of\n\n82\n00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,565\nsomething and say okay, I'm good, and\nthen, what about that other side?\n\n83\n00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,260\n[LAUGH] Ask what's on\nthe other side of that.\n\n84\n00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,200\nOur crime scene here was a good example,\n\n85\n00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,650\nwhere from my vantage point here\nyou had put a keyboard over here.\n\n86\n00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,490\nIf I had taken a picture from this side,\nI would never have seen that keyboard.\n\n87\n00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,070\n>> Absolutely, and from my side,\nI couldn't see that little USB,\n\n88\n00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,530\nwhat we thought might have\nbeen a USB key cap, right?\n\n89\n00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,390\nAnd if I hadn't done\na thorough investigation,\n\n90\n00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,080\nI could have easily missed that.\n\n91\n00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,160\nSo we've gotta make sure that\nwe're capturing all of that.\n\n92\n00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,410\nAnd really there's no reason not to\ntake hundreds and hundreds of picture.\n\n93\n00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,630\nAnd the other thing is\nget those done early.\n\n94\n00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,680\nBecause our crime scene, you know we've\ngot all kinds of people coming in.\n\n95\n00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,450\nYou might have police officers, you might\nhave detectives, you got, hopefully,\n\n96\n00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,910\nyou could potentially have coroners or\nEMTs that traipsing through this scene.\n\n97\n00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,820\nSo we wanna get there,\n\n98\n00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,910\nthe first thing we need to do is\ncapture as many pictures as we can.\n\n99\n00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,100\nBefore everything starts getting moved,\nshuffled or at least minimize that.\n\n100\n00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,420\nWe might be,\nwe're not the first ones there.\n\n101\n00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,790\nWe get called in when they realize, oh my\ngosh, here's a computer sitting here and\n\n102\n00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,610\nit could potentially be part of the crime.\n\n103\n00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,620\nSo they call us in.\n\n104\n00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,060\nBy that point, people have been\nshuffling around doing that.\n\n105\n00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,450\nSo you want to capture\nthat as soon as possible.\n\n106\n00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,650\nAnd as many as you can.\n\n107\n00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,600\n>> Absolutely, that's the key.\n\n108\n00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,650\n>> Another common mistake.\n\n109\n00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,150\nWe talk about a lack of communication.\n\n110\n00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,720\n>> Yes.\n\n111\n00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,750\nOne of the things that you want\nto establish when you get in as\n\n112\n00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,810\na forensic investigator is you really\nwant to get in there and figure out,\n\n113\n00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,430\nyou know,\nwho you want to communicate with.\n\n114\n00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,200\nAnd you want to know that ahead of time.\n\n115\n00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,190\nIt was already, you know,\nkinda peaked out a few times in here, but\n\n116\n00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,230\nI can't emphasize it enough.\n\n117\n00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,460\nKnow who you're supposed\nto communicate to.\n\n118\n00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,840\nIntroduce yourself to the different\nresources you might have.\n\n119\n00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,505\nGet to establish a hotline with your\nlocal FBI office if you need to.\n\n120\n00:06:54,505 --> 00:07:00,957\nGet those things in place so\npeople know who each other is.\n\n121\n00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:03,257\nKnow who to be talking to.\n\n122\n00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:07,817\nAnd when things are ready to go,\nwe've got them.\n\n123\n00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:09,117\nWe've got all those things in place.\n\n124\n00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,067\nSo always know who you're\nsupposed to talk to,\n\n125\n00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:13,670\nhave good clear lines of communication.\n\n126\n00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,640\nDon't just start passing stuff around,\nor missing passing stuff around.\n\n127\n00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,700\n>> Yeah, and you're gonna have,\n\n128\n00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,800\nas we've said, at this crime scene\nyou could have lots of different\n\n129\n00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,920\nteams there doing different parts,\ndoing their job, whatever that maybe.\n\n130\n00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,440\nAnd our job is to do the digital\nforensics investigation.\n\n131\n00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,590\nWe need to communicate with them what's\nimportant to us, let them know hey,\n\n132\n00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,310\ncan we leave this area, can you get\nall of this stuff out of here or\n\n133\n00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,120\nnot come through here.\n\n134\n00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,890\nYou know communication between\nthe people that are there at the scene\n\n135\n00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,320\ncan help to make sure that\nthere's no misunderstanding.\n\n136\n00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,690\nAnd you don't want maybe\na police officer or an EMT just\n\n137\n00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,390\nsliding everything off the desk so that\nhe can get to something or do something.\n\n138\n00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,475\nMake sure they know that, hey,\n\n139\n00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,490\nthat's an important part of\nmy part of the investigation.\n\n140\n00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,440\nI need that left as is.\n\n141\n00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,612\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n142\n00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:04,491\nThe stuff has to be handled a certain way.\n\n143\n00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:07,666\nAnd so, make sure they're [LAUGH]\naware of where things are.\n\n144\n00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:12,752\nYou may very well be the one that is\ngonna be in control of that scene and\n\n145\n00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:16,010\ndictating everything for a period of time.\n\n146\n00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,995\nExpect to be in that position.\n\n147\n00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:19,980\n>> Mm-hm absolutely.\n\n148\n00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,800\nAnother one that I see in some of the\nlinks you gave us, and I'll make sure I\n\n149\n00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,860\ngive you guys links, there's some really\ngood articles about some of these here,\n\n150\n00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,170\nthat Sean brought in for us.\n\n151\n00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,915\nUsing your internal IT staff to conduct\na computer forensics investigation.\n\n152\n00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:35,091\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Oh boy.\n\n153\n00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:38,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is\n\n154\n00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,330\none that can also turn out kind of,\nit has a potential to turn out bad.\n\n155\n00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,920\nAnd, I kind of hate to say that because,\nyou look at it, and\n\n156\n00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,080\na lot of Forensic Techs, they get some\nof their initial experience in IT.\n\n157\n00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,259\nOr are called in as experts on\nan investigation, from the IT field.\n\n158\n00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:04,010\nThat's all well and good, but there could\nbe several problems that come with that.\n\n159\n00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,590\nFirst of all,\nthey may not have the adequate training.\n\n160\n00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:12,120\nThey may exceed their authority or\ntheir capabilities.\n\n161\n00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,550\nI mean, that's something that\nhappens in IT all the time.\n\n162\n00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,670\nI think every one of us at some point has,\nwhat, exceeded our capabilities.\n\n163\n00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,340\nThat's how we learn sometimes.\n\n164\n00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,450\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n>> It just happens.\n\n165\n00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,270\nIt's like yeah, we got it, we do a lot\nof research and we figure it out.\n\n166\n00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,060\nAnd that's fine for IT.\n\n167\n00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,390\nIf you don't know how to do something,\nyou research it,\n\n168\n00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:35,100\nand you consult with a few other\npeople if they're there, and you do.\n\n169\n00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,370\nBut you can't do that in forensics.\n\n170\n00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,010\nSo that's one thing that would be\na problem with bringing IT staff in.\n\n171\n00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:45,120\nThe other thing is is that depending\non who you're investigating\n\n172\n00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,860\ninside an organization, bringing IT\nstaff in and investigating the same\n\n173\n00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,160\nassets that they manage,\nthey're not gonna be fully objective.\n\n174\n00:09:56,915 --> 00:10:02,125\nI know people can say I can be\nobjective and all that good stuff.\n\n175\n00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,435\nBut it's still very tough.\n\n176\n00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:09,835\nSo even if you are one of those people\nthat can say I can compartmentalize it.\n\n177\n00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,315\nI don't wanna take chance.\n\n178\n00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:15,575\nNo offense to anybody,\nlet's not take the chance.\n\n179\n00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:20,970\nBecause I do not want to have to at\nsome point if this does go to court or\n\n180\n00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,570\nput before somebody to analyze,\nI don't want them to say well,\n\n181\n00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,210\ndoesn't that person manage those?\n\n182\n00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,680\nAre you sure they weren't being objective?\n\n183\n00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,540\n>> All they gotta do is raise that\nlittle bit of doubt right and\n\n184\n00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,540\nif they say look you're investigating\nyourself or something like that.\n\n185\n00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,340\nThat could be enough to put doubt in\npeople's minds in that court system, and\n\n186\n00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,540\nthat's all they need.\n\n187\n00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,090\nAnd we spent a lot of time talking\nabout how we need to be trained,\n\n188\n00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,890\nwe need to be certified\nby outside organizations.\n\n189\n00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,700\nMy internal IT staff most\nlikely we're talking about\n\n190\n00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,330\npeople who aren't trained in this.\n\n191\n00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,380\nSo they go through and they gather this\nevidence and they do it incorrectly.\n\n192\n00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,510\nOr they do gather it correctly,\n\n193\n00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,270\nbut they can still come into the court\nof law and the defense attorney says,\n\n194\n00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,000\nwell this guys is not even trained\nin this, where is his certification?\n\n195\n00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,590\nWhere is, like you were talking about like\nmaybe requiring a private investigator\n\n196\n00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,310\nlicense or something like that.\n\n197\n00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,350\nIf your internal IT staff doesn't have\nthat, if they gather that evidence, they\n\n198\n00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,330\nmight've gathered it correctly, but they\ncan get it thrown out in the court of law,\n\n199\n00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,890\nbecause it wasn't done by a certified\nprofessional forensics investigator.\n\n200\n00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,140\nSo we want, and companies are gonna\ntry to save money, right?\n\n201\n00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,360\nThey don't want to call\nsomebody in from the outside.\n\n202\n00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,750\nThey're like, well I've got IT staff,\n\n203\n00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,150\nthey understand computers,\nsurely they can do this just as well.\n\n204\n00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,350\nBut no, they might be able to,\nI'm not saying that they can't, but\n\n205\n00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,190\nit's not going to hold up in a court of\nlaw if they're going to prosecute them.\n\n206\n00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:43,520\n>> Yeah, there's so many details there,\nthat it's easy as an IT person,\n\n207\n00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,800\nto make little mistakes that\nyou don't know are mistakes.\n\n208\n00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,320\n>> Like me picking up that\n\n209\n00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,420\nfire wire card the other day when\nwe did our little crime scene.\n\n210\n00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,860\nThe first thing I did is pick it up and\nhold it, right?\n\n211\n00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,150\nDidn't think about the fact that if I was\na trained digital forensics investigator.\n\n212\n00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,460\nI would know better not to touch that.\n\n213\n00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,980\n>> That's a common mistake.\n\n214\n00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,570\nIt's not like you're\nthe first person to do that.\n\n215\n00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:11,670\nThat's the type of issue\nwe're trying to avoid and\n\n216\n00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:17,520\nmake sure those people are trained and\nready to do what they need to.\n\n217\n00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,660\nThis is also kind of, I see in chat room,\nDeborah's bringing up a great one.\n\n218\n00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,270\nThe only way to get experience to enter a\npolice department or something like that.\n\n219\n00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,060\nNot always.\n\n220\n00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,880\nSome people can just start doing forensic\nexamination internally inside a company.\n\n221\n00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,240\nAnd that company may not have\nany intention of ever taking\n\n222\n00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,810\nanything to court.\n\n223\n00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,600\nThat could be one.\n\n224\n00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,600\nThe other one could be that company just\nis doing as part of an incident response\n\n225\n00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,810\nprogram and\n\n226\n00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,410\nthey're just doing it to kinda do a\npost-mortem on why the incident happened.\n\n227\n00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,370\nAnd how they can improve their response.\n\n228\n00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,130\nSo you can start building\nyour experience there.\n\n229\n00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,020\nNow you may have to still work with\nsomebody who's a little more experienced\n\n230\n00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,440\non it to kind of get a little more,\nbut that will get you a long way.\n\n231\n00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,142\nI know quite a few people\nwho have started that way.\n\n232\n00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:15,380\nIn fact I remember talking\nto somebody that was,\n\n233\n00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,160\nhe came out of the military and\nwhen he came out of the military the IT\n\n234\n00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,310\ndepartment he worked for was one of\nthe state agencies in Tennessee.\n\n235\n00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,960\nAnd he pretty much just started like that.\n\n236\n00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,375\nHe just started as an IT person,\nand when stuff started happening,\n\n237\n00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:40,870\nthey said hey, check on this,\ncheck to see who this email came from.\n\n238\n00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,350\nCheck to see why this person\n\n239\n00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,670\nhappens to know why these\ntype of things are happening.\n\n240\n00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:52,140\nSo it started with that person learning\nthe process, and learning how to do\n\n241\n00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:58,180\nresearch, and as they did that,\nthe first one, then the second one,\n\n242\n00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,870\nand they got better and better at it,\nthey got called on more and more and more.\n\n243\n00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,610\nAnd now that person, last time I,\nthe point I had talked to at least\n\n244\n00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,220\nhe was considered to be one\nof the experts in the state.\n\n245\n00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,560\nSo he would get called over the place\nbecause he had done this long enough and\n\n246\n00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,720\nlearned those procedures, and\n\n247\n00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,590\nhe had actually started getting\nliaisons with law enforcement.\n\n248\n00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,260\nAt some point he investigated internal\nstuff, but then he started hitting on hey,\n\n249\n00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,170\nthis is a criminal hit.\n\n250\n00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,710\nThis is a criminal matter.\n\n251\n00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,430\nAnd so then he's gotta communicate\nwith people on the outside, and\n\n252\n00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,970\nso that started raising\nwhat he had to know and\n\n253\n00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,760\nthen that's where it was getting,\nhe had to go to classes and\n\n254\n00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,868\nget certified and get more and more,\nand so yeah, it built the knowledge up.\n\n255\n00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:45,967\n>> Nice.\n\n256\n00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:50,930\n>> It's good to be able\nto intern with somebody\n\n257\n00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,480\nto do something like this, but\nyou don't necessarily have to.\n\n258\n00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,140\nIt would be like saying to get in IT, you\ngotta get a computer science degree and\n\n259\n00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,540\na masters and all that stuff in there.\n\n260\n00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,360\nHow many people do you know in IT\nthat actually have those things?\n\n261\n00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,139\n>> I've trained several people to get\ntheir certificates because they've got\n\n262\n00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,065\nthose already and couldn't get a job.\n\n263\n00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:12,565\n>> So, yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n264\n00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:13,414\n>> Liberal arts majors, huh?\n\n265\n00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n266\n00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,090\n[LAUGH] Another common mistake that we're\n\n267\n00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,460\ngonna see in the digital forensics world\nis too narrowly limiting the scope of\n\n268\n00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,400\ncomputer forensics.\n\n269\n00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,990\nRight?\n\n270\n00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,550\n>> Yes.\n>> Not understanding what\n\n271\n00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,020\nthe scope of my investigation\nreally should be.\n\n272\n00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,420\n>> Yes.\nWhat you're doing there,\n\n273\n00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,740\nyou remember, you're supposed\nto set goals right up front.\n\n274\n00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,420\nYou really need to figure out right up\nfront what you should be collecting,\n\n275\n00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,150\nwhat you're looking for, that goal is,\nand build towards that goal.\n\n276\n00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,660\nThis is also one of those\nthings where collecting more\n\n277\n00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,380\ninformation than you need and knowing\nthe order of all utility helps out.\n\n278\n00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,028\nYou might go for those core things you\nknow are gonna support what your goal is.\n\n279\n00:15:58,028 --> 00:16:02,519\nAnd then you have these additional things\nthat you can get that are secondary goals\n\n280\n00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,701\nand tertiary goals.\n\n281\n00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:06,698\nThat you can go that just\nbolster it a bit more.\n\n282\n00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:13,720\nBut yeah, don't too narrowly focus\non what you're supposed to be doing.\n\n283\n00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,560\nI mean, we go back to one of the first\nthings that was talked about here,\n\n284\n00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,460\npreserving evidence.\n\n285\n00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,560\nYou too narrowly focus and you say okay,\n\n286\n00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,220\nI got it and\npunch out of there with all your stuff.\n\n287\n00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,712\nAnd you realize, I really should have\ncollected that when I was there.\n\n288\n00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:28,290\n>> All right.\n\n289\n00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:28,970\n>> Too late.\n\n290\n00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,270\n>> Or like that USB cap again.\n\n291\n00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,550\nAll of a sudden, I'm focused on this\ncomputer that's sitting in front of me,\n\n292\n00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,290\nand this is my crime scene.\n\n293\n00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,025\nIf I'm a good digital forensics\ninvestigator, I'd see that USB cap, and\n\n294\n00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:43,005\nnow I've got to expand the scope\nof my crime scene, right?\n\n295\n00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:44,870\nBecause the key itself wasn't there.\n\n296\n00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,860\nI might need to go to cars,\nhomes, other places of residence,\n\n297\n00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,640\nthings like that, and make sure I\ndon't focus just on that crime scene.\n\n298\n00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,200\nSo we gotta to be aware of when it could\n\n299\n00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,640\nexpand beyond the current\nscope of the crime scene.\n\n300\n00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,230\n>> And\nhere's something else to think about.\n\n301\n00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,820\nI'm kind of glad you\nbrought up that USB cap.\n\n302\n00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,743\nThink about it for a second.\n\n303\n00:17:06,743 --> 00:17:09,470\nWe know by looking at the little\norange cap that was sitting here.\n\n304\n00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,650\nWell, okay, I can just look at it and\nsay, okay, it's a cap for a USB device.\n\n305\n00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,440\nMaybe a flash drive.\n\n306\n00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:22,190\nSo okay, I see that, and\nwe may as IT people just, okay.\n\n307\n00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,528\nAs a computer forensics person I go okay,\nI know what that is I got a picture.\n\n308\n00:17:25,528 --> 00:17:27,539\nWe're good.\nI probably don't need to take that piece\n\n309\n00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:28,610\nof evidence.\n\n310\n00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,021\nWell, ask yourself for a second,\n\n311\n00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:36,021\ncould there be another reason why I\nmight take that or want to have that.\n\n312\n00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,194\n>> Could be fingerprints on there.\n\n313\n00:17:37,194 --> 00:17:38,079\n>> There you go.\n\n314\n00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,300\n>> Right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n315\n00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,100\n>> Cross disciplinary teams.\n\n316\n00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,980\nWe set this up here and\nI was talking about it,\n\n317\n00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,490\nI said we had an employee that\nwas suspected of doing something.\n\n318\n00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,848\nIf I put that in another context,\n\n319\n00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:56,240\nthat this was somebody that has\na serial killer or something.\n\n320\n00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,586\nWell, they're gonna start\nbringing in other teams for\n\n321\n00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:01,798\ncriminal investigative purposes.\n\n322\n00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:05,220\nAnd they are gonna wanna start pulling\nfingerprints and stuff like that.\n\n323\n00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,500\nSo there's another reason right there.\n\n324\n00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,520\n>> Absolutely.\n\n325\n00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,550\nAnother common mistake we see in the world\nof digital forensic investigations,\n\n326\n00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,380\ncould be weak or\nnonexistent chain of custody, right?\n\n327\n00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:26,608\n>> Oh, man, that have led to some\npretty sad chapters in law enforcement.\n\n328\n00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:30,720\nYou don't wanna be on that end of it.\n\n329\n00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,100\nFirst of all, it's very unprofessional.\n\n330\n00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,930\nIt shows bad form, and\nit's just plain stupid.\n\n331\n00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,240\nAnd shame on you if you\nbreak a chain of custody.\n\n332\n00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,209\nI was reading actually about\none case when I was trying\n\n333\n00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:47,974\nto pull up some interesting cases here.\n\n334\n00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:52,708\nAnd we'll talk about some interesting\ncases as we go through but\n\n335\n00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:56,225\nthey had one where they\naccused a guy of murder.\n\n336\n00:18:56,225 --> 00:18:58,787\nAnd so\nit's not a digital forensics case, but\n\n337\n00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:01,730\nit does show the value\nof a chain of custody.\n\n338\n00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,300\nAs they accuse the guy of murder, and\n\n339\n00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,765\nthey found the body of the woman\nhe supposedly had murdered.\n\n340\n00:19:08,765 --> 00:19:14,895\nAnd when they took pictures at the crime\nscene the body looked a certain way.\n\n341\n00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:20,451\nBut when it got to where it was\nthere was actually marks on\n\n342\n00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:25,548\nthe body that weren't there\nwhen it got to the lab.\n\n343\n00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:30,083\nThe other thing is that they said the\ndrive from the crime scene to the lab at\n\n344\n00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,246\nmost with traffic should\nhave taken 45 minutes.\n\n345\n00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:34,979\nNow they had a two hour gap in there.\n\n346\n00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:37,166\n>> Hm.\n>> And they said that should never,\n\n347\n00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,644\never have taken two hours.\n\n348\n00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,088\nAnd if that person is broke down,\nwell you get on the radio and you call and\n\n349\n00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:43,343\nsay you're broken down.\n\n350\n00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:45,541\nTo let them know where you are.\n\n351\n00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,750\nSo there was some serious problems there.\n\n352\n00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,409\nThis guy spent several years in prison.\n\n353\n00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:55,590\nI mean it was over a decade or\ntwo that he spent in prison\n\n354\n00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,070\nbefore they got the case reevaluated and\nreopened to say, yeah.\n\n355\n00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:05,100\nThey told the prosecution you\ndidn't present enough evidence.\n\n356\n00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,720\nThen there was also holes in that chain\nthat were very easily showing that there\n\n357\n00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,640\nwas a problem.\n\n358\n00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,810\nI mean there's no marks at the scene and\nthen there's marks when it shows up.\n\n359\n00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,490\nThere's something wrong there.\n\n360\n00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:17,990\nYeah.\n\n361\n00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,968\n>> Easiest way to get data or\n\n362\n00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:24,912\nevidence thrown out of a case is to\nnot have a proper chain of custody.\n\n363\n00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:26,946\nYeah I mean that's just\na no-brainer there, and\n\n364\n00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:29,568\nany defense attorney can get that\nthrown out pretty darn quick.\n\n365\n00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:31,170\n>> Yeah, or at least you hope you do.\n\n366\n00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,080\nThat should have been thrown out right\nthere in that case when they looked and\n\n367\n00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,368\nit was reevaluated that should\nhave been tossed right out.\n\n368\n00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:41,453\nBut this guy was thrown in prison and\nto make it even worse if you look at\n\n369\n00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:46,920\nthe case they had evidence that\npoints to the real guy right there.\n\n370\n00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,734\nThey just had so many blinders\non that were gonna get this guy.\n\n371\n00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:53,935\nBecause he was the initial one caught and\n\n372\n00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:59,840\neverything that he was the one\nthat paid the price wrongfully.\n\n373\n00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,660\n>> All right, let's switch gears here for\na second and let's talk.\n\n374\n00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,049\nI like this article that you brought up.\n\n375\n00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:08,760\nIt's talking about ten\nforensic myths spread by TV.\n\n376\n00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,630\nCuz we've all seen all of these TV shows.\n\n377\n00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,057\nI'm a big Law and Order fan.\n\n378\n00:21:12,057 --> 00:21:13,840\nA CSI fan.\n\n379\n00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,949\nFor those of you here in the US,\n\n380\n00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:17,050\nand I'm sure they're syndicated\noutside the US as well.\n\n381\n00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,580\nThese are great crime scene shows, and\nthey're all about doing investigations.\n\n382\n00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,340\nNot in particularly computer forensics,\nbut sometimes.\n\n383\n00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,470\nBut just in general.\n\n384\n00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,060\nBut it does apply to computer forensics.\n\n385\n00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,080\nAnd a couple of them that I really\nlike that we'll point out here.\n\n386\n00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,302\nForensic scientists only work on murders.\n\n387\n00:21:37,302 --> 00:21:37,816\n>> No.\n\n388\n00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:40,282\n>> Because that makes exciting TV, right?\n\n389\n00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:44,910\nIt makes for a good show but\nit's not the normal, I would say,\n\n390\n00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,880\nor definitely not all the time.\n\n391\n00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,783\n>> Yeah, it's definitely not the case for\nforensics.\n\n392\n00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:54,848\nThey're not always working\non murder cases and\n\n393\n00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:58,300\nit's not like the same thing for\ndigital forensics.\n\n394\n00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,050\nThere's not one specific case that you're\ngonna expect to work on all the time.\n\n395\n00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:09,240\nI mean, sometimes they do task\npeople with a certain type of case,\n\n396\n00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,040\nbut that's the exception and not the rule.\n\n397\n00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,450\nEven in those situations,\n\n398\n00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,205\nwhere they have someone investigating\na specific type of case all the time.\n\n399\n00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:19,954\nThey get rotated out of those\npositions because there's\n\n400\n00:22:19,954 --> 00:22:21,580\na very specific reason for it.\n\n401\n00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,730\nI won't get into it here, but\nthere is a very specific reason.\n\n402\n00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:30,728\nAnd the situation I'm talking about,\nthe specific reason is mental.\n\n403\n00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:31,975\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n404\n00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,424\n>> It wears them down mentally.\n\n405\n00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,800\nSo they just can, like I said, I won't\nworry about what type of cases they are,\n\n406\n00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,540\nbut yeah they rotate them out and\nbring someone else in.\n\n407\n00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,649\n>> And a lot of times, these cases that\nwe're working on as a digital forensic\n\n408\n00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:46,750\ninvestigator could be data sent out.\n\n409\n00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,091\nSo espionage or people stealing data or\nusing a laptop for\n\n410\n00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:55,430\nsomething inappropriate, god forbid,\nchild pornography or something like that.\n\n411\n00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,990\nSo, it's not always going to be about\nthis high profile murder case, or\n\n412\n00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,650\nanything like that.\n\n413\n00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,599\n>> That's the one, by the way.\n\n414\n00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,485\nSince you brought it up, yeah, that's\nthe one the child pornography cases.\n\n415\n00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:06,690\nI know several places that\nthey'll keep someone in there.\n\n416\n00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,010\nThey'll let them work those cases for\nabout a year.\n\n417\n00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,972\nAnd then they'll rotate them to another\npart of forensics or something.\n\n418\n00:23:11,972 --> 00:23:18,206\nBecause any sane person or any normal\nperson, that takes something out of you.\n\n419\n00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:18,865\n>> That's gonna affect you.\n\n420\n00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,355\n>> A lot out of you.\n\n421\n00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,466\n>> All right and\nanother one that I love, and\n\n422\n00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:25,140\nthis one always bothers me with the shows.\n\n423\n00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,580\nThe forensic investigators are the ones\nthat do the interrogation of the subjects\n\n424\n00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,565\nand make the arrests.\n\n425\n00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:33,258\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, as a digital forensic investigator,\n\n426\n00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:35,415\nI gotta be prepared to do interrogations.\n\n427\n00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,377\nI'm gonna have my cuffs with me cuz\nI'm gonna go in and arrest people.\n\n428\n00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,540\nI'm knocking down doors, right?\n\n429\n00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,602\nYeah, I mean, I've only pistol\nwhipped people a couple times.\n\n430\n00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:44,828\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n431\n00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:46,546\nthen I realized I wasn't\nallowed to carry a gun.\n\n432\n00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:47,532\n>> Right.\n\n433\n00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:50,205\n[LAUGH]\n>> But, yeah,\n\n434\n00:23:50,205 --> 00:23:54,540\nyou're gonna be doing interviews.\n\n435\n00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,255\nBut interviews and interrogations,\n\n436\n00:23:57,255 --> 00:24:01,336\nthere's a definite difference\nin tone between the two.\n\n437\n00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:06,780\nAnd so, if an interview looks like\nit's turning towards an interrogation,\n\n438\n00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,300\nthe persons not gonna help you out,\nor kind of is resisting you,\n\n439\n00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,420\nthen the other things\nare coming into play.\n\n440\n00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,780\nThey are going to be lawyering up.\n\n441\n00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,270\nThere's going to be all\nsorts of legal issues and\n\n442\n00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,980\nthings involved, and that's not you.\n\n443\n00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,380\nYou may be involved in that process, but\n\n444\n00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,470\nyou're probably not going to be\nthe one doing the interrogating.\n\n445\n00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,030\nDetectives, they want to talk to you and\nget things from you, but\n\n446\n00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,286\nthey're not going to have you\nin the room more than likely.\n\n447\n00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:37,900\n>> Another one that they love to do,\nand I understand, right?\n\n448\n00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,650\nOn TV shows,\nwe've got a constrained amount of time.\n\n449\n00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,015\nIt's amazing how all this stuff\ngets solved in an hour, right?\n\n450\n00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,075\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And that's including\n\n451\n00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:45,265\ncommercial time.\n\n452\n00:24:45,265 --> 00:24:48,835\nSo, tests are done in a matter of hours,\nnot so much the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n453\n00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:53,895\nI love it when they break the encryption\non somebody hard drive in like\n\n454\n00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:54,535\nfive minutes.\n\n455\n00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:58,300\nThey start some program, they walk away,\nall of a sudden they hear a bing.\n\n456\n00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,745\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh I've got it, it's done.\n\n457\n00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:00,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right,\n\n458\n00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,250\nyou know they turn back around and\nthere's the results waiting for them.\n\n459\n00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:08,540\n>> Yeah, I think probably all\nof us know that's not reality.\n\n460\n00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,170\nAnd in fact, it's far from that\n\n461\n00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:18,000\none of the things we have as forensic\n\n462\n00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,380\ntechs is that we may very well have to,\nat some point, crack passwords or\n\n463\n00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,800\ntry to recover decryption keys and\nthere's ways to do that.\n\n464\n00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,410\nIn fact, amazingly enough,\nthere's actually for password cracking.\n\n465\n00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,650\nFor forensic technicians,\n\n466\n00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,330\nyou can actually buy hardware devices that\nspeed that up by like a factor of ten.\n\n467\n00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,520\nThey've actually purpose built devices so\n\n468\n00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,550\nthat you're not running software on\nthe computer that'll crack the password.\n\n469\n00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,190\nNow they just have a box that will tune\na couple of things in and let it go.\n\n470\n00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,400\nIt's still gonna take some time,\nyes, but it will.\n\n471\n00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,370\nHelp that whole process that's its\none purpose in life to do that.\n\n472\n00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,190\n>> Nice.\n\n473\n00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,210\nAnd then we'll round off this little\nsegment with another one that's\n\n474\n00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:01,910\na very common thing.\n\n475\n00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,480\nForensics labs are high tech and stocked\nwith all of the necessary equipment.\n\n476\n00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,620\nI mean, every TV show you see,\nwhen you walk into there and\n\n477\n00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,360\nthey got all the bells and\nwhistles, right?\n\n478\n00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,290\nAnd so that's what I can expect\nas a forensic investigator.\n\n479\n00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,650\nWhen I get hired somewhere,\nI'm gonna have an unlimited budget and\n\n480\n00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,501\nI can buy all the tools I want.\n\n481\n00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:21,195\n>> Nah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n482\n00:26:21,195 --> 00:26:21,700\n>> No.\n\n483\n00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,550\nRight.\n\n484\n00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,930\n>> Not so much right?\n\n485\n00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,530\n>> Yeah, and\n\n486\n00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,855\nthey're gonna issue a unicorn to you too.\n\n487\n00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:31,410\n[LAUGH] So,\nyou're gonna have all those things.\n\n488\n00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,530\nForensic technicians, you know,\n\n489\n00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:39,060\nyou may be lucky enough to work in\na situation that is pretty well stocked.\n\n490\n00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,730\nBut if you're someone that is working for\na corporation or\n\n491\n00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,580\nsomething like that, you're probably\nnot going to be that way and\n\n492\n00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,250\na lot of law enforcement\ndoesn't have that.\n\n493\n00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,520\nDoesn't have that either.\n\n494\n00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,260\nThey will outsource that or they have\njust one lab that handles that for\n\n495\n00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,750\na whole location or region.\n\n496\n00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,660\nInterestingly enough,\nI remember yesterday I was\n\n497\n00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,650\ntalking about the High Tech\nCrime Investigators Association.\n\n498\n00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,750\nI talked to a couple of\nthe officers I sat next\n\n499\n00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:15,160\nto at lunch, on those things were\nsaying how they had on their own,\n\n500\n00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,250\nthis kinda goes with what\nDeborah was talking about, too.\n\n501\n00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:23,510\nThese guys are, I don't wanna say just,\nit sounds like I'm putting them down.\n\n502\n00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,165\nBut they're beat cops,\nthey do their patrol and stuff like that.\n\n503\n00:27:27,165 --> 00:27:28,965\nThey're not detectives or anything.\n\n504\n00:27:28,965 --> 00:27:33,095\nBut they were so enthusiastic,\nlike you guys are,\n\n505\n00:27:33,095 --> 00:27:37,485\nabout this field that they\ngot raining themselves.\n\n506\n00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:39,310\nAnd they learned how to do this.\n\n507\n00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:48,260\nAnd they would be called as\nexperts now and then to assist.\n\n508\n00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,240\nIt was a cool thing for them,\n\n509\n00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,217\nbut they didn't have much in\nthe way of equipment at all.\n\n510\n00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:59,560\nThey had very basic stuff.\n\n511\n00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,370\nThey pretty much had the same\nstuff that we showed yesterday,\n\n512\n00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,790\nand that we're gonna be using\nthroughout the next week and a half.\n\n513\n00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,890\nThey would have access to\nthose same types of things.\n\n514\n00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,580\nThey didn't have anything fancy.\n\n515\n00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,250\nAnd on top of it,\nthey were only forensic technicians when\n\n516\n00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,560\ntheir department could\nspare them to do that.\n\n517\n00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,530\nSo there's these guys that were out\npatrolling that have forensic experience\n\n518\n00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,330\nand they're just wearing\na regular policeman's uniform.\n\n519\n00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,730\nThat's what they are.\n\n520\n00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,950\nThey weren't looked at as a primary\nresponsibility being a forensic tech.\n\n521\n00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,110\nYou know, so, expect something like that.\n\n522\n00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,050\n>> Absolutely.\n\n523\n00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,570\n>> You know,\nyou're not going to get all of the toys.\n\n524\n00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,330\nIt's just like saying in IT, yeah,\nyou're going to get all of the toys.\n\n525\n00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,110\nNo, you're not.\n\n526\n00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,020\n>> That's what I was going to say.\n\n527\n00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,870\nA lot of you have been in that situation.\n\n528\n00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,570\nIt's like being in IT or IT security.\n\n529\n00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,630\nYeah, it's sometimes tough to get\nthe higher ups to add that line in\n\n530\n00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,170\ntheir budget for you, because it's not\nsomething they deal with everyday, right?\n\n531\n00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,770\nI want to go tell them hey,\nwe need this equipment so\n\n532\n00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:09,710\nwe can setup our forensics lab, but we've\nnever actually had to investigate a case,\n\n533\n00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,240\nor we've done one or\ntwo over the last few years.\n\n534\n00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,530\nSo it's really hard to convince them to\nspend that money, to set up this lab for\n\n535\n00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:21,640\nsomething that's not making\nthe company money in return.\n\n536\n00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,280\nAnd that's the thing.\n\n537\n00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,470\nThe bean counters,\nthat's the way they look at it.\n\n538\n00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,970\nThere's no return on investment there.\n\n539\n00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,660\nWe have to be the ones to explain to them\nthat it can save us a lot of money in\n\n540\n00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,790\nthe long run, when we're able to\nprosecute that case and things like that.\n\n541\n00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,940\nSo, it's tough.\n\n542\n00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,880\nIt really is.\n\n543\n00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,960\n>> Now,\nkeep in mind there has been a recurring\n\n544\n00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:52,620\npoint here during the week is that\nthere's exceptions to every rule.\n\n545\n00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,890\nAnd there's certain\nindustries that you don't get\n\n546\n00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:03,040\nto make that decision, if you\nare going to be playing in that space.\n\n547\n00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,040\nThen you have to follow certain rules,\nstuff like the financial industry,\n\n548\n00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,000\na payment card industry specifically.\n\n549\n00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,210\nI knew an individual that worked in that,\nand they had a massive security\n\n550\n00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:21,990\nteam that was broken into various\npieces that specialized on things.\n\n551\n00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:28,080\nAnd they had a forensics team that\nhad some amazing equipment, but they\n\n552\n00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,360\nwere really doing the backend processing\nfor the different credit card companies.\n\n553\n00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,860\nThey're not gonna mess around, not with\nthe billions that pass through that.\n\n554\n00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,770\n>> Absolutely.\n\n555\n00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,640\n>> That's mandated that\nit has to be that way.\n\n556\n00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,370\nSo you don't get to make that choice.\n\n557\n00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,520\nBut yeah, so certain situations,\nthat's the way it's gonna happen.\n\n558\n00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,070\nMilitary would be another one\nthat'd be pretty well stocked.\n\n559\n00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,958\nFBI stuff like that.\n\n560\n00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:55,960\n>> Yeah exactly, and I think in\ngeneral times are changing, right,\n\n561\n00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,330\npeople are really starting to\nrealize the importance of security,\n\n562\n00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,430\nthe importance of the ability\nto investigate a crime or\n\n563\n00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:06,050\nan alleged crime in house,\nmaybe, things like that, so\n\n564\n00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,710\nthey really are, it's they're coming\naround, yeah, so slowly but surely.\n\n565\n00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,730\nI mean, that's why we're here, right?\n\n566\n00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,020\nBecause everybody wants to get into\ndigital forensics investigator.\n\n567\n00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,220\nWe've talked about the demand for\nsecurity over the next few years\n\n568\n00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:23,585\nis gonna be skyrocketing, so it definitely\nis changing, slowly but surely.\n\n569\n00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:25,105\n>> Absolutely.\n\n570\n00:31:25,105 --> 00:31:26,075\n>> All right, well I'll tell you what.\n\n571\n00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:28,255\nLadies and gentlemen, I hope you\nguys enjoyed this little segment.\n\n572\n00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:30,215\nWe're gonna do a few more of\nthese throughout

some actual real world examples\nof where mistake, these common mistakes\n\n576\n00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,710\nhave come back to bite\nan investigation in the you know what.\n\n577\n00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,910\nSo, take a look out for\nthose episodes and we'll keep you posted.\n\n578\n00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,170\n>> Yeah, we'll also be doing\nnot just new stories but\n\n579\n00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,090\ndoing some extended demos on some\nof the software and tools too.\n\n580\n00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:59,200\nSo, stuff that you may have attracted\nsome more of your attention during\n\n581\n00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,700\nsome of the actual segments.\n\n582\n00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,230\nWe'll have whole segments like these\nthat we just focus on a specific tool so\n\n583\n00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,140\nyou can get a closer zoom in on it.\n\n584\n00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,620\nSo, look for that too.\n\n585\n00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,248\n>> Absolutely, well I

Good morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,071\nwelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:40,750\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriano.\n\n7\n00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,160\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,880\nI am doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n9\n00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,230\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,360\nWe're continuing on with our digital\nforensic investigator episodes, and\n\n11\n00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,030\nwe're going to step away from our\nobjectives that we have for our exams.\n\n12\n00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,670\nAnd just talk about some real world cases\nwhere Forensics has come into play.\n\n13\n00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,960\nAs Sean and I were talking earlier, before\nthe show you gotta couple of examples\n\n14\n00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,590\nof where this, in the real world,\nwhere we've seen some examples of this.\n\n15\n00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,890\n>> Yeah, there's.\n\n16\n00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,470\nWe'll talk about a couple, but\n\n17\n00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,880\nthere's plenty of cases where\nsocial media has just played into.\n\n18\n00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,980\nThe whole process of investigating\na crime, or providing additional support\n\n19\n00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,630\nthat someone had done something, or may\nhave done something as the case may be.\n\n20\n00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,560\nSo it's no big surprise that this\nwould be involved in your process.\n\n21\n00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,090\nWe talked about a whole lot of things\nin doing the forensic process of\n\n22\n00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,750\ninvestigating the system, recovering\nfiles, emails, web applications.\n\n23\n00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,850\nWe haven't even got to a discussion about\nmobile devices yet in the course, but\n\n24\n00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,990\nthat's gonna be coming up.\n\n25\n00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,180\nSo there's a lot of\nthings that we have but\n\n26\n00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,970\nsocial media is a part\nof everything we do.\n\n27\n00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,130\nYou can't get away from it it seems like.\n\n28\n00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,790\nYou're always getting bugged\nto go on social media sites.\n\n29\n00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,210\nYou go to one site or another and\nthey're like, oh, you can do this,\n\n30\n00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,870\nbut please like us over here.\n\n31\n00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,270\nAnd they force you over to whatever site.\n\n32\n00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,680\nso it's all over the place.\n\n33\n00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,140\nSo obviously when people document their\nlives, cuz that's what they're doing.\n\n34\n00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,230\nWhen you look at something like tweeter or\nFacebook, Tweeter is a micro blog.\n\n35\n00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,040\nIt's what the formal term is,\n\n36\n00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,410\npeople are keeping these 140 character\nentries of what they are doing.\n\n37\n00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,233\nSome people have to tell you\neverything they've eaten.\n\n38\n00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Every time they've gone\n\n39\n00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,340\nto the restroom, so,\n>> Ain't that the truth.\n\n40\n00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,800\n>> It can be, yeah.\n\n41\n00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,330\nThey're almost doing the same job\nthat the lady in the court does,\n\n42\n00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,410\njust typing\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n43\n00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,090\n>> Doing all this stuff.\n\n44\n00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,330\nAnd they're willingly doing it, so\nall you gotta do is go find it.\n\n45\n00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,530\nAnd you talk about something like\nFacebook, they could put even much,\n\n46\n00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,060\nmuch more on there.\n\n47\n00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,200\nAnd they over share stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,000\nSome people even put here other stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,620\nI don't know if they necessarily call\nit social media, but dating sites.\n\n50\n00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,050\nPeople just share way, way too much.\n\n51\n00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,710\n>> So these are places we can look for\n\n52\n00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:16,140\npotential evidence that we might now have\nthought about it a normal investigation.\n\n53\n00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,370\n>> Yeah, and there's a lot that's\nbeen hidden out on these sites, and\n\n54\n00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,040\nsometimes just hidden in plain site.\n\n55\n00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,020\nYou don't know what\nsomeone's trying to hide.\n\n56\n00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,970\nExamples of it is ISIS.\n\n57\n00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,930\nWe have all that.\n\n58\n00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,870\nGoing on over in the Middle East in Syria,\nIraq area, we have that going on.\n\n59\n00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,500\nAnd they are constantly opening up\naccounts on Twitter and passing\n\n60\n00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,160\ninformation through it and out to there\nare different cells and all that stuff.\n\n61\n00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,520\nAnd those cups keep getting shut down but\nthey are using different hashtags.\n\n62\n00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,991\nAnd the hashtags aren't something like\nhashtag, ISIS something like that.\n\n63\n00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That would be way to obvious.\n\n64\n00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,450\nThey're using something.\n\n65\n00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,480\n>> I think the bad guys\nare smarter no hopefully right.\n\n66\n00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,500\n>> Yeah.\n>> Most of the time.\n\n67\n00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,140\nHashtag I robbed the store.\n\n68\n00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,495\nHashtag I stole your digital data.\n\n69\n00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:18,150\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah so\n\n70\n00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:25,020\nthey are definitely using this and\nthey continue to use it even today.\n\n71\n00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,960\nThey use these things\nto post information and\n\n72\n00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,240\nthey're not necessarily even\ncoming from the Syria-Iraq area.\n\n73\n00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,900\nIt could be coming from\nother areas outside that.\n\n74\n00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,970\nThey've had postings from Europe and\nthe U.S, Canada.\n\n75\n00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,210\nThey've had people that are sympathetic\nto that cause doing things.\n\n76\n00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,900\nSo it's not a case of just\nrestricting a certain geography and\n\n77\n00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,490\ncutting them out of the loop.\n\n78\n00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,220\nThere's other things\nout there to consider.\n\n79\n00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,760\nSo this is a very real and\n\n80\n00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,150\nvery dangerous area, potentially,\nthat you could be creeping into.\n\n81\n00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,230\nAnd will be creeping into.\n\n82\n00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,440\nAnd the evidence there\ncan be just staggering.\n\n83\n00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,230\nI mean, yeah.\n\n84\n00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,530\nI'm talking about terrorist groups.\n\n85\n00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,930\nYou probably will never\nhave to do that but,\n\n86\n00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,540\nand they'll investigate\nsomething on that scale.\n\n87\n00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,470\nBut expect that you could have\nsmaller scale things that\n\n88\n00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,970\npeople have very clearly\ndocumented what's going on.\n\n89\n00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,980\nThings like cyber bullying,\n\n90\n00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:28,260\nI saw someone mentioned that in here,\nor cyber bullying.\n\n91\n00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,450\nThat's definitely happened in real life,\ngiven Facebook and stuff like that.\n\n92\n00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:39,380\nThey had one, I think I mentioned in\nthe CEH cores, but they had one where\n\n93\n00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,740\na family moved from Ireland\nover here to the states.\n\n94\n00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,870\nI believe it was the Boston\narea as a matter of fact.\n\n95\n00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,626\nThey moved over there, and\ntheir child went to high school there.\n\n96\n00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:56,530\nAnd then high School, and\nshe was getting bullied through Facebook.\n\n97\n00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,850\nAnd it all started because,\nI guess the star quarterback and\n\n98\n00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,220\nbecause she dated him.\n\n99\n00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,290\nAnd some of the other more popular\ngirls that couldn't got jealous and\n\n100\n00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,030\nthey started bullying her,\nshe eventually hung herself.\n\n101\n00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,050\nAnd they had a record of that happening.\n\n102\n00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,980\nThey were actually were able to get the\nstuff from Facebook, and show images of\n\n103\n00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:22,620\nwhat was happening, and pull that\nout in court, and say here you go.\n\n104\n00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,810\nHere is the evidence that\nthey were bullying it and\n\n105\n00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,530\nthey brought the people that had done\ncyber bullying all up on charge.\n\n106\n00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,150\nI don't think anyone argue they\nshould have for that situation.\n\n107\n00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:44,940\nSo that was just one case, but there\nis plenty others that we have been used\n\n108\n00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,480\nto prove a situation or\nshow a situation did happen.\n\n109\n00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,630\n>> And we're still going to have to follow\nthings we've been talking about all along\n\n110\n00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,440\nin these episodes.\n\n111\n00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,110\nIf we're going to discover evidence\nin the social media places,\n\n112\n00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,690\nwe gotta make sure we're covered\nby the appropriate warrants.\n\n113\n00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,340\nOr have that discovery put in place or\nwhat have you, so\n\n114\n00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,040\nsame kind of concepts there.\n\n115\n00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,740\n>> Yeah, it's going to be very similar.\n\n116\n00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,110\nBecause social media is still evolving so\nquickly and it's so new.\n\n117\n00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,700\nYou're gonna have to, you're kinda\nworking in an area that's bleeding edge.\n\n118\n00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,860\nSo if you just want to\ncover your bases here,\n\n119\n00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:30,220\nyou want to be mindful of,\ndo you need a search warrant or not.\n\n120\n00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,380\nYou could probably argue on some level\n\n121\n00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,380\nif you really wanted to do this you\ncould probably argue on some level\n\n122\n00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,350\nthat someone's Facebook\naccount was made private.\n\n123\n00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,357\nOr their Twitter feed was made\nsomething that they had to invite you.\n\n124\n00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:44,806\nThat you may have to get\na search warrant for\n\n125\n00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:48,081\nthat because that's that\nwhole closed case type thing.\n\n126\n00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:50,321\nIt's not that plain view doctrine.\n\n127\n00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:54,629\nIf it's in plain view, okay,\nit's a whole different story.\n\n128\n00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:58,879\nBut if it's something that's closed off,\nyou can't hack into it or\n\n129\n00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,030\nanything like that, you probably\nneed a search warrant in that case.\n\n130\n00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,680\nThen you gotta worry about how\nyou're gonna get that information\n\n131\n00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,710\ninto the court room.\n\n132\n00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:13,360\nYou may be looking at taking screenshots\nor dumping to a PDF file and\n\n133\n00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,080\nhashing that just to verify\nthat it came from there.\n\n134\n00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,120\nSome of these social media sites even have\n\n135\n00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,940\na legal department that you can\ncontact if this type of stuff happens.\n\n136\n00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,970\nAnd you can go through the process\nwith them on what you need to do to\n\n137\n00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,430\nhave them help you out and\nprovide these things.\n\n138\n00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,260\nUsually they're pretty decent about it,\n\n139\n00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,270\nwhen you talk through social media\nstuff they're obviously gonna make you\n\n140\n00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,940\ngo through a process,\nthere's a search warrant.\n\n141\n00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,798\nThey're gonna make you\nget a search warrant.\n\n142\n00:08:40,798 --> 00:08:48,077\n[CROSSTALK] They're gonna do that, but\nthey're not gonna fight you beyond that.\n\n143\n00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:53,380\nThey're gonna say okay we understand\nyou want this but this is what we need.\n\n144\n00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,500\nIf you fill out this paperwork, and\nprovide this to your team they'll do this,\n\n145\n00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,970\nwe'll help you in whatever way we can.\n\n146\n00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,980\nThey just have to protect themselves,\nso that's a good thing,\n\n147\n00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,930\nbut yeah you may be\noperating in a gray area.\n\n148\n00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,540\nWell, you are gonna be operating in a grey\narea with social media, because it's just\n\n149\n00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,830\nso new, and think about all the places\npeople could be doing this from.\n\n150\n00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,330\nThey could be doing it from their\nmobile phone, their tablet,\n\n151\n00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,280\ntheir laptop, there's so many-\n>> Many cars nowadays.\n\n152\n00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,800\n>> Their car, yeah.\n\n153\n00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,751\nYou see those type of things.\n\n154\n00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:31,733\nYou can even go to Vegas, and\nVegas has a little kiosk.\n\n155\n00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,395\nI've seen it other places but\nI know they are in Vegas.\n\n156\n00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:36,776\nThey have these little kiosks\nthat have the screen on it and\n\n157\n00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,536\nthe camera on it and\nthat you can just go ahead and\n\n158\n00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,850\ntake a picture of yourself and\nTwitter it out to whoever.\n\n159\n00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,010\n>> Really. [LAUGH] >> If you\nreally feel like that, so\n\n160\n00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,610\nthey've got these type of\nthings just sitting out there.\n\n161\n00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,470\n>> Right.\n\n162\n00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,650\n>> For who knows that they would find,\non something like that,\n\n163\n00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,200\nor these other things.\n\n164\n00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,120\nNot to mention on top of all that,\nwhen you're looking at social media,\n\n165\n00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,730\nsocial media, in a lot of cases\ncan store GPS coordinates.\n\n166\n00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,800\nStuff that's very valuable to us to prove\nthat you were in a certain location.\n\n167\n00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,730\nYou checked in a certain location or\nyou went on Facebook on certain location.\n\n168\n00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,680\nSo if you weren't there,\nwhy was your phone there,\n\n169\n00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,335\nwhy was your tablet there,\nyou have to explain that.\n\n170\n00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,775\nSo we can use it to help\ntrack someone's movements.\n\n171\n00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,665\nThat would be helpful as well.\n\n172\n00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:30,655\n>> So Sean you said you have an example or\ntwo that we can go over\n\n173\n00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:35,555\nwhere in cases where social media did\nplay a role in the investigation process.\n\n174\n00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:41,290\n>> Yeah, they did kind of somewhat\ncome into play in different ways.\n\n175\n00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,920\nOne of them just happened\nthis last weekend,\n\n176\n00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,030\nwas down in Texas that they had a contest.\n\n177\n00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,050\nAnd I'm not trying to justify or\ncondemn the contest or\n\n178\n00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,680\nwhatever, just a statement\nof fact this occurred.\n\n179\n00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,680\nThey had a contest down in Texas\nthat some people decided to run\n\n180\n00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,070\na draw Mohamed contest for\nthe profit Mohamed from Islam.\n\n181\n00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:15,090\nAnd you knew where it was going\nbefore anything happened but\n\n182\n00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,790\nso they have this competition.\n\n183\n00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,194\nThey said whoever drew the best\nrepresentation of him would win something.\n\n184\n00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:22,018\nI don't know what is was.\n\n185\n00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:24,755\n>> It could be a radio station.\n\n186\n00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:25,533\nI don't know.\n\n187\n00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:28,017\n>> I don't know what it was doing.\n\n188\n00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:32,020\nI can't remember the group but\nit's what are you thinking?\n\n189\n00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,080\nIt just seemed to be kind\nof a not a good idea.\n\n190\n00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,260\nIt seemed to be clearly antagonistic\nis the way you could look at it.\n\n191\n00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,660\nBut in any case, what they had\nis that combinition did happen,\n\n192\n00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,795\nand they had a couple guys try\nto get in there and bomb it.\n\n193\n00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,970\nThat did happen, so\nthey tried to get in there.\n\n194\n00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,700\nTry to bomb it, and a traffic cop actually\nshot both the people that were trying\n\n195\n00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,350\nto do this, to carry this out.\n\n196\n00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,260\nThey actually found out there was,\nI believe, it's still unfolding, but\n\n197\n00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,088\nthey found explosives and\nstuff like that in their vehicle.\n\n198\n00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:15,520\nAnd they, who knows, they could have been,\n\n199\n00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,730\nif they were under different\ncircumstances, they may have been\n\n200\n00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,690\nable to drive that in, through some doors,\nand into a hall and detonate it.\n\n201\n00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,750\n>> Right.\n\n202\n00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,320\n>> And it looks like at least\nthey are claiming responsibility.\n\n203\n00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,670\nWhenever some event happens everyone\nwants to claim responsibility.\n\n204\n00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,190\nISIS is saying yeah,\nthat that's us, we did that.\n\n205\n00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,260\nAnd there's the thing where social\nmedia comes into play as their\n\n206\n00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,930\nstarting to see that,\nthat there was hash tags going back and\n\n207\n00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,310\nforth talking about that\nbetween these guys.\n\n208\n00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,900\nAnd even one guy,\nit's pretty sick and morbid,\n\n209\n00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,120\nbeyond the hash tags saying that\nthey were going to do this.\n\n210\n00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,498\nOne of them, even just moments before\nthey carried out the attempted attack and\n\n211\n00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:08,570\nwere gunned down, one of them even\nsent out a Twitter of a selfie of them\n\n212\n00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,450\ndoing that, looking at the camera kind of\nsmiling at you when you know what he's in.\n\n213\n00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,060\nAnd now, looking back,\nwhat he was about to do.\n\n214\n00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,550\nThat stuff's all been pulled,\nthat's all been pulled down since then.\n\n215\n00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,790\nSo, you're not gonna go find it, but\n\n216\n00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:27,010\nit is something that did\nhappen less than a week ago.\n\n217\n00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,330\n>> Wow.\n\n218\n00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,400\nThat's incredible.\n\n219\n00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,180\nSo in these cases we're seeing where some\nof the evidence that they're going to use,\n\n220\n00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,630\nor could have used in attempt\nto prosecute these guys\n\n221\n00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,620\ncould have been pulled from social media.\n\n222\n00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,510\n>> Yeah, it was right there.\n\n223\n00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:47,000\nIt took a little while, but\nthey found this evidence that was done.\n\n224\n00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,906\nAnd they tied it back to these\nindividuals and said okay, now we have,\n\n225\n00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:57,824\nwe've got stuff here that shows that this\nwas definitely, clearly pre-planned.\n\n226\n00:13:57,824 --> 00:14:01,562\nThey show a certain mindset, and\n\n227\n00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:05,834\nwhen you think of taking selfies, and\n\n228\n00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:11,575\nsending these put tweets\nout ahead of time they were\n\n229\n00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:16,934\ndoing this [INAUDIBLE]\nwere sending out tweets.\n\n230\n00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:21,590\nSo these things went out ahead of time and\nthey did this but\n\n231\n00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,490\nthe results were they\nweren't able to pull it off.\n\n232\n00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,620\nThey do have some of the stuff out there,\n\n233\n00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,640\nevidence showing that\nthere was was planning.\n\n234\n00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,070\nYou would almost say that if\nthey put hashtags out there\n\n235\n00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,780\nthey meant it for\nother people to go search on.\n\n236\n00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:44,160\nSo, who knows who would\nhave been looking for that,\n\n237\n00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,180\ncould've been if it really was ISIS.\n\n238\n00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,600\nThey could've been publicizing\nthat through their own TV and\n\n239\n00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,610\nbroadcast which they do have.\n\n240\n00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,610\nAnd said hey, search on this and\nit was successful and\n\n241\n00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,110\nhere's what our guys did and\nall those types of things.\n\n242\n00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,870\n>> And then you were mentioning\nanother case before our show\n\n243\n00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,310\nthat kind of plays in here as well.\n\n244\n00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,520\nYeah, they had another one.\n\n245\n00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,782\nIt's another one that's just kinda sad.\n\n246\n00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:14,999\nThey had a couple that, their child died\n\n247\n00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:21,940\nin the car after being left\nthere on a 80 degree day.\n\n248\n00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,017\nThe car got up to 80 degrees inside and\nactually it was a little higher than that.\n\n249\n00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:29,830\nBut the kid died of heat injuries.\n\n250\n00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,470\nAnd so they,\nthe father had left the kid in the car.\n\n251\n00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,823\nAnd, they already knew something\nwas kinda off when they had,\n\n252\n00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:45,176\nwhen they told the wife they said well,\nyour child has passed,\n\n253\n00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:49,530\nhas died from being left\nin the car because of this.\n\n254\n00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:55,020\n>> And she didn't ask about the kid,\nshe asked where is my husband.\n\n255\n00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,660\nThat was the first thing, so,\nthey said that's kind of weird,\n\n256\n00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,290\nbut everyone deals with things a little\ndifferently, but there were other things\n\n257\n00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,750\nthat pointed to it, point there\nwas something more going on here.\n\n258\n00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,690\nUnder questioning,\n\n259\n00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,900\nthere were certain responses that both\nof them gave that just weren't right.\n\n260\n00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,720\nAnd then she starts saying,\nno I'm not testifying against him or\n\n261\n00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,120\ngoing to say anything\nagainst him at all and\n\n262\n00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,410\nit wasn't that the normal supportive\nwife type thing being well I don't\n\n263\n00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,260\nthink he did it or I can't believe\nthis happened, any type of that stuff.\n\n264\n00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,020\nIt's like no I am not\ntestifying against him.\n\n265\n00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,910\nShe was very adamant about that.\n\n266\n00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,090\nAnd so they said, that doesn't fit,\n\n267\n00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:43,000\nIt's someone basically saying that they\nknow more, that there's more to this,\n\n268\n00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,330\nand they're digging there heels in and\ngetting ready for a fight.\n\n269\n00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,240\n>> So that raised the flags, and then they\ntook the investigation a little further.\n\n270\n00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,487\n>> Yeah, they definitely took it further,\nthey searched the guy's phone,\n\n271\n00:16:56,487 --> 00:17:00,710\nand then they started looking\nat social media accounts.\n\n272\n00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:05,750\nThey got a search warrant and\nlooked at his computer, the looks of all\n\n273\n00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,280\nthese things, they found the guy was\nactually leading a double life, and\n\n274\n00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,950\nthe family kinda was too,\nbecause the wife knew about this as well.\n\n275\n00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,625\nHe acted one way about.\n\n276\n00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:22,245\nBe really nice, friendly guy and\nall those types of things.\n\n277\n00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:25,605\nThe ones they always say,\nhe wouldn't hurt anybody or do anything.\n\n278\n00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:28,175\nThat type of person they always say about,\n\n279\n00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:33,140\nthey talk about, well they had that,\nbut then they also had this guy that,\n\n280\n00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,000\nhis other lifestyle was having\nmistresses and all other types of stuff.\n\n281\n00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000\nAnd so they said okay, well, there's that,\nand that's still not enough to show\n\n282\n00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,580\nguy's doing adultery and all that show\nthat they did something to this child.\n\n283\n00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,800\nBut then they started searching\nhis social media accounts and\n\n284\n00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,750\nhis mobile phone, they found that\nhe had done searches through\n\n285\n00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,840\ndifferent social media networks and\nthrough Google.\n\n286\n00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,460\nHe had also searched things like,\n\n287\n00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,280\ngetting rid of a child and\nhow to kill a kid in a car.\n\n288\n00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,940\nHe had searched for those things,\nand they found that.\n\n289\n00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,020\nAnd they had found that the wife\nactually knew about it too.\n\n290\n00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,660\nThey both decided they didn't\nwant the kid anymore, and\n\n291\n00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,850\nthis was how they were\ngonna take their child out.\n\n292\n00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,640\n>> Oh, wow.\n\n293\n00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,240\n>> And so they are up on murder charges or\n\n294\n00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,130\nwere convicted of murder\ncharges of course.\n\n295\n00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:35,610\nThat case is not just one of the quote\nsimple murder or manslaughter charges.\n\n296\n00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,860\nIt's going to top of the stack.\n\n297\n00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,260\nThat's first degree because they planned,\nthat was pre-planned.\n\n298\n00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,960\nThey can show that all there.\n\n299\n00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,300\nAll the forensic evidence points\nto that cuz there were only.\n\n300\n00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:52,750\nThere was calls being made, the way she\nacted was definitely predetermined.\n\n301\n00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,390\nShe knew what was going on already.\n\n302\n00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,580\nHe had searched on this stuff.\n\n303\n00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,970\nAnd so there was all the things showing\nthis was definitely premeditated.\n\n304\n00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,978\nAnd so they murdered their\nchild just to get rid of it.\n\n305\n00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:10,916\nThey didn't wanna, kid was only like\nabout three or four years old and\n\n306\n00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,200\nthey did this to them.\n\n307\n00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,420\n>> So if they wouldn't have had that\nevidence on their social media sights\n\n308\n00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,400\nthey might have,\nmaybe not gotten away with it, but\n\n309\n00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,580\nmaybe been able to lie about the\ncircumstance and not got a serious charge.\n\n310\n00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,540\nSo this was the social media that forensic\ninvestigation through social media,\n\n311\n00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,630\ngave them the information they needed to.\n\n312\n00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,990\n>> Make sure that they\nwere punished correctly.\n\n313\n00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,840\n>> Yeah, it definitely provided,\n\n314\n00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,180\nextra weight that this was\ndefinitely a preplanned thing,\n\n315\n00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,800\nthis was not an accident that he just,\ngot distracted or whatever.\n\n316\n00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:51,080\nThis was something that he had\ndefinitely thought about ahead of time.\n\n317\n00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,140\nShe had definitely thought\nabout ahead of time.\n\n318\n00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,770\nI mean he apparently from,\n\n319\n00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,140\none of the other pieces of information\nthat came into this along the way,\n\n320\n00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:04,040\nhe'd even searched on how to survive\na two to four year prison term.\n\n321\n00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:09,630\nHe fully expected that, to be convicted of\n\n322\n00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,840\naccidentally leaving his child in\nthe car fully expecting to be convicted,\n\n323\n00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,270\nsaying okay I'll just shrug it off and\ngo to prison for\n\n324\n00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,970\nprobably at most four years for that\ncharge and I'll be out and no more kid.\n\n325\n00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,780\nThere was definitely a lot of\npreplanning going on here and\n\n326\n00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,440\nall that social media stuff, yeah.\n\n327\n00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,520\nAll the gathering of things off\nthe mobile device and interrogations.\n\n328\n00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,150\nA lot of the stuff that we've talked\nabout all came together to say yeah,\n\n329\n00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:45,890\nnot only did you do it,\nyou planned this some ways out and\n\n330\n00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,180\nyou're gonna get a more\nserious charge off of this.\n\n331\n00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,690\n>> Wow, nice.\n\n332\n00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,470\nIt's gotta make you feel good though.\n\n333\n00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,591\nIf you're the investigator that finds\nthat stuff and brings that to light.\n\n334\n00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:54,600\nThat's gotta be a good feeling.\n\n335\n00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,874\n>> Yeah, I remember hearing one of\nthe forensic experts that works,\n\n336\n00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:06,812\nthe more what I would call\nthe traditional field of forensics,\n\n337\n00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:11,294\nwhere they're doing\nautopsies with bodies and\n\n338\n00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:15,670\ndoing that was I think\nit was Michael Bodden.\n\n339\n00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,710\nI think that's his name.\n\n340\n00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,762\nI may be wrong.\n\n341\n00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:24,430\nJoe [INAUDIBLE] he's a big deal on that\nside and they've had TV shows on him.\n\n342\n00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,530\nHBO did a whole series\ngoing through his cases.\n\n343\n00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,920\nFascinating if you ever see it.\n\n344\n00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,659\nHe made a comment that said\na lot of times, the forensic\n\n345\n00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:42,570\nexaminers are the people that get to\nspeak for the dead cuz they don't get to.\n\n346\n00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,290\n>> All right.\n>> So\n\n347\n00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,655\nit kind of adds a lot of weight to it and\nI know it kind of adds a,\n\n348\n00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:52,180\nkinda sobers everything up and\nends in a somber note, but it really is.\n\n349\n00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,070\nYou may be speaking for\nsomeone that's no longer there.\n\n350\n00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,600\nIn this case, that child's not gonna\nhave a life, that child has been.\n\n351\n00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:07,750\nSnuffed out with no reason what so ever, a\nforensic examiner, someone along the way,\n\n352\n00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,780\nput all the stuff together and was able to\nprovide that evidence that showed that,\n\n353\n00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,272\nhey this is what you did,\nand you're gonna pay for it.\n\n354\n00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:21,410\n>> All right, well a couple of really good\nexamples of digital forensics in action,\n\n355\n00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,250\nshowing that the forensic\ninvestigation they we're doing\n\n356\n00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,810\ncan uncover evidence that wasn't there.\n\n357\n00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,780\nAnd in these two cases,\nwhere social media and\n\n358\n00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,940\nforensic investigations\nkinda came together and\n\n359\n00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,610\nprovided evidence that allowed these\ncases to be successfully prosecuted.\n\n360\n00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,600\n>> Yeah.\n\n361\n00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,780\n>> All right, well I hope you\nguys enjoyed that little episode.\n\n362\n00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,039\nStay tuned,\nwe'll do some more of those in the future.\n\n363\n00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,991\nFor now, we're going to sign off,\nso signing off for ITProTV,\n\n364\n00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:48,985\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n365\n00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:50,135\n>> And I'm Shawn Oregano.\n\n366\n00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,423\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n367\n00:22:51,423 --> 00:23:01,423\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n368\n00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:12,130\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",
