          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,072\n[SOUND] Welcome everybody to our\n\n2\n00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:11,906\ndigital forensic investigator series.\n\n3\n00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:13,901\nI'm Mike Rodrick and with me today is Mr.\n\n4\n00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:17,606\nSean Oriyano, and we wanna give you\na heads up on what we're gonna be covering\n\n5\n00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:20,230\nin our digital forensic\ninvestigator series.\n\n6\n00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,330\nAnd probably, Sean, the first thing we\nneed to talk about is who the heck is\n\n7\n00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,762\na digital forensic investigator?\n\n8\n00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:28,622\nWho's gonna be interested in taking or\nwatching these episodes?\n\n9\n00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:29,493\n>> That's a great question.\n\n10\n00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:32,043\nBecause we wanna really kinda\npin down who the audience is and\n\n11\n00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:34,240\ntalk about what a forensic\ninvestigator is.\n\n12\n00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,110\nSo, briefly, a forensic investigator is\ngonna be someone who's doing corporate or\n\n13\n00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,360\ncriminal investigations, collecting,\npreserving and analyzing evidence, and\n\n14\n00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,650\ngetting it ready to be presented in court,\nif need be.\n\n15\n00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,600\nThey may be presenting it or someone\nelse may be presenting it, who will\n\n16\n00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,690\nserve as the expert witness, but either\nway, it's gonna kind of address that.\n\n17\n00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,210\nYou are gonna be running processes,\nprocedures for one of those two areas.\n\n18\n00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,635\n>> So, we're gonna be like\nCSI in the digital world,\n\n19\n00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:03,310\nthat's what you're telling me.\n\n20\n00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,755\nWe're gonna be going out there and\ninvestigating these crime scenes, where\n\n21\n00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:10,359\npeople have used computers to make some\nkind of attack against other computers or\n\n22\n00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,320\nto forge something or something like that.\n\n23\n00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,189\nAnd it's gonna be up to us, the digital\nforensic investigator to capture that\n\n24\n00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:20,055\ninformation, find all that evidence\nthey've done so much to try to hide, and\n\n25\n00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:22,714\nthen bring it into court and\nprosecute those people.\n\n26\n00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:26,172\n>> Yeah, once we get into the real\nmeat of this whole thing,\n\n27\n00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:31,210\nyou'll see how varied the crime is that\nyou could be expected to investigate.\n\n28\n00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,820\nIt could be denial of service type stuff,\nit could actually be terrorism,\n\n29\n00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,850\nit could be something as mundane, maybe,\n\n30\n00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,820\nas violating corporate policy,\nit could be someone creating malware.\n\n31\n00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,060\nForensics, for example,\n\n32\n00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,890\nplayed a big role in catching the author\nof the Melissa virus years ago.\n\n33\n00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,653\nThat was a big part of that, so there's\nsome big cases that have this has played\n\n34\n00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:53,204\na big role in, and there's a whole\nbunch of other ones behind the scenes.\n\n35\n00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:57,120\nBut, this is a really exciting and\ndeveloping field, kind of being able to\n\n36\n00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,015\nlift the lid and peek in, and\nsee what's hidden underneath the surface.\n\n37\n00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:01,650\n>> Heck, yeah.\n\n38\n00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,000\nThis is the cool part of security.\n\n39\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,300\nSo, in our course, we're going\nto cover a gamut of information.\n\n40\n00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,520\nAll the way from going to the crime scene,\ncollecting the evidence,\n\n41\n00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,480\npreserving the evidence,\nprocessing that evidence.\n\n42\n00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,090\nAnd then, turn it into some kind of\ndeliverable, that we can take in the end,\n\n43\n00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,655\neither us or whoever has to go to court.\n\n44\n00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:25,117\nSo, what kind of information are we\ngonna learn watching these episodes?\n\n45\n00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:28,145\n>> We've got tons for you in this course.\n\n46\n00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:30,535\nWe'll be learning technical information,\n\n47\n00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:33,570\nprobably deeper technical\ninformation than you've had before.\n\n48\n00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,800\nWe'll be doing some things that you\nprobably didn't think were possible,\n\n49\n00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,320\njust to recover evidence.\n\n50\n00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,980\nWe'll figure those ones out.\n\n51\n00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,520\nWe'll be doing that in the hardware,\nwe'll be doing that in software.\n\n52\n00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,280\nThen, we'll be figuring out,\nonce we learn those procedures,\n\n53\n00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,820\nalso be talking about\nhow you can collect it.\n\n54\n00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,650\nCuz you just can't go through and scoop\nsomething up and say here, it's evidence.\n\n55\n00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,470\nIt has to be collected a certain way.\n\n56\n00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,620\nAnd has to be documented a certain way.\n\n57\n00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,610\nAnd then,\nwhen we put that on the table and\n\n58\n00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,760\nwe sprinkle some other stuff on\ntop of it which has to go there,\n\n59\n00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,590\nthat's the legal procedures which may not\nbe the most exciting things, granted.\n\n60\n00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,210\nBut it's something that you\ndo have to also address.\n\n61\n00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,710\nSomething like federal rules of evidence,\nand local and\n\n62\n00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,598\nstate laws wherever possible.\n\n63\n00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't worry we're not going to turn you\n\n64\n00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,772\ninto a lawyer.\n\n65\n00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:18,606\nBut there's gonna be a lot of\nneat stuff here to cover and\n\n66\n00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:20,850\nsome stuff that you'll find interesting.\n\n67\n00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,011\nWarrants, stuff like that.\n\n68\n00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:23,830\n>> It really is fascinating.\n\n69\n00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,290\nAnd it's extremely important.\n\n70\n00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,080\nBecause when we talk about cyber crimes,\nor if somebody is doing something illegal\n\n71\n00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,860\nusing computers, as you said, we wanna\nbe able to prosecute them in the end.\n\n72\n00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,160\nThat's the whole goal.\n\n73\n00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,120\nAnd I can't just go in there blindly,\nlike you said, and go, oh,\n\n74\n00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,950\nhere's their computer.\n\n75\n00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,960\nAnd I'm gonna start opening up Windows and\n\n76\n00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,780\nlooking at log files and searching their\nhard drive for files and things like that.\n\n77\n00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,125\nAnd at that point,\nI have pretty much ruined everything, and\n\n78\n00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,530\nwe're probably never gonna be\nable to prosecute that person.\n\n79\n00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,100\n>> Here, let me just kind of build on\nsomething he said here and kinda show you.\n\n80\n00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,803\nOne of the things that, it's not to\npick on you or anything about it.\n\n81\n00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:00,870\n>> It's okay, you can pick on me.\n\n82\n00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,438\n>> I'm going to pick on him.\n\n83\n00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we got two weeks of that.\n\n84\n00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,580\n>> It's a good thing I\ngot thick skin [LAUGH].\n\n85\n00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,200\n>> So,\nwe're just going to work up from here.\n\n86\n00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,730\nBut one of the things that is a common\nthing to think about forensics\n\n87\n00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,130\nwhich we're gonna learn differently is\nyou may not take it to actual court,\n\n88\n00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,200\nyou may not be prosecuting someone.\n\n89\n00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,020\nYou may actually be working\ninside a corporation that may be\n\n90\n00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,000\ncollecting evidence because they need to\nsay, hey, this person violated policy,\n\n91\n00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,510\nwe've got the paperwork to back it up and\nyou're outta here.\n\n92\n00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,290\nAnd maybe, just for that, but\nit doesn't mean because you're\n\n93\n00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,520\njust letting someone go out of a company\ndoesn't mean there's a lesser standard.\n\n94\n00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,210\nThat person that you let go could say,\nwell, heck with you, I didn't do that,\n\n95\n00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,240\nI'm gonna sue you.\n\n96\n00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,280\nNow, you're going to court.\n\n97\n00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,660\nSo, you still have to collect it,\nand along the same lines but\n\n98\n00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,510\nyou may not be prosecuting it.\n\n99\n00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,040\n>> Gotcha.\n>> Just to kind of give you a peek of some\n\n100\n00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,090\nof the things that might actually\nchange your way of thinking.\n\n101\n00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,555\n>> And\nthat's why we've got the expert here.\n\n102\n00:04:58,555 --> 00:04:59,483\n[LAUGH]\n>> Bam!\n\n103\n00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:00,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n104\n00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,539\nSean we've got a bunch\nof great information,\n\n105\n00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,870\nwe're gonna be going\nover in these episodes.\n\n106\n00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,910\nIn the end,\nwe might wanna get certified as well.\n\n107\n00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,730\nWe might wanna be able to prove what we\nknow so that we can go out and get a job,\n\n108\n00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,350\nif we're not already employed.\n\n109\n00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,720\nMaybe, we wanna go get a job or\nmaybe you wanna change fields and\n\n110\n00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,705\nget into this really exciting forensic\ninvestigator's type lifestyle.\n\n111\n00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:23,165\nSo, there's a couple certifications\nwe might be able to obtain with\n\n112\n00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:25,825\na little setting and\nwatching these episodes.\n\n113\n00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,475\n>> Yes, there are a couple of\ncertifications that really just kind of\n\n114\n00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,865\njump out at you,\n\n115\n00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:33,530\nbecause there's a whole kind of a sea\nof forensic certifications really.\n\n116\n00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,955\nThere are different specialties and\nall it in there.\n\n117\n00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:39,940\nBut the two that come to mind for\ntaking this particular course\n\n118\n00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,510\nare EC-Council Computer Hacking\nForensic Investigator and then,\n\n119\n00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,070\nthere's also ISC squared,\nthe people that do the CISSP.\n\n120\n00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,464\nThey also have one called CCFP, which\nis some alphabet soup which stands for,\n\n121\n00:05:52,464 --> 00:05:54,137\nputting Mike on the spot now.\n\n122\n00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:56,996\n>> Certified Cyber Forensic Professional.\n\n123\n00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:59,480\nCertified Cyber Forensic Professional.\n\n124\n00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,310\nIf I can say that one word.\n\n125\n00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,680\nSo, yeah,\na couple of great certifications.\n\n126\n00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,520\nThink that,\nyou can watch these episodes and\n\n127\n00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520\nyou could walk out of here\nwith two certifications.\n\n128\n00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,060\nMany letters to put behind your name.\n\n129\n00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,940\nI've got some information pulled up here\non my screen, if we wanna look at it.\n\n130\n00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:18,425\nThe EC Council, again, puts on the\nComputer Hacking Forensic Investigator.\n\n131\n00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:22,722\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's their exam number, 312-49.\n\n132\n00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:25,393\nThey're currently on\nversion 8 of that exam.\n\n133\n00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:29,900\nAnd you can see here on my screen, it's\ngonna be a test of about 150 questions.\n\n134\n00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,310\nIt's primarily multiple choice and\nyou're gonna need to get a 70% or\n\n135\n00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,672\ngreater to pass that exam and\nget that certification.\n\n136\n00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:38,970\nThey're gonna give you four\nhours to take that exam.\n\n137\n00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,702\nSo, plenty of time to get through there.\n\n138\n00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:44,240\nAnd there's several different vendors\nyou can go through to take that exam.\n\n139\n00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,380\nYou've got Prometric Prime,\nwhich is there online.\n\n140\n00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,420\nSo, if I don't have an authorized testing\ncenter, I might be able to take it through\n\n141\n00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,930\nPrometric Prime, where I've got just,\nwhat do you call it, proctor.\n\n142\n00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,370\nSomebody that's gonna proctor the exam,\nand I can take it on any computer.\n\n143\n00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,720\nThey also offer it, of course,\nthrough their authorized test centers.\n\n144\n00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,630\nWith the Prometric test\ncenters as well as VUE, so\n\n145\n00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,650\nif the test center in your area is Pearson\nVUE, you can take it through there.\n\n146\n00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,530\nThe cost for the exam is a little steep.\n\n147\n00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,996\nIt's gonna be $500 for that exam,\n\n148\n00:07:13,996 --> 00:07:18,080\nplus you're gonna have to\npay a $100 application fee.\n\n149\n00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,360\nSo, once you're ready, you've studied,\n\n150\n00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,760\nyou've got the information you need,\nyou go to EC Council's website,\n\n151\n00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,859\nyou fill out an application,\nyou send them in 100 bucks,\n\n152\n00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:32,060\nthey're gonna send you back a voucher that\nyou can then go use and take that exam.\n\n153\n00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,240\nSo, that's the EC council,\n\n154\n00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,710\nthat's the computer hacking forensic\ninvestigator certification.\n\n155\n00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,700\nAlso, you might be interested\nin taking the ISC squared exam\n\n156\n00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,550\nwhich is their brand new one,\nthe Certified Cyber Forensic Professional.\n\n157\n00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,390\nVery similar,\nas far as the test breakdown goes.\n\n158\n00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,400\nAnother four hours for that exam,\nabout 125 questions on this one.\n\n159\n00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,060\nAgain, multiple choice type questions.\n\n160\n00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,220\nYou need to get a 700 or a 70% out\nof 1000 points to pass that exam.\n\n161\n00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,140\nAnd what else?\n\n162\n00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,612\nOh, the cost for that one is $549.\n\n163\n00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:06,438\nSo, you can see, there pretty comparable.\n\n164\n00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:08,900\n>> Imagine, two four hour exams.\n\n165\n00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,020\n>> I know, you can spend all day.\n\n166\n00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,360\n>> Get the kids a baby sitter.\n\n167\n00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,912\nYou're gonna be busy.\n\n168\n00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:15,020\n>> [LAUGH] You can definitely\nspend all day in that booth, so\n\n169\n00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,150\nyou might wanna break that up to\nseparate days if you're gonna do it.\n\n170\n00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,180\nOr heck, go all for it.\n\n171\n00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,590\nGet in there and take them both.\n\n172\n00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,230\n>> No, don't do that.\n\n173\n00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,350\n>> Don't do that,\nI'm just kidding with you.\n\n174\n00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,430\nSo, ladies and gentlemen,\nI hope you guys are as excited as we are.\n\n175\n00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,635\nStay tuned, we've got our digital forensic\ninvestigator series coming your way.\n\n176\n00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:37,334\n[SOUND]\n\n",
