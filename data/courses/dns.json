00:00:08.381\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:12.016\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:14.906\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:18.920\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and today, we've\ngot a really good subject coming at you.\n\n7\n00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.904\nWe're gonna be talking about one of the\nmost important services on the Internet\n\n8\n00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:25.233\nthat really makes us get\naround the Internet.\n\n9\n00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.216\nAnd joining me in the studios today for\nthat topic is none other than Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:28.730\nDon Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.740\nDon, how are you doing sir?\n\n12\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.272\nReady to dive right back into DNS.\n\n14\n00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:35.736\nIn this episode, we're moving on\nwith our command line utilities,\n\n15\n00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:38.076\nsome of our utilities\nthat we can use with DNS.\n\n16\n00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:40.843\nAnd in this particular episode,\nwe're gonna look at nslookup,\n\n17\n00:00:40.843 --> 00:00:44.164\nwhich is probably one of the most useful\ncommand line utilities when it comes to\n\n18\n00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:45.540\nworking with DNS.\n\n19\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.160\nAnytime you're doing\nconfiguration changes,\n\n20\n00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.790\nanytime you're putting entries in, we\nneed to be able to verify that they work.\n\n21\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.010\nYou need to be able to test to make\nsure that our names are resolving, and\n\n22\n00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.800\nthat's where nslookup comes in.\n\n23\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.010\nSo, just a real brief\nsynopsis on nslookup.\n\n24\n00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.552\nThe name stands for name server lookup.\n\n25\n00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:03.895\nJust a command line utility that we can\nreach out and it talks to DNS servers, so\n\n26\n00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:06.986\nthat we can recreate the queries that\nall of our other servers are doing in\n\n27\n00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:08.310\nthe background.\n\n28\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.630\nNice thing about nslookup, it's present\non Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS.\n\n29\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.876\nPretty much every system these\ndays has nslookup baked in.\n\n30\n00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:17.903\nAnd to be honest with you,\n\n31\n00:01:17.903 --> 00:01:21.360\nI can't remember the last time that I\nencountered a system that didn't have it.\n\n32\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.590\nThere's some of those really stripped\ndown Linux distros that might not have it\n\n33\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.360\ninstalled by default, but you can throw it\nright on there pretty easily through one\n\n34\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.990\nof the repositories and have access to it.\n\n35\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.270\nThe other nice thing about nslookup\nis the command line syntax\n\n36\n00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.890\nis pretty much identical between\nall the operating systems.\n\n37\n00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.410\nSo, if you know how to use it on Windows,\nthen, you know how to use it on a Mac.\n\n38\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.780\nAnd if you know how to use it on a Mac,\nyou know how to use it on Unix and Linux.\n\n39\n00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.490\nSo, it's all kinda tied together and\nthat makes this one really robust.\n\n40\n00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.425\nSo, that's what we're gonna take\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n41\n00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:52.062\nAll right, so, enough talking about it.\n\n42\n00:01:52.062 --> 00:01:54.550\nAll right, let's get in here and\ntake a look and see it.\n\n43\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.900\nYou know you have nslookup, well,\nit's actually pretty easy to see.\n\n44\n00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.640\nWe know we have it in pretty much\nevery operating systems out there.\n\n45\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.320\nYou can just run it and see.\n\n46\n00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.270\nIf you don't have it for some reason,\nwhich really would just be like kind of\n\n47\n00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.765\nsome Linux distributions that\nmight not have it, most of us,\n\n48\n00:02:09.765 --> 00:02:11.940\nwe should have this, no big deal, right?\n\n49\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.550\nBut if you just run it, what you should\nsee is basically what I got right here.\n\n50\n00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.030\nIt's gonna jump in and you should end up\nwith a greater than prompt like that,\n\n51\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.970\nall right?\n\n52\n00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.780\nWhat I just did is I entered what's called\nthe interactive command line for nslookup.\n\n53\n00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.070\nSo, once I'm in here, I'm technically\nstill in the nslookup utility.\n\n54\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.920\nAnd now,\nI can start running commands against it,\n\n55\n00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.570\nas many commands as I want, all right.\n\n56\n00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.320\nBut for most of us, we're not gonna\ngo with the interactive mode.\n\n57\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.379\nWe're going to stick with\nthe non-interactive mode,\n\n58\n00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.375\nwhere we run a command, it does what we\nask it to do, and then it's done, right?\n\n59\n00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:43.372\nIt just gets in, gets out,\nand in, that's it.\n\n60\n00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:45.896\nSo, let me exit out of that,\nback to my prompt.\n\n61\n00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:49.830\nAnd the non-interactive mode\nis the most straight forward.\n\n62\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.120\nIt is the one I use most of the time.\n\n63\n00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.540\nWe're just trying to do something\nlike simple name resolution.\n\n64\n00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.900\nSo, if I wanna find out what the IP\naddress of the ITProTV website is, right?\n\n65\n00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.134\nWhat I can do is I can jump in here and\nI can just say, nslookup itpro.tv.\n\n66\n00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:09.244\nAnd it's gonna reach out to that DNS\nserver and it's gonna do a lookout, okay.\n\n67\n00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:13.678\nNow, when it did the lookup, notice I\ngot this DNS request timed out, right?\n\n68\n00:03:13.678 --> 00:03:15.003\nTimeout was 2 seconds.\n\n69\n00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:16.190\nWhat does that mean?\n\n70\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.930\nWell, whatever my main DNS\nserver is wasn't answering.\n\n71\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.070\nAnd so,\nit skipped forward to the next one, right?\n\n72\n00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.784\nI can see that progression\nthat just happened and\n\n73\n00:03:25.784 --> 00:03:29.036\nit moved forward to a Google server,\nto 8.8.8.8.\n\n74\n00:03:29.036 --> 00:03:30.680\nRight, so, I hit that one and\nthat one was fine.\n\n75\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.120\nAnd then,\nI was able to resolve my address.\n\n76\n00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.160\nSo, I get some feedback about that\nquery process and what happened.\n\n77\n00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.830\nBut it's not terribly detailed, right?\n\n78\n00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.830\nIt didn't tell me what it timed out on.\n\n79\n00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.134\nSo, what was my primary DNS server?\n\n80\n00:03:45.134 --> 00:03:46.040\nI don't know.\n\n81\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.856\nIt also says here that it's\na non-authoritative answer.\n\n82\n00:03:48.856 --> 00:03:50.340\nNow, remember, with non-authoritative,\n\n83\n00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.830\nthat means the server that I asked\ndidn't actually have the answer for me.\n\n84\n00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.820\nIt had to do a recursive lookup\nagainst some other server.\n\n85\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.380\nAnd so, it reached out and talked to other\nservers and hid all that from me and\n\n86\n00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.590\ngave me this answer.\n\n87\n00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.750\nWhen we use the non-interactive mode, you\nget a really simplified output like this.\n\n88\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.580\nIf we want really detailed output\nwhere we see all the different steps,\n\n89\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.880\nthat's where the interactive\nmode comes in.\n\n90\n00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.830\nSo, that's a real simple\nlookup right there.\n\n91\n00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.810\nYou provided a domain name or a host name,\nand it gives you back an IP address.\n\n92\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.270\nThere's really only one other thing we can\ndo here from the non-interactive mode.\n\n93\n00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.400\nNotice how I get the server that\nI did a lookup against, right?\n\n94\n00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.500\nI can override that server.\n\n95\n00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.107\nI can say instead of looking\nup against 8.8.8.8, maybe,\n\n96\n00:04:33.107 --> 00:04:36.069\nI wanna lookup against 4.2.2.1, all right?\n\n97\n00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.330\nAnd when we do that,\nwe're overriding the server.\n\n98\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.820\nNow, why would we wanna do that?\n\n99\n00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.803\nWell, have you ever made\na change to a public DNS record?\n\n100\n00:04:43.803 --> 00:04:46.326\nSo, if you go on GoDaddy or\nHover or Register,\n\n101\n00:04:46.326 --> 00:04:49.262\nor whatever it is that you\npurchase your domain name.\n\n102\n00:04:49.262 --> 00:04:52.040\nYou log in to the website and\nyou make a change to an A record.\n\n103\n00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.420\nThe real message it'll say, this could\ntake up to 48 hours to take effect.\n\n104\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.630\nBut what does that mean?\n\n105\n00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.330\nIn computers, what takes 48 hours?\n\n106\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.923\nWell, your change actually takes effect\nimmediately, right the moment you do it.\n\n107\n00:05:02.923 --> 00:05:07.101\nBut people around the world will cache\nyour DNS record and they can cache it for\n\n108\n00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:08.070\nup to 48 hours.\n\n109\n00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.140\nSo, that's why they warn you about that.\n\n110\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.570\nHey, it can take up to two days for\neverybody to purge their cache and\n\n111\n00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.180\nlearn your new address.\n\n112\n00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.950\nSo, if you ever wanna see how\nfar you've propagated out,\n\n113\n00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.670\nyou might do what I just did.\n\n114\n00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.550\nDo a lookup against Google server.\n\n115\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.360\nDo a lookup against Level Three server.\n\n116\n00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.948\nDo a lookup against your ISP,\nother people's ISPs and\n\n117\n00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:27.951\nsee whether they've received the change\nalready or not, and you'd be surprised.\n\n118\n00:05:27.951 --> 00:05:31.980\nIt's a rare change that takes more than\nlike an hour to propagate out these days.\n\n119\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.360\n&gt;&gt; Don, now, when you said override,\nis that taking the interface assigned\n\n120\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.670\nDNS server and saying,\nhey we're not gonna use this.\n\n121\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.250\nWe're gonna use the IP address of\nwhat you've just put there at the end\n\n122\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.065\nof nslookup?\n\n123\n00:05:42.065 --> 00:05:43.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, on Windows,\n\n124\n00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.740\nit's whatever DNS server you have\nassigned to your network adapter.\n\n125\n00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.451\nIf you're running Mac or Linux,\n\n126\n00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:51.517\nit's whatever DNS servers\nare in your resolve.com file.\n\n127\n00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.392\nSo, that's what a stuff's defined, and\n\n128\n00:05:53.392 --> 00:05:56.130\nthat's all nslookup does is\nit looks up those things.\n\n129\n00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.950\nI guess, important thing to mention\nhere is that some operating\n\n130\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.245\nsystems have a DNS cache built in to them,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:05.844\nWindows has it, it's super annoying,\nwhere [LAUGH] Windows will do a lookup and\n\n132\n00:06:05.844 --> 00:06:07.230\nit will cache a record.\n\n133\n00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.650\nAnd then,\nwhen you go to browse that webpage again,\n\n134\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.804\nit doesn't actually go\nout to the DNS server.\n\n135\n00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.151\nIt just uses its own cache, right?\n\n136\n00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:15.185\nThis is where the whole\n40-hour thing comes in.\n\n137\n00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:17.915\nSo, if we wanna override that,\nwell, in Windows,\n\n138\n00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:19.835\nsome of you guys might be\nfamiliar with the command.\n\n139\n00:06:19.835 --> 00:06:20.735\nLet me show you.\n\n140\n00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:26.940\nIt's ipconfig /flushdns and\nthat will wipe your DNS cache, right?\n\n141\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.050\nWell, nslookup doesn't use\nthe DNS cache in Windows.\n\n142\n00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.950\nSo, it's actually bypassing that cache.\n\n143\n00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.950\nNow, the reason I bring that up is\nyou might fire up a web browser, and\n\n144\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.160\ntry and go to web page,\nand you can't get there.\n\n145\n00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.170\nAnd you drop to a command prompt and\nuse nslookup, but it show us the right IP.\n\n146\n00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.578\nAnd the problem is that Chrome,\nFirefox, Internet Explorer,\n\n147\n00:06:48.578 --> 00:06:52.832\nwhatever, might be using the DNS cache and\nNSlookup isn't.\n\n148\n00:06:52.832 --> 00:06:54.351\nAnd so, they have two different records.\n\n149\n00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:56.232\nThat's where you might have\nto flush the cache here.\n\n150\n00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:59.160\nBut nslookup does not use\nthe DNS cache on your system.\n\n151\n00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.680\n&gt;&gt; So, if you want just a quick\nanswer from a DNS server,\n\n152\n00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.000\nyou can just use nslookup, you said,\nin the non-interactive mode.\n\n153\n00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.150\nNow, you mentioned that term\ninteractive mode, you said,\n\n154\n00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.460\nthat's where the actions at.\n\n155\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.890\nTell us a little bit about that, Don.\n\n156\n00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, so,\npretty limited options here, right?\n\n157\n00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.150\nI can provide a host name or DNS name and\nI can override the server, and\n\n158\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.590\nthat's really about it.\n\n159\n00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.500\nBut if we get into the interactive mode,\nthere are a ton\n\n160\n00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.610\nof options that we can jump in there and\nstart to manipulate it and change.\n\n161\n00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.510\nSo, if I just run nslookup by itself,\nthat's gonna take me\n\n162\n00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.800\ninto that interactive prompt and\nI'll get my DNS timed out again.\n\n163\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.990\n[LAUGH] So\ni'll just switch over to the other server.\n\n164\n00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.090\nSo, anyhow, once I'm in there, now, I\ncould start to change the way things work.\n\n165\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.900\nIf you just do a question mark, you'll get\na list of all the different commands and\n\n166\n00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.570\nthings that we can put in there.\n\n167\n00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.590\nAnd right off the bat, you'll notice\nthat you can do a lookup for a name or\n\n168\n00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.180\na host name just by typing it in.\n\n169\n00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.322\nSo, I just type in whatever that name is.\n\n170\n00:07:50.322 --> 00:07:52.580\nType in ITProTV and it will resolve it.\n\n171\n00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.723\nBut then, there's all these\nset options that we can do.\n\n172\n00:07:55.723 --> 00:07:58.814\nTo override the way that\nthings are working.\n\n173\n00:07:58.814 --> 00:08:03.150\nAnd way down here we'll see where\nwe can set the server also.\n\n174\n00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.220\nSo earlier I was overriding\nthe server from the command line.\n\n175\n00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.237\nFrom here, anytime I do a look up,\nright now it's using 8.8.8.8, right?\n\n176\n00:08:11.237 --> 00:08:16.390\nSo if I do a look up for\nitpro.tv It's using 8.8.8.8.\n\n177\n00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.824\nBut if I do server 4.2.2.1, right?\n\n178\n00:08:20.824 --> 00:08:23.220\nNow it's changing my resolver.\n\n179\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.610\nI'm now changed over to 4.2.2.1,\n\n180\n00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.850\nand every look up I do from here on out,\nit's gonna do against that resolver.\n\n181\n00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.530\nSo if I look up itpro.tv.\n\n182\n00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.256\nThere we go, it ran it, and\nit ran it against 4.2.2.1 and\n\n183\n00:08:35.256 --> 00:08:36.375\nI didn't have to tell it.\n\n184\n00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:42.910\nAnd then I could jump in and say cnn.com,\nand there it goes, again off of 4.2.2.1.\n\n185\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:48.359\nIf I do a server, let's see 8.8.\n\n186\n00:08:48.359 --> 00:08:49.917\nWhat's the other one, 8.8.4.4?\n\n187\n00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:51.935\n&gt;&gt; 4.4\n&gt;&gt; That's it, the other Google one.\n\n188\n00:08:51.935 --> 00:08:53.790\nThere we are,\nI'll switch to the other Google one.\n\n189\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.681\nAnd now I can run that lookup for\nitpro.tv, and\n\n190\n00:08:56.681 --> 00:08:58.690\nthere it goes doing that lookup.\n\n191\n00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.570\nAnd it didn't make me have to\nprovide the server every time.\n\n192\n00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.970\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, with all those options,\nwho are the demographic?\n\n193\n00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:08.714\nWho would really be using this with all\nthose, all that flexibility and power?\n\n194\n00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:12.634\n&gt;&gt; All right, so an end user or\na Help Desk technician might use the basic\n\n195\n00:09:12.634 --> 00:09:17.730\nNsLookup just to test DNS resolution or\nto find out the IP of a host, all right?\n\n196\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.820\nBut beyond that,\nit's really gonna be DNS administrators.\n\n197\n00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.840\nIf you're administering a DNS server,\nNS lookup has some incredible features in\n\n198\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.064\nit that will let us\ntroubleshoot the server.\n\n199\n00:09:28.064 --> 00:09:29.420\nLet me just give you an example.\n\n200\n00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.260\nSo there are some denial of service\nattacks that can be pulled off against DNS\n\n201\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.560\nservers using TCP.\n\n202\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.170\nAnd so you might decide to block TCP and\nonly allow UDP\n\n203\n00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.800\nlookups against your server, or vice\nversa, you might want to go the other way.\n\n204\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.587\nSo maybe you configure your server to only\nanswer on UDP, or only answer on TCP.\n\n205\n00:09:45.587 --> 00:09:47.380\nHow do you test that?\n\n206\n00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.300\nWell, in NS lookup, let me just\ndo that question mark again, or\n\n207\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.950\nactually you can do,\nwell there's a few ways.\n\n208\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.559\nI'll do the question mark.\n\n209\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.010\nIf you look,\nthere's all these set OPTIONs in here.\n\n210\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.940\nAnd if you look at the set OPTIONs,\nand kinda look down at the list,\n\n211\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.750\nyou'll see where you can override\nall sorts of different things.\n\n212\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.920\nHow you do the transfer, the class, the\ntype of query, the timeout, the domain,\n\n213\n00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.300\nthe search list.\n\n214\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.400\nAnd just all sorts of really\ninteresting things here to tweak.\n\n215\n00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.520\nAnd so, you can see how you're\ntalking to that server.\n\n216\n00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.820\nOne of my favorite options\nis this debug option.\n\n217\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:24.030\nThe debug option gives you a ton of\noutput about that lookup, right?\n\n218\n00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.040\nLet me show you that in action.\n\n219\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.530\nI'm gonna do a lookup for itpro.tv.\n\n220\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.540\nVery simple, I get the server that\nI do the look up against, and\n\n221\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.030\nthen I see the host name and the IP\naddress that I got back, and that's it.\n\n222\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.552\nIt was non-authoritative so I know other\nstuff happened in the background, but\n\n223\n00:10:39.552 --> 00:10:41.060\nI don't see it, all right?\n\n224\n00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.800\nLet me just clear a little bit of this.\n\n225\n00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.447\nAnd what I'm gonna do now,\nis I'm gonna say, set debug, all right?\n\n226\n00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:49.786\nSet debug, that turns on the debug mode.\n\n227\n00:10:49.786 --> 00:10:53.137\nAnd now I'm going to get\na very verbose output.\n\n228\n00:10:53.137 --> 00:10:59.491\nWhen I do a look up for itpro.tv,\nI get a lot more information.\n\n229\n00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:01.090\nLook at all this, right?\n\n230\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.268\nI do see that I reached out\nto google server 8.8.4.4,\n\n231\n00:11:04.268 --> 00:11:06.961\nand then here's my answer that came back,\nright?\n\n232\n00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:08.240\nI got a header.\n\n233\n00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.978\nI got a query, is what I performed.\n\n234\n00:11:09.978 --> 00:11:11.630\nI got no error on the query.\n\n235\n00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.065\nSometimes you can have\na malformed query and\n\n236\n00:11:13.065 --> 00:11:15.270\nit'll show up if there\nwas an error right there.\n\n237\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.800\nI can see there was a response.\n\n238\n00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.720\nWe wanted recursion, and\nrecursion was available.\n\n239\n00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.870\nThis server didn't have the answer so\nit's gonna have to go somewhere else.\n\n240\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.415\nI see I sent one question.\n\n241\n00:11:24.415 --> 00:11:25.630\nI got one answer.\n\n242\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:30.140\nAnd I guess this is kind of off my\nscreen here, but authority record 0.\n\n243\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.835\nWe didn't have the record for it,\nwe had to go somewhere else, right?\n\n244\n00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:36.441\nAnd then,\nhere's the question that I asked, and\n\n245\n00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:40.170\nhere's the answer that I got with a ttl,\nand how long it took.\n\n246\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:45.320\nSo it's laying all that out for\nme, and kinda putting it in here.\n\n247\n00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.659\nAnd as I look at it, if you see a little\nbit here as far as like a four A record,\n\n248\n00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:49.723\nwhich should be IPv6.\n\n249\n00:11:49.723 --> 00:11:52.600\nWe actually don't have one,\nand so this came back empty.\n\n250\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.472\nBut it looks like I did IPv4,\nas well as an IPv6 look up for\n\n251\n00:11:57.472 --> 00:11:59.864\nthat host, for itpro.tv.\n\n252\n00:11:59.864 --> 00:12:02.550\nAnd that's cuz I'm on Windows,\nnot every operating system does that.\n\n253\n00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.400\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, right there in that last bit\nof output you've talked about in other\n\n254\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.910\nepisodes, about the start of authority.\n\n255\n00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:07.630\nIs that what we're seeing,\n\n256\n00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.640\nthe authoritative information for\nthis response?\n\n257\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so ITPro.TV,\nif I remember right,\n\n258\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.380\nthat domain is registered with\na registrar called Hover.com.\n\n259\n00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.030\nAnd so if I were to do a lookup\nagainst Hover's DNS servers,\n\n260\n00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.890\nthen I would get\nan authoritative response on it.\n\n261\n00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.790\nBut if I ask any other\nDNS server on the planet,\n\n262\n00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.730\nit's not gonna be authoritative, right?\n\n263\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.560\nIt's going to have to send that\nquery up through the tuple,\n\n264\n00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.398\nthe domain chain, right?\n\n265\n00:12:34.398 --> 00:12:35.890\nSo it's gotta start at a root hint server,\n\n266\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.510\nand it's gotta find the servers for\n.TV, right?\n\n267\n00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.230\nTV's a country code, so it's gotta go and\nfind that country code and\n\n268\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.600\nwho manages that.\n\n269\n00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.950\nAnd once it finds that, then it can find\nwhere the actual SOA for ITPro.tv is,\n\n270\n00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.620\nand then it can go there to get\nthe authoritative answer, and\n\n271\n00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.470\npass that back over to me.\n\n272\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.830\nSo there's gonna be at least three more\nlookups that are kind of on the back-end\n\n273\n00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.490\nof this query that I sent,\nassuming it's not cached.\n\n274\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.130\nIt could already be in the DNS cache for\nGoogle, and they'll respond.\n\n275\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.630\nThat's the advantage of\nusing Google servers,\n\n276\n00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.480\nis that they've cached\ndarn near everything.\n\n277\n00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.440\nSo you can get those\nresponses back really quick.\n\n278\n00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.220\nAll right, so that's debug.\n\n279\n00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.480\nWith the debug option we saw\na lot of good output but\n\n280\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.850\nthere are a lot of things that\nyou don't necessarily see, and\n\n281\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.630\nwe'll see other utilities later on\nthat will let us see even more.\n\n282\n00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.950\nBut there's another thing that I find\nkind of useful in the Windows world.\n\n283\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.020\nWindows, if you have a Windows\nmachine joined to a domain,\n\n284\n00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.360\nyou'll have a default suffix list.\n\n285\n00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.500\nSo when you do a search for\n\n286\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.860\na single name, it will append onto\nthe end of it what your search list is.\n\n287\n00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.465\nSo for example,\nif I have a domain called domain.net.\n\n288\n00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:42.237\nAnd I do a lookup for ITPro.tv,\n\n289\n00:13:42.237 --> 00:13:48.106\nthe lookup might actually get\nformed as ITPro.tv.domain.net.\n\n290\n00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:50.595\nIt sticks it on the end,\nwhich is kind of annoying.\n\n291\n00:13:50.595 --> 00:13:54.325\nAnd so you'll notice in my set options\nthat we can do this enabling and\n\n292\n00:13:54.325 --> 00:13:55.845\ndisabling of the search, right?\n\n293\n00:13:55.845 --> 00:13:56.955\nThat's the suffix list.\n\n294\n00:13:56.955 --> 00:13:59.175\nAnd do we wanna search this list or not?\n\n295\n00:13:59.175 --> 00:14:01.700\nDo I just wanna search for what I typed?\n\n296\n00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.235\nOr do we wanna add the search\nlist to the end, right?\n\n297\n00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:06.839\nYou can do the same thing with recursion.\n\n298\n00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:08.880\nSo maybe I don't want to do recursion.\n\n299\n00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.920\nEither this server is gonna have\nthe answer I want, or they're not.\n\n300\n00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.120\nNow by default that's on.\n\n301\n00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.320\nWe ask for recursive quarries, right?\n\n302\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.390\nSo set recurs is the default.\n\n303\n00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.920\nSo me entering that in is\ngonna have no effect, right?\n\n304\n00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:29.770\nBut if I do set norecurs, now I'm\ndisabling recursive queries, right?\n\n305\n00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:34.128\nAnd if I do a look up against Google for\nexample, my debug is still on.\n\n306\n00:14:34.128 --> 00:14:35.980\nI'm gonna do a set nodebug.\n\n307\n00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.278\nAll these set commands, to turn them on,\nyou do set and the name of the command.\n\n308\n00:14:40.278 --> 00:14:43.490\nTo turn them off you do set, and\nthen no followed by the command.\n\n309\n00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.500\nThe part I always forget,\n\n310\n00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.230\ncuz I'm from the Sysco stuff, I always\nforget to leave the space out, right?\n\n311\n00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:50.960\nIt does need to be nodebug all one word.\n\n312\n00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.550\nIf you put the space in there,\nit doesn't work.\n\n313\n00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.910\nSo I just turned that off.\n\n314\n00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:57.480\nBut if I do a lookup now for\nitpro.tv, it's gonna reach out.\n\n315\n00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.130\nAnd see how I got can't find itpro.tv,\nserver failed?\n\n316\n00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:01.981\nIt worked a minute ago.\n\n317\n00:15:01.981 --> 00:15:03.820\nWhy isn't it working now?\n\n318\n00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.990\nWell, because I turned off recursion.\n\n319\n00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.720\nIf I do a set debug.\n\n320\n00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.020\nAnd I redo that look up,\nI can look in here and\n\n321\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.638\nI can see I got a code that\nsaid server fail, all right?\n\n322\n00:15:14.638 --> 00:15:19.943\nI ask one question, I sent it there, but\nnot notice I've got, I want a response.\n\n323\n00:15:19.943 --> 00:15:24.480\nRecursion is available but\nI didn't ask for recursion.\n\n324\n00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.430\nAnd so it didn't do it, and\nas a result I didn't get the answer,\n\n325\n00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.610\nbecause I blocked it.\n\n326\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:34.800\nIf I do a set recurse and turn that\nback on, now I can do that lookup.\n\n327\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.090\nAnd it should work this time, there we go.\n\n328\n00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.910\nSo it worked, and if I scroll back,\nthere's that want recursion,\n\n329\n00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.060\nthat's the key part right\nthere that we're changing.\n\n330\n00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.660\nSo I'm manipulating the way\nthe query actually runs.\n\n331\n00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.230\nAnd that's very powerful.\n\n332\n00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.583\nBecause if you're trying to test,\nis your SOA working?\n\n333\n00:15:50.583 --> 00:15:52.219\nYou could point to the SOA server,\n\n334\n00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:55.323\nand you would wanna turn off your\nrecursion there and make sure you\n\n335\n00:15:55.323 --> 00:15:58.336\nare getting the authoritative\nanswer right from that server.\n\n336\n00:15:58.336 --> 00:16:00.925\nAll right, other things we can do here.\n\n337\n00:16:00.925 --> 00:16:02.809\nLet me turn off some of this\nstuff that I've got on.\n\n338\n00:16:02.809 --> 00:16:05.764\nSo I'm gonna do a nodebug and\nI'm gonna set recurse back on.\n\n339\n00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:11.501\nAll right, when I did my lookup for\nitvpro.tv and I had debug turned on,\n\n340\n00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:17.630\nyou saw where I asked for an a record and\na fora record, IPV4 and IPV6.\n\n341\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.610\nWhen you do a lookup, and\nwe don't have an IPv6 record for ITProTV.\n\n342\n00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.854\nSo let me pick somebody who does,\nlike Google.\n\n343\n00:16:23.854 --> 00:16:27.531\nIf I do a lookup for Google.com,\nright, I get all their addresses.\n\n344\n00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:31.660\nAnd notice here's IPv4 addresses and\nan IPv6 address.\n\n345\n00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.420\nIt looked up both.\n\n346\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.650\nBut you can manipulate that.\n\n347\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.280\nIf you look at all the set\ncommands that we can run,\n\n348\n00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.590\none of the set commands is type.\n\n349\n00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.810\nAnd there's actually an old\nformat which is Query Type.\n\n350\n00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.250\nIt's actually the same thing,\njust more typing.\n\n351\n00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.020\nSo if you type equals you\ncan tell it exactly what\n\n352\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.730\nkind of record you're looking for.\n\n353\n00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:54.890\nSo if I do a set type equals A,\nI'm only going to look for the A records.\n\n354\n00:16:54.890 --> 00:17:00.659\nAnd now when I do Google dot com I\ndon't get the IP B six record, right?\n\n355\n00:17:00.659 --> 00:17:04.735\nLikewise, I could say set type=AAAA.\n\n356\n00:17:04.735 --> 00:17:09.060\nAnd now when I query Google,\nI only get the IPv6 record, right?\n\n357\n00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.390\nNow I'll be honest with you guys,\n\n358\n00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:14.410\nI don't do this one very often\nbecause I normally want both., right?\n\n359\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.880\nBut where I use this are other records.\n\n360\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.570\nHey, I wanna find out who's\nthe authoritative DNS Server for ITProTV?\n\n361\n00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:23.490\nI don't know, right?\n\n362\n00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.192\nSo if I want to find out,\n\n363\n00:17:25.192 --> 00:17:29.203\nI can set my type to NS to show\nme the name server records.\n\n364\n00:17:29.203 --> 00:17:32.894\nAnd let me pull that up for itpro.tv.\n\n365\n00:17:32.894 --> 00:17:36.321\nAll right, so I'll punch that in itpro.tv,\nand it's going to reach out and\n\n366\n00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:38.150\nit's going to find out.\n\n367\n00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.620\nHere is the authorised DNS server\nwhere it's supposed to be and\n\n368\n00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.320\nyou'll see ours is hosted\nin the m zone web services.\n\n369\n00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.370\nSo we've got awsdns server\nlisted right there.\n\n370\n00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.010\nSo if I were to look up\nagainst one these guys,\n\n371\n00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.490\nthey could give me an authorated\nanswer for our domain, right?\n\n372\n00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:56.224\nBecause I changed that type,\nthese records aren't normally shown to me.\n\n373\n00:17:56.224 --> 00:18:01.286\nI could also do set type=MX, right?\n\n374\n00:18:01.286 --> 00:18:04.800\nI want to see the mail\nexchange records for itpro.tv.\n\n375\n00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.680\nAnd so I can punch that in.\n\n376\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.970\nAnd now I can see right there.\n\n377\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.457\nThere's the\nItpro-tv.mail.protection.outlook.com.\n\n378\n00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:12.776\nIt's in Office 365.\n\n379\n00:18:12.776 --> 00:18:17.046\nSo that's an easy way to spot who's using\nOffice 365, or Google apps for work or\n\n380\n00:18:17.046 --> 00:18:17.970\nwhatever.\n\n381\n00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.360\nI can see those mail exchanger records.\n\n382\n00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.980\nRight there, okay.\n\n383\n00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.260\nNow my favorite set type command is one\n\n384\n00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.570\nthat actually I'm not even sure\nif it's in the documentation.\n\n385\n00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:28.770\nLet's see if it shows up.\n\n386\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:33.550\nBut it's set type equals all,\nenter or any, any or\n\n387\n00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.940\nall is the same thing,\nthey get processed the same way.\n\n388\n00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.320\nBut we can punch that in.\n\n389\n00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:43.235\nAnd so if you do a set type=ALL,\nnow when I do that lookup for\n\n390\n00:18:43.235 --> 00:18:49.150\nitpro.tv it's gonna return\neverything that it can, okay?\n\n391\n00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.380\nAnd all and any, they work the same way.\n\n392\n00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.240\nSo you can punch in either one,\nI did all because that's what I'm used to,\n\n393\n00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.570\nany was in the documentation.\n\n394\n00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.280\nBut if I look,\nI'm getting the name server records.\n\n395\n00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.490\nI'm getting the MX records,\nI'm also getting text records down here.\n\n396\n00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:09.530\nWhich are really handy if you working for\nlike a sender policy framework SPF,\n\n397\n00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.700\nlike you're doing anti spam measures and\nyour DNS record.\n\n398\n00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:17.580\nYou can come and you can see those text\nrecords and see what is my SPF set to and\n\n399\n00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.530\nyou will start to see the approved\nemail servers For ITPro.TV.\n\n400\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.760\nYou can really get some\ngood data right in here.\n\n401\n00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.200\nAll just by viewing that domain.\n\n402\n00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.000\nAnd that's a pretty handy thing to see.\n\n403\n00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.800\nAll right, let's see what else do we\nhave in here that we can tinker with?\n\n404\n00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.810\nLet me show an older command.\n\n405\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.920\nThis one is not incredibly\nuseful on public DNS servers.\n\n406\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.630\nIt's the ls command.\n\n407\n00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.480\nThe ls command is the list command, and\n\n408\n00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.000\nwhat you used to be able to do back in the\nday when the Internet was very small was\n\n409\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.440\nthat you could connect to a DNS server and\nyou could say ls itpro.tv.\n\n410\n00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.960\nAnd that would say give me the listing for\nthe itpro.tv DNS server.\n\n411\n00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.910\nGive me everything you've\ngot in the DNS file format.\n\n412\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.050\nAnd it would output it on the screen in a\nfile format that you could save as a text\n\n413\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.380\nfile and load right into bind or\nWindows DNS or whatever.\n\n414\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.590\nNow you could host that zone.\n\n415\n00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.160\nWhat you're effectively doing is\nwhat's called a zone transfer, right?\n\n416\n00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.010\nA zone transfer is when we synchronize\na zone between two DNS servers.\n\n417\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.660\nThey're using the ls command.\n\n418\n00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.320\nYou used to be able to do\nsomething pretty much any domain.\n\n419\n00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.600\nNow when you do it,\nyou'll get the error restricted, right?\n\n420\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.072\nCan't list domain server failed.\n\n421\n00:20:27.072 --> 00:20:31.902\nSo, not useful on a public server, but on\na private server, in your own business if\n\n422\n00:20:31.902 --> 00:20:36.456\nyou've got Microsoft Active Directory,\nor Bind running on your own Linux and\n\n423\n00:20:36.456 --> 00:20:40.330\nUnix servers, you might want to\nconnect up and do a zone transfer.\n\n424\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.430\nConnect and download the whole\nzone file to back it up.\n\n425\n00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.600\nAnd that way if you ever lose the server\nyou've got a backup on the zone file\n\n426\n00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.370\nright here in this ls command.\n\n427\n00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.200\nAnd you can do ls for\nwhatever your domain is, right, so\n\n428\n00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.800\nmaybe you have like company.com.\n\n429\n00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.865\nAnd then you can pipe that into a file, so\n\n430\n00:20:56.865 --> 00:21:02.020\nyou might call it company.com.dns\nthat's the normal file name.\n\n431\n00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.441\nIt's just a text file,\ncall it whatever you want but\n\n432\n00:21:04.441 --> 00:21:07.522\nmost people do end them with dot-dns and\nif you're running bind or\n\n433\n00:21:07.522 --> 00:21:10.399\nWindow DNS they actually look for\na file like that for domain.\n\n434\n00:21:10.399 --> 00:21:13.415\nAnd I can dump into a file\ncopy that to a DNS server and\n\n435\n00:21:13.415 --> 00:21:17.188\nbring that zone right back up\non a new DNS server very easily.\n\n436\n00:21:17.188 --> 00:21:20.770\nAll right, so on private servers\nthat works if you are approved for\n\n437\n00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.500\ndoing zone transfers.\n\n438\n00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.340\nOn public servers, you’re not normally\napproved for doing zoned transfers.\n\n439\n00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.150\nYou at least have to be listed\nas a NS record but most of them\n\n440\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.210\nactually require you to put it into\nsome security profile on the back end.\n\n441\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.770\nSo that's neat command that's there that\n\n442\n00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:40.180\njust not you really don't see it\nreally in use all that often anymore.\n\n443\n00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.010\nBecause you've gotta be approved, right?\n\n444\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.460\nSecurity is far different in the world\nof DNS today than what it used to be.\n\n445\n00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.250\n&gt;&gt; Don, that's a lot of great information,\nin fact now I'm gonna be using that set\n\n446\n00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.810\ncommand now that I know\nit a little bit better.\n\n447\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.030\nIt does look like we're gonna wrap\nthis one up soon, but before we do,\n\n448\n00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.790\ndo you got any additional\nwords on using NS lookup?\n\n449\n00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.280\nAny tips or tricks?\n\n450\n00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.810\n&gt;&gt; There are more commands in there,\nand you probably notice like when I did\n\n451\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.400\nthe question mark there were\na handful like setting the class and\n\n452\n00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.030\nsetting route and so on.\n\n453\n00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:09.746\nThose are useful in very,\nvery few scenarios.\n\n454\n00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:10.938\nClass is pretty much useless.\n\n455\n00:22:10.938 --> 00:22:13.060\nThere's really only one class these days.\n\n456\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.540\nThe IN, or the internet class.\n\n457\n00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.777\nThe other ones are like the chaos class,\nthe class, the test class.\n\n458\n00:22:17.777 --> 00:22:19.890\nThose are all way back in\nthe early days of DNS, and\n\n459\n00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.790\nthey aren't really used anymore.\n\n460\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:26.380\nOther ones like manipulating how\nthe internet transfers work,\n\n461\n00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.730\nagain there's really only\none way in use anymore, so\n\n462\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.160\nthere's not really a reason\nto override those.\n\n463\n00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.970\nRoot can be kind of handy, if you're\noverriding the root hint servers on\n\n464\n00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.320\nthe internet, if you're not using those,\nyou can connect to any server and\n\n465\n00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.190\nuse the set root command.\n\n466\n00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.560\nTo flag it as the root and\nyou won't use root hints anymore.\n\n467\n00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.610\nEverything will go\nagainst that one server.\n\n468\n00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.730\nNot something I've ever had to use\nin production, but it is there.\n\n469\n00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.500\nSo the commands that I\ndidn't show are ones that\n\n470\n00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.820\njust we're not really gonna use that much.\n\n471\n00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.480\nThere's the search list command,\nwhere you can create\n\n472\n00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.670\na suffix search list if you want,\nright there inside of NSLookup.\n\n473\n00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.470\nWe've usually already got\nthat defined on our systems,\n\n474\n00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.050\nwe don't necessarily need it there.\n\n475\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.530\nAnd then timeouts and retries.\n\n476\n00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.380\nYou can override the timeout time and\nthe retry time.\n\n477\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.740\nThey're the amount of retries,\nand the interval of the timeout,\n\n478\n00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.770\nto use the right terminology\nto kinda manipulate those.\n\n479\n00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.960\nAgain, less common use scenario.\n\n480\n00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.576\nWhat we saw through the whole beginning of\nthis is really kinda the important meat\n\n481\n00:23:24.576 --> 00:23:25.809\nand potatoes of NS hookup.\n\n482\n00:23:25.809 --> 00:23:28.136\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, that's a wealth of\ninformation and we appreciate it.\n\n483\n00:23:28.136 --> 00:23:32.108\nWe appreciate the viewers, so we're gonna\ngo ahead and sign out here at ITProTV.\n\n484\n00:23:32.108 --> 00:23:33.619\nI've been your
