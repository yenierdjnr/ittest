00:00:19.423\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're moving into the world of\n\n4\n00:00:19.423 --> 00:00:22.611\nDreamweaver, that's right,\ncreative cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:26.450\nAnd joining me in the studios today to\nlend his expertise in this very endeavor\n\n6\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.870\nis none other than Mr. Jim Searles.\n\n7\n00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.200\nJim, how you doing today, Sir?\n\n8\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.287\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\nthank you for having me today.\n\n9\n00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:34.113\nI'd also like to thank ITProTV for\nallowing me to come in and\n\n10\n00:00:34.113 --> 00:00:38.120\ntalk about these applications that\nI love so much and that I use.\n\n11\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.590\nAnd I'd like to specifically\ntalk about Dreamweaver and\n\n12\n00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.770\nhow the tools within the application\nare intuitive enough to help you build\n\n13\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.380\na webpage from never having\ndone anything from scratch.\n\n14\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.658\n>> Very good.\nSo anytime we dive into a product or\n\n15\n00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:55.759\na technology, we typically have some\nbasics that we have to go over and Jim,\n\n16\n00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:59.949\nyou're gonna introduce us to this topic\nand show us some of the fundamental.\n\n17\n00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.560\n>> That's a very good question,\nWes, and a very good point.\n\n18\n00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.150\nWe're gonna start by talking about\nthe basics, specifically in this session.\n\n19\n00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.559\nAnd we're gonna learn\nabout the interface and\n\n20\n00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:12.640\nthen work our way on through the HTML\ncoding as well as the CSS coding.\n\n21\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.790\nSo at this point, I'd like to\ndraw attention to my screen, and\n\n22\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.550\nwe'll talk about the Welcome\nscreen within the Adobe platform.\n\n23\n00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.073\nNow, this is one of the few applications\nthat Adobe uses the Welcome screen.\n\n24\n00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:29.655\nAnd I find it to be one of the few\napplications that is extremely useful\n\n25\n00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:30.500\nto use.\n\n26\n00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.490\nThe other applications that we've used for\n\n27\n00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.460\nAdobe don't always facilitate\nthis Welcome screen, but\n\n28\n00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.710\nhere it's essential because of the fact\nthat we have the ability to create our new\n\n29\n00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.180\nfiles right here in the center and start\nfrom a template that Adobe is aware of.\n\n30\n00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.100\nSo we'll talk about the welcome screen.\n\n31\n00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.490\nWe'll talk about some preferences.\n\n32\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.360\nWe're gonna talk about the layout.\n\n33\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.040\nAnd I'm also gonna show you\nthe differences between\n\n34\n00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.420\nwhat's available on the Mac and\nwhat's available on the PC,\n\n35\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.870\nbecause those are gonna be very important\nwithin the Dreamweaver application.\n\n36\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.980\nSo when I look at the welcome\nscreen within the platform,\n\n37\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.330\nthere are three columns of information.\n\n38\n00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.900\nBasically, if you've been\nworking with files in the past,\n\n39\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.090\nyou'll see the ability to\ngo back to those files.\n\n40\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.770\nSo you've got your recent files here.\n\n41\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.500\nYou can also start from scratch and\nopen a new file.\n\n42\n00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.600\nBut here, in the center, we have\nthe ability to create from a template.\n\n43\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.340\nAnd it's gonna give you the coding\nstructure that you need based on\n\n44\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.110\nthat template.\n\n45\n00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.384\nSo we have some CSS files, HTML, PHP, XML.\n\n46\n00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:30.334\nAnd we'll talk a little bit about\nthose items later on as we get through\n\n47\n00:02:30.334 --> 00:02:31.410\nthis process.\n\n48\n00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.450\nWe also have some new fluid\ndesigns down here at the bottom.\n\n49\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.950\nAnd those designs are basically set up so\nthat way they are gonna be responsive to\n\n50\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.660\nwhatever device the person comes to your\nsite on, and that will be important.\n\n51\n00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.070\nAnd then, lastly,\nthe third column is the ability to learn\n\n52\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.220\nfrom Adobe what is the latest, greatest\nthing happening within this application.\n\n53\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.940\nSo we have some links here that will take\nyou back out to Adobe TV in some cases,\n\n54\n00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.310\nor adobe.com,\nwhich will provide you that information.\n\n55\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.910\nSo what I'd like to do right now, however,\nis I'd like to start you from scratch.\n\n56\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.300\nWe're just gonna click on this HTML link\nand we'll create a document from scratch.\n\n57\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.348\nSo you can see what that looks like.\n\n58\n00:03:11.348 --> 00:03:14.460\nAnd at this point, I have to choose\nwhat type of document, whether or\n\n59\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.460\nnot I'm gonna use a template or a site\ntemplate, so I'm moving this around.\n\n60\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.060\nAnd I'm going to choose in this\nexample here from the top,\n\n61\n00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.000\nagain, html, and then I get some options.\n\n62\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.660\nIf ever I select a different option here,\n\n63\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.720\nthe document type, it will change what\noptions are available here in the center.\n\n64\n00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.150\nSo I'm gonna choose html as an option.\n\n65\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.940\nAnd then, from here I get to choose.\n\n66\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.520\nAm I going to use a HTML 5 or\na previous version of the HTML standard.\n\n67\n00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.160\nSo we recently ratified\nthe World Wide Web Consortium,\n\n68\n00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.440\nrecently ratified the HTML 5 standard.\n\n69\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.712\nAnd previous to that we were using\nthe 4.01 transitional with XHTML\n\n70\n00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:56.470\navailable as well.\n\n71\n00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.270\nBut now we've moved on to HTML 5 and\nyou're gonna see there are a lot of\n\n72\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.250\nintuitive media ideas\nthat have come from that.\n\n73\n00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.640\nSo this is really good.\n\n74\n00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.850\nNow, I can assign a document\ntitle right here at the start and\n\n75\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.370\nI can call it My sample site,\nif I want to.\n\n76\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.700\nAnd that'll give me the opportunity to\nstart building from that start place.\n\n77\n00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.609\nI can also attach a cascading style sheets\nto the file when I start working in this.\n\n78\n00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.453\nBut I'm not ready to do that yet and\n\n79\n00:04:23.453 --> 00:04:27.290\nI'll talk about that a little bit\nlater as we get moved forward on this.\n\n80\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.887\nWe also have the bootstrap option, like I\nsaid you can design responsive designs and\n\n81\n00:04:31.887 --> 00:04:36.291\nattach your style sheets for that right\naway but we'll get more into that a little\n\n82\n00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:39.034\nbit later on so for now,\nI'm ready to hit Create.\n\n83\n00:04:39.034 --> 00:04:42.281\nNow, that I've gone through that process,\n\n84\n00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:45.970\nI wanna show you real quick,\nI apologize for this.\n\n85\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.971\nI have the ability to go\nout to the Internet and\n\n86\n00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:51.340\nI wanna make sure that this is\nable to go out to the Internet.\n\n87\n00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.310\nSo here's the interface\nthat we're working in.\n\n88\n00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.840\nAnd here is basically the foundation for\neverything you're going to need.\n\n89\n00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.650\nWe're gonna talk about these basic\nstructures where we have the design\n\n90\n00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.680\nview and the code view, and\nthen we have panels left and right.\n\n91\n00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.370\nBut before I do that, I wanna jump over\nto the PC side and talk about that.\n\n92\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.880\nSo here we are in the PC environment, and\nagain I'm going to start from scratch\n\n93\n00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.950\nhere, so I'm gonna go up to File and\nI'm gonna choose New.\n\n94\n00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.360\nSo we're gonna get the same dialog box\nthat we have in the PC that we had on\n\n95\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.200\nthe Mac side, and I have the same\noptions that are available to me.\n\n96\n00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.850\nI'm gonna choose another HTML file.\n\n97\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.740\nI'm gonna do the same thing here.\n\n98\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.270\nI'm gonna call it My sample site.\n\n99\n00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:31.312\nIf I can spell.\n\n100\n00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.020\n>> Now, Jim, on the Windows side here,\nwhen we make selections are these panels\n\n101\n00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.050\ncontextually sensitive like\nwe see on the Mac, as well?\n\n102\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.830\n>> That's correct.\n\n103\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.160\nAs you select content within your website\nyou're gonna find that everything changes,\n\n104\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.260\ndepending on what's been selected,\nso they are contextual.\n\n105\n00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.421\nThat's good.\n\n106\n00:05:50.421 --> 00:05:53.630\nSo we've given the title to the document.\n\n107\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.876\nAnd we're gonna select the HTML 5 again.\n\n108\n00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:57.770\nAnd again,\nwe're gonna use the same options.\n\n109\n00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.450\nWe're not gonna choose\nthe bootstrap at this time.\n\n110\n00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.890\nSo I'm gonna click Create.\n\n111\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.440\nAnd what you're gonna see now,\n\n112\n00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.428\nis that it's going to come up\nwith the same content sections,\n\n113\n00:06:07.428 --> 00:06:11.410\nin this case it went into live mode and\nsome other things, we'll talk about that.\n\n114\n00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.238\nI'm gonna be switching between the Mac\nversion and the PC version just so\n\n115\n00:06:15.238 --> 00:06:19.079\nwe can see what the differences\nare because it's gonna be very glaring.\n\n116\n00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:21.441\nSo at this point,\nI've got a document ready to go and\n\n117\n00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:24.882\nyou can see right away there are some\ndifferences within the application and\n\n118\n00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:27.051\nthat's really what I wanna talk about for\nnow.\n\n119\n00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:29.894\nThe first thing I'd like\nto bring your attention to,\n\n120\n00:06:29.894 --> 00:06:34.140\nis that the file menu here, across\nthe top, is separate from the application.\n\n121\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.670\nSo if I move this down, you can see\nit is separate from the application.\n\n122\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.440\nAnd so, because of that it might give you\na little bit of a separation anxiety,\n\n123\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.570\nkinda thing.\n\n124\n00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.280\nOn the PC side, however, everything\nis contained within one application,\n\n125\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.670\nthe menu bar, everything is all together.\n\n126\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.270\nSo nothing is separated.\n\n127\n00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.850\nSo that's one part I wanna talk about.\n\n128\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:00.240\nWhen I go to work with preferences or\nI work with changing some settings\n\n129\n00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.620\nwithin the background behind the machine,\nin order to go to preferences on a Mac,\n\n130\n00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.610\nI go over here to the Dreamweaver menu and\nI choose Preferences.\n\n131\n00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.930\nSo this is unique to the Mac,\n\n132\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.230\nthe preferences that is available\nis unique to the Mac this way.\n\n133\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.872\nBut if I go back to the PC, preferences\nare always located under the Edit menu.\n\n134\n00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:22.860\nSo I'm gonna go over here and click on\nEdit in the menu bar and then pull down.\n\n135\n00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.300\nAnd then,\nI have to go all the way to the bottom and\n\n136\n00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.690\nyou'll see this little triangle.\n\n137\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.320\nI'll click on it until\nI see the last item.\n\n138\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.690\nAnd the last item is my preferences list.\n\n139\n00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.324\nNow, the preferences\nare the same beyond that.\n\n140\n00:07:33.324 --> 00:07:35.720\nBut getting there is what's different.\n\n141\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.181\nSo that helps out a lot.\n\n142\n00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:39.540\nLet me close out of this.\n\n143\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.440\nAnd there's one other\nitem I wanna talk about.\n\n144\n00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.376\nIn case you're coming from a previous\nversion of the Dreamweaver application,\n\n145\n00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:49.207\nmaybe Creative Suite 6 or\nCreative Suite 5,\n\n146\n00:07:49.207 --> 00:07:52.039\nthe view on the Mac was\na little bit different,\n\n147\n00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:56.918\nin the sense that I would go to Window and\nI could choose application frame here.\n\n148\n00:07:56.918 --> 00:08:00.499\nSo what happens is,\nall of the panels now are floating and\n\n149\n00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:04.909\nthey can be manipulated and\nmoved Moved independently of each other.\n\n150\n00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:09.660\nNow this was unique to the Mac, did not\nhave this flexibility on the PC side.\n\n151\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.510\nSo there is no applications\nframe that's available.\n\n152\n00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.370\nAnd if I want to reset everything back,\nI go back up to Window and\n\n153\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.520\nI choose Application Frame,\nI check that, and it should flow back.\n\n154\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.730\nNow you'll note here that this\npanel is not flowing back to\n\n155\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.660\nthis part on the right, and\nI'm gonna to dock it just for a moment.\n\n156\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.360\nSo let's dock back.\n\n157\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.020\nIf I go here back to the PC side, and\n\n158\n00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.850\nI click on window,\nthere is no application painting option.\n\n159\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.100\nSo this is one of the major\ndifferences within\n\n160\n00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.260\nthe Windows version in\ncomparison to the Mac version.\n\n161\n00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.110\nNow, I live in the Mac world, so\nI spent a lot of time on the Mac version.\n\n162\n00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.920\nBut I'd like to work with\nthe configuration and I'll configure on\n\n163\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.290\nboth sides so that you can see\nthere's flexibility across both apps.\n\n164\n00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.910\nSo there's not too much\nof a difference there.\n\n165\n00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:02.000\nBut I will spend most of my time\nbuilding a webpage on the Mac version.\n\n166\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:08.410\nSo, to start, we talk about\nthe menu bar here across the top.\n\n167\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.820\nSo, we talked about the menu bar and\n\n168\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.470\nthe fact that it's separate\nfrom the application, but\n\n169\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.100\nbelow that it's called\nthe application bar.\n\n170\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.500\nSo on the Mac there's\nnot a lot going on here.\n\n171\n00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.710\nThe application bar is this section\nright here with those default, and\n\n172\n00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:27.740\nthen I can synchronize between my Creative\nCloud services and the Adobe Application.\n\n173\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.860\nWhen I go back to the PC side,\nokay, here's my menu bar.\n\n174\n00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.090\nBut all the way to the right\nis the Application bar, so\n\n175\n00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.490\nbasically it's all connected into one,\nokay?\n\n176\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.880\nAnd I still have the ability to chose\na workspace and change that up, and\n\n177\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.200\nI have the ability to sync.\n\n178\n00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.460\nAnd you can see right now it's\ngot a little exclamation point,\n\n179\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.600\nwhich means that I haven't synchronized\nin this particular application.\n\n180\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.300\nNow, where it says default,\nI call that a work space\n\n181\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.300\nbecause you might be sharing your computer\nwith other people, or you might want to\n\n182\n00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.629\nchange the work space depending on what\nyour work flow is going to be like.\n\n183\n00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:02.860\nAnd I will tell you,\n\n184\n00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:07.370\nI like to change my environment to\nsuit the workflow that I enjoy.\n\n185\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.620\nAnd I've enjoyed all the way back to CS5.\n\n186\n00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.900\nSo, what you're gonna see me do today is\nto learn how to manipulate the panels.\n\n187\n00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:20.120\nBut at the same The same time I'm going\nto teach you the workflow that I use.\n\n188\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.070\nSo we are using the default workspace and\n\n189\n00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.520\nbasically configures all\nthe panels over here on the right.\n\n190\n00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.120\nAnd in this case I can see split view\nbetween my design and my code, okay.\n\n191\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.600\nWhat I'd like to do is I would like\nto move some of these panels around.\n\n192\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.450\nSo for example I have the files\npanel over here and there's a tab.\n\n193\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:42.490\nI'm gonna click on this tab and\nI'm gonna left click and drag down\n\n194\n00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:48.110\nuntil I dock it in here with the document\nargent model and the assets panel.\n\n195\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.930\nAnd what I'm looking for\n\n196\n00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.770\nhere is a blue highlight that\ncomes around the entire box.\n\n197\n00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.070\nOnce that blue highlight is there,\nit shows me that I'm ready to put this in\n\n198\n00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.680\nthe same space as the rest\nof the tabs that are there.\n\n199\n00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.790\nSo when I let go,\nit should dock that information together.\n\n200\n00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.330\nSo there it is.\n\n201\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.540\nSo there's the DOM, there's the ASF panel,\nand then there's the files panel.\n\n202\n00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.570\nNow, I do like the files panel\nto be by predominant items,\n\n203\n00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.700\nso I'm going to move\nfiles here to the left.\n\n204\n00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.350\nAnd so now it's Files, DOM, Assets.\n\n205\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.120\nSo you can rearrange the tabs\nwithin that group as well.\n\n206\n00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.680\nSo you're not trapped with that.\n\n207\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.280\nNow I maximize this by double-clicking,\nso I can double-click, for example,\n\n208\n00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.250\nCC Libraries and expand that back down.\n\n209\n00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.640\nAnd here it is.\n\n210\n00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.580\nNow Insert Insert is one that I like\nto move above my untitled document.\n\n211\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.890\nI'm currently working untitled document,\nbecause that's what I created earlier.\n\n212\n00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.300\nI'd like to move that above there.\n\n213\n00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.880\nSo I'm gonna pull that out, make it float,\nthis is known as a floating panel.\n\n214\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.540\nYou can see all the options that are\navailable now I'm going to grab this dark\n\n215\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.760\nbar, and I'm going to pull it to\nthe top until I see a blue highlight.\n\n216\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.690\nThat blue highlight tells me that that's\nwhere I'm going to put this new panel.\n\n217\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:59.520\nAnd when I release, I now have the\ninsertion panel up here at the top, okay?\n\n218\n00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.420\nSo I have all the options\nthat are available to me.\n\n219\n00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.359\nAnd this is the HTML section,\nwhich lets me add HTML content.\n\n220\n00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.780\nSo at this point, I have the Files\npanel with my document object model and\n\n221\n00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.890\nmy assets.\n\n222\n00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.520\nI have the insert panel here at the top.\n\n223\n00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.230\nAnd there's one more panel that\nI would like to configure and\n\n224\n00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.090\nplace down at the bottom.\n\n225\n00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.410\nAnd that's the Properties panel.\n\n226\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.930\nThe Properties panel is\ncurrently not available.\n\n227\n00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.220\nBut whenever you see that\nthere's a panel missing,\n\n228\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.770\nyou can always bring a panel back\nout by going to the Window menu.\n\n229\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.430\nSo I'm gonna go up here to\nthe Window menu bar, choose that and\n\n230\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.740\nin the list notice properties is\nnot checked but insert is checked,\n\n231\n00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.730\nfiles is checked and\napplications framed is checked.\n\n232\n00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.140\nSo those are the active items right now.\n\n233\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.300\nSo I'm gonna check properties and\n\n234\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:47.040\nit will appear as a floating panel and I'm\ngonna dock it right here at the bottom, so\n\n235\n00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.370\nthat way I have the ability to\naccess that whenever I need to.\n\n236\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.560\nNow, it does take up real estate for\nthe work I need to do.\n\n237\n00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.260\nBut again, if don't want to\nfocus on the split view here,\n\n238\n00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.300\nI can say just show me the design or\njust show me the code.\n\n239\n00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.950\nSo I have the flexibility\nto change that as well.\n\n240\n00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.570\nOkay, so at this point I've rearranged my\n\n241\n00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.940\npanels the way I like them and\nthe way that the work flow works for me.\n\n242\n00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:16.750\nSo I'm going to now save that as preset\nthat I can use over and over again.\n\n243\n00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.300\n>> Jim, with these customizations, is this\nsomething that pretty much anybody can do?\n\n244\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.290\nNot really a one size fits all but\nhow you want your workspace,\n\n245\n00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.800\nwhat makes you productive.\n\n246\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.630\nYou can configure it that way,\nand you can save it.\n\n247\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.080\nI can only imagine you could load\nit back up after the fact as well.\n\n248\n00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.150\n>> That is a very good question, Wes, and\n\n249\n00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.570\nI've had students ask me that\nsame question every time.\n\n250\n00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.290\nThey say hey, can you give me that\norientation that you did before?\n\n251\n00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.420\nAnd I always come back to the point that\nthey can configure it in whatever way\n\n252\n00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.020\nthey want.\n\n253\n00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.870\nIt's complete flexibility.\n\n254\n00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.790\nOnce you save it inside of the workspace,\n\n255\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.040\nyou will have access to use\nthat same workspace every time.\n\n256\n00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.070\nYou can switch between workspaces, but\n\n257\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.300\nyou can always come back to\nthe one that you've saved.\n\n258\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.070\nSo that's a very good question and\nwe're gonna do that now.\n\n259\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.800\nSo if we go back to my workspace here and\nI go to where it says default.\n\n260\n00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.370\nThere's a little pull down.\n\n261\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.470\nIf I click on that pull-down,\n\n262\n00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.990\nyou'll see that there's some items that\nhave already been built for us by Adobe.\n\n263\n00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.650\nSo we have Beginner, Code,\nDesign, and Abstract.\n\n264\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.020\nSo for example if I click on Beginner,\n\n265\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.420\nthis would give me sort\nof a beginner layout.\n\n266\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.310\nOkay, and it will rearrange things.\n\n267\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.820\nNow I should have saved before I did this\nbecause now I'm going to have to reset,\n\n268\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.400\nbut at this point in time it's\nrearranged all my panels.\n\n269\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.230\nI did leave the properties panel\ndown here, which is great, but\n\n270\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.170\nit moved insert and\nfiles down here to the top.\n\n271\n00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.390\nIf I go back to code view, for example,\nnow the emphasis is going to be on writing\n\n272\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.060\ncode, and because of that it puts it\nright there on the right-hand side, and\n\n273\n00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.310\nnow your panels are relegated to\nthe left of the application, okay.\n\n274\n00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.190\nSo again, just a different workflow\nthat you might have within\n\n275\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.800\nyour environment that you wanna use.\n\n276\n00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.230\nIf I chose design for example,\nnow design is going to be the focus, so\n\n277\n00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.410\nnow we come out with our CSS designer,\nor our cascading style sheets designer.\n\n278\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.590\nNow code is still available but\nI can switch it over to design here and\n\n279\n00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.930\nI can focus on that.\n\n280\n00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.630\nSo these are options that\nare available for us and\n\n281\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.840\nthese are presets that\nAdobe has created for us.\n\n282\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.150\nSo what I'd like to do again is I'm\ngonna reset it back to the default.\n\n283\n00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.350\nNow it should remember how\nI configured the default.\n\n284\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.220\nSo Wes, this is important.\n\n285\n00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.820\nLook at how everything that I had before,\nremember I told you I forgot to save and\n\n286\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.660\nthat could be a problem?\n\n287\n00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.240\n>> That's right.\n>> Not an issue.\n\n288\n00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.750\nIt remembered it for\nthe default workspace,\n\n289\n00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.340\nit kept everything exactly\nthe way I had it set up.\n\n290\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.760\nNow granted, I might want to,\nat some point,\n\n291\n00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.070\nTo reset the default work space so that\nway it starts from the beginning again.\n\n292\n00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.240\nSo I'm gonna need to save this work\nspace the way it is in order for\n\n293\n00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.450\nme to have that layout\nconfigured that way.\n\n294\n00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.810\nSo I'm gonna go up here to default and\nI'm gonna say new work space.\n\n295\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.530\nSo I'm gonna click new work space.\n\n296\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.867\nAnd I wanna call James Playground, okay.\n\n297\n00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.523\nSo James Playground when I click OK.\n\n298\n00:15:53.523 --> 00:15:57.244\nNow those settings are specific\nto that work space.\n\n299\n00:15:57.244 --> 00:15:59.904\nWhen I load Dreamweaver moving forward,\n\n300\n00:15:59.904 --> 00:16:04.850\nit will always have this configuration,\nuntil I make a change at some point.\n\n301\n00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.560\nAnd remember,\nthe changes are saved immediately.\n\n302\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.180\nIf I want to, I could go back to Default\nand now I can say Reset Default.\n\n303\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.384\nSo if I come over here and\nI say Reset Default,\n\n304\n00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:18.690\nit will literally configure it back\nto the way it was at the beginning\n\n305\n00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.966\nwhere the Insert panel\nis no longer at the top.\n\n306\n00:16:20.966 --> 00:16:24.460\nThe Properties panel is no longer\nat the bottom, and all my files and\n\n307\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.720\ninserts here are in the same\ngrouping on the upper left corner.\n\n308\n00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.220\nSo I want to go back Jim's Playground,\nit's right here at the top,\n\n309\n00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.300\nI click on it, and I'm configured\nback to the result I had before.\n\n310\n00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.280\nSo it will remember if I close\nout of Dreamweaver, reload it,\n\n311\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.495\nit will remember that Jim's Playground\nis a configuration that I've got set and\n\n312\n00:16:42.495 --> 00:16:44.300\nit'll revert me back to this.\n\n313\n00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.428\nSo I will always have access to my tools,\nexactly this way.\n\n314\n00:16:47.428 --> 00:16:52.050\n>> Now, Jim, with the individual panels,\nis there any way that we can resize them,\n\n315\n00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.910\ncan we minimize them,\nif we decide that we want them but\n\n316\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.040\nmaybe we don't currently\nwant them in our workspace?\n\n317\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.990\n>> That's a very good question and\nthat's absolutely correct.\n\n318\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.340\nSo for example here,\nthe CC Libraries panel.\n\n319\n00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.510\nCC Libraries I might use later on.\n\n320\n00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.250\nIt's Creative Cloud Libraries.\n\n321\n00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.330\nBasically, what we're doing\nwith the CC Libraries,\n\n322\n00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:13.300\nCreative Cloud, we're connecting to the\ncloud services provided to you by Adobe.\n\n323\n00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.440\nWhen you purchase the software,\n\n324\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.660\nyou also get, I think it's 5 to 20\ngigabytes of storage space in the cloud.\n\n325\n00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.270\nAnd you can add your assets to the cloud\nservices but you also get things back.\n\n326\n00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.560\nYou get fonts that you can use,\nthere's a font kit available, and\n\n327\n00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.690\nthen there's some assets\nthat they provide you.\n\n328\n00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.927\nSo if there are any assets that\nyou have saved for yourself,\n\n329\n00:17:31.927 --> 00:17:35.080\nthey'll be listed here, so it'll\nconnect to the Internet and find that.\n\n330\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.870\nWell, I'm not using it right now,\nso I might wanna move that out.\n\n331\n00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.443\nSo if I grab the tab CC Libraries,\nI can pull that out and\n\n332\n00:17:41.443 --> 00:17:43.167\nmake it a floating panel.\n\n333\n00:17:43.167 --> 00:17:47.451\nOr if I'd prefer, I can come over here\nto the Panel Options Menu in the upper\n\n334\n00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:51.940\nright corner, I can select that and\nI can tell it to Close that item.\n\n335\n00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.121\nOkay, so\nif I close that item it goes away.\n\n336\n00:17:54.121 --> 00:17:58.007\nNow, don't fret because you can\nalways go back to the Window menu and\n\n337\n00:17:58.007 --> 00:17:59.890\nyou can bring it back at any time.\n\n338\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:04.551\nSo any items that you have that you might\nwanna bring back, you can just click on.\n\n339\n00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:07.190\nSo CC Libraries is right here\nin the middle of the list.\n\n340\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.420\nIf I click on it, it will bring it\nback and there we go, it's loading.\n\n341\n00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.560\nThe surf ball of doom.\n\n342\n00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.197\n>> Gotta love the floating pinwheel.\n\n343\n00:18:17.197 --> 00:18:18.185\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n344\n00:18:18.185 --> 00:18:18.915\n>> That's correct.\n\n345\n00:18:18.915 --> 00:18:20.755\nAnd there it is,\nfloating back in the center.\n\n346\n00:18:20.755 --> 00:18:22.245\nAnd the reason why it's taking a while,\n\n347\n00:18:22.245 --> 00:18:24.755\nbecause its trying to connect\nto the Internet to find\n\n348\n00:18:24.755 --> 00:18:26.695\nthe CC Libraries that I\nmight have available to me.\n\n349\n00:18:26.695 --> 00:18:29.295\nSo it actually did a refresh there,\nso that's good.\n\n350\n00:18:29.295 --> 00:18:32.831\nBut I did wanna close that out, so I can\nalso click the X here in the upper left\n\n351\n00:18:32.831 --> 00:18:35.772\ncorner and close it out just like\nyou would close out a window.\n\n352\n00:18:35.772 --> 00:18:40.270\nOkay, so at this point I have\nCC Designer and Snippets.\n\n353\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.430\nI have no problem with Snippets and\nI have no problem with CC Designer.\n\n354\n00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.530\nAs a matter of fact Snippets has some code\nthat you can grab that has been written by\n\n355\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.920\nAdobe and you can write code yourself and\nreuse it over and over again.\n\n356\n00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.440\nBut the CC Designer is\none of those that if you\n\n357\n00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.660\nresize this panel here on the right\nit will give you more options.\n\n358\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.279\nSo, for example, notice I have Sources,\nMedia, Selectors, Properties.\n\n359\n00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:07.031\nOkay, if I resize this by coming over here\nand seeing the double arrows like you\n\n360\n00:19:07.031 --> 00:19:11.063\ndo to resize anything, if I resize\nthis by dragging it to the left,\n\n361\n00:19:11.063 --> 00:19:16.110\nyou're gonna see that Properties\nshould eventually jump to the right.\n\n362\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.870\nSo, resizing in this example,\nis very useful,\n\n363\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.270\nbecause you can actually\ngain more workflow.\n\n364\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.740\nIt's a better workflow to work with\nyour properties in a second column,\n\n365\n00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.240\nthan it is to be underneath Selectors,\nbecause now\n\n366\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.890\nI can see what properties I might want to\nassign to the items that I'm working with.\n\n367\n00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.590\nSo that's a really good question.\n\n368\n00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.820\nNow, I can minimize this.\n\n369\n00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.260\nI can make it so it's not even showing.\n\n370\n00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.050\nMaybe I wanna focus on my code,\nor I wanna focus on the design.\n\n371\n00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:46.350\nSo I can come over here in the upper\nright-hand corner of these panels and\n\n372\n00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.300\nhit these double chevrons, okay?\n\n373\n00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.570\nSo these double arrows, I hit that,\nit will collapse it down.\n\n374\n00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.170\nAnd I didn't click on it,\nI clicked on the Menu, here it is.\n\n375\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.700\nCollapse to icons.\n\n376\n00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.410\nSo here I've got it so\nit's got the text and icons.\n\n377\n00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.936\nAnd with the text and icons I can\ntell what those icons represent.\n\n378\n00:20:01.936 --> 00:20:04.395\nBut I can even drag it\nfurther to the right and\n\n379\n00:20:04.395 --> 00:20:07.700\nmake it even smaller to\nwhere it's just the icons.\n\n380\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.180\nIf I'm familiar enough to know\nwhat those icons represent\n\n381\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.540\nthen I don't need the text\nto tell me what it is.\n\n382\n00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.070\nAnd so we have that flexibility.\n\n383\n00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:19.850\nNow you can see I have a lot of room\nin this area here to write code and\n\n384\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.560\nalso to see my design and\nsee how things are working out.\n\n385\n00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:31.230\nNow, when I do collapse it down, however,\nI click on the item and it expands out.\n\n386\n00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.820\nBut that's temporary, right?\n\n387\n00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.890\nCuz I can click back on the double\nchevrons and collapse it down again.\n\n388\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.600\nSo I can configure this\nby resizing the panels,\n\n389\n00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:46.110\nmaking them smaller or larger,\nand I can actually benefit\n\n390\n00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:50.320\nby resizing because I could get\nmore of my design or coding space.\n\n391\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.800\nOr, I can get more information\nwithin the panel itself.\n\n392\n00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.630\nAnd that's really important.\n\n393\n00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.110\nSo good question.\n\n394\n00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.300\nI am gonna expand this out.\n\n395\n00:20:59.300 --> 00:20:59.810\nOr, guess what?\n\n396\n00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.530\nI'm gonna go back here and\ntell it to reset Jim's Playground.\n\n397\n00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.840\nAnd that should expand it back out for\nme and make it the size it was before.\n\n398\n00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.717\n>> Now, Jim, that seems like somebody\nlike me that maybe is new to Dreamweaver,\n\n399\n00:21:10.717 --> 00:21:13.948\nthat if [LAUGH] I get in there and\nI configure things, completely,\n\n400\n00:21:13.948 --> 00:21:15.860\njust completely hose the workspace.\n\n401\n00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.050\nAnd I'm like,\nI don't really have much workspace.\n\n402\n00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.500\nI've got work, but no more space.\n\n403\n00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.730\nI can reset things, right?\n\n404\n00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.411\n>> Absolutely,\nI have heard of that many times.\n\n405\n00:21:23.411 --> 00:21:27.150\nI have so many panels open and\nI can't see what I'm trying to do.\n\n406\n00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:27.823\nWhat can I do?\n\n407\n00:21:27.823 --> 00:21:31.048\nYou just go back and you reset\nthe workspace back to what it was, and\n\n408\n00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:32.800\nthe panels that you had open.\n\n409\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.780\nBecause you can open as many\npanels as are available here and\n\n410\n00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.010\nyou can get it to become so\nbusy that you can't see\n\n411\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.430\nanything that you're doing anymore and\nthat might cause problems.\n\n412\n00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.860\nI mean, even some of these panels\nhave sub-panels within them.\n\n413\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.360\nSo there's so many panels going on.\n\n414\n00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.280\nAnd you might have moved these around.\n\n415\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.200\nAnd so\nyou could see what's going on in there.\n\n416\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.110\nBut at any time you can hit that Reset and\nit'll solve the problem.\n\n417\n00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.000\nYou're absolutely right,\nso good point there.\n\n418\n00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.770\nOkay, fantastic.\n\n419\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.990\nNow, with that said,\nI'd like to go over to the PC side,\n\n420\n00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.840\nand I'd like to show you the same thing.\n\n421\n00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.126\nSo if I go back to my PC side here.\n\n422\n00:22:09.126 --> 00:22:12.533\nGoodness, Windows Users Parallels is\ntrying to update and activate, okay.\n\n423\n00:22:12.533 --> 00:22:18.570\nOkay, so I have the same\nconfiguration here, I'm on Default.\n\n424\n00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.660\nThere is no Jim's workspace, right,\n\n425\n00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.030\nbecause I'm working on\na different platform.\n\n426\n00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.870\nBut I still have the presets\nthat Adobe has created for\n\n427\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.600\nme and Default is here as well.\n\n428\n00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.578\nSo if I wanted to, I could start moving my\npanels over again very quickly here and\n\n429\n00:22:33.578 --> 00:22:39.215\nreposition them where I like them to be,\nin the configuration that I like.\n\n430\n00:22:39.215 --> 00:22:45.175\nAnd that should provide me\na view of what I'm trying to do.\n\n431\n00:22:45.175 --> 00:22:46.273\nOkay, sorry.\n\n432\n00:22:46.273 --> 00:22:50.940\nI'm gonna go to here, there we go, okay.\n\n433\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.460\nAnd I guess Assets was also down here.\n\n434\n00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.192\nOkay, so we have all of these items.\n\n435\n00:22:58.638 --> 00:23:03.750\nOkay, and at this point,\nI have the setup the way that I want.\n\n436\n00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.290\nOne more item, Properties panel.\n\n437\n00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.180\nAnd I'm gonna dock it down at the bottom.\n\n438\n00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.730\nI will save it and then we'll be done.\n\n439\n00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.120\nSo let me just finish that up here.\n\n440\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.852\nOr maybe not dock it at the bottom.\n\n441\n00:23:18.914 --> 00:23:20.390\nOkay, that's interesting.\n\n442\n00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.030\nThere, no, that's gonna dock there.\n\n443\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.780\nThere it is.\nOkay, there we go.\n\n444\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.995\nCome over here, save it.\n\n445\n00:23:35.492 --> 00:23:37.190\nAnd there we are.\n\n446\n00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.440\nSo, similar configuration.\n\n447\n00:23:40.742 --> 00:23:43.600\nAnd there's my code, just like before,\nand we're good to go.\n\n448\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.110\n>> And\nI can see where that would come in handy,\n\n449\n00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.150\nJim, if you're moving between\ntwo different platforms.\n\n450\n00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.000\nMaybe you got a work computer that's\ngot Windows but you come home,\n\n451\n00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.780\nmaybe you're using your Mac at home.\n\n452\n00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:57.137\nWhere you can kinda have some consistency,\nif it will be, in the user interface,\n\n453\n00:23:57.137 --> 00:23:59.220\nuser experience, right?\n\n454\n00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.990\n>> That's absolutely correct, the point of\na workspace is to have that consistency so\n\n455\n00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.570\ntheres familiarity with\nwhere things are located and\n\n456\n00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.310\nyou'll be able to find it much easier.\n\n457\n00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.925\nThis is a workflow that I've used since I\nstarted using Dreamweaver back in 1997,\n\n458\n00:24:13.925 --> 00:24:18.345\nbecause that's how the arrangement was,\nthe Insert panel was always on the top and\n\n459\n00:24:18.345 --> 00:24:20.579\nthe Properties was always at the bottom.\n\n460\n00:24:20.579 --> 00:24:25.427\nSo a lot of these are happening\nbecause of the fact that I'm just so\n\n461\n00:24:25.427 --> 00:24:29.680\nused to it it's become routine for\nme, and I enjoy that.\n\n462\n00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.900\nBut you're absolutely right.\n\n463\n00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.220\nIf you move from one\nworkstation to another,\n\n464\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.310\nthe workspace will give you that\nconsistency and it'll help you out.\n\n465\n00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.690\nGood questions.\n\n466\n00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.720\nOkay, fantastic.\n\n467\n00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.490\nSo we've got the workspace,\nwe can move our panels around,\n\n468\n00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.310\nwe can make them float,\nwe can close them down individually.\n\n469\n00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.260\nAnd we can save the workspace so\nthat way we can use it in the future and\n\n470\n00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:56.810\nyou can make it so that way, you have\nthis reusable space for you every time.\n\n471\n00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.430\n>> All right, thank you, Jim,\nfor a good introduction there.\n\n472\n00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.860\nBut it does look like we're gonna come\nto the end of another episode here, but\n\n473\n00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.350\nbefore we do that,\ndo you have other additional words?\n\n474\n00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.440\n>> Yeah, the point of\ndiscussion is that I would like\n\n475\n00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.380\nto say that if you feel comfortable in\nthe environment that you're working with,\n\n476\n00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.840\nthese tools will really help benefit you,\nand configuring your workspace,\n\n477\n00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.230\nconfiguring the layout of everything,\nis really basically for comfort.\n\n478\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.010\n>> And it's basically to provide you,\n\n479\n00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:28.600\nthe user, a space that you're gonna\nwanna work in and always come back to.\n\n480\n00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.370\n>> All right, well, Jim,\nwe appreciate your information on that and\n\n481\n00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.050\nwe do appreciate you, the viewer.\n\n482\n00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.107\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here at
