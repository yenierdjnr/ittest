00:00:19.423\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're moving into the world of\n\n4\n00:00:19.423 --> 00:00:22.611\nDreamweaver, that's right,\ncreative cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:26.450\nAnd joining me in the studios today to\nlend his expertise in this very endeavor\n\n6\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.870\nis none other than Mr. Jim Searles.\n\n7\n00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.200\nJim, how you doing today, Sir?\n\n8\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.287\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\nthank you for having me today.\n\n9\n00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:34.113\nI'd also like to thank ITProTV for\nallowing me to come in and\n\n10\n00:00:34.113 --> 00:00:38.120\ntalk about these applications that\nI love so much and that I use.\n\n11\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.590\nAnd I'd like to specifically\ntalk about Dreamweaver and\n\n12\n00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.770\nhow the tools within the application\nare intuitive enough to help you build\n\n13\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.380\na webpage from never having\ndone anything from scratch.\n\n14\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.658\n>> Very good.\nSo anytime we dive into a product or\n\n15\n00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:55.759\na technology, we typically have some\nbasics that we have to go over and Jim,\n\n16\n00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:59.949\nyou're gonna introduce us to this topic\nand show us some of the fundamental.\n\n17\n00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.560\n>> That's a very good question,\nWes, and a very good point.\n\n18\n00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.150\nWe're gonna start by talking about\nthe basics, specifically in this session.\n\n19\n00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.559\nAnd we're gonna learn\nabout the interface and\n\n20\n00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:12.640\nthen work our way on through the HTML\ncoding as well as the CSS coding.\n\n21\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.790\nSo at this point, I'd like to\ndraw attention to my screen, and\n\n22\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.550\nwe'll talk about the Welcome\nscreen within the Adobe platform.\n\n23\n00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.073\nNow, this is one of the few applications\nthat Adobe uses the Welcome screen.\n\n24\n00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:29.655\nAnd I find it to be one of the few\napplications that is extremely useful\n\n25\n00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:30.500\nto use.\n\n26\n00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.490\nThe other applications that we've used for\n\n27\n00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.460\nAdobe don't always facilitate\nthis Welcome screen, but\n\n28\n00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.710\nhere it's essential because of the fact\nthat we have the ability to create our new\n\n29\n00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.180\nfiles right here in the center and start\nfrom a template that Adobe is aware of.\n\n30\n00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.100\nSo we'll talk about the welcome screen.\n\n31\n00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.490\nWe'll talk about some preferences.\n\n32\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.360\nWe're gonna talk about the layout.\n\n33\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.040\nAnd I'm also gonna show you\nthe differences between\n\n34\n00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.420\nwhat's available on the Mac and\nwhat's available on the PC,\n\n35\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.870\nbecause those are gonna be very important\nwithin the Dreamweaver application.\n\n36\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.980\nSo when I look at the welcome\nscreen within the platform,\n\n37\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.330\nthere are three columns of information.\n\n38\n00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.900\nBasically, if you've been\nworking with files in the past,\n\n39\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.090\nyou'll see the ability to\ngo back to those files.\n\n40\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.770\nSo you've got your recent files here.\n\n41\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.500\nYou can also start from scratch and\nopen a new file.\n\n42\n00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.600\nBut here, in the center, we have\nthe ability to create from a template.\n\n43\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.340\nAnd it's gonna give you the coding\nstructure that you need based on\n\n44\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.110\nthat template.\n\n45\n00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.384\nSo we have some CSS files, HTML, PHP, XML.\n\n46\n00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:30.334\nAnd we'll talk a little bit about\nthose items later on as we get through\n\n47\n00:02:30.334 --> 00:02:31.410\nthis process.\n\n48\n00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.450\nWe also have some new fluid\ndesigns down here at the bottom.\n\n49\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.950\nAnd those designs are basically set up so\nthat way they are gonna be responsive to\n\n50\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.660\nwhatever device the person comes to your\nsite on, and that will be important.\n\n51\n00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.070\nAnd then, lastly,\nthe third column is the ability to learn\n\n52\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.220\nfrom Adobe what is the latest, greatest\nthing happening within this application.\n\n53\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.940\nSo we have some links here that will take\nyou back out to Adobe TV in some cases,\n\n54\n00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.310\nor adobe.com,\nwhich will provide you that information.\n\n55\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.910\nSo what I'd like to do right now, however,\nis I'd like to start you from scratch.\n\n56\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.300\nWe're just gonna click on this HTML link\nand we'll create a document from scratch.\n\n57\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.348\nSo you can see what that looks like.\n\n58\n00:03:11.348 --> 00:03:14.460\nAnd at this point, I have to choose\nwhat type of document, whether or\n\n59\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.460\nnot I'm gonna use a template or a site\ntemplate, so I'm moving this around.\n\n60\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.060\nAnd I'm going to choose in this\nexample here from the top,\n\n61\n00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.000\nagain, html, and then I get some options.\n\n62\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.660\nIf ever I select a different option here,\n\n63\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.720\nthe document type, it will change what\noptions are available here in the center.\n\n64\n00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.150\nSo I'm gonna choose html as an option.\n\n65\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.940\nAnd then, from here I get to choose.\n\n66\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.520\nAm I going to use a HTML 5 or\na previous version of the HTML standard.\n\n67\n00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.160\nSo we recently ratified\nthe World Wide Web Consortium,\n\n68\n00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.440\nrecently ratified the HTML 5 standard.\n\n69\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.712\nAnd previous to that we were using\nthe 4.01 transitional with XHTML\n\n70\n00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:56.470\navailable as well.\n\n71\n00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.270\nBut now we've moved on to HTML 5 and\nyou're gonna see there are a lot of\n\n72\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.250\nintuitive media ideas\nthat have come from that.\n\n73\n00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.640\nSo this is really good.\n\n74\n00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.850\nNow, I can assign a document\ntitle right here at the start and\n\n75\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.370\nI can call it My sample site,\nif I want to.\n\n76\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.700\nAnd that'll give me the opportunity to\nstart building from that start place.\n\n77\n00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.609\nI can also attach a cascading style sheets\nto the file when I start working in this.\n\n78\n00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.453\nBut I'm not ready to do that yet and\n\n79\n00:04:23.453 --> 00:04:27.290\nI'll talk about that a little bit\nlater as we get moved forward on this.\n\n80\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.887\nWe also have the bootstrap option, like I\nsaid you can design responsive designs and\n\n81\n00:04:31.887 --> 00:04:36.291\nattach your style sheets for that right\naway but we'll get more into that a little\n\n82\n00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:39.034\nbit later on so for now,\nI'm ready to hit Create.\n\n83\n00:04:39.034 --> 00:04:42.281\nNow, that I've gone through that process,\n\n84\n00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:45.970\nI wanna show you real quick,\nI apologize for this.\n\n85\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.971\nI have the ability to go\nout to the Internet and\n\n86\n00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:51.340\nI wanna make sure that this is\nable to go out to the Internet.\n\n87\n00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.310\nSo here's the interface\nthat we're working in.\n\n88\n00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.840\nAnd here is basically the foundation for\neverything you're going to need.\n\n89\n00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.650\nWe're gonna talk about these basic\nstructures where we have the design\n\n90\n00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.680\nview and the code view, and\nthen we have panels left and right.\n\n91\n00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.370\nBut before I do that, I wanna jump over\nto the PC side and talk about that.\n\n92\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.880\nSo here we are in the PC environment, and\nagain I'm going to start from scratch\n\n93\n00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.950\nhere, so I'm gonna go up to File and\nI'm gonna choose New.\n\n94\n00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.360\nSo we're gonna get the same dialog box\nthat we have in the PC that we had on\n\n95\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.200\nthe Mac side, and I have the same\noptions that are available to me.\n\n96\n00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.850\nI'm gonna choose another HTML file.\n\n97\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.740\nI'm gonna do the same thing here.\n\n98\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.270\nI'm gonna call it My sample site.\n\n99\n00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:31.312\nIf I can spell.\n\n100\n00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.020\n>> Now, Jim, on the Windows side here,\nwhen we make selections are these panels\n\n101\n00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.050\ncontextually sensitive like\nwe see on the Mac, as well?\n\n102\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.830\n>> That's correct.\n\n103\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.160\nAs you select content within your website\nyou're gonna find that everything changes,\n\n104\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.260\ndepending on what's been selected,\nso they are contextual.\n\n105\n00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.421\nThat's good.\n\n106\n00:05:50.421 --> 00:05:53.630\nSo we've given the title to the document.\n\n107\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.876\nAnd we're gonna select the HTML 5 again.\n\n108\n00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:57.770\nAnd again,\nwe're gonna use the same options.\n\n109\n00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.450\nWe're not gonna choose\nthe bootstrap at this time.\n\n110\n00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.890\nSo I'm gonna click Create.\n\n111\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.440\nAnd what you're gonna see now,\n\n112\n00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.428\nis that it's going to come up\nwith the same content sections,\n\n113\n00:06:07.428 --> 00:06:11.410\nin this case it went into live mode and\nsome other things, we'll talk about that.\n\n114\n00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.238\nI'm gonna be switching between the Mac\nversion and the PC version just so\n\n115\n00:06:15.238 --> 00:06:19.079\nwe can see what the differences\nare because it's gonna be very glaring.\n\n116\n00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:21.441\nSo at this point,\nI've got a document ready to go and\n\n117\n00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:24.882\nyou can see right away there are some\ndifferences within the application and\n\n118\n00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:27.051\nthat's really what I wanna talk about for\nnow.\n\n119\n00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:29.894\nThe first thing I'd like\nto bring your attention to,\n\n120\n00:06:29.894 --> 00:06:34.140\nis that the file menu here, across\nthe top, is separate from the application.\n\n121\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.670\nSo if I move this down, you can see\nit is separate from the application.\n\n122\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.440\nAnd so, because of that it might give you\na little bit of a separation anxiety,\n\n123\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.570\nkinda thing.\n\n124\n00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.280\nOn the PC side, however, everything\nis contained within one application,\n\n125\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.670\nthe menu bar, everything is all together.\n\n126\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.270\nSo nothing is separated.\n\n127\n00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.850\nSo that's one part I wanna talk about.\n\n128\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:00.240\nWhen I go to work with preferences or\nI work with changing some settings\n\n129\n00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.620\nwithin the background behind the machine,\nin order to go to preferences on a Mac,\n\n130\n00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.610\nI go over here to the Dreamweaver menu and\nI choose Preferences.\n\n131\n00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.930\nSo this is unique to the Mac,\n\n132\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.230\nthe preferences that is available\nis unique to the Mac this way.\n\n133\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.872\nBut if I go back to the PC, preferences\nare always located under the Edit menu.\n\n134\n00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:22.860\nSo I'm gonna go over here and click on\nEdit in the menu bar and then pull down.\n\n135\n00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.300\nAnd then,\nI have to go all the way to the bottom and\n\n136\n00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.690\nyou'll see this little triangle.\n\n137\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.320\nI'll click on it until\nI see the last item.\n\n138\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.690\nAnd the last item is my preferences list.\n\n139\n00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.324\nNow, the preferences\nare the same beyond that.\n\n140\n00:07:33.324 --> 00:07:35.720\nBut getting there is what's different.\n\n141\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.181\nSo that helps out a lot.\n\n142\n00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:39.540\nLet me close out of this.\n\n143\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.440\nAnd there's one other\nitem I wanna talk about.\n\n144\n00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.376\nIn case you're coming from a previous\nversion of the Dreamweaver application,\n\n145\n00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:49.207\nmaybe Creative Suite 6 or\nCreative Suite 5,\n\n146\n00:07:49.207 --> 00:07:52.039\nthe view on the Mac was\na little bit different,\n\n147\n00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:56.918\nin the sense that I would go to Window and\nI could choose application frame here.\n\n148\n00:07:56.918 --> 00:08:00.499\nSo what happens is,\nall of the panels now are floating and\n\n149\n00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:04.909\nthey can be manipulated and\nmoved Moved independently of each other.\n\n150\n00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:09.660\nNow this was unique to the Mac, did not\nhave this flexibility on the PC side.\n\n151\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.510\nSo there is no applications\nframe that's available.\n\n152\n00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.370\nAnd if I want to reset everything back,\nI go back up to Window and\n\n153\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.520\nI choose Application Frame,\nI check that, and it should flow back.\n\n154\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.730\nNow you'll note here that this\npanel is not flowing back to\n\n155\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.660\nthis part on the right, and\nI'm gonna to dock it just for a moment.\n\n156\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.360\nSo let's dock back.\n\n157\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.020\nIf I go here back to the PC side, and\n\n158\n00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.850\nI click on window,\nthere is no application painting option.\n\n159\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.100\nSo this is one of the major\ndifferences within\n\n160\n00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.260\nthe Windows version in\ncomparison to the Mac version.\n\n161\n00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.110\nNow, I live in the Mac world, so\nI spent a lot of time on the Mac version.\n\n162\n00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.920\nBut I'd like to work with\nthe configuration and I'll configure on\n\n163\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.290\nboth sides so that you can see\nthere's flexibility across both apps.\n\n164\n00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.910\nSo there's not too much\nof a difference there.\n\n165\n00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:02.000\nBut I will spend most of my time\nbuilding a webpage on the Mac version.\n\n166\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:08.410\nSo, to start, we talk about\nthe menu bar here across the top.\n\n167\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.820\nSo, we talked about the menu bar and\n\n168\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.470\nthe fact that it's separate\nfrom the application, but\n\n169\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.100\nbelow that it's called\nthe application bar.\n\n170\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.500\nSo on the Mac there's\nnot a lot going on here.\n\n171\n00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.710\nThe application bar is this section\nright here with those default, and\n\n172\n00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:27.740\nthen I can synchronize between my Creative\nCloud services and the Adobe Application.\n\n173\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.860\nWhen I go back to the PC side,\nokay, here's my menu bar.\n\n174\n00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.090\nBut all the way to the right\nis the Application bar, so\n\n175\n00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.490\nbasically it's all connected into one,\nokay?\n\n176\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.880\nAnd I still have the ability to chose\na workspace and change that up, and\n\n177\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.200\nI have the ability to sync.\n\n178\n00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.460\nAnd you can see right now it's\ngot a little exclamation point,\n\n179\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.600\nwhich means that I haven't synchronized\nin this particular application.\n\n180\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.300\nNow, where it says default,\nI call that a work space\n\n181\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.300\nbecause you might be sharing your computer\nwith other people, or you might want to\n\n182\n00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.629\nchange the work space depending on what\nyour work flow is going to be like.\n\n183\n00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:02.860\nAnd I will tell you,\n\n184\n00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:07.370\nI like to change my environment to\nsuit the workflow that I enjoy.\n\n185\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.620\nAnd I've enjoyed all the way back to CS5.\n\n186\n00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.900\nSo, what you're gonna see me do today is\nto learn how to manipulate the panels.\n\n187\n00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:20.120\nBut at the same The same time I'm going\nto teach you the workflow that I use.\n\n188\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.070\nSo we are using the default workspace and\n\n189\n00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.520\nbasically configures all\nthe panels over here on the right.\n\n190\n00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.120\nAnd in this case I can see split view\nbetween my design and my code, okay.\n\n191\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.600\nWhat I'd like to do is I would like\nto move some of these panels around.\n\n192\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.450\nSo for example I have the files\npanel over here and there's a tab.\n\n193\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:42.490\nI'm gonna click on this tab and\nI'm gonna left click and drag down\n\n194\n00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:48.110\nuntil I dock it in here with the document\nargent model and the assets panel.\n\n195\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.930\nAnd what I'm looking for\n\n196\n00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.770\nhere is a blue highlight that\ncomes around the entire box.\n\n197\n00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.070\nOnce that blue highlight is there,\nit shows me that I'm ready to put this in\n\n198\n00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.680\nthe same space as the rest\nof the tabs that are there.\n\n199\n00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.790\nSo when I let go,\nit should dock that information together.\n\n200\n00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.330\nSo there it is.\n\n201\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.540\nSo there's the DOM, there's the ASF panel,\nand then there's the files panel.\n\n202\n00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.570\nNow, I do like the files panel\nto be by predominant items,\n\n203\n00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.700\nso I'm going to move\nfiles here to the left.\n\n204\n00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.350\nAnd so now it's Files, DOM, Assets.\n\n205\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.120\nSo you can rearrange the tabs\nwithin that group as well.\n\n206\n00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.680\nSo you're not trapped with that.\n\n207\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.280\nNow I maximize this by double-clicking,\nso I can double-click, for example,\n\n208\n00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.250\nCC Libraries and expand that back down.\n\n209\n00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.640\nAnd here it is.\n\n210\n00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.580\nNow Insert Insert is one that I like\nto move above my untitled document.\n\n211\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.890\nI'm currently working untitled document,\nbecause that's what I created earlier.\n\n212\n00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.300\nI'd like to move that above there.\n\n213\n00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.880\nSo I'm gonna pull that out, make it float,\nthis is known as a floating panel.\n\n214\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.540\nYou can see all the options that are\navailable now I'm going to grab this dark\n\n215\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.760\nbar, and I'm going to pull it to\nthe top until I see a blue highlight.\n\n216\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.690\nThat blue highlight tells me that that's\nwhere I'm going to put this new panel.\n\n217\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:59.520\nAnd when I release, I now have the\ninsertion panel up here at the top, okay?\n\n218\n00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.420\nSo I have all the options\nthat are available to me.\n\n219\n00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.359\nAnd this is the HTML section,\nwhich lets me add HTML content.\n\n220\n00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.780\nSo at this point, I have the Files\npanel with my document object model and\n\n221\n00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.890\nmy assets.\n\n222\n00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.520\nI have the insert panel here at the top.\n\n223\n00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.230\nAnd there's one more panel that\nI would like to configure and\n\n224\n00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.090\nplace down at the bottom.\n\n225\n00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.410\nAnd that's the Properties panel.\n\n226\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.930\nThe Properties panel is\ncurrently not available.\n\n227\n00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.220\nBut whenever you see that\nthere's a panel missing,\n\n228\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.770\nyou can always bring a panel back\nout by going to the Window menu.\n\n229\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.430\nSo I'm gonna go up here to\nthe Window menu bar, choose that and\n\n230\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.740\nin the list notice properties is\nnot checked but insert is checked,\n\n231\n00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.730\nfiles is checked and\napplications framed is checked.\n\n232\n00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.140\nSo those are the active items right now.\n\n233\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.300\nSo I'm gonna check properties and\n\n234\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:47.040\nit will appear as a floating panel and I'm\ngonna dock it right here at the bottom, so\n\n235\n00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.370\nthat way I have the ability to\naccess that whenever I need to.\n\n236\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.560\nNow, it does take up real estate for\nthe work I need to do.\n\n237\n00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.260\nBut again, if don't want to\nfocus on the split view here,\n\n238\n00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.300\nI can say just show me the design or\njust show me the code.\n\n239\n00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.950\nSo I have the flexibility\nto change that as well.\n\n240\n00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.570\nOkay, so at this point I've rearranged my\n\n241\n00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.940\npanels the way I like them and\nthe way that the work flow works for me.\n\n242\n00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:16.750\nSo I'm going to now save that as preset\nthat I can use over and over again.\n\n243\n00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.300\n>> Jim, with these customizations, is this\nsomething that pretty much anybody can do?\n\n244\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.290\nNot really a one size fits all but\nhow you want your workspace,\n\n245\n00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.800\nwhat makes you productive.\n\n246\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.630\nYou can configure it that way,\nand you can save it.\n\n247\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.080\nI can only imagine you could load\nit back up after the fact as well.\n\n248\n00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.150\n>> That is a very good question, Wes, and\n\n249\n00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.570\nI've had students ask me that\nsame question every time.\n\n250\n00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.290\nThey say hey, can you give me that\norientation that you did before?\n\n251\n00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.420\nAnd I always come back to the point that\nthey can configure it in whatever way\n\n252\n00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.020\nthey want.\n\n253\n00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.870\nIt's complete flexibility.\n\n254\n00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.790\nOnce you save it inside of the workspace,\n\n255\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.040\nyou will have access to use\nthat same workspace every time.\n\n256\n00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.070\nYou can switch between workspaces, but\n\n257\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.300\nyou can always come back to\nthe one that you've saved.\n\n258\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.070\nSo that's a very good question and\nwe're gonna do that now.\n\n259\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.800\nSo if we go back to my workspace here and\nI go to where it says default.\n\n260\n00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.370\nThere's a little pull down.\n\n261\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.470\nIf I click on that pull-down,\n\n262\n00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.990\nyou'll see that there's some items that\nhave already been built for us by Adobe.\n\n263\n00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.650\nSo we have Beginner, Code,\nDesign, and Abstract.\n\n264\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.020\nSo for example if I click on Beginner,\n\n265\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.420\nthis would give me sort\nof a beginner layout.\n\n266\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.310\nOkay, and it will rearrange things.\n\n267\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.820\nNow I should have saved before I did this\nbecause now I'm going to have to reset,\n\n268\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.400\nbut at this point in time it's\nrearranged all my panels.\n\n269\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.230\nI did leave the properties panel\ndown here, which is great, but\n\n270\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.170\nit moved insert and\nfiles down here to the top.\n\n271\n00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.390\nIf I go back to code view, for example,\nnow the emphasis is going to be on writing\n\n272\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.060\ncode, and because of that it puts it\nright there on the right-hand side, and\n\n273\n00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.310\nnow your panels are relegated to\nthe left of the application, okay.\n\n274\n00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.190\nSo again, just a different workflow\nthat you might have within\n\n275\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.800\nyour environment that you wanna use.\n\n276\n00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.230\nIf I chose design for example,\nnow design is going to be the focus, so\n\n277\n00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.410\nnow we come out with our CSS designer,\nor our cascading style sheets designer.\n\n278\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.590\nNow code is still available but\nI can switch it over to design here and\n\n279\n00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.930\nI can focus on that.\n\n280\n00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.630\nSo these are options that\nare available for us and\n\n281\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.840\nthese are presets that\nAdobe has created for us.\n\n282\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.150\nSo what I'd like to do again is I'm\ngonna reset it back to the default.\n\n283\n00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.350\nNow it should remember how\nI configured the default.\n\n284\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.220\nSo Wes, this is important.\n\n285\n00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.820\nLook at how everything that I had before,\nremember I told you I forgot to save and\n\n286\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.660\nthat could be a problem?\n\n287\n00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.240\n>> That's right.\n>> Not an issue.\n\n288\n00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.750\nIt remembered it for\nthe default workspace,\n\n289\n00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.340\nit kept everything exactly\nthe way I had it set up.\n\n290\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.760\nNow granted, I might want to,\nat some point,\n\n291\n00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.070\nTo reset the default work space so that\nway it starts from the beginning again.\n\n292\n00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.240\nSo I'm gonna need to save this work\nspace the way it is in order for\n\n293\n00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.450\nme to have that layout\nconfigured that way.\n\n294\n00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.810\nSo I'm gonna go up here to default and\nI'm gonna say new work space.\n\n295\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.530\nSo I'm gonna click new work space.\n\n296\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.867\nAnd I wanna call James Playground, okay.\n\n297\n00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.523\nSo James Playground when I click OK.\n\n298\n00:15:53.523 --> 00:15:57.244\nNow those settings are specific\nto that work space.\n\n299\n00:15:57.244 --> 00:15:59.904\nWhen I load Dreamweaver moving forward,\n\n300\n00:15:59.904 --> 00:16:04.850\nit will always have this configuration,\nuntil I make a change at some point.\n\n301\n00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.560\nAnd remember,\nthe changes are saved immediately.\n\n302\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.180\nIf I want to, I could go back to Default\nand now I can say Reset Default.\n\n303\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.384\nSo if I come over here and\nI say Reset Default,\n\n304\n00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:18.690\nit will literally configure it back\nto the way it was at the beginning\n\n305\n00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.966\nwhere the Insert panel\nis no longer at the top.\n\n306\n00:16:20.966 --> 00:16:24.460\nThe Properties panel is no longer\nat the bottom, and all my files and\n\n307\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.720\ninserts here are in the same\ngrouping on the upper left corner.\n\n308\n00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.220\nSo I want to go back Jim's Playground,\nit's right here at the top,\n\n309\n00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.300\nI click on it, and I'm configured\nback to the result I had before.\n\n310\n00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.280\nSo it will remember if I close\nout of Dreamweaver, reload it,\n\n311\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.495\nit will remember that Jim's Playground\nis a configuration that I've got set and\n\n312\n00:16:42.495 --> 00:16:44.300\nit'll revert me back to this.\n\n313\n00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.428\nSo I will always have access to my tools,\nexactly this way.\n\n314\n00:16:47.428 --> 00:16:52.050\n>> Now, Jim, with the individual panels,\nis there any way that we can resize them,\n\n315\n00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.910\ncan we minimize them,\nif we decide that we want them but\n\n316\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.040\nmaybe we don't currently\nwant them in our workspace?\n\n317\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.990\n>> That's a very good question and\nthat's absolutely correct.\n\n318\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.340\nSo for example here,\nthe CC Libraries panel.\n\n319\n00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.510\nCC Libraries I might use later on.\n\n320\n00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.250\nIt's Creative Cloud Libraries.\n\n321\n00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.330\nBasically, what we're doing\nwith the CC Libraries,\n\n322\n00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:13.300\nCreative Cloud, we're connecting to the\ncloud services provided to you by Adobe.\n\n323\n00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.440\nWhen you purchase the software,\n\n324\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.660\nyou also get, I think it's 5 to 20\ngigabytes of storage space in the cloud.\n\n325\n00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.270\nAnd you can add your assets to the cloud\nservices but you also get things back.\n\n326\n00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.560\nYou get fonts that you can use,\nthere's a font kit available, and\n\n327\n00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.690\nthen there's some assets\nthat they provide you.\n\n328\n00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.927\nSo if there are any assets that\nyou have saved for yourself,\n\n329\n00:17:31.927 --> 00:17:35.080\nthey'll be listed here, so it'll\nconnect to the Internet and find that.\n\n330\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.870\nWell, I'm not using it right now,\nso I might wanna move that out.\n\n331\n00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.443\nSo if I grab the tab CC Libraries,\nI can pull that out and\n\n332\n00:17:41.443 --> 00:17:43.167\nmake it a floating panel.\n\n333\n00:17:43.167 --> 00:17:47.451\nOr if I'd prefer, I can come over here\nto the Panel Options Menu in the upper\n\n334\n00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:51.940\nright corner, I can select that and\nI can tell it to Close that item.\n\n335\n00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.121\nOkay, so\nif I close that item it goes away.\n\n336\n00:17:54.121 --> 00:17:58.007\nNow, don't fret because you can\nalways go back to the Window menu and\n\n337\n00:17:58.007 --> 00:17:59.890\nyou can bring it back at any time.\n\n338\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:04.551\nSo any items that you have that you might\nwanna bring back, you can just click on.\n\n339\n00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:07.190\nSo CC Libraries is right here\nin the middle of the list.\n\n340\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.420\nIf I click on it, it will bring it\nback and there we go, it's loading.\n\n341\n00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.560\nThe surf ball of doom.\n\n342\n00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.197\n>> Gotta love the floating pinwheel.\n\n343\n00:18:17.197 --> 00:18:18.185\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n344\n00:18:18.185 --> 00:18:18.915\n>> That's correct.\n\n345\n00:18:18.915 --> 00:18:20.755\nAnd there it is,\nfloating back in the center.\n\n346\n00:18:20.755 --> 00:18:22.245\nAnd the reason why it's taking a while,\n\n347\n00:18:22.245 --> 00:18:24.755\nbecause its trying to connect\nto the Internet to find\n\n348\n00:18:24.755 --> 00:18:26.695\nthe CC Libraries that I\nmight have available to me.\n\n349\n00:18:26.695 --> 00:18:29.295\nSo it actually did a refresh there,\nso that's good.\n\n350\n00:18:29.295 --> 00:18:32.831\nBut I did wanna close that out, so I can\nalso click the X here in the upper left\n\n351\n00:18:32.831 --> 00:18:35.772\ncorner and close it out just like\nyou would close out a window.\n\n352\n00:18:35.772 --> 00:18:40.270\nOkay, so at this point I have\nCC Designer and Snippets.\n\n353\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.430\nI have no problem with Snippets and\nI have no problem with CC Designer.\n\n354\n00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.530\nAs a matter of fact Snippets has some code\nthat you can grab that has been written by\n\n355\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.920\nAdobe and you can write code yourself and\nreuse it over and over again.\n\n356\n00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.440\nBut the CC Designer is\none of those that if you\n\n357\n00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.660\nresize this panel here on the right\nit will give you more options.\n\n358\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.279\nSo, for example, notice I have Sources,\nMedia, Selectors, Properties.\n\n359\n00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:07.031\nOkay, if I resize this by coming over here\nand seeing the double arrows like you\n\n360\n00:19:07.031 --> 00:19:11.063\ndo to resize anything, if I resize\nthis by dragging it to the left,\n\n361\n00:19:11.063 --> 00:19:16.110\nyou're gonna see that Properties\nshould eventually jump to the right.\n\n362\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.870\nSo, resizing in this example,\nis very useful,\n\n363\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.270\nbecause you can actually\ngain more workflow.\n\n364\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.740\nIt's a better workflow to work with\nyour properties in a second column,\n\n365\n00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.240\nthan it is to be underneath Selectors,\nbecause now\n\n366\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.890\nI can see what properties I might want to\nassign to the items that I'm working with.\n\n367\n00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.590\nSo that's a really good question.\n\n368\n00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.820\nNow, I can minimize this.\n\n369\n00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.260\nI can make it so it's not even showing.\n\n370\n00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.050\nMaybe I wanna focus on my code,\nor I wanna focus on the design.\n\n371\n00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:46.350\nSo I can come over here in the upper\nright-hand corner of these panels and\n\n372\n00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.300\nhit these double chevrons, okay?\n\n373\n00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.570\nSo these double arrows, I hit that,\nit will collapse it down.\n\n374\n00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.170\nAnd I didn't click on it,\nI clicked on the Menu, here it is.\n\n375\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.700\nCollapse to icons.\n\n376\n00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.410\nSo here I've got it so\nit's got the text and icons.\n\n377\n00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.936\nAnd with the text and icons I can\ntell what those icons represent.\n\n378\n00:20:01.936 --> 00:20:04.395\nBut I can even drag it\nfurther to the right and\n\n379\n00:20:04.395 --> 00:20:07.700\nmake it even smaller to\nwhere it's just the icons.\n\n380\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.180\nIf I'm familiar enough to know\nwhat those icons represent\n\n381\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.540\nthen I don't need the text\nto tell me what it is.\n\n382\n00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.070\nAnd so we have that flexibility.\n\n383\n00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:19.850\nNow you can see I have a lot of room\nin this area here to write code and\n\n384\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.560\nalso to see my design and\nsee how things are working out.\n\n385\n00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:31.230\nNow, when I do collapse it down, however,\nI click on the item and it expands out.\n\n386\n00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.820\nBut that's temporary, right?\n\n387\n00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.890\nCuz I can click back on the double\nchevrons and collapse it down again.\n\n388\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.600\nSo I can configure this\nby resizing the panels,\n\n389\n00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:46.110\nmaking them smaller or larger,\nand I can actually benefit\n\n390\n00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:50.320\nby resizing because I could get\nmore of my design or coding space.\n\n391\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.800\nOr, I can get more information\nwithin the panel itself.\n\n392\n00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.630\nAnd that's really important.\n\n393\n00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.110\nSo good question.\n\n394\n00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.300\nI am gonna expand this out.\n\n395\n00:20:59.300 --> 00:20:59.810\nOr, guess what?\n\n396\n00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.530\nI'm gonna go back here and\ntell it to reset Jim's Playground.\n\n397\n00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.840\nAnd that should expand it back out for\nme and make it the size it was before.\n\n398\n00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.717\n>> Now, Jim, that seems like somebody\nlike me that maybe is new to Dreamweaver,\n\n399\n00:21:10.717 --> 00:21:13.948\nthat if [LAUGH] I get in there and\nI configure things, completely,\n\n400\n00:21:13.948 --> 00:21:15.860\njust completely hose the workspace.\n\n401\n00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.050\nAnd I'm like,\nI don't really have much workspace.\n\n402\n00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.500\nI've got work, but no more space.\n\n403\n00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.730\nI can reset things, right?\n\n404\n00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.411\n>> Absolutely,\nI have heard of that many times.\n\n405\n00:21:23.411 --> 00:21:27.150\nI have so many panels open and\nI can't see what I'm trying to do.\n\n406\n00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:27.823\nWhat can I do?\n\n407\n00:21:27.823 --> 00:21:31.048\nYou just go back and you reset\nthe workspace back to what it was, and\n\n408\n00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:32.800\nthe panels that you had open.\n\n409\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.780\nBecause you can open as many\npanels as are available here and\n\n410\n00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.010\nyou can get it to become so\nbusy that you can't see\n\n411\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.430\nanything that you're doing anymore and\nthat might cause problems.\n\n412\n00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.860\nI mean, even some of these panels\nhave sub-panels within them.\n\n413\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.360\nSo there's so many panels going on.\n\n414\n00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.280\nAnd you might have moved these around.\n\n415\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.200\nAnd so\nyou could see what's going on in there.\n\n416\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.110\nBut at any time you can hit that Reset and\nit'll solve the problem.\n\n417\n00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.000\nYou're absolutely right,\nso good point there.\n\n418\n00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.770\nOkay, fantastic.\n\n419\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.990\nNow, with that said,\nI'd like to go over to the PC side,\n\n420\n00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.840\nand I'd like to show you the same thing.\n\n421\n00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.126\nSo if I go back to my PC side here.\n\n422\n00:22:09.126 --> 00:22:12.533\nGoodness, Windows Users Parallels is\ntrying to update and activate, okay.\n\n423\n00:22:12.533 --> 00:22:18.570\nOkay, so I have the same\nconfiguration here, I'm on Default.\n\n424\n00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.660\nThere is no Jim's workspace, right,\n\n425\n00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.030\nbecause I'm working on\na different platform.\n\n426\n00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.870\nBut I still have the presets\nthat Adobe has created for\n\n427\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.600\nme and Default is here as well.\n\n428\n00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.578\nSo if I wanted to, I could start moving my\npanels over again very quickly here and\n\n429\n00:22:33.578 --> 00:22:39.215\nreposition them where I like them to be,\nin the configuration that I like.\n\n430\n00:22:39.215 --> 00:22:45.175\nAnd that should provide me\na view of what I'm trying to do.\n\n431\n00:22:45.175 --> 00:22:46.273\nOkay, sorry.\n\n432\n00:22:46.273 --> 00:22:50.940\nI'm gonna go to here, there we go, okay.\n\n433\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.460\nAnd I guess Assets was also down here.\n\n434\n00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.192\nOkay, so we have all of these items.\n\n435\n00:22:58.638 --> 00:23:03.750\nOkay, and at this point,\nI have the setup the way that I want.\n\n436\n00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.290\nOne more item, Properties panel.\n\n437\n00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.180\nAnd I'm gonna dock it down at the bottom.\n\n438\n00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.730\nI will save it and then we'll be done.\n\n439\n00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.120\nSo let me just finish that up here.\n\n440\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.852\nOr maybe not dock it at the bottom.\n\n441\n00:23:18.914 --> 00:23:20.390\nOkay, that's interesting.\n\n442\n00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.030\nThere, no, that's gonna dock there.\n\n443\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.780\nThere it is.\nOkay, there we go.\n\n444\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.995\nCome over here, save it.\n\n445\n00:23:35.492 --> 00:23:37.190\nAnd there we are.\n\n446\n00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.440\nSo, similar configuration.\n\n447\n00:23:40.742 --> 00:23:43.600\nAnd there's my code, just like before,\nand we're good to go.\n\n448\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.110\n>> And\nI can see where that would come in handy,\n\n449\n00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.150\nJim, if you're moving between\ntwo different platforms.\n\n450\n00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.000\nMaybe you got a work computer that's\ngot Windows but you come home,\n\n451\n00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.780\nmaybe you're using your Mac at home.\n\n452\n00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:57.137\nWhere you can kinda have some consistency,\nif it will be, in the user interface,\n\n453\n00:23:57.137 --> 00:23:59.220\nuser experience, right?\n\n454\n00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.990\n>> That's absolutely correct, the point of\na workspace is to have that consistency so\n\n455\n00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.570\ntheres familiarity with\nwhere things are located and\n\n456\n00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.310\nyou'll be able to find it much easier.\n\n457\n00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.925\nThis is a workflow that I've used since I\nstarted using Dreamweaver back in 1997,\n\n458\n00:24:13.925 --> 00:24:18.345\nbecause that's how the arrangement was,\nthe Insert panel was always on the top and\n\n459\n00:24:18.345 --> 00:24:20.579\nthe Properties was always at the bottom.\n\n460\n00:24:20.579 --> 00:24:25.427\nSo a lot of these are happening\nbecause of the fact that I'm just so\n\n461\n00:24:25.427 --> 00:24:29.680\nused to it it's become routine for\nme, and I enjoy that.\n\n462\n00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.900\nBut you're absolutely right.\n\n463\n00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.220\nIf you move from one\nworkstation to another,\n\n464\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.310\nthe workspace will give you that\nconsistency and it'll help you out.\n\n465\n00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.690\nGood questions.\n\n466\n00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.720\nOkay, fantastic.\n\n467\n00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.490\nSo we've got the workspace,\nwe can move our panels around,\n\n468\n00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.310\nwe can make them float,\nwe can close them down individually.\n\n469\n00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.260\nAnd we can save the workspace so\nthat way we can use it in the future and\n\n470\n00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:56.810\nyou can make it so that way, you have\nthis reusable space for you every time.\n\n471\n00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.430\n>> All right, thank you, Jim,\nfor a good introduction there.\n\n472\n00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.860\nBut it does look like we're gonna come\nto the end of another episode here, but\n\n473\n00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.350\nbefore we do that,\ndo you have other additional words?\n\n474\n00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.440\n>> Yeah, the point of\ndiscussion is that I would like\n\n475\n00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.380\nto say that if you feel comfortable in\nthe environment that you're working with,\n\n476\n00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.840\nthese tools will really help benefit you,\nand configuring your workspace,\n\n477\n00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.230\nconfiguring the layout of everything,\nis really basically for comfort.\n\n478\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.010\n>> And it's basically to provide you,\n\n479\n00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:28.600\nthe user, a space that you're gonna\nwanna work in and always come back to.\n\n480\n00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.370\n>> All right, well, Jim,\nwe appreciate your information on that and\n\n481\n00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.050\nwe do appreciate you, the viewer.\n\n482\n00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.107\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here at ITProTV.\n\n483\n00:25:35.107 --> 00:25:37.148\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n484\n00:25:37.148 --> 00:25:37.962\n>> And I'm Jim Searles.\n\n485\n00:25:37.962 --> 00:25:40.250\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n486\n00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:48.400\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.100\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.530\nAnd in today's episode, we are moving\nthrough our DreamWeaver series.\n\n5\n00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.030\nThat's right.\n\n6\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.280\nThe Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n7\n00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.840\nJoining me back in the studios again\nis none other than Mr.Jim Searles.\n\n8\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.500\nJim, how you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.370\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.770\nThank you for having me today.\n\n11\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.630\nAnd thank you to ITPROTV for welcoming me\nback so we can talk about DreamWeaver,\n\n12\n00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.490\nan application that I enjoy.\n\n13\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.600\nAnd we can talk about creating a site,\nand when we talk about creating sites,\n\n14\n00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.100\nwe're not necessarily talking about\nthe website out on the internet.\n\n15\n00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.870\nWe're talking about sites that\ndream weaver can manage and\n\n16\n00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.210\nthe file's and assets we use for\nour development.\n\n17\n00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.700\nSo I'd like to dive right in and\nget to my computer here so\n\n18\n00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.810\nwe can look at the multiple ways\nto go in and create a site.\n\n19\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.120\nI'm gonna start by going to the site menu.\n\n20\n00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.650\nWhen I click on the site menu here across\nthe top I can click the site item and\n\n21\n00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.390\nI can choose new site or managed sites.\n\n22\n00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.280\nIf I choose new site,\n\n23\n00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.510\nit will give me the opportunity to name\nthe site and find the site folder.\n\n24\n00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.090\nI'm gonna show you another method,\nso just for\n\n25\n00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.830\nthis moment in time I'm\ngoing to cancel out of this.\n\n26\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.470\nThe other way you can go into and\n\n27\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.960\ncreate a new site is to go into the files\npanel in the bottom right hand corner.\n\n28\n00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.400\nIn the files panel in\nthe bottom right hand corner,\n\n29\n00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.110\nI have the ability to go to this\ndrop down and choose Manage Sites so\n\n30\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.840\nWe can click on that, and then,\nwe can create a new site right here.\n\n31\n00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.120\nSo same dialogue box that we saw before.\n\n32\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.620\nNow, the third way that we can do this,\nI might cancel out of this again,\n\n33\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.510\nis to literally expand this out and\nthen to go into this site menu here.\n\n34\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.970\nAnd the site menu here is almost\nexactly like the other site menu.\n\n35\n00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.870\nI'd like to point out that in the Windows\nversion of Dreamweaver when I do maximize\n\n36\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.460\nthe files panel the files panel takes\nover the entire Dreamweaver application.\n\n37\n00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.700\nIf I pull this down you'll see\nthat my desktop is behind it so\n\n38\n00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.880\ntechnically I'm now inside the files and\nfiles is now the predominant application.\n\n39\n00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.940\nIf I want to revert back to dream weaver,\nI can click on this icon again to collapse\n\n40\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.720\nand show local files icon, and I can get\nback to the dream weaver application.\n\n41\n00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.850\nSo we're going to go back to the site\nmenu here and create a site.\n\n42\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.340\nSo under new site, I have a couple of\ndifferent options here on the left.\n\n43\n00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.390\nSo the options that I have is site,\nservers, version control and\n\n44\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.079\nadvanced settings.\n\n45\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.460\nThe site is where I'm actually going to\nname my sites, and I'm going to point\n\n46\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.860\nto the files and folders that\nI'm going to use as my assets.\n\n47\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.670\nNow, I can give it any name that I want,\nand I'm going to call it My Sample Site.\n\n48\n00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.400\nAnd then the local site folder,\nI can click the little\n\n49\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.690\nfolder icon here to the right to point to\nthe file folder that I want to got to.\n\n50\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.160\nIn this case, I'm just going to place it\non the desktop, and I'm going to create,\n\n51\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.590\nor click Select Folder and\nhere we have the information that we need.\n\n52\n00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.050\nNow if I was going to\nconnect to an FTP server,\n\n53\n00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.350\nif I was going to connect to files\nthat I might have out on the Internet,\n\n54\n00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.930\nI would go to servers, and\nthen I would have to create this.\n\n55\n00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.470\nBut this we're gonna\ndiscuss at a later time.\n\n56\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.920\nAlso down here there's\nsome advance settings\n\n57\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.580\nthat you might want to consider looking at\nand we'll take a look at that right now.\n\n58\n00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.960\nSo I'm going to click on this\ntriangle that's called a twirly in\n\n59\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.835\nthe Adobe vernacular, and I'm going to see\nthat I have many different options here.\n\n60\n00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:38.975\nAgain, these are a little more advanced\nfor our conversation today, but\n\n61\n00:03:38.975 --> 00:03:40.975\nI'm going to click on advanced settings.\n\n62\n00:03:40.975 --> 00:03:45.805\nAnd I do want to specify where my image\nfolder is going to lie eventually.\n\n63\n00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:51.315\nThe point here is that, any image assets\nthat I use, I can tell Dreamer right away\n\n64\n00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:55.170\nwhere those files are located, and it will\nuse them and point to that all the time.\n\n65\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.160\nI can also specify the web URL for\nthe site that I'm creating.\n\n66\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.290\nSo, I can specify the web address here,\nthe domain, and list that here as well.\n\n67\n00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.790\nOkay?\nBut\n\n68\n00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.620\nat this point in time, just having\nthe site created, having the name, and\n\n69\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.640\npointing to the folder is what I'd like\nto do right now, so I'm gonna click Save.\n\n70\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.830\nOnce I do that, it is going to tell\nme I've chosen another location,\n\n71\n00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.170\nthat I've, in this case,\nthat I exist on another site I've created.\n\n72\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.120\nSo I'm going to click OK, and it's going\nto find the files within that location.\n\n73\n00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.880\nNow, I did have a folder on the desktop,\nIt's called Cleanup, and because of that,\n\n74\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.120\nit's now showing up in the files panel.\n\n75\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.180\nAnd that's important to understand\nbecause this is how Dream Weaver manages.\n\n76\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.900\nThe files that are available to\nit based on what we just gave it.\n\n77\n00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.890\nWe gave it a location and\nnow it's finding those files.\n\n78\n00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.340\nAlso what you'll find is if I\ngo inside of this pull-down,\n\n79\n00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.450\nyou will see that my sample\nsite now exists in, a list.\n\n80\n00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.890\nSo at any time I can swap between\nmultiple sites and view that information.\n\n81\n00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.650\nNow, the point of this is to be able\nto have Dream Weaver manage and\n\n82\n00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.490\norganize our files.\n\n83\n00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.930\nSo if I go out of Dream Weaver, and\n\n84\n00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.139\nlet's say I create a new folder out\nhere and I'm just going to call it Test.\n\n85\n00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.380\nSo now, I have a folder called test and\non the desk top, and\n\n86\n00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.340\nthen I go back into Dreamweaver.\n\n87\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.320\nThere is no folder here for test,\nso because of that, I have to go up\n\n88\n00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.020\non the menu here inside the files panel,\nand I have to click the Refresh icon.\n\n89\n00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.060\nSo I'm gonna click Refresh and now you're\ngoing to see that test has shown up, or\n\n90\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.360\nI could wait a few second and\nit finally refreshes.\n\n91\n00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.200\nBut the point here is is that Dream Weaver\nwas not able to see that until\n\n92\n00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.640\nthe refresh happened.\n\n93\n00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.810\nSo if you work outside of\nDream Weaver to manage your assets\n\n94\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.900\nthat could be problematic when you're\ntrying to work in your files panel.\n\n95\n00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.360\nSo instead a better methodology,\nif I could speak here it would be great\n\n96\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.890\nIs to right click inside this\narea in the files panel.\n\n97\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.090\nAnd to choose to create your new files or\nyour folders.\n\n98\n00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.430\nAnd I'd like to set up my folder\nstructure at this point in time for\n\n99\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.390\nall the assets I'm going to use.\n\n100\n00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.820\nSo I'm gonna start here by\ncreating a new folder, and\n\n101\n00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.630\nwe're going to call this My Style.\n\n102\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.310\nSo I'm gonna do _Styles.\n\n103\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.660\nNow, basically, what I'm doing is,\nI'm placing an underscore in front of\n\n104\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.080\nthe name of the folder, because I want\nthis, alphabetically, to move to the top.\n\n105\n00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.520\nThese are one of those important folders,\nwhere I'm gonna have all the assets for\n\n106\n00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.240\nmy website, so\nit's important that I find it.\n\n107\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.050\nSo, having the underscore in front of\nthis should move it up to the top.\n\n108\n00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.260\nAlso, I'm gonna create another folder for\nimages.\n\n109\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:38.950\nSo I'm gonna do underscore images and you\nhave to be careful, I had style selected.\n\n110\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.010\nSo now, it's trying to place this\nimage folder inside of styles and\n\n111\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.530\nI'm gonna show you here that I\nshould be able to move that out.\n\n112\n00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.190\nSo I'm gonna do images and you can\nthey're subordinate to each other and\n\n113\n00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.370\nthere's a minus here and\nI can collapse that down and hide it.\n\n114\n00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.180\nBut what I'd like to do is move it out,\nso literally using Dreamweaver,\n\n115\n00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.600\nI can pull this out and\nmove it onto its own area here.\n\n116\n00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.840\nThe blue bar tells me where I'm\nputting it and it's making it so\n\n117\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.530\nthat I can move it out of\nthat folder as I right-click.\n\n118\n00:07:08.674 --> 00:07:14.386\nAll right, so I'm trying to move\nthat out Not to the subordinate,\n\n119\n00:07:14.386 --> 00:07:19.330\nI don't want it to be inside a test and\nit's not working.\n\n120\n00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.400\nSo here's what I'm gonna do,\nI'm just gonna delete the folder and\n\n121\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.290\nI'm going to recreate it without\nhaving the styles folder selected.\n\n122\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.350\nSo to delete I have to go\nto the edit option and\n\n123\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.289\nchoose the sub menu that's available here.\n\n124\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.290\nAnd it's gonna say, do you really\nwant to delete this selected file?\n\n125\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.380\nIn this case, it's a folder.\n\n126\n00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.620\nI'm gonna say Yes.\n\n127\n00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.250\nAgain, Dreamweaver's trying to keep track\nof what's going on with your assets, so\n\n128\n00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.480\nit's making sure that you're doing\nwhat you're supposed to be doing.\n\n129\n00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.450\nSo again,\nif I select here the root folder, and\n\n130\n00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.110\nI choose right-click > New Folder.\n\n131\n00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.450\nIt should now be its own folder.\n\n132\n00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.760\nSo I'm gonna do _images.\n\n133\n00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.454\nThe next item is going to be for\nour fonts, so if you have any fonts that\n\n134\n00:08:01.454 --> 00:08:05.278\nyou're working with, I need to make\nsure that I got my route selected,\n\n135\n00:08:05.278 --> 00:08:07.867\nright-click > choose New folder, _fonts.\n\n136\n00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:15.398\nAnd the other folder that I'd like to\nhave is my scripts because you might have\n\n137\n00:08:15.398 --> 00:08:16.200\nJavaScript.\n\n138\n00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.720\nYou might have PHP or some other scripts\nthat you are using to access data.\n\n139\n00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.075\nSo I'm gonna add another folder here and\nwe're call this ones scripts.\n\n140\n00:08:30.675 --> 00:08:31.650\nOkay.\n\n141\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.330\nSo these are the basic folders that\nI use when I create the word say.\n\n142\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.990\nAnd this allows me to have what I need for\nassets, and\n\n143\n00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.180\nto place those assets in\nthe appropriate folder.\n\n144\n00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.320\nYou can name these whatever you want.\n\n145\n00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.520\nThis is specific to you and\nto what your workload dictates.\n\n146\n00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.410\nIt allows you to find what you're looking\nfor based on the name of the folder, so\n\n147\n00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.350\nthat's very important.\n\n148\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.840\n>> Now Jim I noticed that you put\nunderscores on every one of those folders\n\n149\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.560\nyou create, is this a good practice\n>> Practice if you have multiple projects,\n\n150\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.010\nor maybe multiple sites you're\nworking on at the same time.\n\n151\n00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.880\nCan your hierarchy get kind of\nconvoluted and make it less productive,\n\n152\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.080\nif you can't find those folders easier?\n\n153\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.430\nIs that why you're doing that?\n\n154\n00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.080\n>> That's absolutely correct.\n\n155\n00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.050\nIf I didn't put the underscores\nin front of those names,\n\n156\n00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.360\nthey would be stored alphabetically,\nwith the HTML files that I'm using.\n\n157\n00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.060\nOr assets that I might have in the root.\n\n158\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.750\nAnd what this does is,\nit isolates those files and\n\n159\n00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.520\nplaces them at the top of the list.\n\n160\n00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.740\nThis way it makes it easier to find what\nwe're using and what we need to use for\n\n161\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.720\nour design.\n\n162\n00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.100\nSo, perfect question and\nthat's a very good idea.\n\n163\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.610\nSo, at this point, I've got my styles,\nI've got my images, I've got my files and\n\n164\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.380\nI've got my scripts and basically,\nI've created the assets I need.\n\n165\n00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.500\nThe only thing I am missing\nis the initial File\n\n166\n00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.080\nthat I need to use to create the website.\n\n167\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.050\nAnd the initial file is going\nto be an index file, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.200\nNow, you can have two file names,\nindex or default.\n\n169\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.543\nA lot of Microsoft web pages\nhave a default .html or\n\n170\n00:10:00.543 --> 00:10:04.430\n.htm file and\nin Dreamweaver we default to index.\n\n171\n00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.970\nThat's the one we use most often.\n\n172\n00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.830\nBut either way, browsers will look for\n\n173\n00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.400\neither default or\nindex as the root file on every website.\n\n174\n00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.030\nNow when you go to google.com, you\ndon't have to type in google.com/index.\n\n175\n00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.820\nIt just automatically finds it.\n\n176\n00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.161\nIf you did type in for example, CNN.com or\n\n177\n00:10:22.161 --> 00:10:26.490\nwhatever, /index,\nyou would still surf to that page fine.\n\n178\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.110\nOkay?\n\n179\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.310\nAnd because they have that built in.\n\n180\n00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:34.273\n>> Is that something that I commonly\nsee in those URLs, where you'll see\n\n181\n00:10:34.273 --> 00:10:40.060\nindex.aspx, or index.htm or\n.html, or index.php?\n\n182\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.760\n>> That's absolutely correct.\n\n183\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.140\nSo what happens with that is\nthe index file will determine\n\n184\n00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.590\nwhat it is that you're going to look for\nwhen you first get to a website.\n\n185\n00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.130\nAnd it could be an ASPX file or\nan ASP file,\n\n186\n00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.240\nthat just means hey this is a file\nthat resides on a Microsoft Server.\n\n187\n00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.970\nActive Server Page, that's what it\nstands for and the X stands for XML.\n\n188\n00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.880\nBut basically its saying, hey,\nthis is where it resides and\n\n189\n00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.430\nthat's what that information is.\n\n190\n00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.430\nThe PHP would be a data file and\nagain it's just saying,\n\n191\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.260\nthis resides on a SQL server somewhere,\nor some kind of data server.\n\n192\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.360\nSo very good question, thank you.\n\n193\n00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.480\nOkay, so to create the HTML file,\nI'm going to go back to my application and\n\n194\n00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.840\nI'm going to go to the file menu and\nI'm going to go to new.\n\n195\n00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.550\nNow, I could have right-clicked inside the\nfiles panel and chosen new file as well.\n\n196\n00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.890\nSo either way would allow\nme to get that file up.\n\n197\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.320\nAnd as I get click happy here I'm creating\nnew folders when I didn't want them.\n\n198\n00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.270\nSo what I'm going to do here is I'm going\nto right click again and choose new file.\n\n199\n00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.100\nAnd what it does is it\nautomatically creates a html file.\n\n200\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:53.350\nNow this html file designation is coming\nfrom the fact that I have my preferences.\n\n201\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.150\nSet up so that way it always\nuses the HTML delimiter.\n\n202\n00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.740\nYou can set this up to be HTM,\nit's totally up to you.\n\n203\n00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.600\nBrowsers look for HTM or\nHTML, it doesn't matter, but\n\n204\n00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.530\nI will show you where that is in\nthe preferences in a later episode.\n\n205\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:17.700\nSo I'm gonna type in index and you can see\nright away index study html, I hit enter.\n\n206\n00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.690\nAnd now, if i double-click on that file,\nit opens up and I have some code, okay?\n\n207\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.890\nMy thought is at this point I'd like\nto show you how to create it using\n\n208\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.650\nthe File-New feature.\n\n209\n00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.939\nSo I'm gonna close out of this, I'm gonna\ngo back to the File menu and choose New.\n\n210\n00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.010\nOnce I do that you're gonna\nsee many more options.\n\n211\n00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.930\nSo by default if I go\ninto the files panel and\n\n212\n00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:46.830\nI create the file new within the files\npanel, I will always get an HTML file.\n\n213\n00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.300\nBut if that's not the file type I need,\nmaybe I need a cascading style sheet or\n\n214\n00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.140\nmaybe I'm working with JavaScript or\n\n215\n00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.280\nsome other type of file I need to go to\nFile > New to specify which file type.\n\n216\n00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.620\nBy default, HTML is here at the top, so\n\n217\n00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.010\nthat's the one that is being\ncreated inside the files panel.\n\n218\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.490\nBut if I click on CSS,\nI can create a CSS file and\n\n219\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.490\nI can specify what I wanna work with.\n\n220\n00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.500\nIf I want JavaScript, I click on this, and\nit will, what happens is at this point,\n\n221\n00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.770\nDreamweaver understands the file\ntypes that you're working with.\n\n222\n00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.880\nAnd it will make sure that\nthe code coloring and\n\n223\n00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.680\nthe code information that it looks\nat is specific to that type of file.\n\n224\n00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.560\nOkay.\n\n225\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.450\nI am going to create a html file again.\n\n226\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.720\nWe're just gonna choose a title here.\n\n227\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.190\nAnd this time I'm gonna do for\nexample about, and\n\n228\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:37.850\nI'm gonna type in us, and\nHTML5 is the standard\n\n229\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.170\nthat we're using that is the current\nratified standard out in the internet.\n\n230\n00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.960\nAnd you could choose\na different standard but\n\n231\n00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.280\nI will tell you the most modern\ndesigns are built with HTML5.\n\n232\n00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.920\nIt comes equipped with the ability to\ndo multimedia and it comes equipped\n\n233\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.479\nto do the responsive designs like\neverybody sees on the internet.\n\n234\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.580\nWe can connect to\nan Cascading Style Sheets and\n\n235\n00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.640\nwe're talk about Cascading Style Sheets\nin later episode and\n\n236\n00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.050\nyou can connect into that by\nclicking on this link icon.\n\n237\n00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.370\nAnd then at this point I'm\nready to click Create and\n\n238\n00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.290\nnow you'll see and\nAbout Us here on the Title.\n\n239\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.000\nNow it didn't technically\nsave file as about us\n\n240\n00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.900\nOkay it's still called untitled one.\n\n241\n00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.980\nAnd the fact that I have an asterisks\nnext to this untitled tab\n\n242\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.580\ntells me that I haven't yet saved it.\n\n243\n00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.380\nSo if I do attempt to save this file\nby going up to the file menu and\n\n244\n00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.600\nchoosing Save.\n\n245\n00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.870\nIt's gonna say,\nhey you haven't save this yet,\n\n246\n00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.990\nyou haven't given me a name,\nit's gonna ask you for a location.\n\n247\n00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.240\nAnd I get to choose the name and\nalso the file type, and\n\n248\n00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.710\nthese are all the different\nfile types you can use.\n\n249\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.463\nSo I'm just gonna call this about us.\n\n250\n00:14:49.713 --> 00:14:51.870\nAs I have to learn how\nto spell A-B-O-U-T us.\n\n251\n00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.800\nThere we go.\n\n252\n00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.710\nNow, one more thing that\nI wanna talk about, Wes,\n\n253\n00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.770\nis the fact that I'm using\na specific naming convention.\n\n254\n00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:06.380\nThe naming convention I'm using is not\nto include any spaces in the words that\n\n255\n00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:11.540\nI'm typing, and it's also that I'm\nnot using any capital letters.\n\n256\n00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.730\nYou can use capital letters but\nyou shouldn't use spacing.\n\n257\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:19.800\nIn order to make up for the spacing, you\ncan use underscores in between each word\n\n258\n00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.140\nand that will give you\nsome word separation.\n\n259\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.250\nBut you shouldn't use\nspacing in between each word.\n\n260\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.120\nHere's why.\n\n261\n00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.560\nWhen you're surfing the internet,\nbrowsers convert the spaces between\n\n262\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.398\nthe words of your files into %20s.\n\n263\n00:15:37.398 --> 00:15:42.380\n%20 is the code used on the internet\nto say that this is a space.\n\n264\n00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.400\nIt's basically I think your ASCII code,\nand\n\n265\n00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:51.950\nthat is the American symbols for\nCharacters and it's version two.\n\n266\n00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:57.870\nBut the point is, is it converts\nspaces into this percent, 20.\n\n267\n00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.940\nAnd if you were to provide\nsomebody that URL,\n\n268\n00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:07.610\nyou would have to say\nmywebsite.com/aboutpercent20us.html.\n\n269\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.450\nAnd that would cause a lot of\nconfusion and you wouldn't want that.\n\n270\n00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.120\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n271\n00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.700\nNow it doesn't matter if you use spaces or\nnot.\n\n272\n00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.200\nIt doesn't matter if you use underscores.\n\n273\n00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.300\nIt doesn't matter if you\nuse capitol lettering.\n\n274\n00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.660\nThe only thing I recommend,\nIs that you always be consistent.\n\n275\n00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.420\nAnd so, your one site should\nhave the same consistency,\n\n276\n00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.302\nand there's multiple purposes for\nthis consistency.\n\n277\n00:16:29.302 --> 00:16:31.000\nThe fact that you might be collaborating\nwith other people, the fact that you might\n\n278\n00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.200\ncome to this in the future, and want to\nreference a file, just by typing it in.\n\n279\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.000\nAnd you can't remember if you used caps,\nor\n\n280\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.030\nif you used underscore that kind of thing\nthat might cause problems in the future.\n\n281\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.930\nSo by remaining consistent you'll always\nknow well this is a file name for\n\n282\n00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.190\nan HTML file.\n\n283\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.600\nTherefore, it has no spaces and\n\n284\n00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.060\nit's all lowercase, or whatever\nthe naming convention you've chosen.\n\n285\n00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:58.920\nSo, just be cognizant of the fact\nthat you need to remain consistent.\n\n286\n00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.850\nOkay.\n\n287\n00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.170\nSo, with that said we\nhave our site configured.\n\n288\n00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:08.180\nWe have a couple of HTML files ready\nto go and we are now ready to move on\n\n289\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.090\nto a new topic where we're gonna\nbe working to create our pages.\n\n290\n00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:13.050\n>> All right, very good.\n\n291\n00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.760\nWell, Jim, thank you for that information.\n\n292\n00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.630\nDo you have anything else that you'd\nlike to talk about with creating sites?\n\n293\n00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.240\n>> That's a good question, Wes.\n\n294\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.900\nWhen it comes to working with sites,\n\n295\n00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.500\nit's always best to let\nDreamweaver do the work for you.\n\n296\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.110\nThese applications are wonderful, they're\nput together by a lot of great developers.\n\n297\n00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.360\nAnd they try to make it as\nintuitive as possible, and\n\n298\n00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.690\nif you let the application do the work for\nyou, you won't have to stress later on.\n\n299\n00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:43.230\nWhat you're gonna see when we start\ndelving a little deeper into creating\n\n300\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:49.330\nthese webpages is the fact that\nDreamWeaver will write all of the code.\n\n301\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.580\nSo even though I'm showing you the code on\nthe screen and you're seeing it, you won't\n\n302\n00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.180\nnecessarily have to always be in the code,\nand you definitely won't have to write it.\n\n303\n00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.090\nEspecially if you let\nDreamWeaver take control.\n\n304\n00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.980\n>> Well Jim, we appreciate having you\nhere, we appreciate that information, we\n\n305\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.620\nappreciate you the viewer, but we're gonna\ngo ahead and sign out here at ITProTV.\n\n306\n00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.840\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n307\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.250\n>> And I'm Jim Sorrells.\n\n308\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.717\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n309\n00:18:11.717 --> 00:18:19.559\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Bryan.\n\n3\n00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.091\nAnd in today's episode we're coming\nback at you with more DreamWeaver.\n\n4\n00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:24.450\nThat's right, we are continuing\nalong in our Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.900\nJoining me back in the studios today\nis none other than Mr. Jim Searles.\n\n6\n00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.390\nJim, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.700\n>> I'm doing great Wes, thanks for having\nme back and thank you to the ITProTV team\n\n8\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.290\nfor welcoming me back to\ntalk about Dreamweaver.\n\n9\n00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.050\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\ntalk about creating a page\n\n10\n00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.460\nwithin the Dreamweaver application.\n\n11\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.990\nAnd in the last episode,\nwe talked about creating a site.\n\n12\n00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.200\nAnd I did create an index.html file, and\nwhat I'd like to do now is show you and\n\n13\n00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.430\ntalk about the semantics and\nthe structure behind that.\n\n14\n00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.090\nSo, what I like to do is go\nback to the application and\n\n15\n00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.870\ngo to the bottom right hand corner.\n\n16\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.060\nAnd inside the Files panel,\nI'm going to click on the index.html.\n\n17\n00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.410\nSo, I'm gonna double-click here and\nopen that up.\n\n18\n00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.840\nSo, what you're gonna see here\nis in the document workspace,\n\n19\n00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.250\nthis area out here to the left, okay.\n\n20\n00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.760\nWhat you're seeing is basically is\nthe design view of this application.\n\n21\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.030\nSo, I've opened the index.html,\nbut there's nothing here.\n\n22\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.860\nSo it's completely blank.\n\n23\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.480\nAnd what that means is\nit's a blank canvas.\n\n24\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.600\nIt's waiting for you to do something.\n\n25\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.610\nHowever, in previous episodes you may\nhave seen that code view was selected, so\n\n26\n00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.970\nin the code view you can see there's\na lot going on inside the code.\n\n27\n00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.200\nSo, how is it that if there's\na lot going on in the code,\n\n28\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.680\nthere's really nothing in the design.\n\n29\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.720\nThat's because technically when you create\na page within Dreamweaver, it says,\n\n30\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.700\nhey, I know what's coming but I don't\nknow the content you are gonna work with.\n\n31\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.210\nSo what it does is,\nit creates the structure that you need but\n\n32\n00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.800\nit leaves everything the blank canvas for\nyou to work on.\n\n33\n00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.970\nSo I'd like to talk about that structure\nbehind the scenes, just so you understand.\n\n34\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.990\nIt's important to know that Dreamweaver\nlets you work in an environment that is\n\n35\n00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.170\nalmost free of having to write code.\n\n36\n00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.980\nBut it's always a good idea to understand\nwhat's going on in the code so\n\n37\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.190\nthis way you can build your pages and\n\n38\n00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.650\ncorrect mistakes that might happen\nbased on what Dreamweaver's doing.\n\n39\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.460\nOr not doing that you want it to do,\nand that's gonna be important.\n\n40\n00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.450\nSo I'm gonna start here in\nthe code view for a moment.\n\n41\n00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.440\nSo, I'm gonna click on this\ncode button and toggle that on.\n\n42\n00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.830\nSo, when we look at the code,\n\n43\n00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.160\nyou first see here out to the left\nthat there are all these numbers.\n\n44\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.130\nSo the code that's written in HTML, hyper\ntext markup language is linear based,\n\n45\n00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.520\nmeans it starts at line one and\nworks it's way down to the bottom.\n\n46\n00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.355\nOkay It's very linear.\n\n47\n00:02:45.355 --> 00:02:48.879\nThere's other programming languages\nthat are known as object-oriented, and\n\n48\n00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.525\nobject-oriented allows you to write\n\n49\n00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:55.115\nmodular code sections that\ncan be called up at any time.\n\n50\n00:02:55.115 --> 00:02:58.600\nSo it's not necessarily going to\nexecute it from top to bottom.\n\n51\n00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.660\nWe'll talk more about that when\nwe get to cascading style sheets.\n\n52\n00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.680\nBut the point here is, is I can see by\nthe numbers that the doc type here HTML\n\n53\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.920\nis the first item on the line.\n\n54\n00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.045\nAnd what you're seeing here,\nas well as that Dreamweaver\n\n55\n00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:16.085\nis providing a color code to let\nyou determine what's going on.\n\n56\n00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:19.085\nSo, when I look at this aqua or\nthis teal color,\n\n57\n00:03:19.085 --> 00:03:22.923\nthis is telling me the element\nthat I am working with, okay.\n\n58\n00:03:22.923 --> 00:03:27.887\nSo basically doc type is\nthe HTML5 element that declares to\n\n59\n00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:32.042\nthe browser what type\nof code you're using.\n\n60\n00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:35.850\nSo the browser sees this and\nsays, it's HTML5.\n\n61\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.030\nNow if you ever wanted to\nconfigure a HTML 4.01 or\n\n62\n00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.230\nas XHTML transitional file you would\nsee that this doc type is a huge mess.\n\n63\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.670\nLuckily for us HTML5 has been simplified\nand this line is now really done well.\n\n64\n00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.480\nSo this element includes this less\nthan and greater than sign, okay.\n\n65\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.930\nSo that includes or encompasses\nthe entire element of code that we need.\n\n66\n00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.300\nThe fact here that it\nsays that this is HTML,\n\n67\n00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.260\nagain identifies the type of\ndocument you are working with.\n\n68\n00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.857\nSo !doctype html declares HTML5.\n\n69\n00:04:14.857 --> 00:04:20.550\nEverything else below that is\nbasically a container for the webpage.\n\n70\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.480\nSo when I look at this HTML tag on line 2,\n\n71\n00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.620\nI see that there's\na matching tag on line 10.\n\n72\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.170\nAnd the matching tag is\na little bit different for\n\n73\n00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.520\nthe closing tag, but\nit's very much the same.\n\n74\n00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.110\nSo it starts with the less\nthan sign here on line two.\n\n75\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.380\nAnd greater than sign and\nthe HTML element is in between, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.950\nHowever, when you close it off,\nyou do a less than sign, slash and\n\n77\n00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.680\nthen HTML, greater than.\n\n78\n00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.470\nNow, again,\nDreamweaver knows the rules for this code.\n\n79\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.460\nSo because of that It is\nautomatically doing it for you.\n\n80\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.320\nNow this HTML container says,\n\n81\n00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.430\neverything that follows is going\nto be part of the webpage.\n\n82\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.850\nSo it says this is the container for\neverything.\n\n83\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.180\nNow, we go to line three and we see\nthat we have this head element, okay.\n\n84\n00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.320\nThe head element is the header\nportion of your webpage.\n\n85\n00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.760\nSo I start here on line three, and\nin this case I end on line six.\n\n86\n00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.810\nSo again, the opening has the less\nthan sign, head, greater than, but\n\n87\n00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.330\nthe closing has less than sign,\nslash, greater than.\n\n88\n00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.400\nSo what that means is,\n\n89\n00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.730\neverything in between that is going to\ndeclare itself to your web browser.\n\n90\n00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.480\nThe browser can see it,\nthe web crawlers can see it.\n\n91\n00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.410\nThis is where you might wanna\nadd some content for you SEO,\n\n92\n00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.200\nyour Search Engine Optimization.\n\n93\n00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.770\nThis is where you gonna try to make it so\nGoogle can see you and\n\n94\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.910\nthat Google will start itemizing\nyour items on their list so\n\n95\n00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.943\nthey can start indexing you and\nfinding you out on the web, okay.\n\n96\n00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.230\nSo the head provides that\ninformation to the browser.\n\n97\n00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.920\nThe browser then passes it on to the web\ncrawlers and that kind of thing.\n\n98\n00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.430\nSo this meta tag is basically\na tag that provides information.\n\n99\n00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.951\nWhen we talk about metadata, we're talking\nabout extra information that is passed\n\n100\n00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:14.173\non to the browser and in this particular\ncase, this is a character set UTF-8.\n\n101\n00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:19.374\nIt's basically the Western character set\nused by us here in the United States for\n\n102\n00:06:19.374 --> 00:06:22.070\nour English characters or English text.\n\n103\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.860\nLine five, on the other hand, has a title.\n\n104\n00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.010\nThis is the title that we use\nto identify to the browser\n\n105\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.590\nwhat the title of the page is.\n\n106\n00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.100\nSo for example, if you've ever\nsurfed out to the Internet, and\n\n107\n00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.310\nyou've gone to Google.com, for\nexample, on the tab on your browser it\n\n108\n00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.700\nmight say Google and\nit might have other information.\n\n109\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.450\nYou can type whatever you want here.\n\n110\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.710\nTypically you wanna brand your\nsite with whatever the name is and\n\n111\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.790\nthen you might wanna\ninclude extra information.\n\n112\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:53.220\nSo for example, this is the home page so\nyou could say, whatever your site name is,\n\n113\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.350\nand then put something to identify it,\na dash or whatever and then say home page.\n\n114\n00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.630\nOr if the about us page, or\n\n115\n00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.680\nthe careers page,\nyou might identify that inside the title.\n\n116\n00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.760\nAnd then lastly, we close out the head.\n\n117\n00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.450\nSo this is a container that\ncontains all of this information.\n\n118\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.940\nNext, line 8.\n\n119\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.700\nLine 8 and line 9 are the HTML\nelements for the body tag.\n\n120\n00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.050\nAnd the body is where all of the content\nresides that's visible to the user.\n\n121\n00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.410\nSo, when you, the user,\n\n122\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.790\nare surfing the Internet,\nthis is where you see everything.\n\n123\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.420\nThis is the meat and\npotatoes of what you see on the web, okay.\n\n124\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.950\nYou won't see any of this stuff except for\nthe title.\n\n125\n00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.760\nYou'll see that on the tab\nof the browser but\n\n126\n00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.350\nthe content of the web\npage is inside the body.\n\n127\n00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.798\nAgain, we have an open body tag, <body>.\n\n128\n00:07:42.798 --> 00:07:45.780\nAnd then it's closed off\nwith the </body here, okay..\n\n129\n00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.480\nDreamweaver knows that in\norder to have a web page,\n\n130\n00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.000\nyou need to have all of these elements.\n\n131\n00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.459\nAnd therefore it creates it for\nyou every time.\n\n132\n00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:58.671\nAs a matter of fact, we created\nanother page called About Us and\n\n133\n00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:02.442\nif I double-click on that,\nyou'll see it's the exact same structure.\n\n134\n00:08:02.442 --> 00:08:07.140\nSo basically Dreamweaver is saying to you,\nit's saying, hey I'm going to create this\n\n135\n00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.760\npage, all you need to do,\nit's a blank canvas, is add some content.\n\n136\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.360\nAnd what I'd like to show you is is that\nI can add content in the design view.\n\n137\n00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.430\nBut before I do that,\nI want to talk about another button.\n\n138\n00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.500\nThere's a Split button here in the middle.\n\n139\n00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.400\nOkay, so in the document when do I\nhave the ability to see the split.\n\n140\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.670\nAnd what Split does is, it lets me view\nthe code while I'm viewing the design.\n\n141\n00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.620\nSo I can literally watch as I\nadd elements to the design.\n\n142\n00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.860\nI could see the code that\nis written by Dreamweaver.\n\n143\n00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.300\nAnd that's important if you're trying\nto learn how to write HTML and\n\n144\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.620\nif you're trying to learn all of this.\n\n145\n00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.520\nLet the system work for you.\n\n146\n00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.580\nLet the program do the coding and\nyou just do the designing.\n\n147\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.940\nAnd then, the other item I'd like to\ntalk about in this bar at the top\n\n148\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.740\nis the fact that in Design I have this\nlittle pulldown, which will literally\n\n149\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:01.290\nlet me choose to see what the web page\nmight look like in the real world.\n\n150\n00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.420\nNow, it tries to render it as\nclosely as possible to how your\n\n151\n00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.350\nbrowser is going to render the design.\n\n152\n00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.630\nIt doesn't always get it right, so we do\nhave the opportunity to view our designs\n\n153\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:17.872\nin web pages and we can choose\nwhich browser we're going to use.\n\n154\n00:09:17.872 --> 00:09:22.300\nNow, it's important to keep in mind, that\nwhen you are designing websites that you\n\n155\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.980\nhave as many browsers\ninstalled as possible.\n\n156\n00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.260\nBecause you want to see\nthe user experience,\n\n157\n00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.448\nyou want to see the user experience\nfrom every possible angle.\n\n158\n00:09:31.448 --> 00:09:36.920\nWhen I use a Mac, the only browser I don't\nhave available to me is Internet Explorer,\n\n159\n00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.960\nand so I'll log into a boot camp or\nparallels and\n\n160\n00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.990\ngo into Internet Explorer just\nto see how the site looks.\n\n161\n00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.220\nBut other than that, I’m using Opera,\nI’m using Safari, I’m using Firefox.\n\n162\n00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.150\nI'm using Chrome, I'm using multiple\nversions of these items because the older\n\n163\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.400\nthe browser sometimes it doesn't render\nyour designs the way you expect and\n\n164\n00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.990\nyou have to account for that.\n\n165\n00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.370\nSo as a developer you need\nto keep that in mind.\n\n166\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.550\nOkay so live view will try to\ngive you a close approximation\n\n167\n00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.230\nas to what it's going to look like.\n\n168\n00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.670\nI will tell you right now,\n\n169\n00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:14.360\nDesign View will more often than\nnot give you nothing that resembles\n\n170\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.230\nwhat the website is gonna look like\nwhen you're in your final stages, okay?\n\n171\n00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.930\nThat's because the Design View\nof Dreamweaver\n\n172\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.770\nuses an old rendering software.\n\n173\n00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.270\nNow they are trying to fix that with\na live view, the fact that you click live\n\n174\n00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.320\nand it will render out your JavaScript,\nit will render out your CSS styles,\n\n175\n00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.385\nit will render out everything that\nyou might have available to you and\n\n176\n00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:40.975\nas a matter of fact it makes your links\nclickable, it makes your transitions and\n\n177\n00:10:40.975 --> 00:10:43.965\nyour JavaScript work, so\nyour animations are there.\n\n178\n00:10:43.965 --> 00:10:44.695\nThat kind of thing.\n\n179\n00:10:44.695 --> 00:10:47.392\nLive View does a lot of that rendering for\nyou.\n\n180\n00:10:47.392 --> 00:10:51.322\nAnd Design just says, you know what, I'm\ngonna show you what the layout looks like.\n\n181\n00:10:51.322 --> 00:10:52.012\nI'm gonna show you,\n\n182\n00:10:52.012 --> 00:10:55.202\ngive you an approximation of\nwhere things are gonna go.\n\n183\n00:10:55.202 --> 00:10:58.002\nBut you need to check me out in browser or\n\n184\n00:10:58.002 --> 00:11:01.352\nyou need to click live view if\nthat's what you're gonna do, okay.\n\n185\n00:11:01.352 --> 00:11:03.979\nSo, these are the options that\nare available in our document window.\n\n186\n00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.190\nNow, I'm gonna choose\njust to do Design for\n\n187\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.780\nnow and we're not gonna\nworry about the code, okay?\n\n188\n00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:18.420\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm going to show\nyou the insert panel across the top, okay?\n\n189\n00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.940\nSo all of these icons up here at the top.\n\n190\n00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.710\nAnd you'll see that I have a HTML tab.\n\n191\n00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.660\nA Form tab,\nwhich will let me add form controls.\n\n192\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.970\nA Templates tab,\nwhich will help me work with templates and\n\n193\n00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.480\nthe editable regions within a template.\n\n194\n00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.780\nThe Bootstrap Components.\n\n195\n00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.590\nBootstrap is basically for\nyour responsive design.\n\n196\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.040\nThe jQuery mobile.\n\n197\n00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.900\nThis is so you that way you\ncan work with the platform for\n\n198\n00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.500\nJavaScript, and jQuery is just\nanother platform for that, and\n\n199\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.325\nbasically it lets you work\nwith a mobile responsiveness.\n\n200\n00:11:56.325 --> 00:12:00.120\nJQuery User Interface, and\nthen you've got Favorites here on the end.\n\n201\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.190\nSo Favorites is basically where you're\ngonna build your own standard toolbar, and\n\n202\n00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:08.062\nyou're gonna have the tools available\nthat you might use most often.\n\n203\n00:12:08.062 --> 00:12:09.920\nWe're gonna spend some\ntime here in the HTML,\n\n204\n00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.320\nbecause this is where we're going\nto add HTML elements to our design.\n\n205\n00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.632\nNow we're going to talk\nabout this Insert panel,\n\n206\n00:12:16.632 --> 00:12:19.397\nand we're gonna work with\nthe HTML elements in our design.\n\n207\n00:12:19.397 --> 00:12:24.090\nWe're gonna design our index.html file,\nso let me go back to that real quick.\n\n208\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.870\nSo I'm in the design view of index.\n\n209\n00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.530\nAgain, aboutus and\nindex right now look the same,\n\n210\n00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.590\nthey're both blank slates ready for\nme to do something.\n\n211\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.250\nAnd then I'm also gonna\ntalk about the document\n\n212\n00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.120\nobject model in the bottom\nright-hand corner.\n\n213\n00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.220\nSo where I have my files panel down here\nat the bottom right hand corner I also\n\n214\n00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.160\nhave the DOM panel.\n\n215\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.904\nThe DOM panel shows me what\nthe structure of the page is and\n\n216\n00:12:45.904 --> 00:12:50.662\nyou can see right away the basic structure\nof this page is to have your HTML\n\n217\n00:12:50.662 --> 00:12:54.570\ncontainer, your head container and\nyour body container.\n\n218\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.927\nSo these are the containers that\ncontain the information that\n\n219\n00:12:56.927 --> 00:12:57.930\nare currently in my code.\n\n220\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.860\nAnd as a matter of fact look at Head.\n\n221\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:06.250\nHead literally is showing us that it\nhas multiple tags inside of there.\n\n222\n00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.040\nSo if I click on that it expands it out.\n\n223\n00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.830\nIf I click on it again it collapses.\n\n224\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.640\nI can see that there's sort\nof a triple effect here and\n\n225\n00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.250\nthat's telling me that there\nare items inside of that tag.\n\n226\n00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.050\nSo if I click on that again,\nit expands it out and\n\n227\n00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.550\nthose are the two tags that\nare inside of their HTML tags.\n\n228\n00:13:22.832 --> 00:13:25.810\nOkay, whereas Body has none because\nwe haven't written anything yet,\n\n229\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.300\nwe haven't inserted anything.\n\n230\n00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.860\nAs a matter of fact, when I start\ninserting into the design window,\n\n231\n00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.260\nit will always go inside the body.\n\n232\n00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.770\nAnd that's where your design goes,\nis inside the body, invisible to the user.\n\n233\n00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:46.250\nSo to start, I'd like to add,\nin this example, a division to my page.\n\n234\n00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:51.090\nA division is basically\na tag called the div tag and\n\n235\n00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.610\nit creates a content section on your page.\n\n236\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.370\nSo I'm going to click Division here.\n\n237\n00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.440\nAnd literally it's gonna come\nup with this dialogue box.\n\n238\n00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.540\nAgain, I don't have to know anything\nabout programming or code, and\n\n239\n00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.930\nI just need to answer\na couple of questions.\n\n240\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.380\nAnd so, the first question is,\nwhere do I want to insert this division?\n\n241\n00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.337\nIt says do I want to wrap\naround the selected tag?\n\n242\n00:14:12.337 --> 00:14:16.500\nIn this case, I don't necessarily want\nit to wrap around the selected tag.\n\n243\n00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.810\nI might want to put it after\na particular tag has started, or\n\n244\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.960\nI might want to put it before\nthe end of a particular tag.\n\n245\n00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.080\nSo, for example, if I choose before end\nof a particular tag, it's gonna say,\n\n246\n00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.220\nwell, the body is where\nyou're putting this.\n\n247\n00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.520\nSo do you want me to put this\nbefore the body tag finishes?\n\n248\n00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.280\nAnd guess what your division\nshould be within the body tag.\n\n249\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.620\nSo I would want to put it\nbefore the body tag ends.\n\n250\n00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:43.170\nSo I can choose that option, and\nthen I can specify some styling.\n\n251\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:47.150\nWe're not ready to talk about styling yet,\nbut the dialogue box allows me to choose\n\n252\n00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.930\nmy styling on the fly and\nit allows me to apply styling as I go.\n\n253\n00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.550\nAgain I'm gonna actually add to this.\n\n254\n00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.650\nI'm gonna add an ID style and\nI'm gonna call this a wrapper.\n\n255\n00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:03.180\nA wrapper is basically\na division that contains\n\n256\n00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.930\nmy web page and will allow me to make sure\nthat it's always centered to the browser.\n\n257\n00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.900\nSo it lets me choose left,\nright, up, and down centering.\n\n258\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.070\nAnd it makes the page always\nperform in the center.\n\n259\n00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.900\n>> So Jim, with that insert option right\nthere, it's intuitive enough to know that,\n\n260\n00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.390\nif you make a selection,\nit's gonna give you the option that's\n\n261\n00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.610\nmost relevant to the selection\nthat you've made.\n\n262\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:24.940\n>> That's absolutely correct.\n\n263\n00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.200\nSo when it said,\nwrap around the selection, it said, okay,\n\n264\n00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.620\nwell, whatever you've got selected,\nI'm going to wrap that division around it.\n\n265\n00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.080\nSo you could have selected your\nobjects in the design window and\n\n266\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.485\nthen told the tag to wrap around that\ngrouping that you've selected, so\n\n267\n00:15:39.485 --> 00:15:41.750\nyou're absolutely right\nits dynamic in that way.\n\n268\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.452\nSo at this point, I've created an ID.\n\n269\n00:15:43.452 --> 00:15:46.800\nWere gonna talk more about what class and\nID are in another episode, but\n\n270\n00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.070\nI want you to understand here that\nwe're gonna use ID for this division.\n\n271\n00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.454\nAnd I'm gonna click OK.\n\n272\n00:15:53.454 --> 00:15:57.146\nWhen I do that you now see content for\nID wrapper goes here, and\n\n273\n00:15:57.146 --> 00:16:01.832\nthe reason why is saying that is because\nchoose the ID of wrapper for the name And\n\n274\n00:16:01.832 --> 00:16:05.386\nthis dotted line is the division\nthat we've just created.\n\n275\n00:16:05.386 --> 00:16:10.071\nAs a matter of fact, if I look at my\ndocument object model panel down here\n\n276\n00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:14.754\nin the bottom right hand corner,\nyou will see that we have the div tag and\n\n277\n00:16:14.754 --> 00:16:18.560\ninside that it's written\nan attribute of ID = wrapper.\n\n278\n00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.200\nI would like to show you what that\nlooks like in the code as well Wes.\n\n279\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.190\nSo if I go here to the code view, you will\nnow see that it is written on line nine,\n\n280\n00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.330\nwhich is in between the body tag.\n\n281\n00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.060\nIt's inside the body container and\n\n282\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.400\nit has literally written this\ndivision called ID wrapper.\n\n283\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.970\nThere is the text that is visible to\nthe user and there is the closing element.\n\n284\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:39.470\nOkay?\n\n285\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.570\nSo it wrote that for me.\n\n286\n00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.480\nI didn't have to do it.\n\n287\n00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.280\nI just needed to say insert that.\n\n288\n00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.160\nAll right.\n\n289\n00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.360\nSo I'm gonna go back to Design View.\n\n290\n00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.000\nAnd I would like a couple of\nother divisions here, but\n\n291\n00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.520\nthe divisions I'm gonna use\nare gonna be HTML5 divisions.\n\n292\n00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:59.520\nAnd HTML5 doesn't just give me a division,\nit also gives me a name.\n\n293\n00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.410\nSo for example, an HTML5 division for\nthe header where you put your logo and\n\n294\n00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:09.640\nyour branding on your website is called\nthe header, literally called the header.\n\n295\n00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:15.610\nSo right here on my insert toolbar I\nhave a header, a tag that I can apply.\n\n296\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.970\nThen I have the ability to add navigation.\n\n297\n00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.340\nSo HTML5 again, very useful.\n\n298\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.580\nIn the past, we had to create divisions.\n\n299\n00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.100\nGive them ID names,\n\n300\n00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.990\ncall it the head, call it the nav,\ncall it the main, call it the footer.\n\n301\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.690\nOkay?\n\n302\n00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.450\nToday we don't have to do that,\n\n303\n00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.840\nwe just have to select the appropriate\ntag that's written in HTML5 for that.\n\n304\n00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.030\n>> So not as manual,\nI was gonna say not as manual now,\n\n305\n00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.150\ntoday it looks like its a point and\nclick technology and\n\n306\n00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.980\nyou don't have to, the complexities of\nentering that information manually.\n\n307\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.530\n>> That's a very good point Wes,\nthat's the point of a Dreamweaver\n\n308\n00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:54.100\nas an application to use for\nbuilding your websites.\n\n309\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.930\nIs that it makes things a little more\nautomatic, a little more intuitive.\n\n310\n00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.720\nCuz we all know what the header is,\nit usually goes at top of something.\n\n311\n00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.840\nWe all know what the footer is,\nif I go right over here to the end.\n\n312\n00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.820\nYou'll see that the footer is a division\nthat I can add that's created for\n\n313\n00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.220\nHTML 5, okay?\n\n314\n00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.180\nNow there's a couple of other\nones that I'd like to talk about,\n\n315\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.740\nthere's the main content section,\nwhich I had mentioned, and\n\n316\n00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.730\nthen you have an aside and\nyou have an article and a section.\n\n317\n00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.300\nNow, an aside is basically,\nif you ever went to a blog site, and\n\n318\n00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.470\nyou have all the archives of blogs\nthat are there, with the dates.\n\n319\n00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.920\nThat's where the aside goes.\n\n320\n00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.490\nSo it goes to the left or\nto the right of the page, and\n\n321\n00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.940\nit specifies certain information,\n\n322\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:40.050\nwhereas an article is literally where the\nmain writeup of your information might go.\n\n323\n00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.590\nSo you're gonna use the article tag for\nthat.\n\n324\n00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:47.230\nAnd then a section, you can create\nsections within your divisions in order\n\n325\n00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:51.870\nto be able to section off your content and\ndecide how that layout's going to be.\n\n326\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.240\nSo at this point, I've got my content for\n\n327\n00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.370\nID wrapper goes here, and it's in black,\nwhich means it's selected.\n\n328\n00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:02.580\nIf I click at the end, then my purse\nis down at the end of that information.\n\n329\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.570\nSo what I'd like to do is insert\nthe header at the top of that so\n\n330\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.520\nI really don't want this text.\n\n331\n00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.420\nI'm gonna select the text and I'm gonna\nhit the Delete key on the keyboard or\n\n332\n00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.745\nBackspace so the text is gone but\nthe division remains.\n\n333\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:22.470\nNow I'm gonna click on the header, and\nI get the same dialog box that I did for\n\n334\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:27.280\ndivision which is good because now\nit says, insert at insertion point.\n\n335\n00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.830\nIt knows that in the design\nI've placed my cursor and\n\n336\n00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.860\nI had a flashing cursor\ninside that division.\n\n337\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.770\nAnd it's gonna insert right at that spot.\n\n338\n00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.040\nAnd that's what I want.\n\n339\n00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.610\nI want to have the header\nsection right there.\n\n340\n00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.930\nNow, because it's already called header,\nI don't necessarily need an ID or a class.\n\n341\n00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.240\nIf I'm going to style this later on, yeah,\nthat might be a good idea to name it, or\n\n342\n00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.760\nto give it a class or an ID, and\nwe'll talk a little more about that later.\n\n343\n00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.060\nAgain, I apologize.\n\n344\n00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.490\nBut I'm just gonna click OK because\nI already know it's the header and\n\n345\n00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.930\nI can style the header\nbased on the name header.\n\n346\n00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.600\nWe'll talk more about that as well.\n\n347\n00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.900\nLet me click OK.\n\n348\n00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.510\nSo at this point it says, content for\nnew header tag goes here.\n\n349\n00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.860\nNow here's what interesting, it looks like\nits in the same spot as that division.\n\n350\n00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.890\nSo it looks like I\ndidn't add anything new.\n\n351\n00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.400\nBut again if I go look\nin the code view window.\n\n352\n00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.790\nYou'll see I still have my division,\nmy div tag.\n\n353\n00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.060\nI have the wrapper, and\nthen headers right inside of that.\n\n354\n00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.910\nSo this header element is right\ninside of the division container.\n\n355\n00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.890\nAs a matter of fact,\nDreamweaver has indented the code\n\n356\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.260\nto tell you that this resides\ninside of the div element.\n\n357\n00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.380\nLiterally does it for you.\n\n358\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.830\nOkay, so wanna go back to design.\n\n359\n00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.040\nNow, in this example,\nI would like to have the next item.\n\n360\n00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.950\nCuz we usually have a header at the top,\n\n361\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.840\nthen we have a navigation\nsystem right below it, right?\n\n362\n00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:48.280\nSo, I'd like the next tag to go after\nthe end of the header, for example.\n\n363\n00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.880\nI don't want,\nthe navigation to be inside that,\n\n364\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.320\nor I'd like it to be right after that,\nso that's a very good point.\n\n365\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.800\nSo I'm gonna come over here,\nand click on my Navigation.\n\n366\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.190\nIt's gonna say at insertion point, but\nagain I can click the pull down here, and\n\n367\n00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:07.070\nI can say, before the tag, after the start\nof a tag, before the end of the tag or\n\n368\n00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:08.280\nafter a tag.\n\n369\n00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.170\nWell if I choose after a tag,\nfor example here, it's gonna say,\n\n370\n00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.569\ndo you want it after the division?\n\n371\n00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.350\nAnd in this case it's gonna\nput it after the division.\n\n372\n00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.890\nSo you know what?\n\n373\n00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.510\nI'm gonna choose before end of division\n\n374\n00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.120\nwhich means it's gonna put\nit right after the header.\n\n375\n00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.430\nSo I'm gonna come over here.\n\n376\n00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.610\nAnd I'm gonna choose\nthe Before End of tag.\n\n377\n00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:27.850\nAnd hopefully it gives\nme the division option.\n\n378\n00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:28.400\nWhich it does.\n\n379\n00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.190\nSo I click on that.\n\n380\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:35.040\nAnd now that means I'm gonna have header\nfirst then I'm going to have second and\n\n381\n00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.260\nthen their both gonna be inside\nof the division for the wrapper.\n\n382\n00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.560\nSo I click OK and\nnow you can see it's laid out in this way.\n\n383\n00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.280\nThe header at the top then below\nit if I look at the code view\n\n384\n00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.070\nthere both inside of the.\n\n385\n00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:53.130\nOkay so we're going to keep building\nthe next section usually we have,\n\n386\n00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.780\nafter the navigation, is we usually\nput the main content section.\n\n387\n00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.550\nSo I'm just gonna do a main for\nthis point in time, and,\n\n388\n00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:03.020\nagain, just clicking on these\nicons inside the insert panel\n\n389\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.040\nmakes it very easy to build your layout,\nwithout even having to think about it.\n\n390\n00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.710\nSo, I'm gonna click on this item.\n\n391\n00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.440\nIt's gonna say wrap around the selection.\n\n392\n00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.510\nI had text selected.\n\n393\n00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.650\nSo that is what it's saying.\n\n394\n00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:13.500\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n395\n00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:18.900\nRemember, I wanna go after they are, I am\nsorry, before the end of the division.\n\n396\n00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.990\nSo, when I say, before end of tag and\n\n397\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:26.240\nI'm gonna choose the div wrapper and\nnow this should be the third item.\n\n398\n00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.710\nSo, now, I'm gonna have a stack,\nheader, nav and then main.\n\n399\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:30.670\nOkay.\n\n400\n00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.310\nSo, next thing I'd like to do,\njust for this example, so for\n\n401\n00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.050\nour conversation, is to add the footer.\n\n402\n00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.890\nSo, to add the footer, I'm gonna go\nover here and click on my footer item.\n\n403\n00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.560\nAgain, the text was selected so\n\n404\n00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.920\nit's automatically choosing\nwrap around selection.\n\n405\n00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.260\nI'm going to click the pull-down,\nchoose before the end of tag.\n\n406\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.800\nAnd lastly I'm going to choose that I\nneed to use the division ID wrapper and\n\n407\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.890\nput it before that.\n\n408\n00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.100\nI click OK.\n\n409\n00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.020\nAnd now I've got my stack of four\nitems that I can start designing and\n\n410\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.140\nworking with, and I've got the layout.\n\n411\n00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.550\nSo the basic configuration of header,\nnav, main, and\n\n412\n00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.890\nfooter is how all web pages are designed.\n\n413\n00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:07.950\nDesign, believe it or not.\n\n414\n00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.240\nThat's like the secret sauce.\n\n415\n00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.860\nYou look at these web pages and\nyou see a lot of content going on.\n\n416\n00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.480\nBut typically, all it is, is the branding\nat the top, you've got some form of\n\n417\n00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.460\nnavigation that people can click on,\nyou've got the main content.\n\n418\n00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.210\nNow, the main content, you might have\nto scroll down to see everything and\n\n419\n00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.000\nit might have a lot of\ninformation in there.\n\n420\n00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.670\nBut once you get to the bottom,\n\n421\n00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.180\nyou'll always see the footer\nthat shows the copyright, or\n\n422\n00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:37.340\nthey might have a site map, or they might\nprovide you with a lot more information.\n\n423\n00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.050\nSo there's a lot going on there.\n\n424\n00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:44.220\nSo that's the basic structure for\nany website that you're working with.\n\n425\n00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.020\nAnd at this point, I'm ready to save this.\n\n426\n00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.253\nSo I'm gonna just do a Ctrl+S on the PC or\nCmd+S on the Mac and\n\n427\n00:23:52.253 --> 00:23:57.817\nyou're gonna see that asterisk goes\naway and I've just saved the file, okay?\n\n428\n00:23:57.817 --> 00:23:59.806\n>> Jim, before we started the episode,\n\n429\n00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:03.113\none of the things we were talking\nabout is looking at a website.\n\n430\n00:24:03.113 --> 00:24:07.232\nNow, when I navigate to a site I\ncould see sometimes, you know,\n\n431\n00:24:07.232 --> 00:24:09.650\nit's almost intuitive, right?\n\n432\n00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:10.820\nUse of the About Us, right?\n\n433\n00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.200\nIf I click on About Us,\nwhere is gonna take me?\n\n434\n00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.426\nWell, I'm hoping it's gonna open a page\nthat says About Us, and maybe some topics.\n\n435\n00:24:17.426 --> 00:24:20.330\nMaybe it's a pira, not piracy,\nhow about privacy, right?\n\n436\n00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.539\nWe have a privacy concern, you click on\nthat, it gives you a privacy statement and\n\n437\n00:24:24.539 --> 00:24:26.682\ncontact us, all of those common things.\n\n438\n00:24:26.682 --> 00:24:30.452\nNow, that's based on navigation and\nsometimes it's intuitive and\n\n439\n00:24:30.452 --> 00:24:34.423\nit's the other times I click on a site and\nI have no clue where it takes me.\n\n440\n00:24:34.423 --> 00:24:39.337\nSo when we're setting up a web site,\nis that something we have to take into\n\n441\n00:24:39.337 --> 00:24:44.050\nconsideration, how an end user is\ngonna navigate through that site?\n\n442\n00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.050\n>> Absolutely, that is a huge,\nhuge consideration.\n\n443\n00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:51.390\nWhenever you build a web page, it's always\nimportant that you understand the user\n\n444\n00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.605\ninterface and how users are going\nto interact with that page.\n\n445\n00:24:54.605 --> 00:24:58.795\nSo there's some guidelines that we\nwould use for navigation specifically.\n\n446\n00:24:58.795 --> 00:25:01.925\nFor example,\nyou wouldn't wanna have more than seven\n\n447\n00:25:01.925 --> 00:25:06.080\nnavigable items across the top for\npeople to find and click on.\n\n448\n00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.185\nThe other aspect to this is, you want no\nmore than two words in that navigation.\n\n449\n00:25:11.185 --> 00:25:14.345\nSo for example, you said About Us,\nthat's just two words.\n\n450\n00:25:14.345 --> 00:25:17.445\nOr you might have Careers, or you might\nhave News, or you might have Home or\n\n451\n00:25:17.445 --> 00:25:18.480\nsomething like that.\n\n452\n00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.460\nBut you wouldn't want to have an entire\nsentence that somebody has to click on for\n\n453\n00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.060\nnavigation.\n\n454\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:23.900\nThat just wouldn't work.\n\n455\n00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.080\nSo you want to minimize clutter\nup in your navigation, and\n\n456\n00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.560\nit needs to be as clean as possible.\n\n457\n00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.950\nYou mentioned getting lost, that's\nimportant, if you don't have a lot of\n\n458\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.980\nclutter, you're gonna make it so that\nway people can find what they need and\n\n459\n00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.150\nthey can navigate to\nwhere they need to go to.\n\n460\n00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.920\nSo these are really important\nconsiderations when it comes to\n\n461\n00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.490\nworking with navigation.\n\n462\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:48.030\nYou also want to avoid long drop downs.\n\n463\n00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.210\nThat's incredibly important,\n\n464\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.100\nbecause if somebody has to look through\na list when they grab the pull down\n\n465\n00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.610\nto find what they're looking for, again,\nyou're not making it user friendly.\n\n466\n00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:59.660\nAnd the other one is you want\nsome kind of call to action\n\n467\n00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.510\nto direct users to important\ninformation on your page.\n\n468\n00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:07.760\nSo those are some things that you might\nwanna include in your navigation, and\n\n469\n00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.430\nthose are some things that will make your\nsite very, very user friendly and useable.\n\n470\n00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:13.620\n>> That's all great information.\n\n471\n00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.930\nI'll tell you what, if it can make\nsomebody like me, who can go click happy,\n\n472\n00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.820\nlittle bit easier to navigate\nthrough the website.\n\n473\n00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.900\nAt the same time, I kind of know where I'm\ngoing ahead of time, that's always good.\n\n474\n00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.380\nWell Jim, thank you for\nall that information.\n\n475\n00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.640\nI know that we're coming to\nthe end of this episode, but\n\n476\n00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.040\nbefore we take the time to sign out,\ndo you have any additional information?\n\n477\n00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.340\n>> Yeah, thanks, Wes.\n\n478\n00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.910\nI do have some additional information.\n\n479\n00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:37.620\nI'd like to take a look at our code here,\n\n480\n00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.350\njust one last glance at\nit before we finish up.\n\n481\n00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:44.050\nAnd so I'm gonna click on code view and\nI just wanna show you again how we've laid\n\n482\n00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.910\nout that information, and\nhow it's all inside of the div wrapper.\n\n483\n00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.620\nAnd so basically,\nyou can see what that looks like.\n\n484\n00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.490\nAnd it's all contained,\nit's indented by Dreamweaver, so\n\n485\n00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.150\nthat way you can see where it's going.\n\n486\n00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.093\nAnd I'd like to also show you what this is\ngonna look like if I were to go to, for\n\n487\n00:27:00.093 --> 00:27:01.135\nexample live view.\n\n488\n00:27:01.135 --> 00:27:05.163\nSo if I go back to design here, you can\nsee the dashed lines around everything, so\n\n489\n00:27:05.163 --> 00:27:08.150\nif I click the pulldown here,\nand choose Live view, okay.\n\n490\n00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.110\nBasically it's just showing\nme the text that's there.\n\n491\n00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:15.130\nSo it's up to us at this point to\nreplace this text with our content.\n\n492\n00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.890\nAnd to start working with that,\nso technically you're not seeing\n\n493\n00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.220\nthe dashed lines for\nthe divisions that we've created.\n\n494\n00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.150\nAnd it's up to us to start using\ncascading style sheets to style these\n\n495\n00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:30.780\ncontent sections so they make more sense\nthan just what you see here in this page.\n\n496\n00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.260\n>> Well Jim, we do appreciate your\nknowledge on the subject there.\n\n497\n00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.150\nAnd we do appreciate you,\nthe viewer, for watching.\n\n498\n00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:39.170\nWe're gonna go ahead here and sign out at\nITProTV, I've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n499\n00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:40.070\n>> And I'm Jim Sorrells.\n\n500\n00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.690\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n501\n00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:50.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.554\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.554 --> 00:00:20.061\nwe're coming back at you\nwith more DreamWeaver.\n\n5\n00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:22.480\nThat's right, the Creative Cloud 2015,\n\n6\n00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.410\nand we're gonna be looking\nat styling with CSS.\n\n7\n00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.975\nI know what you're thinking, that's right,\nwe're gonna hit you with an acronym right\n\n8\n00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:32.935\nup front, but joining me in the studios\ntoday to help lend his expertise and\n\n9\n00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:35.765\ndefine what CSS means is none\nother than Mr. Jim Searles.\n\n10\n00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:36.895\nJim, how're you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:37.875\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:42.165\nAgain, thank you for having me here today,\nand thank you to the ITProTV team for\n\n13\n00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:45.095\nallowing me to talk about DreamWeaver,\nand specifically today,\n\n14\n00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:50.245\nto talk about these styles within\nDreamWeaver and cascading style sheets.\n\n15\n00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:53.500\nSo yes, CSS stands for\ncascading style sheets.\n\n16\n00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.620\nAnd basically what cascading\nstyles sheets allows you to do\n\n17\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.620\nis it allows you to determine\na hierarchy for your styles.\n\n18\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.290\nAnd the first thing I'd like to talk\nabout is the fact that you have\n\n19\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.690\nthree different type of style sheets.\n\n20\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.620\nSo you might have external style sheets,\n\n21\n00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.880\nwhere you point to a file that\ncontains a list of all your styles.\n\n22\n00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.570\nAnd this is how people share information,\nyou can actually share\n\n23\n00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.540\nstyles that you've used in the past from\ndifferent websites that you've created and\n\n24\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.130\nthen just keep reusing them.\n\n25\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.280\nSo external style sheets\nare very useful for that.\n\n26\n00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.460\nAlso, they're very useful for\napplying to multiple\n\n27\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.440\npages within your site because you can\nhave one source of all your styles and\n\n28\n00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.160\nall your pages access\nfrom that one source.\n\n29\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.260\nThe second type of style\nsheet is embedded styles.\n\n30\n00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.040\nEmbedded styles are embedded in\nthe header section of your documents.\n\n31\n00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.020\nSo in a previous episode, we talked about\nthe head section in our HTML code and\n\n32\n00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.410\nhow that passes the information\non to the browser.\n\n33\n00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.246\nWell, in this case, the information that's\npassing is how to stylize the webpage and\n\n34\n00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.360\nwhat content is gonna look like.\n\n35\n00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.010\nSo, that is embedded.\n\n36\n00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.150\nIt's embedded in a style\ntag in the header section.\n\n37\n00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.450\nAnd then the third style sheet that\nyou can have is the inline style.\n\n38\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.330\nNow, you might think, okay,\nthere are three levels of styles,\n\n39\n00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.180\nand one has to take\nprecedent over another.\n\n40\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.250\nAnd that's absolutely correct.\n\n41\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.670\nThe style that is closest to\nthe object that you're defining\n\n42\n00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.640\nhas the highest precedence.\n\n43\n00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.170\nThat means, for example, the inline\nstyle that is right inside of the tag or\n\n44\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.850\nthe element that you're working with\nis gonna have the highest precedence.\n\n45\n00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.640\nThen the next style that has the next\nlevel of precedence is the embedded style.\n\n46\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.270\nBecause it's also inside the same\npage of that website you're creating.\n\n47\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.240\nAnd then the last precedence or order of\nprecedence is the external style sheet.\n\n48\n00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.870\nHowever there's also an order of\nprecedence within the styles themselves.\n\n49\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.400\nSo as you start listing in your embedded,\nyou're gonna have a list of styles,\n\n50\n00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.390\nwhich ever one comes at the top\nis further away from the code, or\n\n51\n00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.150\nfurther away from the objects\nyou're working with.\n\n52\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.022\nTherefore, they might be overwritten\nby other styles within that list.\n\n53\n00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:02.800\nAnd same thing with your external styles,\nright?\n\n54\n00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.252\nYou're gonna have hundreds or thousands of\nstyles in that external style sheet and\n\n55\n00:03:07.252 --> 00:03:10.510\nthe order in which they're\nlisted makes a difference.\n\n56\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.590\nSo we gotta keep that in mind.\n\n57\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.760\nBut that's why they're called the cascade.\n\n58\n00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.310\nSo one style can inherit\nfrom other styles, and\n\n59\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.250\nthen you can change them\nup as you go down the list.\n\n60\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.970\nAnd that new style that you've defined\nin that list that has come further along\n\n61\n00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.170\nhas the highest precedence because it's\ncloser to the object that you're trying to\n\n62\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.490\nstylize.\n\n63\n00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.500\nSo, cascading style sheets,\nthree types of style sheets,\n\n64\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.500\nwe've got external, embedded, and inline.\n\n65\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.150\nWell, in a previous episode, we also\ntalked about the fact that when we created\n\n66\n00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.600\nour divisions, the header, nav,\nfooter, for example, we could assign\n\n67\n00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.850\nID selectors or class selectors.\n\n68\n00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.840\nAnd I said as a matter of fact,\nthat we didn't have to include the header,\n\n69\n00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.330\ndid not need to have a class or a ID\nbecause we could stylize the tag itself.\n\n70\n00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.340\nSo even within cascading style sheets,\n\n71\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.410\nthere are three type of selectors that\nallow you to create these styles.\n\n72\n00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.580\nNow let me explain what those are.\n\n73\n00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.160\nWhen we talk about the tag, we talk about\nthe HTML tags that are available to you,\n\n74\n00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.290\nand there are about 50 to about 75 tags.\n\n75\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.300\nAnd HTML is one of them,\nbody is another, header is another.\n\n76\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.410\nHead, nav, or navigation,\nsorry, footer is another.\n\n77\n00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.890\nSo all of these tags that we've\nused in previous episodes\n\n78\n00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.030\nare called HTML tags, and\nthose are available for us to style.\n\n79\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.020\nWe can apply a style to that tag.\n\n80\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.580\nWe can actually call it, we can say,\nhey, apply all these styles to the body.\n\n81\n00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.830\nSo if I wanted to, I could apply a style\nto the body that changes the background\n\n82\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.050\nto black, for example, and that'll work.\n\n83\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.330\nBut then, you have the class style.\n\n84\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.840\nThe class style is applied to\nobjects that might repeat or\n\n85\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.670\nmight have multiple instances of\nthat thicker object on your page.\n\n86\n00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.000\nSo for example,\nmaybe all the paragraphs on your page,\n\n87\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.990\nyou want to have a specific type of style.\n\n88\n00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.930\nOr you might have images that\nyou wanna stylize the same way,\n\n89\n00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.570\nso if it's maybe thumbnails that you're\ncreating, and you might want them to all\n\n90\n00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.120\nbe the same dimension, well,\nyou can use a class style to do that.\n\n91\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.620\nThe third selector type is the ID\nstyle type, or the ID selector.\n\n92\n00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.470\nThe ID selector can only\nbe used once per page, so\n\n93\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.830\nthey're usually reserved for\nthings like your content sections.\n\n94\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.080\nSo when we have our header,\nour navigation, our footer,\n\n95\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.080\nthose are usually only\ninstantiated once on your page.\n\n96\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.830\nSo, specifically, you have one header\non the page, you have one footer, and\n\n97\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.730\nyou have one main content section.\n\n98\n00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.780\nTherefore, you could create an ID that\nidentifies those and stylizes only those.\n\n99\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.610\nNow that doesn't mean that your About Us\npage couldn't have a header, a navigation,\n\n100\n00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.520\nand a footer and then you'd have\nan ID style that might affect that.\n\n101\n00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.220\nBut you can't have two headers on one\npage that you're stylizing with an ID.\n\n102\n00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.830\nID can only be used once per page,\nokay, so that's important.\n\n103\n00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.690\nNow, how do you identify\nthese types of selectors?\n\n104\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.890\nWell, a tag selector is very easy\nbecause it's the name that you're using.\n\n105\n00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.180\nSo it's gonna be body.\n\n106\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.900\nIt's going to be li for list item, or\n\n107\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.470\nol for an ordered list item,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n108\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.720\nSo those are tag names, and you can see,\nyou can apply a style to that tag name.\n\n109\n00:06:28.098 --> 00:06:29.240\nIf you're gonna use a class,\n\n110\n00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.980\nyou're always going to start\nthe class name with a period.\n\n111\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.910\nThe period determines that this is a class\nstyle that can be repeated over and\n\n112\n00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.560\nover again on your site.\n\n113\n00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.629\nAnd then lastly,\nthe ID style always starts with a hashtag,\n\n114\n00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:49.820\nthe pound sign, so\nit would be #main or #footer, or #nav.\n\n115\n00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.810\nOkay, those are the types\nof IDs you would use.\n\n116\n00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.040\nBut they always start with a hashtag.\n\n117\n00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.228\nSo to have this conversation and\nto bring it all to full circle,\n\n118\n00:06:59.228 --> 00:07:02.177\nI'd like to go back into\nthe design that we were creating,\n\n119\n00:07:02.177 --> 00:07:04.667\nwhere we had just created\nour content sections.\n\n120\n00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:09.496\nAnd I'd like to draw our attention this\ntime into the upper right corner of our\n\n121\n00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:13.260\npanels, where we have\nour CSS Designer panel.\n\n122\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.420\nNow in order to fully realize\nthe CSS Designer panel,\n\n123\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.930\nI'd like to expand this one out.\n\n124\n00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.690\nNow it's gonna take a little bit of our\ndocument work space away from us, but\n\n125\n00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.370\nI really wanna focus on this because right\nnow, everything is stacked all together.\n\n126\n00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.612\nSo for example, I have this All button and\nthis Current button, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:30.612 --> 00:07:31.850\nIt lets me switch to whether or\n\n128\n00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.815\nnot I'm gonna see all\nthe styles within my website.\n\n129\n00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:37.790\nOr I'm gonna see just the current styles\nthat are available to me based on my\n\n130\n00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.590\nselections, so it dynamically changes.\n\n131\n00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.770\nThen you have the sources.\n\n132\n00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.370\nAre you pulling from an external style?\n\n133\n00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.350\nDo you have embedded styles, or\nare you working with inline styles?\n\n134\n00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.065\nSo that's where your sources come from.\n\n135\n00:07:48.065 --> 00:07:51.635\n@media is for your responsive design.\n\n136\n00:07:51.635 --> 00:07:54.496\nSo these are at @media queries,\nand basically,\n\n137\n00:07:54.496 --> 00:07:57.291\nthey're going to test your\nsite to see whether or\n\n138\n00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:01.447\nnot the user They're gonna test the users\ndisplay to see whether or not it\n\n139\n00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:06.110\nshould change the design based on the\nsize, the width and height of the display.\n\n140\n00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.880\nWe also have our selectors options here\nwhich talks about is the class selected?\n\n141\n00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.900\nIs the tag selected?\n\n142\n00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.130\nOr is it an ID selector?\n\n143\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.030\nSo you can see a list of those\nwhen you start building it up.\n\n144\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.600\nAnd then lastly we have\nthe properties section.\n\n145\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.220\nAnd the properties section is going\nto show a lot of information and\n\n146\n00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.830\nthey're all stacked one on top\nof each other, it's hard to see.\n\n147\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.700\nSo what I would like to do right now is,\nI would like to pull this open so\n\n148\n00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.610\nwe have a wider view.\n\n149\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.150\nAnd as you do that, the properties will\njump to a column on the right, so now\n\n150\n00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.090\nyou'll be able to see all those properties\nout here on the right-hand side.\n\n151\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.070\nSo, literally, it's gonna give you more\nroom to be able to design your styles\n\n152\n00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.890\nthe way you want to, and you'll be able to\nsee all the options that are available.\n\n153\n00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.080\nAll right, now that we've configured\nthe CSS designer with two columns,\n\n154\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.170\nlet's go in and start creating some\nstyles, and start stylizing our webpage.\n\n155\n00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.870\nAnd Wes I just noticed I still had\na leftover style in there, a selector,\n\n156\n00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.230\nthat I had created earlier,\njust to make sure everything was good.\n\n157\n00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.520\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna remove\nthat so we can build one from scratch.\n\n158\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.730\nSo I'm gonna select the left section here.\n\n159\n00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.320\nWe'll talk about all of this here in a\nmoment, and I'm just gonna hit the delete\n\n160\n00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.000\nkey on the keyboard, and\nwe'll get some styles in here.\n\n161\n00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.230\nSo let me delete styles as well here and\nstart from scratch.\n\n162\n00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.800\nSo this is what you should\nsee when you first start and\n\n163\n00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.240\nwe should start working on this.\n\n164\n00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.860\nSo basically I have my contents sections,\nheader, nav, main, and\n\n165\n00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.050\nfooter, and\nI want to start bringing in some styles.\n\n166\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.400\nNow remember I mentioned earlier that I'd\nlike to turn my background black, for\n\n167\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.060\nexample.\n\n168\n00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.980\nSo the background happens to be part\nof the body, and what I can do here is,\n\n169\n00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.610\nin my document work area here.\n\n170\n00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.040\nI'm gonna go down to the bottom and choose\nthis area in the bottom left-hand corner.\n\n171\n00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.350\nThis is called the tag selector, and\nwhat the tag selector allows you to do,\n\n172\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:58.340\nis it allows you to see,\nwhat tags are available,\n\n173\n00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.060\nand to click on one,\nto actually work with it.\n\n174\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.020\nSo I'm gonna click on that,\nto activate it, and\n\n175\n00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.240\nyou'll see that all of the content on\nthe page now, has become selected.\n\n176\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.820\nBecause remember, I wanna add a background\ncolor of black, just for this example.\n\n177\n00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.690\nNow that I got it selected,\nI can go into my\n\n178\n00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.760\nCSS designer and\nI'm gonna start by adding a new source.\n\n179\n00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.690\nYou can see here there's actually\na description in the upper right,\n\n180\n00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.010\nit says add a new CSS source.\n\n181\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.440\nThat's the first thing I need to do.\n\n182\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.370\nThey're really good at giving you\ninstructions on what you need to do.\n\n183\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.330\nI'm gonna hit this little, plus,\nicon and I'm gonna add a source.\n\n184\n00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.420\nAnd in this case I'm going to start by\ndefining this style within the page.\n\n185\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.840\nSo right here where it\nsays define in page.\n\n186\n00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.820\nI'm gonna click on that.\n\n187\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.440\nNow instantly it did deselect\nthe code that I had earlier.\n\n188\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.410\nAnd now it's focused on the style tag,\nthe style tag is selected.\n\n189\n00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.480\nThat's because the style\ntag is selected up here.\n\n190\n00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.060\nSo again, I'd like to have bodies so\nI can come out here click on body, and\n\n191\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.570\nthen I can click on the tag for Body.\n\n192\n00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.040\nAnd now you'll see that I have\nthe ability to go into the selectors, and\n\n193\n00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.440\nI have this plus.\n\n194\n00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.250\nThis plus will allow me to create\na selector based on what I have for\n\n195\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.770\nselection.\n\n196\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.190\nSo if I hit this plus icon,\nnow it's gonna create the body.\n\n197\n00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.750\nSays, you selected the body.\n\n198\n00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.350\nWe're gonna create a style\nbased on the body.\n\n199\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.440\nOkay, so there we are.\n\n200\n00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.600\nSo now we've got body and it's asking me,\nit's selected, so I can change the name,\n\n201\n00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.050\nI can do whatever I want to with it.\n\n202\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.700\nI really don't wanna do\nanything other than utilize it.\n\n203\n00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.770\nSo I'm gonna click off of it and\nthen select it.\n\n204\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.850\nOnce I do that, it activates the\nproperties panel over here on the right.\n\n205\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.690\nSo at this point I'd like to\nfocus on that, very good.\n\n206\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.400\nAnd we're gonna make sure that we\ncan discuss all of these items and\n\n207\n00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.660\ntalk about what styles we can\nactually apply to our content.\n\n208\n00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.050\nSo the first icon is the layout.\n\n209\n00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.860\nNow granted I'm working with the layout.\n\n210\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.510\nI'm working with header,\nthe nav, and the footer.\n\n211\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.510\nSo we'll be working with here in a little\nbit, and that determines the height,\n\n212\n00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.280\nthe min width, the max width, and\nthese are for you responsive design items.\n\n213\n00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.930\nYou could choose the margins\naround your boxes.\n\n214\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.590\nSo this will give you some spacing,\nthat kind of thing, okay.\n\n215\n00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.820\nSo this is the layout options\nthat I have available.\n\n216\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.520\nBut I'd like to jump to the text section.\n\n217\n00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.910\nSo, if I wanted to change\nthe font stylings, and\n\n218\n00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.400\nI want to work with the fonts.\n\n219\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.770\nMaybe I don't like this Times New Roman,\nmaybe I don't like the black text.\n\n220\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.120\nObviously when I change the background to\nblack I'm going to need to see the text,\n\n221\n00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.110\nso I might have to change the text\ncolor or the font color, okay.\n\n222\n00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.040\nSo the first thing I'd like to do,\nis actually come over here to color, and\n\n223\n00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.120\nI'd like to click on this and\nchoose the color that I want.\n\n224\n00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.850\nNow this dialog box that has just\nappeared, it's called the Color Picker,\n\n225\n00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.110\nit lets me pick whatever color I want.\n\n226\n00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:35.960\nWhen we work with color inside on\nDreamviewer, we're working with RGB color,\n\n227\n00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.920\nnow RGB color is red, green, blue.\n\n228\n00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.690\nRed, green, blue is the colors that\nwe work with on screen devices,\n\n229\n00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.520\nit's how your monitor\ndisplays the colors to you.\n\n230\n00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.650\nAnd by using the combinations,\n\n231\n00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:55.350\nwe can get 16.77 million colors if you're\nusing 24 bit color within your monitor.\n\n232\n00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.500\nWhat you're seeing here, however,\nis several different boxes.\n\n233\n00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.730\nNow, the current color I have for\nmy font is black.\n\n234\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.160\nSo that's good.\nIt's telling me\n\n235\n00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.110\nthat this is the black color,\nand that's fantastic.\n\n236\n00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.870\nBut down here I have this\ngigantosaurus box with this color red.\n\n237\n00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.500\nNow it's really kinda funny because Adobe,\n\n238\n00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:18.700\nwhen you deal with their color pickers,\nthey always go to this default red color.\n\n239\n00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:24.050\nAnd I'm certain that it has nothing to do\nwith fact that their logo is red, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.690\nBut the point here is you\nalways start with red.\n\n241\n00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.510\nAnd in this case, where this circle is\nin the bottom left hand corner here,\n\n242\n00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.950\nthat is exactly the color\nthat's been selected.\n\n243\n00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.810\nNow the color value down here,\n\n244\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:43.550\nthis hashtag 000000 represents our red,\ngreen, blue values.\n\n245\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.630\nOur red is zero, zero hexadecimal,\nour blue is zero,\n\n246\n00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.190\nzero hexadecimal, and\nour green is zero, zero hexadecimal.\n\n247\n00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.590\nAnd so these values will change\nif I move that selector around.\n\n248\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.300\nAnd I'd like to explain\nwhat that big box is.\n\n249\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.210\nNotice in the bottom left hand corner\nyou get absolute black, zero, zero.\n\n250\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:07.450\nBut if you go all the way to the top, you\nget absolutely white in the upper left.\n\n251\n00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:12.330\nOkay, so basically what this is\nshowing me is the fact that I've got\n\n252\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.130\ndarkness at the bottom and\nbrightness at the top.\n\n253\n00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.360\nNow, another aspect is left and right.\n\n254\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:26.430\nFurthest to the left here is\na desaturation, meaning that\n\n255\n00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:32.080\nit's going to go grey as much as possible,\nso a grey scale value, desaturation.\n\n256\n00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.690\nBut if I go to the right,\nyou're gonna have saturation.\n\n257\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.770\nSo it's very saturated in those\nreds either light or dark, okay.\n\n258\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.800\nSo wherever you move this, if you move\nthis in those dimensions, left, right, up,\n\n259\n00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.020\ndown, you're gonna get desaturated,\nsaturated,\n\n260\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.480\nyou're gonna get bright and dark.\n\n261\n00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.000\nSo those are the values\nyou're looking for.\n\n262\n00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.240\nNow, at the same time, if you don't like\nthat default red that Adobe sets you at,\n\n263\n00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.090\nyou have a hue slider, so\nthis is your hue slider.\n\n264\n00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:02.450\nI usually call this my rainbow full of\nflavors, and what I can do is I can grab\n\n265\n00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.910\nthe slider, move it up, and I can specify\nwhatever color I might wanna work with.\n\n266\n00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.530\nNow, technically,\nI do want black for my background so\n\n267\n00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:11.910\nI don't want black for my text.\n\n268\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.680\nAs a matter of fact, if I want to,\nI can move this up here, and\n\n269\n00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.660\nI can pick the Adobe Red that they love so\nmuch, right, and we can utilize that.\n\n270\n00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.690\nAnd you can see right away,\nnow I've got this split view.\n\n271\n00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.540\nMy current color is black, but my new\ncolor is gonna be this red I've selected.\n\n272\n00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:30.380\nAnd, the color for RGB,\nthe Hex value, is F80202.\n\n273\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.300\nNow, Wes, do you know what hex values are?\n\n274\n00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.310\nOr what that means in the number system?\n\n275\n00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.500\n>> I know what the hex value does.\n\n276\n00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.410\nBut if you were to sit here and\ntest me on that.\n\n277\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.360\nI'd have to count it out.\n\n278\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.870\nAnd I'm not sure if I would do too good.\n\n279\n00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.190\n>> Sure, so\nwhat I'm gonna do is explain that.\n\n280\n00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.545\nBasically when we count we use\na number system that is decimal.\n\n281\n00:15:49.545 --> 00:15:51.923\nSo we start at zero and we end up at nine.\n\n282\n00:15:51.923 --> 00:15:54.605\nThose are ten values so\nyou have decimal system.\n\n283\n00:15:54.605 --> 00:15:55.907\nThe decimal system.\n\n284\n00:15:55.907 --> 00:15:57.115\nZero to nine.\n\n285\n00:15:57.115 --> 00:15:57.775\nBut you know what?\n\n286\n00:15:57.775 --> 00:16:00.473\nWe never think of this but\nwhen you get to nine, what do you do?\n\n287\n00:16:00.473 --> 00:16:04.660\nYou start over again, 1-0, 1-1, 1-2.\n\n288\n00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.510\nWe give those names.\n\n289\n00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.200\nWe call it ten, eleven, twelve so\n\n290\n00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.705\nit confuses the fact that we're actually\njust looping, and when you get to 19,\n\n291\n00:16:11.705 --> 00:16:16.095\nwhich is 1-9,\nyou start over again at 2-0, 2-1, 2-2.\n\n292\n00:16:16.095 --> 00:16:19.985\nWe have names for those, so it confuses\nthe fact that we're just repeating.\n\n293\n00:16:21.045 --> 00:16:26.640\nWell in HEX,\nwe have the nine numbers we need, 0-9.\n\n294\n00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.860\nBut we're missing 6 extra values, and\n\n295\n00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.690\nthose 6 extra values\nare pulled from the alphabet.\n\n296\n00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:38.140\nSo we use A, B, C, D, E,\nF, to get our 6 values,\n\n297\n00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.740\nand my fingers got confused\nwhen I was counting that way.\n\n298\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.940\n>> That was what I was talking about,\nI have to go back to the counting.\n\n299\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.960\nNow if I remember right,\n\n300\n00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.260\nnow some of my math that I was\napparently asleep in at the time.\n\n301\n00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.090\nIt's coming back to me.\n\n302\n00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.310\nSo when we talk about zero through nine,\n\n303\n00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.690\nwere talking about about a base\n10 numbering system, right?\n\n304\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.320\n>> That's correct.\n\n305\n00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.020\n>> I deal a lot in computers so\nbinary, that's base 2.\n\n306\n00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.140\nAnd if I remember right,\nhexidecimal's a base 16 number, right?\n\n307\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.170\n>> That is absolutely correct.\n\n308\n00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.360\n>> All right.\nIt's all coming back to me now.\n\n309\n00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.170\n>> That's why we need the zero through\nnine which is your ten, and then the six\n\n310\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.840\nalphabet characters to make up the sixteen\nvalues that you're looking for.\n\n311\n00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.120\nWhen I look at this number, F8,\nF is that representation for\n\n312\n00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.120\nred, 02 02 are a repeating value for\nthe blue, because I have a lot of red and\n\n313\n00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.490\nnot a lot of blues.\n\n314\n00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.250\nRight?\nCuz I'm doing a lot of red.\n\n315\n00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.070\nIf I change the hue slider, and\n\n316\n00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:31.810\nI move this up, yeah, it's changing\nmy hexadecimal value here as well.\n\n317\n00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.350\nNow if I wanted to, I could click on these\nbuttons here in the bottom right hand\n\n318\n00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:40.550\ncorner, that will allow me to\nliterally change it from hex to RGB,\n\n319\n00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.330\nso now you can literally see\nwhat the RGB values are.\n\n320\n00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:48.210\nNow it does say RGB A because you're\nalso adding what's know as an alpha\n\n321\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.120\ntransparency to this.\n\n322\n00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.140\nOkay?\nSo the A value is the alpha transparency,\n\n323\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.400\nbut you can see over here the transparency\nis set at 100 or the opacity\n\n324\n00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.700\nis set to 100%, which means it's not\ntransparent at all, it has a solid color.\n\n325\n00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.190\nIf that was at 0,\nthen it would be transparent and\n\n326\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:08.540\nany value in between would be the level\nof transparency that you've got, okay.\n\n327\n00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.900\nThe fact that red is 2,\nthe fact that blue or green is 248, and\n\n328\n00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:19.560\nthe fact that blue is 236 That determines\nthe fact that this is the blue-ish color.\n\n329\n00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.350\nIt's got a lot of mix of blue, and a lot\nof mix of green, but not a lot of red.\n\n330\n00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.160\nAnd that's how that works, okay.\n\n331\n00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.960\nYou also have the huge saturation and\nluminance value with an alpha channel so\n\n332\n00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.100\nyou can see what that looks like.\n\n333\n00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.920\nAnd this one deals with percentages.\n\n334\n00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.250\nSo basically your hue is 177 and\nthen the saturation is 98%.\n\n335\n00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.350\nThe luminescence is 49%.\n\n336\n00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:46.410\nAnd again, our alpha channel is set to 100\nmeaning it's gonna be a solid color, okay?\n\n337\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.010\nSo there's some values there.\n\n338\n00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.430\nNow we have one more icon\ndown here in the bottom.\n\n339\n00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.930\nThis is a eyedropper tool.\n\n340\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:57.840\nThe eyedropper tool literally lets you\nsample colors from images you might have\n\n341\n00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.840\nwithin your design, so for example\nif you're working with a client, or\n\n342\n00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.650\na customer who has a logo built, and that\nlogo is their brand, you'll want to stick\n\n343\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:11.170\nwith the colors in that logo,\nbecause the colors represent who they are.\n\n344\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.730\nAnd so because of that you can sample\nthe colors directly from the image.\n\n345\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:21.070\nAnd it will give you the RGBA, the hex,\nor the HSLA value for you, and then\n\n346\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:25.390\nyou can start stylzing your webpage and\nmaking sure that it matches those colors.\n\n347\n00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.920\nAnd that's one direction I usually go in.\n\n348\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.200\nAs a matter of fact, when I'm working\nwith a client they come to me,\n\n349\n00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.580\nthey ask me to build a website, the first\nthing I say is do you have a logo?\n\n350\n00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.310\nIf they say they do, I use that logo for\nmy entire color scheme for\n\n351\n00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.650\nthe website and I make sure that all\nmy colors are complimentary to that.\n\n352\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.370\n>> Now Jim, this looks a lot like\nsomething that I deal with in dealing with\n\n353\n00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:46.510\nthings like binary, right?\n\n354\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.860\nIf you were to ask me right now,\n\n355\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:52.190\nwhat is 101011111 I wouldn't know right\noff the top of my head, but I know that if\n\n356\n00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.010\nI put that in a binary to decimal\ncalculator, it's gonna convert it for me.\n\n357\n00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.050\nSo what we're seeing here is more\nof that advice you're giving us,\n\n358\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.050\nlet the Dreamweaver software\ndo the work for you, and\n\n359\n00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:04.680\nif you don't know the code,\nwell, that's okay.\n\n360\n00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.170\nThe design tab, you don't need to.\n\n361\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.270\nIt's there for you but\nyou can bump back on the code.\n\n362\n00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.420\nSame thing with your colors\nhere that you're seeing, right?\n\n363\n00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.310\nI don't know the RGB code.\n\n364\n00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.900\nAll I gotta do is drag that slider and\nit's gonna tell me for it.\n\n365\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.550\n>> That's absolutely correct, Wes.\n\n366\n00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:20.120\nAnd that's the perfect example of\nwhy we use Dreamweaver to design.\n\n367\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.090\nBecause it does the work for us.\n\n368\n00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.710\nI don't have to know this, but\nit makes sense to understand it.\n\n369\n00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:32.634\nBut you don't have to know that the hex\nvalue is f80202, and what that means.\n\n370\n00:20:32.634 --> 00:20:36.330\n>> I can see where this would be\nan excellent tool for introductory level.\n\n371\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.160\nEven somebody just trying to learn,\nI don't know what the code is,\n\n372\n00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.520\nI don't know what these RGB numbers are.\n\n373\n00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.790\nBut with this it seems like I could\nlearn that without having to know it\n\n374\n00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.320\nas long as I have a frame of reference and\nwhere to start.\n\n375\n00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.760\n>> That's absolutely correct.\n\n376\n00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.130\nGood point, thank you for\nbringing that up.\n\n377\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.430\nNow let's continue talking about\nthe color picker area here and\n\n378\n00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.890\nwe talked about the hue slider now\nwe also have our brightness and\n\n379\n00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.250\nlightness control here as well.\n\n380\n00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.510\nSo not only am I picking top or bottom\non this box, but I can move it up, so\n\n381\n00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.070\nif I didn't get exactly\nthe right lightness I wanted for\n\n382\n00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.730\nthat color, I could still grab this and\nmove it up, and\n\n383\n00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.070\nyou can see it's putting it more\ntowards the upper left corner.\n\n384\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.890\nSo, it's gonna move it for\nyou, left, right, up or down.\n\n385\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.160\nSo, that still matches\nwhat's inside that box.\n\n386\n00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.990\nThat still matches the brightness and\ndarkness inside that box.\n\n387\n00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.260\nAnd then here's your Alpha channel.\n\n388\n00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.530\nSo again, I don't need to know\nthat 1 means completely solid and\n\n389\n00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.160\n0 means completely transparent.\n\n390\n00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.810\nI just need to grab the slider.\n\n391\n00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.920\nAnd the more you see of\nthat checkerboard square,\n\n392\n00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.050\nthe more transparent\nthe color's going to be.\n\n393\n00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.980\nAnd the less you see\nthat checkerboard square,\n\n394\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.810\nthe more solid the color's going to be.\n\n395\n00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.000\nAnd literally,\nit's changing the value down here.\n\n396\n00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.170\nSo if I do that again, if I move\nthis down you'll see I'm at .59%,\n\n397\n00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.800\nso that's changing that value.\n\n398\n00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.390\nSo again, don't have to know any of that,\njust need to know\n\n399\n00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:54.840\nthat Dreamweaver will do that work for\nme, and so very good point there.\n\n400\n00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.720\nThere are a bunch of boxes here\nin the upper right corner.\n\n401\n00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.710\nThat's because, as you've created a color,\nyou can literally save that color for\n\n402\n00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.170\nfuture use.\n\n403\n00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.890\nThis way, you don't always have\nto remember that number, or\n\n404\n00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.890\nyou don't have to go find it again, right?\n\n405\n00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.760\nSo, now that I've chosen this bluish\naqua color or whatever this is,\n\n406\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.540\nI click the swatch, and it says okay,\nyou can reuse this in the future.\n\n407\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.840\nSo that's available to you.\n\n408\n00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.000\nSo this is a really good dialogue box\nthat helps you gain information about\n\n409\n00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.880\nthe colors you're using and\nwhat you're putting inside of your design.\n\n410\n00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:30.270\nBut I did want white for\nmy text because I'm dealing with the font.\n\n411\n00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.910\nI got to remember I'm still\nworking with the font color, so\n\n412\n00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:36.525\nnow I've got the white here,\nI've got it all the way at the top.\n\n413\n00:22:36.525 --> 00:22:39.465\nI'm going to change this to hex and\n\n414\n00:22:39.465 --> 00:22:44.005\nwhat you should see is FFFFFF across\nthe board, because I've maxed out my red,\n\n415\n00:22:44.005 --> 00:22:49.910\nmaxed out my blue, maxed out my green,\nand when you do that you get white.\n\n416\n00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.930\nSo, unlike black with all zeros.\n\n417\n00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:58.280\nAbsence of any of those filters\nmeans now that you've got black.\n\n418\n00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.630\nWhile here they're all turned\non to their maximum value.\n\n419\n00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.740\n>> All right, now I'm going to\ntest my base 16 if I remember now.\n\n420\n00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.820\nAll F's means that's the top\npossible value that you can have,\n\n421\n00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.580\ncuz we've got zero through nine, right?\n\n422\n00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.140\nWe've got A through F and\n\n423\n00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:18.060\nif they're all F's that's the highest\npart of that base 16 number you can go.\n\n424\n00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.580\n>> Now, here's the important thing,\nand Wes makes a great point here,\n\n425\n00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.890\nis the max value.\n\n426\n00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.880\nSo your values for\nyour RGB can be 0 to 256.\n\n427\n00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.040\nSo that is an 8-bit color value.\n\n428\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:37.340\nSo if I have R that is 8-bit, I have G\nthat's 8-bit, and I have B that's 8-bit,\n\n429\n00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.840\n3 times 8 is 24,\nthat gives you your 24-bit color.\n\n430\n00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.496\n>> 16 million 700, 7,216 possible colors.\n\n431\n00:23:44.496 --> 00:23:48.532\n>> That is correct that is\nabsolutely right very good Wes.\n\n432\n00:23:48.532 --> 00:23:50.531\nSo I've got this white color now and\n\n433\n00:23:50.531 --> 00:23:54.197\nI'm satisfied with that I can save\nit as this watch so I can use it in\n\n434\n00:23:54.197 --> 00:23:58.084\nthe future not that I couldn't find\nway to get into the upper corner.\n\n435\n00:23:58.084 --> 00:23:59.673\nBut so there I am.\n\n436\n00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:02.168\nI'm done with that and\nI can click off of this.\n\n437\n00:24:02.168 --> 00:24:04.690\nAnd now it turns my font to white.\n\n438\n00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.690\nAnd it looks like it's a problem because\nwe've just lost all of our text.\n\n439\n00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.340\nBut it's not gonna be an issue when we\n\n440\n00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.260\nbring out the background to make it black,\nokay.\n\n441\n00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.690\nSo we have a lot of Text options, like\nwe can choose the different font family.\n\n442\n00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.510\nRemember I said I wanted to move\naway from Times New Roman or\n\n443\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.530\nwhatever the default font was here?\n\n444\n00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.300\nAnd the reason why I want to move away\nfrom that is because we need to talk about\n\n445\n00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.490\nthe font family stylings.\n\n446\n00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:32.170\nThere are two types of font in\nthe universe of typography.\n\n447\n00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:36.110\nOne is serif fonts and\nthe other is sans serif fonts.\n\n448\n00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.770\nYou may have heard that terminology\nbefore and never knew what it meant.\n\n449\n00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.280\nWell I'll let you know that\nSerif means flourishes and\n\n450\n00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.280\nSans Serif means without flourishes.\n\n451\n00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:51.080\nSo when I had my font color here earlier,\nand I looked at my text, I'm just going to\n\n452\n00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.380\nclick off of this so you can see, maybe\nthat blue's still not a good idea,right.\n\n453\n00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.570\nGo back to the black here.\n\n454\n00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.250\nSo I'm back to black, and there we go.\n\n455\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:04.140\nYou can see, the capital letter N has\nfeet at the bottom, feet at the top.\n\n456\n00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.820\nThe W's have feet at the top.\n\n457\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.150\nThe H has feet, the T's have feet.\n\n458\n00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.200\nThose are your flourishes.\n\n459\n00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.250\nSo if I choose a font family here,\nthat doesn't have flourishes,\n\n460\n00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.040\nit will literally say,\nthat it's a san serif font.\n\n461\n00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:24.910\nSo in this list under my managed fonts\nhere, I have this little groups of fonts.\n\n462\n00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.600\nAnd, literally, what I'm seeing if I look\nall the way to the right at the end,\n\n463\n00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.380\nit tells me that these are all serif.\n\n464\n00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.430\nSo there's a bunch of them,\nthey're Baskerville comma,\n\n465\n00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:36.250\nPalatino comma, Linotype comma,\nand so and so and so forth.\n\n466\n00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:41.270\nWhat happens is, it used to be in\nthe old days, when we had multiple\n\n467\n00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:46.070\noperating systems and everything was the\nWild West of the computer world, right?\n\n468\n00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:51.170\nNot every computer had the same font\ntypeset installed in their computers.\n\n469\n00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:55.180\nAnd so because of that, as a designer,\nwe needed to make sure we captured\n\n470\n00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.220\nthe essence of our design, and so\nwe would build in a fail safe system.\n\n471\n00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.380\nWhat the system would do is it would\nlook at the first spot, Baskerville,\n\n472\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.970\nand it would say does this computer\nthat I'm on right now have Baskerville.\n\n473\n00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.150\nIf it doesn't, it'll say ok how\nabout Palentino, or a dozen.\n\n474\n00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.840\nOkay, how about Linotype,\nsorry, Palatino Century?\n\n475\n00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.090\nHow about Schoolbook, okay?\n\n476\n00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.080\nAnd it would go down the list until\nif found one that was available\n\n477\n00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.440\nin the system.\n\n478\n00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.010\nAnd so what you could do is you could\n\n479\n00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:27.850\npredict what was going to happen with your\ndesign by having a little more control.\n\n480\n00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:32.730\nSo you would specify multiple parameters\nand options that were available, and\n\n481\n00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.460\nthat is how you did your failsafe.\n\n482\n00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.950\nAnd by default, once you've got all\nthe way to the end, if none of these were\n\n483\n00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.880\navailable it would just say find\nthe first serif font that's available and\n\n484\n00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.040\njust use that.\n\n485\n00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.560\nSo that's what this is all about.\n\n486\n00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.495\nSo if I look through my list here, I keep\ngoing down, I can see that there are some\n\n487\n00:26:48.495 --> 00:26:52.840\nsans-serif options, so Gill Sans,\nGill Sans MT, Myriad Pro.\n\n488\n00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.660\nSo the good thing about the sans serif\nfonts, is they literally have sans in\n\n489\n00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.930\nthe name sometimes, and\nthat tells you that it's sans serif.\n\n490\n00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:03.790\nSo in this example,\nI would like to use a sans serif grouping.\n\n491\n00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.250\nAnd I thinking that I'm gonna go\nwith this Gotham Helvetica Neue and\n\n492\n00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.360\nHelvetica Ariel Sans-Serif.\n\n493\n00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.810\nSo again, it's gonna give me this group,\nbut if I wanted to, I could come here and\n\n494\n00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.980\nmanage my own font set.\n\n495\n00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:19.540\nSo if I click on this, I can now choose\nfrom the Adobe web fonts, because,\n\n496\n00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.910\nwhen you're using Dreamweaver CC, you're\nconnected to the Creative Cloud, and\n\n497\n00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.680\nyou have a whole bunch of font\nsets that are available to you\n\n498\n00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.220\nto download from the internet.\n\n499\n00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.600\nOr I could do local web fonts that\nare available to me and I could search for\n\n500\n00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.830\nthem and bring them in.\n\n501\n00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:36.160\nSo I could create my own set, or\nI could have a stack here, and\n\n502\n00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.830\nI could go edit the stacks\nthat are all ready available.\n\n503\n00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.480\nOk, so I hit the plus, that will add it,\nor hit minus, it will subtract it.\n\n504\n00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.920\nAnd I can build from the system fonts\nthat I have installed on my computer.\n\n505\n00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.110\nAnd these are basically the windows system\nfonts that come with Windows 7 in my case.\n\n506\n00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.890\nSo I don't want to change any of\nthose right now, but if I did,\n\n507\n00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.500\nI could do that from here.\n\n508\n00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:02.340\nWhat I did want to do is I wanted to\nmake sure that I chose the gothem\n\n509\n00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.100\narial sens serif.\n\n510\n00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.470\nAnd when I do that,\nnotice the text now no longer has feet.\n\n511\n00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.520\nSo there are no longer flourishes.\n\n512\n00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.780\nThe point of serif versus sans serif is\n\n513\n00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.860\nwe're trying to make our designs\nas user friendly as possible.\n\n514\n00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.359\nAnd we're trying to make it so\nthat way we have readable text.\n\n515\n00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.000\nSans serif fonts are very readable,\nserif fonts are a little harder to read,\n\n516\n00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.650\nespecially when the text is\nsmall because they're very busy.\n\n517\n00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.270\nSo it's important to keep that in mind.\n\n518\n00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.600\nIf you're going to have large text,\nyou can use serif all day long.\n\n519\n00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.870\nIf you're going to have small\ntext like in articles, or\n\n520\n00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:40.960\nin the body text of whatever messages\nyou're trying to pass on to your user,\n\n521\n00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.770\nyou're gonna want to\nhave sans serif fonts.\n\n522\n00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.760\nAnd that's what I've chosen here.\n\n523\n00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.010\nSo let me set this back to white.\n\n524\n00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.870\nSo that's the font group, right?\n\n525\n00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.190\nSo I've got the font group,\nI've changed the font family,\n\n526\n00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.370\nand I've changed the color.\n\n527\n00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.230\nNow the next icon is for borders.\n\n528\n00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:58.530\nSo if I wanted to add a border around\nthe body, then I could do that here.\n\n529\n00:28:58.530 --> 00:28:59.940\nWe're not ready for borders just yet, but\n\n530\n00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.550\nI would like to change\nthe background colors.\n\n531\n00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.310\nSo as I stated,\nI'm gonna add a background color.\n\n532\n00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.680\nAnd right here I can choose\nthe background color option,\n\n533\n00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.910\nI get the same color picker and\nin this case, I just wanted to go black.\n\n534\n00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.730\nSo I'm gonna choose that, click off of it.\n\n535\n00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:17.680\nOr maybe select it first,\nadd it as a swatch, and\n\n536\n00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.490\nnow click off of it, and there we go.\n\n537\n00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.390\nSo now I can actually read this text.\n\n538\n00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:28.130\nSo using cascading style sheets\nof applied styles to the body tag\n\n539\n00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:32.820\nof my code, and it's applying it\nto all the content moving forward.\n\n540\n00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.710\nSo all my content moving forward,\nno matter what content sections,\n\n541\n00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:40.950\nno matter what articles, no matter\nwhat text I import in, it will always\n\n542\n00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:45.550\nbe white Fonts with the Gotham\nstyle on black background.\n\n543\n00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.850\n>> Well, Jim, thank you, I do\nappreciate you helping us out with CSS,\n\n544\n00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.980\nnot only defining what CSS is,\n\n545\n00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:56.360\nbut showing us around the Dreamweaver\ninterface and what we can do with that.\n\n546\n00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.200\nI do see that we are coming to the end\nof another wonderful episode here, so\n\n547\n00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.190\nbefore we sign out do you\nhave any additional words?\n\n548\n00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.630\n>> Sure, thank you, Wes.\n\n549\n00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:09.600\nI just want you to keep in mind that I\ndidn't have to write any code for this.\n\n550\n00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.590\nAnd again I would like to show you the\ncode that was written by the system and\n\n551\n00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:15.010\njust talk about that for one minute.\n\n552\n00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.655\nSo I go back to code view here, and\n\n553\n00:30:17.655 --> 00:30:21.405\nI look at the code that was written,\nthis is the section where I created it.\n\n554\n00:30:21.405 --> 00:30:25.535\nBecause the first thing I did over here to\nthe right was I chose to create a style\n\n555\n00:30:25.535 --> 00:30:30.030\ninside embedded in my document, and\nso I created the style tag, and\n\n556\n00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.900\nhere's the body tag that\nit applied those styles to.\n\n557\n00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.890\nAnd here's the color of the font, white.\n\n558\n00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.040\nHere's the font family.\n\n559\n00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.860\nThere's the Gotham font.\n\n560\n00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.570\nAnd here's the background color, black.\n\n561\n00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:42.550\nSo, there's all that code.\n\n562\n00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.120\nAnd that's inside of a container.\n\n563\n00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.520\nNow, one thing I do like about\nCC Is if you hover over these and\n\n564\n00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.710\nyour not sure what the color is,\n\n565\n00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:52.220\nit literally shows you a swatch of\nwhat that color representation is.\n\n566\n00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.110\nSo if you aren't sure,\nyou'll get a representation.\n\n567\n00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.970\nSo very nice for them to do that.\n\n568\n00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:02.025\nBut this is the body tag And\nthese are the styles within my container.\n\n569\n00:31:02.025 --> 00:31:05.705\nAnd the container here is contained\nwithin these curly braces.\n\n570\n00:31:05.705 --> 00:31:09.255\n>> Well we do appreciate that very good\ninformation, and now thank you and\n\n571\n00:31:09.255 --> 00:31:13.167\nI know that we got plenty more to come\nhere on Dreamweaver But we're gonna\n\n572\n00:31:13.167 --> 00:31:16.987\ngo ahead and have to save that for\nanother episode, so, thank you again, Jim.\n\n573\n00:31:16.987 --> 00:31:17.737\nI do appreciate it.\n\n574\n00:31:17.737 --> 00:31:20.307\nWe do appreciate you, the viewers out\nthere, but we're gonna go ahead and\n\n575\n00:31:20.307 --> 00:31:21.777\nsign out here at ITProTV.\n\n576\n00:31:21.777 --> 00:31:23.297\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n577\n00:31:23.297 --> 00:31:24.517\n>> And I'm Jim Surrell.\n\n578\n00:31:24.517 --> 00:31:26.699\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n579\n00:31:26.699 --> 00:31:32.230\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.421\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:20.510\nAnd in today's episode, we're moving\nalong in our DreamWeaver series.\n\n5\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.540\nThat's right, we're coming back with a\nlittle bit more of the Creative Cloud 2015\n\n6\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.545\nand joining me in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Jim Searles.\n\n7\n00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:28.868\nJim, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:32.267\n>> I'm doing great Wes, thank you for\nhaving me again, and thank you to\n\n9\n00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:36.390\nthe ITProTV team for allowing me to\ncome back and talk about DreamWeaver.\n\n10\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110\nToday we're gonna discuss\ninserting images into our design.\n\n11\n00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.500\nSo at this point we've got a layout and\nwe've created some content divisions.\n\n12\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.840\nAnd now we wanna put some images inside of\nthese divisions to capture the audience's\n\n13\n00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.110\nimagination.\n\n14\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.290\nSo to do that I'd like to\nstart by discussing that there\n\n15\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.480\nare three types of images that\nbrowsers recognize out on the web.\n\n16\n00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.350\nAnd each one has its own\nvaried specification.\n\n17\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.920\nAnd also has its own varied use.\n\n18\n00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.630\nSo for example, we'll start with GIF.\n\n19\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.820\nGIF is G-I-F.\n\n20\n00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.070\nStands for Graphic Interchange Format.\n\n21\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.230\nAnd this one is specifically used for\nlogos and\n\n22\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.630\nanything with high contrasting colors.\n\n23\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.200\nAnd the reason for\n\n24\n00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.890\nthis is because it only has 256 colors\nthat it can define within a GIF file.\n\n25\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.270\nAnd specifically what happens\nis when you create an image or\n\n26\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.790\nsome kind of vector graphic or\nsomething with another tool,\n\n27\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.490\nyou bring out the GIF, it will look at\nthe most commonly used colors and say,\n\n28\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.370\nokay here are the 256 of them and\nthese are what I'm going to use.\n\n29\n00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.780\nSo because of that,\nGIF doesn't need to have compression.\n\n30\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.500\nIt reduces the file size by reducing the\namount of colors that are in your image.\n\n31\n00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.870\nNow there are some benefits to using GIFs.\n\n32\n00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.500\nAnd one of them is the fact that you can\nuse transparencies within the GIF file.\n\n33\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.260\nBut you also have the ability\nto use animations.\n\n34\n00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.310\nAnd you've all seen animated\nGIFs out on the Internet.\n\n35\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.140\nAnd you've seen the ability\nto use those to make\n\n36\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.120\nsome funny captions within your design.\n\n37\n00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.250\nThe second file type\nis the JPEG file type.\n\n38\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.830\nThe JPEG file type stands for\nJoint Photographic Experts Group.\n\n39\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.820\nAnd Joint Photographic Experts Group files\ncan contain up to 16.77 million colors.\n\n40\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.580\nSo they are 24 bit.\n\n41\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.050\nThe problem with JPEG is that it\ndoesn't allow for transparency.\n\n42\n00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.520\nAnd at the same time it uses what's\nknown as a lossy compression scheme.\n\n43\n00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.258\nMeaning that it discards pixels.\n\n44\n00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.909\nThe little dots that make up the image.\n\n45\n00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.369\nIt discards them in order\nto reduce the file size.\n\n46\n00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:48.241\nAlso JPEGs were used out on\nthe Internet when the Internet was new,\n\n47\n00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:51.210\nand because of that there was dial-up.\n\n48\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.200\nAnd so very useful in a situation\nwhere you might have low bandwidth or\n\n49\n00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.810\nslow broadband.\n\n50\n00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.209\nSo that's what JPEG was all about.\n\n51\n00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.760\nSo, the next,\nthe third file type is the PNG file type.\n\n52\n00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.470\nNow, the PNG file type was put together\nby the World Wide Web consortium and\n\n53\n00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.580\nthis is a group that's responsible for\n\n54\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.490\nstandardizing the items that\nare out there on the web.\n\n55\n00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.680\nAnd it stands for\nPortable Network Graphic and\n\n56\n00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.120\nbasically the PNG file type brings in\nthe best of both worlds in the sense that,\n\n57\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.320\nit does allow for\ntransparency just like GIF.\n\n58\n00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.700\nIt has a lossless compression\nscheme just like GIF\n\n59\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.960\nin that it does not discard pixels so\nyou don't lose quality.\n\n60\n00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.120\nAnd then the third thing it does\nis that it allows transparency,\n\n61\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.940\nlossless no compression, and\nit does up to 48 bit color.\n\n62\n00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.520\nI forgot what I was on.\n\n63\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.460\nSo, the 48 bit color is\nthe other piece there.\n\n64\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.270\nSo, not just 16.77 million colors but\nmany more colors than that.\n\n65\n00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.275\nSo, there is a benefit to\nusing the PNG file type.\n\n66\n00:03:59.275 --> 00:04:02.875\nNow, you can still use\nJPEG on your websites.\n\n67\n00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:06.563\nAnd you'll see that they're\nstill out there en masse, but\n\n68\n00:04:06.563 --> 00:04:09.750\nwe're trying to move over to PNG for\nthe most part.\n\n69\n00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.270\nWe're trying to make that the most useful\ntype of file that's out on the Internet.\n\n70\n00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.900\n>> You know, Jim,\none question that I do have and\n\n71\n00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.930\nmaybe you can help me\nsolve this riddle here,\n\n72\n00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.740\nif it is one, is that JPEG seems to\nhave two different naming conventions.\n\n73\n00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.630\nWe have one with an e and\none without an e.\n\n74\n00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.220\nCan you help us out with that?\n\n75\n00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.870\n>> Yeah, that's a great question, Wes.\n\n76\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.182\nWhat happens is this.\n\n77\n00:04:31.182 --> 00:04:35.910\nAgain, JPEG was developed when\nthe Internet was new, so back then,\n\n78\n00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.560\nin the early 90s, mid-90s, we had servers,\nor web browsers that couldn't\n\n79\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.470\nrecognize the naming convention that had\nmore than three characters after the dot.\n\n80\n00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.584\nSo basically we'd have index.htm\nrather than index.html and\n\n81\n00:04:50.584 --> 00:04:53.410\nthat's the same thing with JPEG.\n\n82\n00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.692\nJPEG, Joint Photographic Experts Group,\ndoes contain the e in it.\n\n83\n00:04:58.692 --> 00:05:01.610\nSo nowadays we can have the four\ncharacters after the dot.\n\n84\n00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.760\nBut again it was just\nthree that was allowed.\n\n85\n00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.897\nSo that's the whole point to the .jpg or\n.jpeg,\n\n86\n00:05:09.897 --> 00:05:13.110\nthey're the same thing,\nhowever, so good question.\n\n87\n00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.610\nOkay, so with that said, I'd like to draw\nour attention back to our application, and\n\n88\n00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.760\ntake a look at our design and\nstart inserting images into the design.\n\n89\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.730\nSo the first thing I'd like to do is I\nwould like to go in and define my site.\n\n90\n00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.050\nI'd like to clean it up a little bit.\n\n91\n00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.970\nI'm seeing a lot going on\nhere on the desktop and\n\n92\n00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.310\nI would just want to point\nto the Mysample site.\n\n93\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.210\nAlso at the same time, I wanna make\nsure that my DreamWeaver application is\n\n94\n00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.410\npointing to the image\nfolder that I want to use.\n\n95\n00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.630\nAnd make sure all my assets are together.\n\n96\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.450\nSo to do that I'm gonna go into my\nsite menu up here at the top, and\n\n97\n00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.080\nI'm gonna choose manage sites.\n\n98\n00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.220\nI could have as easily gone into\nthe files panel on the right and\n\n99\n00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.270\nclicked on the pull down\nwhere it says Mysample site.\n\n100\n00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.580\nI could have chosen manage\nsites down here at the bottom.\n\n101\n00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.380\nSo either way would be fine.\n\n102\n00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.030\nIt'll take me to the same location,\n\n103\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.420\nwhere I can see I have multiple sites\nhere listed and as a matter of fact,\n\n104\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.820\nif I don't want a site, I can select it\nand hit the minus down here at the bottom.\n\n105\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.060\nThat'll remove it.\n\n106\n00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.500\nBut what I'd like to do with\nthe Mysamplesite is I'd like to edit it.\n\n107\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.880\nI'd like to point it to the appropriate\nlocation that I want for my files and\n\n108\n00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.680\nthen point it to the image\nfiles that I need to use.\n\n109\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.090\nSo right next to the minus down here\nat the bottom, I do have the pencil.\n\n110\n00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.630\nThe pencil means you're going to edit,\nso I'm gonna click on edit and\n\n111\n00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.500\nliterally I get back to the original\nscreen that we had when we first\n\n112\n00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.450\ncreated the My Sample Site.\n\n113\n00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.020\nAnd you could see right now that\nthis is pointing to desktop folder.\n\n114\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.316\nAnd I'd like to point that to the folder\nI've created on the desktop called\n\n115\n00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:41.062\nMysample site.\n\n116\n00:06:41.062 --> 00:06:43.761\nI'm going to look for\nthat in the list and here it is, so\n\n117\n00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:45.486\nI'm going to select that folder.\n\n118\n00:06:45.486 --> 00:06:49.323\nNow the second reason, and the real reason\nI wanted to bring you into this dialogue\n\n119\n00:06:49.323 --> 00:06:51.895\nbox, was so\nwe could go to the advanced settings here.\n\n120\n00:06:51.895 --> 00:06:55.358\nBecause once I get into advanced settings\nI can see right here to the right that I\n\n121\n00:06:55.358 --> 00:06:57.680\ncan choose a default images folder.\n\n122\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.600\nAnd as we've created in the past,\n\n123\n00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.100\nwe've created the images folder with the\nunderscore and I'm going to point to that.\n\n124\n00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.040\nSo I'm going to click\nthe Browse button here, and\n\n125\n00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.400\ninside the Mysample site,\nI'm going to choose the Images folder,\n\n126\n00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.650\nthe _Images folder, and that will\nbecome the root for all of my images.\n\n127\n00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.220\nNow, there are two other items in this\nlist that I'd like to talk about, links.\n\n128\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.500\nRelative to.\n\n129\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.250\nIt's either going to be relative to\nthe document I'm currently working in, for\n\n130\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.370\nexample the index.html file, or\nrelative to the entire site, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.849\nAnd that will change the file path\nthat DreamWeaver uses to identify\n\n132\n00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:34.450\nthe location of where these files are.\n\n133\n00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.487\nNow, by default, document Is\nalways the relative source, and\n\n134\n00:07:38.487 --> 00:07:40.673\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n135\n00:07:40.673 --> 00:07:44.303\nThat's the one we use most commonly but\nyou can change that here in site root and\n\n136\n00:07:44.303 --> 00:07:47.273\nyou're gonna see later on when\nwe start bringing in our images,\n\n137\n00:07:47.273 --> 00:07:49.101\nwe can also make that change on the fly.\n\n138\n00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:52.864\nBut by default I would like it to be\nthe document that is gonna be relative to.\n\n139\n00:07:52.864 --> 00:07:55.583\nSo I'm gonna click the save icon.\n\n140\n00:07:55.583 --> 00:07:59.152\nAnd it's gonna tell me it's\ngonna recache my location.\n\n141\n00:07:59.152 --> 00:08:02.237\nIt's gonna find the files, and\nas you saw, just a quick blip.\n\n142\n00:08:02.237 --> 00:08:02.783\nNow I'm done,\n\n143\n00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:05.980\nI'm gonna click the Done button here\nin the bottom right-hand corner.\n\n144\n00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.760\nAnd you can see now my files are organized\nand I can see them much better.\n\n145\n00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.500\nSo I'm gonna go into my design up here\nwhere it says the content for new header,\n\n146\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.360\ntag goes here, and I'm gonna select\nthat content and remove it, so\n\n147\n00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.480\nI'm literally gonna select that.\n\n148\n00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.214\nNow, one thing I want to caution you about\nis that when you begin editing in your\n\n149\n00:08:24.214 --> 00:08:28.804\ndesign window, you want to make sure\nthat the Live View is not turned on, and\n\n150\n00:08:28.804 --> 00:08:29.688\nhere's why.\n\n151\n00:08:29.688 --> 00:08:33.751\nIf I select Live View, okay,\nyou can see the boxes have disappeared and\n\n152\n00:08:33.751 --> 00:08:37.900\nI've got some new informations called\nthe Edit Element Selector here.\n\n153\n00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.328\nBut I can select the text and if I try\nto delete that text, I hit Delete,\n\n154\n00:08:41.328 --> 00:08:44.294\nit's not going to work,\nbecause Live View is saying, hey,\n\n155\n00:08:44.294 --> 00:08:49.080\nI'm trying to show you an approximation of\nyour site, I'm not letting you edit it.\n\n156\n00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.480\nSo I have to turn that off.\n\n157\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.820\nSo I go back down here, I turn it off,\n\n158\n00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.500\nI get my divisions around or\nmy content sections, I select the content.\n\n159\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.270\nI hit the Delete key on the back, and\nnow I can see my cursor flashing.\n\n160\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.810\nNow there are multiple ways,\nat least three that I can think of,\n\n161\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.590\nmaybe four, five ways that I can\nthink of to insert an image.\n\n162\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.030\nI'll show you at least three for now.\n\n163\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.080\nOne of them obviously is I can go into\nthe code and I can write the code for it.\n\n164\n00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.340\nBut I can go into the Insert\nmenu up here at the top, and\n\n165\n00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:28.490\nI can go down to Image, and click on that\nand it will bring up an image dialog box.\n\n166\n00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.538\nOr, I could go into my Insert\npanel here at the top and\n\n167\n00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:35.758\nthe second icon from the left right here,\n\n168\n00:09:35.758 --> 00:09:41.890\nthis is, My image icon.\n\n169\n00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.150\nAnd when I click on it,\nit takes me right to that same dialog box,\n\n170\n00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.040\nI'm gonna click Cancel here.\n\n171\n00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.250\nThe third way is that I can find\nthe file in my Files panel and\n\n172\n00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.780\nI can literally drag it into my design.\n\n173\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.440\nSo I'm gonna drag a file into that design,\nbut I'm gonna delete just so\n\n174\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.360\nthat way I can talk about the dialog box.\n\n175\n00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.170\nSo I can literally just click and\ndrag the file in.\n\n176\n00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:12.160\nSo this is a drag and drop opportunity,\nand you can see the little insertion point\n\n177\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.570\nmoving with my cursor, and exactly where\nI want it to be is in that top division.\n\n178\n00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.040\nI let go and it inserts it right there.\n\n179\n00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.990\nNow I am gonna undo that just for\nthe benefit of our viewers,\n\n180\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.320\nbecause I want to be able to show\nyou what the dialog box does.\n\n181\n00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.410\nSo this is one way I can do it and\nI'm gonna show you another way.\n\n182\n00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.974\nOkay, so I'm gonna not redo I'm gonna\nundo, and now I've gotta do it again,\n\n183\n00:10:33.974 --> 00:10:35.673\ncuz I did it twice, there we go.\n\n184\n00:10:35.673 --> 00:10:39.075\nSo I'd actually had two images\nthat I inserted at the same spot.\n\n185\n00:10:39.075 --> 00:10:43.784\nAll right, with my cursor flashing here,\nI'm gonna click on this Insert icon for\n\n186\n00:10:43.784 --> 00:10:44.870\nimages.\n\n187\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.086\nAnd now I get to find the file, so I'm\ngonna go to my desktop, MySample folder.\n\n188\n00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:51.197\nSo you can see how dragging and\ndropping is a lot easier?\n\n189\n00:10:51.197 --> 00:10:55.340\nI don't have to go through all this\nmenu searching, and here is the image.\n\n190\n00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.914\nBut at least I get to see the preview,\nand I get to see what's going on with it.\n\n191\n00:10:57.914 --> 00:11:02.136\nAnd so down here, I can see right away,\nthe name of the file is banner3.png.\n\n192\n00:11:02.136 --> 00:11:05.320\nSo this is one of our PNG file types.\n\n193\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.630\nAnd I can also see over here,\n\n194\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.840\nit's searching for all of the graphic\nfile types that are available.\n\n195\n00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.510\nAnd there's your JPEG, Mr.\nWes, as you had expressed.\n\n196\n00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.640\nNow there's another file type that's\ncommon to use on web design, and\n\n197\n00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.840\nthat's SVG.\n\n198\n00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.030\nIt's called the scalable vector graphic,\nokay?\n\n199\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.960\nPNG is the one that was determined by the\nWorld Wide Web Consortium to be used or\n\n200\n00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.340\nto help replace the other two.\n\n201\n00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.300\nBut scalable vector graphics\nlet's you create, for\n\n202\n00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.090\nexample, an Illustrator file,\nand it is a vector.\n\n203\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:39.110\nAnd you get to keep it as a vector file,\nyou don't have to convert it over\n\n204\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:44.430\nto a bitmap file, and\nthat's what PNG, JPEG, and GIF are.\n\n205\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.070\nThey're bitmap files,\nwhereas scalable vector graphic root,\n\n206\n00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.020\nit keeps it as its raw file type,\nthe vector file.\n\n207\n00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:58.440\nSo, I'm going to click OK here, and\n\n208\n00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.070\nhere's the relative to Document, so\nyou can see I get to choose that.\n\n209\n00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.970\nI said you could change it on the fly, so\n\n210\n00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.620\nI didn't have to change it in the\npreferences, I can do it right from here.\n\n211\n00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.720\nBut I'm gonna click OK and insert that in.\n\n212\n00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.050\nSo either way will get\nyou to the same place.\n\n213\n00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:11.580\nBut again,\n\n214\n00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.540\nit's important to understand the multiple\ndifferent ways that that can happen.\n\n215\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.820\nNow, the next thing I'd like to do is\nshow you what happened in the code, okay?\n\n216\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.930\nSo basically,\nif I go into my code view and\n\n217\n00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.810\nI look at the code, it inserted the image,\nyes, inside of the header element.\n\n218\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.075\nSo I've got the header element here,\nand it inserted the image.\n\n219\n00:12:29.075 --> 00:12:31.891\nBut at the same time,\nit pointed to the source file and\n\n220\n00:12:31.891 --> 00:12:34.029\nthe source location with the filename.\n\n221\n00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:35.545\nAnd if I hover over that,\n\n222\n00:12:35.545 --> 00:12:39.530\nDreamweaver CC does show me a sample\nof what that file looks like.\n\n223\n00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.680\nSo if I come back to this code six months\nfrom now and I don't remember what\n\n224\n00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.700\nthat file was, I can just hover\nover this code and see that sample.\n\n225\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.980\nAnother thing that the code\ndid is it listed out\n\n226\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.770\nthe dimensions of the file itself.\n\n227\n00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:57.460\nSo, for example here, it says the width\nof the file is 1,033, the height is 300.\n\n228\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.197\nNow these are in pixels.\n\n229\n00:12:59.197 --> 00:13:03.931\nAnd pixels, as I mentioned before when I\nwas talking about the graphic file types\n\n230\n00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:06.799\nthat we use,\npixels is actually a portmanteau.\n\n231\n00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:09.540\nA portmanteau is where you\ncombine two words together.\n\n232\n00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.870\nAnd the two words that have been combined\ntogether are picture and element.\n\n233\n00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.110\nSo, pixel is a portmanteau\nof picture element.\n\n234\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.650\nAnd basically,\nit's the dot that makes up the image.\n\n235\n00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.540\nSo, when I see that it has 1,033 for\nthe width,\n\n236\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:27.590\nthat means there are 1,033 dots that\nmake up the width of the image.\n\n237\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:31.911\nIf it says 300 for the height, than that\nare 300 dots that make up the image for\n\n238\n00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:32.600\nthe height.\n\n239\n00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.700\nSo now that we've got that in there,\nand we have our code written nicely for\n\n240\n00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.835\nus with the image tag.\n\n241\n00:13:39.835 --> 00:13:43.615\nI wanna draw your attention down to the\nproperties panel because now that we're\n\n242\n00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:46.385\nusing an image, it's gonna be useful\nto talk about the properties panel.\n\n243\n00:13:46.385 --> 00:13:50.105\nAnd you can see right away that I'm\nusing an image, the image is selected,\n\n244\n00:13:50.105 --> 00:13:54.170\nthere's a boarder around it, and\nit is 311 kilobytes in size, so\n\n245\n00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.810\nthat tells me what's going on there.\n\n246\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.000\nHere's the source, so\nI've got the source linked here.\n\n247\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.510\nAnd I've got a whole bunch\nof other controls for\n\n248\n00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.780\nthis image, as a matter of fact.\n\n249\n00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.730\nI can associate a class or\nan ID to this image.\n\n250\n00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.580\nSo if I want to specify\nsome styling there for\n\n251\n00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.340\nCSS, something we've discussed\nin a previous episode.\n\n252\n00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.460\nAlso, I've got the width and height\nvalues here that I can change, there's\n\n253\n00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.010\na width and height values, and I can just\nclick in here and change that on the fly.\n\n254\n00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.820\nBut I'd like to draw your attention\nall the way to the right,\n\n255\n00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.675\nbecause once you insert an image, almost\nthe first thing that you should do is\n\n256\n00:14:28.675 --> 00:14:32.205\nyou should go into this Alt dialog box and\nadd some text.\n\n257\n00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:36.770\nWhat this will do is it will allow anyone\nwho is visually impaired who's using\n\n258\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:41.195\nscreen reader software, if they come\nto your site and they see this image,\n\n259\n00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:45.499\nwhat will happen is the screen reader\nwill try to read what this image is.\n\n260\n00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:50.660\nIf you do not have Alt text in here,\nit will not read anything.\n\n261\n00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.810\nAnd it will not give them a good\nrepresentation of what's going\n\n262\n00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.330\non in your site.\n\n263\n00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.300\nAlso, there is something\nknown as 508C compliance.\n\n264\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:03.770\nBasically, 508C compliance means\nthat you have to have a way for\n\n265\n00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.410\npeople who are visually impaired\nto hear what is on your site,\n\n266\n00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.438\nto hear the content that's on your site.\n\n267\n00:15:09.438 --> 00:15:14.380\nAnd so 508 compliance is useful\nbecause it makes sure that governments\n\n268\n00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:19.390\nfollow the law, and that the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act kicks in,\n\n269\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.120\nand makes sure everybody's doing what\nthey're supposed to do for accessibility.\n\n270\n00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.590\nSo by typing in alt text,\nyou've got a two-fold process here,\n\n271\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.560\nyou're benefiting in two ways.\n\n272\n00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.750\nOne, you're meeting the 508C compliance.\n\n273\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:38.999\nBut two, you're also making it so that\nway your web crawlers for Google, Yahoo,\n\n274\n00:15:38.999 --> 00:15:44.172\nMSN, Bing, whatever, they are going to\nbe picking up this image and making sure\n\n275\n00:15:44.172 --> 00:15:49.227\nthat your accessibility is there, and\nyour rankings are gonna be staying up.\n\n276\n00:15:49.227 --> 00:15:52.227\nSo it's good for\nSearch Engine Optimization, your SEO.\n\n277\n00:15:52.227 --> 00:15:56.678\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna type in\nA description of what this image is in\n\n278\n00:15:56.678 --> 00:16:00.200\norder to be able to describe\nit to those screen readers.\n\n279\n00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.830\nAnd you want to be as\ndescriptive as possible.\n\n280\n00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.490\nNow in the banner it's a good\nidea to brand your company.\n\n281\n00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:09.200\nIt's usually the branding, the first\nthing people see at the top of your page.\n\n282\n00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.200\nSo you want to make sure you\nbrand something about that.\n\n283\n00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.310\nSo in my case,\nI'm just gonna put my home page.\n\n284\n00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.110\nBanner image, okay.\n\n285\n00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.730\nSo something that's gonna describe\nwhat this is to those readers.\n\n286\n00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.660\nAnd it will literally read that text.\n\n287\n00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:29.270\nNow before I continue, we do have\nthe ability to edit this image, and\n\n288\n00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.200\nyou can choose to edit in a source\nlike Photoshop or in this case,\n\n289\n00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.990\nbecause it's a PNG it might\nopen up in Fireworks and\n\n290\n00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.880\nyou can also go in and sharpen\nthe image or you can brighten it up.\n\n291\n00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.870\nIf you want to you can\nchange some settings there.\n\n292\n00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.410\nSo it's I think ten levels\nof settings you can change.\n\n293\n00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:51.050\nAnd you can also edit the image\nsettings itself directly in here.\n\n294\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.230\nSo if I click on this\nI'll get a dialog box and\n\n295\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.430\nI can change any presets\nwith a mate color.\n\n296\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:00.410\nSo if I was using a jpg, for example,\nsince I had black on my background I\n\n297\n00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:04.030\ncouldn't have somebody doing a pose\ninstead of having a white box around\n\n298\n00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.390\nthem I could make it black so it looks\nlike the background of my website.\n\n299\n00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:13.510\nOkay, In this case I am okay with the PNG\nthe way it is, I am going to hit cancel.\n\n300\n00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.310\nNow there's a whole other\nsection down here at the bottom.\n\n301\n00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.910\nThis is because you can use\nwhat's known as an image map.\n\n302\n00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.010\nYou can make it so that if someone clicks\non this olive it might do something\n\n303\n00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.010\ndifferent and\ntake them to a different website.\n\n304\n00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.860\nAnd if they click on this olive over\nhere it might do something else.\n\n305\n00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.710\nSo that's what the image\nmap allows us to do,\n\n306\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:36.500\nit lets us specify certain areas\nwithin our image to generate a result.\n\n307\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.010\nSo if I select here, and\n\n308\n00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.660\nI do that now I've got this\nisolated out of the hot spot.\n\n309\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.500\nAnd when somebody hovers over that,\nit can do something.\n\n310\n00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.070\nOkay?\n\n311\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.120\nSo I can set that as a target,\nmaybe it brings up a separate webpage or\n\n312\n00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.400\ndoes something different.\n\n313\n00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.000\nAll right, and\nwe'll talk about that at a later time.\n\n314\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.450\nAnd then next thing I want to talk about,\nis since we've got assets\n\n315\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:00.000\nnow in our website I want to see what it\nlooks like out in a browser web page.\n\n316\n00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.440\nSo to do that,\nI'm gonna go back to my application here.\n\n317\n00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.671\nAnd in the bottom right hand corner right\nhere, you can see a little globe icon.\n\n318\n00:18:06.671 --> 00:18:11.734\nAnd this globe icon allows\nme to choose a browser for\n\n319\n00:18:11.734 --> 00:18:16.070\nwhich I want to view this design in.\n\n320\n00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.991\nBut before I do that, I wanna show you\nI've got Google Chrome here installed and\n\n321\n00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:20.300\nInternet Explorer installed, but\n\n322\n00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.275\nI would like to show you that\nI can add other browsers.\n\n323\n00:18:22.275 --> 00:18:26.077\nCuz remember, I think, Wes, when we\nwere talking about some other episodes,\n\n324\n00:18:26.077 --> 00:18:29.311\nwe had mentioned that as a developer,\na person creating webpages,\n\n325\n00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:33.490\nyou wanna have as many browsers as you\ncan download or get your hands on.\n\n326\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.260\nAnd I believe I also have\nFirefox installed here, and\n\n327\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.280\nI would like to make sure that\nFirefox is available to the system.\n\n328\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.600\nSo right now you can see that I've\ngot Google Chrome in this list,\n\n329\n00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.470\nas well as Internet Explorer.\n\n330\n00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.100\nAnd I can also see that Google Chrome\nhas an F12 next to it, and\n\n331\n00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.600\nthe reason why it has an F12 that\nis a function key, it's a shortcut.\n\n332\n00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.560\nSo while I'm in my design at\nany time I can hit F12 and\n\n333\n00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.130\nit will automatically try to\nload it in Google Chrome.\n\n334\n00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:00.560\nAnd that's because Google Chrome\nis set as my primary browser.\n\n335\n00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.950\nIf I wanted Internet Explorer to be my\nsecondary browser I can check this box\n\n336\n00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.090\ndown here and what that'll do is it'll\ngive me a different shortcut key, so\n\n337\n00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.510\nnow I've got two shortcut keys\navailable for these two browsers.\n\n338\n00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.180\nBut I'd like to add a new browser so\n\n339\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.049\nI'm going to hit this plus\nright here to add that in.\n\n340\n00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.180\nAnd when I do that I get a dialog box\nthat says hey go find the file and\n\n341\n00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.040\ngive it a name and\n\n342\n00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.390\nthen decide if you're gonna make it\nyour primary or your secondary browser.\n\n343\n00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.480\nI'm gonna browse out,\nwe're gonna search for Firefox.\n\n344\n00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.245\nSo at this point I think I have\nto look for m for Mozilla.\n\n345\n00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:31.895\nI think.\n\n346\n00:19:31.895 --> 00:19:33.723\nOr something.\n\n347\n00:19:33.723 --> 00:19:35.031\nWhere are we?\n\n348\n00:19:35.031 --> 00:19:36.451\nLet's see, I'm in my program files.\n\n349\n00:19:36.451 --> 00:19:39.785\nAnd I've got Internet Explorer.\n\n350\n00:19:39.785 --> 00:19:43.435\nI don't have Google Chrome here,\neither, so\n\n351\n00:19:43.435 --> 00:19:46.725\nthat tells me I need to be somewhere else.\n\n352\n00:19:46.725 --> 00:19:47.225\nOkay.\n\n353\n00:19:51.592 --> 00:19:53.292\nAnd then, here.\n\n354\n00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:56.836\nProbably here.\n\n355\n00:19:59.247 --> 00:20:00.640\nYep, there's Google.\n\n356\n00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.450\nSo, I just switched over to\nthe program files X86 folder.\n\n357\n00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.495\nNow, if I scroll through this\nlist I might in the MC Mozilla.\n\n358\n00:20:10.393 --> 00:20:11.200\nThere it is.\n\n359\n00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.801\nAnd there's Mozilla Firefox.\n\n360\n00:20:11.801 --> 00:20:17.130\nSo I click on that, open it up and\nthere's my Firefox executable file.\n\n361\n00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.252\nSo I'm gonna click okay or open.\n\n362\n00:20:18.252 --> 00:20:21.273\nAnd now I really don't want\nthe dot .exe in the name, so\n\n363\n00:20:21.273 --> 00:20:25.280\nI'm going to remove the .exe because\nthis is just a caption for the file.\n\n364\n00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.114\nI might even want to put my capital\nf's in there for Firefox and\n\n365\n00:20:29.114 --> 00:20:32.505\nthat kind of thing but\nthen it points to the location and\n\n366\n00:20:32.505 --> 00:20:37.298\nI am gonna make this one my secondary\nbrowser instead of Internet Explorer and\n\n367\n00:20:37.298 --> 00:20:40.911\nthe reason why I'm moving that\noff of Internet Explorer,\n\n368\n00:20:40.911 --> 00:20:45.817\nI should probably make Internet Explorer\nmy primary and it's built for that.\n\n369\n00:20:45.817 --> 00:20:49.430\nBecause over 800 million\npeople use Internet Explorer.\n\n370\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.260\nThey use some version\nof Internet Explorer.\n\n371\n00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.799\nAs a matter of fact, there are still\nversions of Internet Explorer from IE six,\n\n372\n00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:58.734\nseven, eight, nine, ten and\nnow Edge out there.\n\n373\n00:20:58.734 --> 00:21:03.530\nAnd so in some form somebody's\ngonna be using Internet Explorer.\n\n374\n00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:08.226\nThe problem is with Internet Explorer\nthat it isn't standards compliant.\n\n375\n00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:13.216\nFor the longest time,\nMicrosoft was trying to be proprietary and\n\n376\n00:21:13.216 --> 00:21:17.401\nso they didn't follow\nthe standards of the Internet.\n\n377\n00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:23.474\nUp until about 9,\nInternet Explorer supports up\n\n378\n00:21:23.474 --> 00:21:28.980\nto 75% of the HTML5 and CSS3 standards.\n\n379\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.210\nIt's about 95% for Internet Explorer 10.\n\n380\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.140\nAnd it's about it's I think a 100% for\nEdge okay.\n\n381\n00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.430\nSo, we gotta keep that in mind\nanything lower than eight\n\n382\n00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.570\nis not gonna be standards complaints.\n\n383\n00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.970\nAnd when we talk about responsive design\nyou're gonna see that were gonna bring in\n\n384\n00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.550\nsome files are going to make it.\n\n385\n00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:50.640\nSo, that way we can accommodate and\nexplore eight and lower.\n\n386\n00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.011\nBut, for now I've got my list\nof browsers that available and\n\n387\n00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:55.537\nI've chosen which one is my primary\nwhich one I want secondary.\n\n388\n00:21:55.537 --> 00:21:58.641\nAnd I'm going to say\nthat I need to save this,\n\n389\n00:21:58.641 --> 00:22:01.274\nif I can see where my okay icon is here.\n\n390\n00:22:01.274 --> 00:22:04.210\nI might not be able to get out of this and\nsave.\n\n391\n00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.267\nMy resolution's a little too high.\n\n392\n00:22:08.267 --> 00:22:13.230\nOkay, I tried hitting enter.\n\n393\n00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.910\nI'm scrolling through and\nI think that's it.\n\n394\n00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.540\nNope, next one.\n\n395\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.480\nThere we go.\nOkay, hopefully I saved.\n\n396\n00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.950\nSo now if I go down into, I was using\nthe tab key to cycle through each field.\n\n397\n00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:34.410\nSo this way I could find when it said\nOK cuz I couldn't see it on the screen.\n\n398\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.060\nAll right, so I go back to here and\nI should see that I have three.\n\n399\n00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.420\nI have three options available.\n\n400\n00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.650\nSo if I choose preview in Google Chrome,\nokay, it's gonna ask me to save,\n\n401\n00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.690\nwhich is standard because\nI made some changes.\n\n402\n00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.650\nIt needs to know what those changes are.\n\n403\n00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:54.120\nAnd once it's done doing that, here's\nwhat the webpage looks like so far, okay.\n\n404\n00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.380\nNow, yesterday, I mentioned that when we\ncreated our wrapper that our web page\n\n405\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.120\nwould always be centered if I did certain\nthings to the wrapper, and I'll talk about\n\n406\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.970\nthat in a later episode, but we're\ngonna style that so it's always center.\n\n407\n00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.410\nAs I move my browser in and\nout, I want it to be center.\n\n408\n00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.493\nRight now,\nit's hugging the left hand side, and\n\n409\n00:23:11.493 --> 00:23:14.531\nthat's good that the image was there,\ncuz that told me that so awesome.\n\n410\n00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:19.030\nOkay so at this point we have inserted an\nimage, we have several different methods\n\n411\n00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.742\nto insert the image, we've used\nthe insert menu, on the menu bar,\n\n412\n00:23:22.742 --> 00:23:27.433\nwe've used the panel, and we've also shown\nyou that you can drag and drop images into\n\n413\n00:23:27.433 --> 00:23:31.930\nyour design which is probably the one that\nyou're wanna gonna use the most often,\n\n414\n00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.020\nbecause you wanna be as\nintuitive as possible.\n\n415\n00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.800\nAnd that is there is no right or\nwrong way.\n\n416\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.320\nHowever, you should always consider\n\n417\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.035\nusing alt text when you\nadd an image to your site.\n\n418\n00:23:45.035 --> 00:23:48.625\nYou want to maintain 5O8C compliance,\nyou want to make sure that\n\n419\n00:23:48.625 --> 00:23:51.555\nyou're reaching to those people\nwho are visually impaired and\n\n420\n00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:54.485\nhave screen readers so\nthey can hear what the information is.\n\n421\n00:23:54.485 --> 00:23:57.805\nSo every image that you bring in,\nno matter what it is,\n\n422\n00:23:57.805 --> 00:24:03.055\nyou want to make sure that you have\nalt text in your properties panel.\n\n423\n00:24:03.055 --> 00:24:10.580\nSo click on the image itself and then go\ninto and select the alt text box, okay.\n\n424\n00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.140\nVery important.\n\n425\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.060\nAnd so\nthat is inserting images into your design.\n\n426\n00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:16.890\n>> Very good.\n\n427\n00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:18.600\nWe appreciate all that information.\n\n428\n00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.320\nIt does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode though,\n\n429\n00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.039\nbut before we sign off,\nJim do you got any parting words?\n\n430\n00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.610\n>> Yeah, just keep in mind that\nwhen you're designing that\n\n431\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.470\nyou're gonna get a lot of\npeople coming to your site so\n\n432\n00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.790\nyou always wanna design to\nthe least common denominator.\n\n433\n00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.610\nMeaning that somebody might\nhave a 12 inch monitor,\n\n434\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.420\nthey might not have\nthe best graphics card.\n\n435\n00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.240\nSo you might use JPG over\nPNG because JPG has better,\n\n436\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.650\nmore compression where it really\nmakes your file sizes smaller.\n\n437\n00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:53.840\nThey might be coming to you from\na place that only has dialup or\n\n438\n00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.790\nsatellite connectivity.\n\n439\n00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.990\nSo, these are considerations you should\nmake when you're thinking about your\n\n440\n00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:03.100\nwebsite and thinking about putting\ngraphics or images on your website.\n\n441\n00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.100\nAnd so those are the three\ngraphic types that you can use.\n\n442\n00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.880\nThe scalable retrographics are for\npeople who are going to use Illustrator or\n\n443\n00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.190\nsome kind of vector program to create\nthat, but other than that, PNG, JPEG, and\n\n444\n00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.180\nGIF are the file types we're gonna use.\n\n445\n00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.710\n>> Jim we do appreciate your expertise on\nthis information, and we appreciate you,\n\n446\n00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.280\nthe viewer out there, but we're gonna\nahead and take the time to sign out.\n\n447\n00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.130\nSigning out for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n448\n00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:27.990\n>> And I'm Jim Sorrels.\n\n449\n00:25:27.990 -->

00:00:16.540\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.520\nin today's episode we're moving\nthrough our series on Dreamweaver.\n\n5\n00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.470\nThat's right, we're coming back with\nmore of the Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n6\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.640\nJoining me back in the studios again\nis none other than Mr. Jim Searles.\n\n7\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.000\nJim, how are you doing sir?\n\n8\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.760\n>> I'm doing great again today, Mr. West.\n\n9\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.210\nThank you for having me back.\n\n10\n00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.150\nAnd thank you for the ITProTV team for\ninviting me to come back and\n\n11\n00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.200\ntalk to you about Dreamweaver and\nspecifically,\n\n12\n00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.440\nthis time we're gonna talking about\ninserting links into your design.\n\n13\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.980\nSo previously we talked about images, and\nright below the banner image that we've\n\n14\n00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.310\ninserted we have a spot for\nour navigation.\n\n15\n00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.900\nIn other previous episodes,\n\n16\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.660\nwe talked about the guidelines around\nwhat you should have for navigation.\n\n17\n00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.980\nBut now I'd like to talk\nabout navigation and linking.\n\n18\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.360\nSo there are three types of links\nthat you have on your websites and\n\n19\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.970\nthose are internal links,\nexternal links, and incoming links.\n\n20\n00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.870\nSo an internal link is basically a link\nbetween webpages on your website.\n\n21\n00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.740\nSo when you go to and click on home or you\nclick on about us or you click on careers.\n\n22\n00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.095\nBasically what that does is it take you\nto a page on your website that gives that\n\n23\n00:01:25.095 --> 00:01:28.054\nperson the information\nthat they're looking for.\n\n24\n00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.661\nSo the navigation indicates\nwhat that information is and\n\n25\n00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:33.130\nthen the page displays the detail.\n\n26\n00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.400\nAn external link is where you might\nreference Facebook, or Twitter, or\n\n27\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.230\nyou might reference social\nmedia of some kind, Instagram.\n\n28\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.960\nSo those are some options that you\nwould have available on your site.\n\n29\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.590\nSo you might have an image of the Facebook\nicon, or an image of the Instagram icon.\n\n30\n00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.120\nSomebody clicks on that it takes them out.\n\n31\n00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.820\nThat's an external link.\n\n32\n00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.880\nAlso, the last one is a incoming link.\n\n33\n00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.210\nFor ITProTv for example,\nthey might be advertising on Twit and\n\n34\n00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.440\nso we end up getting a link from\nTwit that comes in to your site.\n\n35\n00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.230\nSo those would be the incoming\nlinks into your site.\n\n36\n00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.830\nSo, all of those are very\nimportant to understand and\n\n37\n00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.840\nto utilize while you're\ndesigning your site.\n\n38\n00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.590\nSo at this point in time,\nI'd like to go into our design and\n\n39\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.580\nstart working on our navigation\nsection and our division.\n\n40\n00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.000\nSo right underneath the image, where we\nhad our image for the banner that we added\n\n41\n00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.460\nearlier, I'm going to click in here and\nI'm going to delete the text that's here.\n\n42\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.700\nThis is pretty common to what we have\ndone before where we did the image.\n\n43\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.360\nWe removed the information and\nit allowed us to do what we needed to do.\n\n44\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.340\nIn this case I'm going to put maybe\nfive words here in this section.\n\n45\n00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.758\nAnd I'm going to convert them\ninto an unordered list, okay.\n\n46\n00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:51.670\nSo I'm gonna type in for example the word\nhome, because you always need a way for\n\n47\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.019\npeople to get back to your home page.\n\n48\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.790\nAnd then I'm going to hit,\nin the properties panel down here,\n\n49\n00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.420\nI'm gonna hit the Bulleted List icon.\n\n50\n00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.220\nDown here in the properties panel,\n\n51\n00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.950\nI have this icon right here which\nshows me text next to a bullet.\n\n52\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.526\nIt's between the text that shows\nyou one two three, Ordered list and\n\n53\n00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:13.784\nthe Italics icon.\n\n54\n00:03:13.784 --> 00:03:16.659\nSo I can click on this icon\nright here on Ordered list and\n\n55\n00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.640\nwhat it will do is it'll\nbulletize that item.\n\n56\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.530\nSo instantly, I get a bullet next to home.\n\n57\n00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.450\nSo I want a new one, so I hit Enter and\nI'm just adding bullets,\n\n58\n00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.070\njust like I would inside of\na Word application at this point.\n\n59\n00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.820\nSo we've got Home,\n\n60\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.590\nand then my next thought would\nbe like an About Us, hit Enter.\n\n61\n00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.320\nAnd then, I would have maybe for\nexample, company information or news.\n\n62\n00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.179\nWe'll put company news out here,\nhit Enter.\n\n63\n00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:46.373\nAnd another one that we have that's often,\nis if you're looking for\n\n64\n00:03:46.373 --> 00:03:47.650\ncareers with our company.\n\n65\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.500\nAnd then the last one is usually a way for\nyour customer or\n\n66\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.730\nthe person visiting your site to contact\nyou, so we would have a Contact Us.\n\n67\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.250\nSo those would be the five or\nso that I would use.\n\n68\n00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.530\nRemember, we don't wanna have more than\nseven, and notice none of my links in this\n\n69\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.070\nnavigation, none of them\nare more than two words.\n\n70\n00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.310\nOkay, so that's important to keep in mind.\n\n71\n00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.320\nNow, you're probably looking at this and\nsaying, wait,\n\n72\n00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.680\nthese are stacked one on top of the other,\nand how is it that this becomes a link,\n\n73\n00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.040\nor a navigation bar underneath the banner.\n\n74\n00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.980\nWell, we gotta use CSS\nstyling to change this up.\n\n75\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.490\nAnd one of the things that we're gonna do,\nis we're gonna make is so this list,\n\n76\n00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.800\nthis unordered list,\nno longer has, as bullets.\n\n77\n00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.850\nWe're gonna make it so\nthat way they're gonna be side by side.\n\n78\n00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.600\nAnd we're gonna change some things up\ninside of the design of this list.\n\n79\n00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.920\nSo what I'd like to do is I'd\nlike to draw your attention\n\n80\n00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.330\nonto this bar down here where I see Body,\nDiv, Wrapper, Nav and UL LI.\n\n81\n00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.240\nThis is known as our tag selector bar.\n\n82\n00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.840\nThe tag selected bar will show me what\nHTML tags I'm currently sitting in.\n\n83\n00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.870\nSo wherever my cursor is\nit shows me those tags.\n\n84\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.050\nSo if I click on the image for example,\nnow it's going to say body, div, wrapper,\n\n85\n00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.800\nheader, image,\nbecause the image is inside the header.\n\n86\n00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.400\nBut if I click back in the text,\nthe text is inside the mav.\n\n87\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.120\nAnd it's inside of an unordered list.\n\n88\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.730\nUL is Unordered List.\n\n89\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.470\nLI is a list item.\n\n90\n00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.650\nOkay, so I can configure these\nitems by selecting these tags and\n\n91\n00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.930\nI'd like to select, for example,\nthe UL, the Unordered List.\n\n92\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.030\nBecause I'd like to\nturn off those bullets.\n\n93\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.240\nNow, when I select the UL,\n\n94\n00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.050\ninstantly it selects all of the content\nwithin that unordered list.\n\n95\n00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.160\nNow, I'm going to go over here,\nto my CSS designer panel, and\n\n96\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.630\nI'm gonna click on that, and\nI'm going to Insert a new selector.\n\n97\n00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.850\nSo just like we did the other day,\nwhen we created the style for\n\n98\n00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.710\nthe body where we added black background\nand white text I can come in here and\n\n99\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.410\nadd a style specific to this on our list.\n\n100\n00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.170\nSo I'm gonna click the plus here\nin the selector section and\n\n101\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.050\nit's gonna say okay this unordered\nlist is inside the wrapper,\n\n102\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.419\ninside the navigation,\ninside the unordered list.\n\n103\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.930\nNow this is known as specificity.\n\n104\n00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.160\nI'm being very specific.\n\n105\n00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.170\nNow I could remove everything\nto the left of UL.\n\n106\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.530\nAnd I could effect every\nunordered list on my page.\n\n107\n00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.830\nBut the problem with that might have\nhyperlinks or links in my footer, for\n\n108\n00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.230\nexample, and then they're going\nto get the same structure.\n\n109\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.140\nI might not want that,\nso by using specificity,\n\n110\n00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.680\nI'm saying no, only affect the un ordered\nlist inside of the navigation bar.\n\n111\n00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.940\nThat means that only those items\nwill be affected by this style\n\n112\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.430\nthat I'm going to create.\n\n113\n00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.688\nSo, when I hit that plus,\n\n114\n00:06:30.688 --> 00:06:36.668\nit said that these are all of\nthe tags that this item is inside of.\n\n115\n00:06:36.668 --> 00:06:39.972\nSo, I'm gonna leave that the way it is,\nand I'm gonna hit enter, and\n\n116\n00:06:39.972 --> 00:06:43.782\ninstantly my properties panel here to the\nright now shows me the properties that I\n\n117\n00:06:43.782 --> 00:06:45.680\ncan use to affect this list.\n\n118\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.880\nAs a matter of fact, if I scroll\nthrough the list, I can see my width,\n\n119\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.580\nmy height for that section.\n\n120\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.490\nI can keep going down.\n\n121\n00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.780\nI can see margins, padding, position.\n\n122\n00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.010\nI can see that I can float that.\n\n123\n00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.200\nI also have some text options.\n\n124\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.700\nWe saw this the other day where\nI changed the text to white, and\n\n125\n00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.940\nthe font family I chose,\nI think it was Gothic or something.\n\n126\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.283\nI've got Line Height.\n\n127\n00:07:04.283 --> 00:07:06.640\nI've got Text Decoration here.\n\n128\n00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.520\nSo I can do some text items.\n\n129\n00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.780\nI can have alignment, Left,\nRight, Center alignment.\n\n130\n00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.450\nI can do some indentation.\n\n131\n00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.370\nIf I keep going down,\nI will see some other options.\n\n132\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.190\nI have Text Transformation,\nLine Position, Vertical Alignment, so\n\n133\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.290\nthat is going to be something to do\nwith my text that I want to affect,\n\n134\n00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.770\nbut it isn't inside of these\nproperties category for text so\n\n135\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.730\nwhat I really have to do, is I have to\ngo back to the top for categories and\n\n136\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.770\nI have to click on this\nicon with three dots.\n\n137\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.730\nThis is known as an ellipsis.\n\n138\n00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.670\nSo when I click on that, I'm now able to\ntype in whatever property I'm looking for.\n\n139\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.590\nBecause I'm working with a list,\nthis is called a list style type.\n\n140\n00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.360\nAnd the IntelliSense or\nthe screen tips come up.\n\n141\n00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.066\nI can click on that item and now I\nhave some options that are available.\n\n142\n00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:53.865\nWell, each of these options will\ngive me a different type of bullet.\n\n143\n00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:57.019\nSo I could choose Armenian, I could\nchoose circle, I could choose disc.\n\n144\n00:07:57.019 --> 00:08:01.360\nI could choose Hebrew or Fergana,\nI could choose lowercase Roman,\n\n145\n00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.990\nthat kind of thing.\n\n146\n00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.050\nBut in this case I want to turn them off,\nso\n\n147\n00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.640\nif I choose none, the bullets disappear.\n\n148\n00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.570\nSo no more bullets to the left of\nmy little guys, all right, and\n\n149\n00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.650\nthat's basically what I want\nfrom the un-ordered list.\n\n150\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.310\nI want to turn off those bullets, and\n\n151\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:23.610\nthe list-styled-type:done\nallowed that to happen.\n\n152\n00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:28.640\nNow the next thing I would like to do is\nI would like to make sure that my items,\n\n153\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.770\nmy list items are not stacked\none on top of the other.\n\n154\n00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:37.080\nI like them to be side by side or\nwhat we call in line with each other.\n\n155\n00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.750\nThey're all gonna fall in line.\n\n156\n00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.170\nSo I'm clicking back inside\nof my list to get the text.\n\n157\n00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.990\nAnd this time I'm going to click on\nthe LI tag inside the tag selector.\n\n158\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.140\nSo right here I've got the LI tag,\nI click on that.\n\n159\n00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.280\nAnd it's going to make it so\n\n160\n00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.230\nI can make a new selector type\nin my CSS designer panel.\n\n161\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.490\nNow, it's looking at\nnav space ul space li.\n\n162\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.800\nSo we're being very specific\nwe're only in the navigation.\n\n163\n00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.670\nWe're going to affect the list\nitems inside of there.\n\n164\n00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.070\nAnd from here what I want to do is I\nwant to change the display of the item.\n\n165\n00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.330\nSo again, with the more button selected\nhere, I can type in what I want, and\n\n166\n00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.920\nI'm gonna to type in the word display, and\n\n167\n00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.500\nthe display I'm trying to change is I'm\ntrying not to make it compact or block.\n\n168\n00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.090\nWhat block will do is it will make it so\nthere are little squares around it, and\n\n169\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.550\nI can specify the width I want,\nbut what I really want is in line.\n\n170\n00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.290\nI want them to all be in line.\n\n171\n00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.490\nNow if I chose inline-block\nhere it'll make it so\n\n172\n00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.600\nI can specify a width and\nit'll have a block around them.\n\n173\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.600\nSo if I did choose to add color behind it,\n\n174\n00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.820\nnow they would have a block of color,\nokay?\n\n175\n00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.790\nSo if I just choose inline\nwhat's It's gonna happen now.\n\n176\n00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.120\nNow they are no longer stacked\none on top of the other.\n\n177\n00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.680\nThey are side by side by side.\n\n178\n00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.030\nWell as you can imagine, now it just looks\nlike a list of words strung together.\n\n179\n00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.910\nSo it's a bad grammar,\npoor sentence, right?\n\n180\n00:09:54.910 --> 00:10:00.700\nSo what I need to do now is I need to\ntell in CSS using cascading style sheets,\n\n181\n00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.670\nI need to specify that I want a certain\ndistance away from each other.\n\n182\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.880\nI need to specify these properties for\n\n183\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.570\nthe layout of these items.So I'm going to\nstay inside the NAV ULLI tag here, and I'm\n\n184\n00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.420\ngoing to go back up to my layout option,\nthe layout category, and i can choose for\n\n185\n00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.900\nexample to add padding now I'm going to\ntalk about these two items right here.\n\n186\n00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:28.840\nMargin and padding margin is\nalways outside of the box.\n\n187\n00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.310\nPadding is always inside the box.\n\n188\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.270\nSo that's why you see the graphic here.\n\n189\n00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.910\nThe graphic is showing a small box\non margin with the white area,\n\n190\n00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.870\nbut the padding on the outside says yeah,\nI'm inside the box and\n\n191\n00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.220\nI'm pushing the boundaries of\nthe box away from the content.\n\n192\n00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.500\nSo that's what we're talking about.\n\n193\n00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.700\nSo this one's outside of the box,\nand this one's inside.\n\n194\n00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.370\nSo I can go either direction here.\n\n195\n00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.310\nI could say, well each list\nitem is one item by itself and\n\n196\n00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.600\nI could add space in between\neach of those items.\n\n197\n00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.210\nSo I could come out here and actually say,\nyou know what, I need space to the right\n\n198\n00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.160\nof each of those words, and I could\nchoose the right margin right here.\n\n199\n00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.250\nAnd I could say, yeah,\ngive me five pixels worth of space.\n\n200\n00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.920\nSo again, we're dealing with pixels.\n\n201\n00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.280\nAnd pixels are the unit of measurement for\neach dot on your screen.\n\n202\n00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.130\nAnd it is a relative measurement, so\n\n203\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.220\ndepending on what your screen resolution\nis, you'll get either more space or\n\n204\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.320\nless space, so\nit's a relative unit of measurement.\n\n205\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.550\nWhen I hit Enter,\nit increases the space in between those.\n\n206\n00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.990\nNow 5 wasn't enough,\nI'm actually gonna up that to about 15,\n\n207\n00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.070\ncuz I'm thinking that\nmight work out better.\n\n208\n00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:34.880\nNow, it isn't an exact science, as you can\ntell, I'm sort of trying to get a feel for\n\n209\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.040\nwhat's going on and\n\n210\n00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.730\ntrying to make sure that I've got the\nspacing that I want visually on the page.\n\n211\n00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:44.980\nSo here I'm using margin to add\nthe space between each of those words.\n\n212\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.200\nNow the next thing I like to do\nsometimes is I like to put a border,\n\n213\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.130\nlike a little vertical\nbar after each word.\n\n214\n00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.580\nSo I could go into my category\nselectors up here and\n\n215\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.830\nchoose this item right here which\nis a border icon, I click on that.\n\n216\n00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.820\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna choose to put a border\n\n217\n00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.660\nto the right of each of those words.\n\n218\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.840\nAnd I'm gonna go in and\nselect the right border right here, and\n\n219\n00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.990\nI'm going to click where\nit says the width.\n\n220\n00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.190\nWhen I click to select the width,\nit's gonna offer me, again,\n\n221\n00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:17.130\nmy units of measurement.\n\n222\n00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.690\nI'm gonna choose 1 pixel of width,\nso you're just gonna barely see\n\n223\n00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.990\nthe border that's gonna appear\nto the right, now, the style.\n\n224\n00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.990\nThe style lets me choose\nis it going to be dashed,\n\n225\n00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.650\ndotted, is it going to be a solid line,\nso how is that line going to look?\n\n226\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.200\nSo if I click on that again I get\na bunch of options to choose from,\n\n227\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.150\nI don't have to guess I can\nactually pick it from the list and\n\n228\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.750\nin this case I want it to be a solid line.\n\n229\n00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.540\nAnd then the last thing I\nneed to choose is the color,\n\n230\n00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.980\nwell you can start to see that\nit's already building that item.\n\n231\n00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.980\nAnd it's showing up and it's showing\nup to the right of each of those.\n\n232\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.060\nThe color right now, it's doing white\nby default because it's picking up\n\n233\n00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.660\nthe color from the style that we used for\nbody.\n\n234\n00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.810\nWhen we did the body style,\nit's picking up that white color but we're\n\n235\n00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:04.120\ngonna specify white just for this example,\nmake sure it's getting the white color.\n\n236\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:10.370\nAll right, so I've got white and or\nwhatever the semblance of white is.\n\n237\n00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.460\nIt's fdfdfd I'm not sure why.\n\n238\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.150\nThere we go.\n\n239\n00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.980\nOkay here's white.\n\n240\n00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.760\nPure white is ffffff.\n\n241\n00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.450\nNow the problem that I'm seeing is\nthat that border is touching the text.\n\n242\n00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.780\nIt's hugging that text.\n\n243\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.620\nRemember when we spread out\nour words we use margins.\n\n244\n00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.560\nSo we said go outside the box and\npush the text away.\n\n245\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:35.310\nSo what I'd like to use now is padding\nto move the border away from the text.\n\n246\n00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.680\nSo I'm gonna go back up to my layout here.\n\n247\n00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:44.970\nFind the padding, and I'm probably going\nto push that away, maybe about five pixels\n\n248\n00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.610\naway from each word to start, and I'm\ngoing to do it from the right side again.\n\n249\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.170\nSo I'm gonna click here\non the right-hand side,\n\n250\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.460\nand I'm gonna do five pixels\nworth of padding, press enter.\n\n251\n00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.680\nAnd you can see it's pushing it away.\n\n252\n00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.960\nIt's still not enough,\nsince I did 15, I think,\n\n253\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.140\naway from each word,\nI might have to do 15 from that border.\n\n254\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.990\nSo let me give 15 a try.\n\n255\n00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.180\nThat seems to be a good\nnumber to work with, and\n\n256\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.430\nit should look like that line is right\nin the center in between everything now.\n\n257\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.630\nSo now you can see the word, the line, the\nword, the line, the word, the line and so\n\n258\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.420\non and so forth.\n\n259\n00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.880\nIt gives you a perfect balance of\nwhat's going on within that group.\n\n260\n00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.130\nSo at this point I haven't really made\nthese into hyperlinks though, right?\n\n261\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.250\nThere still just text that people can see,\nand at least\n\n262\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.980\nvisually now it looks like a normal\nnavigation bar that you've seen before.\n\n263\n00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.790\nSo here's what I wanna do to\nadd a hyperlink to that text.\n\n264\n00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.930\nNow we know that if\nsomebody clicks on home,\n\n265\n00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.340\nit's always going to go to index.html,\nthat's our home page.\n\n266\n00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.660\nSo I'm gonna select the word home,\n\n267\n00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.310\nI'm gonna go to my insert panel up here at\nthe top and I'm gonna click hyper link.\n\n268\n00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.410\nSo right here, I'm going to click\nthis chain link to add a hyperlink.\n\n269\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.480\nThis dialog box is going to come up and\ni could change the text if I wanted to.\n\n270\n00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.330\nMaybe I would want to write in homepage or\nsomething, and in which case,\n\n271\n00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.890\nit will add the words homepage when\nI hit okay to accept that, but\n\n272\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.770\ni really want the word home so I'm going\nto leave that alone, now, the link.\n\n273\n00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:11.300\nThe link here is asking me what webpage or\nwhat site, or what do I want to link to.\n\n274\n00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.150\nNow there is a pull down available.\n\n275\n00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.050\nIf I've used something in the past,\nI can reuse it again.\n\n276\n00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.070\nSo if I'm emulating my\nnavigation bar into my footer,\n\n277\n00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.500\nthen I can do that all over again so\nI don't have to look for it again.\n\n278\n00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.160\nBut I have a browse button here, a folder.\n\n279\n00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.150\nThe browse button will allow me\nto go find the Index file, and\n\n280\n00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.200\nthere it is index.html.\n\n281\n00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.300\nI click OK and it instantly brings it in.\n\n282\n00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.050\nNow Target, Target determines\nhow it's going to behave.\n\n283\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:43.124\nIf I choose to tell the Home button,\nevery time you click on Home,\n\n284\n00:15:43.124 --> 00:15:45.019\nit opens up underscore blank.\n\n285\n00:15:45.019 --> 00:15:48.235\nThat means a new tab is going\nto appear in some browser's or\n\n286\n00:15:48.235 --> 00:15:51.595\na whole new browser's going\nto appear in other browser's.\n\n287\n00:15:51.595 --> 00:15:55.136\nFor example, IE handles underscore\nblank by bringing up a new browser.\n\n288\n00:15:55.136 --> 00:16:00.010\nWhereas Firefox yourhandles_blank might\nbring you up a new tab, for example.\n\n289\n00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.750\nSame thing with the word new.\n\n290\n00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.410\nIf I choose the word new it'll either\nbring up a new browser or a new tab,\n\n291\n00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.400\ndepending on the browser you're using,\nokay?\n\n292\n00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.040\nAnd then these three other\nones _parent _self _top,\n\n293\n00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:17.670\nin some cases are deprecated, but\nbasically are useful for IFrames, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.780\nSo if you're using an IFrame,\n\n295\n00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.240\nyou can determine which IFrame\nyou're going to target.\n\n296\n00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.550\nIs it the parent of the IFrame\nyou're currently in?\n\n297\n00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.310\nIs it the top of the IFrame?\n\n298\n00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.510\nIs it the IFrame you're in?\n\n299\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.604\nThat kind of thing, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:27.604 --> 00:16:30.507\nBut we're gonna choose either new or\nblank in this example, and\n\n301\n00:16:30.507 --> 00:16:32.595\nI'm gonna just choose _blank.\n\n302\n00:16:32.595 --> 00:16:36.065\nAnd what that will do is it will\nopen up a new browser window.\n\n303\n00:16:36.065 --> 00:16:37.295\nNow I might not like that behavior, so\n\n304\n00:16:37.295 --> 00:16:39.825\nI might have to come back in and\njust remove that all together and\n\n305\n00:16:39.825 --> 00:16:43.595\njust leave it blank, which means it'll\noverwrite the page you're currently on.\n\n306\n00:16:43.595 --> 00:16:46.035\nAnd I will tell you,\nif you're working with a company and\n\n307\n00:16:46.035 --> 00:16:50.500\nyou're working with marketing,\nthey're always going to want _blank.\n\n308\n00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.540\nThis way, no matter what link you\nclick on, it will open a new page.\n\n309\n00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.590\nSo if somebody clicks on a hyperlink on\nyour website and they leave your website\n\n310\n00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.720\nand they forgot to purchase the product on\nyour website, when they close the websites\n\n311\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.700\ndown one by one, they'll see that website\nback and they'll say, yeah, I forgot,\n\n312\n00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.370\nI didn't purchase what I was looking for,\nand it will bring them back.\n\n313\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.560\nThat's what marketing's all about, right?\n\n314\n00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:14.420\nNow, the title is sort of like\nthe alt text, but for links.\n\n315\n00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.139\nBasically alt text lets\nthe screenreaders read the information.\n\n316\n00:17:18.139 --> 00:17:21.217\nNow it is gonna read the word home,\nit won't have a problem reading that.\n\n317\n00:17:21.217 --> 00:17:26.070\nBut what happens is, if you hover over it,\nit will show you that screen tip.\n\n318\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.860\nThe title will show you the screen tip.\n\n319\n00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.080\nAgain, this is very useful for\nsearch engine optimization, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.690\nSo having titles in here will be good.\n\n321\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.200\nSo I'm gonna type in Returns,\nReturn to homepage.\n\n322\n00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.542\nAnd you might say, return to\nCNN.com homepage, or my homepage,\n\n323\n00:17:42.542 --> 00:17:47.240\nactually I'm using the word my, so\nI'm gonna say My Homepage in this example.\n\n324\n00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.300\nNow, Access key and Tab index, some people\ndon't like to use the mouse, right?\n\n325\n00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.990\nThey wanna use the keyboard for\neverything.\n\n326\n00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:58.000\nSo the Access key, I could turn this into\nthe letter H, so they could do Ctrl+H or\n\n327\n00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.360\nthey could do Cmd+H, or they could\ndo the letter H on the keyboard,\n\n328\n00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.930\nit will automatically\ntrigger that hyperlink.\n\n329\n00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:08.410\nAnd then Tab index is another one of those\nthat will help search engine optimization.\n\n330\n00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:15.020\nBecause what that'll do is it'll allow you\nto specify what order these should go in.\n\n331\n00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.990\nEarlier, I was having a problem\nnot being able to see the OK\n\n332\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:19.770\nbutton in one of my dialog boxes.\n\n333\n00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.310\nSo I started hitting the tab key on\nthe keyboard, which allowed me to cycle\n\n334\n00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.670\nthrough each field within that dialog\nbox until I thought I was on OK and\n\n335\n00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:31.290\nwhen I hit enter on the keyboard,\nit automatically triggered that.\n\n336\n00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.040\nSo, I could hit tab key right now, and\n\n337\n00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.330\nyou'll see my cursor cycles through all\nof the fields, just like we had earlier.\n\n338\n00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.350\nSo, that's the same thing.\n\n339\n00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:42.270\nYou can have the tab key work on your\nwebsite, and it will cycle through, or\n\n340\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.030\nyou can specify the order in\nwhich these should go in.\n\n341\n00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:48.350\nI know I've got five hyperlinks, so\nI could type in the number five here and\n\n342\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.910\nhome will be last, okay?\n\n343\n00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.340\nThat would annoy people, but\nI could make it the last one.\n\n344\n00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.720\nOr I could jumble up all of them and\nmake it go in a chaotic order.\n\n345\n00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.908\nBut you want to have Home go first, About\nUs go second, Company News go third, and\n\n346\n00:18:59.908 --> 00:19:00.891\nso on and so forth.\n\n347\n00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:03.928\nAlso this will help with your search\nengine optimization if you have\n\n348\n00:19:03.928 --> 00:19:04.576\nthat in here.\n\n349\n00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:09.480\nSo I'm gonna put that in there, click OK,\nand now what you see is the word Home has\n\n350\n00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.522\nbecome a blue hyperlink that you'd\nnormally see on the Internet,\n\n351\n00:19:13.522 --> 00:19:17.210\nand we've now created our first hyperlink.\n\n352\n00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:21.460\nBefore we test the hyperlink out, I would\nlike to see what it looks like in code.\n\n353\n00:19:22.508 --> 00:19:27.608\nSo I'm gonna go to the Code view,\nand right here in my list items,\n\n354\n00:19:27.608 --> 00:19:32.370\nso I've got my unordered list,\nyou now see that I have an anchor tag.\n\n355\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:36.420\nSo here's my unordered list,\nhere's my individual list item and\n\n356\n00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.390\na list item is a container for those\nitems, but then I have an anchor tag.\n\n357\n00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:46.967\nAn anchor tag is basically\nhow you describe a hyperlink.\n\n358\n00:19:46.967 --> 00:19:52.402\nNow the href is hypertext reference,\nhref stands for hypertext reference.\n\n359\n00:19:52.402 --> 00:19:55.260\nAnd in this case, the hypertext\nreference equals the Index.html, so\n\n360\n00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.980\nit's pointing to the file that it's\ngonna call up when you click on it.\n\n361\n00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.000\nNow, everything else you\nsee here is an attribute.\n\n362\n00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.706\nIt's the tabindex of 1, the title says\nReturn to My Homepage, the accesskey is h,\n\n363\n00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:08.050\nthe target is _blank.\n\n364\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.490\nSo all those fields that we filled in,\nit wrote the code for us.\n\n365\n00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:16.230\nThen you can see, I close off the anchor\ntag, and then I have the word Home.\n\n366\n00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:20.160\nSo basically, the open anchor tag,\nthe open a tag,\n\n367\n00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.320\nis before the word home, and then\nthe closing a tag is after the word home.\n\n368\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.410\nSo that now tells it, hey this is\nthe boundaries of my hyperlink and\n\n369\n00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.600\nthat's where the hyperlink belongs.\n\n370\n00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:37.684\nOkay, so now that we've created that,\nI'm gonna do my Cmnd+S on a Mac,\n\n371\n00:20:37.684 --> 00:20:42.310\nCtrl+S on a PC, and\nCmnd+S on a Mac, to save the file.\n\n372\n00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.030\nI no longer have an asterisk there.\n\n373\n00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:49.345\nAnd now I'm gonna go down to\nbrowse in Firefox for example.\n\n374\n00:20:49.345 --> 00:20:52.880\nIt'll bring it up,\nit's now my default browser.\n\n375\n00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.160\nThat's okay, not now.\n\n376\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.600\nBut you can see now,\nwe're starting to build a webpage and\n\n377\n00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.040\nhere's my hyperlink, okay?\n\n378\n00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.930\nAnd notice my little pointy finger.\n\n379\n00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.311\nIt actually literally shows me\nthat I have a hyperlink and\n\n380\n00:21:03.311 --> 00:21:07.969\nwhen I click on it, it takes me in this\ncase, to my sample site, index.html.\n\n381\n00:21:07.969 --> 00:21:12.024\nBut notice, I told you the behavior on\nFirefox is it's gonna open up _blank in\n\n382\n00:21:12.024 --> 00:21:13.879\na new tab, and that's what it did.\n\n383\n00:21:13.879 --> 00:21:18.880\nI now have two tabs for the same site, but\nit showed you that it actually worked.\n\n384\n00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.910\nSo I might not want that for\nthe home tab, for example,\n\n385\n00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.885\ncuz you're still going\nwithin your same site.\n\n386\n00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:27.865\nYou might wanna do that for external links\nthat you might create on your webpage.\n\n387\n00:21:27.865 --> 00:21:29.955\nBut in this example, I wanted to do it so\n\n388\n00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:32.555\nyou could see that it was\nactually working, and it is.\n\n389\n00:21:32.555 --> 00:21:34.015\nSo fantastic.\n\n390\n00:21:34.015 --> 00:21:37.665\nSo I'm gonna close out of this,\nclose out of my browser here as well.\n\n391\n00:21:38.895 --> 00:21:41.260\nAnd go back to my Design view.\n\n392\n00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.580\nNow, the next thing I probably want\nto talk about is changing the color,\n\n393\n00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.590\nstill finding some way to\nindicate that it is a hyperlink.\n\n394\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.810\nCuz you want people to know\nthey're hyperlinks, right?\n\n395\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.880\nYou don't want it to be just text, and\n\n396\n00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.230\nyou don't want it to look like\nit doesn't have that underscore.\n\n397\n00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.832\nBut you wanna do something, maybe if they\nhover over it it changes the color and\n\n398\n00:21:57.832 --> 00:21:58.510\nthat kind of thing.\n\n399\n00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.790\nAnd that's something we can\ntalk about at a later episode.\n\n400\n00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:06.940\nBut for now, that is adding hyperlinks\nto your design within Dreamweaver.\n\n401\n00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.170\n>> Thank you very much there, Jim.\n\n402\n00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.070\nIt's amazing to see these little\ncomponents behind the scenes.\n\n403\n00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.580\nI've been browsing the Internet for\na while and\n\n404\n00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.560\nthen you actually are opening it up and\nshowing us what's under the hood there.\n\n405\n00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.110\nAnd I noticed when you did\nthe little hover there,\n\n406\n00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:24.470\nyour information's coming up there,\nthat whole hover to discover, right?\n\n407\n00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.250\nSo really, really good information.\n\n408\n00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.410\nNow, like you said,\n\n409\n00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.350\nit does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n410\n00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.736\nSo before we go, though,\ndo you have any additional words?\n\n411\n00:22:32.736 --> 00:22:36.022\n>> Yes, keep in mind that when\nyou're working with hyperlinks,\n\n412\n00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:40.424\nthe guidelines are that you shouldn't have\nany more than seven in your navigation,\n\n413\n00:22:40.424 --> 00:22:42.904\nyou shouldn't use any more than two words,\nand\n\n414\n00:22:42.904 --> 00:22:45.828\nyou should make sure that\nthere's not a lot of clutter.\n\n415\n00:22:45.828 --> 00:22:48.742\nThat it looks organized, and\nthat the information is clear and concise,\n\n416\n00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:50.440\ncuz you want people to\nbe able to navigate.\n\n417\n00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.990\nWe talked about the fact that there\nare three types of hyperlinks,\n\n418\n00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:55.990\ninternal, external and incoming.\n\n419\n00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:02.420\nSo you can see the anchor tag\nprovides you a way to gain access to\n\n420\n00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:08.760\nother pages, or\nother websites out on the Internet.\n\n421\n00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.422\nIt allows your website to\nbecome a little bit bigger,\n\n422\n00:23:11.422 --> 00:23:13.266\nbecause you're using these links.\n\n423\n00:23:13.266 --> 00:23:15.119\n>> Jim,\nwe do appreciate your information on this.\n\n424\n00:23:15.119 --> 00:23:16.548\nAnd we appreciate you, the viewer.\n\n425\n00:23:16.548 --> 00:23:19.720\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n426\n00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.730\n>> And Jim Sorrels.\n\n427\n00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.000\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n428\n00:23:23.187 --> 00:23:30.770\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.073\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode, we're moving through and\n\n4\n00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:21.390\ncontinuing on with our Dreamweaver series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.510\nThat's right, we're coming back with\nmore of the creative cloud, 2015.\n\n6\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.000\nAnd joining me in the studios today\nis none other than Mr. Jim Surrels.\n\n7\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.350\nJim, how you doing today?\n\n8\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.960\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\nthank-you for having me again today.\n\n9\n00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.721\nAnd thank-you to the ITProTV team for\n\n10\n00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.220\nallowing me to talk\nmore about Dreamweaver.\n\n11\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.410\nAnd specifically, now we're going\nto add some multimedia content\n\n12\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.660\ninto our design that\nwe've been working on.\n\n13\n00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.680\nSo, I have my index file open.\n\n14\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.660\nWe've created hyper links.\n\n15\n00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.610\nWe've added an image.\n\n16\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.784\nNow, I'd like to add some content to the\nmain section that is multimedia in nature.\n\n17\n00:00:52.784 --> 00:00:57.130\nSo, it's going to be either audio or\nit's going to be video in some way.\n\n18\n00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.400\nAnd I'd like to talk about that\na little bit, before we add that in.\n\n19\n00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.170\nBut the good thing about HTML 5 is,\nit was developed for our multimedia age.\n\n20\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.810\nAnd it was developed for everything\nthat we do that is video and audio, so\n\n21\n00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.470\nit's built for today's technologies.\n\n22\n00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.435\nAnd specifically, there are tags.\n\n23\n00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:21.230\nA tag called an audio tag,\nor an audio HTML element and\n\n24\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.850\nthere's a video HTML element, as well.\n\n25\n00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.420\nThis is specific just for these items.\n\n26\n00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.160\nWhen we talk about, for\nexample, the audio element.\n\n27\n00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.870\nThere are three file types that\nwe can use in our browser, or\n\n28\n00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.348\nthat browser's recognize, and\nthat is the .mp3 file format, okay.\n\n29\n00:01:39.348 --> 00:01:44.170\nThe .ogg file format, and\nthe .wav file format.\n\n30\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.770\nHowever, there are caveats to that.\n\n31\n00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.430\nOnly certain browsers support all three.\n\n32\n00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.973\nFor example,\nInternet Explorer doesn't support .wav or\n\n33\n00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:55.670\n.ogg, and Safari doesn't support .ogg.\n\n34\n00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.690\nOkay, so you have to keep that in mind\nwhen you're inserting these files\n\n35\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.740\ninto your design.\n\n36\n00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.350\nThat you should probably cover the bases.\n\n37\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.430\nHave multiple versions of that\nparticular audio file available.\n\n38\n00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.580\nSo this way, those browsers will catch\nthe one that they need kind of thing.\n\n39\n00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.450\nSo, we'll talk about inserting an audio\nfile and we'll talk about inserting video.\n\n40\n00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.860\nSo, video is the same thing.\n\n41\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.340\nWe have an HTML 5 video tag or element\ntag that allows us to insert video.\n\n42\n00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.618\nAnd the three file types that\nare available for our video are MP4,\n\n43\n00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:33.255\nOGG, and WebM.\n\n44\n00:02:33.255 --> 00:02:36.325\nAnd again, there are couple\ncaveats here as well, okay.\n\n45\n00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:41.165\nNot every browser supports WebM or\nOgg and that would be Internet Explorer.\n\n46\n00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:45.485\nAnd for example, Safari doesn't\nsupport WebM or Ogg as well.\n\n47\n00:02:45.485 --> 00:02:47.765\nSo, we got to keep that in mind.\n\n48\n00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:50.365\nSo MP4, as it seems to be\na little bit more universal.\n\n49\n00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:53.025\nJust like MP3 seems to be\na little more universal, but\n\n50\n00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:58.286\nsome people like the lossless formats\nthat you can get with WAV, for example.\n\n51\n00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:00.370\nWAV is going to be a larger file type,\n\n52\n00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.400\nbecause it doesn't\ncompress the audio down.\n\n53\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.060\nSo, there's some drawbacks to those items.\n\n54\n00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.630\nBut we'll go with those file types,\nthe MP3 and the MP4, and\n\n55\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.700\nwe'll insert that into our design.\n\n56\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.120\nAnd we'll talk about some\nproperties surrounding that, so\n\n57\n00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.180\nat this point in time,\nI'd like to dive into our application.\n\n58\n00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.160\nAnd I'd like to show you where\nwe're going to put our first item,\n\n59\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.650\nour multimedia item.\n\n60\n00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.340\nSo, the first item we're going\nto use is going to be the audio.\n\n61\n00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.820\nAnd we're going to select the text\nwhere it says, content for\n\n62\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.280\nnew main tag goes here.\n\n63\n00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.300\nAnd we're going to remove that\ntext by hitting the delete key.\n\n64\n00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.380\nAgain, I've got to be careful not\nto have my live mode selected,\n\n65\n00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.300\notherwise it won't let me delete.\n\n66\n00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.380\nBut now that I've done that, with my\ncursor inside that box inside the main,\n\n67\n00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.180\nI can now insert the audio tag.\n\n68\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.920\nSo, if I go back up to my insert panel\nhere and I go further to the right.\n\n69\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.860\nI will see that I have\nan icon right there,\n\n70\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.948\nwhich is a movie clip, HTML 5 video.\n\n71\n00:03:56.948 --> 00:03:59.140\nIf I keep going there is a speaker icon,\nokay.\n\n72\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.960\nSo, the speaker icon lets me do audio.\n\n73\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.290\nNow, there is other items you can add.\n\n74\n00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.920\nYou can add animated compositions,\nyou can add a canvas.\n\n75\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.690\nWhich lets you do things like work with\nthe HTML 5 canvas and do some drawings.\n\n76\n00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.740\nThere's still flash that you can add,\nand you see it all the time.\n\n77\n00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.710\nBanners that do the dancing people trying\nto sell you real estate or whatever.\n\n78\n00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.770\nWe have flash video available and\nthen, you have some plug-ins and\n\n79\n00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:22.900\nother things you can work over.\n\n80\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.560\nSo, there's a rollover image as well.\n\n81\n00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.890\nRollover images basically change into\na different image when you hover over it,\n\n82\n00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.060\nand it reverts back when\nyou move off of it.\n\n83\n00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.340\nSo it's a good way to make, for example,\n\n84\n00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.460\nyour hyperlinks look like\nthey're animated in some way.\n\n85\n00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.749\nSo for now, we're going to choose this\nHTML5 audio and click on the link.\n\n86\n00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.490\nAnd when I do that, my properties panel\nnow changes down here to something new.\n\n87\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.260\nAnd I'd like to scroll down\nhere to see what's it's at it.\n\n88\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.140\nIt's literally added a little\nspeaker icon down here\n\n89\n00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.250\nto my graphics or to the main section.\n\n90\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.710\nSo basically, I have these audio\nproperties that I can work with.\n\n91\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.180\nAnd I can change what's going on with\nthis by changing the properties.\n\n92\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.190\nNow, the first thing I'd like\nto point your attention to is,\n\n93\n00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.720\nthe second portion of the properties\npane has some check-boxes.\n\n94\n00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.360\nSo right now,\nI have the check-box for controls.\n\n95\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.650\nBasically if I uncheck this, I won't see\ncontrols, if I check it I see controls.\n\n96\n00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.370\nI did choose a black background here,\nso I'm probably not seeing everything.\n\n97\n00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.500\nBut we'll take a look at\nthat here in a second.\n\n98\n00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.010\nI also have autoplay, so when you\nget to this page you can make it so\n\n99\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.140\nthe audio starts to play.\n\n100\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.040\nI don't know about US but when I go\nto some websites that automatically\n\n101\n00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.020\nstart playing music,\nthe first thing I do is turn it off.\n\n102\n00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.820\nOkay, so\n\n103\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.040\nif you do have a situation where you want\nto have automatically playing music.\n\n104\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.130\nYou need to make sure you have\nthe controls available so\n\n105\n00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.110\npeople can turn it off.\n\n106\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.210\nOtherwise you're going to get\nsome contact us forms filled out.\n\n107\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.000\nWhere people are really annoyed by you and\n\n108\n00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.620\nyour designers for creating a site that\nplays music that they don't like, okay.\n\n109\n00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.228\nSo, I'm not going to choose to auto-play.\n\n110\n00:05:55.228 --> 00:05:57.800\nI'm going to make it so\nwe have to click the play button.\n\n111\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.350\nWe also have the ability to\ncheck the box for looping.\n\n112\n00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.210\nSo once the piece is over,\nyou can make it loop and start over again.\n\n113\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.410\nOr you can even,\nthis kind of funny, mute it, right.\n\n114\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.810\nSo, you can play it but mute it at\nthe same time, which is kind of odd.\n\n115\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.870\nSo, it'll have it turned\noff during playback.\n\n116\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.710\nUsually, I have controls on.\n\n117\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.480\nI don't always have autoplay on.\n\n118\n00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.800\nI might have loop on, so\nonce it gets done it starts over again.\n\n119\n00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.310\nBut I definitely always have the controls\navailable for the person to choose.\n\n120\n00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.710\nNow preload, preload means that\nwhile the website is loading,\n\n121\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.620\nwhat it's going to do is,\nit's going to load it in the background.\n\n122\n00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.160\nSo even if they haven't hit play yet,\nwhen they do hit play, it will be ready.\n\n123\n00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.930\nThere won't be any delay or lag time.\n\n124\n00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.190\nThere won't be any problem.\n\n125\n00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.400\nIt'll just start playing right away,\nso it'll be loading behind the scenes.\n\n126\n00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.370\nAs they're reading your article or\n\n127\n00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.840\nthey're reading whatever they\nneed to read on your site.\n\n128\n00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.390\nOnce they get to hit the play button,\nit'll be ready to go.\n\n129\n00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.330\nAnd that will literally allow\nit to automatically preload\n\n130\n00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.850\nwhatever is going on.\n\n131\n00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.390\nBut what I like to do right now is,\nI like to point to the source.\n\n132\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.070\nSo I'm thinking that I don't\nhave my controls just yet,\n\n133\n00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.280\nbecause I really haven't\nspecified a source.\n\n134\n00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.660\nOkay, so\nI need an audio source in order to play.\n\n135\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.830\nWell in this source field right here,\nI'm going to go to and\n\n136\n00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.360\nclick on this point to file.\n\n137\n00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.970\nIt used to be funny, because in CS5 and\nCS6, we called this a spaghetti lasso.\n\n138\n00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.980\nAnd you're going to see why it's\ncalled spaghetti lasso in a minute.\n\n139\n00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.385\nBut, it looks like Dreamweaver has\nchanged the name to point to file,\n\n140\n00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:30.560\nbecause that's literally\nwhat I'm going to do.\n\n141\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.520\nI'm going to click on that and then,\nI'm going to point to the file I want.\n\n142\n00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.770\nNow before I do that, I'm actually\ngoing to expand some folders here, so\n\n143\n00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.050\nI can actually see the file I want to use.\n\n144\n00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.910\nAnd the file I'm going to use here is,\nthis EE_audio.mp3 file.\n\n145\n00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.690\nSo, I told you MP3 is one of those\nthat's universally accepted and\n\n146\n00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.420\nI'm going to insert that one in there.\n\n147\n00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.310\nSo what I'm going to do is,\n\n148\n00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:53.080\nI'm going to click Point to file and it\nsays right away, drag the file to choose.\n\n149\n00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.170\nSo, I'm going to drag it out\nto the EE_audio.mp3 file.\n\n150\n00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.390\nSo right here, when I let go, that becomes\nthe file it's going to use for the source.\n\n151\n00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.400\nSo at this time I have my source,\nI have my controls and again,\n\n152\n00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.550\nif somebody hovers over this,\nI want it to have a tip here.\n\n153\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.040\nSo in this case,\n\n154\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.420\nmaybe this is going to describe something\nabout an article they just read.\n\n155\n00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.080\nMaybe, it's going to provide information\non, I don't know, anything, but,\n\n156\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.738\nit could play the song that they\nwere looking for, anything.\n\n157\n00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:25.980\nYou want to describe that here,\nso that when they hover over it,\n\n158\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.560\nit will tell them what it's going to do.\n\n159\n00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.930\nSo we could say, listen to our latest news\n\n160\n00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.590\nand that will bring up that screen tip\nthat we talked about earlier, okay.\n\n161\n00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.970\nFall back text is an opportunity for\nif that one doesn't work for some reason.\n\n162\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.820\nIt'll have an opportunity to\nshow a separate line of text.\n\n163\n00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.840\nUsually the title is good enough where\nwe shouldn't have go any further.\n\n164\n00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.870\nSo at this point,\nI'd like to test this in my browser.\n\n165\n00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.110\nAnd so, I'm going to save my file\nwith a control s on the PC or\n\n166\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.000\na command s on the Mac.\n\n167\n00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.600\nAnd then, I'm going to go to\nmy browser settings here.\n\n168\n00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.020\nActually, I probably should just hit my\nF12 and bring me right into Google Chrome.\n\n169\n00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.120\nSo, I'm going to do F12 here and\nthere it is, there's Google Chrome and\n\n170\n00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.960\nhere's my controls.\n\n171\n00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.120\nYou can see right away.\n\n172\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.880\nI said content for new folder goes here,\n\n173\n00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.240\nis right below it but\nthis is my place, a 32 second file.\n\n174\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.740\nI can change the volume and\n\n175\n00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.840\nI can control where it's going to go\nin files, so if I hit the play here.\n\n176\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.130\nI should now hear the sound and\nmy scrub is moving across and\n\n177\n00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.970\nyou can hear little chimes or\nwhatever going on.\n\n178\n00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.290\nBut the point is,\nI've just added an MP3 audio that I have\n\n179\n00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.940\ncomplete control over within\nthe design of my web page.\n\n180\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.737\nAwesome, I'm going to\nclose out of Chrome and\n\n181\n00:09:39.737 --> 00:09:42.651\nI'm going to insert into the same space.\n\n182\n00:09:42.651 --> 00:09:45.009\nI'm going to insert a video file.\n\n183\n00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:49.091\nSo in my main content section,\nI'm working with an audio file and\n\n184\n00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:52.560\nI'm going to go insert a video file File.\n\n185\n00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.430\nSo, it's going to be a similar process.\n\n186\n00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:58.550\nI'm going to go back up\nto the insert panel and\n\n187\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.350\nto the right,\nI'm going to find the little movie script.\n\n188\n00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.350\nIt looks like a film reel and\nI'm going to click on that.\n\n189\n00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.310\nAnd where my cursor is,\n\n190\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:12.280\nyou see we've got another icon here and\nthis is now my video, okay.\n\n191\n00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.100\nAgain, I've got the same kind of controls\ndown here in the bottom section of my\n\n192\n00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.960\nproperties bar.\n\n193\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.750\nI've got the controls\nautomatically checked.\n\n194\n00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.470\nI've got auto-play, which in this case,\nI am actually going to auto-play.\n\n195\n00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.674\nI'm going to tell it to pre-load.\n\n196\n00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.050\nI'm not going to loop and\nI'm not going to mute.\n\n197\n00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.920\nKeep going here.\n\n198\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.690\nI could change the width and\nthe height of that source.\n\n199\n00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.350\nOnce I select the source, it's going\nto populate the width and the height.\n\n200\n00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.170\nBut if I want the box to be smaller or\nbigger,\n\n201\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.550\nI could change that information here.\n\n202\n00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.580\nNow, I have two options\nhere to choose from.\n\n203\n00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.430\nI have the source and\nI have a poster file.\n\n204\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.295\nI'm going to talk about\nwhat the differences are.\n\n205\n00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:52.810\nWe've already looked\nat the source earlier.\n\n206\n00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.440\nand I'm going to use\nthe spaghetti lasso or\n\n207\n00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.680\nthe point to file icon to point\nto that particular video.\n\n208\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.500\nNow the video I'm going to go to here is,\ngoing to be this MP4 video for\n\n209\n00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.040\nthe history of our company and\nI'm going to point to that.\n\n210\n00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.870\nSo, I'm going to click and drag to that\nHistory.MP4 video and there, that's done.\n\n211\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.470\nSo now I've got the source.\n\n212\n00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:19.760\nWell, what happens is, when you go to\na website and the file isn't running yet.\n\n213\n00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.348\nOkay, it should show a snapshot of\nwhat the file is going to look like.\n\n214\n00:11:24.348 --> 00:11:29.070\nMaybe either going to be the title\nof whatever the video is or\n\n215\n00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.940\njust something that's going to\nbring the interest of the person.\n\n216\n00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.140\nTo go click on it, maybe a funny\npoint within the video or something.\n\n217\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.000\nOkay, well that's what the poster file is.\n\n218\n00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.580\nThe poster is basically\na snapshot in time.\n\n219\n00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.820\nIt could be a JPEG file.\n\n220\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.590\nIt could be whatever you want, but\n\n221\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.350\nit's a snapshot in time\nthat represents the video.\n\n222\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.720\nSo what I'm going to do here is,\nI'm going to point to the history.\n\n223\n00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.630\nI believe it's in my\nimages folder here and\n\n224\n00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.280\nI should have the history\nvideo poster PNG file.\n\n225\n00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:01.700\nSo, I'm going to point to that and\nwhat's going to happen is,\n\n226\n00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.030\nit's going to put the poster in there and\nnow, you can see there's my video.\n\n227\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.350\nAnd when I choose to view\nthis with my F12 key, so\n\n228\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.808\nI'm going to hit F12\nat this point in time.\n\n229\n00:12:09.808 --> 00:12:11.480\nIt's going to ask me to save.\n\n230\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.070\nI didn't do the Ctrl + S or\nthe Cmd + S, so it's asking me to save.\n\n231\n00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.150\nAlways a fail safe within\nthese applications, so\n\n232\n00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.960\nI click yes and now,\nit's going to go out and here it is.\n\n233\n00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.210\nIt automatically started playing and\nthere's the history of our company.\n\n234\n00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.070\nNow luckily,\nmy music over here is not playing.\n\n235\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.320\nTherefore, there's no\nconflict between the two.\n\n236\n00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.610\nI didn't tell this to loop, so\nwhen it's done, it'll just finish and\n\n237\n00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.120\nwe'll be done, okay.\n\n238\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.910\nNow in this example,\n\n239\n00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.490\nbecause I told it to autoplay I\ndidn't necessarily need the poster.\n\n240\n00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.070\nSo what I'm thinking is,\nI'm going to go back out of Chrome.\n\n241\n00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:47.700\nI'm going to tell it not to autoplay\nnd I'm going to go back and view this.\n\n242\n00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:53.470\nI'm going to do my F12 key again, save\nthe file and now, it's not auto-playing.\n\n243\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.310\nbut you can see a snapshot\nof the video and\n\n244\n00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.040\nI can choose to play it whenever I want,\nokay.\n\n245\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:05.220\nSo we can add audio, mp3,\nogg or wav files and\n\n246\n00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:11.010\nwe can add video, MP4,\nWebM, or aug files as well.\n\n247\n00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.150\nAnd those will be available for\nyour browsers to detect and to work with.\n\n248\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.050\nAnd the last thing I'd like to do is,\n\n249\n00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.200\nI'd like to take a look at\nthe code that it wrote.\n\n250\n00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.790\nSo I'm going to close out of Chrome and\nI want to go back into the code again.\n\n251\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:30.310\nif you ever want to learn HTML,\nlet Dreamweaver write the code for\n\n252\n00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.600\nyou and then, just go in and\nsee what it did.\n\n253\n00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.760\nSo for example, on 37 through 39,\n\n254\n00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.483\nI have my audio element, so\nhere’s the beginning audio.\n\n255\n00:13:40.483 --> 00:13:44.545\nI have pre-load auto and\nI have the controls turned on, so\n\n256\n00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:45.695\nthese were those check boxes.\n\n257\n00:13:45.695 --> 00:13:49.935\nSo, those are attributes within the audio\nelement and then, I have the source.\n\n258\n00:13:49.935 --> 00:13:53.975\nSo, specified the source of the file\nright on this line right here.\n\n259\n00:13:53.975 --> 00:13:55.719\nThen I have my closing tag for audio.\n\n260\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.690\nNext, I have the video sources.\n\n261\n00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.740\nWell, so video HTML5 video element.\n\n262\n00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.010\nNow in this case,\nbecause video requires a certain size,\n\n263\n00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.268\nit requires a dimension to it.\n\n264\n00:14:06.268 --> 00:14:08.813\nYou've got to have somewhere to view it,\nokay.\n\n265\n00:14:08.813 --> 00:14:10.546\nIt's specified a width and a height.\n\n266\n00:14:10.546 --> 00:14:13.190\nI showed where the poster was located.\n\n267\n00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.040\nI told it to pre-upload.\n\n268\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.060\nThis way, it would load in the background\nI was doing, wherever I wanted to do and\n\n269\n00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.100\nI told it to turn on the controls.\n\n270\n00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.490\nSo, those are available inside\nthe attributes of that element.\n\n271\n00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.770\nThen, I have here that the source for\n\n272\n00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:32.170\nthis one is MP4 and notice, I also have\nthat the source is the video aug file.\n\n273\n00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.860\nRemember, how I said\ncompatibility is important and\n\n274\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.990\nI said both of those files right here and\nit brought them both in.\n\n275\n00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.380\nSo, it detected that I had the Aug and\nthe mp4 and brought it in for me, okay.\n\n276\n00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:49.240\nSo at this point in time, I have both, so\nwhichever browser comes to my website.\n\n277\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.320\nIt'll find the one that works best\nwith that particular browser so\n\n278\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.680\nit's not a big deal.\n\n279\n00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:59.850\nAnd then lastly, I have my closing\nvideo tag for that multimedia file.\n\n280\n00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.190\nSo in one fell swoop,\n\n281\n00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:06.370\njust click in the insert panel at the top,\nspecify whether I want HTML video.\n\n282\n00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:11.500\nSpecify whether I want HTML audio.\n\n283\n00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.030\nfind the source file that you\nwant to point to and then,\n\n284\n00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.270\nchange the property settings.\n\n285\n00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.730\nTurn on controls, looping, auto play,\n\n286\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:25.300\nwhatever you want and then, you've got\naccess to multimedia on your website.\n\n287\n00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.110\n>> Jim, we do appreciate that information.\n\n288\n00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.330\nThe one thing I was thinking while you\nwere showing us that little screenshot\n\n289\n00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.910\nthere, as I know it has\ngone to news sites before.\n\n290\n00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.610\nThey've got whatever the breaking story\nis or maybe, it's not a breaking story.\n\n291\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.130\nMaybe it's like a a documentary or\nsomething.\n\n292\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.170\nAnd they take that one shot that kind\nof brings you in and makes you say,\n\n293\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.240\nI got to click on that.\n\n294\n00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.530\nOr if it's a marketing site or\nselling you something.\n\n295\n00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.630\nThey want to show you\na feature of their product and\n\n296\n00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.480\nthey pu that still shot right there\nthat says, I've got to have that.\n\n297\n00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.098\nAnd if I don't have that my life\nis going be a lot worse off,\n\n298\n00:15:55.098 --> 00:15:56.870\nso we do appreciate this information.\n\n299\n00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.210\nBut before we sign off,\ndo you have any additional information?\n\n300\n00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:06.080\n>> Yeah I'd just like to say that again,\nkeep mind that audio,\n\n301\n00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.020\nnot everybody is going to like it\nto auto-play, so keep that in mind.\n\n302\n00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.640\nDon't make it auto-play unless you\nabsolutely have to for whatever reason.\n\n303\n00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.800\nBut always make sure\nthe controls are available, so\n\n304\n00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.550\nthe person feels like they have control to\nchange and make it do whatever they want.\n\n305\n00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.190\nAs a matter of fact,\nI remember doing video classes.\n\n306\n00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.780\nThey say that your video could\nbe really really Bad, but\n\n307\n00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.760\nas long as long as the audio is good,\nit doesn't matter, okay.\n\n308\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.080\nSo, think of the Blair Witch Project,\nright.?\n\n309\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.845\nVideo was bad but the audio was good,\nso everybody still watched it.\n\n310\n00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:43.590\nSo, don't auto-play the audio on your\nwebsites, that's going to be key.\n\n311\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.160\nAnd then with the video,\njust keep in mind,\n\n312\n00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.890\nyou want to be as compatible with\nas many browsers as possible.\n\n313\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.610\nYou make sure you have multiple\nversions of your file.\n\n314\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.520\nSo that way,\nwhichever browser comes to your site,\n\n315\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.940\nthey'll be able to see that video and\nthat will be important.\n\n316\n00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.720\n>> Well we do thank you for\nthat information and\n\n317\n00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.090\nwe do thank you the viewer out there for\nwatching.\n\n318\n00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.046\nSigning out for\nITProTV I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n319\n00:17:03.046 --> 00:17:03.990\n>> And I'm Jim Surrels.\n\n320\n00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.386\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n321\n00:17:06.386 --> 00:17:13.868\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.430\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.080\nin today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our series on Dreamweaver.\n\n5\n00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.560\nThat's right, we're coming back\nwith more Creative Cloud 2015 and\n\n6\n00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.360\ntoday we're going to be looking at\nworking with templates and tables.\n\n7\n00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.040\nJoining me in the studios again is\nnone other than Mr. Jim Searles.\n\n8\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.030\nJim, how you doing sir?\n\n9\n00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.880\n>> I'm doing great Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.860\nThank you for having me back and\nthank you to the IT Pro TV team for\n\n11\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.530\nhaving me as well so I can continue\nmy conversation about Dreamweaver.\n\n12\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.650\nAnd specifically today,\nlike you said, templates and tables.\n\n13\n00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.380\nAnd when we talk about templates\nwe talk about reusable content.\n\n14\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.590\nReuseable content is content that allows\nus to not have to reinvent the wheel,\n\n15\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.230\nand that's a really important piece.\n\n16\n00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.170\nSo we're gonna be talking a little\nbit about the inserts panel, and\n\n17\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.050\nthe fact that we have categories\nacross the top of the insert panel.\n\n18\n00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.250\nWe've only looked at HTML categories so\nfar, and\n\n19\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.690\nwe're gonna be jumping around on\nthe different categories today.\n\n20\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.270\nAnd so I'd like to draw our attention\nto our application to start and\n\n21\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.050\nup here at the top,\nI have my insert panel and\n\n22\n00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.260\nI want to draw your attention to\nthis one tab called templates.\n\n23\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.690\nAnd there aren't many icons on this tab,\n\n24\n00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.330\nbut it does provide us what we need to do\nto create a template out of our design.\n\n25\n00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.850\nNow we're gonna finish our design here in\na little bit to make sure that we have all\n\n26\n00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.770\nthe pieces that we need.\n\n27\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.540\nAnd we'll talk about that\ncontent we're gonna add, but\n\n28\n00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.760\nthe first icon right here on\nthe left is make template.\n\n29\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.990\nThat's the one we're going to click on\neventually so that way we can develop\n\n30\n00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.680\nthe template that we're gonna use to\ncreate our About us page, Our Company News\n\n31\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.190\npage, our Careers page and Contact Us\npage, so that will be used for that.\n\n32\n00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.680\nThen we have the next item which\nis make a Nested Template,\n\n33\n00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.400\nthis is basically where you can\ncreate a template within a template.\n\n34\n00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.280\nSo basically, an editable section\nwithin a new template but\n\n35\n00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.670\nthat's already inside of a template.\n\n36\n00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.810\nThe next icon is to do an editable region.\n\n37\n00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.350\nYou, when you create a template, it's\na good idea to create an editable region,\n\n38\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.500\notherwise people are going to always have\nthe static information across one page\n\n39\n00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.070\nto the other.\n\n40\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.010\nSo it will be important to do that.\n\n41\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.320\nWithout an editable region,\n\n42\n00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.050\nnobody will be able to edit the page\nitself, the next icon is optional region.\n\n43\n00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.570\nThis is a region in which,\n\n44\n00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.669\nbased on a condition, Ewell will not show\nthat region available in that template.\n\n45\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.140\nThe next icon is for a repeating region.\n\n46\n00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.040\nVery useful.\n\n47\n00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.260\nAnd think of it this way, when you go to\nAmazon.com and you type in a search for\n\n48\n00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.665\nHarry Potter, you get hundreds, if not\nthousands of items as a return result.\n\n49\n00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:42.225\nWell, the web designer\ndidn't create hundreds or\n\n50\n00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:44.565\nthousands of rows to\nshow you the information.\n\n51\n00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:48.905\nThey created one, and then they generated\na repeating region on that table.\n\n52\n00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:52.155\nAnd so it repeated for\nevery return of that search that you did,\n\n53\n00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:56.045\nthe next icon is for\neditable optional region.\n\n54\n00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:59.580\nAgain, it allows you to edit this region,\nbut it's optional.\n\n55\n00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.170\nIf the condition is that there's\ninformation to show, it'll show it.\n\n56\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.680\nIf there isn't a condition to show,\nit won't show it.\n\n57\n00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.810\nThat's why it's optional; and\nthen the last one is a repeating table.\n\n58\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.740\nSo that's a similar to the repeating\nregion and you utilize that to\n\n59\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.840\nbe able to show information that's\ngonna repeat over and over again.\n\n60\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.610\nBut before we create the template, I'd\nlike to go into our original design, and\n\n61\n00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.760\nI'd like to change some things\nthat we're working on, and\n\n62\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.820\nmake sure that it's going to\nprovide us with what we want.\n\n63\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.620\nTo do that, I'd like to show us, or\n\n64\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.530\nat least take a look at how\nthe design currently stands.\n\n65\n00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.360\nSo, I'm gonna do my F12 on the keyboard,\nif you remember from a previous episode,\n\n66\n00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.430\nF12 allows us to see and preview the work\nthat we've done so far on a browser.\n\n67\n00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.520\nAnd one thing that I'd like to work on, or\nfix right now before I do this region, or\n\n68\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.670\nadd a template is to make it,\n\n69\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.350\nso that way it always be centered to\nthe page, right now it is not centered, so\n\n70\n00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.430\nyou can see it's left aligned, and we're\ngoing to fix that using some CSS styling.\n\n71\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.010\nSo I'm going to close out of my browser\nhere, and the first thing I'd like to do\n\n72\n00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.630\nis go down to my tag selector and\nmake sure I've got my wrapper selected.\n\n73\n00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.490\nNow, there's a trick that we\nuse in our web design where\n\n74\n00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.130\nwe can assign a margin around the content.\n\n75\n00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.130\nNow, if we talked about Css stylings, and\nwe talked about margins being outside\n\n76\n00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.630\nthe box I can assign an automatic\nvalue outside the box, and\n\n77\n00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.530\nwhen I define a width for that box,\nit would then say okay, always maintain\n\n78\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.790\nthe automatic width left and right and\nthat will keep you centered to the page.\n\n79\n00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.600\nSo let me show you how we're gonna\ndo that I'm gonna expand out my\n\n80\n00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.790\nproperties panel in here so I can see,\nor my CSS designer panel, so\n\n81\n00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.650\nI can see both the properties and\neverything going on.\n\n82\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.310\nAnd with my wrapper selected, I'm going to\ngenerate a new selector, it's gonna give\n\n83\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.410\nme the wrapper selector here, I'm gonna\nhit enter, and now I have my properties.\n\n84\n00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.130\nThe first thing I wanna do is\ndefine the width of the page.\n\n85\n00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.590\nNow for those of you who've watched\nour images session, we inserted\n\n86\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.680\nan image here at the top in the banner and\nthat was one thousand thirty three pixels.\n\n87\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.680\nSo what I'm gonna do is make sure that\nat least my width here is at least one\n\n88\n00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.540\nthousand thirty three.\n\n89\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.890\nI'll make it about one thousand\nfifty pixels just so it matches.\n\n90\n00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.910\nSo one thousand fifty and\nthen I'm gonna hit enter.\n\n91\n00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.960\nThe next thing I'm going to do is I'm\ngonna go down to the margin setting here\n\n92\n00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.010\nand I'm gonna set the margins to auto.\n\n93\n00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.250\nAnd what that'll allow us to do is\nit'll allow us to adjust left and\n\n94\n00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.680\nright from center.\n\n95\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.910\nSo I do an auto setting here and\nI hit enter.\n\n96\n00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.640\nIt automatically makes all of\nthese items automatically adjust.\n\n97\n00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.460\nSo what that did now, is if I take a look\nat my design, and I save my file, you'll\n\n98\n00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.635\nsee now, everything is in the center, and\nas I move the page it all moves together.\n\n99\n00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:41.565\nNow there are some other items that\nare off, my navigation is off.\n\n100\n00:05:41.565 --> 00:05:45.375\nI'm actually going to remove this content\nhere for the purpose of our template, cuz\n\n101\n00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:48.285\nyou don't wanna have any content in there\nalready when you create the template.\n\n102\n00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:50.995\nOtherwise every single page you generate\nis gonna have that same content.\n\n103\n00:05:50.995 --> 00:05:53.675\nAnd then lastly we're gonna\nwork on the footer and again,\n\n104\n00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:55.780\nwe're gonna make sure that\nfooter is centered as well.\n\n105\n00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.850\nAnd there's a trick that we can use,\nagain, within the design of css.\n\n106\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.170\nIs, for example,\nif I wanted to make this content centered,\n\n107\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.170\nwhat I would do is click\ninside this section.\n\n108\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.750\nI would select the tag for\nthat section and,\n\n109\n00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.125\nin this case,\nI'm gonna create the main selector here.\n\n110\n00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:15.845\nOkay, so here's my wrapper main,\nhit Enter.\n\n111\n00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:19.305\nAnd I'm gonna use text alignment,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n112\n00:06:19.305 --> 00:06:22.965\nIt treats content inside\nof a section like text.\n\n113\n00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:27.210\nSo if I do text-align center here\nInstantly it centered the content to\n\n114\n00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.960\nthe page.\n\n115\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.370\nSo It's pretty interesting how that works,\n\n116\n00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.850\nyou wouldn't think that it's actually text\nand that would affect it but it does.\n\n117\n00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.490\nAnd it is now centered\njust like everything else.\n\n118\n00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.290\nIt's gonna be perfectly\ncentered to the page.\n\n119\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.420\nSo If i scroll up and\ndown, it works like that.\n\n120\n00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.100\n>> And that's interesting Jim.\n\n121\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.680\nThat worked just like any\nmodern word processor worked.\n\n122\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.660\nIt was just left aligned,\ncenter aligned, right aligned right?\n\n123\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.850\n>> That's absolutely correct,\nthat's absolutely correct Wes.\n\n124\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.760\nAnd that makes sense to apply it to\nsomething you might already know.\n\n125\n00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.474\nSo we are gonna do some text-align-center,\ntext-align-right,\n\n126\n00:06:57.474 --> 00:06:59.390\ntext-align-left, just like in Word.\n\n127\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.620\nFantastic.\n\n128\n00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.170\nOkay, the next item I'd like to center\nis going to be my unordered list here.\n\n129\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.620\nThis we have already created,\na selector for that,\n\n130\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.900\nand it's already in our list here in\nthe selector script, so wrapper/nav/ul.\n\n131\n00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.080\nIf I click on that I'll be able to\ngo into the text group again, and\n\n132\n00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.550\nnotice it's left aligned, so\nI'm gonna change that to center align, and\n\n133\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.640\nthe entire list now centers.\n\n134\n00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.880\nSo, at this point,\nI have my banner centered to the page,\n\n135\n00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.080\nI have my navigation centered, and\nI also have my content in the main.\n\n136\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.849\nNow we're going to add some content down\nhere, and we're gonna talk more about\n\n137\n00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:40.332\nthis footer in a little bit, but\nI'm just gonna add some content for text,\n\n138\n00:07:40.332 --> 00:07:45.172\nand I'm gonna put what I would normally\ndown in the footer just for this example,\n\n139\n00:07:45.172 --> 00:07:49.760\nit's gonna be my copyright statement and\nI'm gonna do my year, 2016.\n\n140\n00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.723\nAnd I want to put jymbo.com here,\njust because you got to put your name.\n\n141\n00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.621\nWe're gonna talk more about\nwhat I am doing here,\n\n142\n00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:59.037\na little bit later on in another episode.\n\n143\n00:07:59.037 --> 00:08:03.127\nAll rights reserved, this is important\nto protect your rights on the Internet.\n\n144\n00:08:03.127 --> 00:08:06.666\nAnd the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\nstates that if you have this information\n\n145\n00:08:06.666 --> 00:08:11.430\non every page that you create, the content\nbecomes published, and you are protected.\n\n146\n00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.540\nReserved is the last word I needed here.\n\n147\n00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.840\nThere we go, okay, and again,\nI want this content to be centered.\n\n148\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.510\nNow I do not have any selector yet for\nmy footer, so I'm going to come over here,\n\n149\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.100\nmake sure I've got the footer selected,\nadd the selector,\n\n150\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.380\nthere's my wrapper footer, hit enter, and\nthen I'm gonna do text align center, and\n\n151\n00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.260\nas you would expect that works\nexactly like we thought.\n\n152\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.050\nOkay, so\nnow that I've got that built so far.\n\n153\n00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.130\nThe next change I'd like to do is I said\nI'm going to remove these two pieces of\n\n154\n00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.550\ncontent because that's where our\neditable region is gonna go in.\n\n155\n00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.570\nSo that way each page that we\ncreate based on this template\n\n156\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.730\nit's now going to be able to\nput it right in the center.\n\n157\n00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.600\nSo let me save my work as it is now.\n\n158\n00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.960\nAnd then I'm gonna select this video,\nand hit the delete key.\n\n159\n00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.880\nSelect audio and hit the delete key.\n\n160\n00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.990\nSo, right now the main\nsection is nothing in it.\n\n161\n00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.290\nOkay, now there’s one more thing I\nwould like to do and in doing so\n\n162\n00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:11.489\nI’m going to be teaching you about what’s\nknown as a rollover, an image rollover.\n\n163\n00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.140\nWe did talk about\nhyperlinking our nav bar and\n\n164\n00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.820\nyou can see the home\ntext here is hyperlinked.\n\n165\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.020\nBut I'd like to remove that and\n\n166\n00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.350\ninstead of having text in there\nI'd like to have a graphic.\n\n167\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.260\nAnd what I'd like to have is when you\nhover over that graphic I'd like it to\n\n168\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.240\nchange and give a visual\nrepresentation of change in some way.\n\n169\n00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.990\nSo I'm going to select the text home.\n\n170\n00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.620\nRight here I'm gonna\nbackspace to delete it,\n\n171\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.170\nand then I'm going to go in and\ninsert an image.\n\n172\n00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.480\nBut I'm not just gonna insert any image,\n\n173\n00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.440\nI'm going to go to my HTML\ncategory on my insert panel.\n\n174\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.730\nAnd then I'm gonna go all the way\nto the right and you're gonna see\n\n175\n00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.900\nnext to the puzzle piece here,\nthe plug-in, a rollover image option.\n\n176\n00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.340\nNow this is not only going to\ninsert the image that I want.\n\n177\n00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.830\nOr the two sets of images, one that shows\nwhat it looks like when it's gonna be\n\n178\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.090\nsitting there and one that it's\ngonna show when you hover over it.\n\n179\n00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:07.990\nBut this will also add some\nJavaScript to your web page.\n\n180\n00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.350\nSo we're gonna see JavaScript for\n\n181\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.700\nthe first time because it's gonna\ntest to see where my cursor's at.\n\n182\n00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.380\nAnd if that cursor goes over that spot\n\n183\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.030\nit's gonna trigger that JavaScript to\nsay okay, there was a mouse over here.\n\n184\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.000\nYou need to change the image\nbased on this mouse over.\n\n185\n00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.790\nLuckily you don't have know any code.\n\n186\n00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.930\nYou just have to fill in\nsome fields on a form.\n\n187\n00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.600\nSo the image name,\nI'm gonna call this home.\n\n188\n00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:30.940\nThe original image,\n\n189\n00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.910\nyou need to find the original image where\nit might be located and as you can see,\n\n190\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.060\nI've got all of my buttons here\nthat I'm gonna be working with.\n\n191\n00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.270\nAnd I did call the image that's just\ngonna be sitting there, I called it home.\n\n192\n00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.090\nBut the image I'm going to be\nhovering over I'm gonna call it down,\n\n193\n00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:49.600\nbecause I've added a shadow effect, an\ninner shadow effect in this in Photoshop\n\n194\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.820\nthat allows it to look like\nit's being pressed down.\n\n195\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.960\nSo for this image,\nI want just the home png file, and\n\n196\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.220\nthen for the rollover image,\nI'm gonna choose the homedown.png file.\n\n197\n00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.260\nNow it says, preload the rollover image.\n\n198\n00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.950\nWe talked about preload in a previous\nepisode when we talked about\n\n199\n00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:08.940\naudio and video.\n\n200\n00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.910\nPreload just means even though you\nhaven't done it yet, load it so\n\n201\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.480\nthat way it doesn't give a delay,\nalternate text.\n\n202\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.500\nWhenever you add an image, one of\nthe first things you should always do\n\n203\n00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.580\nis add alternate text to meet\nyour 508c compliance, and\n\n204\n00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.720\nto make sure that screen readers\ncan read out what's going on here.\n\n205\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.622\nSo, again, this is my return to home,\n\n206\n00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:32.610\npage, button, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.890\nAnd then you specify what is going\nto trigger when this is done.\n\n208\n00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.210\nNow, for this one, I could instantly\npoint it to the index study\n\n209\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.220\nhtml file because that's what\nI would like it to load.\n\n210\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.150\nSo I could browse out to that,\nand find index.html and click OK.\n\n211\n00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.990\nNow when I get to the others,\nI haven't created those pages yet.\n\n212\n00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.290\nI'm gonna create the once\nthe template is done.\n\n213\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.060\nSo what I'd like to show you is how to\nedit a template once it's been created so\n\n214\n00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.210\nyou can add those in, and\nthat's the beauty of a template.\n\n215\n00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.580\nI won't have to go back to each\npage that are created based on it.\n\n216\n00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.140\nIt will automatically update.\n\n217\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.550\nSo I'm gonna click OK here, and\nthere's our first button rollover.\n\n218\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.030\nAnd if I wanna test that, again,\nI go into F12, and I say yes.\n\n219\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.480\nAnd what you're gonna see is,\nI hover over that and\n\n220\n00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.250\ninstantly, it looks like\nsomething's happening there.\n\n221\n00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.660\nA drop shadow comes in, it looks like\nI'm pushing down on that button.\n\n222\n00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.970\nOkay, so that is working fine, and I'll\ndo that for the rest of these other guys.\n\n223\n00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.160\nAgain, just walking through this\nprocess of selecting the text.\n\n224\n00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.560\nDeleting it and I'm just gonna\ndo two of them for now just so\n\n225\n00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.610\nwe can see what it looks like.\n\n226\n00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.945\nWe're gonna put about us here and\n\n227\n00:12:37.945 --> 00:12:43.585\nthen the original image, and\nthen the rollover image.\n\n228\n00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:49.221\n[NOISE] Alternate text is going\n\n229\n00:12:49.221 --> 00:12:54.181\nto be go to about us page and\n\n230\n00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:59.146\nlearn about our company.\n\n231\n00:12:59.146 --> 00:13:01.809\n>> Now Jim in the last, or\nin one of the previous episodes,\n\n232\n00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:05.212\nis this the same alt text that you\nsaid is required by certain government\n\n233\n00:13:05.212 --> 00:13:08.557\nbodies you're required, and\nyou might want to save yourself a little\n\n234\n00:13:08.557 --> 00:13:11.330\nbit of civil litigation on\nthis by putting this in here?\n\n235\n00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.070\n>> That's absolutely correct.\n\n236\n00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.230\nThis is for accessibility purposes,\nthe 508 C standards compliance, and\n\n237\n00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:21.870\nyou want to make sure any image that you\nadd that is gonna be part of your content.\n\n238\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.000\nIt needs to be accessible to\na screen readers and such.\n\n239\n00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.440\nVery good question.\n\n240\n00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.780\nOkay.\nSo, I've added two buttons here and\n\n241\n00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.250\nI might want to add some visual\nseparation between these items,\n\n242\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.980\nbecause it looks like\njust one large button.\n\n243\n00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:40.650\nHowever, if I preview this in\nmy design view, it's fine.\n\n244\n00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.930\nSo at this point,\nI've got it, it's really.\n\n245\n00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.270\nYou might even want to get rid of\nthat little border at this point, but\n\n246\n00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.380\nright now this is exactly what I want.\n\n247\n00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.300\nOk, so at this point I think I'm\nready to create the template.\n\n248\n00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.130\nBecause remember I can edit the template\nat any time and make these changes or\n\n249\n00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.590\nmake changes to it, so fantastic.\n\n250\n00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.640\nSo, how do I do that?\n\n251\n00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.490\nWhat I do is,\n\n252\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.920\nI go back up to the Categories up here in\nthe upper left where it says, Templates.\n\n253\n00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.040\nAnd I'm going to click on this left\nmost icon called, Make Template.\n\n254\n00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.040\nNow my original file was called, Index.\n\n255\n00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.450\nSo it says, save this as the Index file.\n\n256\n00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.100\nBut that's not really what I want, right?\n\n257\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.330\nSo I do want it in the sample site and\nI don't want this to be the index.\n\n258\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.810\nI want this to be my template for my site.\n\n259\n00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.520\nSo we're gonna give it a different name.\n\n260\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.760\nThe index file is,\nI wanna keep it the way it is and\n\n261\n00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.130\nmaybe apply the template to that,\nbut I want this to be my template.\n\n262\n00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.200\nI can give this a description.\n\n263\n00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.360\nI can say MySiteTemplate or\nsomething like that.\n\n264\n00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.000\nSo you wanna be able to just do that.\n\n265\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.070\nNow I'm gonna click Save.\n\n266\n00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.680\nAnd it says, Update the links?\n\n267\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.060\nI'm gonna say, yes.\n\n268\n00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:46.550\nOkay, so what it's done now is it's\nno longer inside the index.html file,\n\n269\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.960\nit's in the MyTemplate.dwt.\n\n270\n00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.640\nDWT stands for\ndream weaver template, okay?\n\n271\n00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.290\nSo basically when I look at the code,\nwhat you're gonna see is\n\n272\n00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:02.400\ninside the code I have template code here.\n\n273\n00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.700\nIt says hey,\nthis is a template and this is now\n\n274\n00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.910\ninformation where that template is going\nto reside, and so the code otherwise on\n\n275\n00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.640\nthat is pretty much untouched except for\nthe JavaScript that was added.\n\n276\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.680\nSo you can see, from line 35, here,\n\n277\n00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.840\nthat's the JavaScript that was added\nbased on our rollover image, okay?\n\n278\n00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.770\nAnd it goes down to line 57.\n\n279\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.420\nAgain, if you're wanting to learn how\nto write code, it's probably a good\n\n280\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.310\nidea to make a change in your design and\ngo take a look at what Dreamweaver's done,\n\n281\n00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.910\nbecause that'll give you a good\ninsight as to what's going Going on.\n\n282\n00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:38.520\nSo everything looks good there and\nthe next piece I need to do is,\n\n283\n00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.150\nI need to make sure that I\nhave an editable region.\n\n284\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:45.410\nWithout an editable region I won't\nbe able to add any new content.\n\n285\n00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.540\nSo I wanna make sure I'm inside the main,\nwhich I just did,\n\n286\n00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.210\nI clicked in my design, right there, so\n\n287\n00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.080\nmain is the tag here and that's where\nI want the editable region, then go.\n\n288\n00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.153\nSo go back up to my templates in\nthe insert panel and I look for\n\n289\n00:15:58.153 --> 00:15:59.464\neditable region.\n\n290\n00:15:59.464 --> 00:16:02.916\nSo I'm gonna insert that right there and\nit says what would I like for this name.\n\n291\n00:16:02.916 --> 00:16:07.566\nSince I am in the main content of the\nsection here I'm gonna call it Main and\n\n292\n00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:09.225\nthen I'm gonna click OK.\n\n293\n00:16:09.225 --> 00:16:13.060\nSo now what it's done is it's literally\nplaced this little icon right here,\n\n294\n00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.780\nwhich tells me that's where\nI can add any new content.\n\n295\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.250\nSo if I wanted to put those videos and\n\n296\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:21.390\nthat audio back in there, what I would do\nis, I would go right into that spot and\n\n297\n00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:24.820\nI would insert my audio or\ninsert my video into that spot.\n\n298\n00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.660\nI'll be able to edit inside of there,\nbut I will not be able to edit\n\n299\n00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.880\nanything else once I apply this\ntemplate to those other files.\n\n300\n00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.123\nSo at this point I'm gonna save.\n\n301\n00:16:33.123 --> 00:16:39.000\nAll right,\nnow I want to create the about us page.\n\n302\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.020\nI wanna create careers, my company news,\neverything based on this template.\n\n303\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.212\nSo to do that I go up to File and\nI choose New.\n\n304\n00:16:46.212 --> 00:16:50.574\nOkay, so what I have now is\nthe same dialogue box we've seen\n\n305\n00:16:50.574 --> 00:16:55.560\nbefore where I can choose all of\nthese items that were always there.\n\n306\n00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.660\nBut I can go up to Site Templates, and\nthere's my template that I've created, and\n\n307\n00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.140\nit even gives you a snapshot.\n\n308\n00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:05.119\nSo this tells me right away I can create\nany page that I want based on this style,\n\n309\n00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.485\nthis design, okay.\n\n310\n00:17:06.485 --> 00:17:09.360\nSo now I've got an Untitled-1 document.\n\n311\n00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.837\nI'm gonna save this as, and\nI'm gonna call it about,\n\n312\n00:17:14.837 --> 00:17:17.943\nthis is our about page, okay.\n\n313\n00:17:17.943 --> 00:17:21.925\nAll right, so at this point,\nI have an index, I have an about,\n\n314\n00:17:21.925 --> 00:17:25.570\nnow the index is not\nassociated with this template.\n\n315\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:27.250\nBut the about is.\n\n316\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.460\nNow, let me show you the code.\n\n317\n00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.265\nLook at this, I'm in design view but\nnotice, I have the Ghostbuster symbol,\n\n318\n00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:35.875\nthe cannot do anything symbol, right?\n\n319\n00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:40.785\nAnd that's because none of this\nis editable outside of this page.\n\n320\n00:17:40.785 --> 00:17:43.525\nThe only place I can go in and\nedit is in the main section,\n\n321\n00:17:43.525 --> 00:17:45.282\nand that the point of a template.\n\n322\n00:17:45.282 --> 00:17:50.632\nThe template lets you, the developer,\ncontrol what might go into the pages.\n\n323\n00:17:50.632 --> 00:17:54.882\nNow here's the thing, somebody might be\nthe one developing and designing the page,\n\n324\n00:17:54.882 --> 00:17:57.350\nbut somebody else might be\nadding the content to it.\n\n325\n00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.380\nSo this way you have some\nsemblance of control over that.\n\n326\n00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.104\nAgain, I can go in at any time and\nI can fix these pages or this template so\n\n327\n00:18:04.104 --> 00:18:07.010\nthat way it points to\nthe appropriate information.\n\n328\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:10.370\nAnd remember, the about us was one\nof those that needed to be fixed.\n\n329\n00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.550\nI hadn't yet created the about us page,\nso I'd like to associate that button.\n\n330\n00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.770\nFor example, I preview my about page.\n\n331\n00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.330\nOkay, here's the preview\nof the about page.\n\n332\n00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.940\nIt says the word Main here.\n\n333\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.870\nAnd this doesn't go anywhere yet.\n\n334\n00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.180\nIf I hover over it,\nit doesn't go anywhere just yet.\n\n335\n00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.220\nIf I click it, it does nothing, okay?\n\n336\n00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.540\nWhereas if I click Home,\nit takes me to the Home page.\n\n337\n00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.192\nPage, the index.\nAnd\n\n338\n00:18:31.192 --> 00:18:34.070\nnow it says index right here in the URL,\nall right?\n\n339\n00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.330\nSo this doesn't go anywhere.\n\n340\n00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.350\nIf I click on it,\nit just puts a hashtag which says,\n\n341\n00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.930\nI don't know the reference yet.\n\n342\n00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.065\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go back into my template.\n\n343\n00:18:43.065 --> 00:18:45.990\nI'm gonna close out of this,\ngo into my template.\n\n344\n00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.820\nI'm going to click on this About Us, here.\n\n345\n00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.290\nAnd we're gonna add that page to it.\n\n346\n00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:55.610\nSo right here in the Properties panel,\nI'm gonna remove that hashtag, and\n\n347\n00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.010\npoint to the about us file.\n\n348\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.390\nSo, I'm gonna bring up my Files panel,\n\n349\n00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.520\npoint to about us inside my list,\nif I can find it.\n\n350\n00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.590\nI'm not seeing it here,\nprobably clicking the wrong folder.\n\n351\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.726\nThere it is, about.\nI'm gonna do my spaghetti lasso to about,\n\n352\n00:19:10.726 --> 00:19:15.520\nand when I release,\nnow it's got that reference to about.\n\n353\n00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.390\nI can save the template.\n\n354\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.510\nAnd when I save the template,\nit's gonna do something interesting.\n\n355\n00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.680\nAny pages that are associated with this\ntemplate now are going to say hey,\n\n356\n00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.200\nyou've updated the template.\n\n357\n00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.090\nYou need to update the links to the page.\n\n358\n00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:33.820\nSo I'm gonna say update, and\nit's gonna say, what do I want to update?\n\n359\n00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.110\nLook in the files that use this template\nand it says update any library items,\n\n360\n00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.570\nany template items, and\nit says show me when I'm done.\n\n361\n00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.600\nSo, at this point it says it's done,\nso I'm gonna say close.\n\n362\n00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.260\nAnd now if I go back to the about page,\nand I open that up, and\n\n363\n00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:55.190\nI do my F12,\ninstantly I can come over here.\n\n364\n00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.674\nAnd I can see that it's already pointing\ndown in the bottom left-hand corner,\n\n365\n00:19:58.674 --> 00:19:59.663\nit says about.html.\n\n366\n00:19:59.663 --> 00:20:03.049\nIf I click on this, it's now working,\nit says about.html.\n\n367\n00:20:03.049 --> 00:20:08.263\nIf I go Home, it says about.html, and\nI didn't associate my index.html yet\n\n368\n00:20:08.263 --> 00:20:12.310\nto this template, so\nit still does the hashtag, okay.\n\n369\n00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:16.820\nSo, the template is very useful for\nbuilding pages very quickly, because now I\n\n370\n00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.610\ncan do company news, I can do careers,\nand I can do all these other pages.\n\n371\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.315\nSo, I'm gonna go File > New,\nbased on a Site Template,\n\n372\n00:20:24.315 --> 00:20:29.356\ncreate a new template, I'm gonna Save As,\nI'm gonna call it companyNews.\n\n373\n00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:36.452\nI'm gonna do another template.\n\n374\n00:20:36.452 --> 00:20:41.150\nThe next one is careers.\n\n375\n00:20:51.397 --> 00:20:53.660\nAnd then the last one, File > New.\n\n376\n00:20:55.983 --> 00:20:59.554\nCreate from the template, and\nthis one is going to be contact us.\n\n377\n00:20:59.554 --> 00:21:04.855\nAnd I'll just call this one contact.\n\n378\n00:21:07.505 --> 00:21:09.985\nOkay, so I have all of my pages created.\n\n379\n00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.830\nAnd now I'm ready to go back into\nthe Dreamweaver template, and\n\n380\n00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:20.711\nstart pointing appropriately and\nmaking sure that works.\n\n381\n00:21:20.711 --> 00:21:26.320\nNow, let me show you how to\nassociate an index.html file,\n\n382\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.580\nor as a file you've already created,\nto a template.\n\n383\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.035\nHere we go.\nWe're going to go into our Assets panel to\n\n384\n00:21:33.035 --> 00:21:36.307\nassociate that template to the index file.\n\n385\n00:21:36.307 --> 00:21:40.296\nAnd in the Assets panel,\nwe haven't taken a look at this yet,\n\n386\n00:21:40.296 --> 00:21:42.810\nbut to the left, I have these icons.\n\n387\n00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.770\nSo, for example, right here I have an\nimage icon, and I can see whatever images\n\n388\n00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:51.024\nI've applied to my page, and you'll see\nevery instance of those images, okay.\n\n389\n00:21:51.024 --> 00:21:54.420\nAnd then I have colors.\n\n390\n00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.660\nSo any colors that I've applied to the web\npage will be listed in there as well.\n\n391\n00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.610\nSo any asset,\n\n392\n00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.190\nessentially, that I've already applied\nto the page will be listed in here.\n\n393\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.250\nWell one of the assets that we're\nworking on our web site is a template.\n\n394\n00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.150\nSo if I keep going down,\nI've got scripts and\n\n395\n00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:11.320\nI've got multimedia, I've got a library,\nbut I a templates icon right here.\n\n396\n00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.310\nAnd this templates icon will let me\nassociate the current selected page\n\n397\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.070\nwith the template that we've been using.\n\n398\n00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.620\nSo here's the My Template, from our list,\nand I just need to hit the Apply button,\n\n399\n00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.240\nright here.\n\n400\n00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.990\nSo if I click Apply,\nit will give me this dialogue box.\n\n401\n00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.780\nThe dialogue box says some regions in\nthis document have no corresponding\n\n402\n00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.240\nregions in the template, so\n\n403\n00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.040\nwhat I need to do is I need to tell\nit how to resolve these issues.\n\n404\n00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.388\nNow, in my current template, it's right.\n\n405\n00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:37.428\nI don't have the body,\n\n406\n00:22:37.428 --> 00:22:40.187\nI put the template where the editable\nregion is inside of main.\n\n407\n00:22:40.187 --> 00:22:43.446\nAnd I don't have anything editable\nin the header, which I could, but\n\n408\n00:22:43.446 --> 00:22:46.440\nI don't, and therefore,\nthere's nothing to resolve there.\n\n409\n00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.049\nSo what I'm gonna do is select body, and\nI'm gonna say instead of not resolved,\n\n410\n00:22:50.049 --> 00:22:52.718\nI'm gonna grab the pull down here and\nI do have the choices.\n\n411\n00:22:52.718 --> 00:22:54.639\nI can make it a head,\nI can do it the doc.title or\n\n412\n00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:56.038\nthe main which is what we created.\n\n413\n00:22:56.038 --> 00:22:59.720\nBut I'm gonna say don't move this\nanywhere, leave it right where it is.\n\n414\n00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:05.860\nSo what I'm gonna do here is click on\nnowhere and you choose use for all.\n\n415\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.770\nThat use for all will allow it to\napply to any unresolved issues.\n\n416\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.130\nSo, now I say nowhere.\n\n417\n00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.770\nOnce I do that, I click OK,\nand now, what it does,\n\n418\n00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.670\nit does exactly what it did to About Us,\nand to Careers, and all the others.\n\n419\n00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.420\nIt places a main content section\nright in the middle of the page and\n\n420\n00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.031\nit allows me to put in whatever I want.\n\n421\n00:23:23.031 --> 00:23:25.607\nAnd I'm just gonna put a home page here or\nHome, just so\n\n422\n00:23:25.607 --> 00:23:26.952\nyou know this is a Home Page.\n\n423\n00:23:26.952 --> 00:23:32.105\nNow I'm going to save this and then I'm\ngoing to go to my Preview in browser,\n\n424\n00:23:32.105 --> 00:23:35.095\nand you can right here\nI'm in the home page.\n\n425\n00:23:35.095 --> 00:23:37.103\nI click on this one it doesn't Home,\nit says Main.\n\n426\n00:23:37.103 --> 00:23:39.780\nBut I click on this one, it goes to home.\n\n427\n00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:43.450\nSo, you know I'm swapping between the two\nwithout having to look at the URL.\n\n428\n00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:44.946\nSo, fantastic.\n\n429\n00:23:44.946 --> 00:23:49.628\nOkay, so at this point,\nwe have created a template,\n\n430\n00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:54.580\nwell actually,\nwe have redesigned our website.\n\n431\n00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.632\nMade everything fit the way we wanted it\nto, so that when we create the template,\n\n432\n00:23:58.632 --> 00:24:01.673\nwe can move everything out and\nput all the pieces together and\n\n433\n00:24:01.673 --> 00:24:04.250\nthen build all of our pages\nbased on that template.\n\n434\n00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:08.996\nAnd now we can modify the content in\nthe main section specific to each of\n\n435\n00:24:08.996 --> 00:24:09.806\nthe pages.\n\n436\n00:24:09.806 --> 00:24:14.138\nWell, what I'd like to do now is,\nI would like to create, or go to,\n\n437\n00:24:14.138 --> 00:24:18.926\nthe Careers page and I would like to\ninsert a table with the possible careers\n\n438\n00:24:18.926 --> 00:24:21.480\nthat we have available at our company.\n\n439\n00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.242\nSo I'm going to open the Careers file.\n\n440\n00:24:25.242 --> 00:24:28.150\nI'm gonna go inside of Main, and\nI'm gonna remove that main text.\n\n441\n00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.230\nSo here's that template,\nthat editable region again, and\n\n442\n00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:35.000\nyou can even see it in the tag selectors,\nit says that it's an editable region.\n\n443\n00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.090\nAnd what I'd like to do is insert a table.\n\n444\n00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:42.580\nTo do that, I'm going to go up to\nmy html here, on the Insert tab and\n\n445\n00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.950\nthen I'm going to search for\nthe Table icon.\n\n446\n00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.960\nSo it's right here, inside the group.\n\n447\n00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.710\nAnd I'm gonna click on that.\n\n448\n00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:55.620\nSo based on this dialog box,\nthe table will ask me questions again,\n\n449\n00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.580\nit's just a matter of filling in some\nfields so very easy to work on that.\n\n450\n00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.460\nAnd so I can specify how many rows or\n\n451\n00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.530\ncolumns, I might need what the size of\nthe table would be to fill in that region,\n\n452\n00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.900\nwhat boarder thickness, so you can see the\nseparation between each of those rows and\n\n453\n00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.500\ncolumns, cell padding and cell spacing.\n\n454\n00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:16.540\nOkay, again, the spacing between the\ncontent inside of each of the cells and\n\n455\n00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.180\nthe borders around them, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.450\nYou can add a caption and a summary.\n\n457\n00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:25.190\nNow again, for accessibility\nreasons you'll wanna add a caption.\n\n458\n00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.080\nYou'll wanna say what\nthis table's all about.\n\n459\n00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.150\nNow it's gonna list that\nat the top of the table.\n\n460\n00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.490\nIn our case we'll say something like job\nopportunities, or something like that.\n\n461\n00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.590\nSo I'm gonna type that in right now.\n\n462\n00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.630\nJob Opportunities.\n\n463\n00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:42.950\nSo there we are and the summary I can just\nwrite in a summary that says looking for\n\n464\n00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:51.160\nwork check out our offerings and again\nif I could spell I'd be all set right?\n\n465\n00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:53.660\nOkay there we go.\n\n466\n00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.790\nSo at this point I'm thinking\nI'll go with the three rows.\n\n467\n00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.070\nI'll go with two columns.\n\n468\n00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.980\nAnd then I'll do 200\npixels is good enough.\n\n469\n00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.650\nBorder thickness 1 is good enough.\n\n470\n00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.790\nJust so you'll see it.\n\n471\n00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.690\nAnd I'll click OK and\nthere is the table I just added\n\n472\n00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.410\nwith the title across the job\ncalled Job Opportunities.\n\n473\n00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.210\nNow all I need to do is put my\ncursor inside each of the cells and\n\n474\n00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.640\nlist what each of those\njob opportunities are.\n\n475\n00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.310\nSo in this example,\n\n476\n00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:22.280\nI'm gonna put maybe one of\nthe Job Opportunities is Web Design.\n\n477\n00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.360\nIsn't that possible?\n\n478\n00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.330\nLook at this, you're just learning\nDreamweaver and already you can get a job.\n\n479\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:30.620\nAnd I'll say that we start out at,\nI don't know, 35K just for this example.\n\n480\n00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.110\nOr I might want to list\nsomething else here.\n\n481\n00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.490\nBut then we'll do another one and\nwe're gonna say that this one is,\n\n482\n00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:42.410\nI don't know,\nwe'll say Java Development or Developer.\n\n483\n00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.200\nAnd this one will be 65k.\n\n484\n00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.130\nSo there you can see\nthe difference between how much\n\n485\n00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.500\nyou make as a Java Developer and\nhow much you make as a Web \\Developer.\n\n486\n00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.350\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n487\n00:26:55.390 --> 00:27:02.590\nAll right, and then the last one we'll\njust say is for a project manager.\n\n488\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.950\nBecause you've gotta have projects\nthat people can manage, right?\n\n489\n00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:10.350\nNow I did make it only 200 pixels wide,\nso that's not very wide, and\n\n490\n00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.600\nI'll show you here that we\ncan change those settings.\n\n491\n00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.700\nSo I'm gonna say that this one makes,\n\n492\n00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.460\nwe'll say that they make just a little\nbit less than that Java developer.\n\n493\n00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.080\nThey're in-demand.\n\n494\n00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.260\nOkay, so I'm going to select the table.\n\n495\n00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.910\nTo do that, in my Tag Selectors down here\nat the bottom I'm gonna click on Table.\n\n496\n00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:28.690\nAnd now it changes my properties.\n\n497\n00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.350\nRemember, I made it 200 pixels wide.\n\n498\n00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.370\nAnd I don't have enough room.\n\n499\n00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.950\nI'm getting this text wrapping here,\nand I don't want that.\n\n500\n00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.510\nSo I'm going to increase the size.\n\n501\n00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.110\nMaybe we'll try 300 pixels.\n\n502\n00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:42.390\nSo when I hit Enter, now I've got plenty\nof room so it's only taking up one row.\n\n503\n00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.060\nI'm not sure that I like this\nthickness of these borders all around.\n\n504\n00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.810\nSo this border here is set to one.\n\n505\n00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.510\nI can change that to zero, and\n\n506\n00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.670\nwhat that'll do is it'll literally\nget rid of the borders altogether.\n\n507\n00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:57.270\nSo when you look at this inside of\na browser now, what you're gonna see\n\n508\n00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:01.270\nis just the information, and it's gonna\nbe lined up really nice and good.\n\n509\n00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.070\nNow notice it is left-aligned,\n\n510\n00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.520\na lot like the content we've been\nworking with, we have to tell it hey,\n\n511\n00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.480\ndon't make that left-aligned, set the\nmargins of that to automatically adjust.\n\n512\n00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:15.510\nOr even text align that editable region,\nso that way they're central.\n\n513\n00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.410\nLet me try that here.\n\n514\n00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:18.440\nSo it looks like it's centered here.\n\n515\n00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:24.610\nSo if I click in this main editable\nregion right here, I can select that.\n\n516\n00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.690\nAnd I can go into my CSS designer panel.\n\n517\n00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.376\nAnd I should be able to add a new style,\nMain Wrapper here, and\n\n518\n00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:36.190\nwhen I hit Enter, can't make these\nchanges, here's what's happening.\n\n519\n00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:40.230\nHere, I attempted to add a new\nstyle into a document that has\n\n520\n00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:44.270\nan associated template, and\nit's telling me that I can't make a change\n\n521\n00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:47.880\nbecause it will require a code\nto be edited in the template and\n\n522\n00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.040\nI don't allow code editing in\nthe template except in the main section.\n\n523\n00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:57.400\nSo I can't do it inside of this page,\nI have to do it in the template.\n\n524\n00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.360\nSo what I'm gonna do is click OK.\n\n525\n00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:04.950\nSo now I'm going to move\nto the my template file.\n\n526\n00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:10.610\nAnd I'm going to go into my CSS\ndesigner here in the upper right.\n\n527\n00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.020\nAnd I do see that I have\na Wrapper Main already created, so\n\n528\n00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.810\nthere's a style already for the Main\nwhere we've got our editable region.\n\n529\n00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.850\nBut I'd like to duplicate this and\nadd the table to it.\n\n530\n00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:24.470\nSo if there's a table inside of Main,\nit's gonna take on these settings.\n\n531\n00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.980\nso I'm gonna right click,\nand choose Duplicate, and\n\n532\n00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:33.850\nthen from here I'm gonna actually\nadd the table tag to that code.\n\n533\n00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:35.470\nSo you can write in your own code.\n\n534\n00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.910\nYou don't have to click on an item and\n\n535\n00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.310\nthen receive it as a dynamic link,\nyou could just write it in.\n\n536\n00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:45.348\nSo when I hit Enter here it's\ngoing to allow me to now\n\n537\n00:29:45.348 --> 00:29:49.160\nstylize the settings for this code.\n\n538\n00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.510\nSo I'm gonna design Wrapper Main table.\n\n539\n00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.170\nI come into this list.\n\n540\n00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:57.205\nAnd, I'm going to come right here where\nit says margins, and I'll put auto.\n\n541\n00:29:58.923 --> 00:29:59.920\nAnd I'm gonna hit enter.\n\n542\n00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.350\nAnd, I'm gonna go to text, and\nmake sure it's center, which it is,\n\n543\n00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.200\nit's center aligned.\n\n544\n00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.430\nBut that should take care of it.\n\n545\n00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:09.400\nDoing the Margins Auto on the table,\nshould make it so that way, and\n\n546\n00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.090\nthe table will now autoalign\njust like our web page does.\n\n547\n00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.740\nIt autoaligns no matter where we do it.\n\n548\n00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.560\nSo here's the thing.\n\n549\n00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.500\nI've created this, and you can see\nright up here, I've got these stars.\n\n550\n00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.730\nIt tells me I made\na change to my template.\n\n551\n00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:26.560\nTherefore, if I save this template with\nmy Ctrl+S or Cmd+S on the Mac, it says,\n\n552\n00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.550\nhey, now that you're making this change,\n\n553\n00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.530\nyou need to update every\nsingle one of the files.\n\n554\n00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.310\nEven though I've got a couple of them\nopen, they're going to update them,\n\n555\n00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.230\nand it's gonna write the code in there for\nwhat i just did.\n\n556\n00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:42.900\nSo if I say update, it will\nautomatically update all of the files.\n\n557\n00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.760\nThey're done, okay?\n\n558\n00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.280\nSo I click close.\n\n559\n00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.790\nAnd notice now, I now have an asterisk\non index at HTML right here.\n\n560\n00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:53.170\nAnd I have an asterisk on careers, that\nmeans that they've applied the changes,\n\n561\n00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.720\nI just haven't saved them yet\nbecause they were open.\n\n562\n00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.610\nBut any file that was closed or\n\n563\n00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.980\nnot open automatically got the update\nwithout having to worry about it.\n\n564\n00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.590\nSo for these two, I'd have to click\nhere and do my Ctrl- or Cmd-S, and\n\n565\n00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.540\nthen click on this one, and since I wanna\npreview this to see if it actually worked,\n\n566\n00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:13.480\nI'm gonna do my F12, which will\nask me to save, I'll say yes, and\n\n567\n00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.060\nnow you can see that the table\nis now centered to that page.\n\n568\n00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:22.430\nSo at this point we've learned\nthat we can use the template\n\n569\n00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:26.140\nto create multiple pages\nwithin our design and\n\n570\n00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.030\nwe can quickly create multiple pages cuz\nit doesn't require a lot of thought.\n\n571\n00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:33.500\nBut now I just need to customize\neach page to make it, so\n\n572\n00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.750\nthat way I have interesting content\nthat's specific to that page.\n\n573\n00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.540\nSo, I'm gonna go back to About Us.\n\n574\n00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.470\nNotice there's nothing there.\n\n575\n00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:40.710\nHome, there's nothing there.\n\n576\n00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.000\nAnd I haven't created my link yet for\n\n577\n00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.350\nCareers, which would take me back to\nthat page with that table in there.\n\n578\n00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:53.330\nOkay, so\nat this point we've learned templates and\n\n579\n00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:58.540\nwe've learned table information and we've\nlearned how to use CSS styling to work\n\n580\n00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.650\nwith that table styles and\nhow to use it to change information.\n\n581\n00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.510\nI'd like to take a look at\nthe structure of the table,\n\n582\n00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:07.230\njust to show you what\nthe code looks like again.\n\n583\n00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.010\nSo if you're trying to learn,\nwe can see what that's gonna look like.\n\n584\n00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:15.760\nSo if I go into my table, you'll see\nall the blue code starting at line 79.\n\n585\n00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.180\nHere's the initial table.\n\n586\n00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.070\nThere's that caption that we wrote for\naccessibility.\n\n587\n00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:24.680\nHere is the table body, which has all\nof my table rows, and the table data.\n\n588\n00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.230\nSo a table row is one of the rows, but\n\n589\n00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.840\na table data is actually a column\nwithin that row and I had two columns.\n\n590\n00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.600\nSo there's the column of information,\nokay?\n\n591\n00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.470\nSo that's how I wrote it.\n\n592\n00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:39.600\nAnd then of course I have my closing table\nhere, and my closing table body as well.\n\n593\n00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.630\nSo those two are inside of\nthe editable region that we had.\n\n594\n00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:43.640\n>> All right.\n\n595\n00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.400\n>> Fantastic.\n\n596\n00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.540\n>> I appreciate that, Jim.\n\n597\n00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.880\nA lot of information on templates and\ntables,\n\n598\n00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.180\nit does look like though we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n599\n00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.870\nBut before we sign off, got any additional\ninformation you would like to tell us?\n\n600\n00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.150\n>> Sure, thanks Wes.\n\n601\n00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.180\nJust keep in mind that\nworking with templates,\n\n602\n00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.170\nyou always have to have\nan editable region.\n\n603\n00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:05.550\nWithout an editable region, you're just\ncreating pages that are exactly the same,\n\n604\n00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.000\nbut you can't do anything with them.\n\n605\n00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.960\nSo, I like to go to my Insert panel and\nmake sure I'm working with this\n\n606\n00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.730\nbecause this kind of guides me as\nto what I'm going to need here.\n\n607\n00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:18.450\nSo all these little wonderful icons,\nthe repeating region,\n\n608\n00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:22.906\nthe optional region, those kinds of\nthings, it helps guide me to what I need.\n\n609\n00:33:22.906 --> 00:33:28.140\nSo, templates, editable regions,\n\n610\n00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.950\nand the fact that I can add content\ninside of the editable region,\n\n611\n00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:37.420\nand apply those templates to multiple\npages, and you can see quickly and easily,\n\n612\n00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:42.470\nI can build a web page based on\nthat template and it updates\n\n613\n00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:46.070\nautomatically any time that I update\nthe template, updates all of the pages.\n\n614\n00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.340\nSo if you have 50 pages that\nare based on a template,\n\n615\n00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.830\nthey'll all update exactly the same way.\n\n616\n00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:54.330\n>> Jim we appreciate all that information,\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n617\n00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:55.580\nSinging out for IT Pro TV.\n\n618\n00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.370\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n619\n00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:58.260\n>> And I'm Jim Searles.\n\n620\n00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.144\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n621\n00:34:00.144 --> 00:34:08.350\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.250\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.790\nwe are continuing through\nour Dreamweaver series.\n\n5\n00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.500\nThat's right.\nWe're coming back with more of that\n\n6\n00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.911\ncreative cloud, 2015.\n\n7\n00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:25.580\nAnd we're looking at creating forms.\n\n8\n00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.370\nJoining me back in the studios today\nis none other than Mr. Jim Searles.\n\n9\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.690\nJim, how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.850\n>> Wes, I'm doing great, and\nthank you for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.350\nAlso, thank you to the ITProTV team for\nhaving me, as well.\n\n12\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.080\nI appreciate talking about Dream Weaver.\n\n13\n00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.100\nAnd today is a wonderful topic\nbecause it's very important.\n\n14\n00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.270\nIt's all about forms and\nadding form controls to your design.\n\n15\n00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.880\nAnd making sure that you can\ngather feedback from your users.\n\n16\n00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.300\nAnd so that's why it's important.\n\n17\n00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.880\nSo we've been creating a design,\nand we do have a Contact Us page.\n\n18\n00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.430\nAnd it's where the Contact Us page is is\nthat we want to add the form controls.\n\n19\n00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.550\nAnd when we do this, we're literally\ngoing to work in the Properties panel.\n\n20\n00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.040\nIf you've been following\nalong in other episodes we've\n\n21\n00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.980\nbeen working in the Properties panel for\nthese particular objects.\n\n22\n00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.370\nBut it's in the Properties panel that I\nwanna talk about some important pieces\n\n23\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.440\nof the form.\n\n24\n00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.980\nBecause the way the form works it's meant\nto provide you with some results and\n\n25\n00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.630\nsome feedback.\n\n26\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.790\nSo you're gonna have to understand some\npieces here that connect a server, or\n\n27\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.440\nthat may email them out,\nor whatever, however\n\n28\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.280\nyou're gonna manage the information\nthat's gonna be important in there.\n\n29\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.930\nSo we're gonna go back\ninto our application and\n\n30\n00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.150\nwe're gonna take a look at\nthe Insert panel up here at the top.\n\n31\n00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.480\nAnd we're literally gonna go\nto the Form category here.\n\n32\n00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.670\nNow we're gonna talk about\nthese icons inside of the Form\n\n33\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.540\ncategory on the Insert panel.\n\n34\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.000\nBut the one all the way to\nthe left is a form control.\n\n35\n00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000\nThat will literally\nestablish in our design,\n\n36\n00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.200\nthat we are building a form, and\nthat we're putting it inside of this area.\n\n37\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.100\nNow in a previous episode we talked\nabout creating a template, and\n\n38\n00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.370\nI currently only have my 'Contact\nUs' page with an editable region and\n\n39\n00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.435\nit's in the main section here,\nthat I am gonna add those form controls.\n\n40\n00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:15.005\nSo, I am going to delete the word\n'main' and I'm gonna insert the form.\n\n41\n00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:16.505\nSo, literally insert the form and\n\n42\n00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:21.500\nwhat you're gonna see is, a box with a red\nborder appear, and now you'll see down\n\n43\n00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.620\nhere in the properties panel I have\nthe ability to work with the form.\n\n44\n00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.140\nSo here's where we gonna have\na conversation about the form\n\n45\n00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.010\nproperties on your page.\n\n46\n00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.150\nSo we're going to start with the form id.\n\n47\n00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.750\nForm1 tells you the form\nthat you're using.\n\n48\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.890\nYou may have many different types\nof forms on your website and\n\n49\n00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.820\nyou need to label them, in order to\nunderstand which one you're working with.\n\n50\n00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.710\nOr, which one you've\nreceived the feedback from.\n\n51\n00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.220\nThat'll be very important for that.\n\n52\n00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.900\nSo in this case, this is our contact us,\nso I'm actually gonna call it contact.\n\n53\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.425\nAnd get my spelling right here.\n\n54\n00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:56.445\nContact form.\n\n55\n00:02:56.445 --> 00:02:57.665\nAnd literally, that's what it is.\n\n56\n00:02:57.665 --> 00:03:00.225\nIt's identifying what\nform this relates to.\n\n57\n00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:02.585\nAnd it's saying it's coming\nfrom the contact page.\n\n58\n00:03:02.585 --> 00:03:06.212\nSo if I hit the tab key for\nexample, now that's locked in.\n\n59\n00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:09.722\nThe class, if I've created a class\nusing my styles, I can apply that.\n\n60\n00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:15.202\nSo if I've got some items I wanna be\nconsistent with across multiple pages,\n\n61\n00:03:15.202 --> 00:03:17.152\nI can apply that class here.\n\n62\n00:03:17.152 --> 00:03:20.501\nNot this is where we start to\nget important, this action and\n\n63\n00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.771\nthis method section here.\n\n64\n00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:26.281\nSo the action determines how you're\ngoing to handle the results.\n\n65\n00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:31.091\nSo literally you could specify either the\nform script that you might get from your\n\n66\n00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:33.701\nwebsite provider.\n\n67\n00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:38.460\nOr you might include here the email\naddress that you want to send this to.\n\n68\n00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.660\nNow it's not standard in this day and\nage to use an email address.\n\n69\n00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.970\nAnd here's why.\n\n70\n00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.130\nWeb crawlers can pick up\non that information and\n\n71\n00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.870\nyou're gonna get a ton of spam.\n\n72\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.850\nSo it is a good idea to use\nform mail script of some kind.\n\n73\n00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.630\nAnd you can, any service provider\nthat you connect with and\n\n74\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.190\nthat you pay a monthly\nfee to to host your site\n\n75\n00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.520\ncan provide you formal script with\ninstructions on what you need to do.\n\n76\n00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.570\nFor today,\nwe are going to use an e-mail address,\n\n77\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.610\njust so\nthat way we can see how that works.\n\n78\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.487\nBut the point here is that in the real\nworld you are probably going to use\n\n79\n00:04:11.487 --> 00:04:14.310\nformal script inside of the action box.\n\n80\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.410\nNow, we have a method underneath\nthis section as well, and\n\n81\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.380\nthere are two options that are available.\n\n82\n00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.060\nThe Default, which is basically\ngoing to automatically adjust.\n\n83\n00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.830\nOr, you have GET or POST.\n\n84\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.740\nNow, these are the two that are important.\n\n85\n00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.080\nPOST means that you're\ngonna send via email.\n\n86\n00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.490\nSo, you're gonna send it in the clear,\nmeaning that it's not secure.\n\n87\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.320\nAnd that datas going to\nbe sent out via email.\n\n88\n00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.700\nGET method is what you use if\nyour connecting to a server.\n\n89\n00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.170\nSo, it's like PUT and GET,\nPUT means upload, GET means receive, okay,\n\n90\n00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.320\nand basically this is telling you that\nyou're connecting to some kind of server.\n\n91\n00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.930\nSo if you're going to use form mail,\nyou could use GET.\n\n92\n00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.380\nBut this is your,\nthey call it, mine control.\n\n93\n00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.030\nAnd how you're going to transmit that.\n\n94\n00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.040\nSo I'm gonna leave it as post and\n\n95\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.660\nI'm gonna write right inside of the action\nhere, I'm gonna write a mailto command.\n\n96\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.960\nSo mailto literally triggers\nthe browser to search for\n\n97\n00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.330\nthe default email\napplication on the system.\n\n98\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.060\nAnd it's going to email it\nto whatever I type here.\n\n99\n00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.350\nSo if I type in jimbo@jimbo.com for\n\n100\n00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.320\nexample, and that might be a legitimate\nemail address, and that is going to\n\n101\n00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.690\nget all of the form fields that we're\ngoing to put inside of our design.\n\n102\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.060\nIt's gonna take it and\nemail it to that address.\n\n103\n00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.020\nOkay, now we have another\nsection inside of our\n\n104\n00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.480\nProperties panel down here at the bottom.\n\n105\n00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.660\nIt says are we going to validate this?\n\n106\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.850\nAre we going to autocomplete?\n\n107\n00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.330\nSo as we start working with our forms,\nare we going to allow for autocompletion?\n\n108\n00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.420\nSo if you've filled out forms in the past,\nis it going to put the same information in\n\n109\n00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.500\nthere based on the same type of\nfield that you're working with?\n\n110\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.541\nSo if it's an email field and\nyou've filled out emails before,\n\n111\n00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:50.470\nis it gonna show me all the emails that\nI can choose from and put that in there.\n\n112\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.670\nThe validation will allow\nme to validate the forms so\n\n113\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.010\nthat way I can test\nagainst is this an email?\n\n114\n00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.990\nIs it legit?\n\n115\n00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.802\nDoes it have an @ symbol?\n\n116\n00:05:59.802 --> 00:06:04.090\nDoes it have a .com or\na .net inside of the email field?\n\n117\n00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.060\nOr is the phone number\nwritten like a phone number?\n\n118\n00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.270\nDoes it have ten numbers in it?\n\n119\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.140\nIs it structured where you've\ngot an area code or prefix?\n\n120\n00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.830\nAnd the four digits.\n\n121\n00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.330\nIs the zip code five digits?\n\n122\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.930\nThat kind of thing.\n\n123\n00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.900\nSo what the validation allows you to do\nis it literally tests the form fields to\n\n124\n00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.570\nmake sure that the user is providing\nyou what you asked them for.\n\n125\n00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.880\nSo we are going to not check that box.\n\n126\n00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.839\nWe wanna validate as we move through it.\n\n127\n00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.960\nEncoding type, okay so\nright now it's set to default.\n\n128\n00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.790\nBut here's our multi part form data and\nwe also have application and\n\n129\n00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.320\nthis is gonna send it\nout as a URL in code.\n\n130\n00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.840\nSo again if you're passing information\nonto the server based on what's being\n\n131\n00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.740\nput out here you can chose\nthe appropriate type\n\n132\n00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.810\nbased on the ISP what they provide you.\n\n133\n00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.620\nI'm just gonna leave this as default and\nthen lastly,\n\n134\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.050\nthe target, it says default here.\n\n135\n00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.930\nAnd this is similar to our web links\nthat we created earlier in previous\n\n136\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.690\nsessions where it will open probably\na new browser tab or that kind of thing.\n\n137\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.040\nIt's gonna bring it up in it's own window,\nokay so that's what the target is all\n\n138\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.880\nabout, and I'm collapsing down\nmy files panel and over here.\n\n139\n00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.360\nMy panels to the right so I can see more,\n\n140\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.900\ncuz I notice that there's It's\nhiding some of my properties.\n\n141\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.210\nSo let me see if I can do this here.\n\n142\n00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.770\nThere we go.\n\n143\n00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.930\nIt wasn't, wasn't cooperating.\n\n144\n00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.060\nOkay.\nTitle.\n\n145\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.750\nTitle is for your accessibility, again.\n\n146\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.470\nSo we'll want to make\nsure that we add a title.\n\n147\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.530\nIt also means that when\nyou hover over this form,\n\n148\n00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.180\nit will tell you what the form is.\n\n149\n00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.860\nSo it's literally going to\ngive you that screen tip.\n\n150\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.869\nSo the title here for\nthis form is gonna be send feedback\n\n151\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.480\nto us, so we can\n\n152\n00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.620\nmake things better just for\nthis example here.\n\n153\n00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.559\nOkay and\nthen it says accept character set.\n\n154\n00:07:53.559 --> 00:07:58.321\nWell when we first talked in our\nintroduction about HTML and we discussed\n\n155\n00:07:58.321 --> 00:08:03.568\nthat we used the Western character set\nUTF-8, you can specify here UTF-8.\n\n156\n00:08:03.568 --> 00:08:07.635\nThe default will just make it, so that way\nit's gonna use whatever the default is for\n\n157\n00:08:07.635 --> 00:08:09.080\nthe language that they need.\n\n158\n00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.304\nISO 8859-1 is another\nstandard that's out there.\n\n159\n00:08:13.304 --> 00:08:16.358\nBut if you wanna force it to use\nthe Western character set that we use.\n\n160\n00:08:16.358 --> 00:08:19.946\nIn the United States, for\nexample, we can use UTF-8 here,\n\n161\n00:08:19.946 --> 00:08:23.070\nand that's the setting\nthere that we can set to.\n\n162\n00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.970\nSo, those are the options\nthat are available and\n\n163\n00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.030\nthe properties that\nare important to using the form.\n\n164\n00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.370\nNow, I haven't added any fields yet.\n\n165\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.188\nAll I've done is configured the form\nthe way that I think it's gonna work best.\n\n166\n00:08:37.188 --> 00:08:43.530\nNow, I'm gonna go back into my design and\nclick to place my cursor inside the form.\n\n167\n00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.180\nSo, right now, my cursor's in the form.\n\n168\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.850\nAnd if you have any question about that,\nif I look at my tag selector,\n\n169\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.150\nit says, I'm in form.\n\n170\n00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.550\nAnd the ID is the hashtag\ncontact form because it's an ID.\n\n171\n00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.820\nNow, I can start laying out some fields.\n\n172\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.000\nSo, when I think about this what\nI wanna capture from the user\n\n173\n00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.910\nis at least their first and last name,\ndefinitely their email address.\n\n174\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.150\nYou don't always wanna capture somebody's\nphone number, because that's usually\n\n175\n00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.090\nprivate and people will stop\nfilling out a form at that point.\n\n176\n00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.590\nI'm definitely gonna\nneed a submit button for\n\n177\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.600\nthem to submit it at the end when\nthey're done filling it out.\n\n178\n00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.340\nAnd I might even wanna include,\nfor example, a reset button.\n\n179\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.860\nSo, at bare minimum, you're gonna want\nfirst and last name of the person.\n\n180\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.800\nYou're gonna want the email address and\nthen a submit and a reset button.\n\n181\n00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.140\nThose are the minimum items that\nyou should have in your form.\n\n182\n00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.360\nNow everything else is pretty much gravy.\n\n183\n00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.512\nSo if you ask them for\ntheir address, if you ask them, hey,\n\n184\n00:09:36.512 --> 00:09:39.302\ndo you wanna subscribe to my newsletter,\nyes or no.\n\n185\n00:09:39.302 --> 00:09:44.832\nThat's usually icing on the cake, but you\nwanna grab at least the name of the person\n\n186\n00:09:44.832 --> 00:09:50.670\nand the email address, because you wanna\nhave a way to communicate back to them.\n\n187\n00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.668\nNow, because we're asking for feedback,\n\n188\n00:09:52.668 --> 00:09:55.698\nyou also want a text area where\nthey can type their question, kay.\n\n189\n00:09:55.698 --> 00:09:58.776\nYou don't need to have that cuz\nmaybe you're just doing this for\n\n190\n00:09:58.776 --> 00:10:00.210\nmarketing purposes.\n\n191\n00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.710\nAnd hey, it might be one of those forms\nthat you say, for more information,\n\n192\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.500\nclick here.\n\n193\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.180\nAnd you want their name and\ntheir email and that's it, kay?\n\n194\n00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.200\nBut in this case, we're looking for\nthem to contact us and\n\n195\n00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.830\nwe wanna know what they\nwanna talk to us about.\n\n196\n00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.120\nSo we'll have a text area in here as well,\nkay?\n\n197\n00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.650\nSo these are the kind of forms\nfields that we're gonna use.\n\n198\n00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.420\nSo if I go back into my application here\nand inside of the insert panel at the top,\n\n199\n00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.380\nwe're gonna talk about the different\nform fields that are available.\n\n200\n00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.080\nSo if I just hover over it, I can see\nright away that I can add a text field.\n\n201\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.800\nA text field is where I might grab, for\n\n202\n00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.985\nexample, the first and last name of\nthe person, so that would be a text field.\n\n203\n00:10:32.985 --> 00:10:35.455\nThe @ sign is for the email address.\n\n204\n00:10:35.455 --> 00:10:39.925\nSo those two, notice they're right next\nto the form creation icon because those\n\n205\n00:10:39.925 --> 00:10:40.785\nare very important.\n\n206\n00:10:40.785 --> 00:10:44.960\nThe first two items are, hey, grab their\nname and grab their email address.\n\n207\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.980\nThen as I go further out,\nyou can even have them create a password.\n\n208\n00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.930\nNow you would need to have a server\nconnection here at this point.\n\n209\n00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.740\nAnd you'd need to have some kind of\ndatabase to store the information.\n\n210\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.970\nSo you wouldn't be gathering passwords\nfrom people if you don't have\n\n211\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.240\na way to save them.\n\n212\n00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.250\nAnd the only way to save it would be to\nmake sure that you're building a database\n\n213\n00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.550\noff of the data you're collecting.\n\n214\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.890\nSo that's a little more advanced.\n\n215\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.330\nNow you can add a URL.\n\n216\n00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.190\nSo what the URL will do is it\nwill allow you to add a field\n\n217\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.080\nthat will let them type in a web address.\n\n218\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.880\nSo for example, if I was gathering\ninformation on somebody who I was trying\n\n219\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.330\nto get for demographic purposes,\n\n220\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.360\nmaybe what their web site they've created\nin the past, I can grab that information.\n\n221\n00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.290\nNow the little phone icon, for those of\nyou who are old enough to remember what\n\n222\n00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.040\na phone looked like,\nthis is the icon for that.\n\n223\n00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.510\nIt's so funny, cuz I guess you can't\njust put a rectangle up there.\n\n224\n00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.380\nit wouldn't remind you that it's a phone,\nright, cuz it's just a box.\n\n225\n00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.190\nBut here, that's what we called a handset\nof a phone back in the old days.\n\n226\n00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.720\nSo that's for telephone number.\n\n227\n00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.960\nYou can do a search abox.\n\n228\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.411\nSo HTML 5 allows you to search\nthrough your website for information.\n\n229\n00:11:44.411 --> 00:11:47.388\nSo you can apply a search box to any\nof your pages on your website, and\n\n230\n00:11:47.388 --> 00:11:50.888\nthat will allow somebody to search real\nquick, so they don't have to go through\n\n231\n00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:54.170\nall your hyperlinks to find\nwhat they're looking for.\n\n232\n00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.010\nYou can add a number field.\n\n233\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.350\nSo maybe you're grabbing some\nkind of number from somebody and\n\n234\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.910\nyou're looking for that information,\nyou can put that in there.\n\n235\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.055\nWe also have, maybe you're looking for\na range of information.\n\n236\n00:12:04.055 --> 00:12:06.260\nKay, so this is all fine and dandy.\n\n237\n00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.705\nColors, so if you wanna search by color or\n\n238\n00:12:08.705 --> 00:12:12.230\nyou wanna do some kind of color picker,\nyou'll allow that to happen.\n\n239\n00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.350\nAnd people can pick a color.\n\n240\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.060\nMaybe you wanna be able to\nadd that on the website, so\n\n241\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.190\nthat way, you can then link to it and\nit will change the design of the website.\n\n242\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.270\nSo that way they can test.\n\n243\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.010\nOr maybe they're on a Home Depot page,\nfor example, and\n\n244\n00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.980\nyou wanna see what the swatches\nlook like on their walls.\n\n245\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.160\nSo that might be a good way to do that.\n\n246\n00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.730\nThe next item is basically\na calendar picker.\n\n247\n00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.130\nSo this will let you choose the month,\nyou can choose whatever week, and\n\n248\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.555\nyou can choose a date.\n\n249\n00:12:35.555 --> 00:12:37.170\nSo the date will be all-encompassing.\n\n250\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.561\nIt'll be the month, the day, the year.\n\n251\n00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:42.215\nAll right, so, but you can specify, maybe\nI just want the month or the week, and\n\n252\n00:12:42.215 --> 00:12:42.905\nadd those in there.\n\n253\n00:12:42.905 --> 00:12:45.795\nSo these are all calendar\npickers that are optional.\n\n254\n00:12:45.795 --> 00:12:46.695\nThen we have a clock.\n\n255\n00:12:46.695 --> 00:12:47.625\nSo you can add a clock.\n\n256\n00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:48.865\nSo you can add time.\n\n257\n00:12:48.865 --> 00:12:50.835\nSo maybe you wanna capture that data.\n\n258\n00:12:50.835 --> 00:12:52.785\nOr you want the date and time combination.\n\n259\n00:12:52.785 --> 00:12:55.490\nSo if I click on that and\nI choose today's date and time,\n\n260\n00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.630\nI will get whatever the time is now and\nwhatever today's date is.\n\n261\n00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:04.980\nThen the other one is datetime-local\nbecause it might be local to the server\n\n262\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.368\nas opposed to local where the person is.\n\n263\n00:13:07.368 --> 00:13:10.420\nSo you wanna grab where they\nare when they submitted the form,\n\n264\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.870\nwhat that time was locally for them.\n\n265\n00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.599\nIt might be completely different to you.\n\n266\n00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.660\nWe also have the ability\nto create that text Area.\n\n267\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.690\nThe text area is going to allow for\nmultiple lines of information,\n\n268\n00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.558\nso this is where I want them\nto give me my feedback.\n\n269\n00:13:24.558 --> 00:13:25.730\nSo we're gonna include this.\n\n270\n00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.760\nSo we're definitely gonna do the text box\nfor first and last name, the email, and\n\n271\n00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.870\ndefinitely the text area.\n\n272\n00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.340\nThen we have the button option.\n\n273\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.960\nRemember I said we need a submit\nbutton and a reset button.\n\n274\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.100\nWell, I have a submit button and\nthen I have the reset.\n\n275\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.640\nSo there's two icons right here,\none submit, one reset, specifically, for\n\n276\n00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.730\nthose purposes.\n\n277\n00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.230\nSubmit will allow the form\nto be submitted and posted.\n\n278\n00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.480\nIn my case, so\nI can receive it in my email.\n\n279\n00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.999\nAnd the reset will make it, so all\nthe form fields become blank again in case\n\n280\n00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:56.025\nthe person just decided\nthey didn't wanna do it.\n\n281\n00:13:56.025 --> 00:13:59.335\nThe next icon is for a file so\nthe person can upload or download a file.\n\n282\n00:13:59.335 --> 00:14:01.685\nSo they can provide,\nthe browse window will come up, and\n\n283\n00:14:01.685 --> 00:14:03.810\nthey can browse your hard drive and\ngive you a file.\n\n284\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.360\nMaybe you're asking them because\nthey're applying for a job.\n\n285\n00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.940\nYou want their resume or\ntheir curricula vitae or\n\n286\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.910\nsome kind of write-up,\nmaybe a cover letter.\n\n287\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.500\nYou can have them upload an image.\n\n288\n00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.470\nSo maybe again, you're doing\na profile picture for your website.\n\n289\n00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.630\nYou're trying to create members and\nyou want them to upload a profile picture.\n\n290\n00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.936\nSo that's available here as well.\n\n291\n00:14:22.936 --> 00:14:24.059\nA hidden field.\n\n292\n00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:28.259\nNow, a hidden field is usually something\nthat passes information on, and\n\n293\n00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:31.540\nusually it's something that\nhappens behind the scenes.\n\n294\n00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.050\nThat's why it says hidden, right?\n\n295\n00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.790\nSo, the user's not gonna see it.\n\n296\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.570\nWhat's gonna happen is, it's gonna\ngrab information from a database.\n\n297\n00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:39.130\nIt'll hold on to it or something.\n\n298\n00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.810\nAnd it'll pass it on to the next\nthing that's gonna happen next.\n\n299\n00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.160\nBut it's really something there for the\ndeveloper, not for the user in this case.\n\n300\n00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.650\nYou have a select list.\n\n301\n00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.260\nA select list will give you options.\n\n302\n00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.190\nSo maybe you're trying to\npresent a list of options.\n\n303\n00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.360\nMaybe you wanna say what category are you\ngonna provide this feedback on, or\n\n304\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.160\nwhat webpage did you find not usable, or\nwhat complaints do you wanna give us for.\n\n305\n00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.150\nAnd then, you just give them\na list that they can pick from, so\n\n306\n00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.050\nthey don't have to write it in.\n\n307\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.950\nThis little eyeball shape, the radio\nbutton, this will give you an option to\n\n308\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.120\nput yes or no values,\ncuz radio buttons are either or options.\n\n309\n00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.020\nSo, if you only want one response\nwithin a list of responses,\n\n310\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.550\nthen you would use a radio button.\n\n311\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.990\nIf I want yes or no,\nI would use a radio button.\n\n312\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:26.680\nHowever, as we go through this a little\nbit later, you'll see here a check box.\n\n313\n00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.917\nA check box allows for\nmultiple selections.\n\n314\n00:15:28.917 --> 00:15:33.201\nSo maybe if I say, what web pages on\nour website that you find enjoyable,\n\n315\n00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:34.898\nand I give them check boxes.\n\n316\n00:15:34.898 --> 00:15:37.156\nThey can select more than one.\n\n317\n00:15:37.156 --> 00:15:41.176\nIf I say, what pages on our website\ndid you find enjoyable and I give them\n\n318\n00:15:41.176 --> 00:15:45.407\nonly radio button options, they can\nonly select one from the entire list.\n\n319\n00:15:45.407 --> 00:15:48.022\nAnd it's also good to know,\nwhen you take exams,\n\n320\n00:15:48.022 --> 00:15:52.279\nif the answers from multiple choice are in\ncircles, only one answer is allowed.\n\n321\n00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:56.049\nIf the answers are check boxes,\nmore than one answer is possible, so\n\n322\n00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:57.092\nkeep that in mind.\n\n323\n00:15:57.092 --> 00:15:59.082\nNow we do have a radio button group.\n\n324\n00:15:59.082 --> 00:16:02.370\nSo this is in the event that I have\nmore than two or more than one.\n\n325\n00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.590\nSo if I say, check this radio\nbutton to receive our newsletter,\n\n326\n00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.290\nthen if they check it it's a yes value.\n\n327\n00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.740\nIf they don't check it,\nit's a no value, okay?\n\n328\n00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.760\nBut if I need to have multiple answers\nI can create a group around that, so\n\n329\n00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.740\nI've got three possible,\nor four, or five possible.\n\n330\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.340\nI can create a radio button group,\nbut only one answer is allowed.\n\n331\n00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:24.460\nAnd then we have the same thing here,\nchecks box group, because now I can group\n\n332\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.900\nthem together so now those responses\nbecome part of the same group.\n\n333\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.700\nWe also have a field set.\n\n334\n00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:36.600\nA field set will let me wrap\na section around by design,\n\n335\n00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.090\nand I can label it, so maybe I want\nto put a label across the top, and\n\n336\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.480\nthen group certain items together.\n\n337\n00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.490\nSo, for example,\nI could have personal information.\n\n338\n00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.290\nFirst name, last name, email.\n\n339\n00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.850\nBut then I could have\nfeedback information.\n\n340\n00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.070\nSo I could create a field\nset called feedback and\n\n341\n00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.020\nnow they could provide me a text\nbox of information and whether or\n\n342\n00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.980\nnot they wanna subscribe to\na newsletter for example.\n\n343\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.710\nAnd then the last item is a label.\n\n344\n00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:03.560\nWhat a label does it just lets you\nwrite text inside of this box and\n\n345\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:09.270\nthat text is basically labeling a field,\n\n346\n00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.600\nor it could be labeling a section of\nyour page, or its labeling something.\n\n347\n00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.430\nBut it's just text that they can read,\n\n348\n00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.980\nthey can't actually give\nyou any information.\n\n349\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.930\nIt's labeling something, literally.\n\n350\n00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.850\nAnd now that we've learned the form fields\nthat are available within the form for\n\n351\n00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:27.270\nour design, let's dive in and\nstart adding them into our design.\n\n352\n00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.180\nSo, what I'm gonna do first\nis I'd like to label my form.\n\n353\n00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.730\nI'm gonna go up here and\njust click the Label icon.\n\n354\n00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.987\nAnd notice down here in\nthe properties panel it says hey,\n\n355\n00:17:37.987 --> 00:17:40.210\nyou've made changes to the code\nto edit the selection.\n\n356\n00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.080\nPress Refresh or Press a five.\n\n357\n00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.680\nI'm gonna click this refresh button,\nand now it says yes.\n\n358\n00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.700\nThe tag selector says I'm in the label,\nand I'm starting to add some content here.\n\n359\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.360\nSo here's just some regular text content,\nand I have bold and italics and\n\n360\n00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.430\nI can do some other things with that.\n\n361\n00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:01.735\nSo if I just type in,\nin this case feedback form.\n\n362\n00:18:01.735 --> 00:18:04.640\nAnd again, typing is good, Okay, okay.\n\n363\n00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.146\nAnd I'm going to now hit Enter.\n\n364\n00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:13.718\nCool, so\nnow I'm going to add another field, and\n\n365\n00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:17.538\nthe next field I'm going to add is for\nmy first name last name.\n\n366\n00:18:17.538 --> 00:18:18.750\nSo it's gonna be first name.\n\n367\n00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.990\nAnd so now that I've done that,\n\n368\n00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.460\nnotice that the text field\ncomes with its own label.\n\n369\n00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.000\nSo I didn't have to add the label first.\n\n370\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.860\nSo even though we have a label field\nthat you can add within your design.\n\n371\n00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.850\nYou don't have to add it for every single\nform field that you're gonna be including.\n\n372\n00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.278\nIt should come with a label automatically.\n\n373\n00:18:37.278 --> 00:18:40.370\nSo I'm gonna select the text field and\ntype in first name,\n\n374\n00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:45.440\nlet me try to spell that right cuz I\ntend to do capital letters consistently.\n\n375\n00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.550\nNow I'm going to go to the end of that,\nput my cursor at the end, hit enter and\n\n376\n00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.602\nnow I'll do another text field for\nthe last name.\n\n377\n00:18:55.166 --> 00:18:57.723\nAnd I can use CSS to style it so\nthat whether side by side and\n\n378\n00:18:57.723 --> 00:19:00.300\nthat kind of thing but\nI'm gonna do top to bottom for now.\n\n379\n00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.000\nGo to the end and I'm gonna hit enter.\n\n380\n00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.535\nNow I would like the email address.\n\n381\n00:19:08.535 --> 00:19:11.500\nAnd that came up with email, I didn't have\nto change anything in the label there.\n\n382\n00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.390\nGo to the end, hit Enter.\n\n383\n00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:21.690\nSo at this point, I think I'd like to have\nthe feedback that they wanna provide us.\n\n384\n00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.100\nSo I think I'm gonna do an area here.\n\n385\n00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:29.071\nWe're gonna do a field set, and\nI'm gonna call this Feedback.\n\n386\n00:19:33.429 --> 00:19:40.010\nAnd now I'm going to place the text area\ninside of there, so here's the text area.\n\n387\n00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.530\nAnd literally I'm gonna scroll down so\nyou can see that.\n\n388\n00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.540\nNow notice how different the text area is.\n\n389\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:51.860\nThe text area is multi-gate line, and\nthe text field is only single line.\n\n390\n00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.540\nSo the text area is good for\nmulti-line information.\n\n391\n00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.490\nSo, I've got that label\nalready at the top.\n\n392\n00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.080\nI don't need a label here to the left, so\nI could remove this label right here and\n\n393\n00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.700\njust deal with the label that's up there.\n\n394\n00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.990\nSo, that's my feedback area, okay.\n\n395\n00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.065\nSo the next thing I'd like\nto do is I would like to add\n\n396\n00:20:09.065 --> 00:20:13.190\na radio button that if\nthey click on it and\n\n397\n00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.705\nthen it will allow oops, and\nI forgot to hit Enter so let me undo that.\n\n398\n00:20:16.705 --> 00:20:21.325\nAnd I'm gonna do a CTRL+Z on a PC here,\nCMD + Z on a Mac, then hit Enter.\n\n399\n00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:26.308\nAnd I'm gonna add a radio button and\nwe're gonna say check this or\n\n400\n00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:29.486\nselect this if you want us to contact you.\n\n401\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.153\nAnd the reason why I'm doing that is so\n\n402\n00:20:38.153 --> 00:20:42.970\nIf they check it then we will contact\nthem based on their feedback.\n\n403\n00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.830\nIf they don't check it then we'll just\nleave it that they just wanted to\n\n404\n00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.350\npass on some information in some way.\n\n405\n00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.830\nSelect this if you want us to contact you.\n\n406\n00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.180\nOkay, so, we have a couple of fields\nhere that we're working with.\n\n407\n00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.790\nAnd I think at this point we can look\nat the styling of each of these fields.\n\n408\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.120\nSo, I'm gonna start here with\nthe first field, the first name, and\n\n409\n00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.890\nif I look at the properties it's\nspecific to that text field.\n\n410\n00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.900\nSo there's a whole bunch going on here.\n\n411\n00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.330\nThe first thing called the text field,\nand I'd like to change that.\n\n412\n00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.480\nBecause in the future, when I receive this\nvia email, it's gonna say text field.\n\n413\n00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.980\nAnd that's not gonna be descriptive\nof what the data is that follows.\n\n414\n00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.730\nSo instead I should have something\nthat represents what this data is.\n\n415\n00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:27.330\nAgain, if I go with naming conventions,\nusually Fname represents the first name.\n\n416\n00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.190\nNow, I could type in the full\nword first and that kinda thing,\n\n417\n00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.160\nbut again you can use\nwhatever convention you want.\n\n418\n00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.200\nSo as long as you know FName is always\ngonna be first name that'll work.\n\n419\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.380\nI can apply any class style to that.\n\n420\n00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:44.640\nI can specify the size or how much\ntext I'm going to allow in that field.\n\n421\n00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.510\nSo, if I test it later on and\nI find that I can't type in my\n\n422\n00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.870\nfirst name cuz it's too small,\nI can increase the size.\n\n423\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.840\nOr maybe I wanna say you can only\ngive me 50 characters here so\n\n424\n00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.692\nthat way I can kind of guarantee that\nit's not gonna be fake information.\n\n425\n00:22:00.692 --> 00:22:05.530\nAll right, and I think for the max length\non the name I'm going to do 25 characters.\n\n426\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.960\nNow, I could put a value\nin there right now.\n\n427\n00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.490\nAnd the value could be something to\nthe effect of what I'm looking for, and\n\n428\n00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:12.910\njust to guide them into what I want.\n\n429\n00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.910\nSo if I type in a value here and\nI say hello for example, and I hit tab,\n\n430\n00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.280\nit's gonna write that in the field.\n\n431\n00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.520\nNow they'll have to click in here and\nreplace it, so\n\n432\n00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.060\nI really don't wanna do that, right.\n\n433\n00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.100\nSo, I do wanna click on that field and\nI wanna remove that.\n\n434\n00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.380\nSo, right here I'm gonna remove hello.\n\n435\n00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:35.700\nTitle, again, so the title allows me to\nput some accessibility into this design.\n\n436\n00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.870\nAnd it also allows them, if they hover\nover it, I'm gonna give them a message.\n\n437\n00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:42.960\nI'm gonna say Please\ntype in your first name.\n\n438\n00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.710\nSo if somebody who's\nhearing this comes to this,\n\n439\n00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.366\nthey'll know, it's the first name\nthat needs to go into this box.\n\n440\n00:22:48.366 --> 00:22:50.834\nVery important.\n\n441\n00:22:50.834 --> 00:22:55.350\nNow place, allows us to put\nsome placeholder text inside of\n\n442\n00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.700\nthe field to guide the user for\nthe information we're looking for.\n\n443\n00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.542\nSo, whatever I type in here is\ngonna be sort of grayed out, but\n\n444\n00:23:01.542 --> 00:23:05.005\nit will guide the user, when they\nclick it will automatically disappear.\n\n445\n00:23:05.005 --> 00:23:10.051\nSo I could put in here insert first\nname here, and when I tab out of it or\n\n446\n00:23:10.051 --> 00:23:14.930\nyou will probably won't see it until\nI do live view or design view.\n\n447\n00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.130\nSo let me try live view here.\n\n448\n00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.430\nAnd if I scroll down, there it is.\n\n449\n00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.260\nInsert first name here,\nand there's that text.\n\n450\n00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.140\nI'm going back to design view.\n\n451\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.300\nOkay, so that's the first name,\nand that's the first top section.\n\n452\n00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.545\nNow we have this bottom section for\nproperties as well.\n\n453\n00:23:28.545 --> 00:23:32.995\nI I could disable this field so for\nwhatever reason I might say okay I'm not\n\n454\n00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:35.586\ngonna allow people to\nenter anything in here.\n\n455\n00:23:35.586 --> 00:23:38.380\nBut this one is important I can make it so\nit's required.\n\n456\n00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.136\nBy checking this box I can literally\nforce them to give it to me and\n\n457\n00:23:41.136 --> 00:23:43.994\nif they don't give it to me,\nthere will be a message from the form,\n\n458\n00:23:43.994 --> 00:23:46.622\nit will come up say,hey,\nyou didn't give me what I wanted.\n\n459\n00:23:46.622 --> 00:23:48.272\nSome input required there.\n\n460\n00:23:48.272 --> 00:23:48.815\nAuto complete.\n\n461\n00:23:48.815 --> 00:23:51.726\nAgain, if they've been filling out\nforms and they come to your site.\n\n462\n00:23:51.726 --> 00:23:53.123\nAnd they fill out this form again,\n\n463\n00:23:53.123 --> 00:23:56.168\nit might give you an opportunity to put\nyour name in again under this field.\n\n464\n00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:57.630\nAutofocus.\n\n465\n00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.244\nNow, for\npeople who like to use the keyboard,\n\n466\n00:24:00.244 --> 00:24:03.150\nfocus means you are tapping\ninto that field.\n\n467\n00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.720\nAnd so, instantly that's the field\nthat's going to get the photos.\n\n468\n00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.400\nSo if you want, you can make this the\nfield that becomes the primary field when\n\n469\n00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.900\nsomebody comes to this form,\n\n470\n00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.190\nwhich is not a bad idea because it just\nmeans I'll be able to start typing.\n\n471\n00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.140\nRead only, read only means that,\nagain, it's sort of like disabled,\n\n472\n00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.880\nyou can't fill it in,\nit's only providing you information.\n\n473\n00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.320\nSo, for example, if somebody clicks on\nyour site and they're trying to fill out\n\n474\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.930\na password reset form, you might show\nthem what their current username is and\n\n475\n00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:36.370\nor you might show them something else\nthat's part of your database, and so\n\n476\n00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.910\nthat would mean it's read only,\nthey can't edit it in any way, but\n\n477\n00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.420\nthey can see what the data is.\n\n478\n00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.840\nNow if I keep going to the right here,\nI can see form,\n\n479\n00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.470\nI can see that this is part of the contact\nform, and I can add a pattern.\n\n480\n00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.140\nNow this would be for things like\na phone number, it would be for\n\n481\n00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.140\na social security number,\nIt would be for email address.\n\n482\n00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.450\nSo those you could force\na pattern in there.\n\n483\n00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:01.450\nThere's a whole set of websites that you\ncould Google that teach you how to build\n\n484\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.570\npatterns within Dreamweaver,\nso you can fill that in.\n\n485\n00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:11.210\nTab index is important because as you Tab\nthrough the form using the keyboard you\n\n486\n00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.400\nTab through, this would be our number 1,\nand I'd want to set that as number 1.\n\n487\n00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:21.340\nAnd I got this cut off here,\nI see a list item, and this is not a list.\n\n488\n00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.320\nSo I'm not going to do anything with that,\nbut I do wanna collapse this down just so\n\n489\n00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:24.930\nI can make sure, yeah.\n\n490\n00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:28.840\nSo if I grab the pull down here for list,\nI don't have any kind of list values yet.\n\n491\n00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.150\nSo this is not a list,\n\n492\n00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:34.660\nit is just my ability to put the name in,\nAand I'm asking for an input.\n\n493\n00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.560\nSo that is a text field.\n\n494\n00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.387\nNow I'm going to have to\ndo last name as well, so\n\n495\n00:25:38.387 --> 00:25:41.020\nI'm going to click on that last name here.\n\n496\n00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.640\nAnd again, text field two, in this case.\n\n497\n00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:49.050\nWell, that's not very descriptive,\nso I'm going to do lname,\n\n498\n00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.140\nor you could write in last name or\nwhatever you want.\n\n499\n00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.060\nAgain, I'm going to specify now\nbecause last names tend to be much\n\n500\n00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.560\nlarger than first names, I'm going\nto allow 50 characters in this one.\n\n501\n00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.880\nThe title for this,\nthat's going to be the ScreenTip and\n\n502\n00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.798\nthe screen readers are going to hear.\n\n503\n00:26:01.798 --> 00:26:04.270\nIt's going to be please type in in\n\n504\n00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.670\nyour last name, and\nspell name correctly here.\n\n505\n00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.040\nThere we go.\n\n506\n00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:20.528\nHere, the placeholder,\nI could say insert last name here.\n\n507\n00:26:20.528 --> 00:26:23.520\nI'm batting 1,000.\n\n508\n00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.100\nAnd I don't remember if I did all\nlower case on the other guy, so\n\n509\n00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.950\nI'm going to do lower case here.\n\n510\n00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.660\nLast name, you want to be consistent.\n\n511\n00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.520\nAnd here again,\nI'm going to make this a required field.\n\n512\n00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.240\nI am not going to give it autofocus\nbecause the autofocus is going to go to\n\n513\n00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.470\nthe first name.\n\n514\n00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:43.170\nIt doesn't need a pattern,\nit's related to the form we're using.\n\n515\n00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.800\nThe second tab index, and\nthere is no list for this.\n\n516\n00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.670\nAll right, email.\n\n517\n00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.160\nNow, email, it's literally going\nto look for the at symbol.\n\n518\n00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.130\nIt's going to look to make sure there's\na dot in there, so they have to give you\n\n519\n00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:58.570\na proper domain, they have to\ngive you a proper email address.\n\n520\n00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.060\nSo again, I go through some settings,\nI can set a max length.\n\n521\n00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:02.950\nYou know what?\n\n522\n00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.840\nI can't predict what somebody's domain\nmight be or somebody's user name might be,\n\n523\n00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.420\nso I'm not even going to attempt\nto get me a max length here, but\n\n524\n00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:16.640\nI will add my title, which is going to\nbe please type in your email address.\n\n525\n00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.160\nAnd then the placeholder,\nI could give them a sample,\n\n526\n00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:26.560\nI could say sample@sample.com,\nfor example.\n\n527\n00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:33.560\nThis is a required field, and, everything\nelse here, tab index is number three.\n\n528\n00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.790\nAnd it's the fact that it's\nan email should automatically\n\n529\n00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.550\nvalidate against email addresses.\n\n530\n00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.250\nThe feedback text area,\nlittle bit different.\n\n531\n00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:48.131\nText area here,\nI'm going to give this a name,\n\n532\n00:27:48.131 --> 00:27:52.282\nwe're going to call this our feedback,\n\n533\n00:27:52.282 --> 00:27:57.340\nlower case to maintain my consistency.\n\n534\n00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.840\nNow, number of rows and\ncolumns you're going to allow.\n\n535\n00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.200\nSo, am I going to allow multiple rows?\n\n536\n00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.350\nUsually up to five rows, for example.\n\n537\n00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.040\nI'm not going to put a max length.\n\n538\n00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.550\nNotice as I chose five rows, it increased\nthe height of the field, and that's great.\n\n539\n00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.860\nAnd the text wrap says default,\nhard, or soft.\n\n540\n00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.495\nAnd basically, it'll give you\nhard returns or soft returns.\n\n541\n00:28:17.495 --> 00:28:21.805\nAnd basically a soft return is where it\nmoves the date to the second line, but\n\n542\n00:28:21.805 --> 00:28:24.265\nit doesn't really break it.\n\n543\n00:28:24.265 --> 00:28:27.525\nHard return means once you get to the end,\nit creates a separate line, but\n\n544\n00:28:27.525 --> 00:28:29.920\nit's going to give you a hard\nbreak at that second line.\n\n545\n00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.860\nOkay, so\nit's just going to be the default here.\n\n546\n00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.780\nValue, again, I don't want anything.\n\n547\n00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.391\nTitle, this is please\nprovide us your feedback.\n\n548\n00:28:42.748 --> 00:28:47.450\nYour feedback.\n\n549\n00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.030\nAnd I apologize my screen\nresolution is making it so\n\n550\n00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.010\nyou can't see the entire field again.\n\n551\n00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.820\nLet's stretch that out.\n\n552\n00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.810\nSo please provide us your feedback,\nand the placeholder is going to be\n\n553\n00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:01.250\na 'Type feedback' here.\n\n554\n00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.520\nAnd then, this is a required field?\n\n555\n00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.210\nNot really, they can give us\nfeedback if they want, however,\n\n556\n00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:09.220\nif they fill out this form and\nthey don't give us this information,\n\n557\n00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.978\nthey're giving us their email address for\nfree, and that's fine.\n\n558\n00:29:12.978 --> 00:29:17.630\nAgain, disabled auto-focus, read only,\ndon't need any of that, tab index at this\n\n559\n00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.180\npoint is number four, and then we're\non the last item, the radio button.\n\n560\n00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:27.108\nSo I'm going to click on the radio button,\nselect it, and now you can see here,\n\n561\n00:29:27.108 --> 00:29:32.084\nthe name of this is radio, again,\nI'm going to say contact user.\n\n562\n00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.720\nAnd no spaces, user.\n\n563\n00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.390\nAnd again, I can make it so\nit's checked by default.\n\n564\n00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:50.760\nSo if I want them to automatically\nsay yes for contact,\n\n565\n00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.110\nselect this if you want us to contact you.\n\n566\n00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:56.650\nThis checkbox automatically puts\nthe blue dot in the center so\n\n567\n00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.650\nthat means yes we will contact\nyou unless you take this off.\n\n568\n00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.260\nSo you're opting them in or\nyou're opting them out.\n\n569\n00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.600\nIn this case,\nI don't think I want to check this.\n\n570\n00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.050\nI want them to have to opt in so\n\n571\n00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.650\nthey specifically have to request\nthat we're going to contact them.\n\n572\n00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:13.692\nOtherwise we'd be contacting everybody,\neven though they don't want to.\n\n573\n00:30:13.692 --> 00:30:18.779\nThe value is a radio button, the title is\n\n574\n00:30:18.779 --> 00:30:23.580\ngoing to be select if you wish\n\n575\n00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:29.002\na response from us.\n\n576\n00:30:29.002 --> 00:30:31.464\nOkay?\n\n577\n00:30:31.464 --> 00:30:36.870\nAgain, disabled required auto focus.\n\n578\n00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.420\nWhat form are we going to apply this to?\n\n579\n00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.270\nAnd then this is the last number five.\n\n580\n00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:44.030\nOkay, and of course I have\nforgotten to add my buttons.\n\n581\n00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:48.510\nSo I want to go to the end here and\nI've got my submit button, and\n\n582\n00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.510\nthen right to the right of that,\nI'm going to put my reset button.\n\n583\n00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:56.260\nSo this will allow them to submit the form\nand it will allow them to reset the form.\n\n584\n00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.260\nRight.\nSo this one,\n\n585\n00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.740\nI think I'm ready to just to\ntest the bare bones form here.\n\n586\n00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:06.740\nAnd if I go into F12 to preview this in my\nbrowser, I can literally test this out.\n\n587\n00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.410\nSo, here's my form with all of its fields.\n\n588\n00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.150\nOkay, and I can use CSS styling\nhere to fix all of this.\n\n589\n00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.810\nBut it says insert first name here,\ninsert last name here.\n\n590\n00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:18.350\nIt says, you can look at my screen tips,\nit's giving me all that information.\n\n591\n00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.980\nAll right, so let me put some\ninformation here just to test it.\n\n592\n00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.950\nJim Searles, and my email.\n\n593\n00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.980\nI'm going to leave the email address\nblank just to show you what happens.\n\n594\n00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:35.880\nI'm going to say thank you for\nhelping us out.\n\n595\n00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:41.000\nAnd I'm not going to check that,\nbut if I hit submit\n\n596\n00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.680\nit should not allow it to happen,\nit says please fill out this field.\n\n597\n00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.653\nSo by making it mandatory,\nit's giving me that information.\n\n598\n00:31:46.653 --> 00:31:50.675\nNow I'm going to make a mistake, I'm not\ngoing to give a proper email address, so\n\n599\n00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:53.672\nI'm going to say jimbo and\nI'm going to say at, the word at.\n\n600\n00:31:53.672 --> 00:31:56.825\nAnd I'm going to say jimbo.com,\nfor example.\n\n601\n00:31:56.825 --> 00:32:00.175\nIt's not an appropriate email address,\nso I'm gonna hit Submit again, and\n\n602\n00:32:00.175 --> 00:32:02.660\nit says Please include an @\nsymbol in the email address.\n\n603\n00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.800\nSo it is testing the information\nto make sure it's provided here.\n\n604\n00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.070\nSo that validation is completely doing\nits job, and this is part of HTML5.\n\n605\n00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.470\nCuz I will tell you,\nbefore HTML5, I had to go in,\n\n606\n00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:18.280\nafter creating the fields, and I would\nhave to select JavaScript validation.\n\n607\n00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.870\nSo it was a whole separate step and\nprocess for every single field.\n\n608\n00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:23.510\nBut now, it's working great.\n\n609\n00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:26.400\nAnd I spelled Jimbo wrong here,\nbut that's okay.\n\n610\n00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.230\nAnd then I go over here, and\nI say, yeah, you can contact me.\n\n611\n00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.859\nI'll hit Submit.\n\n612\n00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:36.030\nInstantly it's going to hit submitted,\nit should've send out the email.\n\n613\n00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.890\nThere it is,\nit's trying to open my Outlook.\n\n614\n00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:40.690\nAnd there's the email with\nmy information in it.\n\n615\n00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:44.030\nAnd all of this good stuff is\ncoming up because it's Outlook.\n\n616\n00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:48.860\nBut at this point, I'm not sure\nwhat's going on with this guy.\n\n617\n00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.120\nBut there's my information.\n\n618\n00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.275\nJim, last name was Searles,\nemail is jimbo@jimbo.com,\n\n619\n00:32:54.275 --> 00:32:56.950\nfeedback is thank you for helping us.\n\n620\n00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:57.770\nAnd there you are.\n\n621\n00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.670\nSo we have all of that\ninformation based on this.\n\n622\n00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.450\nAnd I'm not sure why this is stuck.\n\n623\n00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:03.700\nThere we go.\n\n624\n00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.500\nGoodness gracious.\n\n625\n00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.700\nAnd my submit was equals to submit.\n\n626\n00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.490\nMy contact user was the radio button,\nso that's the value.\n\n627\n00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.420\nI should have charged the value there,\nso that's something I want to go change.\n\n628\n00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:20.960\nSo where it said the value for the radio\nbutton, I could say, please contact me.\n\n629\n00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.870\nThis will let us know that\nthey do wanna be contacted.\n\n630\n00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:28.620\nSo if they select it,\nthat's what gonna say.\n\n631\n00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:33.060\nSo now, if I hit Tab on this and\nI preview it again.\n\n632\n00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:39.160\nI go through my fields, and notice it's\nnot gonna auto populate my information.\n\n633\n00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.500\nWell I guess it is auto populating.\n\n634\n00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.290\nI guess I didn't tell it not to.\n\n635\n00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.610\nMaybe this is something\non the browser level.\n\n636\n00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.876\nGonna have to see what's going on there.\n\n637\n00:33:46.876 --> 00:33:49.252\nBut here's my information.\n\n638\n00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:56.910\nAnd lastly, feedback, thank you!\n\n639\n00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.800\nSelect this, now I hit the Submit form.\n\n640\n00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:03.770\nHopefully I don't blow up Outlook again,\nand all those messages that we got.\n\n641\n00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:08.810\nAnd there it is.\n\n642\n00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.220\nNow it says,\nplease contact me instead of radio.\n\n643\n00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:16.210\nSo basically, now I know that they\nwanna be contacted in that sense, okay.\n\n644\n00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:20.180\nSo this is the email that's going to\nget sent when the form is completed.\n\n645\n00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:26.400\nAnd so there we have a HTML5 form\nwithin our design, using all\n\n646\n00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:31.230\nof the HTML5 configuration settings that\nwe have available inside of Dreamweaver.\n\n647\n00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.620\n>> All right, thank you very much.\n\n648\n00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:38.480\nA lot of intricate pieces there, Jim, but\nI appreciate you explaining it for us.\n\n649\n00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.683\nDo you have any other\nwords before we sign off?\n\n650\n00:34:41.683 --> 00:34:45.043\n>> Sure, just keep in mind\nwhen you're completing a form,\n\n651\n00:34:45.043 --> 00:34:49.320\nagain, the bare bones that you need\nis first name, last name and email.\n\n652\n00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.920\nAnd then you need a submit button and\na reset button.\n\n653\n00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.490\nVery important, all of the other fields\nthat we talked about are not mandatory,\n\n654\n00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:59.720\nthey're optional.\n\n655\n00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.060\nBut you'll want to make your first name,\nyour last name, your email as required\n\n656\n00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.370\nfields, and then you'll want to have\nthe submit and reset button on every form.\n\n657\n00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.470\n>> All right,\nwell we appreciate that information,\n\n658\n00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.220\nappreciate you being here with us,\nand we appreciate you the viewer.\n\n659\n00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.400\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n660\n00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.270\n>> And I'm Jim Searles.\n\n661\n00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:16.317\n>> And we'll see you next

Bryan,\n\n3\n00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:19.060\nand we're continuing along in\nour series in Dreamweaver.\n\n4\n00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.480\nThat's right, we're coming back with\nmore of the Creative Cloud 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.390\nIn this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.320\nwe're going to be focusing in\non the principles of web design.\n\n7\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.150\nJoining me back in the studios again\nis none other than Mr. Jim Seros.\n\n8\n00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.310\nJim, how you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.370\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\nthank you for having me back, and\n\n10\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.990\nthank you to the ITProTV team for\nhaving me as well.\n\n11\n00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.300\nSo we can talk about Dreamweaver, however,\n\n12\n00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.650\nin this instance we're not going to be\ntalking about Dreamweaver as much as we're\n\n13\n00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.170\ngoing to be talking about\nthe principles of design.\n\n14\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.580\nAnd for the purpose of understanding\nhow to build a web page,\n\n15\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.460\nwe're going to do a PowerPoint\npresentation outside of the applications\n\n16\n00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.870\nthat we're going to talk about layout and\nsymmetry and that kind of thing.\n\n17\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.060\nSo I'd like to dive into my\nPowerPoint presentation and\n\n18\n00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.850\ntalk about the principles of design.\n\n19\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.040\nBasically, a well designed website\nfacilitates easy navigation through web\n\n20\n00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.530\npages for\naccessing the relevant information.\n\n21\n00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.360\nNow we've talked about this before,\nhow our design must be clean.\n\n22\n00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.850\nIt must be user friendly.\n\n23\n00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.430\nYou're going to have this focus\non the user at all times.\n\n24\n00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.970\nAnd we're going to discuss\nsome concepts in a little bit\n\n25\n00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.450\nabout who your target audience is,\nand what it is that you're looking for\n\n26\n00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.590\nwhen you're designing this information.\n\n27\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.380\nSo, let's dive into that.\n\n28\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.540\nSo the first part is to look at some\nguidelines for the design principles.\n\n29\n00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.910\nWe need to ask some questions to\ndetermine the purpose of our site.\n\n30\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.640\nWho is going to be coming to our site?\n\n31\n00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.710\nIs it a specialty site?\n\n32\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.070\nAre we going to design a blog?\n\n33\n00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.760\nAre we going to design\nsomething that's informational?\n\n34\n00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.905\nAre we going to interact\nwith our users in some way?\n\n35\n00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:48.325\nAre we going to need a forum, or some\nother pieces that might come into this?\n\n36\n00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:51.905\nSo the purpose of the site will\nhelp drive the design forward.\n\n37\n00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:54.835\nSo it's something you should consider\nright before you even sit in front\n\n38\n00:01:54.835 --> 00:01:57.315\nof Dreamweaver, and you start designing.\n\n39\n00:01:57.315 --> 00:02:00.340\nIdentify the target audience,\nwho will be visiting the site?\n\n40\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.260\nAre they predominantly\ngoing to be carpenters?\n\n41\n00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.320\nAre they going to be technical people?\n\n42\n00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.180\nAre they going to be people\nwho are purchasing shoes?\n\n43\n00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.440\nWhatever the purpose is,\nyou've got to say who is this audience?\n\n44\n00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.108\nBecause, for example, if you're going\nto gear it towards men, their gender,\n\n45\n00:02:16.108 --> 00:02:20.502\nyou might want to have some neutral\ntones in there, some Earth tone colors,\n\n46\n00:02:20.502 --> 00:02:21.936\nthat kind of thing.\n\n47\n00:02:21.936 --> 00:02:22.900\nIf you're going to do it for\n\n48\n00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.160\nwomen, you might want to have colors\nthat are more appealing to them.\n\n49\n00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.910\nYou might have designs that\nare appealing to them.\n\n50\n00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.100\nSo that whole idea changes how\nyour site is going to go and\n\n51\n00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.540\nwhat you're going to do on the site.\n\n52\n00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.200\nIt might even change some of\nthe content that you're going to allow.\n\n53\n00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.480\nWe might have more demonstration videos\nif it is going to be one target audience.\n\n54\n00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.810\nAnd it may have more\naudio demonstrations or\n\n55\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.225\nwritten demonstrations based on\nthe different type of audience.\n\n56\n00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:53.660\nS,o very good points to make are who's the\ntarget audience and what are the purpose?\n\n57\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.220\nThe next part is to organize the content\nof the site so it's logical, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.650\nYou've got to have that banner at\nthe top that brands your information.\n\n59\n00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.100\nYou've got to have the navigation bar,\nclear and concise and easy to find, and\n\n60\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.640\nyou've got to have the content.\n\n61\n00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.090\nThe main content sections available and\n\n62\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.110\npresenting the information in\na way that makes a lot of sense.\n\n63\n00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.900\nSo organization,\nalso the structure, right?\n\n64\n00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.150\nSo, we want to have some balance and\n\n65\n00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.930\nmake sure that it's going to meet\nthe need of what we're trying to deliver.\n\n66\n00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.020\nCreate a layout, an outline or\n\n67\n00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.580\na site diagram that might make your\nnavigation easier and user friendly.\n\n68\n00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.360\nYour design for\nyour navigation is completely different\n\n69\n00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.060\nif you're going to be designing for people\non a browser on a computer, then it is for\n\n70\n00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.480\nsomebody who's going to be on\na mobile device, for example.\n\n71\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.120\nSo you're going to have touch\ninputs on the mobile devices,\n\n72\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.870\nwhereas on the computer, you're going to\nhave mice and keyboard interactivity.\n\n73\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.690\nSo that needs to be taken into\nconsideration when you design.\n\n74\n00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.870\nSo when we talk about using a site\ndiagram, you can use that later on\n\n75\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.910\nas a site map usually listed somewhere\nin the footer of your web pages.\n\n76\n00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.580\nBut the point is these will help make\nthe design better for everyone and\n\n77\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.070\nbetter for your user.\n\n78\n00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.960\nAnd that's the point, is to reach that\nuser in a way that they feel comfortable,\n\n79\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.000\nand to make sure that the information\nthat they're looking for\n\n80\n00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.660\nis easy for them to access.\n\n81\n00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.350\nStandardize the text format for\nthe webpage.\n\n82\n00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.530\nNow, we talked about the two different\ntypes of thoughts within design.\n\n83\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.920\nTypography, we talk about serif fonts and\nsans serif fonts.\n\n84\n00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.010\nWell, designed to the least\ncommon denominator,\n\n85\n00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.730\nSerif fonts are always to\nread if the text is small,\n\n86\n00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.820\nSans Serif fonts are always easy\nto read when the text is small,\n\n87\n00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.090\nSerif fonts are better to read when the\ntext is large, and they look more formal.\n\n88\n00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.470\nSo if you are going to be\ncreating a lawyer site,\n\n89\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.700\nthey do a lot of Time New Roman in their\nforms and in their legal documents.\n\n90\n00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.330\nSo you might want to bring that\ninto the design of the website.\n\n91\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.730\nBut you want to use it sparingly, because\nif people are going to have to read a lot\n\n92\n00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.630\nof content on the site,\nyou might want to use a Sans Serif font.\n\n93\n00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.360\nSo even standardizing what types\nof fonts that you're going to use,\n\n94\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.480\nis it going to be Garamond, is it going to\nbe is it going to be, you know, Calibri?\n\n95\n00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.170\nThat makes sense, you're the one that\nkeep from one font to the next that every\n\n96\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.890\nparagraph, that's going to make things\nvery confusing to the reader and\n\n97\n00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.620\nit's going to distract them for no reason.\n\n98\n00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.120\nAnd then lastly, provide support for\nbetter user interactivity.\n\n99\n00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.720\nSo using contact forms to be able to\nreceive feedback, finding a way for\n\n100\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.625\nthe person to reach out to you.\n\n101\n00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:29.415\nThere is all this different\nkinds of methodologies.\n\n102\n00:05:29.415 --> 00:05:33.275\nAdd your Facebook page to that,\nadd a link for Twitter so\n\n103\n00:05:33.275 --> 00:05:36.705\nthey can give you a feed and\nadd some content there.\n\n104\n00:05:36.705 --> 00:05:39.790\nBut you want to be able to\ninteract with the user in a way\n\n105\n00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.930\nthat they feel confident,\nthat they're going to get a response, and\n\n106\n00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.860\nthey feel comfortable providing\nyou that feedback and information.\n\n107\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.210\nSo, the target audience.\n\n108\n00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.780\nOne of the most important factors to be\nclearly defined before designing a website\n\n109\n00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.710\nis the target audience.\n\n110\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.720\nThis is primarily the group that\nthe site is to be designed to appeal to.\n\n111\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.610\nSo, can't stress that enough.\n\n112\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.220\nWho is your target audience?\n\n113\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.740\nIt's going to drive the design,\n\n114\n00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.700\nit is going to drive it in\nways that you didn't expect.\n\n115\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.090\nFor example,\nwe all know about Instagram, and\n\n116\n00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.400\nInstagram is mainly\na mobile device platform.\n\n117\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.330\nYou can't access it on the web\nif you're using a browser.\n\n118\n00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.000\nAs a matter of fact,\nyou go to the website, it says hey,\n\n119\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.930\nclick here to download our app.\n\n120\n00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.409\nSo they know that their target\naudience is a mobile audience.\n\n121\n00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.490\nBut, you have audiences\nthat live in both worlds.\n\n122\n00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.440\nIf that's not your target audience,\nthen you want to be able to accommodate\n\n123\n00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.440\nwherever they are and\nyou want to be able to reach them.\n\n124\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.240\nWe discussed gender,\nwe discussed different careers,\n\n125\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.930\nwe discussed people with different\nskill sets of understanding, so\n\n126\n00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.680\nyou want to reach them on whatever level.\n\n127\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.290\nA person going to Walmart is different\nthan a person going into a tech blog.\n\n128\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.840\nAnd in the sense that they're looking for\ndifferent information, and\n\n129\n00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.395\nyou're reaching people that are not\nnecessarily techie on Walmart,\n\n130\n00:06:55.395 --> 00:06:58.920\nwhereas on the tech blog, they're\ndefinitely going to have something,\n\n131\n00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.700\nsome kind of base knowledge,\nand that's why they're there.\n\n132\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.110\nThey wouldn't have found the blog to\nbegin with if they didn't have some kind\n\n133\n00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.754\nof tech knowledge.\n\n134\n00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:11.880\nAlso, the content on your site should\nbe relevant for the target audience.\n\n135\n00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.130\nSo we talked about\nconsistency within your text.\n\n136\n00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.590\nIf you're going to include audio,\n\n137\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.810\nif you're going to include video or\nany interactive elements.\n\n138\n00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.620\nThey should relate to\nthat target audience.\n\n139\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.700\nSo, see how the target audience\nwill drive the content and\n\n140\n00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.040\nthe design within your webpage,\nvery important.\n\n141\n00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.340\nSo think about those things when you're\nlooking at your target audience.\n\n142\n00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.770\nWill they accept frilly fonts or\n\n143\n00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.930\ncolors that are going to be vibrant?\n\n144\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.370\nWill they accept audio playing right\naway when you get to the site?\n\n145\n00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.330\nI will tell you that's one\nof my biggest pet peeves.\n\n146\n00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.058\nI was tempted to go turn off the audio\nbecause it's glaring at me on a song I\n\n147\n00:07:52.058 --> 00:07:53.600\ndidn't really care to hear.\n\n148\n00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.564\nOkay, the video, yeah.\n\n149\n00:07:54.564 --> 00:07:58.570\nShould I reach people with video,\nam I doing how to videos,\n\n150\n00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.990\nam I doing A video to sample a product or\nto demonstrate a product.\n\n151\n00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.970\nThose are some interesting and\nimportant pieces.\n\n152\n00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.620\nAnd then interactive elements,\nso how am I reaching them?\n\n153\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.440\nHow am I getting feedback from them?\n\n154\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.653\nAm I offering them opportunities to\ncommunicate with our organization?\n\n155\n00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:23.180\nDesign element considerations,\nso we have to have balance, and\n\n156\n00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.020\nwe have to emphasis, and\nwe have to use color.\n\n157\n00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.390\nSo when we talk about balances,\nyou want to talk about symmetry.\n\n158\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.060\nYou want to talk about making\nsure that it feels balanced.\n\n159\n00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.660\nEarlier, in one of our previous episodes,\nI took the site that we were working on\n\n160\n00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.540\nand I made sure that no\nmatter how I resized my page,\n\n161\n00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.280\nthe content was always in the center.\n\n162\n00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.000\nI made sure that when I added a table it\nwas in the center, or it gave some visual\n\n163\n00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.920\nrepresentation of being balanced in\nsome way, and that's very important.\n\n164\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.410\nSo your design should feel balanced.\n\n165\n00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.580\nAnd you can kind of tell a website is not\nbalanced when you get to it and there's\n\n166\n00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.740\nall this content on one side of the page,\nbut the rest of the page is blank.\n\n167\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.500\nNow some sites do that on purpose for\nemphasis, right?\n\n168\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.340\nYou can use these types of techniques for\nemphasis.\n\n169\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.350\nBecause you might wanna emphasize,\nmaybe the advertisement on the right that\n\n170\n00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:18.670\nis talking about purchasing tickets\nto go to some theme park, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.110\nSo you could do that.\n\n172\n00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.970\nIf that's your intent, then the balance is\nthe fact that you're now emphasizing that\n\n173\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.820\nproduct, but you've gotta keep that\nin mind when you're doing this.\n\n174\n00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.780\nNow we talk about emphasis, you might want\nto have some header ones on your webpage,\n\n175\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.700\nyou might wanna have something that draws\nthe reader's attention, a graphic or\n\n176\n00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.790\na video or something that brings them\nto that article that you've written.\n\n177\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.770\nAnd so emphasis is allowed.\n\n178\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:48.090\nWhat you can't do, and it used to happen\nin the old days, is have flashing text.\n\n179\n00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.160\nFirst of all,\nyou're messing with accessibility,\n\n180\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.020\npeople might be prone to seizures and\nthey might have problems, okay?\n\n181\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.230\nThere are other ways to do that.\n\n182\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.160\nColor could emphasize an item,\n\n183\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.940\nyou could highlight it with\na background color of some kind.\n\n184\n00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.340\nYou could make it so that way with the\nreader, as they're looking at the design,\n\n185\n00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.520\nmaybe there are arrows pointing in that\ndirection or something that you've\n\n186\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.950\nadded to the design that literally\ndraws them down into that area and\n\n187\n00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.830\nbrings them to what you're emphasizing.\n\n188\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.030\nSo that's some design\nelement considerations.\n\n189\n00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.400\nWhat do you want to emphasize?\n\n190\n00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.400\nWhere do you want the people to see?\n\n191\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:25.650\nHave you noticed on the web, where is\nthe logo for companies usually placed?\n\n192\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.680\nIn the upper left-hand corner,\n\n193\n00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.910\nbecause it's the first thing that\nwe as human beings in America read.\n\n194\n00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.050\nWe read left to right, and the upper\nleft-hand corner is where we start, and\n\n195\n00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.720\nwe move down the page.\n\n196\n00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.050\nSo the first thing you see is\nthe branding of the company, and\n\n197\n00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.530\nthat's what they're doing.\n\n198\n00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.210\nThey're figuring that out and\nthey're targeting that in your\n\n199\n00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.640\nconsciousness without even you\nthinking about it, so that's emphasis.\n\n200\n00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.200\nColor, I mentioned in previous\nepisodes that we bring color in,\n\n201\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.500\nusually from the logo.\n\n202\n00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.460\nSo if somebody has designed a brand,\nI wanna utilize that brand.\n\n203\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.940\nThey paid a lot of money to\nmake sure that the brand or\n\n204\n00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.920\nthey spent a lot of time with that\nbranding to make that happen.\n\n205\n00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.710\nA lot of advertising goes into a brand.\n\n206\n00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:07.200\nA lot goes on into that brand.\n\n207\n00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.030\nSo you wanna used that color scheme\nthat might be applicable to that brand.\n\n208\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.110\nAnd you wanna make sure that the color\nscheme that you use on the site\n\n209\n00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.490\nmatches that branding as well,\nin whatever way it complements it.\n\n210\n00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.380\nAnd make sure that it works well with it.\n\n211\n00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.170\nYou wouldn't use lime green, for example,\n\n212\n00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:27.270\nif somebody is neutral\ncolors inside of their logo.\n\n213\n00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.750\nIt just wouldn't work.\n\n214\n00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.710\nAnd the best examples that you can\nthink of when you think about color and\n\n215\n00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.970\nbranding, think about the major\norganizations that are out there.\n\n216\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.290\nIBM, I mean they've just got three\nbig capital letters, I, B, and M.\n\n217\n00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.840\nOr Apple, just got the solid white\napple on a black background.\n\n218\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.620\nOr Nike, you've got the swoosh,\nor the swish icon.\n\n219\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.450\nBut the point is,\nis they have thought about this a lot and\n\n220\n00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.560\nthey're gonna make sure that the design\non their sites match that branding.\n\n221\n00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.657\nSo color is important\nwhen you come to this.\n\n222\n00:11:58.657 --> 00:12:03.617\nAnd the three of these work together in\norder to bring the entire elements of\n\n223\n00:12:03.617 --> 00:12:06.780\nyour page, and\nmake it feel balanced and work.\n\n224\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:13.820\nSo, we have some elements that we\ncan use to improve site usability.\n\n225\n00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.250\nFirst of all, navigation.\n\n226\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.600\nWe talked about the fact that your\nnavigation should be clean and\n\n227\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.230\nconcise, it shouldn't\nhave a lot of clutter.\n\n228\n00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.690\nNo more than two words\nin your navigation and\n\n229\n00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.979\nthere should be no more than seven\nnavigable items within your navigation.\n\n230\n00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.440\nUse content that is clear and provides\nvisitors with the required information.\n\n231\n00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.290\nPeople are coming to your site because\nthey want information about whatever it is\n\n232\n00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.110\nyou're talking about.\n\n233\n00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.370\nIt could be bird watching,\nit could be surfing,\n\n234\n00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.230\nit could be I don't know, anything.\n\n235\n00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.290\nBut whatever it is, you wanna make\nsure that they get that information.\n\n236\n00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.660\nAnd it's easy to find and easy to read and\nclear and concise when they do get to it.\n\n237\n00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.540\nEnsure that all text content is\nchecked for spelling and grammar.\n\n238\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.990\nI can't tell you how much\nthis one's important.\n\n239\n00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.401\nWe gotta thank our content writers, our\ncopy writers, because they do a good job.\n\n240\n00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:04.030\nBut you've got to make sure that\neverything matches the reading level of\n\n241\n00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.052\nthe group of people coming to your site,\n\n242\n00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:08.566\nas well making sure\neverything is spell checked.\n\n243\n00:13:08.566 --> 00:13:12.644\nDreamweaver provides spell check\ncapability within the application, so\n\n244\n00:13:12.644 --> 00:13:16.141\nyou could spell check whatever\ndocuments you might link into and\n\n245\n00:13:16.141 --> 00:13:18.000\nbring into your design.\n\n246\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.330\nAnd I suggest you use it because even\nthough we think we might have spelled it\n\n247\n00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.310\ncorrectly, you might have\nmissed one at some point and\n\n248\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:24.890\nit's easy for us to do that.\n\n249\n00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.990\nSo, spell checking and\ngrammar is important.\n\n250\n00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.870\nUse images that are relevant.\n\n251\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.190\nSo, if I have a bird watching site,\n\n252\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:37.170\nI'm not going to put speed cars or\nracing cars on my site.\n\n253\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.110\nUnless of course,\nit's part of the advertising, but\n\n254\n00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.090\nthen you're not hitting\nmy target audience.\n\n255\n00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.880\nMy target audience is bird watching,\nso I might need binoculars,\n\n256\n00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.800\nI might need cameras,\nI might need sunhats,\n\n257\n00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.830\nI might need that equipment that I\nwould take out to go do bird watching.\n\n258\n00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.240\nI wouldn't necessarily want to talk\nabout speeding cars or racing cars or\n\n259\n00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:55.790\nthat kind of thing.\n\n260\n00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.590\nAs a matter of fact, you can tell I don't\neven know what the heck I'm talking about.\n\n261\n00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.730\nBut the point here is, is that you\nwant to make sure that the content is\n\n262\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.690\nrelevant to your audience and in some\nway is going to provide them value.\n\n263\n00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.401\nSo it's always gonna have\nsome value of some kind.\n\n264\n00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:11.380\nWe want to keep the layout and\nthe color consistent.\n\n265\n00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.160\nSo again, coming back to\nthe whole point of the logo,\n\n266\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.500\nwe want things to be\nconsistent within the design.\n\n267\n00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.440\nAnd you don't want to jump\nfrom one to the next.\n\n268\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.260\nSo for example,\nlet's say I am on my homepage and\n\n269\n00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.490\nmy background is a melon color orange.\n\n270\n00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:31.400\nAnd I go to the About Us page and\nall of a sudden I got fuschia everywhere.\n\n271\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.210\nThat might be jarring to the user and\nthey might be like,\n\n272\n00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.600\nwell, did I just leave the website\nI was on and enter something new?\n\n273\n00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.960\nSo you got to keep that in mind.\n\n274\n00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.639\nIt needs to be consistent across pages.\n\n275\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.950\nProvide options for users to search.\n\n276\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.720\nSo basically,\n\n277\n00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:52.960\nthe good thing about HTML5 is that one of\nthe form controls that it provides us, and\n\n278\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.290\nwe discussed this in a previous episode,\nis that it provides you a search option.\n\n279\n00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.050\nAnd you can put that anywhere in your\ndesign, usually it's at the top,\n\n280\n00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.940\nwhere people can find it,\nand they can type in and\n\n281\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.050\ninstantly get to that\ninformation they're looking for.\n\n282\n00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:08.580\nEspecially if you're running a blog site\nor something that's going to provide\n\n283\n00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.490\narticles of information, so\nthey want to get to that real quick.\n\n284\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.940\nAllow for feedback, Contact Us page,\nvery useful for that kind of thing.\n\n285\n00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:21.019\nSo you can grab the information from\nthe user and maybe improve your design or\n\n286\n00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:24.971\nimprove the content that you have\navailable to those users that are trying\n\n287\n00:15:24.971 --> 00:15:25.624\nto find it.\n\n288\n00:15:25.624 --> 00:15:29.377\nAnd can't stress this\nlast bullet item enough.\n\n289\n00:15:29.377 --> 00:15:32.508\nTest before launching, okay?\n\n290\n00:15:32.508 --> 00:15:37.448\nWe've talked in previous episodes that you\nshould have as many browsers installed in\n\n291\n00:15:37.448 --> 00:15:41.979\nyour development environment as possible\nbecause you should test them across\n\n292\n00:15:41.979 --> 00:15:46.852\nthose browsers to see the differences,\nto find the nuances, to change the colors,\n\n293\n00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:51.243\nto change the design, and make sure\nthat it meets what you're expecting for\n\n294\n00:15:51.243 --> 00:15:52.238\nthe user to see.\n\n295\n00:15:52.238 --> 00:15:55.832\nAnd only by testing will you be\nable to determine what's going on.\n\n296\n00:15:55.832 --> 00:15:59.163\nAnd I'm not just saying you should test,\nI'm saying that you should go to your\n\n297\n00:15:59.163 --> 00:16:01.550\nfriends and say, look,\nI'm working on this webpage.\n\n298\n00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.790\nCan you test it for me?\n\n299\n00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.520\nI'm doing this.\n\n300\n00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.540\nCan you test it for me?\n\n301\n00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.440\nAsk people, strangers,\nfind somebody in the mall.\n\n302\n00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.240\nSay, look, I'm testing this site.\n\n303\n00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.050\nCan you give me feedback?\n\n304\n00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.240\nDo whatever it takes, but\n\n305\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.560\nget the feedback to make sure that you're\nreaching an audience that is diverse and\n\n306\n00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.510\nthey're gonna give you honest\nfeedback cuz that's important.\n\n307\n00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.273\nYour friends are gonna say,\nyeah, it's great.\n\n308\n00:16:21.273 --> 00:16:22.133\nWe love it.\n\n309\n00:16:22.133 --> 00:16:24.370\nThey're not gonna give\nyou that honest feedback.\n\n310\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:30.590\nI had created this site one time, where I\ngave it to a random stranger and she came\n\n311\n00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:35.670\nback with tons of feedback that I never\nheard from my close friends or coworkers.\n\n312\n00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.270\nAnd I thought it was\nthe greatest thing in the world.\n\n313\n00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.000\nNow, it technically was pretty good.\n\n314\n00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.230\nBut it still had some things\nthat were lacking, and\n\n315\n00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.950\nfrom a perspective that\nI'd never seen before.\n\n316\n00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.000\nSo it's really good for\n\n317\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.580\nyou to get that perspective so\nyou can start to be a better designer.\n\n318\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:56.240\nAnd never be afraid of criticism, or\npositive or negative information.\n\n319\n00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.620\nNever be afraid.\n\n320\n00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.190\nNo matter what that information\nis gonna make you better.\n\n321\n00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.110\nEspecially if you're\nopen to listening to it.\n\n322\n00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.670\nWe hear those horror stories all the time\nwhere somebody writes something on Yelp\n\n323\n00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.080\nabout a particular restaurant.\n\n324\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.880\nAnd then the manager of the restaurant\ngets into an arguing match with\n\n325\n00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.990\nthe client in saying look this is what\nwe did and you didn't appreciate it.\n\n326\n00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.090\nNo, don't do that.\n\n327\n00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.300\nSay, we thank you for\nthe information you provided.\n\n328\n00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.650\nWe're sorry you didn't\nhave a good experience and\n\n329\n00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.310\nhere's what we can do to make it better.\n\n330\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.760\nAnd here's what we've\ndone to make it better.\n\n331\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.860\nThat's it.\n\n332\n00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.070\nTake the information,\nutilize it whatever way you need to.\n\n333\n00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:31.360\nBut certainly, take it as it is.\n\n334\n00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.850\nTake it as somebody providing you\na way to make yourself better.\n\n335\n00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.640\nSo, now we're gonna talk\nabout layout symmetry.\n\n336\n00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.440\nSo, we talked about the fact\nthat you need to have balance.\n\n337\n00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.390\nWe talked about the fact that you wanna\nmake your design work for everyone and so\n\n338\n00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.860\nhere we're looking at some concepts\nabout the symmetry of your site and\n\n339\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.490\nhow you can find that balance.\n\n340\n00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.750\nSo horizontal symmetry we have\nitems that are side by side so\n\n341\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.170\nif you got top down symmetry you\nmight have the banner at the top and\n\n342\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:00.790\nthe footer at the bottom\nthat kind of thing.\n\n343\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.630\nThere is symmetry that way as well so\nthat would be your vertical symmetry.\n\n344\n00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:09.149\nBut you can also go left and right as well\nso I might have articles on the left hand\n\n345\n00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:13.464\nside and I might have links to archived\narticles on the right hand side, and\n\n346\n00:18:13.464 --> 00:18:16.430\nthat would be more like of a blog post or\nsomething.\n\n347\n00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.969\nDiagonal symmetry, so\nthis is where you're placing item so\n\n348\n00:18:18.969 --> 00:18:21.318\nyou might have a picture here\nwith some text on the left.\n\n349\n00:18:21.318 --> 00:18:24.400\nAnd you might have text on the right here,\nbut the picture's on the left.\n\n350\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.380\nSo diagonal symmetry provides that.\n\n351\n00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.160\nSo you're breaking it up with images and\n\n352\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.920\nyou're breaking it up with text\nin those opposite corners.\n\n353\n00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.830\nRadial symmetry, so you're laying\nout items in a circular fashion, so\n\n354\n00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.990\nyou've got objects on your page\nin a certain way that, again,\n\n355\n00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.960\nit feels balanced because of\nthat symmetry that's going on.\n\n356\n00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.840\nNow, you might even have\nasymmetric symmetry,\n\n357\n00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.250\nI know that sounds like a oxymoron.\n\n358\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:52.540\nHow can something be asymmetric but\nalso be symmetrical at the same time?\n\n359\n00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.500\nWell, the balance lies in maybe\nthe similarity of what's going on.\n\n360\n00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.690\nHere, there showing us a large\nobject in the upper left, and\n\n361\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:04.310\nthe smaller object on the lower right, but\nit might still feel balanced depending on\n\n362\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.050\nwhat other content you might add, or\nhow you've presented the information.\n\n363\n00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:12.460\nSo, there are ways to get around that,\nbut here's the thing.\n\n364\n00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.700\nIf you look at information and\nyou don't feel good about it,\n\n365\n00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.320\nif you don't get a good feeling, then\nthere's something wrong with the design.\n\n366\n00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.700\nAnd use that gut instinct\nto figure that out.\n\n367\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.750\nAnd if you don't have that gut instinct,\nask somebody else.\n\n368\n00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.610\nAlways get a second, a third, a fourth,\n\n369\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.840\na fiftieth opinion, because they're\ngonna provide you that feedback and say,\n\n370\n00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.720\nwell this design doesn't work for\nme or it works great but\n\n371\n00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.450\nonly when I'm doing this or when I'm\nin this browser or that kind of thing.\n\n372\n00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.019\nAnd that's really important\nto figure all that out.\n\n373\n00:19:42.657 --> 00:19:45.779\nNow that we've talked\nabout design principles,\n\n374\n00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:50.400\nhere is one of the most important\npieces with regards to this discussion.\n\n375\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.280\nAnd we're talking about copyright.\n\n376\n00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.085\nNow, for those of you who are listening,\n\n377\n00:19:56.085 --> 00:20:00.645\nit's important to understand that\nanything on the Internet is not free.\n\n378\n00:20:00.645 --> 00:20:05.075\nJust because it's out there and they tell\nyou you can download it, it's not free.\n\n379\n00:20:05.075 --> 00:20:08.982\nThere's gonna be something attached\nto that, nothing is ever free.\n\n380\n00:20:08.982 --> 00:20:10.092\nNothing.\n\n381\n00:20:10.092 --> 00:20:11.702\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n382\n00:20:11.702 --> 00:20:14.812\nIf that game you downloaded,\nit was free, and\n\n383\n00:20:14.812 --> 00:20:17.517\nyou didn't download it from\na reputable source, it wasn't free.\n\n384\n00:20:17.517 --> 00:20:19.189\nSomebody did something that\nthey shouldn't be doing.\n\n385\n00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.620\nAll right so,\n\n386\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.600\ncopyright is basically the act of congress\nthat give exclusive rights reproduce,\n\n387\n00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:31.990\ndistribute, perform or display the work\nthey give it to the content creator.\n\n388\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.610\nOnly the content creator\nhas this exclusive rights.\n\n389\n00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.100\nIf you can say that you\ncreated this content\n\n390\n00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.110\nthen you can have those\nexclusive rights as well.\n\n391\n00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.020\nIf you can't say that,\n\n392\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:46.540\nthen you do not have anything to do with\nthis Digital Millennium Copyrights Act.\n\n393\n00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.040\nIt's not protecting you in any way.\n\n394\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.300\nIf you find an image on the Internet and\nyou wanna pull it down and use it so\n\n395\n00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.130\nyou can make money,\nyou have just violated a law.\n\n396\n00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.710\nIf you rent and you found that movie on\nthe Internet and you downloaded it and\n\n397\n00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.930\nyou started watching it,\nyou have just violated the law,\n\n398\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.370\nunless you either paid for it or you have\na subscription or it's on Netflix or\n\n399\n00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.700\nsome other subscription service.\n\n400\n00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.230\nVideo, especially.\n\n401\n00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.607\nVideo content, unless it's on YouTube.\n\n402\n00:21:13.607 --> 00:21:16.069\nAnd even then it might\nstill be an infringement.\n\n403\n00:21:16.069 --> 00:21:19.858\nThe point here is, you might not be\ninfringing, but somebody else might.\n\n404\n00:21:19.858 --> 00:21:23.060\nSo we gotta keep in mind that there\nare copyrights out there to protect\n\n405\n00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.120\nthe content creators of\ntheir intellectual property.\n\n406\n00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.500\nSo what is copyrightable work?\n\n407\n00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.700\nCopyrightable work is anything you create.\n\n408\n00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.990\nAnything you create.\n\n409\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:40.520\nHowever, if you derive your creation from\nsomebody else, you didn't create it.\n\n410\n00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.590\nIt's called a derivative work.\n\n411\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.530\nSo you have to think about it.\n\n412\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:49.320\nAnd create it from your own mind and\nfrom your own experience and\n\n413\n00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.090\nfrom your own skill set.\n\n414\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:54.160\nIt has to be created by you,\nthat is copyrightable work.\n\n415\n00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.720\nYou become the author and you become\nprotected by that act of congress.\n\n416\n00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.500\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\n\n417\n00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.860\nDerivative work, and\nI'll tell you the most famous case.\n\n418\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.990\nWhen Obama was running for\n\n419\n00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.250\nPresident, a poster appeared with\nthe word hope underneath it.\n\n420\n00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.540\nAnd it had Obama looking off into\nthe distance, and one side was red,\n\n421\n00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.960\none side was blue, and\nit was opposite on his face.\n\n422\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.700\nAnd this became an incredibly\npopular visual to represent\n\n423\n00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.240\nthe campaign to represent\neverything that was going on.\n\n424\n00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.340\nWell, after Obama had taken office\nit was discovered that the person,\n\n425\n00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:37.770\nthe photographer who created that work\nhad used it from an AP photograph.\n\n426\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.450\nAn Associated Press photograph.\n\n427\n00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.290\nHe had taken the photograph,\nand he'd gone into illustrator,\n\n428\n00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:46.060\nand he vectorized the image, and\nthen he created that whole scheme.\n\n429\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.960\nHe was sued by the Associated Press for\nmillions of dollars and lost.\n\n430\n00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.110\nNow granted, yes,\nI said millions of dollars.\n\n431\n00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:57.700\nThat means he made millions\nof dollars off of the image.\n\n432\n00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.080\nSo this is why they were able to get\nmillions of dollars back from him.\n\n433\n00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.100\nSo, I think the settlement was\nsomething like 7 to $11 million or\n\n434\n00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.290\nsomething like that.\n\n435\n00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:06.330\nBut the point here is,\n\n436\n00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:11.200\nis he had created the work off of\na photograph taken by an Associated Press\n\n437\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.720\nphotographer, and that photographer\nwas the copyright holder of the work.\n\n438\n00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.700\nThis gentleman did not ask for permission.\n\n439\n00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:24.830\nAnd derived his work from that photograph\nand therefore he was liable for damages.\n\n440\n00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:29.270\nAnd the court discovered that and\nhe was charged appropriately.\n\n441\n00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.840\nSo a derivative work comes from a work\nthat somebody else has created and\n\n442\n00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.290\nyou are using it in your work.\n\n443\n00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:36.820\nDuration.\n\n444\n00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.658\nDuration is how long\nthe copyright is good for.\n\n445\n00:23:38.658 --> 00:23:44.617\nNow this one is kind of an interesting\nstory because the duration of a copyright\n\n446\n00:23:44.617 --> 00:23:50.306\nis held by the copyright holder for\nthe lifetime of the copyright holder and\n\n447\n00:23:50.306 --> 00:23:54.842\n50 to 70 years after the death\nof the copyright holder.\n\n448\n00:23:54.842 --> 00:23:58.740\nAnd this comes because of Mickey Mouse.\n\n449\n00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:05.260\nWhen Walt Disney was starting out as\na designer, as a creator, an artist,\n\n450\n00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:09.750\nhe had created a character\nthat was a rabbit.\n\n451\n00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:15.340\nAnd he had gone to New York, and\nhe was trying to get it syndicated and\n\n452\n00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.199\nhe was trying to work\nwith publishing houses.\n\n453\n00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.850\nAnd he didn't sign the proper contracts,\nand\n\n454\n00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:26.170\nwhen he quit that job,\nhe couldn't take his work with him.\n\n455\n00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:29.610\nThey owned the right to that rabbit, okay?\n\n456\n00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.830\nWell, when he created Mickey Mouse,\nhe was smart enough where he said,\n\n457\n00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.950\nlook, I need to get something in\nwriting here, I need to get laws made.\n\n458\n00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.590\nI need something to help me out here.\n\n459\n00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.810\nSo he went to whoever he needed to go to,\nand said,\n\n460\n00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.260\nlook I created this work, and\nI don't want anyone else to use it.\n\n461\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.470\nWell, what happened was,\nthe copyrights used to expire after so\n\n462\n00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:52.810\nmany years, and he went to Congress and\nsaid, look, this expiring thing,\n\n463\n00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.000\nyou're going to make me loose billions of\ndollars because literally Disney makes\n\n464\n00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.840\nbillions of dollars.\n\n465\n00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.100\nOne billion dollars a year\njust on Mickey Mouse.\n\n466\n00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.990\nAnd you would think that's kind of\ncrazy because Mickey Mouse is what\n\n467\n00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.950\n60, 70 years old?\n\n468\n00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:03.630\nIt's very old.\n\n469\n00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:04.890\nIt's been around for a long time, but\n\n470\n00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.060\nhe still makes a billion dollars\na year just on Mickey Mouse.\n\n471\n00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:12.380\nSo, the point here is, to protect that\nhe goes, or the Walt Disney company\n\n472\n00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.440\ncontinues to go to the Congress,and they\ncontinue to solicit to extend this out.\n\n473\n00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.190\nSo we say 50 to 70 years,\n\n474\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.610\nbecause I think the last time I heard\nthat congress was going to extend it.\n\n475\n00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.600\nIt was gonna be 70 years\nafter the person died.\n\n476\n00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.440\nThat's because Walt Disney\nhas been dead for awhile, and\n\n477\n00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.182\nthey don't want Micky Mouse's\ncopyright to lapse while he's dead.\n\n478\n00:25:32.182 --> 00:25:32.940\nBecause again, like I said,\n\n479\n00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.700\nthey still make a billions dollars\na year just on Micky Mouse.\n\n480\n00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.220\nSo the duration is 50 to 70 years\nafter the life of the person.\n\n481\n00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.830\nNow there's some loopholes\nin there as well.\n\n482\n00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.150\nAs the copyright holder, I can create\na foundation, I can create a group,\n\n483\n00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.670\nan organization that\ncan my manage my work.\n\n484\n00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:52.610\nAnd I can sign those rights over to them.\n\n485\n00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.800\nAnd organizations never die.\n\n486\n00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.660\nAs long as there's somebody\nthere to run it, they never die.\n\n487\n00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.740\nSo that's one loophole around that,\n\n488\n00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.230\nis to make sure that you've assigned\nthose rights to that organization.\n\n489\n00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:06.210\nAnd organizations will never die,\nas long as somebody's there to run it.\n\n490\n00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:08.810\nFair use.\n\n491\n00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:13.520\nThe term fair use comes from the fact that\nas an educational facility, as people who\n\n492\n00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:19.350\nwork in academia, you can use works of\nart that were created by somebody else.\n\n493\n00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:25.270\nHowever, in academia you must cite\nthe original copyright holder.\n\n494\n00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:29.550\nYou must say, this came from the source\nof whatever and do whatever else.\n\n495\n00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:34.130\nYou don't have to ask for permission, but\nyou should cite where the work came from.\n\n496\n00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.650\nYou can also create documentaries and\nnot have to worry about copyright.\n\n497\n00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.390\nSo, for example,\n\n498\n00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:45.300\nwhen you watch the news and they're\nstanding in front of Enron, for example,\n\n499\n00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.820\nback in the day, or I'll do one new today,\nthey're standing in front of Google.\n\n500\n00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.320\nAnd they're taking a video and\nthey show you the Google logo.\n\n501\n00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.990\nWell, normally Google owns the logo,\nthey own that whole thing,\n\n502\n00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:57.350\nit's their copyright.\n\n503\n00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:02.120\nBut because it's a news organization doing\na documentary style thing, it's fair use.\n\n504\n00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.410\nThey can show the logo and\nnot have to pay royalties to Google.\n\n505\n00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:13.100\nNow another thing is,\nto talk about fair use, happy birthday.\n\n506\n00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.300\nYou know when you go into a restaurant and\nit's somebody's birthday, and\n\n507\n00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.520\nyou let the waiter or the waitress\nknow that it's somebody's birthday.\n\n508\n00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.410\nAnd you make sure there's a cake\navailable and everything, and\n\n509\n00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.806\nthen they get everybody together\nwhen it's It's time for dessert.\n\n510\n00:27:25.806 --> 00:27:27.520\nAnd they say, they'd come out and\n\n511\n00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.960\nthey'd start singing so\nwe hear it's your birthday da da na,\n\n512\n00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.090\nand they'd start singing some other song,\nnot happy birthday.\n\n513\n00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.270\nAnd you're like,\nwhy aren't they singing happy birthday?\n\n514\n00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.780\nWell, that's because AOL owned\nthe happy birthday tune,\n\n515\n00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.360\nthey have the copyright on it.\n\n516\n00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.700\nAnd they made, I think it was,\n\n517\n00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.690\nseveral million dollars a year on\nthe Happy Birthday tune every year.\n\n518\n00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:51.450\nAnd it would cost you $2500 to sing\nthe song in public every time you did it,\n\n519\n00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.780\nespecially for\nan organization like a restaurant.\n\n520\n00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.340\nSo you couldn't do that.\n\n521\n00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.000\nLuckily, just recently,\nI think as recent as last year,\n\n522\n00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.390\nHappy Birthday was\nplaced in public domain.\n\n523\n00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:12.330\nSo now anybody can sing happy birthday\nregardless of not having to pay the $2500\n\n524\n00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.320\nlicense fee for it.\n\n525\n00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.977\nSo happy birthday is now in public domain.\n\n526\n00:28:15.977 --> 00:28:21.500\nSo fair use is when you use\nsomething to teach others or\n\n527\n00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.890\nwhen you use it in a documentary.\n\n528\n00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:27.160\nHowever I've seen people\non YouTube claim fair\n\n529\n00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:32.180\nuse when they're using content from music\nor whatever it is on the internet and\n\n530\n00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:37.730\nthey've created a video and they cut\nit off at the last maybe 30 seconds.\n\n531\n00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.660\nThey're kind of sawing\noff the last 30 seconds.\n\n532\n00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.260\nThen they claim fair use because they\ndidn't use the entire work, okay?\n\n533\n00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.420\nWell they used the derivative work and\nthat's an infringement.\n\n534\n00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.370\nSo that's something to keep in mind.\n\n535\n00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.490\nInfringement is when you violate\nthe Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\n\n536\n00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:57.540\nWhenever you receive that movie on that\nCD that you got from a friend because\n\n537\n00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.470\nthey downloaded it off the internet, you\nare infringing on somebody's copyright.\n\n538\n00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.750\nWhenever you take that\npicture off the Internet,\n\n539\n00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.980\nyou find it in Google you take it off,\nand you print it on to a CD cover and\n\n540\n00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.100\nyou sell that to somebody, you've\njust infringed on somebody's rights.\n\n541\n00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.590\nNow granted, if you download an image and\n\n542\n00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:17.430\nyou put it on the backdrop of your\ncomputer That's not infringement per se.\n\n543\n00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.920\nYou are not publicly putting it\nout there for people to see.\n\n544\n00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.110\nWe are talking about when you publicly\nput it out there for people to see, so\n\n545\n00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.470\nwhen you design your webpages,\nand whatever content you use,\n\n546\n00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.190\nyou better have paid for that content.\n\n547\n00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:31.950\nAnd, you better understand\nthe licensing for that.\n\n548\n00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.620\nOtherwise, you might be infringing\non somebody's copyright.\n\n549\n00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:40.300\nNow, there are websites,\nlike Shutterstock, and things like that,\n\n550\n00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:46.460\nDreamstime, where you can purchase the\nrights to put these elements on your page.\n\n551\n00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:50.590\nAnd these are stock photos of just people\ndoing poses and that kind of thing.\n\n552\n00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:55.300\nOr sports athletes with no branding for\nlogos or anything on their clothing.\n\n553\n00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.120\nBut they're kicking around a soccer\nball or throwing a football.\n\n554\n00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.350\nThose are things you can purchase.\n\n555\n00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.770\nAnd it's usually $.50 to\n$1.00 to purchase that.\n\n556\n00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:07.020\nBut at that point, you are now purchasing\nthe rights to put them up on your webpage\n\n557\n00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.280\nand you don't have to cite that\nyou got it from Shutterstock or\n\n558\n00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.240\nyou got it from Dreamstime,\nyou don't have to cite.\n\n559\n00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.020\nLastly, the term intellectual property\nis anything that's created by you\n\n560\n00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:22.210\nthat is considered to be\na copyrightable work, okay.\n\n561\n00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.370\nIntellectual property is\nsomething that you create,\n\n562\n00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:29.180\nyou've thought about it, you've used\nyour mind to devise it in some way and\n\n563\n00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.330\nnow you're putting it out there for\nthe world to see.\n\n564\n00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.270\nThe minute you publish it out to the web,\n\n565\n00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.730\nit's technically protected by\nthe Digital Millennium Copyrights Act.\n\n566\n00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.305\nIt used to be you had to apply.\n\n567\n00:30:39.305 --> 00:30:43.070\nYou had to go to a congressional office or\nsomething and\n\n568\n00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:46.770\nyou would apply to a government office\nto make sure you had the copyrights.\n\n569\n00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.700\nBut now because of the way everything\nworks in the digital world, the minute\n\n570\n00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.290\nyou publish it out there and you include\ncertain terminology on your website,\n\n571\n00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:58.010\nyou now own the content of that website.\n\n572\n00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.680\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthat here in a minute.\n\n573\n00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.490\nSo, intellectual property.\n\n574\n00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:05.580\nAlso, I've had questions from people,\nbecause I teach Illustrator and\n\n575\n00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.700\nI teach applications that\nlet me create content.\n\n576\n00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.020\nAnd people ask me, well if If I\ncreated this app while I was at work,\n\n577\n00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.760\nI still own the app because it\nhad nothing to do with my job.\n\n578\n00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.510\nNo!\n\n579\n00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:23.020\nAnything you do while you're on the clock\nat your work is owned by your company,\n\n580\n00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.680\nand you need to Need to keep that in mind.\n\n581\n00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:30.360\nUnless it's specified in the contract\nthat you can do these things and\n\n582\n00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.530\nthey won't be the copyright\nholder everything you do at work.\n\n583\n00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:38.530\nAnd so including creating content for\nwebsites for your company They own it.\n\n584\n00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.270\nIncluding creating a logo or\ncreating whatever.\n\n585\n00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:42.660\nThey own that content.\n\n586\n00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:46.130\nIt's not untill you either get that\nin writing in your contract or\n\n587\n00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.490\nyou leave and don't do the work.\n\n588\n00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:52.350\nThe best thing just to do at home Don't\ndo any of this stuff at work, and\n\n589\n00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:52.920\nyou'll be fine.\n\n590\n00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.460\nBecause you then own\nthe intellectual property.\n\n591\n00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.610\nOkay, the last piece I wanna talk\nabout with regards to copyright\n\n592\n00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:02.300\nis literally what you need to declare\n\n593\n00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.360\nthat you are the copyright holder\nof the intellectual property.\n\n594\n00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.910\nThe first thing you need\nis the word copyright\n\n595\n00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.380\nNeeds to be somewhere on your page.\n\n596\n00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.940\nUsually I include it at the bottom\nof every single one of my pages.\n\n597\n00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.570\nAnd you've seen this before on websites.\n\n598\n00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.960\nRight at the bottom it says copyright,\nand then it has the copyright symbol and\n\n599\n00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.740\nthe year 2016, 2015,\nwhatever the copyright year is.\n\n600\n00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.550\nThen it has to have\nthe copyright holders name,\n\n601\n00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.990\nand then all rights reserved after it.\n\n602\n00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:30.000\nSo I've given you a sample\ndown here at the bottom,\n\n603\n00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.480\ncopyright 2016,\nJymbeau.com all rights reserved.\n\n604\n00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:38.170\nSo basically this is a correct\nway to write a copyright and\n\n605\n00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.330\nthis lets everybody know that you own\nthe rights, to everything on your site.\n\n606\n00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:48.990\nOkay, so\nthat is in a nutshell our discussion about\n\n607\n00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.390\nthe design,\nprinciples of web design and copyright.\n\n608\n00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:58.570\n>> Well Jim I appreciate that and I'm sure\nyou appreciate that out there, you might\n\n609\n00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.800\nhave just saved us quite a bit of money\n>> If we would've violated\n\n610\n00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.170\nany of those laws, or maybe not understood\nthat right so I do appreciate that.\n\n611\n00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:08.210\nIt does look like we're gonna sign off for\nthis episode, but before we do Jim,\n\n612\n00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.070\ndo got any parting advice?\n\n613\n00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:14.530\n>> Again just keep in mind that if you've\ncreated the content, from scratch,\n\n614\n00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.620\nyou own it and you're protected.\n\n615\n00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.630\nIf you are pulling it down from the web,\nand you didn't ask for permission,\n\n616\n00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:25.560\nyou don't own it And that's really\nthe easiest way to consider copyright.\n\n617\n00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.900\nIf you created it from your own tools,\n\n618\n00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.590\nfrom your own thought process,\nyou're good to go.\n\n619\n00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.380\nIf you pull it from the Internet and\nthen you derive something out of it, or\n\n620\n00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.920\nyou use a piece of it to\nsomething else you're doing,\n\n621\n00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.540\nyou're infringing on\nsomebody else's right.\n\n622\n00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.550\nAnd you can ask for permission.\n\n623\n00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:44.570\n>> I've been a web developer for\nmany sites, people have written to me and\n\n624\n00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:48.560\nemailed me and have said,\nJim is this, can I use this?\n\n625\n00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.090\nI work for a school, and\nI say fair use, no problem.\n\n626\n00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.190\nSchool's good,\nother things Things that I'll say, yeah,\n\n627\n00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.990\njust site me, site me back,\nand they're fine.\n\n628\n00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:57.010\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n629\n00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:57.600\n>> Very good.\n\n630\n00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.910\nWe appreciate that information.\n\n631\n00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:00.530\nWe appreciate you the viewer out here.\n\n632\n00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:03.930\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n633\n00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:04.790\n>> And I'm Jim Sirrels.\n\n634\n00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.693\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n635\n00:34:06.693 --> 00:34:15.110\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.262\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:20.090\nin today's episode we are moving\nthrough our series in DreamWeaver.\n\n5\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.640\nThat's right, we're coming back\nwith some more creative Cloud 2015,\n\n6\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.060\nand we're going to be looking\nat publishing your site.\n\n7\n00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.350\nJoining me back in the studios\ntoday is none other than Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.510\nJim Serros, Jim, how you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.710\n>> I'm doing great Wes,\nthank you for having me back, and\n\n10\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.340\nthank you to the ITProTV team for\n\n11\n00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.470\nhaving me here as well to discuss\nDreamWeaver And specifically,\n\n12\n00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.560\nwe're going to be talking about\npublishing our design out to the web.\n\n13\n00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.200\nAnd I'd like to kind of finish\nup some content here and\n\n14\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.120\ntalk about bringing in some\ntext from Microsoft Word, and\n\n15\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.400\nthen I'd like to show you the server\nspace within our sites panel\n\n16\n00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.240\nwhich will allow us to add our FTP.\n\n17\n00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.030\nAnd if some of the terminology there\njust got you confused or blew your mind,\n\n18\n00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.800\njust be aware we're gonna talk about\nthose concepts and explain them to you so\n\n19\n00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.000\nyou understand what they are.\n\n20\n00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.140\nSo I'd like to dive back into my design\nthat we've been working on throughout\n\n21\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.780\nthis whole process.\n\n22\n00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.690\nAnd I'd like to go into\nthe main section here.\n\n23\n00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.630\nNow, you've seen before where we\ncould type whatever text we want.\n\n24\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.740\nBut I'd like to import text\nfrom a Word document just so\n\n25\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.210\nI have a more completed homepage here.\n\n26\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.739\nSo I'm gonna erase the word home.\n\n27\n00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:26.870\nAnd then I am gonna go up to the file\nmenu, and I am gonna choose Import.\n\n28\n00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.120\nI can literally import\ndata into my document.\n\n29\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.230\nSo if I choose Import,\nI can do XML into template.\n\n30\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.730\nXML is extensible markup language,\nbasically it's\n\n31\n00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.530\npart of the family of markup languages\nlike HTML, hypertext markup language.\n\n32\n00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.510\nAnd basically,\nit just means that what's coming is data.\n\n33\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.440\nTabular data,\n\n34\n00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.190\nbasically what we talked about in\na previous episode regarding tables.\n\n35\n00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.040\nYou can organize your\ninformation as tabular data.\n\n36\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.880\nBut I can bring in a Word document or\neven an Excel document.\n\n37\n00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.050\nSo, in this case I wanna\nbring in some text so\n\n38\n00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.200\nI'm gonna click on\nthe Word document option.\n\n39\n00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.870\nWhen I do that,\nit goes into my sites route and\n\n40\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.020\nit says, here's a document from Word.\n\n41\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.290\nNow, this is an older version of\nWord as you can see cuz it does not\n\n42\n00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.580\nhave the x at the end.\n\n43\n00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.700\nBut I'm going to select that file,\nand I'm going to click Open.\n\n44\n00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.690\nNow some things I like to talk about\ndown here especially this one.\n\n45\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.330\nIt says Clean up Word paragraph spacing.\n\n46\n00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.580\nWhat's gonna happen is it's going\nto bring in some text structure and\n\n47\n00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.540\nbasic formatting from the Word document.\n\n48\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.730\nIf ever you've created a Word Document,\nyou might not have noticed this, but\n\n49\n00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.600\nyou can use headings,\nyou can use paragraphs,\n\n50\n00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.040\nyou can use a bunch of preset styles that\nWord has set inside of the application.\n\n51\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.270\nWell all of those will be translated by\nhtml and understood as to what they are.\n\n52\n00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.770\nBut here it says Clean up Word paragraph\nspacing, because whenever you hit\n\n53\n00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.340\nthe Enter key on the keyboard,\nit adds spacing between all of your text.\n\n54\n00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.460\nAnd here they're just saying\nthey're going to clean that up.\n\n55\n00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.220\nSo we'll see what happens\nwhen we bring that in.\n\n56\n00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.120\nNow we do want to grab this pulldown and\nshow you that I can change this.\n\n57\n00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.790\nI can say, just bring in the text,\n\n58\n00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.180\ndon't bring in any formatting whatsoever,\nI'll use cascading style sheets.\n\n59\n00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.320\nIs to format it.\n\n60\n00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.710\nYou could say bring in the text structure,\nparagraphs, lists and tables.\n\n61\n00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.730\nYou could say just bring in the basic\nformatting which are bold and italic.\n\n62\n00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.900\nOr you could say bring in the text\nstructure with the full formatting of\n\n63\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.280\nbold, italic and\nany styles that have been applied.\n\n64\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.640\nAnd that would be your\nparagraph styles for\n\n65\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.340\nheading ones heading\nto this kind of thing.\n\n66\n00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.500\nSo I'm just gonna do the bold and\nitalic here, the default setting.\n\n67\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.060\nAnd I'm gonna click Open.\n\n68\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.660\nAnd it should bring the text right\ninto my editable region, which it did.\n\n69\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.010\nSo now I have something\nthat I can test against.\n\n70\n00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.150\nThe first thing I'd like to do before\npublishing is I wanna make sure that\n\n71\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.020\nthe text inside of my file\nis at least spell checked.\n\n72\n00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.360\nSo Dreamweaver allows you to do that\nby going up to the Commands menu and\n\n73\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.540\nchoosing the Check Spelling option.\n\n74\n00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.990\nIt's also Shift+F7 on your keyboard.\n\n75\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.530\nNow it's gonna come up and say DreamWeaver\nhas reached the end of the document,\n\n76\n00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.520\nyou want to continue checking.\n\n77\n00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.900\nBecause my cursor was\nat the end of the text,\n\n78\n00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.220\nit wants to start over again from\nthe beginning, so I'm gonna say yes.\n\n79\n00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.390\nAnd right now it is finding that there is\nample ampleness, I'm not sure where that\n\n80\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.150\nword is, but I know that word doesn't make\nany sense to me unless I can add it here.\n\n81\n00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.370\nSo I'm going to say change Online\nit says it's one word, but\n\n82\n00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.420\nit's putting a capital letter.\n\n83\n00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.440\nI'll say change, again,\njust spell checking, and there we go.\n\n84\n00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.910\nSo, now we went through,\nit checks the text out, and\n\n85\n00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.750\nI'm happy with the fact that it did the\nspellchecking job that it was supposed to\n\n86\n00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.470\ndo, whether I agree with it or not.\n\n87\n00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.960\nThat's okay, but the machine\ndid what it was supposed to do.\n\n88\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.950\nNow there's another check\nthat I'd like to do,\n\n89\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.010\nI'd actually like to check for\nany link errors that I might have, or\n\n90\n00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.890\nsome other checks that are available\nto me within Dreamweaver.\n\n91\n00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.490\nAnd this is all done before I publish.\n\n92\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.160\nSo, I'm ready to go.\n\n93\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.730\nThis particular item that I wanna bring\nup is going to be in the window menu, so\n\n94\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.140\nwhen I click on the window, and\n\n95\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.020\nI go down to results, you have a whole\nbunch of items you can work with.\n\n96\n00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.890\nYou can validate your code.\n\n97\n00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.010\nYou can do a line checker.\n\n98\n00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.730\nYou can look for site reports or FTP logs.\n\n99\n00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.480\nBasically, looking at an FTP log will\ntell you how many times you've tried to\n\n100\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.800\nconnect to your file transfer protocol\nsite and whether or not you had errors.\n\n101\n00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.050\nA site report will tell you how many\nsites you got, or how many pages\n\n102\n00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.690\nyou got within your site and\nwhat the content is and things like that.\n\n103\n00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.880\nThe line check, the link checker sorry,\nwill check your hyperlinks to make\n\n104\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.400\nsure that they do resolve\nthe way they're supposed to and\n\n105\n00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.310\nvalidation will test my code,\nmy html 5 code and\n\n106\n00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.590\nmy CSS3 code against the standard\nthat is out there on the web So\n\n107\n00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.380\nif I choose Link Checker in this example,\nit's gonna bring up this dialog box.\n\n108\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.590\nNow it's not really gonna do\nanything until I hit this\n\n109\n00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.060\nlittle Play icon here on the left.\n\n110\n00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.590\nThis is where you go to check.\n\n111\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.290\nSo I hit this Play icon, and I could tell\nit to check the links in this current\n\n112\n00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.910\ndocument, I could check the links for\nthe entire current local site, Or\n\n113\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.240\nI could check for links for\nselected files within the site.\n\n114\n00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.890\nSo, if I wanted to do the entire site,\nI could choose this current local site and\n\n115\n00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.460\ngo from there but\n\n116\n00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.850\nI just want to do this current document\nfor the sake of this conversation.\n\n117\n00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.490\nSo when I do that I see that I've\nhad no broken links whatsoever.\n\n118\n00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.820\nSo no link or files were found on\nthe local Discs that were broken.\n\n119\n00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.820\nIf I had anything that was broken\nyou would see in this list and\n\n120\n00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.820\nyou could double-click on it and it would\ntake you right into the code or right\n\n121\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.440\nunder a webpage where that link resides\nand you could correct it at that time.\n\n122\n00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.290\nNow in the status bar at the bottom\nI am given some statistics,\n\n123\n00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.140\nit's telling me that I've got one file,\none HTML.\n\n124\n00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.600\nI've got 22 Links, and all 22 are okay.\n\n125\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.430\nIf I had any broken or any were external,\n\n126\n00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.680\nit would tell me that here\nas well in the bottom.\n\n127\n00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.620\nSo these items are down here,\nand they're available.\n\n128\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.490\nSo the link checker is sort of like\na spell checker but for links.\n\n129\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.210\nNow I'm gonna Open another window,\nI'll do validation this time.\n\n130\n00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.090\nSo I'm gonna come down into my Results,\nand go down and click on Validation.\n\n131\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.490\nNow, these are two separate panels, but\n\n132\n00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.710\nas we've learned in previous episodes, I\ncould stack them together into one panel.\n\n133\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.480\nAnd there is Validation.\n\n134\n00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.430\nNow, I'm going to go in and tell it that\nI want to validate this based on what\n\n135\n00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:58.440\nthe World Wide Web consortium,the\nW3C.org looks for within validation.\n\n136\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.530\nSo, I'm gonna click on that and it's going\nto say validate the current document but\n\n137\n00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.800\nbefore I do that I want\nto check the settings.\n\n138\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.450\nNow, the settings should be based on\nwhat I selected when I created the file\n\n139\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.690\ninitially so it should be based on html\nfive but I want to make sure of that.\n\n140\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.890\nChoose this,\nnotice HTML5 is the only one selected.\n\n141\n00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.590\nI could check it against these other guys,\n\n142\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.790\nbut this is the latest version and this\nis the one that I want to check against.\n\n143\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.330\nDisplay errors and warnings,\n\n144\n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.460\nthere's a check there so that if I do have\nany errors and warnings it'll tell me.\n\n145\n00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.340\nAnd then I can go in and say, don't\nshow WC validator notification dialog.\n\n146\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.330\nWhat that'll do is it'll\n\n147\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.580\npresent a dialog box like I would\nif I was on the w3c.org website.\n\n148\n00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.435\nSo at this time.\n\n149\n00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:42.915\nI'm gonna hit my okay button if I\ncan see it down at the bottom here.\n\n150\n00:07:42.915 --> 00:07:47.092\nAnd I can't so I'm gonna hit tab until I\nget down to where I think the bottom is,\n\n151\n00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:48.558\nand then hit the enter key.\n\n152\n00:07:48.558 --> 00:07:50.380\nThere we go.\n\n153\n00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.506\nSo now I'm done.\n\n154\n00:07:51.506 --> 00:07:53.119\nAnd I'm gonna run that.\n\n155\n00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:56.127\nSo if I validate my code, we'll see\nif it's gonna give me any errors.\n\n156\n00:07:56.127 --> 00:07:59.698\nNow, it says Dreamweaver will now send\nyour document to W3C Services for\n\n157\n00:07:59.698 --> 00:08:01.900\nvalidation, and it's going to send it out.\n\n158\n00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.610\nSo, literally, it's giving me the\nopportunity to look at what the terms and\n\n159\n00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.740\nconditions are, so if I don't agree with\nthose terms I can say no, don't' do this.\n\n160\n00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.160\nBut I'm okay with that, and as a matter\nof fact I don't want to show this again.\n\n161\n00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.370\nAnd so I'm just gonna click OK.\n\n162\n00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.859\nSo now it's going to contact the service.\n\n163\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.480\nOkay, so it looks like the current\ndocument validation is complete.\n\n164\n00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.900\nZero errors, zero warnings.\n\n165\n00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.410\nBut, really, it didn't do any check\n\n166\n00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.910\nbecause apparently it\ncouldn't reach the site.\n\n167\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.300\nSo, what I can do, instead, is I can\ntake out to an external website and\n\n168\n00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.900\nshow you what the W3C.org looks like.\n\n169\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.860\nAnd explain to you what\nthe validator is doing.\n\n170\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.550\nSo with this validation here I'm\njust gonna leave for a moment.\n\n171\n00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.740\nI'm gonna go to my browser or\npull up the W3C.org.\n\n172\n00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.160\nNow, the W3C, it's called W3 because\nof the fact that it's world wide web.\n\n173\n00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.400\nWWW stands for World Wide Web.\n\n174\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.450\nSo, the W3C is\nthe World Wide Web Consortium.\n\n175\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:58.540\nNow, they call it the W3C here in their\nlogo, but notice the website is W3.org.\n\n176\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.210\nSo, they've removed the C, okay?\n\n177\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.050\nBut they're still known as the W3C,\nthe Worldwide Web Consortium.\n\n178\n00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.508\nNow, if I go to their site, you'll see\nthat there's a lot of good information.\n\n179\n00:09:07.508 --> 00:09:10.450\nIf you wanted the latest information\nabout the standards of the Internet,\n\n180\n00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.390\nthis is where you go.\n\n181\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.050\nThis is where every website that\nprovides you that information,\n\n182\n00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.680\nthis is where they get it,\nbecause this is the source.\n\n183\n00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.170\nAnd if I scroll down here\non the right-hand side,\n\n184\n00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.610\nyou'll see Validators, more software.\n\n185\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.340\nSo I could click on Validators here, and\n\n186\n00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.590\nthere's a whole bunch of\nOpen Source Validators that I can use.\n\n187\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.400\nThe one I'm actually gonna look at in this\nexample is gonna be the CSS validator\n\n188\n00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.130\nright here in the middle.\n\n189\n00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.700\nSo it's alphabetically listed and\nI just jumped to it.\n\n190\n00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.920\nNow, I could upload my index file.\n\n191\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.020\nSo I could go here,\nupload the index file, and choose it.\n\n192\n00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:42.860\nAnd that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n193\n00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.790\nSo, if I haven't uploaded it yet\nor published it,\n\n194\n00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.830\nI can literally upload\nit right from that link.\n\n195\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:50.360\nAnd right here.\n\n196\n00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.120\nSo, if you remember in a previous episode,\nwe talked about form links or form fields,\n\n197\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.880\nand this is the field to upload the file.\n\n198\n00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.060\nSo if I click on check now, this check\nbutton will literally go through.\n\n199\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.460\nAnd notice, I get a green bar.\n\n200\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.710\nI said,\ncongratulations no errors were found.\n\n201\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.189\nAnd that's mostly because I relied on\nDreamweaver to write the CSS code for me.\n\n202\n00:10:09.189 --> 00:10:12.785\nSo that's perfect, that's exactly\nwhat I wanna see, especially\n\n203\n00:10:12.785 --> 00:10:16.680\nconsidering the fact that I don't\nwanna have to go in and fix anything.\n\n204\n00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.280\nHowever, if I did have to,\nI could go through the list and\n\n205\n00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.160\nfind out what was wrong and it would\ntell me what I need to do to resolve it.\n\n206\n00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.480\nSo the best part about this is,\nis again I can learn\n\n207\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.707\nabout how to write the code better\nby using these validators, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.900\nSo, I can use an internal validator\nif it connects out to the web and\n\n209\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.480\nit connects out to world web consortium,\nI can use that inside of Dreamweaver.\n\n210\n00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.228\nIf I can't,\nthen I'm gonna go to W3.org and\n\n211\n00:10:42.228 --> 00:10:44.810\nI'm gonna find the validator\nthat's available to do that.\n\n212\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.825\nSo, there we have it.\n\n213\n00:10:46.825 --> 00:10:47.595\nAll right.\n\n214\n00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:52.050\nSo I did my link checker, spell checker\nand the validation for my code, and\n\n215\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.130\nI'm satisfied that I'm\nready to publish this out.\n\n216\n00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.380\nSo, to publish,\nI will need to go up to the site menu.\n\n217\n00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.370\nAnd we've been here before.\n\n218\n00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.860\nAnd I'm going to go to manage sites.\n\n219\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.570\nAnd in the manage sites,\nI will see my sample site.\n\n220\n00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.280\nAnd I'm gonna edit that sample site by\nclicking on the little pencil icon.\n\n221\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.980\nNow that I'm inside the site,\n\n222\n00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.770\nexcuse me, I'm going to go to\nservers over here on the left.\n\n223\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.380\nAnd notice,\nI don't have any connection to any server.\n\n224\n00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.870\nSo, what I'm gonna do is\nhit the plus sign here, and\n\n225\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.194\nI can start filling in this information.\n\n226\n00:11:26.194 --> 00:11:28.550\nSo, basically, the server name, and\n\n227\n00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.930\nI can call this whatever I want,\nit's basically for my own information.\n\n228\n00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:35.499\nI could call it maybe my host company,\nwhoever is hosting it, and\n\n229\n00:11:35.499 --> 00:11:39.120\nusually GoDaddy or\n1&1 Computing or iPage or\n\n230\n00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.040\nwhatever you are using, those are some\nservices that provide web hosting.\n\n231\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.540\nYou can call it whatever you'd like, and\nI'm just gonna call it Jimbo.com for\n\n232\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.040\nthis example, cuz that's what\nI'm gonna use to upload this to,\n\n233\n00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.720\nI'm gonna upload it to my Jimbo.com site.\n\n234\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.440\nIt says connect using FTP.\n\n235\n00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.830\nFTP stands for file transfer protocol.\n\n236\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.400\nNow, we haven't talked about this, but\n\n237\n00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.700\nwhen you create a hyperlink to an external\nsite, it uses the HTTP protocol.\n\n238\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.670\nAnd you might have heard this before,\nbut HTTP stands for\n\n239\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.600\nhypertext transfer protocol.\n\n240\n00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.890\nAnd ht is just like the HT in HTML.\n\n241\n00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.930\nIt's a hyper-text transfer protocol,\nHyper-Text Markup Language.\n\n242\n00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.060\nThey all relate.\n\n243\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.770\nWell, the tp is transfer protocol.\n\n244\n00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.920\nIt describes how you can transfer\nfiles up to the Internet and\n\n245\n00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.750\npull them down from the Internet.\n\n246\n00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.300\nI could connect using some other options,\na Secure FTP.\n\n247\n00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:31.120\nI could to FTP over SSL,\nFTP over SSL with explicit encryption, or\n\n248\n00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.410\nI could do local network.\n\n249\n00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.530\nSo if I had a server on a local network,\nI could choose that option.\n\n250\n00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.590\nThere's also remote desktop services, and\n\n251\n00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.070\nthere's a web dab as well,\nthat's available.\n\n252\n00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.190\nMost commonly you're going to use FTP,\n\n253\n00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:48.460\nunless your host site tell you\nthat you need to use SFTP, secure.\n\n254\n00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.600\nAnd what that will do is literally\nchange the port that's available here.\n\n255\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.649\nSo that's the port in which it's going\nto send this data out to the Internet.\n\n256\n00:12:55.649 --> 00:13:00.494\nNow, the FTP address,\nftp://, and in my case,\n\n257\n00:13:00.494 --> 00:13:06.460\nmy site is www.jimbo.com, sorry,\nI forgot what I was doing.\n\n258\n00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:11.491\nThe username, however, is Jim Searles com,\n\n259\n00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:16.008\nand the password I'm not gonna tell you.\n\n260\n00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:23.561\nOkay?\n\n261\n00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:26.990\nAnd I do have a check box here,\nso I can save it for future use.\n\n262\n00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.910\nBut I also have a test.\n\n263\n00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.920\nSo, even before I go to publish and\nattempt to do this,\n\n264\n00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.880\nI can test it out to make sure that it\nis working the way it's supposed to.\n\n265\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.770\nCuz if I just hit save,\nit's not gonna test.\n\n266\n00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:40.320\nAnd then when I go upload my files, I\nmight not actually be making a connection.\n\n267\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.840\nSo I'm going to test it right here.\n\n268\n00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.580\nIt's going to bring up a dialogue box\nthat says we connected your web server\n\n269\n00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.460\nsuccessfully and you're good to go.\n\n270\n00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.770\nSo I click OK.\n\n271\n00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.520\nYou can specify a root directory,\n\n272\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.490\nkind of like what we did in our\nfiles panel over here on the right.\n\n273\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.610\nOkay?\nWe specified the root directory.\n\n274\n00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.810\nI don't need to do that here.\n\n275\n00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.380\nI just want to see everything.\n\n276\n00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:04.300\nAnd then the web URL for\nmy site is http://www.jimbo.com.\n\n277\n00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.085\nSo at this point, I'm good to go.\n\n278\n00:14:06.085 --> 00:14:09.140\nNow, there is an advanced button up\nhere at the top that I can click on.\n\n279\n00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.940\nSo, I'm gonna click on that\nadvanced button right there, and\n\n280\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.820\nyou can see that there are some\nother options that are available.\n\n281\n00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.620\nI can maintain\nsynchronization information.\n\n282\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.930\nWhat that means is, for\nthe files that I have local,\n\n283\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:24.010\nIt will synchronize automatically to\nthe files that are put out onto the web.\n\n284\n00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.580\nAutomatically upload files\nto the Server on Save.\n\n285\n00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.140\nNow, this is a little bit dangerous.\n\n286\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.940\nLet's say you're writing code,\nand you're programming and\n\n287\n00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.520\ndesigning your web site but\nit's not ready for prime time.\n\n288\n00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.250\nWell, if you have that checked,\nit's gonna upload it anyway.\n\n289\n00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.890\nSo, somebody might see it when\nit's not ready to be seen.\n\n290\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.520\nOr, if you upload it and overwrite what's\nalready there that is working, you might\n\n291\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.170\nhave a 404 Error or some kind of error on\nyour website that you didn't anticipate.\n\n292\n00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.100\nSo I usually do not have that checked.\n\n293\n00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.385\nI usually test it in everyday\nway that I can before I upload.\n\n294\n00:14:53.465 --> 00:14:56.635\nEnable file checkout allows\nyou to do collaboration.\n\n295\n00:14:56.635 --> 00:15:00.545\nSo, basically, what that says is is\nthat you can checkout the file and\n\n296\n00:15:00.545 --> 00:15:01.906\nthen you check it back\nin when you're done.\n\n297\n00:15:01.906 --> 00:15:04.865\nOnce we have it checked out,\nit's read only for everybody else.\n\n298\n00:15:04.865 --> 00:15:07.425\nYou're editing it, everybody else\ncan see it, but they can't edit.\n\n299\n00:15:07.425 --> 00:15:09.605\nIf you check it back in,\nthen everybody else can edit.\n\n300\n00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.420\nTesting server.\n\n301\n00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:17.578\nIf you're going to be using\na testing server like Map or\n\n302\n00:15:17.578 --> 00:15:21.164\nWAP, Windows Apache, My SQL PHP, or\n\n303\n00:15:21.164 --> 00:15:26.433\nMap Mac Apache My SQL PHP,\nyou wouldn't put that here,\n\n304\n00:15:26.433 --> 00:15:30.719\nyou would select what server you're using.\n\n305\n00:15:30.719 --> 00:15:36.600\nOr if you are using a Microsoft server,\nright, you could use ASP.net, for example.\n\n306\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.410\nDreamweaver uses ColdFusion\nas their server type, but\n\n307\n00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.500\nthere is the PHP MySQL at the bottom.\n\n308\n00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.390\nSo, if you downloaded the free software\ncalled WAMP or MAMP, or Xampp,\n\n309\n00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.006\nI think is another one.\n\n310\n00:15:48.006 --> 00:15:52.237\nXampp is a fully developed\npackage that you can get and\n\n311\n00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:54.594\nthat will work great as well.\n\n312\n00:15:54.594 --> 00:15:58.767\nbut they use the open source services for\ncreating a server, and\n\n313\n00:15:58.767 --> 00:16:01.020\nyou can choose that there.\n\n314\n00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.540\nThese are available as well.\n\n315\n00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.400\nThen it says automatically push files to\nthe testing server so that will upload\n\n316\n00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.400\nthe file directly to the server every time\nyou save- and auto-save dependent files.\n\n317\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.590\nNot only will it save the file\nyou're working on, but\n\n318\n00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.710\nif it's attached to any other\nfiles it will save that as well.\n\n319\n00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.250\nSo most of the time you're\njust going to work here, and\n\n320\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.240\nconfigure these settings\non the basic section.\n\n321\n00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.650\nNow there is also more options\nhere available as well.\n\n322\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.680\nUse passive FTP.\n\n323\n00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.980\nI have connected to host\nservers like Godaddy, or\n\n324\n00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:34.330\nOneaandone, or iPage, and sometimes\nthey say you have to use passive FTP.\n\n325\n00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.100\nSo, if they say that,\nyou need to make sure that's checked.\n\n326\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.640\nUse IPV6 transfer mode.\n\n327\n00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.250\nSo if you're on a system\nthat is IPV6 not IPV4,\n\n328\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.310\nInternet Protocol Version 6 or Internet\nProtocol Version 4, you'll need to make\n\n329\n00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:50.090\nsure that you have that selected if\nit's mandated by your host company.\n\n330\n00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.960\nUse proxy as defined in Preferences.\n\n331\n00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.750\nI don't have any preferences set up for\nproxies.\n\n332\n00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:58.440\nBasically it's allowing me\nto piggyback on servers.\n\n333\n00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.170\nUse FTP performance optimization.\n\n334\n00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.870\nSo basically it's gonna upload\nthe files as best as it can\n\n335\n00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.210\nin the most efficient manner as it can.\n\n336\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:09.560\nAnd then use alternative of FTP move\nmethods so you can choose that as well.\n\n337\n00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.130\nNow hovering over these, it actually\ntells you what it does like this option,\n\n338\n00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.670\nyou get errors either when rolled backs\nare enabled or moving files, okay,\n\n339\n00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.470\nso you can get that screen tip to tell\nyou what's going on with these items.\n\n340\n00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.480\nAll right,\nI'm gonna close down More Options, but\n\n341\n00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.900\nI'm gonna click Save because these\nfiles are, it's working now and\n\n342\n00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.550\nI can see that I've added jimbo.com,\nour web address is www.jimbo.com,\n\n343\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.520\nmy FTP is the connection type I'm using,\nand it is a remote host.\n\n344\n00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.970\nAnd it is not a testing server.\n\n345\n00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.650\nTesting server would be if I had a local\nserver like that WAMP or that MAMP or\n\n346\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:40.870\nthat XAMP.\n\n347\n00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.060\nAnd I had that local to me,\nI could use that as a testing server, and\n\n348\n00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.750\nmy files would then be\nuploaded to that and\n\n349\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.680\nI would test it before I\ndeploy it out to the internet.\n\n350\n00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.640\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna hit Save at this moment in time.\n\n351\n00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.330\nIt's gonna say it's gonna redo the cache\nlike it normally does whenever you do\n\n352\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.800\nanything inside of the managed sites.\n\n353\n00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.810\nAnd then I'm gonna click Done.\n\n354\n00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:03.790\nSo at this point, nothing in my files\npanel has changed except that now I can\n\n355\n00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:11.470\nuse the files panel to literally treat my\nremote server and my local root directory,\n\n356\n00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:15.440\nI can treat them as Windows Explorer and\ndrag files from one side to the other.\n\n357\n00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.740\nAnd when I do that it will upload or\n\n358\n00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.950\ndownload the files depending\non what direction I go in.\n\n359\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:24.140\nSo to do that, i'd like to go to the icons\nhere across the top, and click on this\n\n360\n00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.750\nicon right here, because this will let me\nsee all of the local and remote files.\n\n361\n00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:34.040\nNow this is the icon that in Windows takes\nover my entire Dreamweaver application.\n\n362\n00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.257\nNow what you're seeing here on\nthe right are the local files.\n\n363\n00:18:36.257 --> 00:18:39.070\nThese are the files we've been\nworking on throughout our series.\n\n364\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.320\nAnd to the left is my remote server,\nwhich I'm not connected to yet.\n\n365\n00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.780\nAs a matter of fact, I have to plug it in,\njust like I'm plugging in a charger for\n\n366\n00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.550\nmy iPhone or my Samsung Galaxy, okay,\nso I have to click to plug that in.\n\n367\n00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:55.470\nWhen I do that, it will use the settings\nthat I just created in the server settings\n\n368\n00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.320\nto make that connection happen.\n\n369\n00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.760\nAnd you see it's got the same\ndialog box I've seen before.\n\n370\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.560\nAnd now you can see here are all the files\nthat I've created in the past and\n\n371\n00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.510\neverything that I've worked on.\n\n372\n00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:10.060\nSo the current site that exists out there,\nthere's the html file for that.\n\n373\n00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.770\nI do have a send php, I have stars html,\nI'm not sure what that's all about, but\n\n374\n00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.680\nI guess I must have been working\non something at some point.\n\n375\n00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.970\nAnd then you can see my folders for\nCSS, fonts, images, javascripts,\n\n376\n00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.210\nsounds and any statistics.\n\n377\n00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.210\nThe statistics one has\nactually been added by\n\n378\n00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:29.893\niPage the hosting company that I use and\nyou can see it was updated on May 20,\n\n379\n00:19:29.893 --> 00:19:32.790\n2016 which is basically today, whereas\nmy other files were there since 2014.\n\n380\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.750\nWhat I'd like to do is,\n\n381\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.260\nI'm gonna right click in this area and\nI'm gonna create a new folder.\n\n382\n00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.910\nAnd I'm gonna title this folder TestSite.\n\n383\n00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:46.930\nJust like that.\n\n384\n00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.820\nActually I'm gonna get\nthe spelling right here.\n\n385\n00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:50.700\nNo.\n\n386\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.400\nOkay, I'm gonna rename this, there we go.\n\n387\n00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.090\nI'll just call it Test, nice and easy.\n\n388\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.380\nHit Enter, and it's going to create that.\n\n389\n00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.680\nSo what I'd like to do at this point\nis I'd like to select the files that\n\n390\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.780\nare local to me, and\nI'd like to upload them to the Test so\n\n391\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.430\nthat way I can surf to my website.\n\n392\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:12.120\nSo I know that I'm gonna need\nthese folders for assets and\n\n393\n00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.540\nI'm gonna control click on Fonts,\nImages, Scripts, Styles.\n\n394\n00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.228\nI'm going to go down to Templates\ncause I need that folder.\n\n395\n00:20:19.228 --> 00:20:23.120\nI'm going to need the About, the Careers,\nthe Company News, the Contact,\n\n396\n00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.870\nI'm gonna need the Index, and\nthose are the files I'm going to need.\n\n397\n00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:30.750\nSo I'm gonna take that and drag it on top\nof my Test on the left hand side, so I'm\n\n398\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:35.080\nliterally going to drag it over here until\nI don't see the Ghostbuster's symbol.\n\n399\n00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.430\nNotice I see Ghostbuster's all the way,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n400\n00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.370\nSee Ghostbuster's until I\nhover over the yellow folder.\n\n401\n00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.680\nJust like I'm putting\nit inside the folder.\n\n402\n00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.730\nWhen I release, I let go, and\nit says Preparing to Upload and\n\n403\n00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.120\nit's literally uploading one folder\nat a time, one file at a time.\n\n404\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.930\nIt said, should independent files\nbe included in the transfer?\n\n405\n00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.740\nAnd the reason it's saying that is\nbecause it hit the templates file, and\n\n406\n00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.190\nthe templates file is\nassociated with other files.\n\n407\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.090\nI'm not worried about that cuz\nI'm already bringing them in, so\n\n408\n00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.420\nI'm gonna say don't show this\nmessage again, and I'm gonna say no.\n\n409\n00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.480\nNow in the future you might\nactually wanna do that so\n\n410\n00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.530\nthat way you'll always get the files\nyou need no matter what you do.\n\n411\n00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.850\nNow since the index file has been\nmodified do you wish to save it?\n\n412\n00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.600\nThat's because I modified it by adding\nthat text in there from the Word document\n\n413\n00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.380\nbut I never saved, so I forgot to do that.\n\n414\n00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.290\nThank you Dreamweaver for\nproviding me that.\n\n415\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.280\nI'm gonna say yes to all in\ncase there's anything else.\n\n416\n00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:20.860\nFantastic.\n\n417\n00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.020\nSo now, inside of the test\nfolder I have the index html and\n\n418\n00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.190\nI can surf out to that site now and\nI can actually see what's going on.\n\n419\n00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.790\nSo that's what I'm gonna do now.\n\n420\n00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.110\nI'm gonna bring up Firefox, and\n\n421\n00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.750\nget rid of this message because I\njust installed Firefox recently.\n\n422\n00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:40.270\nI'm gonna type in jimbeau.com and\nwhen I hit Enter,\n\n423\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.380\nyou're gonna see the site\nthat's all ready there.\n\n424\n00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.180\nOkay, so\nthat's a site that's all ready there.\n\n425\n00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.463\nBut instead,\nI'm gonna go after jimbeau.com and\n\n426\n00:21:48.463 --> 00:21:52.280\nhit /test and then I'll do /index.html.\n\n427\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:58.810\nAnd when I hit Enter literally it brings\nup the site that we've just created.\n\n428\n00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.920\nAnd I don't know if it's my resolution or\nwhat.\n\n429\n00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.670\nIt looks like I might have forgotten to\nbring in the Images folder or something.\n\n430\n00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.850\nActually I'm not sure what I forgot.\n\n431\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.210\nYes, I know what I forgot.\n\n432\n00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:12.760\nI forgot to move the banner3 image\ninto the Images folder, which is\n\n433\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.540\nmeaning that I can't see my banner on my\npage anymore, so I need to correct that.\n\n434\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.130\nSo here, that's good,\nwe can demonstrate how to do that.\n\n435\n00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.060\nI want to go back into my Giles panel and\n\n436\n00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:27.070\nI guess the original banners file is\nprobably in the multimedia folder.\n\n437\n00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.740\nI think that's where I\ngrabbed it from before.\n\n438\n00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.570\nThere it is, banner three, and\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna drag\n\n439\n00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:36.310\nbanner three here and\ndrop it right into the images folder.\n\n440\n00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:40.630\nBut the problem with that is it's going to\nsay, hey, that's not where the file was.\n\n441\n00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.760\nIt's going to say, it wasn't there before.\n\n442\n00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.320\nSo let's see what happens when I do that.\n\n443\n00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.140\nI'm literally going to do\nthat in my local files here.\n\n444\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.530\nSo, I'm gonna bring it up,\nand drop it into images here.\n\n445\n00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:58.310\nAnd when I let go it's gonna say, hey\nseveral of my HTML files relied on that.\n\n446\n00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.610\nSo I'm gonna say,\n\n447\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.370\nI need to update them to make sure\nthat they know where to find the file.\n\n448\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.670\nAgain this is why Dreamweaver's so\nawesome.\n\n449\n00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.280\nBecause it keeps track of everything.\n\n450\n00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:06.990\nSo I'm gonna click update.\n\n451\n00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.530\nSo it's updating all those files.\n\n452\n00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:15.830\nNow what that means is, is that I need to\ngo back in and republish my Images folder,\n\n453\n00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.470\nand then all of my HTML files so\nthey have all of that new information.\n\n454\n00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.210\nI'm gonna click on Images, I'm gonna\nhold the control key down on the PC and\n\n455\n00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.520\nthe command key on the Mac, and\nI'm gonna select these files,\n\n456\n00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.520\nas these were all changed\njust a few seconds ago.\n\n457\n00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:32.510\nNow, I'm gonna drag this\nover to the Test folder.\n\n458\n00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.550\nWhen I see the little icon come up,\nI can release.\n\n459\n00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.090\nIt's gonna say Preparing to Upload and\nit's gonna say, look,\n\n460\n00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.740\nwe've seen that it's been modified again.\n\n461\n00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.940\nI'm saying Yes, Save All and there we go.\n\n462\n00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.700\nNow, I'm gonna go back to Firefox.\n\n463\n00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.100\nI'm gonna refresh the page on that.\n\n464\n00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.729\nTest site that I had.\n\n465\n00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:55.456\nSo I'm gonna go back to www, and\nit should come up with .jimbo.com, and\n\n466\n00:23:55.456 --> 00:24:00.891\nthen I'm gonna do /textindex right here\nWhen I click on that, I'm gonna refresh.\n\n467\n00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:02.587\nIt looks like my cache is not working.\n\n468\n00:24:05.953 --> 00:24:08.180\nOkay, well let's do this.\n\n469\n00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.020\nLet's bring it up nice and\nfresh in Chrome.\n\n470\n00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.205\nSo there's no cache.\n\n471\n00:24:15.205 --> 00:24:19.020\nWww.jimboe.com/test.\n\n472\n00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.760\nBecause I'm specifying\nthe folder I put it in and\n\n473\n00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.650\nthen specifying the file name I\nwant to access in that folder.\n\n474\n00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.386\nNow I probably don't need to put\nindex.html because if I just point to test\n\n475\n00:24:28.386 --> 00:24:31.570\nit always looks for,\nevery browser looks for an index.html.\n\n476\n00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.950\nAs a matter of fact,\nlet met do that without the index.html and\n\n477\n00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:34.750\nsee what happens.\n\n478\n00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.910\nI'll just put the forward slash there,\nhit enter, and it automatically finds it.\n\n479\n00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.340\nSo it was a caching issue in Firefox.\n\n480\n00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.950\nSo it's working fine here,\nand I would need to go in and\n\n481\n00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:48.330\nclear the cache from Firefox and\nmake sure that everything is good.\n\n482\n00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:52.190\nBut now this site, that we worked\non is now up on the internet.\n\n483\n00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.300\nAs a matter of fact, if I click on\nabout us there's that information's.\n\n484\n00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.650\nHere's company news, here's career's so\nthat you got the careers there.\n\n485\n00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.420\nContact us should have our form and\nso on so on and so forth.\n\n486\n00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.470\nSo I go back home and\nthere's the home page and\n\n487\n00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.025\nfor some reason refresh that cause\nthe image is broken, not sure why.\n\n488\n00:25:07.025 --> 00:25:09.920\nIt''s not broken anywhere else.\n\n489\n00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.630\nAlright, so we got some little anomalies\ngoing on and I'd have to test for that but\n\n490\n00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:21.110\nother than that, that is how you\npublish your designs out to the web.\n\n491\n00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.950\nYou publish it using the tools\nwithin Dreamweaver and\n\n492\n00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:30.020\nyou can see, it lets me know what's\ngoing on, it lets me know what I need.\n\n493\n00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.420\nTo do, to make sure everything's\ngonna work as best as possible.\n\n494\n00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.310\nSo at this time, I'm going to\ndisconnect from my remote site.\n\n495\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.430\nI'm going to revert back to Dreamweaver.\n\n496\n00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.960\nAnd I'm back here.\n\n497\n00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.200\nAnd, the last piece I'd like to leave you\nwith is, we've been talking throughout\n\n498\n00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:52.000\nthis entire session how you can learn what\nDream Weaver does to program the code.\n\n499\n00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.470\nAnd so you can learn HTML, you can learn\nCSS from the code that it rights for you.\n\n500\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:59.680\nSo I'd like to show you some\nwebsites that'll provide you that\n\n501\n00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.760\ninformation as well.\n\n502\n00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.700\nSo if you're ever curious\nenough to go learn it you can.\n\n503\n00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.600\nAnd these are free for you to use.\n\n504\n00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.593\nSo I've already demonstrated\nthat there's the W3.org,\n\n505\n00:26:09.593 --> 00:26:12.680\nwhich is\nthe World Wide Web Consortium.org.\n\n506\n00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.710\nAnd basically, they're responsible for\nthe standards of the internet.\n\n507\n00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.480\nBut I'd like to show you W3 schools.\n\n508\n00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.630\nW3 schools is a website, w3schools.com,\nthat you can go to to learn\n\n509\n00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:26.390\nall of the programming languages\nthat are out there on the web.\n\n510\n00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.250\nSo not just HTML and\nCSS which are over here at the top, but\n\n511\n00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.140\nyou can learn JavaScript,\nyou can learn about HTML graphics.\n\n512\n00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:38.800\nYou could learn about the Server side\ncode, so SQL, PHP, ASP, ASP.net.\n\n513\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.240\nOkay, you can learn about building\nweb pages, right from this link.\n\n514\n00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.290\nAnd you can also learn about XML and\nAJAX, so\n\n515\n00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.064\nthese are XML derivatives that\nsupport data within your web pages.\n\n516\n00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:55.940\nSo this is a tool that's very useful,\nhowever it's not as convenient.\n\n517\n00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.330\nYou have to do a lot of work.\n\n518\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.110\nYou have to put in the heavy lifting.\n\n519\n00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:03.460\nYou can see here I've got some example\ncode and I can click Try It Myself and\n\n520\n00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.915\nI can write the code but\nit's a lot of work.\n\n521\n00:27:05.955 --> 00:27:09.925\nHowever, the other site I'm gonna\nshow you is Code academy, codecademy.\n\n522\n00:27:09.925 --> 00:27:15.375\nAnd Codecademy is a free service that\nwill literally use interactivity,\n\n523\n00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:17.890\nvideos and interactive coding\n\n524\n00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:22.030\nto help you learn how to code in whatever\nprogramming language you choose.\n\n525\n00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:27.010\nAnd this one also does all of the similar\nlanguages, so HTML 5 and CSS, JavaScript,\n\n526\n00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.050\njQuery, PHP.\n\n527\n00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:32.290\nBut you also have popular\nlanguages like Python and Ruby.\n\n528\n00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:37.310\nSo you can learn that,\nRuby on Rails even from this website.\n\n529\n00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.610\nAnd, it is free.\n\n530\n00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.870\nAll you need to do is create an account.\n\n531\n00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.930\nThat's it, Email, Password, and Username.\n\n532\n00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.090\nThat is it.\n\n533\n00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.560\nYou create the account, and\nyou can start learning for free.\n\n534\n00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.960\nIn an interactive environment,\nthat is going to test you, and quiz you,\n\n535\n00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.540\nand provide you as much\ninformation as possible, so\n\n536\n00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.440\nyou will learn in a way\nthat is intuitive for you.\n\n537\n00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.160\nSo, W3 Schools, I use as a reference.\n\n538\n00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.198\nSo if I need to know, what is that\nsource tag again, or that audio tag and\n\n539\n00:28:04.198 --> 00:28:05.480\nhow can I use that?\n\n540\n00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.385\nYeah, I will use W3 Schools\nto go find that.\n\n541\n00:28:08.385 --> 00:28:11.580\nCause I just need some code real quick,\nand I can grab the code from that and\n\n542\n00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.430\npaste it right where I need it,\nso it's very nice to do that.\n\n543\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:17.440\nBut if I want to learn the root\nlanguage from scratch.\n\n544\n00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.840\nI can go right here to codecademy and\nI can utilize that\n\n545\n00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.540\nto learn that programming language\nthat I might not learn anywhere else.\n\n546\n00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.110\nAnd learn it in a way where\nI'm actually programming and\n\n547\n00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.279\nI'm creating something\nwhile I'm doing that.\n\n548\n00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.290\n>> Great information Jim and it was\nfascinating to see the site from beginning\n\n549\n00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:40.610\nto end, get published up there on\nthe website, your website there and\n\n550\n00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.100\nthen learn about those\nresources that we can use.\n\n551\n00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.230\nDoes look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode but\n\n552\n00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.820\nbefore we sign off,\ndo you got any parting words?\n\n553\n00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.180\nSure, thanks Wes.\n\n554\n00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.840\nI'd like to say that Dreamweaver\nis a wonderful tool.\n\n555\n00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.180\nIt's actually the first tool that I\nused within the Adobe Creative Suite.\n\n556\n00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.020\nI've been using it since 1997 and\nI love it.\n\n557\n00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.345\nThe changes that they keep making\njust make make it better and\n\n558\n00:29:01.345 --> 00:29:02.965\nbetter all the time.\n\n559\n00:29:02.965 --> 00:29:06.535\nAnd once you start using Dreamweaver\nyou're gonna see how intuitive it is to\n\n560\n00:29:06.535 --> 00:29:10.785\ncreate web pages and how much fun when\nyou start publishing your work out there.\n\n561\n00:29:10.785 --> 00:29:12.465\nAnd you can see it out on the web.\n\n562\n00:29:12.465 --> 00:29:14.265\nAnd you can see what's going on.\n\n563\n00:29:14.265 --> 00:29:16.245\nIt just makes it so much fun.\n\n564\n00:29:16.245 --> 00:29:19.965\nAnd it leads you to other languages,\nit leads you to other ideas.\n\n565\n00:29:19.965 --> 00:29:22.860\nIt leads you to doing these\nthings that you never thought.\n\n566\n00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.670\nSo Dreamweaver is just the start,\nif you want to do web design\n\n567\n00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:30.700\ngo learn some of those other languages\nusing the resources that I provide you.\n\n568\n00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.980\nBut at this point you should have a good\nfoundation on how to use the Dreamweaver\n\n569\n00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.950\napplication, and it was my\npleasure working with all of you.\n\n570\n00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.880\n>> Well we appreciate all the information\nthat you've given us here,\n\n571\n00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.600\nit's been really enjoyable, and\nwe appreciate you the viewer out there.\n\n572\n00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.840\nSigning out for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Wes Brian.\n\n573\n00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.630\n>> And I'm Jim Surrles.\n\n574\n00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:49.903\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n575\n00:29:49.903 --> 00:29:58.087\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
